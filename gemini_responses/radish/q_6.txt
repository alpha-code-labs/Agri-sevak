As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling viral diseases in Radish in Haryana.

First, let's address the specific viral diseases you've mentioned:

*   **Yellow vein clearing:** This is not known to affect Radish as a specific viral disease.
*   **Stripe:** This is not known to affect Radish as a specific viral disease.
*   **Tristeza:** This is not known to affect Radish. Tristeza virus primarily affects citrus crops.
*   **Stunt virus:** This is not known to affect Radish as a specific viral disease. Stunting can be a symptom of various stresses or viral infections, but "Stunt virus" is not a recognized specific virus name for radish.

However, **Leaf curl** (e.g., Radish Leaf Curl Virus, RaLCV) and **Mosaic** (e.g., Radish Mosaic Virus, RaMV, Turnip Mosaic Virus, TuMV, Cucumber Mosaic Virus, CMV) are known to affect Radish in our region.

It is crucial to understand that there are no direct chemical cures for viral diseases once a plant is infected. Therefore, management strategies focus on prevention, removal of infected plants, and most importantly, controlling the insect vectors that transmit these viruses.

Here are the recommended control measures for viral diseases like Leaf Curl and Mosaic in Radish:

**1. Cultural Practices (Prevention is Key):**

*   **Use Healthy Seeds:** Always use certified, virus-free seeds from reputable sources.
*   **Roguing:** Regularly inspect your field and immediately remove and destroy (bury or burn) any plants showing symptoms of viral infection (e.g., curling leaves, mosaic patterns, yellowing, stunting). This prevents the spread of the virus to healthy plants.
*   **Weed Management:** Keep the field and surrounding areas free of weeds, as many weeds can act as alternative hosts for both viruses and their insect vectors.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops to break the disease cycle.
*   **Maintain Field Hygiene:** Remove crop residues after harvest to reduce potential inoculum sources.
*   **Proper Spacing and Nutrition:** Ensure optimal plant spacing and balanced nutrition to promote vigorous growth, which can help plants tolerate stress better.
*   **Physical Barriers:** For small-scale or nursery cultivation, using insect-proof nets (e.g., 40-50 mesh) can help exclude insect vectors.

**2. Vector Control (Chemical Management):**

Viral diseases in Radish are primarily transmitted by sucking pests like **whiteflies** (for Leaf Curl) and **aphids** (for Mosaic viruses). Controlling these vectors is paramount to preventing the spread of the disease. Apply insecticides as soon as vector populations are observed, following the recommended dosages and safety precautions.

**For Aphids and Whiteflies:**

*   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: Apply at 0.5-0.75 ml per litre of water.
*   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: Apply at 0.2-0.4 g per litre of water.
*   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP: Apply at 0.2-0.3 g per litre of water.
*   **Flonicamid** 50% WG: Apply at 0.3 g per litre of water (primarily for aphids).
*   **Buprofezin** 25% SC: Apply at 1.25 ml per litre of water (effective against whitefly nymphs).
*   **Dimethoate** 30% EC: Apply at 1.5-2.0 ml per litre of water.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Rotation of Chemicals:** To prevent the development of insecticide resistance, rotate insecticides with different modes of action.
*   **Timing of Application:** Apply insecticides during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) and follow the instructions on the product label for safe handling, application, and pre-harvest intervals (PHI).
*   **Integrated Pest Management (IPM):** Combine cultural, biological, and chemical methods for sustainable and effective pest and disease management.

By implementing these strategies, you can significantly reduce the incidence and spread of viral diseases in your Radish crop.
