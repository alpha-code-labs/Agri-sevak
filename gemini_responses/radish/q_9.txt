To control Red spider mite (Tetranychus urticae) and Rust mite (Eriophyidae family, e.g., *Aculops* spp.) in Radish, a combination of cultural practices and timely application of CIBRC approved acaricides is recommended.

**1. Monitoring and Cultural Practices:**
*   Regularly inspect the underside of radish leaves for mites, their eggs, and fine webbing (characteristic of red spider mites). For rust mites, look for bronzing, russeting, or stunted growth on leaves and roots.
*   Maintain good field sanitation by removing weeds, which can serve as alternate hosts for mites.
*   Ensure proper irrigation to reduce dust, as dusty conditions can favor mite multiplication.
*   Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush, succulent growth preferred by mites.

**2. Chemical Control (Acaricides):**
Apply acaricides when mite populations begin to build up, typically when 5-10 mites per leaf are observed, or symptoms of rust mites are visible. Ensure thorough coverage, especially on the underside of leaves. Rotate chemicals with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

*   **Spiromesifen** 22.9% SC: Apply at 125 ml per acre in 200-300 litres of water.
*   **Fenpyroximate** 5% EC: Apply at 200-300 ml per acre in 200-300 litres of water.
*   **Propargite** 57% EC: Apply at 1.0-1.25 litres per acre in 200-300 litres of water.
*   **Abamectin** 1.9% EC: Apply at 150-200 ml per acre in 200-300 litres of water.
*   **Wettable Sulphur** 80% WP: Apply at 1.5-2.0 kg per acre in 200-300 litres of water. This is particularly effective against rust mites and can suppress spider mites.
*   **Etoxazole** 10% SC: Apply at 100-125 ml per acre in 200-300 litres of water. (This is a mite growth regulator, effective against eggs and nymphs).

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and strictly follow the label instructions for the specific product you are using, including recommended dosages, safety precautions, and pre-harvest intervals (PHI).
*   Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where mites primarily reside.
*   Consider the use of sticky traps for monitoring and biological control agents if available and feasible for your farming system.
