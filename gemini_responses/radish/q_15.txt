As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the specified pests in Radish cultivation in Haryana:

### 1. Grasshopper

Grasshoppers are polyphagous pests that can feed on radish foliage, especially during early growth stages.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Maintain field sanitation by removing weeds and crop residues that can serve as breeding grounds.
    *   Deep plowing after harvest can expose and destroy eggs.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   For localized infestations, hand-picking can be effective.
    *   For widespread infestations, consider spraying with:
        *   **Malathion 50% EC**: 1.25 L per acre in 500 L of water.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC**: 100-125 ml per acre in 200-400 L of water.
        *   **Quinalphos 25% EC**: 1.0 L per acre in 500 L of water.

### 2. Painted Bug (Bagrada hilaris / Bagrada cruciferarum)

The Painted bug is a significant pest of cruciferous crops, including radish. Both nymphs and adults suck sap from leaves, stems, and pods, causing wilting, yellowing, and stunted growth.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Remove and destroy crop residues immediately after harvest to reduce pest carryover.
    *   Control cruciferous weeds in and around the field, as they can act as alternate hosts.
    *   Early sowing can sometimes help escape peak pest populations.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Spraying with systemic or contact insecticides is effective:
        *   **Malathion 50% EC**: 1.25 L per acre in 500 L of water.
        *   **Dimethoate 30% EC**: 330 ml per acre in 200-400 L of water.
        *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL**: 50-70 ml per acre in 200-400 L of water.
        *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG**: 40-80 g per acre in 200-400 L of water.

### 3. Red Cotton Bug (Dysdercus cingulatus)

This is not known to affect Radish. The Red cotton bug is primarily a pest of cotton and other malvaceous plants, feeding on developing seeds.

### 4. Black Ants

Black ants are generally not a direct primary pest of radish plants themselves. They are often found in radish fields for the following reasons:
*   **Association with Aphids:** Ants are known to "farm" aphids for their honeydew secretions. If ants are abundant, it often indicates the presence of aphid infestations on radish, which *are* a direct pest.
*   **Feeding on Seeds/Seedlings:** In some cases, ants might feed on germinating seeds or tender seedlings, causing stand reduction.
*   **Disturbing Soil:** They can disturb the soil around roots, especially in sandy soils.

*   **Control Strategy:**
    *   **Prioritize Aphid Control:** If ants are present due to aphid infestations, the most effective strategy is to control the aphids. Once the honeydew source is removed, the ants will naturally disperse. Refer to specific recommendations for aphid control in radish if needed.
    *   **Direct Control (if ants are causing direct damage):** If ants are directly feeding on seeds/seedlings or causing significant soil disturbance, direct control measures can be considered:
        *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC**: 2.5 L per acre as a drench around affected areas or as a perimeter treatment.
        *   **Fipronil 5% SC**: 400-600 ml per acre as a spray, targeting ant trails and nests.
        *   **Fipronil 0.3% GR**: 8-10 kg per acre, applied as granules in affected areas, particularly if ants are nesting in the soil.

Always ensure to follow the label instructions for any chemical pesticide regarding dosage, application method, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and safety precautions.
