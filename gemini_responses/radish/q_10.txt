As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified strategies for controlling borers, caterpillars, Diamondback moth, and leaf folders in Radish in Haryana.

It is crucial to adopt an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods for sustainable and effective pest control.

### General IPM Principles for Radish:
*   **Regular Monitoring:** Inspect your radish crop frequently for early signs of pest infestation.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting radish or other cruciferous crops (cabbage, cauliflower, mustard) in the same field consecutively.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy crop residues and weeds that can harbor pests.
*   **Timely Sowing:** Adhere to recommended sowing times to avoid peak pest periods.

### Specific Control Measures:

#### 1. Borers (Root Borers, e.g., Root Maggots)
Root borers, primarily root maggots, tunnel into the radish roots, making them unmarketable.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Deep ploughing to expose pupae to predators and sun.
    *   Avoid planting radish in fields with a history of severe root maggot infestation.
*   **Chemical Control (Soil Application):**
    *   Apply at the time of sowing or early seedling stage.
    *   **Fipronil 0.3% GR**: Apply 10-15 kg per acre by broadcasting and mixing into the soil before sowing or as a side dressing at early growth stages.

#### 2. Caterpillars (General Leaf Feeders)
This includes pests like Cabbage butterfly larvae, Tobacco caterpillar, and Cabbage semilooper, which feed on radish leaves.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Hand-picking of larger caterpillars and egg masses in small plots.
*   **Biological Control:**
    *   Use of bio-pesticides like *Bacillus thuringiensis* (Bt) formulations, especially against young larvae.
*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
    *   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG**: Mix 0.4 g per litre of water (80-100 g per acre) and spray.
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC**: Mix 0.2 ml per litre of water (60 ml per acre) and spray.

#### 3. Diamondback Moth (DBM)
*Plutella xylostella* is a major pest of radish, with larvae feeding on leaves, creating characteristic "window-pane" damage. It is known for developing resistance to insecticides.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Use of yellow sticky traps to monitor adult moth populations.
*   **Biological Control:**
    *   Regular release of parasitoids like *Cotesia plutellae*.
    *   Use of *Bacillus thuringiensis* (Bt) formulations, particularly effective against young larvae.
*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
    *   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.
    *   **Spinosad 45% SC**: Mix 0.3 ml per litre of water (60-75 ml per acre) and spray.
    *   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG**: Mix 0.4 g per litre of water (80-100 g per acre) and spray.
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC**: Mix 0.2 ml per litre of water (60 ml per acre) and spray.

#### 4. Leaf Folder
Leaf folder larvae fold the leaves and feed from within, skeletonizing the leaf tissue.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Remove and destroy folded leaves containing larvae.
*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
    *   **Indoxacarb 14.5% SC**: Mix 0.5 ml per litre of water (200 ml per acre) and spray.
    *   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG**: Mix 0.4 g per litre of water (80-100 g per acre) and spray.

### Important Considerations:
*   **Spray Volume:** Ensure adequate spray volume (typically 200-400 litres of water per acre) for thorough coverage of the foliage.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always observe the recommended Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) for each chemical to ensure the safety of the harvested radish for consumption. This information is usually provided on the product label.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance, especially for DBM.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) while handling and spraying chemicals. Follow all instructions and safety precautions mentioned on the product label.
*   **Timing of Spray:** Spraying in the late afternoon or evening is generally recommended to minimize impact on pollinators and beneficial insects.
