Scale insects and Mealybugs can occasionally affect Radish, particularly in conditions of high humidity or dense foliage. Effective management involves a combination of cultural practices and judicious use of CIBRC approved insecticides.

**Cultural Practices:**
*   Regular field monitoring to detect infestations early.
*   Remove and destroy severely infested plants or plant parts to prevent spread.
*   Maintain proper plant spacing to improve air circulation.

**Chemical Control:**
For effective control of Scale insects and Mealybugs, consider the following CIBRC approved insecticides. Ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and stem junctions.

*   **Buprofezin 25% SC:**
    *   **Dosage:** 2.5 ml per litre of water (or 500 ml per acre in 200 litres of water).
    *   **Mode of Action:** An insect growth regulator that inhibits chitin synthesis, primarily effective against nymphs.
*   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:**
    *   **Dosage:** 0.5 ml per litre of water (or 100 ml per acre in 200 litres of water).
    *   **Mode of Action:** A systemic neonicotinoid insecticide effective against a wide range of sucking pests.
*   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:**
    *   **Dosage:** 0.5 g per litre of water (or 100 g per acre in 200 litres of water).
    *   **Mode of Action:** A systemic neonicotinoid insecticide, absorbed by plants and acting on the nervous system of pests.
*   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:**
    *   **Dosage:** 1.5 - 2 ml per litre of water (or 300 - 400 ml per acre in 200 litres of water).
    *   **Mode of Action:** A systemic insecticide with two-way movement (xylem and phloem), highly effective against scales and mealybugs.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pest resistance.
*   Strictly follow the instructions on the product label, including dosage, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and safety precautions.
*   Apply insecticides preferably in the evening to minimize impact on beneficial insects.
