As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm the following regarding the diseases mentioned for Radish:

*   **Dieback**: This is not known to affect Radish. Dieback is a condition primarily observed in woody plants, trees, and shrubs, characterized by the progressive death of twigs and branches from the tip downwards. Radish is an herbaceous annual plant and does not develop woody twigs or branches.

*   **Twig blight**: This is not known to affect Radish. Twig blight is a disease affecting woody plants, causing rapid browning and death of twigs and small branches. Radish, being an herbaceous plant, does not have twigs in this context.

*   **Tikka disease**: This is not known to affect Radish. Tikka disease is a common name specifically used for leaf spot diseases (caused by *Cercospora arachidicola* and *Phaeoisariopsis personata*) primarily affecting Groundnut (Peanut). While Radish can be affected by various leaf spot diseases (e.g., Alternaria leaf spot, Cercospora leaf spot), the specific term "Tikka disease" is not used for Radish.
