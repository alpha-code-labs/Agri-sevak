Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling wilt and parawilt in Radish in Haryana.

Wilt in Radish can be caused by various pathogens (fungal or bacterial), while Parawilt is a physiological disorder. Effective management requires an integrated approach focusing on prevention and early intervention.

### Integrated Management of Wilt (Fungal and Bacterial) in Radish

**1. Cultural and Preventive Practices (Most Crucial):**

*   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting radish or other susceptible cruciferous crops in the same field for at least 3-4 years. Rotate with non-host crops like cereals (wheat, maize) or legumes (chickpea, lentil).
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available and suitable for Haryana conditions, choose radish varieties known for their resistance or tolerance to wilt diseases. Consult with local HAU extension scientists for specific recommendations.
*   **Soil Solarization:** In summer, cover the prepared field with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks. This raises soil temperature, effectively killing many soil-borne pathogens, including wilt-causing fungi and bacteria.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure balanced fertilization. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can make plants more susceptible. Provide adequate potassium and phosphorus.
*   **Proper Irrigation:** Maintain consistent soil moisture. Avoid both waterlogging (which favors fungal growth) and severe drought stress (which weakens plants). Use drip irrigation if possible to deliver water directly to the root zone and reduce leaf wetness.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plants immediately to prevent the spread of pathogens. Clean farm tools and equipment after working in infected areas.
*   **Healthy Seed:** Always use certified, disease-free seeds.

**2. Biological Control:**

*   **Seed Treatment:**
    *   Treat seeds with **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum** @ 5-10 g/kg seed.
    *   Alternatively, treat seeds with **Pseudomonas fluorescens** @ 5-10 g/kg seed.
    *   Mix the bio-agent with a small amount of water to form a slurry, coat the seeds evenly, and dry them in shade before sowing.
*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Mix **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum** @ 2.5 kg/acre with 50-100 kg of farmyard manure (FYM) or compost. Keep the mixture moist for 7-10 days in a shaded place, then broadcast it evenly in the field before sowing or transplanting.
    *   Similarly, **Pseudomonas fluorescens** can be applied @ 2.5 kg/acre mixed with FYM.

**3. Chemical Control (as Seed Treatment or Soil Drench for Early Stages):**

*   **For Fungal Wilt (e.g., Fusarium Wilt):**
    *   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds with **Carbendazim 50% WP** @ 1-2 g/kg seed or **Thiophanate-methyl 70% WP** @ 1-2 g/kg seed.
    *   **Soil Drench (at early symptom appearance):** Drench the soil around the base of affected plants with a solution of **Carbendazim 50% WP** @ 1-2 g/L water or **Thiophanate-methyl 70% WP** @ 1-2 g/L water. Use approximately 200-250 L of solution per acre, ensuring the root zone is thoroughly wetted.
*   **For Bacterial Wilt:**
    *   **Soil Drench (at early symptom appearance):** Drench the soil around the base of affected plants with a combination of **Streptomycin sulphate 9% + Tetracycline hydrochloride 1% SP** @ 6 g/10 L water.
    *   Alternatively, a drench with **Copper oxychloride 50% WP** @ 2-3 g/L water can be used. Use approximately 200-250 L of solution per acre.

**Important Note:** Once plants show severe wilting symptoms, chemical control is often ineffective. Prevention and early intervention are key.

### Management of Parawilt in Radish

Parawilt is a physiological disorder, not caused by a pathogen. It is often triggered by sudden changes in environmental conditions, particularly high temperatures, intense sunlight, and fluctuating soil moisture.

*   **Consistent Soil Moisture:** Ensure uniform and adequate soil moisture. Avoid sudden dry spells followed by heavy irrigation.
*   **Mulching:** Apply organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves) around the base of plants. This helps to conserve soil moisture, regulate soil temperature, and reduce soil heat stress on roots.
*   **Shade Management:** During periods of extreme heat and intense sunlight, consider providing temporary shade to young radish plants using shade nets, especially during the hottest part of the day.
*   **Avoid Root Disturbance:** Minimize any activity that might damage the root system, as this can exacerbate parawilt symptoms.

By implementing these integrated strategies, you can effectively manage wilt and parawilt in your radish crop. For specific local recommendations, please consult with the agricultural extension specialists at HAU, Hisar.
