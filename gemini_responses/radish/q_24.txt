As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I must advise that **transplantation is generally not recommended for radish cultivation.**

Radish is a root crop, and its edible part is the swollen taproot. Transplanting causes significant disturbance to the delicate taproot system, which can lead to:
*   **Forking or malformation of roots:** The radish may develop multiple, misshapen, or stunted roots instead of a single, well-formed one.
*   **Reduced yield and quality:** The stress from transplanting can hinder growth and result in smaller, less marketable radishes.
*   **Delayed maturity:** Transplanted radishes often take longer to mature compared to direct-seeded ones.

**Therefore, the ideal method for radish cultivation is direct seeding.**

However, if for specific reasons (e.g., very early start in a controlled environment, specific research purposes) transplantation is considered absolutely necessary, the following guidelines should be followed to minimize damage:

### Ideal Transplantation Time (If absolutely necessary)
*   **Seedling Age:** Transplant very young seedlings, ideally when they are only **10-15 days old** and have developed 2-3 true leaves. Older seedlings suffer more transplant shock.
*   **Weather Conditions:** Transplant on a cloudy day or late in the afternoon to reduce transplant shock from direct sun and heat.

### Ideal Transplantation Distance (If absolutely necessary)
*   **Row-to-Row:** Maintain a distance of **30-45 cm** between rows.
*   **Plant-to-Plant:** Space individual plants **10-15 cm** apart within the row.

### Ideal Transplantation Process (If absolutely necessary)
1.  **Nursery Preparation:**
    *   Sow radish seeds thinly in well-prepared nursery beds or seedling trays filled with a light, well-drained potting mix.
    *   Ensure adequate moisture for germination and seedling growth.
2.  **Field Preparation:**
    *   Prepare the main field by ploughing and harrowing to achieve a fine tilth.
    *   Incorporate well-rotted farmyard manure or compost.
    *   Form raised beds or prepare flat beds as per your irrigation method.
3.  **Watering Before Transplanting:**
    *   Thoroughly water the nursery bed or seedling trays a few hours before transplanting. This helps to keep the soil intact around the roots and makes it easier to remove seedlings without damage.
4.  **Careful Extraction:**
    *   Gently lift the seedlings, ensuring as much soil as possible remains attached to the roots (forming a small root ball). Using a dibbler or a small trowel can help.
    *   Handle seedlings by their leaves, not by the stem or roots, to avoid injury.
5.  **Planting:**
    *   Make holes in the prepared field at the recommended spacing.
    *   Place each seedling into a hole, ensuring it is planted at the same depth as it was in the nursery. Do not plant too deep or too shallow.
    *   Gently firm the soil around the base of each seedling to ensure good root-to-soil contact.
6.  **Immediate Watering:**
    *   Water the transplanted seedlings immediately after planting. This helps settle the soil around the roots and reduces transplant shock.
7.  **Post-Transplant Care:**
    *   Protect the newly transplanted seedlings from harsh sunlight for the first few days, if necessary, using shade nets or temporary covers.
    *   Maintain consistent moisture in the soil, but avoid waterlogging.

**In summary, while transplantation is possible, direct seeding remains the most effective and recommended method for successful radish cultivation in Haryana.**
