As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling soil pests like termites and root-knot nematodes in radish cultivation in Haryana.

Both termites and root-knot nematodes are significant pests of radish, causing considerable yield losses. An integrated pest management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods, is recommended for effective and sustainable control.

### Control of Termites in Radish

Termites (e.g., *Odontotermes obesus*, *Microtermes obesi*) can cause direct damage to radish roots, leading to wilting and plant death.

*   **Cultural and Mechanical Methods:**
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove crop residues, stubble, and woody debris from the field, as these can serve as food sources and nesting sites for termites.
    *   **Deep Plowing:** Deep plowing during summer exposes termite nests and queens to sunlight and predators, reducing their population.
    *   **Irrigation:** Adequate irrigation can deter termites, as they prefer drier conditions.
    *   **Farmyard Manure (FYM):** Ensure well-decomposed FYM is used, as undecomposed organic matter can attract termites.

*   **Chemical Control (Pre-sowing/Pre-planting Soil Treatment):**
    *   **Chlorpyrifos:** Apply **chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 2.5-4.0 L per acre mixed with 200-400 L of water as a soil drench or broadcast and incorporate into the soil before sowing.
    *   **Fipronil:** Apply **fipronil** 0.3% GR at 6.6-10 kg per acre as a broadcast application and incorporate into the soil before sowing.

### Control of Root-Knot Nematodes (*Meloidogyne* spp.) in Radish

Root-knot nematodes are microscopic worms that infect radish roots, causing characteristic galls or knots, leading to stunted growth, yellowing, and reduced yield.

*   **Cultural Methods:**
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate radish with non-host crops like cereals (wheat, maize, sorghum) or marigold (*Tagetes* spp.), which have nematicidal properties. Avoid continuous cultivation of susceptible crops.
    *   **Solarization:** Cover the moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks during hot summer months (May-June) to raise soil temperature and kill nematodes.
    *   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM), compost, or neem cake at 200-400 kg per acre into the soil 2-3 weeks before sowing. Neem cake has proven nematicidal properties.
    *   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available, choose radish varieties known to have resistance or tolerance to root-knot nematodes.

*   **Chemical Control (Pre-sowing Soil Application):**
    *   **Fluensulfone:** Apply **fluensulfone** 2% GR at 10 kg per acre as a broadcast application and incorporate into the soil before sowing. This is a modern and effective nematicide.
    *   **Carbofuran:** While its use is restricted in some areas, **carbofuran** 3% GR can be applied at 10-13 kg per acre as a broadcast application and incorporated into the soil before sowing, where approved and necessary. *Caution: Handle with extreme care due to its high toxicity and follow all safety guidelines.*

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully, including dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension officers for the most current recommendations and specific product availability in your area.
