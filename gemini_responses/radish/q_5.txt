As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I will provide scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned conditions in Radish, specifically for Haryana.

Please note the following regarding your query:

*   **Scab in Radish:**
    Scab, primarily caused by *Streptomyces scabies* and related species, can affect radish roots, causing rough, corky lesions. Control focuses on preventive cultural practices as direct chemical treatments are generally not effective or recommended for this soil-borne issue in radish.
    *   **Cultural Control Measures:**
        *   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting radish or other susceptible root crops (like potato, carrot, beet) in the same field for at least 3-4 years.
        *   **Soil pH Management:** Scab thrives in alkaline soils. Maintaining a slightly acidic to neutral soil pH (6.0-7.0) can help suppress the disease.
        *   **Soil Moisture:** Ensure adequate and consistent soil moisture, especially during root development, as dry conditions can exacerbate scab severity.
        *   **Organic Matter:** Incorporating well-decomposed organic matter can improve soil health and microbial diversity, which may help suppress scab.
        *   **Resistant Varieties:** If available, choose radish varieties known to have some resistance to common scab.

*   **Canker in Radish:**
    This is not known to affect Radish.

*   **Gummosis in Radish:**
    This is not known to affect Radish.

*   **Lichen in Radish:**
    This is not known to affect Radish. Lichens are symbiotic organisms that grow on surfaces like bark or rocks and are not parasitic or harmful to living radish plants.
