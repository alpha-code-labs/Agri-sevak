As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I advise the following scientifically verified practices to control physical damage in radish cultivation in Haryana:

**1. Fruit Bursting (Root Cracking/Splitting)**
This condition is primarily caused by sudden fluctuations in soil moisture, especially a dry period followed by heavy irrigation or rainfall, leading to rapid expansion of the root.
*   **Consistent Soil Moisture:** Maintain uniform soil moisture throughout the growth period. Avoid extremes of drought and waterlogging.
*   **Proper Irrigation:** Apply light and frequent irrigations rather than heavy, infrequent ones, especially during root development.
*   **Timely Harvesting:** Harvest radishes promptly when they reach marketable size. Over-mature roots are more prone to cracking.
*   **Soil Organic Matter:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost to improve soil structure and water holding capacity, leading to more stable moisture levels.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can promote rapid, succulent growth making roots more susceptible to cracking. Ensure adequate Boron availability, as its deficiency can sometimes contribute to cracking. If a deficiency is confirmed by soil testing, apply **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** at 1-2 kg/acre as a soil application or 0.5-1 g/L as a foliar spray.

**2. Leaf Burning/Melting**
This can be due to high temperatures, intense sunlight, water stress, or chemical phytotoxicity.
*   **Adequate Irrigation:** Ensure consistent and sufficient water supply, especially during hot periods, to prevent water stress.
*   **Shade Management:** During peak summer months or periods of extreme heat, consider planting heat-tolerant varieties or providing temporary partial shade if feasible for small plots.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Maintain recommended plant spacing to ensure good air circulation and reduce humidity around the foliage.
*   **Careful Chemical Application:**
    *   Always follow recommended dosages and application instructions for all pesticides and fertilizers.
    *   Avoid spraying during the hottest part of the day or when plants are under water stress, as this increases the risk of phytotoxicity.
    *   Ensure proper calibration of spray equipment.
*   **Nutrient Balance:** Ensure adequate Potassium supply, as it plays a crucial role in plant stress tolerance. Apply **Potassium sulphate** at 20-30 kg/acre as a basal application if soil tests indicate deficiency.

**3. Hardness in Fruit (Root Hardness/Woodiness)**
This condition is typically a result of over-maturity, water stress, or high temperatures.
*   **Timely Harvesting:** This is the most critical factor. Harvest radishes as soon as they reach their optimal size and before they become pithy or woody. Regular monitoring of root development is essential.
*   **Consistent Soil Moisture:** Maintain uniform soil moisture. Irregular or insufficient watering can lead to fibrous and hard roots.
*   **Temperature Management:** Plant radish varieties suitable for the prevailing season. During warmer periods, opt for heat-tolerant varieties. High temperatures can accelerate maturity and lead to poor root quality.
*   **Soil Health:** Improve soil structure and fertility through the addition of organic matter to support healthy root development.
