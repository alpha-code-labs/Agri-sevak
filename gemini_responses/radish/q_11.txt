Dear farmer,

Controlling beetles, weevils, and sawflies in radish is crucial for a healthy crop. These pests can cause significant damage to leaves, roots, and overall plant vigour. Common pests affecting radish in Haryana include flea beetles, mustard sawfly, and turnip gall weevil.

Here are the scientifically verified recommendations for their control:

**General Management:**
*   Regularly monitor your radish crop, especially during the seedling stage, for early signs of pest infestation.
*   Maintain good field sanitation and remove crop residues to reduce pest harborage.

**Chemical Control:**
For effective control of flea beetles, mustard sawfly, and adult weevils (such as turnip gall weevil adults feeding on foliage), consider applying one of the following CIBRC approved insecticides:

*   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at 125-150 ml per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water. This is effective against flea beetles and can offer some systemic protection.
*   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at 50-100 g per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water. Effective against flea beetles.
*   **Fipronil 5% SC:** Apply at 400-600 ml per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water. This provides good control against flea beetles and mustard sawfly.
*   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** Apply at 100-150 ml per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water. This is effective against flea beetles, mustard sawfly, and adult weevils.
*   **Cypermethrin 25% EC:** Apply at 200-250 ml per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water. Effective against flea beetles, mustard sawfly, and adult weevils.
*   **Malathion 50% EC:** Apply at 1.0-1.5 litres per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water. This is particularly effective against mustard sawfly.
*   **Quinalphos 25% EC:** Apply at 1.0-1.5 litres per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water. Also effective against mustard sawfly and other chewing pests.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully, including dosage, application method, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
*   Apply insecticides during cooler parts of the day, preferably in the evening, to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   Ensure proper safety measures, including wearing protective clothing, while handling and applying pesticides.
