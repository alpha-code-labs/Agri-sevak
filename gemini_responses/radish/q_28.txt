As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified practices to protect your radish crop from various environmental stresses:

### Protection from Extreme Cold and Frost

Radish is a cool-season crop, but extreme cold and frost can severely damage young plants and developing roots, leading to reduced yield and quality.

*   **Irrigation:** Apply a light irrigation in the evening before a predicted frost event. Water has a higher specific heat capacity than air and soil, and as it cools and freezes, it releases latent heat, which can slightly raise the ambient temperature around the plants and protect them.
*   **Row Covers:** For young plants, use agro-textile (non-woven fabric) or clear plastic sheets as row covers. These covers trap heat and protect plants from direct exposure to cold winds and frost. Ensure the covers do not directly touch the foliage. Remove covers during warm daytime hours to prevent excessive heat buildup and allow for air circulation.
*   **Mulching:** Apply a 5-10 cm layer of organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves, sugarcane trash) around the base of the plants. This insulates the soil, protects the roots from freezing temperatures, and helps maintain a more stable soil temperature.
*   **Windbreaks:** Establish natural windbreaks (e.g., taller crops, hedges) or artificial barriers on the windward side of the field to reduce the impact of cold, desiccating winds.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure adequate potassium (K) supply, as it plays a crucial role in improving plant cold hardiness and overall stress tolerance.

### Protection from Heat (Loo) and Intense Sunlight

High temperatures, hot dry winds (Loo), and intense sunlight can lead to premature bolting, pithiness, increased pungency, and poor root development in radish.

*   **Shade Nets:** Install 30-50% shade nets over the radish crop during periods of intense heat and sunlight. This significantly reduces the canopy temperature and light intensity, preventing scorching, bolting, and improving root quality.
*   **Irrigation:** Maintain consistent soil moisture through frequent, light irrigation, especially during hot periods. This helps in evaporative cooling of the plant canopy and prevents wilting. Avoid waterlogging, which can lead to root rot.
*   **Mulching:** Apply a layer of organic mulch to the soil surface. This helps to keep the soil cooler, reduces evaporation, and maintains soil moisture, which is critical during hot conditions.
*   **Variety Selection:** If planting during periods that might experience warmer temperatures, select heat-tolerant radish varieties, although radish is primarily a cool-season crop.
*   **Planting Time:** Adjust planting schedules to avoid peak summer months (typically April to June in Haryana) when temperatures are highest and Loo winds are prevalent. Radish performs best when temperatures are moderate.
*   **Windbreaks:** For hot, dry winds (Loo), windbreaks can reduce the desiccating effect on plants, minimizing water loss and physical damage.
