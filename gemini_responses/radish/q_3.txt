As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling various rot types in Radish, specifically tailored for the conditions in Haryana.

Many of the fungal rot types (Root, Stem, Foot, Collar, Crown, Neck, Seed, and Seedling rot) in Radish are caused by a complex of common soil-borne pathogens such as *Rhizoctonia solani*, *Pythium* spp., *Fusarium* spp., and *Sclerotium rolfsii*. Black Rot, however, is a distinct bacterial disease.

Here's how to manage them:

---

### **1. Root Rot, Stem Rot (at soil line), Foot Rot, Collar Rot, Crown Rot, Neck Rot, Seed Rot, and Seedling Rot (Damping-off)**

These fungal rots are often caused by the same group of pathogens (*Rhizoctonia solani*, *Pythium* spp., *Fusarium* spp., *Sclerotium rolfsii*) and share similar control strategies.

**Symptoms:**
*   **Seed Rot:** Seeds fail to germinate or rot before emergence.
*   **Seedling Rot (Damping-off):** Seedlings collapse at the soil line, often appearing water-soaked and constricted.
*   **Root/Collar/Crown/Neck/Foot Rot:** Lesions develop on roots, hypocotyl, or at the soil line, leading to wilting, yellowing, stunting, and eventual plant death. Roots may appear discolored, soft, or shriveled. White mycelial growth or sclerotia might be visible in severe cases (*Sclerotium rolfsii*).

**Control Measures:**

**A. Cultural and Agronomic Practices (Most Critical for Prevention):**
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice a strict 3-4 year rotation, avoiding other cruciferous crops (cabbage, cauliflower, mustard, etc.) in the same field.
*   **Soil Drainage:** Ensure good soil drainage. Avoid waterlogging, which favors many rot pathogens. Consider raised beds in areas prone to water accumulation.
*   **Seed Quality:** Use certified, healthy, disease-free seeds from a reputable source.
*   **Sowing Depth and Spacing:** Avoid deep sowing and overcrowding. Maintain optimal plant spacing to ensure good air circulation around the plant base.
*   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris immediately. Clean farm tools and equipment regularly.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Provide balanced nutrition. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can lead to lush, tender growth more susceptible to disease.
*   **Irrigation:** Irrigate judiciously. Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day. Water at the base of plants in the morning to allow foliage to dry quickly.
*   **Soil Solarization:** During hot summer months (May-June), cover moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks to reduce soil-borne pathogen inoculum.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** If available, choose radish varieties known to have resistance or tolerance to common soil-borne diseases.

**B. Chemical Control (Use as per CIBRC guidelines and local recommendations):**

*   **Seed Treatment (Essential for Seed Rot and Damping-off):**
    *   Treat seeds before sowing with a fungicide mixture.
    *   **Thiram** 75% WS at 2.5-3.0 g/kg seed.
    *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 1.0-2.0 g/kg seed.
    *   **Metalaxyl** 35% WS at 6.0 g/kg seed (especially effective against *Pythium*).
    *   **Tebuconazole** 2% DS at 2.0 g/kg seed.

*   **Soil Drench/Application (For established plants showing symptoms):**
    *   At the first sign of disease, drench the soil around the plant base.
    *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride** 72.2% SL at 2.0-3.0 ml/L of water (for *Pythium*).
    *   **Metalaxyl** 8% + **Mancozeb** 64% WP at 2.0-2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Pencycuron** 23% SC at 1.0-1.5 ml/L of water (for *Rhizoctonia*).
    *   **Validamycin** 3% L at 2.0-2.5 ml/L of water (for *Rhizoctonia* and *Sclerotium*).
    *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 1.0 g/L of water.

### **2. Black Rot**

This is a bacterial disease caused by *Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris*.

**Symptoms:**
*   Characterized by V-shaped yellow lesions starting from the leaf margins, progressing inwards.
*   Veins within the lesions turn black.
*   Infected roots may show internal blackening of vascular tissues.
*   Can lead to wilting and plant death.

**Control Measures:**

**A. Cultural and Agronomic Practices (Primary Focus for Black Rot):**
*   **Disease-Free Seeds:** This is the most crucial step. Use certified, pathogen-free seeds. Hot water treatment of seeds (50°C for 25-30 minutes) can reduce seed-borne inoculum, but it requires precise temperature control and can affect germination if not done correctly.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Implement a strict 3-4 year rotation, avoiding all cruciferous crops.
*   **Sanitation:** Promptly remove and destroy all infected plant debris and volunteer crucifer plants.
*   **Weed Control:** Control cruciferous weeds that can act as alternative hosts.
*   **Avoid Overhead Irrigation:** Overhead irrigation can splash bacteria from infected to healthy plants. Use drip or furrow irrigation if possible.
*   **Avoid Working in Wet Fields:** Do not work in fields when plants are wet, as this can spread the bacteria.

**B. Chemical Control (Limited Efficacy, Primarily Preventive):**
*   Chemical control for bacterial diseases is generally less effective than for fungal diseases, especially once symptoms are widespread.
*   **Seed Treatment:**
    *   **Streptomycin sulphate** 9% + **Tetracycline hydrochloride** 1% SP at 1.0 g/kg seed.
*   **Foliar Spray (for suppression, not curative):**
    *   **Copper oxychloride** 50% WP at 2.0-3.0 g/L of water, applied preventively or at early stages.

### **3. Fruit Rot**

This is not known to affect Radish. Radish is a root vegetable (a swollen taproot), not a botanical fruit.

**General Recommendation:**
An Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological (if available), and chemical methods, is the most effective strategy for long-term disease management in Radish. Always follow the instructions on the pesticide label and adhere to pre-harvest intervals (PHI). For specific local recommendations or severe outbreaks, please consult with the plant pathology department at HAU, Hisar.
