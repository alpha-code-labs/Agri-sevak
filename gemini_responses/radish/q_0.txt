Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concerns regarding fungal diseases in Radish. Effective management requires an integrated approach combining cultural practices and timely application of scientifically verified chemical controls.

Here's the advice for controlling the specified fungal diseases in Radish:

### General Cultural Practices for Disease Management:
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice a 2-3 year rotation with non-cruciferous crops to break disease cycles.
*   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest.
*   **Disease-free Seeds:** Use certified disease-free seeds.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to improve air circulation and reduce humidity.
*   **Water Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation late in the day to reduce leaf wetness periods.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available, choose radish varieties known for disease resistance.

### Specific Disease Control Measures:

#### 1. Alternaria Leaf Spot/Blight (Alternaria brassicicola, A. raphani)
This disease causes small, dark spots with concentric rings on leaves, which can enlarge and lead to defoliation.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Spray with **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L of water).
    *   Alternatively, use **Chlorothalonil** (75% WP) at 2 kg/acre (or 2 g/L of water).
    *   For systemic action, **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC) can be applied at 0.5 ml/L of water.

#### 2. Anthracnose (Colletotrichum higginsianum)
Symptoms include water-soaked lesions on leaves, petioles, and stems, which turn tan to brown with dark margins.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Apply **Carbendazim** (50% WP) at 0.5 g/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, spray with **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L of water).
    *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC) at 0.5 ml/L of water can also be effective.

#### 3. Blast
This is not known to affect Radish.

#### 4. Blight (General)
For blight conditions in Radish, the primary concern is often Alternaria Blight, as addressed above.

#### 5. Brown Spot
This is not known to affect Radish.

#### 6. Downy Mildew (Peronospora parasitica)
Characterized by yellowish spots on the upper leaf surface and a purplish-grey fuzzy growth on the lower surface.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Spray with **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L of water).
    *   A combination product like **Metalaxyl + Mancozeb** (e.g., 8% + 64% WP) can be used at 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L of water).
    *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride** (72.2% SL) at 2.5 ml/L of water is also effective.
    *   Another option is **Dimethomorph + Mancozeb** (e.g., 9% + 60% WP) at 2 kg/acre (or 2 g/L of water).

#### 7. Powdery Mildew (Erysiphe cruciferarum)
Appears as white, powdery patches on leaves, stems, and sometimes pods.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Apply **Sulphur** (80% WP) at 2 kg/acre (or 2 g/L of water).
    *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC) at 0.5 ml/L of water provides good control.
    *   **Myclobutanil** (10% WP) at 0.5 g/L of water is also an effective systemic fungicide.

#### 8. Grey Mildew
This is not known to affect Radish.

**Important Note:** Always read and follow the instructions on the chemical label for safe and effective application, including pre-harvest intervals (PHI). Consult your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions.
