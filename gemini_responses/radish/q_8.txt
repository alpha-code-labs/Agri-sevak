Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding sucking pests in Radish. These pests can significantly reduce yield and quality if not managed effectively. Here's a scientifically verified approach to control Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips in Radish.

**General Management Practices (Integrated Pest Management - IPM):**

1.  **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your radish crop for the presence of pests, especially on the underside of leaves and growing points. Early detection is key.
2.  **Weed Management:** Keep your fields free of weeds, as they can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
3.  **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation to break the pest life cycle.
4.  **Yellow Sticky Traps:** Install yellow sticky traps (10-12 traps per acre) at crop canopy height. These traps help in monitoring pest populations (especially whiteflies, leafhoppers, and winged aphids) and can also trap a significant number of adults.
5.  **Water Management:** Ensure proper irrigation and avoid water stress, as stressed plants can be more susceptible to pest attacks.
6.  **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush growth that attracts sucking pests.

**Chemical Control Measures:**

When pest populations exceed economic threshold levels, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the underside of leaves.

Here are some CIBRC approved technical chemical names and their recommended dosages for controlling sucking pests in Radish:

*   **For Aphids, Leafhoppers, and Whiteflies:**
    *   Spray with **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL at 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   Alternatively, spray with **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG at 0.2 g per litre of water.
    *   Another option is **Acetamiprid** 20% SP at 0.2 g per litre of water.
    *   For specific control of whitefly nymphs and hoppers, you can use **Buprofezin** 25% SC at 1.25 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Flonicamid** 50% WG can be used at 0.3 g per litre of water, which is effective against aphids and whiteflies and has a different mode of action, aiding in resistance management.

*   **For Thrips:**
    *   Spray with **Fipronil** 5% SC at 1.5-2.0 ml per litre of water.
    *   Alternatively, **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL (as mentioned above) is also effective against thrips.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read the label instructions carefully before using any pesticide.
*   Adhere strictly to the recommended dosage and pre-harvest interval (PHI) to ensure the safety of the produce. Radish is a root vegetable consumed quickly, so PHI is crucial.
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance in pest populations.

**Regarding Psylla:**

This is not known to affect Radish.
