Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the critical importance of balanced nutrition for healthy Radish (Mooli) cultivation. Macro-nutrient deficiencies can significantly impact yield and quality. Here's how to address Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium deficiencies in Radish:

**General Recommendation:**
Before applying any fertilizers, it is highly recommended to conduct a soil test. This will provide an accurate assessment of your soil's nutrient status and help in precise fertilizer application, preventing both deficiencies and excesses.

### Addressing Nitrogen (N) Deficiency in Radish

Nitrogen is crucial for vegetative growth, leaf development, and overall plant vigor.

**Symptoms of Deficiency:**
*   Pale green to yellowing of older leaves (chlorosis), starting from the tips.
*   Stunted plant growth with thin stems.
*   Reduced leaf size and overall poor vigor.

**Corrective Measures:**
*   **Basal Application:** Apply a portion of the recommended Nitrogen at the time of sowing.
*   **Top Dressing:** The remaining Nitrogen should be applied as a top dressing, typically after thinning (around 15-20 days after sowing).
*   **For established deficiency:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 20-30 kg of **Urea** (46% N) per acre as a top dressing. Ensure light irrigation after application to facilitate nutrient uptake and prevent scorching.
    *   **Foliar Spray (for quick recovery):** Dissolve 10-20 g of **Urea** in 1 litre of water (1-2% solution) and spray on the foliage. Repeat after 7-10 days if symptoms persist. Ensure complete coverage of leaves.

### Addressing Phosphorus (P) Deficiency in Radish

Phosphorus is vital for root development, energy transfer, and early plant growth.

**Symptoms of Deficiency:**
*   Stunted growth and overall poor plant development.
*   Leaves may appear dull, dark green, or sometimes develop a purplish tint, especially on the undersides of older leaves.
*   Poorly developed root system.

**Corrective Measures:**
*   **Basal Application:** The entire Phosphorus requirement should ideally be applied at the time of sowing, as P is less mobile in the soil.
*   **For established deficiency:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 50-60 kg of **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5) per acre or 150-200 kg of **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5) per acre. Incorporate it into the soil near the root zone.
    *   **Foliar Spray (for quick recovery):** Dissolve 5-10 g of **Monoammonium Phosphate (MAP)** (12% N, 61% P2O5) or **Potassium Dihydrogen Phosphate (MKP)** (0% N, 52% P2O5, 34% K2O) in 1 litre of water (0.5-1% solution) and spray on the foliage.

### Addressing Potassium (K) Deficiency in Radish

Potassium is essential for water regulation, disease resistance, and the development of quality roots.

**Symptoms of Deficiency:**
*   Yellowing and browning (scorching) of leaf margins, especially on older leaves.
*   Leaves may appear crinkled or curled.
*   Weak stems and reduced resistance to lodging and diseases.
*   Poorly developed and sometimes misshapen roots.

**Corrective Measures:**
*   **Basal Application:** The entire Potassium requirement should ideally be applied at the time of sowing.
*   **For established deficiency:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 60-80 kg of **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** (60% K2O) per acre. Incorporate it into the soil near the root zone.
    *   **Foliar Spray (for quick recovery):** Dissolve 5-10 g of **Potassium Sulphate** (0% N, 0% P2O5, 50% K2O) or **Potassium Dihydrogen Phosphate (MKP)** (0% N, 52% P2O5, 34% K2O) in 1 litre of water (0.5-1% solution) and spray on the foliage.

Always ensure proper irrigation after soil application of fertilizers to help dissolve the nutrients and make them available to the plants. For any specific concerns or severe deficiencies, please consult your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for tailored advice.
