Namaste Kisan bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the importance of balanced nutrition for optimal radish yield and quality. Micronutrient deficiencies can significantly impact your crop. Here's how to address common micronutrient deficiencies in radish, based on scientific recommendations and CIBRC approved chemicals:

**General Recommendations:**
*   Always conduct a soil test to accurately diagnose specific deficiencies and their severity before applying any micronutrients.
*   Foliar applications are often preferred for quick correction in fast-growing crops like radish, providing immediate relief to the plant.
*   Apply foliar sprays during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late afternoon) to enhance absorption and prevent leaf scorching.

### Addressing Specific Micronutrient Deficiencies in Radish:

**1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency:**
*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, small and narrow leaves, interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, sometimes a purplish tint.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray with **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (21% Zn) @ 2.5-5 g/L of water.
        *   Alternatively, spray with **Zinc EDTA** (12% Zn) @ 0.5-1 g/L of water.
    *   **Soil Application (if severe and confirmed by soil test):**
        *   Apply **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (21% Zn) @ 10-25 kg/acre.
        *   Alternatively, apply **Zinc sulphate monohydrate** (33% Zn) @ 5-10 kg/acre.

**2. Iron (Fe) Deficiency:**
*   **Symptoms:** Pronounced interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on young leaves, with veins remaining green. In severe cases, leaves may turn almost white.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray with **Ferrous sulphate** (19% Fe) @ 2.5-5 g/L of water.
        *   Alternatively, spray with **Ferrous EDTA** (12% Fe) @ 0.5-1 g/L of water.
    *   *Note: Soil application of iron is generally less effective in alkaline soils of Haryana; foliar application is highly recommended for quick correction.*

**3. Boron (B) Deficiency:**
*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, internal browning or "hollow heart" in the radish root, cracking of roots or stems, malformed or thickened leaves.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray with **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (20% B) @ 1-2 g/L of water.
    *   **Soil Application (use with caution, as excess boron can be toxic):**
        *   Apply **Borax** (10.5% B) @ 2-4 kg/acre, preferably mixed with fertilizer or sand for even distribution.

**4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency:**
*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, marginal necrosis (tip burn) on young leaves, poor root development, soft and watery tissues, reduced shelf life.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray with **Calcium nitrate** (18.8% Ca) @ 2.5-5 g/L of water.
        *   Alternatively, spray with **Calcium chloride** (27% Ca) @ 2-4 g/L of water.
    *   **Soil Application (for long-term soil amendment, not quick correction):**
        *   Apply **Gypsum** (Calcium sulphate dihydrate) @ 200-500 kg/acre, especially in sodic soils.
        *   For direct calcium supply, **Calcium nitrate** can be applied @ 25-50 kg/acre.

**5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency:**
*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves (yellowing between veins, with veins remaining green), sometimes leading to purplish discoloration in severe cases.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray with **Magnesium sulphate** (9.6% Mg) @ 2.5-5 g/L of water.
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   Apply **Magnesium sulphate** (9.6% Mg) @ 10-25 kg/acre.

**6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency:**
*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, often appearing as a fine network of green veins on a pale background, stunted growth.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray with **Manganese sulphate** (30.5% Mn) @ 1-2 g/L of water.
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   Apply **Manganese sulphate** (30.5% Mn) @ 5-10 kg/acre.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always ensure thorough spray coverage for foliar applications.
*   Avoid mixing incompatible chemicals.
*   Always read and strictly follow the instructions and safety precautions mentioned on the product label.
*   For severe deficiencies, repeat applications at recommended intervals may be necessary.

By carefully monitoring your radish crop and addressing these deficiencies promptly, you can ensure healthy growth and a good harvest.
