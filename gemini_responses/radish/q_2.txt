As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding rust diseases in Radish for Haryana.

It is important to clarify the specific rust diseases that affect Radish:

*   **Black Rust (Stem Rust):** This is not known to affect Radish. It primarily affects cereal crops like wheat and barley.
*   **Brown Rust (Leaf Rust):** This is not known to affect Radish. It primarily affects cereal crops like wheat and barley.
*   **Yellow Rust (Stripe Rust):** This is not known to affect Radish. It primarily affects cereal crops like wheat and barley.
*   **Red Rust:** This is not known to affect Radish. This term is often used for specific rusts on other crops and is not a common disease of Radish.
*   **White Rust:** This is a significant disease of Radish and other cruciferous crops, caused by the oomycete *Albugo candida*.

Therefore, we will focus on the control of White Rust in Radish.

### Control of White Rust (*Albugo candida*) in Radish

White rust is characterized by white, raised, blister-like pustules primarily on the underside of leaves, but can also appear on stems, petioles, and flower parts, leading to distortion and hypertrophy.

**1. Cultural and Agronomic Practices:**

*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice a rotation with non-cruciferous crops for at least 2-3 years to reduce inoculum in the soil.
*   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris immediately after harvest to prevent the pathogen from overwintering.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available, choose radish varieties known to have resistance or tolerance to white rust.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to improve air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce leaf wetness and fungal development.
*   **Weed Control:** Control cruciferous weeds (e.g., wild mustard, shepherd's purse) in and around the field, as they can act as alternate hosts for the pathogen.
*   **Irrigation Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation late in the day, as prolonged leaf wetness can promote disease development. Drip irrigation is preferable.

**2. Chemical Control (Fungicides):**

Fungicides should be applied preventively or at the first sign of disease symptoms. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions.

*   **Protectant Fungicides:**
    *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP): Apply at a rate of 2-2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Propineb** (70% WP): Apply at a rate of 2-2.5 g/L of water.
*   **Systemic and Contact Fungicides (for better efficacy against oomycetes):**
    *   **Metalaxyl** (8%) + **Mancozeb** (64%) WP: Apply at a rate of 2-2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC): Apply at a rate of 0.5-1 ml/L of water.
    *   **Dimethomorph** (50% WP): Apply at a rate of 0.5-1 g/L of water.
    *   **Cymoxanil** (8%) + **Mancozeb** (64%) WP: Apply at a rate of 2-2.5 g/L of water.

Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in the pathogen. Typically, 2-3 sprays at 7-10 day intervals may be required depending on disease severity and weather conditions.
