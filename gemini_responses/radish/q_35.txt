As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding radish maturity, harvesting, and cutting processes for cultivation in Haryana:

### Maturity Signs for Radish

Radish maturity is primarily determined by the size and firmness of the root, which varies significantly by variety. Key signs include:

*   **Root Size:** The most critical indicator. Radishes are typically ready for harvest when their roots reach the characteristic size for their variety. This can range from 2-3 cm in diameter for small, round varieties to 10-15 cm in length for longer, cylindrical types.
*   **Root Firmness:** The roots should feel firm and crisp when gently squeezed. Soft or spongy roots indicate over-maturity or poor growing conditions.
*   **Smooth Skin:** Mature radishes should have smooth, unblemished skin. Rough or cracked skin can indicate over-maturity or inconsistent watering.
*   **Leaf Development:** While leaves should be healthy and green, excessive leaf growth without corresponding root development, or the appearance of a flower stalk (bolting), indicates the plant is past its prime for root harvest.
*   **Time from Sowing:** Depending on the variety, radishes mature very quickly, typically within 20-40 days from sowing. Early varieties can be ready in as little as 18-25 days, while some winter varieties may take up to 50-60 days.

### Harvesting Time for Radish

Timely harvesting is crucial to ensure good quality, crispness, and mild flavour.

*   **Optimal Window:** Harvest radishes when they reach their optimal size and firmness, but before they become woody, pithy, or excessively pungent. Over-mature radishes tend to develop a hollow core, become fibrous, and have a very strong, undesirable flavour.
*   **Successive Harvesting:** For most varieties, harvesting can be done progressively. Begin harvesting the largest roots first, leaving smaller ones to grow. This allows for a continuous supply over a period of 1-2 weeks from a single sowing.
*   **Early Morning/Late Evening:** Harvesting during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) helps maintain turgidity and freshness, especially if they are to be stored or transported.

### Cutting Process (Harvesting Method) for Radish

The harvesting process for radishes is straightforward and aims to minimize damage to the root.

*   **Gentle Pulling:** Grasp the leaves firmly at the base, close to the soil line. Gently pull the entire plant upwards from the soil. The soil should be moist but not waterlogged to facilitate easy pulling and prevent root breakage.
*   **Shake Off Soil:** Gently shake the harvested radishes to remove excess soil clinging to the roots. Avoid harsh scrubbing, which can damage the delicate skin.
*   **Trimming Leaves (Optional but Recommended):** For market or storage, it is common to trim the leaves.
    *   Leave about 1-2 cm of the leaf stem attached to the root. This helps prevent the root from drying out and maintains freshness.
    *   Do not remove the leaves completely flush with the root, as this can create an entry point for pathogens and accelerate moisture loss.
*   **Washing and Bundling:** If intended for immediate consumption or market, radishes can be gently washed to remove remaining soil. They are often bundled together with rubber bands or twine for presentation.
