As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified seed and soil treatment processes for Radish cultivation in Haryana to ensure healthy crop establishment and mitigate early pest and disease pressure.

### Recommended Seed Treatment for Radish

Seed treatment is crucial for protecting germinating seeds and young seedlings from seed-borne and early soil-borne pathogens, particularly damping-off and seedling blight.

*   **Fungicidal Seed Treatment:**
    *   For protection against fungal diseases like damping-off and seedling blight, treat radish seeds with:
        *   **Thiram** 75% WS @ 2.5-3 grams per kilogram of seed.
        *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP @ 2 grams per kilogram of seed.
        *   *Alternatively, a combination product containing both Carbendazim and Thiram can be used as per manufacturer's recommendations.*
    *   Mix the chemical thoroughly with the seeds to ensure uniform coating before sowing.
*   **Biological Seed Treatment:**
    *   For an eco-friendly approach and enhanced disease resistance, treat seeds with a biological fungicide:
        *   **Trichoderma viride** (or *Trichoderma harzianum*) @ 4-5 grams per kilogram of seed.
    *   This can be done either alone or after chemical seed treatment (ensure a gap of a few hours if using both).

### Recommended Soil Treatment for Radish

Soil treatment aims to manage soil-borne diseases, nematodes, and insect pests that can affect radish roots and overall plant health.

*   **For Soil-borne Fungal Diseases (e.g., Damping-off, Root Rot):**
    *   **Biological Soil Application:**
        *   Incorporate **Trichoderma viride** (or *Trichoderma harzianum*) @ 2.5 kilograms per acre. Mix the bio-fungicide with 50-100 kilograms of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost, and broadcast evenly over the field before the final ploughing or sowing.
    *   **Chemical Soil Drench (if severe disease history):**
        *   If damping-off or root rot has been a persistent problem, a pre-sowing drench or soil incorporation with:
            *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride** 72.2% SL @ 2-3 ml per litre of water (for drenching around the root zone or pre-sowing soil application).
            *   **Metalaxyl** 35% WS @ 1-2 kg per acre mixed with sand or soil and broadcast, or as a drench.
*   **For Nematodes (e.g., Root-knot nematodes):**
    *   **Biological Soil Application:**
        *   Apply **Purpureocillium lilacinum** (formerly *Paecilomyces lilacinus*) @ 2.5 kilograms per acre. Mix with 50-100 kilograms of FYM/compost and incorporate into the soil before sowing.
    *   **Chemical Soil Application (if severe nematode infestation):**
        *   Incorporate **Fluensulfone** 2% GR @ 10 kilograms per acre into the soil during the final land preparation, 7-10 days before sowing.
*   **For Soil Insect Pests (e.g., Cutworms, Grubs):**
    *   **Chemical Soil Application:**
        *   Incorporate **Fipronil** 0.3% GR @ 10-15 kilograms per acre into the soil during the final land preparation before sowing. This helps in managing early soil-dwelling insect pests.

Always ensure proper soil moisture for optimal efficacy of both biological and chemical treatments. Follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions for all chemical applications.
