As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU), Hisar, I recommend the following doses of organic manures for Radish cultivation in Haryana to ensure optimal growth and soil health:

*   **Farm Yard Manure (FYM):**
    *   Apply 15-20 tonnes per acre during land preparation, at least 2-3 weeks before sowing. Ensure the FYM is well-decomposed to avoid nutrient immobilization and pest issues.
*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   Apply 4-5 tonnes per acre during land preparation, or as a top-dressing after sowing/emergence. Vermicompost provides readily available nutrients and improves soil structure.
*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract):**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Mix **Sagarika** at a rate of 2-3 ml per litre of water. Apply 2-3 sprays during the crop cycle.
        *   First spray: 15-20 days after sowing.
        *   Second spray: 15 days after the first spray.
        *   (Optional) Third spray: If needed, before root development is complete, to boost root growth and quality.
    *   **Soil Drench/Fertigation:** Apply **Sagarika** at a rate of 1-2 litres per acre, mixed with irrigation water, during early growth stages (e.g., 15-20 days after sowing).
