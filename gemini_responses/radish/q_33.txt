As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an integrated approach combining cultural, mechanical, and chemical methods for effective weed control in Radish.

**I. Cultural and Mechanical Weed Control (Essential for all weeds):**

*   **Field Preparation:** Prepare a fine, well-pulverized seedbed to ensure uniform germination of radish and facilitate easier manual weeding.
*   **Clean Seeds:** Always use certified, weed-free radish seeds to prevent the introduction of new weed species, especially parasitic ones like Amarbail.
*   **Manual Weeding/Hoeing:** This is highly effective, especially during the early stages (2-4 weeks after sowing). Timely manual removal of weeds, including parasitic ones like Amarbail and Orobanche shoots before they flower and set seeds, is crucial.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate radish with non-host crops (e.g., cereals) to reduce the weed seed bank in the soil, particularly for parasitic weeds.
*   **Solarization:** In summer, solarization of the soil can help reduce the viability of weed seeds, including those of Orobanche.

**II. Chemical Weed Control (CIBRC Approved Herbicides for Radish):**

**A. Pre-emergence Herbicides (Apply within 0-3 days after sowing):**
These herbicides are effective against germinating broadleaf and narrowleaf weeds, including Bathu, Congress grass, and Phalaris minor. They also offer some suppression against Amarbail.

*   For general broadleaf and narrowleaf weeds:
    *   **Pendimethalin** 30% EC: Apply at 1.0-1.25 kg active ingredient per acre (equivalent to 3.3-4.1 Litres of product per acre) in 200-300 Litres of water.
    *   **Oxyfluorfen** 23.5% EC: Apply at 0.2-0.25 kg active ingredient per acre (equivalent to 0.85-1.06 Litres of product per acre) in 200-300 Litres of water.

**B. Post-emergence Herbicides (Apply when weeds are at 2-4 leaf stage):**
These are primarily for narrowleaf weeds (grasses) like Phalaris minor.

*   For narrowleaf weeds (grasses):
    *   **Quizalofop-ethyl** 5% EC: Apply at 0.25-0.5 Litres of product per acre in 200-300 Litres of water.
    *   **Fluazifop-P-butyl** 13.4% EC: Apply at 0.5-0.75 Litres of product per acre in 200-300 Litres of water.

**III. Specific Weed Control Strategies:**

*   **Amarbail (Cuscuta spp.):**
    *   Pre-emergence application of **Pendimethalin** can provide some initial suppression.
    *   The most effective control is manual removal of infested radish plants along with the parasite before it flowers and sets seeds.
    *   Ensure clean seeds and avoid planting in fields with a history of Amarbail infestation.

*   **Bathu (Chenopodium album) and Congress grass (Parthenium hysterophorus):**
    *   These are broadleaf weeds effectively controlled by pre-emergence herbicides like **Pendimethalin** and **Oxyfluorfen**.
    *   Timely manual weeding is also highly effective against these weeds.
    *   There are no selective post-emergence herbicides for broadleaf weeds that are safe for radish.

*   **Orobanche (Broomrape spp.):**
    *   Orobanche is a root parasitic weed. While it can parasitize brassicas, specific chemical control measures for Orobanche *in Radish* are generally not available or recommended due to potential crop injury or lack of selective efficacy.
    *   Control relies heavily on cultural practices:
        *   Deep ploughing to bury seeds.
        *   Crop rotation with non-host crops (e.g., cereals).
        *   Timely manual removal of Orobanche shoots before they flower and set seeds is crucial to prevent future infestations.
        *   Solarization of soil in summer can reduce the seed bank.

*   **Phalaris minor (Little seed canary grass):**
    *   This narrowleaf weed can be controlled by pre-emergence application of **Pendimethalin**.
    *   Post-emergence herbicides like **Quizalofop-ethyl** or **Fluazifop-P-butyl** are highly effective against Phalaris minor.

**Important Considerations for Herbicide Application:**

*   Always read and strictly follow the label instructions of the herbicide product for correct dosage, timing, and safety precautions.
*   Ensure uniform spray coverage using appropriate spray equipment.
*   Calibrate your sprayer before application to ensure the correct dose is applied.
*   Apply herbicides when there is adequate soil moisture.
*   Avoid spraying on windy days to prevent drift.
*   Always wear personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
