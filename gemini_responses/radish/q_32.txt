नमस्ते! "Drying up" in Radish is a general symptom that can be caused by a variety of factors, both environmental and biological. As a Senior Agronomist, I advise a thorough examination of the affected plants and field conditions for accurate diagnosis.

Here are the potential causes and scientifically verified management strategies for Radish in Haryana:

---

**I. Abiotic Factors (Environmental and Cultural Practices)**

These are often the primary causes of general drying symptoms.

*   **Water Stress:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Wilting, yellowing, and eventual drying of leaves and entire plants due to either insufficient or excessive moisture. Excessive water (waterlogging) can lead to root rot, mimicking drought symptoms.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Maintain consistent soil moisture. Radish requires regular, light irrigation, especially during dry periods.
        *   Ensure proper drainage to prevent waterlogging, which suffocates roots and makes them susceptible to diseases.
        *   Use mulching to conserve soil moisture and regulate soil temperature.

*   **Nutrient Deficiencies:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Specific nutrient deficiencies can cause leaf yellowing, scorching, and drying. For example, Potassium deficiency can cause marginal leaf scorch, and Calcium deficiency can lead to tip burn.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Conduct regular soil testing to identify nutrient imbalances.
        *   Apply balanced fertilizers based on soil test recommendations.
        *   For general nutrient stress, a foliar spray of a multi-micronutrient mixture (as per manufacturer's recommendations) can provide quick relief.

*   **High Temperatures/Heat Stress:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Radish prefers cooler temperatures. High temperatures can cause wilting, scorching of leaves, and premature drying.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Ensure proper sowing time to avoid peak summer heat.
        *   Provide light, frequent irrigation during hot spells.
        *   Consider using shade nets for small-scale cultivation during extreme heat.

*   **Soil Salinity/Alkalinity:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, marginal leaf burn, wilting, and drying due to high salt concentration in the soil or irrigation water.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Get soil and water tested.
        *   Use good quality irrigation water.
        *   In saline-sodic soils, apply gypsum as per soil test recommendations, followed by leaching.

*   **Herbicide Drift:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Accidental exposure to herbicides from nearby fields can cause severe damage, including leaf distortion, yellowing, and drying.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Exercise extreme caution when applying herbicides in adjacent fields.
        *   Avoid spraying on windy days.

**II. Biotic Factors (Pests and Diseases)**

If abiotic factors are ruled out, consider these biological causes.

**A. Diseases:**

1.  **Damping-off (Caused by *Pythium* spp., *Rhizoctonia solani*):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Primarily affects seedlings, causing them to rot at the soil line and collapse, appearing "dried up."
    *   **Management:**
        *   Use certified, healthy seeds.
        *   Ensure good drainage and avoid overwatering.
        *   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds with **Thiram** at 2-3 g/kg seed or **Carbendazim** at 1-2 g/kg seed.

2.  **Alternaria Leaf Spot (Caused by *Alternaria brassicae*):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Dark brown to black spots with concentric rings appear on leaves, which can enlarge, coalesce, and lead to drying and defoliation.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Practice crop rotation with non-cruciferous crops.
        *   Remove and destroy infected plant debris.
        *   **Foliar Spray:** Apply **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L water or **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5 ml/L water at 10-15 day intervals, depending on disease severity.

3.  **Downy Mildew (Caused by *Peronospora parasitica*):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Yellowish, irregular spots on the upper surface of older leaves, with a purplish-grey fungal growth on the lower surface. Severe infection can lead to leaf drying and necrosis.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Ensure good air circulation.
        *   **Foliar Spray:** Apply **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L water or a combination product like **Metalaxyl + Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L water.

4.  **White Rust (Caused by *Albugo candida*):**
    *   **Symptoms:** White, raised pustules primarily on the underside of leaves, stems, and flower parts. Severe infection can cause distortion, hypertrophy, and drying of affected tissues.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Remove and destroy infected plant parts.
        *   **Foliar Spray:** Apply **Metalaxyl + Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L water.

5.  **Bacterial Soft Rot (Caused by *Pectobacterium carotovorum*):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Water-soaked lesions on the roots, leading to a soft, mushy rot with a foul smell. Above-ground symptoms include wilting, yellowing, and drying of foliage.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Avoid mechanical injury to roots during cultivation.
        *   Ensure good soil drainage.
        *   Practice crop rotation.
        *   No effective chemical control once established; focus on prevention.

6.  **Black Rot (Caused by *Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris*):**
    *   **Symptoms:** V-shaped yellow lesions at the leaf margins, which progress inwards. Veins within the lesions turn black. Severe infection can lead to wilting and drying of leaves.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Use disease-free, certified seeds.
        *   Practice crop rotation for at least 2-3 years.
        *   Remove and destroy infected plant debris.
        *   No highly effective chemical control once established.

**B. Pests:**

1.  **Aphids (e.g., *Brevicoryne brassicae*):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Colonies of small, soft-bodied insects on the underside of leaves and tender shoots. They suck sap, causing leaves to curl, yellow, and eventually dry up.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Encourage natural enemies like ladybugs and syrphid flies.
        *   **Foliar Spray:** Apply **Imidacloprid** at 0.25 ml/L water or **Thiamethoxam** at 0.2 g/L water.

2.  **Thrips (e.g., *Thrips tabaci*):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Cause silvery streaks or patches on leaves, which later turn brown and dry. Severe infestation can lead to stunted growth and drying of foliage.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Use blue or yellow sticky traps for monitoring and mass trapping.
        *   **Foliar Spray:** Apply **Fipronil** at 1.5 ml/L water or **Spinosad** at 0.3 ml/L water.

3.  **Root Maggots (e.g., *Delia radicum*):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Larvae feed on the roots, creating tunnels and causing damage that leads to wilting, stunting, and eventual drying of the entire plant.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Practice crop rotation.
        *   Avoid planting radish in fields where cruciferous crops were grown previously.
        *   **Soil Drench:** At the time of sowing or transplanting, apply **Chlorpyrifos** at 2 L/acre as a soil drench.

4.  **Nematodes (e.g., Root-knot nematodes, *Meloidogyne* spp.):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Cause galls or swellings on roots, impairing water and nutrient uptake. This leads to stunted growth, yellowing, wilting, and drying of the foliage, especially during hot periods.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Practice long-term crop rotation with non-host crops (e.g., cereals).
        *   Use resistant varieties if available.
        *   Soil solarization during summer can reduce nematode populations.
        *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Carbofuran** (3% Granules) at 10 kg/acre at the time of sowing, mixed well into the soil.

**General Recommendations for Integrated Management:**

*   **Field Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your radish crop for early signs of stress, pests, or diseases.
*   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy all infected plant debris to reduce inoculum sources.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Implement a robust crop rotation plan to break pest and disease cycles.
*   **Certified Seeds:** Always use certified, disease-free seeds from reputable sources.
*   **Soil Health:** Maintain good soil health through organic matter addition and proper tillage.

For an accurate diagnosis and specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions, it is always advisable to consult with the experts at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU) or your local Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK).
