As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the use of growth regulators and hormones in Radish cultivation in Haryana:

It is important to note that the primary goal of radish cultivation is the development of a healthy, marketable root. The use of growth regulators must be carefully considered to avoid adverse effects on root quality and safety.

1.  **Ethephon (Ethrel):**
    *   This is not known to be recommended as a growth regulator for enhancing root development or yield in Radish in Haryana. Ethephon is primarily used for fruit ripening, flowering regulation, or abscission in other crops. Its application to radish for root production is not a standard practice and could potentially lead to undesirable effects such as premature bolting or phytotoxicity.

2.  **2,4-D:**
    *   This is not known to be recommended as a growth regulator for Radish. **2,4-D** is primarily a selective herbicide. While auxins can act as growth regulators at extremely low concentrations, **2,4-D** has a very narrow margin between growth promotion and herbicidal action. Applying **2,4-D** to an edible root crop like Radish as a growth regulator is highly risky, potentially causing severe phytotoxicity, malformation of roots, and residue concerns. It is not a recommended practice for Radish cultivation in Haryana.

3.  **Boron:**
    *   Boron is an essential micronutrient for Radish, crucial for cell wall formation, sugar transport, and root development. Deficiency can lead to internal browning, hollow heart, or poor root development. Its application is recommended *only if soil tests indicate a deficiency*.
    *   **Recommended Dose (Foliar Application):**
        *   Spray 1-2 g of **Disodium tetraborate decahydrate** (Borax, 10.5-11.3% Boron) per litre of water (0.1-0.2% solution).
        *   Alternatively, use 0.6-1.2 g of **Boric acid** (17% Boron) per litre of water.
        *   Apply as a foliar spray at the 2-4 leaf stage or when deficiency symptoms first appear. Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.
    *   **Recommended Dose (Soil Application):**
        *   If soil tests indicate severe Boron deficiency, apply 1-2 kg of **Disodium tetraborate decahydrate** per acre, mixed with basal fertilizers at the time of sowing. This should be done *only* based on a soil test report.
    *   **Important Note:** Over-application of Boron can be toxic to plants. Always conduct a soil test to determine the actual need before applying Boron.
