As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following cultivation practices for Radish in Haryana:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   Radish is primarily direct-seeded.
    *   **Line sowing** is highly recommended over broadcasting for better crop management, uniform root development, and ease of intercultural operations like weeding and thinning.
    *   Seeds can be sown on flatbeds in rows or on the sides of shallow ridges, especially in heavier soils or where drainage might be an issue.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   Seeds should be sown at a shallow depth of **1-2 cm**. Deeper sowing can lead to poor germination and delayed emergence.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   **Row-to-row spacing:** Maintain a distance of **20-30 cm** between rows.
    *   **Plant-to-plant spacing:** After germination, thin the seedlings to achieve a plant-to-plant spacing of **5-10 cm** within the row. This ensures adequate space for proper root development and prevents overcrowding.

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   The recommended seed dose for Radish is typically **8-12 kg/acre**, depending on the variety, seed size, and desired plant stand.
