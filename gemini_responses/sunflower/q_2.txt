As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice regarding rust diseases in Sunflower for Haryana.

Regarding your query about Black, Brown, Yellow, White, and Red rusts in Sunflower:

*   **Black Rust, Yellow Rust, White Rust, and Red Rust:** These specific rust diseases are not known to affect Sunflower.
*   The primary rust disease affecting sunflower is caused by *Puccinia helianthi*, commonly referred to as **Sunflower Rust** or **Brown Rust of Sunflower**. This is the disease we need to focus on for control measures.

Here's how to control Sunflower Rust (*Puccinia helianthi*):

**I. Cultural and Agronomic Practices:**

1.  **Resistant Varieties:** Plant rust-resistant or tolerant sunflower varieties recommended for Haryana's agro-climatic conditions. Always consult HAU's latest recommendations for specific varieties.
2.  **Crop Rotation:** Implement a 2-3 year crop rotation with non-host crops (e.g., cereals, pulses) to break the disease cycle. Avoid planting sunflower in the same field consecutively.
3.  **Sanitation:** After harvest, remove and destroy all infected plant debris to reduce the inoculum for the subsequent season. Also, remove any volunteer sunflower plants that may serve as a host for the rust pathogen.
4.  **Proper Spacing:** Maintain optimal plant spacing to ensure good air circulation within the crop canopy. This helps reduce humidity, which is conducive to rust development.
5.  **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced fertilization. Avoid excessive nitrogen application, as it can promote lush, succulent growth that is more susceptible to rust infection.

**II. Chemical Control (Fungicides):**

Fungicides should be applied preventively or at the very early stages of disease development (when the first rust pustules are observed) for effective control. Repeat applications may be necessary depending on disease pressure and prevailing weather conditions. Always read and follow the label instructions carefully.

CIBRC approved technical chemical names for rust control in sunflower include:

*   **Propiconazole** (25% EC): Apply at 200 ml per acre in 200 litres of water (0.1% solution).
*   **Difenoconazole** (25% EC): Apply at 100 ml per acre in 200 litres of water (0.05% solution).
*   **Tebuconazole** (25% EC): Apply at 200 ml per acre in 200 litres of water (0.1% solution).
*   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC): Apply at 200 ml per acre in 200 litres of water (0.1% solution).

For the most current and specific recommendations tailored to your local conditions and the latest approved products, it is always advisable to consult your nearest Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or the Department of Plant Pathology at HAU, Hisar.
