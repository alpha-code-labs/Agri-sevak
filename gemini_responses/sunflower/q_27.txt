As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the suitable climate, soil type, and drainage requirements for Sunflower cultivation in Haryana:

**Climate:**
*   **Temperature:** Sunflower is a warm-season crop.
    *   Optimal temperature for germination: 18-25°C.
    *   Optimal temperature for vegetative growth: 20-28°C.
    *   Optimal temperature for flowering and seed filling: 25-30°C. Temperatures exceeding 35°C during flowering can negatively impact seed set and oil content.
*   **Sunshine:** Requires 6-8 hours of bright sunshine daily for optimal growth, head development, and oil production.
*   **Frost:** Highly susceptible to frost at all growth stages, especially during flowering. Planting schedules in Haryana must avoid periods of frost.
*   **Rainfall:** While somewhat drought-tolerant due to its deep root system, a well-distributed rainfall of 300-500 mm during the growing season is beneficial. Supplemental irrigation is crucial in regions with insufficient or erratic rainfall.

**Soil Type:**
*   **Adaptability:** Sunflower is adaptable to a wide range of soil types.
*   **Preferred Soils:** Deep, fertile, well-drained loamy to sandy-loam soils are ideal for optimal growth and yield.
*   **Soil pH:** Thrives best in soils with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.5, though it can tolerate slightly acidic to slightly alkaline conditions.
*   **Avoid:** Heavy clay soils with poor drainage, highly saline, or highly alkaline soils are not suitable as they impede root development and nutrient uptake. Very light sandy soils may require more intensive water and nutrient management.

**Drainage Requirement:**
*   **Critical Need:** Excellent soil drainage is absolutely critical for sunflower cultivation.
*   **Waterlogging Sensitivity:** Sunflower is highly sensitive to waterlogging, particularly during its early growth stages and flowering. Waterlogged conditions can lead to root rot, nutrient deficiencies, and significant yield losses.
*   **Internal Drainage:** Soils with good internal drainage are essential to prevent water accumulation around the root zone, ensuring healthy root development and plant vigor.
