As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following for the application of organic manures and bio-stimulants in Sunflower cultivation in Haryana:

*   **Farmyard Manure (FYM):**
    *   Apply **10-15 tonnes per acre** (equivalent to 25-37.5 tonnes per hectare) during land preparation, at least 2-3 weeks before sowing. Ensure the FYM is well-decomposed to avoid nutrient immobilization and weed issues.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   Apply **2-3 tonnes per acre** (equivalent to 5-7.5 tonnes per hectare) during land preparation, or as a basal application at the time of sowing.

*   **Sagarika:**
    *   **Sagarika** is a seaweed extract-based bio-stimulant, not a bulk organic manure like FYM or vermicompost. It is used to enhance plant growth, nutrient uptake, and stress tolerance.
    *   **Foliar Application:** Apply **2-3 ml per litre of water** (e.g., 400-600 ml per acre in 200 litres of water) at critical growth stages, such as 30-40 days after sowing and again at the pre-flowering stage.
    *   **Soil Drenching/Fertigation:** Apply **1-2 litres per acre** mixed with irrigation water, particularly during early vegetative growth.
