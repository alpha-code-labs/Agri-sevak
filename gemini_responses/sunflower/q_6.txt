As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling viral diseases in Sunflower in Haryana.

Firstly, regarding your list:
*   **Tristeza:** This is not known to affect Sunflower. Citrus Tristeza Virus (CTV) primarily affects citrus species.

For other viral diseases such as Leaf curl, Mosaic, Yellow vein clearing, Stripe, and Stunt virus in Sunflower, it is crucial to understand that there are no direct chemical cures for viral infections once a plant is infected. Control strategies primarily focus on preventing infection by managing the vectors (insects that transmit the viruses), using resistant varieties, and implementing good cultural practices.

Here are the recommended control measures:

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Use Certified Seeds:** Always use healthy, certified seeds from reputable sources to avoid seed-borne viruses.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available, plant sunflower varieties known to be resistant or tolerant to common viral diseases in your region. Consult with HAU for the latest recommendations on suitable varieties for Haryana.
*   **Timely Sowing:** Adhere to recommended sowing dates to avoid peak vector populations.
*   **Weed Management:** Keep fields and surrounding areas free of weeds, as many weeds can act as alternate hosts for both viruses and their insect vectors.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops to break the disease cycle.
*   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plants promptly to prevent the spread of the virus to healthy plants. This includes uprooting and burning or deep burying.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure balanced fertilization to promote vigorous plant growth, which can help plants tolerate stress, though it won't prevent viral infection.

**2. Vector Management (Insect Control):**
Since most viral diseases in sunflower are transmitted by insect vectors like whiteflies, aphids, and thrips, controlling these pests is paramount.
*   **Seed Treatment:**
    *   Treat seeds with a systemic insecticide before sowing to provide early protection against sucking pests.
    *   **Imidacloprid** 70 WS at 5-7 g/kg seed.
    *   **Thiamethoxam** 70 WS at 4.2 g/kg seed.
*   **Foliar Sprays (if vector population is high):**
    *   Monitor fields regularly for the presence of insect vectors. If populations exceed economic threshold levels, apply appropriate insecticides.
    *   **For Whiteflies (major vector for Leaf Curl and Yellow Vein Clearing):**
        *   **Buprofezin** 25 SC at 1.25 L/ha (for nymphs).
        *   **Acetamiprid** 20 SP at 100-125 g/ha.
        *   **Flonicamid** 50 WG at 150 g/ha.
    *   **For Aphids (major vector for Mosaic and Stunt viruses):**
        *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8 SL at 125 ml/ha.
        *   **Thiamethoxam** 25 WG at 100 g/ha.
        *   **Acetamiprid** 20 SP at 100-125 g/ha.
    *   **For Thrips (can transmit some viruses):**
        *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8 SL at 125 ml/ha.
        *   **Fipronil** 5 SC at 1.0-1.5 L/ha.
*   **Neem-based formulations:** As an initial step or in conjunction with chemical sprays, neem oil formulations can act as repellents and antifeedants against sucking pests.

**3. Integrated Pest Management (IPM):**
*   Combine all the above strategies for effective and sustainable management. This includes regular scouting, judicious use of pesticides, and promoting natural enemies of pests.

Always consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for the most current recommendations specific to your farm and the prevailing disease situation in Haryana.
