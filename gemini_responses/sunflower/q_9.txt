Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, I understand the challenges posed by mite infestations in Sunflower. Both Red spider mite (Tetranychus urticae) and Rust mite (Aceria helianthi) can cause significant damage, leading to yield losses if not managed effectively. Here's a scientifically verified approach for their control in Haryana:

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategy for Mites in Sunflower:**

A comprehensive approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods is recommended for sustainable and effective mite control.

**1. Cultural Control Measures:**

*   **Weed Management:** Regularly remove weeds from the field and surrounding areas, as many weeds act as alternate hosts for mites.
*   **Proper Irrigation:** Mites thrive in hot, dry conditions. Maintaining adequate soil moisture through proper irrigation can help reduce mite populations. Avoid water stress in plants.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation to break the pest cycle and reduce the build-up of mite populations in the soil.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy crop residues after harvest to eliminate overwintering sites for mites.

**2. Biological Control:**

*   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Encourage the presence of natural predators such as predatory mites (e.g., Amblyseius spp.), ladybird beetles, lacewings, and minute pirate bugs, which feed on pest mites. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

**3. Chemical Control (Acaricides):**

When mite populations reach economic threshold levels, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always ensure thorough coverage, especially on the underside of leaves where mites primarily reside. Rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

Here are some CIBRC approved technical chemical names effective against mites, along with their recommended dosages:

*   **For Red Spider Mite and Rust Mite:**
    *   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** Apply at 125 ml per acre in 200-400 litres of water.
    *   **Propargite 57% EC:** Apply at 1.0 - 1.5 litres per acre in 200-400 litres of water.
    *   **Fenpyroximate 5% SC:** Apply at 200-300 ml per acre in 200-400 litres of water.
    *   **Abamectin 1.9% EC:** Apply at 200-250 ml per acre in 200-400 litres of water.
    *   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP:** Apply at 2.0 - 3.0 kg per acre in 200-400 litres of water. This is particularly effective against rust mites and also helps in managing powdery mildew.

**Important Application Guidelines:**

*   **Timing:** Spray during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to maximize efficacy and minimize drift.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure complete and uniform coverage of the plant foliage, especially the undersides of leaves, as mites are often found there.
*   **Water Volume:** Use sufficient water volume (200-400 litres per acre, depending on crop canopy) to ensure good spray coverage.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate different classes of acaricides to prevent mites from developing resistance to a particular chemical. Do not use the same chemical repeatedly.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, and protective clothing while handling and spraying chemicals. Follow all instructions and safety precautions mentioned on the product label.
*   **Re-evaluation:** Monitor the field regularly after application and re-apply if necessary, adhering to the recommended re-entry and pre-harvest intervals.

By implementing these measures, you can effectively manage mite infestations in your Sunflower crop and safeguard your yield. For any further specific queries, please consult your local agricultural extension officer.
