As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified seed and soil treatment processes for Sunflower cultivation in Haryana, focusing on common challenges and CIBRC-approved solutions:

### Recommended Seed Treatment for Sunflower

Seed treatment is crucial for protecting young seedlings from early-season pests and diseases, ensuring better germination and stand establishment.

1.  **Fungicidal Treatment (for Downy Mildew and other seed-borne fungi):**
    *   For effective control of Downy Mildew, a major threat to sunflower, treat seeds with:
        *   **Metalaxyl** 35% WS @ 6 grams per kg of seed.
        *   *Alternatively, if available and recommended for specific local strains:* **Metalaxyl-M** (Mefenoxam) 31.8% ES @ 3-4 ml per kg of seed.
    *   For broad-spectrum protection against other seed-borne diseases like damping-off and seedling blight, you may also consider:
        *   **Carbendazim** 12% + **Mancozeb** 63% WP @ 2.5 grams per kg of seed.

2.  **Insecticidal Treatment (for early sucking pests and soil insects):**
    *   To protect against early-season sucking pests like thrips, aphids, and early shoot fly, as well as some soil insects:
        *   **Imidacloprid** 600 FS @ 5-7 ml per kg of seed.
        *   *Alternatively:* **Thiamethoxam** 30% FS @ 10 ml per kg of seed.

3.  **Bio-agent Treatment (for disease suppression and nutrient mobilization):**
    *   After chemical treatments (allow seeds to dry slightly between applications), apply bio-agents:
        *   **Trichoderma viride** 1% WP @ 5-10 grams per kg of seed. This helps in suppressing soil-borne fungal diseases.
        *   **Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria (PSB)** @ 5-10 grams per kg of seed. This aids in better phosphorus uptake by the plant.

**Application Order:** Apply fungicide first, then insecticide, and finally bio-agents. Ensure seeds are thoroughly coated and allowed to dry in shade before sowing.

### Recommended Soil Treatment for Sunflower

Soil treatment aims to manage soil-borne pests and diseases, and improve overall soil health for optimal plant growth.

1.  **For Termites and White Grubs (if prevalent in your field):**
    *   Apply at the time of field preparation or sowing:
        *   **Fipronil** 0.3% GR @ 10-15 kg per acre, broadcast evenly and incorporated into the soil.
        *   *Alternatively, for drenching or mixing with irrigation:* **Fipronil** 5% SC @ 400-600 ml per acre, mixed with sufficient water.

2.  **For Soil-borne Diseases (e.g., Sclerotinia rot, Charcoal rot, general root rots):**
    *   Incorporate into the soil during field preparation, preferably 7-10 days before sowing:
        *   **Trichoderma viride** 1% WP @ 2-4 kg per acre, mixed with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost. This helps in biological control of various soil-borne pathogens.
        *   *Alternatively or in addition:* **Pseudomonas fluorescens** 1% WP @ 2-4 kg per acre, also mixed with FYM/compost.

3.  **General Soil Health and Nutrient Management:**
    *   While not a "treatment" in the chemical sense, incorporating organic matter is vital for soil health:
        *   Apply 8-10 tonnes per acre of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost during field preparation. This improves soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability.
    *   Conduct a soil test to determine specific nutrient deficiencies and apply fertilizers accordingly.

Always follow the instructions on the product label for precise dosage and application methods, and ensure proper safety measures are taken during handling and application of all chemicals.
