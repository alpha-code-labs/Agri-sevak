As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding Growth Regulators/Hormones for Sunflower cultivation in Haryana:

1.  **Ethephon (Ethrel)**
    *   While **Ethephon** can be used for specific purposes in sunflower (e.g., male sterility induction in hybrid seed production), it is **not generally recommended as a growth regulator or hormone for routine yield enhancement in commercial sunflower cultivation in Haryana.** Its application for general growth regulation is not a standard practice endorsed by HAU for this crop.

2.  **2,4-D**
    *   **2,4-D** is primarily a broadleaf herbicide. Applying it to sunflower, which is also a broadleaf plant, even at very low concentrations, carries a significant risk of phytotoxicity and damage.
    *   Therefore, **2,4-D is not recommended for use as a growth regulator or hormone in sunflower cultivation in Haryana** due to its herbicidal nature and potential to cause severe damage to the crop.

3.  **Boron**
    *   Boron is a crucial micronutrient for sunflower, essential for pollen viability, fertilization, and proper seed set. Its deficiency can lead to poor seed filling and hollow seeds. Foliar application is highly recommended.
    *   **Recommended Dose and Application:**
        *   **Chemical Name:** **Borax (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate)** (containing approximately 10.5-11% Boron)
        *   **Dose:** Prepare a 0.1% to 0.2% solution of **Borax**.
            *   This translates to **1 kg to 2 kg of Borax per 500-1000 litres of water per acre** (or **1 g to 2 g of Borax per litre of water**).
        *   **Timing:**
            *   **First spray:** At the bud initiation stage (when flower buds start to appear).
            *   **Second spray:** At the flowering stage (when 50% of the plants are in bloom).
        *   **Method:** Ensure thorough foliar coverage.
