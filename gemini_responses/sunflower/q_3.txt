Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I understand your concern regarding various rot types in Sunflower. Effective management requires an Integrated Disease Management (IDM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods.

Let's address the various rot types you've mentioned, focusing on those relevant to Sunflower cultivation in Haryana.

**General Preventative Measures (Cultural Practices) for Rot Management:**

These practices are fundamental for reducing the incidence and severity of most rot diseases:

*   **Crop Rotation:** Implement a 2-3 year rotation with non-host crops like cereals (wheat, maize) to break the disease cycle and reduce soil-borne inoculum. Avoid continuous sunflower cultivation or rotation with other susceptible crops like groundnut, soybean, or mustard.
*   **Resistant/Tolerant Varieties:** Where available, choose sunflower varieties known to have resistance or tolerance to common rot pathogens in your region.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest. This reduces the overwintering inoculum of many pathogens.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure balanced fertilization. Excessive nitrogen can lead to lush growth, making plants more susceptible, while potassium deficiency can weaken plant tissues.
*   **Proper Irrigation:** Avoid waterlogging, especially during critical growth stages. Use furrow irrigation or drip irrigation to keep the base of the plants dry. Irrigate in the morning to allow foliage to dry quickly.
*   **Optimum Plant Spacing:** Maintain recommended plant spacing to ensure good air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce humidity and fungal growth.
*   **Deep Ploughing/Summer Ploughing:** Deep ploughing during summer can expose sclerotia and other fungal resting structures to sunlight, reducing their viability.

**Specific Rot Types and Their Control in Sunflower:**

**1. Seed Rot and Seedling Rot (Damping-off)**
*   **Pathogens:** Primarily *Rhizoctonia solani*, *Pythium spp.*, *Fusarium spp.*, and sometimes *Sclerotium rolfsii*.
*   **Symptoms:** Seeds fail to germinate or rot in the soil. Seedlings emerge but collapse at the soil line (post-emergence damping-off) or rot before emergence (pre-emergence damping-off).
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Cultural:** Use healthy, certified seeds. Ensure good seedbed preparation and optimal soil moisture for quick germination. Avoid sowing in cold, wet soils.
    *   **Chemical (Seed Treatment):** This is the most critical step for controlling seed and seedling rots.
        *   **Carboxin 37.5% + Thiram 37.5% WS** at 2.5-3.0 g/kg seed.
        *   **Metalaxyl 35% WS** at 6 g/kg seed (especially effective against *Pythium spp.*).
        *   **Tebuconazole 2% DS** at 2.5 g/kg seed.
        *   **Fludioxonil 2.5% FS + Metalaxyl-M 1.0% FS** at 1-2 ml/kg seed.

**2. Root, Stem, Foot, Collar, Crown, and Neck Rots (e.g., Charcoal Rot, Southern Blight, White Mold)**
These terms often describe symptoms caused by a few key soil-borne pathogens affecting the lower parts of the plant.

*   **a) Charcoal Rot (Dry Root Rot)**
    *   **Pathogen:** *Macrophomina phaseolina*.
    *   **Symptoms:** Wilting and premature drying of plants, especially under moisture stress. Darkening of roots and stem base, with numerous tiny black sclerotia (microsclerotia) visible under the bark.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   **Cultural:** Maintain adequate soil moisture, especially during flowering and seed development. Crop rotation.
        *   **Chemical (Soil Drench/Foliar):**
            *   **Carbendazim 50% WP** at 1.0-1.5 g/L water as a soil drench around the plant base.
            *   **Tebuconazole 25.9% EC** at 1.0 ml/L water as a soil drench.

*   **b) Southern Blight / Stem Rot / Collar Rot**
    *   **Pathogen:** *Sclerotium rolfsii*.
    *   **Symptoms:** Wilting of plants, yellowing of leaves, and rotting at the collar region (soil line). A white, fan-like mycelial growth may be visible at the base of the stem, often with small, mustard-seed-like sclerotia (initially white, turning brown).
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   **Cultural:** Deep ploughing to bury sclerotia. Avoid excessive moisture at the plant base.
        *   **Chemical (Soil Drench):**
            *   **Validamycin 3% L** at 2.0-2.5 ml/L water as a soil drench around the plant base.
            *   **Pencycuron 23% SC** at 1.0 ml/L water as a soil drench.
            *   **Carbendazim 50% WP** at 1.0-1.5 g/L water as a soil drench.

*   **c) White Mold / Sclerotinia Stem Rot / Head Rot**
    *   **Pathogen:** *Sclerotinia sclerotiorum*.
    *   **Symptoms:** Water-soaked lesions on stems, leaves, or heads, which later turn soft and rotten, covered with white cottony fungal growth. Large, black, irregular sclerotia (rat droppings-like) form within the rotten tissues. Can cause root, stem, and head rot.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   **Cultural:** Crop rotation with non-host crops (cereals). Deep ploughing to bury sclerotia. Avoid dense planting.
        *   **Chemical (Foliar Spray/Soil Drench):**
            *   **Boscalid 50% WG** at 1.0-1.5 g/L water (foliar spray, especially at early flowering).
            *   **Tebuconazole 25.9% EC** at 1.0 ml/L water (foliar spray).
            *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC** at 0.5-1.0 ml/L water (foliar spray).

**3. Black Stem (often referred to as Black Rot)**
*   **Pathogen:** *Phoma macdonaldii*.
*   **Symptoms:** Dark brown to black lesions on the stem, often starting at the nodes or leaf axils, which can girdle the stem and cause wilting. Small black pycnidia may be visible on the lesions.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Cultural:** Crop rotation. Use disease-free seeds. Remove and destroy infected plant debris.
    *   **Chemical (Foliar Spray):**
        *   **Propiconazole 25% EC** at 1.0 ml/L water.
        *   **Hexaconazole 5% SC** at 1.0 ml/L water.
        *   **Tebuconazole 25.9% EC** at 1.0 ml/L water.

**4. Head Rot (Addressing "Fruit Rot")**
*   **Note:** "Fruit rot" is not a standard term for sunflower, as the edible part is an achene (often called a seed), not a botanical fruit in the typical sense. The term **Head Rot** is appropriate for the rotting of the sunflower head.
*   **Pathogens:** Primarily *Sclerotinia sclerotiorum* (as mentioned above), and *Rhizopus spp.* (Rhizopus Head Rot).
*   **Symptoms:**
    *   **Sclerotinia Head Rot:** Water-soaked lesions on the back of the head, turning soft and rotten, with white mycelial growth and black sclerotia.
    *   **Rhizopus Head Rot:** Soft, watery rot of the head, often starting from wounds (e.g., bird damage). The head becomes covered with a coarse, dark greyish-black fungal growth.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Cultural:** Manage bird damage. Avoid mechanical injury to heads. Maintain proper plant spacing.
    *   **Chemical (Foliar Spray):**
        *   For *Sclerotinia* head rot, fungicides mentioned under Sclerotinia Stem Rot (e.g., **Boscalid 50% WG**, **Tebuconazole 25.9% EC**) can be applied at early flowering to protect the heads.
        *   For *Rhizopus* head rot, fungicides are generally less effective once the rot is established. Prevention of injury is key.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the label instructions for any chemical product, including dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in pathogens.
*   Consult your local agricultural extension officer at HAU for the most current and specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and the prevailing disease pressure in Haryana.

By implementing these scientifically verified strategies, you can effectively manage rot diseases in your sunflower crop.
