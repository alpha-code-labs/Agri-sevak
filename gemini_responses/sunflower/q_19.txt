Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the critical role of balanced nutrition for optimal Sunflower yield and quality. Macro-nutrient deficiencies, particularly Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K), can severely impact your crop. Here's how to address them scientifically:

It is highly recommended to conduct a soil test before sowing to determine the exact nutrient status of your field. This allows for precise and efficient fertilizer application, preventing both deficiencies and wasteful excess.

### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

Nitrogen is crucial for vegetative growth, chlorophyll formation, and overall plant vigor.

*   **Symptoms:**
    *   General yellowing (chlorosis) of older leaves, starting from the tips and margins, progressing inwards.
    *   Stunted plant growth with thin stems.
    *   Reduced leaf size and fewer leaves.
    *   Premature senescence (aging) of leaves.

*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Soil Application (for established deficiency or as top-dressing):**
        *   Apply 25-30 kg N per acre as a top-dressing, split into two applications if the deficiency is severe or persistent.
        *   Use **Urea** at 55-65 kg/acre.
        *   Alternatively, if Phosphorus is also needed, **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)** can be used, but its N content is lower (18% N).
        *   Ensure irrigation after application for better nutrient uptake.
    *   **Foliar Application (for quick recovery):**
        *   Spray a 2% solution of **Urea** (20 g/L water) on the foliage.
        *   Repeat after 7-10 days if symptoms persist. Apply during cooler parts of the day (morning or late afternoon).

### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

Phosphorus is vital for root development, flowering, seed formation, and energy transfer within the plant.

*   **Symptoms:**
    *   Stunted growth, particularly root development.
    *   Dark green or purplish discoloration of older leaves, especially on the undersides.
    *   Delayed flowering and maturity.
    *   Poor seed set and small, shriveled seeds.

*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Soil Application (primarily basal, but can be applied if deficiency is identified early):**
        *   Phosphorus is less mobile in the soil, so basal application is most effective. If deficiency is observed post-sowing, apply and incorporate lightly.
        *   Apply 40-60 kg P2O5 per acre.
        *   Use **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)** at 85-130 kg/acre (this also provides some N).
        *   Alternatively, **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** at 250-375 kg/acre.
        *   **Monoammonium Phosphate (MAP)** at 75-115 kg/acre (also provides some N).
    *   **Foliar Application (for temporary relief and quick boost):**
        *   Spray a 1-2% solution of water-soluble **Monoammonium Phosphate (MAP)** (10-20 g/L water).
        *   Repeat after 10-15 days if necessary.

### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency

Potassium plays a crucial role in water regulation, disease resistance, enzyme activation, and overall plant strength.

*   **Symptoms:**
    *   Yellowing and browning (scorching) of leaf margins and tips, especially on older leaves.
    *   Leaves may appear wilted or flaccid.
    *   Weak stems, leading to lodging.
    *   Poor seed filling and reduced oil content in seeds.
    *   Increased susceptibility to diseases.

*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Soil Application (basal or top-dressing):**
        *   Apply 30-40 kg K2O per acre.
        *   Use **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** (Potassium Chloride) at 50-65 kg/acre.
        *   Alternatively, **Sulphate of Potash (SOP)** (Potassium Sulphate) at 60-80 kg/acre, especially beneficial in sulfur-deficient soils.
        *   Ensure good soil moisture for effective uptake.
    *   **Foliar Application (for quick correction):**
        *   Spray a 1-2% solution of **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** or **Sulphate of Potash (SOP)** (10-20 g/L water).
        *   Repeat after 7-10 days if symptoms persist.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Soil Testing:** Always prioritize soil testing to get precise recommendations for your specific field.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management (INM):** Combine chemical fertilizers with organic manures (Farm Yard Manure, compost) for long-term soil health and nutrient availability.
*   **Timing:** Apply fertilizers at appropriate growth stages for maximum efficiency.
*   **Watering:** Always ensure adequate soil moisture after soil application of fertilizers for proper dissolution and uptake.
*   **Consultation:** For specific field conditions, always consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts.

By following these scientifically verified recommendations, you can effectively manage macro-nutrient deficiencies in your Sunflower crop and ensure a healthy, productive harvest.
