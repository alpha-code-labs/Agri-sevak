As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified practices to improve yield, fruit quality, and storage life for Sunflower in Haryana:

### I. Improving Yield

Yield improvement in Sunflower is a result of optimal agronomic practices, balanced nutrition, and effective pest and disease management.

1.  **Variety Selection:**
    *   Choose high-yielding, disease-resistant hybrid varieties specifically recommended for cultivation in Haryana. Consult HAU recommendations for the latest suitable hybrids.

2.  **Optimal Sowing Time and Spacing:**
    *   **Spring Season:** Mid-January to Mid-February.
    *   **Kharif Season:** Mid-July to Mid-August.
    *   **Spacing:** Maintain a row-to-row distance of 60 cm and plant-to-plant distance of 30 cm for optimal plant population and light interception.

3.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Nitrogen (N):** Apply 60-80 kg N/acre. Apply half at sowing and the remaining half at the flowering stage.
    *   **Phosphorus (P2O5):** Apply 40-60 kg P2O5/acre as basal at the time of sowing.
    *   **Potassium (K2O):** Apply 40 kg K2O/acre as basal at sowing, especially if soil test indicates deficiency.
    *   **Sulphur (S):** Apply 20 kg S/acre as basal at sowing, as it is crucial for oil synthesis.
    *   **Boron (B):** Critical for pollen viability, seed set, and filling. Foliar spray of **Disodium tetraborate decahydrate** (Borax) @ 1.5-2 g/L water at the pre-flowering stage and again at 50% flowering.
    *   **Zinc (Zn):** Important for overall plant growth and enzyme activity. Foliar spray of **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** @ 0.5% (5 g/L water) at 30-40 days after sowing.

4.  **Water Management:**
    *   Sunflower is sensitive to water stress, especially during critical growth stages. Provide irrigation during dry spells at:
        *   Bud initiation stage
        *   Flowering stage
        *   Seed filling stage

5.  **Weed Management:**
    *   **Pre-emergence:** Apply **Pendimethalin** @ 1.0 kg a.i./acre (approx. 3.3 L of 30% EC) within 3 days of sowing.
    *   **Post-emergence (for grassy weeds):** Apply **Quizalofop-p-ethyl** @ 400-550 ml of 5% EC per acre at 20-25 days after sowing.

6.  **Pest Management (Impacting Yield):**
    *   **Head Borer (Helicoverpa armigera):**
        *   At head formation stage, spray **Chlorantraniliprole** @ 0.4 ml/L water or **Emamectin benzoate** @ 0.2 g/L water.
    *   **Aphids:**
        *   Spray **Imidacloprid** @ 0.25 ml/L water upon infestation.

7.  **Disease Management (Impacting Yield):**
    *   **Rust (Puccinia helianthi):**
        *   At the first appearance of symptoms, spray **Propiconazole** @ 1 ml/L water or **Azoxystrobin** @ 1 ml/L water.
    *   **Alternaria Blight (Alternaria helianthi):**
        *   Spray **Mancozeb** @ 2.5 g/L water or **Azoxystrobin** @ 1 ml/L water at the onset of symptoms.

### II. Improving Fruit Quality (Achene Quality)

Fruit quality in Sunflower primarily refers to the oil content, seed filling, and overall health of the achenes (seeds).

1.  **Effective Pollination:**
    *   Sunflower is largely cross-pollinated. Ensure adequate pollination by introducing 4-5 honeybee colonies per acre during the flowering period. This significantly improves seed set and filling.

2.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Boron:** As mentioned for yield, Boron is crucial for pollen viability and successful fertilization, directly impacting seed set and quality. Ensure timely foliar application of **Disodium tetraborate decahydrate** (Borax) @ 1.5-2 g/L water.
    *   **Potassium:** Adequate Potassium supply is linked to improved oil content and seed development. Ensure sufficient K levels in the soil based on soil testing.

3.  **Pest and Disease Control:**
    *   Effective control of pests like head borer prevents direct damage to developing seeds.
    *   Management of foliar diseases (Rust, Alternaria Blight) ensures healthy leaves, which are vital for photosynthesis and nutrient translocation to the developing seeds, thus improving oil content and seed weight.

4.  **Timely Harvesting:**
    *   Harvest when the back of the head turns yellow, bracts dry, and the moisture content of seeds is around 18-20%. Premature harvesting leads to immature seeds with lower oil content, while delayed harvesting can result in shattering and bird damage, reducing quality.

### III. Improving Storage Life

Proper post-harvest handling and storage are crucial to maintain seed quality and extend storage life.

1.  **Timely and Careful Harvesting:**
    *   Harvest at physiological maturity (18-20% moisture content). Avoid mechanical damage to seeds during harvesting, as damaged seeds are more susceptible to pest and fungal attack.

2.  **Thorough Drying:**
    *   This is the most critical step. Reduce the moisture content of the seeds to 8-10% for safe storage. This can be achieved by sun-drying on clean tarpaulins or using mechanical dryers. Ensure uniform drying to prevent localized spoilage.

3.  **Cleaning and Grading:**
    *   Thoroughly clean the harvested seeds to remove chaff, broken seeds, weed seeds, and other foreign matter. This reduces the potential for pest infestation and fungal growth during storage. Grade seeds to ensure uniformity.

4.  **Optimal Storage Conditions:**
    *   Store seeds in clean, dry, well-ventilated, and cool storage structures.
    *   Use moisture-proof bags (e.g., jute bags lined with polyethylene) or airtight containers.
    *   Elevate bags on wooden pallets to prevent moisture absorption from the floor and allow for air circulation.
    *   Maintain good sanitation in the storage area.

5.  **Pest Management in Storage:**
    *   **Fumigation:** For large-scale storage, fumigate with **Aluminium phosphide** tablets @ 1-2 tablets (3g each) per tonne of seeds for 5-7 days in an airtight condition. Ensure strict safety protocols are followed during fumigation.
    *   **Sanitation:** Thoroughly clean storage premises before storing new produce. Remove all old grain residues, which can harbor pests.
    *   **Regular Inspection:** Periodically inspect stored seeds for any signs of insect infestation or fungal growth.
    *   **Surface Treatment:** The inner walls of the godown and outer surface of bags (not directly on seeds for consumption) can be sprayed with **Malathion** (50% EC) @ 10 ml/L water as a prophylactic measure.

By adopting these integrated management practices, farmers can significantly enhance Sunflower yield, improve achene quality, and extend the storage life of their produce. Always consult local agricultural extension services for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions.
