Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm that Scale insects and Mealybugs are significant sucking pests that can affect Sunflower crops in Haryana, leading to reduced vigour, yield, and quality. Effective management requires a combination of cultural practices and judicious use of CIBRC-approved insecticides.

Here's how to control Scale insects and Mealybugs in Sunflower:

**1. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Principles:**

*   **Regular Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your sunflower plants, especially the undersides of leaves, stems, leaf axils, and flower heads, for early signs of these pests. Early detection is crucial for effective control.
*   **Pruning:** For localized infestations, carefully prune and destroy heavily infested plant parts to reduce pest populations.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy crop residues after harvest to eliminate overwintering sites for pests.
*   **Encourage Natural Enemies:** Protect and encourage beneficial insects like ladybird beetles, lacewings, and parasitic wasps, which are natural predators and parasitoids of scale insects and mealybugs. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficials.
*   **Proper Nutrition and Irrigation:** Maintain healthy plants through balanced fertilization and appropriate irrigation, as stressed plants are more susceptible to pest attacks.

**2. Chemical Control (When necessary):**

Chemical control should be considered when pest populations are high and causing economic damage, or when natural enemies are insufficient. Systemic insecticides are often effective against these sap-sucking pests.

**Application Guidelines:**

*   **Timing:** Apply insecticides when pests are in their vulnerable stages (e.g., crawlers/nymphs for scale insects).
*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and in protected areas where these pests tend to hide.
*   **Rotation:** Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.

**Recommended CIBRC-approved Insecticides:**

*   **For Systemic Action (effective against both Scale Insects and Mealybugs):**
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: 0.5 - 1.0 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: 0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water.
    *   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP: 0.4 - 0.8 g per litre of water.
    *   **Spirotetramat** 150 OD: 1.0 - 1.5 ml per litre of water (known for excellent systemic action against sucking pests).

*   **For Insect Growth Regulation (especially effective against nymphs/crawlers):**
    *   **Buprofezin** 25% SC: 2.0 - 2.4 ml per litre of water.

*   **For Contact Action and Suffocation (especially for early stages or localized infestations):**
    *   **Horticultural Mineral Oil** (e.g., Paraffinic Oil): 10 - 20 ml per litre of water. Ensure good coverage. Avoid application during very hot periods (above 30°C) to prevent phytotoxicity.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and strictly follow the manufacturer's instructions on the insecticide label for specific dosage, application timing, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and safety precautions.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, and protective clothing during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Avoid spraying during flowering periods to protect pollinators, or spray early in the morning or late in the evening when pollinators are less active.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for the most current recommendations specific to your field conditions and crop stage.

By adopting these scientifically verified practices, you can effectively manage Scale insects and Mealybugs in your Sunflower crop and ensure a healthy yield.
