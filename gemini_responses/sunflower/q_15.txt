As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Sunflower in Haryana:

### Pest Management in Sunflower

**1. Grasshopper**

Grasshoppers are known to affect Sunflower, especially during the seedling and vegetative stages, by feeding on leaves and tender parts.

*   **Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
    *   Deep ploughing after harvest to expose grasshopper eggs to predators and adverse weather conditions.
    *   Maintain field sanitation by removing weeds and crop residues that can serve as breeding grounds.
    *   Hand-picking of nymphs and adults in small areas, especially during early morning hours when they are less active.

*   **Chemical Control (if infestation is severe):**
    *   Spray with:
        *   **Malathion 50% EC**: 1.25 L per acre
        *   **Quinalphos 25% EC**: 1.5 L per acre
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC**: 200-250 ml per acre
        *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC**: 1.0 L per acre

**2. Painted bug (Bagrada hilaris)**

This is not known to affect Sunflower as a significant pest. Painted bug is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., mustard, cabbage).

**3. Red cotton bug (Dysdercus cingulatus)**

Red cotton bug can occasionally affect Sunflower, particularly during the seed development stage, by sucking sap from developing seeds, leading to shrivelled and poor-quality seeds.

*   **Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
    *   Maintain field sanitation and remove alternate host plants (like cotton, okra, wild malvaceous weeds) from the vicinity of the sunflower field.
    *   Hand-picking and destruction of bugs in early stages of infestation.

*   **Chemical Control (if infestation is severe):**
    *   Spray with:
        *   **Malathion 50% EC**: 1.25 L per acre
        *   **Quinalphos 25% EC**: 1.5 L per acre
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC**: 200-250 ml per acre
        *   **Dimethoate 30% EC**: 400 ml per acre

**4. Black ants**

Black ants are generally not direct primary pests of Sunflower that cause significant feeding damage to the plant itself. However, they can be problematic in the following ways:
    *   **Seed removal:** They can carry away sown seeds, leading to poor germination.
    *   **Tending other pests:** They protect and tend to sap-sucking pests like aphids and mealybugs for their honeydew, thereby exacerbating the damage caused by these primary pests.

*   **Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
    *   Ensure proper seedbed preparation and timely sowing to minimize seed exposure.
    *   Maintain field sanitation to reduce ant nesting sites.
    *   If ants are tending aphids, focus on controlling the aphid population, which will naturally reduce ant activity.

*   **Chemical Control (if necessary):**
    *   **For seed protection (against seed removal):**
        *   Treat seeds before sowing with:
            *   **Imidacloprid 70% WS**: 7 g per kg of seed
            *   **Thiamethoxam 70% WS**: 3 g per kg of seed
    *   **For direct control of ant nests or severe localized infestations:**
        *   Drench around ant nests or apply as a spot treatment with:
            *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC**: 1.0 L per acre (mixed in appropriate water volume for drenching/spot treatment).
    *   **If ants are tending other sucking pests (e.g., aphids):**
        *   Control the primary sucking pest using recommended insecticides, which will deter ants. For example, for aphids:
            *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL**: 125 ml per acre
            *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG**: 50 g per acre

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the pesticide label regarding dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Use appropriate spray volume (e.g., 200-250 litres of water per acre for high volume sprays) to ensure proper coverage.
*   Apply insecticides during calm weather, preferably in the morning or evening, to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   Consider integrated pest management (IPM) approaches, combining cultural, mechanical, biological, and chemical methods for sustainable pest control.
