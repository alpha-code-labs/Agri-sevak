As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for managing fungal diseases in Sunflower in Haryana.

**General Cultural Practices for Fungal Disease Management:**

Before discussing specific chemical controls, it is crucial to implement good agricultural practices to minimize disease incidence:
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Plant disease-resistant or tolerant sunflower varieties suitable for the Haryana region.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice a 2-3 year crop rotation with non-host crops (e.g., cereals) to break disease cycles.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest to reduce inoculum.
*   **Optimum Plant Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to improve air circulation and reduce humidity within the canopy.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced fertilizer application. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can promote lush growth susceptible to diseases.
*   **Weed Control:** Manage weeds effectively as they can act as alternate hosts for some pathogens and impede air circulation.
*   **Irrigation Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation late in the day, which can prolong leaf wetness. Drip or furrow irrigation is preferable.

**Specific Fungal Disease Control in Sunflower:**

Here's how to control the mentioned fungal diseases:

*   **Alternaria Leaf Spot/Blight (Caused by *Alternaria helianthi* and *Alternaria alternata*)**
    This is a common and significant disease in sunflower.
    *   **Foliar Spray:**
        *   At the first appearance of symptoms, spray with:
            *   **Mancozeb** @ 2.0-2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L water).
            *   **Chlorothalonil** @ 2.0 kg/acre (or 2.0 g/L water).
            *   **Tebuconazole** @ 250-300 ml/acre (or 0.5-0.6 ml/L water).
            *   **Propiconazole** @ 200-250 ml/acre (or 0.4-0.5 ml/L water).
            *   **Azoxystrobin** @ 200 ml/acre (or 0.4 ml/L water).
        *   Repeat sprays at 10-15 day intervals if the disease persists and weather conditions are favorable.

*   **Anthracnose (Caused by *Colletotrichum spp.*)**
    While less common than Alternaria, it can occur.
    *   **Foliar Spray:**
        *   Apply fungicides similar to those used for Alternaria leaf spot:
            *   **Carbendazim** @ 250-300 g/acre (or 0.5-0.6 g/L water).
            *   **Mancozeb** @ 2.0-2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L water).
            *   **Azoxystrobin** @ 200 ml/acre (or 0.4 ml/L water).

*   **Blast**
    This is not known as a specific fungal disease affecting Sunflower. The term "blast" is primarily associated with diseases like Rice Blast. Severe blighting symptoms might be caused by other pathogens like *Alternaria* or *Phomopsis*, which are addressed under "Blight" or "Alternaria Leaf Spot/Blight."

*   **Blight (General Fungal Blights like Phomopsis Blight, Sclerotinia Blight, Alternaria Blight)**
    *   **Alternaria Blight:** Control measures are the same as for Alternaria Leaf Spot (see above).
    *   **Phomopsis Blight (Stem Canker):**
        *   **Foliar Spray:**
            *   **Tebuconazole** @ 250-300 ml/acre (or 0.5-0.6 ml/L water).
            *   **Propiconazole** @ 200-250 ml/acre (or 0.4-0.5 ml/L water).
            *   **Azoxystrobin** @ 200 ml/acre (or 0.4 ml/L water).
    *   **Sclerotinia Blight (White Mould):** This is a difficult disease to control with fungicides once established. Focus on cultural practices (crop rotation, resistant varieties, deep ploughing to bury sclerotia).
        *   **Foliar Spray (preventive/early stage):**
            *   **Boscalid** (often in combination with **Pyraclostrobin**) @ 300-400 g/acre (or 0.6-0.8 g/L water).
            *   **Fluxapyroxad** (often in combination with **Pyraclostrobin**) @ 200-300 ml/acre (or 0.4-0.6 ml/L water).

*   **Brown Spot (Often caused by *Alternaria spp.* or *Septoria helianthi*)**
    Control measures are similar to those for Alternaria Leaf Spot/Blight.
    *   **Foliar Spray:**
        *   **Mancozeb** @ 2.0-2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L water).
        *   **Chlorothalonil** @ 2.0 kg/acre (or 2.0 g/L water).
        *   **Tebuconazole** @ 250-300 ml/acre (or 0.5-0.6 ml/L water).

*   **Downy Mildew (Caused by *Plasmopara halstedii*)**
    This is a systemic disease, and prevention is key.
    *   **Seed Treatment:**
        *   Treat seeds with **Metalaxyl-M** @ 6 g/kg seed. This is crucial for early protection.
    *   **Foliar Spray (for localized infections or as a preventive measure in highly susceptible areas):**
        *   **Metalaxyl-M + Mancozeb** (combination product) @ 2.0-2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L water).
        *   **Propamocarb Hydrochloride** @ 2.0-2.5 L/acre (or 4-5 ml/L water).
        *   **Dimethomorph** (often in combination with **Mancozeb**) @ 500-600 g/acre (or 1.0-1.2 g/L water).

*   **Powdery Mildew (Caused by *Erysiphe cichoracearum* or other species)**
    *   **Foliar Spray:**
        *   **Wettable Sulphur** @ 2.0-3.0 kg/acre (or 3.0-4.0 g/L water).
        *   **Hexaconazole** @ 200-250 ml/acre (or 0.4-0.5 ml/L water).
        *   **Myclobutanil** @ 150-200 ml/acre (or 0.3-0.4 ml/L water).
        *   **Penconazole** @ 100-150 ml/acre (or 0.2-0.3 ml/L water).

*   **Grey Mildew**
    This is not known as a specific fungal disease affecting Sunflower. It is possible there is confusion with "Grey Mould" caused by *Botrytis cinerea*, which can affect sunflower heads and stems, especially under humid conditions. If Grey Mould is suspected, fungicides like **Pyraclostrobin + Boscalid** or **Azoxystrobin** can offer some control, along with improving air circulation and reducing humidity.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully, including dosage, application method, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in pathogens.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension specialists for the most current recommendations and to confirm disease diagnosis.
