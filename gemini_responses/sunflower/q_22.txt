As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following cultivation practices for Sunflower in Haryana to ensure optimal yield and plant health:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   Line sowing is highly recommended for efficient management practices such as weeding, inter-cultivation, and spraying.
    *   Seeds can be sown using a seed drill or a planter.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   The ideal planting depth for sunflower seeds is **3-5 cm**. This ensures good seed-to-soil contact for moisture absorption and facilitates proper emergence.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   **Row-to-row spacing:** Maintain a distance of **60 cm** between rows.
    *   **Plant-to-plant spacing:** Maintain a distance of **30 cm** within the row.
    *   This spacing allows for adequate light penetration, air circulation, and nutrient uptake, reducing competition among plants.

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   For hybrid sunflower varieties, a seed dose of **5-7 kg/acre** is generally recommended to achieve the desired plant population and optimal yield.
