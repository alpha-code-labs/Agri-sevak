As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach for controlling sucking pests in Sunflower. This involves a combination of cultural, biological, and chemical methods.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Sucking Pests in Sunflower:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Timely Sowing:** Sow sunflower at the recommended time to avoid peak pest incidence periods.
    *   **Balanced Fertilization:** Avoid excessive nitrogenous fertilizers, as they can promote lush, succulent growth, making plants more attractive and susceptible to sucking pests.
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the field free of weeds, which can act as alternate hosts for various sucking pests.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy crop residues after harvest to reduce overwintering pest populations.
    *   **Use of Tolerant Varieties:** If available, choose sunflower varieties known to have some tolerance or resistance to sucking pests.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Protect and encourage natural predators (e.g., ladybird beetles, lacewings, hoverfly larvae) and parasitoids (e.g., parasitic wasps) that feed on aphids, whiteflies, and leafhoppers. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides unless absolutely necessary, as they can harm these beneficial insects.

3.  **Monitoring and Economic Threshold Level (ETL):**
    *   Regularly monitor the crop for the presence of sucking pests, especially on the underside of leaves and tender shoots.
    *   Intervene with chemical control only when pest populations reach the Economic Threshold Level (ETL) to prevent economic losses.
        *   **Aphids:** When 10-15% of plants are infested or 20-30 aphids per plant.
        *   **Leafhoppers/Whiteflies/Thrips:** When 5-10 nymphs/adults per leaf or significant damage symptoms are observed.

**Chemical Control (when ETL is reached):**

For effective control of Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips, consider the following CIBRC approved insecticides. Always rotate chemicals with different modes of action to prevent resistance development. Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the underside of leaves.

*   **For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips (general broad-spectrum sucking pest control):**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** 125-150 ml per acre (in 200-300 L of water).
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** 50-100 g per acre (in 200-300 L of water).
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** 50-100 g per acre (in 200-300 L of water).
    *   **Fipronil 5% SC:** 400-600 ml per acre (in 200-300 L of water).
    *   **Dimethoate 30% EC:** 400-600 ml per acre (in 200-300 L of water).

*   **Specific for Whiteflies (especially nymphs):**
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** 400-600 ml per acre (in 200-300 L of water).
    *   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** 125-150 ml per acre (in 200-300 L of water).

*   **Specific for Aphids and Whiteflies:**
    *   **Flonicamid 50% WG:** 60-80 g per acre (in 200-300 L of water).

*   **Specific for Thrips:**
    *   **Spinosad 45% SC:** 60-80 ml per acre (in 200-300 L of water).

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and strictly follow the label instructions of the insecticide for correct dosage, application method, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and safety precautions.
*   Ensure proper spray volume for adequate coverage, especially for contact insecticides.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension specialists or HAU experts for the most current recommendations and pest situations in your specific area of Haryana.

**Regarding Psylla:**
This is not known to affect Sunflower as a significant pest.
