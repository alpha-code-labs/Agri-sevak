As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing these conditions in Sunflower in Haryana.

Here's how to control the mentioned pests:

### 1. Borers (Sunflower Head Borer and Stem Borer)

Sunflower is primarily affected by the Head Borer (*Helicoverpa armigera*) and sometimes Stem Borers (*Oberea brevis*).

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Early sowing can help escape peak pest incidence.
    *   Field sanitation and removal of crop residues.
    *   Deep ploughing after harvest to expose pupae.
*   **Biological Control:**
    *   Release of *Trichogramma chilonis* or *Trichogramma pretiosum* parasitoids at 50,000 eggs/acre, 3-4 times at weekly intervals, starting from flowering.
    *   Application of HaNPV (Helicoverpa armigera Nuclear Polyhedrosis Virus) at 250 LE/acre during evening hours.
*   **Chemical Control (for severe infestations):**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** 60-75 ml/acre
    *   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG:** 80-100 g/acre
    *   **Flubendiamide 20% WG:** 50 g/acre
    *   **Indoxacarb 14.5% SC:** 200 ml/acre

### 2. Caterpillars (e.g., Tobacco Caterpillar, Semi-loopers)

Various caterpillar species, including the Tobacco Caterpillar (*Spodoptera litura*) and semi-loopers, can cause significant defoliation and damage to sunflower leaves and heads.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Hand-picking and destruction of egg masses and early instar larvae in small areas.
    *   Installation of pheromone traps for *Spodoptera litura* at 5 traps/acre for monitoring and 15-20 traps/acre for mass trapping.
*   **Biological Control:**
    *   Application of *Bacillus thuringiensis* (Bt) formulations at 500-1000 g/acre, especially effective against early instar larvae.
    *   Application of SlNPV (Spodoptera litura Nuclear Polyhedrosis Virus) at 250 LE/acre during evening hours.
*   **Chemical Control (for severe infestations):**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** 60-75 ml/acre
    *   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG:** 80-100 g/acre
    *   **Flubendiamide 20% WG:** 50 g/acre
    *   **Indoxacarb 14.5% SC:** 200 ml/acre
    *   **Thiodicarb 75% WP:** 250-300 g/acre
    *   **Novaluron 10% EC:** 300-400 ml/acre

### 3. Diamondback Moth

This is not known to affect Sunflower. The Diamondback Moth (*Plutella xylostella*) is a specific pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., mustard, cabbage, cauliflower).

### 4. Leaf Folder

While specific "leaf folder" species are not commonly reported as primary or major pests of sunflower, if you observe caterpillars causing leaves to fold or roll, it is likely due to general caterpillar activity. In such cases, the control measures recommended for "Caterpillars" (as listed above) would be applicable.

**General Note for Chemical Application:**
Always ensure thorough spray coverage. Use an appropriate volume of water (typically 200-400 litres per acre, depending on crop canopy) to ensure good coverage. Always read and follow the instructions on the product label for safe and effective use. Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
