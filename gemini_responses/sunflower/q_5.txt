As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the control of Scab, Canker, Gummosis, and Lichen in Sunflower for farmers in Haryana:

### Scab
This is not known to affect Sunflower as a distinct disease. While various fungal infections can cause lesions, "scab" is not a recognized primary disease name for sunflower.

### Canker (Phomopsis Stem Canker)
Phomopsis stem canker, caused by *Diaporthe helianthi* (syn. *Phomopsis helianthi*), is a significant disease of sunflower in Haryana. It can lead to considerable yield losses. Control measures include:

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Crop Rotation:** Implement a crop rotation of at least 3-4 years with non-host crops such as cereals (wheat, barley), maize, or pearl millet. Avoid continuous sunflower cultivation.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Choose sunflower varieties that are known to be resistant or tolerant to Phomopsis stem canker, as recommended by HAU or ICAR.
*   **Sanitation:** After harvest, collect and destroy or deeply plough infected plant debris to reduce inoculum in the soil.
*   **Optimum Plant Spacing:** Maintain recommended plant spacing to ensure good air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce humidity and disease development.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can promote lush growth susceptible to disease. Ensure balanced application of NPK.

**2. Chemical Control (Foliar Sprays):**
Fungicide application can be effective, especially when initiated at the early flowering stage (R1-R3) or upon the first appearance of symptoms. Repeat applications may be necessary based on disease pressure and product label recommendations. Always ensure thorough coverage.

*   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC**: Apply at 0.5 - 1.0 ml per litre of water (or 500 - 1000 ml per acre).
*   **Tebuconazole 25.9% EC**: Apply at 0.75 - 1.0 ml per litre of water (or 300 - 400 ml per acre).
*   **Propiconazole 25% EC**: Apply at 0.5 ml per litre of water (or 200 ml per acre).
*   **Pyraclostrobin 13.3% + Epoxiconazole 5% SE**: Apply at 1.0 - 1.5 ml per litre of water (or 400 - 600 ml per acre).
*   **Azoxystrobin 18.2% + Difenoconazole 11.4% SC**: Apply at 0.5 - 1.0 ml per litre of water (or 500 ml per acre).

Always read and follow the instructions on the product label for specific dosage, timing, and safety precautions. Consult your local agricultural extension officer for precise recommendations based on current disease incidence and local conditions.

### Gummosis
This is not known to affect Sunflower as a distinct disease. Gummosis is primarily associated with woody perennial plants, particularly fruit trees, where gum exudes from the bark. While sunflowers can exude sap from wounds or severe infections, "gummosis" is not a standard disease term for this crop.

### Lichen
This is not known to affect Sunflower. Lichens are symbiotic organisms that typically grow on inert surfaces like rocks, tree bark, or dead wood. They are not parasitic and do not grow on living annual crop plants like sunflower, nor do they cause any damage to them.
