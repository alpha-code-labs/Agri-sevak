As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for Sunflower transplantation in Haryana:

While direct sowing is a common practice for sunflower, transplantation can be beneficial for achieving a uniform stand, better weed management in early stages, and potentially earlier maturity.

### Ideal Transplantation Time

*   **Spring/Summer Season:** The optimal time for transplanting sunflower in Haryana is generally from **mid-February to mid-March**. This timing allows the crop to establish before the intense summer heat and avoids the monsoon rains during the critical flowering and seed-filling stages, which can negatively impact pollination and seed quality.
*   **Post-Monsoon Season (Kharif):** For a post-monsoon crop, transplanting can be done from **mid-September to mid-October**. However, the spring/summer season is generally preferred for higher yields and better quality in Haryana.

### Ideal Transplantation Distance

Maintaining proper spacing is crucial for optimal plant growth, light interception, air circulation, and nutrient uptake, leading to higher yields.

*   **Row-to-Row Distance:** **60 cm**
*   **Plant-to-Plant Distance:** **30 cm**

This spacing aims for a plant population of approximately 55,000 to 60,000 plants per hectare.

### Ideal Transplantation Process

1.  **Nursery Raising:**
    *   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds with a fungicide (e.g., **Carbendazim** 2 g/kg seed or **Thiram** 2.5 g/kg seed) and an insecticide (e.g., **Imidacloprid** 5 g/kg seed) to protect against early seedling diseases and pests.
    *   **Sowing:** Sow seeds in well-prepared nursery beds or pro-trays filled with a suitable potting mix (soil, sand, and farmyard manure in a 1:1:1 ratio). Sow seeds at a depth of 2-3 cm.
    *   **Watering:** Keep the nursery beds consistently moist but not waterlogged.
    *   **Seedling Age:** Seedlings are typically ready for transplanting when they are **20-25 days old** and have 2-4 true leaves.

2.  **Field Preparation:**
    *   **Land Preparation:** Plough the field thoroughly to achieve a fine tilth. Level the field to ensure uniform irrigation.
    *   **Basal Fertilization:** Incorporate recommended basal doses of fertilizers (e.g., DAP, MOP) as per soil test recommendations.

3.  **Hardening of Seedlings:**
    *   About 7-10 days before transplanting, gradually expose the seedlings to harsher conditions by reducing watering and increasing sunlight exposure. This process helps them withstand the shock of transplanting.

4.  **Transplanting:**
    *   **Timing:** Transplant in the late afternoon or on a cloudy day to minimize transplanting shock.
    *   **Method:** Carefully lift the seedlings from the nursery bed or pro-trays, ensuring minimal root damage. Plant one seedling per hill at the recommended spacing (60 cm x 30 cm).
    *   **Depth:** Plant the seedlings at the same depth they were in the nursery.
    *   **Watering:** Immediately irrigate the field after transplanting to help the seedlings establish and settle the soil around their roots.

5.  **Post-Transplantation Care:**
    *   Monitor for pest and disease incidence.
    *   Ensure adequate moisture, especially during the establishment phase.
    *   Gap filling (replanting missing seedlings) can be done within 5-7 days of transplanting if necessary.
