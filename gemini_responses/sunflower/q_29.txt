Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide guidance on issues affecting sunflower cultivation in Haryana.

Let's address your query regarding "Dropping (Flower drop, Fruit drop, and Tinda/Boll dropping)" in Sunflower:

1.  **Tinda/Boll dropping:** This is not known to affect Sunflower. Tinda is a type of gourd, and boll refers to the fruit capsule of cotton. These terms are not applicable to sunflower.

2.  **Flower drop and Fruit drop in Sunflower:**
    In sunflower, the terms "flower drop" or "fruit drop" (where the fruit is the achene or seed) are not typically used to describe a specific, chemically treatable condition like they are in some other crops (e.g., cotton boll shedding). Instead, issues that might be perceived as "dropping" or poor development in sunflower usually relate to:
    *   **Poor seed set:** Failure of florets to develop into viable seeds, leading to empty or partially filled seeds.
    *   **Premature senescence or head loss:** The entire head failing to develop properly, rotting, or falling off prematurely.

    These issues are generally symptoms of underlying stresses or problems, rather than a direct "dropping" phenomenon. Effective control involves an integrated approach addressing the root causes:

    *   **1. Nutritional Deficiencies (Especially Boron):**
        Boron (B) is a critical micronutrient for pollen viability, fertilization, and successful seed set in sunflower. Deficiency can lead to empty or partially filled seeds, which might be perceived as poor "fruit" development.
        *   **Control:** Apply Boron as a foliar spray during the bud formation to early flowering stage.
            *   **Borax (10.5% Boron):** 1.5 kg/acre dissolved in 200 L of water.
            *   **Solubor (20.5% Boron):** 0.75 kg/acre dissolved in 200 L of water.

    *   **2. Inadequate Pollination:**
        Sunflower is largely cross-pollinated, primarily by bees. Insufficient bee activity due to adverse weather conditions (e.g., heavy rain, strong winds) or lack of pollinators can lead to poor seed set.
        *   **Control:** Encourage pollinator activity by avoiding insecticide sprays during peak flowering hours. Consider placing bee hives near the field if natural pollinator populations are low.

    *   **3. Pest Damage (Head Borer):**
        Larvae of the sunflower head borer (*Helicoverpa armigera*) feed on developing seeds within the head, causing damage and leading to poor seed development or loss.
        *   **Control:** If infestation is observed during head formation, apply appropriate insecticides.
            *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** 60 ml/acre.
            *   **Emamectin Benzoate 5% SG:** 88 g/acre.

    *   **4. Diseases (Head Rots):**
        Fungal diseases like *Sclerotinia sclerotiorum* (Sclerotinia Head Rot) and *Rhizopus arrhizus* (Rhizopus Head Rot) can cause the head to rot, leading to premature drying, poor seed development, or the entire head falling off.
        *   **Control:** Management primarily relies on cultural practices as chemical control is often limited once the rot is established in the head.
            *   **Sclerotinia Head Rot:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops, deep ploughing to bury sclerotia, and use of resistant varieties.
            *   **Rhizopus Head Rot:** Avoid mechanical injury to the heads, manage insect pests that create entry points, and ensure good air circulation.

    *   **5. Environmental Stress:**
        *   **Water Stress:** Both drought and waterlogging during critical reproductive stages (flowering and seed filling) can severely impact seed development and lead to premature senescence.
        *   **Temperature Extremes:** High temperatures during flowering can reduce pollen viability and affect fertilization.
        *   **Control:** Ensure optimal irrigation and drainage. Select heat-tolerant varieties if high temperatures are a recurring issue in your area.

In summary, to prevent issues that might be perceived as "dropping" in sunflower, focus on integrated crop management, including balanced nutrition (especially Boron), effective pest and disease control, and managing environmental stresses. There is no specific chemical treatment for "dropping" in sunflower as understood for other crops.
