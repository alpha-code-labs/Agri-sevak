Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the critical role of micronutrients in achieving optimal sunflower yield and quality. Deficiencies can significantly impact plant health and productivity.

**Crucial First Step: Diagnosis**
Before applying any micronutrient, it is paramount to get your soil tested and, if possible, conduct plant tissue analysis. Visual symptoms can often be misleading or overlap between different deficiencies. A proper diagnosis ensures you apply the correct nutrient in the right amount, preventing unnecessary expenditure and potential toxicity.

Here's how to address the common micronutrient deficiencies in Sunflower in Haryana:

### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms in Sunflower:** Stunted growth, reduced leaf size (often called 'little leaf'), interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, and sometimes a bronzing effect. Poor seed set can also occur.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application (Preventive/Severe Deficiency):**
        *   Apply **Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate** (33% Zn) at 5-10 kg/acre, or **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** (21% Zn) at 10-15 kg/acre, mixed with soil before sowing or as a basal application.
    *   **Foliar Application (Corrective/Mild Deficiency):**
        *   Spray 0.2-0.5% solution of **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** (2-5 g per litre of water) or 0.1% solution of **Zinc EDTA** (1 g per litre of water).
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, starting from 30-45 days after sowing, especially during critical growth stages like branching and flowering.

### 2. Iron (Fe) / Ferrous Deficiency

*   **Symptoms in Sunflower:** Pronounced interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on young leaves, with veins remaining distinctly green. In severe cases, the entire leaf may turn pale yellow or almost white.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application (Less effective in high pH soils):**
        *   Apply **Ferrous Sulphate Heptahydrate** at 10-20 kg/acre, mixed with soil. This is generally less effective in the alkaline soils common in Haryana.
    *   **Foliar Application (Most effective for quick correction):**
        *   Spray 0.5-1.0% solution of **Ferrous Sulphate Heptahydrate** (5-10 g per litre of water) or 0.1% solution of **Ferrous EDTA** (1 g per litre of water).
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 7-10 day intervals, targeting young foliage.

### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms in Sunflower:** Stunted growth, thickening and brittleness of leaves, cracking of stems, hollow stems, poor head development, reduced seed set, and necrosis of the growing points. The capitulum (flower head) may be deformed or fail to develop properly.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application (Preventive/Severe Deficiency):**
        *   Apply **Borax** (Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate, 10.5% B) at 5-10 kg/acre, or **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (20.5% B) at 2-4 kg/acre, mixed with soil before sowing.
    *   **Foliar Application (Corrective/Critical Stages):**
        *   Spray 0.1-0.2% solution of **Borax** (1-2 g per litre of water) or 0.1-0.15% solution of **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (1-1.5 g per litre of water).
        *   Apply 1-2 sprays, particularly at the pre-flowering and flowering stages, as boron is crucial for pollen viability and seed development.

### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms in Sunflower:** Necrosis (death) of young leaves and growing points, stunted root growth, and deformed new growth. The edges of young leaves may appear scorched or curled.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application (For bulk Ca needs and pH correction if needed):**
        *   Apply **Gypsum** (Calcium Sulphate) at 200-500 kg/acre (also helps with sodic soils) or **Calcium Nitrate** at 20-30 kg/acre, mixed with soil.
    *   **Foliar Application (For quick relief or supplementary):**
        *   Spray 0.5-1.0% solution of **Calcium Nitrate** (5-10 g per litre of water) or 0.2-0.4% solution of **Calcium Chloride** (2-4 g per litre of water).
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays during active vegetative growth.

### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms in Sunflower:** Interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on older leaves, with veins remaining green. In severe cases, leaves may develop reddish or purplish tints and eventually become necrotic.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application (Preventive/Severe Deficiency):**
        *   Apply **Magnesium Sulphate Heptahydrate** (Epsom salt, 9.6% Mg) at 10-20 kg/acre, mixed with soil.
    *   **Foliar Application (Corrective/Mild Deficiency):**
        *   Spray 0.5-1.0% solution of **Magnesium Sulphate Heptahydrate** (5-10 g per litre of water).
        *   Apply 1-2 sprays during active vegetative growth.

### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms in Sunflower:** Interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, often with small necrotic spots appearing in the yellowed areas. Growth may be stunted, and overall plant vigor reduced.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application (Less effective in high pH soils):**
        *   Apply **Manganese Sulphate Monohydrate** (30.5% Mn) at 5-10 kg/acre, mixed with soil.
    *   **Foliar Application (Most effective for quick correction):**
        *   Spray 0.2-0.5% solution of **Manganese Sulphate Monohydrate** (2-5 g per litre of water) or 0.1% solution of **Manganese EDTA** (1 g per litre of water).
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, targeting young foliage.

### General Recommendations and Precautions:

*   **Water Quality:** Always use clean water for spraying.
*   **Timing of Foliar Sprays:** Apply foliar sprays during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late afternoon) to avoid scorching and improve absorption.
*   **Wetting Agent:** Adding a non-ionic wetting agent (spreader) at recommended rates can improve spray coverage and nutrient absorption.
*   **Compatibility:** Do not mix micronutrient sprays with other pesticides or fertilizers without first checking for compatibility. Perform a small jar test if unsure.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management:** Combine micronutrient applications with balanced use of NPK fertilizers and organic manures for long-term soil health and sustained productivity.
*   **Repeat Soil Testing:** Regularly test your soil (every 2-3 years) to monitor nutrient levels and adjust your fertilization program accordingly.

By following these scientifically verified recommendations, you can effectively manage micronutrient deficiencies in your sunflower crop and ensure a healthy, productive harvest. For specific advice tailored to your farm, please consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts.
