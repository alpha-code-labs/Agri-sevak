As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies in Sunflower in Haryana:

### Control of Beetles in Sunflower

Beetles can cause significant damage to sunflower, particularly Blister Beetles which feed on flowers and pollen, and Flea Beetles which can damage young seedlings.

**1. Blister Beetles (e.g., *Mylabris spp., Epicauta spp.*):**
These beetles are often seen in large numbers during the flowering stage, feeding on pollen and petals, leading to poor seed set.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Regular monitoring of fields during flowering.
    *   Hand-picking in small areas, especially during early infestation, can be effective.
    *   Maintain field hygiene to reduce alternate host plants.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Apply insecticides when infestation levels are high (e.g., 5-10 beetles per plant or significant flower damage).
    *   Recommended CIBRC approved technical chemicals:
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC**: 200-250 ml per acre in 200-400 litres of water.
        *   **Cypermethrin 25% EC**: 100-120 ml per acre in 200-400 litres of water.
        *   **Deltamethrin 2.8% EC**: 200-250 ml per acre in 200-400 litres of water.

**2. Flea Beetles (*Phyllotreta spp.*):**
These small beetles can cause shot-hole damage to leaves, especially in young plants, affecting their growth.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Ensure good plant vigour through proper nutrition and irrigation to help plants tolerate damage.
    *   Timely sowing can help plants establish before peak pest activity.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   For severe infestations in young plants, especially at the seedling stage:
        *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL**: 100-125 ml per acre in 200-400 litres of water.
        *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG**: 40-50 g per acre in 200-400 litres of water.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC**: 200-250 ml per acre in 200-400 litres of water.

### Control of Weevils in Sunflower

While various weevil species exist, specific weevils are generally not considered major economic pests requiring dedicated chemical control measures in sunflower cultivation in Haryana. General good agricultural practices and control measures for other chewing pests often suffice if minor weevil activity is observed.

### Control of Sawflies in Sunflower

This is not known to affect Sunflower significantly in Haryana. Therefore, specific control measures are not typically required.
