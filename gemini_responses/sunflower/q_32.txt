Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

The symptom of "Drying up" (drying branches, leaves, fruits, and flowers) in sunflower is a serious concern and indicates a significant underlying problem affecting the plant's health and water transport system. As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I advise a thorough examination to identify the specific cause, as management strategies vary.

Here are the common causes and their scientifically verified management strategies for sunflower in Haryana:

### 1. Fungal Diseases

These diseases often affect the vascular system or stem base, disrupting water and nutrient flow, leading to wilting and drying.

*   **Sclerotinia Rot (White Mold / Stem Rot / Head Rot)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Water-soaked lesions on stems, leaves, or heads, often with white, cottony fungal growth and black, hard sclerotia (resting bodies). This leads to wilting, drying, and eventual collapse of affected parts or the entire plant.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural:** Practice long crop rotations (3-4 years) with non-host crops (e.g., cereals). Deep ploughing to bury sclerotia. Use resistant or tolerant varieties. Maintain proper plant spacing to improve air circulation. Remove and destroy infected plant debris.
        *   **Chemical:**
            *   **Seed Treatment:** To protect seedlings from soil-borne inoculum.
                *   **Carbendazim** at 1-2 g/kg seed.
            *   **Foliar Spray/Drench (early stages of infection):**
                *   **Carbendazim** at 0.5-1 g/L water.
                *   **Thiophanate-methyl** at 0.7-1 g/L water.

*   **Fusarium Wilt / Verticillium Wilt**
    *   **Symptoms:** Yellowing and wilting of lower leaves, progressing upwards. Often, one side of the plant or a branch may show symptoms first (unilateral wilting). Cutting the stem reveals vascular discoloration (brown streaks). Eventually, the entire plant dries up.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural:** Use resistant varieties. Practice long crop rotations (at least 3-4 years) with non-host crops. Soil solarization during summer can reduce inoculum. Maintain balanced nutrition to improve plant vigor.
        *   **Chemical (Drenching):** If symptoms are observed early in isolated plants.
                *   **Carbendazim** at 0.5-1 g/L water, applied as a drench around the base of affected plants.
                *   **Propiconazole** at 0.5 ml/L water, applied as a drench.

*   **Rhizoctonia Root Rot**
    *   **Symptoms:** Primarily affects seedlings (damping-off), but can cause reddish-brown lesions on roots and stem base of older plants, leading to root decay, wilting, and drying.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural:** Ensure good drainage in the field. Avoid excessive irrigation. Use raised beds in areas prone to waterlogging.
        *   **Chemical:**
            *   **Seed Treatment:**
                *   **Thiram** at 2-3 g/kg seed.
                *   **Carbendazim** at 1-2 g/kg seed.
            *   **Soil Drench (if severe in patches):**
                *   **Carbendazim** at 0.5-1 g/L water.

### 2. Insect Pests

Certain pests can damage the plant's internal structures, disrupting water and nutrient transport.

*   **Sunflower Stem Borer (e.g., *Oberea brevis*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Larvae bore into the stem, creating tunnels and disrupting the vascular tissue. This leads to wilting of individual branches or the entire plant above the point of damage, followed by drying. Swelling at the point of entry may be visible.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural:** Crop rotation. Remove and destroy infested plants and crop residues after harvest to reduce carry-over.
        *   **Chemical (if infestation is severe and detected early):**
            *   **Foliar Spray (during egg-laying or early larval stage):**
                *   **Chlorantraniliprole** at 0.3 ml/L water.
                *   **Emamectin benzoate** at 0.2 g/L water.

*   **White Grubs / Root Grubs**
    *   **Symptoms:** Larvae feed on the roots, severely damaging the root system. This impairs water and nutrient uptake, leading to stunted growth, yellowing, sudden wilting, and drying of plants, often in patches in the field.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural:** Deep ploughing during summer to expose grubs to predators and sun. Hand-picking adult beetles (if feasible) during their emergence. Use light traps to attract and kill adult beetles.
        *   **Chemical (Soil Application at sowing/transplanting):**
            *   **Fipronil** 0.3% GR at 20-25 kg/acre, applied in the soil near the root zone.
            *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 2-2.5 L/acre, mixed with irrigation water or applied to the soil before sowing.

### 3. Physiological and Environmental Factors

These factors directly impact the plant's ability to absorb and transport water.

*   **Water Stress (Drought or Waterlogging)**
    *   **Drought:** Insufficient soil moisture leads to wilting, scorching of leaves, and eventually drying of the entire plant.
    *   **Waterlogging:** Excess water in the root zone deprives roots of oxygen, causing root damage and decay. This mimics drought symptoms as roots cannot absorb water, leading to wilting and drying.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Optimal Irrigation:** Provide timely and adequate irrigation, especially during critical growth stages (flowering and seed development).
        *   **Drainage:** Ensure proper field drainage to prevent waterlogging, particularly in heavy soils.
        *   **Soil Moisture Conservation:** Use mulching to conserve soil moisture and reduce evaporation.

*   **Nutrient Deficiencies**
    *   Severe deficiencies of essential nutrients, particularly Potassium (K), Phosphorus (P), or even Nitrogen (N), can lead to overall plant decline, premature senescence, and drying of leaves and plant parts.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Soil Testing:** Conduct regular soil tests to determine nutrient status.
        *   **Balanced Fertilization:** Apply fertilizers based on soil test recommendations and crop requirements.

*   **Heat Stress**
    *   Extreme high temperatures, especially when combined with low humidity and insufficient water, can cause scorching of leaves, wilting, and drying of plant tissues.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Adequate Irrigation:** Ensure plants are well-watered during hot periods.
        *   **Mulching:** Helps to keep soil temperatures stable and conserve moisture.

**Recommendation:**

It is crucial to carefully inspect the affected plants, looking for specific signs like fungal growth, insect damage, vascular discoloration, or root health. Based on a precise diagnosis, you can implement the most effective management strategy. For any persistent or widespread issues, please consult with the plant pathology or entomology experts at HAU for further guidance.
