As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling soil pests like termites and root-knot nematodes in sunflower cultivation in Haryana.

Both termites and root-knot nematodes are significant soil pests that can severely impact sunflower health and yield. An Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods, is recommended for effective and sustainable control.

### 1. Control of Termites (e.g., *Odontotermes obesus*, *Microtermes obesi*) in Sunflower

Termites can cause considerable damage by feeding on germinating seeds, roots, and the base of the stem, leading to wilting, stunted growth, and plant death.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Termites:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Deep Ploughing:** Ploughing the field deeply during summer exposes termite colonies to sunlight and predators, disrupting their nests.
    *   **Removal of Residues:** Clear crop residues, stubble, and any woody debris from the field, as these can serve as food sources and nesting sites for termites.
    *   **Proper Irrigation:** Maintain adequate soil moisture, as termites prefer dry conditions.
    *   **Farmyard Manure (FYM):** Ensure well-decomposed FYM is used, as undecomposed organic matter can attract termites.

*   **Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved):**
    *   **Seed Treatment:**
        *   Treat sunflower seeds before sowing with **Imidacloprid 70% WS** at 3-5 g per kg of seed. This provides early protection against termites and other sucking pests.
    *   **Soil Application/Drench:**
        *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC**: Apply 2.5 L per acre mixed with 200-400 L of water as a soil drench or incorporate into the soil before sowing.
        *   **Fipronil 0.3% GR**: Apply 6-10 kg per acre by broadcasting and incorporating into the soil at the time of sowing.

### 2. Control of Root-Knot Nematodes (*Meloidogyne spp.*) in Sunflower

Root-knot nematodes are microscopic worms that infect plant roots, causing characteristic galls or knots. These galls impair the plant's ability to absorb water and nutrients, leading to stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, reduced vigour, and significant yield losses. Sunflowers are susceptible to root-knot nematode damage.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Root-Knot Nematodes:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate sunflower with non-host crops like cereals (e.g., wheat, maize, sorghum) or marigold (which has nematicidal properties) for 2-3 years to reduce nematode populations. Avoid continuous cultivation of susceptible crops.
    *   **Summer Ploughing/Solarization:** Deep ploughing during hot summer months exposes nematodes to lethal temperatures. Soil solarization (covering moist soil with clear plastic sheets during peak summer) can also effectively reduce nematode populations in the topsoil.
    *   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or **Neem cake** at 200-400 kg per acre into the soil 2-3 weeks before sowing. Neem cake releases compounds that are toxic to nematodes and also promotes beneficial soil microbes.
    *   **Resistant Varieties:** If available and suitable for Haryana conditions, choose sunflower varieties known to have resistance or tolerance to root-knot nematodes.

*   **Biological Control:**
    *   **Purpureocillium lilacinum (formerly Paecilomyces lilacinus)**: Apply a bio-nematicide formulation containing *Purpureocillium lilacinum* (e.g., 1x10^8 CFU/g) at 2-4 kg per acre, mixed with FYM or compost, and apply to the soil before sowing or at the time of planting. This fungus parasitizes nematode eggs and females.

*   **Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved):**
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   **Carbofuran 3% GR**: Apply 10-15 kg per acre at the time of sowing or transplanting, by broadcasting and incorporating into the soil.
        *   **Phorate 10% GR**: Apply 4 kg per acre at the time of sowing or transplanting, by broadcasting and incorporating into the soil.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully, including dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Consult your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and the latest approved practices.
