As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I advise on protecting sunflower from environmental stresses in Haryana as follows:

### Protecting Sunflower from Environmental Stress

**1. Extreme Cold and Frost:**
Sunflower is generally sensitive to severe cold and frost, especially during its early vegetative and reproductive stages.

*   **Timely Sowing:** For Rabi season cultivation, sow sunflower varieties suitable for the region during October-November. This ensures that the critical flowering and seed-filling stages occur before the peak frost period of December-January. Avoid late sowing.
*   **Irrigation:** A light irrigation before an anticipated frost event can help raise the soil temperature and reduce the severity of frost damage. The latent heat released from water freezing on the plant surface can also offer some protection.
*   **Potassium Nutrition:** Ensure adequate potassium (K) fertilization as part of your nutrient management plan. Potassium plays a vital role in improving plant tolerance to cold stress by enhancing cell wall strength and regulating water balance.
*   **Foliar Sprays:**
    *   Application of **Potassium Silicate** (2-3 g/L water) as a foliar spray can strengthen cell walls and improve the plant's resilience to cold.
    *   Foliar spray of **Triacontanol** (0.5-1 ml/L water) can enhance physiological processes and overall stress resilience, helping the plant cope with cold.

**2. Heat Stress (Loo) and Intense Sunlight:**
High temperatures, hot dry winds (Loo), and intense sunlight, particularly during flowering and seed development, can significantly reduce yield and oil content.

*   **Timely Sowing:** For Zaid (spring/summer) season cultivation, sow early (February-March) to allow the crop to complete its critical flowering and seed-filling stages before the onset of severe heatwaves (April-May).
*   **Adequate Irrigation:** Maintain optimal soil moisture, especially during flowering and seed development. Water stress exacerbates heat damage. Frequent, light irrigations during hot periods can help cool the plant canopy through evaporative cooling.
*   **Mulching:** Apply organic mulch (e.g., straw, crop residues) around the base of plants. This helps conserve soil moisture, reduce soil temperature, and suppress weeds, creating a more favorable microclimate for the roots.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Balanced nutrition, particularly adequate potassium, improves the plant's ability to withstand heat stress by improving water use efficiency and maintaining turgor.
*   **Foliar Sprays:**
    *   **Kaolin clay** (50-75 g/L water) sprayed on leaves acts as a reflective coating, reducing leaf temperature and protecting against sunburn and heat stress.
    *   **Potassium Silicate** (2-3 g/L water) can improve heat tolerance by strengthening cell walls, reducing water loss, and enhancing antioxidant activity.
    *   Foliar application of **Triacontanol** (0.5-1 ml/L water) can help mitigate heat stress by improving photosynthetic efficiency and overall plant vigor.
