Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist from Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding soil pests like termites and nematodes in your broccoli crop. Both can cause significant damage if not managed properly. Here is scientifically verified advice for their control:

### Control of Termites (Deemak) in Broccoli

Termites can damage roots and the base of the stem, especially in dry conditions or where organic matter is present.

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Deep Ploughing:** Plough the field deeply during summer to expose termite colonies to sunlight and predators.
*   **Removal of Residues:** Clear all crop residues, stubble, and woody debris from the field before planting, as these can serve as food sources for termites.
*   **Proper Irrigation:** Maintain adequate soil moisture, as termites prefer dry conditions. Avoid water stress in plants.
*   **Well-decomposed FYM/Compost:** Use only well-decomposed farmyard manure or compost. Fresh organic matter can attract termites.

**2. Chemical Control (Pre-planting Soil Treatment):**
*   For effective control, apply insecticides to the soil before planting or at the time of land preparation.
    *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC:** Apply 2.5 - 4.0 litres per acre mixed with 200-400 litres of water and drench the soil or spray evenly and incorporate into the soil before transplanting.
    *   **Fipronil 0.3% GR:** Apply 10-15 kg per acre and incorporate into the soil during final land preparation.

### Control of Nematodes (Root-Knot Nematodes - Gaath Wali Sootr Krimi) in Broccoli

Root-knot nematodes (*Meloidogyne* spp.) are a major problem in many vegetable crops, including broccoli, causing galls on roots, stunted growth, and reduced yield.

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate broccoli with non-host crops like cereals (wheat, maize, sorghum) or marigold. Marigold (Tagetes spp.) is known to have nematicidal properties when grown as a trap crop.
*   **Summer Solarization:** Cover the moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks during hot summer months to raise soil temperature and kill nematodes.
*   **Removal of Infected Plants:** Remove and destroy any severely infected plants along with their root systems to prevent further spread.
*   **Use of Healthy Seedlings:** Ensure that the broccoli seedlings you transplant are healthy and free from nematode infection.

**2. Biological Control:**
*   **Neem Cake:** Incorporate **Neem cake** at 200-400 kg per acre into the soil 2-3 weeks before transplanting. Neem cake releases compounds that are toxic to nematodes and also improves soil health.
*   **Bio-nematicides:** Apply microbial formulations containing beneficial fungi or bacteria.
    *   ***Purpureocillium lilacinum*** (formerly *Paecilomyces lilacinus*): Apply 2.5-5 kg per acre mixed with 100 kg of well-decomposed farmyard manure or compost and broadcast evenly in the field before transplanting, or apply as a root dip for seedlings.

**3. Chemical Control (Nematicides):**
*   **Pre-planting Soil Application:**
    *   **Fluopyram 34.48% SC:** Apply 200-250 ml per acre as a soil drench or through drip irrigation at the time of transplanting or within a few days after transplanting.
    *   **Ethoprophos 10% GR:** Apply 10-15 kg per acre and incorporate into the soil during the final land preparation before transplanting.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label carefully, including dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) while handling and applying chemicals.
*   Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods, is the most sustainable and effective way to manage these soil pests.
