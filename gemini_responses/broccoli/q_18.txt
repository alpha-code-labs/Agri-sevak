As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the use of growth regulators and micronutrients in Broccoli for Haryana conditions:

It is crucial to understand the specific role of each compound. While some are essential micronutrients, others are hormones that can have varied effects depending on the crop and concentration.

### **1. Ethephon**

**Ethephon** is an ethylene-releasing compound. Ethylene is a plant hormone primarily involved in fruit ripening, senescence (aging), and abscission (shedding of plant parts).

*   **Recommendation for Broccoli:** **Ethephon** is generally not recommended as a growth regulator for broccoli. Its primary action of promoting senescence and ripening can lead to premature yellowing of the curds and reduced shelf life, which is undesirable for this crop. Therefore, it is not known to have beneficial effects as a growth regulator for broccoli production.

### **2. 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid**

**2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid** is a synthetic auxin. While auxins can act as growth regulators at extremely low concentrations, 2,4-D is primarily known and widely used as a broadleaf herbicide.

*   **Recommendation for Broccoli:** **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid** is not recommended as a growth regulator for broadleaf crops like broccoli. Even at very low concentrations, there is a high risk of phytotoxicity, malformation, and severe crop damage due to its herbicidal properties. Its application would be detrimental to broccoli plants.

### **3. Boron**

Boron is an essential micronutrient critical for cell wall formation, sugar transport, pollen germination, and overall plant development. Broccoli, like other brassicas, has a high demand for boron, and its deficiency can significantly impact curd quality and yield.

*   **Recommendation for Broccoli:** Boron application is highly recommended for broccoli, especially in soils prone to boron deficiency, which is common in many parts of Haryana.

    *   **For Soil Application (Pre-planting or at planting):**
        *   Apply **Sodium tetraborate decahydrate** (Borax) at a rate of 1-2 kg/acre, mixed thoroughly with the soil. This helps to ensure a steady supply of boron throughout the crop cycle.

    *   **For Foliar Application (During vegetative growth and curd initiation):**
        *   Prepare a solution of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (e.g., Solubor) or **Sodium tetraborate decahydrate** (Borax) at a concentration of 0.1-0.2% (1-2 g per litre of water).
        *   Apply 2-3 foliar sprays, starting from 30-40 days after transplanting, with subsequent sprays at 15-20 day intervals, especially if deficiency symptoms (e.g., hollow stems, browning of curds) are observed or anticipated. Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.

**Important Note:** Always ensure uniform application and follow label instructions for any chemical product. Over-application of boron can also be toxic to plants. A soil test can help determine the exact boron status of your field and guide the appropriate application rate.
