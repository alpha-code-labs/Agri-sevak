As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following cultivation practices for Broccoli in Haryana:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   Broccoli is primarily grown by **transplanting** seedlings.
    *   Seeds should be sown in a well-prepared nursery bed. Raised beds (approximately 15 cm high, 1 meter wide, and of convenient length) are recommended for better drainage and management.
    *   Sow seeds thinly in lines 5-10 cm apart in the nursery.
    *   Seedlings are ready for transplanting to the main field when they are 4-6 weeks old and have 4-5 true leaves.
    *   In the main field, transplanting should be done in a **row pattern**.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   **Nursery Sowing:** Sow seeds shallowly, about **0.5-1.0 cm** deep, and cover with a thin layer of fine soil or sand.
    *   **Transplanting:** Plant the seedlings to the same depth they were growing in the nursery, ensuring the root ball is well covered and the stem is not buried too deep.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   Maintain adequate spacing for optimal growth and head development.
    *   **Row-to-Row Spacing:** **45-60 cm**
    *   **Plant-to-Plant Spacing:** **30-45 cm**

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   For open-pollinated varieties: **200-250 g per acre**
    *   For hybrid varieties (which are more common and vigorous): **150-200 g per acre**
    *   This seed dose is for raising seedlings in the nursery sufficient for one acre of main field.
