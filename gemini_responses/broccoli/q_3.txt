As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling various rot types in Broccoli, keeping in mind the conditions in Haryana and using CIBRC approved chemicals.

**General Principles for Rot Control in Broccoli:**

Effective management of rots in broccoli relies on an integrated approach combining cultural practices and judicious use of chemical controls.

*   **Sanitation:** Promptly remove and destroy all infected plant debris, including fallen leaves and harvested plant parts, to reduce inoculum sources.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Implement a strict 3-4 year crop rotation with non-Brassica crops (e.g., cereals, maize) to break the disease cycle and reduce pathogen build-up in the soil.
*   **Soil Drainage:** Ensure well-drained soil to prevent waterlogging, which creates anaerobic conditions favorable for many root and stem rot pathogens. Raised beds can be beneficial.
*   **Planting Density:** Maintain adequate spacing between plants to improve air circulation within the canopy, reducing humidity and fungal growth.
*   **Irrigation Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day, to keep foliage dry. Drip irrigation is preferred as it delivers water directly to the root zone without wetting the leaves.
*   **Healthy Seeds/Seedlings:** Always use certified disease-free seeds or healthy seedlings from a reputable source to prevent introducing pathogens.

Here's how to control specific rot types:

**1. Root Rot, Stem Rot, Foot Rot, Collar Rot, Crown Rot, Neck Rot**
These are often caused by a complex of soil-borne fungal pathogens such as *Rhizoctonia solani*, *Sclerotinia sclerotiorum*, *Phytophthora* spp., and *Fusarium* spp. They manifest as lesions or decay at the soil line, on roots, or on the lower stem, leading to wilting, yellowing, and eventual plant collapse.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Implement a strict 3-4 year crop rotation.
    *   Improve soil drainage and avoid waterlogging.
    *   Ensure proper plant spacing for good air circulation.
    *   Remove and destroy infected plant material promptly.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Seed Treatment (for prevention):**
        *   **Thiram** at 2-3 g per kg of seed.
        *   **Captan** at 2-3 g per kg of seed.
        *   **Carbendazim** at 1-2 g per kg of seed.
        *   **Metalaxyl-M** at 0.5-1 g per kg of seed (especially effective against *Phytophthora*).
    *   **Soil Drench (for established plants, if symptoms appear):**
        *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride** at 2-3 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Metalaxyl-M** at 0.5-1 g per litre of water.
        *   **Carbendazim** at 1-1.5 g per litre of water.
        *   **Mancozeb** at 2-2.5 g per litre of water.

**2. Black Rot**
This is a serious bacterial disease caused by *Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris*. It typically causes V-shaped yellow lesions on leaf margins that expand inwards, with characteristic blackening of the veins within the lesions.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Use certified disease-free seeds. Hot water treatment of seeds (50°C for 25-30 minutes) can reduce seed-borne inoculum, but may affect germination, so test a small batch first.
    *   Practice a minimum 3-year crop rotation.
    *   Avoid overhead irrigation, especially when plants are wet, as water splash aids bacterial spread.
    *   Remove and destroy infected plant debris immediately.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Copper oxychloride** at 2.5-3 g per litre of water, applied as a foliar spray.

**3. Fruit Rot (referring to the Broccoli head rot)**
This refers to the decay of the edible broccoli head, often caused by pathogens like *Botrytis cinerea* (Grey Mould) or *Sclerotinia sclerotiorum*, especially under humid conditions, following insect damage, or mechanical injury.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Ensure good air circulation around plants by proper spacing.
    *   Avoid mechanical damage to the heads during cultivation and harvesting.
    *   Harvest heads promptly when mature.
    *   Remove any senescing or damaged leaves that can serve as infection sites.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Mancozeb** at 2-2.5 g per litre of water, as a foliar spray.
    *   **Carbendazim** at 1-1.5 g per litre of water, as a foliar spray.
    *   **Thiophanate methyl** at 1-1.5 g per litre of water, as a foliar spray (effective against *Sclerotinia* and *Botrytis*).

**4. Seed Rot and Seedling Rot (Damping-off)**
These are common problems during germination and early seedling stages, caused by soil-borne fungi like *Pythium* spp., *Phytophthora* spp., *Rhizoctonia solani*, and *Fusarium* spp. Seed rot prevents germination, while damping-off causes seedlings to collapse at the soil line.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Use healthy, certified seeds.
    *   Sow seeds in well-drained, sterilized potting mix or soil.
    *   Avoid overwatering and ensure proper seed depth.
    *   Maintain good nursery hygiene and sanitation.
*   **Chemical Control (Seed Treatment is crucial):**
    *   **Thiram** at 2-3 g per kg of seed.
    *   **Captan** at 2-3 g per kg of seed.
    *   **Carbendazim** at 1-2 g per kg of seed.
    *   **Metalaxyl-M** at 0.5-1 g per kg of seed (especially for *Pythium* and *Phytophthora*).
    *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride** can also be used as a seed treatment or drench, follow product specific rates.

Always read and follow the label instructions for any chemical product before use.
