As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Broccoli, keeping in mind the specific conditions and approvals for Haryana, India:

It is crucial to adopt an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, mechanical, and chemical methods for sustainable pest control. Always read and follow the label instructions for any pesticide used.

Here's the advice for each pest:

**1. Grasshopper**
Grasshoppers can cause significant defoliation in broccoli.

*   **Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
    *   Regular monitoring of fields, especially during early crop stages.
    *   Hand-picking and destroying grasshoppers for small infestations.
    *   Maintaining field sanitation by removing weeds and crop residues that can serve as breeding grounds.
    *   Deep ploughing after harvest can expose eggs to predators and desiccation.

*   **Chemical Control (if infestation is severe):**
    *   **Malathion** 50% EC: Apply at 1.0 - 1.5 litres per acre, mixed in 200-400 litres of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: Apply at 200-250 ml per acre, mixed in 200-400 litres of water.

**2. Painted bug (Bagrada hilaris)**
The Painted bug is a significant pest of cruciferous crops like broccoli, causing damage by sucking sap from leaves, stems, and developing heads, leading to wilting, yellowing, and stunted growth.

*   **Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
    *   Remove cruciferous weeds (e.g., wild mustard, radish) from and around the field, as they serve as alternate hosts.
    *   Timely sowing/planting can help avoid peak pest populations.
    *   Deep ploughing after harvest to destroy pupae and adults.
    *   Crop rotation with non-cruciferous crops.

*   **Chemical Control (if infestation is severe):**
    *   **Malathion** 50% EC: Apply at 1.0 - 1.5 litres per acre, mixed in 200-400 litres of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: Apply at 200-250 ml per acre, mixed in 200-400 litres of water.
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: Apply at 100-125 ml per acre, mixed in 200-400 litres of water. This systemic insecticide is effective against sucking pests.

**3. Red cotton bug**
This is not known to affect Broccoli. The Red cotton bug (Dysdercus koenigii) is primarily a pest of cotton and other plants belonging to the Malvaceae family.

**4. Black ants**
This is not known to affect Broccoli as a primary pest causing direct damage to the plant. While ants may be present in the field, they are generally not considered a direct pest of broccoli. They might be associated with other honeydew-producing pests like aphids, in which case controlling the primary pest (e.g., aphids) would indirectly manage the ant population.
