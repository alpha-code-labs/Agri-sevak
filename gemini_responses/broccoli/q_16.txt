As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following fertilizer schedule for Broccoli cultivation in Haryana. Broccoli is a heavy feeder, particularly of Nitrogen and Potassium, and also requires adequate Phosphorus and Sulphur for optimal growth and curd development.

**General Nutrient Target (per acre):**
*   Nitrogen (N): 120-150 kg
*   Phosphorus (P2O5): 60-80 kg
*   Potassium (K2O): 80-120 kg
*   Sulphur (S): 20-30 kg

Based on these targets, here is a recommended fertilizer application schedule using the specified fertilizers:

### Recommended Fertilizer Doses for Broccoli (per acre)

**1. Basal Application (at the time of transplanting):**
Mix these fertilizers thoroughly into the soil before or at the time of transplanting.

*   **DAP (Diammonium Phosphate):** 150 kg/acre
    *   *Provides approximately 27 kg N and 69 kg P2O5.*
*   **Urea:** 70 kg/acre
    *   *Provides approximately 32 kg N.*
*   **Potash (Muriate of Potash - MOP):** 85 kg/acre
    *   *Provides approximately 51 kg K2O.*
*   **Sulphur (Elemental Sulphur 90% or Bentonite Sulphur 90%):** 28 kg/acre
    *   *Provides approximately 25 kg S.*

**2. First Top Dressing (30 Days After Transplanting - DAT):**
Apply these fertilizers around the base of the plants and lightly incorporate into the soil, followed by irrigation.

*   **Urea:** 65 kg/acre
    *   *Provides approximately 30 kg N.*
*   **Potash (Muriate of Potash - MOP):** 40 kg/acre
    *   *Provides approximately 24 kg K2O.*

**3. Second Top Dressing (60 Days After Transplanting - DAT, or at curd initiation stage):**
Apply these fertilizers around the base of the plants and lightly incorporate into the soil, followed by irrigation.

*   **Urea:** 65 kg/acre
    *   *Provides approximately 30 kg N.*
*   **Potash (Muriate of Potash - MOP):** 40 kg/acre
    *   *Provides approximately 24 kg K2O.*

### Foliar Application (as supplementary nutrition):

These nano-fertilizers are excellent for supplementing nutrient uptake, especially during critical growth stages or to correct minor deficiencies.

*   **Nano-Urea:**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml/L of water.
    *   **Application:** Apply 2-3 foliar sprays during the vegetative growth phase and at the curd development stage. The first spray can be given 30-35 DAT, followed by subsequent sprays at 15-20 day intervals.
*   **Nano-DAP:**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml/L of water.
    *   **Application:** Apply 1-2 foliar sprays during the early vegetative growth and pre-curd initiation stages.

### Alternative Fertilizer Options:

*   **SSP (Single Super Phosphate):** If **DAP** is not available or if you prefer a Sulphur-rich Phosphorus source, **SSP** can be used. To provide 70 kg P2O5, approximately 438 kg of **SSP** (16% P2O5) would be required. This would also provide about 48 kg of Sulphur, potentially reducing the need for separate Sulphur application. However, it would require additional **Urea** to meet the Nitrogen requirement.
*   **NPK Complex Fertilizers:** If using a balanced NPK complex fertilizer (e.g., 12:32:16 or 10:26:26), the basal application would be adjusted accordingly to meet the N, P, and K requirements, followed by top-dressing with **Urea** and **Potash** as needed.

**Important Note:**
These are general recommendations. For precise nutrient management, it is highly recommended to conduct a soil test before planting. Soil test results will provide specific information about your field's nutrient status and help tailor fertilizer applications more accurately, optimizing nutrient use efficiency and minimizing environmental impact.
