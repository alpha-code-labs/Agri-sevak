As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the maturity signs, harvesting time, and cutting process for Broccoli in Haryana:

**Maturity Signs for Broccoli:**

*   **Head Size:** The central head should reach a desirable market size, typically 10-15 cm in diameter, depending on the variety.
*   **Compactness:** The florets (flower buds) should be tightly packed and firm. The head should feel dense when gently squeezed.
*   **Color:** The head should be a uniform, deep green color. Any yellowing indicates over-maturity or stress, and the quality will decline rapidly.
*   **Florets:** The individual florets should be closed. If they start to loosen, separate, or show signs of yellowing or opening (indicating the beginning of flowering), the head is past its prime for harvest.

**Harvesting Time for Broccoli:**

*   **Optimal Stage:** Harvest when the heads are fully developed, firm, and dark green, but before the florets begin to open or turn yellow. This usually occurs 60-100 days after transplanting, depending on the variety and prevailing weather conditions.
*   **Time of Day:** It is best to harvest broccoli in the early morning after the dew has dried, or in the late afternoon. Harvesting during cooler parts of the day helps maintain the turgidity, freshness, and shelf life of the heads. Avoid harvesting during the hottest part of the day.
*   **Frequency:** Broccoli plants often produce smaller side shoots (secondary heads) after the main central head is harvested. These can be harvested subsequently, extending the harvest period for several weeks.

**Cutting Process for Broccoli:**

*   **Tool:** Use a sharp, clean knife or secateurs to make a clean cut.
*   **Main Head:** Cut the main stem approximately 10-15 cm below the base of the head. This provides a sufficient stem length for handling and allows for potential development of side shoots.
*   **Side Shoots:** If the variety is known to produce side shoots, leave the plant in the field. These smaller heads will develop in the leaf axils and can be harvested later when they reach an appropriate size and firmness, following the same maturity signs as the main head.
*   **Handling:** Handle the harvested heads carefully to avoid bruising the delicate florets. Cool the harvested broccoli as quickly as possible to maintain quality and extend shelf life.
