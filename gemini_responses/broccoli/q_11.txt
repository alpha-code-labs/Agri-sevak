As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an integrated pest management (IPM) approach for controlling Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies in Broccoli. Regular monitoring of your crop is crucial for timely and effective intervention.

Here are the scientifically verified control measures using CIBRC approved technical chemical names:

### 1. Control of Beetles (e.g., Flea Beetles, Mustard Beetles)

Beetles can cause significant damage, especially to young plants by feeding on leaves, leading to shot-hole damage or defoliation.

*   **For early stage infestation or seedling protection (systemic action):**
    *   Spray **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL at 125-150 ml per acre (or 0.5-0.6 ml per liter of water).
    *   Spray **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG at 50-100 g per acre (or 0.2-0.4 g per liter of water).
*   **For established plants and severe infestations (contact action):**
    *   Spray **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 100-150 ml per acre (or 0.4-0.6 ml per liter of water).
    *   Spray **Cypermethrin** 25% EC at 200-250 ml per acre (or 0.8-1.0 ml per liter of water).

### 2. Control of Weevils (e.g., Cabbage Stem Weevil, Turnip Gall Weevil)

Weevils can damage stems and roots, leading to stunted growth, wilting, or the formation of galls.

*   **For systemic protection and early control:**
    *   Spray **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL at 125-150 ml per acre (or 0.5-0.6 ml per liter of water).
    *   Spray **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG at 50-100 g per acre (or 0.2-0.4 g per liter of water).
*   **For contact action against adult weevils:**
    *   Spray **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 1000-1250 ml per acre (or 4-5 ml per liter of water).
    *   Spray **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 100-150 ml per acre (or 0.4-0.6 ml per liter of water).

### 3. Control of Sawflies (e.g., Cabbage Sawfly)

Sawfly larvae are voracious feeders and can cause significant defoliation by chewing holes in leaves or consuming entire leaf margins.

*   **For effective control of larvae:**
    *   Spray **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 100-150 ml per acre (or 0.4-0.6 ml per liter of water).
    *   Spray **Cypermethrin** 25% EC at 200-250 ml per acre (or 0.8-1.0 ml per liter of water).
    *   Spray **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 1000-1250 ml per acre (or 4-5 ml per liter of water).

### Important Considerations:

*   **Spray Volume:** Ensure thorough coverage by using an adequate spray volume, typically 200-250 liters of water per acre for field crops.
*   **Timing of Application:** Apply insecticides when pest populations reach economic threshold levels, preferably during the cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to maximize efficacy and minimize drift.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pest resistance.
*   **Safety Precautions:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, and protective clothing during mixing and spraying operations.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Strictly observe the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) mentioned on the product label for each chemical to ensure the broccoli is safe for consumption.
*   **Local Guidance:** Always consult the latest recommendations from Haryana Agricultural University or your local agricultural extension office for the most current and specific advice tailored to your region and crop stage.
