As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following doses of organic manures for Broccoli cultivation in Haryana:

*   **Farmyard Manure (FYM):**
    *   Apply **15-20 tonnes per acre** of well-decomposed FYM.
    *   Incorporate it thoroughly into the soil during land preparation, at least 2-3 weeks before transplanting.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   Apply **3-4 tonnes per acre** of high-quality vermicompost.
    *   This can be applied as a basal dose and incorporated into the soil during land preparation, or a portion can be used for top-dressing around the plants during early growth stages.

*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract):**
    *   Sagarika is a plant growth stimulant and micronutrient source, typically applied as a foliar spray or through drip irrigation, complementing the bulk organic manures.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Mix **2.5 - 5 ml per litre** of water and spray uniformly on the foliage.
        *   First spray: 15-20 days after transplanting.
        *   Second spray: 15-20 days after the first spray (at head initiation stage).
    *   **Drip Irrigation/Soil Drench:** Apply **1-2 litres per acre** diluted in sufficient water, during critical growth stages.
