Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

Addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium) is crucial for healthy growth and optimal yield in Broccoli. As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend the following scientifically verified approaches for Haryana conditions:

It is important to first confirm the deficiency through visual symptoms and, ideally, a soil test, as symptoms can sometimes overlap or be confused with other issues.

### Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

Nitrogen is vital for vegetative growth and chlorophyll production.

*   **Symptoms:**
    *   General yellowing (chlorosis) of older leaves, starting from the tips and progressing inwards.
    *   Stunted plant growth with thin, spindly stems.
    *   Pale green overall foliage.
    *   Reduced head size and delayed maturity.

*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Foliar Application (for quick relief):**
        *   Spray 1-2% solution of **Urea** (10-20 g of **Urea** per litre of water) on the foliage. Repeat after 7-10 days if symptoms persist.
        *   Alternatively, a 0.5-1% solution of **Calcium Nitrate** (5-10 g of **Calcium Nitrate** per litre of water) can be used, especially if calcium deficiency is also suspected.
    *   **Soil Application (for sustained supply):**
        *   Apply 20-40 kg of **Urea** per acre as a top dressing, depending on the severity of the deficiency and the crop stage. Ensure proper irrigation after application to facilitate nutrient uptake.

### Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

Phosphorus is essential for root development, flowering, and energy transfer within the plant.

*   **Symptoms:**
    *   Purplish discoloration on the undersides of older leaves, sometimes extending to the upper surface.
    *   Stunted growth and poor root development.
    *   Delayed maturity and poor head formation.
    *   Leaves may appear dull and dark green before turning purplish.

*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Soil Application (Phosphorus is less mobile in soil, so soil application is most effective):**
        *   Apply 50-100 kg of **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)** per acre as a top dressing, ensuring it is incorporated into the soil near the root zone.
        *   Alternatively, apply 100-200 kg of **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** per acre. SSP also provides sulfur and calcium, which are beneficial.
        *   It is best to apply phosphorus fertilizers during land preparation or as a basal dose, but for existing deficiencies, top dressing with incorporation is necessary.

### Potassium (K) Deficiency

Potassium plays a crucial role in water regulation, disease resistance, and overall plant vigour and quality.

*   **Symptoms:**
    *   Yellowing and browning (scorching or necrosis) of leaf margins, particularly on older leaves.
    *   Weak stems and lodging.
    *   Poor head quality, reduced size, and uneven development.
    *   Increased susceptibility to diseases.

*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Foliar Application (for quick relief):**
        *   Spray a 0.5-1% solution of **Muriate of Potash (Potassium Chloride)** (5-10 g of **Muriate of Potash** per litre of water) or **Potassium Sulphate** (5-10 g of **Potassium Sulphate** per litre of water). Repeat after 7-10 days if needed.
    *   **Soil Application (for sustained supply):**
        *   Apply 30-60 kg of **Muriate of Potash (Potassium Chloride)** per acre as a top dressing, ensuring it is well mixed with the soil and followed by irrigation.
        *   Alternatively, **Potassium Sulphate** can be used at similar rates, which also provides sulfur.

**General Recommendation:**

To prevent nutrient deficiencies and ensure balanced nutrition, it is highly recommended to conduct a **soil test** before planting each crop cycle. This will provide precise information on the nutrient status of your soil and allow for tailored fertilizer recommendations, saving costs and improving efficiency.

Always ensure uniform application and proper irrigation after applying soil-based fertilizers to maximize nutrient uptake. For foliar sprays, apply during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to avoid scorching and improve absorption.
