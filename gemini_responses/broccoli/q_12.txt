As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Scale insects and Mealybugs in Broccoli in Haryana. Both these pests are known to affect Broccoli and can cause significant damage if not managed properly.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Approach:**

Effective control relies on an integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods.

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy infested plant debris and weeds, which can harbor these pests.
    *   **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to improve air circulation and reduce humidity, making the environment less favorable for pests.
    *   **Water Management:** Avoid water stress, as stressed plants are more susceptible.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate broccoli with non-host crops to break the pest life cycle.
    *   **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect plants, especially the undersides of leaves and stem joints, for early signs of infestation. Early detection is crucial for effective management.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   **Natural Enemies:** Encourage natural predators and parasitoids such as ladybird beetles (e.g., *Cryptolaemus montrouzieri* for mealybugs), lacewings, and parasitic wasps. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

3.  **Chemical Control (if necessary):**
    When infestations are severe and cultural/biological methods are insufficient, chemical intervention may be required. Always follow label instructions, wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), and observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) to ensure food safety.

    For effective control of Scale insects and Mealybugs, consider the following CIBRC approved technical chemicals:

    *   **For Mealybugs and Scale Crawlers (Nymphs):**
        *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at a rate of 1.25 litres per acre (or 2.5 ml per litre of water). This is an insect growth regulator that interferes with molting, primarily effective against nymphs.
        *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at a rate of 125 ml per acre (or 0.5 ml per litre of water). This is a systemic insecticide effective against sucking pests.
        *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at a rate of 100 grams per acre (or 0.5 grams per litre of water). Another systemic neonicotinoid effective against sucking pests.

    *   **For Established Scale Insects and Mealybugs (including adults):**
        *   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:** Apply at a rate of 150-200 ml per acre (or 0.75-1 ml per litre of water). This is a systemic insecticide with translaminar and ambimobile movement, providing excellent control of both scales and mealybugs.
        *   **Horticultural Mineral Oil (HMO):** Apply at a concentration of 10-20 ml per litre of water. HMOs work by suffocating the pests. They are particularly effective against scale insects and can be used alone or in combination with other insecticides (check compatibility). Ensure thorough coverage.

    **Application Notes:**
    *   Ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and in crevices where these pests tend to hide.
    *   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
    *   Apply insecticides preferably in the late afternoon or early morning to minimize impact on beneficial insects and reduce pesticide degradation by sunlight.

This comprehensive approach will help in effectively managing Scale insects and Mealybugs in your Broccoli crop.
