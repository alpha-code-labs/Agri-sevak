This is not known to affect Broccoli.

Broccoli is harvested for its immature flower heads. The terms "Flower drop," "Fruit drop," and "Tinda/Boll dropping" are typically associated with other crops (e.g., fruit-bearing vegetables, cotton, gourds) where the reproductive structures (flowers, young fruits, bolls) prematurely detach from the plant.

In Broccoli, the primary concerns related to the reproductive part are:
*   **Bolting:** Premature flowering due to stress (often high temperatures), leading to the elongation of the stem and opening of yellow flowers, making the head unmarketable. This is not a "dropping" phenomenon.
*   **Buttoning:** Formation of very small, premature heads, often due to stress or nutrient deficiencies.
*   **Loose heads:** Heads that are not compact, often due to high temperatures or nutrient imbalances.

These issues are distinct from "dropping" as described in your question.
