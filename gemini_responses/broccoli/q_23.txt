As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified seed and soil treatment processes for Broccoli cultivation in Haryana to ensure healthy plant establishment and mitigate early disease and pest pressure.

### Seed Treatment for Broccoli

Seed treatment is crucial for protecting young seedlings from seed-borne and early soil-borne pathogens, particularly damping-off diseases, and ensuring uniform germination.

*   **Fungicidal Treatment:**
    *   Apply **Thiram** at 2.5 grams per kilogram of seed. This provides broad-spectrum protection against various seed-borne fungi causing damping-off and seedling blight.
    *   Alternatively, apply **Carbendazim** at 1.5 grams per kilogram of seed for effective control of diseases like blackleg and damping-off caused by fungi such as *Rhizoctonia* and *Fusarium*.

### Soil Treatment for Broccoli

Soil treatment, especially pre-planting, helps in managing soil-borne diseases and nematodes, creating a healthier environment for root development and reducing early crop losses.

*   **For Soil-borne Fungal Diseases (e.g., Damping-off, Root Rot):**
    *   **Pre-planting Soil Incorporation/Drench:**
        *   Apply **Propamocarb hydrochloride** at 2-3 ml per litre of water as a drench around the root zone of seedlings or incorporate into the soil before transplanting. This is particularly effective against oomycete pathogens like *Pythium* and *Phytophthora*.
        *   Alternatively, for broader fungal control, **Carbendazim** can be applied as a soil drench at 1-2 grams per litre of water, targeting diseases like *Rhizoctonia* and *Fusarium*.
*   **For Nematode Management (e.g., Root-knot nematodes):**
    *   **Pre-planting Soil Application:**
        *   Incorporate **Cadusafos** (10% G) at 10-15 kilograms per acre into the soil during the final land preparation. This provides effective control against various nematode species.
        *   Alternatively, **Fluopyram** (34.48% SC) can be applied as a soil drench or through drip irrigation at 250-300 ml per acre, targeting root-knot nematodes and certain soil-borne fungi.

It is important to ensure thorough mixing and application for optimal efficacy. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions for handling and application of these chemicals.
