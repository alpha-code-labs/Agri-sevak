Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the critical role of micronutrients in achieving optimal yield and quality in broccoli cultivation. Deficiencies can significantly impact plant health and productivity.

The most crucial first step in addressing any micronutrient deficiency is a **soil test**. This provides a precise understanding of the nutrient status of your field and helps in making targeted recommendations, preventing both deficiencies and toxicities. Visual symptoms can be indicative, but a soil test confirms the diagnosis.

Here's how to address the common micronutrient deficiencies in broccoli, based on scientific recommendations for Haryana:

### General Recommendations:
*   **Soil Testing:** Conduct regular soil tests (every 2-3 years) to monitor nutrient levels.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management:** Combine organic manures (Farm Yard Manure, compost) with chemical fertilizers to improve soil health and nutrient availability.
*   **Foliar Application:** Often preferred for quick correction of deficiencies, especially during critical growth stages. Apply sprays during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to maximize absorption and minimize leaf burn.
*   **Water Quality:** Ensure the water used for spraying is of good quality and pH.
*   **Wetting Agents:** Adding a non-ionic wetting agent (spreader) can improve spray coverage and absorption.

### Specific Micronutrient Deficiencies and their Management in Broccoli:

#### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency
*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, small and narrow leaves (often called "little leaf"), interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, and sometimes purplish discoloration on older leaves.
*   **Foliar Application:** For quick correction, spray with:
    *   **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (21% Zn) at 0.5% concentration (5 g/L of water).
    *   Alternatively, **Zinc EDTA** (12% Zn) at 0.1% concentration (1 g/L of water).
    *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, starting from 3-4 weeks after transplanting or upon symptom appearance.
*   **Soil Application:** If soil test indicates severe deficiency, apply:
    *   **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** at 10-15 kg/acre as a basal application before transplanting.

#### 2. Iron (Fe) Deficiency
*   **Symptoms:** Prominent interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on young leaves, while the veins remain distinctly green. In severe cases, the entire leaf may turn almost white.
*   **Foliar Application:** For quick correction, spray with:
    *   **Ferrous sulphate** (19% Fe) at 0.5% concentration (5 g/L of water).
    *   Alternatively, **Iron EDTA** (12% Fe) at 0.1% concentration (1 g/L of water).
    *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, targeting young foliage.
*   **Soil Application:** In alkaline soils (common in Haryana), **Iron EDTA** at 5-10 kg/acre can be more effective due to its stability. **Ferrous sulphate** can be applied at 20-25 kg/acre, but its availability can be limited in high pH soils.

#### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency
*   **Symptoms:** This is a critical deficiency for broccoli. Symptoms include "hollow stem" (pith breakdown in the stem), browning of the curd (internal and external), water-soaked areas, stunted growth, distorted leaves, and cracking of petioles.
*   **Foliar Application:** Spray with:
    *   **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (20% B) at 0.1-0.15% concentration (1-1.5 g/L of water).
    *   Alternatively, **Sodium tetraborate decahydrate** (Borax, 11% B) at 0.2% concentration (2 g/L of water).
    *   Apply 1-2 sprays, first at head initiation and the second 15 days later.
*   **Soil Application:** Apply:
    *   **Sodium tetraborate decahydrate** (Borax) at 4-6 kg/acre.
    *   Alternatively, **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** at 2-3 kg/acre as a basal application before transplanting, especially in sandy soils or where deficiency is known.

#### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency
*   **Symptoms:** Tip burn on young, developing leaves, stunted growth, poor curd development, and increased susceptibility to physiological disorders and soft rot.
*   **Foliar Application:** Spray with:
    *   **Calcium chloride** at 0.5% concentration (5 g/L of water).
    *   Alternatively, **Calcium nitrate** at 0.5% concentration (5 g/L of water).
    *   Apply 2-3 sprays starting from curd initiation at 10-15 day intervals.
*   **Soil Application:** If soil pH is low, apply:
    *   **Gypsum** (Calcium sulphate dihydrate) at 200-400 kg/acre.
    *   Alternatively, **Calcium nitrate** at 20-30 kg/acre as a basal application.

#### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency
*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, with the veins remaining green. In severe cases, the leaves may develop a reddish-purple tint.
*   **Foliar Application:** Spray with:
    *   **Magnesium sulphate** (Epsom salt) at 0.5-1.0% concentration (5-10 g/L of water).
    *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, starting when symptoms appear.
*   **Soil Application:** Apply:
    *   **Magnesium sulphate** at 10-20 kg/acre as a basal application. In acidic soils, **Dolomite** (Calcium magnesium carbonate) can be used to supply both Ca and Mg and raise pH.

#### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency
*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, often appearing as a fine "netting" pattern, sometimes followed by small necrotic spots.
*   **Foliar Application:** Spray with:
    *   **Manganese sulphate** at 0.5% concentration (5 g/L of water).
    *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, starting when symptoms appear.
*   **Soil Application:** Apply:
    *   **Manganese sulphate** at 10-15 kg/acre as a basal application, especially in high pH soils where Mn availability is low.

Always ensure proper diagnosis before applying any micronutrient, as excessive application can lead to toxicity and further problems. For specific field conditions, please consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts.
