As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I must provide scientifically verified advice. Based on current agricultural knowledge and common diseases affecting broccoli (a Brassica crop), please find the assessment for each condition:

*   **Scab:** This is not known to affect Broccoli.
*   **Canker:** This is not known to affect Broccoli. While Brassicas can suffer from stem lesions (e.g., Blackleg), the specific disease "Canker" is not recognized for broccoli.
*   **Gummosis:** This is not known to affect Broccoli. Gummosis is a condition primarily affecting woody plants and trees, characterized by the exudation of gum. Broccoli is an herbaceous plant.
*   **Lichen:** This is not known to affect Broccoli. Lichens are symbiotic organisms (fungus and alga) that grow on surfaces like tree bark or rocks. They are epiphytes and do not parasitize plants. They are not a disease or pest of herbaceous annual crops like broccoli.
