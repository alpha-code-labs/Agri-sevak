Controlling sucking pests like Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips in Broccoli is crucial for a healthy crop and good yield. Psylla is generally not a significant pest of Broccoli in Haryana, but the control measures for other sucking pests will also manage it if it appears. A comprehensive Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is recommended.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategy:**

1.  **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your broccoli plants, especially the undersides of leaves and growing points, for the presence of pests. Yellow sticky traps can be used for monitoring and mass trapping of whiteflies, thrips, and leafhoppers.
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the field and surrounding areas free of weeds, as they can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
    *   **Balanced Nutrition:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush, soft growth that is more attractive to sucking pests.
    *   **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing for good air circulation, which can reduce pest build-up.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate broccoli with non-host crops to break the pest cycle.
3.  **Biological Control:** Encourage natural enemies such as ladybird beetles, lacewings, and parasitic wasps, which prey on aphids and whiteflies. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides if natural enemy populations are high.
4.  **Physical Barriers:** In small plots, using insect-proof nets can be effective against these pests.

**Chemical Control (When necessary, based on pest threshold):**

When pest populations exceed economic thresholds, chemical intervention may be required. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves.

Here are some CIBRC-approved technical chemicals for the control of sucking pests in Broccoli:

*   **For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips:**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at 0.5 - 0.75 ml per litre of water (100 - 150 ml per acre).
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at 0.2 - 0.3 g per litre of water (40 - 60 g per acre).
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply at 0.2 - 0.25 g per litre of water (40 - 50 g per acre).
    *   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:** Apply at 0.75 ml per litre of water (150 ml per acre). This is effective against a broad range of sucking pests including aphids, whiteflies, and thrips, with good systemic action.

*   **Primarily for Whiteflies (especially nymphs):**
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at 1.25 ml per litre of water (250 ml per acre). This is an Insect Growth Regulator (IGR) and is very effective against whitefly nymphs.

*   **Primarily for Thrips and Leafhoppers:**
    *   **Fipronil 5% SC:** Apply at 1.5 - 2 ml per litre of water (300 - 400 ml per acre).

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Spray Volume:** For effective coverage, use 200-250 litres of water per acre, depending on the crop canopy.
*   **Rotation:** Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in pests. Do not use the same chemical repeatedly.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Strictly observe the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) mentioned on the insecticide label to ensure the produce is safe for consumption.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying. Follow all instructions and safety precautions mentioned on the product label.
*   **Timing:** Spray during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
