Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU), Hisar, I advise you on the effective and scientifically verified control of borers, caterpillars, diamondback moth, and leaf folders in your Broccoli crop. These are primarily lepidopteran pests, and their management often involves similar strategies, with special attention required for the Diamondback Moth due to its rapid resistance development.

An Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is crucial for sustainable and effective control.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Principles:**

1.  **Regular Monitoring:** Regularly scout your fields for eggs, larvae, and signs of damage (e.g., holes in leaves, webbing, boreholes in stems/curds). Early detection is key.
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting cruciferous crops continuously in the same field.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy crop residues after harvest to reduce pest carryover.
    *   **Weed Management:** Control weeds, especially those belonging to the crucifer family, as they can act as alternate hosts.
    *   **Proper Nutrition:** Maintain optimal plant health, as stressed plants are more susceptible.
3.  **Biological Control:**
    *   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Protect and encourage natural predators (e.g., ladybird beetles, lacewings) and parasitoids (e.g., *Cotesia plutellae* for DBM). Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm beneficial insects.
    *   **Biopesticides:** Utilize microbial insecticides like *Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki* (Bt), which are effective against young larvae and safe for beneficials.
4.  **Resistance Management:** For Diamondback Moth, which develops resistance quickly, it is vital to rotate insecticides with different modes of action. Avoid repeated use of the same chemical group.

**Specific Control Measures for Borers, Caterpillars, Diamondback Moth, and Leaf Folder:**

These pests are primarily lepidopteran larvae. Borers in broccoli are typically caterpillars that bore into stems or curds. The following CIBRC approved technical chemicals are recommended for their effective control. Always ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the underside of leaves.

1.  **For early instar larvae and as part of resistance management:**
    *   **Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki** (e.g., 5% WP formulation): Apply 500-1000 g per acre, mixed in 200-400 litres of water (2.5-5 g/L). Apply preferably in the evening.

2.  **For effective control of various larval stages, rotate these chemicals:**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC: Apply 60 ml per acre, mixed in 200-400 litres of water (0.15-0.3 ml/L).
    *   **Emamectin Benzoate** 5% SG: Apply 88-100 g per acre, mixed in 200-400 litres of water (0.22-0.5 g/L).
    *   **Spinetoram** 11.7% SC: Apply 140-160 ml per acre, mixed in 200-400 litres of water (0.35-0.8 ml/L). This is particularly effective against DBM.
    *   **Indoxacarb** 14.5% SC: Apply 200 ml per acre, mixed in 200-400 litres of water (0.5-1 ml/L).
    *   **Novaluron** 10% EC (Insect Growth Regulator): Apply 750 ml per acre, mixed in 200-400 litres of water (1.875-3.75 ml/L). This is effective against young larvae and helps in resistance management.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Water Volume:** Ensure adequate water volume (200-400 litres per acre) for thorough coverage, especially for dense foliage.
*   **Rotation:** Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance, particularly for Diamondback Moth.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Strictly observe the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) mentioned on the product label to ensure the safety of the produce.
*   **Product Label:** Always read and follow the instructions on the product label for precise dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   **Local Advice:** For specific recommendations tailored to your local conditions and current pest pressure, please consult your nearest HAU Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or agricultural extension officer.

By adopting these scientific and integrated approaches, you can effectively manage these pests and ensure a healthy Broccoli crop.
