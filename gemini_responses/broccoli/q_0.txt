As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I advise on the integrated management of fungal diseases in Broccoli, keeping in mind the agro-climatic conditions of Haryana and CIBRC approved chemicals.

**General Integrated Disease Management (IDM) Principles for Broccoli:**

Before resorting to chemical control, it is crucial to implement cultural practices to minimize disease incidence:

*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice a minimum 3-year rotation with non-brassica crops to break disease cycles.
*   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris immediately after harvest.
*   **Disease-Free Seeds/Seedlings:** Use certified disease-free seeds or healthy seedlings from a reputable source.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to improve air circulation and reduce humidity within the canopy.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can promote lush growth susceptible to fungal infections.
*   **Irrigation Management:** Water in the morning to allow foliage to dry quickly, reducing the duration of leaf wetness.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available, choose broccoli varieties known for resistance or tolerance to common fungal diseases.

Here's the control strategy for the specific fungal diseases mentioned:

**1. Alternaria (Alternaria Leaf Spot/Blight)**
This disease is caused by *Alternaria brassicicola* and *A. brassicae* and is a common problem in broccoli.
*   **Symptoms:** Characterized by dark brown to black spots with concentric rings (target-spot appearance) on leaves, often surrounded by a yellow halo. Severe infection can lead to defoliation and blight.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   Implement cultural practices as mentioned above.
    *   For chemical control, apply fungicides at the first sign of symptoms or as a preventive measure during humid conditions:
        *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP @ 2.5 kg/acre (mixed in 500-750 L of water) or 2.5-3 g/L water.
        *   **Chlorothalonil** 75% WP @ 2.5 kg/acre (mixed in 500-750 L of water) or 2.5-3 g/L water.
        *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC @ 200 ml/acre (mixed in 200-300 L of water) or 0.75-1 ml/L water.
        *   **Propineb** 70% WP @ 2.5 kg/acre (mixed in 500-750 L of water) or 2.5-3 g/L water.

**2. Anthracnose**
Caused by *Colletotrichum higginsianum*, this disease can affect broccoli.
*   **Symptoms:** Small, circular, water-soaked spots on leaves that enlarge and become sunken, tan to brown, often with dark margins. In severe cases, it can affect stems and florets.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   Follow strict sanitation and crop rotation.
    *   Use disease-free seeds.
    *   Chemical control can be initiated upon symptom appearance:
        *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP @ 2.5 kg/acre (mixed in 500-750 L of water) or 2.5-3 g/L water.
        *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP @ 250-500 g/acre (mixed in 500-750 L of water) or 0.5-1 g/L water.
        *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC @ 200 ml/acre (mixed in 200-300 L of water) or 0.75-1 ml/L water.

**3. Downy Mildew**
This is a significant disease of broccoli caused by *Hyaloperonospora brassicae*.
*   **Symptoms:** Yellowish, angular spots on the upper leaf surface, corresponding to a white to grayish, fuzzy fungal growth on the lower leaf surface. Can lead to stunted growth and poor head formation.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   Ensure good air circulation and avoid overhead irrigation, especially in the evening.
    *   Chemical control is often necessary, particularly during cool, moist weather:
        *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP @ 2.5 kg/acre (mixed in 500-750 L of water) or 2.5-3 g/L water.
        *   **Metalaxyl-M** 3.3% + **Chlorothalonil** 33.1% SC @ 1.5-2 ml/L water.
        *   **Metalaxyl-M** 4% + **Mancozeb** 64% WP @ 2.5 kg/acre (mixed in 500-750 L of water) or 2.5-3 g/L water.
        *   **Dimethomorph** 50% WP @ 200-300 g/acre (mixed in 200-300 L of water) or 0.75-1 g/L water.
        *   **Propineb** 70% WP @ 2.5 kg/acre (mixed in 500-750 L of water) or 2.5-3 g/L water.

**4. Powdery Mildew**
Caused by *Erysiphe cruciferarum*, this disease can affect broccoli, though less frequently than downy mildew.
*   **Symptoms:** White, powdery patches on the upper and lower surfaces of leaves, stems, and sometimes florets.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   Maintain good air circulation.
    *   Chemical applications can be effective:
        *   **Sulphur** 80% WP @ 2 kg/acre (mixed in 500-750 L of water) or 2-3 g/L water.
        *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC @ 200 ml/acre (mixed in 200-300 L of water) or 0.75-1 ml/L water.
        *   **Myclobutanil** 10% WP @ 400 g/acre (mixed in 200-300 L of water) or 1.5-2 g/L water.
        *   **Hexaconazole** 5% SC @ 400 ml/acre (mixed in 200-300 L of water) or 1.5-2 ml/L water.

**Diseases Not Known to Affect Broccoli Significantly or as Distinct Diseases:**

*   **Blast:** This is not known to affect Broccoli.
*   **Blight:** While Alternaria causes a type of blight (Alternaria Blight), if a distinct "Blight" disease (other than Alternaria) is implied, this is not known to affect Broccoli as a primary or widely recognized disease.
*   **Brown spot:** This is a general symptom. Specific diseases like Alternaria cause brown spots. If it is meant as a distinct disease, this is not known to affect Broccoli as a primary or widely recognized disease.
*   **Grey mildew:** This is not known to affect Broccoli.
