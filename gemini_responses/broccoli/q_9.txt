Controlling mites, specifically Red Spider Mite (Tetranychus urticae) and Rust Mite (various Eriophyid mites), in Broccoli is crucial for maintaining crop health and yield. These pests can cause significant damage by sucking sap, leading to yellowing, bronzing, leaf distortion, and reduced head formation.

Here's a scientifically verified approach for their control:

**I. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies:**

1.  **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect the underside of leaves, especially in warmer, drier periods, for the presence of mites, their eggs, and webbing (for red spider mites). Early detection is key.
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Weed Management:** Remove weeds around the field as they can act as alternate hosts for mites.
    *   **Proper Irrigation:** Maintain adequate soil moisture. Water stress can make plants more susceptible to mite infestations. Overhead irrigation can sometimes help dislodge mites.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting broccoli or other susceptible brassicas in the same field repeatedly.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infested plant debris after harvest.
3.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Encourage natural enemies like predatory mites (e.g., *Amblyseius* species), ladybird beetles, and lacewings. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

**II. Chemical Control (Acaricides):**

When mite populations reach damaging levels, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the underside of leaves where mites reside. Rotate different classes of acaricides to prevent resistance development.

Here are some CIBRC-approved technical chemical names and their recommended dosages for mite control in Broccoli:

*   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** Apply at a rate of **0.5 - 0.75 ml per litre of water**. This is effective against all life stages of mites.
*   **Fenpyroximate 5% SC:** Apply at a rate of **1.0 ml per litre of water**. It provides quick knockdown and residual activity.
*   **Propargite 57% EC:** Apply at a rate of **1.5 - 2.0 ml per litre of water**. This is a broad-spectrum acaricide effective against various mite species.
*   **Abamectin 1.9% EC:** Apply at a rate of **0.5 ml per litre of water**. It has translaminar action, providing control on both sides of the leaf.
*   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP:** Apply at a rate of **2.0 - 3.0 g per litre of water**. This is particularly effective against rust mites and also helps in controlling powdery mildew. Avoid applying when temperatures are very high (above 30-32°C) as it can cause phytotoxicity.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Spray Volume:** Ensure sufficient water volume (typically 400-600 litres per acre, depending on crop canopy) to achieve complete coverage.
*   **Rotation:** Always rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in mite populations.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always refer to the product label for the specific Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) to ensure the safety of the harvested produce.
*   **Safety:** Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying.
