Mites, including Red Spider Mite (*Tetranychus urticae*) and various Rust Mites (Eriophyid mites), are significant pests of Bottle Gourd (*Lagenaria siceraria*) in Haryana, especially during dry and warm weather conditions. They can cause considerable damage by sucking sap, leading to yellowing, bronzing, leaf distortion, and reduced yield.

Effective control requires an integrated approach:

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Practices:**
*   **Regular Monitoring:** Frequently inspect the underside of leaves for mites, their eggs, and webbing (for spider mites). Early detection is crucial.
*   **Water Spray:** In case of mild infestation, a strong jet of water can dislodge mites from the plant surface.
*   **Weed Management:** Remove weeds around the field as they can act as alternate hosts for mites.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Avoid excessive nitrogenous fertilizers, which can make plants more susceptible to mite attacks.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation to break the pest cycle.

**2. Biological Control:**
*   Conserve natural enemies like predatory mites (e.g., *Amblyseius* species), ladybird beetles, and lacewings, which prey on pest mites. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

**3. Chemical Control (Acaricides):**
When mite populations reach damaging levels, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Ensure thorough coverage, especially on the underside of leaves.

Here are some CIBRC approved technical chemical names for mite control in Bottle Gourd:

*   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** Apply at a rate of 0.5 ml per liter of water (approximately 100-125 ml per acre). Effective against all life stages of spider mites.
*   **Fenpyroximate 5% SC:** Apply at a rate of 1.5-2 ml per liter of water (approximately 300-400 ml per acre). Effective against eggs, nymphs, and adults of spider mites.
*   **Propargite 57% EC:** Apply at a rate of 5-6 ml per liter of water (approximately 1.0-1.25 liters per acre). Effective against all stages of spider mites.
*   **Abamectin 1.9% EC:** Apply at a rate of 0.4-0.5 ml per liter of water (approximately 80-100 ml per acre). Effective against spider mites and also provides good control of eriophyid (rust) mites. It has translaminar action.
*   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP:** Apply at a rate of 3-5 g per liter of water (approximately 600 g - 1 kg per acre). Effective against both spider mites and rust mites, especially in early stages of infestation. It also has fungicidal properties. Avoid spraying sulphur when temperatures are very high (above 35°C) as it can cause phytotoxicity.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label carefully, including dosage, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and safety precautions.
*   Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying.
*   Ensure good spray coverage, particularly on the undersides of leaves where mites are most prevalent.
*   Rotate different classes of acaricides to prevent resistance development.
