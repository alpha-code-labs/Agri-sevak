Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing pests in Bottle Gourd (Lagenaria siceraria) in Haryana.

Effective pest management in Bottle Gourd requires an integrated approach, combining cultural, mechanical, and judicious chemical methods.

### Control of Beetles in Bottle Gourd

Beetles are significant pests of Bottle Gourd, especially the Red Pumpkin Beetle (Aulacophora foveicollis) and various species of Epilachna beetles.

**Damage:**
*   **Red Pumpkin Beetle:** Adults feed on leaves, flowers, and young fruits, causing defoliation and damage to developing fruits. Young seedlings are particularly vulnerable and can be completely destroyed. Larvae feed on roots and underground stems.
*   **Epilachna Beetles:** Both adults and grubs (larvae) feed on the underside of leaves, scraping the chlorophyll and leaving a characteristic skeletonized appearance.

**Management Strategies:**

1.  **Cultural and Mechanical Methods:**
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy crop residues after harvest to reduce overwintering sites for pests.
    *   **Early Sowing:** Sowing Bottle Gourd early can help plants establish before peak pest populations emerge.
    *   **Hand Picking:** For Epilachna beetles, adults and grubs can be hand-picked and destroyed, especially in small plots.
    *   **Trap Cropping:** Planting a small border of a highly susceptible cucurbit variety can attract beetles, which can then be managed more intensively.
    *   **Netting:** For young seedlings, covering them with fine nets can protect them from initial beetle attack.

2.  **Chemical Control (Apply only when pest incidence crosses economic threshold levels):**
    *   For effective control, ensure thorough coverage of the foliage. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI). Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

    *   **For Red Pumpkin Beetle and other Leaf Beetles:**
        *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply 0.3-0.5 ml per litre of water (or 60-100 ml per acre).
        *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply 0.2 g per litre of water (or 80 g per acre).
        *   **Fipronil 5% SC:** Apply 1.5-2.0 ml per litre of water (or 300-400 ml per acre).
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** Apply 0.5 ml per litre of water (or 100-150 ml per acre).
        *   **Malathion 50% EC:** Apply 2.0 ml per litre of water (or 500 ml per acre).

    *   **For Epilachna Beetles:**
        *   **Malathion 50% EC:** Apply 2.0 ml per litre of water (or 500 ml per acre).
        *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** Apply 0.3 ml per litre of water (or 60 ml per acre), particularly effective against grubs.

### Control of Weevils in Bottle Gourd

While some weevil species can occasionally infest cucurbits, they are generally not considered major or widespread pests of Bottle Gourd in Haryana compared to beetles. If you observe weevil damage (e.g., boring into stems or fruits), the insecticides recommended for beetles, particularly those with contact and systemic action, would likely be effective.

*   **Fipronil 5% SC:** Apply 1.5-2.0 ml per litre of water (or 300-400 ml per acre).
*   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply 0.3-0.5 ml per litre of water (or 60-100 ml per acre).

### Control of Sawflies in Bottle Gourd

This is not known to affect Bottle Gourd. Sawflies are primarily pests of cruciferous crops and some trees/shrubs, not cucurbits like Bottle Gourd.

**Important Considerations for Chemical Application:**
*   Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying.
*   Spray during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   Ensure proper calibration of spray equipment for uniform application.
*   Strictly adhere to the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) mentioned on the insecticide label to ensure food safety.
