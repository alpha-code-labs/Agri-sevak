As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend an integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods for effective management of all rot types (Root, Stem, Foot, Collar, Crown, Neck, Black, Fruit, Seed, and Seedling rot) in Bottle Gourd. These rots are primarily caused by various fungal and oomycete pathogens such as *Pythium*, *Phytophthora*, *Fusarium*, *Rhizoctonia*, *Sclerotium*, and *Didymella bryoniae*.

### Integrated Disease Management for Rots in Bottle Gourd:

**1. Cultural and Preventive Practices (Foundation of Control):**

*   **Site Selection and Soil Preparation:**
    *   Choose well-drained fields. Avoid low-lying areas prone to waterlogging.
    *   Prepare raised beds or ridges to improve drainage around the root zone and prevent direct contact of fruits with wet soil.
    *   Ensure good soil aeration through proper tillage.
*   **Crop Rotation:**
    *   Practice a minimum 3-year crop rotation with non-cucurbit crops (e.g., cereals, pulses) to break the disease cycle and reduce pathogen build-up in the soil.
*   **Seed Selection:**
    *   Use healthy, certified, disease-free seeds from reputable sources.
*   **Water Management:**
    *   Avoid excessive irrigation, especially during flowering and fruiting stages.
    *   Irrigate in the morning to allow foliage and soil surface to dry quickly.
    *   Prefer drip irrigation over flood or overhead irrigation to minimize leaf wetness and direct splashing of soil-borne pathogens.
*   **Planting Density and Spacing:**
    *   Maintain optimal plant spacing to ensure good air circulation, which helps reduce humidity and fungal growth.
*   **Sanitation:**
    *   Promptly remove and destroy infected plant parts (leaves, stems, fruits) and crop debris from the field to reduce inoculum sources.
    *   Clean tools and equipment to prevent pathogen spread.
*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Provide balanced nutrition. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can lead to lush, susceptible growth.
*   **Weed Control:**
    *   Keep the field free of weeds, as they can act as alternate hosts for pathogens and impede air circulation.
*   **Staking/Trellising:**
    *   Support plants with stakes or trellises to keep fruits and foliage off the ground, reducing contact with soil-borne pathogens and improving air circulation.

**2. Biological Control:**

*   **Seed Treatment/Soil Application:**
    *   Apply bio-fungicides containing *Trichoderma viride* or *Trichoderma harzianum* (e.g., 5-10 g/kg seed for seed treatment, or 2.5 kg/acre mixed with 50 kg farmyard manure for soil application) to suppress soil-borne pathogens causing root, stem, and seedling rots.
    *   *Pseudomonas fluorescens* (e.g., 10 g/kg seed or 2.5 kg/acre for soil application) can also be used for similar benefits.

**3. Chemical Control (Use CIBRC approved technical chemical names only):**

**A. Seed Treatment (Essential for Seed Rot and Seedling Rot/Damping-off):**

*   Treat seeds before sowing with a systemic fungicide to protect against early-stage infections.
    *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 1-2 g/kg seed.
    *   **Thiram** 75% WS at 2-3 g/kg seed (often used in combination with Carbendazim).
    *   **Metalaxyl-M** 31.8% ES at 3-4 ml/kg seed (effective against oomycetes like *Pythium* and *Phytophthora*).
    *   **Pyraclostrobin** 13.3% + **Fluxapyroxad** 33.3% SE at 0.5-1 ml/kg seed.

**B. Soil Drench/Drip Application (For Root, Stem, Foot, Collar, Crown, Neck Rots):**

*   Apply fungicides as a drench around the base of the plants or through drip irrigation at the first sign of disease or as a preventive measure in high-risk areas.
    *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride** 72.2% SL at 2-3 ml/L water.
    *   **Metalaxyl-M** 3.3% + **Mancozeb** 66.7% WP at 2-2.5 g/L water.
    *   **Fosetyl-aluminium** 80% WP at 2-3 g/L water.
    *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 1-2 g/L water.
    *   **Thiophanate-methyl** 70% WP at 1-1.5 g/L water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC at 0.5-1 ml/L water.

**C. Foliar Spray (For Black Rot, Fruit Rot, Stem Rot, Neck Rot):**

*   For aerial parts of the plant, including fruits and stems, apply foliar sprays. Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.
    *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC at 0.5-1 ml/L water.
    *   **Pyraclostrobin** 20% WG at 0.5-0.75 g/L water.
    *   **Difenoconazole** 25% EC at 0.5 ml/L water.
    *   **Chlorothalonil** 75% WP at 2 g/L water.
    *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP at 2-2.5 g/L water.
    *   **Copper oxychloride** 50% WP at 2.5-3 g/L water.
    *   **Tebuconazole** 25% WG at 0.5-0.75 g/L water.
    *   **Propiconazole** 25% EC at 0.5 ml/L water.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the fungicide label regarding dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of fungicide resistance in pathogens.
*   Monitor your crop regularly for early signs of disease to initiate timely control measures.
