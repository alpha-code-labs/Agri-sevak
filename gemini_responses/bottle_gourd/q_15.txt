As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), here is the scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Bottle Gourd in Haryana:

**1. Grasshopper**
Grasshoppers are polyphagous pests that can cause significant defoliation in Bottle Gourd.
*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Regular weeding to remove potential host plants.
    *   Deep ploughing after harvest can expose grasshopper eggs, reducing future populations.
*   **Chemical Control (if infestation is severe):**
    *   Spray with **Malathion** 50% EC at 2.5 ml per litre of water (1.25 L per acre).
    *   Alternatively, spray with **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 0.5-1 ml per litre of water (200-400 ml per acre).

**2. Painted bug**
This is not known to affect Bottle Gourd.

**3. Red cotton bug**
This is not known to affect Bottle Gourd.

**4. Black ants**
Black ants are generally not direct pests of Bottle Gourd. They are often secondary pests, attracted to honeydew secreted by sap-sucking insects like aphids, whiteflies, or mealybugs, which they protect from natural enemies. If ants are observed in large numbers, it is advisable to check for the presence of these primary sap-sucking pests and manage them first.
*   **Management of associated sap-sucking pests (if present):**
    *   Spray with **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL at 0.3 ml per litre of water (60 ml per acre).
    *   Alternatively, spray with **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG at 0.2 g per litre of water (80 g per acre).
*   **Direct Ant Control (if ants are causing direct damage, such as carrying away seeds, or if nests are problematic near plants):**
    *   Drench ant nests with **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 2.5 ml per litre of water.

Always read and follow the label instructions for any chemical product, including safety precautions and pre-harvest intervals.
