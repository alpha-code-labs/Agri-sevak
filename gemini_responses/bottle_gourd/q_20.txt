As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I advise on addressing micronutrient deficiencies in Bottle Gourd based on scientific principles and practices suitable for Haryana's agro-climatic conditions.

**General Recommendations for Addressing Micronutrient Deficiencies:**

1.  **Soil Testing:** The most crucial step is to conduct a comprehensive soil test to accurately diagnose specific deficiencies and determine the exact levels of available micronutrients. This prevents unnecessary applications and potential toxicities.
2.  **Visual Symptom Identification:** While soil testing is primary, observing plant symptoms can provide initial clues. However, symptoms can sometimes be misleading or overlap with other issues.
3.  **Integrated Nutrient Management:** Promote healthy soil through adequate organic matter, balanced primary and secondary nutrient application, and proper irrigation, which enhances micronutrient availability and uptake.

Here's how to address specific micronutrient deficiencies in Bottle Gourd:

### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, small and narrow leaves (little leaf symptom), interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, often with a bronzing effect.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   Apply **Zinc sulfate heptahydrate** at 10-25 kg/acre or **Zinc sulfate monohydrate** at 7-10 kg/acre as a basal application before sowing or transplanting, especially if soil test indicates low zinc.
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray a 0.5% solution of **Zinc sulfate heptahydrate** (5 g/L of water) along with 2.5 g/L of urea (to enhance absorption) at 15-20 days after germination/transplanting, and repeat if symptoms persist.
        *   Alternatively, use **Zinc EDTA** at 1 g/L of water (0.1% solution).

### 2. Iron (Fe) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Pronounced interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, with veins remaining distinctly green. In severe cases, the entire leaf may turn yellow or white.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   In highly alkaline soils common in Haryana, soil application of inorganic iron is often ineffective. Chelated forms like **Iron EDTA** or **Iron DTPA** can be applied at 5-10 kg/acre, but this is generally expensive for field crops.
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray a 0.5-1% solution of **Ferrous sulfate** (5-10 g/L of water) along with 0.1% citric acid (1 g/L) to improve absorption. Apply 2-3 sprays at 7-10 day intervals, targeting young foliage.
        *   Alternatively, use **Iron EDTA** at 1-2 g/L of water (0.1-0.2% solution).

### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, thickening and cracking of stems and petioles, poor fruit set, malformed or cracked fruits, internal browning, and death of growing points.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   Apply **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate) at 2-4 kg/acre or **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (equivalent to 1-2 kg/acre) as a basal application. *Caution: Boron has a narrow margin between deficiency and toxicity. Do not over-apply.*
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray a 0.1-0.2% solution of **Borax** or **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (1-2 g/L of water) at the pre-flowering stage and repeat after fruit set if needed.

### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Blossom end rot in fruits (water-soaked spots at the blossom end of the fruit, which later turn dark and leathery), stunted growth, distorted new leaves, and marginal necrosis of young leaves.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   Ensure adequate soil moisture. If soil pH is low, apply **Gypsum** (Calcium sulfate) as a soil amendment. For direct calcium supply, **Calcium nitrate** can be applied through fertigation.
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray a 0.5-1% solution of **Calcium nitrate** or **Calcium chloride** (5-10 g/L of water) starting from fruit set, repeating every 7-10 days, especially during periods of rapid fruit development or high temperatures.

### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, with veins remaining green. The affected areas may turn yellow or reddish-purple, and leaves can become brittle.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   Apply **Magnesium sulfate** at 10-20 kg/acre as a basal application if soil test indicates low magnesium.
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray a 0.5-1% solution of **Magnesium sulfate** (5-10 g/L of water) when symptoms appear, repeating every 10-15 days until symptoms subside.

### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, similar to iron deficiency but often accompanied by small necrotic spots or speckling. Growth may be stunted.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   Apply **Manganese sulfate** at 10-20 kg/acre as a basal application, particularly in soils with high pH or high organic matter.
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray a 0.5% solution of **Manganese sulfate** (5 g/L of water) or **Manganese EDTA** at 1 g/L of water (0.1% solution) when symptoms appear, repeating if necessary.

**Important Considerations for Application:**

*   **Timing:** Apply foliar sprays in the early morning or late afternoon to avoid scorching and maximize absorption.
*   **Spreader/Sticker:** Always add a non-ionic surfactant (spreader/sticker) to foliar sprays to improve coverage and absorption.
*   **Water Quality:** Use clean water for all spray solutions.
*   **Compatibility:** Do not mix different micronutrient solutions or pesticides without checking their compatibility.
*   **Prevention:** Regular application of farmyard manure (FYM) or compost helps maintain soil health and micronutrient availability.

Always consult your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions.
