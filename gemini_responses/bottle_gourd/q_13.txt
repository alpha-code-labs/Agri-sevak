Dear Farmer,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing pests in Bottle Gourd in Haryana.

### Control of Fruit Fly in Bottle Gourd

Fruit fly (*Bactrocera cucurbitae*) is a major pest of Bottle Gourd and other cucurbitaceous crops, causing significant damage by laying eggs in young fruits, leading to rotting and premature fruit drop. Effective management requires an integrated approach.

**Integrated Management Strategies:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Regularly collect and destroy all infested, fallen, or damaged fruits by burying them deep in the soil or burning them. This prevents the completion of the fruit fly life cycle.
    *   **Deep Ploughing:** After harvest, deep ploughing helps expose pupae in the soil to predators and harsh weather conditions, reducing the pest population for the next season.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid continuous cultivation of cucurbit crops in the same field.
    *   **Timely Sowing:** Adjusting sowing time to avoid peak fruit fly activity can sometimes be beneficial.

2.  **Mechanical Methods:**
    *   **Fruit Bagging:** For high-value crops or small-scale cultivation, individual fruits can be covered with paper or cloth bags once they reach a certain size to prevent egg-laying.
    *   **Pheromone Traps:** Install cucurbit fruit fly pheromone traps (e.g., methyl eugenol traps or cue-lure traps) at a density of 4-5 traps per acre. These traps attract and kill male fruit flies, reducing the breeding population. Replace lures every 2-3 weeks.

3.  **Chemical Control (Use only CIBRC approved technical chemicals):**
    When pest incidence is high, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always follow label instructions and observe pre-harvest intervals (PHI).

    *   **Bait Sprays:** These are highly effective and target-specific. Prepare a bait solution and spray it on the foliage, especially on the underside of leaves, in small patches (not the entire plant).
        *   Mix **Malathion 50% EC** at 100 ml with 1 kg jaggery or molasses in 100 litres of water.
        *   Alternatively, use **Spinosad 45% SC** at 20 ml with 1 kg jaggery or molasses in 100 litres of water.
        *   Apply these bait sprays once a week, preferably in the morning.

    *   **Foliar Sprays (for severe infestations):**
        *   **Malathion 50% EC:** Apply at 2.0-2.5 ml per litre of water (1.0-1.25 litres per acre).
        *   **Dimethoate 30% EC:** Apply at 2.0 ml per litre of water (1.0 litre per acre).
        *   **Spinosad 45% SC:** Apply at 0.32-0.44 ml per litre of water (160-220 ml per acre).
        *   **Deltamethrin 2.8% EC:** Apply at 0.6-0.8 ml per litre of water (300-400 ml per acre).
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** Apply at 0.3-0.4 ml per litre of water (150-200 ml per acre).

    Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

### Control of Ber Fly in Bottle Gourd

This is not known to affect Bottle Gourd. The Ber fly (*Carpomyia vesuviana*) is a specific pest of Ber (*Ziziphus mauritiana*) fruits and does not infest Bottle Gourd.
