Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concerns regarding improving the yield, fruit quality, and storage life of Bottle Gourd (Lagenaria siceraria). Here is scientifically verified advice tailored for Haryana's conditions:

### I. Improving Yield of Bottle Gourd

To maximize your bottle gourd yield, focus on optimal cultural practices, nutrient management, and timely interventions.

1.  **Variety Selection:**
    *   Choose high-yielding, disease-resistant varieties recommended for Haryana by HAU or ICAR. Consider varieties with good fruit set and desirable fruit characteristics.

2.  **Sowing Time and Spacing:**
    *   **Spring-Summer Crop:** February-March.
    *   **Rainy Season Crop:** June-July.
    *   **Spacing:** Plant at a spacing of 2.5-3 meters between rows and 0.6-0.9 meters between plants within a row. Proper spacing ensures adequate light penetration and air circulation.

3.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Basal Application (per acre):**
        *   Farm Yard Manure (FYM): 8-10 tonnes
        *   **Urea:** 40-50 kg
        *   **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP):** 50-60 kg
        *   **Muriate of Potash (MOP):** 30-40 kg
    *   **Top Dressing (per acre):**
        *   Apply 20-25 kg **Urea** in two split doses, 30 and 45 days after sowing, especially during flowering and fruit development stages.
    *   **Micronutrients:**
        *   Foliar spray of **Zinc sulphate** (0.5%) and **Borax** (0.2%) at pre-flowering and fruit set stages can significantly improve flowering and fruit set. For example, 5 g/L **Zinc sulphate** and 2 g/L **Borax**.

4.  **Water Management:**
    *   Maintain consistent soil moisture, especially during flowering and fruit development. Irrigate every 5-7 days during summer and 8-10 days during the rainy season (if rainfall is insufficient). Avoid waterlogging.

5.  **Pollination:**
    *   Ensure adequate pollinator activity (bees). If natural pollination is poor, consider hand pollination during early morning hours for better fruit set.

6.  **Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs) for Female Flower Induction and Fruit Set:**
    *   To increase the number of female flowers and improve fruit set, consider the following:
        *   **Ethephon:** Spray 150-200 ppm (1.5-2 ml/10 litres of water) at 2-4 true leaf stage. Repeat after 7-10 days if needed. This promotes female flower production.
        *   **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA):** Spray 20-50 ppm (0.2-0.5 ml/L of water) at flowering stage to prevent flower and fruit drop and improve fruit retention.

### II. Improving Fruit Quality of Bottle Gourd

Good fruit quality involves desirable shape, size, texture, and absence of blemishes.

1.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Potassium:** Adequate potassium (from **Muriate of Potash**) is crucial for fruit development, improving fruit size, shape, and firmness.
    *   **Calcium:** Foliar spray of **Calcium nitrate** (0.5%) or **Calcium chloride** (0.5%) at fruit development stage can improve fruit firmness and reduce disorders like blossom end rot. For example, 5 g/L **Calcium nitrate**.
    *   **Boron:** As mentioned for yield, boron also prevents fruit malformation and cracking.

2.  **Water Management:**
    *   Consistent irrigation prevents fruit cracking and maintains uniform growth, leading to better-shaped fruits.

3.  **Pest and Disease Management:**
    *   Timely management of pests (e.g., fruit flies, aphids) and diseases (e.g., powdery mildew, downy mildew) prevents damage and blemishes on fruits, ensuring good market quality. Consult HAU for specific recommendations for pest/disease control.

4.  **Timely Harvesting:**
    *   Harvest fruits at the tender, immature stage when they are suitable for consumption. Over-mature fruits become fibrous and lose quality.

### III. Improving Storage Life of Bottle Gourd

Bottle gourd has a relatively short shelf life. These practices can help extend it.

1.  **Harvesting at Proper Maturity:**
    *   Harvest fruits when they are tender, bright green, and have a smooth skin. Avoid harvesting over-mature or damaged fruits. Use a sharp knife or secateurs to cut the fruit with a small portion of the stalk attached.

2.  **Careful Handling:**
    *   Minimize physical damage (bruising, cuts) during harvesting and transport, as damaged fruits spoil faster.

3.  **Pre-cooling:**
    *   Immediately after harvest, remove field heat by placing fruits in a cool, shaded area or using forced-air cooling if available. This slows down respiration and ripening.

4.  **Cleaning and Drying:**
    *   Gently wash fruits to remove dirt and debris. Ensure they are thoroughly air-dried before storage to prevent fungal growth.

5.  **Post-Harvest Treatments:**
    *   **Sodium hypochlorite:** A dip in 100-200 ppm **Sodium hypochlorite** solution (e.g., 1-2 ml of 4% solution per litre of water) for 2-3 minutes can disinfect the fruit surface and reduce microbial spoilage. Rinse with clean water and dry.
    *   **Calcium chloride:** A post-harvest dip in 1-2% **Calcium chloride** solution for 5-10 minutes can help maintain fruit firmness and reduce physiological disorders. For example, 10-20 g/L **Calcium chloride**.

6.  **Storage Conditions:**
    *   **Temperature:** Store bottle gourds at a cool temperature, ideally between 10-13°C. Temperatures below 7°C can cause chilling injury.
    *   **Humidity:** Maintain high relative humidity (90-95%) to prevent moisture loss and shriveling.
    *   **Ventilation:** Ensure good air circulation to prevent accumulation of ethylene and reduce spoilage.

7.  **Packaging:**
    *   Pack fruits in well-ventilated crates or baskets to prevent bruising and allow air circulation. Avoid overcrowding.

By implementing these practices diligently, you can significantly improve the yield, quality, and storage life of your bottle gourd crop, leading to better returns for your hard work. For any specific queries or further assistance, please feel free to contact the experts at HAU, Hisar.
