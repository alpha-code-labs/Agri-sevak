As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following doses of organic manures for Bottle Gourd cultivation in Haryana, based on scientific principles and common agricultural practices:

*   **Farm Yard Manure (FYM):**
    *   Apply **10,000 - 15,000 kg per acre** (10-15 tonnes per acre) during land preparation, at least 2-3 weeks before sowing or transplanting. Ensure it is well-decomposed.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   Apply **2,000 - 4,000 kg per acre** (2-4 tonnes per acre) during land preparation, or as a top dressing around the plants during early growth stages.

*   **Sagarika:**
    *   **Sagarika** is a seaweed extract-based bio-stimulant. It is typically applied as a foliar spray or soil drench.
        *   **Foliar Spray:** Mix **2.5 - 5 ml per litre** of water and spray at critical growth stages (e.g., vegetative growth, pre-flowering, fruit development).
        *   **Soil Drench/Drip Application:** Apply **500 ml - 1 litre per acre** mixed with irrigation water, particularly during active growth phases.

**Important Note:** For precise recommendations, it is always advisable to conduct a soil test to understand the specific nutrient status of your field. This allows for tailored nutrient management plans.
