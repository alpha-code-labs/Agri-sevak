As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified strategies for controlling fungal diseases in Bottle Gourd (Lagenaria siceraria) in Haryana. It is crucial to adopt an Integrated Disease Management (IDM) approach, combining cultural practices with judicious use of CIBRC-approved fungicides.

**General Cultural Practices for Disease Management:**

*   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris immediately.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting Bottle Gourd or other cucurbits in the same field for at least 2-3 years.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available, choose disease-resistant or tolerant varieties.
*   **Seed Treatment:** Use certified disease-free seeds or treat seeds with recommended fungicides.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to improve air circulation and reduce humidity within the canopy.
*   **Water Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day, to minimize leaf wetness. Drip irrigation is preferred.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced fertilizers to maintain plant vigor, as stressed plants are more susceptible to diseases.
*   **Field Monitoring:** Regularly inspect plants for early signs of disease to enable timely intervention.

Here are the specific recommendations for the mentioned diseases:

### 1. Alternaria Leaf Spot (Alternaria cucumerina)

**Symptoms:** Small, circular, water-soaked spots that enlarge, become angular, brown, and often develop concentric rings (target spot) on leaves. Severe infection can lead to defoliation.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural:** Practice good field sanitation, remove infected leaves, and ensure proper plant spacing.
*   **Chemical:**
    *   Spray with **Mancozeb** at 2-2.5 g/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, use **Chlorothalonil** at 2 g/L of water.
    *   For systemic action, **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5-1 ml/L of water or **Tebuconazole** at 0.75-1 ml/L of water can be effective.
    *   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent resistance.

### 2. Anthracnose (Colletotrichum lagenarium / Colletotrichum orbiculare)

**Symptoms:** Angular, dark spots on leaves; sunken, circular, dark lesions on fruits, often with pinkish spore masses in humid conditions; stem cankers.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural:** Use disease-free seeds, practice crop rotation, and remove infected plant material.
*   **Chemical:**
    *   Spray with **Carbendazim** at 0.5-1 g/L of water.
    *   **Mancozeb** at 2-2.5 g/L of water can be used as a protectant.
    *   **Chlorothalonil** at 2 g/L of water is also effective.
    *   For systemic control, **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5-1 ml/L of water or **Difenoconazole** at 0.5 ml/L of water can be applied.
    *   Ensure thorough coverage, especially on fruits.

### 3. Blast

This is not known to affect Bottle Gourd. Blast disease is primarily associated with cereal crops like rice and wheat.

### 4. Blight (Phytophthora Blight - Phytophthora capsici)

**Symptoms:** This can manifest as damping-off of seedlings, water-soaked lesions on leaves, stems, and fruits, leading to rapid wilting and collapse of the plant. Fruit rot is common.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural:** Ensure good soil drainage, avoid waterlogging, and practice crop rotation. Avoid overhead irrigation.
*   **Chemical:**
    *   Spray with **Propamocarb hydrochloride** at 2-3 ml/L of water.
    *   A combination product containing **Mancozeb** and **Cymoxanil** (e.g., 2.5 g/L of water for the combination product) is also effective.
    *   **Dimethomorph** (often in combination with other fungicides) at 0.5-1 g/L of water can be used.
    *   **Fenamidone** (often in combination) at 0.5-1 ml/L of water.

### 5. Brown Spot

This is not known as a distinct disease affecting Bottle Gourd. Symptoms described as "brown spot" are often indicative of other leaf spot diseases like Alternaria or Anthracnose, for which control measures are provided above.

### 6. Downy Mildew (Pseudoperonospora cubensis)

**Symptoms:** Angular, yellow spots on the upper surface of leaves, often delimited by veins. On the lower surface, purplish-grey, fuzzy fungal growth can be observed, especially in humid conditions.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural:** Use resistant varieties if available, ensure proper plant spacing, and avoid overhead irrigation.
*   **Chemical:**
    *   Spray with **Mancozeb** at 2-2.5 g/L of water as a protectant.
    *   For systemic control, **Propamocarb hydrochloride** at 2-3 ml/L of water.
    *   Combination products containing **Mancozeb** and **Cymoxanil** (e.g., 2.5 g/L of water for the combination product) are highly effective.
    *   **Dimethomorph** (often in combination) at 0.5-1 g/L of water.
    *   **Fenamidone** (often in combination) at 0.5-1 ml/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5-1 ml/L of water also provides good control.

### 7. Powdery Mildew (Podosphaera xanthii / Erysiphe cichoracearum)

**Symptoms:** White, powdery patches on the upper and lower surfaces of leaves, stems, and petioles. Severely infected leaves may turn yellow, become brittle, and die prematurely.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural:** Use resistant varieties, remove infected plant debris, and ensure good air circulation.
*   **Chemical:**
    *   Spray with wettable **Sulphur** at 2-3 g/L of water (avoid application during very hot weather).
    *   **Myclobutanil** at 0.4-0.6 g/L of water.
    *   **Penconazole** at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5-1 ml/L of water.
    *   **Tebuconazole** at 0.75-1 ml/L of water.

### 8. Grey Mildew

This is not known as a distinct disease affecting Bottle Gourd. Symptoms described as "grey mildew" might be confused with the greyish growth of Downy Mildew or general grey mold (Botrytis cinerea), which is less common as a primary field disease in Bottle Gourd in Haryana.

**Important Considerations for Chemical Application:**

*   Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the fungicide label for correct dosage, application timing, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and safety precautions.
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action (FRAC codes) to prevent the development of fungicide resistance in pathogens.
*   Ensure thorough spray coverage of all plant parts, especially the undersides of leaves.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and application.
