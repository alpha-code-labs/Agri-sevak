As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding dropping in Bottle Gourd. This is a common physiological issue that can significantly reduce yield.

First, let's clarify the terminology:
*   **Flower drop** and **Fruit drop** are common issues in Bottle Gourd.
*   **Tinda dropping** refers to fruit drop in Tinda (Indian Round Gourd, *Praecitrullus fistulosus*), which is a different crop.
*   **Boll dropping** refers to the shedding of cotton bolls and is not applicable to Bottle Gourd.

Therefore, this advice will focus on controlling flower and fruit drop in Bottle Gourd.

**Understanding Flower and Fruit Drop in Bottle Gourd**

Flower and fruit drop are often symptoms of underlying stress or imbalances within the plant. Key causes include:

1.  **Environmental Stress:**
    *   **Temperature Extremes:** Very high (above 35°C) or very low (below 15°C) temperatures can impair pollen viability, fertilization, and fruit development.
    *   **Humidity:** Very low humidity can lead to desiccation of pollen and stigmas, while very high humidity can hinder pollen dispersal.
    *   **Light Intensity:** Insufficient light can reduce photosynthesis, leading to nutrient scarcity for fruit development.
2.  **Nutritional Imbalances:**
    *   **Deficiencies:** Lack of essential micronutrients like Boron, Calcium, and Molybdenum, or macronutrients like Phosphorus and Potassium, can severely affect flower formation, pollen viability, fertilization, and fruit retention.
    *   **Excess Nutrients:** Over-application of nitrogen can lead to excessive vegetative growth at the expense of reproductive development, causing flowers and young fruits to drop.
3.  **Pollination Issues:**
    *   **Lack of Pollinators:** Bottle Gourd flowers are primarily insect-pollinated (bees). Insufficient pollinator activity can lead to unfertilized flowers, which then drop.
    *   **Non-viable Pollen:** Pollen viability can be affected by environmental stress or nutritional deficiencies.
    *   **Male-to-Female Flower Ratio:** An imbalance, especially too many male flowers and too few female flowers, can limit fruit set.
4.  **Water Management:**
    *   **Water Stress (Drought):** Insufficient moisture can lead to wilting and shedding of flowers and young fruits as the plant conserves resources.
    *   **Waterlogging:** Excess water can damage roots, impair nutrient uptake, and create anaerobic conditions, leading to stress and dropping.
5.  **Hormonal Imbalance:**
    *   An imbalance of plant hormones (e.g., auxins, gibberellins, ethylene) can trigger abscission (shedding) of flowers and fruits.

**Recommended Control Measures for Flower and Fruit Drop in Bottle Gourd**

An integrated approach combining good agronomic practices, nutritional management, and judicious use of plant growth regulators is most effective.

**I. Agronomic and Cultural Practices:**

1.  **Optimal Water Management:**
    *   Maintain consistent soil moisture, especially during flowering and fruiting stages.
    *   Irrigate regularly, particularly during dry spells, but avoid waterlogging. Furrow irrigation or drip irrigation is recommended.
2.  **Balanced Nutrient Management:**
    *   Conduct a soil test to determine nutrient status and apply fertilizers based on recommendations.
    *   Avoid excessive nitrogen application, which promotes vegetative growth over reproductive growth.
    *   Ensure adequate supply of Phosphorus and Potassium.
3.  **Enhance Pollination:**
    *   Encourage natural pollinators by planting flowering plants nearby or placing bee hives in the vicinity.
    *   In areas with low pollinator activity, consider hand pollination, especially for early fruit set. This involves transferring pollen from male flowers to female flowers using a soft brush in the morning hours.
4.  **Temperature Regulation:**
    *   For early or late season crops, consider using mulches (straw, plastic) to moderate soil temperature and conserve moisture.
    *   Ensure proper plant spacing for air circulation.
5.  **Pruning (if necessary):**
    *   In some vigorous varieties, light pruning of excessive vegetative growth can redirect energy towards fruit development.

**II. Nutritional Supplementation (Foliar Application):**

Foliar sprays can quickly address micronutrient deficiencies that contribute to dropping.

*   **Boron:** Crucial for pollen germination, pollen tube growth, and fruit set.
    *   Apply **Disodium tetraborate decahydrate (Borax)** or **Boric acid** at 1.5-2.0 g/L of water. Spray at pre-flowering and early fruit set stages.
*   **Calcium:** Important for cell wall integrity, fruit development, and stress tolerance.
    *   Apply **Calcium nitrate** at 5.0 g/L of water. Spray during flowering and fruit development.
*   **Potassium:** Essential for overall plant health, water regulation, and fruit quality.
    *   If potassium deficiency is suspected, apply **Potassium nitrate** at 5.0-10.0 g/L of water.

**III. Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs):**

PGRs can help regulate hormonal balance and reduce dropping, but should be used judiciously and at recommended concentrations.

*   **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA):** An auxin that helps prevent abscission (shedding) of flowers and young fruits.
    *   Apply **Naphthalene Acetic Acid** at 10-20 mg/L (10-20 ppm) of water. Spray at the peak flowering stage and again at early fruit set.
*   **Gibberellic Acid (GA3):** Can promote fruit growth and reduce dropping, but high concentrations can lead to undesirable effects.
    *   Apply **Gibberellic Acid** at 5-10 mg/L (5-10 ppm) of water. Use cautiously, primarily at early flowering or fruit set, if recommended for your specific variety.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the manufacturer's instructions for all chemical products.
*   Ensure thorough spray coverage for foliar applications.
*   Spray during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to maximize absorption and minimize phytotoxicity.
*   Combine these measures for the best results.

By implementing these scientifically verified practices, you can effectively manage and reduce flower and fruit drop in your Bottle Gourd crop, leading to improved yields.
