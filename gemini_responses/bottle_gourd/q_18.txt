As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified recommendations for the use of growth regulators and micronutrients in Bottle Gourd in Haryana:

*   **Ethephon** (Technical name for Ethrel):
    *   **Purpose:** To promote female flower production, leading to increased fruit set and yield.
    *   **Recommended Dose:** Apply **Ethephon** (39% SL formulation) at a concentration of 0.25-0.65 ml per litre of water (equivalent to 100-250 ppm).
    *   **Application Timing:** First spray at the 2-4 true leaf stage, followed by a second spray 7-10 days later. Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.

*   **2,4-D**:
    *   This is not known to affect Bottle Gourd as a recommended growth regulator. 2,4-D is primarily a selective herbicide, and its use as a growth regulator in Bottle Gourd is not a standard or recommended practice due to the narrow margin between beneficial and phytotoxic concentrations.

*   **Boron** (Applied as Borax):
    *   **Purpose:** While not a hormone, Boron is an essential micronutrient critical for pollen germination, fruit set, and overall plant development in Bottle Gourd. Its deficiency can lead to poor fruit set and malformed fruits.
    *   **Recommended Dose:** Foliar application of **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate, typically 10.5% Boron) at a concentration of 1-2 g per litre of water.
    *   **Application Timing:** Apply at the flowering and early fruit setting stages to ensure adequate Boron availability for pollen viability and fruit development.
