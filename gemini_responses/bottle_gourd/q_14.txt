As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an integrated approach for managing soil pests like termites and nematodes in Bottle Gourd, combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods.

**General Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Principles:**

*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy crop residues, weeds, and debris that can harbor pests.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** Exposes soil pests to predators and sunlight, reducing their populations.
*   **Soil Solarization:** Covering moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets during hot summer months (4-6 weeks) can significantly reduce soil-borne pests, including nematodes and termites.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate Bottle Gourd with non-host crops (e.g., cereals like wheat, maize) to break the pest life cycle.

### **1. Control of Termites (Dimag) in Bottle Gourd**

Termites can cause significant damage by feeding on roots and stems, leading to wilting and plant death.

**A. Cultural and Preventive Measures:**

*   Ensure good field sanitation and remove any woody debris or stubble that can attract termites.
*   Avoid planting in fields with a known history of severe termite infestation without proper soil treatment.
*   Maintain adequate soil moisture, as termites prefer dry conditions.

**B. Chemical Control (Pre-sowing/At Sowing):**

For effective control, soil treatment is crucial before or at the time of sowing/planting.

*   **Soil Drenching/Mixing:**
    *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC:** Apply 2.5 - 4.0 Litres per acre mixed with sufficient water (e.g., 200-400 Litres) as a soil drench or through irrigation channels before sowing or at the time of transplanting.
    *   **Fipronil 0.3% GR:** Apply 6-8 kg per acre by broadcasting and mixing into the soil before sowing or at the time of planting.

### **2. Control of Nematodes (Root-knot Nematodes - *Meloidogyne* spp.) in Bottle Gourd**

Root-knot nematodes are a major problem, causing galls on roots, stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, and reduced yield.

**A. Cultural and Preventive Measures:**

*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate Bottle Gourd with non-host crops such as marigold (Tagetes spp.), mustard, or cereals for at least 2-3 years.
*   **Soil Solarization:** As mentioned above, this is highly effective against nematodes.
*   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporate well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost (10-15 tonnes/acre) and neem cake (200-400 kg/acre) into the soil 2-3 weeks before planting. Neem cake has nematicidal properties.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** If available and suitable for your region, choose Bottle Gourd varieties with resistance to root-knot nematodes.

**B. Biological Control:**

*   **Bio-nematicides:**
    *   **Purpureocillium lilacinum (formerly Paecilomyces lilacinus):** Apply 2.5 kg per acre mixed with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed FYM or compost. Apply this mixture to the soil before sowing or at the time of transplanting. This fungus parasitizes nematode eggs and females.
    *   **Trichoderma harzianum/viride:** While primarily a bio-fungicide, some strains can help suppress nematode populations indirectly by improving plant health and competing with pathogens. Apply 2.5 kg per acre mixed with FYM.

**C. Chemical Control (Nematicides):**

Chemical nematicides should be used judiciously and as part of an integrated approach, especially in fields with high nematode populations.

*   **At Sowing/Planting:**
    *   **Carbofuran 3% GR:** Apply 10-12 kg per acre by broadcasting and mixing into the soil at the time of sowing or transplanting.
    *   **Phorate 10% GR:** Apply 4-6 kg per acre by broadcasting and mixing into the soil at the time of sowing or transplanting.
    *   **Fluensulfone 2% GR:** Apply 10-15 kg per acre by broadcasting and mixing into the soil at the time of sowing or transplanting. This is a newer, effective nematicide.

*   **Post-Emergence (as drench/through drip):**
    *   **Oxamyl 24% SL:** Apply 1-2 Litres per acre as a soil drench around the root zone of established plants or through drip irrigation.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label for dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) when handling chemicals.
*   Consult your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and pest severity.
