As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm that Wilt (both pathogenic and physiological) is a significant concern for Bottle Gourd cultivation in Haryana. Effective management requires an integrated approach.

Here's how to control Wilt (including Parawilt) in Bottle Gourd:

**1. Wilt (Pathogenic Wilt - Fungal Wilt, Bacterial Wilt)**
Pathogenic wilts are caused by microorganisms such as fungi (*Fusarium oxysporum* f.sp. *lagenariae*) or bacteria (*Erwinia tracheiphila*, *Pseudomonas solanacearum*).

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Implement a 2-3 year crop rotation with non-cucurbit crops to reduce the build-up of soil-borne pathogens.
    *   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available and suitable for Haryana conditions, select and plant Bottle Gourd varieties known for their resistance to wilt diseases.
    *   **Soil Solarization:** During hot summer months, cover moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks to reduce soil-borne pathogen populations.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Promptly remove and destroy infected plants, including their roots, to prevent further spread of the disease.
    *   **Good Drainage:** Ensure proper field drainage to avoid waterlogging, which can create anaerobic conditions favorable for some pathogens and stress plants.
    *   **Balanced Nutrition:** Apply balanced fertilizers based on soil test recommendations. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can make plants more susceptible to diseases.
    *   **Deep Ploughing:** Expose soil to sunlight during fallow periods to help reduce pathogen inoculum.

*   **Biological Control:**
    *   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds with bio-agents before sowing.
        *   **_Trichoderma viride_** or **_Trichoderma harzianum_**: 4-6 g/kg seed.
        *   **_Pseudomonas fluorescens_**: 10 g/kg seed.
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply bio-agents to the soil at planting or as a drench.
        *   **_Trichoderma viride_** or **_Trichoderma harzianum_**: 2.5 kg/acre mixed with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or vermicompost, applied near the root zone.
        *   **_Pseudomonas fluorescens_**: 2.5 kg/acre mixed with 50-100 kg FYM or vermicompost.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Seed Treatment (for Fungal Wilt):**
        *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: 2 g/kg seed.
        *   **Thiram** 75% WS: 2.5 g/kg seed.
    *   **Seed Treatment (for Bacterial Wilt):**
        *   **Streptomycin sulphate** 9% + **Tetracycline hydrochloride** 1% SP: 1 g/L of water for 30 minutes seed soaking.
    *   **Soil Drenching (for Fungal Wilt):**
        *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: 1-2 g/L of water, 200-250 ml solution per plant, applied at the base.
        *   **Copper oxychloride** 50% WP: 2-3 g/L of water, 200-250 ml solution per plant, applied at the base.
    *   **Soil Drenching (for Bacterial Wilt):**
        *   **Streptomycin sulphate** 9% + **Tetracycline hydrochloride** 1% SP: 0.5-1 g/L of water, 200-250 ml solution per plant, applied at the base.

**2. Parawilt (Physiological Wilt)**
Parawilt is a non-pathogenic disorder, often triggered by sudden environmental stresses such as high temperatures, fluctuating soil moisture (e.g., waterlogging followed by drought), or root damage.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Consistent Irrigation:** Maintain uniform soil moisture. Avoid extremes of waterlogging and drought. Irrigate regularly, especially during hot and dry periods, to prevent water stress.
    *   **Mulching:** Apply organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves, crop residues) around the base of plants. This helps conserve soil moisture, regulate soil temperature, and suppress weeds.
    *   **Avoid Root Damage:** Exercise caution during intercultural operations (weeding, hoeing) to prevent injury to the root system, which can predispose plants to parawilt.
    *   **Improve Soil Structure:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure or compost into the soil to improve its water-holding capacity, drainage, and overall structure.
    *   **Shading:** During peak summer heat, provide temporary shading (e.g., using shade nets) to reduce heat stress on plants.
    *   **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to reduce competition for water and nutrients, allowing for better air circulation.

*   **Note:** As Parawilt is a physiological disorder and not caused by a pathogen, there are no specific chemical or biological controls. Management focuses entirely on mitigating environmental stresses through cultural practices.
