Dear farmer,

Controlling sucking pests like aphids, leafhoppers, whiteflies, and thrips is crucial for healthy Bottle Gourd cultivation in Haryana. These pests can cause significant yield losses by directly feeding on plant sap, transmitting viral diseases, and promoting sooty mold growth. Here's a comprehensive approach based on scientific recommendations from Haryana Agricultural University:

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Sucking Pests in Bottle Gourd:**

A combination of cultural, biological, and chemical methods is most effective for sustainable pest management.

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Regularly remove weeds from and around the field, as they can act as alternate hosts for these pests. Remove and destroy crop residues after harvest.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, as it promotes lush, soft growth that is more attractive to sucking pests.
*   **Water Management:** Ensure proper irrigation to maintain plant vigor, as stressed plants are more susceptible.
*   **Reflective Mulches:** Using silver-colored plastic mulches between rows can deter whiteflies and aphids by reflecting sunlight.
*   **Timely Sowing:** Adjust sowing time to avoid peak pest periods if possible, based on local pest incidence data.
*   **Yellow Sticky Traps:** Install yellow sticky traps (10-12 traps per acre) to monitor pest populations and trap adult whiteflies, aphids, and leafhoppers.

**2. Biological Control:**
*   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Protect and encourage natural predators like ladybird beetles, lacewings, hoverfly larvae, and parasitoids (e.g., *Aphidius* species) that feed on aphids and whiteflies. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.
*   **Biopesticides:**
    *   Spray **Azadirachtin** 1500 ppm @ 5 ml/L of water, especially during early stages of infestation or as a preventive measure.

**3. Chemical Control (When pest population crosses Economic Threshold Level - ETL):**
When pest populations are high and cultural/biological methods are insufficient, judicious use of CIBRC-approved insecticides is necessary. Always rotate chemicals with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

*   **For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips:**
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL @ 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG @ 0.2 g/L of water.
    *   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP @ 0.2 g/L of water.
    *   **Flonicamid** 50% WG @ 0.3 g/L of water (effective against aphids and whiteflies).
    *   **Buprofezin** 25% SC @ 1.25 ml/L of water (specifically targets whitefly nymphs).
    *   **Spiromesifen** 22.9% SC @ 0.5 ml/L of water (effective against whiteflies and mites).

**Regarding Psylla:**
This is not known to affect Bottle Gourd.

**Important Considerations for Chemical Application:**
*   **Rotation:** Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.
*   **Timing:** Apply insecticides during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where many sucking pests reside.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Strictly observe the specified Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) for each chemical to ensure the safety of the produce.
*   **Safety:** Always use personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, and protective clothing, and follow all instructions on the product label.

Regular scouting of your Bottle Gourd crop is key to timely intervention and effective pest management.
