As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in Bottle Gourd in Haryana:

### Control of Borers in Bottle Gourd

Borers, particularly the Cucurbit Fruit Fly (*Bactrocera cucurbitae*), are a significant pest in Bottle Gourd. Stem borers can also occasionally occur.

*   **Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
    *   Regularly collect and destroy all infested and fallen fruits to break the pest life cycle.
    *   Use pheromone traps or homemade bait traps (e.g., mixing jaggery/molasses with a small amount of insecticide) to attract and kill adult fruit flies.
    *   Bagging individual fruits with paper or cloth bags can protect them from fruit fly oviposition.
*   **Chemical Control (for severe infestations):**
    *   **Malathion 50% EC**: Apply as a bait spray at 1-2 ml/L of water, mixed with jaggery solution, on leaves (not directly on fruits) to attract and kill adult fruit flies.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC**: Apply at 200-250 ml per acre.
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC**: Apply at 60 ml per acre.

### Control of Caterpillars in Bottle Gourd

Various caterpillar species (e.g., Tobacco Caterpillar, Semiloopers) can infest Bottle Gourd, feeding on leaves and sometimes fruits.

*   **Cultural and Biological Control:**
    *   Regularly scout for and hand-pick visible larvae and egg masses, then destroy them.
    *   Encourage natural enemies like parasitic wasps and predatory bugs.
    *   Apply formulations of *Bacillus thuringiensis* (Bt) as per manufacturer's instructions, which is effective against young larvae.
*   **Chemical Control (for severe infestations):**
    *   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG**: Apply at 80-100 g per acre.
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC**: Apply at 60 ml per acre.
    *   **Flubendiamide 20% WG**: Apply at 60 g per acre.
    *   **Indoxacarb 14.5% SC**: Apply at 200 ml per acre.
    *   **Spinosad 45% SC**: Apply at 60-75 ml per acre.

### Control of Diamondback Moth in Bottle Gourd

*   This is not known to affect Bottle Gourd. Diamondback moth (*Plutella xylostella*) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower, mustard).

### Control of Leaf Folder in Bottle Gourd

Leaf folders can cause damage by folding leaves and feeding from within.

*   **Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
    *   Regularly inspect plants and hand-pick and destroy folded leaves containing larvae.
*   **Chemical Control (for severe infestations):**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC**: Apply at 60 ml per acre.
    *   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG**: Apply at 80-100 g per acre.
    *   **Flubendiamide 20% WG**: Apply at 60 g per acre.
    *   **Indoxacarb 14.5% SC**: Apply at 200 ml per acre.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC**: Apply at 200-250 ml per acre.

**General Recommendations:**

*   Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the pesticide label regarding dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance in pests.
*   Adopt an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods for sustainable pest control.
*   For specific local conditions and the most current recommendations, always consult your nearest Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or the agricultural extension office.
