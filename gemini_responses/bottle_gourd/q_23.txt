As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified seed and soil treatment processes for Bottle Gourd cultivation in Haryana:

### Seed Treatment for Bottle Gourd

Seed treatment is crucial for protecting young seedlings from seed-borne and early soil-borne diseases, improving germination, and providing initial protection against sucking pests.

**Recommended Treatments:**

1.  **Fungicidal Seed Treatment (for protection against damping-off, seed rot, and early blight):**
    *   **Option 1 (Broad-spectrum):** Treat seeds with **Thiram** 75% WS at a rate of **2.5-3 g/kg of seed**.
    *   **Option 2 (Systemic):** Treat seeds with **Carbendazim** 50% WP at a rate of **1-2 g/kg of seed**.
    *   **Option 3 (For Oomycetes):** For areas with a history of damping-off caused by *Pythium* or *Phytophthora*, treat seeds with **Metalaxyl-M** 31.8% ES at a rate of **3-4 ml/kg of seed**.

2.  **Insecticidal Seed Treatment (for early protection against sucking pests like aphids, jassids, and whiteflies):**
    *   Treat seeds with **Imidacloprid** 48% FS at a rate of **5-7 ml/kg of seed**.

3.  **Bio-fungicidal Seed Treatment (for enhanced protection against soil-borne diseases and plant growth promotion):**
    *   After chemical treatment (if used) and drying, treat seeds with *Trichoderma viride* (1% WP formulation) at a rate of **4-5 g/kg of seed**.

**Application Process:**
*   First, apply the fungicidal chemical treatment, ensuring uniform coating.
*   Then, apply the insecticidal chemical treatment.
*   Allow the seeds to dry in the shade for a few hours.
*   If using *Trichoderma viride*, apply it last, ensuring the seeds are slightly moist for better adhesion, and then dry again in the shade before sowing.

### Soil Treatment for Bottle Gourd

Soil treatment aims to manage soil-borne diseases, nematodes, and soil-dwelling insect pests, contributing to a healthy root environment.

**Recommended Treatments:**

1.  **Bio-fungicidal and Bio-nematicidal Soil Treatment (highly recommended for sustainable management and soil health):**
    *   **For Soil-borne Diseases:** Mix *Trichoderma viride* (1% WP formulation) at a rate of **2.5 kg/acre** with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost.
    *   **For Nematodes and Disease Suppression:** Mix *Pseudomonas fluorescens* (1% WP formulation) at a rate of **2.5 kg/acre** with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed FYM or compost.
    *   **Application:** Broadcast the mixture evenly over the field and incorporate it into the soil 7-10 days before planting, or apply it directly into the planting pits/furrows.

2.  **Chemical Soil Treatment (for specific pest or disease problems, to be used judiciously):**
    *   **For Nematodes and Soil Insects (e.g., white grubs):** Apply **Fipronil** 0.3% GR at a rate of **10-15 kg/acre** at the time of planting. This can be applied in furrows or around the base of the plants.
    *   **For Soil Insects (e.g., cutworms, termites):** Apply **Cartap hydrochloride** 4% G at a rate of **7.5-10 kg/acre** at the time of planting, incorporated into the soil.
    *   **For Soil-borne Fungal Diseases (e.g., wilt, root rot, damping-off, if severe history):**
        *   **Drenching with Carbendazim:** For wilt and root rot, drench the soil around the plant base with a solution of **Carbendazim** 50% WP at **1-2 g/L of water**.
        *   **Drenching with Metalaxyl-M:** For damping-off and root rot caused by oomycetes, drench the soil around the plant base with a solution of **Metalaxyl-M** 31.8% ES at **1-2 ml/L of water**.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label for safe and effective use.
*   Ensure proper soil moisture for optimal activity of bio-agents.
*   Integrated Pest and Disease Management (IPDM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods, is highly recommended for sustainable Bottle Gourd cultivation.
*   Consult your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and pest/disease history.
