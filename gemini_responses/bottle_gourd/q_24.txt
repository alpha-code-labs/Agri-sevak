As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for Bottle Gourd transplantation in Haryana:

### Ideal Transplantation Time for Bottle Gourd

Bottle Gourd is a warm-season crop and is typically transplanted during two main periods in Haryana to avoid frost and ensure optimal growth:

*   **Spring-Summer Crop:** Seedlings are transplanted from **February to March**. This allows the crop to establish before the intense summer heat and mature during the warmer months.
*   **Rainy (Kharif) Crop:** Seedlings are transplanted from **June to July**, coinciding with the onset of the monsoon.

### Ideal Transplantation Distance for Bottle Gourd

The ideal spacing depends on the variety's vigor and the training system (ground sprawling or trellis/pandal system).

*   **For Ground Sprawling:**
    *   Row-to-row: **3.0 - 4.0 meters**
    *   Plant-to-plant: **1.0 - 1.5 meters**
*   **For Trellis/Pandal System:**
    *   Row-to-row: **2.5 - 3.5 meters**
    *   Plant-to-plant: **0.6 - 1.0 meters**

### Ideal Transplantation Process for Bottle Gourd

Transplanting bottle gourd seedlings, rather than direct sowing, often leads to better germination, uniform stand, and earlier fruiting.

1.  **Nursery Preparation:**
    *   Sow seeds in polybags (10 cm x 15 cm) or seedling trays filled with a well-drained potting mix (e.g., soil, sand, and farmyard manure in 1:1:1 ratio). Sow 1-2 seeds per polybag/cell.
    *   Ensure good drainage and provide adequate moisture.
2.  **Seedling Age:**
    *   Seedlings are ready for transplanting when they are **3-4 weeks old** or have developed **2-4 true leaves**.
3.  **Hardening Off:**
    *   About a week before transplanting, gradually expose the seedlings to outdoor conditions (reduced watering, increased sunlight) to acclimatize them to the field environment and reduce transplant shock.
4.  **Field Preparation:**
    *   Select a well-drained, fertile loamy soil.
    *   Plough the field thoroughly to a depth of 20-30 cm, followed by harrowing to achieve a fine tilth.
    *   Prepare pits or beds at the recommended spacing. For pits, dig holes of approximately 45 cm x 45 cm x 45 cm.
    *   Incorporate 10-15 kg of well-rotted farmyard manure (FYM) or compost per pit/bed, along with recommended basal doses of fertilizers, and mix well with the soil.
5.  **Transplanting Technique:**
    *   Transplant seedlings preferably in the **late afternoon or on a cloudy day** to minimize wilting and transplant shock.
    *   Carefully remove the seedling from the polybag/tray, ensuring the root ball remains intact.
    *   Place the seedling in the prepared pit/bed, ensuring the root collar is at the same level as it was in the nursery.
    *   Gently firm the soil around the base of the seedling to ensure good root-to-soil contact.
6.  **Post-Transplantation Care:**
    *   Immediately after transplanting, provide a light irrigation to settle the soil around the roots.
    *   Protect young seedlings from strong winds and intense direct sunlight if necessary, especially during the initial few days.
    *   Monitor for pests and diseases and manage them promptly.
    *   Maintain consistent soil moisture through regular irrigation.
