As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide scientifically verified advice on addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies in Bottle Gourd (Lagenaria siceraria) for Haryana.

It is crucial to emphasize that **soil testing is the most accurate method** to determine specific nutrient deficiencies and the precise quantities required. Without a soil test, recommendations are general and based on typical requirements for Bottle Gourd in Haryana.

Here's how to address deficiencies of Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K):

### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** General yellowing of older leaves (chlorosis), stunted growth, reduced fruit set, and pale green foliage.

**Corrective Measures:**
*   **Basal Application (at planting/sowing):**
    *   Apply 20-25 kg Nitrogen per acre. This can be supplied through:
        *   **Urea** (approx. 45-55 kg/acre)
        *   **Di-Ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (provides N and P, adjust other N sources accordingly)
*   **Top-Dressing (after 3-4 weeks of sowing and subsequent intervals):**
    *   Apply 20-25 kg Nitrogen per acre in 2-3 split doses, especially during vegetative growth and fruit development stages.
    *   **Urea** (approx. 45-55 kg/acre per split dose)
    *   **Calcium Nitrate** (can be used for quick N supply, approx. 50-60 kg/acre per split dose, also provides Calcium)
*   **Foliar Application (for quick recovery from severe deficiency):**
    *   Spray 0.5-1% solution of **Urea** (5-10 g/L of water). Repeat after 7-10 days if needed.
    *   Alternatively, **Potassium Nitrate** (provides N and K) can be used at 0.5-1% (5-10 g/L of water).

### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Stunted growth, dark green or purplish discoloration of older leaves, poor root development, delayed maturity, and reduced fruit size.

**Corrective Measures:**
*   **Basal Application (at planting/sowing):**
    *   Apply 20-25 kg Phosphorus (P2O5) per acre. This is best applied at the time of land preparation or sowing as phosphorus is less mobile in the soil.
    *   **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (approx. 125-150 kg/acre)
    *   **Di-Ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (approx. 45-55 kg/acre, also provides Nitrogen, so adjust N application accordingly)
*   **Note:** Foliar application of phosphorus is generally less effective for correcting severe deficiencies due to poor absorption. However, for mild deficiencies or as a supplement:
    *   Spray **Monoammonium Phosphate (MAP)** or **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)** at 0.5% (5 g/L of water).

### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Yellowing and scorching of leaf margins (especially older leaves), weak stems, poor fruit development, reduced disease resistance, and overall stunted growth.

**Corrective Measures:**
*   **Basal Application (at planting/sowing):**
    *   Apply 20-25 kg Potassium (K2O) per acre.
    *   **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** (approx. 35-40 kg/acre)
    *   **Sulphate of Potash (SOP)** (approx. 40-50 kg/acre, also provides Sulphur)
*   **Top-Dressing (during flowering and fruiting stages):**
    *   Apply 20-25 kg Potassium (K2O) per acre in 1-2 split doses, particularly important during fruit development.
    *   **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** (approx. 35-40 kg/acre per split dose)
    *   **Sulphate of Potash (SOP)** (approx. 40-50 kg/acre per split dose)
*   **Foliar Application (for quick recovery or supplementary feeding):**
    *   Spray 0.5-1% solution of **Potassium Nitrate** (5-10 g/L of water). This provides both N and K.
    *   Alternatively, **Sulphate of Potash (SOP)** can be used at 0.5-1% (5-10 g/L of water).

### General Recommendations:

*   **Soil Testing:** Always conduct a soil test before planting to get precise recommendations for your specific field. HAU provides soil testing services.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management (INM):** Combine chemical fertilizers with organic manures like Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or vermicompost (10-15 tonnes/acre) to improve soil health, nutrient availability, and water retention.
*   **Balanced Fertilization:** Ensure a balanced application of all essential nutrients, as an excess of one can induce deficiency of another.
*   **Water Management:** Proper irrigation is essential for nutrient uptake by plants.

These recommendations are general guidelines. For specific advice tailored to your farm, please consult with the local Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or HAU experts with your soil test reports.
