Both Scale insects and Mealybugs are known to affect Bottle Gourd (Lagenaria siceraria) in Haryana, causing significant damage by sucking sap, leading to yellowing, wilting, stunted growth, and reduced yield. They also excrete honeydew, which promotes the growth of sooty mold, further hindering photosynthesis.

Effective control requires an integrated approach, combining cultural practices with judicious use of CIBRC approved chemical insecticides.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Principles:**

*   **Regular Monitoring:** Frequently inspect plants, especially undersides of leaves, stem joints, and fruit calyx, for early detection of pests.
*   **Pruning and Sanitation:** Remove and destroy heavily infested plant parts (leaves, stems, fruits) to reduce pest populations. Maintain field hygiene.
*   **Water Spray:** For small infestations, a strong jet of water can dislodge mealybugs and scales.
*   **Biological Control:** Encourage natural enemies like ladybird beetles, lacewings, and parasitic wasps, which prey on these pests. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm beneficial insects.

**Chemical Control Measures:**

When pest populations are high and cultural methods are insufficient, CIBRC approved insecticides can be used. Due to the waxy coating of mealybugs and the protective shell of scale insects, systemic insecticides or those with good penetrating properties are often more effective. Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and in protected areas where these pests tend to aggregate.

Here are some CIBRC approved technical chemical names and their recommended dosages:

*   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** An insect growth regulator that inhibits chitin synthesis, primarily effective against nymphs of both scale insects and mealybugs.
    *   Apply at **1.25 litres per acre** (approximately **2.5 ml per litre** of water).
*   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:** A systemic insecticide with dual-directional movement (xylem and phloem), effective against all stages of sucking pests, including scales and mealybugs.
    *   Apply at **150-200 ml per acre** (approximately **0.3-0.4 ml per litre** of water).
*   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** A systemic neonicotinoid insecticide, effective against a wide range of sucking pests including mealybugs and scale insect nymphs.
    *   Apply at **125 ml per acre** (approximately **0.25 ml per litre** of water).
*   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Another systemic neonicotinoid insecticide, effective against mealybugs and scale insect nymphs.
    *   Apply at **100-125 grams per acre** (approximately **0.2-0.25 grams per litre** of water).
*   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** A systemic neonicotinoid insecticide, effective against various sucking pests including mealybugs.
    *   Apply at **100 grams per acre** (approximately **0.2 grams per litre** of water).
*   **Horticultural Mineral Oil (HMO) / Petroleum Spray Oil (PSO):** These oils act by suffocating the pests. They are effective against both scales and mealybugs, especially their younger stages. Ensure complete coverage.
    *   Apply as a **1-2% solution** (i.e., **10-20 ml per litre** of water).

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Rotation of Chemicals:** To prevent the development of pesticide resistance, rotate insecticides with different modes of action.
*   **Timing of Application:** Apply insecticides when pests are in their younger, more vulnerable stages (nymphs).
*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and in crevices where pests hide.
*   **Safety:** Always follow the manufacturer's instructions, wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), and observe pre-harvest intervals (PHI).
*   **Adjuvants:** The addition of a spreading agent (sticker/spreader) can improve the efficacy of sprays, especially for pests with waxy coatings.
