As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned conditions in Bottle Gourd (Lagenaria siceraria) in Haryana:

### Scab

Scab, caused by the fungus *Cladosporium cucumerinum*, is a known disease affecting Bottle Gourd, leading to sunken spots on fruits, leaves, and stems.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Practices:** Use disease-free seeds, practice crop rotation, and ensure good field sanitation.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Foliar spray with **Chlorothalonil** 75% WP at 2 g/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, spray with **Mancozeb** 75% WP at 2.5 g/L of water.
    *   Another option is **Copper Oxychloride** 50% WP at 3 g/L of water.
    *   Apply sprays at the first sign of disease and repeat as per label instructions, typically at 7-10 day intervals, depending on disease severity.

### Canker

This is not known to affect Bottle Gourd as a specific, named disease. While various fungal or bacterial infections can cause canker-like symptoms (e.g., sunken lesions on stems or fruits), "Canker" itself is not a primary disease of Bottle Gourd.

### Gummosis

Gummosis, characterized by the exudation of gummy sap from stems or fruits, is a common symptom in Bottle Gourd, often associated with diseases like Gummy Stem Blight (*Didymella bryoniae*).

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Practices:** Use resistant varieties if available, ensure proper plant spacing for good air circulation, avoid overhead irrigation, and remove infected plant parts promptly.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Foliar spray with a combination fungicide containing **Azoxystrobin** 11% + **Tebuconazole** 18.3% SC at 1 ml/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, use a combination of **Carbendazim** 12% + **Mancozeb** 63% WP at 2 g/L of water.
    *   Another effective option is **Propineb** 70% WP at 2.5 g/L of water.
    *   Ensure thorough coverage, especially on stems and fruits where gummosis is observed. Repeat applications as per product label recommendations.

### Lichen

This is not known to affect Bottle Gourd as a disease or pest. Lichens are symbiotic organisms (fungus and alga) that typically grow on inert surfaces like tree bark, rocks, or sometimes on very old, senescent plant parts. They are epiphytic and do not parasitize or harm the Bottle Gourd plant. Therefore, no control measures are required.
