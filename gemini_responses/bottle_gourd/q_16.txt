As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following fertilizer schedule for Bottle Gourd (Lagenaria siceraria) in Haryana, based on scientific research and best practices. It is always advisable to conduct a soil test to fine-tune these recommendations for your specific field conditions.

**General NPK Recommendation for Bottle Gourd:**
For optimal yield and quality, Bottle Gourd typically requires:
*   **Nitrogen (N):** 80-100 kg/acre
*   **Phosphorus (P2O5):** 60 kg/acre
*   **Potassium (K2O):** 60 kg/acre
*   **Sulphur (S):** 15-20 kg/acre

Here's how to achieve these nutrient levels using the requested fertilizers:

---

**1. Basal Application (at the time of sowing/planting):**
Apply the full dose of Phosphorus, Potassium, Sulphur, and one-third of the Nitrogen requirement.

**Option A: Using Diammonium Phosphate (DAP) and Elemental Sulphur**
*   **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP):** 130 kg/acre (This provides 23.4 kg N and 60 kg P2O5)
*   **Muriate of Potash (Potassium Chloride):** 100 kg/acre (This provides 60 kg K2O)
*   **Urea:** 25 kg/acre (To supplement the remaining basal N requirement)
*   **Elemental Sulphur (90%):** 15-20 kg/acre

**Option B: Using Single Super Phosphate (SSP) for Phosphorus and Sulphur**
*   **Single Super Phosphate (SSP):** 375 kg/acre (This provides 60 kg P2O5 and approximately 41 kg S, covering the Sulphur requirement)
*   **Muriate of Potash (Potassium Chloride):** 100 kg/acre (This provides 60 kg K2O)
*   **Urea:** 75 kg/acre (To meet the one-third basal N requirement)

**NPK Complex Fertilizers:**
If using a complex NPK fertilizer for basal application, choose a grade with a high phosphorus content, such as **NPK (12:32:16)**. You would need approximately 185-190 kg/acre of **NPK (12:32:16)** to meet the P2O5 requirement, and then supplement with **Urea** and **Muriate of Potash** to balance the N and K. However, using individual fertilizers as described above allows for more precise nutrient management.

**2. Top-dressing (Remaining Nitrogen):**
Apply the remaining two-thirds of the Nitrogen in two equal split doses.
*   **First Top-dressing:** 30-40 days after sowing/planting (DAS/DAP)
    *   **Urea:** 70 kg/acre
*   **Second Top-dressing:** 60-70 days after sowing/planting (DAS/DAP), or at the start of flowering/fruiting
    *   **Urea:** 70 kg/acre

---

**3. Foliar Applications (Supplementary):**
Nano fertilizers can be used as supplementary foliar sprays to enhance nutrient uptake and plant vigor, especially during critical growth stages.

*   **Nano-Urea:**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml/L of water.
    *   **Application:** Spray twice or thrice during the vegetative growth and pre-flowering stages, at an interval of 15-20 days. Ensure good leaf coverage.

*   **Nano-DAP:**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml/L of water.
    *   **Application:** Spray twice during the vegetative growth and flowering/fruiting stages, at an interval of 15-20 days.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Soil Testing:** Always prioritize soil testing. The above recommendations are general; a soil test report will provide precise nutrient levels and help tailor the fertilizer application.
*   **Irrigation:** Ensure adequate moisture in the soil before and after fertilizer application to facilitate nutrient uptake and prevent burning.
*   **Method of Application:** For basal application, mix fertilizers thoroughly into the soil before sowing or planting. For top-dressing, broadcast **Urea** evenly and lightly incorporate it into the soil, followed by irrigation.
*   **Micronutrients:** Bottle Gourd may also require micronutrients like Zinc, Boron, and Manganese. A soil test will indicate if these are deficient. If so, apply **Zinc Sulphate (21%)** at 10-15 kg/acre as basal, or foliar sprays of micronutrient mixtures as per deficiency symptoms.
