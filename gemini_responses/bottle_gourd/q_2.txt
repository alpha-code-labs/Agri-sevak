As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding rust diseases in Bottle Gourd for Haryana conditions:

Let's address each type of rust disease you mentioned:

*   **Black Rust (Stem Rust), Brown Rust (Leaf Rust), and Yellow Rust (Stripe Rust):**
    This is not known to affect Bottle Gourd. These rusts are primarily diseases of cereal crops like wheat, barley, and rye, caused by specific *Puccinia* species that do not infect cucurbits.

*   **Red Rust:**
    This is not known to affect Bottle Gourd. Red rust is typically an algal disease caused by *Cephaleuros virescens*, primarily affecting perennial crops like tea, coffee, mango, and guava in humid tropical regions. It is not a true fungal rust and does not affect Bottle Gourd.

*   **White Rust:**
    White rust *does* affect Bottle Gourd (Lagenaria siceraria) and is caused by *Albugo lagenariae* (an oomycete, not a true fungus, but often grouped with fungi due to similar symptoms).

### Control of White Rust in Bottle Gourd

**Symptoms:**
White rust typically appears as white, shiny, raised pustules, primarily on the underside of leaves, but can also be found on stems and petioles. These pustules eventually rupture, releasing white powdery spores. In severe cases, it can lead to leaf distortion and reduced yield.

**Management Strategies:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting Bottle Gourd or other susceptible cucurbits in the same field year after year.
    *   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest to reduce inoculum for the next season.
    *   **Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to promote good air circulation, which helps reduce humidity and disease development.
    *   **Weed Control:** Manage weeds in and around the field, as some weeds can act as alternate hosts.

2.  **Chemical Control:**
    For effective control of White Rust, especially during periods conducive to disease development (high humidity, moderate temperatures), the following CIBRC-approved fungicides can be used. Always ensure thorough coverage of the foliage, especially the undersides of leaves. It is advisable to alternate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

    *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP): Apply at a rate of **2-2.5 kg/acre** (or 2-2.5 g/L of water for spray solution).
    *   **Metalaxyl 8% + Mancozeb 64% WP**: Apply at a rate of **2.5 kg/acre** (or 2.5 g/L of water for spray solution). This combination provides both systemic and contact action.
    *   **Propineb** (70% WP): Apply at a rate of **2-2.5 kg/acre** (or 2-2.5 g/L of water for spray solution).
    *   **Dimethomorph 9% + Mancozeb 60% WP**: Apply at a rate of **1.5-2 kg/acre** (or 1.5-2 g/L of water for spray solution).

**Important Note:** Always read and follow the instructions on the product label for specific dosage, application timing, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and safety precautions. Consult with your local agricultural extension officer for the most current and specific recommendations for your region within Haryana.
