Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, I can confirm that both termites and root-knot nematodes are significant soil pests that can affect Palmyra palms (Borassus flabellifer) in Haryana, particularly young plants or those under stress. Effective management requires an integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods.

Here's a scientifically verified approach to control these soil pests in Palmyra:

### General Principles for Soil Pest Management

*   **Integrated Pest Management (IPM):** Combine various strategies for sustainable and effective control.
*   **Soil Health:** Healthy soil with good organic matter content promotes beneficial microorganisms that can suppress pests.
*   **Regular Monitoring:** Inspect palms regularly for signs of infestation.

### Control of Termites

Termites primarily attack the roots and base of the palm, leading to weakening, stunted growth, and in severe cases, plant death.

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Methods:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove all dead wood, stumps, and plant debris from around the palm base, as these can serve as breeding grounds for termites.
*   **Avoid Direct Soil Contact:** Ensure the palm trunk does not have direct contact with the soil by creating a small mound or barrier around the base.
*   **Proper Drainage:** Prevent waterlogging, which can stress palms and make them more susceptible.
*   **Physical Barriers:** In new plantings, consider using physical barriers around the root zone if feasible.

**2. Chemical Control (Soil Drenching):**
For existing infestations or as a preventive measure, soil drenching around the base of the palm is effective.
*   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: Mix 2.5 ml per litre of water. Drench the soil around the base of each palm with 1-2 litres of the solution, ensuring it penetrates the root zone. Repeat if necessary, especially after heavy rains.
*   **Fipronil** 5% SC: Mix 2-3 ml per litre of water. Drench the soil around the base of each palm with 1-2 litres of the solution. Fipronil also offers some control against certain nematodes.

### Control of Nematodes (Root-knot Nematodes)

Root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.) cause galls or knots on the roots, impairing water and nutrient uptake, leading to stunted growth, yellowing leaves, and reduced vigour.

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Methods:**
*   **Healthy Planting Material:** Always use nematode-free seedlings or saplings.
*   **Soil Solarization:** In nursery beds or small planting areas, cover moist soil with clear plastic sheets for 4-6 weeks during hot summer months to kill nematodes.
*   **Organic Matter:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost (5-10 kg per palm annually) into the soil. This improves soil structure and promotes beneficial microbial activity that can suppress nematodes.
*   **Water and Nutrient Management:** Ensure optimal irrigation and balanced fertilization to help palms tolerate nematode damage.

**2. Biological Control:**
Biological agents are highly recommended for nematode management as they are environmentally friendly and promote long-term soil health.
*   **Purpureocillium lilacinum** (formerly *Paecilomyces lilacinus*): Apply 2.5 kg per acre (or 10-20 g per young palm, 50-100 g per mature palm) mixed with 50-100 kg of FYM or compost. Broadcast around the root zone and lightly incorporate into the soil, followed by irrigation.
*   **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum**: Apply 2.5 kg per acre (or 10-20 g per young palm, 50-100 g per mature palm) mixed with 50-100 kg of FYM or compost. Broadcast around the root zone and lightly incorporate into the soil, followed by irrigation. This also helps control other soil-borne fungal diseases.

**3. Chemical Control (Use with caution and as a last resort):**
Chemical nematicides should be used judiciously, especially in established palms, and only when cultural and biological methods are insufficient.
*   **Carbofuran** 3% G: Apply 30-40 kg per acre (or 30-40 g per young palm, 100-150 g per mature palm) by broadcasting granules around the root zone and incorporating them into the soil, followed by irrigation.
*   **Fipronil** 0.3% G: Apply 10-15 kg per acre (or 10-15 g per young palm, 30-50 g per mature palm) around the root zone and incorporate into the soil, followed by irrigation. This granular formulation also provides control against termites.

### Important Considerations:

*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (gloves, mask, eye protection) when handling any pesticides. Follow label instructions strictly.
*   **Timing:** Apply treatments when soil moisture is adequate, or follow with irrigation for better efficacy.
*   **Soil Testing:** Consider getting your soil tested for nematode populations to determine the severity of infestation and guide management decisions.

By adopting these integrated strategies, you can effectively manage soil pests in your Palmyra palms and ensure their healthy growth and productivity.
