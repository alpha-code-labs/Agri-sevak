As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), my primary responsibility is to provide scientifically verified advice relevant to the agro-climatic conditions of Haryana.

Palmyra palm (Borassus flabellifer) is a tropical palm species primarily cultivated in coastal and southern regions of India, as well as Southeast Asia and Africa. It thrives in hot, humid climates with well-drained sandy or loamy soils, often near coastal areas or river deltas.

Haryana's agro-climatic conditions, characterized by a semi-arid to sub-humid continental monsoon climate with extreme temperatures (hot summers, cold winters) and relatively lower humidity compared to tropical regions, are generally **unsuitable for the successful cultivation of Palmyra palm.**

Therefore, providing specific recommendations for improving yield, fruit quality, and storage life for Palmyra palm *within the context of Haryana* is not feasible, as the crop is not adapted to our local environment and is not commercially cultivated here. Any attempt to grow it would likely result in poor growth, low yields, and significant challenges, making specific improvement strategies irrelevant for our region.
