As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the conditions mentioned for Palmyra (Borassus flabellifer) in Haryana:

*   **Scab:** This is not known to affect Palmyra.
*   **Canker:** This is not known to affect Palmyra.
*   **Gummosis:** This is not known to affect Palmyra.

*   **Lichen:**
    Lichen growth on Palmyra palms is common, especially in humid conditions. It is important to understand that lichens are symbiotic organisms (a fungus and an alga/cyanobacterium) and are **non-parasitic**. They do not draw nutrients from the palm and generally do not cause direct harm to the tree. Therefore, control measures are usually not necessary unless for aesthetic reasons or if their growth is exceptionally dense, potentially harboring other pests or reducing air circulation.

    If control is deemed necessary:
    *   **Manual Removal:** For small areas or accessible trunks, lichens can be gently scraped off with a blunt tool or brushed off with a stiff brush. Ensure not to damage the palm's bark.
    *   **Chemical Control (if absolutely necessary):**
        *   Fungicides containing copper can deter lichen growth. Apply during dry weather to ensure efficacy.
        *   **Copper oxychloride** (50% WP) at 2-3 g/L of water.
        *   **Copper hydroxide** (77% WP) at 2-3 g/L of water.
        *   Ensure thorough coverage of the affected areas. Repeat application may be needed for persistent growth.

    **Important Note:** Always follow label instructions for dosage, safety precautions, and application methods for any chemical used.
