As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I must provide scientifically verified advice.

Based on current scientific literature and agricultural knowledge regarding Palmyra palm (*Borassus flabellifer*):

*   **Dieback:** This is not known to affect Palmyra as a specific disease. While palms can exhibit symptoms of decline or death of fronds/spear, which might be broadly described as 'dieback' in a general sense, it is not a recognized specific disease of Palmyra palm.
*   **Twig blight:** This is not known to affect Palmyra. Palms do not have 'twigs' in the botanical sense; they have fronds. While fronds can suffer from various blights or spots, 'twig blight' is not a recognized disease name for Palmyra.
*   **Tikka disease:** This is not known to affect Palmyra. Tikka disease is a specific leaf spot disease primarily affecting groundnut (peanut) and is not associated with Palmyra palm.
