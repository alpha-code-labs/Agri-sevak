As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fruit flies and ber flies in Palmyra palms, keeping in mind the specific conditions of Haryana, India.

### Control of Fruit Fly in Palmyra

Palmyra palm fruits can be susceptible to infestation by various species of fruit flies (e.g., *Bactrocera* species). An Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is recommended for effective control.

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Sanitation:** Regularly collect and destroy all fallen and infested fruits by burying them deep in the soil or composting them to prevent further multiplication of the pest.
*   **Field Hygiene:** Maintain good hygiene around the palm trees.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** If feasible, deep ploughing around the base of the trees during the off-season can expose and destroy pupae present in the soil.

**2. Monitoring and Mass Trapping:**
*   **Pheromone Traps:** Install methyl eugenol based pheromone traps at a density of 10-12 traps per acre to monitor adult fruit fly populations. These traps can also be used for mass trapping to reduce the adult population. Replace the lure every 2-3 weeks.

**3. Chemical Control (as needed):**
When fruit fly incidence is high, chemical interventions can be employed. Always observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) strictly.

*   **Bait Sprays:** These are highly effective for attracting and killing adult fruit flies.
    *   Prepare a bait solution by mixing 100 ml of **Malathion** (50% EC) or 50 ml of **Fenthion** (50% EC) with 1 kg of jaggery or 200 g of protein hydrolysate in 10 litres of water.
    *   Apply this bait solution as spot sprays on the tree trunk or on a few leaves, not directly on the fruits, especially during the fruiting stage.
    *   Repeat the application every 7-10 days if the infestation persists.

*   **Foliar Sprays (for severe infestations):**
    *   **Dimethoate** (30% EC) at 1.0 ml/L of water.
    *   **Spinosad** (45% SC) at 0.25 ml/L of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** (5% EC) at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   Ensure thorough coverage of the fruit bunches. Apply sprays during the early stages of fruit development if infestation is anticipated or observed.

### Control of Ber Fly in Palmyra

This is not known to affect Palmyra. The Ber fly (*Carpomyia vesuviana*) is a highly host-specific pest primarily known to infest fruits of Ber (*Ziziphus mauritiana*).
