As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the control of pests in Palmyra (Borassus flabellifer) in Haryana:

1.  **Borers:**
    Palmyra palms are susceptible to various borers, including the Red Palm Weevil (*Rhynchophorus ferrugineus*) and Rhinoceros Beetle (*Oryctes rhinoceros*). These pests can cause significant damage by boring into the stem, crown, and leaf bases.

    **Control Measures:**
    *   **Cultural Practices:** Maintain good orchard sanitation by removing dead or decaying palms and fronds, which can serve as breeding sites. Avoid making wounds on the palm trunk.
    *   **Mechanical Control:** For Rhinoceros Beetle, collect and destroy adults using light traps or by hand-picking from the crown.
    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   **For Red Palm Weevil:**
            *   **Trunk Injection:** Inject a systemic insecticide into the palm trunk.
                *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL at 10-15 ml per palm (diluted in water as per manufacturer's instructions for injection).
                *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG at 5-10 g per palm (diluted in water as per manufacturer's instructions for injection).
            *   **Crown Drenching:** Apply insecticide solution to the crown region.
                *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 2.5 ml/L of water, drenching the crown and leaf axils.
        *   **For Rhinoceros Beetle (Grubs in breeding sites):**
            *   Treat breeding pits (e.g., decaying organic matter, compost pits) with **Carbaryl** 50% WP at 500 g per cubic meter of breeding material.
        *   **For Rhinoceros Beetle (Adults in palm crown):**
            *   Apply a mixture of **Carbaryl** 10% DP and sand (1:1 ratio) in the innermost leaf axils and crown @ 250 g per palm.

2.  **Caterpillars:**
    Palmyra palms can be affected by various defoliating caterpillars, such as the Black-headed caterpillar (*Opisina arenosella*), which feeds on the green matter of the leaves.

    **Control Measures:**
    *   **Cultural Practices:** Remove and destroy severely infested leaves to reduce pest population.
    *   **Biological Control:** Release of larval parasitoids like *Goniozus nephantidis* or pupal parasitoids like *Brachymeria nephantidis* can be effective in managing the pest.
    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   **Emamectin Benzoate** 5% SG at 0.2-0.25 g/L of water.
        *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC at 0.3 ml/L of water.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage, especially the undersides of the leaves where caterpillars feed.

3.  **Diamondback moth:**
    This is not known to affect Palmyra. The Diamondback moth (*Plutella xylostella*) is a specific pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower, mustard).

4.  **Leaf folder:**
    This is not known to affect Palmyra. Leaf folders (e.g., *Cnaphalocrocis medinalis* in rice) are specific pests of certain monocotyledonous crops and are not associated with Palmyra palms.

**Important Note:** Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully, including dosage, application method, and safety precautions. It is advisable to consult with local agricultural extension officers for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and the prevailing pest situation.
