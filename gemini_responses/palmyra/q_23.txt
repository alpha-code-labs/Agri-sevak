Based on current scientific understanding and agricultural practices in Haryana, the requirement for specific chemical seed treatments and broad-spectrum chemical soil treatments for Palmyra (Borassus flabellifer) cultivation is not known to affect Palmyra.

Palmyra is a hardy tree species, and while general good horticultural practices are important for its establishment and growth, specific chemical seed treatments (e.g., fungicides, insecticides applied to seeds) and broad-spectrum chemical soil treatments (e.g., pre-plant fumigation or drenching for disease/pest control) are generally not recommended or considered standard practice for its cultivation in Haryana. Focus is typically placed on selecting healthy seeds, proper site preparation, and good cultural management.
