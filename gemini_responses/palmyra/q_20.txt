Dear Farmer,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding micronutrient deficiencies in Palmyra (Borassus flabellifer). Palmyra, like other palms, can suffer from various micronutrient deficiencies, which can significantly impact its growth, yield, and overall health.

It is crucial to conduct a soil test and, if possible, a leaf tissue analysis to accurately diagnose specific deficiencies before applying any corrective measures. This will help in precise application and prevent potential toxicity from over-application.

Here's how to address the common micronutrient deficiencies in Palmyra:

### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Reduced leaflet size, "little leaf" appearance, rosetting of new leaves, interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, and stunted growth.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Apply 0.2-0.5% solution of **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (21% Zn) or 0.1% solution of **Zinc EDTA** (12% Zn). Repeat every 2-3 months until symptoms disappear.
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 50-100 g of **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** per palm per year, mixed with farmyard manure, in the root zone.

### 2. Iron (Fe) / Ferrous Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Pronounced interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on the youngest leaves, while veins remain green. In severe cases, the entire leaf may turn yellow or white, leading to necrosis.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Apply 0.2-0.5% solution of **Ferrous sulphate heptahydrate** or 0.1% solution of **Ferrous EDTA**. Repeat every 2-3 months.
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 50-100 g of **Ferrous sulphate heptahydrate** or 20-50 g of **Ferrous EDTA** per palm per year, mixed with organic matter, in the root zone. Iron deficiency is often linked to high soil pH, so consider soil amendments to lower pH if necessary.

### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** "Hook leaf" or "little leaf" appearance, crumpled or malformed new leaves that fail to open properly, necrosis of the meristem (growing point), and premature fruit drop. This is a critical deficiency for palms.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 50-100 g of **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate) or 25-50 g of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** per palm per year, spread evenly in the root zone.
    *   **Foliar Spray (for quick relief):** Apply 0.1-0.2% solution of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate**.

### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, necrosis of young leaves or the growing point, poor root development, and distorted new leaves. Less common as a primary deficiency in palms unless soil pH is extremely low or high.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 1-2 kg of **Gypsum** (Calcium sulphate dihydrate) or 500 g - 1 kg of **Calcium nitrate** per palm per year, depending on the severity and soil test results. Ensure good soil moisture after application.

### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** "Frizzle top" or "bronzing" on older leaves, characterized by yellowing of the leaf margins, often starting from the tip and progressing inwards, leaving a distinct green triangle at the base of the leaflet.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 500 g - 1 kg of **Magnesium sulphate heptahydrate** (Epsom salt) per palm per year, spread in the root zone.
    *   **Foliar Spray (for quick relief):** Apply 1-2% solution of **Magnesium sulphate heptahydrate**.

### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** "Frizzle top" on younger leaves, interveinal chlorosis on new leaves, necrosis of leaflet tips, and stunted growth. Often confused with Iron deficiency, but Manganese deficiency typically affects younger leaves more severely.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 100-200 g of **Manganese sulphate monohydrate** per palm per year, mixed with organic matter, in the root zone.
    *   **Foliar Spray (for quick relief):** Apply 0.2-0.5% solution of **Manganese sulphate monohydrate**.

### General Recommendations for Micronutrient Management:

*   **Soil Testing:** Always start with a comprehensive soil test to identify specific deficiencies and soil pH. Leaf tissue analysis can further confirm the nutrient status of the palm.
*   **Organic Matter:** Incorporate ample amounts of well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost regularly. Organic matter improves soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability by chelating micronutrients.
*   **Balanced Fertilization:** Ensure a balanced application of NPK fertilizers, as an imbalance can sometimes induce micronutrient deficiencies.
*   **Soil pH Management:** Micronutrient availability is highly dependent on soil pH. For most micronutrients, a slightly acidic to neutral pH (6.0-7.0) is ideal. Adjust soil pH if necessary based on soil test results.
*   **Application Method:** Foliar sprays provide a quick but temporary correction, while soil applications offer a more sustained supply. Combine both for severe deficiencies.
*   **Timing:** Apply micronutrients during the active growing season of the palm.
*   **Watering:** Ensure adequate soil moisture after soil applications to facilitate nutrient uptake.

Always follow the recommended dosages and consult with local agricultural extension officers for specific advice tailored to your farm's conditions.
