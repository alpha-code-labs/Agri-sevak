Palmyra (Borassus flabellifer) is primarily a tropical palm species, traditionally found in coastal and southern regions of India. It is not a commonly cultivated crop in Haryana due to the prevailing agro-climatic conditions, which are more suited for crops like wheat, rice, mustard, cotton, and various horticultural crops.

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), our recommendations are based on extensive research and trials conducted within the state to provide scientifically verified advice for crops suitable and economically viable for Haryana's farmers.

Given that Palmyra is not a significant or recommended cultivated crop for Haryana, specific cultivation practices (sowing method/pattern, planting depth, spacing, and seed dose) are not typically developed or recommended by HAU for commercial cultivation in the region. Therefore, we do not have established guidelines for these practices for Palmyra in Haryana.
