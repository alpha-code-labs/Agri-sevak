As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide scientifically verified advice for controlling various rot types in Palmyra (Borassus flabellifer) in Haryana. While Palmyra palms are generally robust, they can be susceptible to certain rot diseases, especially under unfavorable conditions.

It is important to note that some of the rot types you listed are either manifestations of broader diseases or not commonly recognized as distinct conditions affecting Palmyra.

Here's a breakdown of the known rot types and their control measures:

### 1. Crown Rot (Bud Rot)

This is a serious and often fatal disease affecting the growing point (crown) of the palm.
*   **Pathogen:** Primarily *Phytophthora palmivora*.
*   **Symptoms:** The spear leaf (youngest unopened leaf) turns yellow, then brown, and eventually rots. The surrounding young leaves also show discoloration and decay. A foul smell may emanate from the rotting crown. The growing point is destroyed, leading to the death of the palm.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Cultural:**
        *   Improve drainage around the palms to prevent waterlogging, which favors fungal growth.
        *   Remove and destroy severely infected palms to prevent the spread of the disease.
        *   Avoid mechanical injuries to the crown.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   **Prophylactic (preventive) application:** Apply fungicides to the crown region, especially during monsoon season or when conditions are favorable for the disease.
            *   **Fosetyl-aluminium** (80% WP) at 2.5 g/L of water.
            *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride** (72.2% SL) at 2.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Curative (early stage) application:** If symptoms are observed at an early stage, drench the crown with:
            *   **Metalaxyl + Mancozeb** (72% WP) at 2.5 g/L of water.

### 2. Basal Stem Rot (Root Rot, Stem Rot, Foot Rot, Collar Rot)

This disease affects the base of the trunk, roots, and collar region. Root rot, stem rot (at the base), foot rot, and collar rot are often manifestations of this broader disease complex.
*   **Pathogen:** Primarily *Ganoderma spp.* (e.g., *Ganoderma lucidum*).
*   **Symptoms:** Reddish-brown discoloration of tissues at the base of the trunk, often accompanied by exudation of a gummy substance. Bracket fungi (basidiocarps) may appear on the trunk. The palm shows general decline, yellowing of older leaves, reduced vigor, and eventually death. Roots also show decay.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Cultural:**
        *   Remove and destroy infected palms and their stumps to reduce inoculum in the soil.
        *   Practice good sanitation in the plantation.
        *   Improve soil drainage and aeration.
        *   Apply organic amendments to improve soil health.
    *   **Biological:**
        *   Apply antagonistic fungi like *Trichoderma viride* (2.5 kg/acre mixed with 50 kg farmyard manure) or bacteria like *Pseudomonas fluorescens* (2.5 kg/acre mixed with 50 kg farmyard manure) to the soil around the base of healthy palms as a preventive measure.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   **Soil drenching:** Drench the soil around the base of affected or susceptible palms with:
            *   **Hexaconazole** (5% SC) at 2 ml/L of water.
            *   **Propiconazole** (25% EC) at 1 ml/L of water.
        *   **Trunk application:** For visible lesions on the trunk, scrape off the affected tissue and apply a paste of:
            *   **Copper oxychloride** (50% WP) mixed with water.

### 3. Seed Rot and Seedling Rot (Damping-off)

These affect seeds during germination and young seedlings.
*   **Pathogens:** Various soil-borne fungi such as *Pythium spp., Phytophthora spp., Rhizoctonia solani*, and *Fusarium spp.*
*   **Symptoms:** Seeds fail to germinate or rot before emergence. Seedlings may collapse at the soil line (damping-off), show water-soaked lesions, or exhibit stunted growth and eventual death.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Cultural:**
        *   Use well-drained, sterilized potting mix for nurseries.
        *   Avoid overwatering and ensure proper spacing between seedlings to improve air circulation.
        *   Maintain optimal temperature and humidity for germination.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   **Seed treatment:** Treat seeds before sowing with:
            *   **Carbendazim** (50% WP) at 2 g/kg seed.
            *   **Thiram** (75% WS) at 2.5 g/kg seed.
        *   **Soil drenching (for seedlings):** If seedling rot occurs, drench the soil around the seedlings with:
            *   **Carbendazim** (50% WP) at 1 g/L of water.
            *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride** (72.2% SL) at 2.5 ml/L of water.

### 4. Fruit Rot

While Palmyra fruits can be affected by various fungi, fruit rot is generally not a major economic concern requiring extensive chemical control in Palmyra cultivation compared to other palm diseases.
*   **Pathogens:** Various fungi.
*   **Symptoms:** Discoloration, softening, and decay of fruits, often starting from the stalk end or points of injury.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Cultural:**
        *   Maintain good orchard hygiene by removing fallen and diseased fruits.
        *   Ensure proper air circulation within the canopy.
        *   Avoid mechanical injuries to fruits.
    *   **Chemical (if severe and economically justified):**
        *   Fungicide sprays can be applied, though rarely necessary for Palmyra:
            *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2.5 g/L of water.
            *   **Chlorothalonil** (75% WP) at 2 g/L of water.

### Specific Rot Types Not Known to Affect Palmyra as Distinct Diseases

*   **Neck Rot:** This is not known to affect Palmyra as a distinct disease entity requiring specific control measures. Symptoms resembling "neck rot" would typically fall under severe crown rot or basal stem rot depending on the location of the rot.
*   **Black Rot:** This is not known to affect Palmyra as a distinct disease entity requiring specific control measures. While some rots may appear black, "Black Rot" is not a recognized specific disease of Palmyra.

### General Preventative Measures for All Rots:

*   **Good Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy diseased plant parts, fallen leaves, and fruits.
*   **Proper Drainage:** Ensure good soil drainage to prevent waterlogging, which creates anaerobic conditions and favors many rot-causing pathogens.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide adequate and balanced nutrients to maintain palm vigor and natural resistance.
*   **Avoid Injury:** Minimize mechanical injuries to the trunk, roots, and crown, as these can serve as entry points for pathogens.
*   **Regular Monitoring:** Inspect palms regularly for early signs of disease to allow for timely intervention.
