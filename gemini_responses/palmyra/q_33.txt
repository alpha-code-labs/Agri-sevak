As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for weed control in Palmyra (Borassus flabellifer) in Haryana.

Firstly, regarding **Orobanche**: This is not known to affect Palmyra. Orobanche species are parasitic weeds primarily affecting dicotyledonous crops like mustard, tobacco, and some vegetables, not monocots like palms.

For the other weeds mentioned (Broadleaf, Narrowleaf, Amarbail, Bathu, Congress grass, and Phalaris minor), they can be a concern, especially in young Palmyra plantations or in the basin area around mature palms. Effective weed management involves a combination of cultural, mechanical, and chemical methods.

### Integrated Weed Management in Palmyra:

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Methods:**

*   **Manual Weeding:** Regular hand weeding or hoeing around the base of young palms is highly effective, especially for weeds like Bathu, Congress grass, and Amarbail. This should be done before weeds set seed.
*   **Mulching:** Applying organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves, coir pith) or black plastic mulch around the base of the palms can significantly suppress weed growth, conserve soil moisture, and regulate soil temperature.
*   **Intercropping:** In the initial years of plantation, intercropping with short-duration, non-competitive crops can help manage weeds in the inter-row spaces and provide additional income.
*   **Clean Cultivation:** Maintaining clean basins around the palms by removing weeds regularly reduces competition for nutrients and water.

**2. Chemical Control (Herbicides):**

Herbicides can be used judiciously, especially in larger plantations or when manual weeding is not feasible. Always ensure proper safety gear (gloves, mask, protective clothing) during application and follow label instructions.

**A. Pre-emergence Herbicides (Applied to soil before weed emergence):**

These herbicides prevent weed seeds from germinating or kill them shortly after germination. They are effective against a wide range of broadleaf and narrowleaf weeds.

*   **Pendimethalin 30% EC:**
    *   **Dosage:** 3.3 litres per acre.
    *   **Application:** Apply to moist soil within 2-3 days after planting or transplanting Palmyra, before weed emergence. Ensure uniform coverage.
*   **Oxyfluorfen 23.5% EC:**
    *   **Dosage:** 0.85 - 1.0 litre per acre.
    *   **Application:** Apply as a pre-emergence spray to moist soil.
*   **Diuron 80% WP:**
    *   **Dosage:** 1.0 - 1.5 kg per acre.
    *   **Application:** Apply as a pre-emergence spray to moist soil.

**B. Post-emergence Herbicides (Applied to emerged weeds):**

These herbicides kill existing weeds. Non-selective herbicides are commonly used in tree crops, applied as directed sprays to avoid contact with the palm.

*   **Glyphosate 41% SL:**
    *   **Dosage:** 2.5 - 3.0 litres per acre (for broadcast application) or 10-15 ml per litre of water (for spot application).
    *   **Application:** Apply as a directed spray to actively growing weeds (broadleaf, narrowleaf, Congress grass, Phalaris minor, Bathu). Avoid contact with the trunk (especially young palms) and foliage of Palmyra. It is systemic and takes a few days to show effects.
*   **Paraquat dichloride 24% SL:**
    *   **Dosage:** 2.0 - 2.5 litres per acre (for broadcast application) or 5-10 ml per litre of water (for spot application).
    *   **Application:** Apply as a directed contact spray to actively growing weeds. It acts quickly but is non-systemic. Strict care must be taken to avoid drift onto Palmyra foliage or green bark.
*   **Glufosinate ammonium 13.5% SL:**
    *   **Dosage:** 3.0 - 3.5 litres per acre (for broadcast application) or 10-15 ml per litre of water (for spot application).
    *   **Application:** Apply as a directed contact spray to actively growing weeds. It has some systemic action but is primarily a contact herbicide. Avoid contact with the palm.

**Specific Considerations for Amarbail (Cuscuta spp.):**

*   **Manual Removal:** For Amarbail, manual removal is often the most effective and safest method, especially if it has started growing on the palm or surrounding vegetation. Remove the parasitic strands completely and destroy them.
*   **Pre-emergence:** **Pendimethalin** can offer some pre-emergence control by inhibiting the germination of Amarbail seeds in the soil.

**Important Precautions:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the herbicide label carefully.
*   Use the correct dosage and application method.
*   Apply herbicides during calm weather to prevent drift.
*   Use appropriate spray nozzles for directed application in tree crops.
*   Ensure the soil is moist for optimal herbicide efficacy, especially for pre-emergence types.
*   Rotate herbicides with different modes of action to prevent herbicide resistance.

By adopting an integrated approach, you can effectively manage weeds in your Palmyra plantation, ensuring healthy growth and productivity.
