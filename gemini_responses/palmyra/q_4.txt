As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Wilt in Palmyra palms in Haryana.

**Wilt in Palmyra (primarily Ganoderma Basal Stem Rot)**

The most significant "wilt" affecting Palmyra palms (Borassus flabellifer) is typically Ganoderma Basal Stem Rot, caused by fungal pathogens like *Ganoderma lucidum* or related species. This disease leads to a gradual decline and wilting of the palm.

**Symptoms:**
*   Yellowing and drooping of older leaves, progressing to younger leaves.
*   Reduced crown size and stunted growth.
*   Necrosis (browning and death) of fronds.
*   Reddish-brown exudation from the base of the trunk in advanced stages.
*   Presence of characteristic bracket-like fungal fruiting bodies (basidiocarps) at the base of the trunk, which are initially white and later turn reddish-brown.
*   Internal discoloration and rotting of the trunk base.
*   Ultimately, the palm wilts completely and dies.

**Control Measures:**

An integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods is recommended for effective management.

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Sanitation:** Promptly remove and destroy severely infected or dead palms, including their root systems and stumps, to reduce the inoculum source.
    *   **Avoid Injury:** Prevent mechanical injuries to the trunk base and roots during cultivation or other operations, as these can create entry points for the pathogen.
    *   **Improve Drainage:** Ensure good soil drainage around the palms, as waterlogging can stress the palms and favor fungal growth.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Maintain palm vigor through balanced fertilization. Apply recommended doses of macro and micronutrients to enhance the palm's natural resistance.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply antagonistic fungi like **Trichoderma viride** or *Pseudomonas fluorescens* (if available and CIBRC approved for this use) to the soil around the base of the palm.
        *   **Trichoderma viride** (2.5 kg/acre) mixed with 50 kg of well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost, applied annually around the root zone.

3.  **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Prophylactic/Early Stage Treatment:**
        *   **Soil Drenching:** Drench the soil around the base of the palm with systemic fungicides.
            *   **Hexaconazole** 5 EC at 2 ml/L of water. Apply 5-10 litres of this solution per palm, depending on its size, around the root zone. Repeat every 3-4 months, especially during monsoon and post-monsoon periods.
            *   **Propiconazole** 25 EC at 2 ml/L of water. Apply 5-10 litres of this solution per palm around the root zone. Repeat every 3-4 months.
        *   **Trunk Base Painting/Wound Dressing:**
            *   For visible lesions or wounds at the trunk base, apply a paste of **Copper oxychloride** 50 WP (30 g in 100 ml of water) after scraping off the affected tissue.
