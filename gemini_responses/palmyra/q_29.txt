As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding dropping in Palmyra (Borassus flabellifer) for Haryana conditions:

**Tinda/Boll dropping is not known to affect Palmyra.** This term is typically associated with other crops like cotton.

However, flower drop and fruit drop can occur in Palmyra due to various physiological, environmental, and nutritional factors. While some natural shedding of flowers and immature fruits is normal, excessive dropping can significantly reduce yield.

Here are the control measures for excessive flower and fruit drop in Palmyra:

1.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Boron Deficiency:** Boron plays a crucial role in flower and fruit development. Deficiency can lead to poor fruit set and increased dropping.
        *   Apply **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate) at 100-150 g per palm per year, split into two applications (e.g., during pre-flowering and fruit set stages).
    *   **Potassium Deficiency:** Potassium is essential for fruit development and overall plant vigor.
        *   Apply **Muriate of Potash** (Potassium chloride) at 1.0-1.5 kg per palm per year, split into two applications.
    *   Ensure balanced fertilization with Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and other micronutrients based on soil test reports.

2.  **Water Management:**
    *   Provide adequate and consistent irrigation, especially during the critical stages of flowering and fruit development. Both severe water stress (drought) and waterlogging can lead to flower and fruit drop.
    *   Maintain consistent soil moisture without over-irrigating.

3.  **Pest and Disease Management:**
    *   Regularly inspect palms for any pest infestations or diseases that might be affecting the inflorescences or young fruits, leading to their premature shedding.
    *   **Sucking Pests (e.g., Mealybugs, Scale Insects):** If identified as a cause of damage leading to drop:
        *   Spray with **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL at 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   Alternatively, spray with **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG at 0.2 g/L of water.
    *   **Mites:** If mites are observed causing damage to flowers or young fruits:
        *   Spray with **Spiromesifen** 22.9% SC at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   For specific fungal infections affecting inflorescences, consult HAU experts for precise diagnosis and fungicide recommendations.

4.  **Pollination:**
    *   Palmyra palms are dioecious (male and female flowers on separate trees). Ensure adequate pollination for fruit set. If natural pollination (by wind or insects) is insufficient, especially in isolated female trees, assisted pollination can be considered by collecting pollen from male trees and dusting it onto receptive female inflorescences.

5.  **Environmental Factors:**
    *   Extreme temperatures (very high or very low) and sudden fluctuations can also contribute to dropping. While these are difficult to control, ensuring optimal cultural practices helps the palm withstand such stresses better.
