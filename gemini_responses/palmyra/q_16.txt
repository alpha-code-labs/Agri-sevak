Palmyra palm (Borassus flabellifer) is not a crop commonly cultivated in Haryana. Its cultivation is primarily concentrated in coastal and southern regions of India, where the agro-climatic conditions are more suitable for its growth and productivity.

As Haryana Agricultural University (HAU) provides scientifically verified advice tailored to the agro-climatic zones and prevalent crops of Haryana, we do not have specific, research-backed fertilizer recommendations for Palmyra palm cultivation within the state. Therefore, we cannot provide a recommended dose of fertilizers (Urea, Nano-Urea, DAP, Nano-DAP, NPK, SSP, Potash, and Sulphur) for Palmyra based on HAU's research for Haryana.
