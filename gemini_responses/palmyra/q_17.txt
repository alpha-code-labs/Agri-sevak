Palmyra palm (Borassus flabellifer) is primarily a tropical palm species that thrives in coastal and humid regions, predominantly found in southern India. The agro-climatic conditions of Haryana, characterized by a semi-arid to arid climate with extreme temperatures, are generally not suitable for the successful cultivation of Palmyra.

Consequently, Haryana Agricultural University (HAU) does not have specific research-based recommendations or a package of practices for the cultivation of Palmyra, including the recommended doses of organic manures like Farmyard Manure (FYM), Vermicompost, or Sagarika, as it is not a crop promoted or grown in the state.
