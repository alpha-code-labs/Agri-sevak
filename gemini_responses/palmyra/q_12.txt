Scale insects and Mealybugs are common sap-sucking pests that can affect Palmyra (Borassus flabellifer) palms, causing yellowing of fronds, stunted growth, and in severe cases, defoliation and reduced yield. They excrete honeydew, which leads to the growth of sooty mold, further hindering photosynthesis.

Here's a scientifically verified approach for their control:

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategy:**

1.  **Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
    *   **Regular Monitoring:** Periodically inspect the fronds, especially the undersides and leaf axils, for early signs of infestation.
    *   **Pruning Infested Fronds:** For accessible fronds, prune and destroy heavily infested leaves to reduce pest populations. Ensure proper disposal away from the palm.
    *   **Maintain Tree Health:** Ensure the palm receives adequate water and nutrients to improve its natural resistance to pests.
    *   **Encourage Natural Enemies:** Protect and encourage beneficial insects like ladybird beetles and parasitic wasps, which are natural predators of scale insects and mealybugs. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficials.
    *   **Strong Water Spray:** For young or accessible palms, a strong jet of water can dislodge mealybugs and scale crawlers.

2.  **Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved):**

    **A. For Foliar Application (Suitable for young palms or accessible lower fronds):**
    When applying, ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of the fronds where pests often reside.

    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at a rate of 1.25 - 1.5 ml per litre of water. This is an insect growth regulator that interferes with the molting process of nymphs.
    *   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:** Apply at a rate of 0.75 - 1.0 ml per litre of water. This is a systemic insecticide that moves both upwards and downwards in the plant, providing good control of sucking pests.
    *   **Horticultural Mineral Oil:** Apply at a concentration of 10 - 20 ml per litre of water (1-2% solution). This works by smothering the insects, blocking their breathing pores. It is effective against all stages, especially crawlers and mealybugs. Apply during cooler parts of the day to avoid phytotoxicity.

    **B. For Systemic Application (Soil Drench for Tall Palms):**
    For tall Palmyra palms where foliar spraying is not feasible, systemic insecticides applied as a soil drench can be effective. The chemical is absorbed by the roots and translocated throughout the tree, making the sap toxic to the pests.

    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply 5-10 ml per tree, mixed in 5-10 litres of water, as a drench around the base of the tree in the root zone. The exact dosage depends on the age and size of the tree.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply 5-10 grams per tree, mixed in 5-10 litres of water, as a drench around the base of the tree in the root zone. The exact dosage depends on the age and size of the tree.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, and protective clothing when handling and applying chemicals.
*   **Timing:** Apply insecticides during the cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize evaporation and maximize efficacy, and to protect pollinators if any are active.
*   **Repeat Applications:** Depending on the severity of the infestation, repeat applications may be necessary. Always follow the instructions on the product label regarding re-application intervals and pre-harvest intervals (PHI).
*   **Consult Experts:** For precise dosages and application methods tailored to the specific age and size of your Palmyra palms and the severity of the infestation, it is highly recommended to consult with local agricultural extension officers or experts from Haryana Agricultural University.
