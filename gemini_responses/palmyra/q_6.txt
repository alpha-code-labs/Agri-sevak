As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I must provide scientifically verified advice.

Based on current scientific literature and agricultural advisories for Palmyra palm (*Borassus flabellifer*), the specific viral diseases mentioned (Leaf curl, Mosaic, Yellow vein clearing, Stripe, Tristeza, and Stunt virus) are **not known to affect Palmyra**. These viral diseases are typically associated with other crop species (e.g., vegetables, cereals, citrus).

Therefore, specific control measures for these viruses in Palmyra are not applicable.
