As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Palmyra (Borassus flabellifer) in Haryana:

1.  **Grasshopper:**
    Grasshoppers can occasionally feed on the foliage of Palmyra, especially on younger plants or during severe outbreaks.
    *   **Control Measure:**
        *   For foliar feeding, spray with **Malathion 50% EC** at 2.5 ml per litre of water. Ensure thorough coverage of the affected foliage. For very tall trees, this may require specialized spraying equipment.

2.  **Painted bug (Bagrada hilaris):**
    This is not known to affect Palmyra. Painted bugs are primarily pests of cruciferous crops (e.g., mustard, cabbage).

3.  **Red cotton bug (Dysdercus cingulatus):**
    This is not known to affect Palmyra. Red cotton bugs are primarily pests of cotton and other malvaceous plants.

4.  **Black ants:**
    Black ants are generally not direct pests of Palmyra, meaning they do not feed on the plant tissue. However, they can be a nuisance, build nests in the tree, or more commonly, tend to other sap-sucking pests (like mealybugs or scales) for their honeydew, thereby protecting them from natural enemies. If ants are present, it is advisable to check for other primary sap-sucking pests.
    *   **Control Measure:**
        *   If ants are nesting at the base of the tree or are a significant nuisance, drench the soil around the base of the palm with **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** at 2.5 ml per litre of water. Apply sufficient quantity to soak the soil around the root zone.
        *   If ants are tending other sap-sucking pests on the foliage, controlling the primary sap-sucking pest will often lead to the ants dispersing.
