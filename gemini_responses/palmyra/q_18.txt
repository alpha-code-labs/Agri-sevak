As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the use of Growth Regulators/Hormones and micronutrients for Palmyra (Borassus flabellifer) in Haryana:

It is important to note that Palmyra is not a major cultivated crop in Haryana, and specific research-backed recommendations for growth regulators from HAU for this particular palm are limited. However, general principles of palm nutrition and plant physiology apply.

1.  **Ethrel (Ethephon):**
    This is not known to affect Palmyra in terms of recommended applications for growth regulation or yield enhancement. **Ethephon** is primarily used as a ripening agent or for latex stimulation in other crops, but its application for Palmyra is not a standard or recommended practice.

2.  **2,4-D (2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid):**
    This is not known to affect Palmyra in terms of recommended applications as a growth regulator or hormone. **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid** is predominantly known and used as a selective herbicide. While auxins can be used in tissue culture or for specific fruit set applications in some crops, its direct application as a growth regulator to mature Palmyra palms is not recommended.

3.  **Boron:**
    Boron is an essential micronutrient crucial for the healthy growth, flowering, and fruit development of all palms, including Palmyra. While not a hormone, its deficiency can severely impair growth and development, thus regulating plant processes. If boron deficiency is suspected (symptoms include crumpled or malformed leaves, poor fruit set, or necrosis of young tissues), its application is recommended.

    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   Apply 50-100 g of **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate) per palm per year. This can be split into two applications (e.g., 25-50 g twice a year).
        *   Alternatively, use 30-60 g of **Solubor** (Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate) per palm per year, also in split doses.
        *   Apply the material in a band around the base of the palm, within the drip line, and incorporate it into the soil.

    *   **Foliar Spray (for quick correction of deficiency):**
        *   Prepare a 0.2% solution of **Borax** by dissolving 2 g of **Borax** per litre of water.
        *   Alternatively, prepare a 0.1-0.15% solution of **Solubor** by dissolving 1-1.5 g of **Solubor** per litre of water.
        *   Spray the solution thoroughly on the fronds, ensuring good coverage. Repeat if necessary, typically at intervals of 2-3 weeks until symptoms subside.

    *   **Note:** Always conduct a soil and/or leaf tissue analysis to confirm boron deficiency before application, as excessive boron can be toxic to plants.
