As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified information regarding irrigation management for Palmyra (Borassus flabellifer) in the context of Haryana.

Palmyra is a highly drought-tolerant palm species, especially once established. It is not typically cultivated as an intensively irrigated crop in Haryana, unlike cereals or vegetables. Therefore, the concept of "first irrigation," "second irrigation," and a structured irrigation schedule, as applied to field crops, is generally not relevant for established Palmyra palms.

Here's a breakdown of irrigation considerations for Palmyra:

1.  **Establishment Phase (Young Plants):**
    *   **First Irrigation:** Immediately after planting seedlings or young palms. This is crucial for settling the soil around the roots and initiating growth.
    *   **Subsequent Irrigations:** For the first 1-2 years after planting, regular watering is essential, especially during dry periods, to ensure proper establishment and root development.
        *   Depending on soil type (sandy soils require more frequent watering than clayey soils) and prevailing weather conditions, irrigate every 7-15 days during dry seasons.
        *   The aim is to keep the root zone moist but avoid waterlogging.
        *   **Water Volume:** Approximately 10-20 litres of water per plant per irrigation, adjusted based on soil moisture status and plant size.

2.  **Mature Palms:**
    *   Once established (typically after 2-3 years), Palmyra palms are highly resilient to drought and can thrive under rain-fed conditions in most parts of Haryana, especially where annual rainfall is adequate.
    *   **Scheduled Irrigation:** There are no defined "first irrigation" or "second irrigation" schedules for mature Palmyra palms as they are generally not managed as intensively irrigated crops.
    *   **Supplemental Irrigation:** In cases of prolonged severe drought (e.g., dry spells extending beyond 3-4 months), supplemental irrigation may be beneficial to maintain vigor, improve overall health, and potentially enhance sap or fruit production. However, this is not a standard, routine practice.
    *   If supplemental irrigation is provided to mature trees, it should be deep and infrequent, allowing the soil to dry out between watering events to encourage deep root growth.

3.  **Sprinkler Use:**
    *   **Sprinkler irrigation** is generally not a practical or common method for mature Palmyra palms due to their significant height and the deep root system they develop.
    *   For young plants during the establishment phase, micro-sprinklers or drip irrigation systems could be considered for efficient water delivery, particularly in arid regions or where water conservation is a priority. However, this is not a widely adopted practice for Palmyra cultivation in Haryana.
    *   If irrigation is provided to mature trees, basin irrigation or flood irrigation methods are more suitable to ensure deep water penetration to the root zone, rather than overhead sprinklers.
