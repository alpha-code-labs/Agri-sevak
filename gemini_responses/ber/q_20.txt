Namaste, Kisan Bhaiyon! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the critical role of micronutrients in ensuring healthy growth and optimal fruit production in Ber (Ziziphus mauritiana). Deficiencies can significantly impact yield and fruit quality.

Before any application, it is highly recommended to conduct a soil test to accurately determine the specific nutrient status of your orchard. This will help in precise and efficient nutrient management. Leaf tissue analysis can also confirm deficiencies.

Here's how to address the common micronutrient deficiencies in Ber:

### General Recommendations for Micronutrient Application:

*   **Soil Application:** Best for correcting severe or chronic deficiencies. Apply in a ring around the tree canopy, 30-60 cm away from the trunk, and incorporate lightly into the soil. Ensure adequate soil moisture after application.
*   **Foliar Application:** Provides a quick remedy for visible deficiency symptoms and is effective for maintenance. Spray thoroughly to cover both sides of the leaves. Always add a non-ionic wetting agent (spreader-sticker) for better absorption. Avoid spraying during hot midday hours.

### Specific Micronutrient Deficiencies and Management:

#### 1. Zinc (Zn)

*   **Deficiency Symptoms:** Characterized by "little leaf" (small, narrow leaves), rosetting of leaves at the shoot tips, and interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 150-300 g of **Zinc sulphate monohydrate** (33% Zn) or 250-500 g of **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (21% Zn) per mature tree, once a year, preferably post-harvest (April-May) or before the monsoon.
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.5% solution of **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (5 g per litre of water) or 0.1% solution of **Chelated Zinc** (1 g per litre of water). Apply 2-3 sprays: first before flowering (August-September), and subsequent sprays at 15-20 day intervals if symptoms persist.

#### 2. Iron (Fe) / Ferrous

*   **Deficiency Symptoms:** Prominent interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, which turn pale yellow or even white in severe cases, while veins remain green. Growth is stunted.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 250-500 g of **Ferrous sulphate** (19% Fe) per mature tree, once a year, especially in alkaline soils where iron availability is low.
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.5% solution of **Ferrous sulphate** (5 g per litre of water) or 0.1% solution of **Chelated Iron** (e.g., **Fe-EDTA** or **Fe-DTPA**, 1 g per litre of water). Apply 2-3 sprays on new flushes, starting when symptoms appear, at 10-15 day intervals.

#### 3. Boron (B)

*   **Deficiency Symptoms:** Dieback of growing points, stunted growth, cracking of fruits, internal corking, and poor fruit set. Leaves may become thick and brittle.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 50-100 g of **Borax** (10.5-11.3% B) or 25-50 g of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (20% B) per mature tree, once a year, preferably post-harvest.
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.1-0.2% solution of **Borax** (1-2 g per litre of water) or **Boric acid** (1.7 g per litre of water). Apply 1-2 sprays: first before flowering (August-September) and another after fruit set. Boron is crucial for fruit set and development.

#### 4. Calcium (Ca)

*   **Deficiency Symptoms:** Dieback of young shoots and root tips, distorted new growth, and sometimes poor fruit quality. While less common as a primary micronutrient deficiency in Ber, it can occur in acidic soils or due to water stress.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Soil Application:** If soil test indicates low calcium, apply **Gypsum** (Calcium sulphate) as per soil test recommendations, or 250-500 g of **Calcium nitrate** per tree.
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.5-1% solution of **Calcium nitrate** (5-10 g per litre of water) or **Calcium chloride** (5-10 g per litre of water). Apply 2-3 sprays during fruit development (October-December) to improve fruit firmness and shelf life.

#### 5. Magnesium (Mg)

*   **Deficiency Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, starting from the leaf margins and progressing inwards, while the veins remain green. In severe cases, leaves may develop a reddish-purple tint and drop prematurely.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 250-500 g of **Magnesium sulphate** per mature tree, once a year, preferably post-harvest.
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.5-1% solution of **Magnesium sulphate** (5-10 g per litre of water) when symptoms appear. Repeat after 15-20 days if necessary.

#### 6. Manganese (Mn)

*   **Deficiency Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, similar to iron deficiency but often with small, scattered necrotic (dead) spots appearing later. Growth can be stunted.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 250-500 g of **Manganese sulphate** per mature tree, once a year.
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.25-0.5% solution of **Manganese sulphate** (2.5-5 g per litre of water) or 0.1% solution of **Chelated Manganese** (1 g per litre of water). Apply 2-3 sprays on new flushes, starting when symptoms appear, at 10-15 day intervals.

### Important Considerations:

*   **Timing:** For soil applications, post-harvest (April-May) is generally a good time. Foliar applications are best done during active growth phases, such as pre-flowering, post-fruit set, or when new flushes emerge.
*   **Water Quality:** Use clean water for foliar sprays.
*   **Compatibility:** When mixing multiple chemicals for foliar spray, always check for compatibility to avoid adverse reactions.
*   **Organic Matter:** Regular application of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost significantly improves soil health and the availability of micronutrients.
*   **pH Management:** In highly alkaline soils, the availability of micronutrients like Iron, Zinc, and Manganese can be reduced. Soil amendments to manage pH can be beneficial in the long run.
