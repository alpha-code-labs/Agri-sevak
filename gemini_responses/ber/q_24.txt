As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for Ber (Ziziphus mauritiana) transplantation in Haryana:

### Ideal Transplantation Time, Distance, and Process for Ber

**1. Ideal Transplantation Time:**
The most suitable time for transplanting Ber plants in Haryana is during the monsoon season.
*   **July to August:** This period ensures adequate moisture availability for the young plants to establish quickly and successfully, reducing transplant shock.
*   Alternatively, **February to March** can also be considered, provided assured irrigation facilities are available to support the plants through the hot summer months that follow.

**2. Ideal Transplantation Distance:**
The recommended spacing for Ber plants depends on the cultivar and the desired canopy management, but a standard spacing allows for optimal growth and fruit production.
*   **7 x 7 meters (m):** This spacing is generally recommended for most commercial Ber cultivars, allowing sufficient room for canopy development, air circulation, and ease of cultural operations.
*   For vigorous cultivars or if less intensive pruning is planned, spacing can be extended to **8 x 8 m**.

**3. Transplantation Process:**
A meticulous approach to transplantation ensures high survival rates and vigorous growth of Ber plants.

*   **Pit Preparation (1-2 months in advance):**
    *   Dig pits of **0.9 x 0.9 x 0.9 meters** (length x width x depth) at the marked distances.
    *   Allow the pits to remain open for 15-30 days to expose the soil to sunlight and air, which helps in pest and disease control.
    *   Refill the pits with a mixture of:
        *   Topsoil (from the pit)
        *   **20-25 kg** well-decomposed Farmyard Manure (FYM) or compost
        *   **1 kg** Single Super Phosphate
        *   **50 g** Chlorpyrifos (as a termiticide, if termite infestation is a concern)
        *   **50 g** Carbofuran (as a nematicide, if nematode problems are anticipated)
    *   Mix these components thoroughly and heap the soil slightly above ground level to account for settling.

*   **Selection of Planting Material:**
    *   Obtain healthy, vigorous, and true-to-type budded or grafted plants from a reputable nursery.
    *   Ensure the plants are free from pests and diseases and have a well-developed root system within the polybag or container.

*   **Actual Transplantation:**
    *   On the day of planting, make a small hole in the center of the refilled pit, just large enough to accommodate the root ball of the plant.
    *   Carefully remove the plant from its polybag/container, ensuring the root ball remains intact and undisturbed.
    *   Place the plant in the center of the hole, ensuring that the graft union (the point where the scion was joined to the rootstock) remains **5-10 cm** above the ground level.
    *   Backfill the hole gently with the remaining soil mixture, firming it lightly around the root ball to remove air pockets.
    *   Create a small basin around the plant for efficient watering.

*   **Post-Transplantation Care:**
    *   **Immediate Watering:** Water the newly planted sapling thoroughly immediately after planting to settle the soil around the roots.
    *   **Staking:** Provide a sturdy stake to support the young plant, especially in windy areas, to prevent it from swaying and damaging the root system.
    *   **Mulching:** Apply a layer of organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves) around the base of the plant to conserve soil moisture, regulate soil temperature, and suppress weed growth.
    *   **Protection:** Protect young plants from grazing animals, strong winds, and frost during winter months (if planting in late monsoon/early autumn) by providing suitable shelters or covers.
    *   **Regular Irrigation:** Maintain consistent moisture, especially during the establishment phase and dry spells, but avoid waterlogging.
