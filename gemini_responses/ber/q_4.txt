Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

Wilt and Parawilt are serious concerns for Ber cultivation in Haryana, leading to significant plant mortality if not managed effectively. As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend an integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods for effective control.

**Understanding the Problem:**
Wilt in Ber is primarily caused by the fungus *Fusarium oxysporum* f. sp. *ziziphi*, which infects the roots and blocks the vascular system, leading to wilting and eventual death. Parawilt often refers to a rapid decline, which can be a severe form of wilt or exacerbated by sudden environmental stresses.

Here are the recommended control measures:

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Site Selection and Soil Management:** Ensure good drainage in the orchard. Avoid planting Ber in low-lying areas prone to waterlogging, as this stresses the roots and makes them more susceptible to fungal infections.
*   **Water Management:** Provide adequate and timely irrigation, but avoid over-irrigation, especially during the monsoon or in heavy soils. Water stress (both deficit and excess) can predispose plants to wilt.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Maintain optimal plant health through balanced fertilization. Healthy plants are more resilient to diseases.
*   **Pruning and Sanitation:** Remove and destroy any severely infected or dead plants and branches immediately to reduce the inoculum in the soil. Sanitize pruning tools with a 10% bleach solution after each plant.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** While no variety is completely immune, some varieties like 'Gola' and 'Seb' are generally considered more tolerant than 'Umran'. Consult with HAU for the most suitable and tolerant varieties for your specific region.
*   **Solarization:** In nursery beds or before planting new trees in an affected area, soil solarization during the hot summer months (May-June) for 4-6 weeks can help reduce soil-borne pathogen load.

**2. Biological Control:**
*   **Trichoderma Application:** Apply beneficial fungi like *Trichoderma viride* or *Trichoderma harzianum* to the soil around the root zone. These fungi act as bio-control agents by competing with and parasitizing pathogenic fungi.
    *   **Dosage:** Mix 50-100 g of **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum** formulation per plant with 5-10 kg of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost. Apply this mixture around the base of the tree and lightly incorporate it into the soil, followed by light irrigation. Repeat application annually, especially before the monsoon.
    *   For drenching, use 5-10 g of **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum** per litre of water.

**3. Chemical Control (Soil Drenching):**
For existing trees showing early symptoms or as a prophylactic measure in affected orchards, soil drenching with CIBRC-approved fungicides is recommended.

*   **Systemic Fungicides:**
    *   Drench the soil around the base of the affected plants with a solution of **Carbendazim** at 1-2 g per litre of water. The amount of solution depends on the size of the tree (e.g., 5-10 litres for a mature tree).
    *   Alternatively, use **Thiophanate-methyl** at 1-2 g per litre of water for soil drenching.
    *   Another option is **Propiconazole** at 0.5-1 ml per litre of water for soil drenching.

*   **Contact Fungicides (for root rot complex, if suspected):**
    *   In cases where root rot is also suspected along with wilt, a drench with **Copper Oxychloride** at 2-3 g per litre of water can be beneficial.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Early Detection:** Timely identification of symptoms is crucial for effective management.
*   **Rotation of Chemicals:** To prevent the development of fungicide resistance, it is advisable to rotate different groups of fungicides.
*   **Integrated Approach:** The most effective control is achieved by combining all the above-mentioned methods.
*   **Consultation:** For severe or persistent problems, please contact the plant pathology experts at HAU, Hisar, for specific diagnosis and recommendations.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively manage Wilt and Parawilt in your Ber orchards and ensure healthy yields.
