As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified doses for Growth Regulators/Hormones and Boron in Ber (Ziziphus mauritiana) cultivation in Haryana:

It is crucial to ensure precise measurement and uniform application for optimal results and to avoid phytotoxicity. Always refer to the specific product label for detailed instructions and safety precautions.

### 1. Ethephon (for Fruit Ripening)

*   **Purpose:** To induce early and uniform ripening, and de-greening of Ber fruits, leading to better marketability.
*   **Recommended Dose:** Apply **Ethephon** at a concentration of 250-500 ppm (parts per million) of the active ingredient.
    *   *Example for a 39% SL formulation:* This would typically translate to approximately 0.64 - 1.28 ml of the commercial product per liter of water.
*   **Timing of Application:** Spray when fruits start changing color (physiological maturity), usually 7-10 days before the anticipated harvest.

### 2. 2,4-D (for Fruit Retention)

*   **Purpose:** To reduce premature fruit drop and improve fruit retention, thereby increasing yield. It acts as a growth regulator at very low concentrations.
*   **Recommended Dose:** Apply **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid** (as sodium salt) at a very low concentration of 5-10 ppm of the active ingredient.
    *   *Caution:* Higher concentrations of 2,4-D act as a herbicide and can severely damage the crop. Precise measurement is critical.
    *   *Example for an 80% Sodium salt of 2,4-D formulation:* This would typically translate to approximately 0.00625 - 0.0125 grams of the commercial product per liter of water (or 1.25 - 2.5 grams per 200 liters of water).
*   **Timing of Application:** Spray at the pea stage of fruit development (after fruit set) and repeat if necessary after 15-20 days.

### 3. Boron (as a Micronutrient)

*   **Purpose:** Boron is an essential micronutrient vital for pollen germination, fruit set, fruit development, and preventing fruit cracking and malformation in Ber.
*   **Recommended Dose:** Apply a foliar spray of **Disodium tetraborate decahydrate** (Borax) or **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (Solubor) at a concentration of 0.1-0.2% solution.
    *   This means 1-2 grams of the respective Boron compound per liter of water.
*   **Timing of Application:**
    *   First spray at the pre-flowering stage (bud initiation).
    *   Second spray at the fruit set stage (when fruits are small).
