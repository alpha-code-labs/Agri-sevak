As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), here is the scientifically verified advice for controlling beetles, weevils, and sawflies in Ber (Ziziphus mauritiana) in Haryana:

**1. Beetles:**
Ber plants can be affected by certain leaf-feeding beetles, primarily **leaf chafer beetles** (e.g., *Adoretus* species). These beetles are nocturnal and feed on the leaves, causing irregular holes and notching, especially on young foliage. While white grubs (larvae of *Holotrichia* species) are root feeders, their adult forms are also beetles that can feed on leaves.

**Control Measures for Leaf-Feeding Beetles:**

*   **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect plants, especially in the evening, for signs of feeding damage or the presence of adult beetles.
*   **Cultural Practices:** Maintain good orchard hygiene. In small orchards, hand-picking adult beetles in the evening can be an option, though often impractical for larger areas.
*   **Chemical Control (if infestation is severe):**
    *   Apply insecticides in the evening when beetles are most active.
    *   Recommended CIBRC approved technical chemicals:
        *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** 0.5 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** 0.2 g per litre of water.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** 0.5 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Malathion 50% EC:** 2 ml per litre of water.
    *   Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and observe pre-harvest intervals (PHI) before harvesting fruits.
