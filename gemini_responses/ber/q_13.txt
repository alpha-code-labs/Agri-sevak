The Ber fruit fly (*Carpomyia vesuviana*) is the most destructive pest of Ber (Ziziphus mauritiana) in Haryana, causing significant yield losses. Other general fruit fly species can also infest Ber, but *C. vesuviana* is the primary concern. Effective control requires an integrated pest management (IPM) approach.

Here's a scientifically verified approach for controlling Fruit fly and Ber fly in Ber:

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategy:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Sanitation:** Regularly collect and destroy all fallen, infested Ber fruits by burying them deep in the soil or burning them. This breaks the life cycle of the pest by preventing larvae from pupating in the soil. This practice is crucial from fruit set until harvest.
    *   **Deep Ploughing:** After harvest, deep ploughing around the Ber trees helps expose and destroy pupae hibernating in the soil.
    *   **Pruning:** Prune the trees appropriately to ensure good air circulation and sunlight penetration, which can reduce humidity and make the environment less favorable for the flies.

2.  **Mechanical Methods:**
    *   **Fruit Bagging:** For high-value fruits or small orchards, individual bagging of fruits with paper or cloth bags can effectively protect them from fly infestation.
    *   **Pheromone Traps:** Install Methyl Eugenol traps (for male fruit flies, particularly *Bactrocera* species) at a rate of 10-12 traps per acre, starting from fruit initiation. These traps help monitor pest populations and reduce male populations, thereby disrupting mating.

3.  **Chemical Control:**
    Chemical control should be initiated at the pea-size stage of the fruits and continued at regular intervals, especially during the peak fruiting period. Always adhere to the recommended dosages and pre-harvest intervals (PHI).

    *   **Timing of Application:**
        *   Start spraying when fruits are at the pea-size stage (around 1-2 cm diameter).
        *   Repeat sprays at 15-day intervals, depending on pest pressure and fruit development.
        *   Stop spraying well before harvest, strictly observing the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) mentioned on the product label to ensure fruit safety.

    *   **Recommended Insecticides (CIBRC Approved for Ber):**
        To prevent the development of resistance, it is advisable to rotate insecticides with different modes of action.

        *   **For Foliar Spray:**
            *   **Dimethoate** 30% EC: 1.0 - 1.5 ml per litre of water.
            *   **Malathion** 50% EC: 2.0 ml per litre of water.
            *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: 0.5 - 0.75 ml per litre of water.
            *   **Spinosad** 45% SC: 0.25 - 0.3 ml per litre of water. (Highly effective and safer option).

        *   **Bait Sprays (Effective for adult fruit flies):**
            *   Prepare a bait spray using **Malathion** 50% EC (1.0 ml/L of water) mixed with jaggery or molasses (10 g/L of water). Spray this mixture on small patches of foliage (not the entire tree) or on trap bottles/lures. The sweet attractant draws the adult flies, which then ingest the insecticide.

    *   **Important Considerations:**
        *   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully.
        *   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying.
        *   Ensure thorough coverage of the fruit and foliage during spraying.
        *   Strictly observe the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) for each chemical to avoid pesticide residues in the harvested fruits.
        *   Avoid spraying during flowering to protect pollinators. If spraying is necessary during flowering, do it in the late evening when pollinator activity is minimal.

By integrating these cultural, mechanical, and chemical control measures, farmers can effectively manage Fruit fly and Ber fly populations and protect their Ber crop in Haryana.
