As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the specified pests in Ber (Ziziphus mauritiana) in Haryana:

### Control Measures for Pests in Ber

**1. Borers (e.g., Bark Eating Caterpillar, Stem Borers):**
Borers can cause significant damage by tunneling into the bark and stem.

*   **Mechanical Control:**
    *   Regularly inspect trees for signs of borer activity (e.g., frass, webs, bore holes).
    *   For bark eating caterpillars, remove the silken webs and frass from the affected branches and trunk.
    *   Probe the bore holes with a wire to kill the larvae inside.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Injection:** Inject 2-3 ml of **Chlorpyrifos** (20 EC) directly into the bore holes using a syringe, then plug the holes with mud or wet clay to prevent the borer from escaping and to ensure the insecticide's efficacy.
    *   **Swabbing/Drenching:** For widespread infestation or as a preventive measure, swab the affected trunk and branches with a solution of **Chlorpyrifos** (20 EC) at 2.5 ml/L of water.

**2. Caterpillars (Defoliating Caterpillars):**
Various caterpillar species can defoliate Ber trees, especially during the vegetative growth phase.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Spray with **Quinalphos** (25 EC) at 2 ml/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, spray with **Emamectin benzoate** (5 SG) at 0.2 g/L of water.
    *   Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage, especially the undersides of leaves where caterpillars often feed.

**3. Diamondback Moth (DBM):**
This is not known to affect Ber. The Diamondback moth (*Plutella xylostella*) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower, mustard).

**4. Leaf Folder:**
Leaf folders cause damage by folding leaves and feeding from within, hindering photosynthesis.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Spray with **Quinalphos** (25 EC) at 2 ml/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, spray with **Emamectin benzoate** (5 SG) at 0.2 g/L of water.
    *   Ensure the spray penetrates the folded leaves to reach the larvae inside.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully, including dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) for any applied pesticide to ensure the safety of the fruit for consumption.
*   Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approaches, including regular monitoring, cultural practices, and biological control, should be prioritized for sustainable pest management.
