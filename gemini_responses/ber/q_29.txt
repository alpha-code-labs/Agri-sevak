Dropping (flower drop, fruit drop, and premature fruit shedding) is a common physiological issue in Ber (Ziziphus mauritiana) that can significantly reduce yield. It is often a complex interaction of environmental, nutritional, and hormonal factors. Addressing this requires an integrated approach.

**Causes of Dropping in Ber:**

*   **Physiological Shedding:** Ber trees naturally shed a large percentage of flowers and young fruits to regulate the crop load according to their capacity.
*   **Nutritional Deficiencies:** Lack of essential micronutrients like Boron and Zinc, which are crucial for pollen viability, fertilization, and fruit development.
*   **Water Stress:** Both insufficient and excessive irrigation during critical stages (flowering and fruit set) can lead to dropping.
*   **Temperature Extremes:** High temperatures and low humidity during flowering can impair pollen viability and fertilization.
*   **Pest and Disease Infestations:** While not direct causes of dropping, severe infestations can weaken the tree, making it more susceptible to shedding.
*   **Hormonal Imbalance:** An imbalance of plant hormones (e.g., low auxins, high ethylene) can trigger abscission.

**Control Measures:**

**I. Cultural and Management Practices:**

1.  **Balanced Nutrition:** Conduct regular soil testing to identify nutrient deficiencies. Apply fertilizers based on recommendations. Ensure adequate supply of phosphorus and potassium.
2.  **Micronutrient Management:** Pay special attention to Boron and Zinc, which are critical for fruit set.
3.  **Optimal Irrigation:** Provide adequate irrigation during flowering and fruit development stages. Avoid both waterlogging and drought stress.
4.  **Pruning:** Judicious pruning helps maintain tree vigor and balance the fruit load, preventing overbearing which can lead to excessive drop.
5.  **Pest and Disease Control:** Keep the tree healthy by managing pests (e.g., fruit fly, mealybugs) and diseases (e.g., powdery mildew) that can stress the plant.

**II. Chemical Interventions (CIBRC Approved):**

For effective control of flower and fruit drop, the following plant growth regulators and micronutrients can be applied as foliar sprays at appropriate stages:

*   **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA):**
    *   **Application:** Spray at the pea-size stage of fruits (approximately 2-3 weeks after flowering). A second spray can be given 15-20 days later if needed.
    *   **Dosage:** **10-20 mg/L** (or 10-20 ppm) of active ingredient.
*   **Boron (as Borax or Solubor):**
    *   **Application:** Spray during pre-flowering and again at the fruit set stage.
    *   **Dosage:** **1.0-1.5 g/L** of Borax (10.5% Boron) or **0.5-1.0 g/L** of Solubor (20.5% Boron).
*   **Zinc Sulphate:**
    *   **Application:** Spray during pre-flowering or early fruit set, especially if zinc deficiency is suspected.
    *   **Dosage:** **3-5 g/L** of Zinc Sulphate (21% Zinc) along with **1.5-2.5 g/L** of unslaked lime to neutralize acidity.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read the label of the specific product carefully for detailed instructions and safety precautions.
*   Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage during spraying.
*   The timing of application is crucial for the effectiveness of plant growth regulators.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension specialists for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and the specific Ber variety.
