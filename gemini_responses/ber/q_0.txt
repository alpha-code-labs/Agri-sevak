Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Ber (Ziziphus mauritiana) in Haryana.

Effective management of fungal diseases in Ber requires an Integrated Disease Management (IDM) approach, combining cultural practices with timely and judicious application of CIBRC approved fungicides.

**General Cultural Practices for Disease Management:**

1.  **Orchard Sanitation:** Remove and destroy fallen diseased leaves, twigs, and fruits. This reduces the inoculum source for future infections.
2.  **Pruning:** Prune diseased and dead branches during the dormant season to improve air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce humidity and fungal growth.
3.  **Proper Spacing:** Maintain adequate plant spacing to ensure good air circulation and sunlight penetration.
4.  **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced fertilizers. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can lead to lush, susceptible growth.
5.  **Water Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation late in the day, which can keep foliage wet for prolonged periods, favoring fungal development.

**Specific Fungal Diseases and their Control in Ber:**

Here's how to manage the fungal diseases you've mentioned:

1.  **Powdery Mildew (Oidium erysiphoides / Podosphaera macularis) & Grey Mildew:**
    *   **Symptoms:** This is the most common and destructive fungal disease of Ber. It appears as a white, powdery growth on leaves, young shoots, flowers, and developing fruits. Infected fruits may crack and drop prematurely. Grey mildew often refers to a similar superficial fungal growth, typically managed with the same strategies.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   Apply fungicides preventively or at the first sign of symptoms, especially during flowering and fruit development.
        *   **Wettable Sulphur** at 2-3 g/L of water.
        *   **Myclobutanil** at 0.4 g/L of water.
        *   **Penconazole** at 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Hexaconazole** at 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Tebuconazole** at 0.75 ml/L of water.

2.  **Anthracnose (Colletotrichum gloeosporioides):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Causes dark, sunken spots on leaves, twigs, flowers, and fruits. On fruits, these spots can enlarge, become soft, and lead to fruit rot.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   Start spraying before flowering and continue at regular intervals, especially during humid conditions.
        *   **Carbendazim** at 1 g/L of water.
        *   **Propiconazole** at 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Thiophanate-methyl** at 1 g/L of water.
        *   **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water.

3.  **Alternaria Leaf Spot, Brown Spot, and General Fungal Blights:**
    *   **Symptoms:** These are general terms for various leaf spot and blight diseases caused by fungi like *Alternaria* species or other pathogens. They typically manifest as irregular brown to black spots on leaves, which can enlarge and coalesce, leading to defoliation or blight of young shoots.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   Apply broad-spectrum fungicides at the appearance of symptoms or during periods favorable for disease development.
        *   **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Chlorothalonil** at 2 g/L of water.
        *   **Carbendazim** at 1 g/L of water.
        *   **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5 ml/L of water.

4.  **Downy Mildew:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Appears as yellowish spots on the upper surface of leaves, with a whitish-grey, downy growth on the corresponding lower surface. Can lead to defoliation.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   Apply systemic and contact fungicides, especially during cool, moist conditions.
        *   **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Propineb** at 2.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Metalaxyl + Mancozeb** (combination product) at 2.5 g/L of water.

5.  **Blast:**
    *   This is not known to affect Ber.

**Important Considerations for Fungicide Application:**

*   **Timing:** Apply fungicides preventively or at the very early stages of disease development for best results. Repeat applications may be necessary based on disease pressure and weather conditions.
*   **Rotation:** Always rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of fungicide resistance.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough coverage of all plant parts (leaves, stems, flowers, fruits) for effective control. Use a spreader/sticker (adjuvant) if recommended.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Strictly observe the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) mentioned on the fungicide label to ensure fruit safety for consumption.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying. Follow all instructions and safety precautions on the product label.
