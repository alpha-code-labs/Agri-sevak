Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the critical importance of balanced nutrition for optimal Ber (Ziziphus mauritiana) production. Macro-nutrient deficiencies, particularly Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K), can significantly impact tree health, yield, and fruit quality.

The most crucial first step in addressing any nutrient deficiency is **soil testing**. A comprehensive soil test report from a reputable lab (like HAU's own soil testing lab) will accurately determine the existing nutrient levels in your orchard soil and allow for precise, tailored recommendations, preventing both under-fertilization and over-fertilization.

However, based on general observations and common deficiencies in Haryana, here's how to address these macro-nutrient deficiencies in Ber:

---

### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

Nitrogen is vital for vegetative growth, leaf development, and photosynthesis.

*   **Symptoms:** General yellowing (chlorosis) of older leaves, stunted growth, reduced leaf size, poor flowering, and premature fruit drop.
*   **Recommendation (for mature trees, 5+ years old, as a general guideline):**
    *   Apply 500-1000 grams of actual Nitrogen per tree per year.
    *   **Fertilizer Options:**
        *   **Urea** (46% N): Apply approximately 1.1 kg to 2.2 kg per tree per year.
        *   **Diammonium phosphate** (18% N, 46% P2O5): Can be used to supply both N and P.
    *   **Application Method & Timing:**
        *   Split the total nitrogen dose into 2-3 applications.
        *   **First Dose (50%):** During the pre-monsoon period (June-July), after pruning and before new flush emerges.
        *   **Second Dose (25%):** During fruit set (October-November).
        *   **Third Dose (25%):** If needed, after harvest (February-March) to support post-harvest recovery.
        *   Apply the fertilizer uniformly in the tree basin, 30-60 cm away from the trunk, and incorporate it into the soil, followed by light irrigation.

### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

Phosphorus is essential for root development, flowering, fruit formation, and energy transfer within the plant.

*   **Symptoms:** Dark green or purplish discoloration of older leaves, stunted growth, poor root development, delayed maturity, and reduced fruit set.
*   **Recommendation (for mature trees, 5+ years old, as a general guideline):**
    *   Apply 250-500 grams of actual Phosphorus (P2O5) per tree per year.
    *   **Fertilizer Options:**
        *   **Single superphosphate** (16% P2O5): Apply approximately 1.6 kg to 3.2 kg per tree per year.
        *   **Diammonium phosphate** (46% P2O5, 18% N): Can be used to supply both P and N.
    *   **Application Method & Timing:**
        *   Apply the entire phosphorus dose once a year, preferably during the pre-monsoon period (June-July), along with the first dose of nitrogen.
        *   Phosphorus is less mobile in the soil, so it should be placed deeper in the root zone. Apply in a band around the tree or in shallow trenches within the drip line, and incorporate well into the soil.

### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency

Potassium plays a crucial role in fruit development, quality (size, sweetness, shelf life), water regulation, and disease resistance.

*   **Symptoms:** Yellowing and scorching/browning of leaf margins (especially older leaves), weak stems, poor fruit development, reduced fruit size, and increased susceptibility to diseases.
*   **Recommendation (for mature trees, 5+ years old, as a general guideline):**
    *   Apply 250-500 grams of actual Potassium (K2O) per tree per year.
    *   **Fertilizer Options:**
        *   **Potassium chloride** (Muriate of Potash, 60% K2O): Apply approximately 420 g to 840 g per tree per year.
        *   **Potassium sulphate** (Sulphate of Potash, 50% K2O): Apply approximately 500 g to 1000 g per tree per year.
    *   **Application Method & Timing:**
        *   Split the total potassium dose into 2 applications.
        *   **First Dose (50%):** During the pre-monsoon period (June-July), along with the first dose of nitrogen and phosphorus.
        *   **Second Dose (50%):** During fruit development (October-November) to enhance fruit quality and size.
        *   Apply the fertilizer uniformly in the tree basin, 30-60 cm away from the trunk, and incorporate it into the soil, followed by light irrigation.

### General Considerations:

*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Always aim for balanced fertilization. Over-application of one nutrient can induce deficiencies of others.
*   **Organic Matter:** Incorporating farmyard manure (FYM) or compost (10-20 kg per tree annually) significantly improves soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability.
*   **Water Management:** Adequate and timely irrigation is crucial for nutrient uptake by the roots. Ensure proper drainage to prevent waterlogging.
*   **Foliar Application:** For quick correction of mild deficiencies, especially N and K, foliar sprays can be considered. However, soil application remains the primary method for macro-nutrients.
    *   For N: **Urea** (1-2% solution, i.e., 10-20 g/L water).
    *   For K: **Potassium sulphate** (1% solution, i.e., 10 g/L water).
    *   Apply during cooler parts of the day.

Remember, these are general guidelines. For precise and most effective nutrient management, please consult your latest soil test report and seek specific advice from HAU experts.
