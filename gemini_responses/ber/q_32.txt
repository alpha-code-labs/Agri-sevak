Namaste! The "drying up" of branches, leaves, fruits, and flowers in Ber (Ziziphus mauritiana) is a serious concern and indicates underlying stress, which can be biotic (diseases, pests) or abiotic (environmental). As a Senior Agronomist, I advise a systematic approach to identify the root cause and implement appropriate management strategies.

**It is crucial to accurately diagnose the specific cause, as "drying up" is a symptom, not a disease itself.**

Here are the potential causes and their management strategies:

---

### 1. Abiotic Factors (Non-Disease/Pest Related)

These factors often predispose the plant to biotic stresses or cause direct damage.

*   **Water Stress:**
    *   **Insufficient Water:** Prolonged drought, especially during critical growth stages (flowering, fruit development), can lead to wilting and drying.
    *   **Excess Water/Waterlogging:** Poor drainage can lead to root suffocation and root rot, impairing water uptake, causing symptoms similar to drought stress.
    *   **Management:** Ensure proper irrigation based on soil moisture and plant needs. Ber is drought-tolerant but requires water during critical phases. Improve drainage in waterlogged areas.
*   **Nutrient Deficiencies:**
    *   Severe deficiencies of certain nutrients (e.g., Potassium, Boron, Calcium) can manifest as leaf scorching, dieback, or poor fruit development leading to drying.
    *   **Management:** Conduct a soil test and leaf analysis to identify specific deficiencies. Apply balanced fertilizers as per recommendations.
*   **Soil Salinity/Alkalinity:**
    *   High salt concentration in the soil or irrigation water can hinder water uptake, leading to symptoms of drought stress, leaf burn, and dieback.
    *   **Management:** Conduct soil testing. Use good quality irrigation water. Adopt practices like gypsum application (for alkalinity) and proper leaching to manage salinity.
*   **Heat Stress/Sunburn:**
    *   Extreme high temperatures, especially during summer, can cause scorching of leaves, fruits, and bark, leading to drying.
    *   **Management:** Provide adequate irrigation during hot periods. For young plants, temporary shading might be beneficial.

### 2. Biotic Factors (Diseases and Pests)

These are common in Ber and can directly cause drying symptoms.

#### A. Fungal Diseases

1.  **Dieback / Anthracnose (Caused by *Colletotrichum gloeosporioides*):**
    *   **Symptoms:** This is a very common and significant problem in Ber. It causes drying of twigs and branches, starting from the tip and progressing downwards. Leaves on affected branches turn brown and dry. Lesions may appear on fruits and flowers, leading to their drying and shedding.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Prune and destroy all affected (dried) branches and twigs well below the visible symptoms during dry periods.
        *   Ensure proper sanitation in the orchard.
        *   **Chemical Control:**
            *   Spray with **Carbendazim** 0.5-1 g/L of water.
            *   Alternatively, use **Mancozeb** 2-2.5 g/L of water.
            *   For severe cases, **Propiconazole** at 0.5 ml/L of water can be effective.
            *   Apply sprays at regular intervals, especially after pruning and during humid conditions.

2.  **Powdery Mildew (Caused by *Oidium erysiphoides*):**
    *   **Symptoms:** While primarily affecting leaves and fruits with a white powdery growth, severe and prolonged infection can lead to premature defoliation, drying of leaves, and poor fruit development, eventually causing fruits to dry and drop.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Chemical Control:**
            *   Spray with **Wettable Sulphur** 2-3 g/L of water.
            *   Alternatively, use **Myclobutanil** 0.4-0.5 g/L of water.
            *   Or **Hexaconazole** 0.5-1 ml/L of water.

3.  **Root Rot / Collar Rot:**
    *   **Symptoms:** If the entire plant or major scaffold branches are showing general wilting and drying, inspect the collar region (junction of stem and soil) and roots. Rotting, discoloration, or gummosis at the collar region indicates root or collar rot.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Improve drainage to prevent waterlogging.
        *   Avoid injury to the collar region during intercultural operations.
        *   **Chemical Control (Drenching):**
            *   Drench the soil around the affected plant with **Propamocarb hydrochloride** at 2-3 ml/L of water.
            *   Alternatively, use a combination product of **Metalaxyl + Mancozeb** at 2-2.5 g/L of water as a drench.

#### B. Insect Pests

1.  **Stem Borer (e.g., *Indarbela quadrinotata*, *Indarbela quadrilineata*):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Presence of holes on the main stem or branches, often covered with silken webs mixed with frass (excreta). The branch above the point of attack gradually dries and dies back.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Locate the boreholes.
        *   Insert a thin wire into the hole to kill the larva.
        *   **Chemical Control:**
            *   Inject a solution of **Chlorpyriphos** (2.5 ml/L of water) into the boreholes using a syringe and then plug the holes with mud.

2.  **Bark Eating Caterpillar (*Indarbela tetraonis*):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Similar to stem borer, but often characterized by extensive webbing and frass on the bark, under which the caterpillar feeds, girdling the branch. This leads to drying of branches.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Remove the webbing and frass to expose the feeding galleries.
        *   **Chemical Control:**
            *   Inject a solution of **Chlorpyriphos** (2.5 ml/L of water) into the galleries and plug them.

3.  **Termites:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Termites can attack the roots and collar region, especially in dry areas, leading to wilting, yellowing, and eventual drying of the plant due to damage to the water-conducting tissues. Presence of mud galleries on the stem base.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Maintain good field sanitation.
        *   **Chemical Control (Drenching):**
            *   Drench the soil around the base of the plant with **Chlorpyriphos** at 2.5 ml/L of water.

#### C. Nematodes

1.  **Root-Knot Nematodes (*Meloidogyne* spp.):**
    *   **Symptoms:** These microscopic worms attack the roots, forming galls (swellings). This impairs the plant's ability to absorb water and nutrients, leading to stunted growth, yellowing, wilting, and eventual drying of the plant, mimicking drought stress.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Diagnosis:** Confirmation requires laboratory analysis of soil and root samples.
        *   **Cultural Practices:** Use healthy, nematode-free planting material. Practice crop rotation (if feasible). Soil solarization can reduce nematode populations in nurseries.
        *   **HAU Recommendation:** If nematode infestation is suspected, please send soil and root samples to the Department of Nematology, HAU, Hisar, for accurate identification and specific recommendations.

### General Integrated Management Practices:

*   **Orchard Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy all dried, diseased, or pest-infested plant parts.
*   **Pruning:** Conduct timely and proper pruning to remove dead/diseased wood and improve air circulation.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure the plant receives adequate and balanced nutrients based on soil test recommendations.
*   **Proper Irrigation:** Avoid both water stress and waterlogging.
*   **Regular Monitoring:** Frequently inspect your Ber plants for early signs of stress, disease, or pest infestation.

**Recommendation:**

Given the general nature of "drying up," it is essential to observe the specific symptoms closely (e.g., where does the drying start, are there spots on leaves/fruits, holes in branches, galls on roots, etc.).

For accurate diagnosis and specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions, I strongly advise you to bring affected plant samples (branches, leaves, fruits, or even a whole small plant if possible) to the Department of Plant Pathology or Entomology at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU), Hisar. Our experts can provide precise identification and the most effective management plan.
