Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding various rot types in Ber (Ziziphus mauritiana). These diseases can significantly impact plant health, yield, and fruit quality. While some terms like "Neck Rot" are often encompassed within "Collar Rot" or "Foot Rot," and "Black Rot" can be a symptom of various fruit rot pathogens, we will address all these conditions comprehensively.

Effective control requires an integrated approach combining cultural practices, sanitation, and judicious use of CIBRC-approved fungicides.

### General Management Principles for Rot Diseases in Ber:

1.  **Site Selection and Drainage:** Plant Ber in well-drained soils. Avoid low-lying areas prone to waterlogging, which is a major predisposing factor for most rot diseases.
2.  **Proper Irrigation:** Avoid overwatering, especially around the base of the trunk. Use drip irrigation where possible to minimize soil moisture around the collar region.
3.  **Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy infected plant parts (leaves, twigs, fruits, fallen debris) from the orchard to reduce inoculum sources.
4.  **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure balanced fertilization. Excessive nitrogen can lead to lush, succulent growth more susceptible to diseases.
5.  **Wound Management:** Protect trees from mechanical injuries during cultivation, pruning, or harvesting, as wounds serve as entry points for pathogens. Prune during dry weather.
6.  **Air Circulation:** Maintain proper tree spacing and prune to ensure good air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce humidity and disease spread.

### Specific Control Measures for Rot Types:

#### 1. Root Rot, Stem Rot, Foot Rot, Collar Rot, Crown Rot, and Neck Rot

These rot types primarily affect the roots, stem base, and collar region of the tree, often leading to wilting, yellowing, defoliation, and eventual death of the plant. Common pathogens include *Phytophthora* spp., *Fusarium* spp., and *Rhizoctonia* spp.

**Symptoms:**
*   Yellowing and wilting of leaves.
*   Stunted growth.
*   Darkening and softening of bark at the soil line (collar region) or on roots.
*   Reddish-brown discoloration of internal wood when bark is peeled.
*   Girdling of the stem base, leading to plant collapse.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural:**
    *   Improve soil drainage by creating raised beds or improving soil texture.
    *   Avoid piling soil around the trunk. Keep the graft union well above the soil line.
    *   Remove severely infected trees to prevent spread.
    *   Avoid injury to the root system and trunk base.
*   **Chemical:**
    *   **Soil Drenching (for existing trees):**
        *   Drench the soil around the base of the affected trees with **Metalaxyl + Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water, or **Fosetyl-aluminium** at 2.5 g/L of water, or **Propamocarb hydrochloride** at 2.5 ml/L of water. Apply 5-10 litres of solution per tree, depending on its size. Repeat after 15-20 days if symptoms persist.
    *   **Trunk/Collar Paste Application (for collar rot):**
        *   Scrape off the infected bark from the collar region. Apply a paste made of **Copper Oxychloride** (50 g in 100 ml of water) to the affected area.

#### 2. Black Rot and Fruit Rot

These diseases primarily affect the developing and ripening fruits, leading to significant post-harvest losses. Common pathogens include *Alternaria alternata*, *Colletotrichum gloeosporioides*, *Phomopsis* spp., and *Rhizopus stolonifer*.

**Symptoms:**
*   Small, water-soaked spots on fruits that enlarge rapidly.
*   Spots turn dark brown to black, often sunken.
*   Fungal growth (mould) may be visible on the surface, especially under humid conditions.
*   Fruits become soft, shrivel, and rot completely.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural:**
    *   Field sanitation: Remove and destroy all fallen and diseased fruits from the orchard.
    *   Harvest fruits at the right stage of maturity.
    *   Handle fruits carefully during harvesting and packing to avoid injuries.
    *   Store fruits in cool, well-ventilated conditions.
*   **Chemical (Pre-harvest sprays):**
    *   Initiate sprays from fruit set and continue at 10-15 day intervals, especially during humid weather.
    *   Spray with **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, use **Carbendazim** at 1 g/L of water.
    *   For broader spectrum control, consider **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5 ml/L of water or **Tebuconazole** at 0.75 ml/L of water.
    *   Ensure thorough coverage of fruits and foliage.

#### 3. Seed Rot and Seedling Rot (Damping-off)

These diseases affect seeds before germination or young seedlings shortly after emergence, leading to poor stand establishment in nurseries. Common pathogens include *Pythium* spp., *Phytophthora* spp., *Rhizoctonia* spp., and *Fusarium* spp.

**Symptoms:**
*   **Seed Rot:** Seeds fail to germinate, rotting in the soil.
*   **Pre-emergence Damping-off:** Seedlings rot before emerging from the soil.
*   **Post-emergence Damping-off:** Young seedlings emerge but collapse at the soil line, often appearing water-soaked and constricted at the base.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural:**
    *   Use healthy, disease-free seeds.
    *   Sow seeds in well-drained, sterilized nursery media.
    *   Avoid overcrowding of seedlings.
    *   Maintain optimal soil moisture; avoid overwatering.
    *   Ensure good ventilation in the nursery.
*   **Chemical:**
    *   **Seed Treatment:**
        *   Treat Ber seeds before sowing with **Carbendazim** at 2 g/kg of seed, or **Thiram** at 2.5 g/kg of seed, or **Captan** at 2.5 g/kg of seed.
    *   **Soil Drench (for nursery beds):**
        *   If damping-off symptoms appear, drench the nursery beds with **Metalaxyl + Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water or **Propamocarb hydrochloride** at 2.5 ml/L of water.

Always follow the manufacturer's instructions for dosage and safety precautions when using any chemical. For specific local conditions or severe outbreaks, it is advisable to consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for tailored advice.
