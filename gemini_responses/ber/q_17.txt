As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified recommendations for the application of organic manures and biostimulants in Ber (Ziziphus mauritiana) cultivation in Haryana:

**1. Farm Yard Manure (FYM)**
Well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure is fundamental for improving soil health, structure, water retention, and nutrient availability for Ber trees.

*   **Young Ber plants (1-3 years old):** 10-20 kg of well-decomposed FYM per plant per year.
*   **Mature Ber trees (3 years and older):** 25-50 kg of well-decomposed FYM per plant per year. For very old and large trees, this can be increased up to 75-100 kg per plant per year.
*   **Application:** FYM should be applied annually, preferably during the winter months (December-January) or before the monsoon rains (June-July), by incorporating it into the soil around the tree basin.

**2. Vermicompost**
Vermicompost is a nutrient-rich organic manure that enhances microbial activity, nutrient uptake, and overall plant vigour. It can be used to supplement or partially replace FYM.

*   **Young Ber plants (1-3 years old):** 2-5 kg of vermicompost per plant per year.
*   **Mature Ber trees (3 years and older):** 5-10 kg of vermicompost per plant per year.
*   **Application:** It can be applied similarly to FYM, incorporated into the soil around the tree basin, preferably during the active growth phases.

**3. Sagarika**
Sagarika is a seaweed extract-based biostimulant, not a bulk organic manure like FYM or vermicompost. It is designed to enhance plant growth, nutrient uptake, improve fruit quality, and increase yield by stimulating natural physiological processes.

*   **Application Method:** Sagarika is typically applied as a foliar spray or through soil drench/drip irrigation.
*   **Foliar Spray:**
    *   **Sagarika (Liquid):** **2.5-5 ml per litre of water.**
    *   Apply at critical growth stages such as pre-flowering, fruit set, and fruit development.
*   **Soil Drench/Drip Irrigation:**
    *   **Sagarika (Liquid):** **1-2 litres per acre**, diluted in appropriate water volume.
*   **Frequency:** Typically 2-3 applications during the crop cycle, depending on the plant's needs and growth stage.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Soil Testing:** Regular soil testing is highly recommended to determine the specific nutrient status of your orchard and tailor the exact doses of organic and inorganic fertilizers for optimal results.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management:** For best results, integrate the use of organic manures with balanced chemical fertilizers based on soil test recommendations.
