Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling sucking pests in Ber orchards in Haryana. Effective management relies on an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods.

Here's how to control Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, Thrips, and Psylla in Ber:

**1. Monitoring and Early Detection:**
*   Regularly inspect your Ber plants, especially new flushes, tender shoots, flowers, and the undersides of leaves, for the presence of pests or symptoms of damage (e.g., curling leaves, sticky honeydew, sooty mould, distorted growth).
*   Early detection allows for timely intervention and prevents pest populations from reaching damaging levels.

**2. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy infested plant parts during regular pruning. This helps reduce pest populations and improves air circulation.
*   **Orchard Sanitation:** Keep the orchard clean by removing weeds, which can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, as it promotes lush, tender growth that is highly attractive to sucking pests. Maintain balanced nutrition.

**3. Biological Control:**
*   Encourage natural enemies such as ladybird beetles, lacewings, syrphid flies, and parasitic wasps. These beneficial insects prey on aphids, whiteflies, and other soft-bodied pests.
*   Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides unless absolutely necessary, as they can harm these natural enemies.

**4. Chemical Control (as a last resort and with caution):**
When pest populations are high and causing economic damage, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always follow the recommended dosages and safety precautions. Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

Here are CIBRC-approved technical chemical names and their recommended dosages for controlling sucking pests in Ber:

*   **For general sucking pests (Aphids, Leafhoppers, Thrips, Whiteflies, Psylla):**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** 0.2 g/L of water.
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** 0.2 g/L of water.
    *   **Dimethoate 30% EC:** 1.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Fipronil 5% SC:** 1.5 ml/L of water.

*   **Specifically for Whiteflies (especially nymphs) and Psylla:**
    *   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:** 0.75 ml/L of water. (Systemic, effective against nymphs and adults).
    *   **Diafenthiuron 50% WP:** 1 g/L of water. (Effective against whiteflies, thrips, and mites).
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** 1.25 ml/L of water. (Insect Growth Regulator, primarily targets nymphs of whiteflies and psyllids).

**Important Considerations for Chemical Application:**

*   **Timing:** Apply insecticides during periods of active pest infestation, typically when new flushes emerge and during flowering/fruit set.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough coverage of the plant, especially the undersides of leaves where many sucking pests reside.
*   **Rotation:** Always rotate insecticides from different chemical groups to prevent the development of pesticide resistance. Do not use the same chemical repeatedly.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Strictly observe the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) mentioned on the insecticide label. This is the minimum time required between the last spray and harvesting to ensure the fruit is safe for consumption.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying. Follow all instructions on the product label.

For specific recommendations tailored to your orchard's situation, it is always advisable to consult with the agricultural extension specialists at HAU, Hisar, or your local Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK).
