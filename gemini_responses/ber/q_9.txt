Mites, including Red spider mite (*Tetranychus* spp.) and Rust mite (*Phyllocoptes indicae*), are significant pests of Ber (Ziziphus mauritiana) in Haryana, causing considerable damage if not managed effectively. As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, I recommend an integrated approach for their control.

**Symptoms of Mite Infestation:**

*   **Red Spider Mite:** Infested leaves show yellowish or reddish-brown spots, bronzing, and eventually turn pale and drop. Fine silken webbing may be visible on the undersurface of leaves and between branches in severe infestations.
*   **Rust Mite:** These microscopic mites cause russeting, bronzing, and thickening of leaves. Fruits may also show a rough, rusty appearance and become malformed, leading to reduced market value.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Mites in Ber:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy severely infested branches and leaves during regular pruning to reduce mite populations.
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the orchard floor free of weeds, as many weeds can act as alternate hosts for mites.
    *   **Proper Irrigation:** Ensure adequate water supply to the trees, as water-stressed plants are more susceptible to mite attacks. Avoid excessive dust, which can favor mite buildup.

2.  **Chemical Control (Acaricides):**
    When mite populations reach damaging levels, chemical intervention becomes necessary. Always ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves, where mites are most prevalent. Rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

    The following CIBRC-approved technical chemicals are recommended for mite control in Ber:

    *   For **Red Spider Mite** and **Rust Mite**:
        *   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** Apply at a concentration of **0.5 - 0.75 ml/L** of water.
        *   **Fenpyroximate 5% SC:** Apply at a concentration of **0.5 - 1.0 ml/L** of water.
        *   **Abamectin 1.9% EC:** Apply at a concentration of **0.5 - 0.75 ml/L** of water.

    *   Primarily for **Red Spider Mite**:
        *   **Propargite 57% EC:** Apply at a concentration of **1.0 - 1.5 ml/L** of water.

    *   Primarily for **Rust Mite** (also effective against powdery mildew):
        *   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP:** Apply at a concentration of **2.0 - 3.0 g/L** of water. This is particularly effective against eriophyid mites (rust mites) and can be used as a preventive measure or at early stages of infestation.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Timing:** Monitor your orchard regularly. Apply acaricides as soon as mite populations are observed to be building up, before they cause significant damage.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure complete and uniform spray coverage, targeting both the upper and lower surfaces of the leaves.
*   **Rotation:** To prevent the development of resistance, rotate between different groups of acaricides with distinct modes of action.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always observe the specified pre-harvest interval (PHI) mentioned on the product label to ensure the safety of the fruit for consumption.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying. Follow all safety instructions and disposal guidelines on the product label.
