As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Scab, Canker, Gummosis, and Lichen in Ber (Ziziphus mauritiana) in Haryana.

### 1. Control of Scab in Ber

Ber scab, caused by the fungus *Sphaceloma ziziphi*, is a significant disease affecting leaves, twigs, and fruits, leading to characteristic scabby lesions, fruit cracking, and deformation.

**Cultural Practices:**
*   Prune and destroy infected twigs and fallen leaves/fruits to reduce inoculum.
*   Ensure proper tree spacing for good air circulation.

**Chemical Control:**
Apply fungicides at fruit set and repeat at 15-day intervals if disease pressure is high, especially during humid conditions.
*   **Mancozeb** 75% WP @ 2.5 g/L of water
*   **Carbendazim** 50% WP @ 1.0 g/L of water
*   **Propiconazole** 25% EC @ 0.5 ml/L of water
*   **Difenoconazole** 25% EC @ 0.5 ml/L of water

### 2. Control of Canker in Ber

Canker diseases in Ber can be caused by various fungal or bacterial pathogens, leading to sunken, discolored lesions on branches and the trunk, often accompanied by gum exudation and eventual dieback.

**Cultural Practices:**
*   Prune out affected branches well below the canker into healthy wood.
*   Disinfect pruning tools with a 10% bleach solution or methylated spirit between cuts to prevent disease spread.
*   Apply a protective fungicidal paste (e.g., Bordeaux paste or a paste made with a systemic fungicide) to large pruning wounds.

**Chemical Control:**
After pruning, spray the entire tree, focusing on the affected areas and pruning cuts.
*   **Copper Oxychloride** 50% WP @ 3.0 g/L of water (effective against both bacterial and fungal cankers, and as a general protective)
*   **Carbendazim** 50% WP @ 1.0 g/L of water (for fungal cankers)
*   **Propiconazole** 25% EC @ 0.5 ml/L of water (for fungal cankers)
*   For wound dressing: Mix **Copper Oxychloride** 50% WP @ 50 g in 100 ml of linseed oil or prepare a thick paste of **Carbendazim** 50% WP with water and apply to fresh wounds.

### 3. Control of Gummosis in Ber

Gummosis is the exudation of amber-colored gum from the bark of the tree. It is often a symptom of stress, mechanical injury, or underlying disease (e.g., fungal infections like *Phytophthora* spp. or *Botryosphaeria* spp.).

**Cultural Practices:**
*   Improve soil drainage to prevent waterlogging, which can stress trees.
*   Avoid mechanical injuries to the trunk and branches.
*   Ensure proper nutrition and irrigation to maintain tree vigor.
*   Carefully scrape off the exuded gum and loose bark from the affected areas.

**Chemical Control:**
If a fungal pathogen, particularly *Phytophthora*, is suspected as the cause, apply fungicides.
*   Drench the soil around the tree base or spray the trunk and affected areas:
    *   **Fosetyl-aluminium** 80% WP @ 2.5 g/L of water
    *   **Propiconazole** 25% EC @ 0.5 ml/L of water (can be used as a trunk paint or spray on affected areas after scraping)
    *   **Copper Oxychloride** 50% WP @ 3.0 g/L of water (as a trunk wash or spray on affected areas after scraping)

### 4. Control of Lichen in Ber

Lichen growths on the bark of Ber trees are common, especially on older trees or in humid environments.

**Nature of Lichens:**
Lichens are symbiotic organisms (a fungus and an alga) that grow superficially on the bark. They are epiphytes and are generally **not parasitic**; they do not directly harm the tree by drawing nutrients from it. Their presence often indicates good air quality. However, very dense growth might sometimes harbor pests or slightly reduce the photosynthetic efficiency of the bark.

**Cultural Practices:**
*   **Improve Tree Vigor:** The best approach is to improve the overall health and vigor of the tree through proper fertilization, irrigation, and pruning to ensure good air circulation and light penetration within the canopy. A healthy, actively growing tree will naturally shed bark and be less prone to dense lichen growth.
*   **Physical Removal:** If aesthetically undesirable or excessively dense, lichens can be gently brushed off the bark using a stiff brush, especially during the dormant season.

**Chemical Control:**
Chemical control for lichens is **rarely necessary or recommended** as they are generally harmless. If, in extreme cases, their presence is deemed problematic and cultural methods are insufficient, a very dilute copper-based spray might be considered, but this should be used with caution due to potential non-target effects.
*   **This is not typically recommended for control as lichens are harmless.** If absolutely necessary for aesthetic reasons or extreme density, a very dilute solution of:
    *   **Copper Oxychloride** 50% WP @ 1.0-1.5 g/L of water (as a dormant spray, but use with caution and only if absolutely necessary).

**Important Note:** Focus on improving tree health and vigor rather than chemical eradication of lichens. Their presence is often a sign of a healthy environment.
