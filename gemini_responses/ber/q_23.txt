As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified seed and soil treatment processes for Ber (Ziziphus mauritiana) cultivation in Haryana:

### Recommended Seed Treatment Process for Ber

Ber is often propagated through budding or grafting onto rootstock, which is typically raised from seeds. Seed treatment is crucial for protecting germinating seeds and young seedlings from soil-borne pathogens, primarily fungal diseases causing damping-off and root rot.

1.  **Fungal Protection (Chemical):**
    *   Treat seeds with a broad-spectrum fungicide to prevent damping-off and seedling blight.
    *   **Method:** Mix the fungicide thoroughly with the seeds before sowing.
    *   **Chemicals and Dosages:**
        *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: 2 grams per kilogram of seed.
        *   **Thiram** 75% WS: 2.5 grams per kilogram of seed.
        *   *Alternatively, a combination of both can be used for broader spectrum protection.*

2.  **Fungal Protection (Biological):**
    *   For an eco-friendly approach or in conjunction with chemical treatment (after chemical treatment, allow a few hours gap), biological agents can be used.
    *   **Method:** Mix the bio-fungicide with the seeds using a small amount of water to ensure uniform coating, then dry in shade before sowing.
    *   **Bio-agent and Dosage:**
        *   **Trichoderma viride** (2% WP): 5-10 grams per kilogram of seed.

### Recommended Soil Treatment Process for Ber

Soil treatment is vital for establishing a healthy Ber orchard, particularly to manage soil-borne diseases, nematodes, and pests like termites, which are prevalent in Haryana.

#### A. Pre-Planting Soil Treatment (Before planting seedlings/grafts in the main field or preparing nursery beds)

1.  **Management of Soil-borne Fungal Pathogens (e.g., Damping-off, Root Rot):**
    *   **Method:** Incorporate bio-fungicides into the soil or drench the soil with chemical fungicides.
    *   **Chemicals and Dosages:**
        *   **Trichoderma viride** (2% WP): 2-4 kilograms per acre, mixed with 100 kg of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost, and broadcast evenly before planting.
        *   For severe issues, soil drenching with **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 2 grams per liter of water can be done in the planting pits or nursery beds.

2.  **Management of Nematodes (e.g., Root-knot nematodes):**
    *   **Method:** Apply nematicides or bio-nematicides to the soil and incorporate them well.
    *   **Chemicals and Dosages:**
        *   **Carbofuran** 3% G: 10-15 kilograms per acre, applied in the planting pits or broadcast and incorporated into the soil before planting.
        *   **Purpureocillium lilacinum** (formerly *Paecilomyces lilacinus*) (1% WP): 2-4 kilograms per acre, mixed with 100 kg of FYM/compost and broadcast before planting.

3.  **Management of Termites:**
    *   Termites are a significant threat to young Ber plants and established trees in Haryana.
    *   **Method:** Treat the soil in planting pits or the entire field area before planting.
    *   **Chemicals and Dosages:**
        *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: 2.5-5 ml per liter of water. Drench the planting pits thoroughly with this solution before planting. For larger areas, apply 2-4 liters of the solution per square meter.
        *   **Fipronil** 0.3% G: 10-15 kg per acre, broadcast and incorporated into the soil before planting.

#### B. Post-Planting Soil Treatment (For established orchards, if issues arise)

1.  **Management of Root Rot/Collar Rot:**
    *   **Method:** Drench the soil around the base of affected trees.
    *   **Chemicals and Dosages:**
        *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: 2 grams per liter of water. Drench 2-5 liters of solution per tree, depending on tree size.
        *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride** 72.2% SL: 2.5 ml per liter of water. Drench around the root zone.
        *   **Trichoderma viride** (2% WP): 50-100 grams per tree, mixed with 1-2 kg of FYM and applied in the root zone.

2.  **Management of Nematodes:**
    *   **Method:** Apply nematicides or bio-nematicides in the root zone.
    *   **Chemicals and Dosages:**
        *   **Carbofuran** 3% G: 30-50 grams per tree, applied in a ring around the tree base and lightly incorporated, followed by irrigation.
        *   **Purpureocillium lilacinum** (1% WP): 50-100 grams per tree, mixed with 1-2 kg of FYM and applied in the root zone.

3.  **Management of Termites:**
    *   **Method:** Drench the soil around the base of affected trees or where termite activity is observed.
    *   **Chemicals and Dosages:**
        *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: 2.5-5 ml per liter of water. Drench the soil around the base of the tree, ensuring the solution penetrates the soil. Repeat if necessary.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label for safe and effective use.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during application.
*   Ensure proper soil moisture for optimal efficacy of soil treatments, especially for granular applications and bio-agents.
*   Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approaches, combining cultural practices, biological control, and judicious use of chemicals, are always recommended for sustainable Ber cultivation.
