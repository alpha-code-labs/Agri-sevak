As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling soil pests like termites and root-knot nematodes in Ber (Ziziphus mauritiana) orchards in Haryana. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is always recommended for sustainable control.

### Control of Termites in Ber

Termites (e.g., *Odontotermes obesus*, *Microtermes obesi*) can cause significant damage to Ber trees by feeding on roots and the collar region, leading to wilting, reduced vigour, and eventually tree death.

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Practices:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove all dead wood, stumps, and debris from the orchard, as these serve as breeding grounds for termites.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** Before planting new orchards, deep ploughing can expose termite colonies to predators and desiccation.
*   **Avoid Direct Contact:** Do not allow organic matter (like farmyard manure) to come into direct contact with the tree trunk, as it can attract termites.

**2. Chemical Control (Soil Drenching):**
For existing trees, soil drenching around the tree basin is an effective method.
*   **Chlorpyrifos 20 EC:** Drench the soil around the tree basin with a solution of **Chlorpyrifos 20 EC** at 2.5 ml per litre of water. Apply 5-10 litres of this solution per tree, depending on the tree size and age, ensuring the solution penetrates the root zone.
*   **Fipronil 5% SC:** Alternatively, drench the soil around the tree basin with **Fipronil 5% SC** at 1.5-2.0 ml per litre of water. Apply 5-10 litres of this solution per tree.

### Control of Nematodes (Root-knot) in Ber

Root-knot nematodes (*Meloidogyne* spp.) are a major problem in Ber, causing characteristic galls or knots on the roots. This leads to stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, reduced fruit yield, and increased susceptibility to other diseases.

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Soil Solarization:** In new orchards, before planting, cover the soil with transparent polyethylene sheets during hot summer months (May-June) for 4-6 weeks. This raises soil temperature and kills nematodes.
*   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost into the soil.
*   **Neem Cake Application:** Apply **Neem Cake** at 1-2 kg per tree, mixed into the soil around the root zone, twice a year (e.g., during pre-monsoon and post-monsoon periods). Neem cake releases compounds that are toxic to nematodes and also improves soil health.

**2. Biological Control:**
*   **Purpureocillium lilacinum:** Apply bio-nematicides containing *Purpureocillium lilacinum* (formerly *Paecilomyces lilacinus*) to the soil. Mix 2.5-5 kg of the formulation with 100 kg of well-decomposed FYM and apply it uniformly around the root zone of the trees in one acre. Alternatively, drench with a solution prepared by mixing 5-10 g of the formulation per litre of water, applying 5-10 litres per tree.

**3. Chemical Control:**
Chemical control should be used judiciously and as part of an IPM strategy.
*   **Carbofuran 3G:** Apply **Carbofuran 3G** granules at 50-100 g per tree, mixed thoroughly into the soil around the root zone, and then irrigate immediately. This application is typically done during the active growth phase.
*   **Fipronil 5% SC:** As mentioned for termites, **Fipronil 5% SC** also exhibits some nematicidal properties. Drenching the soil with **Fipronil 5% SC** at 1.5-2.0 ml per litre of water (5-10 litres solution per tree) can provide some control against nematodes as well.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Diagnosis:** Always confirm the presence of pests through proper diagnosis (e.g., observing galls on roots for nematodes, or tunnels for termites) before applying any control measures.
*   **Safety:** When using chemical pesticides, always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) like gloves, masks, and protective clothing. Follow the instructions and safety precautions mentioned on the product label.
*   **Soil Health:** Maintaining good soil health through organic matter addition and proper irrigation practices can significantly enhance the tree's natural resistance to pests.
*   **Consultation:** For severe infestations or specific local conditions, it is advisable to consult with the local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for tailored recommendations.
