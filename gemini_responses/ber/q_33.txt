As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for weed control in Ber (Ziziphus mauritiana) orchards in Haryana.

Effective weed management in Ber orchards involves an integrated approach combining cultural, mechanical, and chemical methods.

**General Weed Management Principles in Ber Orchards:**

1.  **Manual Weeding:** Essential, especially around the base of young trees, to prevent competition and herbicide contact.
2.  **Mechanical Cultivation:** Shallow cultivation in inter-row spaces can control young weeds and improve soil aeration.
3.  **Mulching:** Applying organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves) around the tree basin helps suppress weeds, conserve soil moisture, and regulate soil temperature.
4.  **Shielded Herbicide Application:** When using non-selective herbicides, always use a shield to prevent spray drift onto Ber plants, especially young trees, as it can cause severe damage.

**Specific Weed Control Recommendations:**

**1. Broadleaf Weeds (including Bathu, Congress grass) and Narrowleaf Weeds:**
For general control of broadleaf and narrowleaf weeds in the inter-row spaces of established Ber orchards, non-selective post-emergence herbicides can be used with extreme caution.

*   **Post-emergence (for actively growing weeds):**
    *   **Glyphosate 41% SL:** Apply at 2.5 - 3.75 Litres per acre in 200-300 Litres of water. Ensure shielded application to prevent contact with Ber plants. This is effective against most annual and perennial broadleaf and narrowleaf weeds.
    *   **Paraquat dichloride 24% SL:** Apply at 2.0 - 4.0 Litres per acre in 200-300 Litres of water. This is a contact herbicide for quick knockdown of annual weeds. Use shielded application.

*   **Pre-emergence (for preventing weed germination, suitable for newly planted orchards or after cultivation):**
    *   **Pendimethalin 30% EC:** Apply at 3.3 Litres per acre in 200-300 Litres of water, immediately after planting or within 2-3 days of transplanting/sowing, on moist soil. This provides control against many germinating broadleaf and narrowleaf weeds.
    *   **Oxyfluorfen 23.5% EC:** Apply at 0.85 - 1.7 Litres per acre in 200-300 Litres of water, as a pre-emergence application.

**2. Amarbail (Cuscuta spp.):**
Amarbail is a parasitic weed and requires specific attention.

*   **Manual Removal:** This is the most effective and recommended method. Regularly inspect Ber plants and manually remove Amarbail strands as soon as they are noticed, before they establish firmly. If infestation is severe on a particular branch, prune the affected branch and destroy the removed material away from the orchard.
*   **Pre-emergence Control:**
    *   **Pendimethalin 30% EC:** Can offer some control against Amarbail seed germination if applied as a pre-emergence herbicide at 3.3 Litres per acre in 200-300 Litres of water, before the parasite emerges.
*   **Post-emergence Chemical Control:** There are no selective herbicides that can kill Amarbail growing on Ber without harming the Ber plant itself. Non-selective herbicides like Glyphosate can only be used as a spot application *very carefully* if the Amarbail is growing on other non-crop hosts in the vicinity and not directly on the Ber plant. Direct application on Amarbail growing on Ber is highly risky and not recommended.

**3. Orobanche (Broomrape):**
Orobanche (Broomrape) is a root parasitic weed primarily affecting crops like mustard, tobacco, and certain vegetables. It is **not known to affect Ber** as a host plant.

**4. Phalaris minor (Little seed canary grass):**
Phalaris minor (Little seed canary grass) is a major weed of wheat and other cereal crops. While it may occasionally be found in general field conditions, it is **not known to be a primary or significant weed problem specifically affecting Ber** orchards that requires dedicated Ber-specific chemical control measures beyond general weed management. If present, it would be controlled by the general narrowleaf weed management strategies mentioned above.
