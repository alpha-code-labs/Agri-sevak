As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the challenges posed by environmental stresses to Ber cultivation in Haryana. Ber (Ziziphus mauritiana) is a hardy fruit crop, but extreme weather conditions can significantly impact its health and productivity. Here's scientifically verified advice to protect your Ber plants:

### **1. Protection from Extreme Cold and Frost**

Ber plants, especially young ones and new flushes, can suffer damage from severe cold and frost, leading to leaf blackening, shoot dieback, and flower/fruit drop.

*   **Pre-Winter Irrigation:** Provide a light irrigation to the orchard a day or two before a predicted cold wave or frost event. Moist soil retains heat better than dry soil and releases it slowly, raising ambient temperature and increasing humidity, which reduces frost formation.
*   **Mulching:** Apply a thick layer (10-15 cm) of organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves, sugarcane trash) around the base of the trees. This insulates the soil, conserves warmth, and protects roots from extreme cold.
*   **Windbreaks:** Plant shelterbelts of tall, hardy trees (e.g., Shisham, Khejri) on the northern and western sides of the orchard to block cold winds. For young plants, temporary windbreaks using hessian cloth or plastic sheets can be erected.
*   **Covering Young Plants:** During severe frost nights, cover young Ber plants with straw, hessian cloth, or plastic sheets to provide direct protection. Ensure the cover does not touch the foliage directly.
*   **Smoke Generation:** In small orchards, creating a smoke screen by burning biomass (e.g., crop residues, dry leaves) on the upwind side during late night/early morning hours can help trap heat and prevent radiation cooling, thereby raising the temperature slightly above freezing point.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure balanced nutrition. Adequate Potassium (K) and Calcium (Ca) can improve cell wall strength and overall plant vigor, enhancing cold tolerance.
    *   Foliar spray of **Potassium Nitrate** at 1-2% concentration (10-20 g/L of water) can be applied before the onset of severe cold.
    *   Foliar spray of **Calcium Chloride** at 0.5% concentration (5 g/L of water) can also be beneficial.
*   **Pruning:** Avoid late-season pruning that stimulates new, tender growth, which is highly susceptible to cold damage.

### **2. Protection from Heat (Loo) and Intense Sunlight**

Ber is generally heat-tolerant, but extreme heat combined with hot, dry winds (Loo) and intense sunlight can cause water stress, leaf scorching, flower/fruit drop, and sunscald.

*   **Adequate Irrigation:** This is paramount during hot periods. Maintain consistent soil moisture, especially during flowering and fruit development stages. Drip irrigation is highly recommended for efficient water use.
*   **Mulching:** Continue applying organic mulch around the trees to reduce soil temperature, conserve moisture, and minimize evaporation.
*   **Windbreaks:** Well-established shelterbelts around the orchard are crucial to mitigate the desiccating effects of hot, dry winds (Loo).
*   **Whitewashing:** Paint the main trunk and exposed scaffold branches with a lime solution (calcium carbonate) or a commercial whitewash product. This reflects sunlight, significantly reduces bark temperature, and prevents sunscald.
*   **Shade Nets:** For very young plants or during periods of extreme heat, temporary shade nets (25-30% shade factor) can be installed to reduce direct sun exposure and heat stress.
*   **Foliar Sprays:**
    *   **Kaolin clay:** Spraying a 5% solution of **Kaolin clay** (50 g/L of water) on foliage and fruits can create a reflective barrier, reducing leaf and fruit surface temperatures and preventing sunburn.
    *   **Potassium Nitrate:** Foliar spray of **Potassium Nitrate** (1-2% concentration) can help plants regulate water loss and improve heat tolerance.
    *   Ensure good spray coverage for effective protection.

By implementing these scientifically sound practices, you can significantly enhance the resilience of your Ber orchard against the harsh environmental stresses prevalent in Haryana. For specific recommendations tailored to your farm, please consult with HAU experts.
