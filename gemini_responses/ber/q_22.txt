As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the recommended cultivation practices for Ber (Ziziphus mauritiana) in Haryana.

It is important to note that commercial Ber orchards are primarily established by planting vegetatively propagated (budded) saplings, not by direct sowing of seeds. Seeds are typically used for raising rootstock in a nursery.

Here are the recommended practices:

**I. For Commercial Ber Orchards (Planting Budded Saplings):**

*   **Planting Method/Pattern:**
    *   **Method:** Pits of 1 m x 1 m x 1 m size are dug during summer (May-June) and left open to solarize. These pits are then refilled with a mixture of topsoil, 20-25 kg farmyard manure (FYM), and 1 kg **Single Super Phosphate** (SSP) per pit before the monsoon. Budded saplings (preferably 1-year-old) are planted during July-August (monsoon season) or February-March.
    *   **Pattern:** Square system of planting is generally followed to facilitate inter-cultivation and other orchard operations.
*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   The bud union (the point where the scion is joined to the rootstock) should be kept slightly above the ground level. The root ball of the sapling should be planted at the same depth as it was in the nursery bag/pot.
*   **Spacing:**
    *   Spacing depends on the variety and the desired canopy management. Common recommended spacing for Ber in Haryana is:
        *   **8 m x 8 m** (for vigorous varieties)
        *   **6 m x 6 m** (for less vigorous varieties or high-density planting with proper pruning)

**II. For Raising Rootstock from Seed (Nursery Stage):**

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   **Method:** Ber seeds have a hard seed coat and require scarification (e.g., soaking in concentrated sulphuric acid for 15-20 minutes followed by thorough washing, or mechanical scarification) to improve germination. The treated seeds are then sown in well-prepared nursery beds or polybags.
    *   **Pattern:** Seeds are sown in rows in nursery beds, typically 15-20 cm apart, with seeds spaced 5-10 cm within the row.
*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   Seeds should be sown at a depth of **1-2 cm**.
*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   The seed dose depends on the desired number of rootstocks and the expected germination percentage. Generally, to raise sufficient rootstock for an acre of orchard (assuming 150-200 plants per acre), approximately **10-15 kg of scarified Ber seeds** would be required for sowing in nursery beds, considering a germination rate of 50-60% and subsequent thinning.
