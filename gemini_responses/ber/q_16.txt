Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend the following fertilizer schedule for Ber (Ziziphus mauritiana) cultivation in Haryana. Please note that these are general recommendations, and a soil test is always advisable for precise nutrient management tailored to your specific field conditions.

**I. Organic Manure:**
*   Apply 25-50 kg of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost per tree annually, preferably during May-June. This improves soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability.

**II. Conventional Chemical Fertilizers (Per Tree Per Year):**

The recommended doses vary with the age of the tree. The fertilizers should be applied in a ring around the tree trunk, 30-60 cm away from the trunk, and mixed into the soil, followed by irrigation.

**A. Young Trees (1-3 Years Old):**
*   **Year 1:**
    *   **Urea**: 110 g
    *   **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)**: 120 g
    *   **Muriate of Potash**: 85 g
    *   **Elemental Sulphur (90% WDG)**: 25 g
*   **Year 2:**
    *   **Urea**: 220 g
    *   **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)**: 240 g
    *   **Muriate of Potash**: 170 g
    *   **Elemental Sulphur (90% WDG)**: 50 g
*   **Year 3:**
    *   **Urea**: 440 g
    *   **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)**: 360 g
    *   **Muriate of Potash**: 250 g
    *   **Elemental Sulphur (90% WDG)**: 75 g

**B. Bearing Trees (4 Years and Above):**
For a fully mature bearing tree (4 years and older), the recommended annual dose is:
*   **Urea**: 875 g
*   **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)**: 545 g
*   **Muriate of Potash**: 420 g
*   **Elemental Sulphur (90% WDG)**: 110 g

**Application Timing for Bearing Trees:**
*   **Phosphorus (DAP) and Potassium (Muriate of Potash)**: Apply the full annual dose after fruit harvest (typically April-May), along with **Elemental Sulphur**.
*   **Nitrogen (Urea)**: Apply half of the annual dose after fruit harvest (April-May) and the remaining half during fruit development (October-November).

**Alternative for Phosphorus and Sulphur:**
*   Instead of **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** and **Elemental Sulphur**, you can use **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)**. If using **SSP**, apply approximately 1.6 kg of **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** per bearing tree annually (to provide the required P2O5 and sufficient Sulphur). In this case, the **Urea** dose would be higher (around 1.1 kg per tree) as **SSP** does not provide nitrogen.

**III. Nano-Fertilizers (Foliar Application):**
Nano-fertilizers are advanced nutrient delivery systems that supplement conventional fertilizers and can help reduce their overall requirement. They are applied as foliar sprays.

*   **Nano Urea (Liquid)**:
    *   **Dose**: 2-4 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Timing**: Apply 2-3 foliar sprays. The first spray can be given during the active vegetative growth phase, and subsequent sprays during pre-flowering and fruit development stages.
    *   **Role**: Supplements nitrogen requirements, enhances nutrient use efficiency, and can potentially reduce conventional **Urea** application by 25-50% when used effectively.
*   **Nano DAP (Liquid)**:
    *   **Dose**: 2-4 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Timing**: Apply 2-3 foliar sprays. The first spray can be given before flowering, and subsequent sprays during fruit set and early fruit development stages.
    *   **Role**: Supplements nitrogen and phosphorus requirements, promotes flowering and fruit set, and can potentially reduce conventional **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** application by 25-50% when used effectively.

**IV. NPK Complex Fertilizers:**
*   **NPK Complex Fertilizers** (e.g., 12:32:16, 19:19:19, 10:26:26) can be used as an alternative to individual fertilizers to meet the N, P, and K requirements. However, the specific dose will depend on the grade of the NPK complex fertilizer chosen. You should calculate the quantity required to provide the elemental N, P2O5, and K2O as recommended for bearing trees. For example, if using a 12:32:16 grade, you would need to adjust the quantity to ensure the tree receives the target 500g N, 250g P2O5, and 250g K2O.

Always ensure proper irrigation after applying granular fertilizers to facilitate nutrient uptake.
