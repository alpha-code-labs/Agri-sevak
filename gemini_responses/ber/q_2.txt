As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling rust diseases in Ber (Ziziphus mauritiana) in Haryana:

Black rust, Brown rust, Yellow rust, and White rust are not known to affect Ber (Ziziphus mauritiana).

The most common and significant rust disease affecting Ber is caused by the fungus *Phakopsora ziziphi-vulgaris*, which often manifests as reddish-brown pustules on the leaves, hence sometimes referred to as 'Red rust'.

**Control Measures for Ber Rust (*Phakopsora ziziphi-vulgaris*):**

**Symptoms:**
Small, reddish-brown, powdery pustules primarily appear on the underside of leaves. Severe infection leads to premature defoliation, weakening the tree and affecting fruit development.

**Management Strategies:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Sanitation:** Collect and destroy all fallen infected leaves and plant debris, especially before the new growing season, to reduce the source of inoculum.
    *   **Pruning:** Ensure proper pruning to maintain an open canopy, which improves air circulation and reduces humidity within the tree, making conditions less favorable for fungal growth.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Maintain balanced nutrition for the trees to enhance their natural resistance and vigor.

2.  **Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
    *   **Timing:** Initiate fungicide application at the first appearance of symptoms, typically during the post-monsoon period or when humidity is high and temperatures are conducive for disease development.
    *   **Application:** Ensure thorough coverage of both the upper and lower surfaces of the leaves. Repeat applications at 10-15 day intervals, depending on disease severity and prevailing weather conditions.

    The following CIBRC approved technical chemical names are recommended:

    *   **Propiconazole** (25% EC): Apply at a concentration of **0.5 ml/L** of water.
    *   **Hexaconazole** (5% SC): Apply at a concentration of **1.0-2.0 ml/L** of water.
    *   **Difenoconazole** (25% EC): Apply at a concentration of **0.5 ml/L** of water.
    *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP): Apply at a concentration of **2.5 g/L** of water.
    *   **Tebuconazole** (25.9% EC): Apply at a concentration of **0.75 ml/L** of water.

    Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions when handling and applying fungicides. Observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) to ensure fruit safety.
