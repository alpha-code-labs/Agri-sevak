As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for managing the mentioned pests in Ber (Ziziphus mauritiana) in Haryana.

**1. Grasshopper:**
Grasshoppers can occasionally cause defoliation in Ber, especially on young plants.
*   **Cultural Control:** Hand-picking and destroying grasshoppers, particularly nymphs, can be effective in small orchards. Maintaining weed-free orchards reduces potential breeding sites.
*   **Chemical Control:** In case of severe infestation, the following CIBRC approved insecticides can be used:
    *   **Malathion 50% EC:** 2.0 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Quinalphos 25% EC:** 2.0 ml per litre of water.
    *   Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.

**2. Painted bug (Bagrada hilaris):**
This is not known to affect Ber. Painted bug is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops like mustard, cabbage, and cauliflower.

**3. Red cotton bug (Dysdercus cingulatus):**
This is not known to affect Ber. Red cotton bug is primarily a pest of cotton and other malvaceous plants.

**4. Black ants:**
Black ants are often secondary pests in Ber, primarily attracted to the honeydew secreted by sucking pests like aphids, mealybugs, or scale insects. They protect these honeydew-producing pests. Direct damage by ants to Ber is usually minimal, but their presence often indicates an underlying sucking pest problem.
*   **Integrated Management:**
    *   **Identify and control primary sucking pests:** If ants are present, thoroughly inspect the tree for aphids, mealybugs, or scale insects. Controlling these primary pests will naturally reduce ant populations.
    *   **Physical Barriers:** Apply a sticky band (e.g., grease band) around the trunk to prevent ants from climbing the tree.
    *   **Chemical Control (for direct ant management or if nesting at the base):**
        *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC:** Drench the soil around the base of the tree with a solution of 2.5 ml per litre of water. This creates a barrier and targets nests.
        *   **Malathion 50% EC:** Spray the trunk and the soil around the base of the tree at 2.0 ml per litre of water to deter ants.
        *   **Fipronil 0.3% GR:** Apply 10-15 kg per acre (or a few grams per tree) as a granular application around the base of the tree, incorporated into the soil, to manage ant nests.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the pesticide label for dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during application.
*   Observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) for any pesticide applied, especially if fruits are present or nearing harvest.
*   For specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions, it is advisable to consult with local agricultural extension services or HAU experts.
