Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I am providing scientifically verified advice for the control of Dieback, Twig blight, and Tikka disease in Ber (Ziziphus mauritiana) cultivation in Haryana.

### Control of Dieback and Twig Blight in Ber

Dieback and Twig blight are serious diseases in Ber, often caused by fungi like *Colletotrichum gloeosporioides* or *Lasiodiplodia theobromae*. They lead to the drying of twigs and branches, significantly impacting tree health and fruit production.

**Symptoms:**
*   Drying of twigs and branches, starting from the tip and progressing downwards.
*   Leaves on affected branches turn yellow, then brown, and eventually fall off.
*   Cankers or lesions may be visible on the bark, sometimes with gum exudation.

**Control Measures:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Pruning:** Regularly inspect trees and prune all affected branches well below the visible symptoms (at least 15-20 cm into healthy wood).
    *   **Sanitation:** Collect and immediately destroy (preferably by burning) all pruned diseased material to prevent further spread of spores.
    *   **Wound Protection:** After pruning, apply a fungicidal paste to the cut ends to prevent re-infection.

2.  **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Fungicidal Paste for Cut Ends:**
        *   Prepare a paste by mixing 50 g of **Copper Oxychloride** 50% WP or 20 g of **Carbendazim** 50% WP in 100 ml of linseed oil or water. Apply this paste thoroughly on all pruning cuts.
    *   **Foliar Sprays:**
        *   Initiate spraying at the first sign of disease, typically during the pre-monsoon period (June-July) or after pruning. Repeat sprays at 15-20 day intervals if the disease persists, especially during humid conditions.
        *   Recommended fungicides:
            *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 0.5 g/L of water.
            *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP at 2.5 g/L of water.
            *   **Propiconazole** 25% EC at 0.5 ml/L of water.
            *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC at 0.5 ml/L of water.
            *   A combination product like **Carbendazim 12% + Mancozeb 63% WP** at 2.0 g/L of water.

### Control of Tikka Disease (Leaf Spot) in Ber

Tikka disease, or leaf spot, in Ber is primarily caused by fungi like *Isariopsis indica* var. *zizyphi* (also known as *Pseudocercospora zizyphi*). It can lead to significant defoliation and reduced photosynthetic activity.

**Symptoms:**
*   Small, circular to irregular, reddish-brown spots appear on the leaves, often with a purplish margin.
*   In severe cases, these spots coalesce, leading to yellowing and premature shedding of leaves.

**Control Measures:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Sanitation:** Collect and destroy fallen infected leaves from the orchard floor to reduce the inoculum source.
    *   **Air Circulation:** Ensure proper spacing between trees and judicious pruning to improve air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce humidity and fungal growth.

2.  **Chemical Control:**
    *   Begin spraying at the appearance of the first symptoms, usually after the monsoon rains. Repeat applications at 15-20 day intervals, depending on disease severity and weather conditions.
    *   Recommended fungicides:
        *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 0.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP at 2.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Chlorothalonil** 75% WP at 2.0 g/L of water.
        *   **Propiconazole** 25% EC at 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Difenoconazole** 25% EC at 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   A combination product like **Carbendazim 12% + Mancozeb 63% WP** at 2.0 g/L of water.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always ensure thorough coverage of the plant canopy during spraying.
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
*   Follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions while handling and applying chemicals.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions.
