Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU), Hisar, I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling Scale insects and Mealybugs in Ber orchards in Haryana. Both these pests are sap-suckers and can cause significant damage if not managed effectively.

Effective control involves an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods.

### General Management Principles:

1.  **Regular Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your Ber plants, especially the undersides of leaves, stems, and fruit calyx, for early signs of these pests.
2.  **Pruning:** Remove and destroy severely infested branches or plant parts. This helps reduce the pest population.
3.  **Weed Management:** Keep the orchard free of weeds, as they can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
4.  **Biological Control:** Encourage natural enemies like ladybird beetles (e.g., *Cryptolaemus montrouzieri* for mealybugs) and parasitic wasps. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

### Chemical Control Measures:

When pest populations are high and cultural/biological methods are insufficient, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and in crevices where these pests hide.

#### For Scale Insects:

Targeting the crawler stage (young, mobile scales) is most effective.

*   **Systemic Insecticides:**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at a concentration of 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at a concentration of 0.2 g per litre of water.
*   **Insect Growth Regulators (IGR):**
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at a concentration of 1.25 ml per litre of water. This is effective against nymphs by disrupting their molting process.
*   **Horticultural Mineral Oil (HMO):**
    *   Apply at a concentration of 10-20 ml per litre of water. HMOs work by suffocating the scales, particularly effective against crawlers and young scales. Ensure good coverage.

#### For Mealybugs:

Mealybugs are often protected by their waxy coating, so systemic insecticides or those with good penetrating action are preferred.

*   **Systemic Insecticides:**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at a concentration of 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at a concentration of 0.2 g per litre of water.
    *   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:** Apply at a concentration of 0.75 ml per litre of water. This insecticide has excellent systemic action, moving both upwards and downwards in the plant.
*   **Insect Growth Regulators (IGR):**
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at a concentration of 1.25 ml per litre of water.
*   **Horticultural Mineral Oil (HMO):**
    *   Apply at a concentration of 10-20 ml per litre of water. Can be effective by smothering mealybugs, especially when applied thoroughly.

### Important Considerations:

*   **Rotation of Chemicals:** To prevent the development of pesticide resistance, rotate insecticides with different modes of action. Do not use the same chemical repeatedly.
*   **Timing of Application:** Early morning or late evening is generally best for spraying to minimize drift and maximize absorption.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, and protective clothing while handling and applying pesticides.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Strictly adhere to the pre-harvest interval mentioned on the pesticide label to ensure the safety of the fruit for consumption.
*   **Water Quality:** Use clean water for mixing pesticides.

For specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions, it is always advisable to consult with the local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts.
