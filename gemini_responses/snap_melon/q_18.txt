As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified recommendations for the use of Growth Regulators/Hormones and Boron in Snap Melon (Cucumis melo var. momordica) in Haryana:

### Recommended Doses for Growth Regulators/Hormones and Boron in Snap Melon

1.  **Ethrel (Ethephon)**
    *   **Purpose:** **Ethephon** is used to promote the production of female flowers, which can lead to an increased number of fruits and higher yields in cucurbits like Snap Melon.
    *   **Recommended Dose:** Apply **Ethephon** 39% SL at a concentration of 100-250 ppm (parts per million).
        *   This translates to approximately **0.25 - 0.65 ml** of **Ethephon** 39% SL per litre of water.
    *   **Timing:** Initiate foliar sprays at the 2-4 true leaf stage of the plant. Apply 2-3 sprays at weekly intervals.

2.  **2,4-D (2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid)**
    *   **Recommendation:** As a Senior Agronomist, I must advise that **2,4-D** is primarily a broadleaf herbicide. Its use as a growth regulator for Snap Melon is generally not recommended due to the high risk of phytotoxicity and severe deformities even at very low concentrations. There are no established recommendations for its safe and beneficial use as a growth regulator in Snap Melon in Haryana.

3.  **Boron**
    *   **Purpose:** Boron is an essential micronutrient critical for pollen viability, pollen tube growth, fertilization, and overall fruit development. Its deficiency can lead to poor fruit set, fruit drop, and malformed fruits.
    *   **Recommended Dose:** Apply a foliar spray of 0.1-0.2% **Borax** solution.
        *   This means dissolving **1 - 2 grams** of **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate) per litre of water.
    *   **Timing:** Apply the first spray at the pre-flowering stage and repeat during the peak flowering period to ensure adequate Boron availability for fruit set.
