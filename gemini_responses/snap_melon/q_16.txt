As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I strongly recommend basing all fertilizer applications on a comprehensive soil test report. This ensures optimal nutrient management, prevents over-application, and promotes sustainable agriculture.

However, in the absence of a soil test, the following general recommendations for Snap Melon (Cucumis melo var. reticulatus) can be followed for typical Haryana soils:

**General NPK Recommendation (Elemental):**
For Snap Melon, a general recommendation is **80-100 kg Nitrogen (N)**, **60 kg Phosphorus (P2O5)**, and **60 kg Potassium (K2O)** per acre. Sulphur and micronutrients are also crucial.

**Fertilizer Schedule (Conventional Fertilizers):**

**1. Basal Application (at sowing/transplanting):**
Apply the following fertilizers and thoroughly mix them into the soil before planting:
*   **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP):** 100 kg/acre
*   **Single Super Phosphate (SSP):** 100 kg/acre
*   **Muriate of Potash (MOP):** 50 kg/acre
*   *This basal application provides approximately 18 kg N, 62 kg P2O5, 30 kg K2O, and 11 kg Sulphur.*

**2. First Top Dressing (30-40 days after sowing):**
Apply the following fertilizer by broadcasting near the plant base and light irrigation:
*   **Urea:** 70 kg/acre

**3. Second Top Dressing (60-70 days after sowing, at fruit set/development stage):**
Apply the following fertilizers by broadcasting near the plant base and light irrigation:
*   **Urea:** 70 kg/acre
*   **Muriate of Potash (MOP):** 50 kg/acre
*   *This completes the NPK requirement, providing a total of approximately 82 kg N, 62 kg P2O5, and 60 kg K2O per acre.*

**Nano-Fertilizers (Supplemental and for Dose Reduction):**

Nano-fertilizers are highly efficient and are primarily recommended for foliar application to supplement conventional fertilizers or to reduce their dosage.

*   **Nano-Urea:**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml/L of water.
    *   **Application:** Apply 2-3 foliar sprays. The first spray can be given 30-40 days after sowing, followed by subsequent sprays at 15-20 day intervals.
    *   **Benefit:** Can potentially reduce the conventional **Urea** application by 25-50%.

*   **Nano-DAP:**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml/L of water.
    *   **Application:** Apply 2 foliar sprays. The first spray at the pre-flowering stage and the second spray at the fruit set/development stage.
    *   **Benefit:** Can potentially reduce the conventional **Diammonium Phosphate** application by 25-50%.

**NPK Complex Fertilizers:**

*   Instead of individual **DAP**, **SSP**, and **MOP** for basal application, complex NPK fertilizers can be used.
*   **Example:** If using **NPK (12:32:16)**, apply approximately 200 kg/acre as a basal dose. This would provide 24 kg N, 64 kg P2O5, and 32 kg K2O.
*   **Adjustment:** Subsequent **Urea** and **Muriate of Potash** applications should be adjusted to meet the remaining N and K requirements.

**Sulphur:**

*   The recommended **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** provides approximately 11 kg of Sulphur per acre, which is generally sufficient.
*   If **SSP** is not used, or if a soil test indicates Sulphur deficiency, apply **Elemental Sulphur (90% WDG)** at 10-15 kg/acre as a basal application.

**Micronutrients:**

*   Based on soil test results, specific micronutrients may be required.
*   **Zinc:** If deficient, apply **Zinc Sulphate (21%)** at 10-15 kg/acre as a basal application.
*   **Boron:** If deficient, apply **Borax (10.5%)** at 5-10 kg/acre as a basal application.
*   Foliar sprays of commercial micronutrient mixtures can also be beneficial, especially during flowering and fruit development stages, at recommended doses by the manufacturer.
