As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following for the ideal transplantation of Snap Melon (Phut):

### Ideal Transplantation Time

Snap Melon is a warm-season crop that thrives in hot, dry weather.
*   **Spring-Summer Season:** The ideal time for transplanting Snap Melon in Haryana is from **mid-February to March**. This ensures the seedlings establish well after the danger of frost has passed and before the peak summer heat becomes too intense for young plants.
*   **Soil Temperature:** Ensure the soil temperature is consistently above 18°C for optimal root development and growth.

### Ideal Transplantation Distance

Proper spacing is crucial for adequate light penetration, air circulation, and fruit development, minimizing disease incidence.
*   **Row-to-Row:** 2.0 - 2.5 meters
*   **Plant-to-Plant:** 0.6 - 0.9 meters
*   This spacing allows for the sprawling vine growth typical of Snap Melon and facilitates cultural operations.

### Ideal Transplantation Process

The transplantation process involves several critical steps to ensure high seedling survival and vigorous growth.

1.  **Nursery Raising:**
    *   **Seed Sowing:** Sow seeds in pro-trays or small polybags (10 cm x 15 cm) filled with a sterile, well-drained growing medium (e.g., cocopeat, vermiculite, or a mixture of soil, sand, and FYM in a 1:1:1 ratio).
    *   **Depth:** Sow seeds 1-2 cm deep.
    *   **Watering:** Keep the nursery medium consistently moist but not waterlogged.
    *   **Seedling Age:** Seedlings are typically ready for transplanting when they have developed 3-4 true leaves, which usually takes 3-4 weeks after sowing.

2.  **Hardening Off:**
    *   **Gradual Exposure:** Approximately 7-10 days before transplanting, gradually expose the seedlings to outdoor conditions. This involves reducing watering frequency and increasing exposure to sunlight and wind.
    *   **Purpose:** Hardening off helps the seedlings adapt to the harsher field environment, reducing transplant shock and improving survival rates.

3.  **Field Preparation:**
    *   **Soil Type:** Snap Melon prefers well-drained, fertile sandy loam soils with a pH range of 6.0-7.0.
    *   **Ploughing:** Deep plough the field 2-3 times, followed by harrowing to achieve a fine tilth.
    *   **Organic Matter:** Incorporate 20-25 tonnes per acre of well-rotted Farmyard Manure (FYM) or compost during the last ploughing.
    *   **Bed/Ridge Formation:** Prepare raised beds or ridges at the recommended row-to-row spacing to ensure good drainage and aeration.

4.  **Transplanting:**
    *   **Timing:** Transplant seedlings during the cooler parts of the day, preferably late afternoon or early morning, to minimize stress.
    *   **Hole Preparation:** Dig holes at the recommended plant-to-plant spacing on the prepared beds/ridges.
    *   **Careful Handling:** Gently remove seedlings from the pro-trays or polybags, ensuring minimal disturbance to the root ball.
    *   **Placement:** Place the seedling in the hole, ensuring the top of the root ball is level with the surrounding soil surface. Avoid planting too deep or too shallow.
    *   **Firming:** Gently firm the soil around the base of the seedling to ensure good root-to-soil contact and remove air pockets.

5.  **Post-Transplant Care:**
    *   **Immediate Irrigation:** Immediately after transplanting, provide light irrigation to settle the soil around the roots and help the seedlings establish.
    *   **Moisture Management:** Maintain adequate soil moisture, especially during the initial establishment phase, but avoid overwatering.
    *   **Protection:** If strong winds or intense sun are anticipated immediately after transplanting, temporary shading or windbreaks can be beneficial for very young seedlings, though this is less commonly practiced for Snap Melon.
    *   **Monitoring:** Regularly monitor the transplanted seedlings for signs of stress, pest infestation, or disease symptoms.
