Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the critical importance of protecting your Snap Melon (Kharbuja/Phut) crop from environmental stresses, which can significantly impact yield and quality. Here is scientifically verified advice to safeguard your crop:

### 1. Protection from Extreme Cold and Frost

Snap Melon is highly sensitive to cold temperatures and frost, especially during its early growth stages.

*   **Site Selection:** Avoid planting in low-lying areas where cold air tends to settle, increasing the risk of frost.
*   **Adjusted Planting Time:** Plan your planting schedule to avoid the peak frost periods in your region. For summer crops, ensure planting occurs after the last expected frost.
*   **Pre-Frost Irrigation:** If a frost is predicted, provide a light irrigation to the field a day before. Moist soil retains heat better than dry soil, radiating it slowly through the night and helping to keep the plant canopy warmer.
*   **Mulching:** Apply a thick layer of organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves, sugarcane trash) around the base of the plants. This insulates the soil, conserves moisture, and helps maintain a more stable soil temperature. Black plastic mulch can also absorb solar radiation during the day and release heat at night.
*   **Row Covers/Low Tunnels:** For young plants, use transparent plastic sheets or agro-textile fabric to create low tunnels or individual covers. These trap heat and protect plants from direct cold winds. Ensure to ventilate or remove covers during warm daytime hours to prevent overheating.
*   **Windbreaks:** Planting natural windbreaks (e.g., tall crops like mustard or castor on the windward side) or installing artificial barriers can reduce the chilling effect of cold winds.

### 2. Protection from Heat (Loo) and Intense Sunlight

Haryana experiences severe heat and hot winds (Loo) during summer, along with intense sunlight, which can cause wilting, flower drop, poor fruit set, and sunscald on fruits.

*   **Efficient Irrigation:** Maintain consistent and adequate soil moisture, especially during flowering and fruit development. Drip irrigation is highly recommended as it delivers water directly to the root zone, minimizing evaporation and conserving water. During peak heat, consider light, frequent irrigations.
*   **Mulching:** Organic mulches (straw, crop residues) are excellent for keeping the soil cool, reducing evaporation, and suppressing weeds. For plastic mulch, consider using silver-on-black plastic, where the silver side reflects sunlight and reduces soil temperature, while the black side prevents weed growth.
*   **Shade Nets:** For high-value cultivation, installing 30-50% shade nets over the crop during the hottest parts of the day or throughout the peak summer months can significantly reduce heat stress and sunscald, improving fruit set and quality.
*   **Windbreaks:** Natural or artificial windbreaks can mitigate the desiccating effect of hot, dry winds (Loo), reducing water loss from plants.
*   **Optimal Planting Density:** Ensure appropriate plant spacing to allow for good air circulation while also providing some self-shading by the plant's own foliage.
*   **Foliar Applications:** Certain foliar sprays can help plants cope with heat and intense sunlight stress:
    *   **Kaolin Clay:** Apply a 2.5-5% solution (25-50 g/L water) as a foliar spray. **Kaolin Clay** forms a reflective white film on leaves and fruits, reducing leaf temperature and protecting fruits from sunscald. Reapply after heavy rains or every 10-15 days during peak stress.
    *   **Potassium Nitrate:** Spray a 0.5-1% solution (5-10 g/L water) during periods of high heat. **Potassium Nitrate** helps improve the plant's water use efficiency and enhances its tolerance to heat stress.
    *   **Glycine Betaine:** Apply a 0.5-1% solution (5-10 g/L water) as a foliar spray. **Glycine Betaine** acts as an osmoprotectant, helping plant cells maintain turgor and function under osmotic stress caused by heat and drought.
    *   **Calcium Nitrate:** A foliar spray of 0.5-1% solution (5-10 g/L water) can improve fruit skin integrity and reduce the susceptibility of fruits to sunscald and cracking, especially during rapid growth under intense sunlight.

By implementing these measures, you can significantly reduce the adverse impacts of environmental stresses on your Snap Melon crop, ensuring healthy growth and a bountiful harvest. For specific recommendations tailored to your farm, please consult with your local agricultural extension officer.
