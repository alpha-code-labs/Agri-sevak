Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, I understand the challenges posed by soil pests in crops like Snap Melon. Termites and Root-knot nematodes can significantly reduce yield and plant vigor. Here's a scientifically verified approach for their control in Haryana:

It is crucial to adopt an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods for sustainable control.

### General Management Principles for Soil Pests:

1.  **Field Sanitation:** Remove crop residues, weeds, and other debris that can harbor pests.
2.  **Deep Summer Ploughing:** Exposes soil pests to the sun and predatory birds, reducing their populations.
3.  **Crop Rotation:** Rotate Snap Melon with non-host crops (e.g., cereals like wheat, maize, or sorghum) to break the pest life cycle, especially for nematodes.
4.  **Organic Matter Incorporation:** Adding well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost improves soil health and can enhance natural enemy activity.

### Specific Control Measures:

#### 1. Termites (Odontotermes spp., Microtermes spp.)

Termites feed on roots, stem bases, and germinating seeds, leading to wilting and plant death.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Ensure proper irrigation as termites prefer dry conditions.
    *   Remove any dead wood or stumps from the field that can serve as termite nests.
*   **Chemical Control (Pre-sowing/At Sowing):**
    *   **Soil Treatment:**
        *   Apply **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** at 2.5 Litres per acre. Mix it with 50-100 kg of sand and broadcast evenly over the field before the last ploughing, then incorporate into the soil.
        *   Alternatively, apply **Fipronil 0.3% GR** at 6-8 kg per acre, broadcast and incorporate into the soil before sowing.
    *   **Seedling Root Dip (for transplanted Snap Melon):**
        *   Dip the roots of seedlings in a solution of **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** at 2.5 ml per Litre of water for 30 minutes before transplanting.

#### 2. Nematodes (Root-knot Nematodes - Meloidogyne spp.)

Root-knot nematodes cause galls or knots on roots, impairing water and nutrient uptake, leading to stunted growth, yellowing, and reduced yield.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   **Solarization:** Cover the moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks during hot summer months (May-June) to raise soil temperature and kill nematodes.
    *   **Neem Cake Application:** Incorporate **Neem cake** at 200-400 kg per acre into the soil 2-3 weeks before sowing. Neem cake releases compounds that are toxic to nematodes and also promotes beneficial soil microbes.
    *   **Resistant Varieties:** If available for Snap Melon, choose varieties known to have resistance or tolerance to root-knot nematodes.
*   **Biological Control:**
    *   Apply bio-nematicides containing fungi like *Paecilomyces lilacinus* or *Purpureocillium lilacinum* or bacteria like *Bacillus subtilis* as soil application or seed treatment. Follow manufacturer's recommended doses.
*   **Chemical Control (At Sowing/Transplanting):**
    *   **Granular Application:**
        *   Apply **Carbofuran 3% GR** at 10-13 kg per acre in furrows at the time of sowing or around the root zone of plants at transplanting.
        *   Alternatively, apply **Carbosulfan 6% GR** at 10-13 kg per acre in furrows at the time of sowing.
        *   Another option is **Phorate 10% GR** at 4 kg per acre, applied in furrows at sowing.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the chemical product label, including dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Ensure proper disposal of chemical containers.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer for the most current and specific recommendations for your farm.

By implementing these measures, you can effectively manage soil pests in your Snap Melon crop and ensure a healthy yield.
