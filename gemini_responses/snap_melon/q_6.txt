As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling viral diseases in Snap Melon in Haryana.

Firstly, let's address some specific points from your list:

*   **Tristeza:** This is not known to affect Snap Melon. Citrus Tristeza Virus (CTV) primarily affects citrus species.
*   **Stunt virus:** "Stunt" is a symptom caused by various viral infections (like those causing mosaic or leaf curl), rather than a specific virus name for cucurbits. The control measures for the other listed viruses will effectively address the underlying causes of stunting.

Viral diseases such as Leaf curl, Mosaic, Yellow vein clearing, and Stripe in Snap Melon are primarily managed through an integrated approach focusing on preventing infection and controlling the insect vectors that transmit these viruses, as there are no direct viricides available.

Here are the recommended control measures:

**I. Cultural and Agronomic Practices:**

1.  **Resistant Varieties:** Whenever available, planting virus-resistant or tolerant varieties is the most effective and economical control measure. Consult with HAU or local agricultural extension for recommended varieties suitable for Haryana.
2.  **Vector Management:** Most cucurbit viruses (Leaf curl, Yellow vein clearing) are transmitted by whiteflies, while others (Mosaic, Stripe) are transmitted by aphids. Effective vector control is crucial.
    *   **Nursery Management:** Raise seedlings under insect-proof net houses to protect them from early vector infestation.
    *   **Timely Sowing:** Adjust planting dates to avoid periods of high vector population.
    *   **Weed Control:** Regularly remove weeds from the field and surrounding areas, as many weeds serve as alternate hosts for both viruses and their insect vectors.
    *   **Rogueing:** Promptly identify and remove (rogue out) and destroy any infected plants showing symptoms. This reduces the source of inoculum for further spread.
    *   **Mulching:** Use silver or reflective plastic mulches, especially in the early stages of crop growth. These mulches repel whiteflies and aphids, reducing vector landing and virus transmission.
    *   **Barrier Crops:** Planting non-host crops (e.g., maize, sorghum) around the Snap Melon field can act as a physical barrier, reducing vector movement into the main crop.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure balanced fertilization to promote vigorous plant growth, as healthy plants are often more tolerant to viral infections. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can attract sucking pests.
    *   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy crop residues after harvest to eliminate potential overwintering sites for vectors and viruses.

**II. Chemical Control of Vectors (as per CIBRC approved technical chemicals):**

Chemical control aims to reduce the population of insect vectors (whiteflies and aphids) that transmit the viruses. Apply insecticides judiciously, rotating different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

**For Whitefly Control (for Leaf Curl, Yellow Vein Clearing):**

*   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water (or 100-200 ml/acre).
*   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at 0.2-0.4 g/L of water (or 80-100 g/acre).
*   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply at 0.2-0.4 g/L of water (or 100-125 g/acre).
*   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at 1.25 ml/L of water (or 500 ml/acre). This is an insect growth regulator, effective against nymphs.
*   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** Apply at 0.5 ml/L of water (or 200 ml/acre).
*   **Pyriproxyfen 10% EC:** Apply at 1.0-1.25 ml/L of water (or 400-500 ml/acre). This is an insect growth regulator.

**For Aphid Control (for Mosaic, Stripe):**

*   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water (or 100-200 ml/acre).
*   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at 0.2-0.4 g/L of water (or 80-100 g/acre).
*   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply at 0.2-0.4 g/L of water (or 100-125 g/acre).
*   **Flonicamid 50% WG:** Apply at 0.3 g/L of water (or 60 g/acre). This is a selective aphicide.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Spray Coverage:** Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where vectors often reside.
*   **Timing:** Initiate sprays as soon as vectors are observed or symptoms begin to appear, and repeat as necessary based on pest pressure and product label recommendations.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always observe the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) mentioned on the insecticide label to ensure the safety of the produce.
*   **Integrated Pest Management (IPM):** Combine these chemical controls with cultural practices for sustainable and effective management.

By implementing these integrated strategies, you can significantly reduce the incidence and severity of viral diseases in your Snap Melon crop. For specific local recommendations or disease outbreaks, please contact your nearest HAU Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or agricultural extension office.
