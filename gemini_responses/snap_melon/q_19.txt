Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I advise that addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies in Snap Melon (Cucumis melo var. momordica) is crucial for healthy growth and good yield. The first and most important step is always a **soil test** to accurately determine the nutrient status of your field. Visual symptoms are indicative but a soil test provides precise recommendations.

Here's how to address Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium deficiencies in Snap Melon:

### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   General yellowing or pale green colour of older leaves (chlorosis).
*   Stunted plant growth and reduced vigour.
*   Smaller leaves and fruits.

**Correction Measures:**
*   **Basal/Top-dressing Application:**
    *   Apply **Urea** (46% N) at 50-75 kg/acre in 2-3 split doses. For example, apply 1/3 at the time of sowing/transplanting, 1/3 during the vegetative growth stage (20-30 days after sowing), and the remaining 1/3 at the flowering/early fruiting stage.
*   **Foliar Spray (for quick relief):**
    *   In case of severe deficiency symptoms, spray **Urea** at a concentration of 10-15 g/L (1-1.5% solution). Use 200 litres of water per acre. Repeat every 7-10 days until symptoms subside. Ensure complete leaf coverage.

### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   Dark green or purplish discoloration of older leaves, especially on the underside.
*   Stunted growth, poor root development, and delayed maturity.
*   Reduced fruit set and yield.

**Correction Measures:**
*   **Basal Application:**
    *   Apply **Single Super Phosphate** (SSP, 16% P2O5) at 100-150 kg/acre or **Di-ammonium Phosphate** (DAP, 18% N, 46% P2O5) at 50-75 kg/acre at the time of land preparation or sowing. Phosphorus is less mobile in soil, so basal application is most effective.
*   **Foliar Spray (for quick relief, though less effective than soil application for P):**
    *   Spray **Monoammonium Phosphate** (MAP, 12% N, 61% P2O5) or **Di-ammonium Phosphate** (DAP) at a concentration of 5-10 g/L (0.5-1% solution). Use 200 litres of water per acre. Repeat every 7-10 days if necessary.

### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   Yellowing and browning (scorching) of leaf margins, particularly on older leaves.
*   Weak stems, poor fruit development, and reduced fruit quality.
*   Increased susceptibility to diseases and lodging.

**Correction Measures:**
*   **Basal/Top-dressing Application:**
    *   Apply **Muriate of Potash (Potassium Chloride)** (60% K2O) at 40-60 kg/acre or **Sulphate of Potash (Potassium Sulphate)** (50% K2O) at 50-70 kg/acre. Split the application into two doses: half at sowing and the remaining half at the flowering/fruiting stage.
*   **Foliar Spray (for quick relief):**
    *   Spray **Potassium Nitrate** (13% N, 45% K2O) or **Sulphate of Potash (Potassium Sulphate)** at a concentration of 5-10 g/L (0.5-1% solution). Use 200 litres of water per acre. Repeat every 7-10 days until symptoms improve.

### General Recommendations:

*   **Soil Testing is Paramount:** Always conduct a soil test before planting to get precise fertilizer recommendations tailored to your specific field conditions. This prevents over-application and nutrient imbalances.
*   **Balanced Fertilization:** Ensure a balanced application of all macro and micro-nutrients as per soil test recommendations.
*   **Organic Matter:** Incorporate well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost (10-15 tonnes/acre) during land preparation. This improves soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability.
*   **Irrigation:** Ensure adequate and timely irrigation, as water stress can hinder nutrient uptake even if nutrients are present in the soil.
*   **Timing:** Apply fertilizers at appropriate growth stages for maximum efficiency.

By following these scientifically verified practices, you can effectively manage macro-nutrient deficiencies in your Snap Melon crop and ensure a healthy and productive harvest.
