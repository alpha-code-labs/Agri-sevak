Wilt, including Parawilt, is a significant concern for Snap Melon (Phut/Kharbuja) cultivation in Haryana, primarily caused by soil-borne pathogens like *Fusarium oxysporum* f. sp. *melonis* and sometimes *Phytophthora capsici*. Parawilt often refers to a sudden wilting or vine collapse, which can be exacerbated by environmental stresses, root damage, or rapid disease progression. An integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods is crucial for effective management.

**1. Cultural Practices:**

*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available, select Snap Melon varieties known for resistance or tolerance to Fusarium wilt. Consult HAU for recommended varieties suitable for Haryana.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting Snap Melon or other cucurbits in the same field for at least 3-4 years. Rotate with non-host crops like cereals (wheat, maize) or legumes.
*   **Soil Solarization:** During hot summer months (May-June), cover moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks. This helps reduce soil-borne pathogen inoculum.
*   **Water Management:** Ensure proper irrigation to avoid both water stress and waterlogging, as both can predispose plants to wilt. Use drip irrigation to deliver water directly to the root zone and minimize leaf wetness.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Maintain balanced soil fertility. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can make plants more susceptible. Ensure adequate potassium and micronutrients for plant vigor.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Promptly remove and destroy infected plants to prevent the spread of inoculum. Clean tools and equipment after use in infected fields.
*   **Grafting:** Grafting Snap Melon onto resistant rootstocks (e.g., specific squash or gourd rootstocks) can provide excellent protection against Fusarium wilt. This is an advanced technique but highly effective.

**2. Biological Control:**

*   **Bio-fungicides:**
    *   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds with *Trichoderma viride* or *Trichoderma harzianum* at 4-6 g/kg seed.
    *   **Soil Application/Drench:** Apply *Trichoderma viride* or *Trichoderma harzianum* (2.5 kg/acre mixed with 50-100 kg farmyard manure or compost) at the time of planting or as a soil drench around the root zone (5-10 g/L water).
    *   **Pseudomonas fluorescens:** Apply as a seed treatment (10 g/kg seed) or soil drench (5-10 g/L water) for additional protection.

**3. Chemical Control:**

*   **Seed Treatment:**
    *   Treat seeds with **Carbendazim** at 2 g/kg seed.
    *   Alternatively, treat seeds with **Thiram** at 2.5 g/kg seed to protect seedlings from early infection.
*   **Soil Drench/Drip Application:**
    *   For early signs of wilt or as a preventive measure in high-risk areas, apply a soil drench around the root zone.
    *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 1-2 g/L water (200-300 ml solution per plant, or 1-1.5 kg/acre through drip).
    *   **Propamocarb Hydrochloride** 72.2% SL at 2-3 ml/L water (effective against Oomycetes like *Phytophthora capsici* causing wilt and damping-off).
    *   **Metalaxyl-M 4% + Mancozeb 64% WP** at 2-2.5 g/L water (effective against Oomycetes like *Phytophthora capsici*).
    *   Repeat application if necessary, following label instructions and observing pre-harvest intervals.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label for correct dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
*   Consult with HAU extension specialists for the latest recommendations and specific variety information for your region.
