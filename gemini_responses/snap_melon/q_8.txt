Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I advise you on the integrated management of sucking pests in Snap Melon (Cucumis melo var. momordica). Effective control requires a multi-pronged approach combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods.

**Regarding Psylla:** This is not known to affect Snap Melon as a significant pest in Haryana.

For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips, please follow these recommendations:

**I. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy crop residues and weeds, which can harbor pests.
    *   **Resistant Varieties:** If available, choose varieties known to have some tolerance or resistance to these pests.
    *   **Proper Nutrition:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush growth, making plants more attractive to sucking pests. Maintain balanced nutrient levels.
    *   **Timely Sowing:** Adhere to recommended sowing times to avoid peak pest periods.
    *   **Mulching:** Use silver-colored plastic mulch, which can repel aphids and whiteflies, especially in the early stages.

2.  **Mechanical Control:**
    *   **Yellow Sticky Traps:** Install yellow sticky traps (10-15 traps per acre) to monitor and trap adult whiteflies, aphids, and leafhoppers. Replace them regularly.

3.  **Biological Control:**
    *   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Protect beneficial insects like ladybird beetles, lacewings, hoverfly larvae, and parasitic wasps (e.g., *Encarsia formosa* for whiteflies), which naturally prey on or parasitize these pests. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficials.
    *   **Biopesticides:** Consider using neem-based formulations (e.g., Azadirachtin 1500 ppm or 3000 ppm) at 3-5 ml/L of water, especially in the early stages or for mild infestations.

**II. Chemical Control (Use only CIBRC approved chemicals and follow label instructions carefully):**

When pest populations exceed economic threshold levels, chemical intervention may be necessary. Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

**For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips:**

*   **Early Stage Infestation / Low to Moderate Population:**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** 0.5 - 1.0 ml per liter of water (or 100-200 ml per acre).
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** 0.2 - 0.4 g per liter of water (or 80-100 g per acre).
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** 0.2 - 0.4 g per liter of water (or 80-100 g per acre).

*   **Moderate to High Infestation / For specific pests:**
    *   **For Whiteflies (especially nymphs):**
        *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** 1.0 - 1.25 ml per liter of water (or 250-300 ml per acre).
        *   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** 0.5 - 0.75 ml per liter of water (or 150-200 ml per acre).
    *   **For Thrips and Leafhoppers:**
        *   **Fipronil 5% SC:** 1.5 - 2.0 ml per liter of water (or 300-400 ml per acre).
        *   **Dinotefuran 20% SG:** 0.2 - 0.3 g per liter of water (or 60-80 g per acre).
    *   **For Aphids and Whiteflies (feeding deterrent):**
        *   **Pymetrozine 50% WG:** 0.3 - 0.4 g per liter of water (or 120-160 g per acre).

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Rotation of Chemicals:** Never use the same chemical repeatedly. Rotate insecticides from different chemical groups (different modes of action) to prevent pests from developing resistance.
*   **Timing of Application:** Apply insecticides in the early morning or late evening to minimize harm to pollinators and beneficial insects.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where many sucking pests reside.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always observe the specified Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) mentioned on the insecticide label to ensure the safety of the produce.
*   **Safety:** Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying.

For any specific concerns or severe outbreaks, please consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for tailored advice.
