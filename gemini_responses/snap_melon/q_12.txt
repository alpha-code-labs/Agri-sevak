Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling Scale insects and Mealybugs in Snap Melon (Phut/Kharbuja) in Haryana. Both these pests are common polyphagous sap-suckers that can significantly impact cucurbit crops, including Snap Melon.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategy for Scale Insects and Mealybugs in Snap Melon:**

Effective control requires a combination of cultural, biological, and chemical methods.

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Regular Monitoring:** Frequently inspect plants, especially the undersides of leaves, stems, and fruit calyx, for early detection of pests.
*   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy severely infested leaves, stems, or fruits immediately to prevent further spread.
*   **Weed Management:** Keep the field free of weeds, as many weeds can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
*   **Proper Nutrition:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush, soft growth that is more attractive to sucking pests.
*   **Field Sanitation:** After harvest, remove and destroy all crop residues to eliminate overwintering pest populations.

**2. Biological Control:**
*   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Encourage the presence of natural predators like ladybird beetles (e.g., *Cryptolaemus montrouzieri* for mealybugs) and parasitic wasps, which can help keep pest populations in check. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

**3. Chemical Control (Use only when necessary and as per CIBRC guidelines):**
When pest populations are high and cultural/biological methods are insufficient, chemical intervention may be required. Due to the waxy coating of mealybugs and scales, systemic insecticides or insect growth regulators (IGRs) are often more effective. Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and in plant crevices where these pests hide.

**Recommended CIBRC Approved Insecticides for Snap Melon:**

*   **For Scale Insects and Mealybugs (Systemic/IGR):**
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at 1.25 ml per litre of water (or 500 ml per acre). This is an Insect Growth Regulator (IGR) effective against nymphs.
    *   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:** Apply at 0.75 - 1 ml per litre of water (or 300-400 ml per acre). This is a systemic insecticide that moves both upwards and downwards in the plant.
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at 0.5 ml per litre of water (or 200 ml per acre). A systemic insecticide effective against sucking pests.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at 0.2 g per litre of water (or 80 g per acre). Another systemic insecticide from the neonicotinoid group.
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply at 0.2 g per litre of water (or 80 g per acre). A systemic insecticide effective against a wide range of sucking pests.
    *   **Flupyradifurone 200 SL:** Apply at 0.75 - 1 ml per litre of water (or 300-400 ml per acre). A newer systemic insecticide with good efficacy against sucking pests.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Rotation of Chemicals:** To prevent the development of resistance, rotate insecticides with different modes of action. Do not use the same chemical repeatedly.
*   **Spray Timing:** Apply insecticides during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   **Water Volume:** Ensure adequate water volume for thorough coverage, typically 200-400 litres per acre depending on crop canopy.
*   **Safety Precautions:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) while handling and spraying chemicals.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Strictly observe the pre-harvest interval mentioned on the insecticide label to ensure the safety of the produce.
