Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing pests in Snap Melon (Cucumis melo var. momordica) in Haryana.

Here's how to control the mentioned pests:

### 1. Grasshopper

Grasshoppers can cause significant damage by feeding on leaves, stems, and sometimes fruits, especially in young plants.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Keep the field and surrounding areas free of weeds, as weeds provide shelter and alternative food sources for grasshoppers.
    *   Deep plowing after harvest can expose grasshopper eggs, reducing their population in the next season.
    *   Hand-picking can be effective for small infestations, especially in early stages.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   For effective control, apply insecticides when grasshopper populations are high, especially during the early morning or late evening.
    *   **Malathion** 50% EC: Apply at 1.0 - 1.5 litres per acre, diluted in 500-750 litres of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: Apply at 200-250 ml per acre, diluted in 200-400 litres of water.

### 2. Painted Bug (Bagrada hilaris)

This is not known to affect Snap Melon. Painted bug is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops like mustard, cabbage, and cauliflower.

### 3. Red Cotton Bug (Dysdercus cingulatus)

This is not known to affect Snap Melon. Red cotton bug is primarily a pest of cotton and other malvaceous plants, feeding on developing seeds.

### 4. Black Ants

Black ants are generally not direct pests of Snap Melon, meaning they do not feed on the plant itself. However, they are often associated with sucking pests like aphids, whiteflies, or mealybugs, as they "farm" these pests for their honeydew secretions. In such cases, controlling the sucking pests will automatically reduce ant activity. If ants are directly causing issues (e.g., disturbing young seedlings, nesting at the base of plants, or carrying away seeds), direct control might be considered.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Maintain good field sanitation to remove debris and potential nesting sites.
    *   Ensure proper irrigation to avoid overly dry conditions that might attract some ant species.

*   **Chemical Control (if direct control is necessary):**
    *   For soil-dwelling ants or nests near plants, a granular insecticide can be effective.
    *   **Fipronil** 0.3% GR: Apply at 6.0 - 8.0 kg per acre, broadcast or applied near ant hills/plant bases.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully, including dosage, application method, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Consult your local agricultural extension officer for the most current recommendations and to confirm the suitability of these chemicals for your specific farm conditions and local regulations.
