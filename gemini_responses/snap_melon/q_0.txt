As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the importance of timely and effective management of fungal diseases to ensure a healthy Snap Melon crop. Here is scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned fungal diseases in Snap Melon (Cucumis melo var. momordica) in Haryana.

**General Cultural Practices for Fungal Disease Management:**

Before resorting to chemical control, implementing good cultural practices is crucial for preventing and managing fungal diseases:

*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available, choose Snap Melon varieties known for resistance or tolerance to common fungal diseases.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice a 2-3 year crop rotation with non-cucurbit crops to break the disease cycle and reduce inoculum in the soil.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest. Keep the field free of weeds, which can act as alternate hosts for pathogens.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to improve air circulation within the canopy, reducing humidity and fungal growth.
*   **Irrigation Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day, which can keep foliage wet for extended periods. Drip irrigation is preferred. If overhead irrigation is used, do it in the morning to allow leaves to dry quickly.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced fertilization. Excessive nitrogen can lead to lush growth, making plants more susceptible to certain diseases.
*   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds with recommended fungicides to protect against seed-borne pathogens and early seedling diseases.

**Specific Fungal Disease Control in Snap Melon:**

Here's how to manage the specific fungal diseases you've mentioned:

### 1. Alternaria Leaf Spot/Blight (Caused by *Alternaria cucumerina*)

This disease causes small, circular, water-soaked spots that enlarge and become necrotic with concentric rings, often surrounded by a yellow halo.

*   **Preventive Spray:**
    *   **Mancozeb 75% WP:** 2.5 g/L of water (or 2.0-2.5 kg/acre)
    *   **Chlorothalonil 75% WP:** 2.0 g/L of water (or 1.5-2.0 kg/acre)
    *   **Propineb 70% WP:** 2.5 g/L of water (or 2.0-2.5 kg/acre)
*   **Curative/Systemic Spray (if disease is established):**
    *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:** 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water (or 200 ml/acre)
    *   **Pyraclostrobin 20% WG:** 0.3-0.4 g/L of water (or 150-200 g/acre)
    *   **Difenoconazole 25% EC:** 0.2-0.3 ml/L of water (or 100-150 ml/acre)

### 2. Anthracnose (Caused by *Colletotrichum orbiculare*)

Anthracnose causes dark, sunken lesions on leaves, stems, and fruits. On fruits, these lesions can be circular and black, often with pinkish spore masses in humid conditions.

*   **Preventive Spray:**
    *   **Mancozeb 75% WP:** 2.5 g/L of water (or 2.0-2.5 kg/acre)
    *   **Chlorothalonil 75% WP:** 2.0 g/L of water (or 1.5-2.0 kg/acre)
*   **Curative/Systemic Spray:**
    *   **Carbendazim 50% WP:** 0.5-1.0 g/L of water (or 250-500 g/acre)
    *   **Thiophanate Methyl 70% WP:** 0.5-1.0 g/L of water (or 250-500 g/acre)
    *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:** 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water (or 200 ml/acre)
    *   **Pyraclostrobin 20% WG:** 0.3-0.4 g/L of water (or 150-200 g/acre)

### 3. Blast

This is not known to affect Snap Melon.

### 4. Blight (General)

The term "Blight" is broad. If it refers to early blight, it is typically caused by *Alternaria* species, which has been addressed above. If it refers to late blight, it is primarily a potato/tomato disease and not common in Snap Melon. For general blight symptoms, the fungicides recommended for Alternaria Leaf Spot are usually effective.

### 5. Brown Spot

"Brown spot" is a general descriptive term for various leaf spot diseases. Often, these are caused by fungi like *Alternaria* or *Cercospora*. The fungicides recommended for Alternaria Leaf Spot and Anthracnose will generally provide control for most brown spot issues.

*   **General Leaf Spot Control:**
    *   **Mancozeb 75% WP:** 2.5 g/L of water (or 2.0-2.5 kg/acre)
    *   **Chlorothalonil 75% WP:** 2.0 g/L of water (or 1.5-2.0 kg/acre)
    *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:** 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water (or 200 ml/acre)

### 6. Downy Mildew (Caused by *Pseudoperonospora cubensis*)

Downy mildew appears as angular, yellowish spots on the upper leaf surface, which turn purplish-brown. A fuzzy, purplish growth may be visible on the underside of the leaves, especially in humid conditions.

*   **Preventive/Early Stage Spray:**
    *   **Mancozeb 75% WP:** 2.5 g/L of water (or 2.0-2.5 kg/acre)
    *   **Chlorothalonil 75% WP:** 2.0 g/L of water (or 1.5-2.0 kg/acre)
*   **Curative/Systemic Spray:**
    *   **Metalaxyl-M 4% + Mancozeb 64% WP:** 2.0-2.5 g/L of water (or 1.0-1.25 kg/acre)
    *   **Cymoxanil 8% + Mancozeb 64% WP:** 2.0-2.5 g/L of water (or 1.0-1.25 kg/acre)
    *   **Dimethomorph 9% + Mancozeb 60% WP:** 2.0-2.5 g/L of water (or 1.0-1.25 kg/acre)
    *   **Fenamidone 10% + Mancozeb 50% WG:** 2.0-2.5 g/L of water (or 1.0-1.25 kg/acre)
    *   **Fluopicolide 6% + Propamocarb Hydrochloride 60% SC:** 2.0-2.5 ml/L of water (or 800-1000 ml/acre)
    *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:** 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water (or 200 ml/acre)

### 7. Powdery Mildew (Caused by *Podosphaera xanthii* or *Erysiphe cichoracearum*)

Powdery mildew is characterized by white, powdery patches on the upper and lower surfaces of leaves, stems, and sometimes fruits. Severely infected leaves may turn yellow and die.

*   **Preventive/Early Stage Spray:**
    *   **Sulphur 80% WP:** 2.0-3.0 g/L of water (or 1.5-2.0 kg/acre) - *Note: Avoid spraying sulphur when temperatures are very high (>32°C) as it can cause phytotoxicity.*
*   **Curative/Systemic Spray:**
    *   **Myclobutanil 10% WP:** 0.8-1.0 g/L of water (or 400-500 g/acre)
    *   **Penconazole 10% EC:** 0.2-0.3 ml/L of water (or 100-150 ml/acre)
    *   **Hexaconazole 5% EC:** 0.4-0.6 ml/L of water (or 200-300 ml/acre)
    *   **Difenoconazole 25% EC:** 0.2-0.3 ml/L of water (or 100-150 ml/acre)
    *   **Tebuconazole 25.9% EC:** 0.5-0.6 ml/L of water (or 250-300 ml/acre)
    *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:** 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water (or 200 ml/acre)

### 8. Grey Mildew

This is not known to affect Snap Melon. (Note: Grey Mould, caused by *Botrytis cinerea*, can affect cucurbits, but it is distinct from "Grey Mildew" and typically managed with fungicides like **Carbendazim** or **Thiophanate Methyl** if it occurs).

**Important Considerations for Chemical Application:**

*   **Rotation of Fungicides:** To prevent the development of fungicide resistance, it is crucial to rotate fungicides with different Modes of Action (MoA). Do not use the same fungicide or fungicides from the same MoA group repeatedly.
*   **Timing of Application:** Apply fungicides preventively or at the very first sign of disease symptoms for best efficacy.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough coverage of all plant parts, including the undersides of leaves, for contact fungicides.
*   **Water Volume:** Use adequate water volume (typically 200-400 L/acre depending on crop stage) to ensure proper spray coverage.
*   **Safety Precautions:** Always read and strictly follow the instructions, dosage rates, and safety precautions mentioned on the fungicide label. Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Be mindful of the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) for each fungicide to ensure the safety of the produce.

For specific local recommendations and the latest updates, farmers are always encouraged to consult with the plant pathology experts at HAU, Hisar, or their nearest Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK).
