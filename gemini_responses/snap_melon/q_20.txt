Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I advise you on addressing micronutrient deficiencies in Snap Melon (Kharbuja). It is crucial to conduct a soil test to accurately diagnose specific deficiencies before applying any amendments. However, based on common deficiencies observed in Haryana, here's how to address them:

### General Recommendations:
*   **Soil Testing:** Always start with a comprehensive soil test to determine the exact nutrient status and pH of your field. This is the most scientific approach to avoid over-application and ensure targeted nutrient management.
*   **Foliar Application:** Often provides a quicker response for immediate deficiency correction, especially for mobile nutrients. Apply foliar sprays during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late afternoon) to maximize absorption and minimize leaf burn.
*   **Soil Application:** Provides a more sustained supply of nutrients and is ideal for long-term management.

### Addressing Specific Micronutrient Deficiencies in Snap Melon:

#### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency:
*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, small and narrow leaves (often called 'little leaf'), yellowing between veins (interveinal chlorosis) on younger leaves, and sometimes a rosetted appearance.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate** at 10-12 kg/acre or **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** at 20-25 kg/acre, mixed with soil before sowing or as a basal application.
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.5% solution of **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** (5 g/L of water) or 0.1% solution of **Zinc EDTA** (1 g/L of water) at 20-25 and 40-45 days after sowing/transplanting. Repeat if symptoms persist.

#### 2. Iron (Fe) / Ferrous Deficiency:
*   **Symptoms:** Prominent interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, while veins remain green. In severe cases, the entire leaf may turn yellow or even white.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Often less effective in high pH soils. If soil application is chosen, apply **Ferrous Sulphate** at 20-25 kg/acre.
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.5-1% solution of **Ferrous Sulphate** (5-10 g/L of water) or 0.1% solution of **Ferrous EDTA** (1 g/L of water) at the appearance of symptoms. Repeat every 7-10 days until symptoms disappear.

#### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency:
*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, death of growing points (terminal buds), cracking of stems and fruits, poor fruit set, and malformed fruits.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Borax (Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate)** at 4-6 kg/acre, mixed thoroughly with the soil before sowing.
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.1-0.2% solution of **Borax (Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate)** (1-2 g/L of water) or 0.1% solution of **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (1 g/L of water) at flowering and fruit development stages.

#### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency:
*   **Symptoms:** Blossom end rot in fruits (a common issue in cucurbits like Snap Melon), stunted growth, death of growing points, and marginal necrosis (browning) of young leaves.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** For long-term improvement, especially in sodic soils, apply Gypsum (**Calcium Sulphate**) at 200-400 kg/acre. For direct calcium supply, **Calcium Nitrate** can be applied through fertigation.
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.5-1% solution of **Calcium Nitrate** (5-10 g/L of water) or 0.5% solution of **Calcium Chloride** (5 g/L of water) at fruit set and during fruit development.

#### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency:
*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) starting from older leaves, often with a characteristic 'V' shape at the leaf tip. In severe cases, leaves may develop reddish or purplish tints.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Magnesium Sulphate** at 10-20 kg/acre as a basal application.
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.5-1% solution of **Magnesium Sulphate** (5-10 g/L of water) at the appearance of symptoms, repeating every 10-15 days if needed.

#### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency:
*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, similar to iron deficiency but often accompanied by small necrotic (dead) spots or streaks.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Manganese Sulphate** at 10-15 kg/acre, especially in alkaline soils where availability is low.
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.5% solution of **Manganese Sulphate** (5 g/L of water) or 0.1% solution of **Manganese EDTA** (1 g/L of water) at the appearance of symptoms.

### Important Considerations:
*   **Soil pH:** The availability of many micronutrients is highly dependent on soil pH. For instance, iron and manganese become less available in alkaline (high pH) soils, while boron can become toxic in high pH soils if over-applied.
*   **Adjuvants:** Always use a good quality non-ionic spreader/sticker (adjuvant) with foliar sprays to improve coverage and absorption.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management:** Combine these micronutrient applications with balanced NPK fertilization based on soil test recommendations for optimal plant health and yield.
*   **Caution:** Over-application of micronutrients can be toxic to plants. Always follow recommended dosages and consult with local agricultural experts if unsure.

By following these scientifically verified recommendations, you can effectively manage micronutrient deficiencies in your Snap Melon crop and ensure healthy growth and good yields.
