As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies in Snap Melon in Haryana:

### Control of Beetles in Snap Melon

Beetles, particularly the Red Pumpkin Beetle (*Aulacophora foveicollis*), are a significant pest of Snap Melon (and other cucurbits) in Haryana, especially during the seedling stage. They feed on leaves, flowers, and fruits, causing considerable damage.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Approach:**

1.  **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect plants, especially young seedlings, for the presence of adult beetles and feeding damage.
2.  **Cultural and Mechanical Methods:**
    *   **Early Sowing:** Sowing early can help plants establish before the peak beetle population.
    *   **Hand Picking:** Collect and destroy adult beetles, particularly in small plots or during early infestation.
    *   **Ash/Neem Cake Application:** Dusting young plants with wood ash or neem cake powder can deter beetles.
    *   **Clean Cultivation:** Remove weeds and crop residues that can harbor pests.
    *   **Physical Barriers:** Use of fine nets or row covers over young seedlings can protect them from beetle attack.

3.  **Chemical Control (If infestation is severe and cultural methods are insufficient):**
    Apply insecticides when beetle populations are high, especially during the vulnerable seedling stage. Always ensure thorough coverage.

    *   **For young plants (seedling stage):**
        *   **Malathion** 50% EC at 1.0-1.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Carbaryl** 50% WP at 2.0 g/L of water.

    *   **For older plants (if infestation persists or for broader spectrum control):**
        *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL at 0.3 ml/L of water.
        *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG at 0.2 g/L of water.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 0.5 ml/L of water.

    **Important Considerations:**
    *   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label.
    *   Observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) for each chemical to ensure food safety.
    *   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
    *   Apply insecticides during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
