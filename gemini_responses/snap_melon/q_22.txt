As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), here are the recommended cultivation practices for Snap Melon (*Cucumis melo* var. *momordica*) in Haryana:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   Snap Melon is primarily direct-seeded.
    *   It is commonly sown on ridges or in pits. Sowing on ridges (or one side of a furrow) is often preferred as it provides better drainage and allows for efficient irrigation management.
    *   For pit sowing, prepare pits of about 30 cm diameter and 15-20 cm deep.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   Seeds should be sown at a depth of 2-3 cm. Deeper sowing can hinder germination, while shallower sowing can expose seeds to birds or desiccation.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   **Row-to-Row:** 1.5 - 2.5 meters
    *   **Plant-to-Plant:** 0.5 - 1.0 meter
    *   When sowing in pits, space the pits at 1.5 - 2.5 meters between rows and 0.5 - 1.0 meter within the row. Sow 2-3 seeds per pit and thin to 1-2 healthy plants after establishment.

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   A seed rate of 1.5 - 2.5 kg per acre is generally recommended, depending on the variety, germination percentage, and desired plant density.
