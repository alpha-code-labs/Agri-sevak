As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following doses for organic manures in Snap Melon cultivation, based on scientific verification for Haryana's agro-climatic conditions:

*   **Farm Yard Manure (FYM):**
    *   **Dose:** 15-20 tonnes per acre.
    *   **Application:** Use well-decomposed FYM. It should be incorporated thoroughly into the soil during land preparation (ploughing and harrowing) at least 2-3 weeks before sowing or transplanting. This allows for proper decomposition and nutrient release.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 tonnes per acre.
    *   **Application:** Vermicompost can be applied during land preparation, similar to FYM, or as a top-dressing around the plants at the time of sowing/transplanting or during early growth stages. It can also be mixed into the planting pits. Due to its higher nutrient concentration, it can partially substitute FYM.

*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract):**
    *   **Nature:** Sagarika is a seaweed extract-based bio-stimulant, not a bulk organic manure like FYM or vermicompost. It enhances plant growth, flowering, and fruiting by providing natural plant hormones and micronutrients.
    *   **Foliar Spray:**
        *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Application:** Apply as a foliar spray. The first spray can be given 20-25 days after sowing/transplanting. Subsequent sprays can be done at 15-20 day intervals, typically 2-3 sprays during the vegetative and early reproductive stages of the crop.
    *   **Soil Drench/Drip Application:**
        *   **Dose:** 500 ml - 1 litre per acre.
        *   **Application:** Can be applied through drip irrigation or as a soil drench, mixed with irrigation water, during the active growth phases.
