As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding dropping in Snap Melon:

Firstly, it is important to clarify the terminology:
*   **Tinda/Boll dropping:** This is not known to affect Snap Melon. "Tinda" refers to Indian round gourd (*Praecitrullus fistulosus*), and "Boll" is a term primarily associated with cotton. Snap Melon (*Cucumis melo var. momordica*) does not produce Tinda or Bolls.

Regarding **Flower drop and Fruit drop** in Snap Melon, these are primarily physiological issues rather than a specific disease or pest. They can be caused by a combination of environmental stresses, nutritional imbalances, and pollination problems.

**Causes of Flower and Fruit Drop in Snap Melon:**

1.  **Environmental Stress:**
    *   **Temperature Extremes:** High temperatures (above 35°C) or sudden drops in temperature can lead to flower and fruit abortion.
    *   **Water Stress:** Both drought conditions (insufficient irrigation) and waterlogging (excessive irrigation) can severely stress the plant, leading to dropping.
    *   **Humidity:** Very low or very high humidity can affect pollen viability and fertilization.
    *   **Light Intensity:** Insufficient light can reduce photosynthesis, leading to poor fruit set.

2.  **Nutritional Deficiencies:**
    *   **Boron (B):** Critical for pollen germination, pollen tube growth, and fruit set. Deficiency is a common cause of flower and fruit drop.
    *   **Calcium (Ca):** Important for cell wall integrity and overall fruit development.
    *   **Phosphorus (P) and Potassium (K):** Essential for energy transfer and overall plant vigor, which indirectly affects fruit retention.
    *   **Nitrogen (N) Imbalance:** Excessive nitrogen can promote vegetative growth at the expense of reproductive growth, leading to flower drop.

3.  **Pollination Issues:**
    *   **Lack of Pollinators:** Snap Melon flowers require insect pollination (primarily bees). A scarcity of pollinators can result in unfertilized flowers dropping.
    *   **Poor Pollen Viability:** Environmental stresses can reduce the viability of pollen grains.
    *   **Asynchronous Flowering:** Male and female flowers may not open at the same time, leading to missed pollination opportunities.

4.  **Hormonal Imbalance:**
    *   Stress conditions can lead to the production of abscisic acid (ABA) or ethylene, which promote abscission (dropping).

5.  **Excessive Fruit Load:**
    *   Plants naturally shed some flowers or young fruits if they cannot support the development of all potential fruits, a process known as natural thinning.

**Control Measures for Flower and Fruit Drop in Snap Melon:**

An integrated approach focusing on optimal cultural practices, balanced nutrition, and targeted interventions is recommended.

1.  **Optimise Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Irrigation Management:** Maintain consistent soil moisture. Irrigate deeply and regularly, especially during flowering and fruit development. Avoid both water scarcity and waterlogging.
    *   **Timely Sowing:** Sow at the optimal time to avoid extreme temperatures during critical growth stages.
    *   **Weed Control:** Keep the field free of weeds to reduce competition for water, nutrients, and light.
    *   **Pest and Disease Management:** Control any significant pest or disease infestations that can stress the plant and indirectly lead to dropping.

2.  **Enhance Pollination:**
    *   **Encourage Pollinators:** Avoid spraying broad-spectrum insecticides during flowering periods. Consider placing bee hives near the field to improve pollination.
    *   **Hand Pollination:** In small plots, hand pollination can be done by transferring pollen from male flowers to female flowers in the morning hours.

3.  **Balanced Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Soil Testing:** Conduct regular soil tests to determine nutrient status and apply fertilizers based on recommendations.
    *   **Boron Application:** If boron deficiency is suspected or confirmed, apply:
        *   **Borax** (10.5% B): 10-15 kg/acre as a soil application before sowing.
        *   **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (20% B): 1-1.5 g/L of water as a foliar spray at the pre-flowering and fruit-set stages.
    *   **Calcium Application:** If calcium deficiency is suspected, apply:
        *   **Calcium Nitrate** (15.5% N, 18.8% Ca): 5-10 kg/acre as soil application or 5 g/L of water as a foliar spray.
    *   **Balanced Fertilization:** Ensure adequate supply of N, P, and K as per HAU recommendations for Snap Melon, avoiding excessive nitrogen.

4.  **Use of Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs):**
    *   To reduce flower and fruit drop, especially under mild stress conditions, certain CIBRC-approved plant growth regulators can be used.
    *   **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA):**
        *   **Technical Name:** Naphthalene Acetic Acid
        *   **Formulation:** 4.5% SL (Soluble Liquid)
        *   **Dosage:** 2-3 ml per 10 litres of water (equivalent to 9-13.5 ppm)
        *   **Application:** Spray at the pre-flowflowering stage and again at the fruit-set stage. This helps in fruit retention by preventing the formation of the abscission layer.

By implementing these measures, you can significantly reduce flower and fruit drop in Snap Melon and ensure a healthier, more productive crop. Always consult with local agricultural extension services for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions.
