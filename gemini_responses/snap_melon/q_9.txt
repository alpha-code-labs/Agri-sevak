Mites, including Red spider mite (*Tetranychus urticae*) and various Rust mites (*Aculops lycopersici*, *Polyphagotarsonemus latus*), are significant pests of Snap Melon (Kharbuja) in Haryana, especially during hot and dry weather conditions. They cause damage by sucking sap from leaves, leading to yellowing, bronzing, leaf distortion, and reduced fruit quality and yield.

Here's how to control them:

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Approach:**

1.  **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect the underside of leaves for mites, their eggs, and webbing (for red spider mites). Early detection is crucial.
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Maintain good field sanitation by removing weeds, which can act as alternate hosts for mites.
    *   Ensure proper irrigation, as water stress can exacerbate mite problems. Overhead irrigation can sometimes help dislodge mites.
    *   Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can promote lush growth favored by mites.
3.  **Biological Control:** Conserve natural enemies like predatory mites (*Amblyseius* spp.), ladybird beetles, and lacewings by minimizing the use of broad-spectrum insecticides.

**Chemical Control (Acaricides):**

When mite populations are high and causing economic damage, chemical control may be necessary. Always rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development. Apply thoroughly, ensuring coverage on the underside of leaves where mites reside.

Here are some CIBRC approved technical chemical names and their recommended dosages for mite control in cucurbits/melons:

*   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** 0.5 ml per litre of water.
*   **Fenpyroximate 5% SC:** 0.5 ml per litre of water.
*   **Propargite 57% EC:** 1.5 - 2.0 ml per litre of water.
*   **Abamectin 1.9% EC:** 0.4 - 0.5 ml per litre of water.
*   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP:** 2.0 - 3.0 g per litre of water (effective against rust mites and also has some fungicidal properties; avoid application during very hot weather to prevent phytotoxicity).
*   **Fenazaquin 10% EC:** 1.0 ml per litre of water.
*   **Etoxazole 10% SC:** 0.5 ml per litre of water.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the label instructions of the specific product you are using, including pre-harvest intervals (PHI).
*   Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and application.
*   Ensure good spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves.
*   Rotate different classes of acaricides to prevent the development of resistance in mite populations.
*   Consult with your local HAU extension specialist for the most current recommendations and specific product availability in your region.
