As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following fertilizer doses for Oats, keeping in mind the general soil conditions in Haryana. However, for precise recommendations, a soil test is always advisable.

**General Nutrient Requirement for Oats (for fodder or grain):**
*   Nitrogen (N): 60-80 kg/acre
*   Phosphorus (P2O5): 20-30 kg/acre
*   Potassium (K2O): 15-20 kg/acre
*   Sulphur (S): 8-10 kg/acre

Here are the recommended doses using various fertilizer options:

---

**Option 1: Using SSP for Phosphorus and Sulphur**

**Basal Application (at sowing):**
*   **Urea**: 80 kg/acre (provides approximately 36.8 kg N)
*   **SSP (Single Super Phosphate)**: 160 kg/acre (provides approximately 25.6 kg P2O5 and 17.6 kg S)
*   **Potash (Muriate of Potash)**: 35 kg/acre (provides approximately 21 kg K2O)

**Top-dressing (at first irrigation, around 25-30 days after sowing):**
*   **Urea**: 80 kg/acre (provides approximately 36.8 kg N)

**Option 2: Using DAP for Phosphorus**

**Basal Application (at sowing):**
*   **Urea**: 70 kg/acre (provides approximately 32.2 kg N)
*   **DAP (Di-ammonium Phosphate)**: 55 kg/acre (provides approximately 9.9 kg N and 25.3 kg P2O5)
*   **Potash (Muriate of Potash)**: 35 kg/acre (provides approximately 21 kg K2O)
*   **Sulphur**: 10 kg elemental Sulphur/acre

**Top-dressing (at first irrigation, around 25-30 days after sowing):**
*   **Urea**: 70 kg/acre (provides approximately 32.2 kg N)

**Option 3: Using NPK Complex Fertilizers**

If using a complex NPK fertilizer, the dose will depend on its specific grade (e.g., 12:32:16, 10:26:26). As an example for NPK (12:32:16):

**Basal Application (at sowing):**
*   **NPK (12:32:16)**: 80 kg/acre (provides approximately 9.6 kg N, 25.6 kg P2O5, and 12.8 kg K2O)
*   **Potash (Muriate of Potash)**: 12 kg/acre (to supplement K2O to the recommended level)
*   **Sulphur**: 10 kg elemental Sulphur/acre
*   **Urea**: 70 kg/acre (provides approximately 32.2 kg N)

**Top-dressing (at first irrigation, around 25-30 days after sowing):**
*   **Urea**: 70 kg/acre (provides approximately 32.2 kg N)

**Nano-Urea and Nano-DAP (Foliar Application):**

Nano-fertilizers are primarily for foliar application and act as supplements to conventional basal fertilizers, or can partially replace a top-dressing.

*   **Nano-Urea**: Apply 2-3 foliar sprays at a concentration of 2-4 ml/L water. The first spray can be given around 30-40 days after sowing, followed by subsequent sprays at 15-20 day intervals, depending on crop vigor.
*   **Nano-DAP**: Apply 1-2 foliar sprays at a concentration of 2-4 ml/L water. This can be done around the tillering or pre-flowering stage to boost phosphorus and nitrogen availability.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Soil Testing:** The most accurate fertilizer recommendations come from a recent soil test report for your specific field. This helps in optimizing nutrient application and preventing over/under-fertilization.
*   **Application Method:** Basal fertilizers should be broadcast evenly and incorporated into the soil before sowing. Urea for top-dressing should be broadcast when the foliage is dry, followed by irrigation.
*   **Water Availability:** Ensure adequate moisture in the soil for efficient nutrient uptake, especially after fertilizer application.
