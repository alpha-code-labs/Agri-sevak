As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following cultivation practices for Oats in Haryana:

**Recommended Cultivation Practices for Oats:**

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   Oats are best sown in rows using a seed drill. This ensures uniform seed distribution, proper depth, and facilitates inter-cultivation operations.
    *   Row sowing is preferred over broadcasting for better crop stand and yield.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   The ideal planting depth for Oats is **3-5 cm**. Deeper sowing can lead to poor germination and emergence, while shallower sowing might expose seeds to birds or moisture stress.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   Maintain a row-to-row spacing of **20-25 cm**. This spacing allows for adequate light penetration, air circulation, and efficient nutrient uptake, contributing to healthy plant growth.

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   The recommended seed dose varies slightly depending on the purpose:
        *   **For Fodder:** A higher seed rate is generally used to achieve a dense stand. Recommend **100-120 kg/acre**.
        *   **For Grain:** A slightly lower seed rate is sufficient for optimal grain production. Recommend **80-100 kg/acre**.
    *   Always use certified seeds of recommended varieties for Haryana.
