As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm the following regarding specialized practices in Oats:

*   **Pruning:** This is not known to affect Oats. Oats are an annual cereal grass, and pruning is not an agronomic practice for this crop.
*   **Desuckering:** This is not known to affect Oats. Oats naturally produce tillers, which contribute significantly to yield. Removing tillers (desuckering) would be detrimental to the crop's productivity.
*   **Mulching:** While the benefits of mulching (soil moisture conservation, weed suppression, temperature regulation) are desirable for oats, "mulching" as a specialized practice involving the application of external materials (like straw or plastic mulch) after sowing is generally not a standard or economically viable practice for large-scale oat cultivation in Haryana. However, **residue management**, where previous crop residues are left on the soil surface, effectively acts as a mulch and is a recommended practice for improving soil health and moisture retention in conservation agriculture systems, which can benefit oats.
*   **Grafting:** This is not known to affect Oats. Grafting is a horticultural technique used for woody or certain herbaceous dicotyledonous plants, not for monocotyledonous cereal grasses like oats.
*   **Pollination:** Oats are primarily self-pollinated (cleistogamous), meaning the flowers are fertilized before they open. They do not require external agents like insects or manual intervention for successful pollination. Therefore, specialized pollination practices are not required for oats.
