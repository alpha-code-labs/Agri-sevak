Oats (Avena sativa) are typically direct-seeded and not transplanted. Transplanting is not a recommended practice for oats due to the risk of root damage, transplant shock, and reduced yield, as well as being labor-intensive and uneconomical for a field crop.

Therefore, the following information pertains to the ideal direct seeding practices for oats in Haryana:

**1. Ideal Sowing Time:**
*   Mid-October to Mid-November is the optimal period for sowing oats in Haryana. Early sowing (mid-October) is generally preferred for better fodder and grain yield.

**2. Ideal Sowing Distance:**
*   **Row-to-row distance:** 20-22.5 cm.
*   **Seed Rate:**
    *   For fodder purpose: 100-120 kg/acre.
    *   For grain purpose: 80-100 kg/acre.

**3. Ideal Sowing Process:**
*   **Land Preparation:**
    *   Prepare a fine, firm, and well-levelled seedbed. This typically involves one deep ploughing followed by 2-3 cross-harrowings or cultivations.
    *   Planking should be done after each cultivation to break clods, conserve moisture, and level the field.
*   **Sowing Method:**
    *   Drill sowing is highly recommended for uniform seed distribution and proper depth. This ensures better germination and stand establishment compared to broadcasting.
*   **Sowing Depth:**
    *   Seeds should be sown at a depth of 3-5 cm.
*   **Fertilizer Application (Basal):**
    *   Apply Phosphorus (P2O5) @ 20-25 kg/acre and Potassium (K2O) @ 10-15 kg/acre (if soil test indicates deficiency) as a basal dose at the time of sowing.
    *   For Nitrogen (N), apply half of the recommended dose (e.g., 20-25 kg/acre for fodder, 30-40 kg/acre for grain) at sowing. The remaining half should be top-dressed after the first irrigation.
*   **Weed Management (Pre-emergence):**
    *   To control broad-leaf and grassy weeds, apply a pre-emergence herbicide within 3 days of sowing.
    *   **Pendimethalin** @ 1.0 kg a.i./acre (equivalent to 3.3 L of 30% EC formulation) mixed in 200-250 L of water per acre.
