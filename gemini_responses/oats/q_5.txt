Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice regarding the conditions you've mentioned for Oats cultivation in Haryana.

Here's the information regarding Scab, Canker, Gummosis, and Lichen in Oats:

### 1. Scab (Fusarium Head Blight) in Oats

Scab, also known as Fusarium Head Blight (FHB), is a significant fungal disease that can affect oats, particularly under warm, humid conditions during flowering. It is caused by *Fusarium* species, primarily *Fusarium graminearum*.

**Symptoms:**
Infected spikelets show premature bleaching, often with a pinkish or orange fungal growth visible on the glumes. Kernels can be shriveled, discolored, and lightweight, leading to reduced yield and grain quality.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available and suitable for Haryana's agro-climatic conditions, choose oat varieties with improved resistance or tolerance to FHB.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting oats or other susceptible small grains (wheat, barley) continuously in the same field. Rotate with non-host crops like pulses, oilseeds, or maize.
    *   **Residue Management:** Plow under or remove infected crop residues after harvest to reduce the primary inoculum source.
    *   **Balanced Fertilization:** Maintain balanced nutrient levels. Avoid excessive nitrogen application, which can sometimes increase susceptibility.
    *   **Timely Sowing:** Sowing at the recommended time can help oats escape peak periods of disease development.

*   **Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
    Fungicides are most effective when applied at the early flowering stage (anthesis) of the oat crop. Always follow the specific instructions on the product label for dosage and application.

    *   **For effective control of Fusarium Head Blight, CIBRC approved fungicides containing the following active ingredients can be used:**
        *   **Tebuconazole** (e.g., 25.9% EC formulation): Apply at a rate of approximately **625 ml/acre** mixed with adequate water for thorough coverage.
        *   **Propiconazole** (e.g., 25% EC formulation): Apply at a rate of approximately **200 ml/acre** mixed with adequate water.

    *   **Application:** Ensure good spray coverage of the heads. A single well-timed application at early flowering is crucial.

### 2. Canker in Oats

This is not known to affect Oats. Canker is typically a disease of woody plants (trees and shrubs) or some herbaceous plants, causing sunken lesions on stems or branches. Oats, being an annual grass, do not typically suffer from "canker" in the agricultural sense.

### 3. Gummosis in Oats

This is not known to affect Oats. Gummosis is the exudation of gum from wounds or cankers, primarily observed in fruit trees (e.g., citrus, stone fruits) and other woody plants. Oats do not produce gum.

### 4. Lichen in Oats

This is not known to affect Oats. Lichens are symbiotic organisms (fungus and alga) that grow on surfaces like rocks, tree bark, or soil. They are not parasitic on plants and do not cause disease or harm to living oat plants. They are not considered a pest or disease of agricultural crops like oats.
