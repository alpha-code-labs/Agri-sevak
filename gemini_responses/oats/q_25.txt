As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified irrigation management practices for Oats (Avena sativa) in Haryana:

Proper irrigation management is crucial for achieving optimal yields and quality in Oats. The timing and amount of irrigation should be carefully managed based on soil type, prevailing weather conditions, and the crop's growth stage.

**1. First Irrigation:**
*   **Timing:** The first irrigation is critical for good germination, establishment, and early tillering. It is generally recommended around **20-25 days after sowing (DAS)**.
*   **Factors to Consider:**
    *   **Soil Type:** Lighter soils (sandy loams) may require irrigation slightly earlier than heavier soils (clay loams).
    *   **Pre-sowing Moisture:** If the field had good pre-sowing moisture or received significant rainfall shortly after sowing, the first irrigation can be delayed slightly.
    *   **Crop Condition:** Ensure uniform germination and early seedling growth before applying water.
*   **Method:** Surface irrigation (flood or furrow) is commonly practiced.
*   **Amount:** Apply a light to moderate irrigation, ensuring the soil is adequately moistened to a depth of 15-20 cm. Avoid excessive water that could lead to waterlogging or crust formation.

**2. Second Irrigation:**
*   **Timing:** The second irrigation is typically applied during the **tillering to jointing stage**, which usually falls around **40-45 DAS**. This stage is vital for the development of tillers and the elongation of the main stem, directly impacting yield potential.
*   **Factors to Consider:**
    *   **Crop Vigor:** Observe the crop for any signs of moisture stress, such as leaf rolling or a dull appearance.
    *   **Weather Conditions:** If there are prolonged dry spells or high temperatures, irrigation may be needed sooner.
*   **Method:** Similar to the first irrigation, surface irrigation is common.
*   **Amount:** A moderate irrigation is usually sufficient to meet the crop's water demands during this active growth phase.

**3. Subsequent Irrigations (if required):**
*   Oats generally require **2-3 irrigations** in total, depending on rainfall, soil type, and the specific variety.
*   If a third irrigation is needed, it is best applied at the **booting to flowering stage** (around 60-70 DAS). This stage is highly sensitive to water stress, which can significantly impact grain filling and fodder quality.
*   Avoid irrigation during the ripening stage to prevent lodging (falling over of plants) and facilitate harvesting.

**4. Sprinkler Use in Oats:**
*   **Suitability:** Sprinkler irrigation systems (e.g., micro-sprinklers, rain guns, or center pivot systems) are highly suitable for Oats cultivation, particularly in regions facing water scarcity or on undulating terrains.
*   **Advantages:**
    *   **Water Use Efficiency:** Sprinklers can significantly reduce water consumption compared to traditional flood irrigation, often saving 25-40% of water.
    *   **Uniform Application:** Ensures even distribution of water across the field, leading to more uniform crop growth and higher yields.
    *   **Reduced Runoff and Leaching:** Minimizes water loss through surface runoff and deep percolation, especially on lighter soils.
    *   **Soil Conservation:** Reduces soil erosion, particularly on sloped lands.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Can be effectively used for fertigation (application of water-soluble fertilizers through the irrigation system).
*   **Recommendations for Sprinkler Use:**
    *   **Scheduling:** Schedule irrigations based on soil moisture depletion and crop water requirements, aligning with the critical growth stages (20-25 DAS, 40-45 DAS, and 60-70 DAS if needed).
    *   **Application Rate:** Use an application rate that matches or is slightly less than the infiltration rate of the soil to prevent surface runoff.
    *   **Pressure and Nozzle Size:** Ensure appropriate operating pressure and nozzle size for uniform coverage and optimal droplet size, minimizing evaporation losses.
    *   **Wind Conditions:** Avoid irrigating during strong winds to prevent uneven water distribution.
    *   **Amount:** Apply water equivalent to the crop's evapotranspiration needs, typically 30-40 mm per irrigation event, adjusted based on soil type and prevailing weather conditions.

**General Irrigation Principles for Oats:**
*   **Critical Stages:** The tillering, jointing, and booting to flowering stages are the most critical for water supply. Water stress during these periods can severely reduce yield.
*   **Avoid Waterlogging:** Oats are sensitive to waterlogging, which can lead to root rot, nutrient deficiencies, and reduced yields. Ensure good field drainage.
*   **Soil Moisture Monitoring:** Regularly monitor soil moisture levels using simple methods (e.g., feel and appearance method) or instruments (e.g., tensiometers) to optimize irrigation scheduling and prevent over or under-irrigation.
