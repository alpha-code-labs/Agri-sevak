As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling soil pests in Oats in Haryana:

It is important to adopt an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods for sustainable pest control. Always consult your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions.

### Control of Termites in Oats

Termites (*Odontotermes obesus*, *Microtermes obesi*) can cause significant damage to oat crops, especially during the seedling stage and in dry conditions, by feeding on roots and hollowing out stems.

**Preventive and Control Measures:**

*   **Field Preparation:** Ensure proper field sanitation by removing stubble and crop residues that can harbor termites. Deep summer ploughing can expose termite colonies to predators and desiccation.
*   **Chemical Control (Soil Application at Sowing):**
    *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: Apply 2.0-2.5 L per acre mixed with 20-30 kg of sand or dry soil and broadcast evenly before the last ploughing, or apply through irrigation water.
    *   **Fipronil** 0.3% GR: Apply 6-8 kg per acre at the time of sowing, incorporating it into the soil.
    *   **Fipronil** 5% SC: Apply 400-600 ml per acre as a drench or mixed with irrigation water at sowing.

### Control of Nematodes (Root-knot) in Oats

Root-knot nematodes (*Meloidogyne* spp.) can affect oats, causing galls or knots on the roots, leading to stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, and reduced yield. While oats are generally considered less susceptible than some other crops, significant infestations can occur in heavily infested fields.

**Preventive and Control Measures:**

*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate oats with non-host crops like marigold, mustard, or specific varieties of pearl millet or sorghum that are known to reduce nematode populations.
*   **Summer Ploughing:** Deep summer ploughing during hot months exposes nematode eggs and larvae to sunlight and desiccation, reducing their populations.
*   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporating well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost can improve soil health and enhance the activity of natural enemies of nematodes.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** If available, choose oat varieties known to have resistance or tolerance to root-knot nematodes.
*   **Chemical Control (Soil Application at Sowing):**
    *   **Carbofuran** 3% CG: Apply 10-13 kg per acre at the time of sowing, incorporating it thoroughly into the soil.
    *   **Carbosulfan** 25% EC: Apply 800-1000 ml per acre as a drench or mixed with irrigation water at sowing.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Soil Testing:** It is highly recommended to get your soil tested for nematode populations to determine the severity of infestation and guide management decisions.
*   **Safety Precautions:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) while handling and applying pesticides. Follow the instructions on the product label strictly regarding dosage, application method, and safety intervals.
*   **Environmental Impact:** Use chemical pesticides judiciously to minimize their impact on beneficial organisms and the environment.
