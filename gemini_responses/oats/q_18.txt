As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified recommendations for the use of growth regulators and micronutrients in Oats in Haryana:

It is crucial to understand the specific purpose and timing for each application to achieve the desired effect and avoid adverse impacts on the crop.

### 1. **Ethephon** (Growth Regulator for Lodging Control)

*   **Purpose:** **Ethephon** is a plant growth regulator used to reduce plant height and strengthen the straw, thereby preventing lodging (falling over) in Oats, especially under high fertility conditions or in varieties prone to lodging.
*   **Technical Name:** **Ethephon**
*   **Recommended Dose:** Apply **Ethephon** at 500-750 g active ingredient (a.i.) per hectare.
    *   This typically translates to 1.0-1.5 litres of a 39% SL (Soluble Liquid) formulation or 0.75-1.25 litres of a 48% SL formulation per hectare.
    *   Mix the recommended quantity in 500-600 litres of water for thorough coverage.
*   **Timing:** Apply at the tillering to early jointing stage (when the first node is visible but before the flag leaf emerges). Avoid application during stress conditions (drought, waterlogging, extreme temperatures).

### 2. **2,4-D** (Herbicide, not a standard Growth Regulator for Oats)

*   **Purpose:** While **2,4-D** is an auxin-type plant hormone, its primary and recommended use in Oats in Haryana is as a selective post-emergence herbicide for the control of broadleaf weeds. It is *not* typically used as a growth regulator for yield enhancement or other specific growth modifications in Oats under standard agricultural practices. Applying it at growth regulator doses is not a common or recommended practice for Oats.
*   **Technical Name:** **2,4-D sodium salt** (most common formulation for cereals) or **2,4-D ethyl ester**.
*   **Recommended Dose (as Herbicide):**
    *   For **2,4-D sodium salt 80% WP**: Apply 500-750 g of product per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water.
    *   For **2,4-D ethyl ester 38% EC**: Apply 500-750 ml of product per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water.
*   **Timing:** Apply when Oats are at the 3-4 leaf stage (typically 30-40 days after sowing) and broadleaf weeds are young (2-4 leaf stage). Ensure the crop is not under any stress (e.g., drought, nutrient deficiency) at the time of application.

### 3. **Boron** (Essential Micronutrient)

*   **Purpose:** Boron is an essential micronutrient vital for cell wall formation, sugar transport, pollen viability, and seed development. Its application corrects boron deficiency, which can lead to poor grain filling, sterility, and reduced yield. It is not classified as a growth regulator in the same way as **Ethephon**, but rather as a critical nutrient.
*   **Technical Name:** **Borax (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate)** or **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate**.
*   **Recommended Dose:**
    *   **Foliar Application (for correcting mild to moderate deficiency):**
        *   Spray a 0.1-0.2% solution of **Borax** (1-2 g per litre of water).
        *   Alternatively, spray a 0.05-0.1% solution of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (0.5-1 g per litre of water).
        *   Ensure complete coverage of the foliage.
    *   **Timing:** Apply at the tillering stage or pre-flowering stage, or upon the appearance of deficiency symptoms. A second application may be given after 15-20 days if symptoms persist or deficiency is severe.
    *   **Soil Application (for severe deficiency, based on soil test):**
        *   Apply 1-2 kg of **Borax** per acre, mixed with basal fertilizers at the time of sowing. This should only be done after a confirmed soil test indicating severe deficiency, as excessive boron can be toxic.

Always conduct a soil test to determine nutrient status before applying micronutrients like Boron. For any chemical application, strictly follow the instructions and safety precautions provided on the product label.
