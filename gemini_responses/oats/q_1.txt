As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling smut diseases in Oats in Haryana:

First, let's clarify the specific smut diseases known to affect Oats:

*   **Black Smut:** This is not known to affect Oats as a distinct disease. Oat smuts are primarily Loose Smut and Covered Smut.
*   **False Smut:** This is not known to affect Oats. False smut is primarily a disease of rice.

Now, let's address the control of Loose Smut and Kernel Smut (also known as Covered Smut) in Oats, as these are the primary smut diseases affecting this crop.

**Control of Loose Smut (Ustilago avenae) and Kernel Smut / Covered Smut (Ustilago hordei) in Oats:**

These two smuts are primarily seed-borne diseases, and their effective control relies heavily on preventive measures, especially seed treatment.

**1. Cultural Practices:**

*   **Use Certified Disease-Free Seed:** Always source seeds from reputable suppliers to ensure they are free from smut spores.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available and suitable for Haryana conditions, choose oat varieties known to have resistance against common smut races. Consult HAU recommendations for specific varieties.
*   **Crop Rotation:** While smuts are primarily seed-borne, practicing crop rotation with non-host crops can help reduce any potential inoculum build-up in the soil, though this is less critical than seed treatment for these diseases.

**2. Chemical Control (Seed Treatment):**

Seed treatment is the most effective and recommended method for controlling Loose Smut and Kernel Smut in Oats. Ensure thorough and uniform coating of the seeds with the fungicide.

The following CIBRC approved technical chemicals are effective for seed treatment against smuts in Oats:

*   **Carboxin:**
    *   **Carboxin 37.5% FS (Flowable Concentrate for Seed Treatment):** Apply at 2-3 ml per kg of seed.
    *   **Carboxin 75% WP (Wettable Powder):** Apply at 1.25 g per kg of seed.
*   **Tebuconazole:**
    *   **Tebuconazole 2% DS (Dry Seed Treatment):** Apply at 1-1.25 g per kg of seed.
    *   **Tebuconazole 60 FS (Flowable Concentrate for Seed Treatment):** Apply at 1-1.25 ml per kg of seed.
*   **Difenoconazole:**
    *   **Difenoconazole 3% FS:** Apply at 3-5 ml per kg of seed. (Often found in combination products).

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions on the product label.
*   Ensure proper mixing and application of the fungicide for uniform coverage of seeds.
*   Treat seeds just before sowing for best results.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (gloves, mask) during seed treatment.

By implementing these measures, particularly effective seed treatment, oat growers in Haryana can significantly reduce the incidence and impact of smut diseases.
