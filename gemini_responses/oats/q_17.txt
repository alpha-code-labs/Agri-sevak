As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following doses for organic manures and bio-stimulants for Oats in Haryana, based on scientific verification:

1.  **Farmyard Manure (FYM):**
    *   Apply **10-15 tonnes per acre** of well-decomposed FYM.
    *   It should be uniformly spread and thoroughly incorporated into the soil 2-3 weeks before sowing the Oats crop. This allows for proper decomposition and nutrient release.

2.  **Vermicompost:**
    *   Apply **2-3 tonnes per acre** of vermicompost.
    *   Similar to FYM, it should be incorporated into the soil before sowing. Vermicompost is richer in nutrients than FYM and improves soil structure and microbial activity.

3.  **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract-based Bio-stimulant):**
    *   Sagarika is a bio-stimulant derived from seaweed extract (primarily *Ascophyllum nodosum*), not a primary manure. It enhances nutrient uptake, promotes root development, and improves overall plant vigour.
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Mix **2-3 ml per litre** of water.
        *   Apply as a foliar spray at critical growth stages, typically two sprays are recommended:
            *   First spray: At the tillering stage (around 25-30 days after sowing).
            *   Second spray: At the booting/panicle initiation stage (around 50-60 days after sowing).
    *   **Soil Application (if preferred):**
        *   A dose of **500 ml to 1 litre per acre** can be applied by mixing it with irrigation water or along with other fertilizers. This is less common than foliar application for bio-stimulants but can be done.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Soil Testing:** Always conduct a soil test to determine the existing nutrient status of your field. This will help in fine-tuning the exact doses of organic manures and chemical fertilizers required.
*   **Integration:** Organic manures should be integrated with recommended doses of chemical fertilizers (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium) for optimal yield and soil health.
*   **Quality of Manure:** Ensure that FYM is well-decomposed and free from weed seeds and pathogens. Fresh FYM can be detrimental to crop growth.
