As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Oats in Haryana:

1.  **Grasshopper (Acrididae)**
    Grasshoppers are polyphagous pests that can cause significant damage to young oat crops by feeding on leaves and tender shoots.

    **Control Measures:**
    *   **Cultural Practices:** Deep ploughing after harvest can expose grasshopper eggs to predators and adverse weather conditions, reducing subsequent populations. Field sanitation and removal of weeds also help.
    *   **Chemical Control:** In case of severe infestation, especially during the early stages of crop growth, the following CIBRC approved insecticides can be used:
        *   **Malathion 50% EC**: Apply 1.0 - 1.25 L per acre mixed in 250-300 L of water.
        *   **Quinalphos 25% EC**: Apply 1.0 L per acre mixed in 250-300 L of water.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC**: Apply 100-125 ml per acre mixed in 200-300 L of water.
        *   **Fipronil 5% SC**: Apply 400-600 ml per acre mixed in 200-300 L of water.

2.  **Painted bug (Bagrada hilaris / Bagrada cruciferarum)**
    This is not known to affect Oats. The painted bug is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops like mustard, cabbage, and radish.

3.  **Red cotton bug (Dysdercus koenigii)**
    This is not known to affect Oats. The red cotton bug is a major pest of cotton and other malvaceous plants.

4.  **Black ants (Formicidae)**
    This is not known to affect Oats as a direct pest causing economic damage to the crop itself. Ants are generally not considered primary pests of healthy standing oat crops. They might be present in the field, often associated with other sap-sucking insects (like aphids) for their honeydew, or nesting in the soil. Direct insecticidal control specifically for black ants in oats is not typically recommended or necessary.
