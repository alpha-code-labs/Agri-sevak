As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide scientifically verified advice for controlling various rot types in Oats, specifically for the conditions prevalent in Haryana.

It is important to understand that many of the "rot" types you've listed (Root, Stem, Foot, Collar, Crown, Neck, Seed, and Seedling rot) are often caused by a complex of soil-borne and seed-borne fungal pathogens (e.g., *Fusarium* spp., *Pythium* spp., *Rhizoctonia solani*, *Bipolaris sorokiniana*, *Gaeumannomyces graminis var. avenae*). These pathogens can cause similar symptoms at different stages of plant growth, leading to damping-off, poor stand establishment, stunted growth, and premature death.

However, some specific rot types mentioned are not typically associated with Oats:

*   **Fruit Rot:** This is not known to affect Oats. Oats produce grains, not botanical fruits that are susceptible to "fruit rot" diseases.
*   **Black Rot:** This is not known to affect Oats as a primary, distinct disease under this specific name. While some fungi can cause dark lesions, "Black Rot" is typically associated with bacterial diseases in crucifers (*Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris*).

For the control of Root, Stem, Foot, Collar, Crown, Neck, Seed, and Seedling rots in Oats, an integrated disease management (IDM) approach is crucial, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods.

### Integrated Disease Management Strategies for Rots in Oats:

**1. Cultural Practices:**

*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice rotation with non-host crops (e.g., legumes) for at least 2-3 years to reduce pathogen inoculum in the soil.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available, select oat varieties known to have resistance or tolerance to common root and crown rot pathogens. Consult HAU for recommended varieties for Haryana.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure balanced fertilization. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can make plants more susceptible. Adequate phosphorus and potassium can improve plant vigor and resistance.
*   **Proper Drainage:** Ensure good field drainage to prevent waterlogging, which favors many root rot pathogens, especially *Pythium* species.
*   **Timely Sowing:** Sow oats at the optimal time for your region in Haryana. This ensures vigorous seedling growth, making them less susceptible to seedling diseases.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected crop residues after harvest to reduce the carry-over of pathogens.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** Deep ploughing can help bury crop residues and expose pathogens to sunlight, reducing their survival.
*   **Certified Seed:** Always use certified, disease-free seed from a reputable source.

**2. Biological Control:**

*   **Bio-fungicide Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds with biological agents like *Trichoderma viride* or *Pseudomonas fluorescens*.
    *   **Trichoderma viride** 1% WP: Apply @ 4-5 g/kg seed.
    *   **Pseudomonas fluorescens** 1% WP: Apply @ 10 g/kg seed.
    These bio-agents colonize the root zone, suppressing pathogenic fungi and promoting plant growth.

**3. Chemical Control (Primarily Seed Treatment):**

Seed treatment is the most effective chemical measure for preventing seed, seedling, root, crown, and foot rots.

*   **Combination Fungicides:**
    *   **Carbendazim** 12% + **Mancozeb** 63% WP: Apply @ 2-2.5 g/kg seed. This provides broad-spectrum protection against various fungal pathogens.
*   **Systemic Fungicides:**
    *   **Tebuconazole** 2% DS: Apply @ 1-1.5 g/kg seed. Effective against *Fusarium* and other seed-borne pathogens.
    *   **Metalaxyl** 35% WS: Apply @ 1-1.5 g/kg seed. Highly effective against oomycete pathogens like *Pythium* spp., which cause damping-off and root rot.
*   **Contact Fungicides:**
    *   **Thiram** 75% WS: Apply @ 2.5-3 g/kg seed. Provides good protection against a range of seed and soil-borne fungi.
*   **Advanced Combination Fungicides:**
    *   **Fluxapyroxad** 6.25% + **Pyraclostrobin** 6.25% FS: Apply @ 1-1.5 ml/kg seed. This combination offers broad-spectrum, systemic protection and can enhance seedling vigor.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions when handling and applying chemicals.
*   Ensure thorough mixing of the fungicide with the seed for uniform coverage.
*   For specific disease outbreaks or persistent problems, consult with HAU experts for precise diagnosis and tailored recommendations.
