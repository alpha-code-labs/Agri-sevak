As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Oats in Haryana:

1.  **Diamondback Moth:**
    *   This is not known to affect Oats. Diamondback moth (*Plutella xylostella*) is a specific pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., mustard, cabbage, cauliflower, radish) and does not infest Oats, which belong to the grass family (Poaceae).

2.  **Borers, Caterpillars, and Leaf folder:**
    These pests, primarily belonging to the order Lepidoptera, can occasionally affect Oats, particularly during early growth stages or under specific environmental conditions. Control measures should be initiated upon reaching economic threshold levels.

    **General Control Measures for Lepidopteran Pests (Borers, Caterpillars, Leaf folder) in Oats:**

    *   **Cultural Practices:**
        *   Timely sowing and maintaining optimal plant density can help reduce pest incidence.
        *   Field sanitation and removal of crop residues can minimize overwintering sites for some pests.
        *   Monitoring fields regularly for early signs of pest infestation is crucial.

    *   **Chemical Control (upon reaching economic threshold):**
        For effective control of these lepidopteran pests, the following CIBRC approved insecticides can be used. Always ensure thorough coverage of the foliage and stem, especially targeting the affected parts.

        *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** Apply at 60 ml per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water.
        *   **Emamectin Benzoate 5% SG:** Apply at 88-100 g per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** Apply at 100-125 ml per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water.
        *   **Quinalphos 25% EC:** Apply at 500-600 ml per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water. (Effective against borers and general caterpillars).

    *   **Important Considerations:**
        *   Always read and strictly follow the label instructions for specific dosage, safety precautions, and pre-harvest intervals.
        *   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pest resistance.
        *   Consult with local agricultural extension services for the most current recommendations specific to your region and crop stage.
