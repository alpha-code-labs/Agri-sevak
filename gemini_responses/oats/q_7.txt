As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I must provide accurate and scientifically verified information specific to Oats cultivation in Haryana.

Regarding your query:

*   **Dieback:** This is not known to affect Oats. Dieback is primarily a condition observed in woody plants (trees and shrubs), often due to environmental stress, nutrient deficiencies, or specific pathogens affecting branches and twigs. Oats are an annual cereal crop and do not exhibit dieback in the typical sense.
*   **Twig blight:** This is not known to affect Oats. Twig blight is a disease that affects the twigs of woody plants (trees and shrubs), causing them to wither and die. Oats are a herbaceous cereal crop and do not have twigs.
*   **Tikka disease:** This is not known to affect Oats. Tikka disease is a well-known and significant foliar disease specifically affecting Groundnut (Peanut), caused by *Cercospora arachidicola* and *Phaeoisariopsis personata*. It does not affect Oats.

If you are observing symptoms like yellowing, wilting, or drying of leaves/stems in your Oats crop, it is likely due to other common diseases or physiological issues specific to Oats, such as rusts, smuts, powdery mildew, or nutrient deficiencies, water stress, or pest infestations. For accurate diagnosis and control recommendations, please provide more specific details about the symptoms you are observing in your Oats field.
