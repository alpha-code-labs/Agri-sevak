As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies in Oats in Haryana.

It is important to correctly identify the specific pest causing damage, as control measures can vary. Always consult your local agricultural extension office for the most current and specific recommendations for your region and situation.

### Control of Beetles in Oats

Several beetle species can affect oats, primarily the Cereal Leaf Beetle and Wireworms (larvae of click beetles). Flea beetles can also cause damage to young seedlings.

**1. Cereal Leaf Beetle (Oulema melanopus) and Flea Beetles:**
These beetles feed on the leaves, causing characteristic striping or shot-hole damage.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Timely sowing can help oats escape peak beetle activity.
    *   Maintain good field sanitation.
*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray, if infestation is severe and crosses economic threshold):**
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC @ 100-125 ml/acre (or 0.5 ml/L of water).
    *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC @ 500 ml/acre (or 2.5 ml/L of water).
    *   **Quinalphos** 25% EC @ 600 ml/acre (or 3.0 ml/L of water).

**2. Wireworms (larvae of Click Beetles):**
Wireworms are soil-dwelling pests that feed on germinating seeds and young roots, leading to poor stand establishment. They are more problematic in fields previously under grass or with high organic matter.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Crop rotation with non-host crops.
    *   Good seedbed preparation.
*   **Chemical Control (Seed Treatment, if wireworm history is known):**
    *   **Imidacloprid** 70% WS @ 7-10 g/kg seed.
    *   **Thiamethoxam** 70% WS @ 7-10 g/kg seed.

### Control of Weevils in Oats

Field weevils are generally **not** considered a major, widespread pest of oats in Haryana that requires specific chemical control measures. While some weevil species might occasionally be present, they rarely cause economic damage in the field. Stored grain weevils (e.g., *Sitophilus* spp.) are a significant pest of harvested oats in storage, but this question pertains to field control.

### Control of Sawflies in Oats

The Cereal Stem Sawfly (*Cephus pygmaeus*) can affect oats, although it is more commonly a pest of wheat and barley. The larvae bore into the stems, causing lodging and potential yield loss.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Use of resistant varieties (if available for oats, typically solid-stemmed varieties are resistant, but less common in oats than wheat).
    *   Early harvesting can reduce the number of larvae completing their development.
    *   Deep ploughing after harvest can bury stubble and reduce overwintering populations.
*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray, if adult sawfly activity is high during egg-laying or early larval stage):**
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC @ 100-125 ml/acre (or 0.5 ml/L of water).
    *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC @ 500 ml/acre (or 2.5 ml/L of water).
    *   **Malathion** 50% EC @ 1.0-1.25 L/acre (or 2.0-2.5 ml/L of water) for adult control.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the label instructions for any pesticide product.
*   Ensure proper safety equipment is used during application.
*   Consider the economic threshold before applying insecticides to avoid unnecessary chemical use.
*   Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approaches, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods, are always recommended for sustainable pest control.
