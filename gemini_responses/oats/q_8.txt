As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing sucking pests in Oats in Haryana.

First, let's address the specific pests mentioned:

*   **Psylla:** This is not known to affect Oats.

For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips, an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is recommended, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods.

### Integrated Pest Management for Sucking Pests (Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, Thrips) in Oats

**1. Cultural Control Measures:**
*   **Timely Sowing:** Sow oats at the recommended time for your region to avoid peak pest populations.
*   **Balanced Fertilization:** Avoid excessive nitrogen application, as it can lead to lush growth that attracts sucking pests. Use recommended doses of NPK.
*   **Weed Management:** Keep the field free of weeds, as many weeds can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation to break the pest cycle.

**2. Biological Control Measures:**
*   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Protect and encourage natural predators and parasitoids such as ladybird beetles, lacewings, hoverfly larvae, and parasitic wasps (e.g., *Aphidius* species for aphids). Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.
*   **Bird Perches:** Install bird perches in the field to encourage insectivorous birds.

**3. Chemical Control Measures (Apply only if pest population exceeds Economic Threshold Level):**
Before applying any chemical, always scout your field to assess the pest population. Consult your local agricultural extension worker for specific economic threshold levels for oats in your area.

When chemical intervention is necessary, use CIBRC approved insecticides at recommended dosages:

*   **For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips:**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** 125 ml per acre (in 200-300 litres of water).
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** 50 g per acre (in 200-300 litres of water).
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** 80-100 g per acre (in 200-300 litres of water).

*   **Specifically for Thrips and Leafhoppers:**
    *   **Fipronil 5% SC:** 400-600 ml per acre (in 200-300 litres of water).

*   **Specifically for Aphids and Leafhoppers:**
    *   **Dimethoate 30% EC:** 330-400 ml per acre (in 200-300 litres of water).

*   **Specifically for Whitefly Nymphs:**
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** 500-600 ml per acre (in 200-300 litres of water).

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Spray Volume:** Ensure adequate spray volume (200-300 litres of water per acre) for thorough coverage of the crop canopy.
*   **Rotation of Chemicals:** To prevent the development of insecticide resistance, rotate insecticides with different modes of action.
*   **Safety Precautions:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) while handling and spraying pesticides. Follow label instructions carefully.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Be mindful of the pre-harvest interval for any insecticide used, especially if the oats are intended for fodder.

For precise recommendations tailored to your specific field conditions and current pest pressure, it is always advisable to consult with the agricultural extension specialists at HAU or your local Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK).
