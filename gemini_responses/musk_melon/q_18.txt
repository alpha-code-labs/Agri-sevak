As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), here are the scientifically verified recommendations for the use of growth regulators and Boron in Musk Melon in Haryana:

**1. Ethephon**
*   **Purpose:** To increase the number of female flowers, leading to higher fruit set and yield. It also promotes early maturity.
*   **Recommended Dose:**
    *   **Ethephon** (39% SL formulation): 0.25 - 0.5 ml/L of water (equivalent to 100-200 ppm).
*   **Application Timing:** Apply at the 2-4 true leaf stage. A second spray can be given one week later if needed. Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.

**2. 2,4-D**
*   **Recommendation:** The use of **2,4-D** as a growth regulator for Musk Melon is generally not recommended due to its narrow safety margin and high risk of phytotoxicity even at very low concentrations. Safer and more effective alternatives (such as Naphthalene Acetic Acid - NAA, for fruit set) are preferred if an auxin is required.

**3. Boron**
*   **Purpose:** Boron is an essential micronutrient crucial for pollen germination, pollen tube growth, fruit set, and overall fruit development. Its deficiency can lead to poor fruit set and malformed fruits.
*   **Recommended Dose:**
    *   **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate, 11% Boron): 1 - 2 g/L of water.
*   **Application Timing:** Apply as a foliar spray at the pre-flowering stage and/or at early fruit set. Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.
