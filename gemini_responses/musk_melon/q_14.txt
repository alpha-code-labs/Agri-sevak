As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling soil pests like termites and root-knot nematodes in Musk Melon cultivation in Haryana. An Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods, is crucial for sustainable and effective control.

### Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Principles for Soil Pests

Before resorting to chemical control, consider these foundational practices:

*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove crop residues and weeds that can harbor pests.
*   **Deep Summer Ploughing:** Exposing soil to scorching summer sun helps kill eggs, larvae, pupae, and even adult stages of many soil pests, including nematodes and termites.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid continuous cultivation of susceptible crops. Rotate with non-host crops (e.g., cereals like maize, sorghum, or marigold for nematodes) to break the pest life cycle.
*   **Use of Resistant Varieties:** If available and suitable for your region, choose musk melon varieties known to have resistance or tolerance to nematodes.
*   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost, which improves soil health and can enhance the activity of beneficial microorganisms that suppress pests.

### Control of Termites

Termites (Odontotermes obesus, Microtermes obesi) can cause significant damage by feeding on roots and stems, leading to wilting and plant death.

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   Ensure proper irrigation to maintain soil moisture, as termites prefer dry conditions.
*   Remove dead wood and stubble from the field that can serve as food sources.

**2. Chemical Control (Pre-planting/At Planting):**
For effective control, soil treatment before or at the time of planting is recommended.

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC**: Apply 2.0-2.5 L per acre, mixed with 200-400 L of water, and drench the soil thoroughly before planting or incorporate into the soil during the last ploughing.
    *   **Fipronil 0.3% GR**: Apply 6.6-10 kg per acre, broadcast evenly and incorporate into the soil during the last ploughing before planting.

### Control of Nematodes (Root-knot Nematodes - Meloidogyne spp.)

Root-knot nematodes are microscopic worms that infect roots, causing galls or knots, leading to stunted growth, nutrient deficiency, and reduced yield.

**1. Cultural Control:**
*   **Solarization:** Cover moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks during hot summer months to raise soil temperature and kill nematodes.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate musk melon with non-host crops like maize, sorghum, wheat, or marigold (Tagetes erecta) which has nematicidal properties.
*   **Neem Cake Application:** Incorporate **Neem cake** at 200-400 kg per acre into the soil 2-3 weeks before planting. Neem cake releases compounds that are toxic to nematodes and also enhances beneficial microbial activity.

**2. Biological Control:**
*   **Purpureocillium lilacinum (formerly Paecilomyces lilacinus)**: Apply 2.5 kg per acre, mixed with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost. Apply this mixture to the soil 7-10 days before planting or at the time of planting. This fungus parasitizes nematode eggs and females.

**3. Chemical Control (Pre-planting/At Planting):**
*   **Soil Application:**
    *   **Fluensulfone 2% GR**: Apply 10 kg per acre, broadcast evenly and incorporate into the soil during the last ploughing before planting or at the time of transplanting. This is a modern nematicide effective against root-knot nematodes.

### General Precautions:

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully, including dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, and protective clothing while handling and applying chemicals.
*   Avoid applying chemicals during windy conditions to prevent drift.
*   Keep chemicals out of reach of children and livestock.
*   Dispose of empty containers safely as per local regulations.
*   Consult your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and the latest CIBRC guidelines.
