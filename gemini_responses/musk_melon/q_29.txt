Dropping of flowers and fruits in Musk Melon (often referred to as Tinda/Boll dropping in other contexts, but for Musk Melon, it's flower and fruit drop) is a common physiological issue rather than a specific disease or pest. It is primarily caused by various environmental stresses, nutritional deficiencies, and hormonal imbalances. Addressing these underlying factors is key to control.

Here's how to control flower and fruit drop in Musk Melon:

**I. Understanding the Causes:**

1.  **Environmental Stress:**
    *   **Temperature Extremes:** High temperatures (above 35-40°C) or low temperatures (below 15°C) can lead to poor pollen viability, reduced fertilization, and increased abscission.
    *   **Water Stress:** Both insufficient (drought) and excessive (waterlogging) moisture can stress the plant, leading to flower and fruit drop.
    *   **Humidity:** Very low humidity can cause desiccation of pollen, while very high humidity can hinder pollen dispersal.
    *   **Strong Winds:** Can physically damage flowers and young fruits, or increase transpiration stress.
2.  **Nutritional Imbalances:**
    *   **Boron Deficiency:** Critical for pollen germination, pollen tube growth, and fruit set.
    *   **Calcium Deficiency:** Important for cell wall integrity and fruit development.
    *   **Nitrogen Excess:** Can promote excessive vegetative growth at the expense of reproductive growth, leading to flower drop.
    *   **Potassium Deficiency:** Affects overall plant vigor and fruit development.
3.  **Poor Pollination:**
    *   Lack of pollinators (bees) or their reduced activity due to adverse weather.
    *   Unviable pollen due to stress.
    *   Predominance of male flowers early in the season.
4.  **Hormonal Imbalance:** Stress conditions can trigger the production of abscisic acid and ethylene, which promote shedding.
5.  **Plant Vigor:** Over-bearing (the plant naturally sheds excess fruits to manage its load) or weak plants due to pest/disease attack.

**II. Control Measures:**

**A. Agronomic and Cultural Practices:**

1.  **Optimal Irrigation:** Maintain consistent soil moisture. Avoid both waterlogging and drought stress, especially during flowering and fruit development stages. Use drip irrigation for efficient water management.
2.  **Balanced Nutrition:**
    *   Apply recommended doses of NPK fertilizers based on soil test reports.
    *   Avoid excessive nitrogen application, which can promote vegetative growth over reproductive growth.
3.  **Enhance Pollination:**
    *   Encourage bee activity by avoiding insecticide sprays during peak flowering hours.
    *   Consider placing bee hives near the field, especially in large cultivations.
    *   For small plots, manual pollination can be done in the morning hours.
4.  **Temperature Management:**
    *   Use mulching (straw or plastic mulch) to regulate soil temperature and conserve moisture.
    *   In extreme heat, temporary shade nets can be considered for high-value crops, though less common for open-field musk melon.
5.  **Weed Management:** Keep the field free of weeds to reduce competition for nutrients and water.

**B. Nutritional Interventions (Foliar Sprays):**

Foliar application of specific micronutrients can quickly address deficiencies and support fruit set.

1.  **Boron:**
    *   Spray **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (e.g., Solubor) at 1-1.5 g/L of water, or **Boric Acid** at 1 g/L of water, at the pre-flowering and early fruit set stages.
2.  **Calcium:**
    *   Spray **Calcium Nitrate** at 5 g/L of water, or **Calcium Chloride** at 2-3 g/L of water, during flowering and fruit development.
3.  **Multi-micronutrient Mixtures:**
    *   Apply CIBRC-approved multi-micronutrient formulations containing Boron, Zinc, Manganese, Iron, etc., as per manufacturer's recommendations (typically 2-3 ml/L or 2-3 g/L) during flowering and fruit set.

**C. Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs):**

PGRs can help in fruit retention by balancing hormonal levels.

1.  **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA):**
    *   Spray **Naphthalene Acetic Acid** at a very low concentration of 5-10 ppm (parts per million) (e.g., 0.5-1 ml of 4.5% SL formulation per 10 liters of water) at the early flowering and fruit set stages.
    *   **Caution:** Higher concentrations can be phytotoxic or cause adverse effects. Always follow manufacturer's instructions and recommended dosages precisely.

**D. Pest and Disease Management:**

*   While not a direct cause, severe infestations of pests (e.g., mites, thrips, aphids) or diseases (e.g., powdery mildew, downy mildew, viral diseases) can weaken the plant, leading to stress and subsequent flower/fruit drop.
*   Implement integrated pest and disease management strategies to keep plants healthy and vigorous.

By adopting these integrated measures, farmers can significantly reduce flower and fruit drop in Musk Melon and ensure a better yield.
