Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the critical role micronutrients play in the healthy growth and yield of Musk Melon. Addressing these deficiencies scientifically is key to successful cultivation.

**Crucial First Step: Soil Testing**
Before applying any micronutrients, it is highly recommended to conduct a soil test. This will accurately identify which specific micronutrients are deficient in your field and to what extent, allowing for precise and efficient application. Blind application can lead to imbalances or even toxicity.

Here's how to address common micronutrient deficiencies in Musk Melon:

### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, small leaves (little leaf), interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, often with a bronzing effect.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application (Pre-sowing/Basal):**
        *   Apply **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** at 20-25 kg/acre.
        *   Alternatively, apply **Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate** at 10-12 kg/acre.
        *   Mix thoroughly with the soil before sowing or transplanting.
    *   **Foliar Application (When symptoms appear):**
        *   Spray a solution of **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** at 5 g/L (0.5%) along with 2.5 g/L (0.25%) of slaked lime to neutralize acidity.
        *   Alternatively, use **Zinc EDTA** at 1 g/L (0.1%).
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, ensuring good coverage of the foliage.

### 2. Iron (Fe) / Ferrous Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Prominent interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on the youngest leaves, with veins remaining green. In severe cases, leaves may turn almost white.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application (Most effective for quick correction, especially in alkaline soils):**
        *   Spray a solution of **Ferrous Sulphate** at 5-10 g/L (0.5-1%) along with 1 g/L (0.1%) of citric acid to enhance absorption.
        *   Alternatively, use **Ferrous EDTA** at 1 g/L (0.1%).
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 7-10 day intervals until symptoms disappear.

### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, thickening and brittleness of young leaves, cracking of fruits, poor fruit set, and sometimes hollow stems.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application (Pre-sowing/Basal):**
        *   Apply **Borax (Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate)** at 4-6 kg/acre.
        *   *Caution:* Boron can be toxic if over-applied; ensure accurate dosage based on soil test.
    *   **Foliar Application (Before flowering and fruit set):**
        *   Spray a solution of **Borax (Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate)** at 1-2 g/L (0.1-0.2%).
        *   Alternatively, use **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** at 1 g/L (0.1%).
        *   Apply 1-2 sprays, particularly before flowering and during early fruit development.

### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Necrosis (death) of young leaves and growing points, stunted root growth, and sometimes blossom end rot in fruits (though less common in Musk Melon than in crops like tomato).
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application (During fruit development):**
        *   Spray a solution of **Calcium Nitrate** at 5-10 g/L (0.5-1%).
        *   Alternatively, use **Calcium Chloride** at 5 g/L (0.5%).
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays during the fruit development stage, especially if symptoms are observed or anticipated. Ensure adequate soil moisture for better calcium uptake.

### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, starting from the leaf margins and progressing inwards, often with a reddish or purplish tint.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application (Basal):**
        *   Apply **Magnesium Sulphate** at 10-20 kg/acre.
    *   **Foliar Application (When symptoms appear):**
        *   Spray a solution of **Magnesium Sulphate** at 5-10 g/L (0.5-1%).
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals.

### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, similar to iron deficiency but often with a finer network of green veins, sometimes accompanied by small necrotic spots.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application (Basal, if severe deficiency confirmed by soil test):**
        *   Apply **Manganese Sulphate** at 10-15 kg/acre.
    *   **Foliar Application (When symptoms appear):**
        *   Spray a solution of **Manganese Sulphate** at 5 g/L (0.5%).
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals.

**General Recommendations:**

*   **Timing:** Foliar sprays are most effective when applied in the morning or late afternoon to avoid rapid drying and maximize absorption.
*   **Adjuvants:** Consider adding a non-ionic spreader/sticker to foliar sprays to improve coverage and absorption.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management:** Combine these specific micronutrient applications with balanced NPK fertilization and regular addition of organic matter (farmyard manure, compost) to improve overall soil health and nutrient availability.
*   **Water Quality:** Ensure the water used for spraying is of good quality and free from contaminants that might affect chemical efficacy.

By following these scientifically verified recommendations, you can effectively manage micronutrient deficiencies in your Musk Melon crop and ensure a healthy, productive harvest. For any specific concerns, always consult with your local agricultural extension officer.
