Wilt, including Parawilt, is a significant challenge for Musk Melon cultivation in Haryana, primarily caused by *Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. melonis*. Effective control requires an integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods.

Here's how to control Wilt in Musk Melon:

*   **Resistant Varieties:**
    *   The most effective long-term solution is to select and plant Musk Melon varieties known to be resistant or tolerant to Fusarium wilt. Consult with HAU or local agricultural extension for recommended varieties suitable for Haryana's conditions.

*   **Cultural and Agronomic Practices:**
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting Musk Melon or other cucurbits in the same field for at least 3-4 years. Rotate with non-host crops like cereals (wheat, maize) or legumes.
    *   **Soil Solarization:** During the hot summer months (May-June), cover the prepared field with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks. This raises soil temperature, effectively killing soil-borne pathogens like *Fusarium*.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Promptly remove and destroy infected plants and plant debris to prevent the spread of inoculum.
    *   **Proper Irrigation:** Avoid over-irrigation and waterlogging, as excessive moisture can favor disease development and stress roots. Drip irrigation is recommended for efficient water use and reduced soil moisture fluctuations.
    *   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure balanced fertilization. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can make plants more susceptible. Potassium and phosphorus are crucial for plant vigor and disease resistance.
    *   **Soil Health:** Improve soil drainage and structure by incorporating organic matter (farmyard manure, compost). Healthy soil promotes strong root development, making plants more resilient.
    *   **Avoid Root Injury:** Be careful during intercultural operations to avoid damaging plant roots, as wounds can serve as entry points for pathogens.

*   **Biological Control:**
    *   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds with bio-fungicides before sowing.
        *   **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum**: Apply at 5-10 g/kg seed.
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum**: Mix 2.5 kg of the formulation with 50-100 kg of farmyard manure or compost and apply uniformly to one acre of soil before planting or at the time of planting.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Seed Treatment:**
        *   **Carbendazim**: Treat seeds at 2 g/kg seed.
        *   **Thiophanate Methyl**: Treat seeds at 2 g/kg seed.
    *   **Soil Drench/Drip Application:**
        *   At the first sign of wilting or as a prophylactic measure in disease-prone areas, drench the soil around the plant base with fungicides.
        *   **Carbendazim**: Apply at 1-2 g/L of water. Use 200-500 ml solution per plant, depending on plant size.
        *   **Thiophanate Methyl**: Apply at 1-1.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Carbendazim 12% + Mancozeb 63% WP (combination product)**: Apply at 2-3 g/L of water.
        *   Ensure thorough wetting of the root zone. Repeat application if necessary, following label instructions and maintaining the recommended interval.
