### Control of Fruit Fly in Musk Melon

Fruit flies, particularly the Melon Fruit Fly (*Bactrocera cucurbitae*), are a major pest of musk melon in Haryana, causing significant damage by laying eggs in developing fruits, leading to rotting and yield loss. An Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is recommended for effective control.

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Methods:**

*   **Field Sanitation:** Regularly collect and destroy all infested, fallen, or damaged fruits by burying them deep in the soil or burning them. This breaks the life cycle of the pest.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** After harvest, deep ploughing helps expose and kill pupae present in the soil.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid continuous cultivation of cucurbit crops in the same field.
*   **Bagging of Fruits:** For small-scale cultivation, individual fruits can be covered with paper or cloth bags once they start developing to prevent egg-laying.

**2. Pheromone Traps:**

*   Install specific **Cue-lure pheromone traps** at a density of 10-12 traps per acre. These traps attract and kill male fruit flies, reducing the breeding population. Replace the lure every 2-3 weeks.

**3. Bait Sprays:**

Bait sprays are highly effective and target-specific for fruit flies. Mix an insecticide with a food attractant (like jaggery or molasses) and apply it as spot sprays on the foliage, not directly on the fruits.

*   **Malathion 50% EC**: Mix 2.0 ml of **Malathion 50% EC** with 10 g of jaggery or molasses per litre of water.
*   **Fenthion 50% EC**: Mix 2.0 ml of **Fenthion 50% EC** with 10 g of jaggery or molasses per litre of water.
*   **Spinosad 45% SC**: Mix 0.3 ml of **Spinosad 45% SC** with 10 g of jaggery or molasses per litre of water.

Apply these bait sprays on the lower leaves and surrounding vegetation, preferably in the morning. Repeat applications every 7-10 days, especially during the fruiting stage.

**4. Chemical Sprays (Foliar Application):**

If the infestation is severe and bait sprays are not providing adequate control, foliar sprays can be used. Always ensure proper coverage and adhere to the pre-harvest interval (PHI).

*   **Dimethoate 30% EC**: Apply at a rate of 1.0-1.5 ml per litre of water.
*   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC**: Apply at a rate of 0.5 ml per litre of water.
*   **Deltamethrin 2.8% EC**: Apply at a rate of 0.8-1.0 ml per litre of water.

### Control of Ber Fly in Musk Melon

This is not known to affect Musk Melon. Ber fly (*Carpomyia vesuviana*) is a specific pest of Ber (Indian Jujube - *Ziziphus mauritiana*) and does not infest musk melon.

**Important Note:** Always read the label instructions of any pesticide before use, wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), and observe the recommended pre-harvest interval (PHI) to ensure food safety. For specific local recommendations, please consult your nearest Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or agricultural extension officer.
