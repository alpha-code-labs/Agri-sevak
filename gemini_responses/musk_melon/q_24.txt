As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following for the ideal transplantation of Musk Melon in Haryana:

### Ideal Transplantation Time

*   **Late January to March:** This period is optimal for open-field cultivation in Haryana, ensuring the crop avoids frost damage and benefits from rising temperatures for vigorous growth. For early crops, transplanting can begin in late January, extending to March for successive plantings.

### Ideal Transplantation Distance

*   **Row-to-Row:** 1.5 - 2.5 meters (m)
*   **Plant-to-Plant:** 0.6 - 1.0 meter (m)
*   A common and effective spacing is **2.0 m between rows and 0.6 m between plants** on ridges or raised beds, allowing for proper vine spread, air circulation, and ease of cultural operations.

### Ideal Transplantation Process

1.  **Seedling Preparation:**
    *   Sow Musk Melon seeds in nursery trays or polybags filled with a good quality potting mix 3-4 weeks before the intended transplanting date.
    *   Ensure seedlings develop 2-4 true leaves and a robust root system.
    *   Harden off seedlings for about a week prior to transplanting by gradually reducing water and exposing them to outdoor conditions to acclimate them to the field environment.

2.  **Field Preparation:**
    *   Select a well-drained, fertile sandy loam to loam soil.
    *   Perform deep ploughing followed by 2-3 harrowing operations to achieve a fine, friable tilth.
    *   Incorporate 20-25 tonnes/acre of well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost during the final ploughing.
    *   Prepare raised beds or ridges and furrows at the recommended spacing. Raised beds are generally preferred for better drainage and aeration.
    *   Pre-irrigate the field lightly a day or two before transplanting if the soil is dry.

3.  **Actual Transplanting:**
    *   Transplant seedlings preferably in the late afternoon or on a cloudy day to minimize transplant shock.
    *   Carefully remove seedlings from the nursery trays/polybags, ensuring the root ball remains intact.
    *   Dig a hole slightly larger than the root ball at the desired spacing on the ridges/beds.
    *   Place the seedling in the hole, ensuring the soil level around the stem is the same as it was in the nursery. Avoid burying the stem too deep.
    *   Gently firm the soil around the base of the seedling to remove any air pockets.
    *   Immediately irrigate the transplanted seedlings to settle the soil and provide initial moisture.

4.  **Post-Transplanting Care:**
    *   Maintain adequate soil moisture, but avoid waterlogging, especially during the initial establishment phase.
    *   Monitor for early signs of pests and diseases and take appropriate action as per HAU recommendations.
    *   Provide light support or training if using a trellising system, once vines begin to grow.
