As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm that **Black, Brown, Yellow, White, and Red rust diseases are not known to affect Musk Melon.**

Musk Melon (Cucumis melo) is susceptible to various fungal diseases, but true rusts (caused by fungi from the order Pucciniales) are not considered a common or significant problem for this crop. Symptoms that might be mistaken for rust are often caused by other fungal pathogens like downy mildew, powdery mildew, or anthracnose, which have different control strategies.
