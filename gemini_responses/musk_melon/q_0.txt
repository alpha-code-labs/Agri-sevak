As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Musk Melon in Haryana.

**General Cultural Practices for Fungal Disease Management:**
Implementing good cultural practices is the first line of defense against fungal diseases.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Whenever possible, choose musk melon varieties known for resistance or tolerance to common fungal diseases prevalent in Haryana.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice a 2-3 year crop rotation with non-cucurbit crops to break the disease cycle and reduce pathogen inoculum in the soil.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Promptly remove and destroy infected plant debris, including leaves, stems, and fruits, especially after harvest. Control weeds, as they can act as alternative hosts for pathogens.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing (as per recommended guidelines for your chosen variety) to improve air circulation within the canopy, which reduces humidity and discourages fungal growth.
*   **Irrigation Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day, as wet foliage for extended periods promotes fungal development. Drip irrigation is preferred. If overhead irrigation is used, do it in the morning to allow foliage to dry quickly.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced fertilizers based on soil test recommendations. Excessive nitrogen can lead to lush, succulent growth, making plants more susceptible to some diseases.

**Specific Disease Control Measures:**

1.  **Alternaria Leaf Spot/Blight (Caused by *Alternaria cucumerina*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Small, circular, water-soaked spots on leaves that enlarge, become angular, and turn brown with characteristic concentric rings (target-spot appearance). Severe infection leads to premature defoliation, reducing yield and fruit quality.
    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   Spray with **Mancozeb** at 2.0-2.5 kg/acre (dissolved in 500-750 L water) or 2.5-3.0 g/L water.
        *   Alternatively, use **Chlorothalonil** at 1.0-1.25 kg/acre (dissolved in 500-750 L water) or 2.0-2.5 g/L water.
        *   For systemic action, apply **Azoxystrobin** at 200 ml/acre (dissolved in 200-400 L water) or 0.5-1.0 ml/L water.
        *   **Difenoconazole** at 100 ml/acre (dissolved in 200-400 L water) or 0.2-0.4 ml/L water.

2.  **Anthracnose (Caused by *Colletotrichum orbiculare*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Circular, black, sunken lesions on fruits, often with pinkish spore masses in humid conditions. On leaves, irregular, dark brown spots appear, which may dry and fall out, creating a shot-hole appearance. Stem lesions are elongated and sunken.
    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   Spray with **Mancozeb** at 2.0-2.5 kg/acre (dissolved in 500-750 L water) or 2.5-3.0 g/L water.
        *   Alternatively, use **Chlorothalonil** at 1.0-1.25 kg/acre (dissolved in 500-750 L water) or 2.0-2.5 g/L water.
        *   For systemic control, apply **Carbendazim** at 200-300 g/acre (dissolved in 200-400 L water) or 0.5-0.6 g/L water.
        *   **Azoxystrobin** at 200 ml/acre (dissolved in 200-400 L water) or 0.5-1.0 ml/L water.
        *   **Difenoconazole** at 100 ml/acre (dissolved in 200-400 L water) or 0.2-0.4 ml/L water.

3.  **Blast**
    *   This is not known to affect Musk Melon. Blast disease primarily affects cereals like rice and wheat.

4.  **Blight (General Term)**
    *   The term "Blight" is a general symptom describing rapid and extensive browning, death, and shriveling of plant tissues. Specific blights affecting Musk Melon are covered under Alternaria Leaf Spot/Blight.

5.  **Brown Spot**
    *   This is not a primary, distinct disease name for Musk Melon. Symptoms resembling brown spots might be caused by other pathogens like Alternaria or environmental stress.

6.  **Downy Mildew (Caused by *Pseudoperonospora cubensis*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Angular, water-soaked spots on the upper leaf surface, delimited by veins. These spots turn yellow and then brown. A characteristic purplish-grey, downy fungal growth may be visible on the underside of the leaves, especially in humid conditions.
    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   For preventive control, spray **Mancozeb** at 2.0-2.5 kg/acre (dissolved in 500-750 L water) or 2.5-3.0 g/L water.
        *   Systemic options include **Propamocarb hydrochloride** at 1.5-2.0 L/acre (dissolved in 500-750 L water) or 3.0-4.0 ml/L water.
        *   Combination products like **Cymoxanil + Mancozeb** at 1.2-1.5 kg/acre (dissolved in 500-750 L water) or 2.4-3.0 g/L water.
        *   **Fenamidone + Mancozeb** at 1.0 kg/acre (dissolved in 500-750 L water) or 2.0 g/L water.
        *   **Azoxystrobin** at 200 ml/acre (dissolved in 200-400 L water) or 0.5-1.0 ml/L water.
        *   **Dimethomorph** at 500 g/acre (dissolved in 200-400 L water) or 1.0-1.25 g/L water.
        *   **Fluopicolide + Propamocarb hydrochloride** at 600 ml/acre (dissolved in 200-400 L water) or 1.5-2.0 ml/L water.

7.  **Powdery Mildew (Caused by *Podosphaera xanthii* or *Erysiphe cichoracearum*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** White, powdery patches appear on the upper and lower surfaces of leaves, stems, and petioles. These patches enlarge and coalesce, eventually covering the entire leaf, leading to premature defoliation, reduced fruit size, and quality.
    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   Spray **Sulphur** (Wettable Sulphur 80% WP) at 1.5-2.0 kg/acre (dissolved in 500-750 L water) or 3.0-4.0 g/L water.
        *   Systemic options include **Myclobutanil** at 200-240 ml/acre (dissolved in 200-400 L water) or 0.5-0.6 ml/L water.
        *   **Penconazole** at 100-150 ml/acre (dissolved in 200-400 L water) or 0.25-0.375 ml/L water.
        *   **Azoxystrobin** at 200 ml/acre (dissolved in 200-400 L water) or 0.5-1.0 ml/L water.
        *   **Difenoconazole** at 100 ml/acre (dissolved in 200-400 L water) or 0.2-0.4 ml/L water.
        *   **Tebuconazole** at 250 ml/acre (dissolved in 200-400 L water) or 0.6-0.8 ml/L water.
        *   **Flusilazole** at 100 ml/acre (dissolved in 200-400 L water) or 0.2-0.4 ml/L water.

8.  **Grey Mildew**
    *   This is not known to affect Musk Melon.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and strictly follow the label instructions of any pesticide for correct dosage, application method, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and safety precautions.
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action (FRAC codes) to prevent the development of fungicide resistance in pathogen populations.
*   Apply fungicides preventively or at the very first sign of disease for the most effective control.
*   For the most current recommendations and specific regional outbreaks, always consult your local agricultural extension office or HAU experts.
