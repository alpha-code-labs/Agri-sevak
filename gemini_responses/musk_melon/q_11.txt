Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I will provide scientifically verified advice for controlling beetles and weevils in Musk Melon. Regarding sawflies, please note the specific information below.

### Control of Beetles and Weevils in Musk Melon

Beetles, particularly the Red Pumpkin Beetle (Aulacophora foveicollis), are significant pests of Musk Melon in Haryana, causing damage to leaves, flowers, and young fruits. Weevils can also occasionally infest the crop. Effective management involves a combination of cultural practices and judicious use of CIBRC-approved insecticides.

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Control Measures:**

*   **Field Sanitation:** Keep the field free of weeds and crop residues, which can harbor pests.
*   **Early Sowing:** Sowing the crop early can help escape peak pest infestation periods.
*   **Hand-picking:** In the initial stages of infestation and for small plots, adult beetles can be hand-picked and destroyed, especially in the morning hours.
*   **Monitoring:** Regularly monitor your crop for the presence of beetles and weevils to initiate control measures promptly.

**2. Chemical Control Measures (when infestation is high):**

When pest populations are high and cultural methods are insufficient, the following CIBRC-approved insecticides can be used. Always ensure thorough coverage of the plant foliage.

*   **For Beetles (e.g., Red Pumpkin Beetle):**
    *   **Malathion** 50% EC: Apply at 1.0-1.5 L per acre, diluted in 500-750 L of water.
    *   **Carbaryl** 50% WP: Apply at 1.0-1.2 kg per acre, diluted in 500-600 L of water.
    *   **Cypermethrin** 25% EC: Apply at 200-240 ml per acre, diluted in 200-400 L of water.
    *   **Fipronil** 5% SC: Apply at 600-800 ml per acre, diluted in 200-400 L of water.
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: Apply at 100-125 ml per acre, diluted in 200-400 L of water. (Effective against some beetles and also sucking pests).
    *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: Apply at 50-100 g per acre, diluted in 200-400 L of water. (Effective against some beetles and also sucking pests).

*   **For Weevils:**
    *   Many of the insecticides listed above for beetles are also effective against weevils. You can use **Malathion** 50% EC, **Carbaryl** 50% WP, **Cypermethrin** 25% EC, or **Fipronil** 5% SC at the recommended dosages.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the insecticide label carefully.
*   Observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) specified on the label to ensure the safety of the produce.
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
*   Spray during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.

### Sawflies in Musk Melon

This is not known to affect Musk Melon as a significant pest in Haryana or generally in cucurbit cultivation.
