As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following cultivation practices for Musk Melon in Haryana:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   Musk melon is primarily grown by direct seeding.
    *   Sowing is typically done on the sides of ridges or on raised beds to ensure proper drainage and facilitate irrigation.
    *   For direct seeding, seeds are sown in hills (pits) or along furrows.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   Seeds should be sown at a depth of 2-3 cm.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   **Row to Row:** 1.5 - 2.5 meters
    *   **Plant to Plant:** 0.6 - 1.0 meter
    *   This spacing allows for adequate vine growth and air circulation, which is crucial for fruit development and disease prevention.

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   1.0 - 1.5 kg per acre.
