As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm that all the rot types you've mentioned (Root, Stem, Foot, Collar, Crown, Neck, Black, Fruit, Seed, and Seedling rot) are known to affect Musk Melon in varying degrees and can cause significant yield losses. Effective control requires an integrated disease management (IDM) approach, combining cultural practices, resistant varieties (if available), and judicious use of CIBRC-approved chemical fungicides.

Here's a comprehensive strategy to control these rot types in Musk Melon:

**I. Cultural and Agronomic Practices (Prevention is Key):**

1.  **Site Selection and Soil Preparation:**
    *   Choose well-drained fields. Avoid low-lying areas prone to waterlogging.
    *   Prepare raised beds (15-20 cm high) to improve drainage and prevent water stagnation around the plant base.
    *   Ensure proper soil aeration through good tillage.
2.  **Crop Rotation:**
    *   Practice a minimum 3-year crop rotation with non-cucurbit crops (e.g., cereals, pulses) to reduce soil-borne pathogen inoculum.
3.  **Seed Selection and Treatment:**
    *   Use healthy, certified seeds from reputable sources.
    *   **Seed Treatment** is crucial for preventing seed rot and seedling damping-off. Treat seeds with:
        *   **Carbendazim 50% WP**: 2 g/kg seed
        *   **Thiram 75% WS**: 2.5-3 g/kg seed
        *   **Metalaxyl-M 35% WS**: 1-2 g/kg seed (especially effective against *Pythium* and *Phytophthora*)
        *   Alternatively, use a biological agent like **Trichoderma viride 1% WP**: 4-5 g/kg seed.
4.  **Water Management:**
    *   Avoid excessive irrigation, especially during cooler periods or when plants are young.
    *   Use drip irrigation to deliver water directly to the root zone, minimizing wetting of foliage and stems.
    *   If using furrow irrigation, ensure water does not stand around the plant collar region for extended periods.
    *   Irrigate in the morning to allow foliage to dry before nightfall.
5.  **Planting Density and Spacing:**
    *   Maintain optimal plant spacing to ensure good air circulation, which reduces humidity around plants and discourages fungal growth.
6.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Provide balanced nutrition. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can lead to lush, succulent growth more susceptible to rot.
    *   Ensure adequate potassium and calcium for stronger cell walls.
7.  **Weed Control:**
    *   Keep fields free of weeds, as they can harbor pathogens, increase humidity, and compete for nutrients.
8.  **Sanitation:**
    *   Promptly remove and destroy infected plant parts (leaves, stems, fruits) to prevent the spread of disease.
    *   Clean tools and equipment after use in infected areas.
9.  **Mulching:**
    *   Use plastic mulch to prevent direct contact of fruits with soil, reduce soil splash (which can spread pathogens), and help manage soil moisture.
10. **Support for Fruits:**
    *   For fruit rot, especially in trailing varieties, use straw or plastic sheets under developing fruits to keep them off the moist soil.

**II. Chemical Control (As per CIBRC Guidelines for Haryana):**

Chemical control should be used as a supplementary measure when cultural practices are insufficient or disease pressure is high.

**A. For Seedling Rots (Damping-off), Root Rot, Collar Rot, Foot Rot, Crown Rot (Soil-borne pathogens like *Pythium*, *Phytophthora*, *Rhizoctonia*, *Fusarium*):**

1.  **Soil Drenching:**
    *   At the first sign of disease or as a prophylactic measure in susceptible areas, drench the soil around the base of plants with:
        *   **Metalaxyl-M 3.3% + Mancozeb 64% WP**: 2-2.5 g/L water
        *   **Propamocarb Hydrochloride 72.2% SL**: 2-3 ml/L water
        *   **Carbendazim 50% WP**: 1-1.5 g/L water (for *Fusarium* and *Rhizoctonia*)
        *   **Thiophanate Methyl 70% WP**: 1-1.5 g/L water (for *Fusarium* and *Rhizoctonia*)
2.  **Biological Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Trichoderma viride 1% WP**: 2.5 kg/acre mixed with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost, at the time of planting or as a drench.

**B. For Stem Rot, Neck Rot, Black Rot (Gummy Stem Blight), Fruit Rot (Caused by *Didymella bryoniae*, *Alternaria*, *Colletotrichum*, *Phytophthora*, *Rhizopus*, etc.):**

1.  **Foliar Sprays:**
    *   Initiate sprays at the appearance of symptoms or during periods conducive to disease development (high humidity, rainfall).
    *   **For Oomycete-related rots (*Phytophthora*):**
        *   **Fosetyl-Al 80% WP**: 2.5 g/L water
        *   **Metalaxyl-M 3.3% + Mancozeb 64% WP**: 2-2.5 g/L water
    *   **For Fungal rots (*Didymella*, *Alternaria*, *Colletotrichum*, *Fusarium*):**
        *   **Chlorothalonil 75% WP**: 2 g/L water
        *   **Mancozeb 75% WP**: 2-2.5 g/L water (protective)
        *   **Carbendazim 50% WP**: 1-1.5 g/L water
        *   **Thiophanate Methyl 70% WP**: 1-1.5 g/L water
        *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC**: 0.5-1 ml/L water (broad-spectrum, systemic)
        *   **Pyraclostrobin 5% + Metiram 55% WG**: 2-2.5 g/L water
        *   **Tebuconazole 50% + Trifloxystrobin 25% WG**: 0.4-0.6 g/L water

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Rotation of Fungicides:** To prevent the development of fungicide resistance, rotate fungicides with different modes of action.
*   **Adherence to Label Instructions:** Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the fungicide label regarding dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   **Timely Application:** Early detection and timely application of fungicides are crucial for effective control.

By implementing these integrated strategies, you can significantly reduce the incidence and severity of various rot diseases in your Musk Melon crop. For specific local recommendations or disease diagnosis, please consult with the plant pathology experts at HAU, Hisar.
