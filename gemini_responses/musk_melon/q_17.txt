As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following doses of organic manures for Musk Melon cultivation in Haryana, based on scientific principles and local agricultural practices:

It is always advisable to conduct a soil test to determine the specific nutrient requirements of your field and adjust these recommendations accordingly.

*   **Farm Yard Manure (FYM):**
    *   **Recommended Dose:** 10-15 tonnes per acre.
    *   **Application:** Ensure the FYM is well-decomposed (at least 3-6 months old) to avoid nutrient lock-up and weed issues. Incorporate it thoroughly into the soil during the initial land preparation, at least 2-3 weeks before sowing or transplanting the Musk Melon seedlings.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   **Recommended Dose:** 2-4 tonnes per acre.
    *   **Application:** Vermicompost can be applied during land preparation along with FYM, or it can be used as a top-dressing around the plants during early growth stages. For targeted application, it can also be mixed into the planting pits before sowing seeds or transplanting seedlings.

*   **Sagarika (IFFCO):**
    *   Sagarika is a seaweed extract-based bio-stimulant available in liquid and granular forms. Its application complements the bulk organic manures by enhancing nutrient uptake and plant vigor.
    *   **Sagarika (Liquid):**
        *   **Foliar Spray:** 2-4 ml per litre of water. Apply 2-3 sprays during the crop cycle. The first spray can be given around 20-25 days after sowing/transplanting, followed by subsequent sprays at 15-20 day intervals, especially during flowering and fruit development stages.
        *   **Soil Drench/Drip Application:** 1-2 litres per acre, applied during critical growth stages to stimulate root development and nutrient absorption.
    *   **Sagarika Z+ (Granular):**
        *   **Recommended Dose:** 8-16 kg per acre.
        *   **Application:** Apply at the time of sowing or transplanting by mixing it with the soil in the root zone. This provides a slow-release benefit to the young plants.
