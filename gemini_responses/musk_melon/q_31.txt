As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I will provide scientifically verified advice for controlling these physical damage issues in Musk Melon, suitable for Haryana conditions.

### 1. Fruit Bursting (Cracking)

**Causes:** This is primarily due to sudden fluctuations in soil moisture (e.g., a dry spell followed by heavy irrigation or rain), leading to rapid water uptake and internal pressure that the fruit skin cannot withstand. Deficiencies of Calcium and Boron can also weaken the fruit skin and make it more susceptible to cracking.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Consistent Irrigation:** Maintain uniform soil moisture throughout the fruit development stage. Avoid extremes of drought followed by heavy watering. Drip irrigation is highly recommended for precise water management, ensuring a steady supply of moisture.
*   **Mulching:** Apply organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves, black plastic mulch) around the plants. This helps to conserve soil moisture, regulate soil temperature, and reduce evaporation, thereby minimizing moisture fluctuations.
*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Calcium:** Ensure adequate Calcium supply, as it is crucial for strengthening cell walls and improving fruit skin elasticity. Apply **Calcium nitrate** at 2-3 kg/acre through fertigation or 5 g/L as a foliar spray during fruit development.
    *   **Boron:** Boron is essential for cell wall formation and integrity. Apply **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate) at 1-1.5 kg/acre as a soil application before planting or **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** at 1-1.5 g/L as a foliar spray during flowering and fruit set.
*   **Variety Selection:** Choose Musk Melon varieties known for their genetic resistance to fruit cracking.

### 2. Leaf Burning/Melting

**Causes:** This condition is typically a result of abiotic stresses such as high temperatures, intense solar radiation (sunburn), water stress, or sometimes chemical phytotoxicity from improper pesticide/fertilizer application.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Adequate and Timely Irrigation:** Ensure plants receive sufficient water, especially during hot periods and peak growth stages. Water deeply and consistently to prevent water stress, which exacerbates heat and sun damage.
*   **Shade Management:** In regions with extremely high temperatures and intense sunlight, consider using temporary shade nets (e.g., 30-40% shade) during the hottest parts of the day or critical growth stages to reduce solar radiation and leaf temperature.
*   **Mulching:** Mulch helps to keep the soil cooler and reduces water evaporation, thereby mitigating heat and water stress on the plants.
*   **Proper Chemical Application:** If applying pesticides or foliar nutrients, ensure they are applied during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) and at recommended dosages to avoid phytotoxicity. Avoid spraying on water-stressed plants.
*   **Potassium Nutrition:** Adequate **Potassium** improves plant tolerance to various environmental stresses, including heat and drought. Apply **Potassium sulphate** at 20-25 kg/acre as a basal dose or through fertigation during vegetative and fruit development stages.

### 3. Hardness in Fruit

**Causes:** This is often associated with premature harvesting, insufficient water supply during fruit development, or nutrient imbalances, particularly a lack of Potassium, which is vital for fruit quality and sugar accumulation.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Timely Harvesting:** Harvest fruits at their physiological maturity. For Musk Melon, this is typically indicated by the development of a full "slip" (separation of the fruit from the stem with gentle pressure), prominent netting, and a characteristic sweet aroma. Harvesting too early will result in hard, unripe fruits with poor flavor.
*   **Consistent Water Supply:** Ensure a steady and adequate supply of water throughout the fruit development period. Water stress can lead to smaller, harder fruits with poor texture and reduced sweetness.
*   **Balanced Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Potassium:** Potassium plays a vital role in fruit development, sugar accumulation, and overall fruit quality, including texture. Ensure sufficient **Potassium** supply. Apply **Potassium chloride** (Muriate of Potash) at 40-50 kg/acre as a basal dose or **Potassium nitrate** at 2-3 kg/acre through fertigation during fruit enlargement and ripening stages.
*   **Variety Selection:** Choose varieties known for their good texture and sweetness when mature under local growing conditions.
