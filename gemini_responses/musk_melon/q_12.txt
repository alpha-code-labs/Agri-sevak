Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling Scale insects and Mealybugs in Musk Melon (Kharbuja) in Haryana. Both these pests are sap-sucking insects that can cause significant damage if not managed effectively.

**General Management Principles:**

1.  **Regular Monitoring:** Inspect your plants frequently, especially the undersides of leaves, stems, and fruit calyx, for early signs of infestation.
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy severely infested plant parts (leaves, stems, fruits) to reduce pest populations.
    *   **Weed Control:** Keep the field free of weeds, as they can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
    *   **Proper Nutrition:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush, soft growth that is more attractive to sucking pests.
    *   **Water Management:** Ensure proper irrigation to maintain plant vigor, as stressed plants are more susceptible.
3.  **Biological Control:** Encourage natural enemies like ladybird beetles (coccinellids), lacewings, and parasitic wasps. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that can harm these beneficial insects.

**Chemical Control Recommendations:**

When infestations are severe and cultural/biological methods are insufficient, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and stems where these pests often hide. Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

**For both Scale Insects and Mealybugs, the following CIBRC approved insecticides are effective:**

*   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at a rate of **2.0 - 2.5 ml per litre of water**. This is an Insect Growth Regulator (IGR) that interferes with molting, providing good control over time.
*   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:** Apply at a rate of **1.0 - 1.5 ml per litre of water**. This is a systemic insecticide with translaminar action, highly effective against scales and mealybugs, moving both upwards and downwards in the plant.
*   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at a rate of **0.25 - 0.3 ml per litre of water**. This is a systemic neonicotinoid insecticide effective against a wide range of sucking pests.
*   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at a rate of **0.2 g per litre of water**. Another systemic neonicotinoid, effective against sucking pests.
*   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply at a rate of **0.2 - 0.25 g per litre of water**. This is also a systemic neonicotinoid, providing good control.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Spray Volume:** Ensure adequate spray volume (typically 500-600 litres per hectare, depending on crop canopy) to achieve thorough coverage.
*   **Timing:** Apply insecticides when pest populations are low to moderate. For scales and mealybugs, early detection and treatment are crucial before they develop protective waxy coverings or large colonies.
*   **Safety:** Always read and follow the instructions on the insecticide label, including dosage, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and safety precautions (wearing gloves, mask, etc.).
*   **Resistance Management:** Do not use the same chemical repeatedly. Rotate between insecticides with different modes of action to prevent pests from developing resistance.

By integrating these practices, you can effectively manage Scale insects and Mealybugs in your Musk Melon crop. For any further specific queries, please feel free to consult with the entomology department at HAU.
