Mites, particularly Red spider mite (*Tetranychus urticae*) and various Rust mites (*Aculops cucurbitae* and others), are significant pests of Musk Melon in Haryana, causing considerable damage by sucking sap from leaves, leading to stippling, bronzing, leaf distortion, and reduced fruit quality and yield. Effective management requires an integrated approach.

Here's how to control mites in Musk Melon:

**1. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Principles:**

*   **Regular Monitoring:** Frequently inspect the underside of leaves, especially during dry and warm weather, for the presence of mites, their eggs, and webbing (for red spider mites). Early detection is crucial for effective control.
*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the field and surrounding areas free of weeds, as many weeds can serve as alternate hosts for mites.
    *   **Proper Irrigation:** Avoid water stress, as stressed plants are more susceptible to mite infestations. Overhead irrigation can sometimes help dislodge mites, but ensure it doesn't promote fungal diseases.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy severely infested plant parts or entire plants to reduce the pest population.
*   **Biological Control:**
    *   Conserve natural enemies like predatory mites (*Amblyseius* spp., *Phytoseiulus persimilis*) and lacewings, which feed on pest mites. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

**2. Chemical Control (Acaricides):**

When mite populations reach damaging levels, chemical intervention with CIBRC-approved acaricides is necessary. Always ensure thorough coverage, especially on the underside of leaves where mites reside. Rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

Here are some recommended CIBRC-approved acaricides and their typical dosages:

*   For **Red Spider Mite** and **Rust Mite**:
    *   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC**: 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Fenpyroximate 5% SC**: 1.0 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Propargite 57% EC**: 1.5 - 2.0 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Abamectin 1.9% EC**: 0.4 - 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Fenazaquin 10% EC**: 1.0 - 1.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Pyridaben 10% WP**: 1.0 - 1.5 g per litre of water.
    *   **Etoxazole 10% SC**: 0.5 ml per litre of water (primarily targets eggs and nymphs, acting as a mite growth regulator).

*   Specifically for **Rust Mite** (and also suppresses Red Spider Mite and Powdery Mildew):
    *   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP**: 2.0 - 3.0 g per litre of water.
        *   **Caution:** Do not apply sulphur when temperatures are very high (above 30-32°C) or expected to rise significantly, as it can cause phytotoxicity (burning of leaves) in cucurbits. Also, avoid applying sulphur within 10-14 days of applying oil-based sprays.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Rotation:** Always rotate different groups of acaricides to prevent mites from developing resistance.
*   **Thorough Coverage:** Mites are often found on the underside of leaves, so ensure your spray thoroughly covers these areas.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always check the product label for the recommended pre-harvest interval (PHI) to ensure the safety of the harvested fruit.
*   **Safety:** Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying. Follow all safety instructions on the product label.
