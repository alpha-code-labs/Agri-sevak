Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I advise you to first conduct a comprehensive soil test of your field. This is the most accurate way to determine the exact nutrient status and tailor your fertilization program. However, based on visual symptoms, here's how to address common macro-nutrient deficiencies in Musk Melon:

### General Recommendation:
Always ensure proper irrigation and drainage, as water stress can exacerbate nutrient deficiency symptoms.

### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   General yellowing or pale green colour of older leaves (chlorosis).
*   Stunted plant growth with thin stems.
*   Reduced fruit set and smaller fruits.

**Correction:**
*   **Soil Application (Top-dressing):**
    *   Apply **Urea** at 10-15 kg per acre. This can be split into 2-3 applications at 10-15 day intervals, depending on the severity of the deficiency and the growth stage. Incorporate lightly into the soil and irrigate.
    *   Alternatively, **Ammonium Sulphate** can be used at 20-30 kg per acre, especially if sulphur is also deficient.
*   **Foliar Spray:**
    *   Prepare a 1-2% solution of **Urea** (10-20 g of **Urea** per litre of water).
    *   Spray thoroughly on the foliage, preferably in the morning or late afternoon.
    *   Repeat 2-3 times at 7-10 day intervals until symptoms subside.

### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   Dark green or purplish discoloration, especially on the underside of older leaves and stems.
*   Stunted growth, poor root development.
*   Delayed maturity and reduced fruit quality.

**Correction:**
*   **Soil Application:** Phosphorus is less mobile in the soil, so foliar application is generally not very effective for correcting severe deficiencies.
    *   Apply **Di-Ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** at 20-30 kg per acre as a side-dressing, incorporated into the soil near the root zone.
    *   Alternatively, **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** can be applied at 50-75 kg per acre.
    *   Ensure good soil moisture after application to facilitate nutrient uptake.

### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   Yellowing and browning (scorching or necrosis) of leaf margins, starting from older leaves.
*   Weak stems and lodging.
*   Poor fruit development, reduced sweetness, and susceptibility to diseases.

**Correction:**
*   **Soil Application (Top-dressing):**
    *   Apply **Muriate of Potash (Potassium Chloride)** at 10-15 kg per acre. This can be split into 2 applications.
    *   Alternatively, **Sulphate of Potash (Potassium Sulphate)** can be used at 10-15 kg per acre, which also provides sulphur.
    *   Incorporate into the soil near the root zone and irrigate.
*   **Foliar Spray:**
    *   Prepare a 1-2% solution of **Potassium Sulphate** (10-20 g of **Potassium Sulphate** per litre of water).
    *   Spray thoroughly on the foliage, preferably in the morning or late afternoon.
    *   Repeat 2-3 times at 7-10 day intervals until symptoms improve.

**Important Note:** These recommendations are general guidelines for correcting deficiencies. For precise nutrient management, always rely on a soil test report from a certified laboratory. Integrated nutrient management, combining organic manures with chemical fertilizers, is always recommended for long-term soil health and productivity.
