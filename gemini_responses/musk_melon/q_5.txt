As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Scab, Canker, Gummosis, and Lichen in Musk Melon in Haryana.

---

### 1. Scab (Causative Agent: *Cladosporium cucumerinum*)

Scab is a common fungal disease affecting Musk Melon, causing characteristic lesions on leaves, stems, and fruits.

**Cultural Control:**
*   Use disease-free seeds and resistant varieties if available.
*   Practice crop rotation with non-cucurbit crops for at least 2-3 years.
*   Ensure good field sanitation by removing and destroying infected plant debris.
*   Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day, to reduce leaf wetness.
*   Provide adequate spacing between plants to improve air circulation.

**Chemical Control:**
Apply fungicides preventively or at the first sign of symptoms, ensuring thorough coverage. Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.
*   **Mancozeb**: 2.5 g/L of water
*   **Chlorothalonil**: 2 g/L of water
*   **Azoxystrobin**: 0.5 ml/L of water
*   **Difenoconazole**: 0.5 ml/L of water

### 2. Canker (Primarily Gummy Stem Blight, Causative Agent: *Didymella bryoniae*)

In Musk Melon, "canker" often refers to the stem lesions caused by Gummy Stem Blight, which can also lead to leaf spots and fruit rot.

**Cultural Control:**
*   Use certified disease-free seeds or transplants.
*   Implement a strict crop rotation program, avoiding cucurbits in the same field for at least 2-3 years.
*   Promptly remove and destroy all infected plant parts and crop residues after harvest.
*   Maintain good field hygiene and control weeds that can harbor the pathogen.
*   Ensure proper ventilation in protected cultivation to reduce humidity.

**Chemical Control:**
Begin applications preventively or at the onset of symptoms. Alternate fungicides with different modes of action.
*   **Mancozeb**: 2.5 g/L of water
*   **Chlorothalonil**: 2 g/L of water
*   **Azoxystrobin**: 0.5 ml/L of water
*   **Difenoconazole**: 0.5 ml/L of water
*   **Tebuconazole**: 0.75 ml/L of water
*   **Boscalid + Pyraclostrobin**: 1.5 g/L of water

### 3. Gummosis

Gummosis is a symptom, not a disease itself, characterized by the exudation of gum from plant tissues. In Musk Melon, it is commonly associated with diseases like Gummy Stem Blight (as described under Canker) or Phytophthora Blight.

**Control focuses on managing the underlying cause:**

**A. If Gummosis is due to Gummy Stem Blight:**
*   Refer to the cultural and chemical control measures listed above for "Canker (Gummy Stem Blight)".

**B. If Gummosis is due to Phytophthora Blight (Causative Agent: *Phytophthora capsici*):**
*   This disease causes water-soaked lesions, fruit rot, and stem lesions often accompanied by gumming.

**Cultural Control:**
*   Ensure excellent soil drainage; plant on raised beds to prevent waterlogging.
*   Avoid planting in fields with a history of Phytophthora Blight.
*   Practice strict sanitation; remove and destroy infected plants and fruits immediately.
*   Avoid moving soil or plant debris from infected areas to healthy ones.

**Chemical Control:**
Apply fungicides preventively, especially during periods of high humidity and rainfall, or at the first sign of disease.
*   **Propamocarb hydrochloride**: 2.5 ml/L of water
*   **Metalaxyl + Mancozeb**: 2.5 g/L of water
*   **Fenamidone + Propamocarb hydrochloride**: 2 ml/L of water

### 4. Lichen

This is not known to affect Musk Melon. Lichens are symbiotic organisms (fungus and alga) that typically grow on stable surfaces like tree bark, rocks, or old wooden structures. They are non-parasitic and do not grow on or harm herbaceous annual plants like Musk Melon.

**General Recommendations:**
*   Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the pesticide label regarding dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest intervals.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   For specific local conditions and the most current recommendations, it is advisable to consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts.
