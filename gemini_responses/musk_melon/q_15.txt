As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Musk Melon in Haryana:

### Control of Pests in Musk Melon

**1. Grasshopper**
Grasshoppers are polyphagous pests that can cause significant damage to Musk Melon by feeding on leaves, stems, and fruits.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Deep ploughing after harvest helps expose and destroy grasshopper eggs laid in the soil.
    *   Maintain field sanitation by removing weeds and crop residues that can serve as breeding grounds.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   For effective control, especially during early stages of infestation, consider the following CIBRC approved insecticides:
        *   **Malathion 50% EC**: Apply at 1.25 L per acre in 500-600 L of water (2.0-2.5 ml/L).
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC**: Apply at 100-120 ml per acre in 500-600 L of water (0.17-0.24 ml/L).

**2. Painted Bug (Bagrada hilaris)**
This is not known to affect Musk Melon.

**3. Red Cotton Bug (Dysdercus cingulatus)**
This is not known to affect Musk Melon.

**4. Black Ants**
Black ants are generally not direct pests of Musk Melon plants. However, they can be problematic indirectly by:
*   Protecting sap-sucking insects like aphids and mealybugs (which excrete honeydew that ants feed on), thereby interfering with natural enemies of these pests.
*   Carrying away sown seeds, especially during germination.
*   Occasionally damaging roots if their nests are too close to young plants.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Maintain good field sanitation to reduce ant nesting sites.
    *   Remove any debris or organic matter that might attract ants.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   If ants are causing significant issues (e.g., protecting other pests or damaging seeds), localized control measures can be adopted:
        *   **For drenching around ant nests or as a barrier:**
            *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC**: Mix 2.5 ml/L of water and drench around the base of affected plants or ant nests.
        *   **For seed protection or general soil treatment if ants are a persistent problem:**
            *   **Fipronil 0.3% GR**: Apply 5-10 kg per acre by broadcasting and light incorporation into the soil, especially in areas prone to ant activity or seed damage.
