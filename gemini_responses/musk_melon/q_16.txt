As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following fertilizer schedule for Musk Melon cultivation in Haryana. Please note that these are general recommendations, and a **soil test is highly recommended** to determine the precise nutrient requirements of your specific field.

**General Nutrient Recommendation (per acre):**
For optimal yield and quality, Musk Melon typically requires:
*   **Nitrogen (N):** 80-100 kg/acre
*   **Phosphorus (P2O5):** 60 kg/acre
*   **Potassium (K2O):** 60 kg/acre
*   **Sulphur (S):** 20 kg/acre

Based on these requirements, here's a breakdown of the recommended doses for various fertilizers:

---

### **1. Conventional Fertilizers**

**A. Basal Application (at the time of planting/bed preparation):**
Apply the entire dose of Phosphorus, Potassium, Sulphur, and one-third of the Nitrogen requirement as a basal dose.

*   **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP):**
    *   **Dose:** 130 kg/acre
    *   *This provides approximately 23.4 kg N and 60 kg P2O5.*
*   **Muriate of Potash (Potash):**
    *   **Dose:** 100 kg/acre
    *   *This provides 60 kg K2O.*
*   **Sulphur (Bentonite Sulphur 90%):**
    *   **Dose:** 20-25 kg/acre
    *   *This provides approximately 18-22.5 kg S.*
*   **Urea:**
    *   **Dose:** 55-60 kg/acre (approximately 1/3rd of the total Urea requirement)
    *   *This provides approximately 25-27.6 kg N.*

**B. Top Dressing (Split Applications for remaining Nitrogen):**
The remaining two-thirds of the Nitrogen should be applied in two equal splits.

*   **Urea:**
    *   **First Top Dressing (3-4 weeks after planting):** 55-60 kg/acre
    *   **Second Top Dressing (at flowering/fruit set stage):** 55-60 kg/acre
    *   *Total Urea for top dressing: 110-120 kg/acre. Combined with basal Urea, this totals 165-180 kg Urea/acre, fulfilling the remaining N requirement after DAP contribution.*

**Summary of Conventional Fertilizers (Total per acre):**
*   **Urea:** 165-180 kg/acre
*   **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP):** 130 kg/acre
*   **Muriate of Potash (Potash):** 100 kg/acre
*   **Sulphur (Bentonite Sulphur 90%):** 20-25 kg/acre
*   **Single Super Phosphate (SSP):** If **DAP** is not used for Phosphorus, then **SSP** can be used.
    *   **Dose (if replacing DAP for P):** Approximately 375 kg/acre
    *   *This provides 60 kg P2O5 and about 41 kg S. If using SSP, adjust Urea dose to meet total N requirement (as SSP provides no N) and reduce separate Sulphur application.*

### **2. Nano Fertilizers (Supplementary)**

Nano fertilizers are designed for foliar application and act as supplements to conventional fertilizers, enhancing nutrient use efficiency. They are not meant to completely replace conventional basal applications.

*   **Nano Urea:**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml/L of water (250-500 ml per acre in 125-250 L water)
    *   **Application:** Foliar spray at critical growth stages (e.g., vegetative growth, pre-flowering). Typically 1-2 sprays are recommended.
*   **Nano DAP:**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml/L of water (250-500 ml per acre in 125-250 L water)
    *   **Application:** Foliar spray at critical growth stages (e.g., pre-flowering, fruit set). Typically 1-2 sprays are recommended.

### **3. NPK Complex Fertilizers**

If using NPK complex fertilizers (e.g., 12:32:16, 10:26:26, 19:19:19), calculate the amount required to meet the target N, P2O5, and K2O doses, and then supplement with individual fertilizers (Urea, Muriate of Potash, Sulphur) to cover any deficits. For example, if using 12:32:16, you would need approximately 187.5 kg/acre to provide 60 kg P2O5, which would also supply 22.5 kg N and 30 kg K2O. You would then need to add more Urea (for N) and Muriate of Potash (for K) to reach the target levels.

### **Important Considerations:**

*   **Soil Testing:** Always prioritize a soil test from a reputable lab (like HAU's soil testing lab) for precise recommendations tailored to your field's nutrient status.
*   **Irrigation:** Ensure adequate moisture in the soil before and after fertilizer application for efficient nutrient uptake.
*   **Organic Matter:** Incorporating farmyard manure (FYM) or compost (10-15 tonnes/acre) during land preparation significantly improves soil health and nutrient availability, potentially reducing the need for chemical fertilizers.
*   **Micronutrients:** Musk Melon may also require micronutrients like Zinc, Boron, and Iron, especially in deficient soils. A soil test will identify these needs.
