Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

Regarding your query about sucking pests in Musk Melon:

Firstly, **Psylla is not known to affect Musk Melon.**

For the control of Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips in Musk Melon, an integrated approach is most effective:

**I. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Practices:**

1.  **Monitoring:** Regularly scout your fields, especially the undersides of leaves, for early detection of pests.
2.  **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy weed hosts around the field, as they can harbor these pests.
3.  **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush growth attractive to sucking pests.
4.  **Water Management:** Ensure proper irrigation to maintain plant vigor, as stressed plants are more susceptible.
5.  **Biological Control:** Encourage natural enemies like ladybird beetles, lacewings, and parasitic wasps by minimizing broad-spectrum pesticide use.
6.  **Yellow Sticky Traps:** Install yellow sticky traps (10-12 traps per acre) to monitor and trap adult whiteflies, leafhoppers, and winged aphids.

**II. Chemical Control (When pest population exceeds economic threshold):**

Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves.

Here are some CIBRC approved technical chemicals and their recommended dosages for foliar spray:

*   **For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips:**
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: 0.5 - 0.75 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: 0.2 - 0.3 g per litre of water.
    *   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP: 0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water.

*   **Specifically for Whiteflies (nymphs and adults) and for resistance management:**
    *   **Buprofezin** 25% SC: 1.25 ml per litre of water. (Primarily effective on nymphs)
    *   **Pyriproxyfen** 10% EC: 1.0 - 1.25 ml per litre of water. (Insect Growth Regulator, effective on eggs and nymphs)
    *   **Spiromesifen** 22.9% SC: 0.5 ml per litre of water. (Also effective on mites)

*   **Specifically for Thrips and for resistance management:**
    *   **Fipronil** 5% SC: 1.5 - 2.0 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Spinosad** 45% SC: 0.25 - 0.3 ml per litre of water.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read the label carefully before use and follow the manufacturer's instructions regarding dosage, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during spraying.
*   Consult your local HAU Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your local conditions and current pest pressure.
