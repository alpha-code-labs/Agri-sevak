As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing these pests in Musk Melon cultivation in Haryana. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is crucial for sustainable and effective control.

**General Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Principles for Musk Melon:**

1.  **Regular Scouting:** Regularly inspect your fields for pest presence, type, and population levels. Early detection is key.
2.  **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy affected plant parts, fallen fruits, and crop residues to reduce pest reservoirs.
3.  **Crop Rotation:** Avoid continuous cultivation of cucurbit crops in the same field.
4.  **Resistant Varieties:** Where available and suitable for your region, consider using pest-tolerant varieties.
5.  **Biological Control:** Encourage natural enemies like parasitic wasps and predatory insects.
6.  **Pheromone Traps:** Use pheromone traps for monitoring and mass trapping of male moths to reduce pest populations.
7.  **Proper Nutrition and Irrigation:** Healthy plants are more resilient to pest attacks.

Here's how to control the specific pests you mentioned:

### 1. Borers (e.g., Fruit Borers like *Helicoverpa armigera*, *Spodoptera litura*)

Borers primarily damage fruits, making them unmarketable.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Collect and destroy infested fruits regularly.
    *   Use pheromone traps to monitor and mass trap adult moths.
    *   Bagging of fruits (if feasible for small-scale cultivation) can protect them.
*   **Chemical Control (Apply when pest incidence crosses economic threshold level):**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** 60 ml per acre.
    *   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG:** 80-100 g per acre.
    *   **Flubendiamide 20% WG:** 50 g per acre.
    *   **Indoxacarb 14.5% SC:** 200 ml per acre.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** 100-120 ml per acre. (Use judiciously, as pyrethroids can sometimes lead to mite outbreaks).
    *   **Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki (Bt) (various formulations):** As per product label, typically 500-1000 g per acre for wettable powder formulations, especially effective against young larvae.

### 2. Caterpillars (e.g., Leaf-eating caterpillars, Semiloopers, Tobacco caterpillar)

Various caterpillar species can defoliate plants, affecting photosynthesis and yield.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Hand-picking and destroying larger caterpillars in early stages.
    *   Maintain field sanitation.
*   **Chemical Control (Apply when pest incidence crosses economic threshold level):**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** 60 ml per acre.
    *   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG:** 80-100 g per acre.
    *   **Flubendiamide 20% WG:** 50 g per acre.
    *   **Indoxacarb 14.5% SC:** 200 ml per acre.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** 100-120 ml per acre.
    *   **Novaluron 10% EC:** 750 ml per acre.
    *   **Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki (Bt) (various formulations):** As per product label, typically 500-1000 g per acre, particularly useful for early instar larvae.

### 3. Diamondback Moth (*Plutella xylostella*)

This is not known to affect Musk Melon. Diamondback moth is a specific pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower, mustard).

### 4. Leaf folder (Caterpillars causing leaf damage/folding)

While a specific "leaf folder" pest is not as prominent in musk melon as in some other crops, certain caterpillars (like the Melon worm, *Diaphania indica*) can web leaves together or cause damage that results in leaf folding. The control measures are similar to those for general caterpillars.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Remove and destroy affected leaves or plant parts with folded leaves containing larvae.
*   **Chemical Control (Apply when pest incidence crosses economic threshold level):**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** 60 ml per acre.
    *   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG:** 80-100 g per acre.
    *   **Flubendiamide 20% WG:** 50 g per acre.
    *   **Indoxacarb 14.5% SC:** 200 ml per acre.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** 100-120 ml per acre.
    *   **Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki (Bt) (various formulations):** As per product label, typically 500-1000 g per acre.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully, including dosage, timing, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.
*   Ensure proper spray coverage for effective control.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and current pest pressure.
