Drying up of branches, leaves, fruits, and flowers in Neem (Azadirachta indica) is a symptom, not a specific disease or pest itself. It indicates that the tree is under significant stress. Accurate diagnosis of the underlying cause is crucial before applying any treatment.

Here are the potential causes and recommended approaches:

**I. Abiotic Factors (Environmental/Non-Pest/Disease Related)**

These are not known to affect Neem as a disease or pest, but rather as environmental stressors.

*   **Water Stress (Drought or Overwatering):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Leaves wilt, turn yellow or brown, and eventually dry up and fall. Branches may die back from the tips. In overwatering, roots rot, leading to similar above-ground symptoms.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Drought:** Ensure adequate irrigation, especially during dry periods and for young trees. Water deeply and less frequently to encourage deep root growth.
        *   **Overwatering:** Improve soil drainage. Neem prefers well-drained soils. Avoid waterlogging around the base of the tree.
*   **Nutrient Deficiency:**
    *   **Symptoms:** General decline, stunted growth, yellowing of leaves (chlorosis), premature leaf drop, and overall poor vigor, which can lead to drying.
    *   **Management:** Conduct a soil test to identify specific deficiencies. Based on the report, apply balanced fertilizers. For general health, well-rotted farmyard manure or compost can be incorporated annually.
*   **Soil Compaction or Poor Aeration:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Roots struggle to grow and absorb water/nutrients, leading to wilting and drying of foliage.
    *   **Management:** Loosen compacted soil around the root zone without damaging major roots. Improve soil structure by adding organic matter.

**II. Biotic Factors (Pests and Diseases)**

These are known to affect Neem.

1.  **Fungal Diseases:**
    *   **Root Rot:**
        *   **Symptoms:** Sudden wilting, yellowing, and drying of leaves, often affecting one side of the tree first, leading to the death of branches or the entire tree. Roots may appear black and mushy.
        *   **Management:** Improve soil drainage. Remove severely affected trees. For early stages, drenching the soil with a fungicide can help.
        *   **Chemical Control (if diagnosed early):**
            *   Drench the soil around the base of the tree with:
                *   **Carbendazim** (50% WP) @ 1-2 g/L of water.
    *   **Dieback:**
        *   **Symptoms:** Progressive drying and death of twigs and branches, starting from the tip and moving downwards. Cankers (sunken lesions) may be visible on affected branches.
        *   **Management:** Prune out all affected branches well into the healthy wood. Disinfect pruning tools between cuts. Burn or dispose of diseased material.
        *   **Chemical Control:**
            *   After pruning, spray the tree with a broad-spectrum fungicide:
                *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP) @ 2.5 g/L of water.
                *   Alternatively, **Copper Oxychloride** (50% WP) @ 3 g/L of water.
    *   **Canker Diseases:**
        *   **Symptoms:** Sunken, discolored lesions on branches or the main trunk, often exuding gum. The tissue beyond the canker may wilt and dry up.
        *   **Management:** Prune out affected branches well below the canker. Scrape off cankers on the main trunk and apply a fungicidal paste.
        *   **Chemical Control:**
            *   After pruning/scraping, apply a paste made from:
                *   **Copper Oxychloride** (50% WP) mixed with a small amount of water to form a thick paste.
                *   Alternatively, spray with **Mancozeb** (75% WP) @ 2.5 g/L of water.

2.  **Insect Pests:**
    *   **Stem/Bark Borers:**
        *   **Symptoms:** Wilting and drying of individual branches or parts of the tree, often with visible holes in the bark, sawdust-like frass (excrement), or galleries under the bark.
        *   **Management:** Identify and remove affected branches. For active borers, a wire can sometimes be used to kill them inside their tunnels.
        *   **Chemical Control:**
            *   Inject a systemic insecticide into the borer holes (if few) or drench the base of the tree (for systemic action):
                *   **Chlorpyrifos** (20% EC) @ 2.5 ml/L of water. (For drenching, use 5-10 L per tree depending on size, ensuring it reaches the root zone).

**General Recommendations:**

*   **Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy fallen leaves, dried branches, and other plant debris to reduce disease inoculum.
*   **Pruning:** Prune dead, diseased, or damaged branches promptly using clean, sharp tools. Disinfect tools with alcohol or bleach solution between cuts.
*   **Tree Health:** Maintain overall tree health through proper watering, nutrition, and protection from mechanical injuries. A healthy tree is more resistant to pests and diseases.

**Crucial Advice:**
Given that "drying up" is a general symptom, it is highly recommended to observe the tree closely for other specific signs (e.g., spots on leaves, cankers on branches, insect holes, root condition) to accurately diagnose the problem. If you are unsure, please contact the nearest Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or the Department of Horticulture/Agriculture for a field visit and expert diagnosis.
