As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Dieback, Twig blight, and Tikka disease in Neem in Haryana.

### Control of Dieback and Twig Blight in Neem

Dieback and Twig blight are significant diseases in Neem, primarily caused by fungal pathogens such as *Phomopsis azadirachtae* and *Colletotrichum gloeosporioides*. These diseases lead to the drying of twigs and branches, often starting from the tip, and can severely impact tree health and productivity.

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   **Pruning:** Regularly inspect trees and prune affected branches well below the visible diseased portion. Ensure a clean cut to promote healing.
*   **Sanitation:** Collect and destroy (preferably by burning) all pruned diseased material to prevent the spread of spores.
*   **Tool Sterilization:** Disinfect pruning tools with a 10% bleach solution or methylated spirit after pruning each tree to avoid transmitting the disease.
*   **Tree Vigor:** Maintain tree health through proper irrigation, balanced fertilization, and weed control to enhance natural resistance. Avoid water stress, especially during dry periods.

**2. Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
For effective control, apply fungicides as a foliar spray, ensuring thorough coverage of the canopy, especially after pruning diseased parts.

*   **Option 1 (Systemic Fungicide):**
    *   **Carbendazim 50% WP:** Apply at a rate of 1-2 g/L of water.
*   **Option 2 (Contact Fungicide):**
    *   **Copper Oxychloride 50% WP:** Apply at a rate of 3-4 g/L of water.
*   **Option 3 (Systemic Fungicide):**
    *   **Propiconazole 25% EC:** Apply at a rate of 0.5-1 ml/L of water.
*   **Option 4 (Contact Fungicide):**
    *   **Mancozeb 75% WP:** Apply at a rate of 2-3 g/L of water.

Repeat applications may be necessary, especially during periods conducive to disease development (e.g., high humidity, monsoon season), typically at 10-15 day intervals.

### Control of Tikka Disease in Neem

This is not known to affect Neem. Tikka disease is primarily a leaf spot disease of groundnut (peanut) caused by *Cercospora arachidicola* and *Phaeoisariopsis personata*. Neem trees may suffer from other leaf spot diseases, but they are not referred to as "Tikka disease."
