As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide scientifically verified advice on addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies in Neem (Azadirachta indica) for conditions prevalent in Haryana.

Neem trees, while hardy, require adequate macro-nutrients (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium) for optimal growth, vigor, and production of active compounds. Visual symptoms can indicate a deficiency, but a soil test is the most accurate method for diagnosis and precise fertilizer recommendations.

**General Approach:**
1.  **Soil Testing:** It is highly recommended to conduct a soil test through HAU or a certified lab to determine the exact nutrient status of your soil. This will provide specific recommendations tailored to your field.
2.  **Observation:** Monitor your Neem trees for visual symptoms of deficiencies.
3.  **Application:** Apply fertilizers based on diagnosis, preferably during the active growing season (e.g., post-monsoon or early spring), and always irrigate after application.

### Addressing Macro-nutrient Deficiencies in Neem:

#### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency:
*   **Symptoms:** General yellowing (chlorosis) of older leaves, stunted growth, reduced leaf size, and premature leaf drop.
*   **Correction (Soil Application):**
    *   For young trees (1-3 years): Apply 50-100 g of **Urea** per plant per year, split into 2-3 applications.
    *   For mature trees (>3 years): Apply 200-500 g of **Urea** per plant per year, split into 2-3 applications.
    *   Apply the fertilizer in a ring around the tree within its drip line, lightly incorporate it into the soil, and follow with irrigation.
*   **Correction (Foliar Application - for quick but temporary relief in severe cases):**
    *   Spray a 0.5-1% solution of **Urea** (5-10 g of **Urea** per litre of water). Apply early morning or late evening.

#### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency:
*   **Symptoms:** Dark green or purplish discoloration of older leaves, stunted growth, poor root development, and delayed maturity. Symptoms are often less distinct than N or K deficiencies.
*   **Correction (Soil Application):**
    *   For young trees (1-3 years): Apply 100-200 g of **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)** or **Single Superphosphate (SSP)** per plant per year.
    *   For mature trees (>3 years): Apply 200-500 g of **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)** or **Single Superphosphate (SSP)** per plant per year.
    *   As phosphorus is less mobile in the soil, it is best applied near the root zone, ideally at planting or by making small holes around the tree. Incorporate and irrigate thoroughly.

#### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency:
*   **Symptoms:** Yellowing and browning (scorching or necrosis) of leaf margins and tips, especially on older leaves. Trees may exhibit weak stems and reduced resistance to stress and diseases.
*   **Correction (Soil Application):**
    *   For young trees (1-3 years): Apply 50-100 g of **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** or **Sulphate of Potash (SOP)** per plant per year.
    *   For mature trees (>3 years): Apply 100-300 g of **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** or **Sulphate of Potash (SOP)** per plant per year.
    *   Apply the fertilizer in a ring around the tree within its drip line, lightly incorporate it into the soil, and follow with irrigation.

**Important Considerations for Neem Cultivation in Haryana:**

*   **Organic Matter:** Regular incorporation of well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost (5-10 kg per young tree, 20-50 kg per mature tree annually) significantly enhances soil fertility, improves nutrient availability, and boosts water retention capacity, thereby reducing reliance on synthetic fertilizers.
*   **Application Timing:** Split applications of fertilizers are generally more efficient than a single large dose, especially for nitrogen.
*   **Watering:** Always ensure adequate irrigation after applying fertilizers to facilitate dissolution and movement into the root zone, and to prevent root burn.
*   **Tree Age and Size:** Adjust fertilizer doses based on the age, size, and observed health of the tree. The recommendations provided are general guidelines.
*   **Environmental Factors:** While Neem is drought-tolerant once established, sufficient soil moisture is crucial for efficient nutrient uptake by the roots.
