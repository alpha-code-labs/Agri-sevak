As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling weeds in Neem plantations or nurseries in Haryana.

Weeds, including broadleaf, narrowleaf, Amarbail, Bathu, Congress grass, and Phalaris minor, compete with Neem (Azadirachta indica) for essential resources like water, nutrients, and sunlight, especially during its establishment phase (first 2-3 years). This competition can significantly hinder the growth and vigor of young Neem trees.

However, regarding Orobanche:
*   **This is not known to affect Neem.** Orobanche species are typically parasitic on specific host plants, and Neem is not a recognized host for these parasitic weeds.

For the control of other listed weeds in Neem plantations or nurseries, an integrated approach combining cultural, manual, and judicious chemical methods is recommended:

**I. Cultural and Manual Control (Highly Recommended for Neem):**

*   **Manual Weeding:** Regular hand weeding or hoeing is the most effective and safest method, especially for young Neem plants. This should be done at critical growth stages to minimize competition.
*   **Mulching:** Applying organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves, wood chips) around the base of Neem trees can suppress weed growth, conserve soil moisture, and regulate soil temperature. Ensure mulch does not touch the main stem to prevent collar rot.
*   **Intercropping:** In wider spaced plantations, short-duration, shallow-rooted crops can be grown between Neem rows to suppress weeds and provide additional income, provided they do not compete excessively with Neem.
*   **Clean Cultivation:** Ensure the area around Neem trees is kept free of weeds, especially during the monsoon season when weed growth is prolific.

**II. Chemical Control (Use with Extreme Caution and Directed Application):**

When using herbicides, always ensure directed application to avoid contact with Neem foliage, stem, or roots, as Neem can be sensitive to many herbicides. Use a protective shield while spraying.

**A. For General Broadleaf and Narrowleaf Weeds (e.g., Bathu, Congress grass, Phalaris minor):**

*   **Non-selective Post-emergence Herbicides (Directed Spray):** These are applied directly onto the weeds, avoiding contact with Neem.
    *   **Glyphosate** (41% SL): Apply at 1.0-1.5 kg a.i./acre (equivalent to 2.5-3.75 L of 41% SL formulation) in 200-300 L of water, as a directed spray.
    *   **Paraquat dichloride** (24% SL): Apply at 0.5-1.0 kg a.i./acre (equivalent to 2.0-4.0 L of 24% SL formulation) in 200-300 L of water, as a directed spray.

*   **Pre-emergence Herbicides (for nurseries or young plantations before weed emergence):**
    *   **Pendimethalin** (30% EC): Apply at 1.0 kg a.i./acre (equivalent to 3.3 L of 30% EC formulation) in 200-300 L of water, immediately after planting or before weed emergence. Ensure uniform soil moisture.
    *   **Oxyfluorfen** (23.5% EC): Apply at 0.2-0.4 kg a.i./acre (equivalent to 0.85-1.7 L of 23.5% EC formulation) in 200-300 L of water, as a pre-emergence application.

**B. For Amarbail (Cuscuta spp.) - Parasitic Weed:**

*   **Manual Removal:** This is the most effective method. Regularly inspect Neem plants and manually remove Amarbail strands as soon as they appear, ensuring complete removal to prevent re-growth.
*   **Pre-emergence:**
    *   **Pendimethalin** (30% EC): As mentioned above, can help in inhibiting Cuscuta seed germination when applied pre-emergence.
*   **Post-emergence (Directed Spot Application):**
    *   **Diquat dibromide** (24% SL): Apply at 0.5-1.0 kg a.i./acre (equivalent to 2.0-4.0 L of 24% SL formulation) in 200-300 L of water, as a spot application directly on Amarbail patches, taking extreme care to avoid contact with Neem foliage. This is a contact herbicide and will burn the parasitic weed.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the label instructions of the herbicide product carefully.
*   Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application.
*   Calibrate spray equipment accurately to ensure correct dosage.
*   Avoid spraying on windy days to prevent drift onto Neem plants.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension specialists for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions.
