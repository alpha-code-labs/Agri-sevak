Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I must first emphasize that Neem (Azadirachta indica) is renowned for its hardiness and adaptability, making it highly resilient to various environmental stresses, including nutrient deficiencies. Micronutrient deficiencies are *rarely observed* in Neem under typical growing conditions in Haryana.

However, in extreme cases of highly depleted, imbalanced, or specific soil conditions (e.g., very alkaline soils for iron, very sandy soils for boron), deficiencies can theoretically occur.

It is crucial to understand that visual symptoms alone are unreliable for diagnosing micronutrient deficiencies. A definitive diagnosis *must* be based on comprehensive soil and leaf tissue analysis conducted by a certified laboratory. Without such confirmation, applying micronutrients can be wasteful and potentially harmful.

If a deficiency is confirmed through proper diagnostic tests, the following scientifically verified measures, using CIBRC approved technical chemical names, can be considered:

### Addressing Micronutrient Deficiencies in Neem (If Confirmed)

#### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency
If a deficiency of Zinc is confirmed in Neem, the following measures can be adopted:
*   **Symptoms (rarely seen):** Small, narrow leaves (little leaf), interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins), stunted growth.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray a 0.5% solution of **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** (21% Zn) or a 0.3% solution of **Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate** (33% Zn).
        *   Mix 5 g of **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** per litre of water.
        *   Mix 3 g of **Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate** per litre of water.
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 15-day intervals, preferably in the morning or evening.
    *   **Soil Application (for established trees):** Apply 50-100 g of **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** or 25-50 g of **Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate** per tree, mixed with soil around the root zone, once a year.

#### 2. Iron (Fe) / Ferrous Deficiency
If a deficiency of Iron is confirmed in Neem, the following measures can be adopted:
*   **Symptoms (rarely seen, often pH-induced):** Severe interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, with veins remaining distinctly green.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray a 0.5-1.0% solution of **Ferrous Sulphate** (19% Fe) or a 0.1% solution of **Iron EDTA** (12% Fe).
        *   Mix 5-10 g of **Ferrous Sulphate** per litre of water.
        *   Mix 1 g of **Iron EDTA** per litre of water.
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals. Adding a few drops of a non-ionic surfactant can improve absorption.
    *   **Soil Application (for established trees):** Apply 50-200 g of **Ferrous Sulphate** or 10-50 g of **Iron EDTA** per tree, mixed with soil around the root zone, especially in acidic soils. For alkaline soils, foliar application is generally more effective.

#### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency
If a deficiency of Boron is confirmed in Neem, the following measures can be adopted:
*   **Symptoms (rarely seen):** Stunted growth, dieback of growing points, cracked stems, distorted or thickened leaves, poor flowering/fruiting.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray a 0.1-0.2% solution of **Borax** (Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate, 10.5% B) or a 0.05-0.1% solution of **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (20.5% B).
        *   Mix 1-2 g of **Borax** per litre of water.
        *   Mix 0.5-1 g of **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** per litre of water.
        *   Apply 1-2 sprays during active growth.
    *   **Soil Application (for established trees):** Apply 10-50 g of **Borax** or 5-25 g of **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** per tree, mixed with soil around the root zone, once a year. Boron can be toxic in excess, so precise application based on soil test is critical.

#### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency
If a deficiency of Calcium is confirmed in Neem, the following measures can be adopted:
*   **Symptoms (extremely rare):** Distorted new growth, tip burn of young leaves, stunted root development. Calcium is relatively immobile in the plant.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 200-500 g of **Calcium Nitrate** (18.8% Ca) or 1-2 kg of **Gypsum** (Calcium Sulphate, 23% Ca) per tree, mixed into the soil around the root zone. Foliar application is generally less effective due to poor mobility within the plant.

#### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency
If a deficiency of Magnesium is confirmed in Neem, the following measures can be adopted:
*   **Symptoms (rarely seen):** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, often starting from the leaf margins and progressing inwards, sometimes with reddish or purplish tints.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray a 0.5-1.0% solution of **Magnesium Sulphate** (Epsom Salt, 9.6% Mg).
        *   Mix 5-10 g of **Magnesium Sulphate** per litre of water.
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 15-day intervals.
    *   **Soil Application (for established trees):** Apply 50-200 g of **Magnesium Sulphate** per tree, mixed with soil around the root zone, once a year.

#### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency
If a deficiency of Manganese is confirmed in Neem, the following measures can be adopted:
*   **Symptoms (rarely seen):** Interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, often with a mottled or speckled appearance, sometimes leading to necrotic spots. Similar to iron deficiency but often more diffuse.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray a 0.2-0.5% solution of **Manganese Sulphate** (28-30% Mn).
        *   Mix 2-5 g of **Manganese Sulphate** per litre of water.
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals.
    *   **Soil Application (for established trees):** Apply 20-100 g of **Manganese Sulphate** per tree, mixed with soil around the root zone, once a year.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always ensure thorough mixing of chemicals in water.
*   Apply foliar sprays during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to prevent scorching and improve absorption.
*   Avoid applying micronutrients without a confirmed deficiency, as excessive application can lead to toxicity and harm the tree.
*   Maintain good soil health through organic matter addition and proper irrigation practices, as this often helps in nutrient availability.
