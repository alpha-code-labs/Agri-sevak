Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, I can provide you with the scientifically verified advice for Neem (Azadirachta indica) transplantation in Haryana.

Neem is a robust and valuable tree for our region, known for its medicinal, pesticidal, and environmental benefits. Proper transplantation is crucial for its successful establishment.

Here is the ideal transplantation time, distance, and process for Neem:

**1. Ideal Transplantation Time:**
The most suitable time for Neem transplantation in Haryana is during the monsoon season.
*   **July to August:** This period offers optimal conditions with sufficient rainfall, which aids in root establishment and reduces transplant shock. The cooler temperatures and higher humidity during monsoon are highly beneficial.
*   Alternatively, if assured irrigation is available, transplantation can also be done in **February to March** (late winter/early spring) before the onset of intense summer heat. However, monsoon planting is generally preferred for better survival rates.

**2. Transplantation Distance:**
The spacing for Neem depends on its intended purpose (e.g., agroforestry, avenue planting, block plantation). Given its large canopy at maturity, adequate spacing is essential.
*   **For general plantations or agroforestry systems:** A spacing of **5 meters x 5 meters** to **8 meters x 8 meters** is recommended.
    *   **5m x 5m:** Allows for a higher density, suitable for initial establishment, but may require thinning later or pruning to manage canopy.
    *   **6m x 6m to 8m x 8m:** Provides ample space for individual tree development, allowing for a well-developed canopy and root system without excessive competition.
*   **For avenue planting or boundary planting:** A wider spacing of **8 meters x 10 meters** or even **10 meters x 10 meters** can be adopted to allow for maximum canopy spread and aesthetic appeal.

**3. Transplantation Process:**
A meticulous approach to transplantation ensures high survival rates and vigorous growth.

*   **Sapling Selection:**
    *   Choose healthy, vigorous saplings, typically 6-12 months old, with a height of 30-60 cm.
    *   Ensure the saplings have a well-developed root system and are free from pests and diseases.

*   **Pit Preparation:**
    *   Dig pits well in advance, ideally 15-30 days before planting, to allow the soil to weather and aerate.
    *   The recommended pit size is **45 cm x 45 cm x 45 cm** to **60 cm x 60 cm x 60 cm**.
    *   Separate the topsoil from the subsoil.
    *   Mix the excavated topsoil with well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost at a ratio of 1:1 or 2:1 (soil:FYM). Approximately 5-10 kg of FYM per pit is beneficial.
    *   If the soil is heavy clay, adding some sand can improve drainage. If the soil is very sandy, adding more organic matter will improve water retention.
    *   Refill the pits with this enriched soil mixture, forming a small mound slightly above ground level to account for settling.

*   **Planting:**
    *   On the day of planting, carefully make a hole in the center of the refilled pit, large enough to accommodate the root ball of the sapling.
    *   Gently remove the sapling from its polybag or nursery pot, taking care not to disturb the root ball.
    *   Place the sapling in the center of the pit, ensuring that the root collar (the point where the stem meets the roots) is at ground level. Do not plant too deep or too shallow.
    *   Backfill the remaining space with the prepared soil mixture, gently firming the soil around the base of the sapling to remove any air pockets.
    *   Create a small saucer-shaped basin around the plant to facilitate water retention.

*   **Post-Transplantation Care:**
    *   **Immediate Watering:** Water the sapling thoroughly immediately after planting, even if it's raining, to settle the soil around the roots.
    *   **Staking:** If the sapling is tall or planted in a windy area, provide support with a sturdy stake to prevent it from bending or breaking.
    *   **Protection:** Protect young saplings from livestock grazing, rodents, and other pests by using tree guards or fencing.
    *   **Weeding:** Keep the area around the sapling free of weeds, especially during the initial establishment phase, to reduce competition for water and nutrients.
    *   **Irrigation:** Provide regular irrigation during dry periods, especially during the first 1-2 years, until the tree is well-established. Neem is drought-tolerant once mature, but young plants need consistent moisture.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** While not strictly necessary immediately, a light application of well-decomposed FYM or compost can be given annually around the base of the tree to promote healthy growth.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure the successful establishment and healthy growth of Neem trees in Haryana.
