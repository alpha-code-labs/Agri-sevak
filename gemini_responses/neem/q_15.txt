Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing pests on Neem trees in Haryana.

It's important to understand the specific pests and their interaction with Neem, which is itself known for its insecticidal properties.

Here's how to address your concerns:

1.  **Grasshopper:**
    Grasshoppers are polyphagous feeders and can occasionally cause defoliation, especially on young Neem trees or during severe outbreaks.
    *   **Cultural Control:** For minor infestations, hand-picking and destroying grasshoppers can be effective.
    *   **Chemical Control (if infestation is severe):**
        *   Spray with **Malathion** 50% EC at 2 ml per litre of water.
        *   Alternatively, spray with **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 0.5 ml per litre of water.

2.  **Painted bug (Bagrada hilaris):**
    This is not known to affect Neem. Painted bugs are primarily pests of cruciferous crops like mustard, cabbage, and radish.

3.  **Red cotton bug (Dysdercus cingulatus):**
    This is not known to affect Neem. Red cotton bugs are primarily pests of cotton and other malvaceous plants.

4.  **Black ants:**
    Black ants are generally not direct pests of Neem trees. Their presence on trees is often an indication of other underlying issues:
    *   **Honeydew-producing pests:** Ants are commonly found on trees where sap-sucking insects like aphids, mealybugs, or scale insects are present. The ants feed on the honeydew secreted by these pests and, in return, protect them from natural enemies.
    *   **Nesting:** Ants may nest in hollows or cracks in the tree bark.
    *   **Foraging:** They might be foraging for other food sources.

    **Control Strategy for Black Ants:**
    *   **Identify the primary issue:** If ants are present due to honeydew, the most effective control is to manage the sap-sucking pests.
        *   For sap-sucking pests, apply a soil drench around the base of the tree with **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL at 0.5-1 ml per litre of water (quantity depending on tree size and age, consult local guidelines for specific dosage per tree). This systemic insecticide will be absorbed by the tree and control the sap-sucking insects, thereby removing the ants' food source.
    *   **Direct Ant Control (if nesting or causing nuisance):**
        *   Apply a drench around the base of the tree or directly into visible ant nests with **Fipronil** 5% SC at 1-2 ml per litre of water.
        *   Alternatively, drench the base of the tree or ant nests with **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 2.5 ml per litre of water.

Always ensure proper safety measures, wear protective gear, and follow the instructions on the product label when using any chemical pesticides. For specific local recommendations or severe infestations, please consult your nearest Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or agricultural extension officer.
