As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, I recommend the following fertilizer doses for Neem (Azadirachta indica) trees in Haryana. Please note that these are general recommendations, and a soil test is highly recommended for precise nutrient management tailored to your specific field conditions and tree age.

**General NPK Recommendation for Neem (per tree per year):**
*   **Young Trees (1-3 years):** 50-100 g Nitrogen (N), 25-50 g Phosphorus (P2O5), 25-50 g Potassium (K2O).
*   **Mature Trees (>3 years):** 200-500 g Nitrogen (N), 100-250 g Phosphorus (P2O5), 100-250 g Potassium (K2O).

**Specific Fertilizer Recommendations (per tree per year):**

*   **Urea (46% N):**
    *   For young trees (1-3 years): 100-200 g
    *   For mature trees (>3 years): 400-1000 g
    *   *Application:* Apply in 2-3 split doses, especially during active growth periods (e.g., pre-monsoon and post-monsoon).

*   **Nano-Urea (Liquid, 4% N):**
    *   For foliar application: 2-4 ml per litre of water.
    *   Spray to cover the foliage thoroughly. Typically, 2-3 sprays can be given during the active growth phase.
    *   *Note:* This is a supplementary source of N and does not fully replace granular Urea.

*   **DAP (Di-Ammonium Phosphate, 18% N, 46% P2O5):**
    *   For young trees (1-3 years): 50-100 g
    *   For mature trees (>3 years): 200-500 g
    *   *Application:* Apply as a basal dose, preferably at the beginning of the growing season.

*   **Nano-DAP (Liquid, 8% N, 16% P2O5):**
    *   For foliar application: 2-4 ml per litre of water.
    *   Spray to cover the foliage thoroughly. Typically, 2-3 sprays can be given during the active growth phase.
    *   *Note:* This is a supplementary source of N and P and does not fully replace granular DAP.

*   **NPK (Complex Fertilizers, e.g., 19:19:19, 12:32:16, 10:26:26):**
    *   The dose depends on the specific NPK grade and the nutrient requirement.
    *   As a general guideline:
        *   For young trees (1-3 years): 100-250 g of a balanced NPK (e.g., 19:19:19).
        *   For mature trees (>3 years): 300-700 g of a suitable NPK grade.
    *   *Application:* Apply as a basal dose, preferably at the beginning of the growing season.

*   **SSP (Single Super Phosphate, 16% P2O5, 11% S):**
    *   For young trees (1-3 years): 150-300 g
    *   For mature trees (>3 years): 600-1500 g
    *   *Application:* Apply as a basal dose. SSP also provides Sulphur.

*   **Potash (Muriate of Potash - MOP, 60% K2O):**
    *   For young trees (1-3 years): 40-80 g
    *   For mature trees (>3 years): 170-420 g
    *   *Application:* Apply as a basal dose, preferably at the beginning of the growing season.

*   **Sulphur (Elemental Sulphur, 90% S):**
    *   If soil test indicates Sulphur deficiency and SSP/DAP are not providing enough:
        *   For young trees (1-3 years): 20-50 g
        *   For mature trees (>3 years): 50-150 g
    *   *Application:* Apply as a basal dose.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Soil Testing:** Always conduct a soil test to determine the exact nutrient status of your soil and tailor fertilizer recommendations accordingly.
*   **Application Method:** Granular fertilizers should be applied in a ring around the tree, 30-60 cm away from the trunk, within the drip line, and lightly incorporated into the soil, followed by irrigation. Nano-fertilizers are for foliar spray.
*   **Organic Matter:** Incorporating well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost (5-10 kg for young trees, 20-50 kg for mature trees per year) significantly improves soil health and nutrient availability, reducing the need for chemical fertilizers.
