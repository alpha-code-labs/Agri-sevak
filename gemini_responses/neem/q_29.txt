This is not known to affect Neem.

Neem (Azadirachta indica) naturally sheds a significant number of its flowers and immature fruits as a normal physiological process to regulate its fruit load and conserve energy. This is a common occurrence in many tree species and is generally not considered a problematic condition requiring intervention in Neem.

The term "Tinda/Boll dropping" is typically used for crops like cucurbits or cotton and is not applicable to Neem, which produces drupes (fruits).

While severe environmental stresses such as prolonged drought or extreme temperatures can lead to an increase in fruit drop, these are managed by addressing the underlying stress factors (e.g., providing adequate irrigation during dry periods) rather than through specific chemical applications to prevent the drop itself. Neem is a hardy tree and is not commonly affected by specific diseases or pests that cause widespread, problematic flower or fruit drop requiring chemical control in Haryana.
