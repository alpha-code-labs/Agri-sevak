As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified recommendations for seed and soil treatment processes for Neem (Azadirachta indica) in Haryana. While Neem is generally a hardy tree, young seedlings are susceptible to common nursery diseases like damping-off and root rot, and soil-borne pests. Therefore, prophylactic treatments are advisable for successful establishment.

### Recommended Seed Treatment for Neem

The primary goal of seed treatment for Neem is to protect germinating seeds and young seedlings from seed-borne and soil-borne pathogens, particularly those causing damping-off and root rot.

1.  **Biological Seed Treatment (Preferred):**
    *   Treat Neem seeds with a biofungicide to enhance germination and protect against fungal diseases.
    *   **Process:** Mix the seeds thoroughly with the biological agent before sowing.
    *   **Recommended Agents & Dosages:**
        *   **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum**: 5-10 g per kg of seed.
        *   **Pseudomonas fluorescens**: 10 g per kg of seed.

2.  **Chemical Seed Treatment (If biological agents are not available or disease pressure is high):**
    *   **Process:** Mix the seeds thoroughly with the fungicide before sowing. Ensure even coating.
    *   **Recommended Agents & Dosages:**
        *   **Thiram**: 2-3 g per kg of seed.
        *   **Carbendazim**: 1-2 g per kg of seed.
        *   **Captan**: 2.5 g per kg of seed.

### Recommended Soil Treatment for Neem

Soil treatment is crucial for nursery beds or planting pits to create a healthy environment for Neem seedlings, protecting them from soil-borne diseases, nematodes, and pests like termites.

1.  **Biological Soil Treatment (Preferred):**
    *   Incorporate bio-agents into the soil of nursery beds or planting pits to suppress pathogens and promote plant growth.
    *   **Process:** Mix the biological agent with well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost (approximately 50-100 kg) and apply it to the soil before sowing or planting.
    *   **Recommended Agents & Dosages:**
        *   **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum**: 2.5 kg per acre (for nursery beds) or 25-50 g per planting pit.
        *   **Pseudomonas fluorescens**: 2.5 kg per acre (for nursery beds) or 25-50 g per planting pit.
        *   **Purpureocillium lilacinum** (for nematode management): 2.5 kg per acre (for nursery beds) or 25-50 g per planting pit.
        *   **Metarhizium anisopliae** (for soil insect pests like termites): 2.5 kg per acre (for nursery beds) or 25-50 g per planting pit.

2.  **Chemical Soil Treatment (For specific severe issues like termites or persistent root rot):**
    *   **For Termite Control (Pre-planting in pits):**
        *   **Process:** Drench the planting pit soil thoroughly with the insecticide solution.
        *   **Recommended Agent & Dosage:**
            *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: 2.5 ml per litre of water, drenching 2-3 litres of solution per pit.
    *   **For Root Rot Control (in nursery beds or around young plants):**
        *   **Process:** Drench the soil around the base of the seedlings with the fungicide solution.
        *   **Recommended Agents & Dosages:**
            *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: 1-2 g per litre of water, drenching as needed.
            *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride** 72.2% SL: 2-3 ml per litre of water, drenching as needed.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions when handling any chemical or biological agents.
*   Ensure proper soil drainage in nursery beds to prevent waterlogging, which exacerbates damping-off and root rot.
*   Use healthy, fresh Neem seeds for better germination and seedling vigor.
*   Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approaches, combining biological, cultural, and judicious chemical methods, are always recommended for sustainable agriculture.
