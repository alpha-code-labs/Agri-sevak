As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified information regarding the suitable climate, soil type, and drainage requirements for Neem (Azadirachta indica) in Haryana:

**Climate:**
*   **Temperature:** Neem thrives in hot, tropical to sub-tropical climates. It prefers temperatures ranging from 21°C to 32°C but can tolerate very high temperatures, often exceeding 40°C, which is common in Haryana's summers. Young plants are sensitive to frost, but mature trees can withstand mild frost.
*   **Rainfall:** It is well-adapted to arid and semi-arid regions. An annual rainfall of 400 mm to 1200 mm is ideal, but it can survive in areas with as little as 250 mm of rainfall due to its drought-tolerant nature.
*   **Sunlight:** Neem requires full sun exposure for optimal growth and development.

**Soil Type:**
*   **Adaptability:** Neem is highly adaptable and can grow in a wide range of soil types, including poor, degraded, and marginal lands.
*   **Texture:** It prefers well-drained sandy to loamy soils. It can also grow in shallow, stony soils and is known to tolerate slightly saline and alkaline conditions, which are sometimes found in parts of Haryana.
*   **pH:** The ideal soil pH range for Neem is between 6.5 and 8.5, though it can tolerate more alkaline conditions up to pH 10.

**Drainage Requirement:**
*   **Drainage:** Excellent drainage is crucial for Neem. It is highly sensitive to waterlogging, and prolonged standing water can lead to root rot and ultimately tree death. Therefore, sites with good subsurface drainage are essential for successful Neem cultivation.
