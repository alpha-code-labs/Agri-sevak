As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for managing pests in Neem (Azadirachta indica) in Haryana.

It is important to note that Neem trees possess natural insecticidal properties, making them less susceptible to many common pests. However, some specific pests can still affect them.

1.  **Borers (e.g., Stem Borers, Bark Eating Caterpillars):**
    These pests can cause significant damage by tunneling into the stem or feeding under the bark, leading to weakening or even death of the tree, especially young ones.

    *   **Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
        *   Regularly inspect trees for signs of borer activity (frass, boreholes, wilting branches).
        *   Prune and destroy severely infested branches.
        *   For bark-eating caterpillars, clean the boreholes to remove frass and larvae.
    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   For bark-eating caterpillars, after cleaning the boreholes, inject a solution of:
            *   **Chlorpyrifos** 50% EC at 5 ml/L of water into the boreholes and plug with mud.

2.  **Caterpillars (Defoliators):**
    Various defoliating caterpillars can feed on Neem leaves, especially during certain seasons.

    *   **Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
        *   Hand-picking and destroying visible larvae on young trees.
        *   Promote natural enemies like parasitic wasps and predatory birds.
    *   **Biological Control:**
        *   Apply formulations of **Bacillus thuringiensis** var. *kurstaki* (Bt) at 1-2 g/L of water, targeting young larvae. This is a safe and effective biological option.
    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   For severe infestations, especially of young larvae, consider spraying with:
            *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG at 0.2 g/L of water.
            *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC at 0.2 ml/L of water.
            *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 0.5 ml/L of water.

3.  **Diamondback Moth (DBM):**
    This is not known to affect Neem. Diamondback moth (*Plutella xylostella*) is a specific pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower, mustard) and does not infest Neem trees.

4.  **Leaf Folder:**
    This is not known to affect Neem. Specific leaf folder pests are typically host-specific to other crops and are not recognized as significant pests of Neem.
