As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding Neem (Azadirachta indica) maturity, harvesting, and cutting process for fruit collection in Haryana.

### Maturity Signs for Neem Fruits

The maturity of Neem fruits (drupes) is indicated by several visual and tactile cues:

*   **Color Change:** The most prominent sign is the change in fruit color. Immature fruits are dark green. As they mature, they turn yellowish-green, eventually becoming fully **yellow or golden-yellow**.
*   **Softening:** Ripe fruits become soft to the touch, losing their firm texture.
*   **Natural Shedding:** Fully mature fruits naturally detach from the tree and fall to the ground. This is a strong indicator that the fruits are ready for harvest.
*   **Pulp Sweetness:** The fleshy pulp surrounding the seed develops a sweetish taste when ripe, though this is less commonly used as a primary harvesting indicator.

### Harvesting Time for Neem

*   In Haryana, the peak harvesting season for Neem fruits typically occurs during the **summer months**.
*   The main period for fruit collection is generally from **May to July**, with **June and early July** being the most productive time.
*   Neem trees usually bear fruit once a year. The harvesting window can extend over several weeks as fruits ripen progressively on the tree.

### Cutting Process (Harvesting of Fruits) for Neem

The "cutting process" in the context of harvesting refers to the methods used to collect the mature fruits. Pruning (actual cutting of branches) is a separate horticultural practice. For fruit harvesting:

*   **Manual Collection:** Neem fruits are primarily harvested manually.
    *   **Hand-picking:** For smaller trees or lower branches, ripe fruits can be hand-picked directly from the tree.
    *   **Shaking Branches:** For taller trees or higher branches, long poles can be used to gently shake the branches. This causes the mature fruits to fall onto a clean sheet, tarpaulin, or net spread beneath the tree.
    *   **Collection from Ground:** A significant portion of the harvest often comes from collecting naturally fallen ripe fruits from the ground. It is crucial to ensure the ground is clean and free from debris to prevent contamination.
    *   **Using Tools:** For very tall trees, specialized long poles equipped with hooks or nets may be employed to reach and detach clusters of ripe fruits.
*   **Frequency:** Harvesting is not a one-time event but is carried out periodically over the 2-3 month season as fruits ripen in batches. This ensures that only fully mature fruits are collected.
*   **Post-Harvest Handling (Briefly):** After collection, it is essential to process the fruits quickly. This involves depulping (removing the fleshy pericarp), washing, and then drying the seeds in shade to preserve their viability and the integrity of active compounds.
