As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Neem (Azadirachta indica) in Haryana:

Firstly, it is important to clarify which of the mentioned conditions are known to affect Neem:

*   **Blast:** This is not known to affect Neem.
*   **Brown spot:** This is not known to affect Neem.
*   **Downy mildew:** This is not known to affect Neem.
*   **Grey mildew:** This is not known to affect Neem.

For the fungal diseases that are known to affect Neem, namely Alternaria (causing leaf spot/blight), Anthracnose (causing leaf spot/dieback), and Powdery mildew, the following integrated control measures are recommended:

---

### 1. For Alternaria (Leaf Spot/Blight) and Anthracnose (Leaf Spot/Dieback)

These diseases typically manifest as irregular brown to black spots on leaves, often leading to blight or dieback of twigs and branches.

**Cultural Practices:**
*   Regularly prune and destroy infected branches, twigs, and fallen leaves to reduce the source of inoculum.
*   Ensure proper tree spacing and pruning to improve air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce humidity and disease spread.

**Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
Apply fungicides preventively or at the first sign of disease symptoms. Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.
*   **Mancozeb** 75% WP at 2.5 g/L of water.
*   **Chlorothalonil** 75% WP at 2 g/L of water.
*   **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 1 g/L of water.
*   **Propiconazole** 25% EC at 1 ml/L of water.
*   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC at 0.5 ml/L of water.
*   For severe infections, a combination product like **Carbendazim 12% + Mancozeb 63% WP** at 2 g/L of water can be used.

### 2. For Powdery Mildew

This disease appears as white, powdery patches on the surface of leaves, young stems, and sometimes flowers, leading to distortion and reduced photosynthesis.

**Cultural Practices:**
*   Prune heavily infected leaves and shoots to reduce the disease load.
*   Improve air circulation around the tree by selective pruning.

**Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
Apply fungicides at the first appearance of white powdery patches.
*   **Sulphur** 80% WP (Wettable Sulphur) at 2 g/L of water.
*   **Hexaconazole** 5% SC at 1 ml/L of water.
*   **Myclobutanil** 10% WP at 0.5 g/L of water.
*   **Difenoconazole** 25% EC at 0.5 ml/L of water.

**General Recommendations for Chemical Application:**
*   Always read and strictly follow the instructions and safety precautions provided on the fungicide label.
*   Ensure complete and uniform coverage of the plant parts, especially the undersides of leaves.
*   Repeat applications at 10-15 day intervals, depending on disease severity and prevailing weather conditions, until the disease is under control.
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of fungicide resistance in the pathogen population.
