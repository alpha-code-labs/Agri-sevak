This is not known to affect Neem.

Neem (Azadirachta indica) is well-known for its natural insecticidal and repellent properties due to compounds like azadirachtin. It is generally highly resistant to most insect pests, including beetles, weevils, and sawflies, which typically do not cause significant damage to healthy neem trees. In fact, neem extracts are widely used as biopesticides to control these very pests in other crops.
