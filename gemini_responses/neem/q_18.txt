As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the use of Growth Regulators/Hormones in Neem for Haryana:

1.  **Ethrel (Ethephon):**
    The application of **Ethephon** as a growth regulator for Neem is not a standard practice in Haryana and is not known to provide beneficial effects for Neem cultivation. Therefore, no recommended dose is available.

2.  **2,4-D (2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid):**
    The application of **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid** as a growth regulator for Neem is not recommended due to its herbicidal properties and potential phytotoxicity. It is not known to be safely or beneficially used on Neem for growth regulation in Haryana. Therefore, no recommended dose is available.

3.  **Boron:**
    Boron is an essential micronutrient. Its application is recommended only when a deficiency is diagnosed through soil or tissue analysis. There are no general recommendations for routine application to healthy Neem trees without a diagnosed deficiency. If a deficiency is confirmed, the following foliar application can be considered:
    *   **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (20% Boron): 1.0 - 1.5 g/L of water. Apply as a foliar spray during active growth or before flowering, ensuring complete coverage.
