As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned conditions in Neem (Azadirachta indica) in Haryana:

1.  **Fruit bursting in Neem:**
    This is not known to affect Neem. Neem fruits are drupes and are not typically prone to bursting or cracking as observed in some fleshy horticultural fruits.

2.  **Hardness in fruit in Neem:**
    This is not known to affect Neem. Neem fruits are primarily valued for their seeds (for oil extraction) and medicinal properties, not for their pulp texture for direct consumption. "Hardness" is not a commonly reported physiological disorder for Neem fruits.

3.  **Leaf burning/melting in Neem:**
    Leaf burning or scorching in Neem can occur, especially in young plants or under severe environmental stress. "Melting" is a less common term but implies severe tissue collapse. This is primarily a symptom of abiotic stress or chemical phytotoxicity.

    **Causes:**
    *   **Environmental Stress:** Extreme heat, severe drought, waterlogging (leading to root damage), strong desiccating winds, or sudden temperature fluctuations.
    *   **Chemical Phytotoxicity:** Over-application of fertilizers, herbicides, or certain pesticides, leading to chemical burn on foliage.

    **Control Measures:**

    **A. Cultural and Agronomic Practices (Primary for Physical Damage):**
    *   **Water Management:**
        *   Ensure adequate and timely irrigation, especially during dry spells and for young trees, to prevent drought stress.
        *   Improve soil drainage in areas prone to waterlogging to prevent root asphyxiation, which can lead to leaf scorching.
    *   **Shade and Protection:**
        *   For young saplings, provide temporary shade during the peak summer months to protect them from intense sun and heat.
        *   Establish windbreaks in areas exposed to strong, dry winds to reduce desiccation.
    *   **Soil Health:**
        *   Apply organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves, wood chips) around the base of the tree to conserve soil moisture, regulate soil temperature, and reduce weed competition.
        *   Incorporate organic matter into the soil to improve its structure, water-holding capacity, and nutrient availability.
    *   **Nutrient Management:**
        *   Conduct soil testing to determine nutrient status and apply fertilizers based on recommendations. Avoid excessive application of nitrogen, which can make plants more susceptible to stress.
    *   **Chemical Application Practices:**
        *   Always use recommended dosages of fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides.
        *   Avoid spraying chemicals during the hottest part of the day or when plants are under severe water stress, as this increases the risk of phytotoxicity.

    **B. Chemical Management (for Stress Mitigation and Recovery):**
    While physical damage is best prevented through cultural practices, certain CIBRC approved chemicals can help plants cope with and recover from stress.

    *   **For improving stress tolerance and recovery:**
        *   **Potassium nitrate:** Apply as a foliar spray at 5-10 g/L of water during periods of anticipated stress or for recovery. Potassium helps improve water use efficiency and overall plant resilience.
        *   **Amino acid based formulations:** Apply as a foliar spray at 1-2 ml/L or 1-2 g/L of water. Amino acids act as biostimulants, helping plants recover from various stresses and promoting growth.
    *   **For improving soil health and nutrient uptake (indirectly reducing stress):**
        *   **Humic acid:** Apply as a soil drench at 5-10 ml/L of water or 1-2 kg/acre mixed with irrigation water. Humic acid improves soil structure, nutrient availability, and root development, making plants more robust against environmental stresses.
