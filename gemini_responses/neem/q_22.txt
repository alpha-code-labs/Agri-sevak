As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified cultivation practices for Neem (Azadirachta indica) in Haryana:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   Neem is primarily propagated through fresh seeds. Due to the recalcitrant nature of Neem seeds (they lose viability very quickly), they must be sown immediately after collection, ideally within 1-2 weeks.
    *   **Nursery Raising and Transplanting:** This is the most recommended and reliable method for better establishment and higher survival rates in the field. Seeds are sown in polybags (e.g., 15 cm x 25 cm size) or raised nursery beds. Seedlings of 3-6 months old, typically 30-60 cm in height, are then carefully transplanted to the main field, usually at the onset of the monsoon season.
    *   **Direct Sowing:** While possible, it is generally less reliable due to variable germination rates and the vulnerability of young seedlings to adverse environmental conditions. If direct sowing is chosen, ensure adequate soil moisture and protection for the emerging seedlings.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   **For Seeds (in nursery or direct sowing):** Sow Neem seeds at a depth of 1.5 cm to 2.5 cm. Deeper sowing can hinder germination.
    *   **For Seedlings (transplanting):** When transplanting, ensure the seedling's root collar (the point where the stem meets the roots) is at the same level as the ground, and the entire root ball is well covered with soil.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   The optimal spacing for Neem depends on the purpose of cultivation (e.g., pure plantation, agroforestry, boundary planting).
    *   **Pure Plantation:** For dedicated Neem plantations, a common spacing is **5 meters x 5 meters** or **6 meters x 6 meters**. This allows for good canopy development, adequate light penetration, and ease of management.
    *   **Agroforestry/Boundary Planting:** If Neem is integrated into an agroforestry system or planted along field boundaries, wider spacing such as **8 meters x 8 meters** or **10 meters x 10 meters** may be adopted to accommodate intercropping or other tree species.

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   Neem seeds have low viability and should be sown fresh. The number of seeds per kilogram varies, typically ranging from 4000 to 5000 seeds/kg.
    *   **For Nursery Raising:** To obtain a sufficient number of seedlings for planting (e.g., approximately 400 plants per acre or 1000 plants per hectare at 5m x 5m spacing), you would need to sow a higher quantity of seeds in the nursery. A general recommendation is to sow **2-3 fresh seeds per polybag or per spot** in a nursery bed to ensure at least one healthy seedling establishes.
    *   **For Direct Sowing:** If direct sowing is chosen, sow **2-3 fresh seeds per pit** to account for potential germination failures, and then thin out to one healthy seedling once established. The total seed requirement per hectare would be significantly higher than for nursery raising due to lower field germination rates and higher mortality.
