As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding sucking pests on Neem:

Aphids, Leafhopper, Whitefly, and Thrips are generally not known to cause significant damage to Neem (Azadirachta indica) trees. Neem is renowned for its natural insecticidal properties, and its compounds (like azadirachtin) act as feeding deterrents and growth regulators for a wide range of insect pests. Therefore, these sucking pests rarely establish populations that require intervention on Neem.

However, Neem Psylla (*Cacopsylla indica*) is a specific pest of Neem, particularly affecting young plants and nurseries, causing gall formation and defoliation. If infestation is severe, especially in nurseries or young plantations, control measures may be considered.

**Control Measures for Neem Psylla (*Cacopsylla indica*)**

1.  **Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
    *   **Pruning:** Regularly inspect young plants and prune off infested twigs showing galls. Collect and destroy the pruned material to prevent further spread.
    *   **Monitoring:** Regularly monitor young plants and nursery stock for early signs of psylla infestation.

2.  **Chemical Control (for severe infestations in nurseries or young plants):**
    When chemical intervention is deemed necessary, especially for young plants or nursery stock, the following CIBRC approved insecticides can be used:

    *   **Systemic Insecticides:** These are effective as they are absorbed by the plant and move through its tissues, killing pests that feed on the sap.
        *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at a concentration of 0.5 - 1.0 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at a concentration of 0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water.
        *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply at a concentration of 0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water.

    *   **Insect Growth Regulators (IGR):** These disrupt the growth and development of insect nymphs.
        *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at a concentration of 1.0 - 1.25 ml per litre of water, particularly effective against nymphs.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always ensure thorough coverage of the plant, especially the undersides of leaves where pests often reside.
*   Follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions strictly.
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
*   For mature Neem trees, chemical intervention is rarely required due to their inherent resistance and the tree's large size making application challenging. Focus on cultural practices.
