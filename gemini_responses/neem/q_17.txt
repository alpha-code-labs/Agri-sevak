As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following doses of organic manures for Neem (Azadirachta indica) trees to promote healthy growth and soil fertility under Haryana conditions:

*   **Farm Yard Manure (FYM):**
    *   For young trees (1-3 years old): 5-10 kg per tree annually.
    *   For mature trees (>3 years old): 15-25 kg per tree annually.
    *   *Application:* Apply the FYM evenly around the root zone (drip line) of the tree, preferably before the monsoon season (June-July) or during autumn (September-October), and lightly incorporate it into the topsoil.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   For young trees (1-3 years old): 1-2 kg per tree annually.
    *   For mature trees (>3 years old): 3-5 kg per tree annually.
    *   *Application:* Apply vermicompost around the root zone, similar to FYM. Due to its higher nutrient concentration, it can be applied in split doses (e.g., half before monsoon and half post-monsoon) for sustained benefit.

*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract based Plant Growth Promoter):**
    *   For soil application: 50-100 g per tree, mixed with FYM or soil, applied once or twice a year (e.g., pre-monsoon and post-monsoon).
    *   *Application:* Mix the recommended quantity with soil or other organic manures and apply uniformly around the tree's root zone. Ensure proper irrigation after application.
