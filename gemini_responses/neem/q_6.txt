This is not known to affect Neem.

Neem (Azadirachta indica) is generally known for its robust health and resistance to a wide range of pests and diseases, including viral infections. While some general symptoms like leaf curling or yellowing can occur due to nutrient deficiencies, environmental stress, or insect infestations (which can sometimes be mistaken for viral diseases), the specific viral diseases mentioned (Leaf curl, Mosaic, Yellow vein clearing, Stripe, Tristeza, and Stunt virus) are not recognized as significant or common pathogens affecting Neem trees.
