As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for improving yield, fruit quality, and storage life of Neem (Azadirachta indica) in Haryana.

**I. Improving Yield:**

1.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Soil Testing:** This is the foundational step. Conduct regular soil tests to determine nutrient deficiencies and soil pH. This allows for precise fertilizer application.
    *   **Organic Manures:** Incorporate well-decomposed Farmyard Manure (FYM) or compost at 10-20 kg per tree annually, especially before the monsoon. This improves soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability.
    *   **Balanced Fertilization:** Based on soil test results, apply inorganic fertilizers. For mature trees (5+ years), a general recommendation in the absence of soil test data is:
        *   Nitrogen (N): 100-200 g per tree per year, applied in two splits (pre-monsoon and post-monsoon).
        *   Phosphorus (P2O5): 50-100 g per tree per year, applied pre-monsoon.
        *   Potassium (K2O): 50-100 g per tree per year, applied pre-monsoon.
    *   **Micronutrients:** If soil tests indicate deficiencies, foliar application of micronutrient mixtures containing Zinc, Boron, and Manganese can be beneficial, especially during flowering.

2.  **Water Management:**
    *   Neem is highly drought-tolerant once established, but supplemental irrigation during critical stages significantly boosts yield.
    *   Provide irrigation during prolonged dry spells, particularly during flowering (March-April) and fruit development (May-June).
    *   Ensure proper drainage to prevent waterlogging, which can harm root health.

3.  **Pruning and Canopy Management:**
    *   Perform light pruning to remove dead, diseased, or crossing branches. This improves air circulation and light penetration within the canopy, promoting healthier growth and better fruiting.
    *   Avoid heavy pruning, which can reduce the fruiting area and stress the tree.

4.  **Pest and Disease Management:**
    *   Neem is remarkably resistant to most pests and diseases. Significant yield losses due to these factors are uncommon in mature trees.
    *   For any specific issues observed, consult HAU experts for targeted advice.

**II. Improving Fruit Quality:**

1.  **Optimal Nutrition:**
    *   Adequate Phosphorus and Potassium are crucial for good fruit set, size, and the desired oil content in seeds.
    *   Micronutrients like Boron play a vital role in fruit development and overall quality. Ensure these are not deficient.

2.  **Timely Harvesting:**
    *   Harvest fruits when they are fully mature, typically indicated by their color changing from green to yellow. Harvesting immature fruits will result in lower oil content and poor seed viability.
    *   Harvesting should be done carefully to avoid physical damage to the fruits, which can lead to spoilage.

**III. Improving Storage Life (for Neem Fruits/Seeds):**

The storage life of Neem seeds is inherently short due to their recalcitrant nature. Proper post-harvest handling is critical to maintain viability and quality for oil extraction or planting.

1.  **Harvesting:**
    *   Collect only healthy, fully mature, and undamaged fruits. Avoid fallen or diseased fruits, as they can introduce pathogens.

2.  **Immediate Processing (Depulping and Washing):**
    *   Neem fruits must be depulped immediately (within 24-48 hours) after harvest. The fleshy pulp contains inhibitors and high moisture that rapidly reduce seed viability.
    *   **Depulping:** Manually remove the pulp or use a mechanical depulper.
    *   **Washing:** Thoroughly wash the depulped seeds in clean water to remove all traces of pulp.

3.  **Drying:**
    *   This is the most critical step. Seeds must be dried to a moisture content of 5-8% for safe storage.
    *   **Sun Drying (Shade Drying):** Spread the washed seeds in a thin layer (not more than 1-2 cm thick) on clean tarpaulins or concrete surfaces in a well-ventilated area, preferably under partial shade. Avoid direct harsh sunlight, which can damage the seeds and reduce viability.
    *   **Turning:** Turn the seeds frequently (every 2-3 hours) to ensure uniform drying and prevent fungal growth.
    *   **Mechanical Drying:** If available, use mechanical dryers with controlled temperatures, ensuring the temperature does not exceed 40-45°C.

4.  **Storage Conditions:**
    *   **Cool and Dry Environment:** Store dried seeds in a cool (ideally below 20°C), dry place with low humidity.
    *   **Airtight Containers:** Use airtight containers such as thick plastic bags, metal bins, or multi-layered laminated bags to prevent moisture re-absorption and pest infestation.
    *   **Pest Control:**
        *   Ensure seeds are thoroughly dry before storage, as moisture promotes pest and fungal growth.
        *   Regularly inspect stored seeds for any signs of insect infestation or fungal growth.
        *   For large-scale storage, if pest infestation becomes an issue, consult HAU experts for advice on CIBRC-approved fumigants. For example, **Phosphine** (generated from Aluminium phosphide or Magnesium phosphide) can be used, but its application requires specific training and must be carried out by trained personnel under strict safety protocols. However, proper drying and airtight storage are usually sufficient to prevent most storage pest issues for Neem seeds.

By implementing these practices, farmers can significantly enhance the productivity, quality, and post-harvest longevity of their Neem produce in Haryana.
