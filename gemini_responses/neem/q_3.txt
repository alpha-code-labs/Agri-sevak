As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding rot control in Neem (Azadirachta indica) for Haryana.

Neem is generally known for its robust nature and resistance to many diseases. However, certain rot conditions can affect it, particularly during the seedling stage or under specific environmental stresses.

**Conditions Known to Affect Neem:**

1.  **Seedling Rot (Damping-off):** This is the most common and significant rot issue in Neem, primarily affecting young seedlings in nurseries.
    *   **Symptoms:** Seedlings collapse at the soil line, often appearing water-soaked and discolored.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   **Cultural Practices:**
            *   Use sterilized potting mix or nursery soil.
            *   Ensure excellent drainage in nursery beds and containers.
            *   Avoid overwatering; maintain consistent, moderate moisture.
            *   Provide adequate spacing between seedlings for good air circulation.
            *   Sow seeds at the recommended depth.
        *   **Chemical Control:**
            *   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds before sowing with:
                *   **Thiram** @ 2-3 g/kg seed
                *   **Captan** @ 2-3 g/kg seed
                *   **Carbendazim** @ 1-2 g/kg seed
                *   **Trichoderma viride** (bio-fungicide) @ 4-5 g/kg seed
            *   **Soil Drench (for affected nursery beds):**
                *   **Propamocarb Hydrochloride** @ 2-3 ml/L water
                *   **Metalaxyl** @ 1-2 g/L water
                *   **Carbendazim** @ 1-2 g/L water

2.  **Root Rot and Collar Rot:** While mature Neem trees are generally resistant, these can occur in waterlogged conditions or in stressed trees.
    *   **Symptoms:** Yellowing and wilting of leaves, stunted growth, decay of roots or bark at the soil line.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   **Cultural Practices:**
            *   Ensure planting sites have excellent soil drainage. Avoid areas prone to waterlogging.
            *   Avoid mechanical injury to the trunk base and roots.
            *   Maintain tree vigor through proper nutrition and irrigation.
        *   **Chemical Control (Soil Drench around the base of affected trees):**
            *   **Propamocarb Hydrochloride** @ 2-3 ml/L water
            *   **Metalaxyl** @ 1-2 g/L water
            *   **Fosetyl-Al** @ 2-3 g/L water
            *   **Trichoderma viride** (bio-fungicide) @ 50-100 g/tree mixed with compost and applied to the root zone.

3.  **Seed Rot:** This is a general issue affecting seed viability and germination, rather than a specific disease of Neem.
    *   **Symptoms:** Seeds fail to germinate and decay in the soil.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   **Cultural Practices:**
            *   Use healthy, viable seeds from reliable sources.
            *   Store seeds properly in cool, dry conditions.
            *   Plant in well-drained, appropriately moist soil.
        *   **Chemical Control (Seed Treatment):**
            *   **Thiram** @ 2-3 g/kg seed
            *   **Captan** @ 2-3 g/kg seed
            *   **Carbendazim** @ 1-2 g/kg seed
            *   **Trichoderma viride** (bio-fungicide) @ 4-5 g/kg seed

4.  **Fruit Rot:** Neem fruits can occasionally be affected by fungal pathogens, especially if damaged or in very humid conditions, but it is not a major concern for Neem cultivation.
    *   **Symptoms:** Softening and discoloration of fruits, often with fungal growth.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   **Cultural Practices:**
            *   Harvest fruits carefully to avoid injury.
            *   Ensure good air circulation around fruits on the tree.
            *   Remove and destroy fallen or diseased fruits.
        *   **Chemical Control (if deemed necessary, generally not for Neem fruits):**
            *   **Mancozeb** @ 2 g/L water (foliar spray)
            *   **Copper Oxychloride** @ 2-3 g/L water (foliar spray)

**Conditions Not Known to Affect Neem as Distinct, Prevalent Diseases:**

*   **Stem Rot:** This is not known to affect Neem as a widespread, distinct disease, especially in mature trees. While any plant can suffer from stem decay under severe stress or injury, it is not a common primary disease for Neem.
*   **Foot Rot:** This is not known to affect Neem as a distinct, widespread disease. Issues at the base of the stem are generally covered under Root or Collar Rot.
*   **Crown Rot:** This is not known to affect Neem as a distinct, widespread disease. Issues at the crown are generally covered under Root or Collar Rot.
*   **Neck Rot:** This is not known to affect Neem as a distinct, widespread disease. Issues at the neck region are generally covered under Root or Collar Rot.
*   **Black Rot:** This is not known to affect Neem as a specific, common disease. The term "black rot" typically refers to specific diseases in other crops (e.g., crucifers, grapes).

Always ensure proper identification of the specific rot type and causative agent for effective management. For any severe or unusual symptoms, it is advisable to consult with local agricultural extension services.
