As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Scab, Canker, Gummosis, and Lichen in Neem trees in Haryana:

**Scab:**
This is not known to affect Neem.

**Canker:**
Canker diseases in Neem are often associated with wounds, environmental stress, or fungal/bacterial infections.
*   **Management:**
    *   Prune affected branches well below the visible canker into healthy wood. Ensure pruning tools are sterilized with 70% alcohol or a 10% bleach solution between cuts to prevent the spread of pathogens.
    *   Improve tree vigor through proper nutrition and irrigation practices.
    *   For severe cases or as a preventative measure after pruning, a fungicidal paste or spray can be applied to the affected areas.
    *   **Chemical Control (if necessary):**
        *   **Copper Oxychloride** 50% WP at 3 g/L of water, applied as a spray to affected areas and surrounding bark.
        *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 1 g/L of water, applied as a spray or painted on cankers after light scraping.

**Gummosis:**
Gummosis in Neem is typically a symptom of stress, mechanical injury, or underlying fungal infections (e.g., *Phytophthora* species). It manifests as the exudation of gum from the bark.
*   **Management:**
    *   Identify and address the primary cause: improve soil drainage, manage irrigation to avoid waterlogging or drought stress, and protect trees from mechanical injuries.
    *   Carefully scrape away the gum and discolored bark to expose healthy tissue.
    *   **Chemical Control (if fungal infection is suspected):**
        *   **Copper Oxychloride** 50% WP at 3 g/L of water, applied as a drench around the base of the tree or painted on the scraped areas.
        *   **Fosetyl-Al** 80% WP at 2.5 g/L of water, applied as a foliar spray or drench, particularly effective against *Phytophthora* related gummosis.

**Lichen:**
Lichens are symbiotic organisms (a combination of a fungus and an alga or cyanobacterium) that grow on the bark of trees. They are generally harmless epiphytes and do not parasitize the Neem tree or draw nutrients from it. Their presence often indicates good air quality.
*   **Management:**
    *   Control is generally not required as lichens do not harm the tree.
    *   If removal is desired for aesthetic reasons, a gentle scrubbing with a soft brush during the rainy season can dislodge them. Avoid harsh chemicals as they can damage the tree bark.
