Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling Scale insects and Mealybugs on Neem trees in Haryana.

Scale insects and Mealybugs are sap-sucking pests that can significantly damage Neem trees by extracting plant sap, leading to yellowing of leaves, stunted growth, defoliation, and the development of sooty mold due to honeydew excretion. An integrated pest management (IPM) approach is recommended for effective and sustainable control.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategy:**

1.  **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your Neem trees, especially the undersides of leaves, young shoots, and branch crotches, for the presence of these pests. Early detection is crucial for effective management.
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy heavily infested branches or twigs. This helps reduce the pest population and improves air circulation within the canopy.
    *   **Tree Health:** Ensure the tree is healthy and vigorous by providing adequate water and nutrients. Healthy trees are more resilient to pest attacks.
3.  **Mechanical Control:**
    *   For small infestations, a strong jet of water can dislodge mealybugs and some scales.
    *   For accessible areas, physically remove them using a soft brush or cloth dipped in soapy water.
4.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Encourage natural enemies such as ladybird beetles, lacewings, and parasitic wasps, which prey on or parasitize scale insects and mealybugs. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

**Chemical Control (When necessary):**

If the infestation is severe and other methods are insufficient, chemical control may be required. Always ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and stems where these pests tend to hide. Repeat applications may be necessary depending on the pest life cycle and severity of infestation.

Please use only CIBRC approved technical chemical names and follow the recommended dosages:

*   **For Foliar Spray:**
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: 0.5 - 1.0 ml/L of water.
    *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: 0.25 - 0.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP: 0.2 - 0.4 g/L of water.
    *   **Buprofezin** 25% SC: 1.25 ml/L of water (effective against nymphs and prevents molting).
    *   **Spirotetramat** 150 OD: 0.75 - 1.0 ml/L of water.
    *   **Horticultural Mineral Oil (HMO)**: 10 - 20 ml/L of water. This acts by suffocating the pests. It can be used alone or in combination with other insecticides (check compatibility). Apply during cooler parts of the day to avoid phytotoxicity.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Application Timing:** Apply insecticides when the pests are in their most vulnerable stages (e.g., crawler stage for scales, young nymphs for mealybugs).
*   **Coverage:** Ensure complete coverage of the tree, especially the undersides of leaves and stems, as these pests are often hidden.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, and protective clothing while handling and applying pesticides. Read and follow the instructions on the product label carefully.
*   **Rotation:** Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in pest populations.

For specific guidance tailored to your local conditions and the severity of the infestation, it is always advisable to consult with the agricultural extension specialists at HAU or your local Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK).
