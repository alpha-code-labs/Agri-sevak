As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I must clarify the premise of your question.

Harmful effects of weedicides/herbicides are not a commonly reported or significant issue for Neem (Azadirachta indica) in typical agricultural practices in Haryana. Neem trees are generally robust, highly resilient, and are not the target for weedicide applications in agricultural fields. In fact, Neem is often used for its pesticidal and insecticidal properties.

Therefore, specific strategies for "reducing the harmful effect of weedicide/herbicide in Neem" are not a standard practice because it is not a known or common problem.

However, if a Neem tree were to suffer damage due to severe accidental drift or direct misapplication of a herbicide, the primary approach would be prevention and general supportive care, as there are no specific chemical antidotes for herbicide damage in Neem.

**Prevention is the most effective strategy:**

*   **Careful Application:** When applying herbicides to adjacent crops, ensure proper nozzle selection, low spray pressure, and appropriate wind conditions (calm or very light breeze away from Neem trees) to minimize drift.
*   **Buffer Zones:** Maintain adequate buffer zones around Neem trees where no herbicides are applied.
*   **Shielding:** If necessary, physically shield young or sensitive Neem trees during nearby herbicide applications.
*   **Identify Herbicide Type:** Understand the type of herbicide being used (e.g., broad-spectrum, broadleaf selective) and its potential impact on non-target plants like Neem.

**If accidental exposure and damage occur, general supportive measures can aid recovery:**

*   **Immediate Washing (Foliar):** If herbicide drift is observed on the foliage shortly after application, gently wash the leaves with clean water to remove residual chemicals. This is most effective immediately after exposure.
*   **Irrigation (Soil-applied):** If a soil-active herbicide is suspected to have reached the root zone, provide thorough irrigation to help leach the chemical deeper into the soil profile, away from the active root zone.
*   **Nutrient Support:** Provide balanced fertilization to help the tree recover from stress. A general recommendation for mature trees could be 100-200 g of **Urea**, 50-100 g of **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)**, and 50-100 g of **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** per tree, applied in the root zone and watered in, depending on soil test results. For younger trees, adjust quantities proportionally.
*   **Pruning Damaged Parts:** Remove severely damaged or necrotic branches and leaves to encourage new, healthy growth. Ensure pruning tools are sterilized.
*   **Stress Reduction:** Ensure the tree has adequate water, especially during dry periods, and protect it from other stressors (e.g., pest infestations, nutrient deficiencies) while it recovers.

It is crucial to reiterate that these are general plant care measures for stress recovery, not specific treatments for herbicide effects on Neem, as such a problem is not commonly encountered or studied for this resilient tree.
