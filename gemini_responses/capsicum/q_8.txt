As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling sucking pests in Capsicum in Haryana.

Sucking pests like aphids, leafhoppers, whiteflies, thrips, and psyllids can cause significant damage to Capsicum by directly feeding on plant sap, leading to stunted growth, leaf curling, yellowing, and reduced yield. They also act as vectors for various viral diseases.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Sucking Pests in Capsicum:**

Effective management relies on an integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods.

1.  **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect plants for pest presence, especially on the undersides of leaves and new shoots. Use yellow sticky traps (10-15 traps/acre) to monitor whiteflies, aphids, and leafhoppers.
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Remove weeds from and around the field, as they can serve as alternate hosts for pests.
    *   Use disease-free planting material.
    *   Practice proper crop rotation.
    *   Optimize irrigation and nutrient management to avoid excessive succulent growth, which attracts pests.
    *   Use reflective mulches (e.g., silver-colored plastic mulch) to deter pests like aphids and thrips.
3.  **Biological Control:** Encourage natural enemies such as ladybird beetles, lacewings, and parasitic wasps (e.g., *Encarsia formosa* for whiteflies). Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

**Chemical Control (for severe infestations):**

When pest populations exceed economic threshold levels, chemical intervention may be necessary. It is crucial to rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Always follow label instructions for dosage, application, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).

Here are some CIBRC-approved technical chemical options for controlling sucking pests in Capsicum:

*   **For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, Thrips, and Psylla:**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL**: Apply 125-150 ml/acre (0.6-0.75 ml/L of water).
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG**: Apply 80-100 g/acre (0.4-0.5 g/L of water).
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP**: Apply 50-80 g/acre (0.25-0.4 g/L of water).
    *   **Flonicamid 50% WG**: Apply 60-80 g/acre (0.3-0.4 g/L of water).

*   **For Whiteflies, Thrips, and Mites (with some effect on other sucking pests):**
    *   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC**: Apply 160-200 ml/acre (0.8-1 ml/L of water). This is particularly effective against whitefly nymphs and mites.
    *   **Diafenthiuron 50% WP**: Apply 250-300 g/acre (1.25-1.5 g/L of water).

*   **For Thrips, Aphids, and Leafhoppers:**
    *   **Fipronil 5% SC**: Apply 300-400 ml/acre (1.5-2 ml/L of water).

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Rotation:** Always rotate insecticides from different chemical groups (different modes of action) to prevent resistance development.
*   **Timing:** Apply insecticides during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where many sucking pests reside.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and application.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Strictly observe the PHI mentioned on the product label to ensure the produce is safe for consumption.

By implementing these strategies, farmers can effectively manage sucking pests in Capsicum and ensure healthy crop growth and good yields.
