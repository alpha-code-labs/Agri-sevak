As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the specified conditions in Capsicum:

### Control Measures for Pests in Capsicum

**1. Grasshopper**
Grasshoppers are polyphagous pests that can cause significant defoliation in Capsicum.
*   **Malathion** 50% EC: Apply at 2.0-3.0 ml per litre of water (or 1.0-1.5 litres per acre).
*   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: Apply at 0.5 ml per litre of water (or 100-150 ml per acre).

**2. Painted bug**
This is not known to affect Capsicum. The Painted bug (*Bagrada hilaris*) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., mustard, cabbage).

**3. Red cotton bug**
This is not known to affect Capsicum. The Red cotton bug (*Dysdercus cingulatus*) is primarily a pest of cotton and other malvaceous plants.

**4. Black Ants**
While black ants are not direct feeders on Capsicum plants, they can be indirect pests by tending to sap-sucking insects like aphids and mealybugs, protecting them from natural enemies. Control measures should focus on reducing their populations, especially if they are associated with other pests.
*   **Fipronil** 0.3% GR: Apply as granules around the base of the plants or in bait stations at 5-10 kg per acre.
*   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: Apply as a drench around the base of the plants at 4-5 ml per litre of water. This helps in controlling ants nesting near the plants.
