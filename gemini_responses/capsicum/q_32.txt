The symptom of "drying up" in Capsicum, affecting branches, leaves, fruits, and flowers, is a general indication of significant stress or disease. It is crucial to accurately diagnose the underlying cause to implement effective management strategies. Here's how we can address this complex issue:

**I. Initial Diagnosis - What to Observe:**

Before recommending specific treatments, please carefully observe the following:

1.  **Pattern of Drying:**
    *   Is it affecting the entire plant, or only specific branches/leaves?
    *   Does it start from the bottom leaves and progress upwards, or vice-versa?
    *   Is one side of the plant affected more than the other?
    *   Is it sudden and rapid, or gradual?
2.  **Root Examination:** Gently dig around the base of an affected plant. Are the roots healthy (white, firm) or discolored (brown, black) and mushy? Are there galls (swellings) on the roots?
3.  **Stem Examination:**
    *   Check the stem at the soil line for any lesions, discoloration, or rotting.
    *   Cut the stem longitudinally near the base. Is there any brown or black discoloration in the vascular tissue (the inner ring)?
4.  **Leaf/Fruit Examination:** Look for any spots, lesions, insect feeding damage, or unusual growth patterns on the affected parts.
5.  **Environmental Conditions:** Consider recent changes in irrigation, temperature, rainfall, or any chemical applications.

**II. Common Causes and Management Strategies:**

Based on your observations, the "drying up" could be due to one or more of the following:

**A. Abiotic Stresses (Non-Disease/Pest Related):**

1.  **Water Stress:**
    *   **Under-watering (Drought Stress):** Leaves wilt, become crisp, and eventually dry. Fruits may shrivel.
        *   **Management:** Ensure consistent and adequate irrigation, especially during flowering and fruiting. Use drip irrigation for efficient water use. Apply mulch (straw, plastic) to conserve soil moisture.
    *   **Over-watering / Poor Drainage:** Leads to root suffocation and root rot, causing wilting and drying despite wet soil.
        *   **Management:** Improve soil drainage by incorporating organic matter. Avoid waterlogging. Plant on raised beds if your soil is heavy clay. Ensure proper spacing between plants.
2.  **Nutrient Deficiencies/Toxicities:** Severe deficiencies (e.g., Potassium, Calcium) or toxicities (e.g., salinity) can lead to leaf scorching and drying.
    *   **Management:** Conduct a soil test to identify specific deficiencies or toxicities. Apply balanced fertilizers based on soil test recommendations. For salinity, improve drainage and consider leaching salts with good quality water.
3.  **Temperature Stress:** Extreme heat can cause temporary wilting and scorching of leaves and fruits.
    *   **Management:** Provide partial shade during peak summer months using shade nets. Ensure adequate irrigation to help plants cope with heat.

**B. Biotic Stresses (Diseases and Pests):**

1.  **Fungal Wilts (e.g., Fusarium Wilt, Verticillium Wilt):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Yellowing and wilting of leaves, often starting on one side of the plant or a single branch, progressing upwards. Vascular tissue inside the stem will show brown discoloration when cut.
    *   **Management:** Use resistant varieties. Practice crop rotation with non-solanaceous crops for at least 3-4 years. Remove and destroy infected plants. Improve soil drainage.
    *   **Chemical Control (Drenching):**
        *   **Carbendazim** (50% WP) at 1-2 g/L of water, drench 100-200 ml solution per plant.
        *   **Thiophanate Methyl** (70% WP) at 1-1.5 g/L of water, drench 100-200 ml solution per plant.
2.  **Bacterial Wilt (Ralstonia solanacearum):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Rapid, sudden wilting of the entire plant without significant yellowing. When a cut stem is placed in water, a milky white bacterial ooze may be observed. Vascular tissue will show brown discoloration.
    *   **Management:** No effective chemical cure once established. Focus on prevention: Use resistant varieties. Practice strict crop rotation (non-solanaceous crops for 3-5 years). Avoid planting in previously infected fields. Remove and destroy infected plants immediately. Avoid injuring roots during intercultural operations.
    *   **Chemical Control (Preventive/Early Stage Drench):**
        *   **Streptomycin sulphate + Tetracycline hydrochloride** (90:10 SP) at 0.5-1 g/L of water, drench 100-200 ml solution per plant. (Note: Efficacy is limited once the disease is severe).
3.  **Root Rots (e.g., Phytophthora, Pythium):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Yellowing, wilting, and eventual drying of the plant, often associated with waterlogged conditions. Roots appear dark, mushy, and decayed.
    *   **Management:** Improve soil drainage. Avoid over-watering. Plant on raised beds.
    *   **Chemical Control (Drenching):**
        *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride** (72.2% SL) at 2-3 ml/L of water, drench 100-200 ml solution per plant.
        *   **Metalaxyl + Mancozeb** (8% + 64% WP) at 2-2.5 g/L of water, drench 100-200 ml solution per plant.
4.  **Anthracnose (Colletotrichum capsici):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Primarily affects fruits, causing sunken lesions, but can also cause dieback of twigs and branches, leading to drying.
    *   **Management:** Use disease-free seeds. Practice good field sanitation.
    *   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
        *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC) at 0.5-1 ml/L of water.
        *   **Difenoconazole** (25% EC) at 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2-2.5 g/L of water.
5.  **Nematodes (Root-Knot Nematodes):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, yellowing, wilting, and reduced yield. Roots will have characteristic galls (swellings). The damaged roots impair water and nutrient uptake, leading to drying symptoms.
    *   **Management:** Use resistant varieties. Practice crop rotation with non-host crops (e.g., marigold, maize). Soil solarization.
    *   **Chemical Control (Soil Application at planting/sowing):**
        *   **Carbofuran** (3% G) at 10-15 kg/acre, applied in soil.
        *   **Phorate** (10% G) at 4 kg/acre, applied in soil.
6.  **Sucking Pests (Thrips, Mites, Aphids, Whiteflies):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Severe infestations can cause curling, distortion, yellowing, and eventually drying of leaves due to sap depletion and toxin injection.
    *   **Management:** Regular monitoring. Use yellow sticky traps.
    *   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
        *   For Thrips/Mites: **Spiromesifen** (22.9% SC) at 0.5-1 ml/L of water.
        *   For Aphids/Whiteflies: **Imidacloprid** (17.8% SL) at 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   For general sucking pests: **Thiamethoxam** (25% WG) at 0.2-0.4 g/L of water.

**III. General Recommendations:**

*   **Sanitation:** Always remove and destroy severely infected plant material to prevent further spread.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Implement a robust crop rotation plan to break disease and pest cycles.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Whenever possible, choose Capsicum varieties known to be resistant or tolerant to common wilts and nematodes in your region.
*   **Soil Health:** Maintain good soil health through organic matter addition, proper drainage, and balanced nutrition.

Given the complexity of "drying up" symptoms, if you are unable to identify the exact cause, I strongly recommend collecting a sample of the affected plant (including roots and stem) and consulting with the plant pathology or entomology experts at your nearest HAU Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) for a precise diagnosis and tailored recommendations.
