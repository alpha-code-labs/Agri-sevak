Addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium) in Capsicum is crucial for healthy growth and optimal yield. As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I strongly recommend regular soil testing to accurately determine nutrient levels and tailor your fertilization program. The following advice is based on scientific principles and CIBRC-approved chemicals for use in Haryana.

**General Principle:** Soil application is the primary method for correcting severe deficiencies and building up soil nutrient reserves. Foliar application can provide a quick boost and correct mild to moderate deficiencies, especially when nutrient uptake from the soil is hindered.

### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency in Capsicum

**Symptoms:**
*   General yellowing (chlorosis) of older leaves, starting from the tips and margins.
*   Stunted plant growth with thin, spindly stems.
*   Reduced fruit set and smaller fruits.

**Correction:**

*   **Soil Application (based on soil test recommendations):**
    *   Apply **Urea** (46% N) at recommended rates, typically split into multiple applications during the growing season.
    *   Alternatively, **Calcium Nitrate** (15.5% N) can be used, especially beneficial in acidic soils or when calcium is also needed.
    *   **Ammonium Sulphate** (20.5% N) can be used, particularly in alkaline soils as it has an acidifying effect.
*   **Foliar Application (for quick correction of mild deficiency):**
    *   Spray 1-2% solution of **Urea** (10-20 g/L of water) at 10-15 day intervals until symptoms disappear. Ensure complete coverage of foliage.
    *   Alternatively, use a 0.5-1% solution of **Calcium Nitrate** (5-10 g/L of water).

### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency in Capsicum

**Symptoms:**
*   Stunted growth and dark green to purplish discoloration of leaves, especially on the undersides and petioles (more prominent in younger plants).
*   Delayed maturity and poor root development.
*   Reduced flowering and fruit set.

**Correction:**

*   **Soil Application (based on soil test recommendations, typically as a basal application):**
    *   Apply **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5) at recommended rates before planting or as a side dressing.
    *   Alternatively, **Di-Ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5) can be used, which also provides nitrogen.
    *   **Monoammonium Phosphate (MAP)** (11% N, 52% P2O5) is another excellent source, especially for drip irrigation systems.
*   **Foliar Application (less common for P, but can be used for quick uptake):**
    *   Spray 0.5-1% solution of water-soluble **Monoammonium Phosphate (MAP)** (5-10 g/L of water) or a suitable NPK fertilizer rich in phosphorus.

### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency in Capsicum

**Symptoms:**
*   Yellowing and scorching (necrosis) of leaf margins, particularly on older leaves, often starting from the tips.
*   Weak stems and increased susceptibility to lodging.
*   Poor fruit quality, irregular ripening, reduced shelf life, and increased susceptibility to diseases.

**Correction:**

*   **Soil Application (based on soil test recommendations, typically as basal or split applications):**
    *   Apply **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** / **Potassium Chloride** (60% K2O) at recommended rates.
    *   Alternatively, **Sulphate of Potash (SOP)** / **Potassium Sulphate** (50% K2O, 17.5% S) can be used, which also provides sulfur and is preferred for chloride-sensitive crops or where soil salinity is a concern.
*   **Foliar Application (for quick correction of mild deficiency):**
    *   Spray 1-2% solution of **Sulphate of Potash (SOP)** / **Potassium Sulphate** (10-20 g/L of water) at 10-15 day intervals until symptoms improve.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Soil Testing:** Always conduct a soil test before planting and periodically during the crop cycle. This is the most accurate way to determine nutrient requirements and avoid over- or under-application. HAU, Hisar, offers comprehensive soil testing services.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management (INM):** Combine chemical fertilizers with organic manures (Farm Yard Manure, compost, vermicompost) and bio-fertilizers to improve soil health and nutrient use efficiency.
*   **Timing:** Apply fertilizers at the correct growth stages of the Capsicum plant for maximum benefit.
*   **Watering:** Ensure adequate and consistent moisture in the soil, as water is essential for nutrient uptake.
*   **pH:** Maintain soil pH in the optimal range (6.0-7.0) for Capsicum, as it influences nutrient availability.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively manage macronutrient deficiencies in Capsicum and ensure a healthy, productive crop.
