Mites, including Red spider mite (*Tetranychus urticae*) and various species of Rust mites (Eriophyid mites, which can include species like *Aculops lycopersici* or others affecting Capsicum), are significant pests of Capsicum in Haryana. Effective management requires an integrated approach.

### Identification of Mites

1.  **Red Spider Mite (*Tetranychus urticae*)**:
    *   **Symptoms**: Initial damage appears as fine yellow or white stippling on the upper surface of leaves. As infestation progresses, leaves turn bronze or yellow, dry up, and may fall off. Fine silken webbing can be seen on the undersides of leaves, especially in severe infestations, protecting the mites and their eggs. Mites are tiny (0.3-0.5 mm), oval-shaped, and can be reddish-brown or greenish.
2.  **Rust Mite (Eriophyid mites)**:
    *   **Symptoms**: These mites are microscopic and cannot be seen with the naked eye. Damage typically appears as bronzing or russeting of leaves, stems, and fruits. Leaves may curl downwards, become leathery, and growth can be stunted. Fruits may develop a rough, rusty appearance.

### Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies

A holistic approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods is recommended for sustainable mite control.

#### 1. Cultural Practices:

*   **Regular Scouting**: Frequently inspect the undersides of leaves, especially during dry and warm weather, to detect mite infestations early.
*   **Water Management**: Overhead sprinkling can help dislodge mites and increase humidity, which is unfavorable for spider mites. Ensure proper irrigation to avoid water stress in plants, as stressed plants are more susceptible.
*   **Weed Management**: Remove weeds in and around the field, as many weeds can serve as alternate hosts for mites.
*   **Crop Residue Management**: After harvest, remove and destroy crop residues to reduce overwintering mite populations.
*   **Avoid Excessive Nitrogen**: High nitrogen fertilization can lead to lush, succulent growth that is more attractive to mites. Maintain balanced nutrition.

#### 2. Biological Control:

*   **Conserve Natural Enemies**: Encourage and conserve natural predators such as predatory mites (*Amblyseius* spp., *Phytoseiulus persimilis*), ladybird beetles, lacewings, and minute pirate bugs, which feed on mites. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

#### 3. Chemical Control (Acaricides):

Chemical control should be used when mite populations reach damaging levels and other methods are insufficient. Always rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where mites reside.

**Recommended CIBRC Approved Acaricides for Mites in Capsicum:**

(Note: The following dosages are generally recommended per litre of water for spray solution. For field application, typically 250-300 litres of water per acre is used, depending on crop canopy and sprayer type.)

*   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC**:
    *   Dosage: 0.5 ml per litre of water (or 125 ml per acre).
    *   Effective against all life stages of spider mites.
*   **Fenpyroximate 5% SC**:
    *   Dosage: 0.8 - 1.2 ml per litre of water (or 200-300 ml per acre).
    *   Acts as a contact and stomach poison, effective against eggs, nymphs, and adults.
*   **Propargite 57% EC**:
    *   Dosage: 4 - 5 ml per litre of water (or 1.0 - 1.25 litres per acre).
    *   A broad-spectrum acaricide effective against various mite species.
*   **Abamectin 1.9% EC**:
    *   Dosage: 0.6 - 0.8 ml per litre of water (or 150-200 ml per acre).
    *   Translaminar action, effective against spider mites.
*   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP**:
    *   Dosage: 6 - 8 g per litre of water (or 1.5 - 2.0 kg per acre).
    *   Effective against spider mites and particularly good for rust mites (eriophyid mites) and also helps in powdery mildew control.
*   **Etoxazole 10% SC**:
    *   Dosage: 0.4 - 0.5 ml per litre of water (or 100-125 ml per acre).
    *   An ovicidal and larvicidal acaricide, effective against eggs and nymphs, with good residual activity.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Resistance Management**: Never use the same chemical repeatedly. Rotate between different groups of acaricides (with different modes of action) to prevent mites from developing resistance.
*   **Timing of Application**: Apply acaricides when mite populations are building up, before they cause severe damage. Early morning or late evening sprays are recommended to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   **Safety Precautions**: Always read and follow the instructions on the product label. Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, and protective clothing during mixing and spraying. Observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) specified for each chemical.

By implementing these scientifically verified strategies, farmers can effectively manage mite infestations in Capsicum and ensure healthy crop production.
