As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified seed and soil treatment processes for Capsicum cultivation in Haryana to ensure healthy plant establishment and mitigate early disease and pest pressure.

### Recommended Seed Treatment Process for Capsicum

Seed treatment is crucial for protecting young seedlings from seed-borne and early soil-borne pathogens, ensuring better germination and stand establishment.

1.  **Fungicidal Seed Treatment:**
    *   To protect against damping-off, seed rot, and other early fungal diseases.
    *   Option 1: Treat seeds with **Thiram 75% WS** at 2.5-3.0 grams per kilogram of seed.
    *   Option 2: Treat seeds with **Carbendazim 50% WP** at 1.0-1.5 grams per kilogram of seed.
    *   Option 3 (Combination): Treat seeds with **Carbendazim 12% + Mancozeb 63% WP** at 2.0-2.5 grams per kilogram of seed.

2.  **Insecticidal Seed Treatment (Optional, if early sucking pest pressure is anticipated):**
    *   To provide early protection against sucking pests like thrips and aphids.
    *   Treat seeds with **Imidacloprid 70% WS** at 5-7 grams per kilogram of seed.

3.  **Bio-fungicidal Seed Treatment:**
    *   For enhanced protection against soil-borne diseases and promoting plant growth. This should be done *after* chemical seed treatment, or as a standalone organic option.
    *   Treat seeds with **Trichoderma viride** (or *Trichoderma harzianum*) at 4-5 grams per kilogram of seed. Mix the bio-agent with a small amount of water to form a slurry, coat the seeds evenly, and dry them in shade before sowing.

**Application Method:** Mix the recommended quantity of the chemical/bio-agent with the seeds in a plastic bag or container and shake well until the seeds are uniformly coated. Dry the treated seeds in shade before sowing.

### Recommended Soil Treatment Process for Capsicum

Soil treatment aims to manage soil-borne diseases, nematodes, and insect pests, creating a healthier environment for root development.

1.  **Nursery Bed Preparation (Pre-sowing):**
    *   **Solarization:** Cover the nursery beds with transparent polyethylene sheets (100-gauge thickness) for 4-6 weeks during hot summer months (May-June). This helps in reducing soil-borne pathogens, nematodes, and weed seeds.
    *   **Bio-fungicide Application:** Incorporate well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost enriched with **Trichoderma viride** (2.5 kg of *Trichoderma* mixed with 50-100 kg of FYM/compost) into the nursery beds 10-15 days before sowing. This helps in managing damping-off and other root diseases.

2.  **Main Field Preparation (Pre-transplanting):**
    *   **Organic Matter Incorporation:** Incorporate 10-15 tonnes per acre of well-decomposed FYM or compost into the soil during land preparation. This improves soil structure, water retention, and microbial activity, which can suppress diseases.
    *   **Nematode Management (if known problem):**
        *   Option 1: Apply **Fluensulfone 2% GR** at 10-15 kg per acre, incorporated into the soil before transplanting.
        *   Option 2: Apply **Cadusafos 10% GR** at 10 kg per acre, incorporated into the soil before transplanting.
        *   Option 3 (Bio-nematicide): Apply **Paecilomyces lilacinus** (or *Purpureocillium lilacinum*) at 2.5 kg per acre, mixed with FYM/compost and incorporated into the soil.
    *   **Soil-borne Insect Pest Management (if known problem like cutworms, white grubs):**
        *   Apply **Fipronil 0.3% GR** at 10-15 kg per acre, incorporated into the soil at the time of transplanting.

3.  **Post-transplanting (Drenching for Damping-off/Wilt):**
    *   If damping-off or early wilt symptoms appear in the nursery or after transplanting, drench the soil around the base of the plants.
    *   Option 1: Drench with **Propamocarb hydrochloride 72.2% SL** at 2-3 ml per liter of water.
    *   Option 2: Drench with **Metalaxyl-M 3.1% + Mancozeb 48.8% SC** at 2-3 ml per liter of water.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label for safe and effective application.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods, is highly recommended for sustainable Capsicum cultivation.
*   Regularly monitor your crop for any signs of disease or pest infestation and consult with local agricultural extension officers for specific advice tailored to your farm's conditions.
