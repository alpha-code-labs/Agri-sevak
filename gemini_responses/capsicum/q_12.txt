Namaste, Kisan bhaiyon! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I will provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling Scale insects and Mealybugs in Capsicum (Shimla Mirch) crops in Haryana. Both these pests are significant threats, causing sap-sucking damage, stunted growth, and promoting sooty mold due to honeydew secretion.

An Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is crucial for effective and sustainable control.

### Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Scale Insects and Mealybugs in Capsicum

1.  **Monitoring and Scouting:**
    *   Regularly inspect your Capsicum plants, especially the undersides of leaves, stems, leaf axils, and developing fruits, for early signs of these pests. Look for white, cottony masses (mealybugs) or small, immobile, waxy/hard bumps (scales).

2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy heavily infested leaves, stems, or fruits immediately to reduce pest populations.
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the field free of weeds, as they can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
    *   **Proper Nutrition:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush, soft growth that is more attractive to sap-sucking pests.
    *   **Water Management:** Ensure proper irrigation to maintain plant vigour, as stressed plants are more susceptible.

3.  **Mechanical Control:**
    *   For small infestations, especially in kitchen gardens or small plots, mealybugs and scales can be physically removed using a strong jet of water or by wiping them off with a cloth dipped in soapy water.

4.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Encourage natural enemies such such as ladybird beetles (e.g., *Cryptolaemus montrouzieri* for mealybugs), lacewings, and parasitic wasps. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

### Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved)

When cultural and biological methods are insufficient, chemical control may be necessary. Always ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and stems where these pests often hide. It is advisable to add a good quality spreading agent (sticker) to the spray solution for better penetration through the waxy coating of these pests.

Here are some CIBRC-approved technical chemicals effective against Scale insects and Mealybugs in Capsicum, along with their recommended dosages:

*   **For both Scale Insects and Mealybugs:**
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply **2-3 ml per litre of water** or **400-600 ml per acre**. This is an insect growth regulator, highly effective against nymphs.
    *   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:** Apply **1-1.2 ml per litre of water** or **200-240 ml per acre**. This is a systemic insecticide that moves both upwards and downwards in the plant, providing excellent control of hidden pests.
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply **1.1-1.4 ml per litre of water** or **225-280 ml per acre**. This is a systemic insecticide effective against a wide range of sucking pests.

*   **Specifically for Mealybugs (also has some effect on scales):**
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply **1-1.25 grams per litre of water** or **200-250 grams per acre**. This is a systemic neonicotinoid insecticide.

**Important Considerations for Chemical Application:**

*   **Rotation of Chemicals:** To prevent the development of pesticide resistance, rotate insecticides with different modes of action. Do not use the same chemical repeatedly.
*   **Timing of Application:** Apply insecticides when pest populations are low (early infestation) for best results. For scales, targeting the crawler stage (young, mobile nymphs) is most effective.
*   **Safety Precautions:** Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label. Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, and protective clothing during mixing and spraying.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Observe the specified pre-harvest interval (PHI) mentioned on the label before harvesting the fruits to ensure food safety.

By adopting these integrated strategies, you can effectively manage Scale insects and Mealybugs in your Capsicum crop and ensure a healthy yield. For any specific concerns, please consult your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts.
