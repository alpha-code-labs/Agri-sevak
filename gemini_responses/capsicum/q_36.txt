### I. Improving Yield in Capsicum

To maximize the yield of Capsicum, focus on robust plant growth, efficient nutrient uptake, and effective pest and disease management.

1.  **Variety Selection:**
    *   Choose high-yielding hybrid varieties that are well-adapted to Haryana's agro-climatic conditions and possess resistance to common diseases (e.g., viral diseases, bacterial wilt). Consult with HAU extension services for recommended hybrids.

2.  **Nutrient Management (Based on Soil Test):**
    *   **Basal Application:** Apply well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost (20-25 tonnes/acre) along with a balanced dose of NPK. A general recommendation for Capsicum is 80-120 kg Nitrogen, 60-80 kg Phosphorus, and 80-100 kg Potassium per acre, adjusted based on soil test.
        *   **Urea** (for Nitrogen)
        *   **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (for Nitrogen and Phosphorus)
        *   **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** (for Potassium)
    *   **Micronutrients:** Deficiencies in micronutrients like Zinc, Boron, and Molybdenum can severely impact flowering and fruit set.
        *   Apply **Zinc Sulphate** (10-15 kg/acre) as a basal dose if deficient.
        *   Foliar spray of **Borax** (1.5-2 g/L water) or other boron formulations during pre-flowering and fruit set stages.
        *   Foliar spray of **Chelated Zinc** (0.5-1 g/L water) if deficiency symptoms appear.
    *   **Fertigation:** If using drip irrigation, apply water-soluble fertilizers (e.g., 19:19:19, 13:0:45) in split doses throughout the crop cycle for efficient nutrient delivery.

3.  **Water Management:**
    *   **Drip Irrigation:** Highly recommended for efficient water use and maintaining consistent soil moisture.
    *   **Critical Stages:** Ensure adequate moisture during flowering and fruit development stages. Avoid water stress, which can lead to flower drop and reduced fruit size.

4.  **Weed Management:**
    *   **Pre-emergence:** Apply **Pendimethalin** (1.0-1.5 L/acre) within 3 days of transplanting to control germinating weeds.
    *   **Manual Weeding:** Conduct 2-3 manual weedings as needed.

5.  **Pest and Disease Management (General for Yield Protection):**
    *   **Sucking Pests (Thrips, Aphids, Whiteflies, Mites):** These pests can cause significant yield loss by direct feeding and vectoring viral diseases.
        *   For Thrips and Aphids: Spray **Imidacloprid** (0.25-0.5 ml/L water) or **Thiamethoxam** (0.2 g/L water).
        *   For Mites: Spray **Spiromesifen** (0.5 ml/L water).
    *   **Fruit Borers:** Can cause direct damage to fruits, reducing marketable yield.
        *   Spray **Chlorantraniliprole** (0.3 ml/L water) at fruit initiation.
    *   **Fungal Diseases (Damping-off, Phytophthora Blight, Anthracnose):**
        *   For Damping-off (seedling stage): Treat seeds with **Thiram** (2-3 g/kg seed) or **Carbendazim** (1-2 g/kg seed).
        *   For Phytophthora Blight: Spray **Metalaxyl + Mancozeb** (2 g/L water) or **Propineb** (2.5 g/L water).
        *   For Anthracnose: Spray **Azoxystrobin** (0.5 ml/L water) or **Mancozeb** (2.5 g/L water).
    *   **Bacterial Diseases (Bacterial Wilt, Bacterial Spot):**
        *   For Bacterial Spot: Spray **Copper Oxychloride** (2.5 g/L water) or a combination of **Streptomycin sulphate + Tetracycline hydrochloride** (0.6 g/L water).

### II. Improving Fruit Quality in Capsicum

High-quality fruits are characterized by good size, uniform shape, vibrant color, firmness, and absence of blemishes.

1.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Calcium:** Crucial for cell wall integrity and preventing Blossom End Rot (BER).
        *   Foliar spray of **Calcium Nitrate** (5 g/L water) during flowering and fruit development, especially in sandy soils or under erratic irrigation.
    *   **Potassium:** Enhances fruit size, color development, and sugar content.
        *   Ensure adequate **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** application. Foliar spray of **Potassium Nitrate** (5 g/L water) can be beneficial during fruit development.
    *   **Boron:** Essential for pollen viability, fruit set, and proper fruit development, preventing deformities.
        *   Foliar spray of **Borax** (1.5-2 g/L water) at pre-flowering and fruit set.

2.  **Water Management:**
    *   Maintain consistent soil moisture. Erratic watering (alternating dry and wet conditions) can lead to fruit cracking and BER.

3.  **Pest and Disease Management (Focus on Fruit Blemishes):**
    *   **Sucking Pests:** Control thrips and mites to prevent fruit scarring and deformities.
        *   Use **Imidacloprid** (0.25-0.5 ml/L water) or **Thiamethoxam** (0.2 g/L water) for thrips/aphids.
        *   Use **Spiromesifen** (0.5 ml/L water) for mites.
    *   **Fruit Borers:** Prevent direct damage to fruits.
        *   Spray **Chlorantraniliprole** (0.3 ml/L water).
    *   **Fungal/Bacterial Spots:** Control diseases like anthracnose and bacterial spot that cause lesions on fruits.
        *   For Anthracnose: Spray **Azoxystrobin** (0.5 ml/L water) or **Carbendazim** (1 g/L water).
        *   For Bacterial Spot: Spray **Copper Oxychloride** (2.5 g/L water).

4.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Pruning:** Remove unproductive branches and suckers to direct energy towards fruit development, leading to larger and better-quality fruits.
    *   **Staking/Support:** Provide support to plants to prevent lodging and ensure fruits do not touch the ground, reducing disease incidence and improving fruit shape.
    *   **Shade Netting:** During peak summer months in Haryana, extreme heat can cause sunscald on fruits. Using 30-50% shade netting can protect fruits and improve color development.

### III. Improving Storage Life for Capsicum

Extending the storage life of Capsicum involves minimizing physical damage, reducing water loss, and preventing microbial spoilage from pre-harvest to post-harvest.

1.  **Pre-harvest Factors:**
    *   **Nutrient Management:**
        *   Adequate **Calcium** application (as mentioned above) strengthens cell walls, making fruits firmer and less susceptible to post-harvest decay and softening.
        *   Balanced **Potassium** also contributes to fruit firmness.
    *   **Disease Control:** Minimize pre-harvest infections, especially those causing latent infections that manifest during storage (e.g., anthracnose).
        *   Regular sprays of fungicides like **Azoxystrobin** (0.5 ml/L water) or **Pyraclostrobin** (0.75 ml/L water) can reduce fungal load on fruits.
    *   **Water Management:** Avoid severe water stress just before harvest, as it can lead to rapid wilting and reduced shelf life.

2.  **Harvesting Practices:**
    *   **Maturity Stage:** Harvest fruits at the correct physiological maturity. For green bell peppers, harvest when they are fully sized, firm, and dark green. For colored varieties, harvest when they have developed 75-100% of their characteristic color. Over-mature fruits have a shorter shelf life.
    *   **Gentle Handling:** Harvest fruits carefully using sharp secateurs or knives, leaving a short pedicel (stem) attached. Avoid pulling, dropping, or bruising fruits, as physical damage creates entry points for pathogens and accelerates spoilage.
    *   **Time of Day:** Harvest during the cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize field heat, which reduces the energy required for subsequent cooling.

3.  **Post-harvest Handling and Storage:**
    *   **Pre-cooling:** Rapidly remove field heat immediately after harvest. This is the most critical step for extending shelf life. Hydro-cooling (dunking in cold water) or forced-air cooling can be employed.
    *   **Cleaning:** Gently clean fruits to remove any dirt or debris. Avoid harsh washing that might damage the skin.
    *   **Sorting and Grading:** Immediately sort out any damaged, diseased, or immature fruits. Grade fruits based on size, color, and quality.
    *   **Packaging:** Pack fruits in well-ventilated crates or cartons (e.g., corrugated fiberboard boxes with perforations) to allow air circulation and prevent moisture accumulation, which can promote fungal growth.
    *   **Storage Conditions:**
        *   **Temperature:** Store Capsicum at an optimal temperature of 7-10°C. Temperatures below 7°C can cause chilling injury (pitting, discoloration, softening), while temperatures above 10°C accelerate ripening and senescence.
        *   **Relative Humidity:** Maintain a high relative humidity of 90-95% to minimize water loss and maintain fruit turgidity.

By diligently implementing these practices, you can significantly improve the yield, quality, and storage life of your Capsicum crop, leading to better market returns.
