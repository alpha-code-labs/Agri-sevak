As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified practices for Capsicum transplantation in Haryana:

### Ideal Transplantation Time for Capsicum in Haryana

The ideal transplantation time for Capsicum in Haryana depends on the desired cropping season and prevailing climatic conditions:

*   **Spring-Summer Crop:** Mid-February to Mid-March. This allows the crop to establish before the intense summer heat and mature during favorable conditions.
*   **Monsoon/Autumn Crop:** Mid-June to Mid-July. Planting during the onset of monsoon ensures good moisture availability for establishment.
*   **Autumn-Winter Crop (often under protected cultivation or in milder areas):** Mid-September to Mid-October. This crop benefits from cooler temperatures but may require protection from severe winter frost in open fields.

### Ideal Transplantation Distance for Capsicum

The ideal spacing depends on the variety (bushy vs. erect), soil fertility, and cultivation method. For open field cultivation, the following distances are generally recommended:

*   **Row-to-Row (R-R):** 60 - 75 cm
*   **Plant-to-Plant (P-P):** 45 - 60 cm

This spacing typically accommodates 22,000 - 37,000 plants per acre, allowing for proper light penetration, air circulation, and ease of cultural operations.

### Ideal Transplantation Process for Capsicum

1.  **Seedling Preparation:**
    *   Capsicum seedlings are typically ready for transplanting when they are 4-6 weeks old, have developed 4-6 true leaves, and are about 10-15 cm tall.
    *   **Hardening:** Gradually expose seedlings to outdoor conditions (reduced watering, increased sunlight) for 7-10 days before transplanting. This acclimatizes them to field conditions and significantly reduces transplant shock.

2.  **Field Preparation:**
    *   Thoroughly plough and harrow the field to achieve a fine, friable tilth.
    *   Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost (10-15 tonnes/acre) during land preparation to enrich soil fertility and improve soil structure.
    *   Form raised beds (15-20 cm high, 90-120 cm wide) for better drainage and aeration, especially in areas prone to waterlogging.
    *   Apply basal doses of recommended fertilizers (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium) as per soil test reports.

3.  **Transplanting:**
    *   Water the nursery beds or trays thoroughly a few hours before transplanting to ensure the root ball remains intact and seedlings can be removed easily.
    *   Transplant seedlings preferably in the late afternoon or evening hours, or on a cloudy day, to minimize stress from direct sunlight and high temperatures.
    *   Carefully remove seedlings with their root ball intact to avoid root damage.
    *   Plant the seedlings at the same depth as they were in the nursery.
    *   Gently firm the soil around the base of each seedling to ensure good root-to-soil contact and eliminate air pockets.

4.  **Post-Transplanting Care:**
    *   Immediately after transplanting, provide light irrigation to help settle the soil around the roots and aid establishment.
    *   Ensure adequate moisture in the root zone for the first 7-10 days, which is critical for seedling establishment.
    *   Monitor for any signs of wilting or stress and provide additional care as needed.
