As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following cultivation practices for Capsicum in Haryana:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   Capsicum is primarily grown by transplanting seedlings raised in a nursery. Direct sowing is generally not recommended due to the slow germination and delicate nature of young seedlings.
    *   Seeds should be sown in well-prepared nursery beds or pro-trays.
    *   Seedlings are typically ready for transplanting when they are 4-6 weeks old and have 4-6 true leaves.
    *   In the main field, transplanting is done in rows to facilitate inter-cultivation, irrigation, and harvesting.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   **For seeds in the nursery:** Sow seeds shallowly at a depth of 0.5 - 1.0 cm.
    *   **For transplanting seedlings:** Plant the seedlings at the same depth as they were in the nursery. Ensure the root ball is completely covered with soil, but avoid burying the stem too deeply, which can lead to stem rot.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   Optimal spacing is crucial for proper plant growth, air circulation, and yield.
    *   **Row-to-row spacing:** 60 - 75 cm
    *   **Plant-to-plant spacing:** 45 - 60 cm
    *   This spacing allows for adequate light penetration and reduces competition for nutrients and water.

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   The recommended seed dose for raising seedlings for one acre is:
        *   **80 - 120 grams per acre** (for open-pollinated varieties).
        *   For hybrid varieties, which often have higher germination rates and vigor, the seed rate can be slightly lower, typically around 60-80 grams per acre, but a general range of 80-120 grams per acre covers most scenarios for transplanting.
