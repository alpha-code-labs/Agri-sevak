Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice regarding flower and fruit drop in Capsicum.

First, regarding 'Tinda/Boll dropping', this is not known to affect Capsicum. Tinda (*Praecitrullus fistulosus*) is a cucurbit, and boll dropping is a phenomenon primarily observed in cotton (*Gossypium* spp.). Capsicum (*Capsicum annuum*) experiences flower and fruit drop, which we will address.

Flower and fruit drop in Capsicum is a common physiological issue often caused by various environmental stresses, nutritional imbalances, or pollination problems. Here's how to control it:

**I. Understanding the Causes of Flower and Fruit Drop in Capsicum:**

1.  **Environmental Stress:**
    *   **Temperature Extremes:** High temperatures (above 30-35°C) or low temperatures (below 15°C) during flowering and fruit set.
    *   **Humidity:** Very low (dry winds) or very high humidity (hinders pollen dispersal).
    *   **Water Stress:** Both drought (insufficient water) and waterlogging (excess water).
    *   **Light Intensity:** Insufficient light or excessive direct sunlight causing scorching.
    *   **Strong Winds:** Can physically dislodge flowers and young fruits.
2.  **Nutritional Imbalance:**
    *   Deficiency of essential micronutrients like Boron, Calcium, and Zinc.
    *   Imbalance of macronutrients, especially excessive nitrogen, which promotes vegetative growth over reproductive growth.
3.  **Pollination Issues:**
    *   Lack of pollinators (bees, other insects).
    *   Non-viable pollen due to extreme temperatures.
4.  **Pest and Disease Pressure:**
    *   Severe infestations of pests (e.g., thrips, mites, aphids) or diseases can weaken the plant, leading to dropping.
5.  **Physiological Stress:**
    *   Heavy fruit load (the plant sheds excess to manage resources).
    *   Sudden changes in environmental conditions.

**II. Control Measures for Flower and Fruit Drop in Capsicum:**

The primary approach is to identify and alleviate the underlying stress factor. Good agricultural practices are key.

**A. Optimizing Environmental Conditions:**

*   **Temperature Management:**
    *   Select heat-tolerant varieties for summer planting in Haryana.
    *   Provide partial shade (e.g., 30-50% shade net) during peak summer afternoons to reduce heat stress, especially during flowering.
    *   Ensure proper ventilation in protected cultivation structures.
*   **Humidity Management:**
    *   Maintain adequate soil moisture to help regulate ambient humidity.
    *   Avoid overhead irrigation during flowering to prevent pollen wash-off.
*   **Water Management:**
    *   Implement drip irrigation for precise and consistent water delivery.
    *   Maintain consistent soil moisture; avoid extremes of drought or waterlogging. Water deeply and less frequently.
*   **Light:**
    *   Ensure plants receive adequate sunlight (6-8 hours) but protect from scorching afternoon sun in hot climates.
*   **Wind Protection:**
    *   Plant windbreaks or use physical barriers in areas prone to strong winds.

**B. Nutritional Management:**

*   **Soil Testing:** Conduct regular soil tests to identify specific nutrient deficiencies.
*   **Balanced Fertilization:**
    *   Apply a balanced NPK fertilizer based on soil test recommendations.
    *   Avoid excessive nitrogen, especially during flowering and fruiting stages, as it promotes vegetative growth at the expense of fruit development.
*   **Micronutrient Application (if deficiency is confirmed by soil/tissue analysis):**
    *   **Boron:** Essential for pollen viability and fruit set. If deficiency is suspected, apply foliar spray of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (1-1.5 g/L water) or soil application of **Borax** (10-15 kg/acre) before flowering.
    *   **Calcium:** Important for cell wall strength and preventing blossom end rot (which can precede fruit drop). Apply foliar spray of **Calcium nitrate** (5-10 g/L water) or soil application.
    *   **Zinc:** Involved in hormone production and enzyme activity. Apply foliar spray of **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (2-3 g/L water) if deficient.
*   **Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs):**
    *   Under severe stress conditions or to promote fruit set, certain PGRs can be used judiciously.
    *   **Naphthalene acetic acid (NAA)**: Can be used at very low concentrations (5-10 ppm, i.e., 5-10 mg/L water) as a foliar spray at the early flowering stage to reduce flower drop and improve fruit set. *Caution: Higher concentrations can be phytotoxic or cause adverse effects. Always follow manufacturer's recommendations.*

**C. Pollination Enhancement:**

*   Encourage natural pollinators (bees, other insects) by planting flowering plants nearby or avoiding broad-spectrum insecticides during flowering.
*   In protected cultivation, gentle shaking of plants during peak flowering can aid pollen dispersal.

**D. Pest and Disease Management:**

*   Regularly scout for pests (thrips, mites, aphids) and diseases.
*   Implement integrated pest management (IPM) strategies.
*   Control severe infestations promptly using CIBRC approved insecticides/fungicides if necessary, as healthy plants are less prone to dropping. For example, for thrips, you may use:
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL at 0.5 ml/L water.
    *   **Fipronil** 5% SC at 1.5-2 ml/L water.

**E. Cultural Practices:**

*   **Pruning:** Remove excess vegetative growth to redirect energy towards fruit development.
*   **Support:** Provide staking or support to plants, especially when heavily laden with fruits, to prevent physical stress.
*   **Variety Selection:** Choose Capsicum varieties known to perform well in Haryana's specific agro-climatic conditions and are less prone to dropping.

By implementing these integrated management strategies, you can significantly reduce flower and fruit drop and improve the overall yield of your Capsicum crop.
