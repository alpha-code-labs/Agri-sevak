Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concerns regarding pest management in Capsicum. Effective control requires a thorough understanding of the pest and integrated pest management (IPM) principles.

Here's scientifically verified advice for controlling Beetles and Weevils in Capsicum, along with clarification on Sawflies:

### General Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Principles for Capsicum:

Before resorting to chemical control, always consider these practices:
1.  **Regular Monitoring:** Frequently inspect your Capsicum plants for any signs of pest damage or the presence of pests. Early detection is key.
2.  **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy crop residues, weeds, and volunteer plants that can harbor pests.
3.  **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting Capsicum or other solanaceous crops in the same field year after year.
4.  **Healthy Plants:** Ensure proper nutrition and irrigation to maintain vigorous plants, which are more resilient to pest attacks.

### 1. Control of Beetles in Capsicum

Various beetles can affect Capsicum, including flea beetles (damaging leaves, especially seedlings) and blister beetles or epilachna beetles (defoliators).

**Symptoms/Damage:**
*   **Flea Beetles:** Small, round holes or "shot-hole" damage on leaves, especially young seedlings. Severe infestation can stunt growth.
*   **Blister Beetles/Epilachna Beetles:** Irregular holes or skeletonization of leaves, leading to significant defoliation.

**Cultural/Mechanical Control:**
*   **Hand-picking:** For larger beetles like blister beetles, hand-picking and destroying them can be effective in small areas.
*   **Yellow Sticky Traps:** Can help monitor and trap adult beetles, especially flea beetles.
*   **Row Covers:** For young plants, physical barriers like fine mesh row covers can prevent beetle access.

**Chemical Control (Apply only when pest incidence crosses economic threshold):**
For effective control of beetles, consider the following CIBRC approved technical chemicals:
*   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: 125-150 ml per acre (or 0.25-0.3 ml/L of water)
*   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: 40-80 g per acre (or 0.1-0.2 g/L of water)
*   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: 100-150 ml per acre (or 0.2-0.3 ml/L of water)
*   **Cypermethrin** 25% EC: 60-80 ml per acre (or 0.12-0.16 ml/L of water)
*   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC: 60 ml per acre (or 0.12 ml/L of water) - particularly effective against beetle larvae.

Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage during spraying.

### 2. Control of Weevils in Capsicum

The most significant weevil pest of Capsicum is the Pepper Weevil, which primarily damages fruits. Other weevils might occasionally affect roots or stems.

**Symptoms/Damage:**
*   **Pepper Weevil:** Punctures on flower buds and young fruits, leading to premature fruit drop. Infested fruits may show discoloration, deformities, and internal damage from larvae.

**Cultural/Mechanical Control:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy all fallen fruits, buds, and plant debris to eliminate breeding sites.
*   **Early Harvest:** Harvest fruits promptly to reduce the time they are susceptible to weevil attack.
*   **Pruning:** Remove lower leaves and branches that touch the ground to reduce weevil access.

**Chemical Control (Apply only when pest incidence crosses economic threshold):**
For effective control of weevils, especially the adult stage, consider the following CIBRC approved technical chemicals:
*   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: 125-150 ml per acre (or 0.25-0.3 ml/L of water)
*   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: 40-80 g per acre (or 0.1-0.2 g/L of water)
*   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: 100-150 ml per acre (or 0.2-0.3 ml/L of water)
*   **Fipronil** 5% SC: 400-600 ml per acre (or 0.8-1.2 ml/L of water)

Repeated applications at recommended intervals may be necessary, especially during flowering and fruiting stages, to target adult weevils before they lay eggs.

### 3. Sawflies in Capsicum

This is not known to affect Capsicum. Sawflies are generally not considered pests of Capsicum (chilli/bell pepper) in Haryana or elsewhere.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label, including dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions.

Wishing you a healthy and bountiful Capsicum harvest!
