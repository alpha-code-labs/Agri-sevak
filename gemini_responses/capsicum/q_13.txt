Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing these pests in Capsicum.

### Control of Fruit Fly in Capsicum

Fruit flies, particularly the melon fruit fly (*Bactrocera cucurbitae*), can be a significant pest in Capsicum, causing direct damage to the fruits. An Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is recommended for effective control.

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Methods:**

*   **Field Sanitation:** Regularly collect and destroy all fallen, damaged, or infested fruits by burying them deep in the soil or burning them. This breaks the life cycle of the pest.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** After harvest, deep ploughing helps expose pupae in the soil to predators and adverse weather conditions.
*   **Pheromone Traps:** Install specific fruit fly pheromone traps (e.g., Methyl Eugenol traps for male annihilation technique) at a density of 10-12 traps per acre. Replace lures every 2-3 weeks.
*   **Protein Bait Traps:** Prepare bait traps using a mixture of jaggery (gur) or protein hydrolysate with an insecticide. Place these traps strategically in the field.

**2. Chemical Control (Use only CIBRC approved technical chemicals):**

For chemical control, focus on bait sprays which are highly effective and reduce overall pesticide load. Spot application of bait sprays on foliage is recommended.

*   **Bait Sprays:**
    *   Mix **Malathion** 50% EC at 2 ml/L of water with 10 g/L of jaggery (gur) or protein hydrolysate. Apply this mixture as a spot spray on foliage, targeting 50-100 spots per acre.
    *   Alternatively, use **Spinosad** 45% SC at 0.25 ml/L of water mixed with 10 g/L of jaggery or protein hydrolysate. Apply as a spot spray.

*   **Direct Foliar Sprays (if infestation is severe and bait sprays are insufficient):**
    *   **Deltamethrin** 2.8% EC at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 0.5 ml/L of water.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always follow the manufacturer's instructions regarding dosage, application method, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
*   Ensure thorough coverage when spraying.
*   Spray during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.

### Control of Ber Fly in Capsicum

This is not known to affect Capsicum. The Ber fly (*Carpomyia vesuviana*) is a host-specific pest primarily affecting Ber (*Ziziphus mauritiana*) and other wild *Ziziphus* species.
