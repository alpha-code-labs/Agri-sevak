As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm that the rust diseases you have listed (Black Rust, Brown Rust, Yellow Rust, White Rust, and Red Rust) are **not known to affect Capsicum** as significant or common pathogens in Haryana or globally.

*   **Black Rust (Stem Rust), Brown Rust (Leaf Rust), and Yellow Rust (Stripe Rust)** are primarily diseases of cereal crops like wheat, barley, and rye, caused by *Puccinia* species specific to those hosts.
*   **White Rust** is typically caused by *Albugo* species, which are oomycetes (not true fungi) and primarily affect cruciferous crops (e.g., mustard, radish) and some other plant families, but not Capsicum.
*   **Red Rust** can be a general term, but true rust fungi (Uredinales) are not a major disease concern for Capsicum. If referring to *Cephaleuros virescens*, it's an algal disease of woody plants, not Capsicum.

Therefore, there are no specific control measures for these particular rusts in Capsicum because they do not pose a threat to this crop.
