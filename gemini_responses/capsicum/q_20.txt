Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the critical role micronutrients play in the healthy growth and productivity of Capsicum. Addressing these deficiencies promptly and correctly is vital for a successful harvest.

Before applying any corrective measures, it is highly recommended to conduct a comprehensive soil test. This will accurately identify the deficient micronutrients and their levels, allowing for precise and efficient application, preventing both under- and over-application, which can be detrimental.

Here's how to address the specified micronutrient deficiencies in Capsicum:

### General Recommendations:
*   **Soil Application:** Best done pre-planting or at planting, incorporating the nutrient into the soil.
*   **Foliar Application:** Effective for quick correction of visible symptoms, especially when soil conditions limit nutrient uptake (e.g., high pH). Apply in the early morning or late evening for better absorption and to avoid leaf scorching.
*   Always ensure good spray coverage for foliar applications.
*   Do not mix different micronutrient fertilizers without checking compatibility.

### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

*   **Role in Capsicum:** Essential for enzyme activation, chlorophyll formation, carbohydrate metabolism, and growth hormone synthesis.
*   **Deficiency Symptoms:** Stunted growth, small and narrow leaves (often called "little leaf"), interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, and sometimes bronzing of older leaves.
*   **Addressing Deficiency:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** (21% Zn): 2.5-5 g/L water.
        *   **Zinc EDTA** (12% Zn): 1-1.5 g/L water.
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, starting when symptoms appear.
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** (21% Zn): 10-25 kg/acre, applied pre-planting or at planting.
        *   **Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate** (33% Zn): 5-10 kg/acre, applied pre-planting or at planting.

### 2. Iron/Ferrous (Fe) Deficiency

*   **Role in Capsicum:** Crucial for chlorophyll synthesis, photosynthesis, and respiration.
*   **Deficiency Symptoms:** Prominent interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on young leaves, with veins remaining distinctly green. In severe cases, the entire leaf may turn yellow or white.
*   **Addressing Deficiency:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   **Ferrous Sulphate Heptahydrate** (19% Fe): 5 g/L water.
        *   **Ferrous EDTA** (12% Fe): 1-1.5 g/L water.
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 7-10 day intervals. Foliar application is often more effective in alkaline soils where soil-applied iron can become unavailable.
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   **Ferrous Sulphate Heptahydrate** (19% Fe): 20-40 kg/acre, especially in soils with pH below 7.0.
        *   **Ferrous EDTA** (12% Fe): 5-10 kg/acre, more effective in alkaline soils.

### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

*   **Role in Capsicum:** Essential for cell wall formation, sugar transport, pollen germination, flowering, and fruit development.
*   **Deficiency Symptoms:** Stunted growth, thickening and brittleness of young leaves, cracking of stems and fruits, poor fruit set, deformed or corky fruits, and sometimes internal browning.
*   **Addressing Deficiency:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (10.5% B): 1-1.5 g/L water.
        *   **Boric Acid** (17% B): 0.5-1 g/L water.
        *   Apply 1-2 sprays, particularly at pre-flowering and fruit set stages.
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   **Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate** (Borax, 11% B): 4-8 kg/acre, applied pre-planting.
        *   **Boric Acid** (17% B): 2-4 kg/acre, applied pre-planting.
        *   Boron has a narrow range between deficiency and toxicity, so precise application based on soil test is crucial.

### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

*   **Role in Capsicum:** Critical for cell wall structure, membrane integrity, cell division, and fruit quality.
*   **Deficiency Symptoms:** Blossom End Rot (BER) in fruits (a water-soaked spot at the blossom end, which enlarges, darkens, and becomes leathery), stunted growth, marginal necrosis (browning) of young leaves, and distorted new growth.
*   **Addressing Deficiency:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   **Calcium Nitrate** (18.8% Ca): 5-10 g/L water.
        *   **Calcium Chloride** (27% Ca): 3-5 g/L water.
        *   Apply multiple sprays (3-4) at 7-10 day intervals, starting from fruit set, especially during periods of rapid fruit development or high temperatures.
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   **Gypsum** (Calcium Sulphate): 200-400 kg/acre, incorporated into the soil pre-planting, especially in sodic soils.
        *   **Calcium Nitrate** (18.8% Ca): Can be applied through fertigation at recommended rates. Ensure consistent soil moisture.

### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

*   **Role in Capsicum:** Central component of chlorophyll, essential for photosynthesis, and an activator for many enzymes.
*   **Deficiency Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves (veins remain green), often starting from the leaf margins and progressing inwards. Leaves may become brittle and curl upwards.
*   **Addressing Deficiency:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   **Magnesium Sulphate Heptahydrate** (9.6% Mg): 5-10 g/L water.
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals.
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   **Magnesium Sulphate Heptahydrate** (9.6% Mg): 10-20 kg/acre, applied pre-planting or as a side-dressing.
        *   Dolomite (Calcium Magnesium Carbonate): Can be used as a long-term soil amendment in acidic soils.

### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

*   **Role in Capsicum:** Involved in photosynthesis, respiration, nitrogen metabolism, and enzyme activation.
*   **Deficiency Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, similar to iron deficiency but often accompanied by small necrotic (dead) spots. Growth may be stunted.
*   **Addressing Deficiency:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   **Manganese Sulphate Monohydrate** (30.5% Mn): 2.5-5 g/L water.
        *   **Manganese EDTA** (12% Mn): 1-1.5 g/L water.
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals.
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   **Manganese Sulphate Monohydrate** (30.5% Mn): 10-20 kg/acre, applied pre-planting.
