As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified recommendations for the use of Growth Regulators/Hormones in Capsicum in Haryana:

### Recommended Doses of Growth Regulators/Hormones in Capsicum

**1. Ethephon**
*   **Technical Name:** Ethephon
*   **Purpose:** Used for uniform ripening of fruits, especially beneficial for red or yellow capsicum varieties to achieve desired colour development.
*   **Recommended Dose:** Foliar spray of **Ethephon** at 250-500 ppm (parts per million) when fruits begin to show colour change.
    *   To achieve this concentration, typically use **0.6 - 1.3 ml** of **Ethephon** 39% SL per litre of water.
    *   **Application:** Apply as a uniform foliar spray, ensuring good coverage of the fruits.

**2. 2,4-D (2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid)**
*   **Technical Name:** 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid
*   **Recommendation:** While 2,4-D is a plant growth regulator at extremely low concentrations, its use in Capsicum for promoting fruit set or preventing flower drop is generally **not recommended** by Haryana Agricultural University. This is due to its very narrow safety margin; even slightly higher concentrations act as a potent herbicide and can cause severe phytotoxicity, leading to deformed fruits, leaf curling, or complete crop loss. The risk of misapplication or drift is very high, making it unsuitable for general use in sensitive vegetable crops like Capsicum.

**3. Boron**
*   **Technical Name:** Boron (as a micronutrient)
*   **Purpose:** Boron is an essential micronutrient crucial for pollen germination, fertilization, fruit set, and overall fruit development. Its deficiency can lead to poor fruit set, flower drop, malformed fruits, and hollow stems.
*   **Recommended Dose:** Foliar spray of **Boron** at 0.1% - 0.2% concentration.
    *   This translates to:
        *   **1-2 grams** of a product containing 10-11% Boron (e.g., Borax) per litre of water.
        *   OR **0.5-1 gram** of a product containing 17-20% Boron (e.g., Solubor) per litre of water.
    *   **Application:** Apply as a foliar spray at the flowering and early fruit setting stages. Repeat if deficiency symptoms persist or if conditions favour deficiency (e.g., dry soil, high pH). Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.
