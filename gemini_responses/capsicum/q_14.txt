Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling soil pests like termites and root-knot nematodes in Capsicum (Bell Pepper) cultivation in Haryana. Both these pests are significant threats to Capsicum yield and plant health.

It is crucial to adopt an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods for sustainable control.

### 1. Control of Termites (*Odontotermes obesus*, *Microtermes obesi* etc.) in Capsicum

Termites can cause significant damage by feeding on roots and the base of the stem, leading to wilting and plant death.

**A. Cultural and Mechanical Methods:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove all crop residues, stubble, and woody debris from the field before planting, as these can serve as food sources for termites.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** Expose termite colonies to predators and sunlight by deep ploughing during summer.
*   **Avoid Organic Matter Accumulation:** Do not leave large quantities of undecomposed organic matter near the plant base.
*   **Proper Irrigation:** Maintain adequate soil moisture, as termites prefer drier conditions.

**B. Chemical Control (Pre-planting/At planting):**
For effective control, soil treatment before or at the time of planting is recommended.

*   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC:** Apply as a soil drench at the rate of **2.5-4.0 Litres per acre** mixed in 400-600 litres of water, or incorporate into the soil before transplanting.
*   **Fipronil 0.3% GR:** Apply as a soil broadcast and incorporate at the rate of **10-15 kg per acre** before transplanting or at the time of planting.

### 2. Control of Root-Knot Nematodes (*Meloidogyne* spp.) in Capsicum

Root-knot nematodes are microscopic worms that infect plant roots, causing characteristic galls or knots. This impairs water and nutrient uptake, leading to stunted growth, yellowing, wilting, and reduced yield.

**A. Cultural and Mechanical Methods:**
*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate Capsicum with non-host crops like marigold (Tagetes spp.), mustard, or cereals (wheat, maize) for at least 2-3 years. Marigold acts as a trap crop.
*   **Summer Solarization:** Cover moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks during peak summer (May-June) to raise soil temperature and kill nematodes.
*   **Use of Healthy Seedlings:** Ensure that seedlings are free from nematode infection before transplanting.
*   **Removal of Infected Plants:** Uproot and destroy severely infected plants to prevent further spread.

**B. Biological Control:**
Biological agents can be highly effective in managing nematode populations over time and improving soil health.

*   **Purpureocillium lilacinum (formerly Paecilomyces lilacinus):** Apply at the rate of **1-2 kg per acre** mixed with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost. Apply before planting or as a drench around the root zone of existing plants.
*   **Trichoderma viride/harzianum:** Apply at the rate of **2-4 kg per acre** mixed with 50-100 kg of FYM/compost. This also helps in suppressing soil-borne fungal diseases.

**C. Chemical Control (Pre-planting/At planting):**
Chemical nematicides can provide quick control, especially in heavily infested fields.

*   **Fluensulfone 2% GR:** Apply as a soil broadcast and incorporate at the rate of **10-15 kg per acre** before transplanting or at the time of planting.
*   **Fipronil 0.3% GR:** While primarily an insecticide, it also offers some efficacy against nematodes. Apply as a soil broadcast and incorporate at the rate of **10-15 kg per acre** before transplanting or at the time of planting.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the label instructions of any pesticide carefully, including dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during application.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and the latest CIBRC guidelines.
*   Regular soil testing can help determine the presence and severity of nematode infestation.

By implementing these strategies, you can effectively manage soil pests in your Capsicum crop and ensure healthy plant growth and good yields.
