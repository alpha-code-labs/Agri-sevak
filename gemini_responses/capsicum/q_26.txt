### Specialized Practices in Capsicum Cultivation

**1. Pruning**

Pruning is a crucial practice, especially for indeterminate Capsicum varieties grown in protected cultivation (polyhouses/net houses) to optimize yield, fruit quality, and plant health.

*   **Purpose:**
    *   To manage plant architecture and maintain an open canopy for better light penetration and air circulation.
    *   To remove unproductive shoots and direct plant energy towards fruit development.
    *   To reduce the incidence of diseases by improving ventilation and removing diseased/senescent leaves.
    *   To facilitate harvesting and other cultural operations.
*   **Method:**
    *   **Single or Double Stem Pruning:** In protected cultivation, plants are often trained to a single or double stem. All side shoots (suckers) emerging from the leaf axils below the first main fork are removed. For double stem, two strong, healthy shoots are allowed to develop after the first fork, and all subsequent suckers are removed.
    *   **Sucker Removal:** Regularly remove young side shoots (suckers) as soon as they appear, typically when they are 2-5 cm long, to minimize stress on the plant.
    *   **Leaf Removal:** Remove old, yellowing, diseased, or damaged leaves, especially those touching the ground, to prevent disease spread and improve air circulation.
*   **Timing:** Pruning should be done regularly throughout the growing season, typically every 7-10 days, depending on the plant's growth rate.
*   **Tools:** Use clean, sharp secateurs or knives. Sterilize tools between plants to prevent disease transmission. A common sterilant is a 1% solution of **Sodium hypochlorite**.

**2. Desuckering**

Desuckering is an integral part of pruning, specifically referring to the removal of suckers (side shoots).

*   **Purpose:**
    *   To concentrate the plant's resources on the main stem(s) and developing fruits, rather than on excessive vegetative growth.
    *   To maintain the desired plant structure and spacing, especially in high-density planting systems.
    *   To improve air circulation within the canopy, which helps in reducing humidity and the risk of fungal diseases.
*   **Method:** Gently snap off or cut the young suckers that emerge from the leaf axils. It is best to remove them when they are small to minimize the wound size and plant stress.
*   **Timing:** Perform desuckering regularly, typically weekly, as part of the routine plant maintenance.

**3. Mulching**

Mulching is a highly beneficial practice for Capsicum, both in open fields and protected cultivation.

*   **Purpose:**
    *   **Weed Control:** Suppresses weed growth, reducing competition for water, nutrients, and light.
    *   **Moisture Conservation:** Reduces evaporation from the soil surface, thereby conserving soil moisture and reducing irrigation frequency.
    *   **Soil Temperature Regulation:** Helps maintain a more stable soil temperature, keeping it cooler in hot periods and warmer in cooler periods, which is beneficial for root development.
    *   **Soil Health:** Organic mulches decompose over time, adding organic matter and nutrients to the soil.
    *   **Disease Reduction:** Prevents soil splash onto lower leaves and fruits, reducing the incidence of soil-borne diseases.
    *   **Fruit Quality:** Keeps fruits clean and prevents direct contact with the soil.
*   **Types:**
    *   **Organic Mulches:** Materials like straw, dried leaves, sugarcane trash, or wood chips can be applied in a layer of 5-10 cm thickness around the base of the plants.
    *   **Plastic Mulches:** Black polyethylene film is commonly used for its excellent weed control and soil warming properties. Silver or white plastic mulches can reflect light, reduce soil temperature, and deter some insect pests. Lay plastic mulch before transplanting, making holes for the plants.
*   **Timing:** Apply mulch immediately after transplanting Capsicum seedlings.

**4. Grafting**

Grafting is an advanced technique gaining popularity in Capsicum cultivation, particularly for protected environments and areas with specific soil challenges.

*   **Purpose:**
    *   **Disease Resistance:** To impart resistance to soil-borne diseases (e.g., bacterial wilt, Fusarium wilt, Phytophthora blight, root-knot nematodes) by using resistant rootstocks. This is crucial in areas with high disease pressure or where crop rotation is limited.
    *   **Increased Vigour and Yield:** Grafted plants often exhibit enhanced vigour, better nutrient uptake, and higher yields due to the robust root system of the rootstock.
    *   **Stress Tolerance:** To improve tolerance to adverse soil conditions such as salinity, waterlogging, or extreme temperatures.
    *   **Extended Cropping Period:** Grafted plants tend to have a longer productive life.
*   **Method:**
    *   **Rootstock Selection:** Choose a vigorous Capsicum rootstock variety known for its resistance to prevalent soil-borne diseases and nematodes in your region.
    *   **Scion Selection:** Select a high-yielding, desired Capsicum variety for its fruit quality and market demand.
    *   **Grafting Techniques:** Common methods include splice grafting (tube grafting) or tongue grafting. Both rootstock and scion seedlings are grown to a similar stem diameter (typically 2-4 mm).
    *   **Procedure:**
        *   Make precise, clean cuts on both the rootstock and scion.
        *   Join the cut surfaces and secure them with grafting clips.
        *   Place the grafted plants in a high-humidity healing chamber (90-95% relative humidity, 25-28°C) for 7-10 days.
        *   Gradually acclimatize the healed grafts to normal growing conditions over several days.
*   **Considerations:** Grafting requires skill, specific environmental control during the healing phase, and can increase initial seedling costs.

**5. Pollination**

Pollination is essential for fruit set in Capsicum. Capsicum flowers are primarily self-pollinating, but assisted pollination can significantly improve fruit set, especially in protected cultivation.

*   **Nature of Pollination:** Capsicum flowers are perfect (contain both male and female parts) and are largely self-pollinating (autogamous). Wind and insects (like thrips and bees) can aid in cross-pollination, but it's not strictly necessary for fruit set.
*   **Factors Affecting Pollination and Fruit Set:**
    *   **Temperature:** Optimal temperatures for pollen viability and stigma receptivity are 20-30°C. Temperatures above 35°C or below 15°C can lead to poor pollen viability, stigma desiccation, and flower drop.
    *   **Humidity:** Very low humidity can dry out pollen and stigmas, while very high humidity can cause pollen to clump, preventing its release.
    *   **Light Intensity:** Adequate light is crucial for flower development and pollen production.
    *   **Nutrient Status:** Deficiencies, particularly of boron, can impair pollen germination and fruit set.
*   **Assisted Pollination (especially in Protected Cultivation):**
    *   **Vibration:** In polyhouses where natural wind movement is limited, gently tapping or shaking the plants (e.g., using an electric vibrator or by hand) daily during peak flowering can help release pollen and improve fruit set. This is typically done in the morning when pollen is most viable.
    *   **Air Circulation:** Ensuring good air circulation within polyhouses through proper ventilation helps in pollen dispersal.
    *   **Bumblebees:** For large-scale protected cultivation, introducing bumblebee colonies is a highly effective method to ensure efficient pollination and maximize fruit set. This is a specialized and costly practice but yields excellent results.
*   **Open Field:** In open field conditions, natural wind and insect activity usually provide sufficient pollination for good fruit set.
