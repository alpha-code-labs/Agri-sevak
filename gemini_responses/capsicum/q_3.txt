Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I understand the significant challenges posed by various rot diseases in Capsicum cultivation. Effective management requires an integrated approach combining cultural practices, resistant varieties, and judicious use of CIBRC-approved fungicides.

Many of the "rot" types you've mentioned are caused by a similar group of soil-borne and foliar pathogens, primarily Oomycetes (*Phytophthora*, *Pythium*) and Fungi (*Rhizoctonia*, *Fusarium*, *Sclerotium*, *Colletotrichum*, *Alternaria*). Therefore, control measures often overlap.

**General Integrated Disease Management (IDM) Principles for Rot Control in Capsicum:**

1.  **Site Selection & Soil Preparation:**
    *   Choose well-drained fields. Avoid low-lying areas prone to waterlogging.
    *   Practice deep ploughing and soil solarization during hot summer months (4-6 weeks) to reduce pathogen inoculum.
    *   Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost.

2.  **Crop Rotation:**
    *   Avoid planting Capsicum or other solanaceous crops (tomato, brinjal, potato) in the same field for at least 3-4 years. Rotate with non-host crops like maize, wheat, or legumes.

3.  **Resistant Varieties:**
    *   Where available, select Capsicum varieties known for resistance or tolerance to common rot pathogens, especially *Phytophthora capsici*.

4.  **Nursery Management:**
    *   Use sterilized potting mix or soil for raising seedlings.
    *   Ensure proper spacing and ventilation in the nursery to prevent humidity build-up.
    *   Avoid overwatering.

5.  **Field Sanitation:**
    *   Remove and destroy infected plant debris, fruits, and weeds promptly.
    *   Clean tools and equipment regularly.

6.  **Water Management:**
    *   Use drip irrigation to avoid wetting foliage and stems, which reduces disease spread.
    *   Avoid overhead irrigation, especially during evening hours.
    *   Ensure proper drainage in the field.

7.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Maintain balanced nutrition. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can lead to lush growth susceptible to disease.

**Specific Control Measures for Rot Types in Capsicum:**

Many of these rot types are caused by similar pathogens and thus share control strategies.

### 1. Seed Rot & Seedling Rot (Damping-off)

These are critical in the nursery stage, primarily caused by *Pythium* spp., *Phytophthora* spp., *Rhizoctonia solani*, and *Fusarium* spp.

*   **Seed Treatment:**
    *   Treat seeds with a combination of fungicides:
        *   **Thiram** (2-3 g/kg seed) + **Carbendazim** (1 g/kg seed)
        *   **Metalaxyl-M** (0.5-1 g/kg seed) for oomycetes.
        *   Alternatively, use a biological agent: **Trichoderma viride** (4-5 g/kg seed).
*   **Nursery Soil Drench (Pre-sowing or immediately after sowing):**
    *   Drench the nursery beds with:
        *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride** (2-3 ml/L water)
        *   **Metalaxyl-M + Mancozeb** (2-2.5 g/L water)
        *   **Copper oxychloride** (2.5-3 g/L water)
        *   **Trichoderma viride** (2.5 kg/acre mixed with 50 kg FYM, applied to soil).

### 2. Root Rot, Stem Rot, Foot Rot, Collar Rot, Crown Rot

These are often caused by *Phytophthora capsici*, *Pythium* spp., *Rhizoctonia solani*, *Sclerotium rolfsii*, and *Fusarium* spp. They affect the plant at or below the soil line, leading to wilting and plant death.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Ensure good drainage. Plant on raised beds.
    *   Avoid injury to roots and stems during intercultural operations.
    *   Remove and destroy infected plants immediately.
*   **Chemical Control (Soil Drench around the plant base):**
    *   At the first sign of symptoms, or as a prophylactic measure in endemic areas:
        *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride** (2-3 ml/L water)
        *   **Metalaxyl-M + Mancozeb** (2-2.5 g/L water)
        *   **Fosetyl-aluminium** (2-2.5 g/L water)
        *   **Copper oxychloride** (2.5-3 g/L water)
        *   For *Rhizoctonia* and *Sclerotium* specific issues:
            *   **Validamycin** (2-3 ml/L water)
            *   **Pencycuron** (0.5-1 g/L water)
            *   **Carbendazim** (0.5-1 g/L water)
    *   Repeat drenching at 10-15 day intervals if conditions are favorable for disease development.

### 3. Neck Rot

Neck rot in Capsicum is not a distinct disease but rather a symptom that can be part of stem rot, collar rot, or fruit rot depending on the affected part (stem neck or fruit neck). Control measures for stem/collar rot or fruit rot would apply.

### 4. Black Rot

This is not known to affect Capsicum as a specific disease name. The term "Black Rot" is commonly associated with crucifers (caused by *Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris*) or grapes (*Guignardia bidwellii*). However, several fungal and bacterial diseases can cause blackening and rotting of Capsicum fruits or stems. If referring to fruit blackening, it could be due to *Phytophthora* fruit rot, anthracnose, or secondary bacterial infections. If referring to stem blackening, it could be part of stem rot or blight. Please refer to the control measures for Fruit Rot or Stem Rot accordingly.

### 5. Fruit Rot

Fruit rots are caused by various pathogens, including *Phytophthora capsici* (Phytophthora blight/fruit rot), *Colletotrichum* spp. (anthracnose), *Alternaria* spp., and *Botrytis cinerea* (grey mould).

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Avoid overhead irrigation.
    *   Ensure proper plant spacing for good air circulation.
    *   Stake plants to keep fruits off the ground.
    *   Harvest fruits carefully to avoid injury.
    *   Remove and destroy infected fruits promptly.
*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
    *   Start spraying protectively during flowering and fruit set, especially if conditions are humid and wet.
    *   For *Phytophthora* fruit rot:
        *   **Fosetyl-aluminium** (2-2.5 g/L water)
        *   **Metalaxyl-M + Mancozeb** (2-2.5 g/L water)
        *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride** (2-3 ml/L water)
    *   For broad-spectrum control (including anthracnose, *Alternaria*):
        *   **Mancozeb** (2-2.5 g/L water)
        *   **Chlorothalonil** (2 g/L water)
        *   **Azoxystrobin** (0.5-1 ml/L water)
        *   **Pyraclostrobin + Metiram** (2-2.5 g/L water)
        *   **Propineb** (2-2.5 g/L water)
        *   **Copper oxychloride** (2.5-3 g/L water)
    *   For specific anthracnose control:
        *   **Difenoconazole** (0.5 ml/L water)
        *   **Tebuconazole** (0.75-1 ml/L water)
    *   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label for correct dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) for all applied chemicals to ensure food safety.
*   For specific recommendations tailored to your exact field conditions, it is always advisable to consult with local agricultural extension specialists.

By implementing these integrated strategies, you can effectively manage rot diseases and ensure a healthy Capsicum crop.
