As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified fertilizer schedule for Capsicum (Bell Pepper) cultivation in Haryana. Please note that these are general recommendations, and a soil test is highly advisable for precise nutrient management tailored to your specific field conditions.

**General Nutrient Requirements for Capsicum (Open Field):**
For optimal yield and quality, Capsicum typically requires:
*   Nitrogen (N): 120-150 kg/acre
*   Phosphorus (P2O5): 60-80 kg/acre
*   Potassium (K2O): 60-80 kg/acre
*   Sulphur (S): 20-30 kg/acre

**Recommended Fertilizer Doses and Application Schedule:**

**1. Basal Application (at the time of transplanting):**
These fertilizers should be thoroughly mixed into the soil before transplanting the Capsicum seedlings.

*   **DAP (Diammonium Phosphate):** 130-175 kg/acre
    *   *(This provides approximately 23-31.5 kg N and 60-80 kg P2O5)*
    *   **OR**
*   **SSP (Single Superphosphate):** 375-500 kg/acre
    *   *(This provides approximately 60-80 kg P2O5 and 41-55 kg S. If using SSP, the separate Sulphur application may be reduced or omitted based on soil test.)*
*   **Muriate of Potash (Potassium Chloride):** 50-70 kg/acre
    *   *(This provides approximately 30-42 kg K2O)*
*   **Sulphur (Elemental Sulphur 90%):** 20-30 kg/acre
    *   *(Apply if DAP is used as the primary P source, or if soil test indicates Sulphur deficiency. If SSP is used, this dose can be reduced or skipped.)*

**2. Top-dressing (Split Applications):**
Nitrogen and remaining Potassium should be applied in split doses to ensure continuous nutrient availability throughout the crop's growth cycle.

*   **First Top-dressing (30-45 Days After Transplanting - DAT):**
    *   **Urea:** 100-135 kg/acre
    *   **Muriate of Potash (Potassium Chloride):** 50-70 kg/acre
*   **Second Top-dressing (60-75 DAT, at flowering/early fruit set):**
    *   **Urea:** 100-135 kg/acre

**3. Nano-Fertilizers (Foliar Application - Supplementary):**
Nano-fertilizers are excellent for supplementing nutrient requirements and improving nutrient use efficiency, especially during critical growth stages or stress conditions. They are not a replacement for basal and top-dressed conventional fertilizers.

*   **Nano-Urea (Liquid Fertilizer):** 2-4 ml/L of water
    *   Apply 2-3 sprays starting from 30-45 DAT at 15-20 day intervals.
*   **Nano-DAP (Liquid Fertilizer):** 2-4 ml/L of water
    *   Apply 2-3 sprays, particularly during flowering and fruit development stages.

**4. NPK Complex Fertilizers:**
If you prefer to use NPK complex fertilizers (e.g., NPK 12:32:16, NPK 10:26:26), ensure that the total N, P2O5, and K2O supplied by these fertilizers align with the recommended nutrient doses. You will need to calculate the nutrient contribution from the complex fertilizer and supplement any deficit with individual fertilizers like **Urea** or **Muriate of Potash**. For example, if using NPK 12:32:16, it provides N, P, and K in a fixed ratio, and you would adjust the basal application accordingly, then top-dress with **Urea** and **Muriate of Potash** as needed.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Soil Testing:** The most accurate fertilizer recommendation comes from a comprehensive soil test. HAU recommends getting your soil tested every 2-3 years to understand its nutrient status and pH, allowing for precise and efficient fertilizer application.
*   **Organic Manures:** Incorporating well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost (10-15 tonnes/acre) during land preparation significantly improves soil health, water retention, and nutrient availability, reducing the need for chemical fertilizers.
*   **Irrigation:** Ensure adequate and timely irrigation, especially after fertilizer application, to facilitate nutrient uptake by the plants.
*   **Micronutrients:** Capsicum also requires micronutrients like Zinc, Boron, Iron, Manganese, and Copper. If soil tests indicate deficiencies, apply appropriate micronutrient formulations as per recommendations.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure healthy growth and maximize the yield and quality of your Capsicum crop in Haryana.
