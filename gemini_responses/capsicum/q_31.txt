As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling physical damage in Capsicum, keeping in mind the conditions prevalent in Haryana.

### Control of Physical Damage in Capsicum

**1. Fruit Bursting (Cracking)**

Fruit bursting in Capsicum is primarily a physiological disorder caused by sudden fluctuations in moisture availability and nutrient imbalances, leading to uneven growth between the fruit pulp and skin.

*   **Consistent Irrigation:** Maintain uniform soil moisture. Avoid prolonged dry spells followed by heavy irrigation or rainfall. Drip irrigation is highly recommended as it provides water directly to the root zone, minimizing fluctuations.
*   **Mulching:** Apply organic mulch (e.g., straw, paddy husk) around the base of plants. This helps conserve soil moisture, regulate soil temperature, and reduce evaporation, thereby stabilizing moisture levels.
*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Ensure adequate Calcium (Ca) supply. Calcium is crucial for cell wall integrity and elasticity. Conduct soil testing to determine calcium levels. If deficient, apply **Calcium nitrate** (15.5-0-0-18.8 Ca) as a foliar spray at 5 g/L or through fertigation.
    *   Ensure sufficient Boron (B). Boron aids in calcium uptake and cell wall formation. If deficient, apply **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (20% B) as a foliar spray at 1-1.5 g/L.
*   **Shade Nets:** In areas with intense sunlight and high temperatures, installing 30-50% shade nets can reduce heat stress and help maintain more stable environmental conditions around the plants, reducing the likelihood of cracking.
*   **Variety Selection:** Choose Capsicum varieties known for their resistance to fruit cracking.

**2. Leaf Burning/Melting (Sunscald/Heat Stress)**

Leaf burning or melting is often a symptom of sunscald or heat stress, exacerbated by water stress or improper chemical application.

*   **Adequate and Consistent Irrigation:** Ensure plants receive sufficient water, especially during hot periods and peak sunlight hours. Water stress makes leaves more susceptible to sunscald.
*   **Shade Nets:** Use 30-50% shade nets during periods of intense summer heat (April-June in Haryana) to protect plants from direct, harsh sunlight and reduce leaf temperature.
*   **Proper Chemical Application:**
    *   Always follow recommended dosages and application timings for pesticides and foliar fertilizers.
    *   Avoid spraying chemicals during the hottest part of the day (11 AM - 4 PM) when temperatures are high and humidity is low, as this can lead to phytotoxicity (chemical burn).
    *   Ensure proper mixing and compatibility of chemicals.
*   **Nutrient Balance:** Avoid excessive application of certain nutrients (e.g., urea) that can make plants more succulent and susceptible to burning, or cause salt burn. Conduct soil testing for balanced fertilization.
*   **Plant Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to allow for good air circulation, which can help dissipate heat.

**3. Hardness in Fruit**

"Hardness" in Capsicum fruit can refer to an undesirable tough texture, often linked to environmental stress during fruit development or improper harvesting.

*   **Optimal Harvesting Stage:** Harvest fruits at their appropriate maturity stage. Immature fruits will be hard, while over-mature fruits left on the plant under stress can also develop a tough texture.
*   **Consistent Water and Nutrient Supply:** Maintain consistent soil moisture and provide balanced nutrition throughout the fruit development period. Stress (water deficit, nutrient deficiency/excess) can negatively impact fruit quality and texture.
*   **Temperature Management:** Extreme high temperatures during fruit development can affect cell expansion and lead to firmer, sometimes tougher, fruit texture. Using shade nets can help mitigate this.
*   **Potassium (K) Management:** Adequate potassium is essential for fruit development, size, and quality. Ensure sufficient potassium supply based on soil test recommendations. **Potassium nitrate** (13-0-45) can be applied as a foliar spray at 5 g/L or through fertigation.
*   **Variety Selection:** Choose Capsicum varieties known for their desirable fruit texture and quality under local growing conditions.
