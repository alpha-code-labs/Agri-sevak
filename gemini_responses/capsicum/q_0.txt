As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Capsicum in Haryana.

It is crucial to implement an Integrated Disease Management (IDM) approach, combining cultural practices with judicious use of CIBRC-approved fungicides.

**General Cultural Practices for Fungal Disease Management:**

*   **Resistant Varieties:** Whenever possible, choose Capsicum varieties known to be resistant or tolerant to common fungal diseases.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-solanaceous crops for at least 2-3 years to break disease cycles.
*   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris from the field. Keep the field free of weeds, which can act as alternate hosts.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to improve air circulation and reduce humidity within the canopy, discouraging fungal growth.
*   **Water Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day, to minimize leaf wetness. Drip irrigation is preferred. Ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Provide balanced nutrition to plants, as stressed plants are more susceptible to diseases.

Here's how to control the specific fungal diseases you mentioned:

### 1. Alternaria (Early Blight / Target Spot)

This disease is caused by *Alternaria solani* or *Alternaria alternata* and is common in Capsicum, especially under warm, humid conditions.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural:** Use disease-free seeds, practice crop rotation, and remove infected plant debris.
*   **Chemical:**
    *   **Mancozeb 75% WP:** 2.5 g/L of water
    *   **Chlorothalonil 75% WP:** 2 g/L of water
    *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:** 0.5-1 ml/L of water
    *   **Pyraclostrobin 12.8% + Metiram 55% WG:** 2-2.5 g/L of water
    *   **Difenoconazole 25% EC:** 0.5 ml/L of water

### 2. Anthracnose

Caused by *Colletotrichum capsici* and *C. gloeosporioides*, Anthracnose affects fruits, leaves, and stems, especially during warm, wet weather.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural:** Use disease-free seeds, practice good field sanitation, avoid overhead irrigation, and ensure proper plant spacing.
*   **Chemical:**
    *   **Carbendazim 50% WP:** 1 g/L of water
    *   **Mancozeb 75% WP:** 2.5 g/L of water
    *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:** 0.5-1 ml/L of water
    *   **Pyraclostrobin 12.8% + Metiram 55% WG:** 2-2.5 g/L of water
    *   **Thiophanate Methyl 70% WP:** 1 g/L of water

### 3. Blast

This is not known to affect Capsicum.

### 4. Blight (e.g., Phytophthora Blight, Late Blight)

While Alternaria causes Early Blight (addressed above), other significant blights in Capsicum include Phytophthora Blight (*Phytophthora capsici*) and Late Blight (*Phytophthora infestans*). These are particularly destructive under wet and humid conditions.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural:** Ensure excellent field drainage, avoid waterlogging, use raised beds, and practice crop rotation.
*   **Chemical (for Phytophthora Blight / Late Blight):**
    *   **Propamocarb Hydrochloride 72.2% SL:** 2-3 ml/L of water
    *   **Cymoxanil 8% + Mancozeb 64% WP:** 2.5 g/L of water
    *   **Fenamidone 10% + Propamocarb Hydrochloride 37.5% SC:** 2 ml/L of water
    *   **Fluopicolide 6.25% + Propamocarb Hydrochloride 62.5% SC:** 2 ml/L of water
    *   **Mancozeb 75% WP:** 2.5 g/L of water (as a protectant)

### 5. Brown Spot (e.g., Cercospora Leaf Spot, Alternaria Leaf Spot)

Brown spots on Capsicum leaves can be caused by various fungi, including *Cercospora capsici* (Cercospora Leaf Spot) and *Alternaria* species.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural:** Practice good field sanitation, remove infected leaves, and ensure proper plant spacing.
*   **Chemical:**
    *   **Mancozeb 75% WP:** 2.5 g/L of water
    *   **Chlorothalonil 75% WP:** 2 g/L of water
    *   **Carbendazim 50% WP:** 1 g/L of water
    *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:** 0.5-1 ml/L of water

### 6. Downy Mildew

This is not known to affect Capsicum.

### 7. Powdery Mildew

Caused by fungi like *Leveillula taurica* and *Oidium neolycopersici*, Powdery Mildew appears as white, powdery patches on leaves, stems, and sometimes fruits.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural:** Ensure good air circulation around plants and avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization.
*   **Chemical:**
    *   **Sulphur 80% WP:** 2-3 g/L of water (effective at temperatures below 30°C)
    *   **Myclobutanil 10% WP:** 0.4-0.5 g/L of water
    *   **Penconazole 10% EC:** 0.5 ml/L of water
    *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:** 0.5-1 ml/L of water
    *   **Difenoconazole 25% EC:** 0.5 ml/L of water

### 8. Grey Mildew

This is not known to affect Capsicum. (Note: Grey Mould, caused by *Botrytis cinerea*, is a different disease that can affect Capsicum, but "Grey mildew" as a distinct disease is not recognized for Capsicum.)

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the label instructions for any pesticide product, including dosage, application timing, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in fungal populations.
*   Regular scouting of your crop is essential to detect diseases early and initiate timely control measures.
