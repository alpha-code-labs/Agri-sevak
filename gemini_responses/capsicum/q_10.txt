As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in Capsicum in Haryana:

It is crucial to adopt an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods for sustainable and effective pest control.

### General IPM Principles for Lepidopteran Pests in Capsicum:

*   **Monitoring:** Regularly scout fields for egg masses, larvae, and adult moths. Use pheromone traps for monitoring adult moth populations (e.g., *Helicoverpa armigera*, *Spodoptera litura*) to time interventions effectively.
*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Field sanitation: Remove and destroy crop residues after harvest.
    *   Deep ploughing: Exposes pupae to predators and sunlight.
    *   Hand picking: Collect and destroy egg masses and early instar larvae, especially in small holdings.
    *   Installation of bird perches: Attracts predatory birds.
*   **Biological Control:** Utilize natural enemies like parasitoids and predators.

### Specific Pest Control Measures:

#### 1. Borers (Primarily Fruit Borers like *Helicoverpa armigera* and *Spodoptera litura*)

These caterpillars bore into the developing fruits, causing significant damage.

*   **Biological Control:**
    *   Release of **Trichogramma chilonis** (egg parasitoid) @ 50,000-100,000 adults per acre, 3-4 releases at weekly intervals, starting from the flowering stage.
    *   Application of **Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki** (Bt) @ 1-2 kg/acre or 1-2 g/L of water, especially effective against early instar larvae.
    *   Application of **Nuclear Polyhedrosis Virus (NPV)** specific to *Helicoverpa armigera* (HaNPV) @ 250-500 LE (Larval Equivalents) per acre.
*   **Chemical Control (Spray volume: 200-400 L/acre depending on crop canopy):**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC @ 60 ml/acre (0.3 ml/L).
    *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG @ 80 g/acre (0.4 g/L).
    *   **Flubendiamide** 20% WG @ 100 g/acre (0.5 g/L).
    *   **Indoxacarb** 14.5% SC @ 200 ml/acre (1 ml/L).

#### 2. Caterpillars (Leaf-eating caterpillars like *Spodoptera litura*, *Spodoptera exigua*, and also fruit borers)

These caterpillars feed on leaves, flowers, and fruits.

*   **Biological Control:**
    *   Application of **Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki** (Bt) @ 1-2 kg/acre or 1-2 g/L of water.
    *   Application of **Nuclear Polyhedrosis Virus (NPV)** specific to *Spodoptera litura* (SlNPV) @ 250-500 LE per acre.
*   **Chemical Control (Spray volume: 200-400 L/acre depending on crop canopy):**
    *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG @ 80 g/acre (0.4 g/L).
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC @ 60 ml/acre (0.3 ml/L).
    *   **Flubendiamide** 20% WG @ 100 g/acre (0.5 g/L).
    *   **Indoxacarb** 14.5% SC @ 200 ml/acre (1 ml/L).
    *   **Lufenuron** 5.4% EC @ 300 ml/acre (1.5 ml/L).
    *   **Novaluron** 10% EC @ 300 ml/acre (1.5 ml/L).

#### 3. Diamondback moth (*Plutella xylostella*)

This is not known to affect Capsicum. Diamondback moth is a major pest primarily of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower, mustard).

#### 4. Leaf folder

This is not known to affect Capsicum as a specific or significant pest. While some generalist caterpillars might occasionally cause minor leaf folding, there isn't a distinct "leaf folder" pest of economic importance in Capsicum. Control measures for general caterpillars would address any such incidental damage.
