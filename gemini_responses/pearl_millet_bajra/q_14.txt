Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling soil pests like termites and nematodes in Pearl Millet (Bajra) in Haryana. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is always the recommended approach, combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods.

### 1. Control of Termites (Deemak) in Pearl Millet (Bajra)

Termites can cause significant damage to Bajra, especially during the seedling stage and later by hollowing out stems.

**A. Cultural and Preventive Measures:**
*   **Deep Ploughing:** Ploughing fields deeply during summer exposes termite queens and colonies to the sun, destroying them.
*   **Removal of Crop Residues:** Remove and destroy old stubble and crop residues that can serve as food sources and breeding grounds for termites.
*   **Destruction of Mounds:** Locate and destroy termite mounds in and around the field.
*   **Timely Sowing:** Ensure timely sowing to allow plants to establish well before severe termite infestation.

**B. Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved):**
*   **Seed Treatment:**
    *   Treat seeds before sowing with **Imidacloprid 600 FS** at 4-6 ml per kg of seed. This provides early protection against termites and sucking pests.
*   **Soil Application:**
    *   At the time of sowing or before, apply **Fipronil 0.3% GR** at 10-15 kg per acre, mixed with soil or broadcast evenly.
    *   Alternatively, for standing crops, if infestation is observed, drenching near the plant base can be done with **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** at 2.5 litres per acre mixed in sufficient water (e.g., 500 litres) for drenching.

### 2. Control of Nematodes (Root-knot Nematodes - Jad Ganth Kripmi) in Pearl Millet (Bajra)

Root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.) can cause galls on roots, leading to stunted growth, yellowing, and reduced yield in Bajra.

**A. Cultural and Preventive Measures:**
*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate Bajra with non-host crops like sorghum, marigold, or sunnhemp (which can be incorporated as green manure) to reduce nematode populations in the soil.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available, choose Bajra varieties known to have resistance or tolerance to root-knot nematodes.
*   **Summer Ploughing:** Deep summer ploughing exposes nematode eggs and larvae to heat and desiccation, reducing their numbers.
*   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost, and especially neem cake, into the soil at 100-200 kg per acre. Neem cake has nematicidal properties.
*   **Solarization:** In small plots, soil solarization (covering moist soil with clear plastic sheets during hot summer months) can effectively reduce nematode populations.

**B. Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved):**
*   Chemical control for nematodes in field crops like Bajra is often considered a last resort due to cost and environmental concerns, with cultural practices being highly preferred. However, if severe infestation warrants chemical intervention:
    *   Apply **Carbofuran 3% GR** at 10-13 kg per acre at the time of sowing, by broadcasting and incorporating into the soil.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) while handling and applying chemicals.
*   Ensure proper calibration of equipment for accurate dosage.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions.

By adopting these integrated strategies, you can effectively manage soil pests in your Pearl Millet crop and ensure a healthy yield.
