As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Pearl Millet (Bajra) in Haryana.

**General Management Practices for Fungal Diseases in Pearl Millet:**
Before discussing specific diseases, it is crucial to adopt integrated disease management strategies:

*   **Resistant Varieties:** Always choose disease-resistant or tolerant varieties recommended for Haryana. This is the most effective and economical control measure, especially for Downy Mildew.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops (e.g., legumes, non-cereal crops) to break the disease cycle and reduce inoculum build-up in the soil.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected crop debris after harvest to reduce the primary inoculum for the next season.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Apply balanced fertilizers based on soil test recommendations. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can make plants more susceptible to certain fungal diseases.
*   **Optimum Plant Spacing:** Maintain recommended plant spacing to ensure good air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce humidity and fungal growth.
*   **Timely Sowing:** Sow at the recommended time to avoid periods of high disease pressure and ensure vigorous plant growth.

**Specific Disease Management:**

1.  **Alternaria Leaf Spot (Alternaria spp.)**
    This disease causes small, dark brown spots on leaves, which can enlarge, coalesce, and lead to premature leaf drying.
    *   **Foliar Spray:**
        *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP at 800 g per acre (mixed in 200-300 L of water).
        *   **Propiconazole** 25% EC at 200 ml per acre (mixed in 200-300 L of water).
        *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC at 200 ml per acre (mixed in 200-300 L of water).

2.  **Anthracnose**
    This is not known to affect Pearl Millet (Bajra) as a significant disease.

3.  **Blast (Magnaporthe grisea / Pyricularia grisea)**
    Blast causes characteristic spindle-shaped lesions on leaves, often with grey centers and dark margins. It can also affect nodes and panicles, leading to neck blast and grain loss.
    *   **Foliar Spray:**
        *   **Tebuconazole** 250 EW at 300 ml per acre (mixed in 200-300 L of water).
        *   **Tricyclazole** 75% WP at 120 g per acre (mixed in 200-300 L of water).
        *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC at 200 ml per acre (mixed in 200-300 L of water).
        *   **Propiconazole** 25% EC at 200 ml per acre (mixed in 200-300 L of water).

4.  **Blight (e.g., Curvularia Leaf Blight, Helminthosporium Leaf Blight)**
    Blights cause large, irregular necrotic lesions on leaves, leading to premature drying and reduced photosynthetic area.
    *   **Foliar Spray:**
        *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP at 800 g per acre (mixed in 200-300 L of water).
        *   **Propiconazole** 25% EC at 200 ml per acre (mixed in 200-300 L of water).
        *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC at 200 ml per acre (mixed in 200-300 L of water).

5.  **Brown Spot (Bipolaris spp., Cochliobolus spp.)**
    Causes small, circular to oval, reddish-brown spots on leaves, which can expand and lead to leaf senescence.
    *   **Foliar Spray:**
        *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP at 800 g per acre (mixed in 200-300 L of water).
        *   **Propiconazole** 25% EC at 200 ml per acre (mixed in 200-300 L of water).
        *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC at 200 ml per acre (mixed in 200-300 L of water).

6.  **Downy Mildew (Sclerospora graminicola)**
    This is the most destructive disease of Pearl Millet in Haryana. Symptoms include chlorotic streaks on leaves, "green ear" malformation (where the ear turns into a leafy structure), and stunted plant growth.
    *   **Seed Treatment (Crucial for prevention):**
        *   **Metalaxyl-M** 31.8% ES at 2 ml per kg of seed.
        *   **Metalaxyl-M + Mancozeb** (e.g., 35% WS formulation) at 6 g per kg of seed.
    *   **Foliar Spray (if disease appears despite seed treatment, or for susceptible varieties under high disease pressure):**
        *   **Metalaxyl-M + Mancozeb** (e.g., 64% WP formulation) at 1 kg per acre (mixed in 200-300 L of water).
        *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP at 800 g per acre (mixed in 200-300 L of water).

7.  **Powdery Mildew**
    This is not known to affect Pearl Millet (Bajra).

8.  **Grey Mildew**
    This is not known to affect Pearl Millet (Bajra).

**Important Note:** Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully, including dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest intervals. Consult your local agricultural extension officer for the most current and specific recommendations for your region and specific Pearl Millet variety.
