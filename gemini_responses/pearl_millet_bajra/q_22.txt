As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following cultivation practices for Pearl Millet (Bajra) in Haryana:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   **Drilling in rows** is highly recommended for uniform plant stand, efficient weed management, and ease of inter-cultivation. This method ensures proper seed placement and depth.
    *   Broadcasting is generally discouraged as it leads to uneven plant distribution and higher seed rates.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   The optimal planting depth for Pearl Millet seeds is **2.5 to 3.0 cm**. Shallow planting ensures quick and uniform emergence, as deep planting can hinder seedling establishment.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   **Row-to-row spacing:** Maintain a distance of **45 to 60 cm** between rows. This allows for proper light penetration, air circulation, and facilitates inter-cultivation operations.
    *   **Plant-to-plant spacing:** After thinning (usually 2-3 weeks after sowing), maintain a distance of **10 to 15 cm** between plants within a row. This ensures an optimal plant population for maximum yield.

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   For grain production using the drilling method, a seed dose of **4 to 5 kg/acre** is recommended.
    *   If Pearl Millet is being cultivated for fodder purposes, a higher seed dose of **8 to 10 kg/acre** is generally used.
