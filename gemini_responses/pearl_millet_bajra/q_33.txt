As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an integrated approach to weed management in Pearl Millet (Bajra) for effective and sustainable control. This combines cultural, mechanical, and chemical methods.

**General Weed Management for Broadleaf and Narrowleaf Weeds in Pearl Millet:**

1.  **Cultural and Mechanical Methods:**
    *   **Seedbed Preparation:** Ensure a fine and firm seedbed to promote uniform crop emergence and reduce weed competition.
    *   **Clean Seed:** Use certified, weed-free Pearl Millet seeds to prevent the introduction of new weed species.
    *   **Optimum Plant Density:** Maintain recommended plant spacing and density to allow the crop to compete effectively with weeds.
    *   **Inter-cultivation/Hand Weeding:** Perform 1-2 hand weedings or inter-cultivations (hoeing) at 15-20 and 30-35 days after sowing (DAS) to remove weeds physically.

2.  **Chemical Control (Herbicide Application):**
    *   **Pre-emergence Herbicides (Apply within 0-3 days after sowing, before weed emergence):**
        *   **For Broadleaf and some Grassy Weeds:**
            *   **Atrazine** 50% WP at 1.0 kg product per acre (0.5 kg active ingredient per acre) in 200-300 L of water.
            *   **Oxyfluorfen** 23.5% EC at 0.4 L product per acre (0.094 kg active ingredient per acre) in 200-300 L of water.
        *   **For Grassy and some Broadleaf Weeds:**
            *   **Pendimethalin** 30% EC at 1.3 L product per acre (0.39 kg active ingredient per acre) in 200-300 L of water.

    *   **Post-emergence Herbicides (Apply when weeds are at 2-4 leaf stage, typically 15-30 DAS):**
        *   **For Broadleaf Weeds (e.g., Bathu, Congress grass, general broadleaf weeds):**
            *   **2,4-D Sodium salt** 80% WP at 0.5 kg product per acre (0.4 kg active ingredient per acre) in 200-300 L of water. Apply when Pearl Millet is at the 3-4 leaf stage.
            *   **Atrazine** 50% WP at 0.5 kg product per acre (0.25 kg active ingredient per acre) in 200-300 L of water. Apply when Pearl Millet is at the 2-3 leaf stage.
        *   **For Grassy Weeds (e.g., general narrowleaf weeds):**
            *   **Topramezone** 33.6% SC at 75 ml product per acre (25.2 g active ingredient per acre) along with a recommended surfactant, in 200-300 L of water.
            *   **Haloxyfop-P-methyl** 10.5% EC at 0.5-0.75 L product per acre (0.05-0.075 kg active ingredient per acre) in 200-300 L of water.
            *   **Fenoxaprop-P-ethyl** 9% EC at 0.5-0.67 L product per acre (0.045-0.06 kg active ingredient per acre) in 200-300 L of water.

**Specific Weed Control Recommendations:**

*   **Amarbail (Cuscuta spp.):**
    *   Prevention is key: Use clean, certified seeds and avoid planting in fields with a history of severe Amarbail infestation.
    *   Pre-emergence application of **Pendimethalin** 30% EC at 1.3 L product per acre can offer some suppression.
    *   Manual removal of Amarbail patches, along with the host Pearl Millet plants, is crucial before the parasite sets seed.

*   **Bathu (Chenopodium album):**
    *   This broadleaf weed is effectively controlled by pre-emergence application of **Atrazine** 50% WP or post-emergence application of **2,4-D Sodium salt** 80% WP or **Atrazine** 50% WP, as detailed above for broadleaf weeds.

*   **Congress grass (Parthenium hysterophorus):**
    *   This broadleaf weed is effectively controlled by pre-emergence application of **Atrazine** 50% WP or post-emergence application of **2,4-D Sodium salt** 80% WP or **Atrazine** 50% WP, as detailed above for broadleaf weeds.
    *   Manual removal of Congress grass plants before flowering is highly recommended to prevent seed dispersal and reduce future infestations.

*   **Orobanche:**
    *   This is not known to affect Pearl Millet (Bajra). Orobanche species are typically parasitic on dicotyledonous crops.

*   **Phalaris minor:**
    *   This is not known to affect Pearl Millet (Bajra). Phalaris minor is primarily a weed of winter (Rabi) crops, especially wheat.

**General Precautions:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the herbicide label carefully.
*   Use appropriate safety gear (gloves, mask, protective clothing) during herbicide application.
*   Ensure proper calibration of spray equipment for uniform application.
*   Avoid spraying during windy conditions to prevent drift.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension specialists for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions.
