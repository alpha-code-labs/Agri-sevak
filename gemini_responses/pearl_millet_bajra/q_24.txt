As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for Pearl Millet (Bajra) transplantation in Haryana:

While Pearl Millet (Bajra) is predominantly direct-sown, transplantation can be a viable option, especially for hybrid seed production, managing delayed monsoon, or achieving uniform stand establishment.

**1. Ideal Transplantation Time:**
*   **Nursery Sowing:** Mid-June to early July.
*   **Transplanting:** When seedlings are 2-3 weeks old, typically from mid-July to early August. This timing allows the crop to benefit from the monsoon rains and complete its life cycle before the onset of cooler temperatures.

**2. Ideal Transplantation Distance:**
*   **Row-to-Row:** 45-60 cm
*   **Plant-to-Plant:** 10-15 cm
*   This spacing ensures adequate light penetration, air circulation, and nutrient availability for optimal plant growth and yield.

**3. Ideal Transplantation Process:**

*   **Nursery Preparation:**
    *   Select a well-drained, fertile plot, free from weeds.
    *   Prepare raised beds (approximately 1 meter wide, 15-20 cm high, and of convenient length).
    *   Incorporate well-decomposed Farmyard Manure (FYM) or compost (10-15 kg per 10 square meters of nursery area).
    *   Sow Pearl Millet seeds thinly in lines 10-15 cm apart, at a depth of 1-2 cm.
    *   Cover the seeds with a thin layer of soil and irrigate lightly using a rose can.
    *   A seed rate of 1.5-2 kg is generally sufficient to raise seedlings for one acre of the main field.

*   **Seedling Care:**
    *   Maintain adequate moisture in the nursery beds.
    *   Seedlings will be ready for transplanting in 2-3 weeks when they have developed 3-4 leaves and are about 15-20 cm tall.

*   **Main Field Preparation:**
    *   Prepare the main field thoroughly by ploughing and harrowing to achieve a fine, friable tilth.
    *   Incorporate 8-10 tonnes of well-decomposed FYM or compost per acre during land preparation.
    *   Level the field and prepare it for irrigation.

*   **Transplanting:**
    *   Irrigate the nursery bed a few hours before uprooting the seedlings to facilitate easy removal and minimize root damage.
    *   Carefully uproot the seedlings, ensuring minimal injury to the root system.
    *   Transplant one seedling per hill in the main field at the recommended spacing (45-60 cm row-to-row and 10-15 cm plant-to-plant).
    *   Ensure the seedlings are planted at the same depth as they were in the nursery.
    *   Transplanting is best done in the evening or on a cloudy day to reduce transplanting shock.

*   **Post-Transplanting Care:**
    *   Irrigate the field immediately after transplanting to help the seedlings establish.
    *   Perform gap filling (replanting missing seedlings) within 5-7 days of transplanting to maintain the desired plant population.
    *   Manage weeds and other cultural operations as per standard practices for Pearl Millet.
