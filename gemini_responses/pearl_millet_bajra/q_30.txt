As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I will provide scientifically verified advice for managing growth issues in Pearl Millet (Bajra) in Haryana.

### Management of Growth Issues in Pearl Millet (Bajra)

**1. Slow Growth**

Slow growth in Pearl Millet can be attributed to various factors including nutrient deficiencies, water stress, poor soil health, or suboptimal planting conditions.

*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Nitrogen (N) Deficiency:** Apply **Urea** (46% N) at 20-30 kg/acre as a top dressing, depending on soil test recommendations and crop stage.
    *   **Phosphorus (P) Deficiency:** Ensure adequate basal application of **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5) at 25-30 kg/acre or **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5) at 75-90 kg/acre.
    *   **Potassium (K) Deficiency:** Apply **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** (60% K2O) at 10-15 kg/acre if soil tests indicate low levels.
    *   **Zinc (Zn) Deficiency:** Apply **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (21% Zn) at 10 kg/acre as a soil application before sowing, or a foliar spray of 0.5% solution (5 g/L water) of **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** at 20-30 days after sowing.
    *   **Iron (Fe) Deficiency:** For severe cases, a foliar spray of 0.5% solution (5 g/L water) of **Ferrous sulphate** (19% Fe) can be applied.
*   **Water Management:** Ensure timely and adequate irrigation, especially during critical growth stages, if rainfall is insufficient. Avoid both water stress and waterlogging.
*   **Soil Health:** Incorporate farmyard manure (FYM) or compost at 4-6 tonnes/acre to improve soil structure and organic matter content.
*   **Agronomic Practices:** Ensure proper seedbed preparation, timely sowing, and optimal plant spacing.

**2. Yellow Growth (Chlorosis)**

Yellowing of Pearl Millet leaves is often a symptom of nutrient deficiencies, particularly Nitrogen and Iron, or waterlogging.

*   **Nitrogen (N) Deficiency:** Characterized by general yellowing, starting from older leaves. Apply **Urea** (46% N) at 20-30 kg/acre as a top dressing.
*   **Iron (Fe) Deficiency:** Appears as interveinal yellowing (veins remain green) on younger leaves, especially in high pH soils. Apply a foliar spray of 0.5% solution (5 g/L water) of **Ferrous sulphate** (19% Fe) at 7-10 day intervals until symptoms disappear.
*   **Zinc (Zn) Deficiency:** Can cause whitish bands on either side of the midrib. Apply a foliar spray of 0.5% solution (5 g/L water) of **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (21% Zn).
*   **Sulfur (S) Deficiency:** General yellowing of younger leaves. Apply **Elemental sulfur** at 8-10 kg/acre or **Gypsum** (calcium sulphate dihydrate) at 100-150 kg/acre as a soil application.
*   **Waterlogging:** Improve field drainage to prevent root damage and nutrient unavailability.

**3. Excessive Height**

Excessive height in Pearl Millet can lead to lodging, especially under strong winds or heavy rainfall, impacting yield. This is often a varietal characteristic or a result of excessive nitrogen application.

*   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid over-application of nitrogen fertilizers. Follow soil test recommendations for balanced nutrient application.
*   **Varietal Selection:** Choose dwarf or semi-dwarf varieties that are less prone to lodging, especially in areas prone to strong winds.
*   **Planting Density:** Maintain optimal plant spacing to prevent etiolation (stretching due to competition for light).
*   **Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs):** Specific plant growth regulators for height reduction are generally **not recommended or commonly used in Pearl Millet (Bajra)** in Haryana for commercial grain production, primarily due to lack of specific approvals for this crop and purpose, and potential implications for food safety. Agronomic practices are the primary management tools.

**4. Excessive Flowering**

Excessive flowering, in the sense of being detrimental and requiring management to reduce it, is generally **not known to affect Pearl Millet (Bajra)** as a growth issue. Flowering is a critical stage for grain formation.

*   If "excessive flowering" refers to **premature flowering** or flowering under stress conditions (e.g., drought), which might lead to poor grain filling:
    *   Address the underlying stress, primarily through timely and adequate irrigation.
    *   Ensure balanced nutrient supply to support reproductive growth.
*   If it refers to a very high number of tillers producing heads, this is often a desirable trait for yield, provided the plant has sufficient resources to fill all grains.
*   There are no specific chemical interventions (PGRs) recommended or approved to reduce flowering in Pearl Millet for grain production.
