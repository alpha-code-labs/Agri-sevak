As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling smut diseases in Pearl Millet (Bajra) in Haryana:

Firstly, let's clarify which smut diseases are known to affect Pearl Millet (Bajra):

*   **Kernel Smut:** This is not known to affect Pearl Millet (Bajra). It is primarily a disease of wheat (Karnal Bunt).
*   **Loose Smut:** This is not known to affect Pearl Millet (Bajra). It is primarily a disease of wheat and barley.

The primary smut diseases affecting Pearl Millet (Bajra) are Black Smut and False Smut. Effective management involves an integrated approach combining cultural practices and appropriate chemical treatments.

### Control Measures for Black Smut (caused by *Moesziomyces penicillariae*) and False Smut (caused by *Macalpinomyces opertus*) in Pearl Millet (Bajra):

**1. Cultural and Agronomic Practices:**

*   **Resistant Varieties:** Cultivate smut-resistant or tolerant varieties recommended for your region by HAU. Consult your local agricultural extension office for the latest recommendations.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops to reduce inoculum build-up in the soil.
*   **Field Sanitation:**
    *   Remove and destroy infected panicles promptly before the smut sori rupture and release spores. This is crucial to prevent the spread of the disease.
    *   Ploughing deep after harvest can help bury infected debris and reduce inoculum.
*   **Timely Sowing:** Sow pearl millet at the recommended time for your region. Late sowing can sometimes increase disease incidence.
*   **Balanced Fertilization:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can sometimes favor disease development. Maintain a balanced nutrient supply.

**2. Chemical Control (Seed Treatment):**

Seed treatment is the most effective chemical method for managing seed-borne and soil-borne inoculum of smut diseases. Always use CIBRC approved technical chemical names and follow the recommended dosages.

*   **For Seed Treatment:**
    *   Treat seeds with a systemic fungicide before sowing. This protects the seedlings from early infection.
    *   Recommended fungicides and dosages:
        *   **Carboxin** 37.5% + **Thiram** 37.5% DS at 2-2.5 g per kg of seed.
        *   **Thiram** 75% WS at 2.5 g per kg of seed.
        *   **Tebuconazole** 2% DS at 2 g per kg of seed.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the fungicide label carefully.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Ensure uniform coverage of the seeds during treatment for optimal efficacy.
*   Consult your local HAU Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your local conditions and the latest approved chemicals.
