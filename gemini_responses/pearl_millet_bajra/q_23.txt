As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified seed and soil treatment processes for Pearl Millet (Bajra) cultivation in Haryana:

### Seed Treatment Process for Pearl Millet (Bajra)

Seed treatment is crucial for protecting young seedlings from various seed-borne and soil-borne diseases, particularly Downy Mildew, and for enhancing early plant vigour.

1.  **For Downy Mildew (Green Ear Disease) and other seed-borne fungal diseases:**
    *   Treat seeds with a systemic fungicide before sowing.
    *   **Metalaxyl** 35% WS: 2-3 grams per kg of seed.
    *   **OR**
    *   **Carbendazim** 12% + **Thiram** 63% WS: 2-3 grams per kg of seed.
    *   **OR**
    *   **Tebuconazole** 2% DS: 1-1.5 grams per kg of seed.
    *   *Method:* Mix the recommended quantity of fungicide thoroughly with the seeds until they are uniformly coated. Allow the seeds to dry in the shade before sowing.

2.  **For enhanced nutrient uptake and plant growth (Bio-fertilizers):**
    *   After fungicide treatment and drying, apply bio-fertilizers.
    *   **Azotobacter** liquid formulation: 5-10 ml per kg of seed.
    *   **PSB (Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria)** liquid formulation: 5-10 ml per kg of seed.
    *   *Method:* Prepare a slurry of bio-fertilizers with a small amount of water. Mix this slurry with the fungicide-treated seeds, ensuring uniform coating. Dry the seeds in the shade before sowing. Bio-fertilizers help in nitrogen fixation and phosphorus solubilization, improving nutrient availability to the plants.

### Soil Treatment Process for Pearl Millet (Bajra)

Soil treatment primarily focuses on managing early-season weeds and soil-borne pathogens.

1.  **For Pre-emergence Weed Management:**
    *   Apply a pre-emergence herbicide within 2-3 days of sowing to control a wide spectrum of weeds.
    *   **Atrazine** 50% WP: 1.0-2.0 kg per acre, dissolved in 200-300 litres of water and sprayed uniformly over the soil surface.
    *   **OR**
    *   **Pendimethalin** 30% EC: 1.0-1.3 litres per acre, dissolved in 200-300 litres of water and sprayed uniformly over the soil surface.
    *   *Method:* Ensure uniform spray coverage for effective weed control. The soil should have adequate moisture at the time of application for optimal efficacy.

2.  **For Soil-borne Disease Suppression (Bio-agent):**
    *   To manage soil-borne fungal diseases and promote plant health.
    *   **Trichoderma viride** 1% WP: 2.5 kg per acre.
    *   *Method:* Mix the recommended quantity of **Trichoderma viride** thoroughly with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost. This mixture should be broadcasted uniformly and incorporated into the soil during the last ploughing before sowing. This helps in suppressing harmful soil pathogens and improving soil health.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label for safe and effective use.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   An integrated approach combining cultural practices, resistant varieties, and appropriate chemical/biological treatments is most effective for sustainable crop management.
