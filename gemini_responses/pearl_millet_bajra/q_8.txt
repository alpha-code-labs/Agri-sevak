As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach for effective and sustainable control of sucking pests in Pearl Millet (Bajra).

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Sucking Pests in Pearl Millet (Bajra):**

1.  **Monitoring and Scouting:**
    *   Regularly inspect fields, especially the undersides of leaves and tender shoots, for the presence of aphids, leafhoppers, whiteflies, and thrips.
    *   Early detection is crucial for timely intervention.

2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available, choose pearl millet varieties known to have tolerance or resistance to common sucking pests.
    *   **Timely Sowing:** Adhere to recommended sowing dates for your region to avoid peak pest populations.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy crop residues after harvest to reduce overwintering pest populations.
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep fields free of weeds, as many weeds can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush growth that is more attractive to sucking pests.

3.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Conserve natural enemies such as ladybird beetles, lacewings, hoverfly larvae, and parasitic wasps, which prey on or parasitize aphids, whiteflies, and other soft-bodied insects. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

4.  **Chemical Control (as a last resort, based on Economic Threshold Level - ETL):**
    *   Apply insecticides only when pest populations exceed the Economic Threshold Level (ETL) to prevent economic losses.
    *   Always ensure thorough coverage of the foliage, especially the undersides of leaves.
    *   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.
    *   Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions.

**Specific Control Measures for Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips:**

For effective control of these sucking pests, the following CIBRC approved technical chemicals can be used:

*   **For Foliar Spray:**
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: 100-125 ml per acre in 200-400 litres of water (0.25-0.31 ml/L).
    *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: 40-80 g per acre in 200-400 litres of water (0.1-0.2 g/L).
    *   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP: 80-100 g per acre in 200-400 litres of water (0.2-0.25 g/L).
    *   **Dimethoate** 30% EC: 400-600 ml per acre in 200-400 litres of water (1.0-1.5 ml/L).
    *   **Fipronil** 5% SC: 400-600 ml per acre in 200-400 litres of water (1.0-1.5 ml/L).

*   **For Seed Treatment (for early season protection against sucking pests):**
    *   **Imidacloprid** 600 FS: 5-7 ml per kg of seed.
    *   **Thiamethoxam** 30% FS: 3-5 ml per kg of seed.

**Regarding Psylla:**

*   This is not known to affect Pearl Millet (Bajra).

Always consult your local agricultural extension officer for the most current recommendations and specific guidance tailored to your farm's conditions in Haryana.
