As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice regarding rust diseases in Pearl Millet (Bajra) for Haryana.

It is important to first clarify which of the mentioned rust diseases are known to affect Pearl Millet (Bajra):

*   **Black Rust (*Puccinia graminis*):** This is not known to affect Pearl Millet (Bajra). It primarily affects wheat and barley.
*   **Brown Rust (*Puccinia recondita* / *Puccinia hordei*):** This is not known to affect Pearl Millet (Bajra). It primarily affects wheat and barley.
*   **Yellow Rust (*Puccinia striiformis*):** This is not known to affect Pearl Millet (Bajra). It primarily affects wheat and barley.
*   **White Rust (*Albugo* species):** This is not known to affect Pearl Millet (Bajra). White rusts are caused by oomycetes and affect crops like crucifers (mustard) and sweet potato, but not pearl millet.
*   **Red Rust (Pearl Millet Rust, *Puccinia penniseti* or *Puccinia substriata* var. *indica*):** This is the primary rust disease that affects Pearl Millet (Bajra) in Haryana and other pearl millet growing regions.

Therefore, our focus will be on the control of Red Rust (Pearl Millet Rust).

### Control Measures for Red Rust (Pearl Millet Rust) in Bajra:

Effective management of Pearl Millet Rust involves an integrated approach combining cultural practices and timely chemical interventions.

**1. Cultural and Agronomic Practices:**

*   **Resistant Varieties:** The most economical and effective method is to cultivate rust-resistant or tolerant hybrids/varieties recommended by HAU for Haryana. Consult your local Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or HAU for the latest recommendations.
*   **Timely Sowing:** Sowing pearl millet at the recommended time (typically first fortnight of July in Haryana) can help in disease escape, as late-sown crops are often more susceptible to severe rust infection due to favorable environmental conditions later in the season.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected crop residues and volunteer pearl millet plants from the field after harvest to reduce the primary inoculum source for the next season.
*   **Balanced Fertilization:** Avoid excessive nitrogen application, as it can make the crop more succulent and susceptible to rust. Maintain a balanced nutrient supply as per soil test recommendations.

**2. Chemical Control (Fungicides):**

Fungicides should be applied at the first appearance of rust symptoms (small, reddish-brown pustules, mainly on the lower leaves) and repeated if necessary, especially during prolonged humid and warm weather conditions. Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.

*   **For preventive or early stage control:**
    *   **Mancozeb 75% WP:** Apply at a rate of 2.5 kg per acre, mixed in 500-600 litres of water (approximately 4-5 g per litre of water).
*   **For curative and effective control of established rust:**
    *   **Propiconazole 25% EC:** Apply at a rate of 200 ml per acre, mixed in 200 litres of water (1 ml per litre of water).
    *   **Tebuconazole 25.9% EC:** Apply at a rate of 200 ml per acre, mixed in 200 litres of water (1 ml per litre of water).
    *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:** Apply at a rate of 200 ml per acre, mixed in 200 litres of water (1 ml per litre of water).

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the fungicide label carefully, including dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Ensure proper spray equipment calibration for uniform coverage.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer or KVK for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and the prevailing disease situation.
