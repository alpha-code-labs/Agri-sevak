As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the use of Growth Regulators/Hormones and Boron in Pearl Millet (Bajra) for Haryana conditions:

It is important to note that the application of growth regulators should always be based on specific crop needs, growth stage, and local recommendations, as improper use can lead to adverse effects.

1.  **Ethrel (Ethephon)**
    *   This is not known to affect Pearl Millet (Bajra) in a beneficial way as a standard growth regulator application in Haryana's agricultural practices. Its use is not commonly recommended for Pearl Millet.

2.  **2,4-D**
    *   This is primarily a broadleaf herbicide. Its use as a growth regulator at specific low doses is not a standard or recommended practice for Pearl Millet (Bajra) in Haryana. Applying 2,4-D to Pearl Millet as a growth regulator is not known to provide beneficial effects and can lead to phytotoxicity or unintended consequences.

3.  **Boron**
    *   Boron is an essential micronutrient critical for pollen viability, fertilization, and grain development in Pearl Millet. While not a "hormone," its deficiency severely impacts reproductive growth.
    *   **Purpose:** To correct Boron deficiency, which can lead to poor grain filling and reduced yield.
    *   **Recommended Application (Foliar Spray):**
        *   **Chemical:** **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate)
        *   **Dose:** 0.2% solution (2 g of **Borax** per litre of water).
        *   **Application Rate:** Typically, 400-500 g of **Borax** per acre, dissolved in 200-250 litres of water.
        *   **Timing:** Apply at the tillering stage and/or pre-flowering (boot) stage, especially if deficiency symptoms are observed or if the soil analysis indicates low Boron levels.
