As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies in Pearl Millet (Bajra) in Haryana.

**General Recommendation:**
Before applying any fertilizers, it is highly recommended to conduct a soil test to determine the exact nutrient status of your field. This will help in precise fertilizer application, preventing over-application and ensuring optimal nutrient availability. The following recommendations are general guidelines and should be adjusted based on soil test results.

### Addressing Macro-nutrient Deficiencies in Pearl Millet (Bajra)

#### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

Nitrogen deficiency typically manifests as general yellowing of older leaves, stunted growth, and reduced tillering.

*   **Basal Application (at sowing):**
    *   Apply 20-30 kg of Nitrogen per acre.
    *   Recommended sources:
        *   **Urea** (approximately 45-65 kg/acre, depending on N content)
        *   **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (provides N and P, approximately 40-60 kg/acre)
        *   **Ammonium Sulphate** (approximately 100-150 kg/acre)
*   **Top-dressing (25-30 days after sowing):**
    *   Apply an additional 20-30 kg of Nitrogen per acre.
    *   Recommended source:
        *   **Urea** (approximately 45-65 kg/acre)
*   **Foliar Application (for quick correction of mild deficiency):**
    *   Spray a 2% solution of **Urea** (20 g of Urea per litre of water) at 15-day intervals, if deficiency symptoms persist or for a quick boost. Ensure good coverage of foliage.

#### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

Phosphorus deficiency often leads to stunted growth, dark green to purplish discoloration of older leaves, and poor root development.

*   **Basal Application (at sowing):**
    *   Apply 20-30 kg of Phosphorus (P2O5) per acre.
    *   Recommended sources:
        *   **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (approximately 40-60 kg/acre, also provides N)
        *   **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (approximately 125-188 kg/acre)
*   **Note:** Phosphorus is less mobile in the soil, so basal application is crucial for root development. Foliar application is generally not effective for correcting severe P deficiency.

#### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency

Potassium deficiency symptoms include yellowing and scorching/browning of leaf margins (especially older leaves), weak stalks, and poor grain filling.

*   **Basal Application (at sowing):**
    *   Apply 15-20 kg of Potassium (K2O) per acre, especially if soil test indicates low levels.
    *   Recommended source:
        *   **Muriate of Potash (MOP) / Potassium Chloride** (approximately 25-33 kg/acre)
*   **Foliar Application (for quick correction of mild deficiency):**
    *   Spray a 1-2% solution of **Potassium Nitrate** (10-20 g of Potassium Nitrate per litre of water) or **Muriate of Potash** (10-20 g of MOP per litre of water) at 15-day intervals, if deficiency symptoms appear.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Integrated Nutrient Management (INM):** Supplement chemical fertilizers with organic manures like Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost (5-10 tonnes/acre) to improve soil health and nutrient availability.
*   **Application Method:** Ensure uniform application of fertilizers. For basal application, incorporate fertilizers into the soil before sowing or at the time of sowing.
*   **Water Availability:** Adequate soil moisture is essential for nutrient uptake by plants. Ensure proper irrigation practices.
