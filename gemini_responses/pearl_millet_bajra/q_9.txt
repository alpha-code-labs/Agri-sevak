Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm that both Red Spider Mite (Tetranychus urticae) and various species of Rust Mites (Eriophyidae family) can affect Pearl Millet (Bajra), especially under dry and warm conditions prevalent in Haryana. Early detection and timely management are crucial to prevent significant yield losses.

Here's a scientifically verified approach for controlling mites in Pearl Millet:

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategy:**

A holistic approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods is recommended for sustainable mite management.

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Timely Sowing:** Adhere to recommended sowing dates for your region to avoid peak mite activity periods.
*   **Proper Irrigation:** Mites thrive in dry conditions. Adequate and timely irrigation can help reduce mite populations and improve plant vigour, making plants more tolerant to infestation.
*   **Weed Management:** Keep fields free of weeds, as many weeds can act as alternate hosts for mites.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation to break the pest cycle.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy crop residues after harvest to reduce overwintering mite populations.

**2. Biological Control:**
*   Natural predators like predatory mites (e.g., Amblyseius spp.), ladybird beetles, and lacewings can help keep mite populations in check. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

**3. Chemical Control (Acaricides):**
If mite infestation is severe and cultural/biological methods are insufficient, chemical control may be necessary. Always ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where mites are most active. Rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

Please use the following CIBRC approved technical chemical names and dosages:

*   **Spiromesifen** 22.9% SC: Apply at 125-200 ml per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water.
*   **Propargite** 57% EC: Apply at 500-750 ml per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water.
*   **Fenpyroximate** 5% SC: Apply at 200-300 ml per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water.
*   **Wettable Sulphur** 80% WP: Apply at 1.5-2.0 kg per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water. This is particularly effective against rust mites and can also suppress spider mites.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label carefully.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying.
*   Spray during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   Monitor your crop regularly for mite presence, especially during dry spells. Early detection allows for more effective and less intensive control measures.
