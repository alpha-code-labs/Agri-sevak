As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing pests in Pearl Millet (Bajra) in Haryana.

Here's how to control the mentioned pests, along with clarification on those not affecting Pearl Millet:

### 1. Borers (Stem Borer / Shoot Fly)

Stem borers (e.g., *Chilo partellus*) and shoot flies (*Atherigona approximata*) are significant pests of Pearl Millet, especially in the early stages, causing "dead hearts."

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Borers:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Early Sowing:** Sowing Pearl Millet early in the season can help escape peak pest incidence.
    *   **Resistant Varieties:** Utilize Pearl Millet varieties known to have tolerance or resistance to stem borers and shoot flies, as recommended by HAU.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy crop residues after harvest to reduce carry-over pest populations.
    *   **Intercropping:** Intercropping with pulses like cowpea or green gram can sometimes reduce borer incidence.

*   **Chemical Control (Apply only if infestation crosses Economic Threshold Level - ETL):**
    *   For early stage infestation (shoot fly/stem borer):
        *   **Carbofuran** 3% G at 10 kg/acre, applied in furrows at the time of sowing or as a whorl application.
        *   **Fipronil** 0.3% G at 6.6-10 kg/acre, applied in whorls.
    *   For established plants with stem borer infestation:
        *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC at 60 ml/acre (diluted in 200-300 litres of water).
        *   **Thiamethoxam** 12.6% + **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 9.5% ZC at 50 ml/acre (diluted in 200-300 litres of water).
        *   **Fipronil** 5% SC at 400-600 ml/acre (diluted in 200-300 litres of water).

### 2. Caterpillars (e.g., Fall Armyworm, Armyworm)

Various caterpillar species, including armyworms (*Mythimna separata*) and particularly the invasive Fall Armyworm (*Spodoptera frugiperda*), can cause significant defoliation and damage to Pearl Millet.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Caterpillars:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Monitoring:** Regularly scout fields, especially young plants, for egg masses and early instar larvae.
    *   **Hand Picking:** In small areas, hand-picking and destroying egg masses and young larvae can be effective.
    *   **Pheromone Traps:** Install pheromone traps at 5 traps/acre for monitoring and mass trapping of adult moths.
    *   **Timely Weeding:** Remove weeds that can serve as alternate hosts.

*   **Biological Control:**
    *   **Bacillus thuringiensis** (Bt) formulations at 1 kg/acre (diluted in 200-300 litres of water) are effective against young larvae. Apply in the evening for best results.

*   **Chemical Control (Apply only if infestation crosses Economic Threshold Level - ETL):**
    *   For early instar larvae:
        *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG at 80-100 g/acre (diluted in 200-300 litres of water).
        *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC at 60 ml/acre (diluted in 200-300 litres of water).
        *   **Flubendiamide** 20% WG at 100 g/acre (diluted in 200-300 litres of water).
        *   **Spinetoram** 11.7% SC at 75 ml/acre (diluted in 200-300 litres of water).
    *   For older larvae or heavy infestations:
        *   **Indoxacarb** 14.5% SC at 200 ml/acre (diluted in 200-300 litres of water).

### 3. Diamondback Moth

This is not known to affect Pearl Millet (Bajra). Diamondback moth (*Plutella xylostella*) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower, mustard).

### 4. Leaf Folder

This is not known to affect Pearl Millet (Bajra). Leaf folders are typically pests of crops like rice and maize, and are not considered a common or significant pest of Pearl Millet.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully, including dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.
*   Consult your local Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or HAU extension specialist for the latest recommendations and specific advice tailored to your field conditions.
