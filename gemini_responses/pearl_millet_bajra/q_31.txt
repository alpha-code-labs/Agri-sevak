As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the conditions you've mentioned for Pearl Millet (Bajra) in Haryana:

*   **Fruit bursting:** This is not known to affect Pearl Millet (Bajra). Pearl Millet produces grains (caryopses) on a spike, not fleshy fruits that would burst.

*   **Hardness in fruit:** This is not known to affect Pearl Millet (Bajra). Pearl Millet produces grains, and the hardening of grains is a natural process of maturation and drying. If you are referring to abnormally small, shriveled, or prematurely hardened grains, this is typically a symptom of severe environmental stress (e.g., drought) during the grain filling stage, or sometimes due to specific diseases.

*   **Leaf burning/melting:** This condition in Pearl Millet (Bajra) is typically a symptom of severe environmental stress, primarily high temperatures (heat stress) and/or water deficit (drought stress). It can also be caused by chemical phytotoxicity or severe nutrient imbalances. Control measures focus on preventing or mitigating these stresses:

    *   **Agronomic Practices:**
        *   **Variety Selection:** Choose heat and drought-tolerant Pearl Millet varieties recommended for Haryana by HAU.
        *   **Optimized Sowing Time:** Sow Pearl Millet at the recommended time to ensure critical growth stages (flowering and grain filling) do not coincide with the peak of severe heat waves.
        *   **Irrigation Management:** Provide timely and adequate irrigation, especially during critical growth stages like tillering, flowering, and grain filling. Ensure proper soil moisture availability.
        *   **Mulching:** Apply organic mulches (e.g., straw, crop residues) to the soil surface. This helps conserve soil moisture, reduces soil temperature fluctuations, and suppresses weeds.
        *   **Balanced Nutrient Management:** Ensure balanced fertilization based on soil test recommendations. Adequate potassium (K) nutrition, in particular, can enhance the plant's tolerance to heat and drought stress.

    *   **Prevention of Chemical Phytotoxicity:**
        *   Always use the correct dosage, timing, and application method for all agrochemicals (herbicides, insecticides, fungicides).
        *   Avoid spraying during high temperatures, strong winds, or when plants are under severe water stress, as this can increase the risk of phytotoxicity.
        *   Use clean water for spray solutions.

    *   **Stress Mitigation (Foliar Application):**
        *   In situations of anticipated or ongoing environmental stress, foliar application of certain nutrients can help improve plant resilience.
            *   **Potassium nitrate**: Apply 1-2% solution (10-20 g/L of water) as a foliar spray during stress periods. This can help improve drought and heat tolerance.
