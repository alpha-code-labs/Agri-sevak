As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling various rot types in Pearl Millet (Bajra) in Haryana.

First, let's clarify the applicability of the mentioned rot types to Pearl Millet:

*   **Black Rot:** This is not known to affect Pearl Millet (Bajra) as a specific disease.
*   **Fruit Rot:** This is not known to affect Pearl Millet (Bajra) as Pearl Millet produces grains (caryopses), not fleshy fruits.

For the remaining rot types – **Root Rot, Stem Rot, Foot Rot, Collar Rot, Crown Rot, Neck Rot, Seed Rot, and Seedling Rot** – these are significant issues in Pearl Millet, often caused by a complex of soil-borne fungal pathogens such as *Macrophomina phaseolina* (causing charcoal rot), *Rhizoctonia solani*, *Sclerotium rolfsii*, *Fusarium* spp., and *Pythium* spp. Neck rot can also be a symptom associated with diseases like Downy Mildew (*Sclerospora graminicola*) or Blast (*Magnaporthe grisea*).

Effective control requires an integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods.

### Integrated Management for Rot Types in Pearl Millet (Bajra)

**1. Cultural and Agronomic Practices:**

*   **Crop Rotation:** Implement a 2-3 year crop rotation with non-host crops (e.g., legumes, wheat) to reduce soil-borne inoculum.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris from the field to prevent pathogen carry-over.
*   **Soil Health and Drainage:** Ensure good soil drainage to prevent waterlogging, which favors many rot pathogens. Improve soil structure through organic matter addition.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can make plants more susceptible. Provide balanced nutrients based on soil test recommendations.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Utilize Pearl Millet varieties known for their resistance or tolerance to major diseases, including downy mildew and charcoal rot. Consult HAU for recommended varieties for Haryana.
*   **Timely Sowing:** Sow seeds at the optimum time to ensure vigorous seedling growth and avoid periods of high disease pressure.
*   **Optimum Plant Spacing:** Maintain recommended plant spacing to ensure good air circulation and reduce humidity around the plant base.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** Deep summer ploughing can expose soil-borne pathogens to sunlight, reducing their viability.

**2. Biological Control:**

*   **Seed Treatment with Bio-agents:**
    *   Treat seeds with **Trichoderma viride** or **Pseudomonas fluorescens** at 4-6 g/kg seed. These bio-agents colonize the root zone and suppress pathogenic fungi.

**3. Chemical Control:**

Chemical control primarily focuses on seed treatment to protect against seed, seedling, root, collar, and crown rots, and to reduce initial inoculum for stem and neck rots. Soil drenching may be considered for severe localized outbreaks.

*   **A. Seed Treatment (Essential for preventing Seed Rot, Seedling Rot, and early-stage Root, Collar, Crown, and Stem Rots):**
    *   For broad-spectrum protection against various soil-borne fungi:
        *   **Carbendazim** 1-2 g/kg seed
        *   **Thiram** 2-3 g/kg seed
        *   A combination of **Carbendazim + Thiram** (e.g., 1 g Carbendazim + 2 g Thiram per kg seed) provides broader efficacy.
    *   For specific control of oomycetes (like *Pythium* spp. causing damping-off) and Downy Mildew (which can lead to neck rot):
        *   **Metalaxyl** 6 g/kg seed (often available in combination with Mancozeb, e.g., **Metalaxyl + Mancozeb** at 6 g/kg seed).
    *   For broad-spectrum systemic protection:
        *   **Tebuconazole** 1-1.25 ml/kg seed (liquid formulation) or 1-1.5 g/kg seed (powder formulation).

*   **B. Soil Drenching / Foliar Spray (For managing Root, Collar, Crown, Stem, and Neck Rots in standing crops, if severe):**
    *   For general rot control (Root, Collar, Crown, Stem Rot):
        *   Drench the soil around the base of affected plants with **Carbendazim** at 0.5-1 g/L water.
        *   Alternatively, drench with **Tebuconazole** at 0.75-1 ml/L water.
    *   For Neck Rot associated with Downy Mildew or other systemic infections:
        *   Foliar spray or drench with **Metalaxyl + Mancozeb** at 2-2.5 g/L water. Ensure thorough coverage, especially at the base of the plant and panicle neck if applicable.

Always follow the manufacturer's instructions for specific product formulations and safety precautions. Consult with HAU extension specialists for the latest recommendations on resistant varieties and chemical applications suitable for your specific field conditions.
