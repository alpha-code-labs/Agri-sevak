As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the maturity signs, harvesting time, and cutting process for Pearl Millet (Bajra) in Haryana:

### Maturity Signs for Pearl Millet (Bajra)

The following indicators signify that Pearl Millet is ready for harvest:

*   **Grain Hardness:** The grains in the ear head should be hard and firm. When pressed with a thumbnail, they should not dent easily.
*   **Grain Colour Change:** The grains will change from a green colour to their characteristic mature colour, which can vary by variety (e.g., greyish-white, yellowish, or bluish-grey).
*   **Drying of Leaves and Stalks:** The lower leaves of the plant will start to dry, turn yellow, and eventually brown. The entire plant may show signs of senescence, indicating the completion of its physiological growth cycle.
*   **Ear Head Appearance:** The ear heads (panicles) will appear dry and firm to the touch.
*   **Moisture Content:** The optimal grain moisture content for harvesting is typically between 20-25%.

### Harvesting Time for Pearl Millet (Bajra)

*   **Optimal Period:** Harvesting should commence when the grains are fully mature and hard, and the plant shows the maturity signs mentioned above. This usually occurs approximately 75-90 days after sowing, depending on the specific variety and prevailing environmental conditions.
*   **Weather Conditions:** It is advisable to harvest on a clear, sunny day to facilitate initial drying of the harvested material and reduce the risk of fungal growth.

### Cutting Process for Pearl Millet (Bajra)

The cutting process can be performed manually or mechanically:

*   **Manual Harvesting:**
    *   **Ear Head Cutting:** The most common method involves cutting only the ear heads (panicles) using a sickle, leaving the stalks in the field. This allows for separate drying of the grain-bearing heads and subsequent use of the stalks as fodder.
    *   **Whole Plant Cutting:** Alternatively, the entire plant can be cut close to the ground using a sickle. This method is often preferred if the stalks are also intended for immediate fodder use or if threshing will be done by beating the whole plant.
*   **Mechanical Harvesting:**
    *   **Combine Harvesters:** For larger areas, combine harvesters can be employed. These machines cut the entire plant, thresh the grains, and separate them from the straw in a single operation.
    *   **Machine Adjustment:** When using a combine, it is crucial to adjust the machine settings (e.g., cylinder speed, concave clearance, fan speed) appropriately to minimize grain damage and reduce harvesting losses.
*   **Post-Cutting Drying:**
    *   After cutting, whether ear heads or entire plants, the harvested material should be spread thinly in the sun for 2-3 days. This crucial step reduces the moisture content to a safe level (typically 12-14%) for threshing and subsequent storage, preventing spoilage and pest infestation.
    *   **Threshing:** Once adequately dried, threshing can be performed manually (by beating the ear heads with sticks) or mechanically using a thresher to separate the grains from the chaff.
