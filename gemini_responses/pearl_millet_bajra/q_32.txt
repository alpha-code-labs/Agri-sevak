Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding the "drying up" of Pearl Millet (Bajra) plants, which can manifest as drying branches, leaves, fruits (grains), and flowers. This general symptom can be caused by a combination of biotic (diseases, pests) and abiotic (environmental/physiological) factors. Accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective management.

Here's a comprehensive approach to address this issue:

**I. Abiotic Factors (Physiological Stress)**

These are often the primary causes of general drying symptoms, especially in rainfed conditions or during extreme weather.

1.  **Drought Stress:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Wilting, rolling of leaves, yellowing, scorching of leaf margins, premature drying of entire plants, poor grain filling, and shrivelled grains.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Timely Sowing:** Sow at the optimal time to utilize monsoon rains effectively.
        *   **Water Conservation:** Implement practices like mulching with crop residues to conserve soil moisture.
        *   **Supplemental Irrigation:** If available, provide light irrigation during critical growth stages (tillering, flowering, grain filling) during dry spells.
        *   **Deep Ploughing:** Improves soil water infiltration and storage.

2.  **Nutrient Deficiencies:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Specific nutrient deficiencies can cause yellowing, scorching, and premature drying of leaves. For example, severe potassium deficiency can lead to marginal leaf necrosis and drying.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Soil Testing:** Conduct regular soil tests to determine nutrient status.
        *   **Balanced Fertilization:** Apply recommended doses of NPK and micronutrients based on soil test results. For Haryana, general recommendations are 60 kg Nitrogen, 30 kg Phosphorus, and 20 kg Potassium per acre. Apply Zinc Sulphate (25 kg/acre) if zinc deficiency is suspected.

3.  **Waterlogging:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Yellowing, wilting, and eventual drying of plants due to root damage from lack of oxygen.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Proper Drainage:** Ensure good field drainage, especially in low-lying areas.
        *   **Raised Beds:** Consider planting on raised beds in areas prone to waterlogging.

4.  **Heat Stress:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Scorching of leaves, particularly during flowering and grain filling, leading to poor seed set and shrivelled grains.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Heat-Tolerant Varieties:** Select varieties known for their heat tolerance.
        *   **Timely Sowing:** Avoid late sowing that exposes critical stages to peak summer heat.

**II. Biotic Factors (Diseases and Pests)**

Several diseases and pests can cause drying symptoms.

**A. Diseases:**

1.  **Charcoal Rot (Macrophomina phaseolina):**
    *   **Symptoms:** This is a significant cause of premature drying. Plants show premature ripening, drying of leaves from bottom upwards, and eventually the entire plant dries up. The stalk, when split, shows shredding of internal tissues and numerous black microsclerotia.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Resistant Varieties:** Use resistant or tolerant varieties.
        *   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate with non-host crops.
        *   **Balanced Nutrition:** Avoid excessive nitrogen and ensure adequate potassium.
        *   **Moisture Management:** Avoid severe moisture stress, especially during flowering and grain filling.
        *   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds with fungicides to reduce initial inoculum.
            *   **Carbendazim** 1 g/kg seed + **Thiram** 2 g/kg seed.

2.  **Blast (Pyricularia grisea):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Causes characteristic spindle-shaped lesions on leaves, which can coalesce and lead to blighting and drying of large leaf areas. Neck blast can cause the ear to break and dry prematurely.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Resistant Varieties:** Use resistant varieties.
        *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris.
        *   **Fungicide Spray (if severe):**
            *   **Tricyclazole** 0.6 g/L of water (240 g/acre in 400 L water).
            *   **Isoprothiolane** 1.5 ml/L of water (600 ml/acre in 400 L water).
            *   **Azoxystrobin** 0.5 ml/L of water (200 ml/acre in 400 L water).

3.  **Downy Mildew (Sclerospora graminicola) / Green Ear Disease:**
    *   **Symptoms:** While primarily causing malformation of the ear into a "green ear" leafy structure, severe systemic infection can lead to stunted plants, chlorosis, and premature drying of affected parts or even the entire plant.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Resistant Varieties:** Use resistant hybrids/varieties.
        *   **Seed Treatment:** This is highly effective.
            *   **Metalaxyl-M** 2 g/kg seed.
        *   **Field Sanitation:** Collect and destroy infected plants.
        *   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate with non-host crops.

4.  **Rust (Puccinia penniseti):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Causes reddish-brown pustules on leaves. In severe infestations, leaves can turn yellow, dry prematurely, and reduce photosynthetic area, impacting grain filling.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Resistant Varieties:** Use resistant varieties.
        *   **Fungicide Spray (if severe):**
            *   **Propiconazole** 1 ml/L of water (400 ml/acre in 400 L water).
            *   **Difenoconazole** 0.5 ml/L of water (200 ml/acre in 400 L water).

5.  **Root Rot / Collar Rot (Various fungi like Rhizoctonia, Fusarium):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Wilting and yellowing of leaves, followed by drying of the entire plant, often starting from the seedling stage or later. The base of the stem or roots show rotting.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Seed Treatment:**
            *   **Carbendazim** 1 g/kg seed + **Thiram** 2 g/kg seed.
        *   **Good Drainage:** Avoid waterlogging.
        *   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate with non-host crops.

**B. Insect Pests:**

1.  **Stem Borer (Chilo partellus) and Shoot Fly (Atherigona approximata):**
    *   **Symptoms:** In young plants, these pests cause "dead heart" where the central shoot dries up and can be easily pulled out. In older plants, stem borer can cause lodging and premature drying of the ear.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Resistant Varieties:** Use tolerant varieties.
        *   **Timely Sowing:** Avoid very early or very late sowing.
        *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy stubbles after harvest.
        *   **Seed Treatment (for early protection):**
            *   **Imidacloprid** 5 g/kg seed.
            *   **Fipronil** 5 g/kg seed.
        *   **Foliar Spray (if infestation is high, for stem borer):**
            *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 0.3 ml/L of water (120 ml/acre in 400 L water).
            *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 0.5 ml/L of water (200 ml/acre in 400 L water).

2.  **Termites:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Termites feed on roots and the base of the stem, leading to wilting, yellowing, and eventual drying of the entire plant.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove crop residues and weeds that can harbor termites.
        *   **Soil Application (at sowing or pre-sowing):**
            *   **Fipronil** 0.3% GR at 6-8 kg/acre.

**General Recommendations for Integrated Management:**

*   **Accurate Diagnosis:** Before applying any treatment, it is crucial to correctly identify the cause of drying. If unsure, consult with HAU experts or local agricultural extension officers.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Always prioritize the use of disease and pest-resistant/tolerant varieties recommended for Haryana.
*   **Good Agronomic Practices:** Maintain optimal plant spacing, balanced nutrition, and timely irrigation/drainage.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris and weeds, which can harbor pests and diseases.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops to break the disease and pest cycles.

By adopting these integrated management strategies, you can effectively address the issue of drying up in your Pearl Millet crop and ensure a healthy yield.
