As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding Scale insects and Mealybugs in Pearl Millet (Bajra) for Haryana:

**Scale Insects:**
This is not known to affect Pearl Millet (Bajra).

**Mealybugs:**
While mealybugs are generally not considered a major pest of Pearl Millet (Bajra) in Haryana, occasional infestations, particularly by species like the cotton mealybug (*Phenacoccus solenopsis*), can occur, especially under specific environmental conditions or in fields with a history of mealybug issues in other crops. Management primarily focuses on cultural practices.

**Management Strategies for Mealybugs (if observed):**

*   **Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy crop residues and weeds, which can act as alternate hosts for mealybugs.
    *   **Deep Ploughing:** After harvest, deep ploughing can expose mealybug eggs and pupae to natural enemies and harsh weather conditions, reducing their population for the next season.
    *   **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect plants, especially the base and leaf axils, for early signs of mealybug infestation.
    *   **Manual Removal:** For small, localized infestations, mealybugs can be physically removed or dislodged using a strong jet of water.
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep fields free of weeds, as many weeds serve as alternative hosts for mealybugs.

*   **Biological Control:**
    *   Natural enemies like ladybird beetles (e.g., *Cryptolaemus montrouzieri*) and parasitic wasps can help in suppressing mealybug populations. Conserve these natural enemies by avoiding broad-spectrum insecticides.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Due to the minor pest status of mealybugs in Pearl Millet and the general lack of specific CIBRC-approved chemical registrations for mealybug control *in Pearl Millet*, chemical intervention is generally not recommended. If an extremely severe, localized outbreak occurs and cultural methods are insufficient, consult with HAU experts for the most current and appropriate advice, considering off-label use under expert supervision if absolutely necessary and permissible, which is rare for this crop-pest combination.
