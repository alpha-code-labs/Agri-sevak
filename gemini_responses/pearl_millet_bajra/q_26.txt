As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified information regarding specialized practices in Pearl Millet (Bajra) cultivation relevant to Haryana:

*   **Pruning**
    *   Pearl Millet (Bajra) is an annual cereal crop. Pruning, which involves the selective removal of plant parts to improve growth, shape, or yield, is a practice typically applied to woody plants, fruit trees, or some horticultural crops.
    *   This practice is not performed in Pearl Millet (Bajra).

*   **Desuckering**
    *   Pearl Millet (Bajra) naturally produces tillers (often referred to as suckers in other crops) from the base of the plant. These tillers are an integral part of the plant's architecture and contribute significantly to the overall grain yield.
    *   Therefore, desuckering (the removal of tillers) is not a standard or recommended practice for Pearl Millet (Bajra) cultivation. In fact, good tillering capacity is a desirable trait in Pearl Millet varieties.

*   **Mulching**
    *   Mulching is a highly beneficial practice for Pearl Millet (Bajra), especially in the semi-arid conditions prevalent in Haryana.
    *   **Benefits:**
        *   **Moisture Conservation:** Mulch acts as a barrier, significantly reducing evaporation from the soil surface and conserving precious soil moisture, which is critical for rainfed Pearl Millet.
        *   **Weed Suppression:** It physically suppresses weed growth, reducing competition for water, nutrients, and sunlight.
        *   **Soil Temperature Regulation:** Helps to moderate soil temperature, protecting roots from extreme heat during hot periods.
        *   **Soil Health Improvement:** Organic mulches decompose over time, adding organic matter to the soil, improving soil structure, and enhancing microbial activity.
    *   **Materials:** Common mulching materials include crop residues (e.g., Pearl Millet stalks, wheat straw, rice straw), dry leaves, or even plastic mulches.
    *   **Application:** A layer of organic mulch, typically 5-10 cm thick, can be applied to the soil surface after sowing or after the crop has established.

*   **Grafting**
    *   Grafting is a horticultural technique used to join parts of two plants (scion and rootstock) so they grow as a single plant. It is primarily performed on dicotyledonous plants (e.g., fruit trees, vegetables) that possess a vascular cambium layer essential for successful union.
    *   Pearl Millet (Bajra) is a monocotyledonous cereal crop. Its anatomical structure, particularly the scattered vascular bundles and the absence of a vascular cambium, makes grafting impossible.
    *   Therefore, grafting is not a practice performed in Pearl Millet (Bajra).

*   **Pollination**
    *   Pollination in Pearl Millet (Bajra) is a natural process and does not require specialized human intervention in commercial cultivation. However, understanding its pollination mechanism is crucial for breeding programs.
    *   **Mechanism:** Pearl Millet is primarily **wind-pollinated (anemophilous)**.
    *   **Protogyny:** It exhibits **protogyny**, a unique characteristic where the stigmas (female receptive parts) on a panicle (ear head) emerge and become receptive several days before the anthers (male pollen-producing parts) on the same panicle mature and shed pollen. This mechanism promotes cross-pollination.
    *   **Cross-Pollination:** Due to protogyny and wind dispersal of pollen, Pearl Millet has a high degree of natural cross-pollination (typically 70-80% or more).
    *   **No Manual Intervention:** There is no need for manual pollination or the introduction of specific pollinators for commercial Pearl Millet production. The wind effectively carries pollen between plants.
