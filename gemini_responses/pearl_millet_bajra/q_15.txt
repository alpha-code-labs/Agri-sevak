As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Pearl Millet (Bajra) in Haryana:

**1. Grasshopper:**
Grasshoppers can cause significant damage to Pearl Millet, especially during the seedling and early vegetative stages.
*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Deep ploughing after harvest helps expose grasshopper eggs to predators and adverse weather conditions.
    *   Maintain field sanitation by removing weeds, which can serve as alternate hosts.
*   **Chemical Control (for severe infestations):**
    *   Spray with **Malathion** 50% EC at 1.0 - 1.25 litres per acre, mixed in 200-400 litres of water.
    *   Alternatively, spray with **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 100-120 ml per acre, mixed in 200-400 litres of water.

**2. Painted bug:**
This is not known to affect Pearl Millet (Bajra).

**3. Red cotton bug:**
This is not known to affect Pearl Millet (Bajra).

**4. Black ants:**
This is not known to affect Pearl Millet (Bajra) as a direct pest causing economic damage to the crop. While ants may be present in the field, they are generally not considered a primary pest of the standing pearl millet crop.
