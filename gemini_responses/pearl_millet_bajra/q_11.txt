As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I advise on the control of pests in Pearl Millet (Bajra) based on scientific verification and practices suitable for Haryana.

Effective pest management relies on an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, mechanical, biological, and judicious chemical methods.

### Control of Beetles in Pearl Millet (Bajra)

Several beetle species can affect Pearl Millet, primarily Blister Beetles, Flea Beetles, and the adult stages of White Grubs (Chafer Beetles).

**1. Blister Beetles (Mylabris spp., Epicauta spp.):**
These beetles feed on the flowers and developing grains, causing significant yield loss.

*   **Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
    *   Monitor fields regularly, especially during flowering.
    *   Hand-picking of beetles in the early morning or late evening can be effective for small infestations.
*   **Chemical Control (Apply when infestation reaches economic threshold):**
    *   **Malathion** 50% EC: 1.0 - 1.25 L per acre (or 2-2.5 ml per litre of water).
    *   **Quinalphos** 25% EC: 1.0 - 1.25 L per acre.
    *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: 1.0 - 1.25 L per acre.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: 200-250 ml per acre.
    *   **Cypermethrin** 25% EC: 200-250 ml per acre.

**2. Flea Beetles:**
These small beetles can cause shot-hole damage to leaves, especially in young plants. Severe infestations can stunt growth.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Maintain good field sanitation.
    *   Ensure vigorous plant growth through proper nutrition and irrigation.
*   **Chemical Control (If infestation is severe on young plants):**
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: 100-125 ml per acre.
    *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: 50-100 g per acre.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: 200-250 ml per acre.

**3. White Grub Adults (Chafer Beetles):**
While the grubs (larvae) are major root feeders, the adult beetles feed on foliage and are responsible for laying eggs. Controlling adults can reduce subsequent grub populations.

*   **Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
    *   Deep ploughing after harvest to expose grubs and pupae to predators and sun.
    *   Install light traps during the monsoon season to attract and collect adult beetles.
*   **Chemical Control (Targeting adults to prevent egg laying):**
    *   **Quinalphos** 25% EC: 1.0 - 1.25 L per acre.
    *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: 1.0 - 1.25 L per acre.
    *   **Malathion** 50% EC: 1.0 - 1.25 L per acre.

### Control of Weevils in Pearl Millet (Bajra)

This is not known to affect Pearl Millet (Bajra) as a significant field pest. While weevils are major pests of stored grains, they are generally not a primary concern for pearl millet in the field in Haryana.

### Control of Sawflies in Pearl Millet (Bajra)

This is not known to affect Pearl Millet (Bajra). Sawflies are typically pests of other crops like mustard or wheat, but not pearl millet.

**General Recommendations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully.
*   Use appropriate safety gear (gloves, mask, protective clothing) when handling and applying pesticides.
*   Consult your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and the prevailing pest situation.
