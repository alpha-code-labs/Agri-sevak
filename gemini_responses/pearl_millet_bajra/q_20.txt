As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I advise on addressing micronutrient deficiencies in Pearl Millet (Bajra) based on scientific research and recommendations for Haryana's agro-climatic conditions.

It is crucial to conduct a soil test to accurately diagnose specific micronutrient deficiencies before applying any corrective measures. This ensures targeted and efficient nutrient management.

Here's how to address the specified micronutrient deficiencies in Pearl Millet:

### General Recommendations:
*   Foliar applications are generally more effective for quick correction of micronutrient deficiencies, especially when symptoms are visible.
*   Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage during spraying.
*   Always use clean water for preparing spray solutions.
*   Avoid spraying during hot midday hours or when rain is expected.

### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

Zinc deficiency is one of the most widespread micronutrient problems in Pearl Millet in Haryana, often exacerbated by alkaline soils.

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, often leading to a "little leaf" appearance, and bronzing of older leaves.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Soil Application (Preventive):**
        *   Apply **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** at 25 kg/acre at the time of sowing.
    *   **Foliar Application (Curative):**
        *   Spray a 0.5% solution of **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (5 g/L of water) mixed with 0.25% unslaked lime (2.5 g/L of water) to neutralize acidity.
        *   Alternatively, spray a 0.1% solution of **Chelated Zinc (Zn-EDTA)** (1 g/L of water).
        *   Apply the first spray at the tillering stage and a second spray before flowering if symptoms persist.

### 2. Iron (Fe) Deficiency

Iron deficiency, commonly known as iron chlorosis, is also prevalent in Pearl Millet, particularly in calcareous and alkaline soils of Haryana.

*   **Symptoms:** Prominent yellowing of young leaves, with veins remaining green (interveinal chlorosis). In severe cases, the entire leaf may turn pale yellow or white.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray a 0.5-1.0% solution of **Ferrous sulphate heptahydrate** (5-10 g/L of water).
        *   Alternatively, spray a 0.1% solution of **Chelated Iron (Fe-EDTA or Fe-DTPA)** (1 g/L of water).
        *   Repeat sprays 2-3 times at 7-10 day intervals until symptoms disappear.

### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

Boron deficiency can affect reproductive growth and overall plant development in Pearl Millet.

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, thickening and brittleness of young leaves, poor pollen viability, reduced seed set, and malformed ear heads.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Soil Application (if severe and confirmed by soil test):**
        *   Apply **Borax (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate)** at 1-2 kg/acre before sowing.
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray a 0.1-0.2% solution of **Borax (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate)** (1-2 g/L of water) or **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (1-2 g/L of water).
        *   Apply at the tillering stage and again at the pre-flowering stage.

### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

Calcium deficiency is less common as a primary issue in Pearl Millet in Haryana's generally alkaline soils but can occur under specific conditions.

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, deformation and necrosis (death) of young leaves and growing points, poor root development, and weak stems.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray a 0.5-1.0% solution of **Calcium nitrate** (5-10 g/L of water) or **Calcium chloride** (5-10 g/L of water).
        *   Apply at early growth stages if symptoms are observed.

### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

Magnesium deficiency can occur in Pearl Millet, particularly in sandy soils or where there is an imbalance with other cations like potassium.

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis of older leaves (veins remain green while tissue between them yellows), sometimes leading to purplish discoloration in severe cases.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Soil Application (if severe and confirmed):**
        *   Apply **Magnesium sulphate heptahydrate** at 10-20 kg/acre before sowing.
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray a 0.5-1.0% solution of **Magnesium sulphate heptahydrate** (5-10 g/L of water).
        *   Apply at the tillering stage and repeat if necessary.

### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

Manganese deficiency is less common than Zinc or Iron deficiency but can occur in Pearl Millet, especially in high pH soils.

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis of young leaves, often accompanied by small necrotic spots, and stunted growth.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray a 0.5% solution of **Manganese sulphate monohydrate** (5 g/L of water).
        *   Alternatively, spray a 0.1% solution of **Chelated Manganese (Mn-EDTA)** (1 g/L of water).
        *   Repeat if necessary after 10-15 days.

Always consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and recent soil test reports.
