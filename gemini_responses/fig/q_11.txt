As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an integrated pest management approach for controlling pests in Fig (Anjeer) plants, focusing on cultural practices alongside judicious use of CIBRC-approved chemicals when necessary.

Here's the advice for Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies in Fig:

### 1. Beetles in Fig

The most significant beetle pest affecting Fig in our region is often the Fig Borer (*Batocera rufomaculata*), a longhorn beetle whose larvae bore into the trunk and branches, causing severe damage. Other beetles might include leaf feeders, but borers are the primary concern.

**A. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   **Regular Inspection:** Frequently inspect trunks and branches for signs of borer activity, such as sawdust-like frass, gum exudation, or boreholes.
*   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy severely infested branches showing wilting or dieback.
*   **Mechanical Removal:** If boreholes are fresh, try to extract the grubs using a hooked wire.
*   **Tree Health:** Maintain good tree vigour through proper nutrition and irrigation, as healthy trees are more resilient to pest attacks.
*   **Cleanliness:** Keep the area around the tree clean to remove potential breeding sites.

**B. Chemical Control (for Borers and other significant beetle infestations):**
For borers, direct treatment of boreholes is most effective. For general leaf-feeding beetles, foliar sprays can be used.

*   **For Borers (Trunk/Branch Injection/Fumigation):**
    *   Identify active boreholes.
    *   **Method 1 (Injection):** Inject a solution of **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 10-20 ml per litre of water, or **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL at 0.5-1 ml per litre of water, into each borehole using a syringe. After injection, plug the hole with wet mud or cotton to trap the fumes.
    *   **Method 2 (Swabbing/Drenching):** For young trees or where borers are superficial, a solution of **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 2.5 ml per litre of water can be swabbed or drenched on the affected trunk/branch area.
*   **For Leaf-Feeding Beetles (Foliar Spray, if severe):**
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Cypermethrin** 25% EC at 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Fipronil** 5% SC at 1.5-2 ml per litre of water.

### 2. Weevils in Fig

Weevils are a type of beetle. While some generalist weevils might occasionally feed on fig leaves or roots, they are not typically considered a major, specific pest of Fig in Haryana that requires dedicated control measures beyond general beetle management. If their population warrants intervention, the foliar spray recommendations for leaf-feeding beetles (as listed above) would generally be effective. For root weevils, soil drenching with **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 2.5 ml per litre of water around the base of the tree might be considered, but this is rarely necessary for Fig.

### 3. Sawflies in Fig

This is not known to affect Fig.
