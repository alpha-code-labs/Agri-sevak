As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling physical damage in Fig cultivation in Haryana:

### Control of Physical Damage in Fig

**1. Fruit Bursting (Cracking)**

Fruit bursting is primarily a physiological disorder caused by rapid changes in soil moisture, leading to uneven expansion of the fruit pulp and skin. Nutrient deficiencies can also contribute.

*   **Consistent Water Management:**
    *   Maintain uniform soil moisture throughout the fruit development period. Avoid sudden heavy irrigation after a dry spell, especially when fruits are nearing maturity.
    *   Implement drip irrigation to ensure precise and consistent water delivery, minimizing fluctuations.
    *   Mulch around the base of the trees with organic materials (e.g., straw, dry leaves) to conserve soil moisture and regulate soil temperature.
*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Ensure adequate availability of Calcium and Boron, which are crucial for cell wall integrity and fruit skin elasticity.
    *   **Foliar spray:** Apply **Calcium chloride** (5 g/L of water) or **Calcium nitrate** (5 g/L of water) at the fruit development stage. Repeat 2-3 times at 10-15 day intervals.
    *   **Foliar spray:** Apply **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (1 g/L of water) or **Boric acid** (1 g/L of water) during fruit set and development.
*   **Shade and Humidity:**
    *   In areas with high temperatures and low humidity, consider providing partial shade using shade nets (30-50%) during peak summer months to reduce transpiration stress on fruits.
*   **Varietal Selection:**
    *   Where possible, choose Fig varieties known to be less susceptible to fruit cracking.

**2. Leaf Burning/Melting**

Leaf burning (often referred to as sunscald or scorch) and "melting" (which can be an extreme form of burning or rapid tissue breakdown) are typically caused by high temperatures, intense sunlight, water stress, or salinity.

*   **Adequate and Consistent Irrigation:**
    *   Ensure the trees receive sufficient water, especially during hot and dry periods, to prevent water stress that can lead to leaf desiccation and burning.
    *   Use drip irrigation for efficient water delivery.
*   **Shade Management:**
    *   Provide partial shade (e.g., using 30-50% shade nets) during the hottest months of summer, especially for young plants or varieties sensitive to intense sun.
    *   Proper tree spacing can allow for some self-shading.
*   **Mulching:**
    *   Apply a thick layer of organic mulch around the tree base to keep the soil cool, conserve moisture, and reduce heat reflection onto lower leaves.
*   **Nutrient and Water Quality Management:**
    *   Avoid excessive use of fertilizers, especially nitrogen, which can make leaves more susceptible to burn.
    *   Test soil and irrigation water for salinity. High salt levels can lead to leaf tip burn. If salinity is an issue, consider leaching with good quality water or using salt-tolerant rootstocks/varieties.
*   **Proper Spray Application:**
    *   If applying any foliar sprays (pesticides or nutrients), ensure they are applied during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to prevent phytotoxicity, which can manifest as leaf burn. Always follow recommended dosages.

**3. Hardness in Fruit**

Hardness in fruit can result from various factors including water stress, nutrient imbalances, or premature harvesting.

*   **Optimal Water Supply:**
    *   Maintain consistent and adequate soil moisture throughout the fruit development period. Water stress, particularly during fruit enlargement, can lead to smaller, harder fruits with poor texture.
    *   Drip irrigation is highly recommended for precise water management.
*   **Balanced Nutrient Management:**
    *   Ensure a balanced supply of essential nutrients, particularly Potassium, which is vital for fruit size, sugar accumulation, and overall quality. Calcium also contributes to fruit firmness and texture.
    *   **Soil application:** Apply **Potassium sulphate** as per soil test recommendations.
    *   **Foliar spray:** Apply **Potassium nitrate** (10 g/L of water) during fruit development stages to enhance fruit quality and reduce hardness.
    *   **Foliar spray:** Apply **Calcium nitrate** (5 g/L of water) during fruit development to improve cell wall integrity and fruit texture.
*   **Timely Harvesting:**
    *   Harvest fruits at the correct stage of maturity. Harvesting too early will result in hard, unripe fruits. Fig fruits do not ripen significantly after harvest, so they must be picked when fully mature on the tree.
*   **Pruning:**
    *   Proper pruning to ensure good light penetration and air circulation can contribute to uniform fruit development and ripening. Avoid over-cropping, which can stress the tree and lead to smaller, harder fruits.
