As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following doses of organic manures and bio-stimulants for Fig cultivation in Haryana, based on scientific research and best practices:

*   **Well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM)**:
    *   **Young trees (1-3 years)**: 5-10 kg per tree per year.
    *   **Mature/Bearing trees (4+ years)**: 15-20 kg per tree per year.
    *   *Application*: Apply in two split doses, once before the monsoon (June-July) and another after fruit harvest (October-November). Spread evenly around the tree basin and lightly incorporate into the soil.

*   **Vermicompost**:
    *   **Young trees (1-3 years)**: 1-2 kg per tree per year.
    *   **Mature/Bearing trees (4+ years)**: 3-5 kg per tree per year.
    *   *Application*: Can be applied similarly to FYM, either as a supplement or partial replacement, mixed into the soil around the tree basin.

*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract based Plant Growth Promoter)**:
    *   *Nature*: This is a bio-stimulant, not a bulk organic manure. It enhances nutrient uptake and plant vigour.
    *   **Foliar Spray**: 2.5-5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Soil Drench**: 1-2 litres per acre, diluted in sufficient water (e.g., 200-400 litres of water).
    *   *Application*: Typically 2-3 applications per year during critical growth stages such as pre-flowering, fruit set, and fruit development. Always follow the specific product instructions for optimal results.

**Important Considerations:**
*   The exact doses may vary slightly depending on the soil type, its existing fertility, and the specific variety of Fig.
*   Regular soil testing is highly recommended to determine the precise nutrient requirements of your orchard and to tailor the manure application accordingly.
