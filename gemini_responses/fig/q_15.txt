As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Fig cultivation in Haryana:

### Control Measures for Pests in Fig

**1. Grasshopper**
Grasshoppers are polyphagous pests that can feed on the leaves and young shoots of fig trees, causing defoliation.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Regular weeding around the fig trees to remove alternative host plants and breeding sites.
    *   Hand-picking of grasshoppers in the early morning or late evening for small infestations.
*   **Chemical Control (for severe infestations):**
    *   Spray with **Malathion** 50% EC at 1.0 - 1.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   Alternatively, spray with **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 0.5 ml per litre of water.

**2. Painted Bug (Bagrada hilaris)**
This is not known to affect Fig. Painted bug primarily infests cruciferous crops like mustard, cabbage, and radish.

**3. Red Cotton Bug (Dysdercus cingulatus)**
This is not known to affect Fig. Red cotton bug is a pest primarily of cotton, okra, and other malvaceous plants, feeding on developing seeds.

**4. Black Ants**
Black ants can be a nuisance in fig orchards. They often protect honeydew-producing insects (like aphids, mealybugs, or scales) on the fig trees, which can lead to sooty mould development. They can also feed on ripe fruit or nest around the base of the tree.

*   **Cultural and Physical Control:**
    *   Keep the area around the fig trees clean and free of debris where ants might nest.
    *   Prune any branches that are touching the ground or other structures, providing ants with access to the tree.
    *   Apply sticky bands or grease barriers around the trunk of the fig tree to prevent ants from climbing up.
    *   If ants are farming honeydew-producing insects, the primary control should target those sucking pests.
*   **Chemical Control (for direct ant control, especially nests):**
    *   Drench ant nests around the base of the tree with **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 2.5 ml per litre of water. This helps to eliminate the colony.
    *   Alternatively, spray the base of the tree and ant trails with **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 2.5 ml per litre of water.
