As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an Integrated Weed Management (IWM) approach for controlling weeds in Fig (Ficus carica) orchards. This involves a combination of cultural, mechanical, and judicious chemical methods to ensure sustainable and effective weed control while safeguarding the health of your Fig trees.

### Integrated Weed Management in Fig Orchards

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Methods:**

*   **Intercultivation/Hoeing:** Regular shallow intercultivation or hoeing between rows and around the base of trees can effectively control young weeds. Care must be taken to avoid damaging the shallow root system of Fig trees.
*   **Hand Weeding:** Especially for weeds growing close to the tree trunk, hand weeding is the safest and most effective method. This is crucial for parasitic weeds like Amarbail.
*   **Mulching:** Applying organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves, wood chips) around the base of Fig trees can suppress weed growth, conserve soil moisture, and improve soil health. Maintain a mulch-free zone immediately around the trunk to prevent collar rot.
*   **Cover Cropping:** In wider inter-row spaces, growing suitable leguminous cover crops can suppress weeds, improve soil fertility, and reduce erosion. However, ensure the cover crop does not compete excessively with Fig trees for water and nutrients.

**2. Chemical Control (Use with extreme caution and as directed sprays):**

Chemical control should be used as a supplementary measure, primarily for inter-row weed management. Always apply herbicides as directed sprays, avoiding contact with the Fig tree trunk, branches, and foliage, especially in young trees. Use a protective shield while spraying.

**For Broadleaf Weeds (including Bathu, Congress grass) and Narrowleaf Weeds (including Phalaris minor):**

*   **Pre-emergence Herbicides (for preventing weed germination):**
    *   Apply to a clean, moist soil surface before weed emergence.
    *   **Pendimethalin 30% EC:** Apply at 3.3 litres per acre in 200-300 litres of water.
    *   **Oxyfluorfen 23.5% EC:** Apply at 0.85-1.7 litres per acre in 200-300 litres of water.

*   **Post-emergence Herbicides (for controlling emerged weeds):**
    *   Apply when weeds are young and actively growing (typically 2-4 leaf stage).
    *   **Glyphosate 41% SL:** Apply at 2.5-3.75 litres per acre in 200-300 litres of water. This is a non-selective, systemic herbicide.
    *   **Paraquat dichloride 24% SL:** Apply at 2.0-4.0 litres per acre in 200-300 litres of water. This is a non-selective, contact herbicide.
    *   **Glufosinate-ammonium 13.5% SL:** Apply at 3.0-4.5 litres per acre in 200-300 litres of water. This is a non-selective, contact herbicide.

**For Amarbail (Cuscuta spp.):**

Amarbail is a parasitic weed that can severely damage Fig trees. Control requires a multi-pronged approach:

*   **Manual Removal:** This is the most effective method. As soon as Amarbail is noticed, manually remove it by cutting the affected branches of the Fig tree and burning the removed parasitic weed material away from the orchard. Ensure no fragments are left on the ground.
*   **Pre-emergence:** **Pendimethalin 30% EC** (as mentioned above) can offer some suppression if applied before Cuscuta seeds germinate.
*   **Post-emergence (Extreme Caution):** In severe infestations, a very careful, directed spot application of **Paraquat dichloride 24% SL** (at 2.0-4.0 litres per acre in 200-300 litres of water) can be attempted on the Amarbail itself, ensuring absolutely no spray drift or contact with the Fig tree foliage or green bark. This is highly risky and generally not recommended due to the non-selective nature of the herbicide and the difficulty in targeting only the parasite without harming the host. Manual removal remains the preferred method.

**For Orobanche:**

This is not known to affect Fig. Orobanche species are typically root parasites of specific dicotyledonous field crops (e.g., mustard, brinjal, tobacco) and are not reported as a pest of Fig (Ficus carica).

### Important Precautions for Herbicide Application:

*   **Read the Label:** Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the herbicide label regarding dosage, application method, safety precautions, and re-entry intervals.
*   **Directed Spray:** Use a protective hood or shield on the spray nozzle to prevent herbicide drift onto the Fig tree foliage, trunk, or fruit.
*   **Weather Conditions:** Apply herbicides on calm days to minimize drift. Avoid spraying during windy conditions or when rain is expected shortly after application.
*   **Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):** Always wear appropriate PPE, including gloves, mask, protective clothing, and eye protection, during mixing and spraying.
*   **Storage and Disposal:** Store herbicides safely away from children and livestock. Dispose of empty containers as per local regulations.
*   **Water Quality:** Use clean water for mixing herbicides.
*   **Timing:** For post-emergence herbicides, apply when weeds are young and actively growing for best results.

By implementing these integrated strategies, you can effectively manage weeds in your Fig orchard in Haryana.
