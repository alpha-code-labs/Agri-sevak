Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the challenges posed by sucking pests in Fig cultivation. These pests, including Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, Thrips, and Psylla, can significantly reduce yield and quality if not managed effectively.

Here's a scientifically verified approach for their control in Fig:

### Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Approach

A holistic approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods is most effective and sustainable.

1.  **Monitoring:**
    *   Regularly inspect your fig plants, especially the undersides of leaves and new shoots, for the presence of pests or symptoms like curling leaves, honeydew, sooty mould, or stunted growth.
    *   Yellow sticky traps can be used to monitor adult whiteflies, leafhoppers, and thrips.

2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy infested plant parts (leaves, shoots) to reduce pest populations. Ensure proper aeration within the canopy.
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the area around fig trees free of weeds, as they can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush, soft growth that is more attractive to sucking pests.
    *   **Water Management:** Ensure proper irrigation to maintain plant vigour, as stressed plants are more susceptible.

3.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Encourage natural enemies like ladybird beetles, lacewings, and predatory mites, which feed on aphids, whiteflies, and thrips. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.
    *   Parasitoids (e.g., *Encarsia formosa* for whiteflies) can also play a role.

### Chemical Control (When Necessary)

When pest populations reach economic threshold levels and cultural/biological methods are insufficient, judicious use of CIBRC-approved insecticides is recommended. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development. Apply sprays preferably in the evening or early morning.

Here are some CIBRC-approved technical chemical names and their recommended dosages for foliar application:

*   **For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, Thrips, and Psylla:**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** 0.5 - 0.75 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** 0.2 - 0.3 g per litre of water.
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** 0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water.
    *   **Dinotefuran 20% SG:** 0.2 - 0.3 g per litre of water.

*   **Specifically for Whiteflies (especially nymphs) and Hoppers:**
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** 1.25 - 1.5 ml per litre of water. (Acts as an insect growth regulator, effective on nymphs).
    *   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** 0.5 - 0.75 ml per litre of water. (Also effective against mites).

*   **For Thrips and Aphids:**
    *   **Flonicamid 50% WG:** 0.3 - 0.4 g per litre of water.

*   **Botanical Option (for early infestation and IPM compatibility):**
    *   **Azadirachtin (e.g., 1500 ppm):** 3 - 5 ml per litre of water. (Higher concentrations like 10000 ppm would require lower dosages as per product label).

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) like gloves, masks, and protective clothing while handling and spraying chemicals.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Strictly observe the Pre-Harvest Interval mentioned on the product label to ensure the safety of the harvested fruit.
*   **Spray Coverage:** Ensure thorough coverage of the plant, especially the undersides of leaves where sucking pests often reside.
*   **Resistance Management:** Never use the same chemical repeatedly. Rotate insecticides with different modes of action (different chemical groups) to prevent pests from developing resistance.
