As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the maturity signs, harvesting time, and cutting process for Fig (Ficus carica) in Haryana:

### Maturity Signs for Fig

Identifying the correct maturity stage is crucial for optimal flavour, texture, and shelf life of figs. Look for the following indicators:

*   **Colour Change:** The skin colour changes from green to the characteristic colour of the specific variety (e.g., purple, brown, yellow, or reddish-brown). This is often the most noticeable sign.
*   **Softness:** The fruit becomes soft and yields slightly to gentle pressure. It should not be hard or firm.
*   **Drooping:** Ripe figs often hang downwards on the branch, appearing heavy and fully developed.
*   **Skin Cracks:** Small, fine cracks may appear on the skin, especially near the stem end, indicating full ripeness and sugar development.
*   **"Fig Eye" (Ostiole) Nectar:** A small drop of sugary liquid (nectar) may appear at the "eye" or ostiole end of the fruit. This is a strong indicator of peak ripeness.
*   **Aroma:** A distinct, sweet, and fruity aroma develops as the fig ripens.

### Harvesting Time for Fig

Figs are delicate and do not ripen significantly after harvest, so they must be picked when fully ripe on the tree.

*   **Ripeness:** Harvest figs when they exhibit all or most of the maturity signs mentioned above.
*   **Season in Haryana:**
    *   **Main Crop (Monsoon/Kharif):** Fruits typically mature from July to September.
    *   **Second Crop (Winter/Rabi):** Depending on the variety and local conditions, a second, smaller crop may mature from February to May.
*   **Frequency:** During the peak harvesting season, figs ripen quickly. Harvesting should be done daily or every other day to ensure optimal quality and prevent over-ripening or spoilage on the tree.
*   **Time of Day:** Harvest in the early morning after the dew has dried, or in the late afternoon. This avoids the hottest part of the day, which can stress the fruit and reduce its post-harvest life.

### Cutting Process for Fig

Figs are highly perishable and bruise easily, requiring careful handling during harvesting.

*   **Gentle Handling:** Always handle figs with extreme care to prevent bruising and damage to the delicate skin.
*   **Method:**
    *   **Twist and Pull:** Gently twist the fruit from the stem, ensuring the short stem (pedicel) remains attached to the fig. This is important as it helps prevent sap leakage and extends the shelf life of the fruit.
    *   **Shears/Knife:** Alternatively, use small, sharp pruning shears or a knife to cut the stem just above the fruit. This method is often preferred for commercial harvesting to ensure a clean cut and minimal damage.
*   **Sap (Latex):** Figs produce a milky latex (sap) when picked. This sap can be irritating to the skin for some individuals. It is advisable to wear gloves during harvesting to protect your hands.
*   **Collection:** Place harvested figs immediately into shallow, well-ventilated containers (e.g., trays or baskets lined with soft material like paper or cloth). Arrange them in a single layer to prevent bruising and crushing. Avoid piling them up.
*   **Avoid Damage to Tree:** Be careful not to damage the fruiting spurs or branches during harvesting, as this can negatively impact future yields.
