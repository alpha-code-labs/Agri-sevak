Greetings from Haryana Agricultural University, Hisar. As a Senior Agronomist, I will provide scientifically verified advice for managing fungal diseases in Fig (Ficus carica) in Haryana.

Let's address each condition you've mentioned:

*   **Alternaria (Leaf Spot):** This fungal disease is known to affect Fig, causing leaf spots.
*   **Anthracnose:** This fungal disease is known to affect Fig, causing lesions on leaves, twigs, and fruits.
*   **Blast:** This is not known to affect Fig as a significant fungal disease.
*   **Blight:** Various fungal blights are known to affect Fig, causing rapid browning and death of plant tissues.
*   **Brown spot:** This fungal disease is known to affect Fig, primarily causing brown spots on leaves.
*   **Downy Mildew:** This is not known to affect Fig.
*   **Powdery Mildew:** This fungal disease is known to affect Fig, appearing as white, powdery patches on leaves and young shoots.
*   **Grey Mildew:** This is not known to affect Fig as a distinct fungal disease.

For the fungal diseases that affect Fig (Alternaria, Anthracnose, Blight, Brown spot, and Powdery Mildew), an integrated approach combining cultural practices and judicious chemical control is recommended.

**General Control Measures for Fungal Diseases in Fig:**

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy infected plant parts (leaves, twigs, fruits) to reduce inoculum sources.
*   **Pruning:** Ensure proper air circulation within the canopy by regular and judicious pruning. This helps reduce humidity, which is favorable for fungal growth.
*   **Weed Management:** Keep the area around fig trees free of weeds, as they can harbor pests and diseases and impede air circulation.
*   **Watering:** Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day, to keep foliage dry. Drip irrigation is preferred where feasible.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure balanced fertilization to promote healthy plant growth and improve natural resistance. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can lead to lush, susceptible growth.

**2. Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
Apply fungicides preventively or at the first sign of disease symptoms. Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) mentioned on the product label.

**For Broad-Spectrum Fungal Diseases (Alternaria, Anthracnose, Blight, Brown spot):**
*   **Mancozeb:** Apply at 2.0-2.5 g/L of water.
*   **Chlorothalonil:** Apply at 2.0-2.5 g/L of water.
*   **Copper Oxychloride:** Apply at 2.5-3.0 g/L of water.
*   **Carbendazim:** Apply at 0.5-1.0 g/L of water.
*   **Thiophanate Methyl:** Apply at 0.7-1.0 g/L of water.
*   **Azoxystrobin:** Apply at 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water.
*   **Tebuconazole:** Apply at 0.75-1.0 ml/L of water.

**Specifically for Powdery Mildew:**
*   **Myclobutanil:** Apply at 0.4-0.6 g/L of water.
*   **Hexaconazole:** Apply at 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water.
*   **Propiconazole:** Apply at 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water.
*   **Sulphur (Wettable Sulphur):** Apply at 2.0-3.0 g/L of water (effective for powdery mildew, but avoid application during very hot weather, typically above 30°C, to prevent phytotoxicity).

**Recommended Spray Schedule (General Guidance):**
*   Initiate sprays with a protective fungicide (e.g., **Mancozeb** or **Chlorothalonil**) during periods favorable for disease development or at critical growth stages.
*   If disease symptoms appear, use a systemic fungicide (e.g., **Carbendazim**, **Thiophanate Methyl**, **Azoxystrobin**, **Tebuconazole**) or a combination product.
*   For powdery mildew, specifically target with **Myclobutanil**, **Hexaconazole**, **Propiconazole**, or **Sulphur**.
*   Rotate between different chemical groups (e.g., contact vs. systemic, different modes of action) to effectively manage the disease and prevent the development of fungicide resistance.

Always ensure thorough coverage of the plant foliage during spraying. For precise recommendations tailored to your specific farm conditions and the latest CIBRC guidelines, it is advisable to consult your local agricultural extension office.
