### Control of Dieback and Twig Blight in Fig

Dieback and Twig blight are common fungal diseases in fig, often caused by pathogens like *Lasiodiplodia theobromae* (syn. *Botryodiplodia theobromae*) or *Phomopsis* species. These diseases lead to the drying and death of branches and twigs, typically starting from the tip and progressing downwards.

**1. Cultural Practices:**

*   **Pruning:** Immediately prune all affected branches and twigs. Make clean cuts well below the visible symptoms, into healthy wood.
*   **Sanitation:** Collect and destroy all pruned material (preferably by burning) to eliminate the source of inoculum.
*   **Tool Sterilization:** Disinfect pruning tools (secateurs, saws) with a 10% bleach solution or methylated spirit after each cut and between trees to prevent the spread of pathogens.
*   **Wound Protection:** For larger pruning cuts, apply a fungicidal paste or Bordeaux paste to protect the wound from pathogen entry.
*   **Maintain Tree Vigor:** Ensure proper nutrition, irrigation, and drainage. Healthy, vigorous trees are more resistant to diseases. Avoid waterlogging.
*   **Avoid Injury:** Protect trees from mechanical injuries, which can serve as entry points for fungal pathogens.

**2. Chemical Control:**

*   **Preventive and Post-Pruning Sprays:** Apply fungicides as a preventive measure during periods of high humidity or after pruning operations.
*   **Recommended CIBRC Approved Fungicides:**
    *   **Copper Oxychloride** 50% WP: Apply at 2.5-3.0 g/L of water.
    *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: Apply at 0.5-1.0 g/L of water.
    *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP: Apply at 2.0-2.5 g/L of water.
*   **Application:** Ensure thorough coverage of the entire tree, including foliage and woody parts. Repeat applications may be necessary based on disease severity and prevailing weather conditions, always following the product label instructions.

### Control of Tikka Disease in Fig

This is not known to affect Fig. Tikka disease is a specific common name for a leaf spot disease primarily affecting groundnut (peanut) crops, caused by *Cercospora arachidicola* and *Phaeoisariopsis personata*. Fig trees can suffer from various leaf spot diseases, but they are not referred to as "Tikka disease."
