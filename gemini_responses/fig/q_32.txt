Drying up of branches, leaves, fruits, and flowers in Fig (Ficus carica) is a general symptom that can indicate various underlying issues, ranging from abiotic stresses to biotic diseases and pest infestations. A thorough diagnosis is crucial to identify the exact cause and implement effective management strategies.

Here's a systematic approach to address "Drying up" in Fig:

**I. Initial Observation and Diagnosis:**

Before applying any treatment, carefully observe the plant for the following:

*   **Pattern of Drying:** Is it affecting the entire plant, specific branches, leaves only, or starting from the top/bottom?
*   **Root System:** Gently examine the roots of affected plants (if possible without causing significant damage). Look for signs of rot, galls (swelling), or damage.
*   **Stem and Branches:** Check for cracks, cankers (sunken lesions), bore holes, frass (sawdust-like material), or discolouration under the bark.
*   **Leaves and Fruits:** Look for spots, lesions, discolouration, or presence of pests (e.g., scale insects, mealybugs).
*   **Soil Conditions:** Assess soil moisture, drainage, and any signs of waterlogging or extreme dryness.

**II. Potential Causes and Management Strategies:**

**A. Abiotic Stresses (Non-Biological Causes):**

These are often the most common reasons for general drying up.

1.  **Water Stress (Drought or Waterlogging):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Leaves wilt, turn yellow/brown, and dry up. Branches may die back.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Under-irrigation:** Ensure consistent and adequate irrigation, especially during dry periods and fruit development. Water deeply to encourage root growth.
        *   **Over-irrigation/Poor Drainage:** Waterlogging leads to root asphyxiation and rot, mimicking drought symptoms. Improve soil drainage by adding organic matter, creating raised beds, or improving sub-surface drainage. Avoid standing water around the base of the tree.

2.  **Nutrient Deficiencies:**
    *   **Symptoms:** General poor growth, yellowing, and premature drying of leaves.
    *   **Management:** Conduct a soil test to determine nutrient levels. Apply balanced fertilizers based on recommendations. Ensure adequate micronutrients, especially Boron and Zinc, which are crucial for fruit development and overall plant health.

3.  **Soil Salinity/Alkalinity:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Leaf margins scorch, leaves turn yellow, growth is stunted, and eventually, branches dry up.
    *   **Management:** If soil test confirms high salinity/alkalinity, apply gypsum (Calcium Sulphate) as per soil test recommendations to improve soil structure and leach out excess salts. Improve drainage and use good quality irrigation water.

4.  **Heat Stress/Sunburn:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Scorching of leaves and bark, especially on exposed branches.
    *   **Management:** Provide partial shade during extreme summer months for young plants. Apply whitewash (lime solution) to the main trunk and exposed branches to reflect sunlight and reduce heat absorption. Mulch around the base of the tree to keep soil cool and retain moisture.

**B. Biotic Stresses (Diseases and Pests):**

1.  **Root Rot / Collar Rot:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Sudden wilting and drying of leaves and branches, often affecting the entire plant. Roots appear dark, mushy, and decayed. Lesions may be visible at the collar region (junction of stem and soil).
    *   **Causative Agents:** Fungi like *Phytophthora*, *Pythium*, *Rhizoctonia*. Often associated with waterlogged conditions.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Improve drainage. Remove and destroy severely affected plants.
        *   For early stages, drench the soil around the root zone with fungicides.
        *   **Chemical Control:**
            *   **Metalaxyl-M + Mancozeb** (e.g., 2.5 g/L of water) as a soil drench.
            *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride** (e.g., 2-3 ml/L of water) as a soil drench.

2.  **Vascular Wilts (e.g., Fusarium Wilt, Verticillium Wilt):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Wilting and yellowing of leaves, often starting on one side of the plant or a specific branch, followed by drying and dieback. Cutting open an affected stem or branch may reveal discoloured vascular tissue (brown streaks).
    *   **Causative Agents:** Fungi like *Fusarium oxysporum* or *Verticillium dahliae*.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Remove and destroy affected branches or entire plants to prevent spread.
        *   Improve soil health and drainage.
        *   **Chemical Control:** Drenching with systemic fungicides can be attempted in early stages, but effectiveness is limited once the disease is established.
            *   **Carbendazim** (e.g., 1-2 g/L of water) as a soil drench around the root zone.

3.  **Cankers and Dieback:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Sunken, discoloured lesions (cankers) on branches or the main stem, leading to the death and drying of the branch beyond the canker.
    *   **Causative Agents:** Various fungi and bacteria. Often enter through wounds.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Prune out affected branches well below the canker into healthy wood. Sterilize pruning tools between cuts.
        *   Apply a fungicidal paste to large pruning wounds.
        *   **Chemical Control:**
            *   **Copper oxychloride** (e.g., 3-4 g/L of water) as a spray or mixed into a paste for wound dressing.

4.  **Stem Borers:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Wilting and drying of individual branches, often with bore holes visible on the stem/branch, sometimes with frass (sawdust-like material) extruding from the holes.
    *   **Causative Agents:** Larvae of various beetle species.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Locate bore holes. Inject a solution of insecticide into the holes and plug them with mud or wax.
        *   **Chemical Control:**
            *   **Chlorpyrifos** (e.g., 2 ml/L of water) injected into bore holes or swabbed on affected stem areas.

5.  **Nematodes (Root-Knot Nematodes):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, yellowing, wilting, and drying of leaves due to damaged roots. Roots will show characteristic galls or swellings.
    *   **Causative Agents:** *Meloidogyne* species.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Improve soil organic matter content, which encourages beneficial microorganisms that prey on nematodes.
        *   Crop rotation with non-host plants.
        *   Solarization of soil before planting.
        *   **Chemical Control:** Nematicides are generally not recommended for established trees due to environmental concerns and limited efficacy. Focus on cultural practices and soil health. If severe, consult HAU for specific recommendations based on soil test results.

**III. General Recommendations:**

*   **Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy all dried, diseased, or pest-infested plant parts to prevent the spread of problems.
*   **Pruning:** Prune fig trees annually to remove dead, diseased, or crossing branches, improving air circulation and plant vigour.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure the plant receives adequate and balanced nutrients throughout its growth cycle.
*   **Mulching:** Apply organic mulch around the base of the tree to conserve soil moisture, regulate soil temperature, and suppress weeds.
