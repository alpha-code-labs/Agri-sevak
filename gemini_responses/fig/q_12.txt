As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an integrated approach for managing Scale insects and Mealybugs in Fig, focusing on timely intervention and scientifically verified methods suitable for Haryana's conditions.

Both Scale insects and Mealybugs are sap-sucking pests that can significantly damage Fig plants by weakening them, causing yellowing, leaf drop, and reduced fruit quality and yield. They also excrete honeydew, leading to the growth of sooty mold, which interferes with photosynthesis.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategy:**

1.  **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your Fig plants, especially the undersides of leaves, stems, branch crotches, and developing fruits, for early signs of these pests. Look for waxy coverings, cottony masses, or sticky honeydew.

2.  **Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
    *   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy heavily infested branches, leaves, or fruits. This reduces the pest population and prevents further spread.
    *   **Water Spray:** For small infestations, a strong jet of water can dislodge mealybugs and scale crawlers.
    *   **Sanitation:** Keep the area around the Fig trees free of weeds and debris, which can harbor pests.
    *   **Ant Control:** Ants often protect mealybugs and scales to harvest their honeydew. Control ant populations around the Fig trees to allow natural enemies to work effectively.

3.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Encourage natural enemies such as ladybird beetles, lacewings, and parasitic wasps. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that can harm these beneficial insects.

4.  **Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved):**
    When infestations are severe and cultural/biological methods are insufficient, chemical control may be necessary. Always follow label instructions carefully, including dosage, application method, and pre-harvest interval (PHI). Apply sprays thoroughly, ensuring good coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and in crevices where pests hide.

    **For Scale Insects and Mealybugs:**

    *   **Systemic Insecticides (effective against both pests, absorbed by the plant):**
        *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at a rate of **0.5 - 1.0 ml per litre of water**.
        *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at a rate of **0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water**.
        *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply at a rate of **0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water**.
        *   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:** Apply at a rate of **0.75 - 1.0 ml per litre of water**. This insecticide offers excellent translaminar and systemic action, reaching pests even in hidden locations.

    *   **Insect Growth Regulators (IGR) (primarily targets nymphs/crawlers):**
        *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at a rate of **1.25 - 1.5 ml per litre of water**. This is particularly effective against the nymphal stages of both pests, preventing them from developing into adults.

    *   **Horticultural Mineral Oil (smothers pests):**
        *   **Horticultural Mineral Oil (e.g., 80% EC):** Apply at a rate of **5 - 10 ml per litre of water** during the growing season (check label for specific concentrations and phytotoxicity warnings for Fig). For dormant season application (if applicable for Fig in Haryana), higher concentrations up to 20 ml/L can be used. This works by suffocating the pests, especially the crawler stages of scales and mealybugs. It can also be mixed with some systemic insecticides for enhanced efficacy (always check compatibility).

    **Important Considerations:**
    *   **Timing:** For scale insects, targeting the crawler stage (newly hatched nymphs) is most effective as they are not yet protected by a waxy covering. For mealybugs, early detection and treatment are crucial.
    *   **Rotation:** Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
    *   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, and protective clothing during mixing and application.
    *   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Strictly observe the pre-harvest interval mentioned on the insecticide label to ensure the safety of the fruits for consumption.

This comprehensive approach will help you effectively manage Scale insects and Mealybugs in your Fig cultivation in Haryana. For specific local recommendations or severe outbreaks, please consult with the entomology department at HAU, Hisar.
