Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

Addressing micronutrient deficiencies in Fig (Ficus carica) is crucial for optimal growth, yield, and fruit quality. As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I strongly recommend a scientific approach, starting with proper diagnosis. Visual symptoms can be indicative, but **soil testing and leaf tissue analysis** are the most reliable methods to confirm specific deficiencies and determine the precise quantities required.

Here's how to address the common micronutrient deficiencies in Fig, keeping in mind the soil and climatic conditions of Haryana:

### General Recommendations for Micronutrient Management:

1.  **Diagnosis is Key:** Before applying any micronutrient, confirm the deficiency through soil and/or leaf tissue analysis. Blind application can lead to imbalances or toxicities.
2.  **Soil pH Management:** Many Haryana soils are alkaline (high pH), which can reduce the availability of micronutrients like Zinc, Iron, and Manganese. Maintaining optimal soil pH (slightly acidic to neutral, 6.0-7.0) is beneficial.
3.  **Organic Matter:** Regular incorporation of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost significantly improves soil health, nutrient availability, and microbial activity, which aids in micronutrient uptake.
4.  **Application Methods:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Suitable for widespread and persistent deficiencies, especially for less mobile nutrients. Apply uniformly around the root zone.
    *   **Foliar Application:** Provides a quick response, especially effective for mobile nutrients or when soil conditions (like high pH) limit root uptake. Ensure good coverage of leaves. Add a non-ionic wetting agent for better absorption.

### Specific Micronutrient Deficiencies and Their Management in Fig:

#### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency:

*   **Symptoms:** Characterized by "little leaf" (abnormally small leaves), rosetting of leaves at the shoot tips, interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, stunted growth, and reduced fruit size and quality.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 10-25 kg/acre of **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** (21% Zn) or 5-10 kg/acre of **Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate** (33% Zn) once every 2-3 years, preferably before the monsoon or during the dormant season.
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.5% solution (5 g/L) of **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** or 0.1-0.2% solution (1-2 g/L) of **Zinc EDTA** (12% Zn). Apply 2-3 sprays at 15-day intervals during active growth, especially when new flushes appear.

#### 2. Iron (Fe) / Ferrous Deficiency:

*   **Symptoms:** Prominent interveinal chlorosis on the youngest leaves, with veins remaining distinctly green. In severe cases, entire leaves may turn pale yellow or white, leading to stunted growth and reduced vigor. Common in high pH, calcareous soils.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** In high pH soils, soil application of iron is often inefficient. However, if soil pH is suitable, apply 25-50 kg/acre of **Ferrous Sulphate** (19% Fe).
    *   **Foliar Application:** This is generally more effective in Haryana's alkaline soils. Spray 0.5-1.0% solution (5-10 g/L) of **Ferrous Sulphate** or 0.1-0.2% solution (1-2 g/L) of **Ferrous EDTA** (12% Fe). Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals until symptoms disappear.

#### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency:

*   **Symptoms:** Dieback of growing points, stunted and bushy growth, thickened and brittle leaves, poor fruit set, misshapen or cracked fruits, and internal corking or browning of fruit flesh.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 5-10 kg/acre of **Borax** (Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate, 10.5-11.3% B) or 2-4 kg/acre of **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (20% B). *Caution: Boron has a narrow range between deficiency and toxicity; apply precisely based on soil test results.*
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.1-0.2% solution (1-2 g/L) of **Borax** or **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** or **Boric Acid** (17% B). Apply 1-2 sprays before flowering and during early fruit development.

#### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency:

*   **Symptoms:** Dieback of young shoot tips, distorted or hooked young leaves, poor root development, and in fruits, it can lead to reduced firmness, poor storage quality, and sometimes internal breakdown.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** If soil test indicates low calcium, apply **Calcium Nitrate** (19% Ca) at 10-20 kg/acre, or incorporate gypsum or lime as per soil test recommendations to improve soil calcium levels and pH if needed.
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.5-1.0% solution (5-10 g/L) of **Calcium Nitrate** or **Calcium Chloride** (27% Ca). Apply 2-3 sprays during fruit development stages to improve fruit quality and firmness.

#### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency:

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, where the areas between the veins turn yellow while the veins remain green. Leaves may become brittle, curl upwards, and lead to premature defoliation.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 20-50 kg/acre of **Magnesium Sulphate** (9.6% Mg) around the root zone.
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.5-1.0% solution (5-10 g/L) of **Magnesium Sulphate**. Apply 2-3 sprays at 15-day intervals until symptoms subside.

#### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency:

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, often appearing as a fine network of green veins against a lighter green or yellowish background. In severe cases, small necrotic (dead) spots may appear. Can be confused with iron deficiency.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 10-20 kg/acre of **Manganese Sulphate** (28-30% Mn).
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.2-0.5% solution (2-5 g/L) of **Manganese Sulphate**. Apply 2-3 sprays at 15-day intervals during active growth.
