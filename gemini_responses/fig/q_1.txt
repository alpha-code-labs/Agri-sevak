This is not known to affect Fig.

Smut diseases (Black, False, Kernel, and Loose smut) are primarily diseases of cereal crops (such as wheat, barley, rice, maize, and sorghum) and some grasses, caused by specific fungi belonging to the order Ustilaginales. They are not known to affect Fig (Ficus carica). Fig trees are susceptible to other fungal diseases like rust, anthracnose, and various leaf spots, but not the smuts commonly referred to by these names.
