Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I'm pleased to provide scientifically verified advice for improving Fig (Ficus carica) yield, fruit quality, and storage life in Haryana.

Fig cultivation in Haryana holds good potential, and by adopting proper agronomic practices, significant improvements can be achieved.

### I. Improving Yield

Maximizing fig yield involves a combination of genetic potential, optimal nutrition, water management, and plant health.

1.  **Variety Selection:** Choose high-yielding, well-adapted varieties for Haryana's climate. Popular varieties include 'Poona', 'Deanna', 'Brown Turkey', and 'Black Mission'.
2.  **Soil Management:**
    *   Ensure well-drained, deep loamy soils with a pH range of 6.0-7.5.
    *   Incorporate 10-15 kg of well-rotted Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost per plant annually to improve soil structure and fertility.
3.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Nitrogen (N):** Essential for vegetative growth and fruit set. Apply in split doses.
        *   **Urea:** 200-300 g per plant per year for mature trees, split into 2-3 applications (e.g., pre-monsoon, post-monsoon).
    *   **Phosphorus (P):** Crucial for root development and flowering.
        *   **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP):** 150-200 g per plant per year, applied once or twice.
    *   **Potassium (K):** Enhances fruit development, size, and disease resistance.
        *   **Muriate of Potash (MOP):** 200-300 g per plant per year, split into 2-3 applications.
    *   **Micronutrients:** Deficiencies can severely impact yield.
        *   **Zinc Sulphate:** 20-30 g per plant annually, or foliar spray of 0.5% solution (5 g/L water) if deficiency is observed.
        *   **Borax:** 10-15 g per plant annually, or foliar spray of 0.2% solution (2 g/L water) if deficiency is observed.
    *   *Application Method:* Fertilizers should be applied in a ring around the tree canopy and lightly incorporated into the soil, followed by irrigation.
4.  **Irrigation:** Figs require consistent moisture, especially during fruit development.
    *   Irrigate regularly during dry periods, particularly from fruit set to harvest. Drip irrigation is highly recommended for efficient water use.
    *   Avoid water stress, which can lead to fruit drop and reduced size.
5.  **Pruning:**
    *   **Training Pruning:** In the initial years, train plants to a single stem or open vase system.
    *   **Annual Pruning:** Prune annually during dormancy (December-January) to remove dead, diseased, or crossing branches, and to encourage new fruiting wood. Figs bear fruit on new growth.
6.  **Pest and Disease Management:** Timely identification and management of pests (e.g., fig borer, fruit fly) and diseases (e.g., rust, leaf spot) are critical to prevent yield losses. Consult HAU for specific recommendations if issues arise.

### II. Improving Fruit Quality

High-quality figs are sweet, firm, and free from blemishes.

1.  **Balanced Nutrition:**
    *   **Potassium (K):** Adequate potassium is vital for sugar accumulation, resulting in sweeter fruits. Ensure sufficient **Muriate of Potash** application as mentioned above.
    *   **Calcium (Ca):** Contributes to fruit firmness and reduces cracking. If soil tests indicate deficiency, apply **Calcium Nitrate** (50-100 g per plant) or foliar sprays of 0.5% **Calcium Chloride** (5 g/L water) during fruit development.
2.  **Water Management:**
    *   Consistent irrigation during fruit development prevents cracking and ensures uniform ripening.
    *   Avoid excessive irrigation just before harvest, which can dilute sugars and reduce flavor.
3.  **Timely Harvesting:**
    *   Harvest figs when they are fully ripe, soft to the touch, and have developed their characteristic color. Over-ripe fruits are mushy, and under-ripe fruits lack sweetness.
    *   Harvest gently by hand, leaving a small portion of the stem attached.
4.  **Pruning for Light Penetration:** Proper pruning ensures good air circulation and sunlight penetration into the canopy, which is essential for uniform ripening and better fruit color and sugar development.
5.  **Pest and Disease Control:** Protect fruits from damage by fruit flies, birds, and fungal infections. Damaged fruits have poor quality and reduced market value.

### III. Improving Storage Life

Figs are highly perishable. Extending their storage life requires careful handling and environmental control.

1.  **Optimal Harvesting Maturity:** Harvest figs at the firm-ripe stage, just before they become fully soft. This stage offers the best balance between eating quality and shelf life.
2.  **Gentle Handling:** Figs are delicate. Handle them with extreme care to avoid bruising, cuts, or punctures, which accelerate spoilage.
3.  **Pre-cooling:** Immediately after harvest, pre-cool figs to remove field heat. This is a critical step to slow down respiration and metabolic processes.
    *   Cool fruits rapidly to 0-4°C within 1-2 hours of harvest.
4.  **Packaging:**
    *   Pack figs in shallow, single-layer trays or punnets with good ventilation.
    *   Use cushioning material (e.g., shredded paper, foam nets) to prevent movement and bruising during transport.
5.  **Temperature and Humidity Control:**
    *   **Temperature:** Store figs at low temperatures, ideally 0-2°C.
    *   **Relative Humidity (RH):** Maintain a high relative humidity of 90-95% to prevent desiccation and shriveling.
6.  **Sanitation:**
    *   Ensure all harvesting tools, crates, and storage areas are clean and sanitized to prevent the spread of post-harvest pathogens.
7.  **Avoid Ethylene Exposure:** Figs are sensitive to ethylene, a ripening hormone. Store them separately from ethylene-producing fruits (e.g., apples, bananas) to prevent premature ripening and spoilage.

By implementing these practices, fig growers in Haryana can significantly enhance their yields, improve fruit quality, and extend the storage life of their produce, leading to better market realization.
