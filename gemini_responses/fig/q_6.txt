Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding viral diseases in Fig. It's important to note that viral diseases are complex, and there is no direct chemical cure for them once a plant is infected. Management primarily focuses on prevention, controlling the vectors that spread the viruses, and cultural practices.

Let's address the specific conditions you've mentioned:

1.  **Tristeza Virus:** This is primarily a disease of citrus. **This is not known to affect Fig.**

For the other viral diseases (Leaf curl, Mosaic, Yellow vein clearing, Stripe, and Stunt virus), which are known to affect Fig, the management strategies are largely similar, focusing on preventing their spread.

**Key Viral Diseases in Fig and their Primary Vectors:**

*   **Fig Mosaic Virus (FMV):** This is the most widespread and economically important viral disease of fig. It is primarily transmitted by the Fig bud mite (*Aceria ficus*). Symptoms include mosaic patterns, yellow spots, ringspots, and leaf distortion.
*   **Fig Leaf Curl Virus (FLCV):** This is caused by begomoviruses and is transmitted by whiteflies (*Bemisia tabaci*). Symptoms include severe curling, distortion, and yellowing of leaves.
*   **Yellow Vein Clearing, Stripe, and Stunt Virus:** These can be symptoms of FMV, FLCV, or other less common viral agents, often transmitted by various sucking pests or through propagation.

**Control Measures for Viral Diseases in Fig:**

The strategy revolves around preventing infection and managing the vectors.

**I. Use of Disease-Free Planting Material:**
This is the most critical step.
*   Always source planting material (cuttings, saplings) from certified, reputable nurseries known to provide virus-free stock.
*   Visually inspect all new plants for any symptoms of viral diseases before planting.

**II. Vector Management:**
Controlling the insects and mites that transmit viruses is crucial.

**A. For Fig Bud Mites (Primary vector for Fig Mosaic Virus):**
*   **Cultural Control:** Prune and destroy severely infected branches or plants.
*   **Chemical Control (Acaricides/Miticide):** Apply when mite populations are detected or as a preventive measure during susceptible stages.
    *   **Spiromesifen** 22.9% SC: 0.5 ml/L of water (125 ml/acre)
    *   **Fenpyroximate** 5% SC: 1.0-1.5 ml/L of water (200-300 ml/acre)
    *   **Propargite** 57% EC: 4-6 ml/L of water (1-1.5 L/acre)
    *   **Sulphur** 80% WP: 5-7 g/L of water (1.5-2 kg/acre)

**B. For Whiteflies (Primary vector for Fig Leaf Curl Virus):**
*   **Cultural Control:** Use yellow sticky traps to monitor and trap adult whiteflies. Remove weeds around the fig plants, as they can harbor whiteflies.
*   **Chemical Control (Insecticides):** Apply when whitefly populations are high.
    *   **Buprofezin** 25% SC: 2.5 ml/L of water (1.25 L/acre)
    *   **Spiromesifen** 22.9% SC: 0.5 ml/L of water (125 ml/acre)
    *   **Flonicamid** 50% WG: 0.3 g/L of water (60 g/acre)
    *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: 0.2-0.4 g/L of water (40-80 g/acre)
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: 0.5 ml/L of water (125 ml/acre)

**C. For General Sucking Pests (Aphids, Mealybugs - potential vectors for other viruses):**
*   **Chemical Control (Insecticides):**
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: 0.5 ml/L of water (125 ml/acre)
    *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: 0.2-0.4 g/L of water (40-80 g/acre)
    *   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP: 0.2-0.4 g/L of water (50-100 g/acre)

**III. Cultural and Horticultural Practices:**
*   **Sanitation:** Regularly inspect plants. As soon as any plant or part of a plant shows clear viral symptoms (e.g., severe mosaic, curling, distortion), remove and destroy it immediately by burning or deep burial to prevent further spread.
*   **Weed Management:** Keep the area around fig plants free of weeds, as many weeds can act as alternate hosts for vectors and even some viruses.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure balanced fertilization to maintain plant vigor. Healthy plants are generally more resilient to stress and may show milder symptoms.
*   **Water Management:** Provide adequate and consistent irrigation to avoid water stress, which can weaken plants.
*   **Pruning:** When pruning, always disinfect pruning tools (e.g., with a 10% bleach solution or 70% alcohol) between cuts, especially when moving from one plant to another, to prevent mechanical transmission of viruses.
*   **Avoid Mechanical Injury:** Minimize any injury to plants, as some viruses can be transmitted through sap.

**IV. Monitoring:**
*   Regularly monitor your fig orchard for the appearance of viral symptoms and the presence of vectors. Early detection allows for timely intervention.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully, including dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Rotate different classes of chemicals to prevent the development of pesticide resistance in pests.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension specialists for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and the prevailing pest/disease situation in your area.

By implementing these integrated management strategies, you can significantly reduce the incidence and impact of viral diseases in your fig orchard.
