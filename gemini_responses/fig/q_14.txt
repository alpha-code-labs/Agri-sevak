As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling soil pests in Fig (Ficus carica) in Haryana. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods, is recommended for sustainable control.

### Control of Termites (e.g., *Odontotermes obesus*, *Microtermes obesi*) in Fig

Termites are a significant soil pest that can damage the roots and the base of the stem of Fig plants, especially young trees or those under stress, leading to wilting, poor growth, and even plant death.

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   **Sanitation:** Remove all dead wood, stumps, and debris from the vicinity of the Fig plants, as these can serve as breeding grounds for termites.
*   **Avoid Wood Contact:** Ensure that no wooden structures or stakes are in direct contact with the soil near the Fig plants.
*   **Moisture Management:** Avoid excessive moisture accumulation around the base of the plants, as damp conditions can attract termites. Ensure proper drainage.

**2. Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved):**
When termite activity is observed (e.g., mud channels on the stem, hollowed-out wood, wilting plants without apparent above-ground cause), chemical intervention may be necessary.
*   **Soil Drenching:** Drench the soil around the base of the affected Fig plants with a solution of **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC**.
    *   **Dosage:** Mix 20 ml of **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** per 10 litres of water. For larger areas or multiple trees, use 2.5 litres of **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** per 500 litres of water per acre.
    *   **Application:** Apply the solution thoroughly around the root zone and the base of the stem, ensuring it penetrates the soil. This is best done during planting or when termite activity is first noticed.

### Control of Nematodes (Root-knot Nematodes - *Meloidogyne* spp.) in Fig

Root-knot nematodes are microscopic roundworms that infect the roots of Fig plants, causing characteristic galls or swellings. This damage impairs the plant's ability to absorb water and nutrients, leading to stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, reduced fruit yield, and increased susceptibility to other diseases.

**1. Cultural Control:**
*   **Organic Matter Incorporation:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost into the soil. Organic matter improves soil health and promotes beneficial microorganisms that can suppress nematode populations.
*   **Neem Cake Application:** Apply **Neem cake** (a byproduct of neem oil extraction) around the root zone of Fig plants.
    *   **Dosage:** Apply 200-400 kg of **Neem cake** per acre, mixed into the soil. For individual trees, apply 0.5-1 kg per tree, depending on its size.
    *   **Mechanism:** Neem cake releases compounds that are toxic or repellent to nematodes and also enhances the activity of nematode-antagonistic fungi and bacteria.
*   **Solarization (for nursery beds/new plantings):** In areas intended for new Fig plantings, especially nursery beds, soil solarization during hot summer months can significantly reduce nematode populations. Cover moist soil with clear polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks.

**2. Biological Control:**
*   **Bio-nematicides:** Utilize beneficial fungi that parasitize nematodes.
    *   **Product:** Apply formulations containing *Purpureocillium lilacinum* (formerly *Paecilomyces lilacinus*).
    *   **Dosage:** Mix 2.5-5 kg of *Purpureocillium lilacinum* formulation with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed FYM or compost.
    *   **Application:** Broadcast the mixture around the root zone of the Fig plants and lightly incorporate it into the soil, followed by irrigation. This should be done when soil moisture is adequate.

**3. Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved):**
In cases of severe nematode infestation, chemical nematicides may be considered as part of an integrated approach.
*   **Granular Application:**
    *   **Option 1:** Apply **Fluensulfone 2% GR** around the root zone of the Fig plants.
        *   **Dosage:** Apply 10-15 kg of **Fluensulfone 2% GR** per acre. For individual trees, apply 20-40 grams per tree, depending on its size.
        *   **Application:** Broadcast the granules evenly around the base of the plant and lightly incorporate them into the soil, followed by thorough irrigation.
    *   **Option 2 (Alternative):** Apply **Carbofuran 3% G** around the root zone.
        *   **Dosage:** Apply 20-40 grams of **Carbofuran 3% G** per tree, depending on its size. For larger areas, use 33.3 kg per acre.
        *   **Application:** Broadcast the granules evenly around the base of the plant and lightly incorporate them into the soil, followed by thorough irrigation.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully, including safety precautions, dosage, and pre-harvest intervals.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension specialists for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and the latest approved products.
