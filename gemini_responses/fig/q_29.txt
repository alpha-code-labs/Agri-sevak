Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice regarding dropping in Fig.

First, let's clarify a point in your question:

*   **Tinda/Boll dropping:** This is not known to affect Fig. Fig plants do not produce "Tinda" (Indian round gourd) or "Bolls" (structures found in cotton). Therefore, this condition is not applicable to Fig.

Now, regarding **Flower drop and Fruit drop in Fig**, this is a common concern and can be attributed to several factors, primarily physiological, environmental, and nutritional stresses. Here's how you can control it:

**I. Understanding the Causes of Flower and Fruit Drop in Fig:**

Before applying any control measures, it's important to identify the potential causes:

1.  **Environmental Stress:**
    *   **Water Stress:** Both excessive watering (leading to waterlogging) and insufficient watering (drought stress) can cause dropping.
    *   **Temperature Extremes:** Sudden fluctuations in temperature, very high temperatures during flowering/fruiting, or unexpected cold snaps.
    *   **Humidity:** Very low humidity can sometimes lead to flower desiccation.
    *   **Wind:** Strong winds can physically dislodge flowers and young fruits.
2.  **Nutritional Deficiencies:**
    *   Lack of essential micronutrients like Boron and Zinc, or macronutrients like Potassium, can severely impact fruit set and retention.
    *   Imbalanced fertilization (e.g., excessive nitrogen leading to vegetative growth at the expense of reproductive growth).
3.  **Physiological Factors:**
    *   **Excessive Fruit Load:** The plant may naturally shed some flowers/fruits if it cannot support the entire load.
    *   **Poor Pollination:** While many fig varieties are parthenocarpic (fruit without pollination) or rely on fig wasps, some might experience drop due to inadequate pollination.
    *   **Hormonal Imbalance:** Imbalance of plant hormones (auxins, gibberellins, ethylene) can trigger abscission (shedding).
4.  **Pests and Diseases:**
    *   While less common as a direct cause of *dropping* (they usually damage the fruit itself), severe infestations of sap-sucking pests (e.g., mites, thrips, mealybugs) or systemic diseases can weaken the plant, indirectly leading to drop.

**II. Control Measures for Flower and Fruit Drop in Fig:**

Based on the potential causes, here are the recommended control measures:

1.  **Optimise Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Water Management:** Maintain consistent soil moisture. Irrigate regularly, especially during flowering and fruit development, but avoid waterlogging. Use drip irrigation for efficient water use.
    *   **Mulching:** Apply organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves) around the base of the tree to conserve soil moisture, regulate soil temperature, and suppress weeds.
    *   **Weed Control:** Keep the area around the fig tree free of weeds to reduce competition for water and nutrients.
    *   **Pruning:** Practice judicious pruning to maintain a balanced canopy, improve air circulation, and manage the fruit load. Remove dead, diseased, or overcrowded branches.
    *   **Site Selection:** Ensure the fig tree is planted in a location with adequate sunlight and protection from strong winds.

2.  **Balanced Nutrition:**
    *   **Soil Testing:** Conduct regular soil tests to determine nutrient deficiencies and apply fertilizers accordingly. This is the most accurate way to address nutritional needs.
    *   **Micronutrient Application:** If deficiencies are identified, especially Boron and Zinc, apply them as foliar sprays or soil amendments.
        *   **For Boron deficiency:** Spray with **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** at 1-2 g/L of water (0.1-0.2%) during pre-flowering and fruit set stages.
        *   **For Zinc deficiency:** Spray with **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** at 2-5 g/L of water (0.2-0.5%) during active growth periods.
    *   **NPK Fertilization:** Apply a balanced NPK fertilizer based on soil test recommendations. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can promote vegetative growth at the expense of fruiting.

3.  **Hormonal Management (Plant Growth Regulators - PGRs):**
    *   Plant growth regulators can be effective in preventing premature fruit drop, but their application requires precise timing and dosage. Always consult with HAU extension specialists for specific recommendations for your fig variety and local conditions.
    *   **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA):** This auxin can be used to prevent premature fruit drop.
        *   **Application:** Spray **Naphthalene Acetic Acid** at a concentration of 10-20 mg/L (0.01-0.02 g/L) of water, typically applied at the pea-size stage of fruits. Repeat if necessary, but avoid over-application.
    *   **Gibberellic Acid (GA3):** In some cases, GA3 can improve fruit set and size.
        *   **Application:** Spray **Gibberellic Acid** at a concentration of 25-50 mg/L (0.025-0.05 g/L) of water, usually applied during flowering or early fruit development.

4.  **Pest and Disease Management:**
    *   If specific pests (e.g., mites, thrips, mealybugs) or diseases are identified as severely weakening the plant and contributing to drop, implement targeted control measures using CIBRC-approved pesticides. However, dropping is more often physiological than pest/disease-induced.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Variety Specifics:** Different fig varieties may respond differently to environmental conditions and treatments.
*   **Timing and Dosage:** The effectiveness of nutritional sprays and PGRs heavily depends on correct timing and precise dosage. Incorrect application can be ineffective or even detrimental.
*   **Integrated Approach:** The most effective control involves an integrated approach combining good cultural practices, balanced nutrition, and judicious use of PGRs when necessary.
