As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified information on specialized practices for Fig cultivation in Haryana:

### Specialized Practices in Fig (Ficus carica)

#### 1. Pruning

Pruning is essential for shaping the tree, promoting fruit production, and maintaining tree health.

*   **Training Pruning (Young Trees):**
    *   **Objective:** Establish a strong framework and desired tree shape (e.g., open vase or modified central leader).
    *   **Method:** In the first 1-2 years, select 3-5 well-spaced scaffold branches to form the main structure. Remove any competing leaders or branches growing inwards.
    *   **Timing:** During the dormant season (late winter, typically January-February in Haryana) before new growth begins.
*   **Maintenance Pruning (Mature Trees):**
    *   **Objective:** Remove dead, diseased, or damaged branches, improve light penetration and air circulation, and encourage new fruiting wood.
    *   **Method:** Annually remove suckers, water sprouts, and branches that cross or rub against each other. Thin out crowded branches. Figs fruit on new wood or one-year-old wood depending on the variety, so pruning encourages new growth for subsequent crops.
    *   **Timing:** Best done during the dormant season (January-February). Light pruning can be done after the main harvest to remove spent fruiting wood.
*   **Rejuvenation Pruning:** For old, unproductive trees, heavy pruning can be done to stimulate vigorous new growth.

#### 2. Desuckering

Desuckering involves removing unwanted shoots that arise from the base of the plant or from the rootstock.

*   **Objective:** Prevent competition for water and nutrients, maintain the desired tree structure, and ensure the vigor of the main plant. Suckers are generally unproductive.
*   **Method:** Cut suckers flush with the ground or the main stem as soon as they appear. Ensure clean cuts to minimize disease entry.
*   **Timing:** Throughout the growing season, as needed.

#### 3. Mulching

Mulching is a beneficial practice for fig trees, especially in the climatic conditions of Haryana.

*   **Objective:**
    *   **Moisture Conservation:** Reduces evaporation from the soil surface, conserving precious water.
    *   **Weed Suppression:** Forms a physical barrier, inhibiting weed growth and reducing competition for nutrients.
    *   **Temperature Regulation:** Keeps soil cooler in summer and warmer in winter, protecting roots from extreme temperatures.
    *   **Soil Improvement:** Organic mulches decompose over time, adding organic matter and improving soil structure and fertility.
    *   **Erosion Control:** Protects the soil surface from wind and water erosion.
*   **Materials:** Organic mulches such as paddy straw, wheat straw, sugarcane trash, dried leaves, wood chips, or well-decomposed farmyard manure/compost.
*   **Application:** Apply a uniform layer of 5-10 cm thickness around the base of the tree, extending to the drip line. Keep the mulch a few centimeters away from the trunk to prevent moisture accumulation and potential collar rot.
*   **Timing:** Best applied before the onset of summer (March-April) to conserve moisture, or after the monsoon season. Replenish as needed.

#### 4. Grafting

While figs are commonly propagated by cuttings, grafting can be used for specific purposes.

*   **Objective:**
    *   **Variety Change (Top-working):** To convert an existing tree of an undesirable variety to a more productive or preferred one.
    *   **Repair:** To repair damaged trunks or branches.
    *   **Rootstock Benefits:** To utilize rootstocks that offer specific advantages like disease resistance or adaptability to certain soil conditions, though this is less common for figs as they are often grown on their own roots.
*   **Methods:** Cleft grafting, whip and tongue grafting, or chip budding can be attempted. The presence of milky latex can sometimes interfere with graft union healing.
*   **Timing:** Best performed during the dormant season (January-February) when the plant is not actively growing, or during periods of active growth for budding.
*   **Rootstock:** Often own-rooted fig seedlings or specific Ficus species can be used.
*   **Note:** For commercial propagation in Haryana, rooting of hardwood cuttings is the most prevalent and successful method due to its ease and high success rate.

#### 5. Pollination

The pollination mechanism in figs is unique and depends on the type of fig variety.

*   **Fig Types and Pollination:**
    *   **Common Figs (Parthenocarpic):** Most commercially grown fig varieties in India, including those popular in Haryana (e.g., 'Poona', 'Deanna', 'Black Ischia', 'Brown Turkey'), are of the Common Type. These varieties are **parthenocarpic**, meaning they set fruit without the need for pollination by fig wasps. The fruit develops from unfertilized flowers.
    *   **Smyrna Figs:** These varieties require pollination by the fig wasp (*Blastophaga psenes*) which transfers pollen from a male caprifig (wild fig) to the female flowers inside the Smyrna fig.
    *   **Caprifigs:** These are wild figs that produce male flowers and host the fig wasp. They are inedible.
*   **Relevance for Haryana:** For the common fig varieties cultivated in Haryana, **no specialized pollination practices (like introducing caprifigs or fig wasps) are required** as they are parthenocarpic and produce fruit without pollination. Therefore, this is generally not a concern for commercial fig growers in the region.
*   **This is not known to affect Fig** in terms of requiring external intervention for pollination for the commonly grown commercial varieties in Haryana.
