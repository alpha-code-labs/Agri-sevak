As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following fertilizer schedule for Fig (Ficus carica) cultivation in Haryana. Please note that these are general recommendations. For precise nutrient management tailored to your specific field conditions and soil type, a comprehensive soil test is highly recommended.

**General Recommendations for Fig Fertilization:**

**1. For Non-Bearing Trees (1-3 years):**
The aim during this phase is to promote vigorous vegetative growth and establish a strong root system. Apply fertilizers in two equal splits: the first in February-March (before new growth) and the second in June-July.

*   **Year 1 (per tree):**
    *   **Urea:** 100 g
    *   **DAP:** 50 g
    *   **Muriate of Potash (Potash):** 50 g
    *   **Sulphur (90% elemental sulphur):** 10 g
*   **Year 2 (per tree):**
    *   **Urea:** 200 g
    *   **DAP:** 100 g
    *   **Muriate of Potash (Potash):** 100 g
    *   **Sulphur (90% elemental sulphur):** 20 g
*   **Year 3 (per tree):**
    *   **Urea:** 300 g
    *   **DAP:** 150 g
    *   **Muriate of Potash (Potash):** 150 g
    *   **Sulphur (90% elemental sulphur):** 30 g

**2. For Bearing Trees (4 years and older):**
The aim is to support optimal fruit production and maintain tree health. Phosphorus, Potassium, and Sulphur should be applied as a basal dose in February-March. Nitrogen should be applied in two equal splits: half in February-March and the remaining half in June-July.

You can choose between the following options based on your preference for Phosphorus and Sulphur sources:

*   **Option A: Using DAP for Phosphorus**
    *   **Urea:** 525 g per tree per year
    *   **DAP:** 325 g per tree per year
    *   **Muriate of Potash (Potash):** 250 g per tree per year
    *   **Sulphur (90% elemental sulphur):** 30-40 g per tree per year (if not adequately supplied by other sources or if soil test indicates deficiency)

*   **Option B: Using SSP for Phosphorus and Sulphur**
    *   **Urea:** 650 g per tree per year
    *   **Single Super Phosphate (SSP):** 940 g per tree per year (This provides approximately 150 g P2O5 and 103 g Sulphur)
    *   **Muriate of Potash (Potash):** 250 g per tree per year

**3. Nano-Fertilizers:**
Nano-fertilizers can be used as a supplement to conventional fertilizers, potentially reducing the requirement of conventional fertilizers by 25-50%.

*   **Nano-Urea:** Foliar spray at a concentration of 2-4 ml/L of water. Apply two sprays: one during active vegetative growth (e.g., pre-flowering) and another during fruit development.
*   **Nano-DAP:** Foliar spray at a concentration of 2-4 ml/L of water. Apply two sprays: one during active vegetative growth (e.g., pre-flowering) and another during fruit development.

**4. NPK Fertilizers:**
If using complex NPK fertilizers (e.g., 19:19:19, 12:32:16), the dose will depend on the specific grade and the NPK requirement. It is generally recommended to use straight fertilizers for precise nutrient management in fruit trees. If used, adjust the doses of **Urea**, **DAP**, **SSP**, and **Potash** accordingly to meet the total N, P2O5, and K2O requirements.

**5. Sulphur:**
Sulphur is crucial for protein synthesis and oil formation, and it also helps in improving nutrient availability in alkaline soils common in Haryana. If not adequately supplied by **SSP**, apply **Sulphur** (90% elemental sulphur or bentonite sulphur) at the recommended doses mentioned above.

**Timing and Method of Application:**
*   **Granular Fertilizers:** Apply fertilizers in a ring around the tree canopy, 30-60 cm away from the trunk, and incorporate them into the soil by light digging. Ensure adequate moisture after application.
*   **Foliar Sprays (Nano-fertilizers):** Spray evenly on the foliage, preferably in the morning or late afternoon, avoiding hot midday sun.

**Additional Recommendations:**
*   **Farmyard Manure (FYM):** Incorporate 20-30 kg of well-decomposed FYM or compost per tree annually, preferably during October-November, to improve soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability.
*   **Micronutrients:** Based on soil test results, apply micronutrients like Zinc, Boron, Manganese, and Iron if deficiencies are observed. Foliar sprays of micronutrient mixtures are often effective.
