As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend a scientifically verified approach to address macro-nutrient deficiencies (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium) in Fig (Ficus carica) for growers in Haryana.

**1. Diagnosis:**
Accurate diagnosis is the foundation of effective nutrient management.
*   **Visual Symptoms:** Observe the fig plants for characteristic deficiency symptoms as described below.
*   **Soil Testing:** This is the most reliable method. Collect representative soil samples from the root zone and get them analyzed by a reputable laboratory (e.g., HAU's soil testing lab). This provides precise recommendations for fertilizer application based on existing soil nutrient levels.
*   **Leaf Tissue Analysis:** For a more advanced diagnosis, leaf tissue analysis can confirm the actual nutrient status within the plant.

**2. Corrective Measures for Specific Deficiencies:**

**A. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency:**
*   **Symptoms:** General yellowing (chlorosis) of older leaves, starting from the tips and margins, stunted growth, reduced leaf size, poor branching, and premature fruit drop.
*   **Correction:**
    *   Apply nitrogenous fertilizers in split doses throughout the growing season, particularly during periods of active vegetative growth and fruit development.
    *   **Recommended Fertilizers (Soil Application):**
        *   **Urea** (46% N): Apply 100-200 g per mature tree per year, split into 2-3 applications. For young trees (1-3 years), reduce the dose proportionally (e.g., 25-75 g per tree per year).
        *   **Ammonium Sulphate** (20.5% N): Apply 200-400 g per mature tree per year, split into 2-3 applications.
        *   **Calcium Ammonium Nitrate** (25% N): Apply 160-320 g per mature tree per year, split into 2-3 applications.
    *   **Application Method:** Apply fertilizer evenly around the drip line of the tree and lightly incorporate it into the soil, followed by thorough irrigation.

**B. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency:**
*   **Symptoms:** Dark green or purplish discoloration of older leaves, stunted growth, poor root development, delayed maturity, and reduced fruit size and quality. Symptoms are often less distinct than N or K.
*   **Correction:**
    *   Phosphorus is less mobile in the soil, so it is best applied as a basal dose or early in the growing season to allow time for uptake.
    *   **Recommended Fertilizers (Soil Application):**
        *   **Single Super Phosphate** (16% P2O5): Apply 300-600 g per mature tree per year. For young trees, reduce the dose proportionally (e.g., 75-200 g per tree per year).
        *   **Di-Ammonium Phosphate** (18% N, 46% P2O5): Apply 100-200 g per mature tree per year. This also provides a significant amount of nitrogen.
    *   **Application Method:** Apply fertilizer in a ring around the tree or in furrows within the drip line and incorporate it into the soil, followed by irrigation.

**C. Potassium (K) Deficiency:**
*   **Symptoms:** Scorching or browning (necrosis) of leaf margins, especially on older leaves, starting from the tips and progressing inwards. Leaves may appear crinkled, and fruit development can be poor, leading to small, poorly flavored fruits with reduced shelf life.
*   **Correction:**
    *   Apply potassium fertilizers in split doses, similar to nitrogen, to ensure continuous availability throughout the growing season.
    *   **Recommended Fertilizers (Soil Application):**
        *   **Potassium Chloride** (Muriate of Potash, 60% K2O): Apply 100-200 g per mature tree per year, split into 2 applications. For young trees, reduce the dose proportionally (e.g., 25-75 g per tree per year).
        *   **Potassium Sulphate** (Sulphate of Potash, 50% K2O): Apply 120-240 g per mature tree per year, split into 2 applications. This is preferred in areas where chloride sensitivity is a concern, though less common for fig.
    *   **Application Method:** Apply fertilizer evenly around the drip line of the tree and lightly incorporate it into the soil, followed by irrigation.

**3. General Recommendations for Balanced Nutrition:**

*   **Soil Testing is Paramount:** Always base your fertilizer application rates on regular soil test reports. This prevents both under- and over-application, which can lead to nutrient imbalances and environmental issues.
*   **Organic Matter:** Incorporate well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost (10-20 kg per tree annually) to improve soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability, enhancing the efficiency of chemical fertilizers.
*   **Irrigation:** Ensure adequate and timely irrigation immediately after fertilizer application to help dissolve nutrients and make them readily available for root uptake.
*   **Timing:** The most effective time for fertilizer application is generally during active growth phases, such as after pruning, during flowering, and fruit development.
*   **Foliar Application (Supplemental):** For quick but temporary correction of mild deficiencies, especially N and K, foliar sprays can be used as a supplement to soil application.
    *   For N: **Urea** (0.5-1.0% solution, i.e., 5-10 g/L water).
    *   For K: **Potassium Nitrate** (13% N, 45% K2O) or **Potassium Sulphate** (0.5-1.0% solution, i.e., 5-10 g/L water).
    *   *Note: Foliar sprays should be applied early morning or late evening to avoid leaf scorching and ensure better absorption.*

By adhering to these scientifically sound practices, fig growers in Haryana can effectively manage macro-nutrient deficiencies, ensuring robust plant growth, optimal fruit production, and sustained orchard health.
