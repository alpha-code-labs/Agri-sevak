As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling these pests in Fig:

**Ber Fly (*Carpomyia vesuviana*) in Fig:**
This is not known to affect Fig. The Ber fly is a specific pest of Ber (*Ziziphus mauritiana*) and does not infest Fig (*Ficus carica*).

**Fruit Fly (e.g., *Bactrocera dorsalis*, *Bactrocera zonata*) in Fig:**
Fruit flies are a significant pest of fig, causing damage by laying eggs in developing fruits, leading to maggot infestation and fruit spoilage. Effective management requires an integrated approach.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Regularly collect and destroy all fallen and infested fruits by burying them deep in the soil or burning them. This is crucial to break the life cycle of the pest.
    *   Maintain orchard hygiene by removing any overripe or damaged fruits from the trees.
    *   Ploughing the soil around the trees during winter can expose pupae to predators and adverse weather conditions, reducing the pest population.

*   **Mechanical Control:**
    *   **Fruit Bagging:** Bag individual fruits or clusters of fruits with paper or cloth bags once they reach a certain size (e.g., pea size) to physically prevent adult fruit flies from laying eggs.
    *   **Pheromone Traps:** Install methyl eugenol traps (for male fruit flies) at a density of 10-12 traps per acre, starting from fruit set. Replace the lure every 2-3 weeks to maintain effectiveness.
    *   **Protein Bait Traps:** Use traps containing protein hydrolysate or yeast extract mixed with a small amount of insecticide. These attract both male and female fruit flies.

*   **Chemical Control (as bait sprays):**
    *   When fruit fly incidence is high, bait sprays can be highly effective. These target adult flies and reduce overall pesticide use compared to full cover sprays.
    *   Prepare a bait solution by mixing 100 g of jaggery (gur) or a commercial protein hydrolysate with 10 L of water. To this mixture, add one of the following CIBRC approved insecticides:
        *   **Malathion 50 EC** at 20 ml per 10 L of water.
        *   **Deltamethrin 2.8 EC** at 10 ml per 10 L of water.
        *   **Spinosad 45 SC** at 3 ml per 10 L of water.
    *   Spray this bait solution on 5-10 spots on the tree canopy (e.g., on leaves or non-bearing branches) per tree, rather than a full cover spray. This localized application attracts and kills adult fruit flies.
    *   Repeat the application every 7-10 days, especially during the peak fruiting season and when fruit fly activity is observed.
    *   Always observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) for any chosen chemical to ensure fruit safety.
