Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling mites in Fig (Ficus carica) in Haryana. Mites, including Red spider mite and Rust mite, can cause significant damage if not managed properly.

Here's a comprehensive approach:

**General Management Practices (Integrated Pest Management - IPM):**

1.  **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your fig plants, especially the undersides of leaves, for early signs of mite infestation (stippling, webbing, bronzing).
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy severely infested leaves, branches, or fruits to reduce mite populations.
    *   **Weed Control:** Keep the area around fig trees free of weeds, as they can act as alternate hosts for mites.
    *   **Proper Irrigation:** Mites thrive in dry, dusty conditions. Ensure adequate soil moisture, especially during dry periods, and consider occasional overhead sprinkling (if feasible and not promoting fungal diseases) to dislodge mites and increase humidity.
3.  **Biological Control:** Encourage natural predators like predatory mites (e.g., *Amblyseius* species), lacewings, and ladybugs, which feed on pest mites. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

**Specific Control for Red Spider Mite (Tetranychus urticae):**

Red spider mites typically cause yellow stippling on leaves, followed by bronzing, leaf drop, and fine webbing on the undersides of leaves and between branches in severe infestations.

**Chemical Control (Acaricides):**
When infestation levels are high and general practices are insufficient, chemical control may be necessary. Always ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves. Rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

*   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** Apply at a rate of 0.5-0.7 ml per litre of water.
*   **Fenpyroximate 5% EC:** Apply at a rate of 0.5-1.0 ml per litre of water.
*   **Propargite 57% EC:** Apply at a rate of 1.0-1.5 ml per litre of water.
*   **Abamectin 1.8% EC:** Apply at a rate of 0.3-0.5 ml per litre of water.
*   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP:** Apply at a rate of 2.0-3.0 g per litre of water. (Effective against mites, but avoid spraying when temperatures are very high, i.e., above 30-32°C, as it can cause phytotoxicity).

**Specific Control for Rust Mite (Eriophyes ficus / Aceria ficus):**

Rust mites are microscopic and cause russeting, bronzing, and distortion of leaves and fruits. They are also known vectors for Fig Mosaic Virus.

**Chemical Control (Acaricides):**
Due to their microscopic size and tendency to hide in crevices, thorough spray coverage is crucial.

*   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP:** This is highly effective against eriophyid mites. Apply at a rate of 2.0-3.0 g per litre of water. (As mentioned, avoid high temperatures).
*   **Abamectin 1.8% EC:** Apply at a rate of 0.3-0.5 ml per litre of water. Its translaminar action can help reach mites in protected areas.
*   **Fenpyroximate 5% EC:** Apply at a rate of 0.5-1.0 ml per litre of water. It also shows some efficacy against rust mites.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Spray Technique:** Use a high-volume sprayer to ensure complete coverage of the foliage, especially the undersides of leaves and new growth where mites are often concentrated.
*   **Repeat Applications:** Mite control often requires repeat applications, typically at 7-10 day intervals, depending on the severity of infestation and the life cycle of the mite, until the population is under control.
*   **Resistance Management:** Always rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent mites from developing resistance to a particular chemical.
*   **Safety:** Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label, including recommended dosage, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and safety precautions (wearing protective gear).
