As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Fig (Ficus carica) in Haryana:

**1. Borers (e.g., Stem Borers, Bark Eating Caterpillars):**
Borers can cause significant damage by tunneling into the stem and branches, leading to weakening and eventual death of the affected parts.

*   **Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
    *   Regularly inspect fig trees for signs of borer attack such as frass (sawdust-like excreta), gum exudation, and boreholes.
    *   Remove and destroy severely affected or dead branches.
    *   For active boreholes, probe with a stiff wire to physically kill the larva inside.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Injection:** For active boreholes, inject an insecticide solution using a syringe. After injection, seal the hole with mud or putty to prevent re-entry and ensure efficacy.
        *   **Dichlorvos** 76% EC: 5-10 ml per borehole.
        *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: 5-10 ml per borehole.
    *   **Swabbing:** For bark-eating caterpillars, clean the affected bark by removing webs and frass, then swab the trunk and main branches with an insecticide solution.
        *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: 2.5 ml/L of water.

**2. Caterpillars (General Defoliators/Leaf Feeders):**
Various caterpillar species can feed on fig leaves, causing defoliation and reducing photosynthetic capacity.

*   **Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
    *   During early stages of infestation, especially on young trees, hand-pick and destroy visible caterpillars.
    *   Maintain orchard hygiene to reduce potential breeding sites and alternate hosts.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Spray when caterpillars are young and actively feeding for best results. Ensure thorough coverage of foliage.
        *   **Emamectin Benzoate** 5% SG: 0.2 g/L of water.
        *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC: 0.15 ml/L of water.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: 1 ml/L of water.
        *   **Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)** (biological insecticide): 2 g/L of water.

**3. Diamondback Moth (DBM):**
*   This is not known to affect Fig. Diamondback moth (*Plutella xylostella*) is a specific pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower, mustard).

**4. Leaf Folder:**
Leaf folders roll or fold leaves and feed from within the protective fold, causing damage to the foliage and hindering photosynthesis.

*   **Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
    *   Regularly inspect trees and remove and destroy folded leaves containing larvae to reduce pest population.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Spray when the infestation is noticed, ensuring good coverage, particularly on the underside of leaves and within the folded leaves where larvae reside.
        *   **Emamectin Benzoate** 5% SG: 0.2 g/L of water.
        *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC: 0.15 ml/L of water.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: 1 ml/L of water.

**Important Note:** Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the pesticide label, including dosage, application method, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and safety precautions. Consult with your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your farm conditions and for the latest updates on pest management practices.
