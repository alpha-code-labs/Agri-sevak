As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide scientifically verified advice for managing growth issues in Fig (Anjeer) plants in Haryana. Accurate diagnosis is the first step, often requiring a soil test and visual inspection.

Here's how to manage common growth issues:

### 1. Slow Growth

Slow growth can be indicative of various underlying issues, primarily nutrient deficiencies, water stress, or poor soil conditions.

*   **Potential Causes:** Nutrient deficiency (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, or micronutrients), inadequate water, poor soil structure (compaction, low organic matter), root damage (e.g., nematodes), insufficient sunlight, or extreme temperatures.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Soil Testing:** The most crucial first step. Contact the HAU Soil Testing Lab to get a comprehensive analysis of your soil's nutrient status and pH. This will pinpoint specific deficiencies.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Based on soil test results, apply balanced fertilizers.
        *   For general slow growth, a balanced NPK fertilizer is often beneficial.
        *   **Urea** (46% N): For nitrogen deficiency, apply 100-200 g per mature tree, split into 2-3 applications during the growing season.
        *   **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5): For phosphorus deficiency, apply 100-150 g per mature tree.
        *   **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** (60% K2O): For potassium deficiency, apply 100-150 g per mature tree.
        *   For micronutrient deficiencies (if identified by soil test):
            *   **Zinc Sulphate** (21% Zn): 50-100 g per tree as soil application, or 5 g/L as foliar spray.
            *   **Ferrous Sulphate** (19% Fe): 50-100 g per tree as soil application, or 5 g/L as foliar spray.
            *   **Borax** (10.5% B): 10-20 g per tree as soil application, or 1-2 g/L as foliar spray.
    *   **Irrigation:** Ensure consistent and adequate watering, especially during dry periods. Fig trees require regular moisture but are sensitive to waterlogging.
    *   **Soil Improvement:** Incorporate 5-10 kg of well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost per tree annually to improve soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability.
    *   **Weed Control:** Keep the area around the tree free of weeds to reduce competition for water and nutrients.

### 2. Yellow Growth (Chlorosis)

Yellowing of leaves (chlorosis) indicates a lack of chlorophyll, often due to nutrient deficiencies, particularly micronutrients in high pH soils common in Haryana.

*   **Potential Causes:** Most commonly Iron (Fe) or Zinc (Zn) deficiency, especially in alkaline soils. Also, Nitrogen (N) or Magnesium (Mg) deficiency, or waterlogging.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Soil Testing:** Essential to confirm the specific nutrient deficiency.
    *   **Iron Deficiency (Interveinal chlorosis on young leaves):**
        *   Foliar spray: **Ferrous Sulphate** (19% Fe) at 5 g/L water, or **Fe-EDTA** (12% Fe) at 1-2 g/L water. Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals until recovery.
        *   Soil application (less effective in high pH soils): **Ferrous Sulphate** at 50-100 g per tree, mixed with FYM.
    *   **Zinc Deficiency (Small, narrow, yellow leaves, often with rosetting):**
        *   Foliar spray: **Zinc Sulphate** (21% Zn) at 5 g/L water. Apply 1-2 sprays.
        *   Soil application: **Zinc Sulphate** at 50-100 g per tree, mixed with FYM.
    *   **Nitrogen Deficiency (General yellowing of older leaves):**
        *   Apply **Urea** (46% N) at 100-200 g per tree, or foliar spray at 10 g/L water.
    *   **Magnesium Deficiency (Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, often purplish or reddish tints):**
        *   Foliar spray: **Magnesium Sulphate** (9.6% Mg) at 5 g/L water.
    *   **Drainage:** If waterlogging is suspected, improve soil drainage around the tree.

### 3. Excessive Height

Excessive height can make harvesting difficult and reduce light penetration into the canopy, affecting fruit quality and yield.

*   **Potential Causes:** High nitrogen fertilization, lack of regular pruning, close planting, or a naturally vigorous variety/rootstock.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Pruning:** This is the primary method for managing tree height and shape in fig.
        *   **Annual Dormant Pruning:** Conduct during late winter/early spring before new growth begins. Remove dead, diseased, or crossing branches. Head back main branches to an outward-facing bud to control height and encourage lateral branching. Aim to maintain a manageable height (e.g., 2.5-3 meters).
        *   **Summer Pruning:** Light pruning can be done in summer to remove vigorous upright shoots (water sprouts) and maintain canopy structure.
    *   **Fertilization Adjustment:** Reduce nitrogen application if it is contributing to excessive vegetative growth. Ensure a balanced NPK ratio.
    *   **Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs):** For severe cases, CIBRC-approved growth retardants can be used.
        *   **Paclobutrazol** (e.g., 23% SC formulation): This chemical inhibits gibberellin synthesis, reducing vegetative growth and promoting reproductive growth.
            *   **Dosage:** Apply as a soil drench around the tree base. A general guideline for fruit trees is 0.5-1.0 g active ingredient (a.i.) per meter of canopy diameter. For a 23% SC formulation, this translates to approximately 2-4 ml of product per meter of canopy diameter. For example, a tree with a 3-meter canopy diameter might receive 6-12 ml of 23% SC formulation.
            *   **Application:** Apply after fruit harvest or during dormancy when soil moisture is adequate.
            *   **Caution:** Start with the lower recommended dose and observe the tree's response. Overuse can lead to stunted growth and reduced fruit size. Consult HAU experts for precise dosage based on tree age, vigor, and specific conditions.

### 4. Excessive Flowering

While flowering is desirable, excessive flowering can lead to a large number of small, poor-quality fruits and stress the tree, ultimately reducing overall yield and tree health.

*   **Potential Causes:** Can be a response to stress (water, nutrient imbalance), specific varieties, or sometimes an unintended effect of certain growth retardants (like paclobutrazol, which can shift energy from vegetative to reproductive growth).
*   **Management:**
    *   **Flower/Fruit Thinning:** Manual thinning is the most effective and recommended method for fig.
        *   When fruits are pea-sized, remove excess flowers or young fruits to ensure adequate spacing (e.g., 1-2 fruits per node). This allows the remaining fruits to develop to optimal size and quality.
    *   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure the tree receives balanced nutrients. Avoid excessive phosphorus if not needed, as it can sometimes promote flowering.
    *   **Pruning:** Proper pruning helps manage the overall vigor and balance between vegetative and reproductive growth.
    *   **Water Management:** Consistent irrigation helps reduce stress-induced flowering.

**Important Note:** Always consult with HAU experts for specific diagnosis and recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions, especially before applying any chemical treatments. A soil test is highly recommended for accurate nutrient management.
