As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified recommendations for the use of growth regulators and micronutrients in Fig cultivation in Haryana:

### Recommended Doses of Growth Regulators/Hormones and Micronutrients in Fig

1.  **Ethephon (Ethrel):**
    *   **Purpose:** To promote uniform fruit ripening and color development.
    *   **Recommended Dose:** Apply **Ethephon** at a concentration of 250-500 ppm (0.25-0.5 g/L of active ingredient).
    *   **Application:** Spray uniformly on the fruits when they begin to show signs of maturity or initial color change. Ensure thorough coverage.

2.  **2,4-D (2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid):**
    *   **Recommendation:** While **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid** is a synthetic auxin, its use as a growth regulator for beneficial effects in Fig, such as improving fruit set or development, is not commonly recommended or scientifically verified in standard horticultural practices for Fig. Therefore, its application for these specific purposes is not advised.

3.  **Boron:**
    *   **Purpose:** Boron is an essential micronutrient crucial for pollen germination, fruit set, and overall fruit development. Its deficiency can lead to poor fruit set and quality.
    *   **Recommended Dose:** Apply a foliar spray of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** or **Boric acid** at a concentration of 1-2 g/L (0.1-0.2% solution).
    *   **Application:**
        *   First spray: At the pre-bloom stage (just before flowering).
        *   Second spray: At early fruit set stage.
        *   Repeat if soil analysis indicates severe deficiency or if deficiency symptoms persist. Ensure uniform coverage of foliage and developing fruits.
