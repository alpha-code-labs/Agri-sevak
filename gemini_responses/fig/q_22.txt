Fig (Ficus carica L.) is primarily propagated vegetatively for commercial cultivation to ensure true-to-type plants and early fruiting. Therefore, traditional "sowing method/pattern" and "seed dose" as understood for seed-propagated crops are not directly applicable.

Here are the recommended cultivation practices for Fig in Haryana:

*   **Propagation Method (instead of Sowing method/pattern):**
    *   **Hardwood Cuttings:** This is the most common and preferred method. Cuttings of 20-30 cm length and 1-2 cm thickness, taken from one-year-old healthy shoots, are used. These are typically planted in nursery beds or directly in the field during the dormant season (December-January).
    *   **Air Layering (Gooti):** This method is also effective, especially for establishing plants quickly.
    *   **Budding/Grafting:** While less common for commercial propagation, it can be used for specific varieties or rootstock combinations.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   **For Cuttings:** When planting cuttings in nursery beds or directly in the field, approximately two-thirds (2/3) of the cutting should be buried in the soil, ensuring at least 2-3 buds are below the soil surface.
    *   **For Rooted Plants/Grafts:** Plant the rooted saplings or grafted plants at the same depth as they were growing in the nursery bag or bed. Ensure the root collar is at ground level.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   The optimal spacing for fig varies depending on the variety, soil fertility, and the training system adopted.
    *   **Standard Spacing:** A common spacing for most commercial varieties is **5 meters x 5 meters** (m x m). This allows for good canopy development and ease of management.
    *   **High-Density Planting (HDP):** For certain dwarf or semi-dwarf varieties, or with specific training systems, closer spacing like **4 meters x 4 meters** (m x m) can be adopted to maximize initial yields. However, this requires more intensive pruning and management.
    *   **Low-Density Planting:** In very fertile soils or for vigorous varieties, spacing up to **6 meters x 6 meters** (m x m) might be considered.

*   **Planting Material Dose (instead of Seed dose):**
    *   Since figs are propagated vegetatively, there is no "seed dose." Instead, the requirement is for the number of rooted cuttings or saplings per unit area.
    *   For a spacing of 5 m x 5 m, approximately **400 plants per hectare** would be required.
    *   For a spacing of 4 m x 4 m, approximately **625 plants per hectare** would be required.
