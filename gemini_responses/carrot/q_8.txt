Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling sucking pests in carrots in Haryana.

First, regarding the pests you mentioned: Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips are indeed common sucking pests that can affect carrot crops in our region.

**Regarding Psylla:** This is not known to affect Carrot. Psyllids are generally host-specific and are not recognized as pests of carrots.

Here's an integrated approach for managing Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips in carrots:

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategy for Sucking Pests in Carrots:**

An IPM approach combines cultural, biological, and chemical methods to achieve sustainable pest control.

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy crop residues after harvest. Keep the field and surrounding areas free of weeds, as many weeds can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops to break the pest life cycle.
*   **Optimum Planting Time:** Plant carrots at the recommended time to avoid peak pest incidence periods.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, as it can lead to lush growth that is more attractive to sucking pests.
*   **Water Management:** Ensure proper irrigation to maintain plant vigor, as stressed plants are more susceptible to pest attacks.
*   **Use of Yellow Sticky Traps:** Install yellow sticky traps (10-15 traps per acre) to monitor pest populations (especially whiteflies and leafhoppers) and for mass trapping of adults.

**2. Biological Control:**
*   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Protect and encourage natural enemies such as ladybird beetles, lacewings, syrphid fly larvae, and parasitic wasps (e.g., *Aphelinus* species for whiteflies, *Aphidius* species for aphids). Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.
*   **Biopesticides:** In cases of low to moderate infestation, consider using neem-based formulations (e.g., Azadirachtin 1500 ppm or 3000 ppm) at 5 ml/L of water. These act as antifeedants and growth regulators.

**3. Chemical Control (Based on Economic Threshold Level - ETL):**
Chemical intervention should be considered when pest populations reach ETL and other methods are insufficient. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where many sucking pests reside.

**Recommended CIBRC Approved Insecticides for Sucking Pests in Carrots:**

*   **For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips:**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at 125-150 ml per acre.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at 50-100 g per acre.
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply at 50-100 g per acre.
    *   **Fipronil 5% SC:** Apply at 400-600 ml per acre (particularly effective against Thrips and Leafhoppers).
    *   **Flonicamid 50% WG:** Apply at 60 g per acre (highly effective against Aphids).

*   **Specifically for Whiteflies:**
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at 500-600 ml per acre (acts as an insect growth regulator, effective against nymphs).
    *   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** Apply at 125 ml per acre.

*   **For quick knockdown (use judiciously to preserve natural enemies):**
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** Apply at 200-250 ml per acre.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Water Volume:** Always mix the recommended dose of insecticide in 200-400 litres of water per acre for effective spray coverage.
*   **Rotation:** Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development. For example, if you use Imidacloprid in one spray, use Buprofezin or Fipronil for the next spray if needed.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always observe the specified Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) for each insecticide to ensure the safety of the harvested carrots for consumption. This information is usually mentioned on the product label.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying. Follow all safety instructions on the product label.

For specific recommendations tailored to your exact field conditions and pest pressure, it is always advisable to consult with the local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts.
