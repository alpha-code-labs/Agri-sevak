As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following fertilizer schedule for Carrot cultivation in Haryana. These recommendations are based on scientific research and aim to optimize yield and quality, while emphasizing the importance of soil testing for precise nutrient management.

**General NPK Recommendation for Carrot in Haryana:**
For optimal growth, carrots typically require a balanced supply of Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P2O5), and Potassium (K2O). A common recommendation is **70-80 kg N, 50-60 kg P2OO5, and 70-80 kg K2O per acre**, along with Sulphur.

Below are the recommended doses using the specified fertilizers, assuming a target of approximately 70 kg N, 50 kg P2O5, 70 kg K2O, and 25-30 kg Sulphur per acre.

**1. Granular Fertilizers (Basal and Top-dressing):**

**Option A: Using DAP, Muriate of Potash, Urea, and Elemental Sulphur**

*   **Basal Application (at the time of sowing):**
    *   **DAP (Di-ammonium Phosphate):** 110 kg/acre (This provides approximately 20 kg N and 50 kg P2O5)
    *   **Muriate of Potash (MOP) (Potash):** 120 kg/acre (This provides approximately 72 kg K2O)
    *   **Sulphur (Elemental Sulphur 90% WDG):** 28 kg/acre (This provides approximately 25 kg Sulphur)
    *   **Urea:** 55 kg/acre (This provides approximately 25 kg N)

*   **Top Dressing (30-40 days after sowing):**
    *   **Urea:** 55 kg/acre (This provides approximately 25 kg N)

    *Total nutrient supplied by this option:* Approximately 70 kg N, 50 kg P2O5, 72 kg K2O, and 25 kg S per acre.

**Option B: Using SSP, Muriate of Potash, and Urea (as an alternative for P and S)**

*   **Basal Application (at the time of sowing):**
    *   **Single Super Phosphate (SSP):** 315 kg/acre (This provides approximately 50 kg P2O5 and 35 kg Sulphur)
    *   **Muriate of Potash (MOP) (Potash):** 120 kg/acre (This provides approximately 72 kg K2O)
    *   **Urea:** 75 kg/acre (This provides approximately 34.5 kg N)

*   **Top Dressing (30-40 days after sowing):**
    *   **Urea:** 75 kg/acre (This provides approximately 34.5 kg N)

    *Total nutrient supplied by this option:* Approximately 69 kg N, 50 kg P2O5, 72 kg K2O, and 35 kg S per acre.

**2. Nano Fertilizers (Foliar Application - Supplementary):**

Nano fertilizers are highly efficient and are recommended as supplementary nutrition to granular fertilizers, especially during critical growth stages.

*   **Nano-Urea (Liquid 4% N):**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml/L of water.
    *   **Application:** 2-3 foliar sprays. The first spray can be given around 30-45 days after sowing, and subsequent sprays at 15-20 day intervals, depending on crop vigor and requirement.

*   **Nano-DAP (Liquid 8% N, 16% P2O5):**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml/L of water.
    *   **Application:** 2-3 foliar sprays. This can be applied during early vegetative growth and root development stages, often coinciding with Nano-Urea sprays.

**3. NPK (Complex Fertilizers):**

Complex NPK fertilizers (e.g., 12:32:16, 10:26:26, 19:19:19) can be used as a basal dose to provide a combination of N, P, and K. The specific dose will depend on the grade of NPK fertilizer chosen and the remaining nutrient requirements.

*   **General Guidance:** If using an NPK complex, calculate the amount needed to meet the P2O5 and K2O requirements first. Then, supplement the remaining N requirement with **Urea** and any remaining K2O with **Muriate of Potash (MOP)**. For example, if using **NPK (12:32:16)**, approximately 150-160 kg/acre can be applied as a basal dose, and the remaining N and K would be adjusted with **Urea** and **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** respectively. Sulphur would also need to be added separately if not covered by the NPK complex.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Soil Testing:** The most accurate fertilizer recommendations come from a recent soil test report. Please get your soil tested at the HAU Soil Testing Laboratory to determine the exact nutrient status of your field. This will help in fine-tuning these general recommendations.
*   **Organic Matter:** Incorporating well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost (20-25 tonnes/acre) significantly improves soil health, nutrient availability, and water retention, reducing the need for chemical fertilizers.
*   **Micronutrients:** Carrots may also require micronutrients like Boron, Zinc, and Manganese, especially in deficient soils. A soil test will identify such deficiencies.
*   **Application Method:** Ensure uniform application of granular fertilizers. Basal doses should be incorporated into the soil before sowing. Foliar sprays should be done in the morning or late afternoon for better absorption.
