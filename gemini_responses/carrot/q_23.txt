Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified recommendations for seed and soil treatment processes for carrot cultivation in Haryana. These treatments are crucial for managing common seed-borne and soil-borne diseases and pests, ensuring a healthy crop stand and optimal yield.

Please ensure to follow all safety precautions while handling chemicals and always refer to the product label for specific instructions and latest recommendations.

### Recommended Seed Treatment Process for Carrot

Seed treatment is vital to protect young seedlings from early-season fungal pathogens causing damping-off and some seed-borne diseases.

*   **For broad-spectrum fungal protection (Damping-off, Alternaria blight):**
    *   Treat seeds with **Thiram** at 2.5-3.0 g per kg of seed.
    *   Alternatively, use **Captan** at 2.5-3.0 g per kg of seed.
    *   For enhanced protection against a wider range of fungi, a combination of **Carbendazim** at 1.0 g per kg of seed along with **Thiram** at 2.0 g per kg of seed can be used.
*   **For specific control of Oomycetes (e.g., *Pythium* causing damping-off):**
    *   Treat seeds with **Metalaxyl** at 1.0-2.0 g per kg of seed. This is often used in combination with a contact fungicide like Thiram or Mancozeb.
*   **For biological control:**
    *   Treat seeds with a bio-fungicide like **Trichoderma viride** at 4-5 g per kg of seed. Mix the required quantity of bio-fungicide with a small amount of water to make a slurry, then coat the seeds evenly and dry them in shade before sowing.

### Recommended Soil Treatment Process for Carrot

Soil treatment targets soil-borne diseases like damping-off, Sclerotinia rot, Rhizoctonia root rot, Fusarium wilt, and economically important pests like root-knot nematodes.

*   **For general soil-borne fungal diseases (Damping-off, Sclerotinia, Rhizoctonia):**
    *   **Biological Soil Application:** Incorporate **Trichoderma viride** at 2.5 kg per acre into the soil. Mix it thoroughly with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost and apply it to the field 15-20 days before sowing.
    *   **Chemical Drench (for specific hot spots or high disease pressure):** If damping-off is a recurring problem, a drench application of **Propamocarb hydrochloride** at 2-3 ml per litre of water can be applied around the base of seedlings immediately after emergence.
*   **For Root-Knot Nematodes (*Meloidogyne* spp.):**
    *   **Pre-sowing Soil Incorporation (Granular):**
        *   Apply **Cadusafos** 10% G at 10 kg per acre, incorporated into the soil to a depth of 10-15 cm before sowing.
        *   Alternatively, apply **Ethoprophos** 10% G at 10 kg per acre, incorporated into the soil before sowing.
    *   **Pre-sowing Soil Drench/In-furrow Application (Liquid):**
        *   Apply **Fluopyram** at 200-250 ml per acre as a pre-sowing drench or in-furrow application at the time of sowing.
    *   **Biological Soil Application:** Incorporate **Purpureocillium lilacinum** (formerly *Paecilomyces lilacinus*) at 2.5 kg per acre into the soil. Mix it with 50-100 kg of FYM and apply it 15-20 days before sowing.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always ensure proper field sanitation and crop rotation to minimize disease and pest build-up.
*   Use certified disease-free seeds.
*   Monitor your crop regularly for any signs of disease or pest infestation.
*   The efficacy of treatments can be influenced by soil type, moisture, and environmental conditions.
