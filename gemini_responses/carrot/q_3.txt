Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding various rot types in carrots. Effective management requires an integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods.

Let's address each rot type:

1.  **Fruit Rot:** This is not known to affect Carrot, as carrots are root vegetables, not fruits.

For all other rot types (Root, Stem, Foot, Collar, Crown, Neck, Black, Seed, and Seedling rot), which are significant issues in carrot cultivation, here is a comprehensive control strategy:

---

### **I. Seed Rot and Seedling Rot (Damping-off)**

These occur during germination and early seedling stages, primarily caused by soil-borne pathogens like *Pythium* spp., *Phytophthora* spp., *Rhizoctonia solani*, and *Fusarium* spp.

**A. Cultural Practices:**
*   Use high-quality, certified disease-free seeds.
*   Ensure proper seedbed preparation with good drainage.
*   Avoid overwatering, especially immediately after sowing.
*   Sow seeds at optimal soil temperature for rapid germination.

**B. Biological Control:**
*   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds with bio-agents like *Trichoderma viride* or *Pseudomonas fluorescens* at 5-10 g/kg of seed.

**C. Chemical Control (Seed Treatment):**
*   Treat seeds before sowing with any of the following CIBRC approved fungicides:
    *   **Thiram** at 2-3 g/kg of seed.
    *   **Carbendazim** at 1-2 g/kg of seed.
    *   **Metalaxyl-M** at 1-2 g/kg of seed (especially effective against *Pythium* and *Phytophthora*).
    *   A combination of **Carbendazim + Thiram** at 2 g/kg of seed (1:1 ratio).

### **II. Root, Stem, Foot, Collar, Crown, and Neck Rots**

These are often complex diseases affecting the root, crown, or basal stem region of mature or developing carrots. Common pathogens include *Sclerotinia sclerotiorum* (White Mold), *Rhizoctonia solani*, *Pythium* spp., *Phytophthora* spp., and *Fusarium* spp. Neck rot can also be associated with *Alternaria* species.

**A. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice a 3-4 year crop rotation with non-host crops (e.g., cereals) to reduce pathogen build-up in the soil. Avoid planting carrots after other susceptible crops like beans, cabbage, or potatoes.
*   **Soil Drainage:** Ensure excellent soil drainage. Raised beds can be beneficial in areas prone to waterlogging.
*   **Planting Density:** Maintain optimal plant spacing to improve air circulation and reduce humidity around the plants.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush, susceptible growth.
*   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris from the field to reduce inoculum sources.
*   **Weed Control:** Manage weeds, as they can act as alternate hosts and impede air circulation.
*   **Avoid Injury:** Minimize mechanical injury to roots and crowns during intercultural operations.
*   **Timely Harvest:** Harvest carrots at maturity to prevent over-ripening and increased susceptibility to rot.

**B. Biological Control:**
*   **Soil Application:** Apply *Trichoderma viride* or *Pseudomonas fluorescens* as a soil drench or mix with farmyard manure (FYM) at 2.5 kg/acre, especially at the time of sowing or transplanting.

**C. Chemical Control (Field Application):**
*   **For *Sclerotinia* Rot (White Mold):**
    *   **Carbendazim** at 0.5-1.0 g/L of water as a soil drench around the base of plants.
    *   **Thiophanate Methyl** at 0.75-1.0 g/L of water as a soil drench.
    *   **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water as a foliar spray or drench.
*   **For *Rhizoctonia*, *Pythium*, *Phytophthora*, *Fusarium* Rots:**
    *   **Propamocarb Hydrochloride** at 2-3 ml/L of water as a soil drench.
    *   **Metalaxyl-M + Mancozeb** (combination product) at 2-2.5 g/L of water as a soil drench or foliar spray.
    *   **Validamycin** at 2-3 ml/L of water as a soil drench, particularly effective against *Rhizoctonia*.
    *   **Carbendazim** at 0.5-1.0 g/L of water as a soil drench.

### **III. Black Rot**

Black rot in carrots is primarily caused by *Alternaria radicina*, affecting roots, crowns, and sometimes seeds.

**A. Cultural Practices:**
*   Use disease-free seeds.
*   Practice crop rotation with non-umbelliferous crops.
*   Remove and destroy infected plant residues.
*   Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day, to reduce leaf wetness.

**B. Chemical Control (Foliar Spray/Drench):**
*   Apply fungicides at the first sign of disease or as a preventive measure in susceptible areas:
    *   **Mancozeb** at 2-2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Chlorothalonil** at 2 g/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water.
    *   **Difenoconazole** at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   A combination of **Azoxystrobin + Difenoconazole** (combination product) at 1 ml/L of water.

**General Recommendation:**
Always read the label of the specific product for precise dosage and application instructions, as formulations can vary. It is crucial to implement an integrated disease management approach for sustainable and effective control of rot diseases in carrots.
