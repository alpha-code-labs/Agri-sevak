As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies in Carrot cultivation in Haryana:

It is crucial to adopt an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, mechanical, and chemical methods for sustainable pest control. Always scout your fields regularly to identify pests early and accurately.

### Control of Beetles in Carrot

Several beetle species can affect carrots, with wireworms (larvae of click beetles) and flea beetles being the most common concerns.

**1. Wireworms (Larvae of Click Beetles):**
Wireworms are soil-dwelling pests that feed on germinating seeds and roots, causing significant damage.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Practice crop rotation, avoiding planting carrots after grasses or cereals which can harbor wireworms.
    *   Ensure thorough land preparation and deep plowing to expose larvae to predators and adverse weather conditions.
    *   Remove crop residues and weeds that can serve as alternative hosts.
*   **Chemical Control (if infestation is severe and identified):**
    *   **Soil Application (Pre-sowing/At Sowing):**
        *   **Fipronil** 0.3% GR: Apply 20-25 kg/acre and incorporate into the soil before sowing.
        *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: Apply 2.0-2.5 L/acre mixed with irrigation water or as a drench before sowing or at sowing.

**2. Flea Beetles:**
These small, jumping beetles can cause shot-hole damage to leaves, especially on young carrot seedlings, hindering their growth.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Maintain good field sanitation and remove weeds that can host flea beetles.
    *   Ensure adequate moisture and fertility to promote vigorous plant growth, making them more tolerant to damage.
*   **Chemical Control (if infestation is severe on young plants):**
    *   **Foliar Spray:**
        *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: 125-150 ml/acre.
        *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: 50-75 g/acre.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: 100-125 ml/acre.

### Control of Weevils in Carrot

The Carrot Weevil (Listronotus oregonensis) is the primary weevil pest of carrots. Adults feed on foliage, while larvae tunnel into the roots, causing malformation and decay.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Implement a strict crop rotation program, avoiding planting carrots or other susceptible crops (like celery, parsley) in the same field for at least 2-3 years.
    *   Remove host weeds such as wild carrot, plantain, and dock from around the field.
    *   Deep plowing after harvest can help expose and destroy overwintering adults and pupae.
*   **Chemical Control (if infestation is severe):**
    *   **Foliar Spray (targeting adult weevils):**
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: 100-125 ml/acre.
        *   **Cypermethrin** 25% EC: 100-120 ml/acre.
    *   **Soil Application (if larval damage is anticipated or observed):**
        *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: 2.0-2.5 L/acre, applied as a drench or incorporated into the soil.

### Control of Sawflies in Carrot

This is not known to affect Carrot. Sawflies are generally not considered a pest of carrots.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the label instructions for any pesticide, including dosage, application method, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
*   For precise and up-to-date recommendations tailored to your specific field conditions, please consult your local HAU Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or agricultural extension specialist.
