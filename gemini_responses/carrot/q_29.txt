As a Senior Agronomist, I must clarify that "Dropping (Flower drop, Fruit drop, and Tinda/Boll dropping)" is not a known issue or a common concern in the commercial cultivation of carrots (Daucus carota subsp. sativus) for their roots.

Carrots are primarily grown for their edible taproots. While carrots do produce flowers and seeds in their second year of growth (if left in the ground for seed production), flower or fruit (seed pod) dropping is not a typical problem that affects the marketable root yield.

Specifically:
*   **Flower drop and Fruit drop** are not relevant issues for carrot root production, as the flowers and fruits are not the harvested product. If a farmer is growing carrots for seed, then factors like extreme temperatures, water stress, or nutrient deficiencies could potentially affect seed set, but "dropping" as a specific condition requiring control measures is not commonly identified.
*   **Tinda/Boll dropping** is not known to affect Carrot. Tinda (Indian round gourd) is a cucurbit, and boll dropping refers to cotton, neither of which is related to carrots.
