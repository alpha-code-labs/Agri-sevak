As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Carrot cultivation in Haryana:

### Control Measures for Pests in Carrot

**1. Borers (referring to soil-dwelling pests like Wireworms and Cutworms that bore into roots):**
Carrots can be affected by soil pests such as wireworms and cutworms, which can bore into the developing roots, causing significant damage.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Ensure proper field sanitation and removal of crop residues.
    *   Deep ploughing during summer can expose soil pests to predators and sunlight, reducing their population.
    *   Avoid planting carrots in fields with a history of severe wireworm or cutworm infestation.
*   **Chemical Control (Pre-sowing/At Sowing):**
    *   For wireworms and cutworms, soil application or drenching with appropriate insecticides can be effective.
    *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: Apply 2.5 litres per acre mixed in 500-1000 litres of water as a drenching application before sowing or at the time of land preparation, incorporating it into the soil.
    *   **Fipronil** 0.3% GR: Apply 10-15 kg per acre as a soil application at the time of sowing or transplanting.

**2. Caterpillars (General defoliating caterpillars and surface-feeding cutworms):**
Various caterpillar species can feed on carrot foliage, leading to defoliation. Cutworms can also feed on young seedlings at ground level or bore into roots.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Regular monitoring of fields for early signs of caterpillar activity.
    *   Hand-picking of larger caterpillars in small plots.
*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray for defoliators):**
    *   **Emamectin Benzoate** 5% SG: Apply 88-100 g per acre in 200-400 litres of water.
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC: Apply 60 ml per acre in 200-400 litres of water.
    *   **Indoxacarb** 14.5% SC: Apply 200 ml per acre in 200-400 litres of water.
*   **Chemical Control (For Cutworms if not controlled by soil application):**
    *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: Apply 2.5 litres per acre as a drenching application around the base of plants, preferably in the evening.

**3. Diamondback moth:**
This is not known to affect Carrot. Diamondback moth (*Plutella xylostella*) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower, mustard).

**4. Leaf folder:**
A specific 'leaf folder' pest is not commonly reported as a major pest of carrots in Haryana. However, if general caterpillars cause leaf rolling or folding symptoms, the control measures recommended for 'Caterpillars' above would be effective.
