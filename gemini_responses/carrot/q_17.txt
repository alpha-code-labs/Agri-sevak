As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend the following doses of organic manures for carrot cultivation in Haryana to enhance soil health, nutrient availability, and crop yield:

*   **Farmyard Manure (FYM):**
    *   Apply **15-20 tonnes per acre** (approximately 15,000-20,000 kg per acre).
    *   It should be well-decomposed and incorporated into the soil at least 2-3 weeks before sowing. This helps improve soil structure, water holding capacity, and provides a slow release of essential nutrients.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   Apply **3-5 tonnes per acre** (approximately 3,000-5,000 kg per acre).
    *   Vermicompost can be used as a substitute or supplement to FYM. It is richer in nutrients and microbial activity. Incorporate it into the soil during land preparation.

*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract):**
    *   Sagarika is a biostimulant derived from red and brown seaweeds, rich in plant growth regulators, amino acids, and micronutrients. It is not a bulk manure but enhances nutrient uptake and plant vigor.
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Mix **2.5-5 ml of Sagarika per litre of water**.
        *   Apply as a foliar spray at critical growth stages:
            *   First spray: 20-25 days after sowing.
            *   Second spray: 40-45 days after sowing (during root development stage).
    *   **Soil Application (Drenching/Drip):**
        *   Apply **500 ml to 1 litre of Sagarika per acre** mixed with irrigation water or as a drench around the root zone.
        *   This can be done at sowing or during early growth stages to stimulate root development.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always ensure the FYM and vermicompost are well-decomposed to avoid nutrient immobilization and pest issues.
*   The exact dose may vary slightly based on soil test reports and the specific nutrient status of your field. A soil test is always recommended for precise nutrient management.
*   Integrate these organic inputs with balanced chemical fertilizers as per soil test recommendations for optimal carrot production.
