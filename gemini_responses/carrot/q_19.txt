Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice on addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium) in carrots, specifically for the conditions in Haryana.

It is crucial to emphasize that visual symptoms are indicative, but a **soil test** is the most accurate method to diagnose nutrient deficiencies and determine the precise fertilizer requirements for your specific field. HAU strongly recommends regular soil testing.

Here's how to address deficiencies for each macro-nutrient:

### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** General yellowing (chlorosis) of older leaves, stunted growth, thin stems, and overall pale green appearance of the plant.
*   **Correction:** Nitrogen is highly mobile in the soil, so split applications are most effective to minimize leaching losses.
    *   **Recommended Dose:** 60-80 kg N per acre for optimal carrot yield in Haryana.
    *   **Application:**
        *   Apply 1/3 of the total Nitrogen requirement as a basal dose before sowing.
        *   Apply the remaining 2/3 in two equal splits as top-dressing at 30 and 45 days after sowing.
    *   **Chemicals:**
        *   **Urea** (46% N): Apply approximately **130-175 kg/acre of Urea** (to provide 60-80 kg N/acre) in the split application method described above.
        *   Alternatively, if **Di-Ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** is used for Phosphorus, adjust the Urea quantity accordingly, as DAP also provides Nitrogen.

### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Purplish discoloration of older leaves, stunted growth, poor root development, and delayed maturity. The leaves may appear dull and dark green before turning purplish.
*   **Correction:** Phosphorus is relatively immobile in the soil, so it should be applied as a basal dose and thoroughly mixed into the soil to ensure availability to the developing root system.
    *   **Recommended Dose:** 40-60 kg P2O5 per acre.
    *   **Application:** Apply the entire Phosphorus requirement as a basal dose before sowing.
    *   **Chemicals:**
        *   **Single Superphosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5): Apply approximately **250-375 kg/acre of Single Superphosphate (SSP)** (to provide 40-60 kg P2O5/acre) as a basal application, thoroughly mixed into the soil before sowing.
        *   Alternatively, **Di-Ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5): Apply approximately **87-130 kg/acre of Di-Ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (to provide 40-60 kg P2O5/acre) as a basal application. If using DAP, remember to reduce the Nitrogen application from Urea accordingly.

### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Yellowing and browning (scorching) of leaf margins, especially on older leaves. The leaves may appear crinkled or curled, and the plant may exhibit weak stems and poor root quality.
*   **Correction:** Potassium can be applied as a basal dose or in splits, similar to Nitrogen, depending on soil type and crop duration. For carrots, a basal application is generally effective.
    *   **Recommended Dose:** 40-60 kg K2O per acre.
    *   **Application:** Apply the entire Potassium requirement as a basal dose before sowing, mixed into the soil.
    *   **Chemicals:**
        *   **Muriate of Potash (MOP) / Potassium Chloride** (60% K2O): Apply approximately **67-100 kg/acre of Muriate of Potash (MOP) / Potassium Chloride** (to provide 40-60 kg K2O/acre) as a basal dose, mixed into the soil before sowing.
        *   Alternatively, **Sulphate of Potash (SOP) / Potassium Sulphate** (50% K2O): Apply approximately **80-120 kg/acre of Sulphate of Potash (SOP) / Potassium Sulphate** (to provide 40-60 kg K2O/acre) as a basal dose. SOP is preferred in soils where chloride accumulation is a concern, though carrots are generally not highly sensitive to chloride.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Soil Testing:** Always conduct a soil test to get precise recommendations for your field. This will help avoid over-application, which can be wasteful and harmful to the environment.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management (INM):** Combine chemical fertilizers with organic manures (Farm Yard Manure, compost) to improve soil health, nutrient availability, and water retention.
*   **Application Method:** Ensure uniform application of fertilizers for best results.
*   **Watering:** Adequate moisture is essential for nutrient uptake by plants.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively address macro-nutrient deficiencies in your carrot crop and ensure healthy growth and good yields.
