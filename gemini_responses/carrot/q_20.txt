Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I advise that addressing micronutrient deficiencies in carrots is crucial for optimal yield and quality. The first and most important step is always a **soil test** to accurately diagnose specific deficiencies and their severity. This allows for precise and efficient nutrient management.

Here's how to address common micronutrient deficiencies in carrots:

### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, small and distorted leaves (little leaf), interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, and rosetting.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 2-3 times at 10-15 day intervals.
        *   **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (21% Zn) @ 2.5-5 g/L water.
        *   **Zinc EDTA** (12% Zn) @ 0.5-1 g/L water.
    *   **Soil Application (Pre-plant or at sowing):**
        *   **Zinc sulphate monohydrate** (33% Zn) @ 5-10 kg/acre.
        *   **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (21% Zn) @ 10-20 kg/acre.

### 2. Iron (Fe) / Ferrous Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Prominent interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, where the leaf tissue turns yellow while the veins remain distinctly green.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 2-3 times at 10-15 day intervals, especially effective in alkaline soils common in Haryana.
        *   **Ferrous sulphate** (19% Fe) @ 5 g/L water.
        *   **Ferrous EDTA** (12% Fe) @ 1-2 g/L water.
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   **Ferrous sulphate** (19% Fe) @ 10-20 kg/acre. (Note: Less effective in high pH soils).

### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Cracking of roots (both internal and external), "brown heart" or "canker" in the root, stunted growth, deformation of young leaves, and brittle leaves.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 1-2 times during the vegetative growth phase.
        *   **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (20% B) @ 1-1.5 g/L water.
        *   **Boric acid** (17% B) @ 1.5-2 g/L water.
    *   **Soil Application (Pre-plant):**
        *   **Borax** (10.5-11.3% B) @ 4-6 kg/acre.
        *   **Boric acid** (17% B) @ 2-3 kg/acre. (Caution: Boron has a narrow range between deficiency and toxicity; do not over-apply).

### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Affects growing points, leading to tip burn on young leaves, stunted root growth, internal browning, and sometimes cavity spot (though cavity spot is multi-factorial). Youngest leaves may be distorted or necrotic.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 2-3 times during active growth.
        *   **Calcium chloride** (27% Ca) @ 5 g/L water.
        *   **Calcium nitrate** (19% Ca) @ 5 g/L water.
    *   **Soil Application (Pre-plant or during land preparation):**
        *   **Gypsum** (Calcium sulphate dihydrate) @ 200-400 kg/acre (beneficial for general soil health and Ca supply, especially in sodic soils).
        *   **Calcium nitrate** @ 20-30 kg/acre.

### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, where the leaf tissue turns yellow between the green veins, often starting from the leaf margins and progressing inwards. Leaves may become brittle.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 2-3 times at 10-15 day intervals.
        *   **Magnesium sulphate** (9.6% Mg) @ 5 g/L water.
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   **Magnesium sulphate** @ 10-20 kg/acre.

### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, similar to iron deficiency but often with a finer network of green veins. Stunted growth.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 2-3 times at 10-15 day intervals, particularly effective in alkaline soils.
        *   **Manganese sulphate** (28-30% Mn) @ 2.5-5 g/L water.
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   **Manganese sulphate** @ 10-15 kg/acre. (Note: Less effective in high pH soils).

**General Recommendations:**

*   **Soil Testing:** Always conduct a soil test before applying any micronutrients to determine the exact deficiency and avoid over-application, which can be toxic.
*   **Foliar Sprays:** For quick correction, foliar sprays are generally more effective, especially for iron, zinc, and manganese in alkaline soils. Ensure good coverage of the foliage.
*   **Timing:** Apply foliar sprays during the cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to prevent scorching and improve absorption.
*   **Water Volume:** Use sufficient water volume (e.g., 200-400 L/acre for foliar sprays) to ensure proper coverage.
*   **Adjuvants:** Consider adding a non-ionic spreader/sticker to foliar sprays for better adhesion and absorption.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management:** Combine micronutrient applications with balanced NPK fertilization and organic matter additions for long-term soil health and nutrient availability.
