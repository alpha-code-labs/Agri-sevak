As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), here is the scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Carrot:

### Control Measures for Pests in Carrot

**1. Grasshopper**
Grasshoppers are polyphagous and can feed on carrot foliage, especially young plants, causing defoliation.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Maintain good field sanitation by removing weeds and crop residues, which can serve as breeding grounds and shelter for grasshoppers.
    *   Deep ploughing after harvest can expose grasshopper eggs to predators and adverse weather conditions, reducing future populations.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   For effective control, especially during early stages of infestation, consider spraying with CIBRC approved insecticides:
        *   **Malathion 50% EC** @ 1.0 - 1.5 L per acre in 200-400 L of water.
        *   **Quinalphos 25% EC** @ 1.0 - 1.5 L per acre in 200-400 L of water.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC** @ 100 - 150 ml per acre in 200-400 L of water.
    *   Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage. Apply preferably in the morning or evening.

**2. Painted bug**
This is not known to affect Carrot. Painted bug primarily infests cruciferous crops.

**3. Red cotton bug**
This is not known to affect Carrot. Red cotton bug is a pest of cotton and other malvaceous plants.

**4. Black ants**
This is not known to be a direct pest causing significant damage to Carrot. Black ants are generally not considered primary pests of carrot plants. Their presence is often benign or associated with other pests like aphids (which produce honeydew). If aphids are present, controlling the aphid population will often reduce ant activity.
