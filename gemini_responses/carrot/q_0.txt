As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in carrots in Haryana:

### General Management Practices for Fungal Diseases in Carrots:

Before discussing specific chemical controls, it is crucial to implement integrated disease management strategies:
*   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting carrots or other susceptible umbelliferous crops (e.g., coriander, fennel) in the same field for at least 2-3 years.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available and suitable for Haryana conditions, choose disease-resistant or tolerant carrot varieties.
*   **Seed Treatment:** Use certified, disease-free seeds. Seed treatment with fungicides can protect seedlings from early infections.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected crop debris after harvest to reduce inoculum for the next season.
*   **Optimal Spacing:** Ensure proper plant spacing to allow for good air circulation, which reduces leaf wetness and fungal growth.
*   **Irrigation Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation late in the day, as prolonged leaf wetness promotes fungal development. Drip irrigation is preferable.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Maintain balanced fertilization, as excessive nitrogen can make plants more susceptible to some diseases.

### Specific Fungal Diseases and Their Control:

#### 1. Alternaria Leaf Blight (Alternaria dauci)

This is a common and significant disease in carrots, causing dark brown to black spots on older leaves, which can enlarge and coalesce, leading to blighting.

*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
    *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP at 2.5 kg/acre (dissolved in 500-750 L water).
    *   **Chlorothalonil** 75% WP at 2 kg/acre (dissolved in 500-750 L water).
    *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC at 200 ml/acre (dissolved in 500-750 L water).
    *   **Difenoconazole** 25% EC at 100 ml/acre (dissolved in 500-750 L water).
    *   **Propiconazole** 25% EC at 200 ml/acre (dissolved in 500-750 L water).
    *   **Tebuconazole** 25.9% EC at 250 ml/acre (dissolved in 500-750 L water).
    *   **Copper Oxychloride** 50% WP at 1.25 kg/acre (dissolved in 500-750 L water).
    *   Apply sprays preventively or at the first sign of disease, repeating at 10-14 day intervals as needed. Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

#### 2. Anthracnose (Colletotrichum dematium)

Anthracnose can cause irregular, water-soaked lesions on leaves, petioles, and stems, which later turn brown to black.

*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
    *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP at 2.5 kg/acre (dissolved in 500-750 L water).
    *   **Chlorothalonil** 75% WP at 2 kg/acre (dissolved in 500-750 L water).
    *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 250-500 g/acre (dissolved in 500-750 L water).
    *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC at 200 ml/acre (dissolved in 500-750 L water).
    *   Apply sprays preventively or at the first sign of disease, repeating at 10-14 day intervals as needed.

#### 3. Blast

This is not known to affect Carrot.

#### 4. Blight (General)

The term "Blight" is broad. In carrots, the most common and significant blight is Alternaria Leaf Blight, which has been addressed above. If you are referring to another specific blight, please provide more details.

#### 5. Brown Spot

This is not a specific disease name for carrots. Many fungal diseases, including Alternaria, can cause brown spots. Please refer to the control measures for Alternaria Leaf Blight if you observe brown spots on carrot leaves.

#### 6. Downy Mildew (Plasmopara nivea / P. umbelliferarum)

Downy mildew appears as yellowish spots on the upper leaf surface with a purplish-grey, fuzzy growth on the underside, especially in cool, humid conditions.

*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
    *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP at 2.5 kg/acre (dissolved in 500-750 L water).
    *   **Chlorothalonil** 75% WP at 2 kg/acre (dissolved in 500-750 L water).
    *   **Metalaxyl 8% + Mancozeb 64% WP** at 500 g/acre (dissolved in 500-750 L water).
    *   **Dimethomorph 9% + Mancozeb 60% WP** at 1 kg/acre (dissolved in 500-750 L water).
    *   **Cymoxanil 8% + Mancozeb 64% WP** at 600 g/acre (dissolved in 500-750 L water).
    *   **Propamocarb Hydrochloride** 72.2% SL at 1.5-2 L/acre (dissolved in 500-750 L water).
    *   Apply preventively or at the first sign of disease, especially during periods of high humidity and moderate temperatures.

#### 7. Powdery Mildew (Erysiphe heraclei / Leveillula taurica)

Powdery mildew appears as white, powdery patches on the upper and lower surfaces of leaves, stems, and petioles, leading to reduced photosynthesis and yield.

*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
    *   **Sulphur** 80% WP at 1.5-2 kg/acre (dissolved in 500-750 L water).
    *   **Myclobutanil** 10% WP at 120 g/acre (dissolved in 500-750 L water).
    *   **Penconazole** 10% EC at 100 ml/acre (dissolved in 500-750 L water).
    *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC at 200 ml/acre (dissolved in 500-750 L water).
    *   **Tebuconazole** 25.9% EC at 250 ml/acre (dissolved in 500-750 L water).
    *   **Difenoconazole** 25% EC at 100 ml/acre (dissolved in 500-750 L water).
    *   Apply at the first appearance of symptoms, repeating at 10-14 day intervals. Ensure thorough coverage.

#### 8. Grey Mildew

This is not known to affect Carrot. (Note: Grey mold, caused by *Botrytis cinerea*, can affect carrots, particularly post-harvest or in very humid conditions, but "Grey mildew" is not a recognized disease name for carrots.)

Always read and follow the label instructions for any chemical product before use, including dosage, application method, and pre-harvest interval (PHI). For specific local recommendations, consult with your nearest Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or HAU extension specialist.
