As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the use of growth regulators and boron in carrot cultivation in Haryana:

**1. Ethephon (Ethrel)**
*   **Role in Carrot:** **Ethephon** is primarily used in carrot for inducing flowering in seed production crops to ensure timely and uniform seed set. Its application for general root growth or yield enhancement in commercial root production is not a standard recommended practice.
*   **Recommended Dose (for seed production):**
    *   Foliar spray of **Ethephon** at 250-500 mg/L (ppm) when plants are at the appropriate stage for flowering induction. The exact timing and concentration may vary based on specific cultivar and environmental conditions, and should be applied under expert supervision for seed production.

**2. 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D)**
*   **Role in Carrot:** **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid** is a synthetic auxin primarily known and used as a selective herbicide. Its application as a growth regulator in field-grown carrot crops is **not recommended** due to its strong herbicidal activity, which can cause severe phytotoxicity and damage to the carrot plants even at very low concentrations. Therefore, no recommended dose for its use as a growth regulator in commercial carrot production can be provided.

**3. Boron**
*   **Role in Carrot:** Boron is an essential micronutrient crucial for cell wall formation, sugar transport, and overall root development and quality in carrots. Deficiency can lead to symptoms like internal browning, cavity spot, and reduced yield.
*   **Recommended Dose:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 1-2 kg of **Sodium tetraborate decahydrate** (Borax) per acre, or 0.5-1 kg of **Boric acid** per acre, mixed with soil at the time of land preparation or sowing.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** For correcting deficiency or as a prophylactic measure, spray a 0.1-0.2% solution of **Sodium tetraborate decahydrate** (1-2 g/L of water) or **Boric acid** (0.5-1 g/L of water). Apply 1-2 sprays starting from 30-45 days after sowing, with an interval of 15-20 days, depending on the severity of deficiency or crop requirement. Ensure thorough coverage of foliage.
