As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), here are the recommended cultivation practices for Carrot in Haryana:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   Carrots are primarily direct-seeded.
    *   **Line sowing** is highly recommended over broadcasting. This facilitates inter-cultivation operations like weeding, thinning, and irrigation, leading to uniform root development and better yield.
    *   Sowing can be done on flat beds in rows or on the sides of raised beds (ridges) for better drainage and root shape, especially in heavy soils or areas prone to waterlogging.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   Due to the small size of carrot seeds, a shallow planting depth is crucial for good germination and emergence.
    *   Recommended depth: **0.5 to 1.5 cm**. Deeper sowing can lead to poor or delayed emergence.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   **Row-to-row spacing:** Maintain a distance of **20-30 cm** between rows.
    *   **Plant-to-plant spacing (after thinning):** After emergence, thinning is essential to achieve optimal root size and shape. Thin the seedlings to maintain a distance of **5-10 cm** between plants within a row.

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   The recommended seed dose depends on the sowing method, seed viability, and desired plant population.
    *   For line sowing, a seed rate of **2-4 kg/acre** is generally sufficient. Ensure good quality, viable seeds for optimal results.
