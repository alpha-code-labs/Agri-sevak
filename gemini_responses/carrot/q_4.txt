Wilt, including conditions sometimes referred to as Parawilt, is a significant concern for carrot cultivation in Haryana, primarily caused by soil-borne fungal pathogens like *Fusarium oxysporum* f. sp. *apii* and *Verticillium dahliae*, and occasionally by bacterial pathogens. These pathogens infect the root system, leading to blockages in the vascular tissue, causing the characteristic wilting, yellowing, and eventual death of the plant.

Effective management requires an integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical strategies.

### Integrated Management of Wilt in Carrot:

**1. Cultural Practices:**

*   **Crop Rotation:** Implement a strict 3-4 year crop rotation with non-host crops (e.g., cereals, maize, sorghum). Avoid planting carrots or other susceptible crops (like celery, parsley, coriander) in the same field consecutively.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available and suitable for Haryana's agro-climatic conditions, select and plant carrot varieties known for their resistance or tolerance to wilt diseases.
*   **Soil Solarization:** In summer, cover prepared beds with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks. This raises soil temperature, effectively reducing pathogen populations in the upper soil layers.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Promptly remove and destroy infected plant debris and diseased plants to prevent the spread of inoculum.
*   **Proper Drainage:** Ensure good soil drainage to prevent waterlogging, which can stress plants and favor pathogen development.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced fertilization to maintain plant vigor, as stressed plants are more susceptible to disease. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can promote lush growth susceptible to infection.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** Deep ploughing during summer can expose soil-borne pathogens to sunlight, reducing their viability.
*   **Avoid Mechanical Injury:** Minimize root damage during intercultural operations, as wounds can serve as entry points for pathogens.

**2. Biological Control:**

*   **Seed Treatment:**
    *   Treat carrot seeds with bio-fungicides before sowing.
    *   **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum** (2-5 g/kg seed).
    *   **Pseudomonas fluorescens** (10 g/kg seed).
*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum** (2-4 kg/acre) mixed with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost, 7-10 days before sowing or transplanting.
    *   Apply **Pseudomonas fluorescens** (2-4 kg/acre) mixed with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed FYM or compost, 7-10 days before sowing or transplanting. These beneficial microbes colonize the root zone, suppressing pathogen growth.

**3. Chemical Control:**

*   **Seed Treatment:**
    *   To protect seedlings from early infection, treat seeds with systemic fungicides.
    *   **Carbendazim 50% WP**: 2-3 g/kg seed.
    *   **Thiram 75% WS**: 2-3 g/kg seed (can be used alone or in combination with Carbendazim).
*   **Soil Drench/Drip Application:**
    *   For prophylactic treatment in infested fields or at the first sign of disease, apply fungicides as a soil drench around the root zone.
    *   **Carbendazim 50% WP**: 1-1.5 kg/acre, dissolved in sufficient water (e.g., 400-500 litres) for drenching the root zone. Alternatively, 1-2 g/L water for spot drenching individual plants (200-500 ml solution per plant).
    *   **Thiophanate-methyl 70% WP**: 1-1.5 kg/acre, dissolved in sufficient water for drenching, or 1-1.5 g/L water for spot drenching.
    *   **For suspected bacterial wilt:** If bacterial wilt symptoms are observed (e.g., soft rot of roots, slimy ooze from cut stems), a drench with an antibiotic combination can be considered.
        *   **Streptomycin sulphate 9% + Tetracycline hydrochloride 1% SP**: 0.5-1 g/L water, applied as a drench around the root zone.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions when handling chemical pesticides.
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in pathogens.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension specialists or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and the prevailing disease pressure.
