As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified approaches to address macro-nutrient deficiencies (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium/Potash) in Barseem (Trifolium alexandrinum L.) for Haryana conditions.

**Crucial First Step:** Always conduct a comprehensive soil test before sowing. This provides precise information on existing nutrient levels and helps in formulating an accurate and economical fertilizer recommendation, preventing both deficiencies and over-application.

### Addressing Nitrogen (N) Deficiency in Barseem

**Role of Nitrogen:** Nitrogen is vital for vegetative growth, chlorophyll formation, and protein synthesis.

**Deficiency Symptoms:** Stunted growth, pale green to yellowing of older leaves, and overall reduced vigor.

**Addressing Deficiency:**
Barseem, being a leguminous crop, forms a symbiotic relationship with *Rhizobium* bacteria in its root nodules, which fix atmospheric nitrogen. Therefore, its external nitrogen requirement is generally low after establishment.

*   **Initial Application (Starter Dose):** To support early growth before effective nodulation is fully established, a small starter dose of nitrogen is beneficial.
    *   Apply 15-20 kg N per acre at sowing. This can be supplied through:
        *   **Urea** (approx. 33-44 kg/acre, as Urea contains 46% N)
        *   **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (approx. 33-44 kg/acre, as DAP contains 18% N and 46% P2O5; adjust P application accordingly)
*   **Post-Establishment:** If proper *Rhizobium* inoculation has been done and effective nodulation is observed (pink nodules on roots), no further nitrogen application is typically required. Excessive nitrogen can inhibit nodulation.
*   **Foliar Application (for quick, temporary correction if severe deficiency is observed despite good nodulation):**
    *   Spray a 0.5-1% solution of **Urea** (5-10 g/L water). Apply during cooler parts of the day to avoid leaf scorch.

### Addressing Phosphorus (P) Deficiency in Barseem

**Role of Phosphorus:** Phosphorus is crucial for root development, nodulation, energy transfer (ATP), flowering, and overall plant vigor. Barseem has a high phosphorus requirement.

**Deficiency Symptoms:** Stunted growth, dark green to purplish discoloration of older leaves, poor root development, delayed maturity, and reduced nodulation.

**Addressing Deficiency:**
*   **Soil Application (Primary Method):** Phosphorus is relatively immobile in the soil, so basal application (at or before sowing) is most effective.
    *   Apply 60-80 kg P2O5 per acre at sowing. This can be supplied through:
        *   **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (approx. 375-500 kg/acre, as SSP contains 16% P2O5)
        *   **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (approx. 130-175 kg/acre, as DAP contains 46% P2O5 and 18% N; adjust N application accordingly)
*   **Foliar Application (for quick correction or supplementary feeding):**
    *   Spray a 0.5-1% solution of **Monoammonium Phosphate (MAP)** (5-10 g/L water) or **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (5-10 g/L water).

### Addressing Potassium (K) Deficiency in Barseem

**Role of Potassium:** Potassium enhances water use efficiency, improves disease resistance, strengthens stems, and contributes to overall plant health and forage quality.

**Deficiency Symptoms:** Yellowing and scorching (browning) of leaf margins, especially on older leaves; weak stems; and increased susceptibility to diseases and environmental stresses.

**Addressing Deficiency:**
*   **Soil Application (Primary Method):**
    *   Apply 40-60 kg K2O per acre at sowing. This can be supplied through:
        *   **Muriate of Potash (MOP) / Potassium Chloride** (approx. 67-100 kg/acre, as MOP contains 60% K2O)
        *   **Sulphate of Potash (SOP) / Potassium Sulphate** (approx. 80-120 kg/acre, as SOP contains 50% K2O)
*   **Foliar Application (for quick correction or supplementary feeding):**
    *   Spray a 0.5-1% solution of **Potassium Nitrate** (5-10 g/L water) or **Sulphate of Potash (SOP) / Potassium Sulphate** (5-10 g/L water).

### General Recommendations for Barseem Nutrient Management:

*   **Rhizobium Inoculation:** Always ensure proper seed inoculation with recommended *Rhizobium* strains specific for Barseem. This is critical for efficient nitrogen fixation.
*   **Organic Matter:** Incorporating well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost (10-15 tonnes/acre) before sowing significantly improves soil structure, water retention, and the availability of all macro and micro-nutrients.
*   **Irrigation:** Maintain adequate and timely irrigation, as nutrient uptake by plants is highly dependent on sufficient soil moisture.
*   **pH Management:** Ensure soil pH is within the optimal range (6.0-7.5) for Barseem, as extreme pH values can hinder nutrient availability and uptake.
