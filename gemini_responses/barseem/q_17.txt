As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following doses of organic manures for Barseem cultivation in Haryana to ensure optimal growth and soil health:

*   **Farmyard Manure (FYM):**
    *   Apply 10-15 tonnes of well-decomposed FYM per acre.
    *   It should be incorporated into the soil during land preparation, approximately 2-3 weeks before sowing.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   Apply 4-5 tonnes of vermicompost per acre.
    *   Vermicompost can be used as a supplement to FYM or as a partial replacement, also incorporated into the soil during land preparation.

*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract based product):**
    *   **Sagarika Liquid:**
        *   For foliar spray: Mix **2.5-5 ml** of **Sagarika Liquid** per litre of water and spray at critical growth stages (e.g., 20-25 days after sowing and after each cut).
        *   For soil application/drenching: Apply **1-2 litres** of **Sagarika Liquid** per acre, mixed with irrigation water or as a drench around the root zone.
    *   **Sagarika Granular:**
        *   Apply **8-10 kg** of **Sagarika Granular** per acre at the time of sowing or broadcasting, followed by light irrigation.
