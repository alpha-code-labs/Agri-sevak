As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm the following regarding your query:

*   **Fruit fly (Bactrocera spp.)**: This is not known to affect Barseem. Fruit flies are primarily pests of fruit crops.
*   **Ber fly (Carpomyia vesuviana)**: This is not known to affect Barseem. Ber fly is a highly specific pest of Ber (Ziziphus mauritiana) fruits.
