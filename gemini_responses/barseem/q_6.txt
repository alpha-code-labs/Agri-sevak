Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling viral diseases in Barseem.

It's important to understand that there is no direct chemical cure for viral diseases once a plant is infected. Management strategies primarily focus on preventing infection, controlling the vectors that spread the viruses, and implementing good cultural practices.

Let's address the specific conditions you've mentioned:

1.  **Stripe virus:** This is not known to affect Barseem.
2.  **Tristeza virus:** This is not known to affect Barseem.

For the other conditions – **Leaf curl, Mosaic, Yellow vein clearing,** and **Stunt virus** – these are symptoms often associated with common legume viruses like Alfalfa Mosaic Virus (AMV), Clover Yellow Vein Virus (CYVV), and Bean Yellow Mosaic Virus (BYMV) that can affect Barseem. These viruses are primarily transmitted by aphids and can also be seed-borne.

Here's how to control them:

### Integrated Management for Viral Diseases (Leaf curl, Mosaic, Yellow vein clearing, Stunt) in Barseem

**A. Cultural Practices (Prevention and Disease Management):**

*   **Use Certified, Virus-Free Seeds:** Always source seeds from reputable suppliers to ensure they are free from seed-borne viruses.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** If available, choose Barseem varieties known to have resistance or tolerance to common viral diseases in your region.
*   **Roguing:** Regularly inspect your field and promptly remove and destroy (by burning or deep burying) any plants showing symptoms of viral infection (e.g., mosaic, yellowing, stunting, leaf distortion). This prevents the virus from spreading to healthy plants.
*   **Weed Management:** Control weeds in and around your Barseem field. Many weeds can act as alternate hosts for both the viruses and their insect vectors (aphids).
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-leguminous crops to break the disease cycle and reduce the inoculum in the soil.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Avoid planting new Barseem fields adjacent to old, infected fields. Clean farm equipment thoroughly after working in infected areas.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure balanced fertilization to maintain plant vigor, which can help plants tolerate stress and potentially reduce symptom severity.

**B. Vector Control (Aphids):**

Since aphids are the primary vectors for most of these viruses, their timely control is crucial to prevent the spread of the disease. Apply insecticides when aphid populations are observed, especially during early crop stages.

*   **Foliar Application:**
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: 125-150 ml per acre
    *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: 40-50 g per acre
    *   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP: 20-40 g per acre
    *   **Dimethoate** 30% EC: 330-500 ml per acre
    *   **Methyl Demeton** 25% EC: 400-500 ml per acre

Always ensure to follow the specific instructions on the product label regarding dosage, application method, and safety precautions. For fodder crops like Barseem, it is crucial to observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) to ensure the fodder is safe for animal consumption. Consult your local agricultural extension officer for the most current and specific recommendations for your area in Haryana.
