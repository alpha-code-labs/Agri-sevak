As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies in Barseem in Haryana:

1.  **Beetles:**
    This is not known to affect Barseem.

2.  **Sawflies:**
    This is not known to affect Barseem.

3.  **Weevils:**
    Weevils, particularly the Alfalfa Weevil (Hypera postica), can occasionally infest Barseem, especially if grown in proximity to Lucerne (Alfalfa). The larvae feed on the terminal buds and young leaves, causing defoliation.

    **Control Measures for Weevils:**

    *   **Cultural Practices:**
        *   **Early Cutting:** If a significant infestation is observed, an early cutting of the Barseem crop can help remove a large portion of the larval population and disrupt their life cycle.
        *   **Field Sanitation:** Maintaining good field hygiene and removing crop residues can reduce overwintering sites for adult weevils.

    *   **Chemical Control:**
        Apply insecticides when infestation levels warrant, typically when there is noticeable defoliation or a high number of larvae are present. Ensure thorough spray coverage.

        *   **Malathion** 50% EC: Apply at 1.25 Litres per hectare (approximately 500 ml per acre) mixed in 500-600 Litres of water.
        *   **Quinalphos** 25% EC: Apply at 1.25 Litres per hectare (approximately 500 ml per acre) mixed in 500-600 Litres of water.

    *   **Important Note:** When using any insecticide on fodder crops like Barseem, it is crucial to strictly adhere to the recommended Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) mentioned on the product label. This ensures the safety of the fodder for livestock consumption. Typically, for the mentioned chemicals on fodder crops, a PHI of 7-10 days is advised. Always consult the specific product label for precise instructions and safety guidelines.
