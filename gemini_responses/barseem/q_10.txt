As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for managing pests in Barseem (Trifolium alexandrinum) in Haryana:

It is important to note that Barseem, being a fodder crop, requires careful consideration of pre-harvest intervals (PHI) when applying any pesticide to ensure the safety of livestock. Always consult the product label for specific instructions and PHI. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approaches, including cultural practices, should always be the first line of defense.

Here's the specific guidance for the pests you mentioned:

*   **Borers:**
    This is not known to affect Barseem as a significant pest requiring specific control measures.

*   **Caterpillars (General Defoliators):**
    Various caterpillar species can occasionally infest Barseem, leading to defoliation. For effective control, consider the following CIBRC approved insecticides:
    *   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG**: Apply at 88-100 g per acre.
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC**: Apply at 60 ml per acre.
    *   **Indoxacarb 14.5% SC**: Apply at 200 ml per acre.
    *   **Flubendiamide 20% WG**: Apply at 50 g per acre.

*   **Diamondback Moth (DBM):**
    This is not known to affect Barseem. Diamondback moth (*Plutella xylostella*) is a specialist pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower, mustard), not legumes like Barseem.

*   **Leaf Folder:**
    Leaf folders can occasionally affect Barseem by folding leaves and feeding within. Control measures are similar to those for general caterpillars:
    *   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG**: Apply at 88-100 g per acre.
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC**: Apply at 60 ml per acre.
    *   **Indoxacarb 14.5% SC**: Apply at 200 ml per acre.
    *   **Flubendiamide 20% WG**: Apply at 50 g per acre.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always ensure thorough spray coverage for optimal efficacy.
*   Use appropriate water volume (typically 200-300 litres per acre) for spraying.
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
*   Monitor your fields regularly to detect pest infestations early and apply control measures promptly when pest populations reach economic threshold levels.
