As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I advise that addressing micronutrient deficiencies in Barseem (Trifolium alexandrinum) is crucial for optimal growth, fodder yield, and quality. The most effective approach begins with a comprehensive soil test to accurately diagnose specific deficiencies and their severity.

Here's how to address the common micronutrient deficiencies in Barseem:

**General Recommendation:** Always conduct a soil test before applying any micronutrients. The dosages provided are general recommendations and should be adjusted based on soil test reports and crop specific requirements.

### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

Zinc deficiency is common in Haryana soils, especially in alkaline and calcareous conditions, which can significantly impact Barseem growth.

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, small and narrow leaves, and sometimes a purplish tint on older leaves.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Soil Application (Pre-sowing or at sowing):**
        *   Apply **Zinc sulfate heptahydrate** at 25 kg/acre.
        *   Alternatively, apply **Zinc sulfate monohydrate** at 15 kg/acre.
    *   **Foliar Spray (When symptoms appear):**
        *   Spray a 0.5% solution of **Zinc sulfate heptahydrate** (5 g/L of water) mixed with 0.25% unslaked lime (2.5 g/L of water) to neutralize acidity.
        *   Alternatively, use **Zinc EDTA** at 0.1% solution (1 g/L of water).
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, ensuring thorough coverage of the foliage.

### 2. Iron (Fe) Deficiency (Ferrous)

Iron deficiency, often termed "lime-induced chlorosis," is prevalent in high pH (alkaline/calcareous) soils common in Haryana, affecting Barseem's photosynthetic efficiency.

*   **Symptoms:** Prominent interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, with veins remaining green. In severe cases, the entire leaf may turn yellow or white, leading to stunted growth.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Foliar Spray (Most effective for quick correction):**
        *   Spray a 0.5-1% solution of **Ferrous sulfate** (5-10 g/L of water).
        *   Adding 0.1% citric acid (1 g/L of water) or 0.25% urea (2.5 g/L of water) can enhance absorption.
        *   Alternatively, use **Iron EDTA** at 0.1% solution (1 g/L of water).
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 7-10 day intervals until symptoms disappear. Soil application of iron is generally less effective in alkaline soils due to rapid fixation.

### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

Boron is essential for cell wall formation, pollen viability, and overall plant development in Barseem.

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, death of terminal buds (growing points), thickened and brittle leaves, poor flowering, and reduced seed set.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Soil Application (Pre-sowing):**
        *   Apply **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate) at 4-6 kg/acre.
        *   Alternatively, apply **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** at 1-1.5 kg/acre.
    *   **Foliar Spray (When symptoms appear or as a preventive measure at pre-flowering):**
        *   Spray a 0.1-0.2% solution of **Borax** (1-2 g/L of water).
        *   Alternatively, use **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** at 0.1% solution (1 g/L of water).

### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

While less common as a primary deficiency in many Haryana soils, calcium is vital for cell wall structure and root development. It can occur in very acidic or sandy soils.

*   **Symptoms:** Death of growing points, young leaves may be distorted, curled, or show a water-soaked appearance. Poor root development.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Soil Application (Pre-sowing):**
        *   If soil test indicates low calcium and acidic conditions, apply **Gypsum** (Calcium sulfate) at 200-400 kg/acre, as per soil test recommendations.
        *   For direct calcium supply, apply **Calcium nitrate** at 10-15 kg/acre.
    *   **Foliar Spray (When symptoms appear):**
        *   Spray a 0.5-1% solution of **Calcium nitrate** (5-10 g/L of water).
        *   Alternatively, use **Calcium chloride** at 0.5% solution (5 g/L of water).

### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

Magnesium is a central component of chlorophyll and crucial for photosynthesis in Barseem. It can occur in sandy soils, acidic soils, or where potassium levels are excessively high.

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, starting from the leaf margins and progressing inwards. Leaves may become brittle or develop a reddish-purple tint.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Soil Application (Pre-sowing):**
        *   Apply **Magnesium sulfate** at 10-20 kg/acre.
    *   **Foliar Spray (When symptoms appear):**
        *   Spray a 0.5-1% solution of **Magnesium sulfate** (5-10 g/L of water).

### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

Manganese deficiency can affect Barseem, particularly in high pH (alkaline) soils, organic soils, or over-limed soils. It plays a role in photosynthesis and enzyme activation.

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, often accompanied by small necrotic (dead) spots. Leaves may appear mottled or speckled. Symptoms can sometimes be confused with iron deficiency but often appear on slightly older young leaves.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Foliar Spray (Most effective for quick correction):**
        *   Spray a 0.5% solution of **Manganese sulfate** (5 g/L of water) mixed with 0.25% unslaked lime (2.5 g/L of water) or 0.25% urea (2.5 g/L of water).
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals. Soil application of manganese is generally not recommended in alkaline soils due to rapid fixation.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Soil Testing:** This is the cornerstone of effective micronutrient management. HAU recommends regular soil testing to determine specific nutrient levels and pH.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management:** Combine micronutrient applications with balanced use of macronutrients (N, P, K) and organic manures for sustainable soil health.
*   **Timing of Application:** Foliar sprays are best applied in the morning or late afternoon to avoid rapid drying and improve absorption.
*   **Water Quality:** Ensure the water used for spraying is of good quality and free from impurities that might affect nutrient availability.
*   **Adjuvants:** Spreading agents or stickers can be added to foliar sprays to improve coverage and absorption.

By following these scientifically verified recommendations, Barseem growers in Haryana can effectively manage micronutrient deficiencies and ensure healthy, productive fodder crops.
