As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for managing growth issues in Barseem (Trifolium alexandrinum) in Haryana.

### Management of Growth Issues in Barseem

**1. Slow Growth**

Slow growth in Barseem is often indicative of nutrient deficiencies, poor soil conditions, or inadequate water management.

*   **Causes:**
    *   Deficiency of macro-nutrients (Phosphorus, Potassium, Sulfur) or micro-nutrients (Zinc, Boron, Molybdenum).
    *   Poor soil structure, compaction, or low organic matter.
    *   Inadequate irrigation or water stress.
    *   Sub-optimal soil pH (Barseem prefers slightly acidic to neutral soils, pH 6.0-7.5).
    *   Low temperatures during early growth stages.

*   **Management Strategies:**
    *   **Soil Testing:** Conduct a comprehensive soil test to identify specific nutrient deficiencies and soil pH issues.
    *   **Nutrient Management:**
        *   **Phosphorus:** Apply **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** at 100-150 kg/acre at the time of sowing. Phosphorus is crucial for root development and overall plant vigor.
        *   **Potassium:** If soil test indicates deficiency, apply **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** at 20-30 kg/acre at sowing.
        *   **Sulfur:** Apply **Gypsum** at 100 kg/acre at sowing or **Elemental Sulfur** at 8-10 kg/acre. Sulfur is vital for protein synthesis and nodulation.
        *   **Zinc:** Apply **Zinc sulfate heptahydrate** at 10 kg/acre at sowing. Alternatively, for standing crop, a foliar spray of **Zinc sulfate heptahydrate** at 0.5% (5 g/L) solution can be applied.
        *   **Boron:** If deficiency is suspected, apply **Borax** at 2-4 kg/acre at sowing or a foliar spray of **Borax** at 0.1% (1 g/L) solution.
        *   **Molybdenum:** Essential for nitrogen fixation. Apply **Ammonium Molybdate** at 0.5 kg/acre at sowing or as a seed treatment.
    *   **Water Management:** Ensure timely and adequate irrigation, especially during dry spells.
    *   **Soil Health:** Incorporate organic matter (farmyard manure or compost) to improve soil structure and water retention.

**2. Yellow Growth (Chlorosis)**

Yellowing of Barseem leaves (chlorosis) can be due to various nutrient deficiencies or environmental stresses.

*   **Causes:**
    *   **Iron deficiency:** Interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves.
    *   **Sulfur deficiency:** General yellowing of younger leaves.
    *   **Manganese deficiency:** Similar to iron deficiency, interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves.
    *   **Nitrogen deficiency:** General yellowing, often starting from older leaves. (Less common in established Barseem due to nitrogen fixation, but can occur in early stages or if nodulation is poor).
    *   **Waterlogging:** Can damage roots and impair nutrient uptake, leading to yellowing.

*   **Management Strategies:**
    *   **Soil Testing:** Crucial to pinpoint the exact nutrient deficiency.
    *   **Nutrient Application (Foliar Sprays for quick correction):**
        *   **Iron deficiency:** Foliar spray of **Ferrous sulfate heptahydrate** at 0.5-1% (5-10 g/L) solution. Repeat after 10-15 days if needed.
        *   **Sulfur deficiency:** Foliar spray of **Elemental Sulfur** (wettable powder) at 2-3 g/L or soil application of **Gypsum** at 100 kg/acre.
        *   **Manganese deficiency:** Foliar spray of **Manganese sulfate monohydrate** at 0.5% (5 g/L) solution.
        *   **Nitrogen deficiency (if confirmed):** A light top-dressing of **Urea** at 10-15 kg/acre can be applied, but this is generally not required for Barseem.
    *   **Drainage:** Improve field drainage to prevent waterlogging, which can cause root damage and nutrient lockout.

**3. Excessive Height**

Excessive height in Barseem, often leading to lodging, is primarily a management issue related to harvesting and nutrient balance.

*   **Causes:**
    *   Delayed harvesting: If cuts are not taken at the appropriate time, Barseem will grow tall and may lodge.
    *   Excessive nitrogen application: While Barseem fixes its own nitrogen, very high initial nitrogen levels can promote lush vegetative growth and height.
    *   High plant density: Can lead to competition for light, causing plants to stretch.

*   **Management Strategies:**
    *   **Timely Harvesting:** This is the most effective method. Take the first cut at 45-50 days after sowing, and subsequent cuts every 25-30 days, or when the crop reaches an optimal height (typically 30-40 cm) before it starts to lodge.
    *   **Nitrogen Management:** Avoid excessive application of nitrogen fertilizers, especially after the initial establishment phase, as Barseem is a legume and fixes atmospheric nitrogen.
    *   **Optimal Sowing Density:** Adhere to recommended seed rates (20-25 kg/acre) to prevent overcrowding.

**4. Excessive Flowering**

Excessive or premature flowering in Barseem reduces its fodder quality and yield, as the plant diverts energy from vegetative growth to seed production.

*   **Causes:**
    *   **Delayed Harvesting:** The most common cause. If cuts are delayed, the plant naturally progresses to its reproductive stage.
    *   **Environmental Stress:** Severe drought, nutrient deficiencies, or extreme temperatures can sometimes induce premature flowering as a survival mechanism.
    *   **Variety Characteristics:** Some Barseem varieties may have a tendency to flower earlier than others.

*   **Management Strategies:**
    *   **Timely Harvesting:** This is the primary and most effective strategy. Harvest the crop before significant flowering begins to maintain high-quality fodder and promote subsequent vegetative regrowth.
    *   **Optimal Growing Conditions:** Ensure adequate irrigation and balanced nutrient supply to minimize stress, which can trigger premature flowering.
    *   **Variety Selection:** Choose Barseem varieties known for their prolonged vegetative growth and delayed flowering, which are ideal for multi-cut fodder production.

*Note: The use of plant growth regulators (PGRs) for height reduction or flowering suppression is generally not recommended for fodder crops like Barseem due to potential residue concerns and the effectiveness of cultural practices like timely harvesting.*
