As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with the scientifically verified advice regarding the maturity signs, harvesting time, and cutting process for Barseem (Egyptian Clover) in Haryana.

### Maturity Signs for Barseem

The primary indicators that Barseem is ready for cutting are:

*   **Plant Height:** The most reliable sign. Barseem is generally ready for harvest when it reaches a height of **40-50 cm**.
*   **Leaf Development:** The crop should have a dense canopy of lush, green leaves, indicating good vegetative growth.
*   **Early Flowering (for later cuts):** While the best fodder quality is obtained before extensive flowering, a few scattered flowers might appear, especially in later cuts. However, for optimal nutritional value and regeneration, cutting before significant flowering is preferred.

### Harvesting Time for Barseem

The timing of harvest is crucial for maximizing both yield and fodder quality:

*   **First Cut:** The initial cut is typically taken **50-60 days after sowing**. This allows the root system to establish well, ensuring robust regeneration for subsequent cuts.
*   **Subsequent Cuts:** Following the first cut, subsequent harvests can be taken at intervals of **25-30 days**. This interval may vary slightly depending on the variety, soil fertility, irrigation, and prevailing weather conditions.
*   **Total Cuts:** Under good management practices and favorable conditions in Haryana, you can expect to obtain **4-6 cuts** from a single sowing, extending from late November/December through April/May.
*   **Optimal Stage:** For the highest fodder yield and best nutritional quality (particularly protein content), Barseem should be harvested at the **pre-flowering or early flowering stage**. Harvesting at a very late stage (full bloom) significantly reduces fodder quality and can impair the plant's ability to regenerate effectively.

### Cutting Process for Barseem

The method and height of cutting are critical for ensuring good regrowth and sustained yields:

*   **Cutting Height:** It is essential to leave a stubble height of **5-7 cm** from the ground. Cutting too low can damage the crown of the plant, which is vital for regeneration, leading to reduced subsequent yields. Cutting too high leaves too much stem, which is less palatable and nutritious for livestock.
*   **Method:** Barseem can be harvested manually using a sickle or mechanically using a fodder harvester or mower.
*   **Care During Cutting:** Ensure that the cutting process does not damage the plant's crown, as this is the point from which new shoots emerge for regrowth.
*   **Post-Harvest Management:** A light irrigation immediately after cutting can significantly promote faster regrowth, especially during drier periods, and help maintain soil moisture.
