As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following fertilizer doses for Barseem (Trifolium alexandrinum) in Haryana. Please note that these are general recommendations; a soil test is always the most accurate way to determine specific nutrient requirements for your field. Barseem, being a legume, fixes atmospheric nitrogen, so its external nitrogen requirement is primarily a starter dose.

**General Nutrient Recommendations for Barseem (Basal Application at Sowing):**
*   **Nitrogen (N):** 20 kg/acre (starter dose)
*   **Phosphorus (P2O5):** 60 kg/acre
*   **Potassium (K2O):** 20-30 kg/acre (apply only if soil test indicates deficiency)
*   **Sulphur (S):** 8-10 kg/acre

Based on these nutrient requirements, here are the recommended doses for the specific fertilizers you inquired about:

*   **Urea (46% N):**
    *   For starter N: 40-45 kg/acre (if not using DAP or an NPK complex that provides sufficient N). Apply as a basal dose at sowing.
    *   *Note:* Additional Urea is generally not required for Barseem after establishment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability.

*   **Nano-Urea (Liquid, 4% N):**
    *   As a foliar spray: 2-4 ml/L of water.
    *   Apply 1-2 sprays after each cut (e.g., 200-400 ml per acre per spray, assuming 100-200 L water/acre spray volume). This is a supplementary dose for boosting regrowth.

*   **DAP (Di-ammonium Phosphate, 18% N, 46% P2O5):**
    *   130 kg/acre. Apply as a basal dose at sowing.
    *   *Note:* This dose provides approximately 23 kg N and 60 kg P2O5, covering both the starter N and the full P requirement. If using DAP, separate **Urea** for the starter dose may not be needed.

*   **Nano-DAP (Liquid, 8% N, 16% P2O5):**
    *   As a foliar spray: 2-4 ml/L of water.
    *   Apply 1-2 sprays after each cut (e.g., 200-400 ml per acre per spray, assuming 100-200 L water/acre spray volume). This is a supplementary dose for boosting regrowth and phosphorus uptake.

*   **NPK (Complex Fertilizers, e.g., 12:32:16 grade):**
    *   If using an NPK complex like 12:32:16: 180-190 kg/acre. Apply as a basal dose at sowing.
    *   *Note:* This dose would provide approximately 22 kg N, 60 kg P2O5, and 30 kg K2O, covering the N, P, and K requirements. The exact dose will vary based on the specific NPK grade.

*   **SSP (Single Super Phosphate, 16% P2O5, 11% S):**
    *   375 kg/acre. Apply as a basal dose at sowing.
    *   *Note:* This dose provides 60 kg P2O5 and approximately 41 kg S, fulfilling both the phosphorus and sulphur requirements. If using SSP, you would also need to apply **Urea** for the starter N and **Muriate of Potash** if K is deficient.

*   **Potash (Muriate of Potash, 60% K2O):**
    *   30-50 kg/acre. Apply as a basal dose at sowing, only if soil test indicates a deficiency.

*   **Sulphur (Bentonite Sulphur, 90% S):**
    *   9-11 kg/acre. Apply as a basal dose at sowing, if not adequately supplied by **SSP** or other fertilizers.
