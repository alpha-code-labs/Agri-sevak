Barseem (Egyptian clover) is **not typically transplanted**. It is almost universally cultivated by direct sowing due to its rapid growth, ease of establishment, and the large area usually dedicated to fodder crops, making transplantation economically unviable and unnecessary.

Therefore, instead of transplantation, the ideal practices for **direct sowing** of Barseem are as follows:

**1. Ideal Sowing Time:**
*   The optimal sowing period for Barseem in Haryana is from **mid-October to mid-November**.
*   Sowing outside this window can lead to reduced germination and fodder yield.

**2. Sowing Distance (for direct sowing):**
*   **Broadcasting:** This is the most common method. Seeds are uniformly broadcast over the prepared field. No specific row-to-row or plant-to-plant distance is maintained.
*   **Line Sowing (less common for fodder):** If line sowing is opted for, a row-to-row distance of **20-25 cm** can be maintained. Plant-to-plant distance is not typically managed as it's a dense fodder crop.

**3. Sowing Process (for direct sowing):**
*   **Land Preparation:** Prepare a fine, firm, and well-levelled seedbed. One deep ploughing followed by 2-3 harrowings is generally sufficient.
*   **Seed Treatment:** Treat the seeds with an appropriate **Rhizobium culture** specific for Barseem (Trifolium alexandrinum) to enhance nitrogen fixation. This is crucial for optimal growth and yield.
*   **Sowing Method:**
    *   **Broadcasting:** Mix the recommended seed rate (typically **20-25 kg/acre** for pure Barseem) with fine sand or soil to ensure even distribution. Broadcast the mixture evenly over the prepared field.
    *   **Line Sowing:** Sow seeds at a depth of **1-2 cm** in rows spaced **20-25 cm** apart.
*   **Covering Seeds:** Lightly cover the seeds with soil using a plank or light harrowing.
*   **First Irrigation:** Apply a light irrigation immediately after sowing to ensure good germination.
