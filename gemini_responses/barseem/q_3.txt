As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling various rot types in Barseem in Haryana:

**1. Root Rot, Stem Rot, Foot Rot, Collar Rot, Crown Rot, and Neck Rot**
These rot types are often caused by a complex of soil-borne fungal pathogens such as *Sclerotinia trifoliorum* (especially for crown/stem rot, also known as Clover Rot), *Rhizoctonia solani*, *Fusarium* spp., *Pythium* spp., and *Sclerotium rolfsii*. They manifest at different parts of the plant near or below the soil line, leading to wilting, yellowing, and eventual plant death.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Implement a strict 3-4 year rotation with non-host crops (e.g., cereals like wheat, barley) to reduce inoculum build-up, especially for *Sclerotinia*.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest.
    *   **Deep Ploughing:** Plough deeply after harvest to bury sclerotia of *Sclerotinia* and other fungal structures, reducing their viability.
    *   **Drainage:** Ensure good field drainage to prevent waterlogging, which favors many rot pathogens.
    *   **Balanced Nutrition:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can make plants more susceptible.
    *   **Optimum Sowing Time:** Sow at the recommended time to ensure vigorous growth and reduce stress.

*   **Biological Control:**
    *   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds with bio-agents before sowing.
        *   **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum**: 5-10 g/kg seed.
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum**: 2.5 kg/acre mixed with 50 kg farmyard manure (FYM) and applied at sowing or transplanting.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Seed Treatment (for early protection against root/collar/seedling rots):**
        *   **Carbendazim** 12% + **Mancozeb** 63% WP: 2.5 g/kg seed.
        *   **Thiram** 75% WS: 2.5 g/kg seed.
        *   **Metalaxyl** 35% WS: 2 g/kg seed (especially effective against *Pythium*).
    *   **Soil Drench/Foliar Spray (for established plants, if disease incidence is high):**
        *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: 500 g/acre in 200-400 L water, as a drench around the base of affected plants or as a foliar spray if symptoms are widespread.
        *   **Propiconazole** 25% EC: 200 ml/acre in 200-400 L water, as a foliar spray.
        *   **Hexaconazole** 5% SC: 400 ml/acre in 200-400 L water, as a foliar spray.
        *   **Validamycin** 3% L: 1 L/acre in 200-400 L water, as a drench or spray, particularly effective against *Rhizoctonia*.

**2. Black Rot**
This is not known to affect Barseem. Black rot is primarily a bacterial disease of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower).

**3. Fruit Rot**
This is not known to affect Barseem. Barseem is cultivated as a fodder crop, and fruit production is not its primary agricultural purpose.

**4. Seed Rot and Seedling Rot (Damping-off)**
These are common issues in Barseem, leading to poor germination and seedling mortality. They are caused by various soil-borne fungi, including *Pythium* spp., *Rhizoctonia solani*, and *Fusarium* spp.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Use Certified Seeds:** Always use healthy, disease-free seeds from reputable sources.
    *   **Optimal Sowing Depth:** Avoid deep sowing, which can delay emergence and increase susceptibility.
    *   **Proper Seedbed Preparation:** Ensure a well-drained, fine seedbed.
    *   **Avoid Overwatering:** Maintain appropriate soil moisture; excessive wetness favors pathogens.

*   **Biological Control:**
    *   **Seed Treatment:**
        *   **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum**: 5-10 g/kg seed.

*   **Chemical Control (Seed Treatment is crucial):**
    *   **Carbendazim** 12% + **Mancozeb** 63% WP: 2.5 g/kg seed.
    *   **Thiram** 75% WS: 2.5 g/kg seed.
    *   **Captan** 75% WS: 2.5 g/kg seed.
    *   **Metalaxyl** 35% WS: 2 g/kg seed (highly effective against *Pythium* causing damping-off).
