As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm that Scale insects and Mealybugs are **not known to affect Barseem** as significant pests requiring specific control measures in Haryana. These pests are generally not considered a common or economically damaging problem for Barseem cultivation.
