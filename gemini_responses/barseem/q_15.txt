As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in Barseem:

### Control of Pests in Barseem

**1. Grasshopper**
Grasshoppers can cause significant damage to Barseem, especially to young plants, by feeding on leaves and stems.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Deep ploughing after harvest can expose and destroy eggs laid in the soil.
    *   Encourage natural predators like birds by installing bird perches in the field.
*   **Chemical Control (Spot application for localized infestations or broadcast for widespread outbreaks):**
    *   **Malathion** 50% EC: 1.25 litres per acre in 500 litres of water.
    *   **Quinalphos** 25% EC: 1.0 litre per acre in 500 litres of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: 200-250 ml per acre in 200-400 litres of water.
    *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: 1.0 litre per acre in 500 litres of water.

**2. Painted bug**
This is not known to affect Barseem.

**3. Red cotton bug**
This is not known to affect Barseem.

**4. Black ants**
This is not known to affect Barseem as a direct pest causing significant damage. While ants may be present in fields, they typically do not feed on Barseem plants directly. If they are associated with other sap-sucking insects (like aphids) that produce honeydew, controlling the primary sap-sucker will indirectly manage the ant population.
