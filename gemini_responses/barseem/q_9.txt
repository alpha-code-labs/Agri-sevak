Mites, including Red Spider Mite (Tetranychus urticae) and Rust Mite (e.g., Aceria spp.), can affect Barseem, especially during dry and warm periods, leading to reduced fodder quality and yield. Effective management involves timely identification and appropriate control measures.

Here's how to control mites in Barseem:

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Regular Monitoring:** Frequently inspect the underside of leaves for mite presence (tiny dots, webbing for spider mites, bronzing/rusting for rust mites).
*   **Proper Irrigation:** Maintain adequate soil moisture, as water stress can exacerbate mite infestations. Overhead irrigation can sometimes help dislodge mites.
*   **Weed Management:** Control weeds in and around the Barseem field, as many weeds can serve as alternate hosts for mites.

**2. Chemical Control (Acaricides):**
When mite populations reach damaging levels, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the underside of leaves where mites reside.

*   **For Red Spider Mite and Rust Mite:**
    *   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP:** Apply **Wettable Sulphur** at a concentration of 2.5-3.0 g per litre of water (or 1.25-1.5 kg per acre in 500 litres of water). Sulphur is effective against both types of mites and is generally safe for fodder crops.
    *   **Propargite 57% EC:** Apply **Propargite** at a concentration of 1.5-2.0 ml per litre of water (or 750-1000 ml per acre in 500 litres of water). This is a dedicated acaricide effective against spider mites.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always observe the recommended Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) for any chemical applied to Barseem, as it is a fodder crop. This ensures the safety of animals consuming the fodder. Consult the product label for specific PHI information.
*   **Spray Coverage:** Mites are often found on the underside of leaves. Ensure thorough spray coverage for effective control.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate different classes of acaricides to prevent the development of resistance in mite populations.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) while handling and spraying pesticides. Follow all instructions and safety precautions mentioned on the product label.
*   **Consult Experts:** For severe or persistent infestations, it is advisable to consult with local agricultural extension officers or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions.
