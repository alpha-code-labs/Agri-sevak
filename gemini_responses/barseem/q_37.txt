Protecting Barseem (Egyptian Clover) from wild animals, particularly nilgai (blue bull), wild boar, and monkeys, is a significant challenge for farmers in Haryana. These animals can cause substantial damage through grazing and trampling, leading to significant crop loss. As a Senior Agronomist, I recommend the following integrated approaches, focusing on practical, scientifically sound, and sustainable methods:

1.  **Physical Barriers:**
    *   **Fencing:**
        *   **Barbed Wire Fencing:** A multi-strand barbed wire fence (typically 5-7 strands) can deter larger animals like nilgai and wild boar. Ensure the fence is taut and well-maintained.
        *   **Chain-link Fencing:** While more expensive, chain-link fencing is highly effective against a wider range of animals, including monkeys and smaller animals, providing a robust physical barrier.
        *   **Electric Fencing:** If legally permissible and safely installed with proper warning signs, a low-voltage electric fence can be very effective. Farmers must adhere to all safety regulations and obtain necessary permissions.
    *   **Trenching:** Digging a deep trench (e.g., 1-1.5 meters deep and 1 meter wide) around the field can deter wild boars and nilgai from entering, especially if combined with a small bund on the field side.

2.  **Cultural and Repellent Methods:**
    *   **Human Presence/Guarding:** Stationing a person to guard the field, especially during vulnerable periods (dawn, dusk, and night), is one of the most effective traditional methods.
    *   **Scare Devices:**
        *   **Scarecrows:** Regularly moving and changing the appearance of scarecrows can enhance their effectiveness.
        *   **Noise Makers:** Using drums, firecrackers (with caution and adherence to local regulations), or other noise-generating devices at irregular intervals can scare animals away.
        *   **Reflective Tapes/CDs:** Hanging reflective tapes or old CDs can create visual deterrents due to light reflection and movement.
    *   **Smell-based Repellents (Traditional):**
        *   **Cow Dung Slurry:** Spreading a mixture of cow dung and urine around the field perimeter can act as a deterrent due to its strong smell.
        *   **Chilli-Garlic Paste Spray:** A mixture of crushed chillies and garlic diluted in water can be sprayed around the field boundaries. This method requires frequent reapplication, especially after rain.

3.  **Community-Based Approaches:**
    *   **Cooperative Guarding:** Farmers in a village can collectively guard their fields, sharing the responsibility and resources, which is often more sustainable and effective.
    *   **Reporting to Forest Department:** Report persistent problems with wild animals to the local Forest Department for intervention, which may include trapping, relocation, or other management strategies as per government policy.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Integrated Approach:** Combining multiple methods (e.g., fencing with guarding) is usually more effective than relying on a single one.
*   **Regular Maintenance:** Fences and other deterrents require regular inspection and maintenance to remain effective.
*   **Local Regulations:** Always be aware of and adhere to local laws regarding fencing, use of scare devices, and interaction with wildlife.

**Regarding Chemical Repellents:**
There are no CIBRC approved technical chemical names specifically recommended or widely effective as repellents for large wild animals in fodder crops like Barseem in India. Therefore, the focus remains on physical and cultural methods.
