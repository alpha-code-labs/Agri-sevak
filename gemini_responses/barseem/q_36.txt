As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your query regarding Barseem (Trifolium alexandrinum). It is important to clarify that Barseem is a fodder crop, primarily grown for its green biomass (leaves and stems) for animal feed. It does not produce "fruit" in the conventional sense that would be consumed or stored for quality like horticultural fruits.

Therefore, I will interpret "Fruit quality" as **"Fodder Quality"** (referring to its nutritional value, protein content, and digestibility) and "Storage life" as the **"Preservation of Harvested Fodder"** (e.g., through silage or hay making).

Here is scientifically verified advice for improving yield, fodder quality, and preservation of harvested Barseem in Haryana:

**How to Improve Yield, Fodder Quality, and Preservation of Harvested Fodder for Barseem:**

**I. Improving Yield of Barseem:**

*   **Variety Selection:** Choose high-yielding, multi-cut varieties suitable for Haryana's agro-climatic conditions. Recommended varieties include Mescavi, Pusa Giant, Wardan, JHB-146, and JHB-191.
*   **Optimal Sowing Time:** Sow Barseem in the first fortnight of October for optimal growth and maximum number of cuts.
*   **Seed Rate and Sowing Method:**
    *   Use 20-25 kg/acre of pure seed.
    *   For mixed cropping with Mustard (Raya), use 16 kg Barseem + 2 kg Mustard per acre.
    *   Broadcasting followed by light planking is a common and effective sowing method.
*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Rhizobium Inoculation:** Treat seeds with a suitable **Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar trifolii** culture @ 250 g per 10-15 kg seed before sowing. This enhances nitrogen fixation, reducing the need for external nitrogen fertilizers.
    *   **Phosphorus (P):** Barseem has a high requirement for phosphorus. Apply 24 kg P2O5 per acre (equivalent to 150 kg **Single Super Phosphate** or 52 kg **Di-ammonium Phosphate** per acre) at the time of sowing.
    *   **Potassium (K):** If soil test indicates deficiency, apply 8 kg K2O per acre (equivalent to 13 kg **Muriate of Potash** per acre) at sowing.
    *   **Sulphur (S):** Apply 8 kg Sulphur per acre (e.g., through **Single Super Phosphate** or **elemental Sulphur**) for improved protein synthesis and overall yield.
    *   **Zinc (Zn):** If soil test indicates deficiency, apply 10 kg **Zinc Sulphate heptahydrate** per acre once every 2-3 years.
*   **Water Management:**
    *   Provide a light irrigation immediately after sowing to ensure good germination.
    *   Subsequent irrigations should be given after each cut, or as needed, typically every 15-20 days depending on soil type and weather conditions.
*   **Weed Management:**
    *   Manual weeding is often preferred, especially in the early stages, as Barseem is sensitive to many herbicides.
    *   For broadleaf weeds, **Imazethapyr** @ 400 ml/acre can be applied as a post-emergence spray. However, always consult local agricultural experts for specific recommendations and timing to avoid crop injury.
*   **Cutting Management:**
    *   Take the first cut 50-60 days after sowing.
    *   Subsequent cuts can be taken at intervals of 25-30 days.
    *   Leave a stubble height of 5-7 cm to ensure vigorous regeneration and subsequent yields.

**II. Improving Fodder Quality of Barseem (Interpreted from "Fruit Quality"):**

*   **Variety Selection:** Choose varieties specifically known for higher crude protein content, digestibility, and palatability.
*   **Optimal Cutting Stage:** Harvest Barseem at the pre-flowering or early flowering stage (when about 25-50% of plants are in flower). Harvesting at this stage ensures maximum protein content, digestibility, and palatability, while still allowing for good regeneration. Delaying cuts significantly reduces fodder quality.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Adequate supply of Phosphorus, Sulphur, and essential micronutrients (especially Zinc and Boron if deficient) is crucial for better protein synthesis and overall nutritional quality of the fodder.
*   **Pest and Disease Management:** Healthy, stress-free plants produce higher quality fodder. Implement integrated pest and disease management practices to minimize damage and maintain plant vigor.

**III. Improving Preservation of Harvested Fodder (Interpreted from "Storage Life"):**

Barseem fodder, being high in moisture, needs proper preservation methods to extend its usability and prevent spoilage, especially during periods of surplus.

*   **Silage Making:** This is an excellent method for preserving Barseem, converting it into a palatable and nutritious feed.
    *   **Wilting:** Barseem should be wilted in the field for a few hours to reduce its moisture content to 65-70% before ensiling. This helps in better fermentation and reduces effluent loss.
    *   **Chop Length:** Chop the wilted fodder into small pieces (1-2 cm) for better compaction and removal of air.
    *   **Compaction:** Pack the chopped fodder tightly into a silo pit, bunker, or bags to remove as much air as possible.
    *   **Sealing:** Seal the silo completely and airtight to create anaerobic conditions, which are essential for proper fermentation.
    *   **Additives (Optional):**
        *   **Molasses:** Can be added at 2-4% (20-40 kg per tonne of green fodder) to provide readily fermentable carbohydrates for lactic acid bacteria, especially if Barseem is ensiled alone.
        *   **Bacterial Inoculants:** Commercial inoculants containing **Lactobacillus plantarum** or other lactic acid bacteria can be used to promote rapid and efficient fermentation. Follow manufacturer's instructions for application rate (e.g., 1-2 g/tonne of fodder, mixed with water).
*   **Hay Making:** While challenging due to Barseem's high moisture content and potential for leaf shattering, good quality hay can be made.
    *   **Drying:** Spread the cut Barseem in thin layers in the field to dry. Turn it frequently to ensure uniform drying.
    *   **Avoid Over-drying:** Over-drying leads to significant leaf shattering, which reduces the nutritional value of the hay.
    *   **Storage:** Store hay in a dry, well-ventilated place once its moisture content is below 15% to prevent mold growth.
