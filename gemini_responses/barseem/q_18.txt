As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the use of growth regulators and Boron in Barseem for Haryana conditions:

*   **Ethrel (Ethephon)**
    As a growth regulator for enhancing yield or quality in Barseem, **Ethephon** is not known to be recommended. Its primary action involves ethylene release, which is generally associated with ripening, senescence, or stress responses, and is not typically beneficial for increasing biomass or forage quality in Barseem.

*   **2,4-D (2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid)**
    As a growth regulator for Barseem, **2,4-D (2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid)** is not known to be recommended. In fact, **2,4-D** is a selective broadleaf herbicide and its application would severely damage or kill Barseem, which is a broadleaf legume.

*   **Boron**
    Boron is an essential micronutrient for Barseem, crucial for cell wall formation, sugar transport, flowering, and seed development. Its application is recommended, especially in soils deficient in Boron.

    *   **Recommended Dose (Foliar Application):**
        *   Apply 200-250 g/acre of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (e.g., Solubor) dissolved in 200-250 L of water. This provides approximately 0.1% Boron solution.
        *   Alternatively, apply 400-500 g/acre of **Sodium tetraborate decahydrate** (e.g., Borax) dissolved in 200-250 L of water. This provides approximately 0.2% Boron solution.
    *   **Timing:**
        *   The first application can be done at the vegetative stage, approximately 20-30 days after sowing.
        *   Subsequent applications can be considered after each cut if deficiency symptoms are observed or if soil tests indicate persistent low Boron levels.
