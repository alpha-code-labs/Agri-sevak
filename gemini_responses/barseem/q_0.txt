As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Barseem (Trifolium alexandrinum) in Haryana.

**General Cultural Practices for Fungal Disease Management in Barseem:**
*   Use disease-free, certified seeds from reputable sources.
*   Maintain proper field sanitation by removing and destroying infected crop debris.
*   Ensure optimal plant spacing to promote good air circulation within the canopy.
*   Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush, susceptible growth.
*   Practice crop rotation with non-leguminous crops to break disease cycles.
*   Irrigate judiciously, preferably in the morning, to allow foliage to dry quickly, reducing humidity around plants.

**Specific Disease Control Measures:**

1.  **Alternaria Leaf Spot (Alternaria spp.)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Small, dark, circular spots on leaves, often with concentric rings (target-spot appearance). Severe infection can lead to defoliation.
    *   **Control (Foliar Spray):**
        *   **Mancozeb** at 2.0 kg/acre (dissolved in 500-600 L of water).
        *   **Chlorothalonil** at 1.0 kg/acre (dissolved in 500-600 L of water).
        *   **Propiconazole** at 250 ml/acre (dissolved in 500-600 L of water).

2.  **Anthracnose (Colletotrichum trifolii)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Irregular, sunken, dark lesions on stems, leaves, and petioles, often with pinkish spore masses in humid conditions. Can cause wilting, girdling of stems, and plant death.
    *   **Control (Foliar Spray):**
        *   **Carbendazim** at 200 g/acre (dissolved in 500-600 L of water).
        *   **Mancozeb** at 2.0 kg/acre (dissolved in 500-600 L of water).
        *   **Azoxystrobin** at 200 ml/acre (dissolved in 500-600 L of water).

3.  **Blast:**
    *   This is not known to affect Barseem.

4.  **Blight (e.g., Rhizoctonia Blight, Sclerotinia Blight)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Water-soaked lesions on stems and leaves, leading to wilting, rotting, and collapse of plants, especially at the crown level. White mycelial growth or black sclerotia may be visible in severe cases.
    *   **Control (Foliar Spray/Drench):**
        *   **Cultural:** Improve drainage, avoid dense planting, and remove infected plants.
        *   **Chemical Control:**
            *   **Carbendazim** at 200 g/acre (dissolved in 500-600 L of water, can be used as a drench for crown rot).
            *   **Propiconazole** at 250 ml/acre (dissolved in 500-600 L of water).
            *   **Tebuconazole** at 250 ml/acre (dissolved in 500-600 L of water).

5.  **Brown Spot:**
    *   This is not known to affect Barseem.

6.  **Downy Mildew (Peronospora trifoliorum)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Yellowish-green spots on the upper leaf surface, with a grayish-purple, fuzzy growth on the corresponding lower surface. Infected leaves may become distorted and stunted.
    *   **Control (Foliar Spray):**
        *   **Cultural:** Use resistant varieties if available, ensure good air circulation.
        *   **Chemical Control:**
            *   **Mancozeb** at 2.0 kg/acre (dissolved in 500-600 L of water).
            *   **Metalaxyl + Mancozeb** (combination product) at 1.0 kg/acre (dissolved in 500-600 L of water).

7.  **Powdery Mildew (Erysiphe trifolii)**
    *   **Symptoms:** White, powdery patches on the upper and lower surfaces of leaves, stems, and petioles. Infected leaves may turn yellow, become distorted, and drop prematurely.
    *   **Control (Foliar Spray):**
        *   **Cultural:** Remove severely infected plant parts, ensure good air circulation.
        *   **Chemical Control:**
            *   **Wettable Sulphur** at 2.0 kg/acre (dissolved in 500-600 L of water).
            *   **Hexaconazole** at 250 ml/acre (dissolved in 500-600 L of water).
            *   **Myclobutanil** at 200 ml/acre (dissolved in 500-600 L of water).
            *   **Penconazole** at 100 ml/acre (dissolved in 500-600 L of water).

8.  **Grey Mildew:**
    *   This is not known to affect Barseem.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and strictly follow the label instructions of any pesticide product, including dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI), especially for fodder crops.
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of fungicide resistance.
*   For specific local recommendations and to confirm the exact disease, it is always advisable to consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts.
