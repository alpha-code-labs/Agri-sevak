As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified strategies for controlling soil pests like termites and nematodes (root-knot) in Barseem in Haryana:

### I. Termite Control in Barseem

Termites can cause significant damage by feeding on roots and stems, leading to wilting and reduced plant stand.

**A. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Deep Summer Ploughing:** Expose termite colonies to the sun and predators by deep ploughing during the hot summer months.
*   **Removal of Crop Residues:** Clear the field of old stubble, wood, and other organic debris that can serve as food sources or shelter for termites.
*   **Proper Irrigation:** Maintain adequate soil moisture, as termites prefer dry soil conditions. Avoid water stress in the crop.

**B. Chemical Control (Pre-sowing/At sowing):**
For effective control, chemical application should be done before or at the time of sowing.
*   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC**: Apply 2.5-3.0 litres per acre. Mix the required quantity of **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** with 50-100 kg of sand or dry soil and broadcast evenly over the field before the last ploughing, then incorporate it into the soil. Alternatively, it can be applied as a soil drench at the time of sowing.
*   **Fipronil 0.3% GR**: Apply 8-10 kg per acre. Broadcast **Fipronil 0.3% GR** granules evenly over the field at the time of sowing and mix them thoroughly into the soil.

### II. Nematode (Root-knot) Control in Barseem

Root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.) cause galls or knots on the roots, impairing nutrient and water uptake, leading to stunted growth, yellowing, and reduced fodder yield.

**A. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate Barseem with non-host crops such as cereals (wheat, maize, sorghum) or marigold. This helps break the nematode life cycle and reduces their population in the soil.
*   **Summer Ploughing:** Deep ploughing during the hot summer months exposes nematode eggs and larvae to high temperatures and desiccation, significantly reducing their populations.
*   **Solarization:** Covering the moist soil with transparent polythene sheets for 4-6 weeks during peak summer can raise soil temperatures to lethal levels for nematodes.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** If available and suitable for cultivation in Haryana, consider using Barseem varieties known to be resistant or tolerant to root-knot nematodes.

**B. Organic Amendments:**
*   **Neem Cake:** Incorporate **Neem cake** at 200-400 kg per acre into the soil 2-3 weeks before sowing. Neem cake releases compounds that have nematicidal properties and also promotes beneficial soil microorganisms that can suppress nematode populations.

**C. Chemical Control:**
*   As a Senior Agronomist, it is important to emphasize that due to the nature of Barseem as a fodder crop, the use of synthetic chemical nematicides is generally discouraged to avoid residues in animal feed. Therefore, emphasis is placed on cultural and organic methods for nematode management to ensure the safety and quality of the fodder.
