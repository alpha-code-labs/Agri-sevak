As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling sucking pests in Barseem (Egyptian clover) in Haryana.

Sucking pests like aphids, leafhoppers, whiteflies, and thrips can significantly impact Barseem yield and quality by feeding on plant sap, causing direct damage, and potentially transmitting viral diseases. Effective and timely management is crucial.

**Psylla:**
This is not known to be a significant pest of Barseem (Egyptian clover) in Haryana.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Sucking Pests in Barseem:**
A holistic approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods is recommended for sustainable pest management.

1.  **Regular Monitoring:**
    *   Regularly inspect Barseem fields, especially the undersides of leaves and tender shoots, to detect pest infestations early. Early detection allows for timely intervention and prevents widespread damage.

2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Maintain Crop Health:** Ensure optimal plant vigour through balanced fertilization and adequate irrigation. Healthy plants are more tolerant to pest damage.
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the field free of weeds, as many weeds can serve as alternate hosts for sucking pests.

3.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Encourage natural enemies such as ladybird beetles, lacewings, and parasitic wasps, which are effective predators and parasitoids of aphids and whiteflies. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides if natural enemy populations are high.

**Chemical Control (When Necessary):**
If pest populations reach economic threshold levels and biological control is insufficient, chemical intervention may be required. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance. Apply insecticides preferably in the evening or early morning.

*   **For Aphids, Leafhoppers, and Whiteflies:**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL**: Apply at 125-150 ml per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water.
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP**: Apply at 80-100 g per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water.
    *   **Dimethoate 30% EC**: Apply at 250-300 ml per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water.

*   **For Thrips (if predominant or in combination with other sucking pests):**
    *   **Fipronil 5% SC**: Apply at 400-600 ml per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Label Instructions:** Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the insecticide label, including dosage, application method, and any specified pre-harvest interval (PHI) for fodder crops.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage, especially the undersides of leaves where many sucking pests reside.
*   **Safety:** Use appropriate personal protective equipment (gloves, mask, protective clothing) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate insecticides with different modes of action (chemical groups) to prevent the development of pesticide resistance in pest populations.
