Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I understand your concern regarding wilt and parawilt in Barseem. These conditions can significantly impact fodder yield and quality. It's important to adopt an integrated approach for effective management.

Wilt in Barseem is primarily caused by soil-borne fungal pathogens like *Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. trifolii* or *Sclerotinia trifoliorum* (Sclerotinia rot, which causes wilting). Parawilt, on the other hand, is often a physiological condition not directly caused by a pathogen, but rather by sudden environmental stress, root damage, or nutrient imbalances.

Here's how to control these conditions in Barseem:

**I. Integrated Management for Wilt (Fungal Pathogens):**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid continuous cultivation of Barseem or other susceptible legumes in the same field. Rotate with non-host crops like cereals (wheat, maize) for at least 2-3 years to break the disease cycle.
    *   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available and suitable for Haryana conditions, select Barseem varieties known for their tolerance or resistance to wilt.
    *   **Soil Health Management:**
        *   Improve soil drainage to prevent waterlogging, which favors fungal growth.
        *   Maintain optimal soil pH (6.0-7.0) and fertility.
        *   Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost to enhance soil microbial activity and suppress pathogens.
    *   **Timely Sowing:** Sow Barseem at the recommended time to ensure vigorous plant growth, making them less susceptible to early infections.
    *   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris from the field to reduce inoculum sources.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds with bio-control agents before sowing.
        *   **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum**: Apply 5-10 g per kg of seed. These fungi colonize the root zone and suppress pathogenic fungi.
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum**: Mix 2.5 kg of the formulation with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed FYM or compost and apply uniformly per acre before sowing or at the time of last ploughing.

3.  **Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved):**
    *   **Seed Treatment (Most Effective for Wilt Prevention):**
        *   **Carbendazim**: Treat seeds at 1-2 g per kg of seed.
        *   **Thiram**: Treat seeds at 2-3 g per kg of seed. Often used in combination with Carbendazim or alone.
        *   **Carboxin + Thiram**: A combination product can be used as per manufacturer's recommendations, typically 2-3 g per kg of seed.
    *   **Soil Drench (for localized outbreaks):**
        *   **Carbendazim**: In case of early localized wilting, drench the soil around the affected plants with a 0.1% solution (1 g per litre of water). This is generally not practical for large areas.

**II. Management for Parawilt (Physiological Wilt):**

Parawilt is often a symptom of stress rather than a direct disease. Management focuses on alleviating these stresses:

1.  **Proper Irrigation Management:**
    *   Avoid both excessive irrigation (leading to waterlogging and root asphyxiation) and severe drought stress.
    *   Provide light and frequent irrigations, especially during critical growth stages and hot periods, to maintain adequate soil moisture.
    *   Ensure good drainage to prevent water stagnation.

2.  **Balanced Nutrition:**
    *   Ensure adequate and balanced supply of essential nutrients. Deficiencies or excesses can stress plants.
    *   Conduct soil testing to determine nutrient status and apply fertilizers as per recommendations for Barseem.

3.  **Soil Aeration:**
    *   Avoid soil compaction, which can restrict root growth and oxygen availability.
    *   Ensure good soil structure through proper tillage and organic matter addition.

4.  **Avoid Root Damage:**
    *   Be careful during inter-cultivation practices to avoid mechanical damage to the roots, which can lead to wilting.

By implementing these integrated strategies, you can effectively manage both fungal wilt and physiological parawilt in your Barseem crop, ensuring healthy growth and optimal fodder production.
