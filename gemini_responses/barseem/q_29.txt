As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I must clarify that "Flower drop, Fruit drop, and Tinda/Boll dropping" are generally not considered significant issues or known conditions affecting Barseem (Trifolium alexandrinum) in a manner that requires specific control measures.

Barseem is primarily cultivated as a multi-cut fodder crop, where the vegetative parts (leaves and stems) are harvested for animal feed. While Barseem does flower and produce seeds, the dropping of flowers or fruits (which are small pods in legumes, not "fruits" in the common sense) is not typically a concern for fodder yield. "Tinda" is a type of gourd, and "Boll" is associated with cotton, neither of which is related to Barseem.

Therefore, this is not known to affect Barseem in a way that necessitates control.
