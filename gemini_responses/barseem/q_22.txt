As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), here are the recommended cultivation practices for Barseem (Egyptian Clover) in Haryana:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   Barseem can be sown by broadcasting or in lines. Line sowing is generally preferred as it allows for better inter-cultivation and management.
    *   Often, Barseem is sown as a pure crop, but it can also be intercropped with a quick-growing fodder crop like Mustard (Raya) or Oats in the initial stage to get an early first cut.
    *   For line sowing, a seed drill can be used.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   Barseem seeds are small, so shallow planting is crucial for good germination and emergence.
    *   The ideal planting depth is **1-2 cm**.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   When sown in lines, a row-to-row spacing of **20-25 cm** is recommended.
    *   Plant-to-plant spacing is not typically managed for Barseem as it forms a dense stand.

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   For a pure stand of Barseem, the recommended seed dose is **20-25 kg/acre**.
    *   If intercropped with Mustard (for an early first cut), use **20 kg/acre** of Barseem seed along with **1-1.5 kg/acre** of Mustard seed.
    *   If intercropped with Oats, use **15-20 kg/acre** of Barseem seed along with **20-25 kg/acre** of Oats seed.
    *   It is highly recommended to treat the seeds with an appropriate Rhizobium culture specific to Barseem before sowing to enhance nitrogen fixation.
