As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for managing physical damage in Pear cultivation in Haryana:

### Control of Physical Damage in Pear

**1. Fruit Bursting (Cracking)**

Fruit bursting is primarily a physiological disorder often caused by sudden fluctuations in soil moisture (e.g., a dry spell followed by heavy rain or irrigation), leading to rapid water uptake and internal pressure that the fruit skin cannot withstand. Nutrient deficiencies can also contribute.

*   **Irrigation Management:**
    *   Maintain consistent and uniform soil moisture throughout the fruit development period. Avoid extremes of drought followed by sudden heavy irrigation.
    *   Use drip irrigation to deliver water precisely and consistently, minimizing fluctuations.
*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Ensure adequate supply of Calcium and Boron, which are crucial for cell wall integrity and elasticity.
    *   **Foliar application of Calcium:**
        *   Apply **Calcium chloride** at 0.5-1.0% (5-10 g/L of water) or **Calcium nitrate** at 0.5-1.0% (5-10 g/L of water) starting from fruit set and repeating every 10-15 days, 3-4 times.
    *   **Foliar application of Boron:**
        *   Apply **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** at 0.1-0.2% (1-2 g/L of water) at pre-bloom and fruit set stages.
*   **Mulching:**
    *   Apply organic mulch (e.g., straw, crop residues) around the base of trees to conserve soil moisture, regulate soil temperature, and reduce moisture fluctuations.
*   **Variety Selection:**
    *   Choose pear varieties known to be less susceptible to fruit cracking.

**2. Leaf Burning/Melting**

Leaf burning or melting is typically a symptom of abiotic stress, such as heat stress, water stress, chemical phytotoxicity, or salinity.

*   **Water Management:**
    *   Ensure adequate and timely irrigation, especially during hot and dry periods, to prevent water stress.
    *   Avoid waterlogging, which can damage roots and lead to similar symptoms.
*   **Shade and Protection:**
    *   Consider using shade nets (e.g., 30-50% shade) during peak summer months (May-June) to reduce intense solar radiation and high temperatures, especially for young trees or sensitive varieties.
    *   Plant windbreaks to reduce hot, dry winds that can exacerbate desiccation.
*   **Proper Chemical Application:**
    *   Strictly follow label instructions for all pesticides, herbicides, and foliar fertilizers.
    *   Avoid spraying during high temperatures (above 30°C) or strong sunlight, as this increases the risk of phytotoxicity.
    *   Ensure correct dilution rates and proper sprayer calibration.
*   **Nutrient Balance:**
    *   Conduct regular soil and leaf tissue analysis to identify and correct any nutrient deficiencies or toxicities.
*   **Salinity Management:**
    *   If irrigation water or soil has high salinity, use good quality water for irrigation if possible.
    *   Improve soil drainage to leach salts from the root zone.

**3. Hardness in Fruit**

Pears are climacteric fruits, meaning they ripen after harvest. "Hardness" in fruit usually relates to improper harvest maturity or inadequate post-harvest ripening conditions.

*   **Optimal Harvest Maturity:**
    *   Harvest pears at the correct physiological maturity stage, not too early. Indicators include slight change in ground color from green to yellowish-green, ease of stem separation, and specific firmness measurements (using a penetrometer). Harvesting too early will result in fruits that fail to ripen properly and remain hard.
*   **Proper Post-Harvest Handling and Ripening:**
    *   **Chilling Requirement:** Many pear varieties require a period of chilling (e.g., 0-4°C for 1-6 weeks, depending on variety) after harvest to initiate the ripening process. Without adequate chilling, fruits may remain hard or ripen unevenly.
    *   **Ripening Conditions:** After chilling, move fruits to a ripening room at ambient temperatures (18-24°C) with high humidity (90-95%).
    *   **Ethylene Application:** To promote uniform ripening and softening, expose pears to exogenous ethylene gas.
        *   **Ethephon** (an ethylene-releasing compound) can be used as a post-harvest dip or spray at recommended concentrations (e.g., 500-1000 ppm or 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water, depending on product concentration and variety) to accelerate ripening.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:**
    *   Ensure balanced nutrition throughout the growing season, particularly adequate Potassium, which plays a role in fruit development and quality.
*   **Variety Selection:**
    *   Choose pear varieties known for their good ripening characteristics and desirable texture.
