As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Pear cultivation in Haryana:

It is crucial to correctly identify the pest before applying any control measures. Always follow label instructions for any pesticide and observe pre-harvest intervals (PHI).

### 1. Borers

Borers can cause significant damage by tunneling into the bark, wood, or fruit of pear trees.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Maintain tree health and vigor through proper nutrition and irrigation, as stressed trees are more susceptible.
    *   Prune and destroy infested branches showing signs of borer activity (e.g., sawdust-like frass, gumming).
    *   Scrape off loose bark to remove overwintering larvae.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   For stem/trunk borers, drenching or painting the affected parts with systemic insecticides is effective.
        *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20 EC: Mix 2.5 ml/L of water and drench around the tree base or paint on affected trunk areas.
        *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8 SL: Mix 0.5 ml/L of water and drench around the tree base for systemic action.

### 2. Caterpillars (Defoliating)

Various species of caterpillars can feed on pear leaves, leading to defoliation.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Regularly inspect trees for egg masses or young larvae and remove them manually.
    *   Prune and destroy branches with webbed nests (e.g., tent caterpillars, fall webworms).
*   **Biological Control:**
    *   **Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)** (e.g., *kurstaki* strain): Mix 1-2 g/L of water. Apply when caterpillars are young for best results.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5 SC: Mix 0.3 ml/L of water (approx. 60 ml/acre in 200 L water).
    *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5 SG: Mix 0.2 g/L of water (approx. 40 g/acre in 200 L water).
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5 EC: Mix 0.5 ml/L of water (approx. 100 ml/acre in 200 L water).
    *   **Flubendiamide** 20 WG: Mix 0.25 g/L of water (approx. 50 g/acre in 200 L water).

### 3. Diamondback Moth

This is not known to affect Pear. Diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) is primarily a pest of cruciferous vegetables.

### 4. Leaf Folder

Leaf folders roll or fold leaves and feed from within, causing damage to foliage and sometimes young fruits.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Regularly monitor trees for folded leaves.
    *   Prune and destroy infested leaves or twigs to reduce pest population.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5 SC: Mix 0.3 ml/L of water (approx. 60 ml/acre in 200 L water).
    *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5 SG: Mix 0.2 g/L of water (approx. 40 g/acre in 200 L water).
    *   **Indoxacarb** 14.5 SC: Mix 0.5 ml/L of water (approx. 100 ml/acre in 200 L water).
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5 EC: Mix 0.5 ml/L of water (approx. 100 ml/acre in 200 L water).

**General Advisory:**

*   Always practice Integrated Pest Management (IPM) by combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods.
*   Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the underside of leaves.
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) while handling and applying pesticides.
*   Consult your local agricultural extension office for the most current and specific recommendations for your region and specific pear varieties.
