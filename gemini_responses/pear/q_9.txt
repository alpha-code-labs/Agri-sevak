Mites, including Red Spider Mite (*Tetranychus urticae*) and Rust Mite (*Aculus schlechtendali*), are significant pests of Pear in Haryana. Effective management requires an integrated approach combining cultural practices and judicious use of CIBRC approved acaricides.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategy:**

1.  **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect the underside of leaves, especially during dry and warm periods, for the presence of mites, their eggs, webbing (Red Spider Mite), or the characteristic bronzing/russeting of leaves (Rust Mite). A hand lens can aid in early detection.
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Water Management:** Ensure adequate irrigation, as water-stressed trees are more susceptible to mite infestations.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can promote lush, succulent growth favored by mites.
    *   **Weed Control:** Keep the orchard floor free of weeds, as many weeds can serve as alternate hosts for mites.
    *   **Pruning:** Proper pruning improves air circulation and light penetration, which can reduce mite populations.
3.  **Biological Control:** Conserve natural enemies such as predatory mites (*Amblyseius* spp.), ladybird beetles, and lacewings by minimizing the use of broad-spectrum insecticides.

**Chemical Control (Acaricides):**

When mite populations reach economic threshold levels, chemical intervention becomes necessary. It is crucial to rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Always ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the underside of leaves where mites primarily reside.

Here are some CIBRC approved acaricides effective against mites in Pear:

*   **For both Red Spider Mite and Rust Mite:**
    *   **Abamectin 1.8% EC:** Apply at 0.3-0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP:** Apply at 2.0-3.0 grams per litre of water. (Note: Avoid application when temperatures are above 30°C to prevent phytotoxicity).
*   **Primarily for Red Spider Mite:**
    *   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** Apply at 0.5-0.75 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Fenpyroximate 5% EC:** Apply at 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Propargite 57% EC:** Apply at 1.0-1.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Fenazaquin 10% EC:** Apply at 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Hexythiazox 5.45% EC:** Apply at 0.5 ml per litre of water. (Acts as an ovicide and larvicide, effective against early stages).

**Application Guidelines:**

*   **Timing:** Apply acaricides when mite populations begin to build up, typically from late spring through summer. Repeat applications may be necessary based on pest pressure and product residual activity, strictly adhering to label instructions.
*   **Rotation:** Rotate between different chemical groups (modes of action) to prevent resistance development. For example, do not use Abamectin repeatedly; alternate with Spiromesifen or Fenpyroximate.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure complete and uniform coverage of the foliage, particularly the undersides of leaves.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and application. Follow all safety instructions and observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) mentioned on the product label to ensure food safety.
