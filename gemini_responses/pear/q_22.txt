As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide the recommended cultivation practices for Pear in Haryana. Pear is primarily propagated vegetatively, not by seed, for commercial fruit production.

Here are the recommended practices:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   Pear is propagated through grafting (budding or whip-and-tongue grafting) onto suitable rootstocks (e.g., *Pyrus pashia* (Kainth), *Pyrus communis* seedlings, or dwarfing quince rootstocks with an interstock if needed).
    *   Grafted saplings (one-year-old plants) are planted in the orchard.
    *   The most common planting patterns are the **Square system** or **Rectangular system**, which facilitate inter-cultivation operations.
    *   Pits of 1 m x 1 m x 1 m size should be dug well in advance (1-2 months before planting) and filled with a mixture of topsoil, 20-25 kg farmyard manure (FYM), and 1 kg **Single Super Phosphate**.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   The grafted sapling should be planted at the same depth it was in the nursery.
    *   Crucially, the **graft union must remain 15-20 cm above the soil surface** to prevent scion rooting and maintain the desired rootstock effect.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   Spacing depends on the vigor of the rootstock, the scion variety, and the training system adopted.
    *   For vigorous rootstocks (like *Pyrus pashia* or *Pyrus communis* seedlings) and standard training systems (e.g., Modified Leader):
        *   **8 meters x 8 meters** (approximately 156 plants per acre)
        *   **7 meters x 7 meters** (approximately 200 plants per acre)
    *   For semi-vigorous rootstocks or high-density planting with appropriate training:
        *   **6 meters x 6 meters** (approximately 277 plants per acre)
    *   For dwarfing rootstocks (e.g., Quince A or C with interstock) and high-density planting:
        *   **4 meters x 4 meters** (approximately 625 plants per acre) or even closer, depending on the specific system.

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   This is not applicable for commercial pear cultivation as pear is propagated vegetatively (grafting) using saplings, not by direct seed sowing for fruit production. Seeds are primarily used for raising rootstock seedlings, not for the fruit-bearing scion variety itself.
