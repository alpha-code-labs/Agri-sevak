As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for managing growth issues in Pear in Haryana:

It is crucial to first identify the specific cause of the growth issue through careful observation, soil testing, and potentially leaf tissue analysis. General cultural practices are fundamental, and chemical interventions should be used judiciously and strictly according to label instructions.

### 1. Slow Growth

Slow growth in pear trees can be indicative of various underlying issues, including nutrient deficiencies, water stress, soil compaction, root problems, or pest/disease pressure.

*   **Diagnosis:**
    *   Conduct a comprehensive soil test to determine nutrient levels and soil pH.
    *   Observe root health for signs of disease or nematode damage.
    *   Assess irrigation practices to ensure adequate, but not excessive, water supply.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Based on soil test recommendations.
        *   **Nitrogen (N):** Apply **Urea** (46% N) or **Di-ammonium Phosphate** (DAP, 18% N, 46% P2O5) as per soil test. For mature trees, typically 200-300 g N/tree/year in split doses (e.g., pre-bloom and post-harvest).
        *   **Phosphorus (P):** Apply **Di-ammonium Phosphate** (DAP) or Single Super Phosphate (SSP) as per soil test.
        *   **Potassium (K):** Apply **Muriate of Potash** (MOP, 60% K2O) or **Sulphate of Potash** (SOP, 50% K2O) as per soil test.
        *   **Micronutrients:** If deficiencies are identified, foliar sprays are often effective.
            *   **Zinc:** Foliar spray of **Zinc Sulphate** (21%) at 0.5% (5 g/L).
            *   **Iron:** Foliar spray of **Ferrous Sulphate** (19%) at 0.5% (5 g/L).
            *   **Boron:** Foliar spray of **Borax** (10.5%) at 0.1% (1 g/L).
    *   **Water Management:** Ensure consistent and adequate irrigation, especially during dry periods. Avoid waterlogging. Drip irrigation is highly recommended for efficient water use.
    *   **Soil Health:** Improve soil structure and aeration by incorporating organic matter (farmyard manure, compost) and avoiding compaction. Mulching around the tree base helps conserve moisture and regulate soil temperature.
    *   **Pest and Disease Control:** Address any specific pest or disease issues (e.g., root-knot nematodes, collar rot) that might be impacting root function or overall tree vigor.
    *   **Pruning:** Light pruning to remove dead, diseased, or crossing branches can redirect energy to healthy growth.

### 2. Yellow Growth (Chlorosis)

Yellowing of leaves (chlorosis) indicates a lack of chlorophyll, often due to nutrient deficiencies, high soil pH, or poor drainage.

*   **Diagnosis:**
    *   **Soil and Leaf Tissue Analysis:** Essential to pinpoint specific nutrient deficiencies (e.g., Iron, Zinc, Nitrogen, Manganese, Magnesium).
    *   **Observe Pattern:** General yellowing of older leaves suggests Nitrogen or Magnesium deficiency. Interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins, which remain green) on younger leaves suggests Iron or Zinc deficiency.
    *   **Check Drainage:** Waterlogged conditions can impair nutrient uptake.
*   **Management:**
    *   **pH Management:** In alkaline soils (common in Haryana), high pH can lock up micronutrients. Incorporate organic matter. For severe cases, soil application of elemental sulfur (over time) can help lower pH.
    *   **Nutrient Application (Foliar sprays are often most effective for micronutrients in high pH soils):**
        *   **Iron Chlorosis:** Foliar spray of **Ferrous Sulphate** (19%) at 0.5% (5 g/L) with a suitable wetting agent. Repeat every 10-15 days until symptoms improve.
        *   **Zinc Deficiency:** Foliar spray of **Zinc Sulphate** (21%) at 0.5% (5 g/L).
        *   **Nitrogen Deficiency:** Foliar spray of **Urea** (0.5-1% solution, 5-10 g/L) or soil application as per soil test.
        *   **Magnesium Deficiency:** Foliar spray of **Magnesium Sulphate** (Epsom salt) at 0.5% (5 g/L).
        *   **Manganese Deficiency:** Foliar spray of **Manganese Sulphate** (30.5%) at 0.5% (5 g/L).
    *   **Drainage Improvement:** Ensure good soil drainage to prevent waterlogging, which can lead to root damage and nutrient uptake issues.

### 3. Excessive Height

Excessive vegetative growth and height can lead to shading, reduced fruit quality, and difficulty in orchard management.

*   **Causes:** Vigorous rootstock, excessive nitrogen fertilization, lack of proper pruning and training.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Pruning and Training:**
        *   **Dormant Pruning:** Annually prune during dormancy to control tree height and spread, remove upright vigorous shoots (water sprouts), and maintain a balanced tree structure (e.g., modified central leader system).
        *   **Summer Pruning:** Light summer pruning (e.g., heading back vigorous shoots) can help reduce vigor and improve light penetration into the canopy.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen application, which promotes vegetative growth. Ensure a balanced nutrient supply based on soil and leaf analysis.
    *   **Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs):**
        *   **Paclobutrazol:** Can be used to reduce vegetative growth and promote flowering/fruiting. Apply as a soil drench or foliar spray.
            *   **Soil Drench:** Typically 0.5-1.5 g active ingredient (a.i.) per tree, depending on tree size and vigor. For a 23% SC formulation, this translates to approximately 2.2-6.5 ml product per tree. Apply in early spring.
            *   **Foliar Spray:** Typically 250-500 mg a.i./L (e.g., 1-2 ml of 23% SC per liter). Apply when new shoots are 5-10 cm long.
        *   **Chlormequat chloride:** Can be used as a foliar spray to reduce vegetative growth. Typical rates are around 1000-2000 mg a.i./L (e.g., 2-4 ml of 50% SL per liter). Apply when new shoots are actively growing.
        *   *Always refer to the specific product label for precise dosage, timing, and application methods for pear in your region.*

### 4. Excessive Flowering

Excessive flowering, if followed by heavy fruit set, can lead to small fruit size, poor fruit quality, and biennial bearing (heavy crop one year, light crop the next).

*   **Causes:** Variety characteristics, biennial bearing tendency, or sometimes stress-induced.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Flower/Fruit Thinning:** This is the most critical practice to manage excessive flowering and ensure optimal fruit load.
        *   **Manual Thinning:** Hand-thinning of flowers or young fruitlets (when they are pea-sized) is highly effective but labor-intensive. Aim for optimal fruit spacing (e.g., 1-2 fruits per cluster, 15-20 cm apart).
        *   **Chemical Thinning:** Applied at specific stages to reduce flower/fruit load.
            *   **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA):** Apply as a foliar spray at 5-10 mg a.i./L (ppm) at petal fall or 7-14 days after full bloom. *Concentration is critical; too high can lead to over-thinning or phytotoxicity.*
            *   **Ethephon:** Can be used as a foliar spray at 100-250 mg a.i./L (ppm) at petal fall or early fruit development. *Ethephon can also promote fruit ripening, so timing is crucial.*
        *   *Always follow specific product label instructions for pear, as timing and concentration are critical for effective and safe thinning.*
    *   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure adequate, but not excessive, nutrient supply to support fruit development without over-stimulating flowering.
    *   **Pruning:** Prune to maintain a balance between vegetative growth and fruiting wood. In varieties prone to over-flowering, some removal of fruiting spurs during dormant pruning can help.

**Important Note:** Always consult with local agricultural extension specialists or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your pear variety, soil type, and local climatic conditions in Haryana. Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the chemical product labels.
