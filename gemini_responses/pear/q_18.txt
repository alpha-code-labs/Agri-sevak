As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified doses for Growth Regulators and Boron in Pear cultivation in Haryana:

It is crucial to ensure accurate measurement of these chemicals, as incorrect doses can lead to adverse effects on the crop. Always read the product label for specific instructions and safety precautions.

### Growth Regulators/Hormones and Boron in Pear

1.  **Ethephon (Ethrel)**
    *   **Purpose:**
        *   **Fruit Thinning:** To reduce fruit load and improve fruit size and quality.
        *   **Fruit Ripening:** To promote uniform ripening and color development.
    *   **Recommended Dose:**
        *   **For Fruit Thinning:** Apply **Ethephon** at 100-200 ppm (0.1-0.2 ml of 40% Ethephon formulation per liter of water) 7-14 days after full bloom.
        *   **For Fruit Ripening:** Apply **Ethephon** at 250-500 ppm (0.25-0.5 ml of 40% Ethephon formulation per liter of water) 7-10 days before anticipated harvest.

2.  **2,4-D**
    *   **Purpose:** To control pre-harvest fruit drop.
    *   **Recommended Dose:**
        *   **For Pre-harvest Fruit Drop Control:** Apply **2,4-D Sodium Salt** at an extremely low concentration of 5-10 ppm (parts per million). This translates to approximately 0.005-0.01 g of 80% 2,4-D Sodium Salt formulation per liter of water.
    *   **Critical Caution:** The use of 2,4-D as a growth regulator requires extreme precision. Higher concentrations are phytotoxic and can cause severe damage to the pear trees, acting as a herbicide. It is generally recommended to use Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA) for fruit drop control due to its wider safety margin and ease of application for farmers. If 2,4-D is used, ensure accurate measurement with appropriate equipment.

3.  **Boron**
    *   **Purpose:** Essential micronutrient for pollen germination, fruit set, cell wall formation, and sugar transport. Prevents 'cork spot' or 'internal cork' and improves fruit quality.
    *   **Recommended Dose:**
        *   **Foliar Spray:** Apply **Borax (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate)** or **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (e.g., Solubor) at a concentration of 0.1-0.2% (1-2 g per liter of water).
        *   **Timing:** Two sprays are generally recommended:
            *   First spray: At the pre-bloom stage (pink bud stage).
            *   Second spray: After fruit set (pea-size fruit stage).
        *   **Soil Application (for severe deficiency):** If soil tests indicate severe boron deficiency, apply **Borax** at 10-20 kg per acre, broadcast evenly and incorporated into the soil, preferably in autumn or early spring. Foliar application is generally more efficient for quick correction.
