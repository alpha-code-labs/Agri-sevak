Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling soil pests like termites and root-knot nematodes in pear orchards in Haryana.

It is crucial to adopt an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods for sustainable and effective control.

### 1. Control of Termites (Deemak) in Pear

Termites can cause significant damage to the root system and collar region of pear trees, leading to poor nutrient uptake, wilting, stunted growth, and even tree mortality, especially in young orchards.

**A. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   **Orchard Sanitation:** Regularly remove dead wood, stumps, and other organic debris from the orchard, as these serve as breeding grounds for termites.
*   **Proper Irrigation:** Ensure adequate and timely irrigation. Water-stressed trees are more susceptible to termite attack.
*   **Avoid Direct Contact:** Do not allow organic manure or mulch to come into direct contact with the tree trunk, as this can provide a bridge for termites.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** Before planting, deep ploughing can expose termite colonies to predators and desiccation.

**B. Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved):**
For effective control, especially during planting or for existing infestations, chemical treatment is often necessary.

*   **Pre-planting Treatment (for new orchards):**
    *   Apply **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 2.5-5 ml per litre of water and drench the planting pits thoroughly before planting the saplings.
    *   Alternatively, apply **Fipronil** 0.3% GR at 10-15 kg per acre, mixed well into the soil of the planting area.

*   **Post-planting Treatment (for existing trees):**
    *   For infested trees, drench the soil around the base of the tree (up to 30-45 cm radius and 15-20 cm deep) with **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 2.5-5 ml per litre of water. The quantity of solution depends on the tree size, typically 5-10 litres per tree.
    *   Alternatively, apply **Fipronil** 0.3% GR at 20-30 g per tree around the root zone and lightly incorporate it into the soil, followed by irrigation.

### 2. Control of Nematodes (Root-Knot Nematodes - *Meloidogyne* spp.) in Pear

Root-knot nematodes are microscopic roundworms that infect the roots, causing characteristic galls or knots. This impairs the roots' ability to absorb water and nutrients, leading to stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, reduced fruit size and yield, and increased susceptibility to other diseases.

**A. Cultural and Biological Control:**
*   **Use Healthy Planting Material:** Always use nematode-free pear saplings from certified nurseries.
*   **Soil Solarization:** In nursery beds or small areas, soil solarization (covering moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets during hot summer months for 4-6 weeks) can significantly reduce nematode populations.
*   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost. Application of **Neem cake** at 200-400 kg per acre (or 1-2 kg per tree for established trees) around the root zone is highly effective in suppressing nematode populations due to its nematicidal compounds.
*   **Biological Nematicides:** Apply beneficial fungi like *Purpureocillium lilacinum* (formerly *Paecilomyces lilacinus*) or bacteria like *Bacillus subtilis* as soil drench or mix with FYM.
    *   **Purpureocillium lilacinum** (1-2% WP): Apply at 2.5-5 kg per acre, mixed with 100 kg of FYM or compost, and apply around the root zone, followed by light irrigation.

**B. Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved):**
Chemical nematicides can be used when nematode populations are high and causing significant damage.

*   **Pre-planting Treatment:**
    *   If severe nematode problems are known, consider soil application of **Fluensulfone** 2% GR at 20-30 kg per acre, incorporated into the soil before planting.

*   **Post-planting Treatment (for existing trees):**
    *   Apply **Fluensulfone** 2% GR at 20-30 kg per acre (or 100-150 g per tree for established trees) around the root zone, lightly incorporate into the soil, and irrigate immediately.
    *   Alternatively, for severe infestations, soil drenching with **Carbosulfan** 25% EC at 2-4 ml per litre of water can be done around the root zone of affected trees. The quantity of solution depends on tree size, typically 5-10 litres per tree.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label carefully, including dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Consult your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for precise recommendations tailored to your specific field conditions and pest severity.
*   Monitor your orchard regularly for signs of pest infestation to enable timely intervention.

By implementing these measures, you can effectively manage soil pests in your pear orchard and ensure healthy tree growth and good yields.
