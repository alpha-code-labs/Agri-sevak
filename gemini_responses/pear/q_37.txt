Protecting pear orchards from wild animals in Haryana requires an integrated approach, primarily focusing on physical barriers and deterrents, as direct chemical repellents for this purpose on edible crops are generally not recommended or CIBRC approved.

Here are the scientifically verified methods:

1.  **Physical Barriers (Most Effective):**
    *   **Fencing:** This is the most reliable method to prevent entry of larger animals like nilgai, wild boar, deer, and monkeys.
        *   **Barbed Wire Fence:** Install a multi-strand barbed wire fence, at least 2.5-3 meters high, with strong posts. Ensure the fence is buried at least 30-50 cm deep or has an apron to prevent animals from burrowing underneath.
        *   **Chain-link Fence:** A more robust option, though more expensive, providing better protection against smaller animals and burrowing.
        *   **Electric Fence:** A low-voltage, solar-powered electric fence can be highly effective. It delivers a non-lethal shock that deters animals. **Strict adherence to safety regulations and local government permissions is crucial for installation and maintenance.** Ensure clear warning signs are displayed.
    *   **Individual Tree Guards:** For young pear saplings, individual guards made of wire mesh, plastic mesh, or bamboo can protect them from browsing by smaller animals and rodents.

2.  **Deterrent Methods (Supplementary):**
    *   **Sound Deterrents:**
        *   **Human Presence:** Regular patrolling and human activity in the orchard can deter many animals.
        *   **Sound Cannons/Crackers:** Automatic sound cannons or occasional use of firecrackers (with caution and local permission) can scare away animals, but they can habituate over time.
    *   **Visual Deterrents:**
        *   **Scarecrows:** Traditional scarecrows can be used, but their effectiveness is limited unless they are frequently moved or modified to prevent habituation.
        *   **Reflective Tapes/CDs:** Hanging reflective tapes or old CDs can create glints of light that deter some birds and animals.
        *   **Strobe Lights/Solar Lights:** For nocturnal animals, installing solar-powered strobe lights or bright lights around the orchard perimeter can be effective.

3.  **Habitat Management and Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Orchard Sanitation:** Keep the orchard clean by promptly removing fallen fruits, weeds, and debris. Fallen fruits attract animals like wild boar and monkeys. Weeds and dense vegetation provide cover for animals.
    *   **Pruning:** Prune lower branches of pear trees to make it harder for climbing animals like monkeys to access the fruits.
    *   **Boundary Vegetation Management:** Clear dense vegetation around the orchard perimeter that might serve as hiding spots or corridors for wild animals.

4.  **Community-Based Approaches:**
    *   **Collective Fencing:** In areas with multiple orchards, a collective fencing effort can be more cost-effective and provide broader protection.
    *   **Synchronized Patrolling:** Community-level patrolling can enhance vigilance and deter animals more effectively than individual efforts.

**Regarding Chemical Repellents:**
Currently, there are no CIBRC approved chemical repellents specifically recommended for direct application on pear trees in India to deter wild animals, especially for edible fruit production. Most effective strategies rely on physical barriers and non-chemical deterrents.
