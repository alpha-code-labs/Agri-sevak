Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I will provide scientifically verified advice for controlling dropping in Pear.

Firstly, regarding "Tinda/Boll dropping":
This is not known to affect Pear. Tinda (Indian round gourd) and Boll (cotton fruit capsule) are not related to the Pear crop.

Now, let's address Flower drop and Fruit drop in Pear:

Flower and fruit drop in pear can be a complex issue, often caused by a combination of physiological, environmental, and nutritional factors. It's important to understand the underlying causes to implement effective control measures.

**Common Causes of Flower and Fruit Drop in Pear:**

1.  **Physiological Factors:**
    *   **Natural Thinning:** Pear trees naturally shed a certain percentage of flowers and young fruits to balance the crop load.
    *   **Poor Pollination:** Inadequate pollination due to lack of pollinators (bees), incompatible varieties, or adverse weather during flowering.
    *   **Hormonal Imbalance:** Imbalance of plant growth regulators within the tree.
2.  **Environmental Stress:**
    *   **Water Stress:** Both excessive (waterlogging) and insufficient (drought) soil moisture.
    *   **Temperature Extremes:** Frost during flowering, or very high temperatures during fruit development.
    *   **Strong Winds:** Can physically dislodge flowers and young fruits.
3.  **Nutritional Deficiencies:**
    *   Lack of essential micronutrients like Boron and Zinc, which are crucial for flower development, pollen viability, and fruit set.
4.  **Pest and Disease:**
    *   Severe infestations of pests or diseases can weaken the tree, leading to premature drop, though this is less common as a primary cause of "dropping" itself.

**Control Measures for Flower and Fruit Drop in Pear:**

**A. Cultural Practices (Preventive Measures):**

1.  **Ensure Proper Pollination:**
    *   Plant compatible pollinizer varieties within the orchard.
    *   Introduce bee colonies (2-3 colonies per acre) during the flowering period.
2.  **Optimal Irrigation:**
    *   Maintain consistent soil moisture, especially during flowering and fruit development. Avoid both waterlogging and drought stress.
3.  **Balanced Nutrition:**
    *   Conduct soil testing regularly to identify nutrient deficiencies and apply fertilizers as per recommendations.
    *   Ensure adequate supply of macro and micronutrients.
4.  **Pruning:**
    *   Practice proper pruning to maintain tree vigor and light penetration, which can improve fruit set.
5.  **Pest and Disease Management:**
    *   Regularly monitor and manage pests and diseases to keep trees healthy and strong.

**B. Chemical Interventions (CIBRC Approved):**

For addressing specific nutritional deficiencies and hormonal imbalances that contribute to flower and fruit drop, the following CIBRC approved chemicals can be used:

1.  **For Boron Deficiency (Crucial for pollen viability and fruit set):**
    *   Apply **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (e.g., Solubor) as a foliar spray.
        *   Dosage: **1-2 g/L** of water.
        *   Timing: Apply at pre-bloom stage and again at petal fall.

2.  **For Zinc Deficiency (Important for hormone synthesis and overall plant vigor):**
    *   Apply **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** as a foliar spray.
        *   Dosage: **2-5 g/L** of water.
        *   Timing: Apply during the dormant period or early spring flush, before flowering.

3.  **For Fruit Retention (to prevent premature fruit drop, especially pre-harvest drop):**
    *   Apply **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA)** as a foliar spray.
        *   Dosage: **0.01-0.02 g/L** of water (10-20 ppm).
        *   Timing: For preventing pre-harvest fruit drop, apply 2-4 weeks before the anticipated harvest date. For general fruit retention, it can be applied after the natural fruit drop has subsided (e.g., 3-4 weeks after petal fall), but careful observation is needed to avoid over-thinning if applied too early.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label carefully.
*   Ensure proper spray coverage for effective application.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and pear variety.

By adopting these integrated management practices, you can significantly reduce flower and fruit drop in your pear orchard and ensure a healthy yield.
