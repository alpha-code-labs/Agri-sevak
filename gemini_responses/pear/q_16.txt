As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I strongly recommend conducting a comprehensive soil test of your orchard before applying any fertilizers. Soil testing provides precise information on nutrient availability and pH, allowing for tailored recommendations and preventing nutrient imbalances or wastage. The following recommendations are general guidelines for pear cultivation in Haryana and should be adjusted based on soil test results and tree age/vigor.

**General NPK Recommendations (Elemental Nutrients per tree per year):**

*   **Young Trees (1-3 years):**
    *   Nitrogen (N): 50-150 g
    *   Phosphorus (P2O5): 25-75 g
    *   Potassium (K2O): 50-150 g
*   **Bearing Trees (4+ years):**
    *   Nitrogen (N): 200-750 g (depending on yield potential and variety)
    *   Phosphorus (P2O5): 100-300 g
    *   Potassium (K2O): 200-750 g (depending on yield potential and variety)

**Specific Fertilizer Recommendations (per tree per year):**

1.  **Nitrogen (N) Sources:**
    *   **Urea (46% N):**
        *   **Young Trees:** 100-325 g **Urea**
        *   **Bearing Trees:** 450-1650 g (approx. 0.45-1.65 kg) **Urea**
        *   **Timing:** Apply in two split doses. Half before flowering (February-March) and the remaining half after fruit set (April-May).
    *   **Nano-Urea (Liquid):**
        *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml/L of water for foliar spray.
        *   **Timing:** Apply 2-3 sprays at critical growth stages, e.g., pre-flowering, post-fruit set, and during fruit development.

2.  **Phosphorus (P) Sources:**
    *   **DAP (Di-Ammonium Phosphate, 18% N, 46% P2O5):**
        *   **Young Trees:** 55-165 g **DAP**
        *   **Bearing Trees:** 220-650 g **DAP**
        *   **Timing:** Apply as a basal dose in autumn (October-November) or early spring (January-February).
    *   **SSP (Single Super Phosphate, 16% P2O5):**
        *   **Young Trees:** 150-470 g **SSP**
        *   **Bearing Trees:** 625-1900 g (approx. 0.6-1.9 kg) **SSP**
        *   **Timing:** Apply as a basal dose in autumn (October-November) or early spring (January-February).
        *   *Note: SSP also provides Sulphur.*
    *   **Nano-DAP (Liquid):**
        *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml/L of water for foliar spray.
        *   **Timing:** Apply 2-3 sprays at critical growth stages, e.g., pre-flowering, post-fruit set, and during fruit development.

3.  **Potassium (K) Source:**
    *   **Potash (Muriate of Potash, 60% K2O):**
        *   **Young Trees:** 85-250 g **Potash**
        *   **Bearing Trees:** 330-1250 g (approx. 0.33-1.25 kg) **Potash**
        *   **Timing:** Apply as a basal dose in autumn (October-November) or early spring (January-February).

4.  **Sulphur (S) Source:**
    *   **Sulphur (Elemental Sulphur 90%):**
        *   **Dose:** 20-50 g **Sulphur** per tree per year.
        *   **Timing:** Apply as a basal dose once a year, preferably with P and K fertilizers.
        *   *Note: If SSP is used for phosphorus, it contributes significantly to sulphur requirements.*

5.  **NPK (Complex Fertilizers):**
    *   **Dose:** The dose depends on the specific NPK grade (e.g., 12:32:16, 10:26:26, 19:19:19) and the nutrient requirements determined by soil testing.
    *   **General Guideline (without soil test):**
        *   **Young Trees:** 200-500 g of a balanced **NPK** complex fertilizer per tree per year.
        *   **Bearing Trees:** 1-2 kg of a balanced **NPK** complex fertilizer per tree per year.
    *   **Timing:** Apply as a basal dose in autumn or early spring, or split into two applications similar to Urea.

**Additional Recommendations:**

*   **Farm Yard Manure (FYM):** Incorporate 20-30 kg of well-decomposed FYM or compost per bearing tree annually during autumn (October-November) to improve soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability.
*   **Micronutrients:** Pear trees can be susceptible to deficiencies of Zinc (Zn), Boron (B), Iron (Fe), and Manganese (Mn). If soil tests indicate deficiencies, apply appropriate micronutrient formulations as foliar sprays or soil applications. For example, Zinc Sulphate (0.5%) and Borax (0.1%) are commonly used.
*   **Irrigation:** Ensure adequate irrigation, especially during fertilizer application, to facilitate nutrient uptake.

Always remember that these are general guidelines. For the most accurate and effective fertilization program, a recent soil test report from a reputable lab is indispensable.
