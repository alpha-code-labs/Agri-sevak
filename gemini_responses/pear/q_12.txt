Scale insects and Mealybugs are significant sucking pests that can cause considerable damage to Pear trees by feeding on sap, leading to stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, fruit drop, and the development of sooty mould due to honeydew secretion. Effective management requires an integrated approach.

Here's how you can control them in Pear orchards:

**I. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**

1.  **Pruning:** Regularly inspect and prune heavily infested branches, twigs, and leaves. Dispose of the pruned material by burning or burying it away from the orchard to prevent further spread.
2.  **Scrubbing:** For small infestations on the trunk and larger branches, gently scrub off scale insects using a stiff brush or cloth dipped in soapy water.
3.  **High-Pressure Water Spray:** A strong jet of water can dislodge mealybugs and some scale insects from the plant surface.
4.  **Ant Control:** Control ants, as they protect mealybugs and scales for their honeydew. Apply sticky bands on tree trunks or use ant baits.

**II. Chemical Control (Use CIBRC approved chemicals only):**

Chemical control is often necessary for effective management, especially during severe infestations. Always ensure thorough coverage, targeting the undersides of leaves, branch crotches, and bark crevices where these pests hide.

**A. Dormant Season / Post-Harvest Spray (for Scale Insects and Mealybugs):**
Applying sprays during the dormant period (after leaf fall) or post-harvest (when fruits are not present) is highly effective against overwintering stages of scales and mealybugs.

*   **Horticultural Mineral Oil (HMO) / Petroleum Spray Oil (PSO):**
    *   Apply **Horticultural Mineral Oil (HMO)** or **Petroleum Spray Oil (PSO)** at a concentration of 15-20 ml per litre of water. This suffocates the pests.
*   **Chlorpyrifos 50% EC:**
    *   Mix **Chlorpyrifos 50% EC** at 2.5 ml per litre of water, often combined with Horticultural Mineral Oil for enhanced efficacy during dormant spray.

**B. During Active Growth (for Nymphs and Adults):**
When pests are active during the growing season, systemic insecticides are effective as they are absorbed by the plant and kill feeding insects.

*   **Buprofezin 25% SC:**
    *   Spray **Buprofezin 25% SC** at 1.25 ml per litre of water. This is an insect growth regulator that primarily affects nymphs.
*   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:**
    *   Apply **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL** at 0.3-0.5 ml per litre of water. This is a systemic insecticide effective against sucking pests.
*   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:**
    *   Spray **Thiamethoxam 25% WG** at 0.2 g per litre of water. This is another systemic insecticide with good efficacy against sucking pests.
*   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:**
    *   Use **Acetamiprid 20% SP** at 0.2 g per litre of water. This is a systemic insecticide that provides good control.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Rotation of Chemicals:** To prevent the development of pesticide resistance, rotate insecticides with different modes of action. Do not use the same chemical repeatedly.
*   **Thorough Coverage:** Ensure complete coverage of the plant, including the undersides of leaves, branches, and trunk, as scales and mealybugs often hide in protected areas.
*   **Timing of Application:** Early detection and timely application are crucial for effective control. Monitor your orchard regularly.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always observe the recommended Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) for any chemical applied, especially when fruits are present, to ensure fruit safety.
*   **Safety Precautions:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) like gloves, masks, and protective clothing while handling and spraying pesticides. Follow all instructions on the product label.
