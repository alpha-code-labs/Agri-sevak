As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following doses of organic manures for Pear cultivation in Haryana to enhance soil fertility, tree health, and productivity:

It is crucial to conduct a soil test to determine the specific nutrient status of your orchard soil. The following recommendations are general guidelines and can be adjusted based on soil test results and tree age.

*   **Farmyard Manure (FYM):**
    *   For young pear trees (1-3 years old): 5-10 kg per tree per year.
    *   For bearing pear trees (4 years and older): 25-30 kg per tree per year.
    *   **Application:** Apply well-decomposed **FYM** in two split doses – half during October-November (post-harvest) and the remaining half during February-March (pre-flowering) by incorporating it into the soil around the tree basin.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   For young pear trees (1-3 years old): 2-3 kg per tree per year.
    *   For bearing pear trees (4 years and older): 5-10 kg per tree per year.
    *   **Application:** **Vermicompost** can be applied in a similar manner to FYM, either in a single dose during October-November or split into two doses. Due to its higher nutrient concentration, a lower quantity is sufficient compared to FYM.

*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract):**
    *   **Sagarika** is a bio-stimulant derived from seaweed and is not a bulk manure like FYM or vermicompost. It is typically applied as a foliar spray or soil drench to promote growth and improve nutrient uptake.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** 2.5-5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Application:** Apply **Sagarika** as a foliar spray at critical growth stages:
        *   First spray: Pre-flowering stage.
        *   Second spray: At fruit set stage.
        *   Third spray: During fruit development/enlargement stage.
    *   Ensure complete coverage of the foliage during spraying.
