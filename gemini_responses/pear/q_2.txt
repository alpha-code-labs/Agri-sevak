As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I will provide scientifically verified advice for controlling rust diseases in Pear, specifically for Haryana.

First, let's clarify which of the mentioned rust diseases are known to affect Pear:

*   **Yellow Rust (Stripe Rust):** This is not known to affect Pear. It primarily affects cereal crops.
*   **White Rust:** This is not known to affect Pear. It typically affects cruciferous vegetables and other specific hosts.

The terms "Black Rust," "Brown Rust," and "Red Rust" on Pear generally refer to various species of *Gymnosporangium* rusts, which are the primary rust diseases affecting pear in our region and globally. These include diseases like Cedar-Pear Rust (*Gymnosporangium juniperi-virginianae*) and Pear Trellis Rust (*Gymnosporangium sabinae*). These rusts are characterized by requiring two different host plants to complete their life cycle: a juniper (cedar) and a pear (or apple) tree.

### Control Measures for *Gymnosporangium* Rusts (Black, Brown, Red Rust) in Pear:

Effective management of *Gymnosporangium* rusts requires an integrated approach combining cultural practices and timely chemical interventions.

#### 1. Cultural Practices:

*   **Alternate Host Removal:** The most effective long-term solution is to remove juniper (cedar) trees from within a 1-2 km radius of the pear orchard. This breaks the disease cycle.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available and suitable for Haryana's climate, planting pear varieties known to be resistant or tolerant to rusts can significantly reduce disease incidence. Consult HAU for recommended varieties.
*   **Pruning:** Prune out any infected branches or twigs showing cankers or galls during dormancy to reduce inoculum.
*   **Orchard Sanitation:** Collect and destroy fallen infected leaves and fruit to reduce overwintering spores.
*   **Proper Spacing and Air Circulation:** Ensure adequate spacing between trees and proper pruning to improve air circulation within the canopy, which helps in faster drying of foliage and reduces conditions favorable for fungal growth.

#### 2. Chemical Control (Fungicides):

Fungicide applications are crucial, especially during the spring when spores are released from junipers and conditions are favorable for infection on pear trees. Preventive sprays are more effective than curative ones.

**Timing of Application:**
*   Start applications at bud break (green tip stage) and continue through petal fall, or as per disease pressure, typically at 7-14 day intervals.
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

**CIBRC Approved Fungicides for Rusts in Pear:**

*   **Mancozeb 75% WP:**
    *   **Dosage:** 2.0 - 2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Application:** A broad-spectrum protective fungicide. Apply preventively.
*   **Propiconazole 25% EC:**
    *   **Dosage:** 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Application:** A systemic fungicide with protective and curative action. Effective when applied early in the infection cycle.
*   **Difenoconazole 25% EC:**
    *   **Dosage:** 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Application:** A systemic triazole fungicide with protective and curative properties.
*   **Myclobutanil 10% WP:**
    *   **Dosage:** 0.4 - 0.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Application:** A systemic fungicide with protective and curative action, particularly effective against rusts.
*   **Tebuconazole 25.9% EC:**
    *   **Dosage:** 0.75 ml/L of water.
    *   **Application:** A systemic fungicide with protective, curative, and eradicant action.
*   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:**
    *   **Dosage:** 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Application:** A systemic strobilurin fungicide with protective, curative, and eradicant properties.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the label instructions for any pesticide product.
*   Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage during spraying.
*   Observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) specified on the fungicide label to ensure fruit safety.
*   Consult with HAU extension specialists for the most current recommendations and specific disease outbreaks in your area.
