As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following for pear transplantation in Haryana:

### Ideal Transplantation Time

The ideal time for transplanting pear trees in Haryana is during their dormant period, which allows the plant to establish its root system before the onset of new growth.

*   **Late December to February:** This period, after the severe winter cold has passed but before the spring flush, is optimal. Ensure the soil is workable and not waterlogged or frozen.

### Transplantation Distance (Spacing)

The spacing depends on the rootstock used (dwarfing, semi-dwarfing, or vigorous) and the desired training system. For common semi-vigorous to vigorous rootstocks suitable for Haryana conditions:

*   **Standard Spacing:**
    *   **Row to Row:** 5 to 6 meters
    *   **Plant to Plant:** 4 to 5 meters
*   **High-Density Planting (with dwarfing rootstocks):**
    *   **Row to Row:** 3 to 4 meters
    *   **Plant to Plant:** 1.5 to 2.5 meters

### Transplantation Process

A well-executed transplantation process is crucial for the successful establishment and long-term health of pear trees.

1.  **Pit Preparation (15-30 days in advance):**
    *   Dig pits of 1 meter x 1 meter x 1 meter (length x width x depth).
    *   Separate the topsoil from the subsoil.
    *   Mix the topsoil with 20-30 kg of well-decomposed Farmyard Manure (FYM), 1 kg of Single Super Phosphate (SSP), and 500 grams of Muriate of Potash (MOP). If the soil is heavy clay, incorporate 5-10 kg of sand.
    *   Refill the pits with this prepared mixture, allowing it to settle.

2.  **Selection of Saplings:**
    *   Choose healthy, disease-free, 1 to 2-year-old grafted saplings from a reputable nursery.
    *   Ensure the saplings have a well-developed root system and a sturdy stem.

3.  **Planting:**
    *   On the day of planting, make a small hole in the center of the refilled pit, just large enough to accommodate the root ball of the sapling.
    *   Carefully remove the sapling from its nursery bag or container, minimizing disturbance to the roots.
    *   Place the sapling in the center of the hole. Ensure the graft union (the swollen part where the scion is joined to the rootstock) is positioned 15-20 cm above the final soil level to prevent scion rooting.
    *   Backfill the hole with the remaining prepared soil mixture, gently firming the soil around the roots to remove any air pockets.
    *   Create a small basin around the plant for efficient irrigation.

4.  **Post-Planting Care:**
    *   **Immediate Irrigation:** Water the newly planted sapling thoroughly immediately after planting to settle the soil around the roots.
    *   **Staking:** Provide support with a sturdy stake, especially in windy areas, to prevent the young plant from swaying and damaging its newly forming root system.
    *   **Pruning:** Head back the sapling to a height of 75-90 cm from the ground to encourage the development of strong lateral branches and a good framework. Remove any damaged or crossing branches.
    *   **Mulching:** Apply a layer of organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves) around the base of the plant to conserve soil moisture, regulate soil temperature, and suppress weeds.
    *   **Protection:** Protect young saplings from pests, diseases, and animal damage as needed.
