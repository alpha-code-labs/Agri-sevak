As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Pear in Haryana. It is crucial to adopt an Integrated Disease Management (IDM) approach, combining cultural practices with judicious use of CIBRC-approved fungicides.

Here's how to control the specified fungal diseases in Pear:

### 1. Alternaria (Alternaria Leaf Spot/Blight)

**Symptoms:** Small, dark brown to black spots, often with concentric rings, appear on leaves. Severe infection can lead to defoliation and fruit spots.

**Control Measures:**
*   **Cultural:**
    *   Remove and destroy fallen leaves and infected plant debris.
    *   Ensure proper tree spacing and pruning to improve air circulation within the canopy.
    *   Maintain balanced nutrition to enhance tree vigor.
*   **Chemical:**
    *   Apply fungicides preventively or at the first sign of symptoms.
    *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP: 2.5 g/L water.
    *   **Chlorothalonil** 75% WP: 2 g/L water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC: 0.5 ml/L water.
    *   **Tebuconazole** 25% EC: 0.75 ml/L water.

### 2. Anthracnose

**Symptoms:** Sunken, dark brown to black lesions develop on fruit, often exuding pinkish spore masses in humid conditions. It can also cause twig dieback and leaf spots.

**Control Measures:**
*   **Cultural:**
    *   Prune out and destroy all infected twigs, branches, and mummified fruits.
    *   Avoid overhead irrigation, which can spread spores.
    *   Maintain good orchard sanitation.
*   **Chemical:**
    *   **Captan** 50% WP: 2 g/L water.
    *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP: 2.5 g/L water.
    *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: 1 g/L water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC: 0.5 ml/L water.

### 3. Blast

This is not known as a primary fungal disease name for Pear. "Blasting" of flowers or shoots can be a symptom of various issues, including bacterial diseases (e.g., Fire Blight, which is bacterial, not fungal) or environmental stress.

### 4. Blight (General Fungal Blight, e.g., Botrytis Blight)

**Symptoms:** Browning and death of flowers, young shoots, or leaves, often starting from the tips or margins. Can lead to cankers and dieback.

**Control Measures:**
*   **Cultural:**
    *   Promptly prune and destroy all blighted plant parts.
    *   Improve air circulation through proper pruning and spacing.
    *   Manage humidity in the orchard, especially during flowering.
*   **Chemical:**
    *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: 1 g/L water.
    *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP: 2.5 g/L water.
    *   **Chlorothalonil** 75% WP: 2 g/L water.
    *   **Pyraclostrobin + Boscalid** (e.g., 12.8% + 25.2% WG): 1.5 g/L water.

### 5. Brown Spot (Stemphylium vesicarium)

**Symptoms:** Irregular, dark brown spots appear on leaves, often surrounded by a purplish halo. Severe infection can cause premature defoliation and fruit spots.

**Control Measures:**
*   **Cultural:**
    *   Remove and destroy fallen leaves and other plant debris.
    *   Prune trees to ensure good air circulation.
    *   Avoid water stress, as stressed trees can be more susceptible.
*   **Chemical:**
    *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP: 2.5 g/L water.
    *   **Difenoconazole** 25% EC: 0.5 ml/L water.
    *   **Propiconazole** 25% EC: 0.5 ml/L water.

### 6. Downy Mildew

This is not a common or major fungal disease of Pear in Haryana. While some *Peronospora* species can cause downy mildew on various plants, it is rarely a significant issue for pear cultivation in our region.

### 7. Powdery Mildew (Podosphaera leucotricha)

**Symptoms:** White, powdery patches appear on young leaves, shoots, and sometimes fruit. Infected leaves may curl, distort, and become brittle.

**Control Measures:**
*   **Cultural:**
    *   Prune out and destroy all infected shoots and leaves during dormant and growing seasons.
    *   Select resistant pear varieties if available for future plantings.
    *   Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which promotes lush, susceptible growth.
*   **Chemical:**
    *   **Wettable Sulphur** 80% WP: 2-3 g/L water (avoid application in very hot weather, as it can cause phytotoxicity).
    *   **Myclobutanil** 10% WP: 0.5 g/L water.
    *   **Penconazole** 10% EC: 0.5 ml/L water.
    *   **Hexaconazole** 5% SC: 1 ml/L water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC: 0.5 ml/L water.

### 8. Grey Mildew

This is not known as a primary fungal disease name for Pear. It is possible the user is referring to Grey Mold (*Botrytis cinerea*), which can affect pear fruit, flowers, and shoots, especially under high humidity. If Grey Mold is observed, fungicides like **Pyraclostrobin + Boscalid** or **Carbendazim** can be effective.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Timing:** Apply fungicides preventively, especially during critical growth stages (e.g., bud break, flowering, fruit set), or at the very first appearance of symptoms.
*   **Rotation:** Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in pathogens.
*   **Adjuvants:** Always use a spreader-sticker (adjuvant) with fungicide sprays for better coverage and efficacy, as per product label instructions.
*   **Safety:** Always read and follow the instructions on the fungicide label, including dosage, safety precautions, and pre-harvest intervals (PHI).
*   **Local Conditions:** Disease incidence can vary based on local weather conditions and orchard management practices. Regular scouting is essential to identify diseases early.

For specific recommendations tailored to your orchard's conditions, please consult with the plant pathology experts at HAU, Hisar, or your local agricultural extension office.
