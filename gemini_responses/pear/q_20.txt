Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, I understand the critical role of micronutrients in pear cultivation, especially given the soil conditions often found in Haryana. Addressing these deficiencies effectively requires a scientific approach, starting with proper diagnosis.

**Crucial First Step: Soil and Leaf Tissue Analysis**
Before applying any micronutrients, it is highly recommended to conduct a comprehensive soil test and, if possible, a leaf tissue analysis. This will accurately identify the specific deficiencies and their severity, allowing for targeted and efficient application, preventing over-application which can be detrimental. HAU's soil testing labs can provide this service.

Here's how to address common micronutrient deficiencies in Pear:

### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Small, narrow leaves (little leaf), rosetting of terminal leaves, shortened internodes, and interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application (for severe deficiency, based on soil test):**
        *   Apply **Zinc Sulphate (21% Zn)** @ 10-25 kg/acre once every 2-3 years, preferably before monsoon or during dormant season.
    *   **Foliar Application (most effective for quick correction):**
        *   Spray **Zinc Sulphate (21% Zn)** @ 5 g/L of water.
        *   Alternatively, use **Zinc EDTA (12% Zn)** @ 1 g/L of water.
        *   **Timing:** Apply during pre-bloom, petal fall, or as symptoms appear. Repeat 2-3 times at 15-day intervals if deficiency is severe.

### 2. Iron (Fe) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Pronounced interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on young leaves, with veins remaining green. In severe cases, leaves may turn almost white, leading to necrosis. Common in high pH, calcareous soils of Haryana.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application (less effective in high pH soils):**
        *   **Ferrous Sulphate** @ 25-50 kg/acre can be applied, but its availability is poor in high pH soils. Chelated forms like **Iron EDTA (12% Fe)** or **Iron DTPA (11% Fe)** @ 5-10 kg/acre are more effective if soil application is chosen.
    *   **Foliar Application (highly recommended for quick and effective correction in Haryana):**
        *   Spray **Ferrous Sulphate** @ 5 g/L of water.
        *   Alternatively, use **Iron EDTA (12% Fe)** @ 1-1.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Timing:** Apply as soon as symptoms appear. Repeat 2-3 times at 10-15 day intervals until symptoms disappear.

### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Dieback of growing points, poor fruit set, fruit cracking, corking, internal browning of fruit, and sometimes distorted leaf shape.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application (based on soil test, *caution with overdose*):**
        *   Apply **Borax (10.5% B)** @ 5-10 kg/acre once every 3-4 years.
        *   Alternatively, **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate (20% B)** @ 2.5-5 kg/acre.
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray **Borax (10.5% B)** @ 2-3 g/L of water.
        *   Alternatively, use **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate (20% B)** @ 1-1.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Timing:** Critical stages are pre-bloom and petal fall for fruit set and quality. A post-harvest application can also be beneficial.

### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** While less common as a primary deficiency in pear compared to apple (e.g., bitter pit), it can manifest as poor fruit firmness, reduced storage life, and sometimes tip burn on young leaves or blossom end rot-like symptoms on fruit.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   Apply **Gypsum (Calcium Sulphate)** @ 200-500 kg/acre, especially beneficial in sodic soils common in Haryana.
        *   **Calcium Nitrate** @ 10-20 kg/acre can also be applied.
    *   **Foliar Application (most effective for fruit quality):**
        *   Spray **Calcium Nitrate** @ 5-10 g/L of water.
        *   Alternatively, use **Calcium Chloride** @ 3-5 g/L of water.
        *   **Timing:** Start applications during fruit development (e.g., 3-4 weeks after petal fall) and repeat every 10-15 days, 3-5 times, especially during rapid fruit growth.

### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, starting from the margins and progressing inwards, often with a reddish or purplish tint. Leaves may become brittle and drop prematurely.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   Apply **Magnesium Sulphate** @ 10-25 kg/acre.
    *   **Foliar Application (for quick relief):**
        *   Spray **Magnesium Sulphate** @ 5-10 g/L of water.
        *   **Timing:** Apply as symptoms appear. Repeat 2-3 times at 15-day intervals if necessary.

### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, similar to iron deficiency but often with a finer, net-like pattern and sometimes small necrotic spots. Can be confused with iron deficiency.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application (less effective in high pH soils):**
        *   Apply **Manganese Sulphate** @ 10-20 kg/acre.
    *   **Foliar Application (recommended for quick correction):**
        *   Spray **Manganese Sulphate** @ 3-5 g/L of water.
        *   Alternatively, use **Manganese EDTA (12% Mn)** @ 1 g/L of water.
        *   **Timing:** Apply as symptoms appear. Repeat 2-3 times at 10-15 day intervals.

### General Recommendations:

*   **Adjuvant:** Always add a good quality non-ionic wetting agent/spreader @ 0.5-1 ml/L to foliar sprays to improve coverage and absorption.
*   **pH of Spray Solution:** For optimal nutrient uptake, ensure the pH of your spray solution is slightly acidic (pH 5.5-6.5).
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management:** Combine micronutrient applications with balanced NPK fertilization and organic matter additions (farmyard manure, compost) to improve soil health and nutrient availability.
*   **Water Quality:** Use good quality water for spraying. Hard water can reduce the efficacy of some chelates.
*   **Consult HAU Experts:** For specific field conditions and severe deficiencies, always consult with HAU agronomists for tailored advice.

By following these scientifically verified recommendations, you can effectively manage micronutrient deficiencies in your pear orchard and ensure healthy growth and optimal fruit production.
