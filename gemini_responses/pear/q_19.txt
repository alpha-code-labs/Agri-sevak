As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I emphasize that addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies in Pear (Pyrus communis) effectively requires a scientific approach, starting with accurate diagnosis. While visual symptoms can indicate a deficiency, a comprehensive soil test and, if possible, leaf tissue analysis are crucial for precise recommendations tailored to your specific orchard conditions in Haryana.

Here's how to address Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K) deficiencies in Pear, based on scientifically verified practices:

### General Approach:
Before applying any fertilizers, it is highly recommended to conduct a **soil test** through a reputable laboratory (like HAU's soil testing lab). This will provide exact nutrient levels, pH, and organic carbon content, allowing for precise and efficient fertilizer application, preventing over-application and nutrient imbalances.

### 1. Addressing Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Pale green to yellow leaves (especially older ones), stunted growth, reduced shoot elongation, poor fruit set, and smaller fruit size.

**Correction:** Nitrogen is highly mobile in the soil and within the plant.

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   For mature bearing trees, a general recommendation is 200-300 g of actual Nitrogen per tree per year, split into 2-3 applications.
    *   **First application (pre-flowering/bud break):** 1/2 of the total N.
    *   **Second application (fruit set/early fruit development):** 1/4 of the total N.
    *   **Third application (post-harvest, if needed):** 1/4 of the total N.
    *   **Recommended Fertilizers:**
        *   **Urea** (46% N): Apply 435-650 g per tree per year, split as above. Spread evenly in the root zone (drip line) and lightly incorporate into the soil, followed by irrigation.
        *   **Calcium Ammonium Nitrate (CAN)** (25% N): Apply 800-1200 g per tree per year, split as above.
*   **Foliar Application (for quick but temporary relief or mild deficiency):**
    *   **Urea** (low biuret): Prepare a 0.5-1.0% solution (5-10 g of Urea per litre of water). Spray during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to avoid leaf scorch. Repeat every 10-15 days if needed.

### 2. Addressing Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Dark green or purplish discoloration of leaves (especially older ones), stunted growth, poor root development, delayed flowering and fruit maturity, and reduced fruit quality. Phosphorus is less mobile in the soil.

**Correction:** Phosphorus is best applied as a basal dose or incorporated into the soil due to its low mobility.

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   For mature bearing trees, a general recommendation is 100-150 g of P2O5 per tree per year.
    *   Apply the entire dose once a year, preferably during late dormancy or before flowering, by incorporating it into the soil around the tree's root zone.
    *   **Recommended Fertilizers:**
        *   **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5): Apply 215-325 g per tree per year.
        *   **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5): Apply 625-940 g per tree per year.
*   **Foliar Application:**
    *   Foliar application of phosphorus is generally less effective due to poor absorption. However, for very mild deficiencies or as a supplementary measure, a 0.5% solution of **Monoammonium Phosphate (MAP)** (5 g of MAP per litre of water) can be tried.

### 3. Addressing Potassium (K) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Scorching or browning of leaf margins (initially on older leaves), poor fruit development, reduced fruit size and quality, increased susceptibility to diseases, and poor winter hardiness.

**Correction:** Potassium is moderately mobile in the soil.

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   For mature bearing trees, a general recommendation is 150-250 g of K2O per tree per year.
    *   Apply in 1-2 split doses:
        *   **First application (pre-flowering/fruit set):** 1/2 of the total K.
        *   **Second application (during fruit development/enlargement):** 1/2 of the total K.
    *   **Recommended Fertilizers:**
        *   **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** / **Potassium Chloride** (60% K2O): Apply 250-415 g per tree per year, split as above. Spread evenly in the root zone and incorporate, followed by irrigation.
        *   **Sulphate of Potash (SOP)** / **Potassium Sulphate** (50% K2O): Apply 300-500 g per tree per year, split as above. SOP is preferred in saline soils or where sulfur is also beneficial.
*   **Foliar Application:**
    *   For quick relief or as a supplement, a 0.5-1.0% solution of **Potassium Nitrate** (5-10 g of Potassium Nitrate per litre of water) can be sprayed during fruit development.

### Important Considerations:

*   **Irrigation:** Always ensure adequate irrigation after soil application of fertilizers to help dissolve and move nutrients into the root zone.
*   **Organic Matter:** Regular incorporation of well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost (5-10 kg per tree annually) significantly improves soil health, nutrient retention, and microbial activity, enhancing nutrient availability.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Avoid applying excessive amounts of any single nutrient, as this can lead to imbalances and induce deficiencies of other essential nutrients.
*   **Timing:** The timing of fertilizer application is critical for optimal uptake and utilization by the pear trees.
*   **Consultation:** For specific and tailored recommendations based on your soil test results and tree age/productivity, please consult with the horticulture experts at HAU, Hisar.
