Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding sucking pests in pear orchards. These pests, including Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, Thrips, and Psylla, can cause significant damage by feeding on plant sap, leading to stunted growth, leaf curling, fruit deformation, and transmission of viral diseases. Pear Psylla, in particular, is a major pest of pear.

Here's a scientifically verified approach for their control:

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategy:**

A holistic approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods is most effective for sustainable pest management.

1.  **Monitoring and Scouting:**
    *   Regularly inspect your pear trees, especially young shoots, undersides of leaves, flowers, and developing fruits, for the presence of pests and their damage symptoms.
    *   Use yellow sticky traps to monitor populations of whiteflies, leafhoppers, and thrips.

2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Pruning:** Remove water sprouts and suckers, as these often harbor pests. Ensure proper canopy management for good air circulation and light penetration.
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the orchard floor free of weeds, which can act as alternate hosts for many sucking pests.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, as it can lead to lush, succulent growth that is more attractive to sucking pests.
    *   **Orchard Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infested plant parts.

3.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Conserve and encourage natural enemies such as ladybird beetles, lacewings, hoverfly larvae, and parasitic wasps (e.g., *Encarsia* species for whiteflies, *Aphidius* species for aphids). Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.
    *   Consider releases of commercially available biological control agents if pest pressure is high and conditions are suitable.

**Chemical Control (Use only CIBRC approved technical chemical names):**

Chemical intervention should be a last resort and applied judiciously, rotating chemicals to prevent resistance development. Always follow label instructions for dosage and safety.

**For general sucking pest complex (Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, Thrips, Psylla):**

*   **Early Stage Infestation / Low to Moderate Population:**
    *   **Azadirachtin** (1% EC): 2.5 - 5.0 ml/L of water. (Effective as a repellent, antifeedant, and insect growth regulator, especially against nymphs).

*   **Moderate to High Infestation:**
    *   **Imidacloprid** (17.8% SL): 0.5 - 0.75 ml/L of water. (Systemic, effective against aphids, leafhoppers, thrips, and whiteflies).
    *   **Thiamethoxam** (25% WG): 0.2 - 0.3 g/L of water. (Systemic, effective against aphids, leafhoppers, whiteflies, and thrips).
    *   **Acetamiprid** (20% SP): 0.2 - 0.4 g/L of water. (Systemic, effective against aphids, leafhoppers, whiteflies, and thrips).

**Specific for Pear Psylla and Whiteflies (especially nymphs):**

*   **Buprofezin** (25% SC): 1.25 - 1.5 ml/L of water. (Insect growth regulator, highly effective against nymphs of whiteflies and psylla).
*   **Spiromesifen** (22.9% SC): 0.5 - 0.7 ml/L of water. (Effective against whiteflies, psylla, and mites).
*   **Pyriproxyfen** (10% EC): 1.0 - 1.25 ml/L of water. (Insect growth regulator, effective against whiteflies, scales, and psylla).

**Specific for Aphids and Whiteflies:**

*   **Flonicamid** (50% WG): 0.3 g/L of water. (Selective insecticide, effective against aphids and whiteflies, with less impact on beneficial insects).

**Specific for Whiteflies and Thrips:**

*   **Diafenthiuron** (50% WP): 1.0 - 1.25 g/L of water. (Pro-insecticide, effective against whiteflies, thrips, and mites).

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Rotation of Chemicals:** To prevent the development of pesticide resistance, always rotate insecticides with different modes of action. Do not use the same chemical or chemicals from the same group repeatedly.
*   **Timing of Application:** Apply insecticides when pest populations are at economic threshold levels and during the most susceptible life stages (e.g., nymphs). Avoid spraying during flowering to protect pollinators.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where many sucking pests reside.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, and protective clothing while handling and applying pesticides. Follow the pre-harvest interval (PHI) mentioned on the product label.
