As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling these pests in Pear in Haryana:

**Ber fly (*Carpomyia vesuviana*)**
This is not known to affect Pear. Ber fly is a specific pest of Ber (*Ziziphus mauritiana*).

**Fruit fly (e.g., *Bactrocera dorsalis*, *Bactrocera zonata*) in Pear**
Fruit flies are significant pests of pear. An integrated pest management (IPM) approach is recommended for effective control:

1.  **Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
    *   **Orchard Sanitation:** Regularly collect and destroy all fallen and infested fruits by burying them deep in the soil or burning them. This breaks the life cycle of the pest.
    *   **Deep Ploughing:** After harvest, deep ploughing of the orchard soil exposes pupae to predators and adverse weather conditions, reducing the next generation.
    *   **Pheromone Traps:** Install methyl eugenol-based pheromone traps at a density of 10-12 traps per acre, starting from fruit set. These traps attract and kill male fruit flies, reducing the population. Replace lures every 2-3 weeks.

2.  **Chemical Control (as a last resort or in conjunction with other methods):**
    *   **Bait Sprays:** This is the most effective chemical method for fruit flies. Prepare a bait solution and apply it as spot sprays on the leaves (not directly on fruits) of alternate trees or in patches.
        *   Mix 2 ml of **Malathion** 50% EC with 20 grams of jaggery or protein hydrolysate per liter of water.
        *   Apply this bait spray during the fruit development stage, especially when fruit fly activity is observed. Repeat if necessary, maintaining appropriate pre-harvest intervals.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of pesticides.
*   Observe the recommended pre-harvest interval (PHI) for any pesticide applied to ensure fruit safety.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension services for the most current recommendations and specific pest outbreaks in your area.
