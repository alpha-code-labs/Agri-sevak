As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies in Pear orchards in Haryana.

It's important to identify the specific pest species causing damage, as control strategies can vary. However, here are general recommendations for common pests within these categories affecting pear:

**I. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Orchard Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy fallen leaves, fruits, and weeds, which can harbor pests or their pupae.
    *   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy any infested branches or twigs.
    *   **Soil Cultivation:** Deep ploughing around the base of trees during winter can expose soil-dwelling grubs (e.g., chafer beetle grubs) and pupae to predators and adverse weather conditions.
    *   **Maintain Tree Vigor:** Ensure proper irrigation and nutrient management to help trees withstand pest attacks.

2.  **Mechanical Control:**
    *   **Hand Picking:** For visible pests like adult chafer beetles (active at night) or pear slug sawfly larvae, hand-picking and destroying them can be effective in small orchards.
    *   **Light Traps:** Install light traps during peak activity periods of nocturnal beetles (e.g., chafer beetles) to attract and kill them.
    *   **Shaking Branches:** In the early morning, shake branches over a sheet to dislodge pests and destroy them.

3.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Conserve natural enemies such as predatory birds, spiders, and parasitic wasps that prey on these pests. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides when natural enemy populations are high.
    *   Consider using entomopathogenic fungi like *Beauveria bassiana* for soil-dwelling stages of beetles and weevils, or for direct spray on adults.

**II. Chemical Control (Use only CIBRC approved technical chemical names):**

Chemical intervention should be considered when pest populations exceed economic thresholds and other methods are insufficient. Always follow label instructions for dosage and safety.

**A. For Beetles (e.g., Chafer Beetles, Leaf Beetles):**
*   **For adult defoliating beetles:**
    *   Spray with **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, spray with **Quinalphos** 25% EC at 2 ml/L of water.
*   **For soil-dwelling grubs (e.g., white grubs of chafer beetles):**
    *   Apply **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC as a soil drench around the tree base at 4 ml/L of water (approximately 5-10 L solution per tree depending on age and canopy size).

**B. For Weevils:**
*   **For general weevil control (e.g., stem weevils, fruit weevils):**
    *   Spray with **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, spray with **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 2 ml/L of water.
    *   Timing is crucial, often targeting adults before egg-laying or early larval stages.

**C. For Sawflies (e.g., Pear Slug Sawfly - *Caliroa cerasi*):**
*   **For larvae (slug-like caterpillars) skeletonizing leaves:**
    *   Spray with **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, spray with **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC at 0.3 ml/L of water.
    *   Another option is **Thiamethoxam + Lambda-cyhalothrin** 12.6% ZC at 0.25 ml/L of water.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Timing:** Apply insecticides when pests are most vulnerable (e.g., young larvae, active adults).
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always observe the specified pre-harvest interval for any chemical applied to ensure fruit safety.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and application.
