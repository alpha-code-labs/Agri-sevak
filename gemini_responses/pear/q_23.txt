As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified recommendations for Pear cultivation in Haryana:

### Seed Treatment for Pear

Pear (Pyrus communis, Pyrus pyrifolia, etc.) is primarily propagated vegetatively through grafting or budding onto suitable rootstocks (e.g., Pyrus communis, Pyrus calleryana, quince). Commercial pear orchards are established using grafted saplings, not by planting seeds directly. Seeds are generally used for breeding new varieties or for producing rootstocks, but not for establishing a fruit-bearing orchard due to genetic variability and a long juvenile period.

Therefore, **seed treatment is not a standard recommended practice for establishing a commercial pear orchard.**

### Soil Treatment Process for Pear (Pre-plant for Orchard Establishment)

Effective pre-plant soil treatment is crucial for establishing a healthy and productive pear orchard. The process should focus on improving soil health, managing soil-borne pathogens, and correcting nutrient deficiencies.

1.  **Soil Testing:**
    *   Before any treatment, conduct a comprehensive soil test to determine pH, nutrient status (macro and micronutrients), organic carbon content, and presence of soil-borne pests like nematodes. This will guide specific treatment decisions.

2.  **Land Preparation and Organic Matter Incorporation:**
    *   Deep ploughing (up to 60-90 cm) to break hardpans and improve drainage.
    *   Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost at a rate of **20-30 tonnes/acre** during land preparation. This improves soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability.

3.  **Soil Solarization (Non-chemical method):**
    *   In areas with high temperatures (May-June in Haryana), soil solarization can be highly effective.
    *   Moisten the soil thoroughly and cover it with a transparent polyethylene sheet (25-100 micron thickness) for 4-6 weeks during peak summer. This raises soil temperature, reducing populations of weeds, nematodes, and soil-borne pathogens.

4.  **pH Correction:**
    *   Pear thrives in well-drained loamy soils with a pH range of 6.0-7.5.
    *   If soil test indicates acidic soil (pH < 6.0), apply agricultural lime (calcium carbonate) as per soil test recommendations.
    *   If soil test indicates alkaline soil (pH > 7.5), apply gypsum (calcium sulfate) or elemental sulfur as per soil test recommendations to lower the pH.

5.  **Management of Soil-borne Pests and Diseases (if identified by soil test or history):**

    *   **Nematode Management:**
        *   **Biological Control:**
            *   Apply bio-nematicides like **_Purpureocillium lilacinum_** (formerly _Paecilomyces lilacinus_) or **_Trichoderma harzianum_** at the rate of **2-4 kg/acre** mixed with 100 kg of FYM or compost, and incorporate into the soil before planting.
        *   **Chemical Control (if severe infestation):**
            *   Apply **Fluensulfone** (granular) at **6 kg/acre** or **Ethoprophos** (granular) at **10 kg/acre** and thoroughly incorporate into the soil before planting. Ensure proper safety measures during application.

    *   **Soil-borne Fungal Disease Management (e.g., Phytophthora, Fusarium wilt):**
        *   **Biological Control:**
            *   Apply bio-fungicides like **_Trichoderma viride_** or **_Pseudomonas fluorescens_** at the rate of **2-4 kg/acre** mixed with 100 kg of FYM or compost, and incorporate into the soil before planting.
        *   **Chemical Control (if specific pathogens are identified and severe):**
            *   For Oomycete pathogens (e.g., Phytophthora), a pre-plant drench or incorporation of **Metalaxyl** (e.g., as Metalaxyl 35% WS) can be considered. However, for perennial fruit crops, this is often done as a drench around the root zone after planting if symptoms appear, rather than a broadcast pre-plant treatment. Consult with HAU experts for specific recommendations based on pathogen identification.

**Note:** Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and CIBRC guidelines for the safe and effective use of any chemical pesticides. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approaches, combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods, are highly recommended for sustainable pear cultivation.
