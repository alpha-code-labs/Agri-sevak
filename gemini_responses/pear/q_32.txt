Namaste! The "drying up" of branches, leaves, fruits, and flowers in pear trees is a serious symptom that can indicate a range of underlying issues, rather than a single disease. As a Senior Agronomist, my primary advice is to accurately diagnose the cause, as the management strategy will vary significantly.

Here are the potential causes and recommended approaches for pear trees in Haryana:

### I. Potential Causes of Drying Up in Pear

**A. Abiotic Factors (Non-living causes):**

1.  **Water Stress:**
    *   **Drought/Insufficient Irrigation:** Leads to wilting, scorching, and eventual drying of plant parts.
    *   **Waterlogging/Poor Drainage:** Causes root suffocation and rot, impairing water uptake, leading to similar symptoms as drought.
2.  **Nutrient Deficiencies:**
    *   **Potassium (K) Deficiency:** Often causes marginal leaf scorch and dieback.
    *   **Boron (B) Deficiency:** Can lead to dieback of shoot tips, poor fruit set, and fruit cracking.
    *   **Calcium (Ca) Deficiency:** Affects cell wall integrity, leading to localized tissue death.
3.  **Soil Salinity/Sodicity:** High salt content in the soil (common in parts of Haryana) can hinder water uptake, causing leaf burn and dieback.
4.  **Heat Stress/Sunburn:** Intense heat can scorch leaves and bark, leading to localized drying.
5.  **Root Damage:** Mechanical injury, rodent damage, or damage from improper cultivation can impair water and nutrient uptake.
6.  **Chemical Injury:** Herbicide drift or improper application of pesticides can cause phytotoxicity and drying.

**B. Biotic Factors (Living causes):**

**1. Diseases:**

*   **Fire Blight (*Erwinia amylovora*):** This is a highly destructive bacterial disease of pear.
    *   **Symptoms:** Young shoots and flowers rapidly turn black or brown, appearing scorched as if by fire. Blighted leaves remain attached. A characteristic "shepherd's crook" bending of shoot tips is often seen. Cankers (sunken, discolored areas) may form on branches and trunks, exuding bacterial ooze. Fruits can also shrivel and blacken.
*   **Dieback and Canker Diseases (Fungal):** Various fungi (e.g., *Botryosphaeria*, *Phomopsis*) can cause branches to die back from the tip, often associated with cankers on the bark.
*   **Root Rot Diseases (*Phytophthora* spp., *Armillaria* spp.):** Fungal pathogens that attack roots, especially in waterlogged conditions, leading to overall decline, wilting, and drying of the canopy.

**2. Pests:**

*   **Stem/Shoot Borers:** Larvae of insects bore into stems and branches, disrupting nutrient and water flow, leading to wilting and dieback of affected parts.
*   **Root-feeding Pests:** Nematodes or grubs can damage roots, impairing the tree's ability to absorb water and nutrients, causing general decline and drying symptoms.

### II. Management Strategies

**A. Diagnosis is Key:**
Before applying any treatment, it is crucial to accurately identify the specific cause.
*   **Observe Symptoms Carefully:** Note the pattern of drying, presence of cankers, ooze, insect holes, or specific leaf discoloration.
*   **Inspect Roots:** Gently excavate around the root collar to check for rot, damage, or pest activity.
*   **Soil Testing:** Conduct soil tests for nutrient deficiencies, pH, and salinity/sodicity.
*   **Consult Experts:** For definitive diagnosis, especially for diseases, it is highly recommended to contact the Department of Horticulture or Plant Pathology at HAU, Hisar, or your local Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK).

**B. General Horticultural Practices (Preventive & Supportive):**

1.  **Proper Irrigation:** Ensure consistent and adequate watering, especially during dry periods. Avoid both drought stress and waterlogging. Use drip irrigation for efficient water use.
2.  **Balanced Nutrition:** Based on soil test results, apply balanced fertilizers. Foliar sprays of micronutrients (e.g., Boron, Zinc) can address specific deficiencies.
3.  **Pruning:**
    *   Regularly remove dead, diseased, or weak branches.
    *   For suspected Fire Blight, prune at least 30-45 cm below the visible symptoms into healthy wood. Disinfect pruning tools with a 10% bleach solution or 70% alcohol between each cut to prevent disease spread.
4.  **Orchard Sanitation:** Remove and destroy fallen leaves, fruits, and pruned material to reduce inoculum sources for diseases and pests.
5.  **Weed Management:** Keep the area around the tree base free of weeds to reduce competition for water and nutrients.
6.  **Soil Health:** Improve soil structure and drainage by incorporating organic matter. For saline/sodic soils, apply **Gypsum** (Calcium sulphate) as per soil test recommendations and ensure proper leaching.

**C. Specific Management (Chemical & Cultural):**

1.  **For Fire Blight (Bacterial):**
    *   **Cultural:** Aggressive pruning of infected parts (as described above) is the primary control.
    *   **Chemical (Preventive/Early Stage):**
        *   Apply **Streptomycin sulphate** at 100-200 ppm (100-200 mg/L) as a spray during bloom or early shoot growth.
        *   **Copper oxychloride** at 2.5-3.0 g/L water can be used as a protective spray before bloom or after pruning.
2.  **For Fungal Dieback/Canker Diseases:**
    *   **Cultural:** Prune out affected branches well into healthy wood.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   Apply a broad-spectrum fungicide as a protective spray or paint pruning wounds.
        *   **Carbendazim** at 1.0 g/L water.
        *   **Propiconazole** at 0.5 ml/L water.
        *   **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L water.
3.  **For Root Rot Diseases:**
    *   **Cultural:** Improve drainage, avoid waterlogging.
    *   **Chemical (Drench):**
        *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride** at 2.0-3.0 ml/L water as a soil drench around the root zone.
        *   **Metalaxyl** at 1.0-2.0 g/L water as a soil drench.
4.  **For Stem/Shoot Borers:**
    *   **Cultural:** Prune and destroy infested branches. Use wire to extract larvae from boreholes.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   Swab the affected trunk/branches with a solution of **Chlorpyrifos** at 2.0 ml/L water.
        *   Inject **Chlorpyrifos** (2.0 ml/L) into boreholes and plug with mud.
5.  **For Nutrient Deficiencies:**
    *   Apply specific micronutrient fertilizers based on soil and leaf analysis. For example, foliar spray of **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate) at 1.0 g/L water for Boron deficiency.

Remember, timely intervention and accurate identification of the problem are crucial for effective management and saving your pear trees.
