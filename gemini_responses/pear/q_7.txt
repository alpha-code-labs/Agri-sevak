As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Dieback, Twig blight, and Tikka disease in Pear in Haryana.

### Control of Dieback and Twig Blight in Pear

Dieback and Twig blight are common issues in pear, often caused by a combination of factors including fungal pathogens, bacterial pathogens, and environmental stresses. In Haryana, **Fire Blight** (caused by the bacterium *Erwinia amylovora*) is a significant concern and a primary cause of both dieback and twig blight symptoms.

**Symptoms:**
*   **Dieback:** Progressive death of twigs and branches, starting from the tips and moving downwards.
*   **Twig Blight:** Rapid browning and death of young shoots, flowers, and twigs, often giving a "scorched" appearance (characteristic of Fire Blight). Cankers may form on branches and trunks.

**Integrated Management Strategies:**

1.  **Cultural and Hygienic Practices:**
    *   **Pruning:** Regularly inspect trees and promptly prune out all affected branches, cutting well into healthy wood (at least 15-30 cm below the visible symptom). Make sure to sterilize pruning tools (e.g., with a 10% bleach solution or 70% alcohol) between each cut to prevent the spread of disease, especially for Fire Blight.
    *   **Sanitation:** Collect and destroy all pruned material by burning or deep burial. Do not leave infected material in the orchard.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, as it promotes succulent growth that is highly susceptible to Fire Blight. Maintain balanced nutrition.
    *   **Wound Protection:** Protect trees from mechanical injuries. Apply Bordeaux paste or a copper-based fungicide to large pruning cuts to prevent pathogen entry.
    *   **Resistant Varieties:** Where feasible, consider planting pear varieties known for their resistance or tolerance to Fire Blight.

2.  **Chemical Control:**
    *   **For Bacterial Blight (Fire Blight):**
        *   During bloom and active growth periods, especially if conditions are warm and humid, apply:
            *   **Streptomycin Sulphate 90% + Tetracycline Hydrochloride 10% SP** at 0.5 g/L of water. Apply at 7-10 day intervals, particularly during flowering and rapid shoot growth.
    *   **For Fungal Dieback/Twig Blight:**
        *   As a preventive measure or at the first sign of fungal dieback, apply:
            *   **Copper Oxychloride 50% WP** at 3 g/L of water.
            *   Alternatively, **Mancozeb 75% WP** at 2.5 g/L of water.
        *   These fungicides can be applied post-harvest, during dormancy, or during the growing season if fungal issues are prevalent, ensuring adherence to proper spray intervals and pre-harvest intervals.

### Tikka Disease in Pear

This is not known to affect Pear. Tikka disease is a common leaf spot disease primarily affecting groundnut (peanut), caused by *Cercospora arachidicola* and *Cercosporidium personatum*.
