As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the maturity signs, harvesting time, and cutting process for Pear cultivation in Haryana:

### Maturity Signs for Pear

Pears are climacteric fruits, meaning they continue to ripen after harvest. They are typically harvested when physiologically mature but still firm and green, before they fully ripen on the tree. Key maturity signs include:

*   **Skin Colour Change:** The most common indicator is a subtle change in the ground colour of the fruit from a dark green to a lighter green or yellowish-green, depending on the variety. Some varieties may develop a slight blush.
*   **Firmness:** The fruit should be firm to the touch but not hard. A penetrometer reading (for commercial growers) is ideal, typically ranging from 6.0 to 8.0 kg/cm² for most varieties at harvest.
*   **Ease of Separation:** When gently lifted and twisted upwards, the fruit should separate easily from the spur with the stem intact. If it requires a hard pull, it is not ready. If it drops too easily, it might be overripe.
*   **Lenticels:** The small dots (lenticels) on the fruit surface become more prominent and corky.
*   **Starch Disappearance (Commercial):** For precise commercial harvesting, a starch-iodine test can be used. As the fruit matures, starch converts to sugar, and the pattern of starch disappearance (indicated by iodine staining) provides a reliable index of physiological maturity.

### Harvesting Time for Pear

The optimal harvesting time for pears in Haryana largely depends on the specific variety being cultivated. Generally, pear harvesting in the region occurs from **July to September**.

*   **Early Varieties:** Varieties like 'Patharnakh' and 'Punjab Beauty' are typically ready for harvest from **mid-July to August**.
*   **Mid to Late Varieties:** Varieties such as 'Baggugosha' and 'Kieffer' may extend their harvest period from **August to September**.

It is crucial to note that all fruits on a single tree do not mature simultaneously. Therefore, harvesting is usually done in **2-3 pickings** over a period of 7-10 days to ensure optimal maturity for all fruits. Harvesting should ideally be done during the cooler parts of the day, such as early morning or late afternoon, to minimize field heat and maintain fruit quality.

### Cutting Process for Pear

The cutting process is critical to prevent damage to the fruit, the tree, and to ensure good post-harvest quality.

*   **Tools:** Always use sharp, clean **pruning shears or specialized fruit clippers**. Avoid using bare hands to pull the fruit, as this can damage the fruit spur, leading to reduced future yields, or cause stem-end tears on the fruit.
*   **Technique:**
    1.  Gently grasp the fruit in one hand.
    2.  With the other hand, position the clippers to cut the stem cleanly, leaving approximately **1-2 cm of stem attached** to the fruit. This stem piece is vital as it helps prevent stem-end rot and reduces moisture loss during storage.
    3.  Carefully place the harvested fruit into padded baskets or containers. **Never drop or throw the fruit**, as pears are highly susceptible to bruising, which can lead to rapid spoilage.
    4.  Avoid overfilling containers to prevent crushing the lower layers of fruit.
*   **Post-Harvest Handling:** Immediately after harvesting, move the fruits to a cool, shaded area. For prolonged storage, pears require prompt cooling and transfer to cold storage facilities, as they ripen quickly at ambient temperatures.
