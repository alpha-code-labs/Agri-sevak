As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I will provide scientifically verified advice for managing the mentioned conditions in Pear orchards in Haryana.

Here's how to address each concern:

### 1. Grasshopper

Grasshoppers are polyphagous pests and can feed on the foliage and young fruits of pear trees, especially during outbreaks.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural/Mechanical Control:**
    *   Regular monitoring of the orchard, especially during the monsoon season.
    *   Hand-picking of nymphs and adults in small orchards.
    *   Deep ploughing after harvest can expose and destroy eggs laid in the soil.
*   **Chemical Control (if infestation is severe):**
    *   Spray with:
        *   **Malathion** 50% EC at 2.0 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 0.5 ml per litre of water.

### 2. Painted Bug

This is not known to affect Pear. Painted bug (Bagrada hilaris) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops like mustard, cabbage, and cauliflower.

### 3. Red Cotton Bug

This is not known to affect Pear. Red cotton bug (Dysdercus cingulatus) is a major pest of cotton and other malvaceous plants.

### 4. Black Ants

Black ants are generally not direct pests of pear trees, but they can be indirect pests by:
*   Farming and protecting honeydew-producing insects like aphids, mealybugs, and scale insects, which are direct pests of pear.
*   Nesting at the base of trees, potentially causing minor root disturbance.
*   Entering ripe or damaged fruits.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural/Mechanical Control:**
    *   Maintain orchard hygiene by removing weeds and debris that can harbor ants.
    *   Apply sticky bands around the tree trunk to prevent ants from climbing up and accessing honeydew-producing pests.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Control of Associated Sucking Pests:** The most effective way to manage ants in an orchard is to control the honeydew-producing pests (aphids, mealybugs, scale insects) they are associated with.
        *   For aphids/mealybugs:
            *   Spray with **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL at 0.5 ml per litre of water.
            *   Spray with **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG at 0.3 g per litre of water.
    *   **Direct Ant Control (if nests are problematic at the base of trees):**
        *   Drench the soil around the tree base with **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 2.5 ml per litre of water (use 1-2 litres of solution per tree, depending on tree size). This helps in destroying nests and deterring ants.
