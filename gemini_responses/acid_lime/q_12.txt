Scale insects and mealybugs are common and economically significant sucking pests of Acid Lime (Citrus aurantifolia) in Haryana. They feed on plant sap, leading to reduced vigor, yellowing of leaves, defoliation, stunted growth, and poor fruit quality. They also excrete honeydew, which promotes the growth of black sooty mould, further hindering photosynthesis. Effective management requires an integrated approach.

**I. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**

*   **Regular Monitoring:** Frequently inspect plants, especially the undersides of leaves, stems, and fruit, to detect infestations early.
*   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy heavily infested branches, twigs, and leaves. This reduces pest populations and improves air circulation within the canopy.
*   **Water Jet:** For small infestations of mealybugs, a strong stream of water can physically dislodge them from the plant surface.
*   **Ant Management:** Control ants, as they protect mealybugs and scales from natural enemies in exchange for honeydew. Apply sticky bands on tree trunks or use ant baits around the base of the tree.
*   **Weed Control:** Keep the orchard free of weeds, which can act as alternate hosts for these pests.

**II. Biological Control:**

*   Encourage natural enemies such as ladybird beetles (e.g., *Cryptolaemus montrouzieri* for mealybugs), parasitic wasps, and lacewings. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

**III. Chemical Control (for severe infestations):**

When cultural and biological methods are insufficient, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and in crevices where pests hide.

**A. For Scale Insects:**

*   **Horticultural Mineral Oil (HMO) / Paraffinic Oil:**
    *   Apply **Horticultural Mineral Oil** at 15-20 ml per liter of water. This suffocates scales, particularly effective against crawlers and young nymphs. Repeat application after 15-20 days if needed.
*   **Systemic Insecticides:**
    *   **Buprofezin** 25% SC: Apply **Buprofezin** at 1.25 ml per liter of water (500 ml per acre in 400 L water). This is an insect growth regulator effective against nymphs by disrupting their molting process.
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: Apply **Imidacloprid** at 0.5 ml per liter of water (200 ml per acre in 400 L water).
    *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: Apply **Thiamethoxam** at 0.25 g per liter of water (100 g per acre in 400 L water).
*   **Contact Insecticides (for crawler stage):**
    *   **Malathion** 50% EC: Apply **Malathion** at 2 ml per liter of water (800 ml per acre in 400 L water). Best applied when the mobile crawler stage is active.

**B. For Mealybugs:**

*   **Horticultural Mineral Oil (HMO) / Paraffinic Oil:**
    *   Apply **Horticultural Mineral Oil** at 15-20 ml per liter of water. This helps in suffocating mealybugs.
*   **Botanical Insecticides:**
    *   **Azadirachtin** (Neem Oil based formulation) 1500 ppm: Apply **Azadirachtin** at 5 ml per liter of water. Effective against early instars and acts as a repellent and antifeedant.
*   **Systemic Insecticides:**
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: Apply **Imidacloprid** at 0.5 ml per liter of water (200 ml per acre in 400 L water).
    *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: Apply **Thiamethoxam** at 0.25 g per liter of water (100 g per acre in 400 L water).
    *   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP: Apply **Acetamiprid** at 0.2 g per liter of water (80 g per acre in 400 L water).
*   **Insect Growth Regulator:**
    *   **Buprofezin** 25% SC: Apply **Buprofezin** at 1.25 ml per liter of water (500 ml per acre in 400 L water). Effective against mealybug nymphs.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Timing of Application:** For scale insects, chemical sprays are most effective against the crawler stage (young, mobile nymphs) which are not protected by a waxy covering. For mealybugs, early detection and treatment of young colonies are crucial.
*   **Rotation of Chemicals:** To prevent the development of pesticide resistance, rotate insecticides with different modes of action.
*   **Thorough Coverage:** Ensure complete coverage of the plant, including the undersides of leaves and stem junctions, as these pests often hide in protected areas.
*   **Safety Precautions:** Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label. Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and application.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Observe the specified pre-harvest interval for each chemical to ensure fruit safety.

An integrated approach, combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods, will provide the most sustainable and effective control of scale insects and mealybugs in Acid Lime orchards in Haryana.
