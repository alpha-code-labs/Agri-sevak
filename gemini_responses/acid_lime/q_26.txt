As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified information on specialized practices for Acid Lime (Citrus aurantifolia) cultivation in Haryana:

### Specialized Practices in Acid Lime

**1. Pruning**

Pruning is essential for shaping the tree, maintaining its health, improving air circulation, sunlight penetration, and optimizing fruit production.

*   **Training Pruning (Initial Years):**
    *   During the first 2-3 years, focus on establishing a strong framework. An open-center system is generally preferred for Acid Lime to allow good light penetration and air circulation.
    *   Remove shoots below the graft union (suckers) promptly.
    *   Select 3-5 well-spaced primary branches to form the main scaffold, originating at about 60-75 cm from the ground.
    *   Remove any weak, crossing, or inward-growing branches.
*   **Maintenance Pruning (Mature Trees):**
    *   **Timing:** Best done after harvest, typically in late winter (January-February) or early spring before the new flush, or during the monsoon season (July-August) for light pruning. Avoid heavy pruning during flowering or fruiting.
    *   **Objective:** Remove dead, diseased, damaged, or broken branches. Eliminate water sprouts (vigorous upright shoots) and suckers from the rootstock. Thin out dense canopy to improve light and air circulation, which helps in reducing pest and disease incidence.
    *   **Wound Care:** For larger cuts (more than 2 cm diameter), apply a fungicidal paste to prevent entry of pathogens. A paste can be made using:
        *   **Carbendazim** (50% WP) at 20 g per litre of water, mixed with a sticker or cow dung.
        *   **Copper oxychloride** (50% WP) at 30 g per litre of water, mixed with a sticker or cow dung.
*   **Rejuvenation Pruning:** For old, unproductive trees, severe pruning can be done to stimulate new growth, but this is a drastic measure and should be carefully considered.

**2. Desuckering**

Desuckering is the practice of removing unwanted shoots (suckers) that arise from the rootstock below the graft union or from the base of the scion.

*   **Importance:** Suckers are vigorous and compete with the main scion for water and nutrients, weakening the desired fruiting part of the tree and reducing yield. Rootstock suckers will produce fruits of the rootstock, which are usually inferior.
*   **Method:** Regularly inspect trees and remove suckers as soon as they appear. They should be torn off or cut cleanly as close to the trunk or branch as possible. Tearing is often preferred for rootstock suckers as it removes the dormant buds at the base, reducing regrowth.

**3. Mulching**

Mulching involves covering the soil surface around the tree with organic or inorganic materials. It is a highly beneficial practice for Acid Lime, especially in the climatic conditions of Haryana.

*   **Benefits:**
    *   **Moisture Conservation:** Reduces evaporation from the soil surface, crucial in arid and semi-arid regions.
    *   **Weed Suppression:** Prevents weed growth, reducing competition for water and nutrients.
    *   **Temperature Regulation:** Keeps soil temperature more stable, protecting roots from extreme heat or cold.
    *   **Soil Health:** Organic mulches decompose, adding organic matter and improving soil structure, fertility, and microbial activity.
*   **Materials:**
    *   **Organic Mulches:** Dry leaves, straw, paddy husk, sugarcane trash, farmyard manure (FYM), compost.
    *   **Inorganic Mulches:** Black polyethylene film (plastic mulch).
*   **Application:**
    *   Apply a layer of 10-15 cm thickness of organic mulch around the tree, extending to the drip line.
    *   Keep the mulch material a few inches (10-15 cm) away from the tree trunk to prevent collar rot and pest infestation.
    *   For plastic mulch, lay it on a well-prepared bed and secure the edges.

**4. Grafting**

Grafting is the primary method for commercial propagation of Acid Lime, combining the desirable traits of a rootstock with a scion of the desired variety.

*   **Purpose:**
    *   To propagate true-to-type plants.
    *   To impart desirable characteristics from the rootstock, such as disease resistance (e.g., against gummosis, tristeza), drought tolerance, salinity tolerance, and vigor control.
    *   To rejuvenate old or unproductive trees.
*   **Common Methods:** T-budding (shield budding) and Forkert budding are most commonly used for citrus. Veneer grafting and cleft grafting can also be employed.
*   **Rootstocks for Haryana:**
    *   **Rough Lemon (Citrus jambhiri):** Widely used for its vigor, drought tolerance, and adaptability to various soil types.
    *   **Rangpur Lime (Citrus limonia):** Offers good vigor and tolerance to drought and salinity.
    *   **Karna Khatta (Citrus karna):** Known for its tolerance to salinity and alkalinity, which can be beneficial in some parts of Haryana.
*   **Timing:** Grafting is best performed when the sap is flowing freely, typically during spring (February-March) or the monsoon season (July-September).
*   **Procedure:** A healthy bud (scion) from a desired Acid Lime variety is inserted into a compatible rootstock seedling. The union is then tied securely with grafting tape until it heals.

**5. Pollination**

Acid Lime (Citrus aurantifolia) exhibits specific pollination characteristics that influence fruit set.

*   **Self-Fertility and Parthenocarpy:** Acid Lime is generally considered **self-fertile**, meaning it can set fruit with its own pollen. Furthermore, it is often **parthenocarpic**, meaning it can produce fruit without fertilization, resulting in seedless or few-seeded fruits.
*   **Role of Pollinators:** While not strictly essential for fruit set due to its self-fertile and parthenocarpic nature, insect pollinators (primarily bees) can still contribute to improved fruit set and yield, especially in certain environmental conditions or for specific cultivars that might benefit from cross-pollination.
*   **Specialized Practices:** No specific specialized practices are typically required for pollination in Acid Lime due to its inherent ability to set fruit. However, maintaining a healthy orchard environment that supports natural pollinators (e.g., avoiding broad-spectrum pesticide application during flowering) is always a good agricultural practice to maximize overall productivity. Introduction of bee colonies is generally not a critical requirement for Acid Lime specifically, unlike many other fruit crops that are highly dependent on cross-pollination.
