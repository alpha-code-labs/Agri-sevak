As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following doses of organic manures for Acid Lime, which are crucial for improving soil health, nutrient availability, and overall plant vigor:

### Recommended Doses of Organic Manures for Acid Lime

**1. Farmyard Manure (FYM)**
Farmyard manure is an excellent source of organic matter and essential nutrients, improving soil structure and water retention.

*   **Young Plants (1-3 years):** 10-20 kg per plant per year.
*   **Bearing Plants (4 years and above):** 25-50 kg per plant per year.

**Application:** Apply FYM evenly around the tree basin, within the drip line, preferably before the monsoon season (June-July) or during autumn (September-October). Lightly incorporate it into the topsoil.

**2. Vermicompost**
Vermicompost is richer in nutrients and beneficial microorganisms compared to FYM, promoting better nutrient uptake and plant growth.

*   **Young Plants (1-3 years):** 2-5 kg per plant per year.
*   **Bearing Plants (4 years and above):** 5-10 kg per plant per year.

**Application:** Similar to FYM, spread vermicompost around the tree basin and lightly mix it with the soil. It can be applied in split doses, for example, half before monsoon and half in autumn.

**3. Sagarika (Seaweed Extract based bio-stimulant)**
Sagarika is a bio-stimulant derived from red and brown seaweeds, known to enhance plant growth, flowering, fruit set, and stress tolerance.

*   **Foliar Spray:**
    *   Mix **Sagarika** at a concentration of 2-3 ml per litre of water.
    *   Spray thoroughly to cover the foliage, ensuring both upper and lower leaf surfaces are wetted.
*   **Soil Drench/Drip Application:**
    *   For mature trees, apply **Sagarika** at 10-20 ml per plant, mixed with irrigation water.
    *   Alternatively, for larger areas, 500 ml to 1 litre per acre can be applied through drip irrigation or as a soil drench.

**Application Timing:**
*   Apply **Sagarika** during critical growth stages:
    *   Pre-flowering stage (just before flower bud initiation).
    *   Fruit set stage (after fruit formation).
    *   Fruit development stage (during fruit enlargement).
*   Repeat applications can be done at 20-30 day intervals as needed, typically 2-3 applications per season.

**General Recommendation:**
It is advisable to get your soil tested periodically to understand its nutrient status and organic carbon content. This will help in fine-tuning the exact doses of organic and inorganic fertilizers for optimal plant health and yield.
