Namaste, as a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the critical need to protect your Acid Lime (Kagzi Nimbu) plants from the challenging environmental stresses prevalent in Haryana. Here is scientifically verified advice to safeguard your crop:

### 1. Protection from Extreme Cold and Frost

Acid Lime is sensitive to cold and frost, which can cause significant damage to young shoots, leaves, and even entire plants.

*   **Irrigation:** A light irrigation of the orchard before a predicted frost event is crucial. Wet soil absorbs more solar radiation during the day and releases latent heat slowly at night, keeping the soil and surrounding air warmer.
*   **Mulching:** Apply a thick layer (10-15 cm) of organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves, sugarcane trash) around the base of young plants. This insulates the soil, protects the root zone from freezing, and conserves soil moisture.
*   **Covering Young Plants:** For young plants (up to 3-4 years old), individual covers made of straw, gunny bags, or plastic sheets supported by stakes can provide significant protection. Ensure covers do not touch the foliage directly. Remove covers during warm daytime hours to allow for photosynthesis and air circulation.
*   **Windbreaks:** Planting taller, dense trees (e.g., *Casuarina equisetifolia*, *Populus deltoides*) as windbreaks on the northern and western sides of the orchard can reduce the impact of cold, dry winds.
*   **Smoke/Smudge Fires:** In larger orchards, creating smoke on the upwind side during frost nights can help by trapping heat and preventing radiative heat loss, but this requires careful management and monitoring.
*   **Chemical Intervention:**
    *   **Foliar Spray (Anti-transpirant/Reflectant):** Apply **Kaolin clay** at 50 g/L of water as a foliar spray. This forms a reflective white film on the leaves, reducing radiative heat loss from the plant surface and offering some protection against frost damage. Reapply if washed off by rain.
    *   **Foliar Spray (Nutrient Support):** A foliar spray of **Potassium Nitrate** at 10 g/L of water can enhance the plant's physiological tolerance to cold stress by improving cell sap concentration and overall plant vigor. Apply 7-10 days before the anticipated cold wave.

### 2. Protection from Heat (Loo) and Intense Sunlight

High temperatures, hot dry winds (Loo), and intense sunlight can lead to sunburn, desiccation, leaf scorching, and fruit drop.

*   **Irrigation:** Maintain optimal soil moisture through regular and adequate irrigation, especially during peak summer months. Drip irrigation is highly efficient in delivering water directly to the root zone, minimizing evaporation.
*   **Mulching:** A thick layer of organic mulch helps conserve soil moisture, reduces soil temperature fluctuations, and keeps the root zone cooler.
*   **Shade Nets:** For young plants, installing 30-50% shade nets can significantly reduce heat stress, leaf scorching, and sunburn, promoting better establishment and growth.
*   **Trunk Whitewashing:** Paint the main trunk and lower scaffold branches with a lime wash (calcium carbonate solution). This reflects sunlight, prevents sunscald on the bark, and reduces trunk temperature.
*   **Windbreaks:** Establish dense windbreaks around the orchard to reduce the desiccating effect of hot winds (Loo), which can cause rapid water loss from the plants.
*   **Chemical Intervention:**
    *   **Foliar Spray (Reflectant):** Apply **Kaolin clay** at 50 g/L of water as a foliar spray. This creates a reflective barrier on the leaves, reducing leaf temperature by several degrees, thereby minimizing sunburn, heat stress, and water loss through transpiration. Reapply every 15-20 days or after heavy rains during peak summer.
    *   **Foliar Spray (Nutrient Support):** A foliar spray of **Potassium Nitrate** at 10 g/L of water can improve the plant's ability to cope with heat stress by regulating water balance, enhancing stomatal control, and improving overall physiological resilience. Apply during periods of anticipated high temperatures.

By implementing these scientifically backed practices, you can significantly mitigate the adverse effects of environmental stresses on your Acid Lime crop, ensuring healthier plants and better yields.
