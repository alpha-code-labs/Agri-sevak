As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the challenges posed by sucking pests in Acid Lime cultivation. Effective management requires an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods.

Sucking pests like Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, Thrips, and Psylla can cause significant damage by feeding on plant sap, leading to stunted growth, leaf curling, premature fruit drop, and transmission of viral diseases (e.g., Citrus Greening/HLB by Psylla).

Here's a scientifically verified approach for their control in Acid Lime in Haryana:

**I. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategy:**

1.  **Regular Monitoring:** Inspect young flushes, leaves (especially undersides), and flowers regularly for pest presence and population build-up. Early detection is key.
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Pruning:** Remove water sprouts and diseased/infested branches to improve air circulation and reduce pest harborage.
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the orchard floor free of weeds, as they can host alternative pest populations.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can promote lush, succulent growth attractive to sucking pests.
    *   **Water Management:** Ensure proper irrigation to maintain plant vigor, as stressed plants are more susceptible.
3.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Conserve and encourage natural enemies such as ladybird beetles, lacewings, hoverflies, and parasitic wasps (e.g., *Tamarixia radiata* for Psylla). Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.
    *   Consider releasing commercially available biological control agents if feasible and recommended by local experts.

**II. Chemical Control (When pest populations exceed economic threshold levels):**

When pest populations are high and causing economic damage, judicious application of CIBRC-approved insecticides is necessary. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development. Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves.

**For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, Thrips, and Psylla:**

*   **Systemic Insecticides (for early stages and persistent control):**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at 0.5-1.0 ml per liter of water (or 200-250 ml per acre in 400-500 liters of water). Effective against a broad range of sucking pests, including Psylla.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at 0.2-0.4 g per liter of water (or 100-200 g per acre in 400-500 liters of water). Another excellent systemic option for multiple sucking pests.
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply at 0.2-0.4 g per liter of water (or 100-200 g per acre in 400-500 liters of water). Good for rotation with other neonicotinoids.
    *   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:** Apply at 0.75 ml per liter of water (or 300 ml per acre in 400 liters of water). Provides excellent systemic control against whiteflies, aphids, thrips, and psylla.

*   **Contact/Translaminar Insecticides (for quick knockdown and specific pests):**
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at 1.25-1.5 ml per liter of water (or 500-600 ml per acre in 400-500 liters of water). Highly effective against nymphs of whiteflies and psylla, acting as an insect growth regulator.
    *   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** Apply at 0.5-0.75 ml per liter of water (or 200-300 ml per acre in 400-500 liters of water). Effective against whiteflies and thrips, with some activity on mites.
    *   **Flonicamid 50% WG:** Apply at 0.3 g per liter of water (or 120 g per acre in 400 liters of water). A selective feeding blocker, very effective against aphids and whiteflies.
    *   **Dimethoate 30% EC:** Apply at 1.0-1.5 ml per liter of water (or 400-600 ml per acre in 400-500 liters of water). A broad-spectrum organophosphate, effective against many sucking pests.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** Apply at 0.5-0.75 ml per liter of water (or 200-300 ml per acre in 400-500 liters of water). Provides quick knockdown against a wide range of sucking pests.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Spray Timing:** Apply insecticides during periods of active pest infestation, typically coinciding with new flushes of growth which are most attractive to these pests.
*   **Resistance Management:** Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action (different chemical groups) to prevent the development of pesticide resistance. Do not use the same chemical or chemicals from the same group repeatedly.
*   **Safety:** Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label, including dosage, safety precautions, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and proper disposal. Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).
*   **Adjuvants:** Consider adding a non-ionic spreader/sticker to the spray solution to improve coverage and efficacy, especially on waxy leaves.
*   **Local Advice:** Consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for the most current recommendations tailored to your specific farm conditions and pest pressure.

By implementing these measures, you can effectively manage sucking pests in your Acid Lime orchard and ensure healthy plant growth and good yields.
