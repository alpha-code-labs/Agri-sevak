As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Dieback, Twig Blight, and Tikka disease in Acid Lime in Haryana.

### Control of Dieback and Twig Blight in Acid Lime

Dieback and Twig Blight are common problems in Acid Lime, often caused by a complex of factors including fungal pathogens (e.g., *Colletotrichum gloeosporioides*, *Lasiodiplodia theobromae*), nutrient deficiencies, and environmental stresses. Effective management requires an integrated approach.

**1. Cultural and Horticultural Practices:**

*   **Pruning:** Regularly inspect trees and promptly remove all dead, diseased, and weak twigs and branches. Prune back to healthy wood, making clean, slanting cuts. Disinfect pruning tools with a 1% sodium hypochlorite solution (bleach) or 70% alcohol between cuts to prevent the spread of pathogens.
*   **Orchard Sanitation:** Collect and destroy all pruned material and fallen diseased leaves/twigs from the orchard floor to reduce the source of inoculum.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to allow for good air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce humidity and fungal growth.
*   **Wound Protection:** After pruning, apply a protective fungicidal paste to larger cut surfaces. A paste made from **Copper Oxychloride** 50 WP (50 g per litre of water) or Bordeaux paste can be used.

**2. Nutrient Management:**

*   **Balanced Fertilization:** Ensure the trees receive a balanced diet of macro and micronutrients based on soil test reports. Deficiencies, particularly of Zinc, Manganese, and Iron, can predispose trees to dieback.
*   **Foliar Sprays:** Apply foliar sprays of micronutrients if deficiencies are identified. For example, a spray containing Zinc sulphate (0.5%) + Manganese sulphate (0.5%) + Ferrous sulphate (0.5%) along with lime (0.25%) can be beneficial.

**3. Water Management:**

*   **Adequate Irrigation:** Provide timely and adequate irrigation, especially during dry periods, to prevent water stress.
*   **Avoid Waterlogging:** Ensure proper drainage to avoid waterlogging, which can lead to root rot and exacerbate dieback symptoms.

**4. Chemical Control (Fungicides):**

Foliar sprays should be initiated at the first sign of symptoms or as a preventive measure during periods conducive to disease development (e.g., post-monsoon or during high humidity). Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

*   Spray with **Carbendazim** 50 WP at 0.5-1.0 g/L of water.
*   Alternatively, spray with **Mancozeb** 75 WP at 2.5 g/L of water.
*   Another effective option is **Copper Oxychloride** 50 WP at 3.0 g/L of water.
*   Repeat sprays at 15-20 day intervals, depending on disease severity and environmental conditions.

### Tikka Disease in Acid Lime

This is not known to affect Acid Lime. Tikka disease is a well-known leaf spot disease primarily affecting groundnut (peanut) crops, caused by *Cercospora arachidicola* and *Cercosporidium personatum*.
