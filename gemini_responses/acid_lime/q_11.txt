Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling beetles and weevils in Acid Lime (Citrus aurantifolia) in Haryana.

**Control of Beetles and Weevils in Acid Lime:**

Beetles and weevils can cause significant damage to Acid Lime by feeding on leaves, flowers, fruits, and even boring into stems and roots. Effective management involves a combination of cultural practices and judicious use of CIBRC-approved insecticides.

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**

*   **Orchard Sanitation:** Regularly remove fallen fruits, leaves, and plant debris from the orchard, as these can harbor pests.
*   **Pruning:** Remove any dead, diseased, or infested branches, especially those showing signs of stem borer activity.
*   **Hand Picking:** For larger beetles and weevils, especially during early morning or late evening, hand-picking and destroying them can be effective in small orchards.
*   **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your trees for signs of pest activity, such as chewed leaves, boreholes, or adult insects. Early detection is key to effective control.
*   **Physical Barriers:** For stem borers, wrapping the base of young trees with a physical barrier can sometimes deter egg-laying.

**2. Chemical Control (Use only CIBRC approved chemicals):**

When pest incidence is high and cultural methods are insufficient, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always follow label instructions for dosage, application method, and safety precautions.

*   **For Leaf-feeding Beetles and Weevils (Adults):**
    *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC:** Apply at a rate of 2.5 - 3.0 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** Apply at a rate of 0.5 - 1.0 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Cypermethrin 25% EC:** Apply at a rate of 0.5 - 1.0 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** While primarily for sucking pests, it can also be effective against some leaf-feeding beetles and weevils. Apply at a rate of 0.5 - 0.75 ml per litre of water.

*   **For Stem Borers (e.g., Citrus Longhorn Beetle):**
    *   Locate the boreholes and inject a solution of **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** (2.5 - 3.0 ml per litre of water) directly into the holes using a syringe. Plug the holes with mud or cotton after injection.
    *   Alternatively, use a cotton swab soaked in **Dichlorvos 76% EC** and insert it into the boreholes, then plug the holes.

*   **For Root Weevils (Larvae):**
    *   Soil drenching around the base of affected trees with **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** at a higher concentration (e.g., 5 ml per litre of water, ensuring adequate soil moisture) can help control larvae.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Timing:** Apply insecticides when pests are most active and vulnerable, typically during their larval or early adult stages.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and within the canopy.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always observe the specified pre-harvest interval for any insecticide used to ensure the safety of the fruit for consumption.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pest resistance.

**Regarding Sawflies:**

This is not known to affect Acid Lime.
