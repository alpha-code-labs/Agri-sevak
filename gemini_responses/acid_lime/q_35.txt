As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the maturity signs, harvesting time, and cutting process for Acid Lime (Kagzi Nimbu) in Haryana:

### Maturity Signs for Acid Lime:

Acid lime fruits are typically harvested when they reach physiological maturity, which is indicated by several factors:

*   **Colour Change:** The most prominent sign is the change in peel colour from dark green to a lighter green, eventually turning yellowish-green. While fully yellow limes are mature, they may have a shorter shelf life and slightly reduced acidity, which is often undesirable for lime.
*   **Size:** Fruits attain their characteristic size and shape for the specific variety.
*   **Firmness:** The fruit should feel firm and turgid, not soft or shrivelled.
*   **Juice Content:** Mature limes will have a high juice content, typically 45-55% or more by weight.
*   **Acidity:** The juice will have the characteristic tartness, indicating optimal acid development.
*   **Specific Gravity:** Mature fruits tend to sink in water or have a specific gravity close to 1.0.

### Harvesting Time for Acid Lime:

Acid lime trees in Haryana typically bear fruit almost throughout the year, but there are distinct peak seasons:

*   **Main Season:** The primary harvesting season is usually from **April to July**, coinciding with the hot summer months when demand for limes is high.
*   **Secondary Season:** A smaller flush of fruits can also be harvested during **September to November**.
*   **Frequency:** During peak seasons, harvesting is done every **10-15 days** as fruits mature. In off-seasons, it might be less frequent.
*   **Optimal Stage:** Harvest when fruits are light green to yellowish-green, firm, and have reached their full size and juice content. Harvesting too early results in low juice yield and high acidity, while harvesting too late can lead to softening, reduced shelf life, and susceptibility to pests/diseases.

### Cutting Process for Acid Lime:

Proper harvesting technique is crucial to prevent damage to the fruit and the tree, ensuring better post-harvest quality and future yields.

*   **Tools:** Use sharp, clean harvesting shears, clippers, or a specialized harvesting knife. Avoid using bare hands to pull the fruit.
*   **Technique:**
    *   Cut the fruit with a small piece of the stem (calyx) attached. This prevents injury to the fruit's skin at the point of detachment, which can be an entry point for pathogens causing rot and decay.
    *   Make a clean cut, avoiding tearing the fruit skin or damaging the twig.
    *   Do not pull the fruit directly from the branch, as this can damage the fruit stem-end and the fruiting spur, affecting subsequent flowering and fruiting.
*   **Handling:** Gently place the harvested fruits into clean baskets or crates. Avoid dropping or throwing them, as bruising can significantly reduce shelf life and market value.
*   **Timing:** Harvest preferably during the cooler parts of the day (early morning or late afternoon) to minimize field heat and maintain fruit quality.
