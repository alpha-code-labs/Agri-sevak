Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding the "drying up" of Acid Lime plants. This is a common and serious symptom that can indicate various underlying issues, rather than being a single disease itself. Accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective management.

Here's a systematic approach to address drying up in Acid Lime:

**I. Initial Diagnosis: Observe and Identify the Root Cause**

Before applying any treatment, it is essential to carefully observe the plant and the orchard environment to pinpoint the exact cause. Consider the following:

1.  **Pattern of Drying:**
    *   Is it affecting the entire plant, or specific branches/twigs?
    *   Does it start from the tips of branches and progress downwards (dieback)?
    *   Are only leaves drying, or also flowers and fruits?
    *   Is it sudden or gradual?
2.  **Plant Parts Affected:**
    *   **Roots:** Are they healthy, or discolored, soft, or rotting?
    *   **Collar Region (base of the trunk):** Is there any gum exudation, bark cracking, or discoloration?
    *   **Trunk/Branches:** Are there any holes, cracks, cankers, or gumming?
    *   **Leaves:** Are there any spots, yellowing patterns, or unusual textures before drying?
3.  **Environmental Factors:**
    *   **Watering:** Is there under-watering (drought stress) or over-watering (waterlogging leading to root rot)?
    *   **Soil:** Is the soil well-drained? Is there any visible salinity (white crust)?
    *   **Recent Weather:** Has there been extreme heat, cold, or strong winds?
    *   **Nutrient Status:** Are there any signs of nutrient deficiencies (e.g., yellowing patterns)?

**II. Potential Causes and Management Strategies**

Based on your observations, the drying up could be due to one or more of the following:

**A. Abiotic Stresses (Non-living factors)**

1.  **Water Stress (Drought or Waterlogging):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Leaves wilt, turn yellow, then brown and dry. In drought, the entire plant may show symptoms. In waterlogging, roots rot, leading to similar above-ground symptoms.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Drought:** Provide adequate and timely irrigation, especially during dry periods and fruit development.
        *   **Waterlogging:** Improve soil drainage. Avoid over-watering. Create raised beds if necessary.
    *   *No direct chemical treatment for water stress itself.*

2.  **Nutrient Deficiencies/Toxicities:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Specific nutrient deficiencies (e.g., severe Potassium, Boron) can lead to leaf tip burn and dieback. Boron toxicity can also cause similar symptoms.
    *   **Management:** Conduct soil and leaf analysis to identify specific deficiencies or toxicities. Apply appropriate fertilizers as recommended by HAU.
    *   *No direct chemical for "drying up" here, but specific nutrient supplements would be used.*

3.  **Salinity/Alkalinity Stress:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Leaf margins and tips turn yellow, then brown and dry (burn). Stunted growth and eventual dieback.
    *   **Management:** Improve drainage, leach salts with good quality water, apply gypsum for sodic soils as per soil test recommendations.
    *   *No direct chemical treatment for salinity stress itself.*

**B. Biotic Stresses (Living organisms - Diseases and Pests)**

1.  **Gummosis / Foot Rot (Caused by *Phytophthora* species):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Gum exudation on the trunk near the soil line (collar region), bark decay, yellowing of leaves, and eventual drying of branches or the entire plant. Roots may also rot.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Avoid injury to the trunk. Ensure proper drainage. Avoid splashing soil onto the trunk during irrigation.
        *   Scrape off the infected bark and apply a paste of fungicide.
        *   **Chemicals:**
            *   Foliar spray: **Fosetyl-aluminium** (2.5 g/L of water)
            *   Soil drench around the collar region: **Propamocarb hydrochloride** (2-3 ml/L of water)
            *   Bark paste: **Copper oxychloride** (50 g in 100 ml of water, apply to scraped area)

2.  **Dieback (Caused by fungi like *Colletotrichum gloeosporioides* or *Lasiodiplodia theobromae*):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Twigs and branches dry from the tip downwards. Leaves turn dull green, then yellow, and finally dry and fall off. Often associated with stress (water, nutrient, pest damage).
    *   **Management:**
        *   Prune affected branches well below the dried portion, ensuring clean cuts. Burn or dispose of pruned material.
        *   Maintain plant vigour through proper nutrition and irrigation.
        *   **Chemicals:**
            *   Foliar spray after pruning: **Carbendazim** (0.5 g/L of water) or **Mancozeb** (2.5 g/L of water)
            *   Alternatively, **Copper oxychloride** (3 g/L of water) can be used.

3.  **Citrus Greening (HLB - Caused by *Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus*):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Blotchy mottle on leaves (asymmetrical yellowing), stunted growth, twig dieback, small, lopsided, bitter fruits. Eventually, the tree declines and dries up. This is a major threat in Haryana.
    *   **Management:**
        *   No known cure for the disease itself.
        *   Remove and destroy infected trees immediately to prevent spread.
        *   Control the vector, Citrus Psyllid (*Diaphorina citri*).
        *   **Chemicals (for Psyllid control):**
            *   **Imidacloprid** (0.3 ml/L of water)
            *   **Thiamethoxam** (0.25 g/L of water)
            *   Rotate insecticides to prevent resistance.

4.  **Bark-eating Caterpillar / Stem Borers:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Presence of boreholes on the trunk or branches, frass (excreta and wood particles) near the holes, and drying of branches above the damaged area due to disruption of sap flow.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Locate the boreholes.
        *   Insert a thin wire to kill the larva inside.
        *   Inject insecticide into the boreholes and plug with mud.
        *   **Chemicals:**
            *   Inject 2-5 ml of **Chlorpyrifos** or **Dichlorvos** into each borehole and seal with mud.

**III. General Management Practices for Prevention**

*   **Proper Nutrition:** Ensure balanced fertilization based on soil and leaf analysis.
*   **Timely Irrigation:** Provide adequate water, avoiding both drought and waterlogging.
*   **Pruning:** Regularly remove dead, diseased, or weak branches to improve air circulation and plant health.
*   **Weed Control:** Keep the orchard free of weeds that compete for nutrients and water.
*   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy diseased plant parts to reduce inoculum.
*   **Regular Monitoring:** Inspect your trees regularly for any early signs of stress, pests, or diseases.

**Recommendation:**

Given the complexity of "drying up" symptoms, I strongly advise you to carefully observe your Acid Lime plants based on the diagnostic steps above.
