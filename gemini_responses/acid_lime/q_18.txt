As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified doses for Growth Regulators and Boron in Acid Lime cultivation in Haryana:

It is crucial to ensure accurate measurement and uniform spray coverage for optimal results and to avoid phytotoxicity. Always use good quality water for spraying.

*   **Ethephon** (Commonly known by trade names like Ethrel)
    *   **CIBRC Approved Technical Name:** **Ethephon**
    *   **Purpose:** Primarily used for degreening and uniform ripening of fruits, leading to better market appeal. It can also be used for flower induction in some citrus varieties, but degreening is a more common application for Acid Lime.
    *   **Recommended Dose:** 250-500 ppm (parts per million) of active ingredient.
        *   For a typical 39% Soluble Liquid (SL) formulation of **Ethephon**:
            *   To achieve 250 ppm: Mix approximately 0.65 ml of product per litre of water.
            *   To achieve 500 ppm: Mix approximately 1.3 ml of product per litre of water.
    *   **Application:** Spray fruits 7-10 days before the anticipated harvest for degreening. Ensure thorough coverage of the fruits.

*   **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid** (Commonly known as 2,4-D)
    *   **CIBRC Approved Technical Name:** **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid**
    *   **Purpose:** To prevent pre-harvest fruit drop, thereby increasing marketable yield.
    *   **Recommended Dose:** 10-20 ppm (parts per million) of active ingredient.
        *   For an 80% Sodium Salt of **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid** formulation:
            *   To achieve 10 ppm: Mix approximately 0.0125 g of product per litre of water (or 1.25 g per 100 litres of water).
            *   To achieve 20 ppm: Mix approximately 0.025 g of product per litre of water (or 2.5 g per 100 litres of water).
    *   **Application:** Apply as a foliar spray 2-3 weeks before the anticipated period of fruit drop, or when fruits are at the pea-size stage.
    *   **Caution:** **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid** is a potent herbicide at higher concentrations. Extreme care must be taken to ensure accurate measurement to avoid phytotoxicity to the crop and damage to surrounding vegetation.

*   **Boron**
    *   **CIBRC Approved Technical Name:** **Boron** (applied through compounds like Borax or Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate)
    *   **Purpose:** Boron is an essential micronutrient vital for flowering, pollen viability, fruit set, and overall fruit development. Its deficiency can lead to symptoms like small, misshapen fruits, gumming, and dieback of shoots.
    *   **Recommended Dose:** Foliar spray.
        *   Using **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate, containing approximately 11.3% Boron): Mix 1-2 g per litre of water (0.1% - 0.2% solution).
        *   Using **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (e.g., Solubor, containing approximately 20.5% Boron): Mix 0.5-1 g per litre of water (0.05% - 0.1% solution).
    *   **Application:** Typically, two foliar sprays are beneficial:
        1.  At the pre-flowering stage (just before flower bud initiation).
        2.  After fruit set (when fruits are small).

Always consult with your local agricultural extension officer for specific timing and adjustments based on local soil conditions and crop phenology.
