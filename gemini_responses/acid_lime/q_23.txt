As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified recommendations for Acid Lime (Citrus aurantifolia) in Haryana.

**Seed Treatment for Acid Lime (Primarily for Rootstock Seeds):**

Acid Lime is typically propagated vegetatively (budding, grafting, air-layering) for commercial orchards to ensure genetic uniformity and early fruiting. However, seeds are used for raising rootstock. Seed treatment is crucial to protect against seed-borne pathogens and early seedling diseases like damping-off and root rot.

*   **Fungicidal Treatment:**
    *   Treat seeds with a systemic fungicide to protect against seed-borne fungi and early seedling diseases.
        *   **Carbendazim**: 1-2 grams per kilogram of seed.
        *   Alternatively, **Thiram**: 2-3 grams per kilogram of seed.
    *   Mix the fungicide thoroughly with the seeds just before sowing.
*   **Biological Treatment:**
    *   For enhanced protection and promotion of seedling vigor, treat seeds with a bio-fungicide after chemical treatment (or as a standalone if organic cultivation is preferred).
        *   **Trichoderma viride**: 4-5 grams per kilogram of seed.
    *   Mix the bio-agent with a small amount of water to form a slurry and coat the seeds evenly. Allow to dry in shade before sowing.

**Soil Treatment Process for Acid Lime:**

Soil treatment is vital for managing soil-borne diseases, nematodes, and improving overall soil health, both before planting and in established orchards.

**A. Pre-Planting Soil Treatment (Before establishing a new orchard):**

1.  **Soil Solarization (Optional but Recommended):**
    *   In summer, after deep ploughing and leveling, irrigate the field to field capacity.
    *   Cover the moist soil with a transparent polyethylene sheet (25-100 micron thickness) for 4-6 weeks. This helps in reducing populations of soil-borne pathogens, nematodes, and weeds by increasing soil temperature.
2.  **Organic Matter Incorporation:**
    *   Incorporate well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost at 10-15 tonnes per acre. This improves soil structure, water retention, and provides a substrate for beneficial microorganisms.
3.  **Biological Soil Treatment:**
    *   To suppress soil-borne fungal pathogens (e.g., *Phytophthora*, *Fusarium*) and nematodes:
        *   **Trichoderma viride**: 2.5 kilograms per acre, mixed with 50-100 kg of FYM or compost, and broadcast evenly before planting.
        *   **Pseudomonas fluorescens**: 2.5 kilograms per acre, mixed with 50-100 kg of FYM or compost, and broadcast evenly before planting.
        *   **Purpureocillium lilacinum** (for nematode management): 2.5 kilograms per acre, mixed with 50-100 kg of FYM or compost, and broadcast evenly before planting.
    *   These bio-agents should be applied when soil moisture is adequate.
4.  **Neem Cake Application:**
    *   Apply **Neem cake** at 200-400 kilograms per acre, mixed into the soil. Neem cake acts as a natural nematicide and provides slow-release nutrients.

**B. Soil Treatment in Established Acid Lime Orchards (Basin/Drench Application):**

1.  **For Phytophthora Root Rot Management:**
    *   **Metalaxyl-M**: Apply as a soil drench around the base of the affected trees at a concentration of 1-2 ml per liter of water. The quantity of drench depends on the tree size (e.g., 5-10 liters per tree). Repeat as per disease severity and label instructions.
    *   Alternatively, **Propamocarb hydrochloride**: Apply as a soil drench at a concentration of 2-3 ml per liter of water.
2.  **For General Soil-borne Fungal Diseases:**
    *   **Carbendazim**: Apply as a soil drench at 1-2 grams per liter of water around the tree basin.
3.  **Biological Soil Drench/Application:**
    *   Regular application of beneficial microorganisms helps maintain soil health and suppress pathogens.
        *   **Trichoderma viride**: 50-100 grams per plant, mixed with 1-2 kg of FYM or compost, applied annually in the root zone.
        *   **Pseudomonas fluorescens**: 50-100 grams per plant, mixed with 1-2 kg of FYM or compost, applied annually in the root zone.
4.  **Nematode Management:**
    *   **Neem cake**: Apply 2-4 kilograms per plant annually, spread evenly in the basin and lightly incorporated into the soil.
    *   **Purpureocillium lilacinum**: 50-100 grams per plant, mixed with FYM/compost, applied in the root zone.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label for specific dosage, application methods, and safety precautions.
*   Ensure proper soil moisture for optimal efficacy of biological agents.
*   Integrated Pest and Disease Management (IPDM) approach, combining cultural practices, biological control, and judicious use of chemicals, is always recommended for sustainable citrus production.
