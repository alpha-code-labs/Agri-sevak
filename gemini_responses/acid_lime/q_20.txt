Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the critical role of micronutrients in the healthy growth and productivity of Acid Lime (Kagzi Nimbu). Deficiencies can severely impact yield and fruit quality. The first and most crucial step is always to conduct a soil and leaf tissue analysis to accurately diagnose the specific deficiency and its severity. This ensures targeted and efficient application.

Here's how to address common micronutrient deficiencies in Acid Lime:

### General Recommendations for Micronutrient Application:

*   **Foliar Application:** Often preferred for quick correction of deficiencies, especially for mobile nutrients or when soil conditions (like high pH in Haryana) limit nutrient uptake. Apply sprays during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to maximize absorption and prevent leaf burn.
*   **Soil Application:** Provides a longer-term solution but can be less efficient in high pH soils for certain nutrients (e.g., Iron, Manganese, Zinc) due to fixation.
*   **Adjuvants:** Always consider adding a good quality non-ionic spreader/sticker to foliar sprays to improve coverage and absorption.

### Specific Micronutrient Deficiencies and Management:

1.  **Zinc (Zn) Deficiency:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Small, narrow leaves (little leaf), interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, short internodes, rosetting of leaves, reduced fruit size.
    *   **Correction:**
        *   **Foliar Spray:**
            *   **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** (ZnSO4.7H2O): 0.5% solution (5 g/L of water) mixed with 0.25% **Calcium Hydroxide** (hydrated lime) to neutralize acidity.
            *   **Zinc EDTA:** 0.1% solution (1 g/L of water).
            *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 15-20 day intervals during active growth.
        *   **Soil Application (for severe deficiency, based on soil test):**
            *   **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate**: 250-500 g per mature tree per year, applied in split doses around the root zone.

2.  **Iron (Fe) / Ferrous Deficiency:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Pronounced interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, with veins remaining distinctly green. In severe cases, entire leaves turn pale yellow or almost white, leading to stunted growth and reduced fruit set.
    *   **Correction:**
        *   **Foliar Spray:**
            *   **Ferrous Sulphate Heptahydrate** (FeSO4.7H2O): 0.5% solution (5 g/L of water) mixed with 0.25% **Calcium Hydroxide**.
            *   **Ferrous EDTA** or **Ferrous DTPA**: 0.1% solution (1 g/L of water). Chelated forms are highly effective, especially in alkaline soils.
            *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 15-day intervals.
        *   **Soil Application (less effective in high pH soils):**
            *   **Ferrous EDTA** or **Ferrous DTPA**: 20-50 g per mature tree per year, applied in the root zone.

3.  **Boron (B) Deficiency:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Dieback of young shoots, gum exudation from twigs and fruits, fruit cracking, hard and lumpy fruits with thick rind, internal gumming, misshapen fruits, premature fruit drop.
    *   **Correction:**
        *   **Foliar Spray:**
            *   **Borax** (Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate): 0.1% solution (1 g/L of water).
            *   **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (Solubor): 0.05% solution (0.5 g/L of water).
            *   Apply 1-2 sprays, especially before flowering and during fruit development.
        *   **Soil Application (use with caution, as excess boron is toxic):**
            *   **Borax**: 10-20 g per mature tree per year, based on soil test.

4.  **Calcium (Ca) Deficiency:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Dieback of young shoots, stunted growth, premature shedding of flowers and fruits, root tip necrosis. Often manifests as poor fruit quality (e.g., soft fruits, reduced shelf life).
    *   **Correction:**
        *   **Foliar Spray:**
            *   **Calcium Nitrate** (Ca(NO3)2): 0.5-1% solution (5-10 g/L of water).
            *   **Calcium Chloride** (CaCl2): 0.5% solution (5 g/L of water).
            *   Apply during fruit development stages.
        *   **Soil Application (if soil test indicates low calcium and/or low pH):**
            *   **Gypsum** (Calcium Sulphate Dihydrate): 1-2 kg per mature tree per year, especially beneficial in sodic/alkaline soils to improve soil structure and provide calcium.
            *   **Calcium Carbonate** (Agricultural Lime): If soil pH is low and calcium is deficient, apply as per soil test recommendations (often in kg/acre).

5.  **Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, starting from the tip and margins, forming an inverted 'V' shape with the base towards the petiole. In severe cases, leaves may drop prematurely.
    *   **Correction:**
        *   **Foliar Spray:**
            *   **Magnesium Sulphate Heptahydrate** (MgSO4.7H2O - Epsom salt): 0.5-1% solution (5-10 g/L of water).
            *   Apply 2-3 sprays during active growth, especially after fruit set.
        *   **Soil Application:**
            *   **Magnesium Sulphate Heptahydrate**: 100-200 g per mature tree per year, applied in the root zone.

6.  **Manganese (Mn) Deficiency:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, similar to iron deficiency but often less severe and with a finer network of green veins, giving a mottled appearance.
    *   **Correction:**
        *   **Foliar Spray:**
            *   **Manganese Sulphate Monohydrate** (MnSO4.H2O): 0.5% solution (5 g/L of water) mixed with 0.25% **Calcium Hydroxide**.
            *   **Manganese EDTA**: 0.1% solution (1 g/L of water).
            *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 15-day intervals.
        *   **Soil Application (less effective in high pH soils):**
            *   **Manganese Sulphate Monohydrate**: 50-100 g per mature tree per year.

**Important Note:** Always follow the recommended dosages. Over-application of micronutrients, especially Boron, can be toxic to plants. Regular soil and leaf analysis is key to sustainable and effective nutrient management. For any specific concerns, please consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts.
