As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling borers, caterpillars, and leaf folders in Acid Lime, based on CIBRC approved chemicals and practices suitable for Haryana.

### Control Measures for Pests in Acid Lime

**1. Borers (e.g., Stem Borer, Shoot Borer):**
Borers can cause significant damage by tunneling into stems, branches, or shoots, leading to wilting and dieback.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Regularly inspect trees for signs of borer activity (e.g., sawdust-like frass, gum exudation, entry/exit holes).
    *   Prune and destroy affected branches showing signs of wilting or tunneling.
    *   Maintain tree vigor through proper nutrition and irrigation to enhance natural resistance.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   For stem/trunk borers, inject the following insecticide into the borer holes and plug with mud:
        *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 2.5 ml/L of water.
    *   For shoot borers, especially in young plants, or as a preventive measure during peak activity:
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Dimethoate** 30% EC at 1.0 ml/L of water.

**2. Caterpillars (General Leaf/Fruit Feeding Caterpillars):**
Various caterpillar species can feed on leaves, young shoots, and sometimes fruits.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Hand-pick and destroy larger caterpillars if the infestation is localized and manageable.
    *   Encourage natural enemies like parasitic wasps and predatory birds.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   For effective control of most lepidopteran larvae:
        *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG at 0.2 g/L of water.
        *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC at 0.3 ml/L of water.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Spinosad** 45% SC at 0.25 ml/L of water.

**3. Diamondback Moth (DBM):**
This is not known to affect Acid Lime. Diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower, mustard).

**4. Leaf Folder:**
Leaf folders (e.g., Psorosticha zizyphi) roll or fold leaves and feed from within, causing damage to young foliage.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Remove and destroy infested leaves or shoots showing characteristic folding.
    *   Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can promote lush, tender growth favored by leaf folders.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   For effective control of leaf folders:
        *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG at 0.2 g/L of water.
        *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC at 0.3 ml/L of water.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Dimethoate** 30% EC at 1.0 ml/L of water (also effective against leaf miners, which often co-occur).

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the label instructions for any pesticide product, including dosage, application method, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
*   Apply insecticides during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension specialists for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and current pest pressure.
