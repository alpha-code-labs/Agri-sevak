As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following ideal transplantation practices for Acid Lime (Citrus aurantifolia) in Haryana:

### Ideal Transplantation Time

The most suitable periods for transplanting Acid Lime in Haryana are:

*   **Post-Monsoon Season:** September to October. This period offers moderate temperatures, sufficient soil moisture from the monsoon rains, and allows the plants to establish well before the onset of severe winter.
*   **Spring Season:** February to March. Planting during this time allows the plants to establish before the intense summer heat, provided adequate irrigation is ensured.

Avoid transplanting during the peak summer months (May-June) due to high temperatures and water stress, and during the peak winter months (December-January) due to low temperatures which can hinder root establishment.

### Ideal Transplantation Distance

The recommended spacing for Acid Lime depends on the desired orchard density and management practices.

*   **Standard Spacing:** For conventional orchards, a spacing of **4.5 meters x 4.5 meters** (plant-to-plant and row-to-row) is generally ideal. This allows for good canopy development, air circulation, and ease of orchard operations. This translates to approximately 494 plants per acre.
*   **High-Density Planting (HDP):** For intensive cultivation with proper pruning and training, a spacing of **3 meters x 3 meters** can be adopted. This requires more intensive management but can yield higher initial returns. This translates to approximately 1111 plants per acre.

### Ideal Transplantation Process

1.  **Selection of Planting Material:**
    *   Use healthy, disease-free, 1-2 year old budded plants from a reputable nursery. The rootstock should be suitable for local soil and climate conditions (e.g., Rangpur Lime or Rough Lemon are common rootstocks for Acid Lime).

2.  **Pit Preparation:**
    *   Dig pits of **60 cm x 60 cm x 60 cm** size at the marked planting spots, at least 15-30 days before actual planting.
    *   Separate the topsoil from the subsoil.
    *   Allow the pits to remain open for a few days to expose the soil to sunlight and air, which helps in killing soil-borne pathogens and pests.
    *   Refill the pits with a mixture of:
        *   Topsoil
        *   **15-20 kg** of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost.
        *   **1 kg** of **Neem cake** (for its organic nutrient content and mild nematicidal properties).
    *   Mix these components thoroughly and fill the pits, creating a slight mound above ground level as the soil will settle.

3.  **Planting:**
    *   Carefully remove the plant from its polybag or container without disturbing the root ball.
    *   Make a small hole in the center of the prepared pit (in the settled soil mound) just large enough to accommodate the root ball.
    *   Place the plant in the center of the pit, ensuring that the bud union (the point where the scion is grafted onto the rootstock) remains **10-15 cm** above the ground level. This is crucial to prevent rootstock suckers and scion rooting.
    *   Gently fill the remaining space around the root ball with the prepared soil mixture, firming it lightly to remove air pockets.
    *   Create a small basin or ring around the plant for efficient irrigation.

4.  **Post-Planting Care:**
    *   **Immediate Irrigation:** Water the newly planted saplings immediately after planting to settle the soil around the roots.
    *   **Staking:** Provide support to young plants with a bamboo stake to protect them from strong winds and ensure upright growth.
    *   **Mulching:** Apply a layer of organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves, sugarcane trash) around the base of the plant, keeping it slightly away from the stem. Mulching helps conserve soil moisture, regulate soil temperature, and suppress weed growth.
    *   **Protection:** In areas with intense sunlight or strong winds, provide temporary shade or windbreaks for the first few weeks until the plant establishes.
    *   **Weed Control:** Keep the area around the young plant free from weeds, which compete for nutrients and water.
    *   **Pest and Disease Monitoring:** Regularly inspect the young plants for any signs of pests or diseases and take appropriate action as per HAU recommendations.
