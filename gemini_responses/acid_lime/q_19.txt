Namaste, fellow farmer. Addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies in Acid Lime (Kagzi Nimbu) is crucial for healthy growth, optimal yield, and fruit quality. As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I strongly recommend a proactive approach based on scientific principles.

**Crucial First Step: Soil and Leaf Tissue Analysis**
Before applying any fertilizers, it is paramount to conduct a comprehensive soil test and, if possible, a leaf tissue analysis. This will accurately diagnose the specific nutrient deficiency, its severity, and the precise quantities required, preventing over-application and nutrient imbalances. Our HAU labs can assist with this.

Here's how to address deficiencies of Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K) in Acid Lime:

### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   General yellowing (chlorosis) of older leaves, which may eventually turn pale green to yellow.
*   Stunted growth, reduced shoot length, and fewer new flushes.
*   Small, pale green fruits with reduced yield.

**Correction Measures:**

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   For young trees (1-3 years): Apply 100-250 g of actual Nitrogen per tree per year.
    *   For bearing trees (>3 years): Apply 400-800 g of actual Nitrogen per tree per year.
    *   Split the annual dose into 2-3 applications (e.g., pre-flowering, post-fruit set, and during fruit development) for better uptake and reduced leaching.
    *   Recommended CIBRC approved fertilizers:
        *   **Urea** (46% N): Apply 200-550 g/tree/year for young trees, and 870-1740 g/tree/year for bearing trees (split doses).
        *   **Calcium Ammonium Nitrate** (CAN, 25% N): Apply 400-1000 g/tree/year for young trees, and 1600-3200 g/tree/year for bearing trees (split doses).
        *   **Ammonium Sulphate** (20.6% N): Apply 485-1215 g/tree/year for young trees, and 1940-3880 g/tree/year for bearing trees (split doses).
*   **Foliar Application (for quick correction or mild deficiency):**
    *   Spray a 0.5-1.0% solution of **Urea** (5-10 g per liter of water). Apply 2-3 sprays at 15-day intervals, preferably in the morning or late afternoon.

### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   Stunted growth, reduced leaf size, and dull green foliage.
*   Leaves may appear stiff and sometimes develop a purplish tint on the underside (less common in citrus).
*   Poor root development, reduced flowering, and fruit set.
*   Fruits may be coarse-skinned and have poor juice quality.

**Correction Measures:**

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   For young trees (1-3 years): Apply 50-100 g of actual P2O5 per tree per year.
    *   For bearing trees (>3 years): Apply 150-300 g of actual P2O5 per tree per year.
    *   Phosphorus is less mobile in soil, so it's often applied once a year, or split into two applications.
    *   Recommended CIBRC approved fertilizers:
        *   **Single Superphosphate** (SSP, 16% P2O5): Apply 310-625 g/tree/year for young trees, and 940-1875 g/tree/year for bearing trees.
        *   **Di-ammonium Phosphate** (DAP, 46% P2O5): Apply 110-220 g/tree/year for young trees, and 325-650 g/tree/year for bearing trees. (Note: DAP also contains 18% N, so adjust N application accordingly).
        *   **Triple Superphosphate** (TSP, 46% P2O5): Apply 110-220 g/tree/year for young trees, and 325-650 g/tree/year for bearing trees.

### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   Yellowing and browning (necrosis) of leaf margins, especially on older leaves, giving a "scorched" appearance.
*   Reduced fruit size, poor fruit quality, and lower sugar content.
*   Weak branches, increased susceptibility to diseases, and premature fruit drop.

**Correction Measures:**

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   For young trees (1-3 years): Apply 50-100 g of actual K2O per tree per year.
    *   For bearing trees (>3 years): Apply 200-600 g of actual K2O per tree per year.
    *   Split the annual dose into 2-3 applications (similar to Nitrogen) for better uptake.
    *   Recommended CIBRC approved fertilizers:
        *   **Muriate of Potash** (Potassium Chloride, 60% K2O): Apply 85-170 g/tree/year for young trees, and 335-1000 g/tree/year for bearing trees (split doses).
        *   **Sulphate of Potash** (Potassium Sulphate, 50% K2O): Apply 100-200 g/tree/year for young trees, and 400-1200 g/tree/year for bearing trees (split doses).
*   **Foliar Application (for quick correction or mild deficiency):**
    *   Spray a 1.0-2.0% solution of **Potassium Nitrate** (10-20 g per liter of water) or **Sulphate of Potash** (10-20 g per liter of water). Apply 2-3 sprays at 15-day intervals.

### General Recommendations for Effective Nutrient Management:

*   **Timing of Application:** Apply soil fertilizers when the soil is moist, preferably after irrigation or rainfall.
*   **Method of Application:** Spread granular fertilizers evenly in the drip line area of the tree, avoiding direct contact with the trunk, and lightly incorporate into the soil.
*   **Organic Matter:** Regularly incorporate well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost (10-20 kg/tree/year for bearing trees) to improve soil health, nutrient retention, and microbial activity.
*   **Irrigation:** Ensure adequate and timely irrigation, as water stress can hinder nutrient uptake.
*   **Soil pH Management:** Maintain soil pH in the optimal range of 6.0-7.0 for citrus, as extreme pH can lock up nutrients.

Always remember, these are general guidelines. The precise dosage will depend on your specific soil test results, tree age, variety, and yield expectations. For further personalized advice, please consult with our experts at HAU, Hisar.
