Mites, including Red Spider Mite (*Tetranychus urticae*) and Rust Mite (*Phyllocoptruta oleivora* or *Aculops pelekassi*), are common and significant pests of Acid Lime (Kagzi Nimbu) in Haryana. Their timely and effective control is crucial for maintaining tree health and fruit quality.

**Symptoms of Mite Infestation:**
*   **Red Spider Mite:** Fine webbing on leaves, yellowing or bronzing of leaves, especially on the undersides. Severe infestations can lead to defoliation.
*   **Rust Mite:** Silvery or bronzed appearance on leaves and fruits (russeting). Fruits may become hard, cracked, and reduced in size, leading to significant economic loss.

**Control Measures:**

1.  **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your Acid Lime trees, especially the undersides of leaves and young fruits, using a hand lens if necessary, to detect mite infestations early.

2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Maintain good orchard hygiene by removing weeds, which can act as alternate hosts for mites.
    *   Ensure adequate irrigation, as water-stressed plants are more susceptible to mite damage.
    *   Avoid excessive use of nitrogenous fertilizers, which can promote lush, soft growth favored by mites.

3.  **Chemical Control (Acaricides):**
    When mite populations reach damaging levels, chemical intervention with CIBRC-approved acaricides is necessary. It is vital to rotate different classes of acaricides to prevent the development of resistance. Ensure thorough spray coverage, particularly on the undersides of leaves and fruit surfaces.

    Here are some recommended acaricides and their dosages:

    *   **For both Red Spider Mite and Rust Mite:**
        *   **Wettable Sulphur** (80% WP): 4-5 g/L of water (or 2.0-2.5 kg/acre). *This is effective against both types of mites, especially rust mites, and also provides some fungicidal benefits. Apply when temperatures are not excessively high (below 30°C) to avoid phytotoxicity.*
        *   **Spiromesifen** (22.9% SC): 0.5 ml/L of water (or 125 ml/acre). *Effective against all life stages of mites.*
        *   **Fenpyroximate** (5% EC): 0.5-0.6 ml/L of water (or 250-300 ml/acre). *Provides quick knockdown and residual activity.*

    *   **Additional options for rotation (effective against various mite species):**
        *   **Propargite** (57% EC): 3-4 ml/L of water (or 1.5-2.0 L/acre). *A broad-spectrum acaricide.*
        *   **Abamectin** (1.9% EC): 0.2 ml/L of water (or 100 ml/acre). *Has translaminar action, effective against motile stages of mites.*
        *   **Hexythiazox** (5.45% EC): 0.4-0.5 ml/L of water (or 200-250 ml/acre). *Acts as a mite growth regulator, primarily ovicidal and larvicidal.*
        *   **Fenazaquin** (10% EC): 0.5-0.6 ml/L of water (or 250-300 ml/acre). *Effective against all life stages of mites.*

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Rotation:** Always rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent mites from developing resistance.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and all fruit surfaces, as mites often hide in these areas.
*   **Safety:** Always read and strictly follow the instructions, precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI) mentioned on the product label. Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during application.
*   **Timing:** Apply acaricides during the cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to enhance efficacy and minimize the risk of phytotoxicity.
