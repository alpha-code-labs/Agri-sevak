As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the suitable climate, soil type, and drainage requirements for Acid Lime (Citrus aurantifolia) cultivation in Haryana:

### Climate Requirements for Acid Lime

Acid Lime thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. For successful cultivation in Haryana, consider the following:

*   **Temperature:**
    *   **Optimal Range:** 20°C to 35°C is ideal for growth and fruit development.
    *   **Tolerance:** It can tolerate temperatures up to 45°C if adequate irrigation is provided, but extreme heat can affect fruit quality and yield.
    *   **Frost Sensitivity:** Acid lime is highly sensitive to frost. Young plants are particularly vulnerable. Protection measures are essential during winter months in Haryana where frost can occur.
*   **Rainfall:**
    *   **Requirement:** An annual rainfall of 750-1200 mm is generally considered suitable.
    *   **Haryana Context:** Given Haryana's semi-arid to arid climate, supplementary irrigation is absolutely crucial throughout the year, especially during dry spells and fruit development stages.
*   **Humidity:**
    *   **Preference:** Moderate to high humidity is generally preferred, but with proper irrigation, it can adapt to drier atmospheric conditions prevalent in Haryana.

### Soil Type Requirements for Acid Lime

Acid Lime performs best in well-drained, fertile soils.

*   **Texture:**
    *   **Ideal:** Loamy to sandy-loam soils are most suitable. These soils offer a good balance of water retention and aeration.
    *   **Avoid:** Heavy clay soils or soils with poor internal drainage should be avoided as they lead to waterlogging and root diseases.
*   **pH:**
    *   **Optimal Range:** A soil pH between 6.0 and 7.5 is considered ideal. Acid lime can tolerate a slightly wider range but performs best within this slightly acidic to neutral range.
*   **Organic Matter:**
    *   **Importance:** Soils rich in organic matter are highly beneficial as they improve soil structure, water holding capacity, and nutrient availability. Regular addition of farmyard manure or compost is recommended.
*   **Salinity/Alkalinity:**
    *   **Sensitivity:** Acid lime is moderately sensitive to soil salinity and alkalinity. High levels can lead to reduced growth and yield. Soil testing is crucial in areas of Haryana prone to these issues, and appropriate amelioration measures (e.g., gypsum application for sodic soils, leaching with good quality water) should be undertaken if necessary.

### Drainage Requirements for Acid Lime

Proper drainage is paramount for Acid Lime cultivation.

*   **Waterlogging Sensitivity:** Acid lime is extremely sensitive to waterlogging. Even short periods of standing water can cause severe damage to the root system, leading to root rot diseases (e.g., Phytophthora) and eventual plant death.
*   **Well-Drained Soil:** The soil must have excellent internal drainage to allow excess water to percolate away quickly.
*   **Deep Water Table:** A deep water table (preferably below 2 meters) is essential. If the water table is shallow, raised beds or mounds should be considered to prevent root zone saturation.
*   **Site Selection:** Choose sites that are naturally well-drained and avoid low-lying areas where water might accumulate. If necessary, implement proper land leveling and drainage channels to ensure efficient removal of surface water.
