As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the specified pests in Acid Lime (Citrus aurantifolia) in Haryana:

### Control of Grasshopper

Grasshoppers can cause significant damage to young leaves, shoots, and sometimes fruits of Acid Lime, especially during outbreaks.

**Cultural Control:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Keep the orchard clean of weeds, which can serve as alternate hosts and breeding sites.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** During off-season, deep ploughing can expose grasshopper eggs laid in the soil to predators and harsh weather, reducing subsequent populations.

**Chemical Control:**
For severe infestations, chemical intervention may be necessary. Apply insecticides when grasshopper nymphs are small and more vulnerable.

*   **Malathion 50 EC:** Apply at 2-3 ml per litre of water.
*   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5 EC:** Apply at 0.5 ml per litre of water.

### Control of Painted Bug (Bagrada hilaris)

This is not known to affect Acid Lime. Painted bug is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., mustard, cabbage, radish).

### Control of Red Cotton Bug (Dysdercus cingulatus)

This is not known to affect Acid Lime. Red cotton bug is a major pest of cotton and other malvaceous plants, feeding on developing seeds.

### Control of Black Ants

Black ants in Acid Lime orchards are often secondary pests. They are primarily attracted to the honeydew secreted by sap-sucking insects like aphids, mealybugs, and scales. Ants protect these honeydew-producing pests from their natural enemies, thereby exacerbating the primary pest problem. Direct damage by ants to the lime tree is usually minor, but they can interfere with harvesting.

**Cultural Control:**
*   **Control Primary Pests:** The most effective way to manage ants is to control the primary honeydew-producing pests (aphids, mealybugs, scales). Once the honeydew source is eliminated, ants will naturally disperse.
*   **Trunk Banding:** Apply sticky bands or grease around the tree trunk to prevent ants from climbing up into the canopy.

**Chemical Control:**
If direct ant control is necessary, especially to prevent them from accessing the canopy:

*   **Chlorpyrifos 20 EC:** Apply as a drench around the base of the tree or paint a band on the trunk (mixed with clay or other inert material) at 2.5 ml per litre of water to create a barrier. Ensure the application does not directly contact the edible parts of the plant.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) for any chemical applied to ensure fruit safety.
*   For specific local recommendations and integrated pest management strategies, it is always advisable to consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts.
