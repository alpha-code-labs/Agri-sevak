As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling these pests in Acid Lime in Haryana:

**Ber Fly (*Carpomyia vesuviana*)**
This is not known to affect Acid Lime. Ber fly is a specific pest of Ber (*Ziziphus mauritiana*).

**Fruit Fly (*Bactrocera* species) in Acid Lime**
Fruit flies, particularly the Oriental Fruit Fly (*Bactrocera dorsalis*), are significant pests of citrus, including Acid Lime, in our region. Effective control requires an integrated approach:

1.  **Orchard Sanitation:**
    *   Regularly collect and destroy all fallen and infested fruits by burying them deep in the soil (at least 60 cm) or by boiling them. This prevents the completion of the fruit fly life cycle.
    *   Deep ploughing of the orchard soil during off-season can expose and kill pupae.

2.  **Monitoring and Mass Trapping:**
    *   Install **Methyl Eugenol** based pheromone traps at a density of 10-12 traps per acre, starting from fruit set. These traps attract male fruit flies, helping to monitor pest population and reduce their numbers.
    *   Replace the lure every 2-3 weeks.

3.  **Bait Sprays (Spot Application):**
    *   Bait sprays are highly effective and target-specific, reducing the overall pesticide load. They combine an insecticide with a food attractant.
    *   Prepare the bait spray mixture and apply it as spots (about 1 square meter area) on the foliage of non-bearing trees or on the trunk/leaves of selected trees, not directly on the fruits. Apply 50-100 ml of the bait spray mixture per spot, with 10-15 spots per acre.
    *   Repeat applications at 7-10 day intervals, especially during the fruit development and ripening stages.

    *   **Option 1 (Conventional):**
        *   **Malathion 50% EC**: 20 ml
        *   **Jaggery (Gud)** or **Protein Hydrolysate**: 200 g (or 20 ml protein hydrolysate)
        *   Water: 10 Litres
        *   Mix thoroughly and apply as spot sprays.

    *   **Option 2 (Modern/Safer):**
        *   **Spinosad 45% SC**: 0.5 ml
        *   **Jaggery (Gud)** or **Protein Hydrolysate**: 10 g (or 10 ml protein hydrolysate)
        *   Water: 1 Litre
        *   Mix thoroughly and apply as spot sprays.

4.  **Pre-harvest Interval (PHI):** Always observe the recommended pre-harvest interval for any chemical applied to ensure fruit safety.

By implementing these measures, you can effectively manage fruit fly populations in your Acid Lime orchard.
