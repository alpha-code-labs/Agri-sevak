As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling soil pests like termites and nematodes in Acid Lime orchards in Haryana.

Both termites and nematodes are significant soil pests that can severely impact the health and productivity of Acid Lime trees. An integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods is recommended for effective and sustainable management.

### 1. Control of Termites (White Ants)

Termites feed on the bark and wood, especially at the collar region and roots, leading to girdling, weakening, and eventual death of the plant.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Remove all dead wood, stumps, and other cellulosic debris from the orchard and its vicinity, as these serve as breeding grounds for termites.
    *   Avoid direct contact of wooden stakes or supports with the soil.
    *   Ensure proper orchard sanitation.
    *   Avoid excessive moisture accumulation around the tree base.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   For existing infestations or as a prophylactic measure, drench the soil around the tree base.
    *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC**: Mix 2.5 ml of **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** per liter of water. Drench 5-10 liters of this solution per tree, depending on the tree size and age, ensuring the solution penetrates the root zone. This should be done once a year, preferably before the monsoon or during periods of active termite infestation.

### 2. Control of Nematodes (Root-knot Nematodes)

Root-knot nematodes (*Meloidogyne* species) are microscopic worms that infect the roots, causing characteristic galls or knots. This impairs the tree's ability to absorb water and nutrients, leading to stunted growth, yellowing leaves, reduced fruit yield, and increased susceptibility to other diseases.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   **Soil Solarization:** In fallow land (before planting new trees), cover moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks during the hot summer months (May-June). This raises soil temperature to levels lethal to nematodes.
    *   **Organic Matter Incorporation:** Regularly incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost into the soil around the trees. Organic matter improves soil health and promotes beneficial microorganisms that can suppress nematode populations.
    *   **Neem Cake Application:** Apply **Neem cake** at 200-500 g per tree, mixed into the soil around the root zone, twice a year (e.g., pre-monsoon and post-monsoon). Neem cake releases compounds that are toxic to nematodes and also enhances beneficial microbial activity.
    *   **Resistant Rootstocks:** For new plantings, consider using nematode-resistant rootstocks if available and suitable for Acid Lime in Haryana conditions (e.g., Rough Lemon, Rangpur Lime, Trifoliate Orange hybrids, though specific resistance varies by nematode species).

*   **Biological Control:**
    *   **Purpureocillium lilacinum (formerly Paecilomyces lilacinus)**: Apply a formulation containing *Purpureocillium lilacinum* (e.g., 1-2 kg/acre or 20-50 g/tree) mixed with FYM or compost and applied to the soil around the root zone. This fungus parasitizes nematode eggs and juveniles, reducing their population. Repeat application as per product recommendations, typically twice a year.

### General Recommendations:

*   Always read and strictly follow the label instructions and safety precautions provided with any chemical or biological product.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, and protective clothing when handling and applying pesticides.
*   Regularly monitor your orchard for early signs of pest infestation to enable timely intervention.
*   An Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining various control methods, is the most effective and sustainable strategy for managing soil pests in Acid Lime.
