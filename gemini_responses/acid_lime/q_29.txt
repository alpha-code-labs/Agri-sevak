As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide scientifically verified advice for controlling dropping in Acid Lime.

Firstly, it is important to clarify that "Tinda/Boll dropping" is a term specifically associated with crops like cotton (boll dropping) or certain cucurbits (tinda dropping). **This is not known to affect Acid Lime.**

However, Acid Lime (Kagzi Nimbu) commonly experiences **flower drop** and **fruit drop**, which can significantly reduce yield. This dropping can be attributed to a combination of physiological, environmental, and nutritional factors.

**Causes of Flower and Fruit Drop in Acid Lime:**

1.  **Physiological Factors:**
    *   **Natural Shedding:** Citrus trees naturally shed a large percentage of flowers and young fruits (often 70-90%) to regulate the fruit load according to their physiological capacity.
    *   **Hormonal Imbalance:** Imbalances in plant hormones (auxins, gibberellins, cytokinins) can trigger abscission.
    *   **Competition for Resources:** Excessive flowering or fruit set leads to competition for nutrients and water, causing the tree to shed weaker flowers/fruits.
2.  **Environmental Stress:**
    *   **Water Stress:** Both drought conditions and waterlogging can lead to severe dropping.
    *   **Temperature Extremes:** High temperatures (especially during flowering and fruit set) or sudden cold snaps can cause drop.
    *   **High Humidity/Rain:** Prolonged high humidity or heavy rains during flowering can impair pollination and fruit set.
    *   **Strong Winds:** Can physically dislodge flowers and young fruits.
3.  **Nutritional Deficiencies:**
    *   Deficiencies of micronutrients like Boron, Zinc, and Molybdenum are critical for flower development, pollen viability, and fruit set.
    *   Overall poor tree nutrition can weaken the tree, making it more susceptible to dropping.
4.  **Pest and Disease:**
    *   Severe infestations of pests like citrus psylla, thrips, or mites on flowers and young fruits can cause damage leading to drop.
    *   Diseases affecting overall tree health (e.g., root rot, gummosis) can indirectly lead to dropping due to stress.

**Control Measures for Flower and Fruit Drop in Acid Lime:**

Effective control involves a combination of good horticultural practices, balanced nutrition, and judicious use of plant growth regulators.

**A. Cultural and Agronomic Practices:**

*   **Optimal Irrigation:** Maintain consistent soil moisture, avoiding both water stress and waterlogging, especially during flowering and fruit development stages. Use drip irrigation for efficient water management.
*   **Weed Management:** Keep the basin area free of weeds to reduce competition for water and nutrients.
*   **Mulching:** Apply organic mulch around the tree base to conserve soil moisture, regulate soil temperature, and suppress weeds.
*   **Pruning:** Remove dead, diseased, or overcrowded branches to improve air circulation and light penetration, promoting overall tree health.
*   **Pest and Disease Management:** Regularly monitor for pests and diseases and implement integrated pest management (IPM) strategies to keep them below economic threshold levels.

**B. Nutritional Management (Foliar Sprays):**

Foliar application of essential micronutrients can significantly improve flower retention and fruit set.

*   **Boron:**
    *   Spray with **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (20% Boron) at 1-2 g/L of water, or **Borax (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate)** (11% Boron) at 2-4 g/L of water.
    *   Apply once before flowering and again after fruit set.
*   **Zinc:**
    *   Spray with **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** (21% Zinc) at 5 g/L of water.
    *   Apply once before flowering and again after fruit set.
*   **Molybdenum:**
    *   Spray with **Ammonium Molybdate** at 0.1-0.5 g/L of water.
    *   Apply once before flowering.
*   **Combined Micronutrient Sprays:** Many commercial formulations of chelated micronutrient mixtures containing Zinc, Boron, Manganese, Iron, Copper, and Molybdenum are available. Follow product-specific recommendations.

**C. Hormonal Management (Plant Growth Regulators - PGRs):**

Judicious application of specific PGRs can help reduce excessive flower and fruit drop.

*   **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA):**
    *   Apply **Naphthalene Acetic Acid 4.5% SL** at 0.2-0.4 ml/L of water (equivalent to 10-20 ppm a.i.).
    *   Spray at full bloom and/or 4-6 weeks after fruit set.
*   **2,4-D (2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid):**
    *   Apply **2,4-D Sodium Salt 80% WP** at 0.006-0.012 g/L of water (equivalent to 5-10 ppm a.i.).
    *   Spray at full bloom or 2-3 weeks after fruit set.
    *   **Caution:** Precise measurement is crucial as higher concentrations of 2,4-D act as a herbicide. Use only the recommended low concentrations for fruit drop control.

By implementing these integrated control measures, Acid Lime growers in Haryana can effectively manage flower and fruit drop, leading to improved yields and fruit quality.
