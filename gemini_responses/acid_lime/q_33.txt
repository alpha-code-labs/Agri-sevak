As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend an integrated approach to weed management in Acid Lime (Citrus aurantifolia) orchards, combining cultural, mechanical, and chemical methods for effective and sustainable control.

**General Principles for Weed Control in Acid Lime Orchards:**

1.  **Clean Cultivation:** Keep the area around the tree basin and inter-row spaces free of weeds, especially during the initial establishment phase and critical growth periods.
2.  **Mulching:** Organic mulches (straw, dry leaves, crop residues) around the tree base can suppress weed growth, conserve moisture, and improve soil health.
3.  **Directed Spray:** When using herbicides, always ensure a directed spray, avoiding contact with the trunk, leaves, and fruits of the Acid Lime trees. Use a protective hood or shield on the spray nozzle.
4.  **Weed Stage:** Herbicides are most effective when weeds are young and actively growing.
5.  **Soil Moisture:** Pre-emergence herbicides require adequate soil moisture for activation. Post-emergence herbicides work best when weeds are not under moisture stress.
6.  **Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):** Always wear appropriate PPE (gloves, mask, protective clothing) while handling and applying herbicides.
7.  **Sprayer Calibration:** Ensure your sprayer is properly calibrated for uniform application and correct dosage.

Here are specific recommendations for the weeds mentioned:

**1. Broadleaf and Narrowleaf Weeds (General Control):**

For general control of a wide spectrum of broadleaf and narrowleaf weeds in the inter-row spaces and around the tree basin (avoiding contact with the tree):

*   **Pre-emergence Application (before weed emergence):**
    *   **Diuron 80% WP**: Apply at 1.0 - 2.0 kg per acre in 200-400 litres of water. Apply to a clean, moist soil surface before weed germination.
    *   **Oxyfluorfen 23.5% EC**: Apply at 1.0 - 2.0 litres per acre in 200-400 litres of water. Apply to a clean, moist soil surface before weed germination or when weeds are very small (2-4 leaf stage).
    *   **Pendimethalin 30% EC**: Apply at 3.3 - 5.0 litres per acre in 200-400 litres of water. Apply to a clean, moist soil surface before weed germination.

*   **Post-emergence Application (after weed emergence):**
    *   **Glyphosate 41% SL**: Apply at 2.0 - 3.0 litres per acre in 200-400 litres of water as a directed spray. For spot treatment, use 80-100 ml per 10 litres of water. This is a non-selective herbicide, so extreme care must be taken to avoid contact with the Acid Lime tree.
    *   **Paraquat Dichloride 24% SL**: Apply at 2.0 - 4.0 litres per acre in 200-400 litres of water as a directed spray. For spot treatment, use 40-60 ml per 10 litres of water. This is a contact herbicide, effective on young weeds, but also non-selective.

**2. Amarbail (Cuscuta spp. - Dodder):**

Amarbail is a parasitic weed. Control is challenging and requires a multi-pronged approach.

*   **Manual Removal:** The most effective method is to manually remove Amarbail as soon as it is observed, along with the host plant parts it has attached to, before it produces seeds. Dispose of the removed material carefully to prevent further spread.
*   **Pre-emergence:**
    *   **Pendimethalin 30% EC**: Can be applied at 3.3 - 5.0 litres per acre as a pre-emergence treatment to reduce germination of Amarbail seeds in the soil.
    *   **Oxyfluorfen 23.5% EC**: Can also provide some pre-emergence control at 1.0 - 2.0 litres per acre.
*   **Post-emergence (Spot Treatment):**
    *   **Paraquat Dichloride 24% SL**: Can be used as a highly directed spot spray (e.g., 40-60 ml per 10 litres of water) to burn off Amarbail patches, taking extreme care to avoid contact with the Acid Lime tree.

**3. Bathu (Chenopodium album):**

Bathu is a common broadleaf weed.

*   **Manual Removal:** Hand weeding is effective for small infestations.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Pre-emergence:** **Diuron 80% WP** (1.0 - 2.0 kg/acre) or **Oxyfluorfen 23.5% EC** (1.0 - 2.0 litres/acre).
    *   **Post-emergence:** **Glyphosate 41% SL** (2.0 - 3.0 litres/acre) or **Paraquat Dichloride 24% SL** (2.0 - 4.0 litres/acre) as directed sprays.

**4. Congress Grass (Parthenium hysterophorus):**

Congress grass is a noxious broadleaf weed.

*   **Manual Removal:** Remove manually when young, preferably before flowering, wearing gloves and protective clothing to avoid allergic reactions.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Post-emergence:** **Glyphosate 41% SL** (2.0 - 3.0 litres per acre) or **Paraquat Dichloride 24% SL** (2.0 - 4.0 litres per acre) as directed sprays are effective on young Parthenium plants.

**5. Orobanche (Broomrape):**

This is not known to affect Acid Lime. Orobanche species are root parasites primarily affecting dicotyledonous crops like mustard, tobacco, tomato, potato, and sunflower, but not typically citrus.

**6. Phalaris minor (Little Seed Canary Grass):**

Phalaris minor is a common narrowleaf (grass) weed.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Pre-emergence:** **Diuron 80% WP** (1.0 - 2.0 kg/acre) or **Oxyfluorfen 23.5% EC** (1.0 - 2.0 litres/acre) can provide some control.
    *   **Post-emergence:** **Glyphosate 41% SL** (2.0 - 3.0 litres per acre) or **Paraquat Dichloride 24% SL** (2.0 - 4.0 litres per acre) as directed sprays are highly effective on Phalaris minor.

Always consult the label of the specific product for detailed instructions, precautions, and the latest recommendations before application.
