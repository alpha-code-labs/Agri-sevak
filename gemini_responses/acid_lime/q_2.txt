As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding rust diseases in Acid Lime for Haryana conditions:

Regarding the specific rust diseases mentioned:

*   **Black Rust, Brown Rust, Yellow Rust, and White Rust:** These are primarily fungal diseases known to affect cereals and other specific crops. They are **not known to affect Acid Lime.**

*   **Red Rust:** This condition, often referred to as "Red Rust," is not caused by a true fungus but by a parasitic alga, *Cephaleuros virescens*. It *does* affect Acid Lime, particularly in conditions of high humidity, poor air circulation, and on weakened trees. It manifests as reddish-brown, velvety spots on leaves, twigs, and sometimes fruit, which can lead to defoliation and twig dieback.

**Control Measures for Red Rust (*Cephaleuros virescens*) in Acid Lime:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Pruning:** Regularly prune affected and overcrowded branches to improve air circulation within the canopy. Remove dead or diseased twigs.
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the area around the trees free of weeds to reduce humidity.
    *   **Nutrition:** Ensure the trees receive balanced nutrition to maintain vigor and improve their natural resistance. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can lead to lush, susceptible growth.
    *   **Drainage:** Ensure good soil drainage to prevent waterlogging, which can stress trees.

2.  **Chemical Control (Fungicides/Algicides):**
    When cultural practices are insufficient, especially during periods of high humidity (e.g., monsoon season), chemical intervention may be necessary. Copper-based fungicides are effective against this algal pathogen.

    *   **Copper Oxychloride:** Apply a spray solution of **Copper Oxychloride** at 2.5-3.0 g/L of water. Ensure thorough coverage of affected plant parts.
    *   **Copper Hydroxide:** Alternatively, **Copper Hydroxide** can be used at 2.0 g/L of water.

    *   **Application:** Apply sprays preventively before the onset of the monsoon or at the first sign of symptoms. Repeat applications may be necessary at 15-20 day intervals if conditions remain favorable for the disease. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions.
