As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I am pleased to provide scientifically verified recommendations to improve yield, fruit quality, and storage life for Acid Lime (Citrus aurantifolia) in Haryana. An integrated approach combining good horticultural practices, balanced nutrition, and timely interventions is crucial.

### I. Improving Yield of Acid Lime

Maximizing yield requires attention to plant health, nutrition, and environmental factors.

1.  **Variety Selection**: While not for existing orchards, for new plantings, select high-yielding, disease-resistant varieties suitable for Haryana's climate, such as 'Pant Lemon-1', 'Vikram', or 'Pramalini'.
2.  **Nutrient Management**:
    *   **Soil Testing**: Conduct regular soil tests (every 2-3 years) to determine nutrient deficiencies and pH.
    *   **Macronutrients**:
        *   **Nitrogen (N)**: Apply 200-300 g N per mature tree per year in two split doses (February-March and July-August) using **Urea**.
        *   **Phosphorus (P)**: Apply 100-150 g P2O5 per mature tree per year using **Diammonium Phosphate** (DAP) or **Single Super Phosphate** (SSP). Apply once a year, preferably before flowering.
        *   **Potassium (K)**: Apply 200-300 g K2O per mature tree per year in two split doses (February-March and July-August) using **Muriate of Potash** (MOP) or **Sulphate of Potash** (SOP).
    *   **Micronutrients**: Deficiencies are common in Haryana soils.
        *   **Zinc (Zn)**: Foliar spray of **Zinc Sulphate** (0.5%) + **Calcium Hydroxide** (0.25%) or **Zinc EDTA** (0.1%) during new flush emergence.
        *   **Iron (Fe)**: Foliar spray of **Ferrous Sulphate** (0.5%) + **Calcium Hydroxide** (0.25%) or **Ferrous EDTA** (0.1%) for iron chlorosis.
        *   **Manganese (Mn)**: Foliar spray of **Manganese Sulphate** (0.5%) + **Calcium Hydroxide** (0.25%).
        *   **Boron (B)**: Foliar spray of **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (Borax) (0.1%) before flowering and during fruit development.
3.  **Water Management**:
    *   **Irrigation**: Provide consistent irrigation, especially during flowering and fruit development. Drip irrigation is highly recommended for efficient water use and nutrient delivery.
    *   **Moisture Stress**: Avoid both waterlogging and severe moisture stress, which can lead to flower and fruit drop.
4.  **Pruning**:
    *   **Light Pruning**: Remove dead, diseased, criss-crossing, and weak branches annually after harvest to maintain an open canopy for better light penetration and air circulation.
    *   **Skirting**: Remove branches touching the ground to prevent pest and disease entry.
5.  **Weed Management**: Control weeds effectively, especially around the tree basin, to reduce competition for water and nutrients.
6.  **Integrated Pest and Disease Management (IPDM)**: Timely identification and management of major pests (e.g., Citrus psylla, leaf miner, scale insects) and diseases (e.g., Canker, Gummosis, Dieback) are critical to prevent yield losses. Consult HAU experts for specific recommendations based on pest/disease incidence.
7.  **Growth Regulators**:
    *   To control excessive flower/fruit drop, a spray of **Naphthalene Acetic Acid** (NAA) at 10-20 mg/L (ppm) or **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid** (2,4-D) at 10 mg/L (ppm) can be applied at pea size fruit stage.

### II. Improving Fruit Quality of Acid Lime

Fruit quality encompasses size, juice content, rind thickness, colour, and taste.

1.  **Balanced Nutrition**:
    *   **Potassium (K)**: Adequate K is crucial for fruit size, juice content, TSS (Total Soluble Solids), and acidity. Ensure sufficient **Muriate of Potash** or **Sulphate of Potash** application.
    *   **Micronutrients**: Timely correction of micronutrient deficiencies (especially Zn, B, Fe, Mn) through foliar sprays improves fruit appearance, size, and overall quality.
2.  **Water Management**: Consistent and adequate irrigation during fruit development prevents fruit cracking, improves size, and maintains turgidity.
3.  **Pest and Disease Control**: Effective management of pests (e.g., fruit flies, mites, scale insects) and diseases (e.g., Canker, Scab) prevents blemishes, deformities, and premature fruit drop, ensuring clean and marketable fruit.
4.  **Pruning**: An open canopy allows for better light penetration to all fruits, leading to uniform ripening, better colour development, and improved sugar accumulation.
5.  **Harvesting at Optimal Maturity**: Harvesting fruits at the correct stage of maturity (when they reach full size and characteristic colour) ensures optimal juice content, flavour, and acidity. Immature fruits are sour, and over-mature fruits can be dry or prone to spoilage.

### III. Improving Storage Life of Acid Lime

Extending storage life reduces post-harvest losses and allows for better market realization.

1.  **Careful Harvesting**:
    *   **Maturity**: Harvest fruits at optimum maturity. For Acid Lime, this is typically when fruits are firm, glossy, and have started to turn pale green to yellowish-green.
    *   **Method**: Harvest fruits carefully by clipping the stem close to the fruit using clippers, leaving a small button. Avoid pulling or tearing, which can damage the fruit and create entry points for pathogens.
    *   **Timing**: Harvest during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize field heat.
    *   **Handling**: Avoid dropping, bruising, or any mechanical injury during harvesting and transport.
2.  **Pre-cooling**: Rapidly remove field heat from harvested fruits by placing them in a cool, shaded area or using forced-air cooling. This slows down respiration and ripening.
3.  **Washing and Cleaning**: Wash fruits with clean water to remove dirt, dust, and surface contaminants. A mild disinfectant solution (e.g., 100-200 mg/L **Sodium Hypochlorite**) can be used to reduce microbial load.
4.  **Post-harvest Fungicide Treatment**: To control post-harvest rots, dip fruits in a solution of CIBRC-approved fungicides:
    *   **Carbendazim** (500 mg/L)
    *   **Thiophanate-methyl** (700 mg/L)
    *   **Prochloraz** (250 mg/L)
    *   Ensure proper drying after treatment.
5.  **Waxing**: Apply a thin, edible wax coating (e.g., food-grade carnauba wax or shellac-based wax) to the fruits. This reduces moisture loss, maintains firmness, improves appearance, and provides an additional barrier against pathogens.
6.  **Proper Storage Conditions**:
    *   **Temperature**: Store Acid Limes at a temperature of 8-10°C. Temperatures below 8°C can cause chilling injury (pitting, browning).
    *   **Relative Humidity**: Maintain a high relative humidity of 90-95% to prevent desiccation and shriveling.
7.  **Growth Regulators**:
    *   Post-harvest dip in **Gibberellic Acid** (GA3) at 10-20 mg/L can help delay senescence and maintain green colour for a longer period.

By implementing these practices diligently, Acid Lime growers in Haryana can significantly enhance their yields, improve fruit quality, and extend the marketability of their produce. For specific issues or further guidance, please contact the Department of Horticulture at HAU, Hisar.
