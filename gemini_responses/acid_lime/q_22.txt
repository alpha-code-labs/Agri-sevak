As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified cultivation practices for Acid Lime (Kagzi Lime) in Haryana. It is important to note that Acid Lime is primarily propagated vegetatively (budding or grafting) for commercial orchards to ensure genetic uniformity, disease resistance (through rootstock), and early bearing. Direct sowing of seeds for establishing an orchard is generally not recommended. Seeds are primarily used for raising rootstock seedlings in a nursery.

Here are the recommended practices:

**1. Sowing Method/Pattern (for Rootstock in Nursery) and Planting Method (for Budded/Grafted Plants in Main Field):**

*   **For Rootstock Seedlings (Nursery):**
    *   **Method:** Healthy, mature seeds are extracted from ripe fruits, washed, and dried in shade. They are typically sown in well-prepared raised nursery beds or polybags filled with a suitable potting mix.
    *   **Pattern:** Seeds can be sown in lines 10-15 cm apart, with individual seeds spaced 2-3 cm within the line. This linear pattern facilitates weeding, irrigation, and subsequent transplanting or budding operations.
*   **For Budded/Grafted Plants (Main Field):**
    *   **Method:** Healthy, disease-free budded or grafted plants (typically 1-2 years old) from certified nurseries are used. Pits of 60 cm x 60 cm x 60 cm should be dug at least 15-30 days prior to planting and exposed to sunlight. These pits are then refilled with a mixture of topsoil, 15-20 kg of well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM), 1 kg neem cake, and 500 g of single super phosphate.
    *   **Pattern:** The **square system** of planting is highly recommended for Acid Lime orchards. This pattern allows for efficient inter-cultivation, irrigation, and other orchard management practices.

**2. Planting Depth:**

*   **For Rootstock Seedlings (Nursery):**
    *   Seeds should be sown at a depth of **1-2 cm** in the nursery beds or polybags.
*   **For Budded/Grafted Plants (Main Field):**
    *   When planting the budded/grafted plant in the main field, ensure that the **bud union (graft union) remains 15-20 cm above the ground level**. This is critical to prevent scion rooting and potential issues related to rootstock performance and disease susceptibility. The soil level around the plant should be maintained at the same depth as it was in the nursery bag/pot.

**3. Spacing:**

*   The recommended spacing for Acid Lime in Haryana, considering standard rootstocks and management practices, is:
    *   **6 meters x 6 meters (m x m)**
    *   This spacing allows for adequate light penetration, air circulation, and ease of orchard operations, accommodating approximately 277 plants per acre. While high-density planting systems exist, they require specific rootstocks and intensive pruning, which may not be suitable for all growers or conditions.

**4. Seed Dose (for Rootstock Production in Nursery):**

*   As direct sowing for orchard establishment is not recommended, "seed dose" refers to the quantity of seeds required for raising rootstock seedlings in a nursery for subsequent budding/grafting.
*   Approximately **100-150 grams of viable Acid Lime seeds** are generally sufficient to raise enough rootstock seedlings to bud/graft and plant one acre of Acid Lime orchard. This accounts for typical germination rates (60-70%) and potential losses during seedling growth and budding/grafting processes. It is always advisable to sow a slightly higher quantity of seeds than strictly calculated to ensure a sufficient number of healthy rootstocks.
