As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the control of Scab, Canker, Gummosis, and Lichen in Aloe Vera for the region of Haryana:

*   **Scab:** This is not known to affect Aloe Vera.
*   **Canker:** This is not known to affect Aloe Vera.
*   **Gummosis:** This is not known to affect Aloe Vera.
*   **Lichen:** This is not known to affect Aloe Vera as a disease or pest. Lichens are symbiotic organisms (fungus and alga) that grow superficially on plant surfaces, particularly on older leaves or stems, and do not parasitize the plant or draw nutrients from it. They are generally harmless and do not require control measures. Their presence might indicate good air quality or high humidity.
