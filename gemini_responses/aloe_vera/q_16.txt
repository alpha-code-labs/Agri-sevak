As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following fertilizer doses for Aloe Vera cultivation in Haryana. Please note that these are general recommendations for average soil conditions. For precise nutrient management, a soil test is highly recommended to tailor the fertilizer application to your specific field requirements.

**General NPK Recommendations (per acre per year):**
Aloe Vera is a succulent and generally has moderate nutrient requirements. Excessive nitrogen can lead to lush vegetative growth but may reduce gel quality.
*   **Nitrogen (N):** 20-30 kg per acre
*   **Phosphorus (P2O5):** 20-30 kg per acre
*   **Potassium (K2O):** 20-30 kg per acre
*   **Sulphur (S):** 10-15 kg per acre

Based on these general recommendations, here are the specific fertilizer doses:

### Recommended Fertilizer Doses for Aloe Vera (per acre per year)

**1. Basal Application (at planting or early growth phase):**
Apply these fertilizers at the time of planting or as a first application for established plants.

*   **Phosphorus (P2O5) Source:**
    *   **Option A (DAP based):** Apply **45-65 kg Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)** per acre.
        *   *Note:* This will provide approximately 8-12 kg Nitrogen and 20-30 kg P2O5.
    *   **Option B (SSP based, preferred for Sulphur & Calcium):** Apply **125-188 kg Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** per acre.
        *   *Note:* This will provide 20-30 kg P2O5, approximately 15-22 kg Sulphur, and Calcium.

*   **Potassium (K2O) Source:**
    *   Apply **35-50 kg Muriate of Potash (MOP)** per acre.

*   **Sulphur (S) Source:**
    *   If **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** was used as the phosphorus source, it largely covers the Sulphur requirement.
    *   If **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)** and **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** were used, apply **11-17 kg Elemental Sulphur (90%)** per acre.

**2. Nitrogen (Split Applications):**
The total Nitrogen requirement should be met through basal application (if DAP was used) and subsequent split applications of Urea.

*   **Urea:**
    *   After accounting for Nitrogen supplied by **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (if used basally), apply the remaining Nitrogen requirement as **Urea**.
    *   Typically, apply **25-45 kg Urea** per acre, split into 2-3 applications.
        *   First split: 3-4 months after planting.
        *   Subsequent splits: At 3-4 month intervals, especially after harvesting leaves.

**3. Nano-Fertilizers (Foliar Application):**
Nano-fertilizers are effective for foliar application to supplement nutrient requirements, especially during active growth or stress periods.

*   **Nano-Urea:**
    *   Dose: **2-4 ml per litre of water**.
    *   Application: Spray **250-500 ml Nano-Urea** per acre, diluted in 100-200 litres of water, 2-3 times during the growing season (e.g., at 3-4 month intervals).

*   **Nano-DAP:**
    *   Dose: **2-4 ml per litre of water**.
    *   Application: Spray **250-500 ml Nano-DAP** per acre, diluted in 100-200 litres of water, 1-2 times during the growing season, particularly during early growth or flowering.

**4. NPK Complex Fertilizers (Alternative/Supplement):**
While individual fertilizers allow for precise nutrient balancing, if a farmer prefers using complex NPK fertilizers, a balanced grade can be used.

*   **NPK (e.g., 17:17:17 or 19:19:19):**
    *   Apply **50-75 kg NPK (17:17:17 or 19:19:19)** per acre as a basal application.
    *   *Note:* This will partially fulfill the N, P, and K requirements. Adjustments with additional **Urea** and **Muriate of Potash** may be necessary to meet the full recommended doses.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Soil Testing:** Always conduct a soil test to determine the exact nutrient status of your field. This will help in optimizing fertilizer application and preventing nutrient deficiencies or excesses.
*   **Organic Matter:** Incorporating well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost (10-15 tonnes per acre) annually significantly improves soil health and nutrient availability, reducing the need for chemical fertilizers.
*   **Irrigation:** Ensure adequate and timely irrigation, as nutrient uptake is highly dependent on soil moisture.
*   **Application Method:** Granular fertilizers should be broadcast evenly and incorporated into the soil, or applied in bands near the root zone. Foliar sprays should be done during cooler parts of the day.
