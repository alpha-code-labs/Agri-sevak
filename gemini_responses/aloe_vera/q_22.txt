As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified cultivation practices for Aloe Vera in Haryana:

Aloe Vera is primarily propagated vegetatively using suckers or offshoots, as seed propagation is not common for commercial cultivation due to variability and slower growth.

*   **Propagation Method/Pattern:**
    *   Aloe Vera is propagated using healthy suckers (offshoots) or root cuttings obtained from mature, disease-free mother plants.
    *   These planting materials are directly planted in the prepared field.
    *   The planting pattern should be in rows to facilitate inter-cultivation, irrigation, and harvesting operations.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   Suckers or root cuttings should be planted deep enough to cover their entire root system and the base of the stem, typically 10-15 cm.
    *   Ensure that the growing point (the top part of the sucker) remains above the soil surface to prevent rotting.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   Optimal spacing is crucial for proper plant growth, development of large leaves, and ease of field management.
    *   **Row-to-row:** 45-60 cm
    *   **Plant-to-plant:** 30-45 cm
    *   A commonly recommended spacing for good commercial yield in Haryana conditions is 60 cm (row-to-row) x 30 cm (plant-to-plant).

*   **Planting Material Requirement (instead of Seed Dose):**
    *   As Aloe Vera is propagated vegetatively, there is no "seed dose." Instead, the requirement is for the number of suckers or offshoots.
    *   Based on a spacing of 60 cm (row-to-row) x 30 cm (plant-to-plant), approximately 22,000 to 25,000 suckers are required per acre.
