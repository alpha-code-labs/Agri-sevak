Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide you with the scientifically verified requirements for cultivating Aloe Vera in Haryana.

Aloe Vera (Aloe barbadensis miller) is a hardy succulent plant, but optimal growth and gel production depend on specific environmental conditions.

### Suitable Climate for Aloe Vera

Aloe Vera thrives in warm, dry climates and is well-suited to the agro-climatic conditions prevalent in many parts of Haryana.

*   **Temperature:** It prefers a tropical to subtropical climate. The ideal temperature range for its growth is between 20°C and 30°C. It can tolerate temperatures up to 40°C, but prolonged exposure to very high temperatures can stress the plant.
*   **Frost Sensitivity:** Aloe Vera is highly sensitive to frost. Temperatures below 0°C can severely damage or kill the plant. In areas of Haryana prone to severe winter frost, protective measures (like mulching or temporary covers) may be necessary for young plants.
*   **Rainfall:** It is a drought-tolerant plant and does not require high rainfall. An annual rainfall of 500-800 mm is generally sufficient, provided it is well-distributed. Excessive rainfall, especially in poorly drained soils, can lead to root rot.
*   **Sunlight:** It requires abundant sunlight. Full sun exposure (6-8 hours daily) is ideal for robust growth and gel development.

### Suitable Soil Type for Aloe Vera

The right soil type is crucial for preventing waterlogging and ensuring healthy root development.

*   **Texture:** Aloe Vera prefers light, well-drained, and moderately fertile soils. Sandy loam to loamy sand soils are considered ideal. Heavy clay soils that retain too much moisture are unsuitable.
*   **pH:** A slightly acidic to neutral soil pH is optimal, ranging from 6.0 to 8.0.
*   **Organic Matter:** While it doesn't require very rich soil, incorporating a moderate amount of well-decomposed organic matter (like compost or farmyard manure) can improve soil structure and fertility without making it too heavy.
*   **Salinity:** It has a moderate tolerance to salinity, which can be a consideration in some parts of Haryana.

### Drainage Requirement for Aloe Vera

Excellent drainage is paramount for Aloe Vera cultivation.

*   **Waterlogging:** Aloe Vera is extremely susceptible to root rot if its roots sit in waterlogged conditions. Poor drainage is one of the most common causes of failure in Aloe Vera cultivation.
*   **Soil Structure:** The soil must allow water to percolate freely. If the natural soil has poor drainage (e.g., heavy clay), it is essential to amend it with sand, perlite, or organic matter to improve its structure and drainage capacity.
*   **Raised Beds:** In areas with naturally heavy soils or high rainfall, cultivating Aloe Vera on raised beds (15-30 cm high) is highly recommended to ensure adequate drainage and prevent water accumulation around the root zone.
*   **Irrigation Management:** Even with well-drained soil, proper irrigation practices are vital. Water only when the soil is dry to the touch, and avoid overwatering.
