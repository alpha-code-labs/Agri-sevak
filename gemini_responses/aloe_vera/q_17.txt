As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following doses for organic manures in Aloe Vera cultivation, based on scientific principles for enhancing soil fertility and plant growth in Haryana's agro-climatic conditions:

*   **Farm Yard Manure (FYM):**
    *   Apply 15-20 tonnes (15,000-20,000 kg) per acre during land preparation, thoroughly incorporating it into the soil. This provides a broad spectrum of nutrients, improves soil structure, water retention, and microbial activity, which are crucial for the long-term health of Aloe Vera plants.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   Apply 3-5 tonnes (3,000-5,000 kg) per acre during land preparation, or as a top-dressing around the plants in subsequent years (e.g., 1-2 kg per plant per year, split into two applications). Vermicompost is richer in nutrients and beneficial microbes than FYM, promoting vigorous growth and better nutrient uptake.

*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract based bio-stimulant):**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Mix 2.5-3 ml of **Sagarika** per litre of water and spray uniformly on the foliage. Apply at critical growth stages, such as 30-45 days after planting, and then repeat every 2-3 months, especially after harvesting leaves. This helps in enhancing photosynthesis, nutrient uptake, and stress tolerance.
    *   **Soil Drench/Drip Irrigation:** Apply 1-2 litres of **Sagarika** per acre mixed with irrigation water. This can be done during planting or as a regular application every 2-3 months to stimulate root growth and overall plant vigour.
