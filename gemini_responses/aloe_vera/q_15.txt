As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Aloe Vera, keeping in mind the specific conditions and approved practices for Haryana, India:

Here's how to manage the pests you've identified:

### Grasshopper

Grasshoppers are polyphagous pests that can feed on the leaves of Aloe Vera, causing irregular holes and defoliation.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   For small infestations, hand-picking the grasshoppers and their egg masses (found in the soil) can be effective.
    *   Maintain a clean field by removing weeds and debris, which can serve as breeding sites and alternate hosts.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   For larger infestations, consider spraying with CIBRC approved insecticides:
        *   **Malathion** 50% EC at 2 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   Ensure thorough coverage of the plant foliage.

### Painted Bug

This is not known to affect Aloe Vera. The painted bug (Bagrada hilaris/cruciferarum) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops like mustard, cabbage, and radish.

### Red Cotton Bug

This is not known to affect Aloe Vera. The red cotton bug (Dysdercus koenigii) is a specific pest of cotton and other plants belonging to the Malvaceae family.

### Black Ants

Black ants are generally not direct pests of Aloe Vera, meaning they do not typically feed on the plant itself. However, they can be a nuisance, disturb roots by nesting around the plant base, or protect other sap-sucking pests (like mealybugs or aphids) for their honeydew.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Maintain good field sanitation by removing plant debris and weeds that can provide shelter for ants.
    *   Locate and destroy ant nests by disturbing the soil around them.
    *   If ants are present due to other sap-sucking pests, controlling the primary pest will often reduce ant activity.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   For direct nest treatment or perimeter application around the plants:
        *   Drench the ant nests or the soil around the plant base with **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 2.5 ml per litre of water.
        *   Alternatively, use commercially available ant baits containing **Fipronil** (e.g., 0.01% bait formulation) placed near ant trails or nests. These baits are carried back to the colony, eliminating the queen and other ants.
