Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for the ideal transplantation of Aloe Vera in Haryana.

Aloe Vera (Aloe barbadensis miller) is a hardy succulent, but proper transplantation practices are crucial for its successful establishment and optimal growth.

### Ideal Transplantation Time

The most suitable times for transplanting Aloe Vera in Haryana are:

*   **Spring Season (February - March):** This period allows the young plants to establish themselves before the intense summer heat and the onset of the monsoon. The weather is mild, promoting root development.
*   **Post-Monsoon Season (September - October):** This is often considered the most ideal time. The heavy rains have subsided, soil moisture is generally good, and the extreme heat has passed. The plants get sufficient time to establish before the cooler winter months.

Avoid transplanting during the peak summer (May-July) due to extreme heat and during the peak winter (December-January) due to potential frost, which can stress or damage young plants.

### Ideal Transplantation Distance

Optimal spacing is essential for good air circulation, light penetration, ease of interculture operations, and maximizing yield per unit area.

*   **Row-to-Row Distance:** 60 cm
*   **Plant-to-Plant Distance:** 45 cm

This spacing allows for approximately 37,000 plants per acre, providing a good balance between density and individual plant growth. For very fertile soils or specific varieties that grow larger, a slightly wider spacing (e.g., 75 cm x 60 cm) might be considered.

### Transplantation Process

The transplantation process involves careful handling of the pups (suckers) and proper field preparation:

1.  **Selection of Pups:**
    *   Select healthy, disease-free pups (offshoots) that are 10-15 cm tall and have at least 4-5 leaves.
    *   Gently separate them from the mother plant using a sharp, clean knife, ensuring minimal damage to both the mother plant and the pup.

2.  **Callusing of Pups:**
    *   After separation, allow the cut end of the pups to **callus** (dry and heal) for 2-7 days in a shaded, dry, and well-ventilated area. This step is critical as it prevents fungal infections and rot once planted in the soil.

3.  **Land Preparation:**
    *   **Ploughing:** Deep plough the field (20-30 cm) to achieve a fine tilth and improve soil aeration.
    *   **Organic Matter:** Incorporate well-rotted Farmyard Manure (FYM) or compost at a rate of 10-15 tonnes/acre during the final ploughing. This enriches the soil and improves its water-holding capacity and drainage.
    *   **Bed Formation:** For areas prone to waterlogging or heavy soils, prepare raised beds (15-20 cm high) to ensure excellent drainage, which is crucial for Aloe Vera.

4.  **Planting:**
    *   Mark the planting spots according to the recommended spacing (60 cm x 45 cm).
    *   Dig small pits or make furrows at the marked spots.
    *   Place the callused pup in the pit, ensuring that the base of the pup (where the roots will emerge) is just below the soil surface. Do not bury the leaves.
    *   Gently firm the soil around the base of the pup to provide support and ensure good soil-to-root contact.

5.  **Post-Transplantation Care:**
    *   **Initial Watering:** Provide a light watering immediately after planting to settle the soil around the pups. Avoid overwatering.
    *   **Subsequent Watering:** Allow the soil to dry out completely before the next watering, typically after 7-10 days. This encourages the roots to seek moisture and establish firmly. Overwatering is the most common cause of failure in Aloe Vera cultivation.
    *   **Weed Control:** Keep the transplanted area free of weeds, especially during the initial establishment phase, as weeds compete for nutrients and moisture.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure a successful establishment of your Aloe Vera plantation in Haryana.
