Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding Wilt and Parawilt in Aloe Vera. While "Parawilt" is a term more commonly associated with specific conditions in crops like cotton, Aloe Vera can indeed suffer from various wilting diseases, primarily caused by soil-borne fungal pathogens leading to root and crown rot. These conditions can severely impact plant health and yield.

Here's a scientifically verified approach to control wilt in Aloe Vera, focusing on an integrated management strategy suitable for Haryana's conditions:

**Understanding the Cause:**
Wilt in Aloe Vera is often caused by fungal pathogens such as *Fusarium oxysporum*, *Rhizoctonia solani*, and *Phytophthora* species. These pathogens attack the roots and vascular system, hindering water and nutrient uptake, leading to yellowing, drooping, and eventual collapse of the plant. Poor drainage and waterlogging exacerbate these issues.

**Integrated Management Strategies:**

**1. Cultural and Agronomic Practices (Prevention is Key):**

*   **Site Selection and Soil Preparation:**
    *   Choose well-drained fields. Aloe Vera is highly susceptible to waterlogging.
    *   Amend heavy soils with organic matter (e.g., well-rotted farmyard manure) and sand to improve drainage.
    *   Ensure proper land leveling to prevent water accumulation.
*   **Planting Material:**
    *   Use healthy, disease-free suckers or pups from reputable sources.
    *   Inspect planting material thoroughly for any signs of disease or injury before planting.
*   **Irrigation Management:**
    *   Irrigate judiciously. Avoid overwatering, especially during cooler months or in heavy soils.
    *   Allow the soil to dry out slightly between irrigations. Drip irrigation is highly recommended to deliver water directly to the root zone and minimize leaf wetness.
*   **Spacing:**
    *   Maintain adequate plant spacing to ensure good air circulation and reduce humidity around the plants.
*   **Sanitation:**
    *   Promptly remove and destroy infected plants to prevent the spread of pathogens. Do not compost diseased plant material.
    *   Clean and sterilize farm tools and equipment regularly, especially after working with infected plants.
*   **Crop Rotation:**
    *   Practice crop rotation with non-host crops (e.g., cereals) for at least 2-3 years to reduce pathogen build-up in the soil.
*   **Soil Solarization:**
    *   In summer, cover moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks before planting. This can significantly reduce soil-borne pathogen populations.

**2. Biological Control:**

*   **Bio-fungicides:**
    *   **Trichoderma viride** (1-2 kg/acre mixed with 50 kg farmyard manure or sand, applied at planting or as a soil drench).
    *   **Pseudomonas fluorescens** (1-2 kg/acre mixed with 50 kg farmyard manure or sand, applied at planting or as a soil drench).
    *   These beneficial microbes compete with and antagonize pathogenic fungi, enhancing plant health and resistance.

**3. Chemical Control (Use as a last resort or for severe outbreaks):**

When cultural and biological methods are insufficient, CIBRC-approved fungicides can be used. Always follow label instructions carefully regarding dosage, application method, and safety precautions.

*   **For Soil Drenching (at planting or upon early symptom appearance):**
    *   **Carbendazim 50% WP:** Apply as a soil drench at a concentration of 1-2 g/L of water around the base of affected plants. This is effective against *Fusarium* and *Rhizoctonia*.
    *   **Metalaxyl 8% + Mancozeb 64% WP:** Apply as a soil drench at a concentration of 2-2.5 g/L of water. This combination is particularly effective against *Phytophthora* and other Oomycete pathogens, as well as providing broad-spectrum protection.
    *   **Propamocarb Hydrochloride 72.2% SL:** Apply as a soil drench at a concentration of 2-3 ml/L of water. This is highly effective against Oomycete pathogens like *Phytophthora* and *Pythium*.
    *   **Copper Oxychloride 50% WP:** Apply as a soil drench at a concentration of 2-3 g/L of water. This is a broad-spectrum contact fungicide that can help manage various root rot pathogens.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always ensure thorough coverage when drenching.
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in pathogens.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and the prevailing disease pressure in your area.

By implementing these integrated strategies, you can effectively manage and control wilt diseases in your Aloe Vera cultivation.
