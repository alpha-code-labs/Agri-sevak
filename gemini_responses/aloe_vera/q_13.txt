This is not known to affect Aloe Vera.

Fruit flies (e.g., *Bactrocera* species) primarily infest fleshy fruits and some vegetables, while Ber fly (*Carpomyia vesuviana*) specifically targets Ber (Ziziphus mauritiana) fruits. Aloe Vera is a succulent plant cultivated for its leaves, and its reproductive structures (flowers and capsules) are not typically susceptible to these types of fruit-boring pests.
