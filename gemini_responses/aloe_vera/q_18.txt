As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the use of Growth Regulators/Hormones in Aloe Vera for Haryana, India:

It is crucial to understand that the primary commercial value of Aloe Vera lies in its leaves and the gel contained within. Therefore, any application of growth regulators should aim to enhance leaf biomass and gel quality without causing adverse effects.

Here are the recommendations for the specified compounds:

*   **Ethephon** (commonly known by brand name Ethrel)
    *   **CIBRC approved technical name:** **Ethephon**
    *   **Recommendation:** While **Ethephon** is an ethylene-releasing compound that can influence physiological processes such as flowering and senescence in plants, its use as a growth regulator to enhance commercial leaf yield or gel production in Aloe Vera is not a standard or widely recommended practice. Promoting flowering might divert energy from leaf development, which is the primary commercial product. Therefore, its application for general growth regulation in commercial Aloe Vera cultivation is generally not advised.

*   **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid** (commonly known as 2,4-D)
    *   **CIBRC approved technical name:** **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid**
    *   **Recommendation:** **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid** is primarily known and widely used as a broadleaf herbicide. Its application to Aloe Vera, even at very low concentrations typically used for growth regulation in other crops, is not recommended and would likely cause severe phytotoxicity or act as a herbicide, damaging the crop. This is not known to be used as a beneficial growth regulator in Aloe Vera.

*   **Boron**
    *   **CIBRC approved technical name:** **Boron** (as a micronutrient, typically applied as **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** or **Borax**)
    *   **Recommendation:** Boron is an essential micronutrient crucial for various physiological functions in Aloe Vera, including cell wall formation, sugar transport, flowering, and overall plant development. While not a "hormone" in the classical sense, its deficiency can severely impair growth and yield. Application is recommended only when soil tests indicate a deficiency.
        *   **Foliar Application (for deficiency correction):**
            *   Apply **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (e.g., Solubor, 20% Boron) at a concentration of 0.1-0.2% (1-2 g per litre of water).
            *   Alternatively, **Borax** (10.5-11.3% Boron) can be used at 2-4 g per litre of water.
            *   Spray during the active growth phase, preferably in the morning or late afternoon. Repeat if deficiency symptoms persist, based on expert advice and soil/plant tissue analysis.
        *   **Soil Application (for severe deficiency, based on soil test):**
            *   Apply **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** at 0.5-1 kg per acre.
            *   Alternatively, **Borax** at 1-2 kg per acre.
            *   Mix thoroughly with soil before planting or broadcast evenly and irrigate.
        *   **Caution:** Over-application of Boron can be toxic to plants. Always conduct a soil test before application and follow recommended doses precisely to avoid toxicity.
