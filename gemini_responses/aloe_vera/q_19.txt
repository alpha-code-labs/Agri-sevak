As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I advise on addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies in Aloe Vera, specifically Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K), based on scientific verification and CIBRC approved practices for Haryana.

**Crucial First Step: Accurate Diagnosis**
Before applying any fertilizers, it is paramount to conduct a comprehensive soil test and, if possible, leaf tissue analysis. Visual symptoms can be indicative but are not definitive, and over-application of nutrients can be as detrimental as deficiencies. HAU's soil testing labs can provide precise recommendations based on your specific field conditions.

**General Nutrient Management for Aloe Vera in Haryana:**
*   **Soil pH:** Aloe Vera thrives in well-drained soils with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.0. Ensure your soil pH is within this optimal range for efficient nutrient uptake.
*   **Organic Matter:** Regular incorporation of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost at 5-10 tonnes per acre annually significantly improves soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability, reducing the reliance on synthetic fertilizers.
*   **Irrigation:** Maintain consistent, but not excessive, moisture. Proper irrigation is essential for nutrient dissolution and uptake by roots.

### Addressing Nitrogen (N) Deficiency in Aloe Vera

**Symptoms:**
*   General yellowing (chlorosis) of older leaves, starting from the tips and margins.
*   Stunted growth and reduced leaf size.
*   Overall pale green appearance of the plant.

**Correction Measures:**
Based on soil test recommendations, a general guideline for Aloe Vera is 20-40 kg Nitrogen (N) per acre per year. This should be applied in 2-3 split doses to minimize leaching and maximize uptake.
*   **Basal Application:** Apply 1/3rd of the total N requirement at the time of planting or early growth.
*   **Top-dressing:** Apply the remaining N in two equal splits at approximately 3 and 6 months after planting.

**Recommended Fertilizers (Soil Application):**
*   **Urea** (46% N): Apply 45-90 kg per acre to provide 20-40 kg N.
*   Alternatively, **Calcium Ammonium Nitrate (CAN)** (25% N): Apply 80-160 kg per acre.

**For Quick but Temporary Correction (Foliar Spray):**
*   **Urea** (46% N): Prepare a 1-2% solution (10-20 g of Urea per litre of water) and spray on the foliage during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening). Repeat after 10-15 days if needed.

### Addressing Phosphorus (P) Deficiency in Aloe Vera

**Symptoms:**
*   Dark green or purplish discoloration of older leaves, especially on the underside.
*   Stunted growth and poor root development.
*   Delayed maturity.

**Correction Measures:**
Based on soil test recommendations, a general guideline for Aloe Vera is 20-30 kg Phosphorus Pentoxide (P2O5) per acre per year. Phosphorus is relatively immobile in the soil, so it is best applied as a basal dose.

**Recommended Fertilizers (Soil Application):**
*   **Single Superphosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5): Apply 125-188 kg per acre to provide 20-30 kg P2O5.
*   Alternatively, **Di-Ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5): Apply 43-65 kg per acre. (Note: If using DAP, adjust your Nitrogen application accordingly as DAP also supplies N).

### Addressing Potassium (K) Deficiency in Aloe Vera

**Symptoms:**
*   Yellowing and browning (scorching or necrosis) of leaf margins, particularly on older leaves.
*   Weak stems and overall plant weakness.
*   Increased susceptibility to diseases and pests.

**Correction Measures:**
Based on soil test recommendations, a general guideline for Aloe Vera is 20-40 kg Potassium Oxide (K2O) per acre per year. This can be applied in two split doses.
*   **Basal Application:** Apply half of the total K requirement at the time of planting or early growth.
*   **Top-dressing:** Apply the remaining half at approximately 3 months after planting.

**Recommended Fertilizers (Soil Application):**
*   **Muriate of Potash (Potassium Chloride)** (60% K2O): Apply 33-67 kg per acre to provide 20-40 kg K2O.
*   Alternatively, **Sulphate of Potash (Potassium Sulphate)** (50% K2O): Apply 40-80 kg per acre. (Note: SOP also provides Sulphur, which can be beneficial).

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always calibrate your application equipment to ensure uniform distribution of fertilizers.
*   Avoid applying fertilizers directly onto the Aloe Vera leaves or growing points, especially granular fertilizers, as this can cause burn.
*   Monitor your plants regularly for signs of improvement or any adverse reactions.
*   Integrated Nutrient Management (INM), combining organic and inorganic sources, is the most sustainable approach for long-term soil health and plant productivity.
