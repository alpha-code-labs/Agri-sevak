As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling soil pests like termites and root-knot nematodes in Aloe Vera, keeping in mind the agro-climatic conditions of Haryana and CIBRC approved chemicals.

### Control of Soil Pests in Aloe Vera

**1. Termites (Odontotermes obesus, Microtermes obesi, etc.)**

Termites can cause significant damage to Aloe Vera, especially in dry conditions or when plants are stressed, by feeding on the roots and the succulent basal parts of the plant, leading to wilting and eventual plant death.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Ensure proper field sanitation by removing dead wood, stumps, and other organic debris that can serve as termite food sources or nesting sites.
    *   Maintain adequate soil moisture, as termites prefer dry conditions.
    *   Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost, as fresh organic matter can attract termites.

*   **Chemical Control (Pre-planting/Post-planting):**
    *   **Pre-planting Soil Treatment:** Before planting, treat the soil to create a protective barrier.
        *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC**: Mix 2.5-3.0 ml of **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** per litre of water and apply 5 litres of this solution per square meter of soil surface, mixing it thoroughly into the top 15-20 cm of soil.
    *   **Post-planting (for established plants):** If termite infestation is observed in established plants.
        *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC**: Prepare a solution by mixing 2.5-3.0 ml of **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** per litre of water. Drench the soil around the base of the affected plants with 1-2 litres of this solution per plant, ensuring it penetrates the root zone.

**2. Nematodes (Root-knot Nematodes - Meloidogyne spp.)**

Root-knot nematodes are a major threat to Aloe Vera, causing galls or knots on the roots, leading to stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, reduced yield, and increased susceptibility to other diseases.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Solarization:** During hot summer months (May-June), plough the field, irrigate it, and then cover it with a transparent polyethylene sheet (100-micron thickness) for 4-6 weeks. This raises soil temperature sufficiently to kill nematodes.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** While Aloe Vera is perennial, if replanting in the same area, rotate with non-host crops like marigold (Tagetes spp.) or certain cereals for at least 2-3 years to reduce nematode populations.
    *   **Use Healthy Planting Material:** Always use nematode-free suckers or plantlets for propagation.
    *   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM), neem cake (500 kg/acre), or other organic matter into the soil. Neem cake has nematicidal properties and enhances soil health.

*   **Biological Control:**
    *   **Purpureocillium lilacinum (formerly Paecilomyces lilacinus)**: Apply 2.5-5 kg of **Purpureocillium lilacinum** (a bio-nematicide) per acre. Mix it with 100 kg of well-decomposed FYM or compost and apply it uniformly to the soil before planting or around the root zone of established plants. Irrigate lightly after application.

*   **Chemical Control (Pre-planting/Post-planting):**
    *   **Pre-planting Soil Treatment:**
        *   **Carbofuran 3% G**: Apply 10-15 kg of **Carbofuran 3% G** per acre by broadcasting and thoroughly mixing it into the soil to a depth of 15-20 cm, 1-2 weeks before planting.
        *   **Phorate 10% G**: Apply 4-6 kg of **Phorate 10% G** per acre by broadcasting and mixing into the soil before planting.
    *   **Post-planting (for established plants):**
        *   **Carbofuran 3% G**: For established plants, apply 10-15 kg of **Carbofuran 3% G** per acre as a side-dressing around the base of the plants and lightly incorporate it into the soil, followed by irrigation.
        *   **Phorate 10% G**: Apply 4-6 kg of **Phorate 10% G** per acre as a side-dressing for established plants, followed by light incorporation and irrigation.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully, including dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods, is the most sustainable and effective strategy for long-term pest control.
*   Regular monitoring of your Aloe Vera plants for early signs of pest infestation is crucial for timely intervention.
