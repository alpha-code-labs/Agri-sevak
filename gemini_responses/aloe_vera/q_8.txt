Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding sucking pests in Aloe Vera. Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, Thrips, and Psylla are indeed significant pests that can cause considerable damage by sucking sap from the leaves, leading to stunted growth, leaf curling, yellowing, and transmission of viral diseases.

Here's a scientifically verified approach for their control in Aloe Vera:

### Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies

Before resorting to chemical control, it is crucial to adopt an integrated approach:

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Regularly remove weeds from and around the Aloe Vera field, as they can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
    *   **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to improve air circulation and reduce humidity, which can discourage pest build-up.
    *   **Balanced Nutrition:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, as it can lead to lush, soft growth that is more attractive to sucking pests.
    *   **Water Management:** Ensure proper irrigation to maintain plant vigour, making them more resilient to pest attack.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Encourage natural enemies such as ladybird beetles, lacewings, and parasitic wasps, which prey on aphids, whiteflies, and other soft-bodied insects. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

3.  **Physical Methods:**
    *   **Yellow Sticky Traps:** Install yellow sticky traps (10-15 traps per acre) at plant height to monitor pest populations and for mass trapping of whiteflies, leafhoppers, and winged aphids.

### Chemical Control (When necessary)

Chemical intervention should be considered when pest populations reach economic threshold levels. Always scout your field regularly to assess pest incidence. Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

**For effective control of Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, Thrips, and Psylla, consider the following CIBRC approved technical chemicals:**

1.  **Broad-Spectrum Systemic Insecticides (Effective against most sucking pests):**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at a rate of **0.5 - 1.0 ml per litre of water** (or 100-200 ml per acre in 200-400 litres of water).
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at a rate of **0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water** (or 80-100 g per acre in 200-400 litres of water).
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply at a rate of **0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water** (or 80-100 g per acre in 200-400 litres of water).

2.  **Insect Growth Regulators (Primarily for Whitefly nymphs and Hoppers):**
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at a rate of **1.0 - 1.25 ml per litre of water** (or 400-500 ml per acre in 200-400 litres of water). This is particularly effective against the nymphal stages of whiteflies and some hoppers.

3.  **Specific Action Insecticides:**
    *   **Diafenthiuron 50% WP:** Effective against whiteflies, thrips, and mites. Apply at a rate of **1.0 - 1.25 g per litre of water** (or 250-300 g per acre in 200-400 litres of water).
    *   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** Primarily effective against whiteflies and mites. Apply at a rate of **0.5 - 0.75 ml per litre of water** (or 200-300 ml per acre in 200-400 litres of water).
    *   **Fipronil 5% SC:** Effective against thrips and leafhoppers. Apply at a rate of **1.0 - 1.5 ml per litre of water** (or 400-600 ml per acre in 200-400 litres of water).
    *   **Flonicamid 50% WG:** Highly effective against aphids and also shows good activity against whiteflies. Apply at a rate of **0.3 g per litre of water** (or 60 g per acre in 200 litres of water).
    *   **Spinosad 45% SC:** A biological insecticide effective against thrips. Apply at a rate of **0.25 - 0.3 ml per litre of water** (or 60-75 ml per acre in 200-250 litres of water).

### Important Considerations:

*   **Rotation of Chemicals:** To prevent the development of pesticide resistance, always rotate insecticides with different modes of action. Do not use the same chemical or chemicals from the same group repeatedly.
*   **Spray Timing:** Apply insecticides during the cooler parts of the day, preferably early morning or late evening, to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   **Thorough Coverage:** Ensure complete and uniform coverage of the plant, especially the undersides of the leaves where many sucking pests reside.
*   **Safety Precautions:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, and protective clothing while handling and spraying chemicals. Follow the instructions on the product label carefully.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Be mindful of the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) mentioned on the product label, especially if you are harvesting Aloe Vera leaves for commercial purposes.

By implementing these strategies, you can effectively manage sucking pests in your Aloe Vera crop and ensure healthy plant growth and good yields. For any further specific queries, please feel free to consult with our experts at HAU, Hisar.
