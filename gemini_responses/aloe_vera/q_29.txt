This is not known to affect Aloe Vera.

Aloe Vera is primarily cultivated for its leaves, from which gel and latex are extracted. While Aloe Vera does produce flowers, flower drop is not considered an economically significant issue requiring specific control measures in its cultivation. Aloe Vera does not produce "fruit" or "tinda/bolls" in the agricultural sense that would be harvested or cause economic loss if dropped.
