As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling these pests in Aloe Vera, keeping in mind the specific context of Haryana, India.

**General Principles for Pest Management in Aloe Vera:**
Effective pest management relies on a combination of cultural practices and, when necessary, judicious use of chemical controls. Regular monitoring of your Aloe Vera plants is crucial to detect pest infestations early.

**1. Weevils (including Root Weevils):**
Weevils, particularly root weevils, can be a significant pest of Aloe Vera. They can damage roots, leading to stunted growth, wilting, and even plant death. Some species may also feed on leaves.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy any infested plant material or debris around the plants.
    *   **Soil Health:** Ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging, which can stress plants and make them more susceptible. Use well-draining potting mixes for potted plants.
    *   **Inspection:** Regularly inspect the base of the plants and roots (if possible) for signs of weevil larvae or adults.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** If growing in beds, rotate Aloe Vera with non-host plants if possible, though this is less common for perennial Aloe.

*   **Chemical Control (for severe infestations):**
    *   For root weevils, systemic insecticides applied as a soil drench are often most effective. For foliar-feeding weevils, a spray can be used. Always follow the specific instructions and safety precautions on the product label.
    *   **Soil Drench (for root weevils):**
        *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: Apply 1-2 ml per litre of water as a soil drench around the base of the plant.
        *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: Apply 2.5 ml per litre of water as a soil drench.
        *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: Apply 0.5-1 g per litre of water as a soil drench.
    *   **Foliar Spray (for adult weevils feeding on leaves):**
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: Apply 0.5-1 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Cypermethrin** 25% EC: Apply 0.5 ml per litre of water.

**2. Beetles (General Chewing Beetles):**
While specific major beetle pests are not commonly associated with Aloe Vera, some generalist chewing beetles might occasionally feed on the leaves. If observed, the control measures for foliar-feeding weevils can be applied.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   **Hand-picking:** For small infestations, adult beetles can be hand-picked and destroyed.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Keep the area around the plants free of weeds and debris that can harbor beetles.

*   **Chemical Control (if infestation is significant):**
    *   The foliar spray options listed for weevils (e.g., **Lambda-cyhalothrin**, **Cypermethrin**) can be effective against chewing beetles. Always ensure thorough coverage of the plant foliage.

**3. Sawflies:**
This is not known to affect Aloe Vera. Sawflies are primarily pests of trees and shrubs, and are not typically found on succulents like Aloe Vera.
