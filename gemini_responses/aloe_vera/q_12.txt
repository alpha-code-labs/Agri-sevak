Scale insects and Mealybugs are common sucking pests that can significantly affect Aloe Vera plants, leading to stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, and reduced plant vigour. Their waxy coverings and tendency to hide in crevices make them challenging to control.

Here's a scientifically verified approach for their control in Aloe Vera:

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Control (First Line of Defence):**

*   **Regular Inspection:** Frequently inspect your Aloe Vera plants, especially the undersides of leaves and leaf axils, for early detection of these pests.
*   **Manual Removal:** For small infestations, use a cotton swab dipped in rubbing alcohol (ethanol) to directly dab and remove individual scale insects and mealybugs. A strong jet of water can also dislodge them.
*   **Pruning:** Heavily infested leaves or plant parts should be pruned and destroyed immediately to prevent further spread. Ensure pruning tools are disinfected before and after use.
*   **Isolation:** Isolate newly acquired plants or infested plants from healthy ones to prevent the spread of pests.
*   **Maintain Plant Health:** Healthy plants are more resilient to pest attacks. Ensure proper watering, adequate sunlight, and well-draining soil. Avoid over-fertilization, especially with nitrogen, as it can promote succulent new growth that is attractive to sucking pests.

**2. Chemical Control (For Moderate to Severe Infestations):**

When cultural and mechanical methods are insufficient, chemical intervention may be necessary. Due to the waxy coating of these pests, systemic insecticides or insect growth regulators (IGRs) are often more effective. Always ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and in leaf axils.

Please use the following CIBRC approved technical chemical names and dosages:

*   **For Systemic Action (effective against hidden pests):**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at a rate of **0.5 - 1.0 ml per liter of water**.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at a rate of **0.2 - 0.4 g per liter of water**.
    *   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:** Apply at a rate of **0.75 - 1.0 ml per liter of water**. This is particularly effective against scales and mealybugs due to its unique two-way systemic action.

*   **For Insect Growth Regulator (IGR) Action (targets nymphal stages):**
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at a rate of **1.25 - 1.5 ml per liter of water**. This chemical interferes with the molting process of nymphs, preventing them from developing into adults.

*   **For Contact and Systemic Action (broad-spectrum):**
    *   **Dimethoate 30% EC:** Apply at a rate of **1.5 - 2.0 ml per liter of water**.

**Important Precautions:**

*   **Read the Label:** Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the pesticide label regarding dosage, application method, safety precautions, and re-entry intervals.
*   **Protective Gear:** Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, and protective clothing during mixing and application.
*   **Timing of Application:** Apply insecticides during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   **Repeat Application:** Multiple applications at recommended intervals (usually 7-10 days) may be necessary, especially for severe infestations, to break the pest life cycle. Rotate different classes of insecticides to prevent the development of resistance.
*   **Spot Treatment:** For localized infestations, consider spot treatments rather than spraying the entire plant.
*   **Environmental Safety:** Avoid spraying near water bodies or during windy conditions to prevent environmental contamination. Dispose of empty containers safely.
