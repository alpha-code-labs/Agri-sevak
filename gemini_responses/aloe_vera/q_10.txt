As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in Aloe Vera in Haryana:

**1. Borers:**
This is not known to affect Aloe Vera.

**2. Caterpillars:**
Caterpillars can occasionally feed on Aloe Vera leaves, especially young plants. Effective management strategies include:

*   **Cultural and Mechanical Methods:**
    *   Regular monitoring of plants to detect early signs of infestation.
    *   Hand-picking and destroying visible caterpillars, particularly in smaller cultivation areas.
    *   Maintaining field sanitation to reduce potential hiding spots and alternate host plants.

*   **Biological Control:**
    *   Encourage natural predators and parasitoids in the field.
    *   Application of **Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)** formulations at a rate of 1-2 g/L of water, targeting young larval stages.

*   **Chemical Control (if infestation is severe):**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC: 0.3 ml/L of water (60 ml/acre)
    *   **Emamectin Benzoate** 5% SG: 0.4 g/L of water (80 g/acre)
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: 0.5 ml/L of water (100 ml/acre)
    *   **Spinosad** 45% SC: 0.25 ml/L of water (50 ml/acre)

**3. Diamondback moth:**
This is not known to affect Aloe Vera.

**4. Leaf folder:**
