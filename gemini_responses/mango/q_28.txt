As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I advise on protecting mango trees from environmental stresses prevalent in Haryana. Implementing these practices can significantly enhance the resilience and productivity of your mango orchard.

### Protecting Mango from Extreme Cold and Frost

Mango is sensitive to cold, especially young plants and during flowering/fruiting.

*   **Irrigation:** Irrigate the orchard thoroughly a day or two before a predicted frost event. Moist soil retains heat better than dry soil, releasing it slowly overnight and keeping the root zone warmer.
*   **Covering Young Trees:** For young mango plants (up to 3-4 years old), provide physical protection by covering them with straw, gunny bags, or plastic sheets during cold nights. Ensure the cover does not touch the foliage directly to prevent contact freezing. Remove covers during the day.
*   **Smudging/Smoking:** In commercial orchards, creating a smoke screen by burning organic matter (like crop residues, dry leaves) on the upwind side of the orchard can help raise ambient temperature and prevent heat radiation loss from the trees. This is most effective during still, clear nights.
*   **Windbreaks:** Establish shelterbelts of tall, fast-growing trees (e.g., Eucalyptus, Poplar) around the orchard perimeter. These act as barriers against cold, desiccating winds, reducing their impact on the mango trees.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure balanced nutrition, particularly adequate **Potassium**, as it plays a crucial role in improving plant tolerance to various stresses, including cold.

### Protecting Mango from Heat/Loo (Hot Winds) and Intense Sunlight

Haryana summers are characterized by extreme heat and hot, dry winds (Loo), which can cause sunscald, leaf scorch, and fruit drop.

*   **Adequate Irrigation:** During hot periods, ensure regular and sufficient irrigation to keep the soil consistently moist. This is critical for maintaining plant turgor, facilitating transpiration (which cools the plant), and preventing wilting and sunscald.
*   **Mulching:** Apply a thick layer (10-15 cm) of organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves, bagasse, wood chips) around the base of the trees, extending to the drip line. Mulch helps conserve soil moisture, reduces soil temperature, and suppresses weed growth.
*   **Windbreaks:** As mentioned for cold, windbreaks are equally vital in protecting trees from the desiccating effects of hot, dry winds (Loo), which can cause severe moisture stress and leaf burn.
*   **Shading for Young Trees:** Provide temporary shade structures (e.g., shade nets with 30-50% shade factor, palm fronds, or other locally available materials) for young mango plants during peak summer months to protect them from direct, intense sunlight.
*   **Trunk Whitewashing:** Paint the main trunk and lower scaffold branches with a white lime wash. This reflects sunlight, significantly reduces bark temperature, and prevents sunscald and cracking of the bark.
*   **Kaolin Clay Spray:** Apply a spray of **Kaolin clay** (a naturally occurring mineral) at a concentration of 50-75 g/L of water. This forms a reflective white film on the leaves and fruits, reducing canopy temperature by reflecting solar radiation and protecting against sunscald. Repeat application may be needed after heavy rains or every 2-3 weeks during peak heat periods.
