Namaste, as a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing these pests in Mango orchards in Haryana.

It is crucial to adopt an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, mechanical, biological, and judicious chemical methods for sustainable pest control.

Here's how to control the mentioned pests:

### 1. Borers (e.g., Mango Stem Borer, Shoot Borer)

Borers can cause significant damage by tunneling into the stem, branches, or shoots, leading to wilting and dieback.

*   **Cultural/Mechanical Control:**
    *   Regularly inspect trees for signs of borer attack (e.g., frass, gum exudation, boreholes).
    *   Remove and destroy affected branches or shoots.
    *   For stem borers, physically remove grubs from boreholes using a hooked wire.
*   **Chemical Control (for severe infestations):**
    *   For stem borers, inject a solution of insecticide into the boreholes and plug them with mud.
        *   **Chlorpyrifos** (20 ml per litre of water for injection/swabbing).
    *   For shoot borers, spray the affected parts.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** (0.5 ml per litre of water).
        *   **Imidacloprid** (0.3 ml per litre of water).

### 2. Caterpillars (e.g., Leaf Webber, Defoliating Caterpillars)

Various caterpillar species can feed on mango leaves, flowers, and sometimes fruits.

*   **Cultural/Mechanical Control:**
    *   Remove and destroy leaf webs containing larvae and pupae.
    *   Hand-pick larger caterpillars if infestation is localized.
*   **Chemical Control (for widespread infestation):**
    *   Spray when young larvae are observed.
        *   **Chlorantraniliprole** (0.3 ml per litre of water).
        *   **Emamectin benzoate** (0.2 g per litre of water).
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** (0.5 ml per litre of water).

### 3. Diamondback Moth

This is not known to affect Mango. Diamondback moth (*Plutella xylostella*) is a major pest primarily of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower, mustard).

### 4. Leaf Folder (e.g., Mango Leaf Folder)

Leaf folders roll or fold leaves and feed from within, causing defoliation and affecting photosynthesis.

*   **Cultural/Mechanical Control:**
    *   Prune and destroy infested leaves or shoots where larvae are present.
*   **Chemical Control (for significant damage):**
    *   Spray when initial signs of leaf folding are observed.
        *   **Chlorantraniliprole** (0.3 ml per litre of water).
        *   **Emamectin benzoate** (0.2 g per litre of water).
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** (0.5 ml per litre of water).

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the pesticide label regarding dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Ensure proper coverage during spraying for effective control.
*   Rotate different classes of insecticides to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension officers or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and the prevailing pest situation.
