As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following fertilizer doses for Mango cultivation in Haryana. Please note that these are general guidelines, and a precise recommendation can only be made after a thorough soil test of your orchard.

**General Principles for Mango Fertilization:**
1.  **Soil Testing:** It is highly recommended to conduct a soil test every 2-3 years to determine the exact nutrient status of your soil and tailor fertilizer applications accordingly.
2.  **Tree Age:** Fertilizer requirements vary significantly between young (non-bearing) and mature (bearing) trees.
3.  **Timing:** Fertilizers are typically applied in split doses, usually before the monsoon (June-July) and after fruit harvest (August-September).
4.  **Method:** Granular fertilizers are applied in a ring around the tree canopy drip line, 30-45 cm away from the trunk, and thoroughly mixed with the soil, followed by irrigation. Foliar fertilizers are sprayed directly onto the leaves.

**Recommended Fertilizer Doses for Mango (per tree per year):**

**A. For Young (Non-Bearing) Trees (1-5 years):**
The dose should be gradually increased each year. Start with 1/10th of the bearing tree dose in the first year and increase it progressively to reach the full bearing dose by the 5th year.

*   **Year 1:**
    *   **Urea**: 100-120 g
    *   **DAP**: 100-110 g
    *   **Muriate of Potash (Potash)**: 100-125 g
    *   **Sulphur (Elemental Sulphur 90%)**: 15-20 g
    *   **NPK (e.g., 19:19:19)**: As a supplementary foliar spray, 2-3 g/L water (1-2 sprays).
    *   **Nano-Urea**: 2-3 ml/L water (1-2 foliar sprays).
    *   **Nano-DAP**: 2-3 ml/L water (1-2 foliar sprays).

*   **Year 2-5:** Increase the dose by approximately 100-120 g of **Urea**, 100-110 g of **DAP**, 100-125 g of **Muriate of Potash**, and 15-20 g of **Sulphur** each year, until the 5th year.

**B. For Bearing Trees (6 years and above):**
For a mature, productive mango tree, the general recommendation is to provide 750-1000 g Nitrogen (N), 500 g Phosphorus (P2O5), 750-1000 g Potassium (K2O), and 150-200 g Sulphur (S) per tree per year. This translates to the following fertilizer quantities:

*   **Urea (46% N)**: 1.0 - 1.2 kg per tree
    *   *Application:* Split into two equal doses. First dose in June-July (pre-monsoon) and second dose in August-September (post-harvest).
*   **DAP (18% N, 46% P2O5)**: 1.0 - 1.1 kg per tree
    *   *Application:* Apply the full dose once a year, preferably in June-July (pre-monsoon).
*   **SSP (Single Super Phosphate - 16% P2O5, 11% S)**:
    *   *Alternative to DAP + Elemental Sulphur:* If you choose to use **SSP** instead of **DAP** and separate **Sulphur**, apply 3.0 - 3.2 kg per tree. In this case, the **Urea** dose would need to be increased to approximately 1.6 kg per tree as **SSP** provides no Nitrogen.
    *   *Application:* Apply the full dose once a year, preferably in June-July (pre-monsoon).
*   **Potash (Muriate of Potash - 60% K2O)**: 1.2 - 1.3 kg per tree
    *   *Application:* Split into two equal doses. First dose in June-July (pre-monsoon) and second dose in August-September (post-harvest).
*   **Sulphur (Elemental Sulphur 90%)**: 150 - 170 g per tree
    *   *Application:* Apply the full dose once a year, preferably in June-July (pre-monsoon), especially if **DAP** is used instead of **SSP**.
*   **NPK (Compound Fertilizers)**:
    *   For basal application, if a compound fertilizer like **NPK (12:32:16)** is preferred, approximately 1.5 - 2.0 kg per tree can be applied, adjusting other fertilizers to meet the total NPK requirements.
    *   For foliar application, **NPK (19:19:19)** can be sprayed at 5-10 g/L water, especially during flowering and fruit development stages (2-3 sprays).
*   **Nano-Urea (4% N)**: 2-4 ml/L water
    *   *Application:* 2-3 foliar sprays during active vegetative growth and fruit development stages.
*   **Nano-DAP (8% N, 16% P2O5)**: 2-4 ml/L water
    *   *Application:* 2-3 foliar sprays during flowering and fruit setting stages.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Micronutrients:** Mango also requires micronutrients like Zinc, Boron, Manganese, and Iron. If soil tests indicate deficiencies, apply appropriate micronutrient mixtures or chelated forms as foliar sprays.
*   **Organic Manures:** Supplementing chemical fertilizers with well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost (20-50 kg per tree per year for bearing trees) significantly improves soil health and nutrient uptake.
*   **Irrigation:** Ensure adequate irrigation after fertilizer application to facilitate nutrient dissolution and uptake by the roots.
*   **Tree Health:** Adjust fertilizer doses based on the tree's vigor, yield, and any visible deficiency symptoms.
