As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, here is the scientifically verified advice for mango transplantation in Haryana:

**1. Ideal Transplantation Time:**
The most suitable time for transplanting mango saplings in Haryana is during the monsoon season, specifically from **July to September**. This period ensures adequate soil moisture, which is crucial for the establishment and survival of young saplings. Planting during this time minimizes the need for frequent irrigation immediately after transplantation.

**2. Transplantation Distance:**
The spacing between mango trees depends on the variety, soil fertility, and the planting system adopted.

*   **Traditional Planting System:** For vigorous varieties, a spacing of **10 meters x 10 meters** is generally recommended. This allows for ample canopy development and air circulation.
*   **High-Density Planting (HDP):** For semi-vigorous or dwarf varieties, especially when rootstock and pruning are managed, HDP can be adopted for higher yields per unit area.
    *   **5 meters x 5 meters**
    *   **6 meters x 6 meters**
    *   *Note:* HDP requires specific management practices, including regular pruning to maintain tree size.

**3. Transplantation Process:**

*   **Pit Preparation (1-2 months before planting):**
    *   Dig pits of **1 meter x 1 meter x 1 meter** (length x width x depth) at the marked distances.
    *   Allow the pits to remain open for 15-20 days to expose the soil to sunlight, which helps in sterilizing and killing soil-borne pests and pathogens.
    *   Fill each pit with a mixture of:
        *   Topsoil (from the pit)
        *   **20-25 kg** well-decomposed Farmyard Manure (FYM) or compost
        *   **1 kg** Single Super Phosphate (SSP) (Optional, for phosphorus)
        *   **100 g** Neem cake (for pest deterrence)
        *   If the soil is heavy clay, add **5-10 kg** of sand to improve drainage.
    *   Heap the soil mixture slightly above ground level as it will settle over time.

*   **Sapling Selection:**
    *   Obtain healthy, vigorous, and disease-free grafted saplings (preferably 1-2 years old) from a certified nursery.
    *   Ensure the graft union is clearly visible and well-healed.

*   **Planting the Sapling:**
    *   Carefully remove the sapling from its polybag or container without disturbing the root ball. If it's a polybag, cut it open from the bottom and sides.
    *   Place the sapling in the center of the prepared pit.
    *   Ensure that the graft union remains **10-15 cm** above the ground level to prevent scion rooting and maintain the benefits of the rootstock.
    *   Backfill the pit with the remaining soil mixture, gently firming the soil around the root ball to remove air pockets.
    *   Create a small basin or ring around the sapling for efficient irrigation.

*   **Post-Planting Care:**
    *   Immediately after planting, irrigate the sapling thoroughly.
    *   Provide support to the young sapling with a sturdy stake (e.g., bamboo stick) to protect it from strong winds and ensure upright growth.
    *   Mulch the base of the sapling with dry leaves, straw, or black plastic to conserve soil moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature.
    *   Protect young saplings from grazing animals and harsh sunlight (if necessary, by providing temporary shade).
