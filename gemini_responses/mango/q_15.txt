As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for managing the mentioned pests in Mango orchards in Haryana:

### Control of Pests in Mango

**1. Grasshopper**
Grasshoppers can cause damage by feeding on leaves, young shoots, flowers, and sometimes young fruits.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Maintain orchard hygiene by regularly removing weeds, which can serve as alternate hosts and breeding grounds for grasshoppers.
    *   Deep ploughing during off-season can expose and destroy eggs laid in the soil.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   For severe infestations, especially during the early stages of fruit development, chemical intervention may be necessary.
    *   Spray with:
        *   **Malathion 50% EC** at 1.0 - 1.5 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC** at 0.5 ml per litre of water.

**2. Painted Bug (Bagrada hilaris)**
This is not known to affect Mango. Painted bug is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops like mustard, cabbage, and cauliflower.

**3. Red Cotton Bug (Dysdercus cingulatus)**
This is not known to affect Mango. Red cotton bug is primarily a pest of cotton and other malvaceous plants.

**4. Black Ants**
Black ants are often secondary pests in mango, primarily attracted to the honeydew secreted by other sap-sucking insects like mealybugs, scales, and aphids. They protect these honeydew-producing pests from natural enemies, thus exacerbating the primary pest problem. They can also sometimes interfere with pollination or damage young fruits.

*   **Cultural and Mechanical Practices:**
    *   Control honeydew-producing pests (mealybugs, scales) to reduce the food source for ants.
    *   Keep the orchard floor clean and free of weeds.
    *   Prune lower branches to prevent ants from climbing directly from the ground onto the tree canopy.
    *   Apply sticky bands (e.g., grease bands or non-drying glue) around the tree trunk at a height of about 30-45 cm from the ground to prevent ants from climbing up.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   To control ants directly, especially those nesting at the base of the tree or forming trails:
        *   Drench the soil around the base of the tree with **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** at 2.5 ml per litre of water.
        *   Apply **Fipronil 0.3% GR** granules around the base of the tree at 10-20 grams per tree, followed by light irrigation.

Always ensure proper safety measures, including wearing protective gear, while handling and applying pesticides. Follow the instructions on the product label for dosage, application method, and pre-harvest interval.
