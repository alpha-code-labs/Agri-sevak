As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide scientifically verified advice for managing beetles, weevils, and sawflies in mango orchards in Haryana. Effective control involves a combination of cultural practices and judicious use of CIBRC-approved chemical interventions.

**General Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Principles:**
*   **Orchard Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy fallen fruits, prune dead or infested branches, and clear weeds around the trees.
*   **Regular Monitoring:** Inspect trees frequently for signs of pest activity, especially during critical growth stages like flowering and fruit development.
*   **Tree Vigor:** Ensure proper nutrition and irrigation to maintain healthy, vigorous trees, which are more resilient to pest attacks.

### 1. Control of Beetles

The most significant beetle pest affecting mango in Haryana is the **Mango Stem Borer (Batocera rufomaculata)**.

**Symptoms:**
*   Presence of sawdust-like frass (excreta) near boreholes on the trunk or branches.
*   Drying and wilting of affected branches.
*   Large holes in the bark or wood.

**Control Measures:**
*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Locate the boreholes and probe them with a hooked wire to kill the grubs inside.
    *   Remove and destroy severely infested branches.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Injection Method:**
        *   Inject 5-10 ml of **Chlorpyrifos** 20 EC (diluted 1:1 with water) or **Imidacloprid** 17.8 SL (diluted 1:1 with water) into the boreholes using a syringe.
        *   Immediately plug the holes with mud or wet clay to prevent the escape of fumes and ensure efficacy.
        *   Repeat the treatment if fresh frass is observed.
    *   **Drenching/Spraying (for young grubs/adults):**
        *   Apply **Fipronil** 5 SC at 1.5-2 ml/L of water as a drench around the base of the tree or spray on affected bark where young grubs might be active.

### 2. Control of Weevils

The primary weevil pest of concern in mango is the **Mango Stone Weevil (Sternochetus mangiferae)**.

**Symptoms:**
*   Small, dark punctures on the surface of developing fruits.
*   Grubs feeding inside the mango stone, leading to fruit decay and reduced market value.

**Control Measures:**
*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Collect and destroy all fallen fruits, as they often contain weevil grubs or pupae.
    *   Ploughing the soil around the trees during winter can expose and kill pupae in the soil.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Initiate spraying when fruits are at the pea-size stage and repeat 2-3 times at 10-15 day intervals, targeting the egg-laying adults and newly hatched larvae.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5 EC at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Cypermethrin** 25 EC at 0.3 ml/L of water.
    *   **Fipronil** 5 SC at 1.5-2 ml/L of water.
    *   **Thiamethoxam** 25 WG at 0.2 g/L of water.
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8 SL at 0.3 ml/L of water.

### 3. Control of Sawflies

The **Mango Sawfly (Hoplocampa sp.)** is a known pest that can cause significant damage to flowers and young fruits.

**Symptoms:**
*   Small holes in flower buds and young fruits.
*   Premature shedding of flowers and young fruits.
*   Larvae may be found feeding on flowers or boring into young fruits.

**Control Measures:**
*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Monitor the orchard closely during the flowering and early fruit set stages.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Apply sprays during the flowering and early fruit set stages when sawfly activity is observed.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5 EC at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Cypermethrin** 25 EC at 0.3 ml/L of water.
    *   **Deltamethrin** 2.8 EC at 1 ml/L of water.
    *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20 EC at 2.5 ml/L of water (ensure adherence to pre-harvest interval).

**Important Considerations for Chemical Application:**
*   **Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the pesticide label** regarding dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   **Observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI)** to ensure the safety of the fruit for consumption and to avoid chemical residues.
*   **Rotate insecticides with different modes of action** to prevent the development of pesticide resistance in pest populations.
*   **Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE)**, including gloves, masks, and protective clothing, during handling and application of pesticides.
*   **Consult with your local agricultural extension services** for the most current and specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and local pest pressure.
