As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following doses of Growth Regulators/Hormones for Mango cultivation in Haryana, based on scientific verification:

### Recommended Doses of Growth Regulators/Hormones in Mango

**1. Ethephon** (Technical name for Ethrel)

*   **Purpose:** Flower induction and fruit ripening.
*   **Dose for Flower Induction:**
    *   Apply **Ethephon** at 200-500 ppm (parts per million) of active ingredient.
    *   *Practical Dose:* For a 39% Ethephon SL formulation (containing 390 g/L of active ingredient), this translates to approximately **0.5 - 1.3 ml/L** of water.
    *   *Application Timing:* Apply during October-November, when vegetative flush has matured, to promote flowering in shy-bearing varieties or off-year.
*   **Dose for Fruit Ripening:**
    *   Apply **Ethephon** at 500-1000 ppm of active ingredient.
    *   *Practical Dose:* For a 39% Ethephon SL formulation, this translates to approximately **1.3 - 2.6 ml/L** of water.
    *   *Application Timing:* Spray 7-10 days before the anticipated harvest, ensuring uniform coverage.

**2. 2,4-D**

*   **Purpose:** Prevention of pre-harvest fruit drop and improvement of fruit retention.
*   **Dose:**
    *   Apply **2,4-D** (Sodium Salt formulation) at a very low concentration of 10-20 ppm of active ingredient.
    *   *Practical Dose:* For an 80% 2,4-D Sodium Salt formulation, this translates to approximately **0.01 - 0.025 g/L** of water.
    *   *Application Timing:* Spray when fruits are at pea to marble size (after fruit set). Avoid higher concentrations as they can be phytotoxic.

**3. Boron**

*   **Purpose:** Essential micronutrient for pollen viability, fruit set, fruit development, and prevention of internal fruit disorders (e.g., spongy tissue, internal necrosis).
*   **Dose (Foliar Spray):**
    *   Apply **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate, containing approximately 11% elemental Boron) as a foliar spray at 0.1% - 0.2% concentration.
    *   *Practical Dose:* This translates to **1 - 2 g/L** of **Borax** in water.
    *   *Application Timing:* Spray twice – once before flowering (at bud differentiation stage) and again after fruit set (when fruits are small).
*   **Dose (Soil Application):**
    *   For soils confirmed to be Boron deficient through soil testing, apply **Borax** at 100-200 g per mature tree annually.
    *   *Application Timing:* Apply in the root zone during the monsoon season or before flowering. Soil testing is highly recommended before soil application.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always ensure thorough mixing and uniform spray coverage.
*   Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during application.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension officers or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and mango variety.
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label for safe and effective use.
