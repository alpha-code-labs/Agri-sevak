Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding viral diseases in mango. It is crucial to understand that once a plant is infected with a virus, there is generally no direct chemical cure. Management strategies primarily focus on prevention and controlling the vectors that transmit these viruses.

Let's address each condition you've mentioned:

1.  **Leaf curl (Mango Leaf Curl Virus - MLCV):**
    *   **Status in Mango:** This is a significant viral disease affecting mango in India, including Haryana. It is caused by the Mango Leaf Curl Virus (MLCV), a geminivirus, and is transmitted by the whitefly, *Bemisia tabaci*.
    *   **Symptoms:** Characterized by severe curling, puckering, and thickening of leaves, especially young ones. Veins may swell, and internodes shorten, leading to a bushy, stunted appearance.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   **Use Healthy Planting Material:** Always source grafts or saplings from certified, virus-free nurseries.
        *   **Rogueing:** Promptly remove and destroy (burn or bury) severely infected plants or branches to prevent further spread.
        *   **Vector Management (Whitefly Control):** Since whiteflies transmit the virus, managing their population is critical. Apply insecticides targeting whiteflies, especially during periods of new flush growth when whitefly activity is high.
            *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: 0.2 g/L of water
            *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: 0.3 ml/L of water
            *   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP: 0.2 g/L of water
            *   **Buprofezin** 25% SC: 1.25 ml/L of water
            *   **Diafenthiuron** 50% WP: 1.2 g/L of water
        *   **Cultural Practices:** Maintain good orchard hygiene, balanced nutrition, and proper irrigation to enhance plant vigor and tolerance.

2.  **Mosaic:**
    *   **Status in Mango:** While mosaic-like symptoms (patches of light and dark green on leaves) can occasionally be observed in mango, a distinct, widespread "Mango Mosaic Virus" with significant economic impact is not as well-defined or prevalent as MLCV. Such symptoms, if viral, would generally be managed through the same principles as MLCV.
    *   **Control Measures:** Focus on using healthy planting material and managing potential insect vectors if identified.

3.  **Yellow vein clearing:**
    *   **Status in Mango:** This is not known to affect Mango. Yellow vein clearing is a characteristic symptom of certain viral diseases, notably in crops like okra (Okra Yellow Vein Mosaic Virus).

4.  **Stripe:**
    *   **Status in Mango:** This is not known to affect Mango. Stripe diseases are typically associated with cereal crops (e.g., Maize Stripe Virus).

5.  **Tristeza:**
    *   **Status in Mango:** This is not known to affect Mango. Citrus Tristeza Virus (CTV) is a major viral disease primarily affecting citrus species.

6.  **Stunt virus:**
    *   **Status in Mango:** This is not known to affect Mango as a specific named virus. While stunting can be a symptom of various plant stresses, including severe viral infections like MLCV, "Stunt virus" itself is not a recognized primary viral pathogen of mango.

**General Principles for Managing Viral Diseases in Mango:**

*   **Prevention is Key:** As there are no curative treatments for viral diseases, preventing infection is paramount.
*   **Certified Planting Material:** Always procure grafts, seedlings, or rootstock from reputable, certified nurseries that guarantee virus-free material.
*   **Vector Control:** Identify and manage insect vectors (like whiteflies for MLCV) that transmit viruses. Regular monitoring and timely application of appropriate insecticides are crucial.
*   **Sanitation (Rogueing):** Promptly remove and destroy infected plants or plant parts to reduce the source of inoculum within the orchard.
*   **Good Horticultural Practices:** Maintain optimal plant health through balanced fertilization, proper irrigation, and timely pruning. Healthy plants are generally more resilient to disease.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** If available and suitable for your region, consider planting mango varieties known to have resistance or tolerance to specific viral diseases.

For any specific concerns or severe outbreaks, it is always advisable to consult with the plant pathology experts at HAU, Hisar, for precise diagnosis and tailored recommendations.
