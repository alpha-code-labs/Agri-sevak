Dear Farmer,

Regarding your query about rust diseases in Mango, it's important to clarify the specific pathogens:

*   **Black Rust, Brown Rust, Yellow Rust, and White Rust:** These diseases are primarily caused by specific fungi (e.g., *Puccinia* species for cereal rusts, *Albugo* for white rust) that are **not known to affect Mango.**

*   **Red Rust:** This condition, often referred to as 'Red Rust' in mango, is actually caused by a parasitic alga, *Cephaleuros virescens*. It manifests as reddish-brown, velvety patches on leaves, twigs, and sometimes fruits, particularly in humid conditions and on less vigorous trees. While not a true fungal rust, it can reduce photosynthetic efficiency and overall tree health.

Here's how to manage Red Rust (*Cephaleuros virescens*) in Mango:

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Improve Tree Vigor:** Ensure proper nutrition and irrigation to maintain healthy, vigorous trees, as stressed trees are more susceptible.
*   **Pruning:** Prune dense canopies to improve air circulation and light penetration, reducing humidity within the tree. Remove and destroy severely infected leaves and twigs.
*   **Weed Control:** Keep the area around the trees free of weeds to reduce humidity and potential alternative hosts.

**2. Chemical Control:**
For effective control, especially during periods of high humidity or if the disease is severe, fungicidal sprays can be applied.
*   Spray with **Copper oxychloride** at a concentration of 2.5-3.0 g/L of water. Ensure thorough coverage of the affected parts.
*   Alternatively, **Bordeaux mixture** (1%) can be used.

It is crucial to follow the recommended dosages and safety precautions mentioned on the product label. Always consult with your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions.
