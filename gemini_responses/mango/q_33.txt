As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an integrated approach to weed management in mango orchards, combining cultural, mechanical, and chemical methods for effective and sustainable control.

### 1. Orobanche (Broomrape)

This is not known to affect Mango. Orobanche species are typically parasitic on herbaceous dicotyledonous plants, primarily solanaceous crops, legumes, and some oilseeds, and are not considered a direct parasitic threat to woody perennial fruit trees like Mango.

### 2. General Weed Control (Broadleaf, Narrowleaf, Bathu, Congress grass, Phalaris minor)

These weeds are common in mango orchards and can be managed through the following strategies:

#### A. Cultural and Mechanical Methods:

*   **Manual Weeding/Hoeing:** Regular hand weeding or hoeing, especially during the initial establishment phase of the orchard, is highly effective. This should be done before weeds set seed.
*   **Inter-cultivation:** Shallow inter-cultivation can be done in the inter-row spaces, taking care not to damage the root system of the mango trees.
*   **Mulching:** Applying organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves, wood chips) around the base of the trees helps suppress weed growth, conserve soil moisture, and improve soil health.
*   **Cover Cropping:** In wider inter-row spaces, growing suitable leguminous cover crops can suppress weeds and enrich the soil, provided they do not compete with the mango trees for resources.

#### B. Chemical Methods (Herbicides):

Herbicides should be used judiciously as directed sprays, avoiding contact with the mango tree trunk, foliage, or fruits. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions.

**i. Pre-emergence Herbicides (Applied to bare soil before weed emergence):**
These are effective against germinating broadleaf and narrowleaf weeds. Apply to a moist soil surface after orchard cleaning.

*   **Diuron** (80% WP): Apply at 1.0-1.5 kg/acre.
*   **Oxyfluorfen** (23.5% EC): Apply at 1.0-1.5 L/acre.
*   **Pendimethalin** (30% EC): Apply at 3.0-4.0 L/acre.

**ii. Post-emergence Herbicides (Applied to actively growing weeds):**
These are non-selective and should be used as directed sprays to target weeds only, avoiding contact with the mango tree.

*   **Glyphosate** (41% SL): Effective against a wide range of broadleaf and narrowleaf weeds, including Bathu, Congress grass, and Phalaris minor. Apply at 2.5-4.0 L/acre (or 10-15 ml/L of water for spot application) in 200-400 L of water.
*   **Paraquat dichloride** (24% SL): A contact herbicide, effective for quick knockdown of green vegetation. Apply at 2.0-3.0 L/acre (or 8-12 ml/L of water for spot application) in 200-400 L of water.
*   **Glufosinate-ammonium** (13.5% SL): A non-selective contact herbicide with some systemic action. Apply at 1.0-1.5 L/acre (or 4-6 ml/L of water for spot application) in 200-400 L of water.

### 3. Amarbail (Cuscuta spp. - Dodder)

Amarbail is a parasitic weed that can severely affect mango trees if not controlled early.

*   **Manual Removal:** This is the most effective method. As soon as Amarbail is observed, manually remove the infested parts of the mango tree (if minor infestation) or the entire parasitic plant from the host. Ensure all detached fragments are removed from the orchard and destroyed, as they can re-establish.
*   **Host Removal:** If Amarbail is growing on other non-crop plants or weeds near the mango orchard, remove and destroy those host plants to prevent its spread to mango.
*   **Pre-emergence Control:** **Pendimethalin** (30% EC) at 3.0-4.0 L/acre can offer some control by inhibiting the germination of Amarbail seeds in the soil, but its effectiveness against established Amarbail is limited.
*   **Post-emergence (Directed Spray):** If Amarbail is growing on weeds in the inter-row spaces and not directly on the mango tree, non-selective herbicides like **Glyphosate** or **Paraquat dichloride** can be used as directed sprays to kill the host weeds and the Amarbail growing on them. Extreme caution is needed to prevent spray drift onto mango trees. If Amarbail has already infested the mango tree, chemical control is very difficult without harming the mango tree itself, making manual removal the primary recommendation.

### Important Precautions for Herbicide Application:

*   **Directed Spray:** Always use a protective hood or shield on the spray nozzle to ensure the herbicide spray is directed only onto the weeds and does not come into contact with the mango tree trunk, branches, leaves, or fruits.
*   **Wind Conditions:** Avoid spraying on windy days to prevent drift onto desirable plants.
*   **Soil Moisture:** Ensure adequate soil moisture for pre-emergence herbicides to be effective.
*   **Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):** Always wear appropriate PPE (gloves, mask, protective clothing, eye protection) during mixing and spraying.
*   **Read Label:** Always read and strictly follow the instructions, dosages, and safety precautions mentioned on the herbicide product label.
*   **Water Quality:** Use clean water for mixing herbicides.
*   **Timing:** Apply herbicides at the recommended growth stage of weeds for optimal efficacy.

By adopting these integrated weed management practices, you can effectively control weeds in your mango orchard and ensure healthy tree growth and productivity.
