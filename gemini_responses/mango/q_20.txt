As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide scientifically verified advice on addressing micronutrient deficiencies in Mango for the Haryana region.

**General Recommendations for Micronutrient Management in Mango:**

Before applying any micronutrients, it is crucial to:
1.  **Soil and Leaf Tissue Analysis:** Conduct regular soil and leaf tissue analysis to accurately diagnose specific deficiencies. Visual symptoms can sometimes be misleading.
2.  **Integrated Approach:** Combine soil application for long-term maintenance with foliar sprays for quick correction of acute deficiencies.
3.  **Timing:** Apply micronutrients during critical growth stages such as pre-flowering flush (October-November), post-fruit set (March-April), and post-harvest (June-July) for optimal absorption and utilization.
4.  **Water Quality:** Use good quality water for foliar sprays. In Haryana, hard water is common, which can affect spray efficacy.
5.  **Wetting Agent:** Always add a non-ionic wetting agent (spreader) at recommended rates to foliar sprays for better coverage and absorption.

Here's how to address specific micronutrient deficiencies:

### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Small, narrow leaves (often called 'little leaf'), rosetting of leaves, interveinal chlorosis, reduced shoot growth, and poor fruit set.
*   **Foliar Application:**
    *   Spray 0.25-0.5% solution of **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** (21% Zn) (2.5-5 g/L of water) or 0.15-0.3% solution of **Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate** (33% Zn) (1.5-3 g/L of water).
    *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 15-day intervals during active growth flushes.
*   **Soil Application (for severe or persistent deficiency):**
    *   Apply 250-500 g of **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** (21% Zn) per mature tree, or 150-300 g of **Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate** (33% Zn) per mature tree, once every 2-3 years. Apply in the root zone and mix with soil.

### 2. Iron (Fe) / Ferrous Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Prominent interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on young leaves, with veins remaining green. In severe cases, leaves may turn almost white. Common in alkaline soils of Haryana.
*   **Foliar Application:**
    *   Spray 0.2-0.5% solution of **Ferrous Sulphate Heptahydrate** (19% Fe) (2-5 g/L of water) or 0.1-0.2% solution of **Iron EDTA** (13% Fe) (1-2 g/L of water). Chelated forms like Iron EDTA are more effective in alkaline conditions.
    *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals until symptoms disappear.
*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Soil application of iron is generally less effective in high pH (alkaline) soils of Haryana due to rapid fixation. If used, apply **Iron EDTA** (13% Fe) at 50-100 g per mature tree, mixed into the soil around the root zone.

### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Dieback of growing points, cracking of fruits, internal browning, corky tissue in fruits, poor fruit set, and malformed fruits.
*   **Foliar Application:**
    *   Spray 0.1-0.2% solution of **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (20% B) (1-2 g/L of water) or **Boric Acid** (17% B) (1-2 g/L of water).
    *   Apply 1-2 sprays, especially before flowering and after fruit set.
*   **Soil Application (Use with extreme caution due to narrow margin between deficiency and toxicity):**
    *   Apply 50-100 g of **Borax** (11% B) or 25-50 g of **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (20% B) per mature tree, once every 2-3 years. Apply evenly in the root zone.

### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Dieback of growing points, stunted growth, premature fruit drop, and sometimes internal fruit disorders.
*   **Foliar Application:**
    *   Spray 0.5-1.0% solution of **Calcium Nitrate** (19% Ca) (5-10 g/L of water) or **Calcium Chloride** (27% Ca) (5-10 g/L of water).
    *   Apply 2-3 sprays during fruit development, starting from fruit set.
*   **Soil Application:**
    *   For general soil health and calcium supply, especially if soil analysis indicates low calcium, apply **Gypsum** (23% Ca) at 250-500 kg/acre, particularly beneficial in sodic/saline-sodic soils common in parts of Haryana.

### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, starting from the leaf margins and progressing inwards, often with reddish-brown discoloration. Leaves may become brittle.
*   **Foliar Application:**
    *   Spray 0.5-1.0% solution of **Magnesium Sulphate Heptahydrate** (9.6% Mg) (5-10 g/L of water).
    *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 15-day intervals during active growth.
*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply 250-500 g of **Magnesium Sulphate Heptahydrate** (9.6% Mg) per mature tree, once a year, mixed into the soil around the root zone.

### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, similar to iron deficiency but often with a mottled or speckled appearance, sometimes with small necrotic spots.
*   **Foliar Application:**
    *   Spray 0.2-0.5% solution of **Manganese Sulphate Monohydrate** (30.5% Mn) (2-5 g/L of water).
    *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals until symptoms disappear.
*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Soil application of manganese is less effective in high pH (alkaline) soils. If used, apply 100-200 g of **Manganese Sulphate Monohydrate** (30.5% Mn) per mature tree, mixed into the soil.

**Important Considerations for Haryana:**

*   **Alkaline Soils:** Most soils in Haryana are alkaline (high pH), which reduces the availability of micronutrients like Iron, Zinc, and Manganese. Foliar application is often more effective for quick correction in such conditions.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (gloves, mask, eye protection) while handling and applying chemicals. Follow label instructions carefully.
*   **Consultation:** For precise recommendations tailored to your specific orchard and soil conditions, it is always advisable to consult with local agricultural extension officers or HAU experts.
