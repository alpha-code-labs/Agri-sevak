As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice on irrigation management for mango orchards in Haryana. Efficient water management is crucial for optimal yield and fruit quality, especially given our region's climatic conditions.

Here is the detailed information:

### Irrigation Management in Mango

**1. First Irrigation**

*   **Timing:** The first irrigation is critically important and should be applied **after fruit set**, once the young fruits have reached the size of a pea or marble. This typically falls between **March and early April**, depending on the specific year's climate and the tree's phenology.
*   **Rationale:**
    *   **Pre-flowering and Flowering Period (November-February):** It is essential to withhold or significantly reduce irrigation during this period. Moisture stress during these months helps to induce flowering and prevents excessive vegetative growth, which can negatively impact fruit set.
    *   **Post-Fruit Set:** Once fruits have successfully set, the tree requires adequate moisture to prevent premature fruit drop and support the initial stages of fruit enlargement, especially as temperatures begin to rise.
*   **Quantity:** A thorough irrigation is required to wet the root zone adequately. For mature trees, this could involve delivering approximately **80-100 litres per tree** if using basin irrigation, or a calculated amount to saturate the effective root zone.

**2. Second Irrigation**

*   **Timing:** The second irrigation should generally be applied approximately **2-3 weeks after the first irrigation**, typically in **April to May**, depending on the soil moisture status and prevailing high temperatures.
*   **Rationale:** This irrigation, and subsequent ones, are vital for continuous fruit enlargement and development, particularly during the hot and dry pre-monsoon period when the tree's water demand is high.
*   **Frequency:** Subsequent irrigations should continue at intervals of **10-15 days** for mature trees grown on sandy loam soils. This interval may need to be adjusted for heavier clay soils (longer intervals) or very light sandy soils (shorter intervals) until the onset of the monsoon rains.

**3. Sprinkler Use (Micro-Irrigation Systems)**

*   **Recommendation:** Micro-irrigation systems, particularly **drip irrigation**, are highly recommended for mango orchards in Haryana. These systems offer superior water use efficiency, which is crucial for sustainable agriculture in our water-scarce region. While overhead sprinklers can be used for young orchards, drip irrigation is generally preferred for mature trees due to its precision and efficiency.
*   **Advantages of Drip Irrigation:**
    *   **Water Saving:** Reduces water consumption by **50-70%** compared to traditional flood irrigation methods.
    *   **Uniform Water Distribution:** Ensures precise and uniform application of water directly to the tree's root zone, minimizing wastage.
    *   **Nutrient Efficiency (Fertigation):** Facilitates **fertigation**, allowing for the precise and timely delivery of water-soluble fertilizers along with irrigation water, improving nutrient uptake and reducing fertilizer losses.
    *   **Reduced Weed Growth:** Minimizes water availability to weeds between tree rows, thereby reducing weed competition.
    *   **Improved Soil Aeration:** Prevents waterlogging and helps maintain optimal soil aeration, which is beneficial for root health.
    *   **Disease Management:** Keeps the foliage dry, which can help in reducing the incidence of certain foliar fungal diseases compared to overhead irrigation methods.
    *   **Labour Saving:** Reduces the labour required for irrigation and fertilizer application.
*   **Application Details (Drip Irrigation):**
    *   **Frequency:** Drip irrigation allows for more frequent, shorter irrigations, which helps in maintaining a consistent and optimal soil moisture level around the root zone.
    *   **Quantity:** For mature mango trees during peak demand (hot, dry months), typically **20-40 litres per tree per day** is recommended. This quantity should be adjusted based on factors such as tree size, canopy spread, soil type, and prevailing evapotranspiration rates.
    *   **Installation:** It is generally recommended to install two drippers per mature tree, placed on opposite sides within the tree's drip line, to ensure adequate wetting of the entire active root zone.
