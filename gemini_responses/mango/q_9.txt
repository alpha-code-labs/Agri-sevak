Mites (Red spider mite and Rust mite) are known to affect Mango and can cause significant damage if not managed properly. Here's how to control them:

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   **Pruning:** Regularly inspect trees and prune off severely infested or malformed shoots/buds (especially for rust mites/mango bud mites). Destroy the pruned material by burning.
*   **Orchard Hygiene:** Keep the orchard clean by removing weeds, which can act as alternate hosts for mites.
*   **Water Management:** Ensure proper irrigation to reduce plant stress, as stressed plants are more susceptible to mite infestations.

**2. Chemical Control (Acaricides):**
For effective control, especially during periods of high infestation, consider applying CIBRC approved acaricides. Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage, especially the undersides of leaves and young shoots.

*   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP:** Apply at a concentration of **2.5-3.0 g/L** of water. This is particularly effective against rust mites and also helps control red spider mites and powdery mildew.
*   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** Apply at a concentration of **0.5 ml/L** of water. This is a highly effective acaricide against a wide range of mites, including red spider mites and eriophyid mites.
*   **Fenpyroximate 5% SC:** Apply at a concentration of **0.5-1.0 ml/L** of water. This provides good control against various mite species.
*   **Propargite 57% EC:** Apply at a concentration of **1.0-1.5 ml/L** of water. This is a well-established miticide.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Rotation:** To prevent the development of resistance, rotate different classes of acaricides. Do not use the same chemical repeatedly.
*   **Timing:** Apply acaricides when mite populations are building up, typically during dry and warm weather. Repeat application may be necessary after 10-15 days if the infestation persists.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure complete coverage of the plant, especially the undersides of leaves where mites often reside.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) and follow the instructions and safety precautions mentioned on the product label.
