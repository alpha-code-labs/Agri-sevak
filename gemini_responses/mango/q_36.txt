Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I am pleased to provide you with scientifically verified recommendations to improve yield, fruit quality, and storage life for mango cultivation in Haryana. An integrated approach combining good agricultural practices, balanced nutrition, and timely pest and disease management is crucial.

Here are the key strategies:

### 1. Improving Yield

To maximize mango yield, focus on regular bearing, optimal nutrient supply, and effective fruit retention.

*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Balanced Fertilization:** Apply NPK based on soil test reports. A general recommendation for a mature bearing tree (10+ years) is 750-1000 g Nitrogen, 250-500 g Phosphorus, and 750-1000 g Potassium per tree per year, applied in two splits (June-July and September-October).
    *   **Micronutrients:** Deficiencies of Zinc, Boron, and Copper are common and can significantly reduce yield.
        *   Foliar spray of **Zinc sulphate** (0.5%, i.e., 5 g/L of water) along with 0.25% lime, twice a year (pre-flowering and post-fruit set).
        *   Foliar spray of **Sodium tetraborate decahydrate** (Borax) (0.2-0.4%, i.e., 2-4 g/L of water) at pre-flowering and marble stage.
        *   Foliar spray of **Copper sulphate** (0.2%, i.e., 2 g/L of water) if copper deficiency is observed.
*   **Regulation of Bearing (for alternate bearing varieties):**
    *   **Paclobutrazol:** To induce regular flowering and fruiting in 'off' years, apply **Paclobutrazol** (23% SC formulation) as a soil drench around the tree basin in September-October. The dose varies with tree age and canopy size, typically 5-10 ml per tree for 10-15 year old trees, diluted in 5-10 litres of water.
    *   **Ethephon:** For early and uniform flowering, foliar spray of **Ethephon** (39% SL formulation) at 2.5-5 ml per 10 litres of water (approx. 100-200 ppm) in October-November, when temperatures are around 20-25°C.
*   **Fruit Drop Management:**
    *   To reduce pre-harvest fruit drop, spray **Naphthalene Acetic Acid** (NAA) (4.5% SL formulation) at 10-20 ppm (0.2-0.4 ml per litre of water) at pea size fruit stage.
*   **Pollination:** Ensure adequate pollination by maintaining healthy bee populations or introducing bee colonies during flowering.
*   **Irrigation:** Provide critical irrigation during flowering, fruit set, and fruit development stages. Avoid water stress during these periods.

### 2. Enhancing Fruit Quality

High-quality fruits are characterized by good size, uniform colour, desirable taste, and freedom from blemishes.

*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Potassium:** Adequate Potassium (K) is vital for fruit size, sweetness, and colour development. Ensure sufficient application of Muriate of Potash (MOP) as per soil test.
    *   **Calcium:** Calcium (Ca) improves fruit firmness and reduces physiological disorders. Foliar sprays of **Calcium nitrate** or **Calcium chloride** (0.5-1%, i.e., 5-10 g/L of water) at 15-day intervals, starting from fruit set until 3-4 weeks before harvest, can significantly improve fruit quality.
    *   **Boron:** Boron (B) deficiency can lead to fruit cracking and malformation. Ensure timely application of **Sodium tetraborate decahydrate** (Borax) as mentioned above.
*   **Water Management:** Consistent soil moisture during fruit development is crucial. Irregular watering can lead to fruit cracking and uneven ripening.
*   **Canopy Management:** Proper pruning to ensure adequate sunlight penetration throughout the canopy promotes uniform fruit colour and sugar development.
*   **Fruit Thinning:** If the fruit load is excessively high, manual thinning at the pea or marble stage can improve the size and quality of the remaining fruits.
*   **Pest and Disease Control:** Timely management of pests (e.g., fruit fly, mealybug) and diseases (e.g., anthracnose, powdery mildew) prevents blemishes and ensures healthy fruit development.

### 3. Extending Storage Life

Improving storage life involves pre-harvest practices that enhance fruit firmness and reduce susceptibility to post-harvest decay.

*   **Pre-harvest Calcium Sprays:**
    *   As mentioned for fruit quality, foliar sprays of **Calcium nitrate** or **Calcium chloride** (0.5-1%, i.e., 5-10 g/L of water) applied 3-4 times from fruit set until 3-4 weeks before harvest, significantly strengthen cell walls, leading to firmer fruits with reduced susceptibility to chilling injury and post-harvest rots.
*   **Disease Management:**
    *   **Anthracnose Control:** Anthracnose (caused by *Colletotrichum gloeosporioides*) is a major post-harvest disease. Pre-harvest sprays of fungicides like **Carbendazim** (0.5 g/L of water) or **Mancozeb** (2 g/L of water) during flowering and fruit development stages can reduce inoculum load.
    *   **Stem End Rot:** Caused by various fungi, it can be managed by ensuring proper harvesting techniques and pre-harvest fungicidal sprays.
*   **Pest Management:** Control of fruit flies and other insect pests is critical, as their damage provides entry points for pathogens, leading to rapid spoilage.
    *   Use fruit fly traps and timely sprays of recommended insecticides like **Lambda-cyhalothrin** (0.5 ml/L of water) or **Imidacloprid** (0.3 ml/L of water) as per CIBRC guidelines, ensuring pre-harvest intervals are strictly followed.
*   **Harvesting at Proper Maturity:** Harvest fruits at the physiologically mature stage, but before they start ripening on the tree. This stage varies by variety but is crucial for optimal storage.
*   **Careful Handling:** Minimize physical damage (bruises, cuts) during harvesting and handling, as these are primary entry points for pathogens and accelerate ripening.
*   **Post-harvest Treatments (Brief Mention):** While primarily a post-harvest operation, hot water treatment (52°C for 5-10 minutes) or fungicidal dips (e.g., **Carbendazim** 1 g/L) immediately after harvest can further reduce post-harvest decay and extend shelf life.

### 4. Integrated Approach

*   **Variety Selection:** Choose varieties suitable for Haryana's agro-climatic conditions and market demand, known for good yield, quality, and reasonable shelf life (e.g., Dashehari, Langra, Chausa, Amrapali).
*   **Soil Health:** Maintain good soil health through regular addition of organic matter (Farm Yard Manure or vermicompost) and proper drainage.
*   **Weed Management:** Control weeds effectively to reduce competition for nutrients and water.
*   **Pruning and Training:** Regular pruning for canopy architecture, removal of dead/diseased branches, and improved air circulation.

By implementing these scientifically backed practices, you can significantly enhance the yield, fruit quality, and storage life of your mango produce in Haryana. Always consult your local agricultural extension office or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions.
