As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding mango maturity signs, harvesting time, and cutting process for cultivation in Haryana:

### Maturity Signs for Mango

Determining the correct maturity is crucial for optimal fruit quality and shelf life. Look for a combination of these indicators:

*   **Shoulder Development:** The most reliable sign is when the 'shoulders' of the fruit (the area near the stem end) fill out and become plump, often rising above the stem attachment point. Immature fruits will have sunken shoulders.
*   **Skin Colour Change:** While specific colour changes vary by variety, mature fruits typically show a slight lightening of the dark green colour to a lighter green, yellowish-green, or even a blush of yellow or red on some varieties. The dull, dark green of immature fruit will diminish.
*   **Development of Bloom:** A whitish, powdery coating (bloom) often develops on the fruit surface of mature mangoes.
*   **Fruit Firmness:** Mature fruits will feel firm and solid.
*   **Specific Gravity:** For commercial growers, a simple test involves placing fruits in water. Mature fruits tend to sink, while immature ones float. This is due to higher sugar and starch content in mature fruits.
*   **Days from Flowering:** While variety-specific, knowing the typical number of days from flowering to maturity for your particular mango variety can serve as a guide.

### Harvesting Time

*   **Season:** In Haryana, mango harvesting typically commences from **late May and extends through June to early July**, depending on the variety, local climatic conditions, and the specific year's weather patterns. Early varieties mature first, followed by mid and late-season varieties.
*   **Time of Day:** The best time for harvesting is during the **early morning hours (after the dew has dried)** or in the **late afternoon/evening**. Harvesting during the hottest part of the day should be avoided as high temperatures can increase sap flow, lead to rapid respiration, and reduce the fruit's shelf life.

### Cutting Process

The correct cutting process is vital to prevent sap burn and mechanical damage, which can significantly reduce fruit quality and marketability.

1.  **Use Appropriate Tools:** Always use sharp, clean harvesting tools such as specialized mango harvesters (with a net to catch the fruit) or sharp secateurs/pruning shears. This ensures a clean cut and minimizes damage to both the fruit and the tree.
2.  **Leave a Short Stalk:** Cut the fruit with a **1-2 cm stalk (pedicel)** attached. This small stalk helps prevent the milky sap from oozing directly onto the fruit skin. Sap burn causes black lesions and reduces market value.
3.  **Sap Management:**
    *   **Drainage:** After harvesting, immediately place the fruits **upside down (stem end downwards)** on a slanting surface or in a single layer in crates for about 30 minutes to 1 hour. This allows the sap to drain away from the fruit surface.
    *   **Avoid Contact:** Do not stack fruits immediately after harvesting, as sap from one fruit can contaminate others.
    *   **Washing (Optional):** Some growers gently wash the fruits with water after sap drainage to remove any residual sap, but this must be done carefully to avoid introducing pathogens.
4.  **Gentle Handling:** Mangoes are delicate. Handle them gently at all stages to avoid bruising, which can lead to internal browning and spoilage.
5.  **Collection:** Collect harvested fruits in clean, padded crates or baskets to prevent physical damage during transport from the orchard.
