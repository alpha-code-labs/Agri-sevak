As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the significant challenge wild animals pose to mango cultivation in Haryana. Protecting mango orchards from animals like monkeys, nilgai (blue bull), wild boars, and birds requires a multi-faceted approach. Here are scientifically verified methods to mitigate damage:

### Methods to Protect Mango from Wild Animals:

1.  **Physical Barriers:**
    *   **Fencing:**
        *   **For Nilgai and Wild Boar:** Install strong, tall fences around the orchard perimeter. Options include barbed wire, chain-link fences, or stone walls. Electric fences, if permitted and installed safely according to local regulations, can be highly effective. The fence height should be at least 2-2.5 meters to deter nilgai.
        *   **For Monkeys:** High fences with an inward-sloping overhang can deter monkeys. Netting over individual trees or entire orchards (though expensive and labor-intensive for large areas) is the most effective physical barrier against monkeys and birds.
    *   **Tree Guards:** For young mango saplings, use physical guards made of wire mesh or thorny branches around the trunk to prevent damage from grazing animals.

2.  **Cultural Practices and Orchard Management:**
    *   **Timely Harvesting:** Harvest fruits as soon as they reach maturity. Overripe or fallen fruits attract a wide range of animals.
    *   **Orchard Sanitation:** Regularly clear fallen fruits, leaves, and debris from the orchard floor. This reduces attraction and removes potential hiding spots for some animals.
    *   **Habitat Modification:** Remove dense vegetation, bushes, and tall grasses around the orchard perimeter that might provide cover or nesting sites for wild animals.
    *   **Intercropping/Border Crops:** Planting unpalatable or thorny crops (e.g., certain varieties of cactus, thorny bushes) as a border around the mango orchard can act as a deterrent.

3.  **Repellents (Non-Chemical/Sensory):**
    *   **Visual Repellents:**
        *   **Scarecrows:** Periodically move or change the appearance of scarecrows to prevent animals from habituating.
        *   **Reflective Tapes and Shiny Objects:** Hanging reflective ribbons, old CDs, or aluminum foil strips can deter birds and sometimes monkeys due to their movement and glare.
        *   **Predator Eye Balloons:** Balloons with large, painted "eyes" can sometimes deter birds and monkeys.
    *   **Auditory Repellents:**
        *   **Sound Devices:** Use of loud noises, firecrackers (with local permission and extreme caution), or recorded distress calls of specific animals can temporarily scare them away. However, animals often habituate to constant sounds.
        *   **Human Presence:** Regular human activity and noise in the orchard can deter many wild animals.

4.  **Human Presence and Guarding:**
    *   **Watchmen/Guards:** Employing human guards, especially during the critical fruiting season, is one of the most effective methods against monkeys, nilgai, and wild boars. Their constant presence and vigilance can significantly reduce damage.
    *   **Guard Dogs:** Trained guard dogs can be effective in deterring animals, particularly at night.

5.  **Community-Based Approaches:**
    *   **Coordinated Efforts:** Work with neighboring farmers to implement protection strategies across a larger area. This can be more effective than individual efforts, as animals often move between farms.
    *   **Local Authorities:** Engage with local forest department or wildlife authorities for advice and potential assistance, especially for protected or problematic species.

**Note on Chemical Repellents:**
As per CIBRC guidelines, there are currently no CIBRC-approved technical chemical names specifically registered for repelling large wild animals like monkeys, nilgai, or wild boars from mango orchards in India. Therefore, I cannot recommend any specific chemical repellents for this purpose. Focus should be on physical barriers, cultural practices, and sensory deterrents.
