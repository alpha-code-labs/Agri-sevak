As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified cultivation practices for Mango in Haryana:

**1. Sowing Method/Pattern:**
*   **Propagation Method:** For commercial mango cultivation, direct sowing of seeds is generally not recommended as mangoes do not breed true to type from seed. Instead, **vegetative propagation** methods like **grafting (e.g., veneer grafting, in-situ grafting) or budding** are used to ensure desired varietal characteristics. Farmers should procure healthy, certified grafted saplings from reputable nurseries.
*   **Planting Pattern:**
    *   **Square System:** This is the most common and recommended system. Plants are planted at the corners of a square, making inter-cultural operations (tillage, irrigation, spraying) easy in both directions.
    *   **Hexagonal System:** This system accommodates about 15% more plants than the square system but makes inter-cultural operations slightly more complex.
    *   **Pit Preparation:** Pits of 1 m x 1 m x 1 m size should be dug during May-June, exposed to sunlight for 15-20 days, and then refilled with a mixture of topsoil, 20-25 kg farmyard manure (FYM), 1 kg single super phosphate, and 100 g **chlorpyrifos** dust (for termite control) before the monsoon.

**2. Planting Depth:**
*   The grafted sapling should be planted at the **same depth** as it was in the nursery bag or pot.
*   It is crucial to ensure that the **graft union (the point where the scion and rootstock are joined) remains well above the soil level** (at least 15-20 cm) to prevent scion rooting and ensure the benefits of the rootstock.
*   After planting, gently firm the soil around the root ball and provide immediate light irrigation.

**3. Spacing:**
*   Spacing depends on the variety, rootstock, soil fertility, and the farmer's preference for traditional or high-density planting (HDP).
*   **Traditional Planting:**
    *   For vigorous varieties like Dashehari, Langra, Chausa: **10 m x 10 m** (meter to meter).
    *   For moderately vigorous varieties: **8 m x 8 m**.
*   **High-Density Planting (HDP):** This system is gaining popularity for higher initial yields and better management, especially with regular pruning and use of dwarfing rootstocks (if available).
    *   Common HDP spacing: **5 m x 5 m** or **6 m x 6 m**.
    *   HDP requires intensive management, including regular pruning, irrigation, and nutrient management.

**4. Seed Dose (Number of Saplings per Unit Area):**
*   The term "seed dose" is not applicable for commercial mango cultivation as it involves planting grafted saplings, not seeds. Instead, we calculate the **number of grafted saplings required per hectare or acre** based on the chosen spacing.
*   **Calculations (approximate):**
    *   For **10 m x 10 m** spacing: Approximately **100 saplings per hectare** (or about 40 saplings per acre).
    *   For **8 m x 8 m** spacing: Approximately **156 saplings per hectare** (or about 63 saplings per acre).
    *   For **6 m x 6 m** spacing (HDP): Approximately **277 saplings per hectare** (or about 112 saplings per acre).
    *   For **5 m x 5 m** spacing (HDP): Approximately **400 saplings per hectare** (or about 162 saplings per acre).

Farmers are advised to choose the spacing based on their specific variety, soil type, irrigation facilities, and management capabilities. For further specific guidance, please consult with the horticulture experts at HAU.
