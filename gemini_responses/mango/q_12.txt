Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling Scale insects and Mealybugs in Mango orchards in Haryana. These sap-sucking pests can cause significant damage by weakening the plant, leading to sooty mold development, and reducing fruit quality and yield. An Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is recommended for effective and sustainable control.

### Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Scale Insects and Mealybugs in Mango

**1. Cultural Control Measures:**

*   **Regular Monitoring:** Frequently inspect your mango trees, especially the undersides of leaves, young shoots, and fruit, for early signs of infestation. Early detection is key to effective control.
*   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy heavily infested branches, twigs, and leaves. This reduces the pest population and improves air circulation and spray penetration.
*   **Orchard Sanitation:** Keep the area around the trees clean and free of weeds, which can harbor pests.
*   **Ant Control:** Ants often protect mealybugs and scales from their natural enemies in exchange for honeydew. Control ant populations by applying sticky bands on tree trunks to prevent them from climbing.

**2. Biological Control:**

*   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Encourage and protect natural predators like ladybird beetles (e.g., *Cryptolaemus montrouzieri*), lacewings, and parasitic wasps. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that can harm these beneficial insects.
*   **Release of Biocontrol Agents:** In cases of severe infestation, consider the release of commercially available biocontrol agents like *Cryptolaemus montrouzieri* beetles, especially for mealybugs.

**3. Chemical Control (When necessary, using CIBRC approved technical chemicals):**

Chemical intervention should be considered when cultural and biological methods are insufficient, and pest populations reach damaging levels. Always ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and in tree crevices.

**For Mealybugs and Scale Insects:**

*   **Horticultural Mineral Oil (HMO) / White Oil:**
    *   **Application:** This is highly effective against all stages, especially crawlers and young scales/mealybugs, by suffocating them. It also helps in removing sooty mold.
    *   **Dosage:** Mix **Horticultural Mineral Oil** at 10-20 ml/L of water (1-2% solution).
    *   **Timing:** Apply during cooler parts of the day. Avoid application during peak flowering or very hot conditions. Repeat application after 10-15 days if necessary.

*   **Buprofezin (25% SC):**
    *   **Application:** An insect growth regulator that interferes with molting, primarily effective against nymphs.
    *   **Dosage:** Mix **Buprofezin** at 1.25 - 1.5 ml/L of water.

*   **Imidacloprid (17.8% SL):**
    *   **Application:** A systemic insecticide effective against sap-sucking pests.
    *   **Dosage:** Mix **Imidacloprid** at 0.5 - 0.75 ml/L of water.

*   **Thiamethoxam (25% WG):**
    *   **Application:** Another systemic neonicotinoid insecticide.
    *   **Dosage:** Mix **Thiamethoxam** at 0.2 - 0.3 g/L of water.

*   **Dimethoate (30% EC):**
    *   **Application:** An organophosphate insecticide with systemic and contact action.
    *   **Dosage:** Mix **Dimethoate** at 1.5 - 2 ml/L of water.

*   **Lambda-cyhalothrin (5% EC):**
    *   **Application:** A synthetic pyrethroid with contact and stomach action, provides quick knockdown. Use judiciously to preserve natural enemies.
    *   **Dosage:** Mix **Lambda-cyhalothrin** at 0.5 - 1 ml/L of water.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Rotation of Chemicals:** To prevent the development of pesticide resistance, rotate insecticides with different modes of action.
*   **Safety Precautions:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (gloves, mask, protective clothing) while handling and spraying chemicals. Follow the instructions on the product label carefully.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Strictly observe the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) mentioned on the pesticide label to ensure the safety of the fruit for consumption.
*   **Sooty Mold Management:** If sooty mold is severe, it can be gently scrubbed off with a soft brush or washed with a strong jet of water after the pest population is controlled. Horticultural mineral oil also helps in dislodging sooty mold.

By implementing these integrated strategies, you can effectively manage Scale insects and Mealybugs in your mango orchard. For specific local recommendations or severe infestations, please consult with your nearest HAU Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or agricultural extension officer.
