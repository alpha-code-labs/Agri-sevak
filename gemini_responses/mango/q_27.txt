As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the scientifically verified requirements for mango cultivation suitable for Haryana's conditions.

### Suitable Climate for Mango

Mango (Mangifera indica L.) is primarily a tropical and subtropical fruit, thriving best in regions with distinct dry and wet seasons.

*   **Temperature:**
    *   **Optimal Growth:** 24°C to 30°C.
    *   **Flowering and Fruit Set:** A dry period with temperatures around 20°C to 25°C is ideal for flowering. High humidity and cloudy weather during flowering can negatively impact fruit set and promote diseases.
    *   **Fruit Development:** Warm, dry weather is beneficial for fruit development and ripening, enhancing fruit quality and sweetness.
    *   **Frost Sensitivity:** Young mango plants are highly susceptible to frost. Mature trees can tolerate mild frost for short durations, but severe frost can cause significant damage to flowers, young fruits, and even mature branches. Haryana's winters can pose a challenge, requiring protection for young plants.
*   **Rainfall:**
    *   **Annual Requirement:** 750 mm to 2500 mm, well-distributed.
    *   **Flowering Period:** A dry spell of 2-3 months before flowering is crucial for inducing flowering. Rain during flowering can wash off pollen, reduce fruit set, and increase disease incidence.
    *   **Fruit Development:** Moderate rainfall during fruit development is beneficial, but excessive rain can lead to fruit drop and quality issues.
*   **Humidity:** Moderate humidity is generally preferred. High humidity during flowering and fruit development can increase the incidence of fungal diseases like powdery mildew and anthracnose.
*   **Sunlight:** Mango requires abundant sunlight for optimal growth, flowering, and fruit production.

### Suitable Soil Type for Mango

Mango trees are adaptable to a wide range of soils but perform best in specific types.

*   **Ideal Soil:** Deep (at least 2-3 meters), fertile, well-drained loamy or sandy-loam soils.
*   **Texture:** Medium-textured soils are preferred. They allow for good root penetration and aeration while retaining adequate moisture and nutrients.
*   **pH:** A soil pH range of 6.0 to 7.5 is considered optimal. Mango can tolerate slightly acidic to slightly alkaline conditions.
*   **Organic Matter:** Soils rich in organic matter are highly beneficial as they improve soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability.
*   **Avoid:** Heavy clay soils with poor drainage, very shallow soils, and highly saline or alkaline soils should be avoided as they restrict root growth and lead to poor tree health and productivity.

### Drainage Requirement for Mango

Excellent drainage is paramount for successful mango cultivation.

*   **Sensitivity to Waterlogging:** Mango trees are extremely sensitive to waterlogging. Standing water around the root zone, even for short periods, can lead to:
    *   Root rot (e.g., Phytophthora root rot).
    *   Reduced oxygen availability to roots, causing suffocation.
    *   Nutrient uptake impairment.
    *   Stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, and eventual tree death.
*   **Internal Drainage:** The soil must have good internal drainage, meaning water should percolate through the soil profile readily. This is why loamy or sandy-loam soils are preferred over heavy clay.
*   **Surface Drainage:** Proper surface drainage is also essential to prevent water accumulation around the tree base, especially during heavy monsoon rains. This can be achieved through:
    *   **Raised Beds/Mounds:** Planting mango trees on raised beds or mounds (0.5 to 1 meter high) is a common practice, particularly in areas prone to waterlogging or with heavy soils, to ensure the root collar remains above the water table.
    *   **Sloping Land:** Gentle slopes are naturally well-drained.
    *   **Drainage Channels:** Establishing proper drainage channels within the orchard can help remove excess surface water.

In summary, for successful mango cultivation in Haryana, selecting a site with a suitable climate (considering winter protection for young plants), deep, well-drained loamy soil with a neutral pH, and ensuring excellent drainage both internally and on the surface are critical factors.
