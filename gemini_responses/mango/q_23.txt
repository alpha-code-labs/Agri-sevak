As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for mango cultivation in Haryana:

### Seed Treatment Process for Mango

For commercial mango cultivation, propagation is primarily through vegetative methods such as grafting, budding, or inarching, using scions from desired varieties onto rootstock seedlings. Therefore, the concept of "seed treatment" as applied to field crops (e.g., fungicidal or insecticidal coating for direct planting) is generally **not applicable or recommended for establishing a mango orchard.**

Mango seeds (stones) are primarily used for raising rootstock seedlings. While specific chemical seed treatments are not common even for rootstock production, the focus is on selecting healthy, viable stones and maintaining strict nursery hygiene. This includes using sterilized potting media and ensuring good drainage to prevent damping-off diseases.

### Soil Treatment Process for Mango

Soil treatment is crucial for establishing a healthy mango orchard and managing soil-borne issues in existing ones.

#### 1. Pre-planting Soil Treatment (Pit Preparation for New Orchards)

Before planting mango saplings, proper pit preparation and soil treatment are essential:

*   **Pit Preparation:** Dig pits of 1 meter x 1 meter x 1 meter size. Allow them to weather for 15-20 days under direct sunlight.
*   **Pit Filling Mixture:** Fill the pits with a well-mixed combination of:
    *   Topsoil (from the pit)
    *   20-30 kg of well-decomposed Farmyard Manure (FYM) or compost.
    *   1-2 kg of Single Super Phosphate (SSP).
    *   **For Termite and Soil Pest Control:** Incorporate 100-200 g of **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC (mixed thoroughly with the soil mixture in the pit) or 200-300 g of **Fipronil** 0.3% GR per pit.
    *   **For Soil-borne Fungal Pathogen Management (if a history of disease in the area):** Mix 50-100 g of **Trichoderma viride** (bio-fungicide) with the FYM and incorporate it into the pit. This helps in suppressing harmful soil-borne fungi.

#### 2. Soil Treatment for Established Orchards (as needed)

For existing mango orchards, soil treatments may be required to manage specific pest and disease problems:

*   **Nematode Management:**
    *   If nematode infestation is confirmed and severe, apply **Carbofuran** 3% CG at 30-50 g per young tree or 100-200 g per mature tree. Broadcast the granules around the tree basin, incorporate them into the soil, and follow with irrigation.
    *   Alternatively, use biological nematicides such as **Paecilomyces lilacinus** or **Purpureocillium lilacinum** at 2-4 kg/acre, mixed with FYM and applied to the soil around the tree basin.
*   **Management of Soil-borne Fungal Diseases (e.g., Gummosis, Root Rot):**
    *   Drench the soil around the affected tree with a solution of **Metalaxyl 8% + Mancozeb 64% WP** at 2.5 g/L of water, ensuring the solution penetrates the root zone. Repeat if necessary based on disease severity.
    *   Alternatively, drench with **Propamocarb hydrochloride** 72.2% SL at 2-3 ml/L of water.
    *   Regular application of bio-fungicides like **Trichoderma viride** or **Pseudomonas fluorescens** (2-4 kg/acre mixed with FYM) can help in preventing and managing soil-borne diseases.
*   **Termite Control (if observed in established trees):**
    *   Drench the soil around the tree base with **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 2.5 ml/L of water. Ensure the drench reaches the root zone where termites might be active.

Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions when using any chemical pesticides. It is advisable to consult with local agricultural extension services or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions.
