As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU), I recommend the following doses for organic manures and biostimulants in Mango cultivation in Haryana:

*   **Farm Yard Manure (FYM):**
    *   For young, non-bearing trees (1-5 years): 10-25 kg per tree per year.
    *   For bearing trees (6 years and above): 50-75 kg per tree per year.
    *   *Application:* Apply in two split doses, once after fruit harvest (June-July) and another before flowering (September-October). Spread the FYM evenly around the tree basin, extending to the drip line, and lightly incorporate it into the soil.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   For young, non-bearing trees (1-5 years): 5-10 kg per tree per year.
    *   For bearing trees (6 years and above): 15-25 kg per tree per year.
    *   *Application:* Similar to FYM, apply in two split doses after harvest and before flowering, spread around the tree basin and lightly incorporated. Vermicompost is richer in nutrients than FYM, hence the lower dose.

*   **Sagarika (IFFCO):**
    *   **Foliar Spray (Sagarika Liquid):**
        *   **2-3 ml** per litre of water.
        *   *Application:* Spray at critical growth stages such as pre-flowering, fruit set, and fruit development. Typically 2-3 sprays per season are recommended.
    *   **Soil Application (Sagarika Granules):**
        *   **100-200 g** per tree.
        *   *Application:* Apply around the root zone and lightly incorporate into the soil, preferably during the monsoon season or with irrigation. This can be done once or twice a year.

These organic inputs improve soil health, nutrient availability, and overall tree vigour and productivity. Always ensure proper moisture levels in the soil after application of manures.
