As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide scientifically verified advice regarding dropping in Mango.

Firstly, it is important to clarify that the terms "Tinda dropping" and "Boll dropping" are not applicable to Mango. "Tinda" refers to the fruit of Indian round gourd, and "Boll" refers to the fruit capsule of cotton. Mango trees experience flower drop and fruit drop.

Here's how to control flower drop and fruit drop in Mango:

Flower and fruit drop in mango can be due to a combination of physiological, nutritional, pest, and disease factors. An integrated approach is crucial for effective management.

**I. Physiological and Nutritional Management:**

1.  **Balanced Nutrition:**
    *   Ensure adequate and balanced fertilization based on soil test reports. Deficiencies of micronutrients like Boron and Zinc are often linked to poor fruit set and increased drop.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** During flowering and fruit set, apply a foliar spray of:
        *   **Boron (as Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate):** 1-1.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Zinc (as Zinc Sulphate):** 2-3 g/L of water.
        *   These can be combined with other sprays if compatible.

2.  **Water Management:**
    *   Maintain optimal soil moisture, especially during flowering and fruit development. Both water stress (drought) and waterlogging can lead to significant drop.
    *   Provide light and frequent irrigation during critical stages, avoiding extremes.

3.  **Temperature Management:**
    *   Extreme temperatures (very high or very low) during flowering can negatively impact pollen viability and fruit set, leading to drop. While direct control is difficult, ensuring tree health helps resilience.

4.  **Pollination:**
    *   Encourage natural pollinators (bees) by avoiding insecticide sprays during peak flowering hours. Planting pollinator-friendly plants nearby can also help.

5.  **Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs):**
    *   To reduce premature fruit drop, especially during the marble to pea size stage, a foliar application of Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA) is highly effective.
    *   **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA):** Apply at 10-20 mg/L (10-20 ppm) of water, 2-3 weeks after fruit set. Repeat if necessary, but avoid excessive use.

**II. Pest Management:**

Pests that attack flowers and young fruits can cause significant drop.

1.  **Mango Hoppers (Amritodus atkinsoni, Idioscopus nitidulus, I. clypealis):**
    *   These suck sap from inflorescences and young fruits, causing them to dry and drop.
    *   **Control:** Spray at pre-flowering and post-flowering stages if infestation is observed.
        *   **Imidacloprid:** 0.3-0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Thiamethoxam:** 0.2-0.3 g/L of water.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin:** 0.5 ml/L of water (avoid during peak flowering to protect pollinators).

2.  **Thrips (Scirtothrips dorsalis):**
    *   Thrips feed on tender parts of flowers and young fruits, causing scarring and drop.
    *   **Control:**
        *   **Fipronil:** 1-1.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Spinosad:** 0.25-0.3 ml/L of water.

**III. Disease Management:**

Diseases affecting flowers and young fruits can also lead to their shedding.

1.  **Powdery Mildew (Oidium mangiferae):**
    *   Appears as white powdery growth on inflorescences, flowers, and young fruits, causing them to shrivel and drop.
    *   **Control:** Spray at flowering stage if symptoms appear.
        *   **Wettable Sulphur:** 2-3 g/L of water.
        *   **Hexaconazole:** 0.5-1 ml/L of water.
        *   **Myclobutanil:** 0.5 g/L of water.

2.  **Anthracnose (Colletotrichum gloeosporioides):**
    *   Causes black spots on flowers, flower stalks, and young fruits, leading to blight and drop.
    *   **Control:** Preventive sprays are crucial, especially during humid conditions.
        *   **Carbendazim:** 1 g/L of water.
        *   **Propiconazole:** 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Mancozeb:** 2-2.5 g/L of water (as a protective spray).

**Integrated Management Strategy:**

*   Monitor your mango trees regularly for signs of pests, diseases, or nutritional deficiencies.
*   Conduct soil testing every 2-3 years to guide fertilizer application.
*   Ensure proper tree health through balanced nutrition and irrigation.
*   Apply pesticides and fungicides only when necessary, following recommended dosages and safety precautions.
*   Always ensure good spray coverage for effective control.

By implementing these scientifically verified practices, you can significantly reduce flower and fruit drop in your mango orchard.
