As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling soil pests like termites and root-knot nematodes in mango orchards in Haryana.

Both termites and root-knot nematodes are significant soil-borne pests that can severely impact the health and productivity of mango trees, especially young plants. An integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods is recommended for effective and sustainable management.

### **1. Termite Control**

Termites (e.g., *Odontotermes obesus*, *Microtermes obesi*) attack the roots, collar region, and sometimes even the trunk of mango trees, leading to weakening, poor growth, and in severe cases, tree mortality.

**Symptoms and Damage:**
*   Presence of mud galleries on the trunk, branches, or around the base of the tree.
*   Hollowing out of the stem and roots.
*   Yellowing and wilting of leaves, stunted growth.
*   Sudden death of young trees.

**Cultural Practices:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Regularly remove dead wood, stumps, and other organic debris from the orchard, as these can serve as breeding grounds for termites.
*   **Avoid Direct Contact:** Do not allow organic matter (e.g., farmyard manure, compost) to come into direct contact with the tree trunk, as this can attract termites.
*   **Proper Irrigation:** Avoid waterlogging, as moist conditions can sometimes favor termite activity.
*   **Physical Barriers:** For young trees, consider using physical barriers or protective wraps around the base.

**Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved):**
For chemical control, soil drenching around the tree base is an effective method.
*   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC:** Mix **2.5-5 ml** per litre of water. Drench the soil around the base of the affected tree with **5-10 litres** of this solution, depending on the tree size and severity of infestation. Ensure the solution penetrates the root zone.
*   **Fipronil 5% SC:** Mix **1-2 ml** per litre of water. Drench the soil around the base of the affected tree with **5-10 litres** of this solution.

### **2. Nematode (Root-knot) Control**

Root-knot nematodes (*Meloidogyne spp.*) are microscopic roundworms that infect the roots of mango trees, causing characteristic swellings or galls. These galls impair the roots' ability to absorb water and nutrients, leading to various above-ground symptoms.

**Symptoms and Damage:**
*   Stunted growth, reduced vigour, and yellowing of leaves (chlorosis).
*   Reduced fruit size and yield.
*   Wilting of leaves during hot periods, even when soil moisture is adequate.
*   Presence of galls or knots on the roots, which can be observed by carefully examining the root system of an affected plant.
*   Increased susceptibility to other root diseases.

**Cultural Practices:**
*   **Healthy Planting Material:** Always use nematode-free saplings from a reputable nursery. Inspect roots for galls before planting.
*   **Soil Solarization:** In nursery beds or before planting new trees, soil solarization (covering moist soil with clear plastic sheets during hot months) can reduce nematode populations.
*   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure, compost, or neem cake into the soil. Neem cake, in particular, has nematicidal properties. Apply **1-2 kg** of neem cake per tree annually.
*   **Crop Rotation:** While difficult in perennial orchards, in intercropping systems, choose non-host crops.

**Biological Control:**
*   **Bio-nematicides:** Apply beneficial fungi like *Paecilomyces lilacinus* (now *Purpureocillium lilacinum*) or *Trichoderma harzianum* to the soil. These fungi parasitize nematode eggs and juveniles.
    *   Apply **2.5-5 kg** of formulation (containing 1x10^8 CFU/g) per acre, mixed with 100 kg of farmyard manure or compost, and apply around the root zone. Repeat application every 6-12 months.

**Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved):**
Chemical nematicides should be used judiciously and as a last resort, especially in established orchards.
*   **Carbosulfan 25% EC:** Mix **2-3 ml** per litre of water. Drench the soil around the root zone of the affected tree with **5-10 litres** of this solution.
*   **Carbosulfan 6% G:** Apply **100-200 g** per tree, spread evenly around the root zone and lightly incorporated into the soil, followed by irrigation.

**General Precautions:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, and protective clothing during chemical application.
*   Avoid spraying during windy conditions to prevent drift.
*   Do not apply chemicals near water bodies or during flowering to protect pollinators.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension officers for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions.

By adopting these integrated management strategies, you can effectively control soil pests in your mango orchard and ensure healthy, productive trees.
