As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Dieback, Twig Blight, and Tikka disease in Mango in Haryana.

### Control Measures for Mango Diseases

**1. Dieback**

Dieback in mango is primarily caused by the fungus *Lasiodiplodia theobromae* (syn. *Botryodiplodia theobromae*). It leads to the drying of twigs and branches, starting from the tip and progressing downwards.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Prune all affected twigs and branches, cutting 10-15 cm below the visibly diseased portion to ensure complete removal of the infected tissue.
    *   Collect and destroy all pruned material by burning to prevent further spread of the pathogen.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Immediately after pruning, apply a paste of **Copper Oxychloride 50% WP** (100 g in 1 litre of water) on the cut ends to protect them from re-infection.
    *   Follow up with a foliar spray of **Carbendazim 50% WP** at 1.0 g/L of water or **Thiophanate Methyl 70% WP** at 1.0 g/L of water.
    *   Repeat the foliar spray after 15-20 days if symptoms persist or environmental conditions are conducive for disease development.

**2. Twig Blight**

Twig blight often shares similar causal agents and symptoms with dieback, leading to the browning and drying of young twigs. It can also be caused by *Colletotrichum gloeosporioides* (anthracnose pathogen) or other fungi.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Similar to dieback, prune all infected twigs and branches, cutting well below the affected area.
    *   Ensure proper orchard sanitation by removing and destroying pruned material.
    *   Maintain good tree vigour through balanced nutrition and irrigation.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   After pruning, apply a paste of **Copper Oxychloride 50% WP** (100 g in 1 litre of water) on the cut surfaces.
    *   For foliar application, spray with **Mancozeb 75% WP** at 2.5 g/L of water or **Carbendazim 50% WP** at 1.0 g/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, **Propiconazole 25% EC** at 0.5 ml/L of water can be effective.
    *   Initiate sprays at the first sign of disease and repeat at 10-15 day intervals, especially during periods of high humidity or rainfall.

**3. Tikka Disease (Leaf Spots)**

While "Tikka disease" is more commonly associated with groundnut, in mango, this term is sometimes used locally to refer to various leaf spot diseases, such as those caused by *Alternaria alternata* or *Cercospora mangiferae*. These manifest as small, irregular, dark brown spots on the leaves, often with a yellowish halo.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Collect and destroy fallen infected leaves to reduce the inoculum source.
    *   Ensure good air circulation within the canopy through judicious pruning.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Apply a foliar spray of **Mancozeb 75% WP** at 2.5 g/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, **Carbendazim 50% WP** at 1.0 g/L of water or **Thiophanate Methyl 70% WP** at 1.0 g/L of water can be used.
    *   For systemic action, **Propiconazole 25% EC** at 0.5 ml/L of water or **Difenoconazole 25% EC** at 0.5 ml/L of water are also effective options.
    *   Begin spraying when the first symptoms appear, particularly during periods of high humidity, and repeat every 10-15 days as needed.

**General Recommendations:**

*   Always ensure thorough coverage of the plant canopy during spraying.
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
*   Consult your local agricultural extension officer for specific timing and recommendations tailored to your orchard's conditions and the prevailing weather.
*   Always read and follow the instructions and safety precautions on the chemical product label.
