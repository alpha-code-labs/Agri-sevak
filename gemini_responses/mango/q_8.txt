Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the challenges posed by sucking pests in mango orchards. Effective management is crucial for healthy yields. Here's a scientifically verified approach to control Aphids, Leafhoppers (Mango Hoppers), Whiteflies, Thrips, and Psylla in Mango, keeping in mind the conditions in Haryana.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Approach for Sucking Pests in Mango:**

A holistic approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods is most effective and sustainable.

1.  **Monitoring and Surveillance:**
    *   Regularly inspect your mango trees, especially during the critical periods of flowering and fruit set.
    *   Look for sticky honeydew (excretion of sucking pests), sooty mould development, curling or distorted leaves, and the presence of nymphs and adults on tender shoots, flowers, and the undersides of leaves.
    *   Early detection allows for timely intervention and prevents severe infestations.

2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Orchard Sanitation:** Remove weeds and debris from around the trees, as they can harbor pests.
    *   **Pruning:** Prune overcrowded branches to improve air circulation and light penetration, which can reduce pest incidence. Remove and destroy severely infested twigs.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush, tender growth that is highly attractive to sucking pests. Maintain a balanced nutrient regime.
    *   **Water Management:** Ensure proper irrigation to keep trees healthy and less susceptible to stress, but avoid overwatering.

3.  **Biological Control:**
    *   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Many natural enemies like ladybird beetles, lacewings, predatory mites, and parasitic wasps prey on or parasitize sucking pests. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.
    *   **Bird Perches:** Install bird perches in the orchard to encourage insectivorous birds.

4.  **Chemical Control (When Necessary):**
    When pest populations reach economic threshold levels, chemical intervention may be required. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Apply sprays during calm weather, preferably in the morning or late afternoon, and ensure thorough coverage of the foliage, especially the undersides of leaves.

    **Recommended CIBRC Approved Insecticides for Sucking Pests in Mango:**

    *   **For Mango Hoppers, Aphids, Thrips, and Psylla:**
        *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at 0.5 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at 0.2 g per litre of water.
        *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply at 0.2 g per litre of water.
        *   **Fipronil 5% SC:** Apply at 1.5 - 2.0 ml per litre of water.

    *   **For Whiteflies (and also effective against Hoppers):**
        *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at 1.25 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** Apply at 0.5 ml per litre of water (also effective against mites).

    *   **For Thrips and Hoppers:**
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** Apply at 0.5 ml per litre of water.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Timing of Application:** The first spray is often crucial and should be done before flowering (at the panicle emergence stage) to manage mango hoppers and other early-season sucking pests. Subsequent sprays can be done if infestation persists, but avoid spraying during peak flowering to protect pollinators.
*   **Rotation of Chemicals:** To prevent the development of pesticide resistance, it is vital to rotate insecticides with different modes of action. Do not use the same chemical repeatedly.
*   **Safety Precautions:** Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, and protective clothing during mixing and spraying.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Observe the specified Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) for each chemical to ensure the safety of the fruit for consumption.

By implementing these measures, you can effectively manage sucking pests in your mango orchard and ensure a healthy and productive crop. For any specific concerns or severe infestations, please consult with the entomology experts at HAU, Hisar.
