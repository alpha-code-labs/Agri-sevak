As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I advise on an integrated approach for managing rot diseases in mango, combining cultural practices, biological methods, and judicious use of CIBRC-approved chemical fungicides.

**General Cultural and Management Practices for Rot Control:**

1.  **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy all infected plant parts (leaves, twigs, fruits) to reduce inoculum.
2.  **Drainage:** Ensure excellent soil drainage around trees. Avoid waterlogging, especially near the trunk, as most rot pathogens thrive in wet conditions.
3.  **Pruning:** Prune trees regularly to improve air circulation within the canopy and remove dead or diseased branches. Always sterilize pruning tools.
4.  **Wound Protection:** Protect pruning cuts and any mechanical injuries with a fungicidal paste (e.g., **Copper Oxychloride** or **Carbendazim** mixed with linseed oil or paint).
5.  **Nutrition:** Maintain balanced tree nutrition to enhance natural resistance. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can promote lush, susceptible growth.
6.  **Irrigation:** Apply irrigation directly to the soil, avoiding wetting the trunk or foliage, especially in the evening.
7.  **Healthy Planting Material:** Use disease-free seeds, rootstocks, and grafts.

**Specific Rot Types and Their Control in Mango:**

Here's how to control various rot types affecting mango:

### 1. Root Rot

*   **Affects Mango:** Yes. Caused by various soil-borne fungi like *Phytophthora*, *Fusarium*, *Pythium*, and *Rhizoctonia*.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   Improve soil drainage and avoid water stagnation.
    *   Drench the soil around the base of the affected trees with one of the following:
        *   **Metalaxyl-M + Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Fosetyl-Al** at 2.5-3 g/L of water.
        *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride** at 2-3 ml/L of water.
    *   Apply biological control agents like *Trichoderma viride* (50 g/plant mixed with soil/compost) or *Pseudomonas fluorescens* (20 g/plant) to the root zone.

### 2. Stem Rot

*   **Affects Mango:** Yes. Often associated with dieback caused by *Botryodiplodia theobromae* or *Phytophthora* species.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   Prune affected branches well below the visible symptoms into healthy wood.
    *   Apply a fungicidal paste to the cut ends:
        *   **Carbendazim** (50 g/kg of paint or linseed oil).
        *   **Copper Oxychloride** (50 g/kg of paint or linseed oil).
    *   Spray the tree with:
        *   **Carbendazim** at 1 g/L of water.
        *   **Thiophanate Methyl** at 1 g/L of water.
        *   **Propiconazole** at 0.5 ml/L of water.

### 3. Foot Rot

*   **Affects Mango:** Yes. This refers to rot at the base of the trunk, often caused by *Phytophthora* species. It is closely related to Collar Rot.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   Remove soil from around the base of the trunk to expose the affected area to air.
    *   Scrape off infected bark carefully.
    *   Apply a fungicidal paste or drench the affected area with:
        *   **Metalaxyl-M + Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Fosetyl-Al** at 2.5-3 g/L of water.
        *   **Copper Oxychloride** at 3 g/L of water (as a drench or paste).

### 4. Collar Rot

*   **Affects Mango:** Yes. Affects the plant at the soil line, primarily caused by *Phytophthora* species.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   Similar to Foot Rot. Ensure good drainage and avoid soil accumulation around the collar.
    *   Expose the collar region to air.
    *   Scrape off infected bark.
    *   Apply a fungicidal paste or drench the affected area with:
        *   **Metalaxyl-M + Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Fosetyl-Al** at 2.5-3 g/L of water.
        *   **Copper Oxychloride** at 3 g/L of water (as a drench or paste).

### 5. Crown Rot

*   **Affects Mango:** Yes. Affects the crown region, often below or at the soil line, similar to collar and foot rot, primarily caused by *Phytophthora* species.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   Similar to Collar Rot and Foot Rot.
    *   Drench the soil around the crown with:
        *   **Metalaxyl-M + Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Fosetyl-Al** at 2.5-3 g/L of water.

### 6. Neck Rot

*   **Affects Mango:** This term is generally used to describe rot in the neck region of the plant (covered by Collar/Stem Rot) or the neck of the fruit (covered by Stem-End Rot, a type of Fruit Rot). It is not a distinct disease entity in mango.
*   **Control Measures:** Refer to control measures for **Stem Rot**, **Collar Rot**, or **Fruit Rot** (specifically Stem-End Rot).

### 7. Black Rot

*   **Affects Mango:** Yes, as a symptom. "Black Rot" is a descriptive term for various diseases causing black lesions or decay. In mango, this can include:
    *   **Black Spot/Rot on Fruit:** Caused by *Alternaria alternata*.
    *   **Stem-End Rot:** Caused by *Botryodiplodia theobromae*, which often appears black.
    *   Severe Anthracnose (*Colletotrichum gloeosporioides*) can also lead to black lesions.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   For fruit black spots/rot (e.g., *Alternaria*):
        *   **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Tebuconazole** at 0.75 ml/L of water.
    *   For stem-end rot (*Botryodiplodia*):
        *   **Carbendazim** at 1 g/L of water.
        *   **Thiophanate Methyl** at 1 g/L of water.
        *   **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   For general blackening due to Anthracnose, refer to Fruit Rot control.

### 8. Fruit Rot

*   **Affects Mango:** Yes, very common. Caused by various fungi like *Colletotrichum gloeosporioides* (Anthracnose), *Botryodiplodia theobromae* (Stem-End Rot), *Alternaria alternata*, *Aspergillus niger*, and *Phytophthora* species.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   Regular pre-harvest sprays, especially during flowering and fruit development:
        *   **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Carbendazim** at 1 g/L of water.
        *   **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Tebuconazole** at 0.75 ml/L of water.
        *   **Copper Oxychloride** at 3 g/L of water.
    *   Harvest fruits carefully to avoid injury.
    *   Post-harvest hot water treatment (52°C for 5-10 minutes) can reduce post-harvest rots.

### 9. Seed Rot

*   **Affects Mango:** Yes, particularly during germination, caused by various soil-borne fungi.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   Treat mango seeds before sowing:
        *   **Captan** at 2-3 g/kg of seed.
        *   **Thiram** at 2-3 g/kg of seed.
        *   Biological seed treatment with *Trichoderma viride* at 5-10 g/kg of seed.
    *   Use well-drained, sterilized potting mix.

### 10. Seedling Rot

*   **Affects Mango:** Yes, commonly known as damping-off, caused by *Pythium*, *Phytophthora*, and *Rhizoctonia*.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   Use sterilized soil/potting mix for raising seedlings.
    *   Ensure proper drainage in nursery beds/pots.
    *   Avoid overwatering.
    *   Drench the nursery beds/pots with:
        *   **Metalaxyl-M + Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride** at 2-3 ml/L of water.
        *   Biological drench with *Trichoderma viride* at 5 g/L of water.
