Reducing the harmful effects of weedicides/herbicides on mango trees is crucial for maintaining orchard health and productivity. Mango trees, especially young ones, can be highly susceptible to herbicide damage, either through direct contact, drift, or root uptake. The best approach involves a combination of preventive measures and careful application techniques.

Here's how to minimize herbicide damage in mango orchards:

1.  **Integrated Weed Management (IWM):**
    *   Prioritize non-chemical methods wherever feasible to reduce reliance on herbicides.
    *   **Manual Weeding:** Hand weeding or hoeing around the base of trees is highly effective and completely safe for the mango plant.
    *   **Mulching:** Applying organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves, wood chips) around the tree base suppresses weed growth, conserves moisture, and improves soil health. Ensure mulch does not touch the trunk directly to prevent collar rot.
    *   **Mechanical Cultivation:** Shallow inter-row cultivation can manage weeds between tree rows, but care must be taken to avoid damaging shallow mango roots.

2.  **Careful Herbicide Selection:**
    *   Choose herbicides that are known to be safer for use in orchards and are CIBRC approved for the specific region. Non-selective herbicides are commonly used for inter-row weed control but require extreme caution.
    *   **Glyphosate** (e.g., 41% SL, 71% SG): A non-selective systemic herbicide. It is effective against a broad spectrum of weeds but must be used as a *directed spray*, strictly avoiding contact with any green part (leaves, green bark, shoots) of the mango tree.
    *   **Paraquat dichloride** (e.g., 24% SL): A non-selective contact herbicide. It acts quickly but also requires *directed spray* application, avoiding contact with mango foliage or young bark.

3.  **Precise Application Techniques:**
    *   **Directed Spray:** This is the most critical technique. Herbicides must be applied only to the weeds, ensuring no spray drift or direct contact with the mango tree's trunk, branches, leaves, flowers, or fruits.
    *   **Use Shielded Sprayers:** Attach protective hoods or shields to the spray nozzle to physically block herbicide spray from reaching the mango tree.
    *   **Appropriate Nozzles:** Use flat fan or flood jet nozzles that produce coarse droplets, which are less prone to drift compared to fine mist.
    *   **Low Pressure:** Operate the sprayer at lower pressures to minimize the formation of fine, drift-prone droplets.
    *   **Avoid Windy Conditions:** Never apply herbicides on windy days. Even a slight breeze can carry herbicide droplets to the mango foliage, causing damage. Apply during calm mornings or evenings.
    *   **Correct Timing:** Apply herbicides when weeds are young and actively growing for maximum efficacy and to reduce the need for higher doses. Avoid application during mango flowering and fruit development stages if possible, or exercise extreme caution.
    *   **Bark Protection for Young Trees:** For young mango trees with thin, green bark, consider painting the lower trunk with a lime wash or wrapping it with a protective material (e.g., burlap, plastic sheet) before herbicide application to prevent direct contact.
    *   **Correct Dosage and Dilution:** Always follow the manufacturer's recommended dosage rates. Over-application can increase the risk of phytotoxicity and environmental contamination.
        *   For **Glyphosate 41% SL**: Use 10-15 ml per litre of water for general weed control as a directed spray.
        *   For **Paraquat dichloride 24% SL**: Use 5-7 ml per litre of water for general weed control as a directed spray.
    *   **Dedicated Equipment:** If possible, use a separate sprayer for herbicides to avoid contamination with other pesticides that might be used on mango. Thoroughly clean spray equipment after each use.

4.  **Post-Application Management (if damage occurs):**
    *   **Immediate Irrigation:** If accidental herbicide contact or drift occurs, immediately irrigate the affected area heavily to dilute and wash off the herbicide from the plant surface or flush it from the soil (if it's a soil-active herbicide).
    *   **Foliar Nutrient Application:** Apply foliar sprays of micronutrients or amino acids to help the tree recover from stress and promote new growth.
    *   **Pruning:** In cases of severe damage to specific branches or leaves, prune off the affected parts to encourage healthy regrowth.

By strictly adhering to these guidelines, the harmful effects of weedicides/herbicides on mango trees can be significantly reduced, ensuring the long-term health and productivity of your orchard.
