As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling these pests in Haryana:

### Ber Fly in Mango

This is not known to affect Mango. Ber fly (*Carpomyia vesuviana*) is a specific pest of Ber (*Ziziphus mauritiana*).

### Fruit Fly in Mango

Fruit flies (*Bactrocera dorsalis*, *Bactrocera zonata*) are a serious pest of mango in Haryana. Effective control requires an integrated approach:

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Orchard Sanitation:** Regularly collect and destroy all fallen and infested fruits by burying them deep in the soil or burning them. This breaks the life cycle of the pest.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** Ploughing the soil beneath the trees after harvest can expose and kill pupae in the soil.

**2. Mechanical Methods:**
*   **Fruit Bagging:** Bagging individual fruits with paper or cloth bags 30-45 days before harvest can protect them from fruit fly oviposition.

**3. Pheromone Traps:**
*   **Methyl Eugenol Traps:** Install methyl eugenol traps at a density of 10-15 traps per acre (25-37 traps per hectare) starting from fruit development stage (about 6-8 weeks before harvest). These traps attract and kill male fruit flies, reducing the population.
*   **Lure Replacement:** Replace the methyl eugenol lure every 2-3 weeks.

**4. Chemical Control (Bait Sprays):**
Bait sprays are highly effective and targeted, minimizing pesticide use. They should be applied on the tree trunk or a few leaves, not as a full cover spray.
*   **Timing:** Start bait sprays when fruits begin to change colour or show signs of ripening, and repeat at 7-10 day intervals until harvest.
*   **Preparation:** Mix the insecticide with a protein source (like jaggery/molasses or protein hydrolysate) to attract the flies.
*   **Recommended Chemicals:**
    *   Prepare a bait solution by mixing 20 ml of **Malathion** 50% EC with 100 g of jaggery/molasses or 20 g of protein hydrolysate in 10 litres of water. Apply 200-250 ml of this solution per tree on the trunk or a few leaves.
    *   Alternatively, prepare a bait solution by mixing 2-3 ml of **Spinosad** 45% SC with 20 g of protein hydrolysate in 10 litres of water. Apply 200-250 ml of this solution per tree on the trunk or a few leaves.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) for any chemical applied to ensure fruit safety.
