As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling physical damage in Mango for Haryana conditions:

### Control of Physical Damage in Mango

**1. Fruit Bursting (Fruit Cracking/Splitting)**

This condition is primarily caused by sudden fluctuations in soil moisture (e.g., a dry spell followed by heavy rain or irrigation), nutrient deficiencies (especially Boron and Calcium), and sometimes high humidity.

*   **Water Management:** Maintain consistent soil moisture throughout the fruit development period. Avoid extremes of drought followed by sudden heavy irrigation. Use mulching (e.g., straw, dry leaves, black plastic mulch) around the tree base to conserve soil moisture, regulate soil temperature, and reduce evaporation.
*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Boron Deficiency:** Apply foliar spray of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** at 1-1.5 g/L of water, or **Boric acid** at 1 g/L of water. Apply at the fruit set stage and repeat 3-4 weeks later.
    *   **Calcium Deficiency:** Apply foliar spray of **Calcium nitrate** at 5-10 g/L of water during the fruit development stage.

**2. Leaf Burning/Melting (Sun Scorch, Phytotoxicity, Salt Stress)**

Leaf burning (scorching) can result from high temperatures, intense sunlight, water stress, salt accumulation in the soil or irrigation water, or improper application of pesticides/fertilizers (phytotoxicity). "Melting" usually refers to severe tissue collapse due to extreme heat combined with high humidity or severe waterlogging.

*   **Water Management:** Ensure adequate and consistent irrigation, especially during hot and dry periods. Avoid both prolonged drought and waterlogging, as both can stress the plant and lead to leaf damage.
*   **Shade/Protection:** For young plants, provide temporary shade during the peak summer months to protect them from intense sunlight and high temperatures.
*   **Nutrient Management & Soil Health:**
    *   Avoid excessive application of fertilizers, especially those high in salts, as this can lead to salt stress and leaf burn.
    *   If soil salinity or sodicity is a concern (based on soil test reports), apply **Gypsum (Calcium sulfate dihydrate)** at 2-5 kg/acre, as per soil test recommendations, to improve soil structure and facilitate salt leaching.
*   **Pesticide/Fertilizer Application:** Always follow the label instructions precisely for dosage, timing, and application methods of all pesticides and foliar fertilizers. Avoid spraying during high temperatures, strong sunlight, or when the plant is under water stress, as this increases the risk of phytotoxicity.

**3. Hardness in Fruit (Lack of Proper Softening/Ripening)**

This condition typically refers to fruits that do not soften properly after harvest or remain unusually hard on the tree, often indicating issues with ripening or fruit development.

*   **Harvesting:** Harvest fruits at the correct physiological maturity stage. Harvesting too early can result in fruits that fail to ripen properly or remain hard. Indicators of maturity vary by variety but generally include changes in fruit shape (e.g., shoulder development), slight color break, and specific gravity.
*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Ensure adequate **Potassium** supply, which is crucial for fruit development, quality, and ripening. Based on soil test recommendations, apply **Muriate of Potash (Potassium chloride)** or **Sulfate of Potash (Potassium sulfate)** to the soil.
    *   Foliar spray of **Potassium nitrate** at 5-10 g/L of water during the fruit development and maturation stages can also be beneficial.
*   **Water Management:** Maintain consistent soil moisture during the fruit development and maturation phases. Water stress during these critical periods can negatively impact fruit quality and ripening.
*   **Post-harvest Handling:** Store harvested fruits under appropriate conditions (temperature and humidity) to facilitate natural ripening processes.
