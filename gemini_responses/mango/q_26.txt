As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified information on specialized practices for Mango cultivation in Haryana.

### Specialized Practices in Mango Cultivation

#### 1. Pruning

Pruning is essential for maintaining tree health, productivity, and managing tree size.

*   **Formative Pruning (Young Trees):**
    *   In the first 2-3 years, prune to establish a strong framework of 3-4 well-spaced main branches originating from the trunk at different heights and angles.
    *   Remove any shoots below the graft union or those growing inwards.
    *   Aim for an open, balanced canopy structure.
*   **Maintenance Pruning (Bearing Trees):**
    *   **Timing:** Best done immediately after harvest (typically May-June in Haryana) to allow new vegetative growth to mature before the next flowering season. Avoid pruning during flowering or fruiting.
    *   **Objective:** Remove dead, diseased, broken, criss-crossing, weak, or unproductive branches.
    *   Remove water sprouts (vigorous upright shoots) and suckers.
    *   Thin out dense areas to improve light penetration and air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce pest and disease incidence.
    *   Manage tree height and spread for easier harvesting and other cultural operations.
*   **Rejuvenation Pruning (Old, Unproductive Trees):**
    *   For very old and unproductive trees, heavy pruning can be done to stimulate new growth and restore vigor. This is a specialized practice and should be done under expert guidance.
*   **Technique:** Use sharp, sterilized pruning tools to make clean cuts. Apply a fungicidal paste (e.g., **Bordeaux paste** or a copper-based fungicide) to large cut surfaces to prevent infection.

#### 2. Desuckering

Desuckering involves removing unwanted shoots (suckers) that arise from the rootstock or the base of the main stem.

*   **Purpose:** Suckers compete with the main scion for nutrients and water, weakening the grafted plant and reducing its productivity. They are typically from the rootstock and will not bear the desired fruit.
*   **Timing:** Remove suckers as soon as they appear. Regular monitoring is crucial, especially in young grafted plants.
*   **Technique:** Snip or break off the suckers cleanly and close to their point of origin.

#### 3. Mulching

Mulching is the application of a layer of material to the soil surface around the tree.

*   **Purpose:**
    *   **Moisture Conservation:** Reduces evaporation from the soil surface, conserving soil moisture, especially during dry periods.
    *   **Weed Suppression:** Inhibits weed growth, reducing competition for nutrients and water.
    *   **Temperature Regulation:** Moderates soil temperature, keeping it cooler in summer and warmer in winter.
    *   **Soil Health Improvement:** Organic mulches decompose over time, adding organic matter and nutrients to the soil, improving soil structure and microbial activity.
    *   **Erosion Control:** Protects the soil from erosion caused by rain and wind.
*   **Materials:**
    *   **Organic Mulches:** Dry leaves, straw, paddy husk, sugarcane trash, wood chips, farmyard manure (FYM). Apply a layer of 10-15 cm thickness.
    *   **Plastic Mulches:** Black polyethylene film can be used, especially for young trees, to effectively suppress weeds and conserve moisture.
*   **Application:** Apply mulch around the tree base, extending to the drip line, but keep a small gap (5-10 cm) from the trunk to prevent collar rot and pest issues.
*   **Timing:** Best applied before the onset of dry spells or summer, and can be replenished after the monsoon.

#### 4. Grafting

Grafting is the primary method for commercial propagation of mango to ensure true-to-type plants and early bearing.

*   **Purpose:** To combine the desirable characteristics of a scion (fruiting variety) with a suitable rootstock (for vigor, disease resistance, or adaptability to soil conditions).
*   **Common Methods in Haryana:**
    *   **Veneer Grafting:** This is the most common and successful method. It involves joining a scion (a shoot from the desired variety) to a rootstock (a seedling of a local or vigorous variety, typically 6-12 months old).
    *   **Stone Grafting (Epicotyl Grafting):** Used for very young seedlings (at the 2-4 leaf stage, when the cotyledons are still attached).
    *   **In-situ Grafting:** Grafting directly in the field where the rootstock has been planted.
*   **Timing:** The monsoon season (July-September) is generally considered the best time for grafting in Haryana due to high humidity and favorable temperatures for callus formation and graft union success.
*   **Key Factors for Success:**
    *   Healthy, vigorous rootstock.
    *   Mature, pencil-thick scion wood (2-3 months old, defoliated 7-10 days prior to grafting).
    *   Sharp, sterilized grafting knife.
    *   Proper technique and firm tying with grafting tape.
    *   Post-grafting care, including protection from direct sun and maintaining humidity.

#### 5. Pollination

Mango is primarily an insect-pollinated crop, and effective pollination is crucial for good fruit set.

*   **Pollinators:** The main pollinators for mango are various insects, predominantly flies (e.g., houseflies, blowflies), but also bees (honeybees, stingless bees), thrips, and ants.
*   **Flower Structure:** Mango panicles bear both male and hermaphrodite (perfect) flowers. The percentage of hermaphrodite flowers varies significantly among varieties and is influenced by environmental factors.
*   **Self-Incompatibility:** While many mango varieties are self-fertile, some exhibit partial self-incompatibility, meaning cross-pollination can significantly improve fruit set.
*   **Factors Affecting Pollination:**
    *   **Weather Conditions:** Rain, strong winds, very high or very low temperatures during flowering can adversely affect pollinator activity and pollen viability.
    *   **Pesticide Use:** Indiscriminate use of insecticides during the flowering period can decimate pollinator populations.
    *   **Pollinator Availability:** Decline in natural pollinator populations due to habitat loss.
*   **Practices to Enhance Pollination:**
    *   **Avoid Pesticide Application During Flowering:** This is paramount to protect natural pollinators. If pest control is necessary, use pollinator-friendly options or apply them during non-flowering periods.
    *   **Maintain Biodiversity:** Encourage natural habitats for pollinators around the orchard.
    *   **Introduction of Beehives:** Placing 4-5 honeybee colonies per hectare during the flowering period can significantly enhance pollination, especially for varieties that benefit from cross-pollination.
