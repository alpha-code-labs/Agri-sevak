As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide scientifically verified advice for managing growth issues in Mango. It is crucial to first understand the underlying cause through observation and, ideally, soil and leaf tissue analysis.

Here's how to manage the specified growth issues:

### 1. Slow Growth

Slow growth in mango can be indicative of various underlying issues, primarily nutrient deficiencies, water stress, or poor soil health.

**Management Strategies:**

*   **Soil and Leaf Tissue Analysis:** This is the most critical first step to identify specific nutrient deficiencies or imbalances.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Based on soil test results, apply balanced fertilizers.
    *   **For general growth promotion:**
        *   Apply **Urea** (46% Nitrogen) at 200-300 g per tree for young trees, increasing to 500-1000 g per tree for mature trees, split into 2-3 applications during the active growth phase (post-harvest and pre-flowering flush).
        *   Apply **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% Nitrogen, 46% Phosphorus) at 150-250 g per tree for young trees, increasing to 400-800 g per tree for mature trees, primarily before flowering.
        *   Apply **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** (60% Potassium) at 150-250 g per tree for young trees, increasing to 400-800 g per tree for mature trees, split into 2 applications (pre-flowering and fruit development).
    *   **Micronutrient Correction:** If deficiencies are identified:
        *   For Zinc deficiency: Foliar spray of **Zinc sulfate** (21%) at 3-5 g/L of water.
        *   For Boron deficiency: Foliar spray of **Borax** (10.5% Boron) at 1-1.5 g/L of water.
        *   For Iron deficiency: Foliar spray of **Ferrous sulfate** (19%) at 3-5 g/L of water.
*   **Water Management:** Ensure adequate and timely irrigation, especially during dry periods and critical growth stages. Avoid both water stress and waterlogging.
*   **Organic Matter:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost (10-20 kg per young tree, 50-100 kg per mature tree annually) to improve soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability.
*   **Pruning:** Light pruning to remove dead, diseased, or weak branches can redirect energy to healthy growth.

### 2. Yellow Growth (Chlorosis)

Yellowing of leaves (chlorosis) indicates a lack of chlorophyll, often due to nutrient deficiencies, particularly nitrogen or micronutrients like iron, zinc, or manganese.

**Management Strategies:**

*   **Identify Specific Deficiency:** Observe the pattern of yellowing (e.g., older vs. younger leaves, interveinal vs. uniform yellowing) and confirm with soil and leaf tissue analysis.
*   **Nutrient Application (Foliar Sprays are often effective for quick correction):**
    *   **Nitrogen Deficiency (general yellowing, older leaves first):**
        *   Foliar spray of **Urea** (2% solution, i.e., 20 g/L of water) during active growth.
    *   **Iron Deficiency (interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, veins remain green):**
        *   Foliar spray of **Ferrous sulfate** (19%) at 3-5 g/L of water. Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals.
    *   **Zinc Deficiency (small, narrow, chlorotic leaves, often rosetting):**
        *   Foliar spray of **Zinc sulfate** (21%) at 3-5 g/L of water. Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals.
    *   **Manganese Deficiency (mottled chlorosis on younger leaves):**
        *   Foliar spray of **Manganese sulfate** (30.5%) at 3-5 g/L of water.
    *   **Magnesium Deficiency (interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, often purplish tints):**
        *   Foliar spray of **Magnesium sulfate** (Epsom salt) at 5 g/L of water.
*   **Soil pH Management:** In alkaline soils (common in Haryana), micronutrients like iron and zinc can become unavailable. While difficult to change pH significantly for mature trees, using chelated forms of micronutrients (e.g., Fe-EDTA, Zn-EDTA) can improve uptake. Incorporating organic matter also helps.
*   **Drainage:** Ensure good soil drainage to prevent waterlogging, which can damage roots and impair nutrient uptake.

### 3. Excessive Height

Excessive height can make harvesting difficult and reduce light penetration into the canopy, affecting productivity.

**Management Strategies:**

*   **Pruning:**
    *   **Formative Pruning:** In young trees, establish a strong, open framework with a manageable height.
    *   **Maintenance Pruning:** Annually after harvest, remove dead, diseased, crossing, or weak branches.
    *   **Topping/Heading Back:** To reduce overall height, cut back main branches to a desired height (typically 3-4 meters). This encourages lateral branching and a more spreading canopy. Ensure cuts are made above a strong outward-growing lateral branch.
*   **Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs):**
    *   **Paclobutrazol:** This is a highly effective PGR for controlling vegetative growth and promoting flowering.
        *   **Application:** Apply as a soil drench around the tree trunk. The dosage depends on tree age and canopy size. For mature trees (10-15 years old), typically 5-10 ml of **Paclobutrazol** (23% SC formulation) per meter of canopy diameter, mixed in 5-10 L of water. Apply 90-120 days before the expected flowering period (usually September-October in Haryana).
        *   **Caution:** Use with care, as overuse can lead to stunted growth and reduced fruit size. Follow manufacturer's recommendations and local agricultural university guidelines strictly.

### 4. Excessive Flowering

While flowering is desirable, excessively dense flowering can lead to poor fruit set, small fruit size, and contribute to alternate bearing.

**Management Strategies:**

*   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure balanced nutrition. Avoid excessive phosphorus and potassium if vegetative growth is being suppressed too much.
*   **Water Management:** Maintain consistent soil moisture, especially during the fruit set and development stages. Water stress during flowering can lead to flower drop.
*   **Pruning:**
    *   **Post-harvest Pruning:** After fruit harvest, prune to remove spent inflorescences and encourage a new flush of vegetative growth, which is essential for the next season's crop.
    *   **Flower Thinning (Manual):** In cases of extremely dense flowering, manual thinning of some flower panicles can be considered to improve fruit set and size of the remaining fruits, though this is labor-intensive.
*   **Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs):**
    *   **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA):** If excessive fruit set occurs after heavy flowering, leading to small fruits or alternate bearing, **Naphthalene Acetic Acid** (NAA) can be used as a fruit thinning agent.
        *   **Application:** Spray **Naphthalene Acetic Acid** (NAA) at 10-20 ppm (10-20 mg/L of water) when fruits are pea-sized (about 10-15 mm diameter). This helps to shed excess fruits, allowing the remaining fruits to grow larger and potentially reduce alternate bearing.
        *   **Caution:** Timing and concentration are critical. Incorrect application can lead to excessive fruit drop.
    *   **Paclobutrazol:** While it promotes flowering, its judicious use can help regulate the *timing* and *intensity* of flowering, especially in managing alternate bearing by inducing flowering in the 'off' year. However, if excessive flowering is already an issue, its use should be carefully evaluated or avoided in that specific season.

Always consult with local agricultural extension services or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and mango variety.
