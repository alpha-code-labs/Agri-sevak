As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified approaches to address macro-nutrient deficiencies (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium) in Mango in Haryana. It is crucial to conduct a soil test to accurately determine the extent of the deficiency before applying any fertilizers.

**General Recommendations:**
*   **Soil Testing:** Always begin with a comprehensive soil test to ascertain the precise nutrient status of your orchard soil. This will guide the exact dosage and type of fertilizer required.
*   **Timing:** Nutrient application timing is critical for mango. Generally, fertilizers are applied in split doses, often post-harvest (June-July) and pre-flowering (September-October), or during fruit development.
*   **Application Method:** For soil application, spread the fertilizer evenly in a ring around the tree canopy, 30-60 cm away from the trunk, and incorporate it into the soil, followed by irrigation.

**1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency:**
*   **Symptoms:** Pale green to yellow older leaves, stunted growth, reduced flowering and fruit set, small fruits.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   For bearing trees (5 years and older): Apply 500 g to 1.5 kg of **Urea** (46% N) per tree per year, split into 2-3 applications.
        *   Alternatively, **Calcium Ammonium Nitrate (CAN)** (25% N) can be used at 1 kg to 3 kg per tree per year, split into 2-3 applications.
    *   **Foliar Application (for quick relief):**
        *   Spray 0.5% to 1% solution of **Urea** (5-10 g/L of water) during vegetative flush, avoiding the flowering period. Repeat 2-3 times at 15-day intervals if needed.

**2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency:**
*   **Symptoms:** Dark green or purplish discoloration of older leaves, stunted growth, poor root development, reduced flowering and fruit quality.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   For bearing trees: Apply 250 g to 750 g of **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5) per tree per year.
        *   Alternatively, **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5) can be applied at 500 g to 1.5 kg per tree per year. Apply P fertilizers post-harvest or pre-flowering.
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray 0.5% solution of **Monoammonium Phosphate (MAP)** (12% N, 61% P2O5) (5 g/L of water) during early fruit development stages.

**3. Potassium (K) Deficiency:**
*   **Symptoms:** Scorching or browning of leaf margins (especially older leaves), reduced fruit size, poor fruit quality, increased susceptibility to diseases.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   For bearing trees: Apply 250 g to 1 kg of **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** (60% K2O) per tree per year.
        *   Alternatively, **Sulphate of Potash (SOP)** (50% K2O) can be used at 300 g to 1.2 kg per tree per year, especially in chloride-sensitive varieties or saline soils. Apply K fertilizers post-harvest or pre-flowering.
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray 1% solution of **Potassium Nitrate** (13% N, 45% K2O) (10 g/L of water) during fruit development stages.
        *   Alternatively, spray 0.5% to 1% solution of **Sulphate of Potash** (5-10 g/L of water).

**Integrated Nutrient Management:**
For sustainable mango production and improved soil health, it is highly recommended to integrate chemical fertilizers with organic manures. Apply 20-50 kg of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost per tree annually, along with the recommended chemical fertilizers. This enhances nutrient use efficiency and soil fertility.
