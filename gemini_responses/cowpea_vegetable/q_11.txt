As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies in Cowpea (Vegetable) in Haryana.

Effective management of these pests requires an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods.

### Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Beetles and Weevils in Cowpea (Vegetable)

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy crop residues, volunteer plants, and weeds that can harbor pests.
*   **Timely Sowing:** Adhere to recommended sowing dates to avoid peak pest populations.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate cowpea with non-host crops to break pest life cycles.
*   **Regular Monitoring:** Scout fields frequently to detect pest infestations early and assess their severity.
*   **Early Harvesting:** For weevils like the bean weevil, harvesting pods promptly as they mature can reduce field infestation before storage.

**2. Biological Control:**
*   Conserve natural enemies such as predatory beetles, spiders, and parasitic wasps, which can help keep pest populations in check. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides unless absolutely necessary.

**3. Chemical Control (when necessary, based on economic threshold levels):**

#### For Beetles (e.g., Flea Beetles, Leaf Beetles, Blister Beetles)
These beetles cause damage by feeding on leaves (defoliation, shot-holes), flowers, and developing pods, leading to yield loss.
*   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: Apply at 1.0 ml per litre of water (or 200 ml per acre).
*   **Cypermethrin** 25% EC: Apply at 0.5 ml per litre of water (or 100 ml per acre).
*   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC: Apply at 0.3 ml per litre of water (or 60 ml per acre).
*   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: Apply at 0.2 g per litre of water (or 40 g per acre), particularly effective against flea beetles.
*   **Malathion** 50% EC: Apply at 2.0 ml per litre of water (or 400 ml per acre).

#### For Weevils (specifically Bean Weevil, *Callosobruchus maculatus*)
The bean weevil, though primarily a storage pest, can initiate infestation in the field on mature cowpea pods.
*   **Field Management:** The insecticides listed for beetles can help manage early field infestations of bean weevils if detected on maturing pods.
*   **Post-Harvest Prevention:** To prevent storage infestation, harvest pods promptly, sun-dry them thoroughly to kill any eggs or larvae, and store seeds in airtight containers.

#### For Sawflies
This is not known to affect Cowpea (Vegetable).
