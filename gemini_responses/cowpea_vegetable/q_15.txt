As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Cowpea (Vegetable) in Haryana:

**1. Grasshopper**
Grasshoppers are polyphagous pests that can cause significant defoliation in cowpea.

*   **Cultural/Mechanical Control:**
    *   Hand-picking and destroying grasshopper nymphs and adults in small areas.
    *   Deep ploughing after harvest to expose and destroy eggs laid in the soil.
    *   Maintaining field sanitation to remove weeds that can serve as alternate hosts.

*   **Chemical Control (for severe infestations):**
    *   **Malathion** 50 EC: 1.0 - 1.25 litres per acre (or 2.0 - 2.5 ml per litre of water).
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5 EC: 200 ml per acre (or 0.4 ml per litre of water).

**2. Painted bug**
This is not known to affect Cowpea (Vegetable).

**3. Red cotton bug**

**4. Black ants**
