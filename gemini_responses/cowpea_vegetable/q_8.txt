Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding sucking pests in Cowpea (Vegetable). Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips are indeed significant pests that can cause considerable damage to your crop by sucking sap and transmitting viral diseases.

Regarding Psylla, this pest is not commonly known to affect Cowpea (Vegetable) in Haryana or other major cowpea growing regions. Therefore, specific control measures for Psylla on cowpea are generally not required.

For the effective management of Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips, an integrated approach combining cultural practices, regular monitoring, and judicious use of CIBRC-approved insecticides is recommended.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Practices:**

*   **Regular Monitoring:** Inspect your crop regularly, especially the undersides of leaves and tender shoots, to detect pest infestations early.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy weed hosts around the field that can harbor these pests.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation to break the pest cycle.
*   **Use of Yellow Sticky Traps:** Install yellow sticky traps (10-15 traps per acre) to monitor and trap adult whiteflies and thrips.
*   **Conservation of Natural Enemies:** Avoid indiscriminate use of broad-spectrum insecticides that can harm natural enemies like ladybird beetles, lacewings, and parasitic wasps, which prey on these sucking pests.

**Chemical Control Measures (Use only CIBRC approved technical chemical names):**

When pest populations reach economic threshold levels, the following CIBRC-approved insecticides can be used. Always ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves. Use a spray volume of 400-500 litres of water per acre, depending on the crop canopy.

1.  **For general sucking pests (Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, Thrips):**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at a rate of 0.5 ml per litre of water (250 ml per acre).
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at a rate of 0.2 g per litre of water (100 g per acre).
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply at a rate of 0.25 g per litre of water (125 g per acre).

2.  **Specifically effective against Thrips and Leafhoppers:**
    *   **Fipronil 5% SC:** Apply at a rate of 1.5 ml per litre of water (750 ml per acre).

3.  **Specifically effective against Aphids and Whiteflies (with a different mode of action for resistance management):**
    *   **Pymetrozine 50% WG:** Apply at a rate of 0.4 g per litre of water (200 g per acre).

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Rotate Insecticides:** To prevent the development of insecticide resistance, rotate insecticides with different modes of action. Do not use the same chemical repeatedly.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always observe the recommended pre-harvest interval (PHI) mentioned on the insecticide label before harvesting the vegetables for consumption.
*   **Safety Precautions:** Always wear protective clothing (gloves, mask, goggles) while mixing and spraying insecticides. Follow all instructions and safety guidelines provided on the product label.
*   **Consult Experts:** For specific advice tailored to your field conditions, it is always advisable to consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively manage sucking pests in your Cowpea (Vegetable) crop and ensure a healthy harvest.
