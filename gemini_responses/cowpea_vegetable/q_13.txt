As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fruit fly and ber fly in Cowpea (Vegetable) in Haryana:

**Ber fly (Carpomyia vesuviana):**
This is not known to affect Cowpea (Vegetable). Ber fly is a highly specific pest primarily infesting Ber (Ziziphus mauritiana) fruits.

**Fruit fly (Bactrocera spp.) in Cowpea (Vegetable):**
Fruit flies, particularly species like *Bactrocera cucurbitae* (melon fruit fly), can infest cowpea pods, leading to significant damage and yield loss. An integrated pest management (IPM) approach is crucial for effective control:

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Regularly collect and destroy all fallen, damaged, or infested pods and fruits. This helps to break the pest's life cycle by removing breeding sites.
    *   **Timely Harvesting:** Harvest pods as soon as they reach maturity to prevent flies from laying eggs in ripe pods.
    *   **Deep Ploughing:** After the harvest, deep ploughing can expose pupae in the soil to predators and adverse environmental conditions, reducing the next generation's population.

2.  **Mechanical and Physical Methods:**
    *   **Pheromone Traps:** Install specific fruit fly pheromone traps (e.g., those containing methyl eugenol or cue lure) at a density of 4-5 traps per acre. These traps help in monitoring the pest population and mass trapping male flies, thereby reducing mating success. Replace the lures every 2-3 weeks.
    *   **Poison Bait Traps/Sprays:** Prepare a bait by mixing an insecticide with a food attractant like jaggery or molasses. This bait can be applied as spots on leaves (not directly on pods) or placed in small plastic bottles with holes as bait stations.

3.  **Chemical Control (as a last resort and when infestation levels are high):**
    When chemical intervention is necessary, use CIBRC approved insecticides. Always adhere to the recommended dosage, application method, and pre-harvest interval (PHI) to ensure food safety and minimize environmental impact.

    *   **Foliar Sprays:**
        *   **Malathion 50% EC**: 1.0 - 1.5 L per acre (mixed with 500-750 L of water).
        *   **Spinosad 45% SC**: 60 - 75 ml per acre (mixed with 200-400 L of water).
        *   **Deltamethrin 2.8% EC**: 200 - 300 ml per acre (mixed with 200-400 L of water).
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC**: 100 - 120 ml per acre (mixed with 200-400 L of water).

    *   **Bait Spray (Spot Application):**
        *   A common bait spray formulation involves mixing **Malathion 50% EC** (e.g., 100 ml) with jaggery/molasses (e.g., 1 kg) in 10 L of water. This mixture is then applied as small spots on leaves (not directly on pods) or on non-bearing plants around the field.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the insecticide label carefully.
*   Ensure proper safety gear (gloves, mask, protective clothing) is used during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Spray during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and protect beneficial insects, including pollinators.
*   Strictly observe the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) mentioned on the product label to avoid chemical residues in the harvested pods.
