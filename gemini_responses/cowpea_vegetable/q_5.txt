As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned conditions in Cowpea (Vegetable) in Haryana:

**1. Scab (Cowpea Scab - *Sphaceloma murrayae* or *Elsinoë phaseoli*)**
Cowpea Scab is a known fungal disease that causes small, circular, reddish-brown spots on leaves, stems, and pods. These spots can become sunken and scab-like, leading to defoliation and reduced pod quality.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Use disease-free seeds or certified seeds.
    *   Practice crop rotation with non-leguminous crops for at least 2-3 years.
    *   Ensure proper plant spacing to improve air circulation within the canopy.
    *   Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest to reduce inoculum.
*   **Chemical Control (Preventive/Early Stage):**
    *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2.5 kg/acre, mixed in 500-750 L of water.
    *   **Chlorothalonil** (75% WP) at 1.5-2 kg/acre, mixed in 500-750 L of water.
    *   **Carbendazim** (12%) + **Mancozeb** (63% WP) at 500 g/acre, mixed in 500-750 L of water.
    *   Apply fungicides at the first sign of disease and repeat at 10-15 day intervals if necessary, strictly adhering to pre-harvest intervals mentioned on the product label.

**2. Canker (Canker-like symptoms, often associated with Anthracnose - *Colletotrichum lindemuthianum*)**
While a specific disease named "Canker" is not a primary standalone disease for cowpea, anthracnose is a common fungal disease that can cause sunken, dark lesions (cankers) on stems, petioles, and pods, leading to significant yield losses.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Use certified disease-free seeds or treat seeds with recommended fungicides.
    *   Practice crop rotation with non-host crops.
    *   Ensure good field sanitation by promptly removing and destroying infected plant residues.
    *   Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day, to minimize prolonged leaf wetness which favors disease development.
*   **Chemical Control (Preventive/Early Stage):**
    *   **Carbendazim** (50% WP) at 250-300 g/acre, mixed in 500-750 L of water.
    *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2.5 kg/acre, mixed in 500-750 L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC) at 200 ml/acre, mixed in 500-750 L of water.
    *   Apply fungicides preventively or at the first appearance of symptoms, repeating as per label recommendations and observing pre-harvest intervals.

**3. Gummosis**
This is not known to affect Cowpea (Vegetable). Gummosis is primarily a symptom observed in woody plants (trees and shrubs) where gum exudes from the bark, often due to stress, injury, or disease. It is not a characteristic pathological condition of herbaceous plants like cowpea.

**4. Lichen**
This is not known to affect Cowpea (Vegetable). Lichens are symbiotic organisms (a combination of a fungus and an alga or cyanobacterium) that grow on surfaces such as tree bark, rocks, or soil. They are non-parasitic and do not grow on or cause damage to herbaceous crop plants like cowpea. If observed on support structures or stakes in the field, they are harmless to the cowpea plant itself.
