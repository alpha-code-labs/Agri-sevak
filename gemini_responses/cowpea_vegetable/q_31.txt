As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for managing physical damage in Cowpea (Vegetable) in Haryana. These conditions are primarily physiological disorders rather than diseases or pests.

### 1. Fruit Bursting

Fruit bursting in cowpea is often a physiological disorder caused by sudden changes in moisture availability, rapid growth, or nutrient imbalances.

**Causes:**
*   **Irregular watering:** A dry spell followed by heavy irrigation or rainfall can cause a sudden influx of water into the fruit, leading to internal pressure and bursting.
*   **Rapid growth:** Very rapid fruit development can sometimes outpace the skin's ability to expand.
*   **Nutrient deficiencies:** Lack of Calcium and Boron can weaken cell walls and reduce fruit elasticity.

**Control Measures:**
*   **Consistent Irrigation:** Maintain uniform soil moisture throughout the growing season, especially during fruit development. Avoid extreme fluctuations between dry and wet conditions.
*   **Mulching:** Apply organic mulch around the base of plants to help conserve soil moisture, regulate soil temperature, and reduce moisture fluctuations.
*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Calcium:** Ensure adequate calcium availability. Calcium strengthens cell walls.
        *   Foliar spray of **Calcium nitrate** at 0.5-1.0% concentration during fruit development.
        *   Soil application of calcium-containing fertilizers based on soil test recommendations.
    *   **Boron:** Boron is crucial for cell wall integrity and calcium uptake.
        *   Foliar spray of **Borax** (10.5% Boron) or **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (20% Boron) at 0.1-0.2% concentration during flowering and early fruit set.
        *   Soil application of boron based on soil test recommendations, as boron deficiency is common in some Haryana soils.

### 2. Leaf Burning/Melting

Leaf burning or melting is typically a symptom of severe environmental stress or chemical phytotoxicity.

**Causes:**
*   **Heat Stress:** High temperatures, especially when combined with low humidity and strong sunlight, can cause scorching and burning of leaf tissues.
*   **Water Stress:** Both drought (insufficient water) and waterlogging (excess water leading to root damage) can impair water uptake, leading to wilting and burning of leaves.
*   **Nutrient Toxicity/Deficiency:** Imbalances in nutrients, particularly excess salts or deficiencies of certain micronutrients, can manifest as leaf burn.
*   **Chemical Phytotoxicity:** Improper application of pesticides, herbicides (drift), or fertilizers (foliar burn from high concentrations) can cause chemical burning of leaves.

**Control Measures:**
*   **Optimal Irrigation:** Provide adequate and timely irrigation to prevent both drought and waterlogging. Ensure good drainage in the field.
*   **Shade Management:** During periods of extreme heat (e.g., May-June in Haryana), consider using temporary shade nets (25-30% shade) for high-value crops to reduce direct sun exposure and leaf temperature.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Conduct soil testing to identify any nutrient deficiencies or toxicities. Apply fertilizers based on recommendations to maintain optimal nutrient balance.
*   **Careful Chemical Application:**
    *   Always follow recommended dosages and application methods for all agrochemicals.
    *   Avoid spraying during the hottest part of the day or when plants are under stress.
    *   Use appropriate nozzles and spray pressure to minimize drift.
    *   Ensure proper mixing and dilution of chemicals.

### 3. Hardness in Fruit

Hardness in cowpea pods (fruits) makes them unpalatable and reduces market quality.

**Causes:**
*   **Over-maturity:** The most common cause. As pods mature, the seeds develop, and the pod walls become fibrous and tough.
*   **Water Stress:** Insufficient water during pod development can lead to premature hardening and reduced succulence.
*   **High Temperatures:** Extreme heat during pod development can accelerate maturity and fiber development.
*   **Nutrient Imbalances:** While less direct, imbalances can affect overall plant health and pod quality.

**Control Measures:**
*   **Timely Harvesting:** Harvest cowpea pods at the tender, immature stage before the seeds fully develop and the pods become fibrous. Regular harvesting (every 2-3 days) is crucial.
*   **Consistent Irrigation:** Maintain adequate soil moisture throughout the flowering and pod development stages to ensure succulent and tender pods.
*   **Temperature Management:** Where feasible, mitigate heat stress through proper irrigation and mulching.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure the crop receives balanced nutrition, particularly adequate potassium, which plays a role in fruit quality and succulence.
    *   Foliar spray of **Potassium nitrate** at 0.5-1.0% concentration during flowering and pod development can improve pod quality.
