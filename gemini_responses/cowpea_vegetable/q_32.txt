"Drying up" in Cowpea (Vegetable), manifesting as drying branches, leaves, fruits, and flowers, is a serious symptom that indicates a significant problem affecting the plant's health, often related to its vascular system or root integrity. As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I advise a thorough field inspection to identify the specific underlying cause before implementing management strategies.

Here are the common causes for "drying up" in Cowpea (Vegetable) and their scientifically verified management strategies:

**1. Fungal Wilts and Root Rots**
These are major causes of drying up, especially in Haryana's climate, as they directly impair water and nutrient uptake.

*   **Fusarium Wilt (Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. vignae)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Initial yellowing of lower leaves, followed by wilting and drying of the entire plant. When the stem is cut open, a characteristic browning or discoloration of the vascular tissue can be observed.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Use resistant varieties if available.
        *   Practice crop rotation with non-host crops (e.g., cereals) for at least 2-3 years.
        *   Maintain good field sanitation and remove infected plant debris.
        *   **Chemical Control:**
            *   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds with **Carbendazim** (1-2 g/kg seed) or **Thiram** (2-3 g/kg seed) to protect seedlings from early infection.
            *   **Soil Drenching:** For standing crops showing initial symptoms, drench the soil around affected plants with a solution of **Carbendazim** (1 g/L water) or **Propiconazole** (1 ml/L water). Apply approximately 200-250 ml solution per plant.

*   **Charcoal Rot / Dry Root Rot (Macrophomina phaseolina)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Wilting and drying of plants, often in patches, particularly prevalent during hot and dry periods. The stem base and roots show blackening and shredding, and tiny black sclerotia (resting bodies of the fungus) may be visible.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Avoid water stress, especially during critical growth stages like flowering and pod development.
        *   Practice deep ploughing during summer to expose sclerotia to solar radiation.
        *   Crop rotation with non-host crops.
        *   **Chemical Control:**
            *   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds with **Carbendazim** (1-2 g/kg seed) or **Thiram** (2-3 g/kg seed).
            *   **Soil Drenching:** Drench the soil around the root zone of affected plants with **Carbendazim** (1 g/L water) or **Hexaconazole** (1 ml/L water).

**2. Root-Knot Nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.)**
*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, yellowing, wilting, and premature drying of plants, especially under moisture stress. The most diagnostic symptom is the presence of characteristic galls or knots on the roots, which impair water and nutrient uptake.
*   **Management:**
    *   Use resistant or tolerant varieties if available.
    *   Practice crop rotation with non-host crops (e.g., marigold, mustard, cereals).
    *   Summer ploughing helps expose nematodes to heat and desiccation.
    *   Incorporate organic matter (e.g., well-decomposed farmyard manure or neem cake @ 100 kg/acre) into the soil to improve soil health and promote beneficial microorganisms.
    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Carbofuran** 3G granules (10 kg/acre) at the time of sowing or transplanting, mixed well into the soil. (Note: Carbofuran is a restricted pesticide; use strictly as per label instructions and local regulations).
        *   **Soil Drenching/Application:** Newer nematicides like **Fluopyram** can be effective. Apply **Fluopyram** (0.625 ml/L water as drench or 250 ml/acre as soil application) as per product recommendations.

**3. Abiotic Stresses**
Environmental factors can also lead to drying up symptoms.

*   **Water Stress (Drought)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Leaves droop, turn yellow, and eventually dry up. Flowers and young pods may abort prematurely.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Provide timely and adequate irrigation, especially during critical growth stages such as flowering and pod development.
        *   Use mulching (e.g., straw, dry leaves) to conserve soil moisture and reduce evaporation.

*   **Waterlogging**
    *   **Symptoms:** Yellowing, wilting, and drying of plants due to root damage caused by lack of oxygen. Roots may appear dark and rotten.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Ensure proper drainage in the field to prevent water accumulation.
        *   Avoid planting in low-lying areas prone to waterlogging.
        *   Improve soil structure through the addition of organic matter to enhance aeration.

**General Recommendations:**
*   Always use certified, healthy seeds from a reliable source.
*   Practice good field sanitation by removing weeds and crop residues.
*   Regularly monitor your crop for early detection of any problems.
*   For precise diagnosis and tailored recommendations, it is always advisable to consult with local agricultural extension specialists or HAU experts, who can assess your specific field conditions.
