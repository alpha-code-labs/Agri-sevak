Dear Farmer,

Controlling soil pests like termites and root-knot nematodes is crucial for healthy cowpea (vegetable) cultivation and achieving good yields. As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend an integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods for effective and sustainable management.

**General Management Principles:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove crop residues, weeds, and stubble that can harbor pests.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** Exposes soil pests to predators and sunlight, reducing their populations.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate cowpea with non-host crops (e.g., cereals like wheat, maize, or pearl millet) to break the pest life cycle.

**Specific Control Measures:**

**1. Termites (Odontotermes spp., Microtermes spp.)**
Termites attack the roots and stem base of cowpea plants, leading to wilting, stunted growth, and ultimately plant death.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Ensure thorough removal of all woody debris, stubble, and old roots from the field before sowing.
    *   Avoid leaving heaps of organic matter or wood near the field, as these can attract termites.
    *   Maintain proper soil moisture through irrigation, as termites generally prefer dry conditions.

*   **Chemical Control (Pre-sowing/At Sowing):**
    *   **Soil Treatment:**
        *   Apply **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** at 2.0-2.5 litres per acre. Mix the required quantity with 200-400 litres of water and drench into the soil, or mix with sand/soil and broadcast evenly before sowing.
        *   Alternatively, apply **Fipronil 0.3% GR** at 6-8 kg per acre. Broadcast evenly and incorporate into the soil before sowing or at the time of sowing.

**2. Nematodes (Root-knot nematodes - Meloidogyne spp.)**
Root-knot nematodes are microscopic worms that infect cowpea roots, causing characteristic galls or knots. This damage impairs the plant's ability to absorb water and nutrients, leading to stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, reduced flowering, and significant yield loss.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate cowpea with non-host crops such as sorghum, maize, wheat, or marigold for at least 2-3 years to reduce nematode populations.
    *   **Solarization:** During hot summer months (May-June), moisten the field and cover it tightly with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks. The high temperatures generated under the sheets can effectively kill nematodes.
    *   **Use of Resistant Varieties:** If available and suitable for your region, choose nematode-resistant cowpea varieties.

*   **Biological Control:**
    *   **Neem Cake Application:** Incorporate **Neem cake** at 100-200 kg per acre into the soil 2-3 weeks before sowing. Neem cake releases compounds that have nematicidal properties and also improves soil health.
    *   **Bio-nematicides:** Apply formulations of *Purpureocillium lilacinum* (formerly *Paecilomyces lilacinus*) or *Trichoderma harzianum* as per the manufacturer's instructions. Typically, these are applied at 2.5-5 kg per acre, mixed with well-decomposed farmyard manure and incorporated into the soil before sowing.

*   **Chemical Control (At Sowing):**
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   Apply **Carbofuran 3% G** at 10-13 kg per acre in the soil at the time of sowing. This can be applied in furrows or broadcast evenly and incorporated into the soil.
        *   Alternatively, apply **Phorate 10% G** at 4 kg per acre in the soil at the time of sowing, preferably in furrows or broadcast and incorporated.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and strictly follow the instructions, precautions, and dosage recommendations provided on the pesticide label.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, and protective clothing while handling and applying any chemicals.
*   Ensure even application of granular pesticides and thorough mixing/drenching for liquid formulations to achieve effective control.
*   For specific advice tailored to your field conditions, please consult your local agricultural extension officer or the experts at HAU, Hisar.
