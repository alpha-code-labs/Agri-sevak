As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend an integrated approach for weed management in Cowpea (Vegetable) to ensure effective control while minimizing impact on crop health and yield.

**Integrated Weed Management Strategy:**

1.  **Cultural and Mechanical Methods:**
    *   **Field Preparation:** Ensure thorough land preparation to reduce initial weed load.
    *   **Clean Seeds:** Use certified, weed-free cowpea seeds.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate cowpea with non-leguminous crops to break weed cycles.
    *   **Hand Weeding:** Perform 1-2 hand weedings, typically at 20-25 and 40-45 days after sowing (DAS), depending on weed intensity. This is highly effective for vegetable cowpea.
    *   **Inter-cultivation:** Shallow inter-cultivation using hoes can be done between rows during early growth stages to manage weeds and improve soil aeration.

2.  **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Pre-emergence Herbicides (for Broadleaf and Narrow leaf weeds):**
        These herbicides are applied within 0-3 days after sowing (DAS) on moist soil or immediately after irrigation.
        *   **Pendimethalin** (30% EC): Apply at 1.0-1.5 kg a.i./acre (equivalent to 3.3-5.0 L of product per acre) in 200-300 L of water.
        *   **Fluchloralin** (45% EC): Apply as a pre-plant incorporation (PPI) at 0.675-0.9 kg a.i./acre (equivalent to 1.5-2.0 L of product per acre) in 200-300 L of water. Incorporate into the soil before sowing.

    *   **Post-emergence Herbicides (for Narrow leaf weeds / Grasses like Phalaris minor):**
        These are selective graminicides and are safe for broadleaf crops like cowpea. Apply when grasses are at the 2-4 leaf stage.
        *   **Quizalofop-ethyl** (5% EC): Apply at 50-75 g a.i./acre (equivalent to 1.0-1.5 L of product per acre) in 200-300 L of water.
        *   **Fluazifop-P-butyl** (13.4% EC): Apply at 100-150 ml of product per acre in 200-300 L of water.
        *   **Sethoxydim** (10% EC): Apply at 1.0-1.5 L of product per acre in 200-300 L of water.

    *   **Post-emergence Herbicides (for Broadleaf weeds like Bathu, Congress grass):**
        Apply when broadleaf weeds are at the 2-4 leaf stage.
        *   **Bentazon** (48% SL): Apply at 0.75-1.0 kg a.i./acre (equivalent to 1.5-2.0 L of product per acre) in 200-300 L of water. Apply carefully, ensuring proper coverage of weeds.

**Specific Weed Management:**

*   **Amarbail (Cuscuta spp.):**
    *   Control of Amarbail is challenging once it has established on the crop.
    *   Pre-emergence application of **Pendimethalin** can offer some suppression of Amarbail germination.
    *   The most effective method is manual removal of infested cowpea plants along with the Amarbail strands before it produces seeds.
    *   Avoid planting cowpea in fields with a history of severe Amarbail infestation.

*   **Bathu (Chenopodium album) and Congress grass (Parthenium hysterophorus):**
    *   These are common broadleaf weeds. They can be effectively controlled by the pre-emergence herbicides **Pendimethalin** or **Fluchloralin**.
    *   For post-emergence control, **Bentazon** is recommended.
    *   Manual weeding is also highly effective, especially for Congress grass, which should be removed before flowering to prevent seed dispersal.

*   **Orobanche (Broomrape):**
    *   This is not known to affect Cowpea (Vegetable).

*   **Phalaris minor (Canary grass):**
    *   This is a narrow leaf (grass) weed.
    *   It can be controlled by pre-emergence application of **Pendimethalin** or **Fluchloralin**.
    *   For post-emergence control, selective graminicides like **Quizalofop-ethyl**, **Fluazifop-P-butyl**, or **Sethoxydim** are highly effective.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the herbicide label carefully.
*   Ensure proper calibration of spray equipment for uniform application.
*   Apply herbicides when weather conditions are favorable (no strong winds, rain not expected immediately after application).
*   For vegetable cowpea, prioritize manual weeding and pre-emergence herbicides to minimize any potential phytotoxicity or residue concerns during the frequent harvesting period.
