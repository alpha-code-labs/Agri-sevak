As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Cowpea (Vegetable) in Haryana.

It is crucial to adopt an Integrated Disease Management (IDM) approach, combining cultural practices with judicious chemical applications.

**General Cultural Practices for Fungal Disease Management:**

*   **Resistant Varieties:** Whenever available and suitable for your region, choose cowpea varieties known for resistance or tolerance to common fungal diseases.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice a 2-3 year crop rotation with non-leguminous crops to break the disease cycle and reduce inoculum in the soil.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest. Keep the field free of weeds, which can act as alternate hosts for pathogens.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Maintain adequate plant spacing to ensure good air circulation within the canopy, reducing humidity and fungal growth.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced fertilizers. Excessive nitrogen can make plants more susceptible to some fungal diseases.
*   **Irrigation Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation late in the day, which can leave foliage wet for extended periods, favoring fungal development. Drip irrigation is preferable.
*   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds with recommended fungicides to protect against seed-borne and early-season soil-borne pathogens.

**Specific Disease Management Strategies:**

1.  **Alternaria Leaf Spot (Caused by *Alternaria tenuissima* or *A. alternata*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Small, circular to irregular spots with concentric rings, often surrounded by a yellow halo, primarily on older leaves.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   **Cultural:** Follow general cultural practices.
        *   **Chemical:**
            *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2.0-2.5 g/L of water.
            *   **Chlorothalonil** (75% WP) at 2.0 g/L of water.
            *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC) at 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water.
            *   **Propiconazole** (25% EC) at 0.5 ml/L of water.

2.  **Anthracnose (Caused by *Colletotrichum lindemuthianum*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Dark, sunken lesions with reddish-brown margins on leaves, stems, pods, and petioles. Can cause defoliation and pod rot.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   **Cultural:** Use disease-free seeds. Practice crop rotation. Remove infected plant debris.
        *   **Chemical:**
            *   **Carbendazim** (50% WP) at 1.0 g/L of water (for seed treatment: 2 g/kg seed).
            *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2.0-2.5 g/L of water.
            *   **Thiophanate-methyl** (70% WP) at 1.0 g/L of water.
            *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC) at 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water.

3.  **Blast**
    *   This is not known to affect Cowpea (Vegetable). Blast is primarily a disease of cereals like rice and wheat.

4.  **Blight (e.g., *Cercospora Leaf Blight* caused by *Cercospora canescens*, *Rhizoctonia Web Blight* caused by *Rhizoctonia solani*)**
    *   **Symptoms:**
        *   *Cercospora Leaf Blight:* Angular to irregular spots, often greyish-brown, sometimes with a purplish border. Severe infection leads to blighting and defoliation.
        *   *Rhizoctonia Web Blight:* Water-soaked lesions on leaves and stems, which rapidly expand and coalesce, forming a web-like mycelial growth under humid conditions.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   **Cultural:** Ensure good drainage. Avoid dense planting.
        *   **Chemical:**
            *   For *Cercospora Leaf Blight*:
                *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2.0-2.5 g/L of water.
                *   **Chlorothalonil** (75% WP) at 2.0 g/L of water.
                *   **Carbendazim** (50% WP) at 1.0 g/L of water.
            *   For *Rhizoctonia Web Blight* (often soil-borne, difficult to control once severe):
                *   **Pencycuron** (25% WP) at 1.0 g/L of water (as a foliar spray or drench).
                *   **Validamycin** (3% L) at 2.0 ml/L of water.

5.  **Brown Spot**
    *   While 'Brown spot' is a distinct disease in some crops (e.g., rice), in cowpea, brown spots are typically symptoms of other fungal diseases like *Alternaria leaf spot* or *Cercospora leaf spot* (which falls under 'Blight' in this context). Control measures for these specific diseases, as mentioned above, will manage brown spot symptoms.

6.  **Downy Mildew (Caused by *Peronospora viciae* or similar oomycetes)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Yellowish-green spots on the upper leaf surface, with a greyish-purple, fuzzy growth on the corresponding lower leaf surface. Can cause stunting and defoliation.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   **Cultural:** Use resistant varieties. Ensure good air circulation.
        *   **Chemical:**
            *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2.0-2.5 g/L of water.
            *   **Propineb** (70% WP) at 2.0-2.5 g/L of water.
            *   **Metalaxyl + Mancozeb** (e.g., 8% + 64% WP) at 2.0-2.5 g/L of water.
            *   **Cymoxanil + Mancozeb** (e.g., 8% + 64% WP) at 2.0-2.5 g/L of water.
            *   **Fenamidone + Propamocarb hydrochloride** (e.g., 10% + 37.5% SC) at 2.0 ml/L of water.

7.  **Powdery Mildew (Caused by *Erysiphe polygoni* or *Oidium* species)**
    *   **Symptoms:** White, powdery patches on the upper and lower surfaces of leaves, stems, and pods. Severe infection leads to yellowing, distortion, and premature defoliation.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   **Cultural:** Remove infected plant parts.
        *   **Chemical:**
            *   **Sulfur** (80% WP) at 2.0-3.0 g/L of water (avoid spraying in very hot weather).
            *   **Myclobutanil** (10% WP) at 0.5 g/L of water.
            *   **Penconazole** (10% EC) at 0.5 ml/L of water.
            *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC) at 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water.
            *   **Tebuconazole** (25% EC) at 0.75 ml/L of water.

8.  **Grey Mildew**
    *   This is not known to affect Cowpea (Vegetable) as a distinct disease entity. Symptoms that might be described as 'grey mildew' are often associated with severe powdery mildew, downy mildew, or certain *Cercospora* leaf spots. Control measures for these specific diseases, as mentioned above, will address such symptoms.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the fungicide label regarding dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in pathogens.
*   For effective control, initiate spraying at the first appearance of symptoms or when environmental conditions favor disease development.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and current disease prevalence.
