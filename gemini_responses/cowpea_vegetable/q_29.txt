Flower and pod (fruit) dropping in Cowpea (Vegetable) is a common physiological phenomenon often triggered by environmental stresses, nutritional deficiencies, or hormonal imbalances. The term "tinda" refers to round gourd, and "boll" is typically used for cotton; for cowpea, we address flower and pod dropping.

To control dropping in Cowpea (Vegetable), a multi-faceted approach involving proper agronomic practices, nutritional management, and judicious use of plant growth regulators is recommended:

**1. Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs):**
These can help in reducing flower and pod drop by influencing hormonal balance.

*   **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA):**
    *   Apply a foliar spray of **Naphthalene Acetic Acid** at a concentration of 10-20 ppm (10-20 mg per litre of water).
    *   The first spray should be given at the pre-flowering stage (when flower buds are just appearing), and a second spray can be given 10-15 days later at the early pod development stage.
    *   This helps in better flower retention and reduces abscission.

**2. Nutritional Management:**
Deficiencies of certain micronutrients can significantly contribute to flower and pod drop.

*   **Boron:**
    *   Boron is crucial for pollen germination, pollen tube growth, and fruit set.
    *   Apply a foliar spray of **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate) at 0.2% concentration (2 g per litre of water) at the pre-flowering stage.
*   **Zinc:**
    *   Zinc plays a vital role in plant metabolism and hormone synthesis.
    *   Apply a foliar spray of **Zinc Sulphate** at 0.5% concentration (5 g per litre of water) if zinc deficiency symptoms are observed or as a prophylactic measure during vegetative growth.
*   **Balanced Fertilization:** Ensure the crop receives adequate and balanced macro and micronutrients as per soil test recommendations. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can promote vegetative growth at the expense of reproductive growth.

**3. Agronomic Practices:**

*   **Water Management:**
    *   Maintain optimal soil moisture, especially during flowering and pod development stages. Both drought stress and waterlogging can lead to severe dropping.
    *   Provide light and frequent irrigations during critical growth stages, particularly in hot and dry weather conditions prevalent in Haryana.
*   **Temperature Management:**
    *   High temperatures (above 35°C) during flowering can lead to pollen sterility and increased flower drop. Choose varieties suitable for the prevailing temperature conditions and adjust sowing time to avoid peak heat stress during flowering.
*   **Pest and Disease Control:**
    *   Severe infestations of sucking pests (aphids, jassids, thrips) or pod borers can weaken the plant and indirectly cause flower/pod drop. Implement timely and effective pest and disease management strategies to maintain plant vigour.
*   **Weed Control:**
    *   Keep the field free from weeds, as they compete for water, nutrients, and light, adding stress to the crop.
*   **Variety Selection:**
    *   Choose cowpea varieties that are known to be less prone to flower and pod dropping and are well-adapted to the agro-climatic conditions of Haryana.
