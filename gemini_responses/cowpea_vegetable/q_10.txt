As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for managing pests in Cowpea (Vegetable) in Haryana.

It is crucial to adopt an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods for sustainable pest control. Always ensure proper spray coverage and follow safety guidelines.

### Control of Borers and Caterpillars in Cowpea (Vegetable)

Cowpea is primarily affected by pod borers (e.g., *Maruca vitrata*, *Helicoverpa armigera*) and various defoliating caterpillars (*Spodoptera* spp., semiloopers).

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   Regular field monitoring to detect early infestations.
*   Collection and destruction of infested pods and larvae.
*   Deep ploughing after harvest to expose pupae.
*   Use of pheromone traps for monitoring adult moth populations (e.g., *Helicoverpa armigera*).

**2. Biological Control:**
*   Conservation of natural enemies like parasitoids (e.g., *Trichogramma* spp.) and predators (e.g., lacewings, ladybird beetles).
*   Application of bio-pesticides:
    *   **Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) var. kurstaki** (as per product label, typically 1-2 kg/acre or 1-2 L/acre for liquid formulations) during early larval stages.

**3. Chemical Control (when pest population exceeds economic threshold):**
*   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG:** 100-120 g/acre
*   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** 60 ml/acre
*   **Flubendiamide 20% WG:** 50 g/acre
*   **Indoxacarb 14.5% SC:** 200 ml/acre
*   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** 200-250 ml/acre (Use judiciously to avoid resistance development and harm to beneficial insects).
*   **Spinetoram 11.7% SC:** 150-180 ml/acre

### Control of Diamondback Moth in Cowpea (Vegetable)

This is not known to affect Cowpea (Vegetable). Diamondback moth (*Plutella xylostella*) is a specific pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower, mustard) and does not infest cowpea.

### Control of Leaf Folder in Cowpea (Vegetable)

Leaf folders (e.g., *Lamprosema indicata* or similar species) can occasionally infest cowpea, where larvae fold leaves and feed from within.

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   Regular scouting for folded leaves and manual removal of infested leaves during early stages.
*   Proper field sanitation.

**2. Biological Control:**
*   Conservation of natural enemies.
*   Application of bio-pesticides:
    *   **Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) var. kurstaki** (as per product label, typically 1-2 kg/acre or 1-2 L/acre for liquid formulations) during early larval stages.

**3. Chemical Control (when pest population exceeds economic threshold):**
*   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** 60 ml/acre
*   **Flubendiamide 20% WG:** 50 g/acre
*   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG:** 100-120 g/acre
*   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** 200-250 ml/acre

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label, including dosage, timing, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
*   Ensure adequate water volume for spraying to achieve good coverage.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension specialists for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions.
