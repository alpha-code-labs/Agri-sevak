As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following fertilizer doses for Cowpea (Vegetable) in Haryana. It is always advisable to conduct a soil test to determine the precise nutrient requirements for your specific field conditions.

**General Recommendation for Cowpea (Vegetable) in Haryana:**
*   **Nitrogen (N):** 15-20 kg per acre
*   **Phosphorus (P2O5):** 40-60 kg per acre
*   **Potassium (K2O):** 20-30 kg per acre
*   **Sulphur (S):** 20 kg per acre

**Recommended Fertilizer Doses:**

**1. Basal Application (at the time of sowing):**

*   **Nitrogen (N):**
    *   Cowpea is a legume and fixes atmospheric nitrogen. A small starter dose of nitrogen is beneficial for initial plant establishment before nodulation is fully active.
    *   Apply 15-20 kg N per acre. This can be achieved by applying:
        *   **Urea:** 30-45 kg per acre (if using only Urea for N)
        *   *Alternatively, if using DAP, the N component from DAP will contribute to this requirement.*

*   **Phosphorus (P2O5):**
    *   Apply 40-60 kg P2O5 per acre. This can be achieved by applying:
        *   **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP):** 85-130 kg per acre. (This will also provide 15-23 kg N, fulfilling most of the basal N requirement).
        *   *OR*
        *   **Single Super Phosphate (SSP):** 250-375 kg per acre. (This will also provide Sulphur).

*   **Potassium (K2O):**
    *   Apply 20-30 kg K2O per acre. This can be achieved by applying:
        *   **Muriate of Potash (MOP):** 35-50 kg per acre.

*   **Sulphur (S):**
    *   Apply 20 kg S per acre. Sulphur is crucial for nodulation and protein synthesis in legumes.
    *   If **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** is used for Phosphorus, it will adequately meet the Sulphur requirement (SSP contains approximately 11% Sulphur).
    *   If **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** is used for Phosphorus, supplement with:
        *   **Elemental Sulphur (90%):** 20-22 kg per acre.
        *   *OR*
        *   **Gypsum:** 120-150 kg per acre.

*   **NPK Complex Fertilizers:**
    *   If using NPK complex fertilizers (e.g., 12:32:16, 10:26:26), the quantity should be calculated to meet the recommended P2O5 and K2O requirements, and then supplemented with N and S if necessary. For legumes, it is often more precise to use single nutrient sources.

**2. Foliar Application (as supplementary/booster, if required):**

*   **Nano-Urea:**
    *   For boosting vegetative growth or addressing nitrogen deficiency symptoms during the crop cycle.
    *   Apply 2-4 ml per litre of water as a foliar spray. One to two sprays can be given during the vegetative growth phase or pre-flowering, depending on plant vigour and need.

*   **Nano-DAP:**
    *   For enhancing flowering, pod setting, and overall plant vigour, especially during reproductive stages.
    *   Apply 2-4 ml per litre of water as a foliar spray. One to two sprays can be given during flowering and pod development stages, depending on plant health and yield potential.
