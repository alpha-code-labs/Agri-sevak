As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I must provide scientifically verified advice based on the specific terminology used.

1.  **Dieback:** This is not known to affect Cowpea (Vegetable) as a primary disease. While general plant stress or other diseases can lead to symptoms of drying back of plant parts, "Dieback" is not a recognized specific disease of cowpea.

2.  **Twig blight:** This is not known to affect Cowpea (Vegetable). Cowpea is an herbaceous plant and does not possess woody twigs. While various blights (e.g., web blight, bacterial blight) can affect cowpea foliage and stems, the term "twig blight" is not applicable.

3.  **Tikka disease:** This is not known to affect Cowpea (Vegetable). "Tikka disease" is the specific common name for leaf spot diseases caused by *Cercospora arachidicola* and *Phaeoisariopsis personata* primarily in groundnut (peanut). While cowpea is affected by *Cercospora* leaf spot (caused by species like *Cercospora cruenta* or *Cercospora canescens*), it is not referred to as "Tikka disease."
