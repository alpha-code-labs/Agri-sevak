Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

Scale insects and Mealybugs are significant sucking pests that can severely affect Cowpea (Vegetable) cultivation in Haryana, leading to reduced yield and quality. As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach for their effective control.

### Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Scale Insects and Mealybugs in Cowpea (Vegetable)

**1. Monitoring and Early Detection:**
*   Regularly inspect your cowpea plants, especially the undersides of leaves, stems, leaf axils, and developing pods, for the presence of these pests. Early detection is crucial for effective management.
*   Look for white, cottony masses (mealybugs) or small, immobile, waxy bumps (scales). Also, observe for honeydew secretion and subsequent sooty mold development.

**2. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy heavily infested plant parts (leaves, stems, branches) to reduce pest populations.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Keep the field free of weeds, which can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, as it can lead to lush growth that is more attractive to sucking pests.
*   **Water Spray:** For small infestations, a strong jet of water can dislodge some pests, especially mealybugs.

**3. Biological Control:**
*   Encourage natural enemies such as ladybird beetles (coccinellids), lacewings, and parasitic wasps, which prey on or parasitize scale insects and mealybugs. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

**4. Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved Technical Chemicals):**
When cultural and biological methods are insufficient, judicious use of CIBRC approved insecticides is recommended. Always ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and in crevices where pests hide.

*   **For Scale Insects and Mealybugs:**
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** An insect growth regulator, highly effective against nymphs.
        *   Dosage: **1.25 - 1.5 ml per litre of water** (or 500 - 600 ml per acre).
    *   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:** A highly systemic insecticide with translaminar movement, effective against both pests.
        *   Dosage: **0.5 - 0.6 ml per litre of water** (or 200 - 240 ml per acre).
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** A systemic neonicotinoid, effective against sucking pests.
        *   Dosage: **0.25 - 0.3 ml per litre of water** (or 100 - 120 ml per acre).
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Another systemic neonicotinoid, effective against a wide range of sucking pests.
        *   Dosage: **0.25 - 0.3 g per litre of water** (or 100 - 120 g per acre).
    *   **Dimethoate 30% EC:** An organophosphate with contact and systemic action.
        *   Dosage: **0.75 - 1.0 ml per litre of water** (or 300 - 400 ml per acre).
    *   **Azadirachtin (e.g., 1500 ppm formulation):** A botanical insecticide, effective as an antifeedant and growth disruptor, particularly useful for early infestations or as part of a rotational spray.
        *   Dosage: **2 - 3 ml per litre of water** (or 800 - 1200 ml per acre).

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Rotation of Chemicals:** To prevent the development of pesticide resistance, rotate insecticides with different modes of action.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always strictly observe the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) mentioned on the product label to ensure the safety of the harvested produce.
*   **Application Technique:** Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially targeting the hidden areas where these pests reside. Use a high-volume sprayer for better penetration.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, mask, and protective clothing while mixing and spraying chemicals. Follow all safety instructions on the product label.

By adopting these scientifically verified practices, you can effectively manage scale insects and mealybugs in your cowpea crop and ensure a healthy harvest. For any further specific queries, please consult your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts.
