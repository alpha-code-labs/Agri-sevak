As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the ideal transplantation time, distance, and process for Cowpea (Vegetable) in Haryana:

While cowpea is often direct-sown, transplantation can be employed for early crop establishment, better stand uniformity, or to manage specific field conditions.

### Ideal Transplantation Time

Cowpea is a warm-season crop. For vegetable production in Haryana, the ideal transplantation times are:

*   **Spring/Summer Crop:**
    *   Nursery raising: Late January to early February.
    *   Transplanting: **Mid-February to early March**. This allows for an early harvest before the peak summer heat becomes too intense for pod setting.
*   **Kharif Crop:**
    *   Nursery raising: Late May to early June.
    *   Transplanting: **Mid-June to early July**, coinciding with the onset of the monsoon.

Seedlings should be approximately 3-4 weeks old, possessing 2-3 true leaves, and be sturdy enough to withstand transplanting shock.

### Ideal Transplantation Distance

The spacing depends on the growth habit of the cowpea variety (bushy vs. vining/semi-vining).

*   **Row-to-Row Distance:** 45-60 cm
*   **Plant-to-Plant Distance:**
    *   For bushy or erect varieties: 15-20 cm
    *   For vining or semi-vining varieties (especially if staking is planned): 30-45 cm

### Transplantation Process

1.  **Nursery Preparation:**
    *   **Media:** Use well-drained, fertile potting mix in seedling trays or raised nursery beds. A mixture of soil, sand, and well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost in a 2:1:1 ratio is ideal.
    *   **Sowing:** Sow cowpea seeds 1-2 cm deep.
    *   **Watering:** Keep the nursery media consistently moist but not waterlogged.
    *   **Hardening:** A week before transplanting, gradually reduce watering to harden the seedlings, making them more resilient to field conditions.

2.  **Main Field Preparation:**
    *   **Ploughing:** Plough the field thoroughly to a fine tilth, followed by harrowing.
    *   **Organic Matter:** Incorporate 10-15 tonnes/acre of well-decomposed FYM or compost during the last ploughing.
    *   **Bed/Ridge Formation:** Prepare flat beds or ridges and furrows according to your irrigation method and soil type. Ridges are often preferred for better drainage and aeration, especially during the monsoon.

3.  **Transplanting Operation:**
    *   **Timing:** Transplant in the late afternoon or evening, or on a cloudy day, to minimize transplant shock from direct sun and heat.
    *   **Watering Nursery:** Thoroughly water the nursery beds or trays a few hours before transplanting to ensure the root ball remains intact and seedlings can be pulled out easily with minimal root damage.
    *   **Handling Seedlings:** Carefully lift seedlings, ensuring as much of the root system and surrounding soil as possible remains attached.
    *   **Planting:** Make holes at the recommended spacing in the prepared field. Place one seedling per hole, ensuring the root collar is at the soil surface level. Gently firm the soil around the base of each seedling to ensure good root-to-soil contact.
    *   **Immediate Irrigation:** Provide light irrigation immediately after transplanting to settle the soil around the roots and reduce transplant shock.

4.  **Post-Transplantation Care:**
    *   **Watering:** Maintain adequate soil moisture, especially during the initial establishment phase. Avoid waterlogging.
    *   **Weeding:** Keep the field free of weeds, which compete for nutrients and moisture.
    *   **Pest and Disease Monitoring:** Regularly inspect plants for any signs of pests or diseases and take appropriate control measures as per HAU recommendations.
