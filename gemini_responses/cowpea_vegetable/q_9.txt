Mites, including Red Spider Mite (*Tetranychus urticae*) and Rust Mite (*Aculops spp.* or *Phyllocoptruta spp.*), are significant pests of Cowpea (Vegetable) in Haryana. They can cause considerable damage, leading to reduced photosynthetic activity, stunted growth, and decreased yield.

**Symptoms:**
*   **Red Spider Mite:** Yellowish-white speckles (stippling) on leaves, followed by bronzing, drying, and premature leaf drop. Fine webbing may be visible on the undersides of leaves in severe infestations.
*   **Rust Mite:** Leaves may appear bronzed, russeted, or leathery. Leaf margins can curl downwards, and growth may be stunted. These mites are microscopic and require a hand lens to observe.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies:**

1.  **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect the undersides of leaves for mite presence, eggs, or early symptoms. Early detection is crucial for effective management.
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Weed Management:** Remove weeds from and around the cowpea field, as many weeds serve as alternate hosts for mites.
    *   **Proper Irrigation:** Mites thrive in hot, dry conditions. Adequate irrigation can help reduce mite populations. Overhead irrigation can physically dislodge mites.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can promote lush growth that is more attractive to mites.
3.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Conserve natural enemies such as predatory mites (*Amblyseius* spp.), ladybird beetles, and lacewings, which prey on mites. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

**Chemical Control (when necessary):**

When mite populations reach damaging levels, chemical intervention may be required. Always ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where mites reside. Rotate miticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Adhere strictly to the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) for each chemical.

Here are some CIBRC approved technical chemical names for mite control in Cowpea (Vegetable):

*   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC**
    *   Dosage: 0.5 ml/L of water (or 200 ml/acre in 400 L of water).
*   **Fenpyroximate 5% SC**
    *   Dosage: 0.5 ml/L of water (or 200-300 ml/acre).
*   **Propargite 57% EC**
    *   Dosage: 1.0 - 1.5 ml/L of water (or 500-750 ml/acre).
*   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP**
    *   Dosage: 2.0 - 3.0 g/L of water (or 800-1200 g/acre).
    *   *Note: Effective against both types of mites, particularly good for rust mites. Avoid spraying when temperatures are very high (above 30-35°C) as it can cause phytotoxicity.*
*   **Abamectin 1.9% EC**
    *   Dosage: 0.3 - 0.5 ml/L of water (or 150-250 ml/acre).
*   **Etoxazole 10% SC**
    *   Dosage: 0.5 ml/L of water (or 200 ml/acre).
*   **Pyridaben 10% WP**
    *   Dosage: 1.0 g/L of water (or 400 g/acre).

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always use personal protective equipment (PPE) while handling and spraying chemicals.
*   Ensure proper calibration of spray equipment for accurate dosage and coverage.
*   Consult the label of the specific product for detailed instructions, precautions, and the latest recommendations.
