As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding various rot types in Cowpea (Vegetable). It's important to note that "rot" is a general symptom caused by several different fungal and oomycete pathogens, often exacerbated by environmental conditions. Effective control requires an integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods.

Here's a comprehensive strategy to manage rot diseases in Cowpea (Vegetable):

**I. Cultural and Preventive Practices (Foundation of Disease Management):**

These practices are crucial for reducing inoculum levels and creating an unfavorable environment for pathogens.

*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available, select cowpea varieties known to have resistance or tolerance to common root and stem rot pathogens prevalent in Haryana. Consult with HAU for specific recommendations.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice a strict crop rotation with non-host crops (e.g., cereals like wheat, maize) for at least 2-3 years. This helps to break the disease cycle and reduce soil-borne inoculum.
*   **Field Sanitation:**
    *   Remove and destroy infected plant debris immediately after harvest.
    *   Keep the field free of weeds, as they can harbor pathogens.
*   **Soil Health and Drainage:**
    *   Ensure good soil drainage to prevent waterlogging, which favors many rot-causing pathogens (especially *Pythium* and *Phytophthora*).
    *   Improve soil structure by incorporating organic matter.
*   **Optimum Sowing Time and Spacing:**
    *   Sow seeds at the recommended time to avoid periods of high disease pressure.
    *   Maintain proper plant spacing to ensure good air circulation, reducing humidity around the plant base.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:**
    *   Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush, succulent growth more susceptible to disease.
    *   Ensure adequate levels of phosphorus and potassium for plant vigor.
*   **Solarization:** In areas with severe soil-borne disease problems, solarization during the hot summer months can significantly reduce pathogen populations in the soil.
*   **Certified Disease-Free Seeds:** Always use certified, healthy, and disease-free seeds from a reputable source.

**II. Biological Control:**

Biological agents can provide a sustainable and eco-friendly approach to managing soil-borne pathogens.

*   **Seed Treatment:**
    *   **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum**: Treat seeds at 5-10 g/kg of seed.
    *   **Pseudomonas fluorescens**: Treat seeds at 10 g/kg of seed.
*   **Soil Application:**
    *   **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum**: Mix 2.5 kg of the bio-agent with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost. Keep the mixture moist for 7-10 days in a shaded area, then broadcast uniformly in the field before sowing or at the time of planting.

**III. Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved Technical Chemicals):**

Chemical control should be used judiciously and as part of an integrated management strategy. Always follow label instructions for dosage and safety.

**A. Seed Treatment (Crucial for Seed Rot, Seedling Rot, and Early Damping-off):**

Treating seeds before sowing protects them from soil-borne pathogens and gives seedlings a healthy start.

*   **Carbendazim** (1-2 g/kg seed)
*   **Thiram** (2-3 g/kg seed)
*   **Captan** (2-3 g/kg seed)
*   **Metalaxyl-M** (often used in combination products, e.g., 1-2 g/kg seed if standalone or as per product recommendation)
*   **Fludioxonil** + **Metalaxyl-M** (combination product, as per product recommendation)

**B. Soil Drench / Soil Application (For Root Rot, Stem Rot, Foot Rot, Collar Rot, Crown Rot, Neck Rot, Black Rot):**

These applications target pathogens in the soil around the plant base.

*   **Carbendazim**: Drench the soil around the base of affected plants with a solution of 1-2 g/L of water.
*   **Propiconazole**: Drench the soil around the base of affected plants with a solution of 0.5-1 ml/L of water.
*   **Hexaconazole**: Drench the soil around the base of affected plants with a solution of 0.5-1 ml/L of water.
*   **Validamycin**: For *Rhizoctonia* and *Sclerotium* induced rots, drench the soil with a solution of 2-3 ml/L of water.
*   **Metalaxyl-M**: For oomycete-induced rots (*Pythium*, *Phytophthora*), drench the soil with a solution of 1-2 g/L of water (often available in combination products).

**C. Foliar Spray (For Fruit Rot, and if Stem Rot progresses upwards):**

While most rots are soil-borne, fruit rot and advanced stem rot may require foliar application.

*   **Carbendazim**: Spray at 1-1.5 g/L of water.
*   **Mancozeb**: Spray at 2-2.5 g/L of water.
*   **Chlorothalonil**: Spray at 2 g/L of water.
*   **Azoxystrobin**: Spray at 0.5-1 ml/L of water.
*   **Pyraclostrobin** + **Metiram** (combination product, as per product recommendation).

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Diagnosis:** Accurate diagnosis of the specific pathogen causing the rot is crucial for selecting the most effective control measure. If unsure, consult with HAU experts.
*   **Timing:** Apply treatments preventively or at the very first sign of disease for best results.
*   **Rotation of Chemicals:** To prevent the development of fungicide resistance, rotate fungicides with different modes of action.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) when handling and applying chemicals.

By implementing these integrated strategies, you can effectively manage and minimize the incidence of various rot diseases in your Cowpea (Vegetable) crop.
