As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the use of Ethrel, 2,4-D, and Boron in Cowpea (Vegetable) for Haryana conditions:

1.  **Ethrel (Ethephon)**
    This is not known to be recommended as a growth regulator/hormone for general yield enhancement or specific growth modulation in Cowpea (Vegetable) under Haryana conditions. Its application for such purposes is not a standard practice and could potentially lead to undesirable effects on a vegetable crop focused on continuous pod production.

2.  **2,4-D**
    This is not known to be recommended as a growth regulator/hormone for Cowpea (Vegetable). **2,4-D** is primarily a potent herbicide for broadleaf weeds. Cowpea is a broadleaf legume, and even very low concentrations of **2,4-D** can cause severe phytotoxicity, malformation, and significant yield loss or plant death. Its use as a growth regulator in cowpea is highly risky and not advised.

3.  **Boron**
    Boron is an essential micronutrient, not a hormone or growth regulator in the same class as ethephon or 2,4-D. However, it plays a crucial role in flowering, pollen viability, fruit set, and overall plant development in legumes like cowpea. Its deficiency can significantly reduce yield. Foliar application of boron can be beneficial, especially if soil tests indicate low boron levels or as a prophylactic measure to improve flowering and podding.

    *   **Recommended Dose:**
        *   **Soluble Boron** (e.g., **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** or **Sodium tetraborate decahydrate** containing 10-20% Boron): 1-2 g per litre of water (0.1-0.2% solution).
    *   **Timing:**
        *   First spray at the pre-flowering stage.
        *   A second spray can be given 15-20 days after the first, during early pod development, if needed.
