As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), here are the recommended cultivation practices for Cowpea (Vegetable) in Haryana:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   Cowpea is typically sown directly in rows.
    *   For vegetable types, flatbed sowing is common, but ridge and furrow method can also be adopted, especially in areas prone to waterlogging or for better irrigation management.
    *   Ensure good soil tilth for proper germination.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   Seeds should be sown at a depth of **3-5 cm**.
    *   Shallow planting can lead to poor germination due to moisture stress, while deep planting can hinder emergence.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   **Row-to-row spacing:** **45-60 cm**
    *   **Plant-to-plant spacing:** **15-20 cm**
    *   This spacing allows for adequate light penetration, air circulation, and ease of intercultural operations and harvesting.

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   The recommended seed rate for vegetable cowpea is **20-25 kg/acre**.
    *   Ensure good quality, viable seeds for optimal plant stand.
