Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I advise that addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium) in Cowpea (Vegetable) is crucial for optimal yield and quality. It is highly recommended to conduct a soil test before planting to determine the exact nutrient status of your field and tailor the fertilizer application accordingly. The following recommendations are general guidelines for Cowpea cultivation in Haryana.

---

### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

Cowpea is a leguminous crop and has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria (Rhizobium) in its root nodules. Therefore, it requires less external nitrogen compared to non-leguminous crops. Excessive nitrogen can inhibit nodulation.

*   **Symptoms:** General yellowing of older leaves, stunted growth, and reduced vigor.
*   **Prevention/Basal Application:**
    *   A starter dose of nitrogen is beneficial for initial plant establishment before effective nodulation begins.
    *   Apply 15-20 kg of Nitrogen per acre at the time of sowing.
    *   This can be supplied using:
        *   **Urea** (46% N): Approximately 32-43 kg of **Urea** per acre.
    *   Ensure proper Rhizobium inoculation of seeds before sowing to enhance nitrogen fixation.
*   **Corrective Measures (if deficiency appears despite good nodulation):**
    *   If severe deficiency symptoms appear during the vegetative stage, a foliar spray can be applied.
    *   Foliar spray of **Urea** (0.5-1% solution): Dissolve 5-10 g of **Urea** per litre of water and spray evenly on the foliage. Repeat after 7-10 days if necessary.

### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

Phosphorus is vital for root development, nodulation, flowering, and pod formation in Cowpea.

*   **Symptoms:** Purplish discoloration of older leaves, stunted growth, poor root development, delayed flowering, and reduced pod set.
*   **Prevention/Basal Application:**
    *   Apply 40-60 kg of P2O5 per acre at the time of sowing.
    *   This can be supplied using:
        *   **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5): Approximately 87-130 kg of **DAP** per acre. (Note: This will also provide some nitrogen, so adjust **Urea** application accordingly).
        *   **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5): Approximately 250-375 kg of **SSP** per acre.
    *   Mix the fertilizer thoroughly into the soil before sowing or apply in furrows at sowing depth.
*   **Corrective Measures (if deficiency appears):**
    *   For immediate relief, a foliar spray can be effective.
    *   Foliar spray of **Monoammonium Phosphate (MAP)** (12% N, 61% P2O5) (0.5-1% solution): Dissolve 5-10 g of **MAP** per litre of water and spray.
    *   Alternatively, **Potassium Dihydrogen Phosphate (MKP)** (0% N, 52% P2O5, 34% K2O) (0.5-1% solution): Dissolve 5-10 g of **MKP** per litre of water and spray.

### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency

Potassium plays a crucial role in water regulation, nutrient transport, enzyme activation, disease resistance, and overall pod quality and yield in Cowpea.

*   **Symptoms:** Yellowing and scorching/browning of leaf margins (especially older leaves), weak stems, poor pod development, and reduced seed size.
*   **Prevention/Basal Application:**
    *   Apply 40-50 kg of K2O per acre at the time of sowing.
    *   This can be supplied using:
        *   **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** (60% K2O): Approximately 67-83 kg of **MOP** per acre.
        *   **Sulphate of Potash (SOP)** (50% K2O, 17.5% S): Approximately 80-100 kg of **SOP** per acre (beneficial if sulfur is also deficient).
    *   Mix the fertilizer thoroughly into the soil before sowing or apply in furrows.
*   **Corrective Measures (if deficiency appears):**
    *   Foliar spray of **Potassium Nitrate** (13% N, 45% K2O) (0.5-1% solution): Dissolve 5-10 g of **Potassium Nitrate** per litre of water and spray.
    *   Alternatively, **Potassium Dihydrogen Phosphate (MKP)** (0% N, 52% P2O5, 34% K2O) (0.5-1% solution): Dissolve 5-10 g of **MKP** per litre of water and spray.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Soil Testing:** Always prioritize soil testing to get precise recommendations for your specific field conditions.
*   **Application Method:** For basal application, ensure fertilizers are well incorporated into the soil to maximize nutrient availability.
*   **Watering:** After soil application of fertilizers, light irrigation helps in dissolving the nutrients and making them available to the plant roots.
*   **Foliar Sprays:** Apply foliar sprays during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to avoid leaf burn and ensure better absorption. Use sufficient water volume to ensure complete coverage of the foliage.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively manage macro-nutrient deficiencies in Cowpea (Vegetable) and achieve a healthy, productive crop.
