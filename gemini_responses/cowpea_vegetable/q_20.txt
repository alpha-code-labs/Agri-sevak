As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified approaches to address micronutrient deficiencies in Cowpea (Vegetable) in Haryana. It is crucial to conduct a soil test to confirm specific deficiencies and their severity before applying any amendments.

**General Recommendations:**
*   **Soil Testing:** Always start with a comprehensive soil test to accurately diagnose deficiencies and determine the precise quantities of nutrients required.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management:** Combine soil application for long-term correction with foliar sprays for quick relief, especially in standing crops.
*   **Timing:** Apply foliar sprays during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to maximize absorption and prevent leaf scorching.

### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Stunted growth, small leaves (little leaf symptom), interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, and sometimes bronzing of leaves.

**Correction:**
*   **Soil Application (Preventive/Severe Deficiency):**
    *   Apply **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (21% Zn) at 10-12 kg/acre, or **Zinc sulphate monohydrate** (33% Zn) at 6-8 kg/acre, broadcast and incorporated into the soil before sowing.
*   **Foliar Application (Curative):**
    *   Spray 0.5% solution of **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (5 g/L water) or 0.25% solution of **Chelated Zinc (Zn-EDTA)** (2.5 g/L water). Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, starting from 20-25 days after sowing.

### 2. Iron (Fe) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Prominent interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, with veins remaining distinctly green. In severe cases, entire leaves may turn yellow or white.

**Correction:**
*   **Soil Application (Severe Deficiency, less effective in alkaline soils):**
    *   Apply **Ferrous sulphate** (19% Fe) at 20-25 kg/acre, or **Chelated Iron (Fe-EDTA)** at 5-10 kg/acre, incorporated into the soil.
*   **Foliar Application (Most effective for quick correction):**
    *   Spray 0.5-1.0% solution of **Ferrous sulphate** (5-10 g/L water) along with 0.1% citric acid (1 g/L water) to enhance absorption.
    *   Alternatively, spray 0.1-0.2% solution of **Chelated Iron (Fe-EDTA)** (1-2 g/L water). Apply 2-3 sprays at 7-10 day intervals, targeting young foliage.

### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Stunted growth, cracking of stems and petioles, poor flower and pod set, deformed pods, and death of growing points (terminal buds).

**Correction:**
*   **Soil Application (Preventive/Severe Deficiency):**
    *   Apply **Borax (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate)** (10.5-11.3% B) at 2-4 kg/acre, or **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (20% B) at 1-2 kg/acre, broadcast and incorporated before sowing.
*   **Foliar Application (Curative):**
    *   Spray 0.1-0.2% solution of **Borax** (1-2 g/L water) or **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (1-2 g/L water). Apply 1-2 sprays, one at pre-flowering and another at pod initiation stage.

### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Affects growing points, leading to distorted or necrotic young leaves, stunted root growth, and poor pod development.

**Correction:**
*   **Soil Application (Preventive/Long-term):**
    *   Apply **Gypsum (Calcium sulphate)** at 200-400 kg/acre (depending on soil type and pH) or **Calcium nitrate** at 10-15 kg/acre, incorporated into the soil.
*   **Foliar Application (Curative):**
    *   Spray 0.5-1.0% solution of **Calcium chloride** (5-10 g/L water) or **Calcium nitrate** (5-10 g/L water). Apply 2-3 sprays during flowering and pod development stages.

### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, with veins remaining green. Leaves may become brittle and develop reddish-purple tints in severe cases.

**Correction:**
*   **Soil Application (Preventive/Severe Deficiency):**
    *   Apply **Magnesium sulphate** (Epsom salt) at 10-20 kg/acre, broadcast and incorporated before sowing.
*   **Foliar Application (Curative):**
    *   Spray 1.0-2.0% solution of **Magnesium sulphate** (10-20 g/L water). Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, targeting affected foliage.

### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, often appearing as a fine network of green veins on a pale background. In severe cases, small necrotic spots may appear.

**Correction:**
*   **Soil Application (Less common, use with caution as Mn can be toxic in excess):**
    *   Apply **Manganese sulphate** at 5-10 kg/acre, incorporated into the soil, primarily in high pH soils where Mn availability is low.
*   **Foliar Application (Most effective):**
    *   Spray 0.5% solution of **Manganese sulphate** (5 g/L water) or 0.1-0.2% solution of **Chelated Manganese (Mn-EDTA)** (1-2 g/L water). Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, starting from 20-25 days after sowing.

Always ensure thorough coverage during foliar applications and consult with local agricultural extension services for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions.
