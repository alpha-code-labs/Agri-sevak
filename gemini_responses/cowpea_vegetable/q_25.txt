As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following irrigation management practices for Cowpea (Vegetable) in Haryana:

Cowpea is relatively drought-tolerant, but timely irrigation at critical growth stages is crucial for optimal yield and quality of pods.

### General Irrigation Principles:

*   **Soil Type:** Lighter soils (sandy loam) require more frequent but lighter irrigations compared to heavier soils (clay loam).
*   **Avoid Waterlogging:** Cowpea is sensitive to waterlogging, which can lead to root rot and reduced growth. Ensure proper drainage.
*   **Critical Stages:** The most critical stages for irrigation are branching, flowering, and pod development.

### Irrigation Schedule:

1.  **Pre-sowing Irrigation (Palewa):**
    *   If sowing in dry soil, a pre-sowing irrigation is highly recommended to ensure good germination and establishment. This should be done 7-10 days before sowing, allowing the soil to reach optimal moisture for seedbed preparation.

2.  **First Irrigation:**
    *   **Timing:** The first irrigation should generally be applied around **20-25 days after sowing (DAS)**. This coincides with the early vegetative growth and branching stage, which is important for developing a strong plant structure.
    *   **Considerations:** If there has been sufficient rainfall or if the soil moisture from pre-sowing irrigation is still adequate, this irrigation can be delayed slightly. Conversely, in very light soils or hot, dry conditions, it might be needed slightly earlier.

3.  **Second Irrigation:**
    *   **Timing:** The second irrigation is critical and should be given at the **pre-flowering or early flowering stage**, typically around **40-45 DAS**. Water stress during flowering can significantly reduce pod set and yield.
    *   **Subsequent Irrigations:** Depending on rainfall, soil type, and prevailing weather conditions, 1-2 additional irrigations may be required during the pod development stage (every 10-15 days) to ensure continuous podding and good pod quality.
    *   **Final Irrigation:** Stop irrigation about **7-10 days before the final harvest** to allow pods to mature properly and facilitate harvesting.

### Sprinkler Use:

Sprinkler irrigation is an excellent and highly efficient method for irrigating Cowpea (Vegetable) in Haryana, offering several advantages:

*   **Water Use Efficiency:** Sprinklers can save **30-50%** of water compared to traditional flood irrigation methods, making them ideal for water-scarce regions of Haryana.
*   **Uniform Water Distribution:** Ensures even application of water across the field, leading to uniform crop growth and yield.
*   **Reduced Nutrient Leaching:** Minimizes the loss of soluble nutrients from the root zone.
*   **Suitable for Undulating Terrain:** Can be effectively used on uneven land where flood irrigation is difficult.
*   **Fertigation:** Allows for the application of water-soluble fertilizers along with irrigation water, improving nutrient use efficiency.
*   **Recommendation:** Micro-sprinklers or mini-sprinklers are particularly well-suited for row crops like cowpea. While the initial investment might be higher, the long-term benefits in terms of water saving, increased yield, and reduced labor often outweigh the costs. Ensure proper system design and maintenance for optimal performance.
