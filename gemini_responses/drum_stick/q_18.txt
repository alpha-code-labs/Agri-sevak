Dear Farmer,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified doses for Growth Regulators/Hormones in Drum Stick (Moringa oleifera) to enhance flowering, fruit set, and overall yield in Haryana conditions:

1.  **Ethephon (for flower induction and uniform maturity):**
    *   **Recommended Dose:** 100-200 ppm (parts per million) of active ingredient.
    *   **Application:** This translates to approximately **0.25-0.5 ml of Ethephon 39% SL** (Soluble Liquid) formulation per liter of water.
    *   **Timing:** Apply at the pre-flowering stage to induce early and profuse flowering, and for uniform fruit maturity. A second spray can be given after 15-20 days if needed.

2.  **2,4-D Sodium Salt (for fruit retention and preventing flower drop):**
    *   **Recommended Dose:** 5-10 ppm (parts per million) of active ingredient.
    *   **Application:** This translates to approximately **0.006-0.0125 g of 2,4-D Sodium Salt 80% WP** (Wettable Powder) formulation per liter of water.
    *   **Timing:** Apply at the early flowering or fruit set stage to reduce flower and young fruit drop.
    *   **Important Precaution:** **Extreme caution is advised.** 2,4-D is primarily a herbicide. Even a slightly higher concentration than recommended can cause severe phytotoxicity and damage to the drum stick plants. Ensure precise measurement and uniform application. Avoid spraying during windy conditions to prevent drift to other crops.

3.  **Boron (as a micronutrient for pollen viability and fruit set):**
    *   **Recommended Dose:** 0.1-0.2% solution.
    *   **Application:** This translates to **1-2 g of Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (e.g., Solubor, typically 20% Boron) per liter of water.
    *   **Timing:** Apply as a foliar spray at the pre-flowering stage and again at the early fruit set stage. Boron is crucial for pollen germination, fertilization, and overall fruit development, preventing malformed fruits and improving yield.

**General Recommendations for Application:**
*   Always use clean water for mixing.
*   Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.
*   Spray during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize evaporation and maximize absorption.
*   Do not exceed the recommended doses, as this can lead to adverse effects.
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label.
