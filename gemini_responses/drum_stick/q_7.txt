As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Dieback, Twig blight, and Tikka disease in Drum Stick (Moringa oleifera) in Haryana:

### Control of Dieback in Drum Stick

Dieback in Drum Stick is a common problem, often caused by fungal pathogens like *Diplodia* spp. or *Botryodiplodia theobromae*, leading to the drying and death of branches from the tip downwards.

**Cultural Practices:**
*   **Pruning:** Immediately prune and destroy all affected branches, cutting well below the visible symptoms into healthy wood. Disinfect pruning tools with a 10% bleach solution after each cut to prevent disease spread.
*   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy all fallen plant debris from around the trees.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure balanced nutrition to improve plant vigor and resistance.
*   **Water Management:** Avoid water stress (both deficit and excess) as it can predispose plants to dieback.

**Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
Apply fungicides after pruning, ensuring thorough coverage of the plant.
*   **Copper Oxychloride 50% WP:** Apply at a concentration of 3-4 g/L of water.
*   **Carbendazim 50% WP:** Apply at a concentration of 1 g/L of water.
*   **Propiconazole 25% EC:** Apply at a concentration of 0.5 ml/L of water.

Rotate between different classes of fungicides to prevent resistance development. Repeat application may be necessary depending on disease severity and weather conditions, typically every 10-15 days.

### Control of Twig Blight in Drum Stick

Twig blight in Drum Stick is often caused by similar fungal pathogens as Dieback, resulting in the browning and death of young twigs and shoots.

**Cultural Practices:**
*   **Pruning:** As with Dieback, promptly prune and destroy infected twigs and branches, cutting into healthy tissue. Sanitize pruning tools.
*   **Sanitation:** Maintain field hygiene by removing plant debris.
*   **Air Circulation:** Ensure proper spacing between plants and prune for good air circulation within the canopy to reduce humidity, which favors fungal growth.

**Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
Apply fungicides, ensuring good coverage of the affected twigs and foliage.
*   **Copper Oxychloride 50% WP:** Apply at a concentration of 3-4 g/L of water.
*   **Carbendazim 50% WP:** Apply at a concentration of 1 g/L of water.
*   **Propiconazole 25% EC:** Apply at a concentration of 0.5 ml/L of water.

Follow the same rotation and re-application guidelines as for Dieback.

### Control of Tikka Disease in Drum Stick

This is not known to affect Drum Stick. Tikka disease is a specific term primarily used for a major leaf spot disease of Groundnut (Peanut) caused by *Cercospora arachidicola* and *Phaeoisariopsis personata*. While *Cercospora* species can cause leaf spots on Drum Stick, the condition is generally referred to as "Cercospora leaf spot" or simply "leaf spot," not "Tikka disease."
