Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide you with the ideal guidelines for Drum Stick (Moringa oleifera) transplantation in Haryana.

Drumstick is a highly valuable crop, and proper transplantation ensures good establishment and yield.

### Ideal Transplantation Time

The best times for transplanting drumstick seedlings in Haryana are:

*   **Monsoon Season:** June to July. The onset of monsoon provides ideal moisture conditions for seedling establishment.
*   **Spring Season:** February to March. This allows the plants to establish well before the intense summer heat and benefit from the subsequent monsoon.

### Ideal Transplantation Distance

The spacing depends on the variety (annual or perennial) and the purpose (pod production, leaf production, or high-density planting). For general pod production, which is common in Haryana, the following spacing is recommended:

*   **Row to Row:** 2.5 meters to 3 meters
*   **Plant to Plant:** 2.5 meters to 3 meters

This spacing allows for good light penetration, air circulation, and ease of harvesting. For high-density planting primarily for leaf production, closer spacing like 1 meter x 1 meter can be adopted, but it requires regular pruning.

### Transplantation Process

Follow these steps for successful drumstick transplantation:

1.  **Seedling Preparation:**
    *   Sow drumstick seeds in polybags (15 cm x 10 cm) or raised nursery beds.
    *   Use a well-drained potting mix enriched with compost.
    *   Seedlings are typically ready for transplanting when they are 30-45 days old and have reached a height of 30-45 cm.

2.  **Land Preparation:**
    *   Plow the field thoroughly to a depth of 20-30 cm to ensure a fine tilth.
    *   Mark the planting spots according to the recommended spacing.
    *   Dig pits of 45 cm x 45 cm x 45 cm at each marked spot.

3.  **Pit Enrichment:**
    *   Fill each pit with a mixture of topsoil, 10-15 kg of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost, and 100 grams of Single Super Phosphate (SSP). Mix thoroughly.

4.  **Transplanting:**
    *   Water the polybags a few hours before transplanting to ease removal.
    *   Carefully remove the seedling from the polybag, ensuring the root ball remains intact and undisturbed.
    *   Place the seedling gently in the center of the prepared pit.
    *   Backfill the pit with the remaining soil mixture, gently firming the soil around the base of the seedling to remove air pockets.
    *   Ensure the seedling is planted at the same depth as it was in the polybag.

5.  **Post-Transplantation Care:**
    *   **Immediate Watering:** Water the transplanted seedlings immediately and thoroughly to help them settle and reduce transplant shock.
    *   **Shading (Optional):** In very hot conditions, providing temporary shade for the first few days can be beneficial.
    *   **Weeding:** Keep the area around the young plants free of weeds.
    *   **Irrigation:** Provide regular irrigation, especially during dry periods, until the plants are well-established. Avoid waterlogging.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure a healthy start for your drumstick crop in Haryana.
