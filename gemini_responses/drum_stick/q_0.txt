Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend an Integrated Disease Management (IDM) approach for controlling fungal diseases in Drum Stick (Moringa oleifera). This combines cultural practices with judicious use of CIBRC-approved fungicides, ensuring sustainable and effective control for your fields in Haryana.

**General Cultural Practices for Fungal Disease Management:**

*   **Field Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy infected plant debris (leaves, twigs, fallen pods) from the field to reduce the source of inoculum.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing (as per recommended practices for Drum Stick) to improve air circulation within the canopy. This helps reduce humidity, which is conducive to fungal growth.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced fertilizers based on soil test recommendations. Avoid excessive nitrogen application, which can lead to lush, succulent growth more susceptible to fungal infections.
*   **Water Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation late in the day, as it keeps foliage wet for prolonged periods. Drip irrigation is preferred, or irrigate in the morning to allow leaves to dry quickly.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** If available and suitable for Haryana conditions, choose disease-tolerant or resistant varieties.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops to break the disease cycle in the soil.

**Specific Control Measures for Fungal Diseases:**

1.  **Alternaria Leaf Spot, Anthracnose, Blight (e.g., Cercospora leaf blight), Brown Spot:**
    These diseases typically cause spots, lesions, or blighting on leaves, stems, and sometimes pods, leading to defoliation and reduced yield.

    *   **Preventive/Protective Spray (at early signs or during humid conditions):**
        *   **Mancozeb** @ 2.0-2.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Chlorothalonil** @ 2.0 g/L of water.
    *   **Curative/Systemic Spray (if disease incidence is moderate to high):**
        *   **Azoxystrobin** @ 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water.
        *   **Propiconazole** @ 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Difenoconazole** @ 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in fungal pathogens.

2.  **Downy Mildew:**
    Characterized by yellowish, angular spots on the upper leaf surface, often delimited by veins, and a grayish-white, fuzzy growth (sporangiophores) on the corresponding underside of the leaf.

    *   **Preventive Spray:**
        *   **Mancozeb** @ 2.0-2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Systemic/Curative Spray:**
        *   **Metalaxyl-M + Mancozeb** (combination product) @ 2.0-2.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Dimethomorph + Mancozeb** (combination product) @ 2.0 g/L of water.

3.  **Powdery Mildew:**
    Appears as white, powdery patches or spots on the upper and lower surfaces of leaves, young stems, flowers, and sometimes pods. Severe infection can lead to leaf distortion, yellowing, and premature defoliation.

    *   **Early Stage/Preventive:**
        *   **Sulphur (Wettable Powder)** @ 2.0-3.0 g/L of water. (Avoid spraying when temperatures are very high, i.e., above 30-32°C, as it can cause phytotoxicity).
    *   **Systemic/Curative:**
        *   **Hexaconazole** @ 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water.
        *   **Myclobutanil** @ 0.4-0.6 ml/L of water.
        *   **Penconazole** @ 0.5 ml/L of water.

4.  **Blast:**
    This is not known to affect Drum Stick.

5.  **Grey Mildew:**
    This is not known to affect Drum Stick as a distinct disease.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the fungicide label for correct dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the underside of leaves, for effective control.
*   Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying operations.
*   For specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and disease severity, please consult with your local agricultural extension officers or experts at HAU.
