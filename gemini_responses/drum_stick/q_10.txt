As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in Drum Stick (Moringa oleifera) in Haryana:

### 1. Borers (Stem Borer, Pod Borer)

*   **Symptoms:**
    *   **Stem Borers:** Wilting of branches, presence of frass (excreta) and silken webs on the bark, boreholes on the stem.
    *   **Pod Borers:** Holes in developing pods, feeding on seeds inside, premature drying and shedding of pods.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Cultural:** Regularly inspect plants. Remove and destroy affected branches or pods to prevent further spread. Maintain field sanitation.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   **For Stem Borers:**
            *   Inject 5-10 ml of **Dichlorvos** (76% EC) into each borehole and immediately plug the hole with wet mud.
            *   Alternatively, swab the affected trunk area with a solution of **Chlorpyriphos** (20% EC) at 2.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **For Pod Borers:**
            *   **Chlorantraniliprole** (18.5% SC) at 0.3 ml/L of water.
            *   **Emamectin benzoate** (5% SG) at 0.2 g/L of water.
            *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** (5% EC) at 0.5 ml/L of water.

### 2. Caterpillars (Leaf-eating caterpillars)

*   **Symptoms:** Irregular holes on leaves, defoliation, skeletonization of leaves, presence of larvae (often green or hairy) on the underside of leaves or along veins.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Cultural:** Hand-pick and destroy visible larvae in the early stages of infestation.
    *   **Biological:** For young larvae, apply **Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki (Bt)** (WP) at 1-2 g/L of water. This is an eco-friendly option.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   **Chlorantraniliprole** (18.5% SC) at 0.3 ml/L of water.
        *   **Emamectin benzoate** (5% SG) at 0.2 g/L of water.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** (5% EC) at 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Flubendiamide** (20% WG) at 0.2 g/L of water.

### 3. Diamondback moth

*   This is not known to affect Drum Stick. Diamondback moth (*Plutella xylostella*) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower, mustard).

### 4. Leaf folder (*Noorda moringae*)

*   **Symptoms:** Leaves are folded or rolled, with larvae feeding inside the folds, leading to skeletonization of the leaf tissue within the fold. Affected leaves may turn brown and dry.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Cultural:** Regularly monitor plants. Collect and destroy infested leaves and shoots containing larvae.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   **Chlorantraniliprole** (18.5% SC) at 0.3 ml/L of water.
        *   **Emamectin benzoate** (5% SG) at 0.2 g/L of water.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** (5% EC) at 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Flubendiamide** (20% WG) at 0.2 g/L of water.

**General Recommendations:**

*   Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions when handling and applying any chemical pesticide.
*   Ensure proper coverage during spraying for effective control.
*   Rotate pesticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
*   Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approaches, combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods, are recommended for sustainable pest control.
*   Consult your local agricultural extension officer for specific advice tailored to your farm conditions.
