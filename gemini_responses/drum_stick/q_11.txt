Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing pests in Drum Stick (Moringa oleifera) in Haryana.

It's important to adopt an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, mechanical, biological, and judicious chemical methods for sustainable pest control.

Here's how to control Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies in Drum Stick:

### 1. Beetles (e.g., Flea Beetles, Leaf Beetles)

Beetles, particularly flea beetles and various leaf beetles, can be significant pests of Drum Stick, especially on young plants. They feed on leaves, creating small holes or skeletonizing the foliage, which can stunt growth and reduce yield.

**A. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy affected plant parts and weeds around the field, which can harbor pests.
*   **Hand Picking:** For small infestations, adult beetles can be hand-picked and destroyed, especially in the early morning or late evening.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate Drum Stick with non-host crops to break the pest life cycle.
*   **Timely Sowing:** Ensure optimal planting time to allow plants to establish well before peak pest activity.
*   **Water Management:** Maintain proper irrigation to keep plants healthy and more resilient to pest attack.

**B. Chemical Control (if infestation is severe):**
When pest populations are high and causing significant damage, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.

*   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** Apply at a rate of **0.3 ml per litre of water**. This is a newer chemistry with a favorable safety profile, effective against chewing pests.
*   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** Apply at a rate of **0.5 ml per litre of water**. This is a broad-spectrum pyrethroid insecticide effective against a wide range of chewing pests.

### 2. Weevils

Specific major weevil pests are not commonly reported for Drum Stick in Haryana. However, if minor feeding damage (e.g., notching on leaf margins, small holes) is observed, which could be attributed to generalist weevils, the general management strategies for chewing pests (as mentioned for beetles above) can be considered.

### 3. Sawflies

This is not known to affect Drum Stick.

### General Recommendations for IPM:
*   **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your Drum Stick plants for any signs of pest damage or the presence of insects. Early detection allows for timely and effective intervention.
*   **Biological Control:** Encourage natural enemies like predatory beetles, spiders, and parasitic wasps by minimizing the use of broad-spectrum insecticides.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pest resistance.
*   **Safety Precautions:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) while handling and applying pesticides. Follow the instructions on the product label carefully regarding dosage, application method, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
