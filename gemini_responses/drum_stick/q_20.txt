As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I advise on addressing micronutrient deficiencies in Drum Stick (Moringa oleifera) based on scientific principles and CIBRC approved practices for Haryana.

**Crucial First Step: Diagnosis**
Before applying any micronutrient, it is highly recommended to conduct a soil test and, if possible, a leaf tissue analysis. Visual symptoms can be misleading, and an accurate diagnosis ensures the correct nutrient is applied at the right rate, preventing unnecessary expenditure and potential nutrient imbalances.

Here's how to address specific micronutrient deficiencies:

### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, small leaves (often called 'little leaf'), interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, and sometimes a rosetting appearance of leaves.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 10-25 kg/acre of **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** (21% Zn) or 5-10 kg/acre of **Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate** (33% Zn) as a basal dose or broadcast and incorporate into the soil.
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.5% solution (5 g/L) of **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** or 0.25% solution (2.5 g/L) of **Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate** or 1 g/L of **Zinc EDTA** (12% Zn) at 10-15 day intervals until symptoms disappear. Use 200-400 litres of water per acre depending on plant size.

### 2. Iron (Fe) / Ferrous Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Pronounced interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, where the veins remain green but the tissue between them turns yellow, eventually becoming almost white in severe cases.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** In Haryana's high pH soils, soil application of iron is often less effective. However, if recommended by soil test, apply 25-50 kg/acre of **Ferrous Sulphate** (19% Fe).
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.5-1% solution (5-10 g/L) of **Ferrous Sulphate** or 1-2 g/L of **Ferrous EDTA** (12% Fe). Repeat at 10-15 day intervals as needed. **Ferrous EDTA** is generally more effective in high pH conditions.

### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Death of terminal buds and growing points, resulting in stunted growth. Leaves may be thick, brittle, and distorted. Stems can show cracking, and fruit set may be poor.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 2-4 kg/acre of **Borax** (Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate, 10.5-11.3% B) or 1-2 kg/acre of **Boric Acid** (17% B) as a basal application.
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.1-0.2% solution (1-2 g/L) of **Borax** or **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (20% B) or **Boric Acid**. Repeat after 15-20 days if symptoms persist.

### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Death of growing points (terminal buds, root tips), young leaves may be distorted, curled, or show marginal necrosis. Stems can be weak.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** If soil pH is low, liming can help. For direct calcium supply, apply **Gypsum** (Calcium Sulphate) at 200-500 kg/acre (based on soil test) or 10-20 kg/acre of **Calcium Nitrate** (18.8% Ca).
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.5-1% solution (5-10 g/L) of **Calcium Nitrate** or **Calcium Chloride** (27% Ca). Repeat at 10-15 day intervals.

### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, starting from the leaf margins and progressing inwards, often with a characteristic "Christmas tree" pattern. Leaves may develop reddish or purplish tints.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 10-20 kg/acre of **Magnesium Sulphate** (Epsom Salt, 9.6% Mg) as a basal dose or broadcast.
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.5-1% solution (5-10 g/L) of **Magnesium Sulphate**. Repeat after 10-15 days if symptoms persist.

### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, similar to iron deficiency but often with a finer network of green veins. In severe cases, small necrotic spots may appear.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** In high pH soils, soil application of manganese is often less effective. If recommended, apply 10-20 kg/acre of **Manganese Sulphate** (28-30% Mn).
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.5% solution (5 g/L) of **Manganese Sulphate** or 1 g/L of **Manganese EDTA** (12% Mn). Repeat at 10-15 day intervals as needed.

**General Recommendations:**

*   **Timing of Foliar Sprays:** Apply foliar sprays during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late afternoon) to maximize absorption and prevent leaf scorching.
*   **Water Quality:** Ensure good quality water for spraying.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management:** Incorporate organic matter (farmyard manure, compost) into the soil, as it improves soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability, buffering against micronutrient deficiencies.
*   **pH Management:** In Haryana, high soil pH often limits the availability of micronutrients like Zinc, Iron, and Manganese. Regular soil testing and appropriate amendments can help manage pH.
*   **Caution:** Always read and follow the instructions on the product label. Avoid over-application, as excessive micronutrients can be toxic to plants.
