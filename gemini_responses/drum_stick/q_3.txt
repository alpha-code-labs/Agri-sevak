Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling various rot types in Drum Stick (Moringa oleifera).

Drum Stick plants are susceptible to several rot diseases, particularly root, collar, stem, seed, and seedling rots, often caused by common soil-borne fungal and oomycete pathogens such as *Phytophthora*, *Pythium*, *Rhizoctonia*, *Fusarium*, and *Sclerotium*. Black rot can also occur, often associated with fungal pathogens like *Diplodia*. Fruit rot is less common but can happen under specific conditions.

An integrated approach combining cultural practices, biological control, and judicious chemical application is crucial for effective management.

### Integrated Management for Rot Types in Drum Stick:

#### 1. Cultural and Agronomic Practices (Prevention is Key):

*   **Site Selection and Soil Drainage:** Plant Drum Stick in well-drained soils. Avoid low-lying areas prone to waterlogging, as excessive moisture is a primary trigger for most rot diseases. Raised beds can be beneficial in heavy soils.
*   **Proper Irrigation:** Irrigate judiciously. Avoid overwatering, especially during cooler periods or in heavy soils. Allow the topsoil to dry slightly between irrigations. Drip irrigation is preferred as it minimizes wetting of the stem base.
*   **Healthy Seed Material:** Use healthy, certified seeds or cuttings from disease-free mother plants.
*   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds before sowing to protect against seed rot and seedling damping-off.
*   **Optimum Spacing:** Maintain adequate plant spacing to ensure good air circulation around the plants, which helps reduce humidity and fungal growth.
*   **Field Sanitation:**
    *   Remove and destroy infected plant parts (leaves, stems, fruits) immediately to prevent the spread of pathogens.
    *   Keep the area around the plants free of weeds, which can harbor pathogens and impede air circulation.
    *   Sanitize tools and equipment used in the field.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Provide balanced nutrition to enhance plant vigor and natural resistance. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can lead to lush, soft growth more susceptible to disease.
*   **Crop Rotation:** If cultivating Drum Stick in a field, practice crop rotation with non-host crops to reduce the build-up of soil-borne pathogens.
*   **Soil Solarization:** In areas with high disease incidence, soil solarization during hot summer months can help reduce the inoculum of soil-borne pathogens.

#### 2. Biological Control:

*   **Bio-fungicides:** Application of beneficial microbial antagonists can suppress soil-borne pathogens.
    *   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds with *Trichoderma viride* or *Trichoderma harzianum* (4-5 g/kg seed) or *Pseudomonas fluorescens* (10 g/kg seed).
    *   **Soil Application/Drench:** Apply *Trichoderma viride* or *Trichoderma harzianum* (2.5 kg/acre mixed with 50 kg farmyard manure) or *Pseudomonas fluorescens* (2.5 kg/acre mixed with 50 kg farmyard manure) to the soil around the base of the plants, especially during planting or when conditions are favorable for disease development.

#### 3. Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved Technical Chemicals):

Chemical control should be used as a last resort or in conjunction with cultural and biological methods, especially when disease pressure is high. Always follow label instructions for dosage and safety.

*   **For Seed Rot and Seedling Rot (Damping-off):**
    *   **Seed Treatment:**
        *   **Carbendazim** at 1-2 g/kg seed.
        *   **Thiram** at 2-3 g/kg seed.
        *   A combination of **Carbendazim** (1 g/kg seed) + **Thiram** (2 g/kg seed) can provide broader spectrum protection.

*   **For Root, Collar, Stem, Foot, Crown, Neck Rot (caused by *Phytophthora*, *Pythium*, *Rhizoctonia*, *Fusarium*):**
    *   **Soil Drenching:**
        *   For Oomycete rots (*Phytophthora*, *Pythium*):
            *   **Metalaxyl** (e.g., Metalaxyl-M 35% WS) at 1-2 g/L of water, applied as a drench around the base of the affected plants.
            *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride** (e.g., Propamocarb hydrochloride 72.2% SL) at 2-3 ml/L of water, applied as a drench.
            *   **Fosetyl-aluminium** (e.g., Fosetyl-aluminium 80% WP) at 2-3 g/L of water, applied as a drench.
        *   For general fungal rots (*Rhizoctonia*, *Fusarium*, *Sclerotium*):
            *   **Carbendazim** (e.g., Carbendazim 50% WP) at 1-2 g/L of water, applied as a drench around the base of the plants.
            *   **Thiophanate methyl** (e.g., Thiophanate methyl 70% WP) at 1-1.5 g/L of water, applied as a drench.
            *   A combination product containing **Carbendazim** + **Mancozeb** (e.g., Carbendazim 12% + Mancozeb 63% WP) at 2-2.5 g/L of water can provide broad-spectrum control.

*   **For Black Rot / Stem Rot (if fungal in nature):**
    *   **Foliar Spray / Drench:**
        *   **Mancozeb** (e.g., Mancozeb 75% WP) at 2-2.5 g/L of water, as a protective spray or drench.
        *   **Carbendazim** (e.g., Carbendazim 50% WP) at 1-2 g/L of water, as a spray or drench.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the fungicide label carefully, including dosage, application method, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and safety precautions.
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in pathogens.
*   Consult your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and the prevailing disease pressure.

By implementing these integrated strategies, you can effectively manage and control various rot diseases in your Drum Stick cultivation.
