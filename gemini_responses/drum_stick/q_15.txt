As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), here is the scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Drum Stick (Moringa oleifera) in Haryana:

**1. Grasshopper:**
Grasshoppers are general feeders and can cause significant defoliation, especially on young Drum Stick plants.

*   **Cultural Control:** For small infestations, hand-picking and destroying the nymphs and adults can be an effective initial step.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Spray with **Malathion** 50% EC at 2 ml/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, spray with **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage, especially on the underside of leaves.

**2. Painted bug:**
This is not known to affect Drum Stick.

**3. Red cotton bug:**
This is not known to affect Drum Stick.

**4. Black ants:**
Black ants are generally not direct pests that feed on Drum Stick plants. They are often found in association with sap-sucking insects like aphids, mealybugs, or scale insects, as they feed on the honeydew excreted by these pests and may even protect them from natural enemies. If ants are present, it is advisable to first check for the presence of such sap-sucking pests and manage them. If ants are causing a nuisance by nesting at the base of the plant, disturbing roots, or actively protecting other pests, direct control measures can be considered.

*   **Chemical Control (for ant nests/trails at the base):**
    *   Drench the soil around the base of the plant with **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 2.5 ml/L of water. Avoid direct application on the edible parts of the plant. This treatment targets ants in the soil or at the plant base.
