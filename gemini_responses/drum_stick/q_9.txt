Mites, particularly Red Spider Mite (Tetranychus urticae) and Rust Mite (Eriophyes moringae or similar species), can cause significant damage to Drum Stick (Moringa oleifera) crops in Haryana, leading to reduced yield and quality. As a Senior Agronomist, I recommend an integrated approach for effective and sustainable control.

### Symptoms of Mite Infestation:
*   **Red Spider Mite:** Yellowish speckles on leaves, bronzing, webbing on the undersides of leaves, leaf drop.
*   **Rust Mite:** Russeting or bronzing of leaves, especially young leaves and pods, stunted growth, distorted leaves.

### Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies:

1.  **Cultural Control:**
    *   **Water Spray:** Regularly spray the undersides of leaves with a strong jet of water to dislodge mites and wash away eggs. This is particularly effective for red spider mites.
    *   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy severely infested leaves, branches, or plant parts to reduce the mite population.
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the field free of weeds, as many weeds can act as alternate hosts for mites.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure balanced fertilization. Excessive nitrogen can sometimes favor mite multiplication.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation to break the pest cycle.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Encourage natural enemies like predatory mites (e.g., Amblyseius spp.), lacewings, and ladybird beetles, which feed on pest mites. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

3.  **Chemical Control (Acaricides/Miticides):**
    When cultural and biological methods are insufficient, or infestation levels are high, chemical control may be necessary. Always ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where mites reside. Rotate chemicals to prevent resistance development.

    Here are some CIBRC approved technical chemicals effective against mites in Drum Stick:

    *   **Spiromesifen (22.9% SC):** Apply at a rate of **0.5 - 0.75 ml/L** of water. This is effective against all life stages of mites and has translaminar action.
    *   **Propargite (57% EC):** Apply at a rate of **1.0 - 1.5 ml/L** of water. It is a contact miticide effective against a wide range of mites.
    *   **Fenpyroximate (5% EC):** Apply at a rate of **0.5 - 1.0 ml/L** of water. It acts by contact and stomach action, effective against eggs, nymphs, and adults.
    *   **Wettable Sulphur (80% WP):** Apply at a rate of **2.0 - 3.0 g/L** of water. This is a broad-spectrum miticide, particularly effective against rust mites and also has fungicidal properties. Avoid application during very hot weather (above 30-32°C) to prevent phytotoxicity.
    *   **Abamectin (1.9% EC):** Apply at a rate of **0.3 - 0.5 ml/L** of water. It has translaminar action and is effective against mites and leaf miners.

    **Application Guidelines:**
    *   **Timing:** Apply acaricides when mite populations are building up, or at the first sign of infestation. Repeat application if necessary, usually after 7-10 days, depending on the product label and severity of infestation.
    *   **Coverage:** Ensure complete and uniform spray coverage, especially targeting the undersides of leaves.
    *   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) like gloves, masks, and protective clothing during mixing and spraying. Follow the instructions and safety precautions mentioned on the product label.
    *   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Strictly observe the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) mentioned on the product label before harvesting Drum Stick pods for consumption. This is crucial for food safety.

By combining these strategies, you can effectively manage mite infestations in your Drum Stick crop and ensure healthy yields. For specific local recommendations or severe outbreaks, please consult with the agricultural extension officers at HAU.
