As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I will provide scientifically verified advice for controlling the conditions you've mentioned in Drum Stick (Moringa oleifera) for Haryana.

### 1. Scab in Drum Stick

This is not known to affect Drum Stick as a specific disease. While some fungal infections might cause scab-like lesions, 'Scab' itself is not a recognized primary disease of Moringa.

### 2. Canker in Drum Stick

Canker is a significant issue in Drum Stick, often caused by fungal pathogens (e.g., *Lasiodiplodia theobromae*) or bacterial infections, leading to bark lesions, dieback, and reduced vigor.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Regularly inspect trees for any signs of canker, especially after heavy rains or periods of stress.
    *   Prune affected branches well below the visible canker, ensuring clean cuts into healthy wood. Disinfect pruning tools with a 10% bleach solution or methylated spirit between cuts to prevent the spread of pathogens.
    *   Remove and destroy all pruned material by burning to eliminate inoculum sources.
    *   Avoid mechanical injuries to the trunk and branches, as these serve as easy entry points for pathogens.
    *   Ensure proper tree nutrition and irrigation to maintain tree vigor, making it more resistant to diseases.
*   **Chemical Control (Post-Pruning/Preventive):**
    *   After pruning, apply a fungicidal paste or spray to the cut surfaces and affected areas.
    *   For existing cankers, gently scrape off the affected bark until healthy tissue is exposed, then apply a fungicidal paste.
    *   **Copper Oxychloride** 50% WP: Mix 3-4 grams per litre of water for spraying, or prepare a thick paste for application on scraped cankers.
    *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: Mix 1-2 grams per litre of water for spraying, or prepare a paste for application on scraped cankers.
    *   **Propiconazole** 25% EC: Mix 1 ml per litre of water for spraying, ensuring thorough coverage of affected parts.

### 3. Gummosis in Drum Stick

Gummosis is the exudation of gum from the bark of the tree, often a symptom of underlying stress, injury, or disease (like canker, root rot, or pest infestation). In Drum Stick, it's frequently associated with fungal infections.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Identify and Address the Root Cause:**
    *   Thoroughly inspect the tree for any signs of injury, pest attack, or canker. Treat these underlying issues first.
    *   Ensure proper drainage around the tree base to prevent waterlogging, which can stress the tree and predispose it to gummosis.
    *   Maintain optimal soil moisture and nutrient levels to promote tree health.
*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Carefully scrape off the gum and discolored bark until healthy tissue is exposed. Disinfect tools before and after use.
    *   Improve air circulation around the tree by judicious pruning.
*   **Chemical Control (if pathogen-related):**
    *   After scraping, apply a fungicidal paste or spray to the affected area.
    *   **Copper Oxychloride** 50% WP: Mix 3-4 grams per litre of water for spraying, or prepare a thick paste for application on scraped areas.
    *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: Mix 1-2 grams per litre of water for spraying, or prepare a paste for application on scraped areas.
    *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP: Mix 2-2.5 grams per litre of water for spraying, especially if root rot or collar rot is suspected as the underlying cause.

### 4. Lichen in Drum Stick

Lichen is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and an alga. It grows superficially on the bark of trees and is generally **not parasitic or harmful** to the Drum Stick tree. Its presence often indicates good air quality and a healthy environment.

**Control Measures:**

*   No specific control measures are required as lichen does not damage the tree or impede its growth.
*   If removal is desired for purely aesthetic reasons, a gentle scrubbing with a stiff brush or a very mild solution of **Copper Oxychloride** (0.5-1 g/L) can be applied, but this is generally not recommended for tree health purposes.
