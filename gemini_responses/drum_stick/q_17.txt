Here are the recommended doses for organic manures in Drum Stick (Moringa oleifera) cultivation, as per scientifically verified practices suitable for Haryana:

*   **Farm Yard Manure (FYM):** Apply 10-15 tonnes per acre annually. It should be well-decomposed and incorporated into the soil during land preparation or applied around the base of established trees before the monsoon season.

*   **Vermicompost:** Apply 3-5 tonnes per acre annually. This can be incorporated into the soil during planting or applied as a top dressing around the root zone of existing plants.

*   **Sagarika (IFFCO):** This is a seaweed extract bio-stimulant.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Mix 2.5 - 3.0 ml of **Sagarika** per litre of water and spray evenly on the foliage. Apply during critical growth stages such as active vegetative growth, pre-flowering, and fruit set. Repeat 2-3 times during the cropping season at 15-20 day intervals.
    *   **Soil Application/Drench:** Apply 500 ml - 1 litre of **Sagarika** per acre, mixed with irrigation water or as a drench around the root zone, especially during early growth stages or after pruning.

**Note:** Regular soil testing is recommended to determine the specific nutrient requirements of your soil and to optimize the application of organic and inorganic fertilizers.
