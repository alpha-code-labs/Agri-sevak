Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing these pests in Drum Stick (Moringa).

First, let's clarify the pests:

*   **Ber fly (*Carpomyia vesuviana*)**: This is not known to affect Drum Stick. Ber fly is a highly specific pest of Ber (*Ziziphus mauritiana*) and related *Ziziphus* species.

Now, regarding **Fruit fly** control in Drum Stick:

Fruit flies (various *Bactrocera* species) can indeed infest Drum Stick pods, causing significant damage by laying eggs in the developing pods, leading to maggot infestation and subsequent rotting. An Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is crucial for effective control.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Fruit Fly in Drum Stick:**

1.  **Cultural and Mechanical Methods:**
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Regularly collect and destroy all fallen, damaged, or infested pods. This is critical to break the life cycle of the fruit fly by eliminating breeding sites. Bury them deep or burn them.
    *   **Deep Ploughing:** After harvest, deep ploughing can expose pupae in the soil to predators and sunlight, reducing the next generation.
    *   **Timely Harvest:** Harvest pods at the right stage of maturity to prevent them from becoming overly attractive to fruit flies.

2.  **Monitoring and Trapping:**
    *   **Pheromone Traps:** Install Methyl Eugenol traps at a density of 10-15 traps per acre. These traps specifically attract and kill male fruit flies, disrupting their mating cycle. Replace the lure every 2-3 weeks.

3.  **Chemical Control (if necessary, and as a last resort):**
    When infestation levels are high, chemical intervention may be required. Focus on targeted applications like bait sprays to minimize impact on beneficial insects.

    *   **Poison Bait Sprays:** This is a highly effective and targeted method. Prepare a bait solution and apply it as spot sprays on the tree trunk or on a few leaves, not as a full canopy spray.
        *   Mix 100 g of jaggery (gur) or protein hydrolysate with 10 litres of water.
        *   Add one of the following CIBRC approved insecticides:
            *   **Malathion 50 EC**: 20 ml per 10 litres of the bait solution.
            *   **Deltamethrin 2.8 EC**: 10 ml per 10 litres of the bait solution.
        *   Apply this bait solution as small spots (about 100 ml per spot) on 10-15 trees per acre, preferably in the morning. Repeat every 7-10 days if infestation persists.

    *   **Foliar Sprays (for severe infestation):** If the infestation is very severe and bait sprays are not sufficient, a full foliar spray might be considered.
        *   **Spinosad 45 SC**: 0.3 ml per litre of water (or 60-75 ml per acre). Spinosad is a biological insecticide with good efficacy against fruit flies and has a relatively safer profile.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5 EC**: 0.5 ml per litre of water (or 100-125 ml per acre).

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always observe the recommended pre-harvest interval (PHI) for any chemical applied to ensure the safety of the produce. This information is usually provided on the product label.
*   **Safety Precautions:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) like gloves, masks, and protective clothing while handling and applying pesticides. Follow all instructions on the product label carefully.
*   **Rotation of Chemicals:** To prevent the development of pesticide resistance, rotate the use of insecticides with different modes of action.
*   **Consult Local Experts:** For specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions, it is always advisable to consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts.

By implementing these strategies, you can effectively manage fruit fly populations in your Drum Stick cultivation.
