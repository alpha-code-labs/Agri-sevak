Control of soil pests like termites and nematodes (root-knot) in Drum Stick (Moringa oleifera) is crucial for healthy plant growth and yield. Here's a scientifically verified approach for Haryana conditions:

**1. Termites (Odontotermes spp., Microtermes spp.)**

Termites can cause significant damage by attacking the roots and collar region of Drum Stick plants, leading to wilting, stunted growth, and eventually plant death.

*   **Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
    *   Regularly remove dead wood, crop residues, and other organic debris from the field, as these can serve as food sources for termites.
    *   Ensure proper drainage to avoid waterlogging, which can stress plants and make them more susceptible.
    *   Deep ploughing before planting can expose termite colonies to predators and sunlight.

*   **Chemical Control (for established infestations, CIBRC approved):**
    *   **For Drenching/Soil Application:**
        *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: Apply 2.5 ml/L of water and drench around the base of the affected plants (500 ml to 1 L solution per plant depending on size) or apply 4 L per acre mixed with irrigation water.
        *   **Fipronil** 0.3% GR: Apply 10-15 kg/acre by broadcasting and light incorporation into the soil, especially around the root zone of plants.

**2. Nematodes (Root-knot nematodes - Meloidogyne spp.)**

Root-knot nematodes cause characteristic galls or knots on the roots, impairing nutrient and water uptake. This leads to stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, reduced vigor, and significant yield loss.

*   **Cultural and Biological Control:**
    *   **Soil Solarization:** Before planting, cover the soil with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks during hot summer months to raise soil temperature and kill nematodes.
    *   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost at 10-15 tonnes/acre.
    *   **Neem Cake:** Apply **Neem Cake** at 200-400 kg/acre (or 200-500 g per plant for established trees) and mix it into the soil around the root zone. Neem cake releases compounds that are toxic to nematodes and also promotes beneficial soil microbes.
    *   **Bio-nematicides:**
        *   **Paecilomyces lilacinus** (or **Purpureocillium lilacinum**) or **Trichoderma harzianum**: Apply these bio-agents at 2-4 kg/acre (mixed with 100 kg FYM/compost) at the time of planting or as a soil drench for established plants. These fungi parasitize nematode eggs and juveniles.

*   **Chemical Control (for severe infestations, use judiciously and as per CIBRC approval):**
    *   **Carbofuran** 3% CG: Apply 10-15 kg/acre by broadcasting and light incorporation into the soil around the root zone, followed by light irrigation. This should be done carefully, adhering to safety guidelines and pre-harvest intervals.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and strictly follow the label instructions of any pesticide for correct dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   An Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods, is recommended for sustainable and effective control.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension specialists at HAU for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and the current pest pressure.
