As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, here are the recommended cultivation practices for Drum Stick (Moringa oleifera) in Haryana:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   Drum Stick can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings. For commercial cultivation, seed propagation is most common.
    *   **Direct Sowing:** Seeds are typically sown directly in the main field. This method avoids transplant shock and is generally preferred.
    *   **Nursery Raising and Transplanting:** Seeds can also be sown in polybags or nursery beds and transplanted after 30-45 days when seedlings are 15-20 cm tall. This is useful for better stand establishment or when field conditions are not optimal for direct sowing.
    *   **Pattern:** Sowing is done in rows.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   Seeds should be sown at a depth of **1.0 - 2.0 cm**. Deeper sowing can hinder germination.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   Spacing depends on the variety and the primary purpose of cultivation (pods, leaves, or seeds).
    *   **For Annual Varieties (e.g., PKM-1, PKM-2, ODC-3) grown for Pods/Leaves:**
        *   Row to Row: **2.0 - 2.5 meters**
        *   Plant to Plant: **1.5 - 2.0 meters**
    *   **For High-Density Planting (primarily for leaf production):**
        *   Row to Row: **1.0 - 1.5 meters**
        *   Plant to Plant: **0.5 - 1.0 meter** (followed by regular pruning)

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   The seed rate varies with spacing and germination percentage.
    *   **For Annual Varieties (e.g., PKM-1, PKM-2, ODC-3) with typical spacing:**
        *   Approximately **500 - 750 grams per acre**.
    *   **For High-Density Planting:**
        *   Approximately **1.0 - 1.5 kg per acre**.
    *   It is advisable to use seeds from a reliable source with high germination vigor. Seed treatment with fungicides (e.g., **Carbendazim** or **Thiram**) can improve germination and protect against early seedling diseases, though this was not explicitly asked for.
