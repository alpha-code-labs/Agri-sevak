Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I strongly recommend conducting a soil test before applying any fertilizers. Soil testing provides precise information about your field's nutrient status, allowing for tailored and efficient fertilizer application, which is crucial for optimal yield and soil health.

Based on general recommendations for Drum Stick (Moringa oleifera) cultivation in Haryana, and assuming average soil fertility, here are the recommended doses for various fertilizers:

**General Nutrient Requirement (per acre per year for established plants):**
*   **Nitrogen (N):** 45-60 kg
*   **Phosphorus (P2O5):** 15-20 kg
*   **Potassium (K2O):** 15-20 kg
*   **Sulphur (S):** 10-15 kg

**Specific Fertilizer Recommendations and Doses:**

1.  **Urea (46% N):**
    *   **Dose:** 100-130 kg per acre per year.
    *   **Application:** Split into 2-3 equal doses.
        *   **First Dose:** 1/3rd at the time of planting or after pruning (basal application).
        *   **Subsequent Doses:** Remaining 2/3rd applied as top-dressing at 2-3 month intervals, especially during active growth and flowering/fruiting stages. Apply around the plant base and lightly incorporate into the soil, followed by irrigation.

2.  **Nano-Urea (Liquid):**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Application:** Foliar spray.
        *   **Timing:** 2-3 sprays during the crop cycle.
            *   **First Spray:** During active vegetative growth (30-45 days after planting/pruning).
            *   **Second Spray:** Before flowering.
            *   **Third Spray (Optional):** During fruit development, if needed.
        *   **Note:** Nano-Urea is a supplement and does not entirely replace granular Urea, especially for basal requirements.

3.  **Di-Ammonium Phosphate (DAP) (18% N, 46% P2O5):**
    *   **Dose:** 35-45 kg per acre per year.
    *   **Application:**
        *   **Basal Dose:** Apply the entire quantity at the time of planting or after pruning. Incorporate well into the soil. This will also provide a portion of the nitrogen requirement.

4.  **Nano-DAP (Liquid):**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Application:** Foliar spray.
        *   **Timing:** 2-3 sprays during the crop cycle.
            *   **First Spray:** During early vegetative growth.
            *   **Second Spray:** Before flowering.
            *   **Third Spray (Optional):** During fruit development.
        *   **Note:** Similar to Nano-Urea, Nano-DAP is a supplementary foliar feed.

5.  **NPK (Complex Fertilizers, e.g., 12:32:16, 10:26:26):**
    *   **Dose:** If using NPK complex fertilizers as a basal dose, the quantity will vary based on the specific grade and the target NPK requirement. For example, to meet the P and K requirements, you might use 100-120 kg of NPK 12:32:16 per acre as a basal dose.
    *   **Application:**
        *   **Basal Dose:** Apply the entire quantity at the time of planting or after pruning, incorporating it into the soil. Adjust subsequent Urea and Potash applications accordingly.

6.  **Single Super Phosphate (SSP) (16% P2O5, 11% S):**
    *   **Dose:** 100-125 kg per acre per year.
    *   **Application:**
        *   **Basal Dose:** Apply the entire quantity at the time of planting or after pruning. Incorporate well into the soil. SSP is an excellent source of both Phosphorus and Sulphur.

7.  **Potash (Muriate of Potash - MOP, 60% K2O or Sulphate of Potash - SOP, 50% K2O):**
    *   **Dose:** 30-40 kg per acre per year (if using MOP).
    *   **Application:**
        *   **First Dose:** 1/2 at the time of planting or after pruning (basal application).
        *   **Second Dose:** Remaining 1/2 as top-dressing during flowering/fruiting stage.

8.  **Sulphur (Elemental Sulphur 90% or Bentonite Sulphur):**
    *   **Dose:** 10-15 kg per acre per year (if not adequately supplied by SSP).
    *   **Application:**
        *   **Basal Dose:** Apply the entire quantity at the time of planting or after pruning.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Soil Testing:** Reiterate that these are general guidelines. A soil test report is the most accurate basis for fertilizer application.
*   **Organic Manure:** Supplement chemical fertilizers with 5-10 tonnes of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost per acre annually. This improves soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability.
*   **Irrigation:** Ensure adequate moisture in the soil after fertilizer application, especially for granular fertilizers, to facilitate nutrient uptake.
*   **Plant Age and Yield:** Adjust doses based on the age of the plants and expected yield. Younger plants require less, while mature, high-yielding plants may need slightly more.
