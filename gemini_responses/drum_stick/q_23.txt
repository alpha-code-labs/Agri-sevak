As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified seed and soil treatment processes for Drum Stick (Moringa oleifera) to ensure healthy plant establishment and growth in Haryana conditions:

### Recommended Seed Treatment Process for Drum Stick

Seed treatment is crucial for protecting seeds and young seedlings from seed-borne and early soil-borne diseases and pests, ensuring better germination and stand establishment.

1.  **Fungicidal Seed Treatment:**
    *   To protect against common fungal diseases like damping-off, seed rot, and early blight.
    *   Apply **Carbendazim 12% + Mancozeb 63% WP** at a rate of 2.5 grams per kilogram of seed.
    *   *Method:* Mix the required quantity of fungicide with a small amount of water to make a slurry. Coat the seeds uniformly with this slurry and allow them to dry in the shade before sowing.

2.  **Insecticidal Seed Treatment:**
    *   To protect young seedlings from early sucking pests (e.g., aphids, jassids) and soil-borne insects.
    *   Apply **Imidacloprid 70% WS** at a rate of 5 grams per kilogram of seed.
    *   *Method:* Apply this after the fungicidal treatment (if using both chemical treatments). Mix the insecticide with a small amount of water to form a slurry, coat the seeds evenly, and dry them in the shade.

3.  **Bio-fungicidal Seed Treatment (Optional, but Recommended for Enhanced Protection):**
    *   To provide additional protection against soil-borne fungal pathogens and promote early root development.
    *   Apply **Trichoderma viride 1% WP** at a rate of 10 grams per kilogram of seed.
    *   *Method:* This should ideally be applied after the chemical treatments and drying. Mix the bio-fungicide with a small amount of water and coat the seeds. Sow the seeds immediately after this treatment or dry them in the shade.

### Recommended Soil Treatment Process for Drum Stick

Soil treatment focuses on improving soil health, nutrient availability, and managing soil-borne diseases and nematodes, providing a conducive environment for Drum Stick growth.

1.  **Organic Matter Enrichment:**
    *   Incorporate well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost at a rate of 10-15 tonnes per acre into the soil 2-3 weeks before planting. This improves soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability.

2.  **Bio-fertilizer Application:**
    *   To enhance nutrient cycling and availability in the soil. These should be mixed with FYM/compost and broadcasted evenly before planting.
    *   **Azotobacter chroococcum (liquid/powder formulation)**: 2-4 Litres or 4-8 kilograms per acre. (For atmospheric nitrogen fixation).
    *   **Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria (PSB) (liquid/powder formulation)**: 2-4 Litres or 4-8 kilograms per acre. (To make soil phosphorus available to plants).
    *   **Potash Mobilizing Bacteria (KMB) (liquid/powder formulation)**: 2-4 Litres or 4-8 kilograms per acre. (To mobilize soil potassium).
    *   *Method:* Mix the recommended quantities of each bio-fertilizer with 100-200 kg of well-decomposed FYM or compost. Broadcast this mixture evenly over the field and incorporate it into the topsoil before planting.

3.  **Bio-pesticide Application (for Soil-borne Diseases and Nematodes):**
    *   To manage soil-borne fungal diseases (like wilt, root rot) and root-knot nematodes, which can be problematic in Drum Stick.
    *   **Trichoderma viride 1% WP**: 2-4 kilograms per acre. (For fungal disease suppression).
    *   **Purpureocillium lilacinum 1% WP**: 2-4 kilograms per acre. (Specifically effective against root-knot nematodes).
    *   *Method:* Mix the recommended quantities of **Trichoderma viride** and **Purpureocillium lilacinum** with 100-200 kg of well-decomposed FYM or compost. Broadcast this mixture evenly over the field and incorporate it into the topsoil at the time of final land preparation, preferably 7-10 days before planting.
