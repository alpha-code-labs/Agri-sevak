Namaste! The dropping of flowers and immature fruits (pods) in Drum Stick (Moringa oleifera) is a common concern for farmers. While the term "Tinda/Boll dropping" is not typically used for Drum Stick, if it refers to the dropping of immature pods, the following advice for flower and fruit drop is applicable.

Flower and fruit drop in Drum Stick can be attributed to a combination of physiological, environmental, and nutritional factors. It's important to understand that a certain percentage of flower drop is natural, as the plant produces an abundance of flowers, but excessive drop can significantly reduce yield.

**Common Causes of Dropping:**

1.  **Physiological Factors:** High natural abortion rate of flowers (often over 90%).
2.  **Environmental Stress:**
    *   High temperatures (especially during flowering and fruit set).
    *   Water stress (both deficit and excess moisture).
    *   High humidity or heavy rainfall during flowering (affecting pollination).
    *   Strong winds.
3.  **Nutritional Deficiencies:** Lack of essential micronutrients like Boron and Zinc.
4.  **Hormonal Imbalance:** Imbalance of plant growth regulators within the plant.

**Control Measures for Dropping in Drum Stick:**

A comprehensive approach involving good agronomic practices and targeted nutritional/hormonal interventions is recommended.

**I. Agronomic and Cultural Practices:**

*   **Optimal Water Management:** Ensure consistent and adequate moisture, especially during flowering and fruit development. Avoid both waterlogging and severe drought stress. Drip irrigation can be highly effective.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Conduct a soil test to determine nutrient status. Apply balanced fertilizers based on recommendations. Ensure adequate supply of macro and micronutrients.
*   **Weed Control:** Keep the area around Drum Stick plants free of weeds to reduce competition for water and nutrients.
*   **Pruning:** Light pruning can help manage the canopy, improve air circulation, and direct plant energy towards reproductive growth.
*   **Pest and Disease Management:** While not a direct cause of dropping, severe pest infestations or diseases can weaken the plant, making it more susceptible to dropping. Implement integrated pest and disease management strategies.

**II. Nutritional and Hormonal Management (Foliar Application):**

Foliar sprays can quickly address specific nutrient deficiencies and hormonal imbalances.

*   **Boron Application:** Boron is crucial for pollen viability, pollen tube growth, and fruit set.
    *   Spray **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (a soluble boron source) at 1-2 g/L of water, or **Boric acid** at 1-1.5 g/L of water.
    *   Apply at the pre-flowering stage and again at the early fruit set stage.
*   **Zinc Application:** Zinc is essential for auxin synthesis and overall plant metabolism, impacting flower and fruit development.
    *   Spray **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** at 2-5 g/L of water, or **Zinc EDTA** at 0.5-1 g/L of water.
    *   Apply during vegetative growth and repeat at the pre-flowering stage.
*   **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA) Application:** NAA is a synthetic auxin that can help reduce flower and fruit drop by delaying the formation of the abscission layer.
    *   Spray **Naphthalene Acetic Acid** (NAA) at a concentration of 10-20 ppm (parts per million). For a typical 4.5% SL formulation of NAA, this translates to approximately 0.2-0.4 ml/L of water.
    *   Apply the first spray at the peak flowering stage and a second spray about 15-20 days later if dropping persists.
    *   **Caution:** Do not exceed the recommended dosage, as higher concentrations can be phytotoxic or have adverse effects.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always ensure thorough coverage of the foliage during spraying.
*   Spray during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late afternoon) to maximize absorption and minimize scorching.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and soil test results.

By implementing these scientifically verified practices, you can significantly reduce flower and fruit drop in your Drum Stick plants and improve overall yield.
