As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified seed and soil treatment processes for Long Melon (Kakri) cultivation in Haryana:

### Seed Treatment Process for Long Melon

The primary objective of seed treatment is to protect the germinating seeds and young seedlings from seed-borne and early soil-borne diseases, and in some cases, early insect pests.

*   **Fungal Protection (against damping-off, root rot, etc.):**
    *   **Chemical Treatment:** Treat seeds with a fungicide like **Thiram** @ 2-3 grams per kilogram of seed, OR **Carbendazim** @ 1-2 grams per kilogram of seed. A combination of **Carbendazim** @ 1 gram + **Thiram** @ 2 grams per kilogram of seed is also highly effective.
    *   **Bio-fungicide Treatment:** For an organic approach or as an additional layer of protection, treat seeds with **Trichoderma viride** @ 4-5 grams per kilogram of seed. If using both chemical and bio-fungicide treatments, apply the chemical first, allow the seeds to dry, and then apply the bio-fungicide.
*   **Insect Protection (Optional, for early sucking pests like aphids, whiteflies, thrips):**
    *   **Chemical Treatment:** If early sucking pest pressure is anticipated, treat seeds with a systemic insecticide like **Imidacloprid** (FS formulation) @ 5-7 ml per kilogram of seed, OR **Thiamethoxam** (FS formulation) @ 3-5 grams per kilogram of seed.

### Soil Treatment Process for Long Melon

Soil treatment aims to improve soil health, suppress soil-borne diseases, and manage nematodes, creating a conducive environment for healthy plant growth.

*   **Pre-planting Soil Preparation and Health Enhancement:**
    *   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporate well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost @ 10-15 tonnes per acre into the soil during land preparation. This improves soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability.
    *   **Neem Cake:** Apply **Neem Cake** @ 200-400 kg per acre during land preparation. Neem cake acts as a slow-release fertilizer and possesses natural nematicidal and insecticidal properties, helping to suppress soil-borne pests and diseases.
*   **Bio-agent Application for Disease and Nematode Suppression:**
    *   **For Soil-borne Fungal Diseases (e.g., damping-off, wilt, root rot):** Apply **Trichoderma viride** @ 2-4 kg per acre. Mix the bio-agent with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed FYM or compost and broadcast evenly over the field before planting, followed by light irrigation or incorporation into the soil.
    *   **For Nematode Management (especially root-knot nematodes):** If root-knot nematodes are a known problem in your field, apply **Purpureocillium lilacinum** (formerly *Paecilomyces lilacinus*) @ 2-4 kg per acre. Mix it with 50-100 kg of FYM or compost and broadcast evenly before planting, incorporating it into the soil.
*   **Chemical Treatment (for severe soil-borne disease/nematode pressure - consult an expert):**
    *   **Fungicide (for severe damping-off, root rot history):** In cases of severe historical soil-borne fungal diseases, a targeted application might be necessary. For example, a soil drench with **Propamocarb hydrochloride** @ 2-3 ml per litre of water around the root zone at planting or early seedling stage.
    *   **Nematicide (for severe nematode infestation):** For fields with a confirmed severe nematode problem, specific granular nematicides can be considered. For instance, **Cadusafos** (10% G) @ 10-15 kg per acre or **Fosthiazate** (10% G) @ 10-15 kg per acre can be incorporated into the soil before planting.
        *   **Important Note:** The use of chemical nematicides should only be considered after proper diagnosis (e.g., soil testing for nematode population) and in consultation with an agricultural expert, due to their specific application requirements, potential environmental impact, and safety considerations. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approaches, prioritizing cultural practices and bio-agents, are always recommended.
