Here are the recommended cultivation practices for Long Melon (Kakri) in Haryana:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   Long Melon is typically direct-sown.
    *   Sowing is generally done on ridges or raised beds to ensure proper drainage and aeration, especially during the monsoon season or in areas prone to waterlogging. Furrows are then used for irrigation.
    *   Alternatively, pits can be prepared at recommended spacing, and seeds sown directly into these pits.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   Seeds should be sown at a depth of 2-3 cm. Deeper planting can hinder germination.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   For optimal growth and yield, maintain the following spacing:
        *   **Row-to-Row:** 2.0 - 2.5 meters
        *   **Plant-to-Plant:** 0.5 - 0.75 meters
    *   Sow 2-3 seeds per hill/pit and thin to one healthy seedling after establishment.

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   The recommended seed rate for Long Melon is 1.5 - 2.0 kg/acre.
