As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following fertilizer doses for Long Melon (Kakri) cultivation in Haryana. These recommendations are based on scientific research and aim for optimal yield and quality, assuming average soil fertility. However, a soil test is always recommended for precise nutrient management.

**General Nutrient Requirement per acre for Long Melon:**
*   Nitrogen (N): 80-100 kg
*   Phosphorus (P2O5): 50-60 kg
*   Potassium (K2O): 50-60 kg
*   Sulphur (S): 20 kg (if not supplied by SSP)

**Recommended Doses of Fertilizers (per acre):**

1.  **Urea (46% N):**
    *   **Total Dose:** 130-175 kg (if DAP is used for Phosphorus) OR 175-220 kg (if SSP is used for Phosphorus).
    *   **Application:** Apply in split doses:
        *   **Basal Dose (at planting):** 45-60 kg **Urea**.
        *   **First Top Dressing (3-4 weeks after planting):** 45-60 kg **Urea**.
        *   **Second Top Dressing (at flowering/early fruiting):** 40-55 kg **Urea**.

2.  **Nano-Urea (Liquid):**
    *   **Application:** Foliar spray.
        *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml/L of water.
        *   **Timing:** Apply 2-3 sprays during the crop cycle.
            *   First spray: At vegetative growth stage (3-4 weeks after planting).
            *   Second spray: At pre-flowering stage.
            *   Third spray: At fruit development stage.
    *   *Note:* Nano-Urea can supplement conventional Urea and may help reduce its requirement by 25-50% when applied effectively.

3.  **DAP (Di-ammonium Phosphate, 18% N, 46% P2O5):**
    *   **Total Dose:** 110-130 kg.
    *   **Application:** Apply the entire quantity as a **Basal Dose** at the time of field preparation/planting.
    *   *Note:* This dose provides 50-60 kg P2O5 and 20-23 kg N. Adjust Urea quantity accordingly.

4.  **Nano-DAP (Liquid):**
    *   **Application:** Foliar spray.
        *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml/L of water.
        *   **Timing:** Apply 2-3 sprays during the crop cycle.
            *   First spray: At vegetative growth stage (3-4 weeks after planting).
            *   Second spray: At pre-flowering stage.
            *   Third spray: At fruit development stage.
    *   *Note:* Nano-DAP can supplement conventional DAP and may help reduce its requirement by 25-50% when applied effectively.

5.  **NPK (Complex Fertilizers, e.g., 12:32:16 or similar ratios):**
    *   **Dose:** 150-200 kg per acre.
    *   **Application:** Apply as a **Basal Dose** at the time of field preparation/planting.
    *   *Note:* If using a complex NPK fertilizer, calculate the N, P2O5, and K2O supplied and supplement the remaining required nutrients with **Urea** and **Potash (Muriate of Potash)** as top dressings. For example, 150 kg of 12:32:16 provides 18 kg N, 48 kg P2O5, and 24 kg K2O.

6.  **SSP (Single Super Phosphate, 16% P2O5, 11% S):**
    *   **Total Dose:** 310-375 kg (if used as the primary Phosphorus source instead of DAP).
    *   **Application:** Apply the entire quantity as a **Basal Dose** at the time of field preparation/planting.
    *   *Note:* SSP also provides 34-41 kg Sulphur and 19.5% Calcium, which are beneficial for crop growth.

7.  **Potash (Muriate of Potash, 60% K2O):**
    *   **Total Dose:** 85-100 kg.
    *   **Application:** Apply the entire quantity as a **Basal Dose** at the time of field preparation/planting.

8.  **Sulphur:**
    *   If **SSP** is used, the sulphur requirement is generally met.
    *   If **DAP** is used and soil test indicates sulphur deficiency, or for general good practice:
        *   **Bentonite Sulphur (90% S):** 20-25 kg per acre.
        *   **Application:** Apply as a **Basal Dose** at the time of field preparation/planting.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Soil Testing:** Always conduct a soil test before planting to determine the exact nutrient status of your field. This allows for precise fertilizer application, preventing over- or under-fertilization.
*   **Organic Matter:** Incorporating 8-10 tonnes of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost per acre during field preparation significantly improves soil health and nutrient availability, potentially reducing chemical fertilizer requirements.
*   **Irrigation:** Ensure adequate and timely irrigation, especially after fertilizer application, to facilitate nutrient uptake by the plants.
