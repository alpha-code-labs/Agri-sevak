Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU), Hisar, I understand your concern regarding soil pests in Long Melon (Tinda/Kakri). Termites and Root-knot nematodes are significant threats that can severely impact crop health and yield. Here's a scientifically verified approach for their control:

### General Principles for Soil Pest Management:
An Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is crucial, combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods for sustainable and effective control.

### 1. Termites (Deemak)

Termites can cause significant damage by feeding on roots and the base of the stem, leading to wilting, stunted growth, and eventually plant death. This is particularly problematic in sandy soils.

**Cultural and Preventive Measures:**
*   **Deep Ploughing:** Exposes termites to predators and desiccation.
*   **Removal of Debris:** Clear crop residues, stubble, and other organic matter from the field, as these can serve as food sources and breeding sites for termites.
*   **Proper Irrigation:** Maintain adequate soil moisture, as termites prefer dry conditions.
*   **Farmyard Manure (FYM):** Ensure FYM is well-decomposed before application, as undecomposed organic matter can attract termites.

**Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved):**
For effective control, chemical application can be done as a pre-plant treatment or as a drench around the plant base.

*   **Pre-plant Soil Treatment/Incorporation:**
    *   **Chlorpyrifos** 10% G: Apply 10-15 kg/acre and incorporate into the soil before sowing/planting.
    *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: Mix 2.5 L/acre in 400-500 L of water and drench the soil thoroughly before sowing/planting.
    *   **Fipronil** 0.3% G: Apply 10-15 kg/acre and incorporate into the soil before sowing/planting.

*   **Post-planting Drench (if infestation is observed):**
    *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: Mix 2.5 ml/L of water and drench around the base of the affected plants.

### 2. Nematodes (Root-knot Nematodes - Meloidogyne spp.)

Root-knot nematodes are microscopic worms that infect plant roots, causing characteristic galls or knots. These galls impair the plant's ability to absorb water and nutrients, leading to stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, reduced yield, and increased susceptibility to other diseases. Long Melon is highly susceptible to root-knot nematodes.

**Cultural and Preventive Measures:**
*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate Long Melon with non-host crops like cereals (wheat, maize, sorghum) or marigold (Tagetes spp.) for at least 2-3 years. Marigold roots release compounds that are toxic to nematodes.
*   **Summer Solarization:** Cover the moist field with transparent polyethylene sheets during hot summer months (May-June) for 4-6 weeks. This raises soil temperature, killing nematodes and other soil-borne pathogens.
*   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporate well-decomposed Farmyard Manure (FYM) at 10-15 tonnes/acre or **Neem cake** at 200-400 kg/acre into the soil during field preparation. Neem cake has nematicidal properties.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** If available, choose nematode-resistant Long Melon varieties.

**Biological Control:**
*   **Bio-nematicides:** Apply beneficial fungi like *Paecilomyces lilacinus* or *Purpureocillium lilacinum* (e.g., 2-4 kg/acre) mixed with FYM or compost and incorporate into the soil before planting or drench around the root zone. These fungi parasitize nematode eggs and juveniles.

**Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved):**
Chemical nematicides should be used judiciously, preferably as a pre-plant or at-sowing application.

*   **At Sowing/Planting (Soil Application):**
    *   **Carbofuran** 3% G: Apply 10-15 kg/acre in furrows at the time of sowing or transplanting and mix with the soil.
    *   **Fluensulfone** 2% GR: Apply 20-25 kg/acre at the time of sowing or transplanting and incorporate into the soil.
    *   **Fipronil** 0.3% G: Apply 10-15 kg/acre at the time of sowing or transplanting and incorporate into the soil. This can offer some suppression against nematodes in addition to insect control.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the chemical product label carefully, including dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions.

By adopting these integrated strategies, you can effectively manage soil pests in your Long Melon crop and ensure a healthy and productive harvest.
