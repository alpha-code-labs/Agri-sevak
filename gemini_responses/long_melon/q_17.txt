As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following doses of organic manures and bio-stimulants for Long Melon cultivation, based on scientific principles and suitability for Haryana's agro-climatic conditions:

Organic manures are crucial for improving soil health, enhancing water retention, providing essential nutrients, and fostering beneficial microbial activity, all of which contribute to robust plant growth and higher yields in Long Melon.

*   **Farmyard Manure (FYM):**
    *   Apply 15-20 tonnes per acre.
    *   It should be well-decomposed (at least 3-4 months old) to avoid nutrient immobilization and pest issues.
    *   Incorporate it thoroughly into the soil during land preparation, approximately 2-3 weeks before sowing or transplanting.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   Apply 4-5 tonnes per acre.
    *   Vermicompost is richer in nutrients and microbial activity than FYM.
    *   It can be incorporated into the soil during land preparation, or applied in planting pits/rows at the time of sowing/transplanting. It can also be used as a top-dressing during early vegetative growth.

*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract based Bio-stimulant):**
    *   Sagarika is a bio-stimulant derived from seaweed (*Ascophyllum nodosum*) and is not a bulk organic manure like FYM or vermicompost. It enhances nutrient uptake, promotes root development, improves stress tolerance, and boosts overall plant vigour and fruit quality.
    *   **Foliar Spray:**
        *   Mix 2.5 - 3.0 ml of Sagarika per litre of water.
        *   Apply as a foliar spray at critical growth stages:
            *   First spray: 20-25 days after sowing/transplanting (early vegetative stage).
            *   Second spray: At flowering initiation.
            *   Third spray: At fruit setting stage.
    *   **Soil Drench/Drip Application:**
        *   Apply 1.0 - 1.5 litres per acre, mixed with irrigation water.
        *   Apply during early vegetative growth and pre-flowering stages to stimulate root growth and nutrient absorption.
