Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I understand the importance of balanced nutrition for optimal yield and quality in Long Melon (Kakri). Micronutrient deficiencies can significantly impact your crop. The first and most crucial step is always a soil test to accurately diagnose the specific deficiencies in your field. Based on the soil test results and visual symptoms, you can apply the following scientifically verified recommendations:

**General Recommendations:**
*   **Soil Testing:** Conduct a comprehensive soil test to identify specific micronutrient deficiencies and their levels. This will guide precise application.
*   **Foliar Application:** For quick correction of deficiencies, foliar sprays are highly effective as nutrients are absorbed directly by the leaves. Apply sprays preferably in the morning or late afternoon to avoid scorching and maximize absorption.
*   **Soil Application:** For long-term correction and maintenance, soil application can be done, especially for less mobile nutrients.

Here's how to address specific micronutrient deficiencies in Long Melon:

### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, small and narrow leaves (little leaf symptom), interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, sometimes bronzing.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray 0.2-0.5% solution of **Zinc Sulphate heptahydrate** (2-5 g/L of water) or 0.1-0.3% solution of **Zinc Sulphate monohydrate** (1-3 g/L of water).
        *   Alternatively, use **Zinc-EDTA** at 0.5-1 g/L of water.
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, starting when symptoms appear or as a preventive measure during active growth.
    *   **Soil Application (Basal):**
        *   Apply 10-25 kg/acre of **Zinc Sulphate heptahydrate** or 5-10 kg/acre of **Zinc Sulphate monohydrate** at the time of sowing or transplanting.

### 2. Iron (Fe) / Ferrous Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Prominent interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins, while veins remain green) on the youngest leaves, leading to overall yellowing in severe cases.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray 0.5-1% solution of **Ferrous Sulphate** (5-10 g/L of water).
        *   Alternatively, use **Fe-EDTA** at 0.5-1 g/L of water, especially effective in alkaline soils.
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 7-10 day intervals until symptoms disappear.
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   In severe cases, apply 2-5 kg/acre of **Fe-EDTA** or 20-50 kg/acre of **Ferrous Sulphate** (less effective in high pH soils).

### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, death of growing points (terminal buds), cracking of stems and fruits, poor fruit set, malformed or hollow fruits.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray 0.1-0.2% solution of **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate) (1-2 g/L of water).
        *   Alternatively, use **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (Solubor) at 0.5-1 g/L of water.
        *   Apply 1-2 sprays during flowering and fruit development stages.
    *   **Soil Application (Basal):**
        *   Apply 4-8 kg/acre of **Borax** at the time of sowing or transplanting, based on soil test recommendations.

### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Death of growing points (terminal buds), stunted root growth, marginal necrosis (browning) of young leaves, sometimes blossom end rot in fruits (though less common in Long Melon than other cucurbits).
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray 0.5-1% solution of **Calcium Nitrate** (5-10 g/L of water) or **Calcium Chloride** (5-10 g/L of water).
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, especially during fruit development.
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   Apply **Gypsum** (Calcium Sulphate) at 200-400 kg/acre or **Calcium Nitrate** at 25-50 kg/acre as a basal application or through fertigation, based on soil test.

### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins, while veins remain green) on older leaves, starting from the leaf margins and progressing inwards. In severe cases, leaves may turn reddish-purple.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray 0.5-1% solution of **Magnesium Sulphate** (Epsom salt) (5-10 g/L of water).
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals until symptoms subside.
    *   **Soil Application (Basal):**
        *   Apply 10-25 kg/acre of **Magnesium Sulphate** at the time of sowing or transplanting.

### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, often appearing as a mottled or speckled pattern, sometimes with small necrotic spots. Symptoms can be similar to iron deficiency but often more diffuse.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray 0.2-0.5% solution of **Manganese Sulphate** (2-5 g/L of water).
        *   Alternatively, use **Mn-EDTA** at 0.5-1 g/L of water.
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals.
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   Apply 10-20 kg/acre of **Manganese Sulphate** as a basal application, though foliar application is often more effective in alkaline soils.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always use clean water for spraying.
*   Add a good quality non-ionic spreader/sticker to foliar sprays for better absorption.
*   Avoid spraying during hot midday sun.
*   Do not mix different micronutrient fertilizers without checking compatibility.
*   Integrated Nutrient Management (INM) practices, including the use of farmyard manure (FYM) and compost, can improve soil health and micronutrient availability over time.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively manage micronutrient deficiencies in your Long Melon crop and ensure healthy growth and good yields.
