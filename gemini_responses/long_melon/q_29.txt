Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU), Hisar, I understand your concern regarding flower and fruit dropping in Long Melon. This is a common physiological issue, not typically caused by a single disease or pest, but rather a combination of environmental, nutritional, and cultural factors. Addressing these factors through an integrated approach is key to successful control.

Here's how to control dropping in Long Melon:

### 1. Environmental and Cultural Management:

*   **Optimal Irrigation:** Both water stress (drought) and waterlogging can lead to flower and fruit drop. Maintain consistent soil moisture, especially during flowering and fruiting.
    *   Provide light and frequent irrigation during peak flowering and fruit development.
    *   Ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging.
*   **Temperature Management:** Extreme temperatures (very high or very low) can negatively impact pollen viability and fruit set.
    *   Ensure planting is done at the optimal time for your region in Haryana to avoid extreme weather during critical stages.
    *   Consider mulching to regulate soil temperature and conserve moisture.
*   **Weed Control:** Keep the field free of weeds to reduce competition for water, nutrients, and sunlight.
*   **Plant Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to allow for good air circulation and light penetration, reducing stress.

### 2. Nutritional Management:

Nutrient deficiencies, particularly micronutrients, are a major cause of flower and fruit drop. A soil test is highly recommended to determine specific deficiencies.

*   **Boron Deficiency:** Boron is crucial for pollen germination and fruit set.
    *   Foliar spray of **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (e.g., Solubor) at 1.0-1.5 g/L of water, applied at pre-flowering and early fruit set stages.
*   **Calcium Deficiency:** Calcium is vital for cell wall development and fruit integrity.
    *   Foliar spray of **Calcium Nitrate** at 3-5 g/L of water, especially during fruit development.
*   **Balanced Fertilization:** Ensure the plant receives a balanced supply of NPK and other micronutrients based on soil test recommendations. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can promote vegetative growth at the expense of reproductive growth.

### 3. Pollination Management:

Poor pollination is a significant cause of flower and fruit drop.

*   **Encourage Pollinators:** Bees are the primary pollinators for Long Melon.
    *   Avoid spraying insecticides during the flowering period, especially in the morning when bees are most active.
    *   Consider placing bee hives near the field if natural pollinator activity is low.
*   **Hand Pollination:** In cases of very low natural pollination, hand pollination can be done by transferring pollen from male flowers to female flowers (which have a small fruit swelling at their base) in the early morning.

### 4. Hormonal Management:

Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs) can help in reducing flower and fruit drop by balancing plant hormones.

*   **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA):** This auxin helps in preventing abscission (dropping) of flowers and young fruits.
    *   Foliar spray of **Naphthalene Acetic Acid** (NAA) at 10-20 ppm (parts per million). For a 4.5% SL formulation, this typically translates to 0.2-0.4 ml/L of water. Apply at the early flowering stage and repeat after 10-15 days if needed. Always follow manufacturer's instructions for specific product concentrations.

By implementing these scientifically verified practices, you can significantly reduce flower and fruit dropping in your Long Melon crop and ensure a healthier yield. Regular observation of your plants will help you identify and address issues promptly.
