Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I advise you on the integrated management of sucking pests in Long Melon (Kakri). Effective control relies on a combination of cultural, mechanical, biological, and judicious chemical methods.

**Regarding Psylla:**
This is not known to affect Long Melon.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips in Long Melon:**

1.  **Regular Monitoring:**
    *   Scout your fields regularly (at least twice a week), especially the undersides of leaves and tender shoots, to detect pest infestations early.
    *   Look for symptoms like curling leaves, stunted growth, honeydew secretion, sooty mould, and direct presence of pests.

2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy crop residues and weeds from around the field, as they can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
    *   **Balanced Nutrition:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which promotes lush, tender growth that is highly attractive to sucking pests. Use balanced NPK fertilizers based on soil test recommendations.
    *   **Proper Irrigation:** Ensure adequate and timely irrigation to maintain plant vigour, making them less susceptible to pest damage.
    *   **Resistant Varieties:** If available and suitable for your region, consider using varieties with known resistance or tolerance to these pests.

3.  **Physical and Mechanical Methods:**
    *   **Yellow Sticky Traps:** Install yellow sticky traps (10-15 traps per acre) at canopy height to monitor and trap adult whiteflies, leafhoppers, and thrips. This helps in early detection and reduces pest populations.
    *   **Reflective Mulches:** Using silver-colored plastic mulches in the early stages of crop growth can deter aphids and whiteflies by reflecting light.

4.  **Biological Control:**
    *   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Protect and encourage natural predators like ladybird beetles, lacewings, and syrphid fly larvae, which feed on aphids and other soft-bodied insects. Parasitoids like *Encarsia formosa* can be effective against whiteflies. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.
    *   **Neem-based Formulations:** Spraying neem oil (Azadirachtin 1500 ppm or 3000 ppm) at 5 ml/L of water can act as a repellent, antifeedant, and growth disruptor, especially in early stages of infestation.

5.  **Chemical Control (As a last resort and based on economic threshold levels):**
    When pest populations exceed economic threshold levels, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves.

    Here are some CIBRC-approved technical chemical options for sucking pests in Long Melon:

    *   **For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips:**
        *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at 0.5 - 1 ml/L of water (or 100 - 125 ml/acre).
        *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at 0.2 - 0.4 g/L of water (or 80 - 100 g/acre).
        *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply at 0.2 - 0.4 g/L of water (or 80 - 100 g/acre).

    *   **Primarily for Whiteflies (especially nymphs) and some effect on Thrips:**
        *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at 1.25 - 1.5 ml/L of water (or 500 - 600 ml/acre). This is an Insect Growth Regulator (IGR) and is effective against nymphs.
        *   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** Apply at 0.5 - 0.75 ml/L of water (or 200 - 300 ml/acre). Effective against whitefly nymphs and eggs, and also controls mites.
        *   **Diafenthiuron 50% WP:** Apply at 1.2 g/L of water (or 480 - 600 g/acre). Effective against whiteflies and thrips.

    *   **Primarily for Thrips:**
        *   **Spinosad 45% SC:** Apply at 0.25 - 0.3 ml/L of water (or 100 - 120 ml/acre). This is a naturalyte insecticide with a unique mode of action, very effective against thrips.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Rotation:** Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pest resistance. For example, do not use Imidacloprid and Thiamethoxam consecutively as they belong to the same chemical group (neonicotinoids).
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always observe the recommended pre-harvest interval (PHI) mentioned on the product label to ensure the safety of the produce.
*   **Safety:** Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying. Follow all safety instructions on the product label.
*   **Water Quality:** Use clean water for spraying. Adjust pH if necessary, as some insecticides degrade in alkaline water.
