Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing these pests in Long Melon (Snake Gourd) in Haryana.

It's important to adopt an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, mechanical, biological, and judicious chemical methods for sustainable control.

Here's how to address the pests you've mentioned:

### Diamondback Moth

*   This is not known to affect Long Melon. Diamondback moth (*Plutella xylostella*) is a specific pest of cruciferous crops (like cabbage, cauliflower, mustard) and does not infest cucurbits such as Long Melon.

### Borers, Caterpillars, and Leaf folder

These pests are primarily lepidopteran larvae (caterpillars) that can cause damage by boring into fruits, feeding on leaves, or folding leaves. The most common borer and leaf feeder in cucurbits is the Cucurbit Fruit Borer (*Diaphania indica* / *Spoladea indica*), which is a caterpillar. Other general leaf-eating caterpillars may also be present.

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy all infested fruits, leaves, and plant debris. This helps break the pest life cycle.
*   **Hand Picking:** In early stages of infestation, hand-pick and destroy visible caterpillars and folded leaves containing larvae.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting cucurbits continuously in the same field.
*   **Timely Sowing:** Adjust planting dates to avoid peak pest periods if known for your specific area.
*   **Support and Trellising:** Growing Long Melon on trellises can improve air circulation and make pest detection easier.

**2. Biological Control:**
*   **Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt):** Apply formulations of *Bacillus thuringiensis* var. *kurstaki* (Bt) which is a biological insecticide effective against young caterpillars.
    *   **Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) (e.g., 8-15% WP):** 1-2 kg/acre (or 5-10 g/L of water). Apply in the evening for best results.

**3. Chemical Control (Use only when necessary and rotate chemicals to prevent resistance):**
For effective control of borers, caterpillars, and leaf folders, consider the following CIBRC approved insecticides. Always ensure thorough coverage of the plant, especially the undersides of leaves and developing fruits.

*   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** 60 ml/acre (or 0.3 ml/L of water).
*   **Flubendiamide 20% WG:** 50 g/acre (or 0.25 g/L of water).
*   **Emamectin Benzoate 5% SG:** 80-100 g/acre (or 0.4-0.5 g/L of water).
*   **Spinosad 45% SC:** 60-75 ml/acre (or 0.3-0.375 ml/L of water).
*   **Cyantraniliprole 10.26% OD:** 180 ml/acre (or 0.9 ml/L of water).

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Water Volume:** Ensure adequate water volume (typically 200 litres per acre for field crops) for proper spray coverage.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Strictly observe the pre-harvest interval mentioned on the insecticide label to ensure the produce is safe for consumption.
*   **Rotation:** Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.
*   **Local Advice:** Consult with your local agricultural extension officer or KVK (Krishi Vigyan Kendra) for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and current pest pressure.

By implementing these strategies, you can effectively manage borers, caterpillars, and leaf folders in your Long Melon crop.
