As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Long Melon (Kakri) in Haryana. It is crucial to integrate cultural practices with judicious chemical application for effective and sustainable disease management.

### General Principles for Fungal Disease Management:

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting cucurbits in the same field for at least 2-3 years.
    *   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris. Keep the field free of weeds.
    *   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available, choose varieties known to have resistance or tolerance to common diseases.
    *   **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing for good air circulation, which reduces humidity and fungal growth.
    *   **Water Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day, to minimize leaf wetness. Drip irrigation is preferred.
    *   **Nutrition:** Maintain balanced plant nutrition to enhance plant vigor and natural resistance.

2.  **Chemical Application:**
    *   Always use CIBRC (Central Insecticides Board & Registration Committee) approved chemicals.
    *   Follow label instructions carefully for dosage, timing, and safety precautions.
    *   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
    *   Apply fungicides preventively, especially during periods conducive to disease development (e.g., high humidity, rainfall).

### Control Measures for Specific Fungal Diseases in Long Melon:

#### 1. Alternaria Leaf Spot (Caused by *Alternaria cucumerina*)

*   **Symptoms:** Small, circular, water-soaked spots that enlarge, become angular, and turn brown with concentric rings (target spot) on leaves. Severe infection can lead to defoliation.
*   **Control:**
    *   **Cultural:** Practice crop rotation, remove infected plant debris, and ensure proper plant spacing.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP: 2.5 g/L of water
        *   **Chlorothalonil** 75% WP: 2 g/L of water
        *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC: 0.5-1 ml/L of water
        *   **Difenoconazole** 25% EC: 0.5 ml/L of water

#### 2. Anthracnose (Caused by *Colletotrichum orbiculare*)

*   **Symptoms:** Circular, water-soaked spots on leaves that turn black/brown and may fall out, giving a "shot-hole" appearance. Elongated, sunken lesions on stems and petioles. Sunken, dark lesions on fruit, often with pinkish spore masses in humid conditions.
*   **Control:**
    *   **Cultural:** Use disease-free seeds, practice crop rotation, remove infected plant material, and avoid overhead irrigation.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP: 2.5 g/L of water
        *   **Chlorothalonil** 75% WP: 2 g/L of water
        *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: 0.5-1 g/L of water
        *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC: 0.5-1 ml/L of water
        *   **Tebuconazole** 25% WG: 0.75-1 g/L of water

#### 3. Blast

*   This is not known to affect Long Melon. Blast disease primarily affects cereals like rice and wheat.

#### 4. Blight (General Fungal Blight)

*   **Symptoms:** General term for rapid and extensive browning, wilting, and death of plant tissues. In cucurbits, various fungi can cause blight-like symptoms on leaves, stems, and fruits.
*   **Control:**
    *   **Cultural:** Improve air circulation, manage irrigation to reduce leaf wetness, and remove severely infected plants.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP: 2.5 g/L of water
        *   **Chlorothalonil** 75% WP: 2 g/L of water
        *   **Propineb** 70% WP: 2.5 g/L of water

#### 5. Brown Spot

*   This is not a specific disease name for Long Melon. Symptoms described as "brown spot" are often indicative of other leaf spot diseases like Alternaria or Anthracnose. Please refer to the control measures for those specific diseases.

#### 6. Downy Mildew (Caused by *Pseudoperonospora cubensis*)

*   **Symptoms:** Angular, yellow spots on the upper leaf surface, which later turn brown. On the underside of the leaves, purplish-grey, fuzzy fungal growth can be observed, especially in humid conditions.
*   **Control:**
    *   **Cultural:** Use resistant varieties if available, ensure good air circulation, and avoid overhead irrigation.
    *   **Chemical:** (Note: Downy mildew is an oomycete, requiring specific fungicides)
        *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP: 2.5 g/L of water (as a protectant)
        *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride** 72.2% SL: 2-2.5 ml/L of water
        *   **Fenamidone + Propamocarb hydrochloride** (e.g., 10% + 37.5% SC): 2-2.5 ml/L of water
        *   **Cymoxanil + Mancozeb** (e.g., 8% + 64% WP): 2.5 g/L of water
        *   **Dimethomorph + Mancozeb** (e.g., 9% + 60% WP): 2.5 g/L of water
        *   **Fluopicolide + Propamocarb hydrochloride** (e.g., 6.25% + 62.5% SC): 2-2.5 ml/L of water

#### 7. Powdery Mildew (Caused by *Podosphaera xanthii* or *Erysiphe cichoracearum*)

*   **Symptoms:** White, powdery patches on the upper and lower surfaces of leaves, stems, and petioles. Severe infection can lead to yellowing, browning, and premature defoliation.
*   **Control:**
    *   **Cultural:** Use resistant varieties, ensure good air circulation, and remove severely infected leaves.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   **Sulphur** 80% WP: 2-3 g/L of water (avoid application during very hot weather)
        *   **Myclobutanil** 10% WP: 0.5 g/L of water
        *   **Penconazole** 10% EC: 0.5 ml/L of water
        *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC: 0.5-1 ml/L of water
        *   **Tebuconazole** 25% WG: 0.75-1 g/L of water
        *   **Difenoconazole** 25% EC: 0.5 ml/L of water

#### 8. Grey Mildew

*   This is not known to affect Long Melon as a distinct disease. Symptoms sometimes described as "grey mildew" might be a severe form of Powdery Mildew or another fungal infection. Please refer to the control measures for Powdery Mildew or other specific leaf spot diseases.
