Dear Farmer,

The symptom of "drying up" – encompassing drying branches, leaves, fruits, and flowers – in Long Melon (Kakri) is a general indication of severe stress, which can be caused by a multitude of factors, both abiotic (environmental/nutritional) and biotic (diseases/pests). A precise diagnosis is crucial for effective management.

As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend a systematic approach to identify and address the underlying cause. Here are the potential reasons and their management strategies:

### I. Abiotic Factors (Non-Infectious Causes)

These are often the primary culprits for widespread drying symptoms.

1.  **Water Stress (Deficit or Excess):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Wilting, yellowing, and eventual drying of leaves and branches. Excess water can lead to root rot, causing similar symptoms due to impaired water uptake.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Ensure optimal irrigation. Long Melon requires consistent moisture, especially during flowering and fruiting.
        *   Avoid both waterlogging and severe drought. Drip irrigation is highly recommended for efficient water use.
        *   Ensure good soil drainage to prevent root rot.

2.  **Nutrient Deficiencies:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Specific patterns of yellowing, necrosis, and drying.
        *   **Potassium (K) Deficiency:** Yellowing and scorching/drying of leaf margins, especially older leaves.
        *   **Calcium (Ca) Deficiency:** Blossom end rot on fruits (water-soaked spot at the blossom end, turning black and leathery), drying of young leaves and growing points.
        *   **Boron (B) Deficiency:** Stunted growth, thickened and brittle leaves, poor fruit set, and malformed fruits that may dry prematurely.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Conduct a soil test to determine nutrient status.
        *   Apply balanced fertilizers based on soil test recommendations.
        *   For quick correction, foliar sprays can be effective:
            *   **Potassium:** Spray **Potassium Sulphate** at 1-2% solution (10-20 g/L water).
            *   **Calcium:** Spray **Calcium Nitrate** at 0.5-1% solution (5-10 g/L water).
            *   **Boron:** Spray **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** at 0.1-0.2% solution (1-2 g/L water).

3.  **Heat Stress / Sun Scorch:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Whitening or browning of fruits exposed to direct sun, scorching of leaves, especially during hot summer months in Haryana.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Ensure adequate irrigation to help plants cope with heat.
        *   Provide mulching around the base of plants to keep soil cool and retain moisture.
        *   Consider using shade nets during peak summer if feasible for high-value crops.

4.  **Soil Salinity / Alkalinity:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, leaf tip burn, wilting even with adequate moisture, and overall poor plant vigour leading to premature drying. Common in many parts of Haryana.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Conduct soil analysis for pH and Electrical Conductivity (EC).
        *   For sodic soils, apply **Gypsum** as per soil test recommendations.
        *   Practice proper leaching with good quality water to wash down salts.
        *   Improve soil organic matter content.

### II. Biotic Factors (Infectious Causes)

These involve diseases and pests that can lead to drying symptoms.

1.  **Fungal Diseases:**
    *   **Fusarium Wilt (Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. melonis):**
        *   **Symptoms:** Yellowing and wilting of leaves, often starting on one side of the plant or a single vine, progressing to the entire plant. The vascular tissue inside the stem may show brown discoloration when cut. Eventually, the entire plant dries up.
        *   **Management:**
            *   Use resistant varieties if available.
            *   Practice long crop rotations (3-5 years) with non-cucurbit crops.
            *   Improve soil drainage.
            *   **Chemical Control:**
                *   Seed treatment: **Carbendazim** at 1-2 g/kg seed.
                *   Soil drenching at early stages: **Carbendazim** at 1 g/L water or **Thiophanate Methyl** at 1 g/L water.
    *   **Gummy Stem Blight (Didymella bryoniae):**
        *   **Symptoms:** Water-soaked lesions on stems, leaves, and fruits, often exuding an amber-coloured gummy substance on stems. Stem lesions can girdle the stem, leading to wilting and drying of the vine beyond the lesion.
        *   **Management:**
            *   Crop rotation and removal of plant debris.
            *   Ensure good air circulation.
            *   **Chemical Control:**
                *   Foliar spray: **Azoxystrobin** (0.5 ml/L) + **Difenoconazole** (0.5 ml/L) or **Mancozeb** (2.5 g/L).
    *   **Anthracnose (Colletotrichum orbiculare):**
        *   **Symptoms:** Dark, sunken lesions on leaves, stems, and fruits. Severe leaf infection can lead to defoliation and drying of affected parts.
        *   **Management:**
            *   Use disease-free seeds.
            *   Crop rotation and sanitation.
            *   **Chemical Control:**
                *   Foliar spray: **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L water or **Chlorothalonil** at 2 g/L water.
    *   **Root Rot (Pythium spp., Phytophthora spp.):**
        *   **Symptoms:** Sudden wilting, yellowing, and collapse of plants due to decay of roots and crown. Often associated with waterlogged conditions.
        *   **Management:**
            *   Ensure excellent soil drainage.
            *   Avoid over-irrigation.
            *   **Chemical Control:**
                *   Soil drenching: **Propamocarb Hydrochloride** at 2-3 ml/L water or **Metalaxyl-M** + **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L water.

2.  **Nematodes:**
    *   **Root-knot Nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.):**
        *   **Symptoms:** Galls (swellings) on roots, leading to impaired water and nutrient uptake. This results in stunted growth, yellowing, wilting during the day, and premature drying of the entire plant, mimicking nutrient deficiencies or water stress.
        *   **Management:**
            *   Crop rotation with non-host crops (e.g., cereals).
            *   Soil solarization during summer.
            *   Use of resistant varieties if available.
            *   **Chemical Control (Pre-plant or at planting):**
                *   Soil application: **Carbofuran** at 10 kg/acre or **Phorate** at 4 kg/acre. (Apply strictly as per label instructions and safety precautions).

3.  **Pests:**
    *   **Mites (Tetranychus urticae - Two-spotted spider mite):**
        *   **Symptoms:** Fine webbing on the underside of leaves, stippling (tiny yellow dots), bronzing, curling, and eventual drying and shedding of leaves. Severe infestations can cause significant defoliation and plant stress.
        *   **Management:**
            *   Regular scouting for early detection.
            *   Maintain good field hygiene.
            *   **Chemical Control:**
                *   Foliar spray: **Spiromesifen** at 0.5 ml/L water or **Fenpyroximate** at 0.5 ml/L water.
    *   **Stem Borers:**
        *   **Symptoms:** Wilting and drying of individual branches or entire vines beyond the point of boring. Frass (excrement) may be visible near the bore hole.
        *   **Management:**
            *   Remove and destroy infested plant parts.
            *   Maintain field sanitation.
            *   **Chemical Control (if detected early):**
                *   Foliar spray with systemic insecticides like **Imidacloprid** at 0.3 ml/L water or **Thiamethoxam** at 0.2 g/L water.

### General Recommendations:

*   **Integrated Pest and Disease Management (IPDM):** Combine cultural, biological, and chemical methods for sustainable control.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy all infected plant debris to reduce inoculum.
*   **Certified Seeds:** Always use certified, disease-free seeds.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Essential for managing soil-borne diseases and nematodes.

Given the complexity of "drying up" symptoms, I strongly advise you to bring a sample of the affected plant (including roots, stem, leaves, and fruits) to the Department of Plant Pathology or Horticulture at HAU, Hisar, for an accurate diagnosis. A field visit by an expert would also be highly beneficial.
