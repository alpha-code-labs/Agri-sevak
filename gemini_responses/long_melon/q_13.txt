Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I will provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing pests in your Long Melon crop.

### Control of Ber Fly in Long Melon

This is not known to affect Long Melon. The Ber fly (*Carpomyia vesuviana*) is a specific pest of Ber (Indian Jujube) and does not infest cucurbit crops like Long Melon.

### Control of Fruit Fly in Long Melon

Fruit flies, particularly the Melon Fruit Fly (*Bactrocera cucurbitae*), are a major pest of Long Melon (Kakri) in Haryana. They cause significant damage by laying eggs inside the developing fruits, leading to rotting and premature fruit drop. An Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is crucial for effective control.

#### Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies:

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Regularly collect and destroy all infested, fallen, or damaged fruits by burying them deep in the soil or burning them. This breaks the life cycle of the pest.
    *   **Deep Ploughing:** After harvest, deep ploughing helps expose and kill pupae present in the soil.
    *   **Early Sowing/Harvesting:** Adjusting sowing time to avoid peak fruit fly activity can be beneficial. Harvesting fruits at an immature stage (before they are fully ripe) can also reduce infestation.

2.  **Mechanical/Physical Methods:**
    *   **Pheromone Traps:** Install specific cucurbit fruit fly pheromone traps (e.g., Methyl Eugenol traps) at a density of 4-5 traps per acre. These traps attract and kill male fruit flies, reducing the breeding population. Replace lures every 2-3 weeks.
    *   **Bait Stations:** Prepare bait stations using attractants like jaggery or molasses mixed with an insecticide.

3.  **Chemical Control (Use only CIBRC approved chemicals):**
    When infestation is high or other methods are insufficient, chemical control can be employed. Always follow safety precautions, wear personal protective equipment (PPE), and observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI).

    *   **Bait Spray (Recommended for targeted control):**
        Prepare a bait spray by mixing an insecticide with an attractant. This is applied as spot sprays on leaves (not directly on fruits) or on waste fruits kept in the field.
        *   **Malathion 50% EC:** Mix **2 ml** of Malathion 50% EC with **10 g** of jaggery or molasses per litre of water. Apply this mixture as small droplets on 2-3 leaves per plant, or on small pieces of waste fruits placed strategically in the field. Repeat every 7-10 days, especially during peak activity.

    *   **Foliar Spray (For severe infestations):**
        *   **Spinosad 45% SC:** Use **0.25 - 0.3 ml** per litre of water. Spinosad is a biological origin insecticide with good efficacy against fruit flies.
        *   **Cyantraniliprole 10.26% OD:** Use **1.8 ml** per litre of water. This is a newer insecticide that provides effective control.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** Use **1 ml** per litre of water. This is a contact insecticide that provides quick knockdown.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully.
*   Ensure thorough coverage when spraying.
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
*   Observe the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) mentioned on the label to ensure the safety of the produce.
