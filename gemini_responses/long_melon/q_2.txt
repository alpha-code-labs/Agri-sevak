Dear Farmer,

Regarding your concern about Rust diseases (Black, Brown, Yellow, White, and Red rust) in Long Melon:

This is not known to affect Long Melon.

Rust diseases, particularly those you mentioned (Black, Brown, Yellow, White, and Red rust), are primarily associated with cereal crops (like wheat, barley) and some other specific plant families. While cucurbits can be affected by various fungal diseases, these specific types of rusts are not common or significant pathogens of Long Melon (*Trichosanthes cucumerina*).

If you are observing symptoms on your Long Melon plants, it might be another fungal disease such as downy mildew, powdery mildew, or anthracnose, which are more common in cucurbits. I recommend you bring a sample of the affected plant to the Department of Plant Pathology at HAU, Hisar, or your nearest Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) for accurate diagnosis and specific recommendations.
