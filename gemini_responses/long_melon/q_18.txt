As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), here are the scientifically verified recommendations for the use of Growth Regulators/Hormones and Boron in Long Melon for Haryana conditions:

**1. Ethephon (Ethrel):**
*   **Purpose:** To promote the production of female flowers, which leads to increased fruit set and higher yields in cucurbits like Long Melon.
*   **Recommended Dose:** Foliar spray of **Ethephon** at 100-250 ppm (parts per million). This is equivalent to approximately 0.25-0.65 ml/L of a 39% SL (Soluble Liquid) formulation.
    *   **Application Timing:** Apply at the 2-4 true leaf stage. A second spray can be given 7-10 days later if needed, especially if male flower production is still dominant.

**2. 2,4-D (2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid):**
*   **Recommendation:** **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid** (commonly known as 2,4-D) is primarily recognized and used as a selective herbicide. While extremely low concentrations can act as an auxin-type growth regulator in some specific crops, its use in Long Melon for growth regulation is **not commonly recommended or considered safe** for general cultivation practices. Long Melon and other cucurbits are highly sensitive to 2,4-D, and even slightly higher doses or improper application can lead to severe phytotoxicity, malformation, and significant yield loss. Therefore, we do not recommend its application for Long Melon.

**3. Boron:**
*   **Purpose:** Boron is an essential micronutrient critical for various physiological processes, including pollen germination, pollen tube growth, cell wall formation, sugar transport, and overall fruit development. Its deficiency can lead to poor fruit set, malformed fruits, and reduced yield.
*   **Recommended Dose:** Foliar spray of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (a common source of soluble Boron, typically containing 10.5% elemental Boron) at a concentration of 1-2 g/L of water (0.1-0.2% solution).
    *   **Application Timing:** Apply the first spray at the pre-flowering stage and a second spray at the peak flowering stage to ensure adequate Boron availability during critical reproductive phases. Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.
