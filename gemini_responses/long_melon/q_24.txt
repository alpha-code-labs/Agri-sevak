As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following for the ideal transplantation of Long Melon (Kakri/Tar) in Haryana:

### Ideal Transplantation Time

Long Melon is a warm-season crop. For optimal growth and yield in Haryana, two main transplantation windows are recommended:

*   **Spring-Summer Crop:**
    *   **Nursery Sowing:** Late January to Mid-February.
    *   **Transplantation:** Late February to Mid-March, once the danger of frost has passed and day temperatures are consistently mild to warm.
*   **Rainy Season Crop:**
    *   **Nursery Sowing:** Late May to Mid-June.
    *   **Transplantation:** Late June to Mid-July, coinciding with the onset of the monsoon.

### Ideal Transplantation Distance

The spacing depends on the cultivation method (ground sprawling vs. trellising). For typical field cultivation in Haryana:

*   **Row-to-Row Distance:** 1.5 to 2.5 meters (150-250 cm)
*   **Plant-to-Plant Distance:** 0.6 to 1.0 meter (60-100 cm)

A common and effective spacing is 2.0 meters between rows and 0.75 meters between plants within a row.

### Ideal Transplantation Process

Successful transplantation requires careful steps to minimize shock and ensure robust plant establishment:

1.  **Nursery Raising:**
    *   Sow 1-2 seeds per cell in pro-trays or small polybags filled with a sterile, well-drained potting mix (e.g., cocopeat, vermiculite, and compost).
    *   Ensure adequate moisture and protection from extreme weather.
    *   Seedlings are typically ready for transplanting when they develop 2-4 true leaves, usually 3-4 weeks after sowing.

2.  **Field Preparation:**
    *   Prepare the field thoroughly by ploughing 2-3 times to achieve a fine tilth.
    *   Incorporate 20-25 tonnes/acre of well-rotted Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost during the last ploughing.
    *   Form ridges and furrows or raised beds according to your irrigation method and desired spacing.

3.  **Hardening Off:**
    *   About 5-7 days before transplanting, gradually expose the seedlings to outdoor conditions. This involves reducing watering frequency and increasing exposure to sunlight and wind to acclimatize them to the field environment.

4.  **Transplanting:**
    *   **Timing:** Transplant in the late afternoon or on a cloudy day to reduce transplant shock from direct sun and heat.
    *   **Hole Preparation:** Dig holes at the recommended spacing on the ridges or beds.
    *   **Careful Handling:** Gently remove seedlings from the nursery trays/bags, ensuring the root ball remains intact. Avoid disturbing the roots as much as possible.
    *   **Placement:** Place the seedling in the prepared hole, ensuring the root collar (the point where the stem meets the roots) is at the same level as the surrounding soil.
    *   **Firming:** Gently firm the soil around the base of the plant to ensure good root-to-soil contact and remove air pockets.

5.  **Post-Transplantation Care:**
    *   **Immediate Irrigation:** Water the transplanted seedlings immediately and lightly to settle the soil around the roots.
    *   **Shade (if needed):** If transplanting during very hot periods, consider providing temporary shade for the first few days to protect young plants from intense sun.
    *   **Monitoring:** Regularly monitor for signs of wilting, pest infestation, or disease development.
