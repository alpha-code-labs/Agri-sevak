As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for managing growth issues in Long Melon (Kakri) in Haryana. It is crucial to conduct a soil test before applying any fertilizers to understand the specific nutrient status of your field.

### 1. Slow Growth

Slow growth in Long Melon is often indicative of nutrient deficiencies, suboptimal soil conditions, or environmental stress.

*   **Soil Health and Nutrition:**
    *   **Soil Testing:** The most critical first step is to get your soil tested to identify specific nutrient deficiencies (macro and micronutrients) and soil pH.
    *   **Organic Matter:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost (10-15 tonnes/acre) during land preparation to improve soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability.
    *   **Balanced Fertilization:** Based on soil test results, apply recommended doses of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. A general recommendation for cucurbits in Haryana, in the absence of a soil test, might be:
        *   **Nitrogen:** Apply 40-50 kg/acre in split doses.
            *   Basal: 1/3rd of **Urea** (approx. 30-35 kg/acre)
            *   Top dressing: Remaining 2/3rd of **Urea** (approx. 60-70 kg/acre) in 2-3 splits at 3-4 week intervals after sowing.
        *   **Phosphorus:** Apply 20-25 kg P2O5/acre as basal.
            *   Use **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (approx. 45-55 kg/acre) or **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (approx. 125-155 kg/acre).
        *   **Potassium:** Apply 20-25 kg K2O/acre as basal.
            *   Use **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** (approx. 35-40 kg/acre).
    *   **Micronutrients:** If soil test indicates deficiency, or if general slow growth persists:
        *   **Zinc:** Apply **Zinc sulfate** (20-25 kg/acre) as basal, or foliar spray of **Zinc sulfate** (0.5% solution, i.e., 5 g/L water) at 30 and 45 days after sowing.
        *   **Boron:** Apply **Borax** (10 kg/acre) as basal, or foliar spray of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (0.1% solution, i.e., 1 g/L water) at flowering stage.
*   **Water Management:** Ensure adequate and timely irrigation, especially during critical growth stages. Avoid both water stress and waterlogging.
*   **Weed Control:** Keep the field free from weeds, which compete for nutrients and water.

### 2. Yellow Growth (Chlorosis)

Yellowing of leaves (chlorosis) indicates nutrient deficiencies, often related to nitrogen or specific micronutrients.

*   **Identify Specific Deficiency:**
    *   **General yellowing of older leaves:** Likely Nitrogen deficiency.
        *   **Management:** Foliar spray of **Urea** (1-2% solution, i.e., 10-20 g/L water) at weekly intervals until recovery.
    *   **Interveinal yellowing of younger leaves (veins remain green):** Likely Iron or Zinc deficiency.
        *   **Management (Iron):** Foliar spray of **Ferrous sulfate** (0.5-1.0% solution, i.e., 5-10 g/L water) or **Iron EDTA** (0.1-0.2% solution, i.e., 1-2 g/L water) at 7-10 day intervals.
        *   **Management (Zinc):** Foliar spray of **Zinc sulfate** (0.5% solution, i.e., 5 g/L water) at 7-10 day intervals.
    *   **Interveinal yellowing of older leaves:** Likely Magnesium deficiency.
        *   **Management:** Foliar spray of **Magnesium sulfate** (0.5-1.0% solution, i.e., 5-10 g/L water) at 7-10 day intervals.
    *   **General yellowing of younger leaves:** Likely Sulfur deficiency.
        *   **Management:** Apply **Elemental sulfur** (10-15 kg/acre) as basal, or use fertilizers containing sulfur like **Ammonium sulfate**.
*   **Soil pH:** High soil pH can lock up micronutrients, making them unavailable to plants. Soil testing will confirm this.
*   **Waterlogging:** Ensure proper drainage, as waterlogged conditions can also cause yellowing.

### 3. Excessive Height (Leggy Growth)

Excessive height or legginess in Long Melon, beyond its natural vining habit, can be due to high planting density, low light, or excessive nitrogen.

*   **Agronomic Practices:**
    *   **Optimal Spacing:** Ensure proper plant spacing (e.g., 1.5-2.0 m between rows, 0.5-0.75 m between plants) to allow adequate light penetration and air circulation.
    *   **Light:** Ensure the crop receives full sunlight (at least 6-8 hours daily). Avoid planting in shaded areas.
    *   **Balanced Fertilization:** Avoid excessive application of nitrogen, which promotes vegetative growth. Follow soil test recommendations.
    *   **Training and Pruning:** Train the vines on trellises or stakes. Pinching the main growing tip after 4-5 true leaves can encourage lateral branching, which helps in better fruit production and manages height.
*   **Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs):**
    *   To reduce internode elongation and promote a more compact growth habit, a foliar application of a growth retardant can be considered.
    *   **Chlormequat chloride:** Apply **Chlormequat chloride** (50% SL formulation) at 1.0-1.5 ml/L water (or 500-750 ppm) as a foliar spray when plants show excessive vegetative growth, typically after the first few true leaves have developed. Repeat if necessary after 15-20 days. *Always follow label instructions for specific crop and dosage.*

### 4. Excessive Flowering (and related issues like poor fruit set or small fruits)

"Excessive flowering" is often a concern if it doesn't lead to good fruit set or results in too many small, unmarketable fruits.

*   **Improving Fruit Set and Quality:**
    *   **Pollination:** Ensure adequate pollinator activity (e.g., bees). Avoid spraying insecticides during peak flowering hours.
    *   **Nutrient Balance:** Ensure sufficient Phosphorus, Potassium, and critical micronutrients like Boron and Molybdenum, which are vital for flowering and fruit set.
        *   **Boron:** Foliar spray of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (0.1% solution, i.e., 1 g/L water) at pre-flowering and early flowering stages.
    *   **Water Management:** Maintain consistent soil moisture during flowering and fruit development. Water stress can lead to flower drop.
    *   **Temperature:** Ensure temperatures are within the optimal range for Long Melon (typically 25-35°C). Extreme temperatures can affect pollen viability and fruit set.
*   **Managing Fruit Load (if too many flowers lead to small fruits):**
    *   **Manual Thinning:** If the plant sets too many fruits, leading to small size, manual thinning of some young fruits can be done to allow the remaining fruits to grow larger and healthier. This is the most common and effective method.
    *   **Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs) for Fruit Set:**
        *   **Naphthalene acetic acid (NAA):** A very low concentration of **Naphthalene acetic acid** (5-10 ppm, i.e., 0.005-0.01 g/L of 90% technical grade) can be sprayed at the early flowering stage to improve fruit set. *Caution: Higher concentrations can cause flower/fruit thinning, so precise measurement is critical.*
