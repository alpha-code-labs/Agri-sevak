Namaste,

Scale insects and Mealybugs are significant sucking pests that can severely affect Long Melon (Kakri/Tar) cultivation in Haryana, leading to stunted growth, reduced yield, and poor fruit quality. Effective management requires an integrated approach.

Here's a comprehensive strategy:

**1. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Principles:**
An IPM approach combines various methods to manage pests in an economically sound and environmentally sustainable manner.

**2. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   **Regular Monitoring:** Frequently inspect plants, especially the undersides of leaves, stems, and fruit junctions, for early signs of infestation.
*   **Pruning Infested Parts:** Carefully prune and destroy heavily infested leaves, stems, or fruits to reduce pest populations.
*   **Physical Removal:** For small infestations, mealybugs and scales can be physically removed using a strong jet of water or by wiping them off with a cloth dipped in soapy water.
*   **Weed Management:** Keep the field and surrounding areas free of weeds, as they can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
*   **Proper Plant Spacing:** Ensure adequate spacing between plants to improve air circulation and reduce humidity, which can discourage pest proliferation.
*   **Ant Management:** Ants often protect mealybugs and scales to feed on their honeydew. Control ant populations around the plants to allow natural enemies to work effectively.

**3. Biological Control:**
*   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Encourage the presence of natural predators like ladybird beetles (e.g., *Cryptolaemus montrouzieri* for mealybugs), lacewings, and parasitic wasps (e.g., *Anagyrus lopezi* for mealybugs, various encyrtids for scales). Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.
*   **Biopesticides:** In some cases, entomopathogenic fungi like *Beauveria bassiana* or *Verticillium lecanii* can be effective against mealybugs, especially in high humidity conditions. Apply as per manufacturer's recommendations.

**4. Chemical Control (Use as a last resort and with strict adherence to safety guidelines):**
When infestations are severe and other methods are insufficient, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development. Ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and stem crevices where these pests hide.

For effective control of Scale insects and Mealybugs in Long Melon, consider the following CIBRC approved insecticides:

*   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at a concentration of **0.5 - 0.75 ml per liter of water**. This is a systemic insecticide effective against sucking pests.
*   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at a concentration of **0.2 - 0.4 g per liter of water**. Another systemic neonicotinoid effective against a wide range of sucking pests.
*   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply at a concentration of **0.2 - 0.4 g per liter of water**. This is also a systemic insecticide with translaminar action.
*   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at a concentration of **1.25 ml per liter of water**. This is an insect growth regulator (IGR) that primarily targets nymphs by inhibiting chitin synthesis, making it very effective against mealybug and scale crawlers.
*   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:** Apply at a concentration of **0.75 - 1 ml per liter of water**. This is a dual-systemic insecticide, moving both upwards and downwards in the plant, providing excellent control of hidden pests like scales and mealybugs.

**Important Precautions:**
*   **Read the Label:** Always read and follow the instructions on the insecticide label carefully, including dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   **Protective Gear:** Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, and protective clothing during mixing and application.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Observe the specified pre-harvest interval (PHI) to ensure the safety of the produce.
*   **Spray Timing:** Apply insecticides during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.

By implementing these strategies, you can effectively manage Scale insects and Mealybugs in your Long Melon crop and ensure a healthy yield. For any specific concerns or severe outbreaks, please consult with the HAU extension services for tailored advice.
