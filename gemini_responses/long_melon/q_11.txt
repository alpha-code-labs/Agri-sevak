As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in Long Melon (Kakri/Tar) in Haryana:

**Beetles (e.g., Red Pumpkin Beetle, Epilachna Beetle)**

Beetles, particularly the Red Pumpkin Beetle (Aulacophora foveicollis) and sometimes Epilachna beetles, are significant pests of Long Melon, especially during the seedling stage. They feed on leaves, cotyledons, flowers, and sometimes fruits.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Beetles:**

1.  **Cultural and Mechanical Methods:**
    *   **Early Sowing:** Sowing early can help the crop escape the peak activity period of the Red Pumpkin Beetle.
    *   **Hand Picking:** In small plots, adult beetles can be hand-picked and destroyed, especially during the early morning hours when they are less active.
    *   **Ash/Neem Cake Application:** Dusting seedlings with wood ash or applying neem cake around the base of plants can deter beetles.
    *   **Clean Cultivation:** Remove weeds and crop residues that can harbor pests.

2.  **Chemical Control (Use only CIBRC approved chemicals):**
    When beetle infestation is severe, especially at the seedling stage, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) before harvesting fruits for consumption.

    *   **For Foliar Spray:**
        *   **Malathion** 50% EC: 1.0 - 1.5 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: 0.5 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: 0.3 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: 0.2 g per litre of water.

    *   **For Soil Drench (especially for Red Pumpkin Beetle larvae feeding on roots/stem base):**
        *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: 0.5 ml per litre of water, applied around the base of the plant.

**Weevils:**
