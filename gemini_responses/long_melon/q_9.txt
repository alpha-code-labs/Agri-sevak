Mites, including Red Spider Mite (Tetranychus urticae) and various species of Rust Mites (e.g., Aculops lycopersici), are significant pests of Long Melon (Kakri) in Haryana, especially during hot and dry weather conditions. They can cause considerable damage, leading to reduced yield and quality.

Here's a comprehensive approach to control mites in Long Melon:

**1. Identification and Symptoms:**
*   **Red Spider Mite:** Small, reddish-brown mites visible on the underside of leaves. Symptoms include fine webbing on leaves, yellowing, bronzing, and stippling (tiny white or yellow spots) on the upper leaf surface. Severely infested leaves may dry up and fall.
*   **Rust Mite:** Microscopic, wedge-shaped mites, not easily visible to the naked eye. Symptoms include bronzing or russeting of leaves, especially along veins, leaf curling, and stunted growth. Flowers and fruits can also be affected, leading to malformation.

**2. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Regular Monitoring:** Inspect plants frequently, especially the undersides of leaves, for early signs of mite infestation.
    *   **Water Management:** Overhead irrigation or strong water sprays can physically dislodge mites and increase humidity, which is unfavorable for them.
    *   **Weed Control:** Remove weeds from and around the field as they can act as alternate hosts for mites.
    *   **Crop Residue Management:** Remove and destroy infested plant debris after harvest to reduce overwintering populations.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can promote lush growth that is more attractive to mites.
    *   **Pruning:** Remove severely infested leaves or plant parts to reduce mite populations.

*   **Biological Control:**
    *   Conserve natural enemies such as predatory mites (e.g., Amblyseius spp.), lacewings, and ladybird beetles, which feed on pest mites. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.
    *   Consider releasing commercially available predatory mites if feasible and economically viable.

*   **Chemical Control (Acaricides):**
    When mite populations are high and causing economic damage, chemical control may be necessary. Always rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves.

    *   **For Red Spider Mite:**
        *   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** Apply at 0.5 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Fenpyroximate 5% EC:** Apply at 0.5 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Propargite 57% EC:** Apply at 1.5-2.0 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Abamectin 1.9% EC:** Apply at 0.5 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Fenazaquin 10% EC:** Apply at 1.0-1.5 ml per litre of water.

    *   **For Rust Mite (and also effective against Red Spider Mite):**
        *   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP:** Apply at 2.0-3.0 grams per litre of water. (Note: Avoid applying sulphur when temperatures are very high, i.e., above 30-32°C, as it can cause phytotoxicity).
        *   **Abamectin 1.9% EC:** Apply at 0.5 ml per litre of water.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label, including dosage, application method, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and safety precautions.
*   Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Spray during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and current pest pressure.
