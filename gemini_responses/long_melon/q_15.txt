As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Long Melon (Kakri) in Haryana:

### Control of Grasshopper in Long Melon

Grasshoppers are polyphagous pests that can cause significant damage to Long Melon by feeding on leaves, stems, and fruits. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is recommended for effective control.

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Keep the field free of weeds and crop residues, which can serve as shelter and breeding sites for grasshoppers.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** During summer, deep ploughing of fields can expose grasshopper eggs laid in the soil to predators and harsh weather conditions, reducing their population.
*   **Hand Picking:** In small areas or during early stages of infestation, grasshoppers can be hand-picked and destroyed.
*   **Bird Perches:** Install bird perches in the field to encourage predatory birds, which feed on grasshoppers.

**2. Chemical Control (Apply only if infestation is severe and cultural methods are insufficient):**
When using insecticides, always follow label instructions, wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), and observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI).

*   Spray with one of the following CIBRC approved insecticides:
    *   **Malathion** 50% EC at 1.0 - 1.5 L/acre in 500-750 L of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 100-125 ml/acre in 200-400 L of water.
    *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 1.0 - 1.25 L/acre in 500-750 L of water.
    *   **Quinalphos** 25% EC at 1.0 - 1.25 L/acre in 500-750 L of water.

### Control of Other Pests

*   **Painted bug:** This is not known to affect Long Melon.
*   **Red cotton bug:** This is not known to affect Long Melon.
*   **Black ants:** This is not known to affect Long Melon. (Black ants are generally not considered a direct pest causing significant damage to Long Melon plants. They are often observed tending to other sap-sucking insects like aphids or mealybugs, which excrete honeydew. In such cases, controlling the primary sap-sucking pest will indirectly manage the ant population.)

**General Advice:**
Always prioritize Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategies, combining cultural, mechanical, biological, and chemical methods. Consult with local agricultural extension services for the most current and specific recommendations for your region and crop stage. Ensure proper safety measures are followed during pesticide application, including wearing protective gear and adhering to the recommended pre-harvest interval (PHI) to ensure food safety.
