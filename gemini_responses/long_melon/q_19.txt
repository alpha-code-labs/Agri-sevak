Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I strongly recommend that the first and most crucial step in addressing any nutrient deficiency is to conduct a comprehensive **soil test**. This will provide precise information on the nutrient status of your field and allow for tailored recommendations, preventing over-application and ensuring efficient nutrient use.

However, if you observe symptoms indicative of macro-nutrient deficiencies in your Long Melon crop, here's how you can address them:

### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   General yellowing (chlorosis) of older leaves, starting from the tips and progressing inwards.
*   Stunted plant growth with thin, weak stems.
*   Reduced fruit set and smaller fruit size.

**Corrective Measures:**
*   **Foliar Application (for quick correction):**
    *   Spray 1-2% solution of **Urea** (10-20 g of Urea per litre of water).
    *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 7-10 day intervals, preferably in the morning or late afternoon.
*   **Soil Application (for sustained supply):**
    *   Apply 20-30 kg/acre of **Urea** as a side dressing. This can be split into two applications during the active vegetative growth phase, ensuring proper irrigation afterwards for nutrient uptake.

### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   Dark green or purplish discoloration of older leaves, especially on the underside.
*   Stunted growth, poor root development, and delayed flowering/fruiting.
*   Leaves may appear stiff and brittle.

**Corrective Measures:**
*   **Foliar Application (for quick correction):**
    *   Spray 1-2% solution of **Monoammonium Phosphate (MAP)** (10-20 g of MAP per litre of water).
    *   Alternatively, a 1-2% solution of **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)** can be used (10-20 g of DAP per litre of water).
    *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 7-10 day intervals.
*   **Soil Application (for sustained supply):**
    *   Apply 25-30 kg/acre of **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)** as a side dressing or broadcast and incorporate into the soil.
    *   Ensure good soil moisture for effective uptake.

### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   Yellowing and browning (scorching or necrosis) of leaf margins, particularly on older leaves.
*   Weak stems, poor fruit development, and reduced fruit quality (e.g., poor taste, reduced shelf life).
*   Increased susceptibility to diseases and lodging.

**Corrective Measures:**
*   **Foliar Application (for quick correction):**
    *   Spray 1-2% solution of **Potassium Nitrate** (10-20 g of Potassium Nitrate per litre of water).
    *   Alternatively, a 1-2% solution of **Sulphate of Potash (SOP)** can be used (10-20 g of SOP per litre of water).
    *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 7-10 day intervals.
*   **Soil Application (for sustained supply):**
    *   Apply 20-25 kg/acre of **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** as a side dressing.
    *   Alternatively, 25-30 kg/acre of **Sulphate of Potash (SOP)** can be applied, especially if sulfur deficiency is also suspected.
    *   Ensure proper irrigation after application.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Soil Testing is Paramount:** These recommendations are general guidelines. A soil test report will provide precise quantities required for your specific field conditions.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management (INM):** Always strive to combine chemical fertilizers with organic manures (Farm Yard Manure, compost) to improve soil health, structure, and nutrient retention capacity in the long term.
*   **Timing and Method:** Apply fertilizers at appropriate growth stages and ensure even distribution. Foliar sprays offer quick relief, while soil applications provide sustained nutrition.
*   **Irrigation:** Adequate and timely irrigation is essential for nutrient dissolution and uptake by the plant roots.
