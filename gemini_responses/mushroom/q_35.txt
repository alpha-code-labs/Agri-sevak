As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the maturity signs, harvesting time, and cutting process for commonly cultivated mushrooms in Haryana, primarily Button mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) and Oyster mushroom (Pleurotus spp.).

### Maturity Signs

**1. Button Mushroom (Agaricus bisporus):**
*   **Cap Development:** The cap should be fully developed and rounded.
*   **Veil Condition:** The most critical indicator is the "veil" (a membrane connecting the cap to the stem). It should be intact or just beginning to tear. Mushrooms harvested at this stage are known as "button" or "closed cap" mushrooms, which have the best shelf life and market value.
*   **Size:** Depending on market preference, mushrooms are typically harvested when the cap diameter is between 2 to 5 cm. Over-mature mushrooms (where the veil has completely broken, exposing the gills) have a shorter shelf life and may release spores, reducing quality.

**2. Oyster Mushroom (Pleurotus spp.):**
*   **Cap Shape:** The edges of the cap should start to flatten or slightly curl upwards.
*   **Size:** Individual caps within a cluster typically reach 5 to 15 cm in diameter. The entire cluster is harvested together.
*   **Spore Release:** While some spore release is natural, heavy white powder (spores) visible on the substrate or lower caps indicates the cluster is slightly over-mature. It's best to harvest just before significant spore release to maintain quality and reduce mess.

### Harvesting Time

**1. Button Mushroom (Agaricus bisporus):**
*   Harvesting typically begins 15-20 days after the casing layer is applied.
*   Mushrooms grow in "flushes" or "breaks," with each flush lasting 3-7 days, followed by a rest period. A crop usually yields 3-5 flushes over a period of 6-8 weeks.
*   During a flush, daily harvesting is often necessary as mushrooms grow rapidly.

**2. Oyster Mushroom (Pleurotus spp.):**
*   Harvesting usually starts 7-10 days after spawning, or 3-5 days after the appearance of pinheads (tiny mushroom primordia).
*   Oyster mushrooms are harvested in clusters.
*   Multiple flushes are obtained, typically 3-4 flushes over a period of 4-6 weeks, depending on the substrate and environmental conditions.

### Cutting Process

**1. Button Mushroom (Agaricus bisporus):**
*   **Method 1 (Twisting):** Gently hold the cap of the mushroom and twist it carefully from the casing layer. This method helps to avoid damaging the delicate mycelial network in the casing, which is crucial for subsequent flushes.
*   **Method 2 (Cutting):** Alternatively, use a sharp, clean knife to cut the stem just above the casing layer. This method is often preferred for larger operations to ensure a clean cut.
*   **Post-Harvest Trimming:** Immediately after harvesting, trim the dirty base of the stem to remove any adhering casing material. This improves hygiene and presentation.

**2. Oyster Mushroom (Pleurotus spp.):**
*   **Cluster Harvesting:** Oyster mushrooms are harvested as an entire cluster.
*   **Cutting:** Use a sharp, clean knife to cut the entire cluster at its base, where it attaches to the substrate block or bag.
*   **Cleanliness:** Ensure no significant stem remnants are left on the substrate block, as these can rot and become a source of contamination or attract pests.
