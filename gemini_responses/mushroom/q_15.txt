As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I must provide scientifically verified advice. Based on current mycological and entomological research concerning mushroom cultivation, the following applies:

*   **Grasshopper:** This is not known to affect Mushroom.
*   **Painted bug:** This is not known to affect Mushroom.
*   **Red cotton bug:** This is not known to affect Mushroom.
*   **Black ants:** While ants can be a general nuisance in any agricultural setting and may be attracted to food residues or moisture, they are not known to directly feed on or cause damage to mushroom mycelium or fruiting bodies. Therefore, this is not known to affect Mushroom as a direct pest.
