As a Senior Agronomist, it's important to clarify that mushrooms are fungi, not plants, and therefore do not grow in soil in the traditional sense. They derive their nutrients from organic matter, known as a substrate. Their cultivation requires specific environmental controls rather than soil-based conditions.

Here are the suitable climate, substrate requirements (instead of soil type), and moisture management (instead of drainage) for common cultivated mushrooms, particularly relevant for Haryana:

### Climate Requirements for Mushroom Cultivation

The optimal climate conditions vary slightly depending on the mushroom species, but general ranges are crucial for successful cultivation:

*   **Temperature:**
    *   **Spawn Run (Mycelial Growth):** This phase requires a stable temperature, typically between **20-25°C** for most common varieties like Button (*Agaricus bisporus*) and Oyster (*Pleurotus* spp.).
    *   **Fruiting (Pinhead Formation & Development):** Lower temperatures are generally required to induce fruiting.
        *   **Button Mushroom:** **14-18°C**
        *   **Oyster Mushroom:** **18-28°C** (species-dependent, some tolerate higher temperatures)
        *   **Paddy Straw Mushroom (*Volvariella volvacea*):** **28-35°C** (suited for warmer climates)
*   **Relative Humidity (RH):** High humidity is critical for mushroom growth and to prevent drying out.
    *   **Spawn Run:** **75-85%**
    *   **Fruiting:** **85-95%**
*   **Ventilation and Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Levels:**
    *   **Spawn Run:** Higher CO2 levels (up to 5000 ppm) are tolerated and can even be beneficial.
    *   **Fruiting:** Low CO2 levels (below 800-1000 ppm, ideally 400-600 ppm) are essential for proper cap and stem development. Adequate fresh air exchange is vital to remove CO2 and supply oxygen.
*   **Light:** Mushrooms do not require light for growth (photosynthesis). However, some species benefit from diffuse light during fruiting for proper cap formation and orientation. Direct sunlight is detrimental.

### Substrate Type (Instead of Soil Type)

Mushrooms do not grow in soil. They are saprophytes, meaning they obtain nutrients from decomposing organic matter. The "soil type" equivalent for mushrooms is the **substrate**. The choice of substrate depends entirely on the mushroom species:

*   **Button Mushroom (*Agaricus bisporus*):** Requires a specially prepared, pasteurized **compost** made from agricultural wastes like wheat straw, paddy straw, chicken manure, gypsum, and other nitrogenous supplements.
*   **Oyster Mushroom (*Pleurotus* spp.):** Can grow on a wide range of lignocellulosic materials, including:
    *   **Paddy straw**
    *   **Wheat straw**
    *   **Maize cobs**
    *   **Sugarcane bagasse**
    *   **Sawdust** (from non-resinous wood)
    *   Cotton waste
*   **Paddy Straw Mushroom (*Volvariella volvacea*):** Primarily cultivated on **paddy straw**.
*   **Milky Mushroom (*Calocybe indica*):** Grows well on **paddy straw** and other agricultural residues.

The substrate must be properly sterilized or pasteurized to eliminate competing microorganisms before spawning.

### Moisture Management (Instead of Drainage Requirement)

Since mushrooms do not grow in soil, traditional soil drainage is not applicable. However, meticulous moisture management is crucial for both the substrate and the growing environment:

*   **Substrate Moisture Content:**
    *   The substrate must be adequately moist (typically **60-75% moisture content**) to support mycelial growth and fruiting. It should feel damp but not waterlogged when squeezed.
    *   Excess moisture in the substrate can lead to anaerobic conditions, promoting the growth of harmful bacteria and fungi, and inhibiting mushroom growth.
*   **Environmental Moisture Management:**
    *   **Humidity Control:** Maintaining high relative humidity in the growing room is essential to prevent the mushrooms from drying out and cracking. This is often achieved through humidifiers, misting systems, or wet floors.
    *   **Condensation Prevention:** While high humidity is needed, excessive condensation dripping onto the mushrooms can lead to bacterial blotch and other diseases. Proper ventilation and air circulation are vital to manage condensation.
    *   **Growing Room Drainage:** The floor of the mushroom growing facility should have adequate drainage to facilitate cleaning, sanitation, and to manage any excess water from humidification systems, ensuring a hygienic environment.

In summary, successful mushroom cultivation in Haryana, or anywhere, relies on precise control of environmental factors and the use of appropriate, well-prepared organic substrates, rather than specific soil types or traditional drainage systems.
