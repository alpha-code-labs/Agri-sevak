As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I must clarify that addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium/Potash) in mushroom cultivation differs significantly from traditional plant agriculture.

Mushrooms are fungi, not plants. They do not photosynthesize and do not absorb inorganic nutrients directly from the soil in the same manner as green plants. Instead, mushrooms obtain all their essential nutrients, including Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K), by breaking down complex organic matter present in their growth substrate (e.g., compost, straw, sawdust).

Therefore, the concept of "macro-nutrient deficiency" in mushrooms is primarily addressed through the **proper formulation and preparation of the substrate** before spawning, rather than through post-spawning application of inorganic fertilizers.

Here's how to address macro-nutrient requirements in mushroom cultivation:

1.  **Understanding Mushroom Nutrition:**
    *   Mushrooms require N, P, and K, along with other macro and micronutrients, for mycelial growth and fruiting body development.
    *   These nutrients are derived from the enzymatic breakdown of complex organic compounds (like cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, and proteins) within the substrate.
    *   A balanced Carbon-to-Nitrogen (C:N) ratio in the substrate is crucial, typically ranging from 25:1 to 35:1 for most cultivated mushrooms, depending on the species.

2.  **Addressing Deficiencies through Substrate Formulation:**
    The primary method to ensure adequate N, P, and K is to incorporate appropriate nutrient sources during the initial substrate preparation (e.g., composting or mixing of raw materials).

    *   **Nitrogen (N) Sources:**
        Nitrogen is vital for protein synthesis and mycelial growth. Common CIBRC-approved sources that can be incorporated into the substrate during composting or mixing include:
        *   **Urea** (typically 0.5-1.5 kg per tonne of dry substrate, depending on initial N content)
        *   **Ammonium Sulfate** (2-5 kg per tonne of dry substrate)
        *   **Calcium Ammonium Nitrate (CAN)** (2-5 kg per tonne of dry substrate)
        *   **Di-Ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (provides both N and P, 1-3 kg per tonne of dry substrate)
        *   Organic sources like wheat bran, rice bran, poultry manure, or horse manure also contribute significant nitrogen.

    *   **Phosphorus (P) Sources:**
        Phosphorus is essential for energy transfer and genetic material. CIBRC-approved sources for substrate enrichment include:
        *   **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (2-5 kg per tonne of dry substrate)
        *   **Di-Ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (1-3 kg per tonne of dry substrate)

    *   **Potassium (K) Sources:**
        Potassium plays a role in enzyme activation and water regulation. CIBRC-approved sources for substrate enrichment include:
        *   **Muriate of Potash (Potassium Chloride)** (1-3 kg per tonne of dry substrate)
        *   **Sulfate of Potash (Potassium Sulfate)** (1-3 kg per tonne of dry substrate)

3.  **Important Considerations and Caution:**
    *   **Timing:** These nutrient sources are incorporated *during the initial preparation of the substrate* (e.g., composting, mixing of ingredients), not as a top-dressing or drench after spawning.
    *   **Balance:** Over-enrichment, especially with nitrogen, can lead to ammonia toxicity, increased risk of contamination by competitor molds, and poor mushroom yields.
    *   **Direct Application:** Applying inorganic N-P-K fertilizers directly to spawned substrate or fruiting bodies is generally **not recommended**. It can:
        *   Introduce contaminants.
        *   Alter pH unfavorably.
        *   Cause osmotic stress to the mycelium.
        *   Inhibit mushroom growth or fruiting.
    *   **Substrate Quality:** The best way to prevent "deficiencies" is to use high-quality raw materials and follow scientifically validated substrate preparation protocols (e.g., composting for button mushrooms, sterilization/pasteurization for oyster mushrooms).

In summary, ensuring adequate macro-nutrient supply for mushrooms is achieved by carefully formulating a balanced and nutrient-rich substrate from the very beginning of the cultivation process, utilizing appropriate CIBRC-approved nutrient supplements as needed during substrate preparation. Direct application of N-P-K fertilizers to growing mushrooms is generally counterproductive.
