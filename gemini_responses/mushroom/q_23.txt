As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU), I must clarify that the concepts of "seed treatment" and "soil treatment" as applied to conventional agricultural crops are not directly applicable to mushroom cultivation. Mushrooms are fungi, not plants, and their propagation and growth requirements are fundamentally different.

Here's why:

1.  **Seed Treatment for Mushroom:**
    *   Mushrooms do not produce "seeds" in the botanical sense. They reproduce via spores, but commercial mushroom cultivation primarily relies on "spawn."
    *   **Spawn** is essentially the mycelium (the vegetative part of the fungus) grown on a sterile substrate, typically cereal grains (like wheat or sorghum).
    *   The production of mushroom spawn is a highly sterile laboratory process designed to ensure purity and prevent contamination. It does not involve "seed treatment" with chemicals as practiced for plant seeds.
    *   Therefore, the concept of "seed treatment" is not known to affect mushroom cultivation.

2.  **Soil Treatment for Mushroom:**
    *   Mushrooms are not typically grown directly in "soil" like conventional crops. Instead, they are cultivated on specific organic "substrates."
    *   Common substrates include composted agricultural by-products (e.g., wheat straw, paddy straw, sugarcane bagasse), wood logs, or sawdust.
    *   Before inoculation with spawn, these substrates undergo rigorous preparation processes, primarily **pasteurization** or **sterilization**. This is a critical step to eliminate competing microorganisms (bacteria, molds) and pests that could otherwise outcompete the mushroom mycelium.
    *   This substrate preparation is analogous to creating a clean growing environment, but it is distinct from "soil treatment" for field crops, which often involves applying chemicals to the soil to manage soil-borne pests and diseases.
    *   Therefore, the concept of "soil treatment" is not known to affect mushroom cultivation in the conventional agricultural sense.

In summary, while rigorous hygiene and substrate preparation are paramount for successful mushroom cultivation, these processes are distinct from the "seed treatment" and "soil treatment" methods used for conventional plant crops.
