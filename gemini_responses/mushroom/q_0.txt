As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I must provide scientifically verified advice. Based on current mycological and plant pathology knowledge, the fungal diseases listed are primarily pathogens of higher plants and are not known to specifically affect cultivated mushrooms as primary diseases.

Here is the assessment for each:

*   **Alternaria:** This is not known to affect Mushroom.
*   **Anthracnose:** This is not known to affect Mushroom.
*   **Blast:** This is not known to affect Mushroom.
*   **Blight:** This is not known to affect Mushroom.
*   **Brown spot:** This is not known to affect Mushroom.
*   **Downy mildew:** This is not known to affect Mushroom.
*   **Powdery mildew:** This is not known to affect Mushroom.
*   **Grey mildew:** This is not known to affect Mushroom.

For effective control of common fungal diseases in mushrooms (such as Dry Bubble, Wet Bubble, Cobweb Disease, Green Mould, etc.), it is crucial to focus on strict hygiene, proper environmental control (temperature, humidity, CO2), and using disease-free spawn and substrate. If you are observing specific symptoms on your mushrooms, please provide details or images for a more accurate diagnosis and recommendation.
