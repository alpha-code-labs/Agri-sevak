Mushrooms are cultivated on specially prepared composted substrates, not directly in soil like field crops. Organic manures like Farmyard Manure (FYM) and Vermicompost are incorporated into the substrate or casing layer, while bio-stimulants like Sagarika are typically applied as sprays. Here are the recommendations for their use in mushroom cultivation, particularly for Button Mushroom (*Agaricus bisporus*), which is commonly grown in Haryana:

**1. Farmyard Manure (FYM):**
*   **Role:** Well-composted FYM can be used as a component in the preparation of the mushroom growing substrate. It contributes to the nitrogen content and provides a suitable environment for microbial activity during the composting process. It is generally not used as a standalone substrate or direct top-dressing.
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   **As a component of mushroom compost:** Up to **10-20%** of the dry weight of the primary substrate material (e.g., wheat straw) can be replaced or supplemented with well-composted FYM during the initial mixing phase of composting. Ensure the FYM is fully decomposed, free from weed seeds and pathogens, and has a C:N ratio suitable for mushroom composting.
    *   **Caution:** Raw or improperly composted FYM should never be used, as it can introduce contaminants, pests, and diseases, and lead to poor mushroom yields.

**2. Vermicompost:**
*   **Role:** Vermicompost is highly beneficial, primarily used as a component of the casing layer, which is applied over the spawned compost. It improves water retention, provides essential nutrients, and supports beneficial microbial populations crucial for mushroom pinning and development.
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   **For Casing Layer:** Mix sterilized vermicompost with sterilized soil, peat, or coco-peat. A common and effective ratio is **1 part Vermicompost to 1-2 parts sterilized soil/peat/coco-peat** (by volume).
    *   **Application:** Apply this mixture as a casing layer of **3-5 cm** thickness over the fully colonized mushroom substrate.
    *   **As a substrate supplement:** While less common than in casing, vermicompost can sometimes be added in small quantities (**2-5%** by weight) to the mushroom substrate during spawning to boost nutrient availability, but its primary benefit is in the casing layer.

**3. Sagarika (Seaweed Extract):**
*   **Role:** Sagarika is a bio-stimulant derived from red and brown seaweeds. It contains natural plant growth regulators (auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins), amino acids, vitamins, and micronutrients, which can enhance mycelial growth, improve mushroom yield, and quality.
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   **Foliar Spray/Drench:** Apply as a dilute solution after casing and during the cropping cycles.
    *   **Dose:** Mix **2-3 ml of Sagarika per litre of water**.
    *   **Application Frequency:** Spray or drench the casing layer lightly, typically **2-3 times** during the cropping period, starting after the casing layer has been applied and mycelium has started to grow into it, and then during subsequent flushes. Avoid over-wetting.
