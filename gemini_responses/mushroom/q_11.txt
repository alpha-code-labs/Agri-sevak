As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in mushroom cultivation:

### Control of Beetles in Mushroom

Beetles, particularly fungus beetles (e.g., Lathridiidae, Cryptophagidae) and rove beetles (Staphylinidae), can occasionally infest mushroom farms, feeding on mycelium, mushrooms, or decaying organic matter. Control strategies should focus on an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach.

*   **Cultural and Hygienic Practices (Primary Control):**
    *   **Strict Sanitation:** Maintain impeccable hygiene within and around the mushroom growing rooms. Promptly remove spent compost, mushroom debris, and any other organic waste that could serve as breeding sites.
    *   **Compost Pasteurization:** Ensure thorough and effective pasteurization of the compost to eliminate any beetle eggs, larvae, or pupae present in the substrate.
    *   **Exclusion:** Install fine mesh screens (e.g., 30-40 mesh) on all vents, windows, and doors to prevent adult beetles from entering the growing rooms.
    *   **Monitoring:** Use yellow sticky traps placed near potential entry points or within the growing area to monitor adult beetle populations. This helps in early detection and assessing infestation levels.
    *   **Environmental Control:** Maintain optimal temperature and humidity levels as recommended for mushroom cultivation, as extreme conditions can stress the crop and make it more susceptible to pests.

*   **Chemical Control (Use only if cultural methods are insufficient and infestation is severe, and always follow label instructions and pre-harvest intervals):**
    *   **For Adult Beetles (Space Spray/Fumigation in empty rooms or between crops):**
        *   **Dichlorvos** (76% EC): Apply as a space spray or fog in empty mushroom houses or between cropping cycles.
            *   **Dosage:** 1 ml per litre of water, applied at 1 litre of solution per 100 cubic meters of space. Ensure proper ventilation before re-entry.
    *   **For General Contact Control (Surface Spray):**
        *   **Malathion** (50% EC): Can be used as a general surface spray on walls, floors, and non-cropping areas. Avoid direct application on mushrooms during cropping.
            *   **Dosage:** 1.5 - 2 ml per litre of water.
