As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm the following regarding the specialized practices you've inquired about in the context of Mushroom cultivation:

*   **Pruning:** This is not known to affect Mushroom. Pruning is a horticultural practice applied to plants to remove specific parts for improved growth, shape, or yield. Mushrooms are fungi and do not possess the botanical structures (stems, branches, leaves) that would require pruning.
*   **Desuckering:** This is not known to affect Mushroom. Desuckering involves the removal of suckers (shoots arising from the base or roots of a plant). Mushrooms are fungi and do not produce suckers.
*   **Mulching:** This is not known to affect Mushroom in the traditional horticultural sense. Mulching is the practice of covering soil to conserve moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate temperature for plants. While some mushroom cultivation (e.g., Button mushrooms) utilizes a "casing layer" (a layer of peat moss, soil, or other material applied over the colonized substrate), its function is to provide a microclimate and moisture for fruiting body initiation, which is distinct from mulching for soil-grown plants.
*   **Grafting:** This is not known to affect Mushroom. Grafting is a horticultural technique used to join plant tissues so they grow together. Mushrooms are fungi and lack the vascular tissues and biological mechanisms required for grafting.
*   **Pollination:** This is not known to affect Mushroom. Pollination is the transfer of pollen in flowering plants for reproduction. Mushrooms reproduce via spores, not pollen, and do not have flowers or require pollination.
