As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I must clarify that mushroom cultivation differs significantly from traditional crop cultivation. Mushrooms are fungi, not plants, and therefore, terms like 'sowing method,' 'planting depth,' and 'spacing' are not directly applicable. Instead, we use terms like 'spawning method,' 'spawn distribution,' and 'spawn rate.'

Here are the recommended practices for the two most commonly cultivated mushrooms in Haryana: Button Mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) and Oyster Mushroom (Pleurotus spp.).

### I. Button Mushroom (Agaricus bisporus)

Button mushrooms are grown on specially prepared compost, not soil. The compost undergoes a two-phase fermentation process (Phase I and Phase II pasteurization) to create a selective medium for the mushroom mycelium.

*   **Spawning Method/Pattern (Equivalent to Sowing Method):**
    *   **Mixing Method:** This is the most common and recommended method. The mushroom spawn (mycelium grown on sterilized grains like wheat or jowar) is thoroughly mixed with the prepared and cooled compost. This ensures even distribution of the spawn throughout the compost, leading to uniform colonization.
    *   **Layering Method:** Spawn can also be spread in layers between compost layers when filling trays or beds. However, thorough mixing is generally preferred for uniform and faster colonization.
*   **Spawn Distribution (Equivalent to Planting Depth & Spacing):**
    *   Spawn is distributed uniformly throughout the entire depth of the compost in the beds or trays. Typical compost depth in trays is 15-20 cm. The goal is to ensure that the mycelium can colonize the entire compost mass evenly.
*   **Spawn Dose (Equivalent to Seed Dose):**
    *   The recommended spawn dose is **0.5% to 0.75% of the wet compost weight**.
    *   Practically, this translates to **5-7 kg of spawn per tonne (1000 kg) of wet compost**.

### II. Oyster Mushroom (Pleurotus spp.)

Oyster mushrooms are grown on ligno-cellulosic agricultural wastes like wheat straw, paddy straw, cotton stalks, or sugarcane bagasse. The substrate is typically chopped and then pasteurized (hot water treatment or steam sterilization) to eliminate contaminants.

*   **Spawning Method/Pattern (Equivalent to Sowing Method):**
    *   **Layering Method (Bag Cultivation):** This is the most common method for Oyster mushroom cultivation. The pasteurized and cooled substrate is filled into transparent polythene bags (e.g., 60x45 cm with perforations). Spawn is layered alternately with the substrate. For example, a layer of substrate, then a layer of spawn, another layer of substrate, and so on, until the bag is filled.
    *   **Mixing Method:** Spawn can also be thoroughly mixed with the substrate before filling it into the bags.
*   **Spawn Distribution (Equivalent to Planting Depth & Spacing):**
    *   Spawn is distributed evenly throughout the substrate within the polythene bags. The aim is to ensure that the mycelium can colonize the entire substrate mass quickly and uniformly.
*   **Spawn Dose (Equivalent to Seed Dose):**
    *   The recommended spawn dose is **2% to 5% of the dry substrate weight**.
    *   Practically, this means **2-5 kg of spawn for every 100 kg of dry substrate** (e.g., wheat straw).

**Important Note:** The success of mushroom cultivation heavily relies on maintaining optimal environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, CO2 levels) during different growth phases (spawn run, casing, pinning, fruiting) and strict hygiene to prevent contamination.
