As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I must provide scientifically verified advice.

Regarding the use of Ethrel, 2,4-D, and Boron as growth regulators/hormones in Mushroom cultivation:

*   **Ethrel (Ethephon):** This is not known to affect Mushroom in a beneficial way as a growth regulator.
*   **2,4-D (2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid):** This is not known to affect Mushroom in a beneficial way as a growth regulator.
*   **Boron:** This is not known to affect Mushroom in a beneficial way as a growth regulator.

These substances are not typically used or recommended as growth regulators or hormones for commercial mushroom cultivation. Mushrooms (fungi) have different physiological requirements compared to plants, for which these compounds are commonly used.
