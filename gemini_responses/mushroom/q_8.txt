This is not known to affect Mushroom.

Sucking pests like Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, Thrips, and Psylla are primarily pests of vascular plants, feeding on plant sap. Mushrooms are fungi and do not possess the vascular system or sap that these pests feed upon. Therefore, these specific pests are not considered direct pests of cultivated mushrooms.

Mushroom cultivation in Haryana typically faces challenges from other types of pests such as mites, nematodes, and various fly species (e.g., sciarid flies, phorid flies), as well as fungal and bacterial diseases. Control measures for mushroom pests focus on hygiene, environmental control, and specific insecticides/acaricides targeting the actual pests of mushrooms, if necessary and approved.
