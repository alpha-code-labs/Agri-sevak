Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I must clarify an important point regarding mushroom cultivation.

Mushrooms are fungi, not plants, and therefore they are not "transplanted" in the traditional sense like seedlings. Instead, mushrooms are propagated by introducing mushroom "spawn" (which is mycelium, the vegetative part of the fungus, grown on a grain substrate) into a prepared growing medium or substrate. This process is scientifically known as **spawning**.

Here is the ideal information regarding spawning time, distribution, and process for common mushrooms cultivated in Haryana:

### Spawning Time (Equivalent to Transplantation Time)

The ideal time for spawning depends on the specific mushroom species and the environmental conditions required for its growth, particularly temperature and humidity.

*   **Button Mushroom (Agaricus bisporus):**
    *   Requires cooler temperatures for spawn run (20-25°C) and fruiting (14-18°C).
    *   In Haryana, the ideal period for spawning and cultivation is generally from **October to March**, utilizing the cooler winter months.
*   **Oyster Mushroom (Pleurotus spp.):**
    *   Many species are adaptable, with spawn run typically at 20-30°C and fruiting at 18-28°C (depending on the specific strain).
    *   Can be cultivated for a longer duration, often from **September to April**, and even year-round in controlled environments.
*   **Paddy Straw Mushroom (Volvariella volvacea):**
    *   Requires warmer temperatures for spawn run (30-35°C) and fruiting (28-32°C).
    *   In Haryana, the ideal period for spawning and cultivation is during the hot and humid months, typically from **April to September**.

### Spawning Distribution and Rate (Equivalent to Transplantation Distance)

This refers to how the mushroom spawn is incorporated into the prepared substrate.

*   **Button Mushroom:**
    *   **Spawn Rate:** Typically 0.5-0.75% of the wet compost weight (e.g., **5-7.5 kg** of spawn per **1000 kg** of wet compost).
    *   **Distribution Methods:**
        *   **Surface Spawning:** Spawn is spread evenly on the surface of the compost in beds or bags and then covered with a thin layer of compost.
        *   **Through Spawning:** Spawn is thoroughly mixed with the compost before filling the beds or bags. This is a common and effective method.
        *   **Layer Spawning:** Spawn is spread in layers as the compost is filled into the beds or bags.
*   **Oyster Mushroom:**
    *   **Spawn Rate:** Typically 2-5% of the dry substrate weight (e.g., **20-50 g** of spawn per **kg** of dry straw).
    *   **Distribution Methods:**
        *   **Mixing:** The most common method is to thoroughly mix the spawn with the sterilized or pasteurized substrate (e.g., paddy straw, wheat straw) before filling it into polypropylene bags or bottles.
        *   **Layering:** Spawn can also be layered within the substrate as bags are filled.
*   **Paddy Straw Mushroom:**
    *   **Spawn Rate:** Approximately **150-200 g** of spawn per bed (which typically uses 10-15 kg of dry straw).
    *   **Distribution Method:** Spawn is typically placed in small clumps between layers of wet paddy straw bundles as the mushroom bed is constructed.

### Spawning Process (Equivalent to Transplantation Process)

The general process involves several critical steps to ensure successful mushroom growth:

1.  **Substrate Preparation:**
    *   **Button Mushroom:** Involves a detailed composting process (Phase I and Phase II) to create a selective medium for the mushroom.
    *   **Oyster Mushroom:** Substrate (e.g., paddy straw, wheat straw) is chopped, soaked, and then sterilized (autoclaving) or pasteurized (hot water treatment or steam) to eliminate contaminants.
    *   **Paddy Straw Mushroom:** Paddy straw is soaked in water for 12-24 hours and then drained to achieve optimal moisture content.

2.  **Spawn Preparation:**
    *   Ensure the mushroom spawn is fresh, healthy, and free from any contamination (green molds, bacterial blotches).
    *   Break up the grain spawn into individual grains by shaking or gently crushing the bag before use.

3.  **Inoculation (Spawning):**
    *   This is the actual introduction of the spawn into the prepared and cooled substrate.
    *   Maintain strict hygiene during this step to prevent contamination. Work in a clean, disinfected area.
    *   Distribute the spawn evenly according to the chosen method (mixing, layering, or surface spreading) and the recommended rate for the specific mushroom type.

4.  **Incubation (Spawn Run):**
    *   After spawning, the substrate (in bags, beds, or trays) is kept in a dark room with controlled temperature and humidity.
    *   During this phase, the mushroom mycelium grows and colonizes the entire substrate. This typically takes 10-20 days, depending on the mushroom species and environmental conditions.
    *   Maintain optimal temperature and humidity for the specific mushroom species during this period.

5.  **Casing (Specific to Button Mushroom):**
    *   Once the compost is fully colonized by the mycelium (after spawn run), a layer of casing material (a mixture of peat moss, soil, and sand, often sterilized) is applied over the compost.
    *   This casing layer provides a reservoir for moisture and a physical stimulus for fruiting body formation.

6.  **Fruiting/Pinhead Formation:**
    *   After spawn run (and casing for Button mushrooms), environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, CO2 levels, and light for some species) are adjusted to induce the formation of mushroom pinheads, which then develop into mature mushrooms.

By following these scientifically verified practices for spawning, you can achieve successful mushroom cultivation.
