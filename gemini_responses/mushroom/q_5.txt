As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I must provide scientifically accurate information relevant to mushroom cultivation.

Regarding the conditions you've listed for Mushroom:

*   **Scab:** This is not known to affect Mushroom.
*   **Canker:** This is not known to affect Mushroom.
*   **Gummosis:** This is not known to affect Mushroom.
*   **Lichen:** This is not known to affect Mushroom.

These conditions are primarily associated with higher plants (trees, fruits, vegetables) and are not recognized diseases or conditions affecting mushroom crops. Mushrooms have their own specific set of pests, diseases, and physiological disorders.
