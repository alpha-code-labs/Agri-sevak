As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I must provide scientifically verified advice specific to mushroom cultivation.

Regarding the pests you have mentioned:

*   **Borers:** This is not known to affect Mushroom.
*   **Caterpillars:** This is not known to affect Mushroom.
*   **Diamondback moth:** This is not known to affect Mushroom.
*   **Leaf folder:** This is not known to affect Mushroom.

These pests are primarily associated with field crops (vegetables, cereals, etc.) and do not typically infest cultivated mushrooms. Mushroom cultivation faces different sets of pest challenges, mainly from various species of flies (sciarid flies, phorid flies, cecid flies), mites, and sometimes nematodes or slugs.
