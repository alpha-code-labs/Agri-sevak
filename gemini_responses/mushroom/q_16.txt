As a Senior Agronomist, it's crucial to understand the fundamental difference in nutrient management between plants and fungi like mushrooms. Mushrooms are heterotrophic organisms; they do not photosynthesize and do not absorb mineral nutrients directly from the soil in the same way plants do. Instead, they derive all their nutrition from decomposing organic matter.

Therefore, the direct application of mineral fertilizers such as Urea, Nano-Urea, Diammonium Phosphate (DAP), Nano-DAP, NPK complexes, Single Super Phosphate (SSP), Potash (Muriate of Potash or Sulphate of Potash), and elemental Sulphur, as typically used for crop plants, is **not recommended and is not a standard practice in mushroom cultivation.**

Here's why and how mushrooms obtain their nutrients:

*   **Nutrient Source is the Substrate (Compost):** Mushrooms grow on a specially prepared substrate, commonly known as compost. This compost is formulated from various organic materials like wheat straw, paddy straw, chicken manure, gypsum, bran, and other agricultural by-products. These ingredients are carefully mixed, wetted, and undergo a controlled fermentation and pasteurization process.
*   **Compost Provides All Necessary Nutrients:** The compost itself is designed to provide all the necessary macro and micronutrients (including nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, sulphur, calcium, magnesium, and trace elements) in a complex organic form that the mushroom mycelium can break down and absorb. The nutrients are released slowly as the fungi decompose the substrate.
*   **Detrimental Effects of Direct Fertilizer Application:** Applying synthetic mineral fertilizers directly to mushroom beds or compost can be detrimental. It can:
    *   Introduce unwanted microbial contaminants.
    *   Alter the pH of the substrate to an unfavorable range for mushroom growth.
    *   Create high salt concentrations that inhibit mycelial growth and fruiting.
    *   Promote the growth of competitor molds and bacteria rather than the desired mushroom.

In summary, the 'fertilization' for mushrooms is achieved through the careful formulation and preparation of the compost substrate, which inherently contains all the required nutrients in a bioavailable form for the fungi. There are no recommended doses for direct application of the listed mineral fertilizers in mushroom cultivation.
