As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling soil pests in Toria (Brassica rapa subsp. oleifera) in Haryana.

Both termites and root-knot nematodes are significant soil pests that can affect Toria cultivation, leading to reduced plant vigour and yield losses. Integrated pest management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods, is recommended for effective and sustainable control.

### Control of Termites

Termites (Odontotermes obesus, Microtermes obesi) can cause damage by feeding on roots and the base of the stem, especially during dry periods or in fields with high organic matter.

**Symptoms:**
*   Wilting and drying of plants, even with adequate moisture.
*   Hollowed-out stems and roots.
*   Presence of earthen runways or mounds near the plant base.

**Control Measures:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Deep Summer Ploughing:** Exposes termite colonies to the sun and predators, disrupting their nests.
    *   **Removal of Crop Residues:** Termites feed on cellulose, so removing stubble and other organic debris can reduce their food source.
    *   **Proper Irrigation:** Adequate moisture can deter termites, as they prefer drier conditions.

2.  **Chemical Control (Pre-sowing/At Sowing):**
    *   **Soil Treatment:**
        *   Apply **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** at 2.5 Litres per acre mixed with 200-400 Litres of water and drench the soil before sowing or incorporate into the soil during final land preparation.
        *   Alternatively, apply **Fipronil 0.3% GR** at 6-8 kg per acre at the time of sowing by broadcasting and incorporating into the soil.
    *   **Seed Treatment (for early protection):**
        *   Treat seeds with **Imidacloprid 70% WS** at 5-7 grams per kg of seed. This provides systemic protection to seedlings against early termite attack and sucking pests.

### Control of Nematodes (Root-knot Nematodes - Meloidogyne spp.)

Root-knot nematodes are microscopic roundworms that infect plant roots, causing characteristic galls or knots. Toria is susceptible to several species of root-knot nematodes.

**Symptoms:**
*   Stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, and general decline in plant vigour.
*   Wilting during the day, even when soil moisture is adequate.
*   Presence of characteristic swellings or galls on the roots, which can be small or large depending on the severity of infection.
*   Reduced root system efficiency, leading to poor nutrient and water uptake.

**Control Measures:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate Toria with non-host crops like cereals (wheat, maize, sorghum) for at least 2-3 years. Avoid continuous cultivation of susceptible crops.
    *   **Summer Ploughing:** Deep ploughing during hot summer months exposes nematode eggs and larvae to direct sunlight, desiccating and killing them.
    *   **Use of Organic Amendments:** Incorporating well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost at 5-10 tonnes per acre can improve soil health and promote beneficial microorganisms that antagonize nematodes.
    *   **Solarization:** Covering moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets during peak summer for 4-6 weeks can significantly reduce nematode populations in the topsoil.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   **Bio-nematicides:** Apply **Purpureocillium lilacinum** (formerly Paecilomyces lilacinus) at 2.5 kg per acre, mixed with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed FYM or compost, and broadcast evenly before sowing or at the time of sowing. This fungus parasitizes nematode eggs and females.

3.  **Chemical Control (If severe infestation is anticipated):**
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   Apply **Carbofuran 3% GR** at 10-12 kg per acre at the time of sowing by broadcasting and incorporating into the soil. This provides systemic protection against nematodes. *Note: Use this only when other methods are insufficient and follow all safety precautions.*

**General Precautions:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) while handling and applying chemicals.
*   Ensure proper calibration of application equipment for accurate dosage.
*   Avoid applying chemicals during windy conditions to prevent drift.
*   Dispose of empty containers safely as per guidelines.
