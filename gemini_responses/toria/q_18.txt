As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the use of growth regulators/hormones in Toria cultivation in Haryana:

*   **Ethephon** (Ethrel):
    Based on current scientific recommendations for Toria cultivation in Haryana, the use of **Ethephon** as a growth regulator is not a standard practice.

*   **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid** (2,4-D):
    The application of **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid** as a growth regulator is not recommended for Toria. It is primarily a selective herbicide for broadleaf weeds, and its application can be detrimental to the Toria crop itself.

*   **Boron**:
    Boron is an essential micronutrient for Toria, critical for pollen viability, fertilization, and seed set. Its application is highly recommended, especially in boron-deficient soils, to improve yield.

    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray 0.2% solution of **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate) at the flowering stage. This translates to 2 g of **Borax** per litre of water.
    *   **Soil Application (in deficient soils):**
        *   Apply 10 kg of **Borax** per acre at the time of sowing.
