As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I emphasize that addressing micronutrient deficiencies in Toria (Indian Mustard) is crucial for optimal growth and yield. The first and most critical step is always a **soil test** to accurately diagnose the specific deficiency and its severity. This allows for targeted and efficient nutrient management.

**General Principles for Micronutrient Application:**

*   **Soil Application:** Suitable for long-term correction, especially for Zinc and Boron, but can be less efficient for others due to fixation in the soil.
*   **Foliar Application:** Provides a quick response, especially for Iron, Manganese, and Magnesium, as nutrients are directly absorbed by leaves. It is often preferred for correcting acute deficiencies during critical growth stages.
*   **Timing:** Foliar sprays are most effective when applied during active growth phases, typically at the rosette stage, pre-flowering, and early pod development.
*   **Water Volume:** Ensure adequate water volume (e.g., 200-250 L/acre) for thorough coverage during foliar sprays.
*   **Compatibility:** Always check the compatibility of micronutrient sprays if mixing with other pesticides or fertilizers.
*   **Caution:** Over-application of micronutrients, especially Boron, can be toxic. Always adhere to recommended rates.

Here's how to address specific micronutrient deficiencies in Toria:

### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, small and narrow leaves, interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, sometimes purplish discoloration on the underside of leaves.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application (Basal):** Apply 10-25 kg/acre of **Zinc sulfate heptahydrate** (21% Zn) at the time of sowing.
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.5% solution of **Zinc sulfate heptahydrate** (5 g/L water) or 0.1% solution of **Zinc EDTA** (12% Zn) (1 g/L water). Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, starting from the rosette stage.

### 2. Iron (Fe) / Ferrous Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Prominent interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, with veins remaining green. In severe cases, entire leaves may turn pale yellow or white.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Soil application is generally ineffective due to rapid fixation. Spray 0.5-1% solution of **Ferrous sulfate heptahydrate** (19% Fe) (5-10 g/L water) or 0.1-0.2% solution of **Ferrous EDTA** (12% Fe) (1-2 g/L water). Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, especially during active vegetative growth.

### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, thickening and brittleness of leaves, cracking of stems, hollow stems, poor flowering, reduced pollen viability, and poor seed set. Toria is highly sensitive to Boron deficiency.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application (Basal):** Apply 2-4 kg/acre of **Borax (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate)** (10.5% B) at the time of sowing. *Exercise caution as the margin between deficiency and toxicity is narrow.*
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.1-0.2% solution of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (20% B) or **Borax** (1-2 g/L water). Apply at the pre-flowering and early flowering stages to ensure good seed set.

### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, deformed new leaves, tip burn on young leaves, poor root development, and reduced pod filling. Less common as a primary deficiency in Toria in Haryana, often associated with soil pH or water stress.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** For sodic soils, application of **Gypsum (Calcium sulfate dihydrate)** helps improve soil structure and provides calcium. For acidic soils (less common in Haryana), **Calcium carbonate** (lime) can be used.
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.5-1% solution of **Calcium chloride** (5-10 g/L water) or **Calcium nitrate** (5-10 g/L water) during active growth stages.

### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, with veins remaining green. In severe cases, leaves may develop a reddish-purple tint.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application (Basal):** Apply 10-20 kg/acre of **Magnesium sulfate heptahydrate** (9.6% Mg) at the time of sowing.
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.5-1% solution of **Magnesium sulfate heptahydrate** (5-10 g/L water). Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, especially when symptoms appear on older leaves.

### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, often accompanied by small necrotic (dead) spots. Growth may be stunted.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Soil application is generally less effective. Spray 0.5-1% solution of **Manganese sulfate monohydrate** (30.5% Mn) (5-10 g/L water) or 0.1% solution of **Manganese EDTA** (12% Mn) (1 g/L water). Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, particularly during active vegetative growth.

Always integrate these specific recommendations with good agricultural practices, including balanced NPK fertilization and maintaining optimal soil pH, for sustainable crop health and productivity.
