As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following cultivation practices for Toria in Haryana:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   Line sowing is highly recommended for better crop establishment, uniform plant stand, and ease of intercultural operations like weeding and spraying.
    *   Sowing can be done using a seed drill.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   A shallow planting depth of **3-4 cm** is ideal for good germination and emergence of Toria seeds. Avoid deep sowing as it can hinder emergence.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   **Row-to-row spacing:** Maintain a distance of **30 cm** between rows.
    *   **Plant-to-plant spacing:** After emergence, thin the plants to achieve a spacing of **10-15 cm** within the row. This ensures optimal plant population and reduces competition for resources.

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   For line sowing, a seed dose of **1.5 - 2.0 kg/acre** is generally sufficient to achieve the desired plant population after thinning.
