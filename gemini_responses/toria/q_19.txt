Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I emphasize that accurate diagnosis through soil testing is paramount for effective nutrient management. The following recommendations are general guidelines for addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies in Toria, assuming a typical Haryana soil profile and moderate deficiency. Always conduct a soil test for precise recommendations.

### Addressing Macro-nutrient Deficiencies in Toria

**1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency:**
Nitrogen deficiency is common and significantly impacts Toria yield.
*   **Symptoms:** General yellowing of older leaves, stunted growth, reduced branching, poor pod formation, and light green foliage.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Basal Application:** If not applied adequately at sowing, apply 20-30 kg N/acre using **Urea** (approximately 44-66 kg **Urea**/acre).
    *   **Top Dressing:** For existing deficiency or as a supplementary dose, apply 20-30 kg N/acre using **Urea** (approximately 44-66 kg **Urea**/acre) at the first irrigation or at the rosette stage/flowering initiation.
    *   **Foliar Spray (for quick relief/mild deficiency):** Spray a 1-2% **Urea** solution (10-20 g **Urea**/L water). Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, ensuring complete leaf coverage.

**2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency:**
Phosphorus is crucial for root development, flowering, and seed formation in Toria.
*   **Symptoms:** Purplish discoloration of older leaves, stunted growth, delayed maturity, poor root development, and reduced flowering and pod set.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Basal Application:** Phosphorus is best applied at sowing as it is less mobile in the soil. Apply 12-16 kg P2O5/acre using:
        *   **Single Superphosphate** (SSP): Approximately 75-100 kg **Single Superphosphate**/acre.
        *   **Diammonium Phosphate** (DAP): Approximately 26-35 kg **Diammonium Phosphate**/acre.
    *   **Foliar Spray (for mild deficiency/supplement):** While less effective than soil application for severe deficiency, a foliar spray can provide quick relief. Spray a 0.5-1% solution of **Monoammonium Phosphate** (MAP) or **Potassium Dihydrogen Phosphate** (MKP) (5-10 g/L water).

**3. Potassium (K) Deficiency:**
Potassium enhances disease resistance, water use efficiency, and seed quality in Toria.
*   **Symptoms:** Yellowing and browning/scorching of leaf margins (especially older leaves), weak stems, poor disease resistance, and shriveled seeds.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Basal Application:** If soil test indicates deficiency, apply 8-12 kg K2O/acre using **Muriate of Potash** (MOP) (approximately 13-20 kg **Muriate of Potash**/acre) at the time of sowing.
    *   **Foliar Spray (for quick relief/mild deficiency):** Spray a 0.5-1% solution of **Potassium Nitrate** or **Potassium Dihydrogen Phosphate** (MKP) (5-10 g/L water).

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Soil Testing:** Always prioritize soil testing to determine the exact nutrient status and tailor recommendations.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management (INM):** Combine chemical fertilizers with organic manures (Farm Yard Manure, compost, vermicompost) and bio-fertilizers (e.g., PSB for phosphorus) for sustainable soil health and nutrient availability.
*   **Application Method:** Ensure uniform application of fertilizers. For foliar sprays, use appropriate spray volume to ensure good coverage and avoid spraying during hot periods of the day.
*   **Water Management:** Adequate soil moisture is essential for nutrient uptake by plants. Ensure proper irrigation practices.
