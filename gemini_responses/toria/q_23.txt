As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified seed and soil treatment processes for Toria cultivation in Haryana to ensure robust plant establishment and minimize early-season challenges:

### Seed Treatment Process for Toria

Seed treatment is crucial for protecting young seedlings from soil-borne diseases and early insect pests, leading to better germination and stand establishment.

1.  **Fungicidal Seed Treatment (for Damping-off, Seedling Blight, and early White Rust):**
    *   Apply one of the following fungicides to the seeds before sowing:
        *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 1.0-1.5 g per kg of seed.
        *   **Tebuconazole** 2% DS at 1.0-1.5 g per kg of seed.
        *   Alternatively, a combination of **Carbendazim** 12% + **Mancozeb** 63% WP at 2.0-2.5 g per kg of seed can be used for broader spectrum protection.

2.  **Insecticidal Seed Treatment (for Mustard Sawfly, Painted Bug, and early Aphids):**
    *   After fungicidal treatment (or simultaneously if using a combination product), apply an insecticide:
        *   **Imidacloprid** 70% WS at 5-7 g per kg of seed.
        *   Alternatively, **Thiamethoxam** 70% WS at 3-5 g per kg of seed.

    *   **Method:** Mix the recommended quantity of fungicide and insecticide thoroughly with the seeds using a seed treatment drum or by spreading the seeds on a clean surface and mixing them with gloved hands until uniformly coated. Allow the seeds to dry slightly in the shade before sowing.

### Soil Treatment Process for Toria

Soil treatment primarily focuses on weed management and enhancing soil health.

1.  **Pre-emergence Herbicide Application (for Weed Control):**
    *   To control a wide spectrum of annual grasses and broadleaf weeds, apply a pre-emergence herbicide within 0-3 days after sowing, but before weed emergence.
        *   **Pendimethalin** 30% EC at 1.0-1.25 kg active ingredient per acre (equivalent to 3.3-4.2 L of product per acre) mixed in 200-250 L of water. Ensure uniform spray coverage over the entire field.

2.  **Bio-fungicide/Bio-pesticide Soil Application (for Soil Health and Disease Suppression - Optional but Recommended):**
    *   To enhance soil health and suppress soil-borne pathogens, consider applying beneficial microbial agents:
        *   **Trichoderma viride** (2.5 kg per acre) or **Pseudomonas fluorescens** (2.5 kg per acre) mixed with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost. This mixture should be broadcast evenly and incorporated into the soil before sowing.

3.  **Nutrient Management (as part of overall soil preparation):**
    *   While not a "treatment" in the chemical sense, ensuring adequate soil fertility is paramount. Based on soil test reports, apply recommended doses of Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium. For Toria, a general recommendation for Haryana is 60 kg Nitrogen, 30 kg Phosphorus (P2O5), and 20 kg Potassium (K2O) per acre. Apply all Phosphorus and Potassium, and half of the Nitrogen as a basal dose at the time of sowing. The remaining half of Nitrogen should be top-dressed at the first irrigation (around 30-35 days after sowing).

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label for safe and effective use.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Ensure proper calibration of sprayers for accurate herbicide application.
