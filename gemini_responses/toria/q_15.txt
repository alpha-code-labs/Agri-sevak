As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Toria cultivation in Haryana:

It is crucial to regularly monitor your Toria crop for pest incidence. Early detection and timely intervention are key to effective pest management. Always follow label instructions for any chemical application and observe pre-harvest intervals.

### General Agronomic Practices for Pest Management:
*   **Field Sanitation:** Keep the field and surrounding areas free of weeds and crop residues, which can harbor pests.
*   **Deep Summer Ploughing:** This helps expose and destroy eggs and pupae of soil-borne pests.
*   **Timely Sowing:** Adhering to recommended sowing times can help the crop escape peak pest activity.

### Specific Control Measures:

#### Grasshopper
Grasshoppers can cause significant defoliation, especially in young Toria plants.
*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Deep ploughing during summer to expose egg pods to predators and desiccation.
    *   Clean cultivation and removal of weeds from field bunds and surrounding areas.
*   **Chemical Control (Foliar spray when nymphs/adults are observed causing economic damage):**
    *   **Malathion** 50% EC at 1.0-1.25 L/acre in 200-250 L of water.
    *   **Quinalphos** 25% EC at 600-800 ml/acre in 200-250 L of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 100-120 ml/acre in 200-250 L of water.

#### Painted Bug (Bagrada hilaris)
The Painted Bug is a major pest of cruciferous crops like Toria, causing damage by sucking sap from leaves, stems, and pods, leading to wilting, stunted growth, and shrivelled seeds.
*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Remove cruciferous weeds (e.g., wild mustard, radish) from the field and surrounding areas, as they serve as alternate hosts.
    *   Early sowing can sometimes help escape severe infestation.
*   **Chemical Control (Foliar spray upon appearance of nymphs and adults, especially at seedling and pod formation stages):**
    *   **Dimethoate** 30% EC at 400 ml/acre in 200-250 L of water.
    *   **Methyl demeton** 25% EC at 400 ml/acre in 200-250 L of water.
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL at 50-60 ml/acre in 200-250 L of water.
    *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG at 40 g/acre in 200-250 L of water.

#### Red Cotton Bug
This is not known to affect Toria significantly to warrant specific control measures.

#### Black Ants
This is not known to affect Toria. Black ants are generally not direct pests of Toria and often have a neutral or beneficial role (e.g., preying on other insects). If they are present in large numbers, it might indicate the presence of honeydew-producing pests like aphids, in which case controlling the primary pest would be the appropriate action.
