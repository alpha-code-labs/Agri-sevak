As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling borers, caterpillars, Diamondback moth, and leaf folders in Toria (Indian Mustard/Rapeseed) in Haryana. These pests are primarily lepidopteran in nature and often require similar management strategies.

Effective management involves regular field monitoring and timely intervention.

### Control Measures for Borers, Caterpillars, Diamondback Moth, and Leaf Folder in Toria:

For the control of these lepidopteran pests, including stem borers, pod borers, various defoliating caterpillars (e.g., tobacco caterpillar, cabbage semilooper, mustard sawfly larvae), Diamondback moth (DBM) larvae, and leaf folders, the following CIBRC-approved insecticides can be used. Always ensure thorough spray coverage for best results.

1.  **Early Stage Pests (e.g., Mustard Sawfly, early caterpillars, DBM):**
    *   **Quinalphos 25% EC:** Apply at 500-600 ml per acre in 200-250 litres of water. This is effective against mustard sawfly larvae and other early defoliators.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** Apply at 100-120 ml per acre in 200-250 litres of water. Effective against a broad spectrum of caterpillars and DBM.

2.  **Advanced Stage Pests / Specific Lepidopteran Pests (Borers, DBM, Leaf Folder, Pod Borer, other Caterpillars):**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** Apply at 60 ml per acre in 200-250 litres of water. Highly effective against DBM, stem borer, pod borer, and various caterpillars.
    *   **Emamectin Benzoate 5% SG:** Apply at 88-100 g per acre in 200-250 litres of water. Provides excellent control of DBM, pod borer, leaf folder, and other caterpillars.
    *   **Indoxacarb 14.5% SC:** Apply at 200 ml per acre in 200-250 litres of water. Effective against DBM, semiloopers, and pod borers.
    *   **Flubendiamide 20% WG:** Apply at 50 g per acre in 200-250 litres of water. Provides good control of DBM, pod borer, and semiloopers.
    *   **Novaluron 10% EC:** Apply at 300 ml per acre in 200-250 litres of water. An insect growth regulator effective against DBM and semiloopers.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Monitoring:** Regularly scout your fields, especially during the vegetative and flowering stages, to detect pest infestations early.
*   **Rotation of Chemicals:** To prevent the development of insecticide resistance, it is crucial to rotate insecticides with different modes of action. Do not use the same chemical repeatedly.
*   **Timing of Application:** Apply insecticides when pest populations reach economic threshold levels. Early morning or late evening sprays are recommended to minimize impact on pollinators and maximize efficacy.
*   **Water Volume:** Ensure adequate water volume (200-250 litres per acre) for thorough coverage of the plant canopy, especially the undersides of leaves where pests often hide.
*   **Safety Precautions:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying. Follow all instructions on the product label regarding dosage, application, and safety.
*   **Integrated Pest Management (IPM):** Incorporate cultural practices (e.g., timely sowing, field sanitation), biological control (e.g., conservation of natural enemies), and host plant resistance along with judicious chemical use for sustainable pest management.
