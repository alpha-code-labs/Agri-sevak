As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling viral diseases in Toria:

Firstly, it is important to clarify the relevance of the listed conditions to Toria:

*   **Tristeza virus:** This is not known to affect Toria. Tristeza virus is primarily a pathogen of citrus crops.
*   **Stripe virus:** This is not known to affect Toria. The term 'Stripe virus' is generally associated with cereal crops (e.g., Maize Stripe Virus).

For the other viral diseases such as **Leaf curl, Mosaic, Yellow vein clearing, and Stunt virus** in Toria, these are primarily caused by viruses like Turnip Mosaic Virus (TuMV) and Cauliflower Mosaic Virus (CaMV). There is no direct chemical cure for viral infections once a plant is infected. Therefore, management strategies focus on prevention, controlling the insect vectors, and implementing sound cultural practices.

**Integrated Management Strategies for Viral Diseases in Toria:**

1.  **Vector Control:**
    Aphids are the primary vectors for most Brassica viruses. Controlling aphid populations is crucial to prevent the spread of these diseases.

    *   **Seed Treatment (for early protection against vectors):**
        *   **Imidacloprid** 70 WS: 7-10 g per kg of seed.
        *   **Thiamethoxam** 70 WS: 4.2 g per kg of seed.

    *   **Foliar Spray (upon appearance of aphid populations):**
        *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8 SL: 125 ml per acre (diluted in 200-300 L water).
        *   **Thiamethoxam** 25 WG: 50 g per acre (diluted in 200-300 L water).
        *   **Acetamiprid** 20 SP: 80-100 g per acre (diluted in 200-300 L water).
        *   **Flonicamid** 50 WG: 60 g per acre (diluted in 200-300 L water).
        *   **Spirotetramat** 150 OD: 200 ml per acre (diluted in 200-300 L water).
        *   **Dimethoate** 30 EC: 660 ml per acre (diluted in 200-300 L water).
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5 EC: 100-125 ml per acre (diluted in 200-300 L water).

2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Use Certified Seeds:** Always use certified, healthy, and virus-free seeds from reliable sources.
    *   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available, cultivate Toria varieties known to have resistance or tolerance to common Brassica viruses prevalent in the region.
    *   **Sanitation:** Promptly remove and destroy (burn or bury deep) any infected plants showing symptoms to prevent further spread.
    *   **Weed Management:** Control weeds in and around the Toria field, as many weeds can act as alternate hosts for both the viruses and their insect vectors.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops to break the disease cycle.
    *   **Timely Sowing:** Sow Toria at the recommended time to avoid peak vector populations and high disease incidence periods.
    *   **Nutrient and Water Management:** Maintain optimal plant nutrition and irrigation to enhance plant vigor, making them more resilient to stress and potential infections.
    *   **Barrier Crops:** Planting non-host barrier crops (e.g., maize, sorghum) around the Toria field can sometimes reduce the movement of insect vectors into the main crop.

Always follow the label instructions for application rates, safety precautions, and pre-harvest intervals for any chemical used. Regular field monitoring is essential to detect early signs of aphid infestation or disease symptoms for timely intervention.
