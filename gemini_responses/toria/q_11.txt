As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies in Toria in Haryana:

**Pests Affecting Toria:**

1.  **Sawflies:** The Mustard Sawfly (*Athalia lugens proxima*) is a significant pest of Toria, especially during the seedling stage.
2.  **Beetles:** Flea beetles (*Phyllotreta spp.*) can cause damage, particularly to young Toria plants.

**Regarding Weevils:**
Weevils, such as stem weevils or pod weevils, are generally **not known to be a major economic pest of Toria in Haryana** requiring specific widespread chemical control measures.

**Control Measures for Mustard Sawfly and Flea Beetles:**

For effective management of Mustard Sawfly and Flea Beetles, especially during early crop stages, regular monitoring is crucial. If the pest incidence crosses the economic threshold level (ETL), chemical intervention may be necessary.

**Recommended Insecticides (CIBRC approved for Mustard/Rapeseed):**

*   **Malathion** 50% EC: Apply at a rate of 1.0 - 1.25 L per acre, mixed in 500 L of water.
*   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: Apply at a rate of 100 - 120 ml per acre, mixed in 200-400 L of water.
*   **Quinalphos** 25% EC: Apply at a rate of 500 ml per acre, mixed in 200-400 L of water.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always ensure thorough coverage of the foliage during spraying.
*   Follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions mentioned on the product label.
*   Observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) for the chosen insecticide.
*   Integrated Pest Management (IPM) practices, including cultural methods (e.g., timely sowing, field sanitation) and biological control, should always be prioritized for sustainable pest management.
