Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I advise on the control of fungal diseases in Toria (Indian Rapeseed/Mustard). Effective management relies on an integrated approach combining cultural practices with timely and judicious application of scientifically approved fungicides.

### General Management Practices for Fungal Diseases in Toria:

*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available, choose Toria varieties known for resistance or tolerance to common fungal diseases.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice a 2-3 year crop rotation with non-host crops (e.g., cereals like wheat or maize) to break the disease cycle.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected crop debris after harvest to reduce inoculum for the next season.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure balanced fertilization, avoiding excessive nitrogen, which can make plants more susceptible to certain diseases.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Maintain optimal plant spacing to ensure good air circulation within the canopy, reducing humidity and fungal growth.
*   **Timely Sowing:** Sow Toria at the recommended time to avoid periods of high disease pressure.
*   **Weed Control:** Manage weeds effectively as they can act as alternate hosts for some pathogens.

### Specific Fungal Diseases and Their Control in Toria:

Here's how to control the mentioned fungal diseases:

#### 1. Alternaria (Leaf Spot, Blight, Brown Spot)

*Alternaria brassicae* and *Alternaria brassicicola* are common pathogens causing leaf spots, blight, and brown spot symptoms in Toria.

*   **Foliar Spray:**
    *   **Mancozeb 75% WP:** Apply at 2.5 kg/acre (mixed in 500 litres of water) or 5 g/litre of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:** Apply at 200 ml/acre (mixed in 200-400 litres of water) or 0.5-1.0 ml/litre of water.
    *   **Propiconazole 25% EC:** Apply at 200 ml/acre (mixed in 200-400 litres of water) or 0.5 ml/litre of water.
    *   **Tebuconazole 25.9% EC:** Apply at 200-300 ml/acre (mixed in 200-400 litres of water) or 0.5-0.75 ml/litre of water.
    *   **Difenoconazole 25% EC:** Apply at 100 ml/acre (mixed in 200-400 litres of water) or 0.25 ml/litre of water.
*   Initiate spraying at the appearance of initial symptoms and repeat at 10-15 day intervals if disease pressure persists.

#### 2. Anthracnose

While less common as a major disease in Toria compared to Alternaria, *Colletotrichum* species can cause anthracnose.

*   **Foliar Spray:**
    *   **Mancozeb 75% WP:** Apply at 2.5 kg/acre (mixed in 500 litres of water) or 5 g/litre of water.
    *   **Carbendazim 50% WP:** Apply at 250-500 g/acre (mixed in 200-400 litres of water) or 0.5-1.0 g/litre of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:** Apply at 200 ml/acre (mixed in 200-400 litres of water) or 0.5-1.0 ml/litre of water.

#### 3. Blast

This is not known to affect Toria.

#### 4. Downy Mildew

Caused by *Hyaloperonospora brassicae*, this disease is characterized by white, fluffy growth on the underside of leaves and yellow spots on the upper surface.

*   **Foliar Spray:**
    *   **Mancozeb 75% WP:** Apply at 2.5 kg/acre (mixed in 500 litres of water) or 5 g/litre of water.
    *   **Metalaxyl 8% + Mancozeb 64% WP:** Apply at 500 g/acre (mixed in 200-400 litres of water) or 2.0 g/litre of water.
    *   **Cymoxanil 8% + Mancozeb 64% WP:** Apply at 500 g/acre (mixed in 200-400 litres of water) or 2.0 g/litre of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:** Apply at 200 ml/acre (mixed in 200-400 litres of water) or 0.5-1.0 ml/litre of water.
*   Begin spraying when symptoms first appear, especially during cool, moist weather conditions.

#### 5. Powdery Mildew

Caused by *Erysiphe cruciferarum*, this disease appears as white, powdery patches on leaves, stems, and pods.

*   **Foliar Spray:**
    *   **Sulphur 80% WP:** Apply at 2.0 kg/acre (mixed in 400-500 litres of water) or 3.0-4.0 g/litre of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:** Apply at 200 ml/acre (mixed in 200-400 litres of water) or 0.5-1.0 ml/litre of water.
    *   **Tebuconazole 25.9% EC:** Apply at 200-300 ml/acre (mixed in 200-400 litres of water) or 0.5-0.75 ml/litre of water.
    *   **Difenoconazole 25% EC:** Apply at 100 ml/acre (mixed in 200-400 litres of water) or 0.25 ml/litre of water.
*   Apply at the first sign of the disease and repeat if necessary.

#### 6. Grey Mildew

This is not known to affect Toria.

### Important Considerations:

*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always observe the recommended pre-harvest interval (PHI) for each chemical to ensure the safety of the produce. This information is usually provided on the product label.
*   **Safety Precautions:** Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (gloves, mask, protective clothing) while handling and spraying chemicals.
*   **Spray Coverage:** Ensure thorough coverage of the plant foliage for effective disease control.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of fungicide resistance.
