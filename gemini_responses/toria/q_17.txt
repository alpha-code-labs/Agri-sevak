As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), here are the recommended doses of organic manures for Toria cultivation in Haryana:

*   **Farm Yard Manure (FYM):**
    *   **Dose:** 10-15 tonnes per acre.
    *   **Application:** Apply 2-3 weeks before sowing and thoroughly incorporate into the soil during field preparation. This improves soil structure, water holding capacity, and provides essential nutrients.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 tonnes per acre.
    *   **Application:** Can be applied at the time of final field preparation and incorporated into the soil. It is a more nutrient-rich alternative or supplement to FYM.

*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract):**
    *   **Granular (Soil Application):**
        *   **Dose:** 8-10 kg per acre.
        *   **Application:** Apply at the time of sowing or within 15-20 days after sowing, broadcasted and lightly incorporated into the soil.
    *   **Liquid (Foliar Spray):**
        *   **Dose:** 2-3 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Application:** Apply as a foliar spray at critical growth stages, typically at the branching stage (25-30 days after sowing) and again at the pre-flowering stage (45-50 days after sowing). This acts as a bio-stimulant, promoting better growth and yield.
