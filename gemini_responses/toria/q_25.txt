As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following irrigation management practices for Toria in Haryana:

Toria (Brassica rapa subsp. oleifera var. toria) is a short-duration oilseed crop. While it is relatively less water-intensive than some other crops, timely and adequate irrigation at critical growth stages is crucial for maximizing yield and oil content, especially under Haryana's climatic conditions where winter rains can be erratic.

**Irrigation Management for Toria:**

*   **First Irrigation:**
    *   The most critical stage for the first irrigation is during the **branching and flowering initiation stage**, typically around **25-30 days after sowing (DAS)**.
    *   Water stress during this period can severely impact branching, flower development, and ultimately, the number of pods and seeds per plant.
    *   If the soil moisture is insufficient at sowing, a pre-sowing irrigation (palewa) might be necessary to ensure good germination and stand establishment.

*   **Second Irrigation:**
    *   A second irrigation may be required, particularly if there is a prolonged dry spell or insufficient winter rainfall, and if the soil type has low water retention capacity.
    *   If needed, the second irrigation should be applied at the **pod formation and seed filling stage**, usually around **45-55 DAS**.
    *   Providing adequate moisture during this stage ensures proper development of seeds, improves seed weight, and enhances oil content.
    *   Avoid excessive irrigation, especially during the later stages, as it can lead to lodging and increased susceptibility to diseases.

*   **Sprinkler Use:**
    *   Sprinkler irrigation is a highly efficient method for irrigating Toria and is strongly recommended, especially in areas with limited water availability or on lighter soils (sandy loams) prevalent in parts of Haryana.
    *   **Benefits of Sprinkler Irrigation:**
        *   **Water Saving:** Significantly reduces water consumption compared to traditional flood irrigation, often saving 30-50% of water.
        *   **Uniform Water Distribution:** Ensures even application of water across the field, leading to uniform crop growth and yield.
        *   **Reduced Runoff and Leaching:** Minimizes water loss through surface runoff and deep percolation, especially on undulating terrains or sandy soils.
        *   **Improved Nutrient Use Efficiency:** Prevents leaching of soluble nutrients, making them more available to the crop.
        *   **Suitable for Light Soils:** Ideal for sandy soils where flood irrigation is inefficient due to high infiltration rates.
        *   **Flexibility:** Can be used for applying small, frequent irrigations as per crop needs.

**General Recommendations:**

*   Assess soil moisture status before each irrigation. A simple hand-feel method or tensiometers can be used.
*   Avoid waterlogging at any stage, as Toria is sensitive to excessive moisture, which can lead to root rot and other issues.
*   The exact timing and number of irrigations will depend on soil type, rainfall received, and prevailing weather conditions.
