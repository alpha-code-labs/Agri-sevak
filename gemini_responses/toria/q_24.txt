Toria (Brassica rapa var. toria) is generally a short-duration crop that is **not typically transplanted**. Direct seeding is the standard and recommended practice for Toria cultivation in Haryana due to its rapid growth cycle and to avoid transplant shock, which can significantly reduce yield and delay maturity.

Therefore, there is no ideal transplantation time, distance, or process for Toria as it is not a recommended practice.

However, to provide you with the most relevant and scientifically verified advice for successful Toria cultivation, here are the recommendations for **direct seeding**:

**1. Ideal Sowing Time (equivalent to your query about "Transplantation time"):**
*   The optimal sowing window for Toria in Haryana is from **mid-September to early October**.
*   Early sowing (mid-September) is generally preferred to ensure the crop matures before severe winter frosts and to allow timely vacation of the field for subsequent Rabi crops like wheat.

**2. Ideal Sowing Distance (equivalent to your query about "Transplantation distance"):**
*   **Row-to-row distance:** Maintain a spacing of **30 cm** between rows.
*   **Plant-to-plant distance:** After germination, thin the seedlings to achieve a plant-to-plant distance of **10-15 cm**. This ensures adequate space for individual plant development and reduces competition for nutrients and light.

**3. Ideal Sowing Process (equivalent to your query about "Transplantation process"):**
*   **Seedbed Preparation:** Prepare a fine, firm, and moist seedbed. One deep ploughing followed by 2-3 harrowing operations is usually sufficient. Planking should be done to ensure a level field and good seed-to-soil contact.
*   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds with a suitable fungicide (e.g., **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 2 g/kg seed or **Thiram** 75% WS at 2.5 g/kg seed) to protect against seed-borne diseases and improve germination.
*   **Sowing Method:** Seeds should be sown directly in rows using a seed drill.
*   **Sowing Depth:** The ideal sowing depth is **2-3 cm**. Shallow sowing ensures quick emergence.
*   **Seed Rate:** Use a seed rate of **4-5 kg/acre** for pure stands.
*   **Thinning:** Thinning is crucial and should be done 10-15 days after emergence to achieve the recommended plant-to-plant spacing. This helps in maintaining an optimum plant population.
