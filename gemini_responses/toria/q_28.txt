As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the critical importance of protecting Toria (Indian Mustard) from adverse environmental conditions to ensure optimal yield and quality. Here is scientifically verified advice for managing environmental stress in Toria in Haryana:

### Protecting Toria from Environmental Stress

**1. Extreme Cold and Frost:**
Toria is particularly susceptible to frost damage, especially during flowering and pod development stages.

*   **Timely Irrigation:** Apply a light irrigation to the field in the late afternoon or evening before an expected frost event. Water has a higher specific heat capacity and releases latent heat as it cools, which can raise the ambient temperature around the plants by 1-2°C, protecting them from freezing. Ensure the soil is moist but not waterlogged.
*   **Foliar Spray of Thiourea:**
    *   Spray a 0.05% solution of **Thiourea** (500 grams of Thiourea dissolved in 1000 litres of water per hectare) when frost is anticipated or immediately after a cold spell. This acts as a cryoprotectant and helps plants tolerate cold stress.
*   **Foliar Spray of Potassium Nitrate:**
    *   A 1-2% solution of **Potassium Nitrate** (1-2 kg dissolved in 100 litres of water) can be sprayed on the foliage. Potassium helps in maintaining cell turgor and improves the plant's ability to withstand cold stress.
*   **Smudging/Smoking (Traditional Method):** In small fields, creating smoke by burning farm waste (like crop residues, dry leaves) on the upwind side of the field during late night/early morning hours can create a smoke blanket, trapping heat and preventing frost. This is labour-intensive and less practical for large areas.

**2. Heat (Loo) and Intense Sunlight:**
High temperatures, especially accompanied by hot, dry winds (Loo) during the reproductive stages, can lead to flower drop, poor pod setting, and reduced seed filling. Intense sunlight often exacerbates heat stress.

*   **Timely Irrigation:** Ensure adequate soil moisture, especially during critical growth stages like flowering and pod development. Irrigation helps in evaporative cooling of the plant canopy and maintains turgor, reducing the impact of heat stress. Avoid water stress during peak heat periods.
*   **Mulching:** Apply a layer of organic mulch (e.g., wheat straw, paddy straw, or other crop residues) between rows. Mulching helps in:
    *   Reducing soil temperature.
    *   Conserving soil moisture by reducing evaporation.
    *   Suppressing weed growth.
*   **Foliar Spray of Potassium Nitrate:**
    *   Spray a 1-2% solution of **Potassium Nitrate** (1-2 kg dissolved in 100 litres of water) during periods of anticipated heat stress. Potassium helps in osmotic adjustment, improves water use efficiency, and enhances the plant's tolerance to heat and drought stress.
*   **Planting Density:** Maintain optimal plant spacing. Overly dense stands can increase competition for water and nutrients, making plants more susceptible to heat stress.

By implementing these scientifically backed strategies, farmers can significantly mitigate the adverse effects of environmental stresses on Toria cultivation in Haryana, leading to healthier crops and better yields.
