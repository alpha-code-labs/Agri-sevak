This is not known to affect Toria.

Fruit flies (Tephritidae family) are primarily pests of fruit crops like mango, guava, citrus, and cucurbits, where they damage the developing fruits. Toria is an oilseed crop, and its economic part is the siliqua (pod), not a fleshy fruit typically targeted by fruit flies.

Ber fly (**_Carpomyia vesuviana_**) is a highly specific pest of Ber (**_Ziziphus mauritiana_**) and does not affect Toria.
