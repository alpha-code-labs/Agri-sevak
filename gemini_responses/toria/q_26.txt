As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), here is the information regarding specialized practices in Toria cultivation:

*   **Pruning:** This is not known to affect Toria. Toria (Brassica rapa subsp. oleifera var. toria) is an annual oilseed crop with a growth habit that does not typically require pruning for yield enhancement or plant management.
*   **Desuckering:** This is not known to affect Toria. Toria does not produce suckers in a manner that would necessitate desuckering.
*   **Mulching:** Mulching is generally not considered a specialized practice for Toria cultivation in Haryana. While it can aid in soil moisture conservation and weed suppression, the close spacing of Toria in typical field conditions makes its application less common compared to wider-spaced crops.
*   **Grafting:** This is not known to affect Toria. Grafting is not a practice used in Toria cultivation.
*   **Pollination:** Toria is primarily self-pollinated, but insect pollination, particularly by bees, significantly enhances seed set and yield. Therefore, promoting pollinator activity by placing beehives near Toria fields can be considered a beneficial management practice to optimize yield, rather than a direct manual intervention like pruning or grafting.
