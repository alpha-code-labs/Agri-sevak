As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding Toria:

### Maturity Signs for Toria

*   **Pod Colour Change:** The pods (siliquae) on the main stem and primary branches begin to turn yellowish-brown.
*   **Leaf Senescence:** Lower leaves start yellowing and shedding. The overall plant canopy begins to change from green to yellowish.
*   **Seed Hardness and Colour:** Seeds inside the pods become firm and hard, changing their colour from green to dark brown or black, depending on the variety.
*   **Moisture Content:** The physiological maturity is reached when the seed moisture content is around 30-40%, but harvesting is typically done when it drops further.

### Harvesting Time for Toria

*   **Days After Sowing (DAS):** Toria is generally ready for harvest between 90-110 days after sowing, depending on the variety and prevailing agro-climatic conditions.
*   **Pod Maturity Percentage:** The ideal time for harvesting is when 70-75% of the pods on the plant have turned yellow to yellowish-brown, and the seeds inside are firm and mature.
*   **Moisture Content at Harvest:** For manual harvesting, the crop is typically harvested when the seed moisture content is around 25-30%. For mechanical harvesting, it might be slightly lower.
*   **Avoid Over-maturity:** Harvesting at the correct time is crucial to minimize shattering losses, which can be significant if the crop is allowed to become over-mature and dry in the field.

### Cutting Process for Toria

*   **Manual Harvesting:**
    *   Plants are cut close to the ground level using sickles.
    *   Care should be taken to handle the cut plants gently to prevent shattering of mature pods.
    *   The harvested plants are then tied into small bundles.
*   **Curing/Drying:**
    *   The bundles are stacked upright in the field for 3-4 days to allow for uniform drying (curing) and further reduction in seed moisture content. This also helps in the complete maturity of any immature seeds.
*   **Mechanical Harvesting:**
    *   While combine harvesters can be used, they are often associated with higher shattering losses in Toria due to its indeterminate growth habit and asynchronous pod maturity.
    *   For mechanical harvesting, the crop needs to be uniformly dry. Sometimes, windrowing (cutting the crop and laying it in rows to dry) followed by combining is practiced to reduce shattering and ensure uniform drying.
*   **Threshing:** After proper drying, the bundles are threshed either manually (by beating with sticks) or using a thresher to separate the seeds from the pods and stalks.
