As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for improving yield, seed quality, and storage life for Toria (Brassica rapa subsp. oleifera var. toria) in Haryana.

### Improving Yield for Toria

To maximize Toria yield, focus on optimal agronomic practices and timely management:

*   **Variety Selection:** Choose high-yielding, disease-resistant varieties recommended for Haryana's agro-climatic conditions. Consult HAU's latest recommendations for suitable varieties.
*   **Timely Sowing:** Sow Toria within its optimal window, typically from the last week of September to the second week of October. Early sowing helps avoid terminal heat stress during pod development.
*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Nitrogen (N):** Apply 60 kg of Nitrogen per acre. Apply half at sowing and the remaining half at the first irrigation (around 30-35 days after sowing).
    *   **Phosphorus (P):** Apply 20 kg of Phosphorus (P2O5) per acre at the time of sowing.
    *   **Potassium (K):** Apply 10 kg of Potassium (K2O) per acre at the time of sowing, especially on light-textured soils or where soil tests indicate deficiency.
    *   **Sulphur (S):** Crucial for oilseed crops. Apply 20 kg of Sulphur per acre at sowing, either through **Gypsum** (125 kg/acre) or **Bentonite Sulphur** (20 kg/acre).
    *   **Boron (B):** Deficiency can severely impact pod setting. If deficiency is suspected or soil tests indicate low Boron, apply 1 kg of **Borax** per acre at sowing or foliar spray 0.2% **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (2 g/L water) at pre-flowering stage.
    *   **Zinc (Zn):** If soil tests indicate deficiency, apply 10 kg of **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** per acre at sowing once every 2-3 years.
*   **Irrigation:** Toria is a short-duration crop but benefits from 1-2 irrigations. The most critical stages are flowering and pod development. Provide the first irrigation around 30-35 days after sowing and the second if needed during pod filling, depending on soil moisture and rainfall.
*   **Weed Management:** Control weeds effectively, especially during the initial 30-45 days after sowing.
    *   Pre-emergence application of **Pendimethalin** at 1.0 kg active ingredient per acre (e.g., 3.3 L of 30% EC formulation in 200 L water) within 2 days of sowing.
    *   One hand weeding around 25-30 days after sowing can also be highly effective.
*   **Pest and Disease Management:**
    *   **Aphids:** Monitor regularly. If infestation is severe, spray **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG at 40 g per acre or **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL at 50-70 ml per acre in 200 L water.
    *   **Alternaria Blight/White Rust:** If symptoms appear, spray **Mancozeb** 75% WP at 500 g per acre or **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC at 200 ml per acre in 200 L water.
*   **Pollination:** Ensure adequate pollinator activity (e.g., by placing bee boxes) as Toria is an insect-pollinated crop.

### Improving Seed Quality (Fruit Quality) for Toria

For Toria, "fruit quality" refers to the quality of the seeds, specifically oil content, seed size, and overall health.

*   **Sulphur Application:** Adequate Sulphur (as mentioned above, 20 kg/acre) is paramount as it directly influences oil synthesis and protein content in oilseeds.
*   **Boron Application:** Ensure sufficient Boron (as mentioned above) for proper seed development and filling, leading to bolder seeds.
*   **Timely Harvest:** Harvest the crop when 70-75% of the pods turn yellowish-brown and seeds are firm. Delaying harvest can lead to shattering losses and reduced oil quality due to over-ripening.
*   **Avoid Stress:** Minimize drought or heat stress during the critical seed-filling period through timely irrigation.
*   **Pest and Disease Control:** Healthy plants produce higher quality seeds. Effective management of pests and diseases prevents damage to developing seeds.

### Improving Storage Life for Toria

Proper post-harvest handling and storage are crucial to maintain seed viability and oil quality.

*   **Proper Drying:** This is the most critical step. Dry Toria seeds thoroughly to a safe moisture content of 8-9% before storage. High moisture content promotes mold growth, insect infestation, and rapid deterioration of oil quality (e.g., increased free fatty acids).
*   **Cleaning:** Thoroughly clean the harvested seeds to remove chaff, weed seeds, broken seeds, and other foreign matter. This reduces the inoculum for molds and hiding places for storage pests.
*   **Cooling:** If possible, cool the seeds before storage. Lower temperatures significantly extend storage life.
*   **Storage Structures:**
    *   Store seeds in clean, dry, well-ventilated, and pest-proof godowns or containers.
    *   Use airtight containers (e.g., metal bins, plastic drums) for smaller quantities to prevent moisture re-absorption and pest entry.
    *   Avoid direct contact of bags with walls or floors by using wooden pallets.
*   **Pest Control in Storage:**
    *   Fumigate empty storage structures with **Aluminium Phosphide** (as per label instructions and safety precautions) before storing seeds.
    *   Regularly inspect stored seeds for signs of insect infestation or mold growth.
    *   If infestation occurs, consider fumigation with **Aluminium Phosphide** tablets (1-2 tablets of 3 g per tonne of grain for 5-7 days in airtight conditions, strictly under expert supervision due to its highly toxic nature).
*   **Fungal Control:** Ensure seeds are dry. If seeds are to be stored for longer durations or for sowing purposes, treat them with a fungicide like **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 2 g/kg seed or **Thiram** 75% WS at 2.5 g/kg seed.

By implementing these practices, farmers can significantly enhance Toria yield, improve seed quality, and ensure longer, safer storage of their produce.
