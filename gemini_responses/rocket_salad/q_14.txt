As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm that both termites and root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.) are significant soil pests that can severely affect Rocket salad (Eruca sativa) cultivation in Haryana. They damage the root system, leading to stunted growth, wilting, nutrient deficiency symptoms, and ultimately reduced yield.

Effective control requires an integrated approach combining cultural practices with judicious use of CIBRC-approved chemical solutions.

### Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies:

Before resorting to chemical control, consider these foundational practices:

*   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid continuous cultivation of Rocket salad or other susceptible crops (e.g., other brassicas, tomatoes, brinjal) in the same field. Rotate with non-host crops like cereals (wheat, maize, sorghum) or marigolds, which have nematicidal properties.
*   **Soil Solarization:** During hot summer months, prepare the field, moisten the soil, and cover it with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks. This raises soil temperature, effectively killing nematodes, termite colonies, and weed seeds.
*   **Organic Matter Incorporation:** Add well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost to the soil. This improves soil health, enhances beneficial microbial activity, and can suppress nematode populations.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** Expose soil pests to sunlight and natural predators by deep ploughing during summer.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris to prevent pest carryover.

### Chemical Control Measures (CIBRC Approved):

For severe infestations, chemical control can be implemented, strictly following label instructions and safety guidelines.

#### 1. For Termites:

Termites primarily attack roots and the base of the stem. Pre-planting soil treatment is most effective.

*   **Pre-planting Soil Treatment:**
    *   Apply **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 2.0-2.5 L per acre, mixed with 200-400 L of water, and drench the soil thoroughly before sowing or transplanting.
    *   Alternatively, **Fipronil** 0.3% GR can be applied at 6-8 kg per acre and incorporated into the soil during final land preparation.
*   **At-planting/Post-emergence (if infestation observed):**
    *   If termite damage is observed after planting, drench the soil around the base of affected plants with **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 2.5 ml per litre of water.

#### 2. For Nematodes (Root-knot):

Root-knot nematodes cause characteristic galls or knots on the roots, impairing water and nutrient uptake.

*   **Pre-planting/At-planting Soil Application:**
    *   **Cadusafos** 10% GR: Apply 10-15 kg per acre and thoroughly incorporate into the soil before sowing or at the time of planting.
    *   **Fluensulfone** 2% GR: Apply 10-15 kg per acre and incorporate into the soil before sowing or at the time of planting.
    *   **Fluensulfone** 20% SC: Apply 1.0-1.25 L per acre as a soil drench before planting or at planting, followed by light irrigation to ensure proper distribution in the root zone.
    *   **Carbosulfan** 25% EC: Apply 1.0-1.5 L per acre as a soil drench before planting or at planting.

### Important Considerations:

*   **Safety First:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including gloves, mask, and protective clothing while handling and applying any chemical.
*   **Read Labels:** Strictly follow the instructions on the product label for correct dosage, application method, timing, and safety precautions.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Be mindful of the pre-harvest interval (PHI) for any applied chemical, especially for leafy vegetables like Rocket salad, to ensure the produce is safe for consumption.
*   **Soil Moisture:** Ensure adequate soil moisture before and after chemical application for optimal efficacy and to prevent phytotoxicity.
*   **Integrated Approach:** For sustainable and effective control, always integrate chemical methods with cultural and biological practices.
