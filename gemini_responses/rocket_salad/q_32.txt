Drying up of plants, including branches, leaves, fruits, and flowers, in Rocket salad (Arugula) is a general symptom that can be caused by a variety of factors, both abiotic (environmental) and biotic (pests and diseases). A precise diagnosis is crucial for effective management. As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend the following approach:

### **1. Diagnosis: Observe Carefully**

Before applying any treatment, try to identify the specific cause:

*   **Pattern of Drying:** Is it localized to a few plants, or widespread? Does it start from older leaves, or new growth? Is it on one side of the plant?
*   **Root Examination:** Gently dig up an affected plant and inspect the roots. Are they discolored (brown/black), mushy, or do they have galls/swellings?
*   **Stem Examination:** Check the stem base for lesions, discoloration, or softening.
*   **Foliage Examination:** Look for any visible pests (aphids, whiteflies), spots, lesions, or unusual growth.
*   **Soil Conditions:** Is the soil too wet, too dry, compacted, or saline?

### **2. Potential Causes and Management Strategies**

#### **A. Abiotic Factors (Environmental Stress)**

These are often the primary causes of drying symptoms.

1.  **Water Stress (Most Common):**
    *   **Under-watering:** Insufficient moisture leads to wilting and drying, especially during hot, dry periods.
    *   **Over-watering/Waterlogging:** Excess water deprives roots of oxygen, leading to root rot, which then causes wilting and drying of the foliage.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Ensure consistent and adequate irrigation. Check soil moisture before watering.
        *   Provide good drainage to prevent waterlogging. Raised beds can be beneficial.
        *   Mulching with organic matter can help conserve soil moisture and regulate soil temperature.

2.  **Nutrient Deficiencies/Imbalances:**
    *   Severe deficiencies, particularly of macronutrients like Nitrogen, Phosphorus, or Potassium, can lead to stunted growth, yellowing, and premature drying of leaves.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Conduct a soil test to determine nutrient status.
        *   Apply balanced fertilizers based on soil test recommendations.
        *   Foliar sprays of micronutrients can be considered if specific deficiencies are identified.

3.  **Heat Stress:**
    *   Rocket salad prefers cooler temperatures. High temperatures can cause rapid bolting, stress, and drying of leaves.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Plant during appropriate seasons (cooler months).
        *   Consider using shade nets during peak summer heat if growing off-season.

4.  **Soil Compaction/Poor Aeration:**
    *   Compacted soil restricts root growth and water/nutrient uptake, leading to stress and drying.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Improve soil structure by incorporating organic matter (farmyard manure, compost).
        *   Avoid heavy machinery movement in the field.
        *   Practice light tillage or no-till methods where appropriate.

5.  **Salinity:**
    *   High salt concentration in soil or irrigation water can cause osmotic stress, leading to wilting and drying (salt burn).
    *   **Management:**
        *   Use good quality irrigation water.
        *   Leach salts by applying excess water if drainage is good.
        *   Incorporate gypsum in sodic soils.

#### **B. Biotic Factors (Pests and Diseases)**

If abiotic factors are ruled out, consider biotic causes.

1.  **Fungal Root Rots and Wilts:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Yellowing of lower leaves, wilting during the day (recovering at night initially), stunted growth, eventual drying and death of the plant. Roots may appear brown, black, or mushy. Common pathogens include *Rhizoctonia solani*, *Pythium* spp., and *Fusarium* spp.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural:**
            *   Practice strict crop rotation with non-brassica crops for at least 2-3 years.
            *   Ensure good soil drainage.
            *   Use disease-free seeds/seedlings.
            *   Remove and destroy infected plants immediately.
            *   Soil solarization during summer can reduce pathogen load.
        *   **Biological:**
            *   Apply bio-control agents like *Trichoderma viride* (2.5 kg/acre mixed with 50 kg FYM) to the soil at planting.
        *   **Chemical (for severe cases, as a drench):**
            *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: 1-2 g/L of water, drench around the base of affected plants.
            *   **Propamocarb Hydrochloride** 72.2% SL: 2-3 ml/L of water, drench around the base of affected plants.
            *   **Metalaxyl-M + Mancozeb** (e.g., 8% + 64% WP): 2-2.5 g/L of water, drench around the base of affected plants.

2.  **Nematodes (Root-Knot Nematodes - *Meloidogyne* spp.):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, yellowing, wilting, and drying despite adequate water. Examination of roots reveals characteristic galls or swellings.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural:**
            *   Crop rotation with non-host crops (e.g., marigold, cereals).
            *   Use resistant varieties if available.
            *   Soil solarization.
            *   Incorporation of organic matter (neem cake @ 100-200 kg/acre) can suppress nematode populations.
        *   **Biological:**
            *   Apply *Paecilomyces lilacinus* or *Purpureocillium lilacinum* (2.5 kg/acre mixed with 50 kg FYM) to the soil.
        *   **Chemical:** For leafy greens like Rocket salad, chemical nematicides are generally avoided due to MRL concerns and short crop duration. Focus on cultural and biological methods.

3.  **Severe Sucking Pest Infestations (Aphids, Whiteflies):**
    *   While less common to cause complete "drying up" unless extremely severe, heavy infestations can lead to wilting, yellowing, and overall plant decline.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural:** Monitor regularly, remove infested leaves.
        *   **Biological:** Encourage natural enemies like ladybird beetles and lacewings.
        *   **Chemical (if necessary):**
            *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: 0.5-0.75 ml/L of water (spray).
            *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: 0.2-0.4 g/L of water (spray).
            *   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP: 0.2-0.4 g/L of water (spray).
            *   Always observe pre-harvest intervals (PHI) for leafy vegetables.

### **General Recommendations:**

*   **Integrated Pest and Disease Management (IPDM):** Always prioritize cultural and biological methods. Use chemicals only when necessary and as a last resort, following label instructions strictly.
*   **Sanitation:** Keep the field clean of weeds and plant debris, which can harbor pests and pathogens.
*   **Healthy Soil:** Focus on building healthy, well-drained soil rich in organic matter to promote strong root development and plant vigor, making plants more resilient to stress.

If you are still unable to identify the cause or manage the problem, please collect a sample of the affected plant (including roots and surrounding soil) and bring it to the Plant Pathology or Entomology department at HAU, Hisar, for a more precise diagnosis.
