As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the use of Growth Regulators/Hormones for Rocket salad (Eruca sativa) in Haryana:

**1. Ethrel (Ethephon)**
*   This is not known to affect Rocket salad. Ethephon is primarily used to promote ripening in fruits or accelerate senescence/abscission, which is generally counterproductive for a leafy green crop like Rocket salad.

**2. 2,4-D (2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid)**
*   This is not known to affect Rocket salad. 2,4-D is a synthetic auxin that, at higher concentrations, acts as a selective herbicide for broadleaf weeds. Applying it to a broadleaf crop like Rocket salad, even at very low concentrations, carries a significant risk of phytotoxicity and damage, making it unsuitable as a growth regulator for this crop.

**3. Boron**
Boron is an essential micronutrient crucial for cell wall formation, cell division, sugar transport, and overall plant development. While not a hormone, its adequate supply is vital for healthy growth. Application is recommended only if a deficiency is observed or indicated by soil testing.

*   **CIBRC Approved Technical Chemical Names and Recommended Doses (Foliar Application):**
    *   **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (e.g., Solubor):
        *   **Dose:** 1.0 - 2.0 g/L of water (0.1% - 0.2% solution).
    *   **Sodium tetraborate decahydrate** (e.g., Borax):
        *   **Dose:** 1.5 - 3.0 g/L of water (0.15% - 0.3% solution).

*   **Application Method:** Apply as a foliar spray when deficiency symptoms appear (e.g., stunted growth, distorted leaves) or as a preventive measure based on soil test recommendations. Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.
*   **Frequency:** If necessary, a second application can be made 10-15 days after the first.
*   **Important Note:** Boron can be toxic to plants if applied in excess. Always conduct a soil test to determine the existing boron levels in your field before application. Foliar application is generally preferred for correcting mild deficiencies as it allows for more precise control. Avoid indiscriminate use.
