As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in Rocket salad (Eruca sativa) in Haryana:

*   **Borers:**
    This is not known to affect Rocket salad.

*   **Caterpillars:**
    Various species of caterpillars can infest Rocket salad, feeding on leaves and causing defoliation. For effective control, consider the following CIBRC approved insecticides:
    *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG at 80-100 g/acre.
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC at 60 ml/acre.
    *   **Flubendiamide** 20% WG at 50 g/acre.
    *   **Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki** (Bt) formulations as per manufacturer's recommendations, typically 500-1000 g/acre for wettable powder formulations. This is a biological option suitable for Integrated Pest Management (IPM).

*   **Diamondback moth (DBM) (*Plutella xylostella*):**
    DBM is a significant pest of cruciferous crops, including Rocket salad. Larvae feed on leaves, creating characteristic window-pane damage. For effective control, rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development:
    *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG at 80-100 g/acre.
    *   **Spinetoram** 11.7% SC at 75 ml/acre.
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC at 60 ml/acre.
    *   **Indoxacarb** 14.5% SC at 200 ml/acre.

*   **Leaf folder:**
    This is not known to affect Rocket salad.
