As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU), Hisar, I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling sucking pests in Rocket salad (Eruca sativa) in Haryana.

Sucking pests like aphids, leafhoppers, whiteflies, and thrips can significantly reduce the yield and quality of Rocket salad by feeding on plant sap, causing distortion, yellowing, and transmitting viral diseases. Psylla are not a primary or common pest of Rocket salad.

An Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is highly recommended for leafy greens like Rocket salad to minimize chemical residues and ensure food safety.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove crop residues and weeds that can harbor pests.
    *   **Weed Management:** Control weeds in and around the field, as they often serve as alternate hosts for these pests.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate Rocket salad with non-host crops to break pest cycles.
    *   **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing for good air circulation, which can reduce pest build-up.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush growth attractive to sucking pests.
    *   **Yellow Sticky Traps:** Install yellow sticky traps (10-15 traps per acre) for monitoring pest populations and mass trapping of whiteflies, leafhoppers, and winged aphids.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Protect and encourage beneficial insects like ladybird beetles, lacewings, hoverflies, and parasitic wasps, which prey on aphids and whiteflies.
    *   **Biopesticides:** Consider using biopesticides such as formulations of *Beauveria bassiana* or *Verticillium lecanii* (check local availability and efficacy for specific pests).

3.  **Chemical Control (Use only when pest populations exceed economic threshold and as a last resort, strictly adhering to Pre-Harvest Interval - PHI):**

    When chemical intervention is necessary, choose CIBRC approved insecticides with shorter PHIs suitable for leafy vegetables. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

    *   **For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips:**
        *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: 0.25-0.5 ml/L of water (100-200 ml/acre).
        *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: 0.2-0.4 g/L of water (80-160 g/acre).
        *   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP: 0.2-0.4 g/L of water (80-160 g/acre).
        *   **Fipronil** 5% SC: 1.0-1.5 ml/L of water (400-600 ml/acre).
        *   **Spinosad** 45% SC: 0.25-0.4 ml/L of water (100-160 ml/acre).

    *   **Specifically for Whiteflies:**
        *   **Buprofezin** 25% SC: 1.25-1.5 ml/L of water (500-600 ml/acre).
        *   **Diafenthiuron** 50% WP: 1.25-1.5 g/L of water (500-600 g/acre).

    *   **Specifically for Aphids:**
        *   **Flonicamid** 50% WG: 0.3-0.4 g/L of water (120-160 g/acre).

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the label instructions of the chosen pesticide, including dosage, application method, and **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI)**. For leafy greens, PHI is extremely critical.
*   Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where many sucking pests reside.
*   Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension office or HAU experts for the most current recommendations and specific product availability in your area.
