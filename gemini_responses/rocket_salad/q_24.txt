As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following for Rocket salad (Eruca sativa) transplantation in Haryana:

**1. Ideal Transplantation Time:**
Rocket salad is a cool-season crop.
*   **Autumn/Winter Season:** The ideal period for transplanting in Haryana is from **late September to early March**. This allows the crop to establish and grow during the cooler months, avoiding the extreme heat of summer.
*   **Successive Plantings:** For a continuous harvest, successive plantings can be done every 2-3 weeks within this window.

**2. Ideal Transplantation Distance:**
Proper spacing is crucial for good air circulation, light penetration, and nutrient uptake, leading to healthy growth and yield.
*   **Row-to-Row Spacing:** Maintain a distance of **20-30 cm** between rows.
*   **Plant-to-Plant Spacing:** Maintain a distance of **10-15 cm** within the row.

**3. Ideal Transplantation Process:**
A well-executed transplantation process minimizes shock and ensures successful establishment.

*   **Seedling Preparation:**
    *   Sow Rocket salad seeds in nursery trays or raised nursery beds approximately **3-4 weeks** before the intended transplanting date.
    *   Ensure seedlings have developed **3-4 true leaves** and are sturdy enough for handling.
    *   **Hardening Off:** Gradually expose seedlings to outdoor conditions (sunlight, wind, reduced watering) for about 7-10 days before transplanting. This process, known as hardening off, helps them adapt to the field environment and reduces transplant shock.

*   **Field Preparation:**
    *   Prepare the main field to a **fine tilth** by ploughing and harrowing.
    *   Incorporate **10-15 tonnes per acre** of well-decomposed Farmyard Manure (FYM) or compost during land preparation to enrich the soil.
    *   Ensure the soil has adequate moisture. Lightly irrigate the field a day before transplanting if the soil is dry.

*   **Transplanting Procedure:**
    *   Transplant seedlings preferably during the **late afternoon or on a cloudy day** to minimize stress from direct sunlight.
    *   Carefully remove seedlings from the nursery, ensuring minimal disturbance to the root ball.
    *   Dig small holes at the recommended spacing.
    *   Place each seedling into a hole, ensuring the root ball is fully covered and the crown of the plant is at the soil surface level.
    *   Gently firm the soil around the base of each seedling to ensure good root-to-soil contact.

*   **Post-Transplanting Care:**
    *   Immediately after transplanting, provide a **light irrigation** to settle the soil around the roots and help the seedlings establish.
    *   Monitor the transplanted seedlings closely for the first few days for any signs of wilting or stress.
    *   Maintain adequate soil moisture, but avoid waterlogging.
