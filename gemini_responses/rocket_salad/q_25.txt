As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend the following irrigation management practices for Rocket salad (Eruca sativa) in Haryana:

Rocket salad requires consistent moisture for optimal growth, tender leaf development, and to prevent premature bolting and bitterness. The irrigation schedule will depend on soil type, prevailing weather conditions, and the crop's growth stage.

*   **First Irrigation:**
    *   If the field has adequate pre-sowing moisture, the first irrigation can be given immediately after sowing to ensure good seed-to-soil contact and facilitate uniform germination.
    *   Alternatively, if the soil is dry at the time of sowing, a light irrigation should be applied immediately after sowing to provide the necessary moisture for germination.
    *   In general, the first irrigation is crucial for seedling establishment and should be provided within 3-5 days of sowing if there is no significant rainfall.

*   **Second Irrigation and Subsequent Irrigations:**
    *   Subsequent irrigations should be applied based on soil moisture depletion and crop demand.
    *   Typically, irrigations are required at intervals of 10-15 days during the cooler Rabi season in Haryana.
    *   Observe the crop and soil moisture. Irrigate when the top 2-3 cm of soil appears dry to touch.
    *   Critical stages for water application include the early vegetative growth phase, where consistent moisture promotes lush leaf development.
    *   Avoid waterlogging, as it can lead to root rot and other fungal diseases. Conversely, severe water stress can lead to premature bolting and a pungent, bitter taste in the leaves.
    *   Reduce irrigation frequency as the crop approaches maturity or before harvesting to prevent excessive leaf moisture and potential post-harvest issues.

*   **Sprinkler Use:**
    *   Sprinkler irrigation, particularly micro-sprinklers or mini-sprinklers, is highly recommended for Rocket salad cultivation.
    *   **Advantages:**
        *   **Uniform Water Distribution:** Ensures even application of water across the field, leading to uniform crop growth.
        *   **Water Efficiency:** Significantly reduces water wastage compared to flood irrigation, especially beneficial in regions with water scarcity.
        *   **Gentle Application:** Prevents soil crusting, which can impede seedling emergence, and minimizes soil erosion.
        *   **Maintains Leaf Quality:** Keeps leaves clean by avoiding direct soil splash, which can reduce the incidence of certain foliar diseases.
        *   **Temperature Regulation:** Can help in moderating canopy temperature during warmer periods, reducing plant stress.
    *   **Considerations:**
        *   While highly efficient, ensure irrigation is done preferably in the morning hours to allow foliage to dry before nightfall, thereby minimizing the risk of fungal diseases associated with prolonged leaf wetness.
        *   Consider wind speed, as strong winds can affect the uniformity of water distribution.
