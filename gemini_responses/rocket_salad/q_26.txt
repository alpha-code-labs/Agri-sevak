As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide information on specialized practices for Rocket salad (Eruca vesicaria). It is important to note that many of the practices you listed are typically associated with perennial crops or those with different growth habits than Rocket salad, which is an annual leafy green primarily grown for its leaves.

*   **Pruning:** This is not known to affect Rocket salad in the traditional sense. Rocket salad is harvested by cutting its outer leaves, which encourages further leaf production from the center of the plant. This "cut-and-come-again" harvesting method is a standard practice for continuous yield, but it is a harvesting technique rather than a specialized pruning practice.

*   **Desuckering:** This is not known to affect Rocket salad. Rocket salad does not produce suckers that require removal.

*   **Mulching:** Mulching is a beneficial practice for Rocket salad cultivation, especially in Haryana's climate, to optimize growing conditions.
    *   **Benefits:** It helps conserve soil moisture, suppresses weed growth, moderates soil temperature (keeping roots cooler in summer and warmer in winter), and can improve soil structure over time if organic mulches are used.
    *   **Materials:** Organic mulches such as straw, dried leaves, or finely shredded crop residues are suitable. For commercial scale, black plastic mulch can also be used to warm the soil in cooler periods and suppress weeds effectively, though it does not contribute organic matter to the soil.
    *   **Application:** Apply a layer of 5-10 cm thickness around the plants, ensuring it does not touch the plant stems directly to prevent potential rot or pest issues.

*   **Grafting:** This is not known to affect Rocket salad. Grafting is not a practice used in the cultivation of Rocket salad, which is grown for its leaves and has a relatively short life cycle.

*   **Pollination:** This is not known to affect Rocket salad as a specialized practice for leaf production. Rocket salad is an insect-pollinated crop. While natural pollination by bees and other insects is essential for seed production, human intervention for pollination is not required when growing Rocket salad for its leaves.
