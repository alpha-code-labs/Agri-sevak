As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the suitable climate, soil type, and drainage requirements for Rocket salad (Eruca vesicaria) in Haryana:

**Climate:**
*   Rocket salad is a cool-season crop that thrives in mild temperatures.
*   The optimal temperature range for vigorous growth and best flavor is between 10°C and 20°C.
*   Temperatures consistently above 25°C can lead to premature bolting (flowering), reduced leaf quality, and an increase in pungency and bitterness.
*   It can tolerate light frost, but severe frost can damage the foliage.
*   In Haryana, it is best grown during the Rabi season (autumn/winter), typically from September/October to February/March, avoiding the extreme heat of summer.

**Soil Type:**
*   Rocket salad prefers well-drained, fertile soil rich in organic matter.
*   Loamy to sandy-loam soils are ideal, as they provide a good balance of water retention and aeration.
*   Heavy clay soils should be avoided or amended with organic matter (e.g., well-rotted farmyard manure or compost) to improve their structure and drainage.
*   The optimal soil pH range is slightly acidic to neutral, typically between 6.0 and 7.0.

**Drainage Requirement:**
*   Excellent drainage is crucial for Rocket salad. It is highly susceptible to root rot in waterlogged conditions.
*   The soil must allow for rapid percolation of excess water while retaining sufficient moisture for plant growth.
*   Raised beds can be beneficial in areas with heavy soils or poor natural drainage to ensure adequate water runoff.
*   Avoid planting in low-lying areas where water tends to accumulate after irrigation or rainfall.
