Dear Farmer,

Controlling Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies in Rocket salad (Eruca sativa) requires an integrated approach, combining cultural practices with judicious use of CIBRC-approved insecticides when necessary. These groups of pests are indeed known to affect Rocket salad, being a cruciferous crop.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies:**

1.  **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your crop for signs of pest damage (e.g., shot holes from flea beetles, chewed leaves, larvae). Early detection is crucial for effective management.
2.  **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting rocket salad or other cruciferous crops in the same field consecutively. Rotate with non-host crops to disrupt pest life cycles.
3.  **Field Sanitation:** Remove crop residues immediately after harvest to reduce overwintering sites for pests. Control weeds, as many can serve as alternate hosts.
4.  **Physical Barriers:** For small plots, fine mesh netting can be used to exclude pests like flea beetles and sawflies.
5.  **Timely Sowing:** Adjust sowing dates to avoid peak pest activity periods if possible, based on local pest calendars.

**Chemical Control (Use only when pest incidence crosses economic threshold levels):**

When chemical intervention is required, choose CIBRC-approved insecticides and strictly adhere to the recommended dosage and pre-harvest interval (PHI). Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during application.

For the control of Beetles (especially Flea Beetles), Weevils, and Sawflies, the following technical chemicals are recommended:

*   **Imidacloprid:**
    *   Dosage: 0.25-0.5 ml/L of water (for 17.8% SL formulation) or as per product label.
    *   Effective against sucking pests and some chewing pests like flea beetles.
*   **Thiamethoxam:**
    *   Dosage: 0.2-0.4 g/L of water (for 25% WG formulation) or as per product label.
    *   Similar spectrum to Imidacloprid, effective against various beetles and sawflies.
*   **Lambda-cyhalothrin:**
    *   Dosage: 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water (for 5% EC formulation) or as per product label.
    *   A broad-spectrum pyrethroid effective against chewing pests like beetles, weevils, and sawfly larvae.
*   **Cypermethrin:**
    *   Dosage: 1.0-1.5 ml/L of water (for 10% EC formulation) or as per product label.
    *   Another broad-spectrum pyrethroid effective against a range of chewing insects.
*   **Spinosad:**
    *   Dosage: 0.25-0.5 ml/L of water (for 45% SC formulation) or as per product label.
    *   Effective against various chewing pests, including sawflies and some beetles, with a relatively favorable safety profile.
*   **Azadirachtin:**
    *   Dosage: 2.0-5.0 ml/L of water (for 1500-10000 ppm formulation) or as per product label.
    *   A botanical insecticide with anti-feedant and repellent properties, particularly useful in early stages or for organic farming practices.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always check the PHI mentioned on the product label and strictly follow it, especially for a short-duration crop like Rocket salad, which is often consumed fresh.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pest resistance.
*   **Spray Coverage:** Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where pests might hide.
*   **Water Quality:** Use clean water for spraying.
