As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Rocket salad (Eruca sativa) in Haryana.

### Pest Management in Rocket Salad

**1. Grasshopper**
Grasshoppers are generalist feeders and can cause significant damage by chewing leaves, especially on young plants.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Regular monitoring of the crop, especially during dry periods.
    *   Hand-picking for small infestations, particularly in early stages.
    *   Maintain field sanitation by removing weeds and crop residues that can serve as breeding grounds.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   For moderate to severe infestations, consider applying insecticides. Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.
    *   **Malathion** 50% EC at 2-3 ml/L of water (or 1.0-1.5 L/acre).
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 0.4-0.5 ml/L of water (or 200-250 ml/acre).

**2. Painted Bug (Bagrada cruciferarum)**
The Painted bug is a significant sucking pest of cruciferous crops, including Rocket salad. They suck sap from leaves, stems, and pods, leading to wilting, yellowing, and stunted growth.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Remove and destroy cruciferous weeds (e.g., wild mustard, radish) from and around the field, as they act as alternate hosts.
    *   Practice good field sanitation and remove crop residues immediately after harvest.
    *   Early sowing can sometimes help escape peak pest populations.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   For effective control of sucking pests like the Painted bug, systemic insecticides are often preferred.
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL at 0.2-0.25 ml/L of water (or 100-125 ml/acre).
    *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG at 0.1-0.2 g/L of water (or 50-100 g/acre).
    *   Alternatively, **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 0.4-0.5 ml/L of water (or 200-250 ml/acre) can also be effective.

**3. Red Cotton Bug (Dysdercus cingulatus)**
This is not known to affect Rocket salad. The Red cotton bug is primarily a pest of cotton and other malvaceous plants, feeding on developing seeds.

**4. Black Ants**
Black ants in Rocket salad fields are often secondary pests. They are commonly found tending to other sap-sucking insects like aphids, mealybugs, or whiteflies, as they feed on the honeydew secreted by these pests. Direct damage to Rocket salad by black ants is less common, though they can sometimes damage seedlings or roots.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Identify and control the primary pest (e.g., aphids) if ants are observed tending them.
    *   Maintain good field hygiene and remove any potential food sources or nesting sites.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   If ants are directly causing damage to seedlings or roots, or are a significant nuisance, a perimeter spray or spot treatment can be considered.
    *   **Malathion** 50% EC at 2-3 ml/L of water (or 1.0-1.5 L/acre) can be applied as a targeted spray to ant trails or nests, or as a general deterrent if they are widespread.

**General Precautions for Pesticide Application:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully, including dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, and protective clothing during mixing and application.
*   Observe the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) specified for the chosen chemical on leafy vegetables to ensure the produce is safe for consumption.
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.
*   Apply pesticides during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
