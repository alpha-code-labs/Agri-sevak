As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend the following organic manure doses for Rocket salad (Eruca sativa) in Haryana, keeping in mind the importance of soil health and sustainable practices:

*   **Farmyard Manure (FYM):**
    *   Apply 10-15 tonnes per acre during land preparation, at least 2-3 weeks before sowing or transplanting. Ensure it is well-decomposed. This provides a broad spectrum of nutrients and improves soil structure and water holding capacity.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   Apply 3-5 tonnes per acre during land preparation, incorporated into the soil. Vermicompost is richer in nutrients than FYM and also enhances microbial activity.

*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract based biostimulant):**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Mix 2-4 ml of **Sagarika** (seaweed extract) per litre of water and spray at critical growth stages (e.g., 15-20 days after sowing/transplanting, and again 15-20 days later). This acts as a biostimulant, promoting root development, nutrient uptake, and overall plant vigour.
    *   **Soil Drench/Drip Application:** Apply 1-2 litres of **Sagarika** (seaweed extract) per acre, mixed with irrigation water, during early growth stages.

**Important Considerations:**
*   These are general recommendations. A soil test report is highly recommended to determine specific nutrient deficiencies and tailor the manure application rates accordingly.
*   Ensure the FYM and Vermicompost are well-decomposed to avoid nutrient immobilization and pest issues.
