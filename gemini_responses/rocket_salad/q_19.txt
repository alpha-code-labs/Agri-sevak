Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice to address macro-nutrient deficiencies in Rocket salad (Eruca sativa) for the Haryana region.

It is crucial to conduct a soil test before applying any fertilizers to accurately determine the existing nutrient levels and avoid over-application, which can be detrimental to the crop and the environment. However, based on typical deficiency symptoms, here's how to address Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium deficiencies:

### General Recommendations Before Specific Treatments:
*   **Soil Testing:** Always begin with a comprehensive soil test to understand the exact nutrient status of your field. This will guide precise fertilizer application.
*   **Organic Matter:** Incorporating well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost (5-10 tonnes/acre) before sowing can significantly improve soil health, nutrient availability, and water retention.

### Addressing Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   General yellowing or pale green colour of older leaves, starting from the tips and moving inwards.
*   Stunted growth and reduced leaf size.
*   Premature senescence (aging) of older leaves.

**Corrective Measures:**
*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Urea** (46% N) at a rate of 20-30 kg N per acre. This translates to approximately 43-65 kg of **Urea** per acre.
    *   It is best to apply Nitrogen in split doses: half as a basal application at sowing/transplanting, and the remaining half as a top-dressing 2-3 weeks after germination/transplanting.
*   **Foliar Application (for quick recovery):**
    *   Spray a 1-2% solution of **Urea** (10-20 g of **Urea** per litre of water) on the foliage.
    *   Apply in the morning or late afternoon to avoid scorching. Repeat after 7-10 days if symptoms persist.

### Addressing Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   Dark green or purplish discoloration of leaves, especially on the undersides and margins of older leaves.
*   Stunted growth, poor root development, and delayed maturity.
*   Leaves may appear stiff and upright.

**Corrective Measures:**
*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5) at a rate of 15-20 kg P2O5 per acre. This translates to approximately 32-43 kg of **DAP** per acre.
    *   Alternatively, apply **Single Superphosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5) at a rate of 94-125 kg of **SSP** per acre.
    *   Phosphorus fertilizers are best applied as a basal dose, incorporated into the soil before sowing or transplanting, as P is less mobile in the soil.

### Addressing Potassium (K) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   Yellowing and browning (scorching) of leaf margins, particularly on older leaves, while the inner part of the leaf remains green.
*   Weak stems, poor disease resistance, and reduced yield quality.
*   Leaves may appear wilted even with adequate moisture.

**Corrective Measures:**
*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** (60% K2O) at a rate of 15-20 kg K2O per acre. This translates to approximately 25-33 kg of **MOP** per acre.
    *   Potassium can be applied as a basal dose, or in two splits: half at sowing and half as a top-dressing 2-3 weeks later, especially in sandy soils.
*   **Foliar Application (for quick recovery):**
    *   Spray a 1% solution of **Potassium Sulphate** (10 g of **Potassium Sulphate** per litre of water) on the foliage.
    *   Apply in the morning or late afternoon. Repeat after 7-10 days if symptoms persist.

Remember to always follow the recommended dosages and application methods for optimal results and to ensure sustainable agricultural practices. For specific field conditions, consulting with your local HAU Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) is highly recommended.
