Here are the recommended cultivation practices for Rocket salad (Arugula) suitable for Haryana conditions:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   Rocket salad is typically direct-sown.
    *   For commercial cultivation and ease of intercultural operations, sowing in rows is recommended. Broadcasting can also be done for home gardens or smaller plots.
    *   Ensure a fine, well-prepared seedbed for optimal germination.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   Seeds should be sown shallowly at a depth of 0.5 to 1.0 cm. Deeper planting can hinder germination.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   **Row-to-row spacing:** Maintain a distance of 20-30 cm between rows.
    *   **Plant-to-plant spacing:** After germination, thin the seedlings to achieve a plant-to-plant spacing of 5-10 cm within the row. This allows for proper plant development and air circulation.

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   A seed rate of 2-4 kg per acre is generally recommended for optimal plant stand.
