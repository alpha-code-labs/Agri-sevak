As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm the following:

*   **Fruit fly (Tephritidae family)** primarily infests fleshy fruits and some fruiting vegetables (e.g., mango, guava, tomato, brinjal). Rocket salad (Eruca vesicaria) is a leafy green vegetable, and its leaves are the harvested part. Therefore, fruit flies are not known to affect Rocket salad.
*   **Ber fly (Carpomyia vesuviana)** is a highly specific pest that exclusively infests the fruits of Ber (Ziziphus mauritiana). It does not affect Rocket salad.

Therefore, control measures for these specific pests are not required for Rocket salad cultivation.
