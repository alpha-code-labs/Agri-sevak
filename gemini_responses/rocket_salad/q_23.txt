As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified seed and soil treatment processes for Rocket salad (Eruca sativa) cultivation in Haryana:

### Recommended Seed Treatment Process for Rocket Salad

Seed treatment is crucial for protecting young seedlings from soil-borne pathogens and early-season insect pests, ensuring better germination and stand establishment.

1.  **Fungicidal Seed Treatment:**
    *   **Purpose:** To protect against damping-off (caused by *Pythium*, *Rhizoctonia*), seedling blight, and other seed-borne fungal diseases.
    *   **Method:** Mix the fungicide thoroughly with the seeds using the slurry method (add a small amount of water to make a paste). Ensure uniform coating on all seeds. Allow seeds to dry in shade before sowing.
    *   **Recommendation:**
        *   **Thiram 75% WS:** 2.5 - 3.0 g per kg of seed.
        *   **OR**
        *   **Carbendazim 50% WP:** 1.0 - 2.0 g per kg of seed.
        *   **OR (for broader spectrum)**
        *   **Carbendazim 12% + Mancozeb 63% WP:** 2.5 g per kg of seed.

2.  **Insecticidal Seed Treatment (Optional, if early pest pressure is anticipated):**
    *   **Purpose:** To protect against early-season sucking pests like aphids and flea beetles.
    *   **Method:** Apply after fungicidal treatment (if both are used). Mix thoroughly with seeds.
    *   **Recommendation:**
        *   **Imidacloprid 48% FS:** 5 - 7 ml per kg of seed.

3.  **Bio-fungicidal Seed Treatment (If opting for organic or integrated approach):**
    *   **Purpose:** To enhance protection against soil-borne diseases and promote plant growth. Apply after chemical treatments, or as a standalone treatment.
    *   **Method:** Mix the bio-agent with seeds using a small amount of water.
    *   **Recommendation:**
        *   **Trichoderma viride 1% WP:** 5 - 10 g per kg of seed.

### Recommended Soil Treatment Process for Rocket Salad

Soil treatment aims to improve soil health, manage soil-borne pathogens and nematodes, and provide a conducive environment for root development.

1.  **Organic Matter Enrichment:**
    *   **Purpose:** To improve soil structure, water retention, nutrient availability, and microbial activity.
    *   **Method:** Apply well-decomposed Farmyard Manure (FYM) or compost uniformly across the field 2-3 weeks before sowing. Incorporate it into the soil during the last ploughing.
    *   **Recommendation:**
        *   Well-decomposed FYM or compost: 10 - 15 tonnes per acre.

2.  **Bio-agent Application for Disease and Nematode Management:**
    *   **Purpose:** To suppress soil-borne fungal diseases (like damping-off, root rot) and manage plant-parasitic nematodes.
    *   **Method:** Mix the bio-agent with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed FYM or sand. Broadcast this mixture evenly over the field before the last ploughing and incorporate it into the soil. Ensure adequate soil moisture for microbial activity.
    *   **Recommendation:**
        *   For fungal diseases: **Trichoderma viride 1% WP:** 2 kg per acre.
        *   For nematode management (if nematodes are a known problem): **Purpureocillium lilacinum 1% WP:** 2 kg per acre.

3.  **Basal Fertilizer Application:**
    *   **Purpose:** To provide essential nutrients for initial plant growth.
    *   **Method:** Apply fertilizers uniformly and incorporate them into the soil during the final land preparation.
    *   **Recommendation:**
        *   It is highly recommended to conduct a soil test to determine precise nutrient requirements. However, in the absence of a soil test, a general recommendation for leafy greens like Rocket salad is:
            *   Nitrogen (N): 20 - 30 kg N per acre (e.g., 45-65 kg Urea). Apply half at sowing, and the remaining half as a top dressing after 20-25 days.
            *   Phosphorus (P2O5): 15 - 20 kg P2O5 per acre (e.g., 35-45 kg DAP or 90-125 kg Single Super Phosphate). Apply full dose at sowing.
            *   Potassium (K2O): 10 - 15 kg K2O per acre (e.g., 15-25 kg Muriate of Potash). Apply full dose at sowing.

By following these recommended seed and soil treatment processes, Rocket salad growers in Haryana can significantly improve crop health, yield, and overall farm profitability.
