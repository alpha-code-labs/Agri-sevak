Dear Farmer,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following fertilizer schedule for Rocket salad (Eruca sativa) cultivation in Haryana. Please note that these are general recommendations, and a soil test is highly recommended to determine the precise nutrient status of your field and tailor the fertilizer application accordingly.

Rocket salad is a fast-growing leafy green that requires a balanced supply of nutrients, particularly Nitrogen for lush foliage.

**Recommended Fertilizer Doses for Rocket Salad:**

**1. Basal Application (at the time of sowing/transplanting):**
Apply these fertilizers and mix them well into the soil before sowing.

*   **DAP (Di-Ammonium Phosphate):** 85 kg/acre
    *   *(Provides approximately 15 kg Nitrogen and 39 kg Phosphorus (P2O5))*
*   **Muriate of Potash (Potash):** 65 kg/acre
    *   *(Provides approximately 39 kg Potassium (K2O))*
*   **Sulphur (Elemental Sulphur 90%):** 10 kg/acre
    *   *(Provides approximately 9 kg Sulphur)*

**2. Top-dressing (Nitrogen Application):**
Nitrogen should be applied in split doses to ensure continuous availability for leaf growth and to minimize losses.

*   **First Top-dressing (20-25 days after sowing):**
    *   **Urea:** 70 kg/acre
        *   *(Provides approximately 32 kg Nitrogen)*
*   **Second Top-dressing (35-40 days after sowing, if needed for prolonged harvest or vigorous growth):**
    *   **Urea:** 70 kg/acre
        *   *(Provides approximately 32 kg Nitrogen)*

**Summary of Total Nutrients Provided (approximate, assuming both top-dressings):**
*   Nitrogen (N): ~79 kg/acre
*   Phosphorus (P2O5): ~39 kg/acre
*   Potassium (K2O): ~39 kg/acre
*   Sulphur (S): ~9 kg/acre

**Role of Nano-Fertilizers (Nano-Urea, Nano-DAP):**

Nano-fertilizers are advanced formulations designed for foliar application to enhance nutrient use efficiency and supplement conventional fertilizers. They are not intended to completely replace the basal application of bulk fertilizers like DAP, Potash, or SSP.

*   **Nano-Urea (4% N liquid):**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml/L of water.
    *   **Application:** Can be sprayed foliar at 25-30 days after sowing, and again 10-15 days later, especially if the crop shows signs of nitrogen deficiency or to boost growth.
*   **Nano-DAP (8% N, 16% P2O5 liquid):**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml/L of water.
    *   **Application:** Can be sprayed foliar during early vegetative growth (15-20 days after sowing) to supplement Nitrogen and Phosphorus, particularly beneficial for root development and overall plant vigor.

**NPK Complex Fertilizers:**

While NPK complex fertilizers (e.g., 19:19:19, 12:32:16) can be used, precise nutrient management for Rocket salad is often better achieved by using individual fertilizers as recommended above. If you prefer to use an NPK complex, you would need to adjust the doses of DAP, Potash, and Urea accordingly to meet the crop's specific N, P, and K requirements. For leafy greens, ensuring adequate Nitrogen is crucial.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Soil Testing:** Always conduct a soil test before planting to get precise recommendations for your specific field. This helps in optimizing fertilizer use and preventing nutrient imbalances.
*   **Irrigation:** Ensure adequate moisture in the soil, especially after fertilizer application, to facilitate nutrient uptake by the plants.
*   **Organic Matter:** Incorporating farmyard manure (FYM) or compost (5-10 tonnes/acre) during land preparation significantly improves soil health, nutrient availability, and water retention capacity.
