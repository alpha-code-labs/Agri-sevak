Regarding your query on controlling viral diseases in Rocket salad (Eruca sativa):

*   **Tristeza:** This is not known to affect Rocket salad. Tristeza virus primarily affects citrus crops.

For other viral diseases such as Leaf curl, Mosaic, Yellow vein clearing, Stripe, and Stunt virus, it is important to understand that there is no direct chemical cure for viral infections once a plant is infected. Management strategies primarily focus on prevention and controlling the insect vectors that transmit these viruses.

Here are the recommended control measures:

1.  **Cultural Practices and Sanitation:**
    *   **Use Healthy Seeds:** Always use certified, disease-free seeds from reputable sources.
    *   **Roguing:** Regularly inspect your crop. Immediately remove and destroy (burn or bury deep) any plants showing symptoms of viral infection to prevent further spread.
    *   **Weed Management:** Control weeds in and around the field, as many weeds can act as alternative hosts for viruses and their insect vectors.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops to break the disease cycle.
    *   **Field Hygiene:** Maintain good field sanitation by removing crop residues after harvest.
    *   **Optimum Plant Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to improve air circulation and reduce plant stress.

2.  **Vector Control (Insect Management):**
    Viral diseases in Rocket salad are primarily transmitted by insect vectors like aphids and sometimes whiteflies. Controlling these vectors is crucial to prevent the spread of viruses. Apply insecticides when vector populations are low or at the first sign of their appearance.

    **CIBRC Approved Insecticides for Vector Control:**

    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at 125-250 ml/acre (or 0.25-0.5 ml/L of water for foliar spray).
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at 40-80 g/acre (or 0.1-0.2 g/L of water for foliar spray).
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply at 50-100 g/acre (or 0.1-0.2 g/L of water for foliar spray).
    *   **Flonicamid 50% WG:** Apply at 60-80 g/acre (or 0.12-0.16 g/L of water for foliar spray).
    *   **Dimethoate 30% EC:** Apply at 330-660 ml/acre (or 0.6-1.2 ml/L of water for foliar spray).

    *Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions mentioned on the label, including pre-harvest intervals.*

It is important to adopt an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods for sustainable disease management.
