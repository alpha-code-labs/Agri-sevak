As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm that micronutrient deficiencies can significantly impact the growth and yield of Rocket salad (Eruca sativa). Addressing these deficiencies requires a scientific approach, starting with proper diagnosis.

**Crucial First Step: Soil Testing**
Before applying any micronutrients, it is highly recommended to conduct a comprehensive soil test. This will accurately identify which specific nutrients are deficient in your field and to what extent, preventing unnecessary applications and potential toxicities. Visual symptoms are often late-stage indicators and can be misleading.

Based on typical deficiencies observed in Haryana and general plant nutritional requirements, here's how to address the specified micronutrient deficiencies in Rocket salad:

---

### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, small leaves (often referred to as 'little leaf'), interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, and sometimes a purplish discoloration.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** at 20-25 kg/acre or **Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate** at 10-12 kg/acre, broadcast and incorporated into the soil before sowing or transplanting.
    *   **Foliar Application:** For quick relief, spray with **Zinc EDTA** at 0.5 g/L of water, or **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** at 2.5-5 g/L of water (ensure to add 1.25-2.5 g/L of **Calcium Hydroxide** to neutralize acidity and prevent leaf burn). Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, targeting young foliage.

### 2. Iron/Ferrous (Fe) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Pronounced interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, with veins remaining green initially. In severe cases, the entire leaf turns yellow or even white.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** In non-alkaline soils, **Ferrous Sulphate Heptahydrate** can be applied at 20-25 kg/acre. However, its effectiveness is limited in high pH (alkaline) soils common in Haryana.
    *   **Foliar Application:** This is generally more effective for iron deficiency, especially in alkaline soils. Spray with **Ferrous Sulphate Heptahydrate** at 5 g/L of water (add 2.5 g/L of **Calcium Hydroxide** to prevent leaf burn) or **Ferrous EDTA** at 0.5-1 g/L of water. Apply 2-3 sprays at 7-10 day intervals, focusing on new growth.

### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, thickening and brittleness of young leaves, death of growing points, malformed or cracked stems/petioles, and poor flowering/seed set.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Borax (Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate)** at 4-6 kg/acre, broadcast and incorporated into the soil before sowing.
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray with **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** at 1-1.5 g/L of water or **Borax** at 1.5-2 g/L of water. Apply 1-2 sprays during the vegetative growth stage.
    *   **Caution:** Boron has a narrow range between deficiency and toxicity. Do not exceed recommended rates without a soil test.

### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Primarily affects young tissues. Stunted growth, distorted or curled young leaves, marginal necrosis (tip burn) on young leaves, and poor root development.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** If soil pH is low, liming with **Calcium Carbonate** can correct calcium deficiency. For direct application, **Calcium Nitrate** can be used via fertigation.
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray with **Calcium Nitrate** at 5-10 g/L of water or **Calcium Chloride** at 2.5-5 g/L of water. Apply 2-3 sprays during active growth, ensuring good coverage of young leaves.

### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, where the veins remain green while the tissue between them turns yellow. Leaves may become brittle and curl upwards.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Magnesium Sulphate Heptahydrate** (Epsom salt) at 10-20 kg/acre, broadcast and incorporated into the soil.
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray with **Magnesium Sulphate Heptahydrate** at 5-10 g/L of water. Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals.

### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, similar to iron deficiency but often accompanied by small necrotic (dead) spots. Overall stunted growth.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Manganese Sulphate Monohydrate** at 10-15 kg/acre, broadcast and incorporated into the soil.
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray with **Manganese Sulphate Monohydrate** at 2.5-5 g/L of water. Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals.

**General Recommendations:**

*   **Timing:** Foliar sprays are most effective when applied in the early morning or late afternoon to avoid rapid drying and maximize absorption.
*   **Water Quality:** Use clean water for preparing spray solutions.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management:** Combine these specific treatments with a balanced primary and secondary nutrient fertilization program based on soil test recommendations for sustainable plant health.
