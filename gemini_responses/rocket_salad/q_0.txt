Namaste, Kisan bhaiyon! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I am here to provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing fungal diseases in Rocket salad (Arugula) in Haryana.

Effective management of fungal diseases requires an integrated approach combining cultural practices and judicious use of CIBRC-approved fungicides.

### General Cultural Practices for Fungal Disease Prevention:

1.  **Crop Rotation:** Practice a minimum 2-3 year rotation, avoiding planting Rocket salad or other brassica crops (cabbage, cauliflower, mustard, radish) in the same field consecutively.
2.  **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris immediately after harvest to reduce inoculum for the next crop.
3.  **Seed Selection:** Use certified, disease-free seeds. Seed treatment can also be beneficial.
4.  **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to improve air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce humidity and fungal growth.
5.  **Irrigation Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day. If overhead irrigation is necessary, do it in the morning to allow foliage to dry quickly. Drip irrigation is preferred.
6.  **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced fertilization. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can lead to lush, susceptible growth.

### Specific Fungal Diseases and Their Control:

Here's how to control the mentioned fungal diseases in Rocket salad:

#### 1. Alternaria (Alternaria Leaf Spot)

This disease, caused by *Alternaria brassicicola* and *A. raphani*, is a common problem in Rocket salad, causing dark, concentric spots on leaves.

**Chemical Control:**
Apply foliar sprays at the first sign of symptoms and repeat every 10-14 days, alternating fungicides to prevent resistance.

*   **Mancozeb 75% WP:** 2.5 g/L of water (or 2.5 kg/acre)
*   **Chlorothalonil 75% WP:** 2.0 g/L of water (or 2.0 kg/acre)
*   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:** 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water (or 200 ml/acre)
*   **Tebuconazole 25.9% EC:** 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water (or 250-300 ml/acre)

#### 2. Anthracnose

Caused by *Colletotrichum* species, Anthracnose can lead to sunken lesions on leaves and stems, often with pinkish spore masses under humid conditions.

**Chemical Control:**
The fungicides recommended for Alternaria are also effective against Anthracnose. Apply at the first sign of symptoms.

*   **Mancozeb 75% WP:** 2.5 g/L of water (or 2.5 kg/acre)
*   **Chlorothalonil 75% WP:** 2.0 g/L of water (or 2.0 kg/acre)
*   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:** 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water (or 200 ml/acre)
*   **Difenoconazole 25% EC:** 0.5 ml/L of water (or 100-150 ml/acre)

#### 3. Blast

This is not known to affect Rocket salad. Blast disease is primarily associated with cereal crops like rice.

#### 4. Blight

This is not known to affect Rocket salad. Specifically, Early Blight (*Alternaria solani*) and Late Blight (*Phytophthora infestans*) are diseases of solanaceous crops (e.g., potato, tomato) and do not affect Rocket salad.

#### 5. Brown Spot

"Brown spot" is a general symptom, often caused by fungi like *Alternaria* or *Cercospora*. In Rocket salad, *Alternaria* is a common cause of brown spots.

**Chemical Control:**
The fungicides recommended for Alternaria and Anthracnose will also manage general brown spot symptoms.

*   **Mancozeb 75% WP:** 2.5 g/L of water (or 2.5 kg/acre)
*   **Chlorothalonil 75% WP:** 2.0 g/L of water (or 2.0 kg/acre)
*   **Tebuconazole 25.9% EC:** 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water (or 250-300 ml/acre)

#### 6. Downy Mildew

Caused by *Hyaloperonospora parasitica*, Downy Mildew is a significant disease in Rocket salad, appearing as yellowish spots on the upper leaf surface with a characteristic greyish-white fuzzy growth on the underside.

**Chemical Control:**
Apply fungicides preventively or at the very early stages of the disease.

*   **Metalaxyl-M 4% + Mancozeb 64% WP:** 2.0 g/L of water (or 500 g/acre)
*   **Cymoxanil 8% + Mancozeb 64% WP:** 2.0 g/L of water (or 600 g/acre)
*   **Propineb 70% WP:** 2.5 g/L of water (or 2.5 kg/acre)
*   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:** 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water (or 200 ml/acre)

#### 7. Powdery Mildew

Caused by *Erysiphe cruciferarum*, Powdery Mildew appears as white, powdery patches on the upper and lower surfaces of leaves and stems.

**Chemical Control:**
Apply fungicides at the first sign of the disease.

*   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP:** 2.5-3.0 g/L of water (or 2.5 kg/acre)
*   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:** 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water (or 200 ml/acre)
*   **Tebuconazole 25.9% EC:** 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water (or 250-300 ml/acre)
*   **Difenoconazole 25% EC:** 0.5 ml/L of water (or 100-150 ml/acre)

#### 8. Grey Mildew

This is not known to affect Rocket salad. "Grey mildew" is not a recognized disease name for brassica crops.

### Important Considerations:

*   **Resistance Management:** Always alternate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of fungicide resistance.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Strictly observe the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) for each fungicide to ensure the produce is safe for consumption. This information is usually provided on the product label.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) while handling and spraying chemicals. Follow all instructions on the product label carefully.
*   **Local Advice:** For specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions, it is always advisable to consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively manage fungal diseases and ensure a healthy Rocket salad crop.
