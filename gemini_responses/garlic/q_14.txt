As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling soil pests like termites and nematodes (specifically root-knot nematodes) in garlic cultivation in Haryana.

Both termites and root-knot nematodes are significant soil pests that can cause considerable damage to garlic crops, leading to reduced yield and quality. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods, is recommended for effective and sustainable control.

### Control of Termites in Garlic

Termites (Odontotermes obesus, Microtermes obesi, etc.) are polyphagous pests that can damage garlic bulbs and roots, especially in light-textured soils and under dry conditions.

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove all crop residues, stubble, and woody debris from the field before planting, as these can serve as food sources and breeding sites for termites.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** Deep summer ploughing exposes termite colonies to the sun and predators, reducing their population.
*   **Irrigation:** Adequate irrigation can deter termites, as they prefer dry conditions.
*   **Farmyard Manure (FYM):** Ensure well-decomposed FYM is used, as undecomposed organic matter can attract termites.

**2. Chemical Control (Pre-planting/At-planting):**
For severe infestations, chemical treatment is often necessary.
*   **Soil Drench:**
    *   Apply **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** at 2.5 litres per acre mixed in 500-1000 litres of water as a pre-planting soil drench or incorporate into the soil before planting.
*   **Granular Application:**
    *   Apply **Fipronil 0.3% GR** at 8-10 kg per acre at the time of planting, mixed with the soil or applied in furrows.

### Control of Nematodes (Root-knot Nematodes) in Garlic

Root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.) are a major threat to garlic, causing characteristic galls on roots, stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, and significantly reducing bulb size and quality.

**1. Cultural Control:**
*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate garlic with non-host crops like cereals (wheat, maize, sorghum) for at least 2-3 years. Avoid continuous cultivation of susceptible crops like tomato, brinjal, okra, potato, and other vegetables.
*   **Use of Healthy Planting Material:** Always use nematode-free garlic cloves for planting.
*   **Solarization:** During the hot summer months, cover the moist field with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks. This raises soil temperature, killing nematodes and other soil-borne pathogens.
*   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or neem cake into the soil at 200-400 kg per acre 2-3 weeks before planting. Neem cake releases compounds that are toxic to nematodes and also promotes beneficial soil microbes.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris to prevent nematode build-up.

**2. Biological Control:**
*   **Bio-nematicides:** Apply formulations of beneficial fungi like *Purpureocillium lilacinum* (formerly *Paecilomyces lilacinus*) or *Trichoderma harzianum* to the soil at recommended doses (e.g., 2-4 kg/acre mixed with FYM) before planting. These fungi parasitize or antagonize nematodes.

**3. Chemical Control (Pre-planting/At-planting):**
For fields with a history of severe nematode infestation, chemical nematicides can be used.
*   **Granular Application:**
    *   Apply **Carbofuran 3% G** at 10-15 kg per acre at the time of planting, incorporated into the soil or applied in furrows.
*   **Drench/Drip Application:**
    *   Apply **Fluopyram 400 SC** at 200 ml per acre as a soil drench or through drip irrigation after planting, targeting the root zone.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label for dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) while handling chemicals.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and pest severity.
*   Regular monitoring of your field for pest incidence is crucial for timely intervention.
