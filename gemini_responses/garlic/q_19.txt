Addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium) in garlic is crucial for healthy growth and optimal bulb development. As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I strongly recommend **soil testing** as the first and most important step. A comprehensive soil test report will accurately identify the specific nutrient levels in your field and guide precise fertilizer application, preventing both deficiencies and over-application.

However, if you observe symptoms indicative of a deficiency, here's how to address them:

### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

Nitrogen is vital for vegetative growth and chlorophyll production.

*   **Symptoms:**
    *   General yellowing of older leaves, starting from the leaf tips and progressing inwards.
    *   Stunted plant growth and reduced vigor.
    *   Smaller, paler green leaves.
    *   Ultimately, reduced bulb size and yield.

*   **Addressing Nitrogen Deficiency:**
    *   **Basal Application (if not adequately applied at planting):**
        *   Apply 80-100 kg of Nitrogen per acre, typically split into a basal dose and 1-2 top-dressings.
        *   **Urea** (46% N): Apply 175-220 kg/acre in split doses.
        *   **Di-Ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5): Provides some N along with P.
    *   **Corrective Top-dressing (if deficiency observed post-planting):**
        *   Apply 20-30 kg of **Urea** per acre as a top-dressing, preferably 30-45 days after planting, followed by light irrigation.
    *   **Foliar Spray for Quick Uptake:**
        *   Prepare a 2% solution of **Urea** (20 g of Urea per litre of water).
        *   Spray 2-3 times at 10-15 day intervals, ensuring good leaf coverage.

### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

Phosphorus is essential for root development, energy transfer, and bulb formation.

*   **Symptoms:**
    *   Stunted growth and overall poor plant development.
    *   Dark green or purplish discoloration of older leaves, especially on the undersides.
    *   Poor root system development.
    *   Delayed maturity and reduced bulb size.

*   **Addressing Phosphorus Deficiency:**
    *   **Basal Application (most effective as P is immobile in soil):**
        *   Apply 40-60 kg of P2O5 per acre as a basal dose, incorporated into the soil before planting.
        *   **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5): Apply 250-375 kg/acre.
        *   **Di-Ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (46% P2O5): Apply 85-130 kg/acre.
    *   **Corrective Foliar Spray (less effective than basal, but can provide temporary relief):**
        *   Prepare a 1-2% solution of **Monoammonium Phosphate** (MAP) or **Di-Ammonium Phosphate** (DAP) (10-20 g per litre of water).
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, particularly during early growth stages.

### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency

Potassium (Potash) is crucial for water regulation, disease resistance, and bulb quality.

*   **Symptoms:**
    *   Yellowing and scorching (browning) of leaf margins, starting from older leaves.
    *   Weak stems and lodging.
    *   Poor bulb development and reduced storage quality.
    *   Increased susceptibility to diseases.

*   **Addressing Potassium Deficiency:**
    *   **Basal Application:**
        *   Apply 40-60 kg of K2O per acre as a basal dose, incorporated into the soil before planting.
        *   **Potassium Chloride (Muriate of Potash - MOP)** (60% K2O): Apply 65-100 kg/acre.
        *   **Potassium Sulphate (Sulphate of Potash - SOP)** (50% K2O): Apply 80-120 kg/acre.
    *   **Corrective Top-dressing (if deficiency observed):**
        *   Apply 20-30 kg of **Potassium Chloride** per acre as a top-dressing, followed by light irrigation.
    *   **Foliar Spray for Quick Uptake:**
        *   Prepare a 1-2% solution of **Potassium Nitrate** or **Potassium Sulphate** (10-20 g per litre of water).
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, especially during the bulb development stage.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Soil pH:** Ensure your soil pH is within the optimal range (6.0-7.0) for garlic, as extreme pH can affect nutrient availability even if nutrients are present in the soil.
*   **Organic Matter:** Incorporating well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost (10-15 tonnes/acre) improves soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability over time.
*   **Irrigation:** Proper irrigation is essential for nutrient uptake. Avoid waterlogging or severe drought stress.

Always consult your latest soil test report for precise recommendations tailored to your specific field conditions.
