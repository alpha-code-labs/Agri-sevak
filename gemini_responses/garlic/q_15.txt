As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling these conditions in Garlic in Haryana:

### Grasshopper

Grasshoppers are generalist feeders and can cause significant damage to young garlic plants by defoliation.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Deep ploughing after harvest to expose grasshopper eggs to predators and adverse weather conditions.
    *   Maintain field sanitation by removing weeds, which can serve as alternate hosts and breeding sites.
*   **Chemical Control (if infestation is severe):**
    *   **Malathion 50% EC:** Apply at 1.0 - 1.5 L per acre in 200-400 L of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** Apply at 100-125 ml per acre in 200-400 L of water.
    *   **Quinalphos 25% EC:** Apply at 600-800 ml per acre in 200-400 L of water.

### Painted bug (Bagrada hilaris)

This is not known to affect Garlic. The Painted bug is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., mustard, cabbage, radish).

### Red cotton bug (Dysdercus cingulatus)

This is not known to affect Garlic. The Red cotton bug is a specific pest of cotton and other malvaceous plants.

### Black Ants

Black ants generally do not directly feed on garlic plants. However, they can be problematic by:
*   Farming sap-sucking pests like aphids or mealybugs for their honeydew, thereby protecting these pests which *do* damage garlic.
*   Carrying away newly sown garlic cloves/seeds.
*   Building nests that can interfere with irrigation or root development.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Maintain good field hygiene and remove plant debris that can provide shelter for ants.
    *   If ants are farming other pests, focus on controlling the primary sap-sucking pest (e.g., aphids).
*   **Chemical Control (if ants are directly causing damage to cloves/seeds or are a significant nuisance):**
    *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC:** For drenching around ant nests, mix 2.5 ml per L of water and drench the affected areas. For broader soil application, it can be applied at 2.0 L per acre mixed with irrigation water, if approved for soil pests in garlic.
    *   **Fipronil 0.3% GR:** Apply at 6-8 kg per acre as a granular soil application, especially if ants are damaging newly planted cloves or young bulbs.
