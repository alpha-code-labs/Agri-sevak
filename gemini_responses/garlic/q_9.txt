Mites, including Red spider mite (Tetranychus urticae) and Rust mite (Aceria tulipae), can cause significant damage to garlic crops in Haryana. Effective management requires an integrated approach combining cultural practices and judicious use of CIBRC-approved acaricides.

Here's how to control them:

**I. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies:**

1.  **Field Sanitation:** Regularly remove weeds from and around the garlic field, as they can act as alternate hosts for mites.
2.  **Proper Irrigation:** Maintain adequate soil moisture. Water stress can make plants more susceptible to mite infestations. Overhead irrigation can sometimes help wash off mites, but ensure it doesn't promote fungal diseases.
3.  **Healthy Planting Material:** Use certified, mite-free garlic cloves for planting to prevent early infestation.
4.  **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect the underside of leaves for red spider mites (look for fine webbing and tiny moving dots) and observe symptoms like silvering, streaking, or twisting of leaves for rust mites. Early detection is crucial.
5.  **Crop Rotation:** Rotate garlic with non-allium crops to break the pest cycle.

**II. Chemical Control (Acaricides):**

When mite populations are high and causing economic damage, chemical control becomes necessary. Always ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the underside of leaves where mites often reside. Rotate different classes of acaricides to prevent the development of resistance.

Here are some CIBRC-approved technical chemicals effective against mites in garlic:

*   **For Red Spider Mite and Rust Mite:**
    *   **Abamectin** 1.8% EC: Apply 200-250 ml per acre. This is effective against both types of mites.
    *   **Spiromesifen** 240 SC: Apply 125 ml per acre. Highly effective against red spider mites.
    *   **Fenpyroximate** 5% SC: Apply 250-300 ml per acre. Effective against red spider mites.

*   **Primarily for Red Spider Mite:**
    *   **Propargite** 57% EC: Apply 1-1.25 Litres per acre. A broad-spectrum acaricide.

*   **Primarily for Rust Mite (Eriophyid Mite):**
    *   **Wettable Sulfur** 80% WP: Apply 2-2.5 kg per acre. This is a very effective and economical option for rust mites, and also helps in controlling some fungal diseases.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Spray Volume:** Always mix the recommended dose of the chemical in 200-250 litres of water per acre for effective coverage.
*   **Rotation:** To prevent resistance development, rotate between different chemical groups (e.g., use Spiromesifen, then Abamectin, then Propargite in subsequent sprays if needed).
*   **Safety:** Always read and follow the instructions on the product label, including dosage, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and safety precautions (wearing protective gear like gloves, mask, and eye protection).
*   **Timing:** Apply acaricides when mite populations are building up, before they cause severe damage. Repeat applications may be necessary based on infestation levels and product label recommendations.

By implementing these strategies, garlic growers in Haryana can effectively manage mite infestations and protect their yields.
