As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), here are the recommended cultivation practices for Garlic in Haryana:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   Garlic is primarily propagated vegetatively by planting individual cloves.
    *   The most common and recommended method is manual planting (dibbling) of cloves in furrows or on flatbeds.
    *   Planting should be done in rows to facilitate inter-cultivation, weeding, and harvesting.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   Cloves should be planted at a depth of 3-5 cm.
    *   Ensure the pointed end of the clove faces upwards for proper sprouting and bulb development.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   **Row-to-row spacing:** 15-20 cm
    *   **Plant-to-plant spacing:** 7.5-10 cm
    *   Adequate spacing ensures proper aeration, sunlight penetration, and allows for optimal bulb development.

*   **Seed Dose (Cloves per acre):**
    *   The recommended seed rate is approximately 200-250 kg of healthy, medium-sized cloves per acre.
    *   This quantity can vary slightly depending on the size of the cloves and the specific spacing adopted.
