Dear farmer,

Organic manures play a crucial role in improving soil health, fertility, and overall garlic yield and quality. Here are the recommended doses for Farmyard Manure (FYM), Vermicompost, and Sagarika for garlic cultivation:

*   **Farmyard Manure (FYM):**
    *   Apply 20-25 tonnes per acre (or 200-250 quintals per acre) during land preparation, about 2-3 weeks before planting. Ensure the FYM is well-decomposed.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   Apply 4-6 tonnes per acre during land preparation, either alone or in combination with FYM to enhance soil microbial activity and nutrient availability.

*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract):**
    *   Sagarika is a seaweed extract-based biostimulant, not a bulk manure. It helps in better nutrient uptake, root development, and stress tolerance.
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Mix 2-4 ml of **Sagarika** per litre of water.
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays during the crop cycle:
            *   First spray: 20-30 days after planting.
            *   Second spray: 45-60 days after planting (bulb initiation stage).
            *   Third spray (optional): 75-90 days after planting, if required.
    *   **Soil Drench/Drip Application:**
        *   Apply 1-2 litres of **Sagarika** per acre mixed with irrigation water during critical growth stages.

These recommendations aim to provide a balanced nutrient supply and improve the overall health and productivity of your garlic crop.
