As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding garlic maturity, harvesting, and cutting processes suitable for Haryana's conditions:

### Maturity Signs for Garlic

Identifying the correct maturity stage is crucial for optimal yield, quality, and storage life of garlic bulbs. Look for the following indicators:

*   **Leaf Yellowing and Drying:** The most prominent sign is the progressive yellowing and drying of the lower leaves, moving upwards.
*   **Remaining Green Leaves:** At the ideal harvest stage, typically 3 to 5 green leaves should still be visible on the plant. If too many leaves are green, the bulbs are immature; if all leaves are dry, the bulbs may have started to split or deteriorate.
*   **Softening of the Neck:** The pseudostem (neck) just above the bulb will start to soften and lose its rigidity.
*   **Bulb Development:** The bulbs will have reached their characteristic size and shape for the variety, and the outer wrappers will appear papery and firm.
*   **Scape Straightening (for Hardneck varieties):** If cultivating hardneck varieties (less common in Haryana but worth noting), the flower stalk (scape) will begin to straighten out from its initial curl.

### Harvesting Time for Garlic

The timing of harvest is critical to prevent premature harvesting (leading to smaller bulbs and poor storage) or delayed harvesting (leading to split bulbs, reduced quality, and susceptibility to diseases).

*   **General Duration:** Garlic is typically ready for harvest 120-150 days after planting, depending on the variety and environmental conditions. For garlic planted in October-November in Haryana, harvest usually occurs from March to April.
*   **Based on Maturity Signs:** Harvest when 50-75% of the leaves have turned yellow and dried, and 3-5 green leaves remain.
*   **Weather Conditions:** Choose a dry, sunny day for harvesting. Avoid harvesting immediately after rain or when the soil is wet, as this can make the bulbs prone to bruising and fungal infections.
*   **Method:** Gently loosen the soil around the bulbs with a spade or fork, taking care not to damage the bulbs. Pull the plants out of the ground by their tops. Shake off excess soil immediately.

### Cutting Process for Garlic (Post-Harvest)

The cutting process involves initial preparation for curing and then final trimming after curing. Curing is an essential step for long-term storage.

1.  **Initial Preparation (Pre-Curing):**
    *   After harvesting, do **not** cut the roots or tops immediately.
    *   Leave the entire plant (bulb, roots, and leaves) intact. This allows nutrients from the leaves to transfer to the bulb during the initial drying phase, enhancing bulb quality and storage life.
    *   Spread the harvested garlic in a single layer or hang them in small bunches in a well-ventilated, shaded area (e.g., under a shed, in a barn, or a well-ventilated room). Avoid direct sunlight, which can scorch the bulbs.

2.  **Curing Process:**
    *   Curing typically takes 2 to 4 weeks, depending on temperature, humidity, and air circulation.
    *   During curing, the outer wrappers dry and tighten around the cloves, the neck seals, and the moisture content of the bulb reduces, preparing it for storage. The roots will also dry out.

3.  **Final Trimming (Post-Curing):**
    *   Once the garlic is fully cured (the neck is completely dry and firm, and the outer wrappers are papery), proceed with final trimming:
        *   **Roots:** Trim the roots close to the basal plate, leaving about 0.5-1 cm of root stub.
        *   **Stems/Leaves:**
            *   For **softneck varieties** (most common in Haryana), cut the stem about 2.5-5 cm (1-2 inches) above the bulb. This allows for braiding or easy storage in mesh bags.
            *   For **hardneck varieties**, cut the hard stem about 2.5-5 cm (1-2 inches) above the bulb.
        *   **Outer Wrappers:** Gently remove any loose, dirty, or damaged outer wrappers, but ensure enough intact wrappers remain to protect the cloves.
    *   After trimming, grade the bulbs by size and quality before storing them in a cool, dry, and well-ventilated place.
