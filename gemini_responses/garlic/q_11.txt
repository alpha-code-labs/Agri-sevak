As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies in Garlic in Haryana:

### Control of Beetles in Garlic

Specific beetle species causing significant economic damage to garlic are not commonly reported as major pests in Haryana. While some generalist leaf-feeding beetles might occasionally feed on garlic foliage, the damage is usually minor and does not warrant specific chemical intervention. Therefore:

This is not known to affect Garlic significantly as a primary pest.

### Control of Weevils in Garlic

Allium weevils (e.g., *Ceutorhynchus suturalis*) can be a pest of garlic, with larvae boring into leaves and bulbs, causing wilting and reduced yield.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Weevils:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting garlic or other alliums (onion, leek, chive) in the same field for at least 2-3 years.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy all volunteer allium plants and crop residues after harvest, as these can harbor weevil populations.
    *   **Healthy Planting Material:** Use certified, disease-free garlic cloves for planting.
    *   **Timely Sowing:** Planting at the recommended time can help garlic establish before peak weevil activity.

2.  **Chemical Control (if infestation is severe):**
    *   **For Adult Weevils (Foliar Spray):**
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC**: 0.5 ml per litre of water (or 100-125 ml per acre in 200-250 litres of water).
        *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG**: 0.2 g per litre of water (or 80 g per acre in 400 litres of water).
    *   **For Larval Stages (Soil Application/Drench):**
        *   **Fipronil 0.3% GR**: 10-15 kg per acre (broadcast and incorporate into the soil before planting or as a side-dressing).
        *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC**: 2.5 litres per acre (as a soil drench, if specifically targeting soil-dwelling larvae and approved for the crop in your region).

### Control of Sawflies in Garlic

Sawflies are generally not considered pests of garlic or other alliums. They are more commonly associated with trees and some herbaceous plants, but not typically a primary pest of garlic. Therefore:

This is not known to affect Garlic.

**Important Note:** Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully, including dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI). Consult with your local agricultural extension officer for the most current and specific recommendations for your region and specific pest situation.
