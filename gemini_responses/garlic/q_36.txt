Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your commitment to maximizing the potential of your garlic crop. Improving yield, fruit quality, and storage life requires a holistic approach, integrating scientific agronomic practices with timely interventions. Here is my advice, tailored for the conditions in Haryana:

### 1. Improving Garlic Yield

To achieve higher yields, focus on robust plant growth and optimal bulb development:

*   **Variety Selection:** Choose high-yielding varieties well-suited to Haryana's climate. Recommended varieties include Yamuna Safed 3 (G-282), Yamuna Safed 4 (G-323), Yamuna Safed 5 (G-386), G-41, and G-1.
*   **Soil and Land Preparation:** Garlic thrives in well-drained, fertile sandy loam to clay loam soils. Prepare the land by deep ploughing, followed by 2-3 harrowing sessions to achieve a fine tilth. Incorporate 15-20 tonnes/acre of well-decomposed Farmyard Manure (FYM) or compost during land preparation.
*   **Planting Material and Spacing:** Use healthy, medium-sized cloves (8-10 mm diameter) from disease-free bulbs. Plant cloves at a depth of 5-7 cm, maintaining a row-to-row spacing of 10-15 cm and plant-to-plant spacing of 7.5-10 cm.
*   **Nutrient Management (Fertilizer Application):**
    *   Conduct a soil test to determine precise nutrient requirements. In the absence of a soil test, a general recommendation is 60-80 kg Nitrogen, 40-50 kg Phosphorus (P2O5), and 40-50 kg Potassium (K2O) per acre.
    *   Apply the full dose of Phosphorus and Potassium, along with half the Nitrogen, as a basal application at the time of planting.
    *   Apply the remaining half of Nitrogen in two equal splits: one at 30 days and the second at 60 days after planting.
    *   **Micronutrients:** Sulphur is crucial for pungency and yield; apply 20 kg/acre of elemental sulphur or gypsum. If deficiencies are observed or indicated by soil tests, apply foliar sprays of Zinc sulphate (0.5%) and Borax (0.2%).
*   **Irrigation:** Maintain consistent moisture, especially during critical stages of bulb initiation and development. Avoid waterlogging. Generally, 8-10 irrigations are required. Stop irrigation 15-20 days before harvest to aid curing.
*   **Weed Management:** Garlic is a poor competitor against weeds.
    *   **Pre-emergence:** Spray **Pendimethalin** 1.0 kg a.i./acre or **Oxyfluorfen** 0.2 kg a.i./acre within 3 days of planting.
    *   **Post-emergence:** Hand weeding is effective. For grassy weeds, **Quizalofop-ethyl** 50 g a.i./acre can be used.
*   **Pest and Disease Management:**
    *   **Thrips:** If infestation is observed, spray **Imidacloprid** 0.5 ml/L or **Fipronil** 1.5 ml/L.
    *   **Purple Blotch/Stemphylium Blight:** For fungal diseases, spray **Mancozeb** 2.5 g/L or **Chlorothalonil** 2.0 g/L or **Azoxystrobin** 0.5 ml/L.

### 2. Improving Fruit Quality (Bulb Quality)

High-quality garlic bulbs are uniform in size, firm, pungent, and free from blemishes.

*   **Variety Selection:** Choose varieties known for their uniform bulb size, good pungency, and attractive appearance.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Adequate supply of Potassium and Sulphur is vital for developing large, firm bulbs with good pungency. Avoid excessive nitrogen, especially in later stages, as it can lead to soft bulbs and poor storage.
*   **Timely and Consistent Irrigation:** Proper irrigation prevents cracking, irregular bulb shapes, and premature senescence, all of which reduce quality.
*   **Effective Pest and Disease Control:** Healthy foliage is essential for efficient photosynthesis and nutrient translocation to the bulb, resulting in well-formed, disease-free bulbs.
*   **Harvesting at Physiological Maturity:** Harvest when 50-70% of the leaves turn yellow and start drying from the tip. Harvesting too early results in small, soft bulbs, while delayed harvesting can lead to split bulbs or secondary root growth, both reducing quality.

### 3. Improving Storage Life

Extending the storage life of garlic bulbs is crucial for market flexibility and reducing post-harvest losses.

*   **Variety Selection:** Opt for varieties known for their good inherent storage potential.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure adequate Potassium and Sulphur application, as these nutrients contribute to bulb firmness and reduce storage losses. Avoid late-season nitrogen application.
*   **Field Sanitation and Disease Management:** Control soil-borne diseases like white rot (**Sclerotium cepivorum**) and fusarium basal rot in the field, as these can cause significant losses during storage.
    *   For White Rot: Treat cloves before planting with **Carbendazim** 2 g/kg cloves. In severe cases, soil drenching with **Carbendazim** 1.0 g/L at planting can be beneficial.
*   **Proper Harvesting:** Harvest at the correct maturity stage. Handle bulbs carefully during harvest to avoid mechanical injuries, which serve as entry points for storage pathogens.
*   **Curing:** This is the most critical step for improving storage life.
    *   **Field Curing:** After harvest, leave the bulbs in the field with their tops on for 4-7 days. Arrange them in windrows and cover the bulbs with their leaves to prevent sunscald.
    *   **Artificial Curing:** If weather conditions are unfavorable, cure bulbs in a well-ventilated shed at 25-30°C and 60-70% relative humidity for 10-15 days. Curing dries the neck, hardens the outer scales, and heals minor injuries, reducing moisture loss and pathogen entry.
*   **Sprout Suppression (Optional):** For very long-term storage, a foliar spray of **Maleic Hydrazide** 2500 ppm (2.5 g/L) applied 45-60 days before harvest can effectively suppress sprouting. *Ensure this practice is followed as per CIBRC guidelines for garlic in your region.*
*   **Storage Conditions:** Store properly cured bulbs in a cool (0-5°C for long-term storage, or ambient 25-30°C for short-to-medium term), dry (60-70% Relative Humidity), and well-ventilated place. Avoid piling bulbs too high to ensure good air circulation and prevent heat build-up and moisture condensation.

By diligently following these scientifically verified practices, you can significantly improve the yield, quality, and storage life of your garlic crop, leading to better returns.
