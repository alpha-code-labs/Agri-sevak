As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm the following regarding the conditions you've mentioned for Garlic cultivation in Haryana:

*   **Scab:** This is not known to affect Garlic as a distinct disease. While some fungal or bacterial infections can cause lesions on garlic bulbs, "Scab" is not a recognized primary disease name for garlic.
*   **Canker:** This is not known to affect Garlic. Canker diseases typically affect woody stems and branches, which are not characteristic of the garlic plant.
*   **Gummosis:** This is not known to affect Garlic. Gummosis is the exudation of gum, primarily observed in fruit trees, and garlic plants do not exhibit this symptom.
*   **Lichen:** This is not known to affect Garlic as a disease or pest. Lichens are symbiotic organisms that grow on surfaces like tree bark or rocks and do not parasitize or cause disease in living garlic plants.
