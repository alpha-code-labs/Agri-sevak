As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified weed control strategies for garlic cultivation in Haryana:

Effective weed management in garlic requires a combination of cultural practices and judicious use of herbicides.

### General Weed Control Strategy:

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Field Preparation:** Ensure thorough land preparation to reduce initial weed load.
    *   **Manual Weeding:** Two to three manual weedings are highly effective, especially during the initial 30-60 days after planting, when the crop is most vulnerable to weed competition.
    *   **Inter-cultivation:** Light inter-cultivation can help suppress weeds between rows.

2.  **Chemical Control (Herbicides):**

    **A. Pre-emergence Herbicides (Apply within 3 days of planting):**
    These herbicides are crucial for controlling a wide spectrum of weeds (broadleaf and narrowleaf) before they emerge, providing a clean start for the garlic crop. They also offer some suppression against parasitic weeds like Amarbail and Orobanche by affecting their germination or early attachment.

    *   For Broadleaf, Narrowleaf, Bathu, Congress grass, Phalaris minor, and suppression of Amarbail and Orobanche:
        *   **Pendimethalin 30% EC:** Apply 3.3 Litres per acre in 200-300 Litres of water.
        *   **Oxadiargyl 80% WP:** Apply 80-100 grams per acre in 200-300 Litres of water.

    **B. Post-emergence Herbicides (Apply when weeds are at 2-4 leaf stage, typically 20-30 days after planting):**
    These are used to control weeds that emerge after the pre-emergence application or those that escape initial control.

    *   **For Broadleaf Weeds (e.g., Bathu, Congress grass):**
        *   **Oxyfluorfen 23.5% EC:** Apply 200-250 ml per acre in 200-300 Litres of water. Ensure weeds are young and actively growing.

    *   **For Narrowleaf Weeds (e.g., Phalaris minor, other grasses):**
        *   **Quizalofop-ethyl 5% EC:** Apply 400-500 ml per acre in 200-300 Litres of water.
        *   **Fluazifop-P-butyl 13.4% EC:** Apply 300-400 ml per acre in 200-300 Litres of water.

### Specific Weed Management:

*   **Amarbail (Cuscuta spp.) and Orobanche (Broomrape):**
    *   These are parasitic weeds and are extremely challenging to control once established.
    *   **Pre-emergence application of Pendimethalin or Oxadiargyl is the primary chemical strategy for suppression** by inhibiting their germination or early attachment to the host.
    *   **Manual removal is critical:** For established Amarbail, carefully remove the parasitic strands before they flower and set seed. For Orobanche, dig out the shoots before they emerge above ground or at least before they flower and set seed. This prevents further spread.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting susceptible crops in infested fields for several years.

*   **Bathu (Chenopodium album) and Congress grass (Parthenium hysterophorus):**
    *   These are common broadleaf weeds effectively controlled by pre-emergence herbicides like **Pendimethalin** or **Oxadiargyl**, and post-emergence by **Oxyfluorfen**.

*   **Phalaris minor (Canary grass):**
    *   This is a major narrowleaf weed. It is well controlled by pre-emergence **Pendimethalin** and post-emergence graminicides like **Quizalofop-ethyl** or **Fluazifop-P-butyl**.

### Important Considerations for Herbicide Application:

*   **Timing:** Adhere strictly to the recommended application timings (pre-emergence or specific weed growth stages) for optimal efficacy and crop safety.
*   **Water Volume:** Always use the recommended water volume (200-300 Litres per acre) for uniform spray coverage.
*   **Nozzle Type:** Use a flat fan nozzle for herbicide application to ensure even distribution.
*   **Weather Conditions:** Apply herbicides on a calm day, avoiding windy conditions to prevent drift. Do not apply if rain is expected within 6-8 hours.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals. Read and follow all instructions on the product label.
*   **Rotation of Herbicides:** To prevent the development of herbicide resistance, it is advisable to rotate herbicides with different modes of action over seasons.
