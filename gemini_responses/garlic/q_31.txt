As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I would like to clarify that garlic produces bulbs, not fruits. The issues you've described are likely related to environmental stress and cultural practices rather than specific diseases or pests. Here's how to manage these conditions:

### 1. Bulb Cracking/Splitting (interpreting "Fruit bursting")

This refers to the splitting or cracking of the outer scales of the garlic bulb.
*   **Causes:**
    *   **Irregular Water Supply:** Dry periods followed by heavy irrigation can cause rapid expansion of the bulb, leading to cracking.
    *   **Excessive Nitrogen:** Over-application of nitrogen, especially during later stages of bulb development, can promote rapid vegetative growth and lead to splitting.
    *   **Late Harvest:** Delaying harvest beyond physiological maturity can cause the outer scales to become brittle and crack.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Consistent Irrigation:** Maintain uniform soil moisture throughout the growing season, particularly during the critical bulb development phase. Avoid extremes of drought and waterlogging.
    *   **Balanced Nutrition:** Apply nitrogen judiciously based on soil test recommendations. Avoid excessive nitrogen, especially after bulb initiation. Ensure adequate phosphorus and potassium for healthy bulb development.
    *   **Timely Harvest:** Harvest garlic bulbs when 50-75% of the leaves have dried and fallen over.

### 2. Leaf Burning/Melting

This refers to symptoms like scorching, browning, or breakdown of leaf tissue.
*   **Causes (Physical/Environmental):**
    *   **Sunscald:** Intense sunlight, especially when plants are stressed or after irrigation, can cause leaf scorching.
    *   **Salt Stress:** High concentrations of salts in irrigation water or soil can lead to leaf tip burn and marginal necrosis.
    *   **Chemical Burn:** Improper application of agrochemicals (e.g., herbicides, high-dose foliar sprays) or application during high temperatures can cause phytotoxicity and leaf burning.
    *   **Water Stress:** Both severe drought and waterlogging can lead to leaf tip burn or tissue breakdown.
    *   **Nutrient Deficiency:** Potassium deficiency often manifests as yellowing and burning of leaf tips and margins.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Optimal Irrigation:** Ensure adequate and consistent water supply. Avoid both water scarcity and waterlogging.
    *   **Soil and Water Testing:** Regularly test soil and irrigation water for salinity levels. Implement measures to manage salinity if high.
    *   **Judicious Chemical Application:** Always follow recommended dosages and application guidelines for all agrochemicals. Avoid spraying during peak sunlight or high temperatures.
    *   **Balanced Fertilization:** Conduct soil tests to identify nutrient deficiencies. Ensure adequate supply of essential nutrients, particularly potassium, for healthy leaf development.

### 3. Undesirable Hardness in Bulbs (interpreting "Hardness in fruit")

While firmness is a desirable trait in garlic bulbs for storage, an undesirable "hardness" that makes them difficult to use or indicates poor quality can occur.
*   **Causes:**
    *   **Environmental Stress:** Severe drought or high temperatures during bulb development can lead to small, dense, and sometimes prematurely hardened bulbs.
    *   **Nutrient Imbalance:** Inadequate phosphorus and potassium can affect proper bulb development and size.
    *   **Variety Selection:** Some varieties may naturally produce denser bulbs, but extreme hardness might indicate stress.
    *   **Premature Harvest:** Harvesting too early before full maturity can result in underdeveloped, hard cloves.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Consistent Moisture:** Provide adequate and consistent irrigation, especially during the critical bulb development phase.
    *   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure optimal availability of phosphorus and potassium, which are crucial for bulb sizing and quality.
    *   **Appropriate Variety Selection:** Choose garlic varieties well-suited to the local climate and growing conditions of Haryana.
    *   **Timely Harvest:** Allow bulbs to mature fully before harvest.

### Chemical Control

For the physical damage conditions described above, there are no specific CIBRC approved technical chemical names (pesticides/fungicides) for direct control. Management primarily relies on adopting appropriate cultural practices and environmental management.
