This is not known to affect Garlic.

Garlic (Allium sativum) is a bulb crop, and its economic part is the underground bulb. The terms "flower drop," "fruit drop," "tinda dropping," and "boll dropping" are typically associated with crops where the flower, fruit, or seed is the harvested economic part (e.g., cotton, tomato, cucurbits). While garlic does produce a flower stalk (scape) and flowers, the primary focus of cultivation is the development of the bulb, not the retention of flowers or fruits for harvest. Therefore, "dropping" in the context described is not a recognized issue affecting garlic yield.
