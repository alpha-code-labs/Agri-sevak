As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), here is information on specialized practices in Garlic:

*   **Pruning:** This is not known to affect Garlic. Garlic is a bulb crop where the leaves are crucial for photosynthesis and bulb development. Traditional pruning practices are not applicable or beneficial for garlic cultivation.
*   **Desuckering:** This is not known to affect Garlic. Garlic does not produce suckers in the manner of many fruit crops. However, some hardneck garlic varieties produce a flower stalk (scape) which is often removed to divert energy towards bulb development. This practice is sometimes referred to as "scape removal" rather than desuckering.
*   **Mulching:** Mulching is a highly beneficial practice for garlic cultivation in Haryana.
    *   **Benefits:** It helps in suppressing weeds, conserving soil moisture, moderating soil temperature (protecting bulbs from extreme heat or cold), and improving soil health over time.
    *   **Materials:** Organic mulches like straw, dried leaves, or wood chips are commonly used.
    *   **Application:** A layer of 5-10 cm of mulch can be applied after planting or once the garlic plants have established.
*   **Grafting:** This is not known to affect Garlic. Garlic is a monocotyledonous plant that is propagated vegetatively from cloves. Grafting is not a practice used in garlic cultivation.
*   **Pollination:** This is not known to affect Garlic as a specialized practice for commercial production. Garlic is primarily propagated asexually using cloves. While some varieties can produce flowers and even viable seeds, commercial garlic production relies almost exclusively on vegetative propagation, making pollination irrelevant for typical cultivation practices.
