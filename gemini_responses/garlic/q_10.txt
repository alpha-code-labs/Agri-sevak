As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for the control of pests in Garlic in Haryana:

It is important to correctly identify the pest causing damage. Based on your query, here is the information regarding Borers, Caterpillars, Diamondback moth, and Leaf folder in Garlic:

### 1. Borers

True borers (like stem borers in cereals) are not primary pests of Garlic. However, severe infestations of certain caterpillars (e.g., *Spodoptera litura*, *Spodoptera exigua*) can sometimes lead to feeding damage into the neck or bulb of the garlic plant, which might be perceived as 'boring' damage. In such cases, the control measures for caterpillars (detailed below) would be applicable.

### 2. Caterpillars

Caterpillars, such as the Tobacco Caterpillar (*Spodoptera litura*) and Beet Armyworm (*Spodoptera exigua*), can cause significant defoliation and damage to garlic plants.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Regular monitoring of fields to detect early infestations.
    *   Hand-picking and destroying larvae in small areas.
    *   Installation of pheromone traps at 5 traps per acre to monitor and mass-trap male moths.
*   **Chemical Control (Apply when pest incidence crosses Economic Threshold Level):**
    *   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG**: 88 g per acre (mixed in 200-250 litres of water).
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC**: 60 ml per acre (mixed in 200-250 litres of water).
    *   **Indoxacarb 14.5% SC**: 200 ml per acre (mixed in 200-250 litres of water).

### 3. Diamondback Moth (*Plutella xylostella*)

This is not known to affect Garlic. Diamondback moth is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower, mustard) and does not infest allium crops like garlic.

### 4. Leaf Folder

True leaf folders (e.g., *Cnaphalocrocis medinalis* in rice) are not known to affect Garlic due to its narrow leaf morphology. While caterpillars can cause feeding damage to garlic leaves, they do not typically exhibit the characteristic "folding" behavior seen in other crops. If caterpillars are causing significant leaf damage, the control measures listed under "Caterpillars" should be followed.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully.
*   Ensure proper spray coverage for effective control.
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
*   Observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) for any applied chemical.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions.
