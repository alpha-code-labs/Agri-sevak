As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I advise on protecting your garlic crop from environmental stresses common in Haryana. Proactive measures are crucial for maintaining plant health and ensuring good bulb development.

Here's how to protect your garlic from extreme cold, frost, heat/loo, and intense sunlight:

### 1. Protection from Extreme Cold and Frost

Garlic is relatively tolerant to cold, but severe frost can cause significant damage, especially during critical growth stages.

*   **Light Irrigation:** Before an anticipated frost event, apply a light irrigation (2-3 cm) to the field. Water has a higher specific heat capacity than air, so moist soil radiates heat more slowly, keeping the soil and surrounding air slightly warmer. This can raise the temperature by 1-2°C, often enough to prevent frost damage.
*   **Mulching:** Apply a 5-7 cm layer of organic mulch (e.g., wheat straw, paddy straw, dry leaves, sugarcane trash) around the base of the plants. Mulch insulates the soil, protecting the roots from freezing temperatures and reducing heat loss from the soil surface.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure balanced nutrition, particularly adequate **Potassium (K)**. Potassium plays a vital role in maintaining cell turgor and improving the plant's overall tolerance to cold stress.

### 2. Protection from Heat and Loo (Hot Winds)

High temperatures and dry, hot winds (Loo) can lead to wilting, scorching, and reduced bulb size.

*   **Consistent Irrigation:** Maintain consistent soil moisture through regular and adequate irrigation, especially during periods of high temperatures and hot winds. This helps in evaporative cooling of the plant canopy and prevents water stress, which exacerbates heat damage. Avoid both waterlogging and drought stress.
*   **Mulching:** Organic mulch helps in reducing soil temperature, conserving soil moisture, and mitigating the drying effects of hot winds.
*   **Adjusted Planting Time:** Plan your planting schedule to ensure that the critical bulb development stage of garlic does not coincide with the peak summer heat (typically May-June in Haryana). Early planting can help the crop mature before the onset of severe heat.

### 3. Protection from Intense Sunlight

While garlic needs ample sunlight for photosynthesis, prolonged exposure to intense sunlight, especially when combined with heat, can cause sunscald and stress.

*   **Mulching:** As mentioned, organic mulch protects the soil and roots from direct sun exposure, helping to maintain cooler soil temperatures and reducing stress on the plant.
*   **Healthy Canopy Development:** Ensure good plant growth and a healthy, dense canopy. A well-developed canopy provides natural shading for the soil and the lower parts of the plants, reducing direct sun exposure to the soil and bulb area.
*   **Foliar Application of Kaolin Clay:**
    *   **Kaolin clay** (e.g., **Surround WP**) can be sprayed as a protective film on the foliage. It acts as a physical barrier, reflecting sunlight and reducing the leaf temperature, thereby minimizing sunscald and heat stress.
    *   **Dosage:** Mix 2.5-5 kg of **Kaolin clay** per 100 litres of water (25-50 g/L). Apply as a fine spray to ensure uniform coverage of the foliage.
    *   **Application Frequency:** Reapply after heavy rains or every 10-14 days during periods of intense sunlight to maintain the protective film.
