Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified seed and soil treatment processes for garlic cultivation in Haryana to ensure a healthy crop and maximize yield. These treatments primarily target common seed-borne and soil-borne fungal diseases and nematodes that affect garlic.

### Recommended Seed Treatment Process for Garlic Cloves

Seed treatment is crucial to protect garlic cloves from seed-borne pathogens and early-season soil-borne diseases, ensuring better germination and stand establishment.

**Process:**
1.  Select healthy, disease-free cloves for planting.
2.  Prepare a slurry of the recommended chemical or bio-agent with a small amount of water.
3.  Evenly coat the garlic cloves with this slurry.
4.  Allow the treated cloves to dry in the shade for a few hours before planting.

**Treatment Options:**

*   **For Fungal Diseases (e.g., White Rot, Basal Rot, Damping-off):**
    *   **Chemical Treatment:**
        *   Treat cloves with a combination product of **Carbendazim** 12% + **Mancozeb** 63% WP at 2-3 g per kg of cloves.
        *   Alternatively, use **Thiram** 75% WS at 2.5-3 g per kg of cloves.
        *   Or, **Tebuconazole** 2% DS at 1-1.5 g per kg of cloves.
    *   **Biological Treatment (can be used alone or after chemical treatment for enhanced protection):**
        *   Treat cloves with *Trichoderma viride* 1% WP at 5-10 g per kg of cloves.

### Recommended Soil Treatment Process for Garlic

Soil treatment is essential to manage soil-borne diseases and nematodes that can severely impact garlic growth and bulb development.

**Process:**
1.  **For Granular Products:** Broadcast the recommended quantity uniformly over the field.
2.  **For Liquid/Wettable Powder Products:** Mix with the specified volume of water and apply as a drench or spray onto the soil surface.
3.  Incorporate the treatment into the top 10-15 cm of soil using a rotavator or plough before planting. For drench applications, light irrigation after application can help move the chemical into the root zone.
4.  For bio-agents, mix with well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost and allow it to sit for a week in a shaded area before broadcasting.

**Treatment Options:**

*   **For Soil-borne Fungal Diseases (e.g., White Rot, Basal Rot):**
    *   **Chemical Treatment (Pre-planting soil application):**
        *   Apply **Flutolanil** 22.5% SC at 1.5-2 L per acre, mixed with 200-400 L of water, as a drench or spray onto the soil surface before planting.
        *   Alternatively, apply **Propiconazole** 25% EC at 500 ml per acre, mixed with 200-400 L of water, as a drench.
    *   **Biological Treatment (Pre-planting soil application):**
        *   Mix *Trichoderma viride* 1% WP at 2-4 kg per acre with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost. Broadcast this mixture uniformly and incorporate into the soil 7-10 days before planting.

*   **For Nematodes (e.g., Root-knot Nematodes, Stem and Bulb Nematodes):**
    *   **Chemical Treatment (Pre-planting soil application):**
        *   Apply **Fluensulfone** 2% GR at 8-10 kg per acre, broadcasted and thoroughly incorporated into the soil before planting.
        *   Alternatively, **Carbofuran** 3% CG at 10-12 kg per acre, broadcasted and incorporated into the soil before planting. (Note: **Carbofuran** is a restricted-use pesticide; handle with extreme care and follow all safety guidelines).
        *   Or, **Phorate** 10% CG at 4 kg per acre, broadcasted and incorporated into the soil before planting. (Note: **Phorate** is also a restricted-use pesticide; handle with extreme care and follow all safety guidelines).

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions and safety precautions on the product label.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application.
*   Ensure proper soil moisture for effective treatment, especially for drench applications.
*   Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, including crop rotation, use of resistant varieties, and proper sanitation, should always be followed in conjunction with these treatments.
