Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can confirm that Scale insects and Mealybugs are indeed known pests that can affect garlic crops in Haryana. Effective management requires an integrated approach.

Here's how to control them:

**I. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**

1.  **Regular Monitoring:** Inspect your garlic plants frequently, especially the leaf axils and undersides of leaves, for early signs of these pests.
2.  **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy any heavily infested plant parts or entire plants to prevent further spread. Keep the field free of weeds, which can act as alternate hosts.
3.  **Healthy Planting Material:** Always use certified, pest-free garlic cloves for planting.
4.  **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to improve air circulation, which can reduce pest incidence.
5.  **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, as it can lead to lush, soft growth that is more attractive to sucking pests.

**II. Chemical Control (Use only CIBRC approved technical chemicals):**

For effective control, especially when infestations are severe, chemical intervention may be necessary. Systemic insecticides are often preferred due to the waxy coating of these pests. Always ensure thorough coverage during spraying.

1.  **For Scale Insects and Mealybugs:**
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** This is an insect growth regulator that interferes with the molting process of nymphs, making it effective against young stages of scales and mealybugs.
        *   Dosage: 2 ml per liter of water, or 1.25 litres per acre.
    *   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:** This is a systemic insecticide with two-way movement (xylem and phloem), providing excellent control of sucking pests, including scales and mealybugs.
        *   Dosage: 0.75 - 1 ml per liter of water, or 150 - 200 ml per acre.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** A systemic neonicotinoid insecticide effective against a broad range of sucking pests.
        *   Dosage: 0.5 g per liter of water, or 100 g per acre.
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Another systemic neonicotinoid, widely used for the control of sucking pests.
        *   Dosage: 0.5 ml per liter of water, or 100 ml per acre.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Safety First:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, mask, and protective clothing while handling and spraying chemicals.
*   **Read the Label:** Carefully read and follow the instructions, precautions, and waiting periods mentioned on the insecticide label before use.
*   **Spray Timing:** Spray during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate between different classes of insecticides to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.
*   **Integrated Pest Management (IPM):** Always integrate chemical control with cultural and biological methods for sustainable pest management.
