As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling various rot types in Garlic, keeping in mind the specific conditions and approved practices for Haryana, India.

It is important to understand that "rot" is a general term, and different pathogens cause different types of rot, often requiring specific management strategies. An integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods is most effective.

### General Principles for Rot Management in Garlic:

1.  **Healthy Planting Material:** Always use healthy, disease-free cloves from a reputable source.
2.  **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting garlic or other alliums (onion, leek, chives) in the same field for at least 3-5 years to reduce soil-borne pathogen build-up.
3.  **Soil Health & Drainage:** Ensure well-drained soil. Raised beds can help prevent waterlogging, which favors many rot pathogens. Improve soil organic matter.
4.  **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris from the field to prevent pathogen carryover.
5.  **Balanced Nutrition:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can make plants more susceptible to diseases.
6.  **Proper Spacing:** Maintain adequate plant spacing to ensure good air circulation and reduce humidity around the plants.
7.  **Solarization:** Soil solarization during the hot summer months can help reduce the inoculum of soil-borne pathogens.

### Specific Rot Types and Their Control:

#### 1. Root Rot, Stem Rot, Foot Rot, Collar Rot, Crown Rot, and Seedling Rot

These rot types are often caused by a complex of soil-borne fungi such as *Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cepae*, *Sclerotium rolfsii*, *Pythium* spp., and *Rhizoctonia solani*. They affect the plant at or below the soil line, leading to wilting, yellowing, stunted growth, and eventual plant death. Seedling rot (damping-off) affects young plants shortly after emergence.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural:**
    *   Implement all general principles mentioned above.
    *   Ensure proper irrigation to avoid waterlogging.
*   **Biological:**
    *   **Clove Treatment:** Treat cloves with bio-fungicides before planting.
        *   **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum**: 5-10 g/kg cloves.
        *   **Pseudomonas fluorescens**: 10 g/kg cloves.
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum**: 2.5 kg/acre mixed with 50-100 kg of Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost, applied at the time of planting or as a soil drench.
*   **Chemical:**
    *   **Clove Treatment (before planting):**
        *   **Carbendazim 50% WP**: 2 g/kg cloves.
        *   **Thiram 75% WS**: 2-3 g/kg cloves (often combined with Carbendazim for broader spectrum).
        *   **Metalaxyl-M 35% WS**: 3 g/kg cloves (especially effective against *Pythium*).
    *   **Soil Drench (at planting or early growth stage):**
        *   **Carbendazim 50% WP**: 1-2 g/L water (apply 500 L solution/acre).
        *   **Propiconazole 25% EC**: 1 ml/L water (apply 500 L solution/acre, effective against *Sclerotium*).
        *   **Validamycin 3% L**: 2-3 ml/L water (apply 500 L solution/acre, effective against *Rhizoctonia* and *Sclerotium*).
        *   **Metalaxyl-M 3.3% + Mancozeb 66.7% WP**: 2-2.5 g/L water (apply 500 L solution/acre).

#### 2. Neck Rot

Primarily caused by *Botrytis allii*, this is a significant post-harvest disease but can also initiate in the field. It causes softening and decay of the neck and outer scales of the bulb, often with a grey mold growth.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural:**
    *   Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization late in the season.
    *   Allow foliage to mature and dry down naturally before harvest.
    *   Harvest bulbs carefully to avoid injury.
    *   **Crucial for Neck Rot:** Proper curing is essential. Cure bulbs in a well-ventilated, dry place for 2-3 weeks immediately after harvest. This helps the neck dry and seal, preventing pathogen entry.
    *   Store bulbs in cool, dry, well-ventilated conditions (e.g., 0-4°C and 60-70% relative humidity).
*   **Chemical (Pre-harvest spray):**
    *   **Carbendazim 50% WP**: 1 g/L water, applied 2-3 weeks before harvest.
    *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC**: 0.5-1 ml/L water, applied 2-3 weeks before harvest.
    *   **Pyraclostrobin 5% + Metiram 55% WG**: 2-2.5 g/L water, applied 2-3 weeks before harvest.

#### 3. Black Rot

Caused by *Aspergillus niger*, this disease typically appears during storage, especially under warm and humid conditions, but can start in the field if bulbs are stressed or injured. It manifests as black powdery masses of spores between the scales, often starting at the neck.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural:**
    *   Harvest bulbs carefully to avoid injury.
    *   Ensure proper curing as described for Neck Rot.
    *   Store bulbs in cool, dry, well-ventilated conditions.
    *   Discard any damaged or diseased bulbs before storage.
*   **Chemical (Pre-harvest spray):**
    *   **Carbendazim 50% WP**: 1 g/L water, applied 2-3 weeks before harvest.
    *   **Mancozeb 75% WP**: 2.5 g/L water, applied 2-3 weeks before harvest.

#### 4. Fruit Rot

This is not known to affect Garlic. Garlic produces bulbs, which are modified stems, not botanical fruits.

#### 5. Seed Rot

This is not known to affect Garlic. Garlic is propagated vegetatively by cloves, not true seeds. However, cloves can rot before sprouting (pre-emergence damping-off), which is covered under "Root Rot, Stem Rot, Foot Rot, Collar Rot, Crown Rot, and Seedling Rot" with clove treatment recommendations.

### Important Considerations:

*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in pathogens.
*   **Safety:** Always read and follow the instructions on the chemical label, including dosage, application method, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and safety precautions. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).
*   **Integrated Pest Management (IPM):** Combine all available methods (cultural, biological, chemical) for sustainable and effective disease management.

For specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions, it is always advisable to consult with the plant pathology experts at HAU, Hisar, or your local agricultural extension office.
