As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following fertilizer doses for Garlic cultivation in Haryana. Please note that these are general recommendations, and a soil test is highly recommended to determine the precise nutrient requirements for your specific field conditions.

**General Nutrient Requirements for Garlic (per acre):**
*   **Nitrogen (N):** 80-100 kg
*   **Phosphorus (P2O5):** 40-50 kg
*   **Potassium (K2O):** 40-50 kg
*   **Sulphur (S):** 20 kg

Based on these requirements, here are the recommended doses for specific fertilizers:

*   **Urea (46% N)**
    *   **Dose:** 175-220 kg/acre.
    *   **Application:** Apply 1/3rd of the total Urea (approx. 60-75 kg/acre) as a basal dose at the time of planting. The remaining 2/3rd should be applied in two equal splits as top-dressing:
        *   First top-dressing: 30-45 days after planting.
        *   Second top-dressing: 60-75 days after planting.

*   **Nano-Urea (Liquid, 4% N)**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml/L of water for foliar spray.
    *   **Application:** Apply 2-3 foliar sprays during the active vegetative growth and bulb development stages (e.g., 30-45 days and 60-75 days after planting). Nano-Urea is a supplement to granular Urea and does not fully replace it.

*   **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP) (18% N, 46% P2O5)**
    *   **Dose:** 90-110 kg/acre.
    *   **Application:** Apply the entire dose as a basal application at the time of planting. This will provide the required Phosphorus and a part of the Nitrogen. If using DAP, adjust the Urea dose accordingly (reduce Urea by approximately 40 kg/acre).

*   **Nano-DAP (Liquid, 8% N, 16% P2O5)**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml/L of water for foliar spray.
    *   **Application:** Apply 2-3 foliar sprays during the active growth phases, particularly when nutrient uptake from soil might be limited or to boost early growth. Nano-DAP is a supplement to granular DAP/SSP.

*   **NPK (Complex Fertilizers)**
    *   **Dose:** The dose depends on the specific NPK ratio (e.g., 12:32:16, 19:19:19).
    *   **Application:** If using an NPK complex fertilizer as a basal dose, choose a formulation that provides the required P2O5 and K2O, and a portion of N. For example, to meet P and K requirements, you might use 125-150 kg/acre of NPK (12:32:16) as a basal dose, and then supplement with Urea for the remaining Nitrogen.

*   **Single Super Phosphate (SSP) (16% P2O5, 11-12% S)**
    *   **Dose:** 250-315 kg/acre.
    *   **Application:** Apply the entire dose as a basal application at the time of planting. SSP is an excellent choice for garlic as it provides both Phosphorus and Sulphur, which are crucial for bulb development and pungency. If using SSP, you will not need additional Sulphur.

*   **Potash (Muriate of Potash - MOP) (60% K2O)**
    *   **Dose:** 70-85 kg/acre.
    *   **Application:** Apply the entire dose as a basal application at the time of planting.

*   **Sulphur (Elemental Sulphur 90%)**
    *   **Dose:** 22-25 kg/acre.
    *   **Application:** Apply as a basal dose at the time of planting. This is essential if you are not using SSP as your primary Phosphorus source. Sulphur is critical for the characteristic flavour and pungency of garlic, as well as for overall yield.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Soil Testing:** Always conduct a soil test before planting to get precise recommendations tailored to your field's nutrient status. HAU provides soil testing services.
*   **Organic Matter:** Incorporating well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost (20-25 tonnes/acre) 2-3 weeks before planting significantly improves soil health and nutrient availability, reducing the need for synthetic fertilizers.
*   **Micronutrients:** Garlic also benefits from micronutrients like Zinc and Boron. If soil tests indicate deficiencies, apply Zinc Sulphate (25 kg/acre) and Borax (5 kg/acre) as a basal dose.
*   **Irrigation:** Ensure adequate and timely irrigation, especially after fertilizer application, to facilitate nutrient uptake.
