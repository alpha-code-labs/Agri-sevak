Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist from Haryana Agricultural University (HAU), Hisar, I am providing scientifically verified advice for managing fungal diseases in garlic in Haryana. Effective management relies on a combination of cultural practices and timely application of CIBRC-approved fungicides.

### General Cultural Practices for Fungal Disease Management:
*   **Use healthy planting material:** Always source disease-free cloves for planting.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting garlic or other alliums in the same field for at least 2-3 years.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest to reduce inoculum.
*   **Optimal Spacing:** Maintain recommended plant spacing to ensure good air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce humidity.
*   **Irrigation Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day, to minimize leaf wetness duration. Drip irrigation is preferable.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure balanced fertilization. Excessive nitrogen can make plants more susceptible to certain fungal diseases.

### Specific Fungal Diseases and their Control:

#### 1. Alternaria (Purple Blotch, caused by *Alternaria porri*)
This disease causes small, water-soaked lesions that enlarge into purple spots with concentric rings, often surrounded by a yellow halo. Severe infection can lead to blighting of leaves.

*   **Preventive/Early Stage Application:**
    *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP at 2.5 kg/acre (mixed in 500-750 L of water).
    *   **Chlorothalonil** 75% WP at 1.5-2.0 kg/acre (mixed in 500-750 L of water).
*   **Curative/Advanced Stage Application (Rotate with contact fungicides):**
    *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC at 200 ml/acre (mixed in 200-400 L of water).
    *   **Propiconazole** 25% EC at 200 ml/acre (mixed in 200-400 L of water).
    *   **Difenoconazole** 25% EC at 100 ml/acre (mixed in 200-400 L of water).
    *   **Tebuconazole** 25% EC at 200 ml/acre (mixed in 200-400 L of water).
    *   **Pyraclostrobin 5% + Metiram 55% WG** at 1.0-1.5 kg/acre (mixed in 500-750 L of water).

#### 2. Anthracnose (caused by *Colletotrichum gloeosporioides*)
Symptoms include water-soaked lesions on leaves, which turn brown and may develop pinkish spore masses under humid conditions. It can also affect bulbs.

*   **Preventive/Early Stage Application:**
    *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP at 2.5 kg/acre (mixed in 500-750 L of water).
    *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 250-500 g/acre (mixed in 200-400 L of water).
*   **Curative Application:**
    *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC at 200 ml/acre (mixed in 200-400 L of water).
    *   **Propiconazole** 25% EC at 200 ml/acre (mixed in 200-400 L of water).
    *   **Difenoconazole** 25% EC at 100 ml/acre (mixed in 200-400 L of water).

#### 3. Blast (Botrytis Leaf Blight / Grey Mould, caused by *Botrytis squamosa* or *Botrytis cinerea*)
This disease causes small, white, sunken lesions on leaves, which expand rapidly into large, watersoaked areas, leading to blighting of leaves. It can also cause neck rot in storage.

*   **Preventive/Early Stage Application:**
    *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP at 2.5 kg/acre (mixed in 500-750 L of water).
    *   **Chlorothalonil** 75% WP at 1.5-2.0 kg/acre (mixed in 500-750 L of water).
*   **Curative Application:**
    *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 250-500 g/acre (mixed in 200-400 L of water).
    *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC at 200 ml/acre (mixed in 200-400 L of water).
    *   **Pyraclostrobin 5% + Metiram 55% WG** at 1.0-1.5 kg/acre (mixed in 500-750 L of water).
    *   **Boscalid 26.7% + Pyraclostrobin 6.7% WG** at 600-750 g/acre (mixed in 200-400 L of water).

#### 4. Blight (General)
This is a general term. The specific blights affecting garlic are covered under Alternaria (Purple Blotch) and Botrytis (Leaf Blight) above.

#### 5. Brown Spot
This is not known to affect Garlic as a distinct primary disease. Brown spots are often symptoms associated with other diseases like Alternaria or Stemphylium leaf blight. Control measures for these specific diseases will address such symptoms.

#### 6. Downy Mildew (caused by *Peronospora destructor*)
Characterized by pale green to yellow spots or streaks on older leaves, which later turn purplish-brown. A purplish-grey fuzzy growth (spores) can be seen on infected leaves, especially in humid conditions.

*   **Preventive/Early Stage Application:**
    *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP at 2.5 kg/acre (mixed in 500-750 L of water).
    *   **Propineb** 70% WP at 1.5-2.0 kg/acre (mixed in 500-750 L of water).
    *   **Chlorothalonil** 75% WP at 1.5-2.0 kg/acre (mixed in 500-750 L of water).
*   **Curative/Systemic Application (Rotate with contact fungicides):**
    *   **Dimethomorph 9% + Mancozeb 60% WP** at 1.0 kg/acre (mixed in 500-750 L of water).
    *   **Cymoxanil 8% + Mancozeb 64% WP** at 1.5 kg/acre (mixed in 500-750 L of water).
    *   **Fenamidone 10% + Mancozeb 50% WG** at 1.0 kg/acre (mixed in 500-750 L of water).
    *   **Metalaxyl-M 4% + Mancozeb 64% WP** at 1.0 kg/acre (mixed in 500-750 L of water).
    *   **Fluopicolide 6.25% + Propamocarb Hydrochloride 62.5% SC** at 1.0-1.2 ml/L of water (200-240 ml/acre).

#### 7. Powdery Mildew (caused by *Leveillula taurica*)
While less common and severe in garlic compared to downy mildew, it can occur. Symptoms include white, powdery patches on the leaf surface.

*   **Application:**
    *   **Sulphur** 80% WP at 1.0-1.5 kg/acre (mixed in 500-750 L of water).
    *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC at 200 ml/acre (mixed in 200-400 L of water).
    *   **Propiconazole** 25% EC at 200 ml/acre (mixed in 200-400 L of water).
    *   **Tebuconazole** 25% EC at 200 ml/acre (mixed in 200-400 L of water).

#### 8. Grey Mildew
This is likely a common name referring to Botrytis (Grey Mould). Please refer to the control measures for "Blast (Botrytis Leaf Blight / Grey Mould)" above.

### Important Considerations:
*   **Fungicide Rotation:** Always rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in fungal pathogens.
*   **Timing:** Apply fungicides preventively or at the very first sign of disease symptoms for best efficacy.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough spray coverage of the entire plant foliage.
*   **Safety:** Always read and follow the instructions on the fungicide label, including dosage, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and personal protective equipment (PPE).
