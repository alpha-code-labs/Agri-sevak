As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for garlic cultivation in Haryana:

**Ideal Transplantation Time, Distance, and Process for Garlic**

Garlic (Allium sativum) is a crucial rabi crop in Haryana. Proper transplantation practices are vital for achieving optimal yield and quality.

**1. Ideal Transplantation Time:**
*   The ideal time for planting garlic in Haryana is from **mid-October to mid-November**.
*   Early planting within this window (e.g., first half of October) is often preferred as it allows for a longer growing period, leading to better bulb development and higher yields before the onset of warmer temperatures.

**2. Ideal Transplantation Distance:**
*   **Row-to-row spacing:** 15-20 cm
*   **Plant-to-plant spacing:** 7.5-10 cm
*   This spacing ensures adequate room for bulb development, proper air circulation, and ease of intercultural operations.

**3. Ideal Transplantation Process:**

*   **Land Preparation:**
    *   Select well-drained, fertile loamy soils.
    *   Plough the field 2-3 times to a fine tilth, followed by harrowing.
    *   Incorporate 20-25 tonnes/acre of well-rotted Farmyard Manure (FYM) or compost during the last ploughing to enrich the soil.
    *   Prepare flat beds or raised beds (especially beneficial in areas prone to waterlogging).

*   **Clove Selection:**
    *   Use healthy, disease-free, medium-sized cloves from the outer whorl of the mother bulb.
    *   Avoid very small, damaged, or diseased cloves, as they lead to poor germination and weak plants.
    *   Separate the cloves from the bulb just before planting to prevent desiccation and maintain viability.

*   **Planting:**
    *   Plant the cloves individually by hand.
    *   Ensure the pointed end of the clove faces upwards and the basal plate (rooting end) faces downwards.
    *   Planting depth should be 3-5 cm.
    *   Gently press the soil around each clove to ensure good soil-to-clove contact, which is essential for proper root development.

*   **Post-Planting Care:**
    *   Immediately after planting, provide a light irrigation to ensure good moisture for germination.
    *   Maintain adequate soil moisture throughout the growing period, especially during bulb development, but avoid waterlogging.
    *   Timely weeding is crucial in the initial stages to prevent competition for nutrients and light.
