Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the challenges posed by sucking pests in garlic cultivation. Effective management is crucial for maintaining yield and quality. Here is a scientifically verified approach to control Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips in garlic.

**Regarding Psylla:**
This is not known to affect Garlic.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategy for Sucking Pests in Garlic:**

A comprehensive IPM approach combines cultural, biological, and chemical methods for sustainable pest control.

**1. Cultural Practices:**

*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy crop residues after harvest to reduce overwintering pest populations.
*   **Weed Management:** Keep the field and surrounding areas free of weeds, as many weeds serve as alternate hosts for these pests.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-allium crops to break the pest cycle.
*   **Optimized Planting Time:** Plant garlic at recommended times to avoid peak pest periods.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush growth that attracts sucking pests.
*   **Water Management:** Ensure proper irrigation, as water stress can make plants more susceptible.
*   **Monitoring:** Regularly scout your fields (at least twice a week) to detect pest infestations early. Look for curled leaves, sticky honeydew, sooty mold, and the presence of nymphs and adults on the underside of leaves.

**2. Biological Control:**

*   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Encourage beneficial insects like ladybird beetles, lacewings, hoverfly larvae, and parasitic wasps, which prey on aphids and other soft-bodied insects. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficials.
*   **Biopesticides:** Consider using neem-based formulations (e.g., Azadirachtin 1500 ppm or 3000 ppm) at early stages of infestation. These act as antifeedants and growth regulators.
    *   **Azadirachtin 1500 ppm:** 2.5-5.0 ml/L of water (or 500-1000 ml/acre)
    *   **Azadirachtin 3000 ppm:** 1.5-2.5 ml/L of water (or 300-500 ml/acre)

**3. Chemical Control (Use only when necessary and as per label instructions):**

When pest populations reach economic threshold levels, chemical intervention may be required. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the underside of leaves.

Here are some CIBRC approved technical chemicals effective against sucking pests in garlic:

*   **For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips:**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** 125 ml per acre
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** 50-100 g per acre
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** 100-125 g per acre
    *   **Fipronil 5% SC:** 600-800 ml per acre (particularly effective against Thrips)
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** 200-250 ml per acre (provides quick knockdown)

*   **Specifically for Thrips (major pest in garlic):**
    *   **Spinosad 45% SC:** 60-75 ml per acre (effective and relatively safer for beneficials)

*   **Specifically for Whiteflies (nymphs) and Hoppers:**
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** 600-800 ml per acre (Insect Growth Regulator, targets nymphs)
    *   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** 160-200 ml per acre (also effective against mites and some thrips)

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Spray Volume:** Use adequate water volume (typically 200-400 litres per acre, depending on crop stage) to ensure proper coverage.
*   **Timing of Application:** Apply insecticides during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   **Safety Precautions:** Always wear personal protective equipment (PPE) like gloves, mask, and protective clothing while handling and spraying chemicals.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Strictly observe the pre-harvest interval mentioned on the insecticide label to ensure the produce is safe for consumption.
*   **Consult Experts:** For specific recommendations based on your field conditions and pest severity, always consult with local agricultural extension officers or HAU experts.

By adopting these practices, you can effectively manage sucking pests in your garlic crop and ensure a healthy harvest.
