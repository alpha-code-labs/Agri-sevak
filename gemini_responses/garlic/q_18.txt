As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified recommendations for the use of growth regulators and boron in garlic cultivation in Haryana:

### Recommended Doses of Growth Regulators/Hormones and Boron in Garlic

**1. Ethephon (Ethrel)**
*   **Purpose:** Ethephon is a plant growth regulator that releases ethylene, which can promote uniform bulb development and maturity in garlic.
*   **Recommended Dose:** Foliar spray of **Ethephon** at a concentration of 250-500 ppm (0.25-0.5 g of active ingredient per liter of water).
*   **Timing:** Apply as a foliar spray at the bulb initiation stage, typically around 60-75 days after planting. Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.

**2. 2,4-D (2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid)**
*   **Recommendation:** 2,4-D is primarily used as a selective herbicide for broadleaf weeds and is not generally recommended as a growth regulator for garlic in Haryana. Its application as a growth regulator can lead to phytotoxicity, deformities, and adverse effects on garlic plants, especially at concentrations that might be effective for growth regulation in other crops. Therefore, its use for growth regulation in garlic is not advised.

**3. Boron**
*   **Purpose:** Boron is an essential micronutrient crucial for cell wall formation, sugar transport, flowering, and overall plant growth and development, directly impacting bulb size and quality in garlic. It is not a hormone but is vital for physiological processes.
*   **Recommended Dose (Foliar Application):**
    *   Foliar spray of 0.1% - 0.2% solution of **Boric acid** (1-2 g of **Boric acid** per liter of water).
    *   **Timing:** Apply two foliar sprays:
        1.  First spray at 45-60 days after planting (during active vegetative growth).
        2.  Second spray at the bulb initiation stage, around 75-90 days after planting.
*   **Recommended Dose (Soil Application, if soil test indicates deficiency):**
    *   Apply 1-2 kg of **Borax** (Disodium tetraborate decahydrate) per acre, mixed with basal fertilizers at the time of planting. Soil application should be based on soil test reports indicating boron deficiency. Foliar application is generally more efficient for quick correction of micronutrient deficiencies.
