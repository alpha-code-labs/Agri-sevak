As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling weeds in Sudan Grass in Haryana:

**General Principles for Weed Management in Sudan Grass:**

Effective weed control in Sudan Grass (Sorghum × drummondii) involves a combination of cultural practices and judicious use of herbicides.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Land Preparation:** Thorough ploughing and harrowing help in burying weed seeds and reducing their emergence.
    *   **Seed Quality:** Use certified, weed-free Sudan Grass seeds to prevent the introduction of new weed species.
    *   **Timely Sowing:** Sowing at the optimal time allows the Sudan Grass to establish quickly and outcompete weeds.
    *   **Optimal Plant Density:** Maintain recommended plant spacing and density to ensure a vigorous crop canopy that shades out weeds.
    *   **Inter-cultivation:** Manual weeding or light hoeing during the early growth stages (up to 3-4 weeks after sowing) can be highly effective for controlling emerging weeds.

**Chemical Control:**

**1. Broadleaf Weeds (including Bathu and Congress grass):**

*   **Pre-emergence Application (within 3 days of sowing):**
    *   Apply **Atrazine** at 0.5-0.75 kg active ingredient per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water. Ensure adequate soil moisture for optimal efficacy.
    *   Alternatively, apply **Pendimethalin** at 1.0 kg active ingredient per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water.
    *   Alternatively, apply **S-metolachlor** at 0.75-1.0 kg active ingredient per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water.
*   **Post-emergence Application (when Sudan Grass is 15-30 cm tall, avoiding flowering stage):**
    *   For broadleaf weeds, apply **2,4-D amine salt** at 0.5 kg active ingredient per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water. Ensure uniform coverage. Avoid spraying during very hot conditions or when the crop is under stress.
    *   Alternatively, apply **Dicamba** at 0.1-0.15 kg active ingredient per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water. Use with caution as Sudan Grass can be sensitive; follow label instructions precisely.

**2. Narrowleaf Weeds (including Phalaris minor):**

*   **Pre-emergence Application (within 3 days of sowing):**
    *   Apply **Pendimethalin** at 1.0 kg active ingredient per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water.
    *   Alternatively, apply **S-metolachlor** at 0.75-1.0 kg active ingredient per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water.
*   **Post-emergence Application:**
    *   Selective post-emergence herbicides for grass weeds in Sudan Grass are very limited due to Sudan Grass itself being a grass. Manual weeding or inter-cultivation is often the most practical and recommended solution for established grass weeds.

**3. Amarbail (Cuscuta spp. - Dodder):**

*   **Preventive Measures are Crucial:**
    *   Use only certified, dodder-free Sudan Grass seeds.
    *   Thoroughly clean farm machinery and tools to prevent the spread of dodder seeds.
    *   Manually remove any dodder-infested plants or patches from the field and surrounding areas before they set seed.
    *   Deep ploughing can help bury dodder seeds and reduce their germination.
*   **Chemical Control (Limited options in standing crop):**
    *   **Pre-emergence:** **Pendimethalin** at 1.0 kg active ingredient per acre, applied within 3 days of sowing, can offer some suppression of dodder germination.
    *   Once dodder has attached to the Sudan Grass, selective chemical control without harming the crop is extremely difficult. Spot application of non-selective herbicides like **Paraquat dichloride** (0.5-1.0 kg active ingredient per acre) can be used to kill dodder patches *before crop emergence* or in *non-cropped areas* to prevent spread. This is not for use in a standing crop.

**4. Orobanche (Broomrape):**

*   This is not known to affect Sudan Grass. Orobanche species are primarily parasitic on dicotyledonous plants.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and strictly follow the label instructions of the herbicide product for correct dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Ensure proper calibration of spray equipment for accurate and uniform application.
*   Consider soil type, moisture conditions, and crop stage before herbicide application.
*   Observe any pre-harvest intervals (PHI) mentioned on the herbicide label, especially since Sudan Grass is a forage crop.
