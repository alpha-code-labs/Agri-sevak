As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling sucking pests in Sudan Grass in Haryana.

Firstly, it is important to clarify the pest complex:

*   **Psylla:** This is not known to affect Sudan Grass. Psyllids are generally host-specific and are not considered a pest of Sudan Grass.

For the control of Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips in Sudan Grass, an integrated pest management (IPM) approach is recommended, combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Timely Sowing:** Ensure timely sowing to allow the crop to establish well before pest populations build up.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, as it can lead to lush growth that is more attractive to sucking pests.
    *   **Weed Control:** Keep the field free of weeds, which can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation to break pest cycles.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Encourage natural enemies such as ladybird beetles, lacewings, hoverfly larvae, and parasitic wasps, which prey on aphids and other sucking pests. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

3.  **Chemical Control:**
    When pest populations reach economic threshold levels, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where many sucking pests reside. Use the following CIBRC approved technical chemicals:

    *   For Aphids, Leafhoppers, and Whiteflies:
        *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** 125-150 ml per acre.
        *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** 50-100 g per acre.
        *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** 80-100 g per acre.
        *   **Dimethoate 30% EC:** 300-400 ml per acre.

    *   For Thrips (and also effective against Leafhoppers and some Whiteflies):
        *   **Fipronil 5% SC:** 400-600 ml per acre.
        *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** 80-100 g per acre.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always mix the recommended quantity of insecticide in 200-250 litres of water per acre for effective coverage.
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.
*   Observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) for any insecticide used, especially since Sudan Grass is a fodder crop. Consult the product label for specific PHI recommendations.
*   Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying operations.
*   Follow all safety guidelines and disposal instructions provided on the product label.
