As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for improving yield, fodder quality, and storage life for Sudan Grass (Sorghum × drummondii) in Haryana.

### Improving Yield for Sudan Grass

To maximize green fodder yield in Sudan Grass, focus on the following agronomic practices:

1.  **Variety Selection:**
    *   Choose high-yielding, multi-cut varieties recommended for Haryana, such as those developed by HAU or other ICAR institutions. These varieties are typically selected for good tillering, rapid growth, and high biomass production.
2.  **Optimal Sowing Time and Method:**
    *   **Sowing Time:** The ideal sowing time in Haryana is from mid-March to mid-July, depending on the availability of irrigation and subsequent cuts. Early sowing (March-April) allows for more cuts.
    *   **Sowing Method:**
        *   **Line Sowing:** 25-30 cm row spacing, with a seed rate of 25-30 kg/acre. This allows for better light penetration, air circulation, and easier inter-cultivation.
        *   **Broadcasting:** If broadcasting, increase the seed rate to 35-40 kg/acre to ensure adequate plant stand.
    *   **Depth:** Sow seeds at a depth of 2-3 cm.
3.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Nitrogen (N):** Crucial for vegetative growth. Apply 40 kg N/acre as a basal dose, followed by 20 kg N/acre after each cut (except the last).
        *   **Chemicals:** Use **Urea** (46% N) or **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5).
    *   **Phosphorus (P):** Important for root development and overall plant vigor. Apply 20 kg P2O5/acre as a basal dose.
        *   **Chemicals:** Use **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)** or **Single Superphosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5).
    *   **Potassium (K):** Enhances disease resistance and water use efficiency. Apply 10-15 kg K2O/acre as a basal dose, especially on light-textured soils.
        *   **Chemicals:** Use **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** (60% K2O).
    *   **Micronutrients:** If soil tests indicate deficiencies, apply micronutrients like Zinc (Zn) or Iron (Fe).
        *   **Zinc:** Apply 10 kg **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** (21% Zn) per acre as basal, or foliar spray 0.5% **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** solution.
        *   **Iron:** For iron chlorosis, spray 0.5-1% **Ferrous Sulphate** solution.
4.  **Water Management:**
    *   Sudan Grass is relatively drought-tolerant but responds well to irrigation. Provide irrigation immediately after sowing, and then at intervals of 10-15 days, depending on soil type and weather conditions, especially after each cut to promote regrowth.
5.  **Weed Management:**
    *   Early weed control is vital as weeds compete for nutrients, water, and light.
    *   **Manual Weeding:** One or two manual weedings within 30 days of sowing are highly effective.
    *   **Chemical Control:** Pre-emergence application of **Atrazine** at 0.5 kg active ingredient per acre (e.g., 1 kg of 50% WP formulation) immediately after sowing can control broadleaf and grassy weeds. Ensure proper soil moisture for efficacy.

### Improving Fruit Quality for Sudan Grass

This is not known to affect Sudan Grass. Sudan Grass is primarily cultivated as a fodder crop for its vegetative biomass (leaves and stems), not for its "fruit" (seeds). The quality metrics for Sudan Grass relate to its nutritional value as animal feed (e.g., crude protein, digestibility, fiber content), not fruit characteristics.

### Improving Storage Life for Sudan Grass (as Fodder)

The "storage life" for Sudan Grass refers to the preservation of its fodder quality for later use, typically through ensiling (silage making) or hay making.

1.  **Silage Making:**
    *   **Harvesting Stage:** Harvest Sudan Grass when it is in the boot stage to early flowering stage (around 50-60 days after sowing for the first cut, subsequent cuts at 40-50 day intervals). At this stage, it has optimal moisture content (65-70%) and nutrient levels for ensiling.
    *   **Chopping:** Chop the harvested fodder into small pieces (1-2 cm) to facilitate compaction and anaerobic fermentation.
    *   **Compaction:** Pack the chopped fodder tightly into a silo (pit, trench, or tower) to remove as much air as possible. Air exclusion is critical for anaerobic fermentation.
    *   **Sealing:** Seal the silo completely with airtight plastic sheets to prevent air and water ingress. Proper sealing ensures anaerobic conditions, which are essential for lactic acid bacteria to ferment sugars into lactic acid, preserving the fodder.
    *   **Additives (Optional):** In some cases, silage additives like bacterial inoculants (lactic acid bacteria) or molasses (as a sugar source) can be used to improve fermentation quality, especially if the crop has low soluble sugars or high buffering capacity.
    *   **Storage:** Properly made silage can be stored for several months to over a year without significant loss of nutritional quality.
2.  **Hay Making:**
    *   **Harvesting Stage:** Harvest Sudan Grass at the pre-flowering stage when it has high leaf-to-stem ratio and nutrient content.
    *   **Drying:** Spread the harvested fodder thinly in the field to dry under the sun. Turn it periodically to ensure uniform drying. The goal is to reduce moisture content to below 15-20% to prevent mold growth and spoilage.
    *   **Curing:** Avoid over-drying, which can lead to leaf shattering and nutrient loss. Once sufficiently dry, rake it into windrows and then bale it.
    *   **Storage:** Store hay bales in a dry, well-ventilated shed, off the ground, to protect them from rain and ground moisture.
    *   **Challenges:** Hay making can be challenging in humid climates or during monsoon season due to difficulty in rapid drying.

By implementing these practices, farmers in Haryana can significantly enhance the productivity and usability of Sudan Grass as a valuable fodder crop.
