As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in Sudan Grass in Haryana:

Effective pest management in Sudan Grass (Sorghum × drummondii) is crucial for ensuring good fodder yield and quality. Always prioritize Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategies, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods.

### 1. Borers (e.g., Spotted Stem Borer - *Chilo partellus*)

**Symptoms:**
*   Initial damage appears as pinholes or shot-holes on young leaves.
*   Later, the central shoot dries up, leading to a characteristic "dead heart" symptom.
*   Boreholes and frass (excreta) may be visible on the stems.

**Control Measures:**
*   **Cultural:**
    *   Practice early sowing to avoid peak pest incidence.
    *   Remove and destroy crop stubble after harvest to eliminate overwintering larvae.
    *   Monitor fields regularly, especially during the early growth stages (10-30 days after emergence).
*   **Chemical (for severe infestations, especially at early growth stages):**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** Apply 60 ml per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water and sprayed, ensuring good coverage of the plant whorl.
    *   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG:** Apply 80-100 g per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water and sprayed, targeting the plant whorl.
    *   *Note:* For fodder crops, strictly adhere to the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) mentioned on the pesticide label to ensure fodder safety.

### 2. Caterpillars (General defoliators, e.g., Fall Armyworm - *Spodoptera frugiperda*, Armyworms)

**Symptoms:**
*   Irregular holes or ragged feeding on leaves.
*   Presence of larvae (caterpillars) in the leaf whorls or on the underside of leaves.
*   Heavy feeding can lead to skeletonized leaves or complete defoliation in severe cases.

**Control Measures:**
*   **Cultural:**
    *   Regular scouting of fields to detect infestations early.
    *   Hand-picking and destruction of larvae in small, localized infestations.
    *   Encourage natural enemies like parasitic wasps, predatory birds, and ground beetles.
*   **Chemical (for moderate to severe infestations):**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** Apply 60 ml per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water and sprayed.
    *   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG:** Apply 80-100 g per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water and sprayed.
    *   **Flubendiamide 20% WG:** Apply 50 g per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water and sprayed.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** Apply 200 ml per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water and sprayed (use with caution, observe PHI).
    *   *Note:* Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially into the leaf whorls where caterpillars often hide.

### 3. Diamondback Moth (*Plutella xylostella*)

*   This is not known to affect Sudan Grass. Diamondback moth is a specific pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower, mustard, radish).

### 4. Leaf folder (e.g., *Cnaphalocrocis medinalis* or similar species)

**Symptoms:**
*   Leaves are folded longitudinally and tied together with silken threads.
*   Larvae feed from within the folded leaves, scraping the green matter and leaving white streaks.
*   In severe cases, multiple leaves may be folded together.

**Control Measures:**
*   **Cultural:**
    *   Maintain field sanitation by removing weeds and alternate host plants.
    *   Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can promote lush vegetative growth favorable for leaf folders.
*   **Chemical (for severe infestations):**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** Apply 60 ml per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water and sprayed.
    *   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG:** Apply 80-100 g per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water and sprayed.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** Apply 200 ml per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water and sprayed.

**Important Considerations for Fodder Crops:**
*   Always read and strictly follow the instructions, dosage, and Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) mentioned on the pesticide label.
*   Ensure that the chosen chemical is approved for use on fodder crops and adheres to residue limits.
*   For the most current and specific recommendations for Sudan Grass in Haryana, always refer to the latest "Package of Practices for Kharif Crops" published by Haryana Agricultural University (HAU).
