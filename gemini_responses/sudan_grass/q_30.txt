As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide scientifically verified advice for managing growth issues in Sudan Grass (Sorghum × drummondii) in Haryana. It is crucial to first identify the underlying cause of the growth issue, as symptoms can often overlap.

Here's how to manage the described growth issues:

### 1. Slow Growth

Slow growth in Sudan Grass can be indicative of several underlying problems, including nutrient deficiencies, water stress, soil issues, or pest/disease pressure.

**Potential Causes:**
*   **Nutrient Deficiency:** Lack of essential macro (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium) or micronutrients (Zinc, Iron, Sulphur).
*   **Water Stress:** Insufficient or excessive irrigation.
*   **Soil Compaction/Poor Aeration:** Restricts root development.
*   **Soil pH Imbalance:** Affects nutrient availability.
*   **Pest Infestation:** Early-stage pests like shoot fly or stem borers can severely stunt growth.
*   **Disease Infection:** Fungal or bacterial diseases can weaken the plant.
*   **Weed Competition:** Weeds compete for water, nutrients, and sunlight.
*   **Poor Seed Quality/Sowing Depth:** Leads to weak germination and establishment.
*   **Low Temperatures:** Sudan Grass is a warm-season crop; cool temperatures can slow growth.

**Management Strategies:**

*   **Soil Testing:** This is the most critical first step. A comprehensive soil test will identify nutrient deficiencies and pH imbalances.
*   **Nutrient Management (Based on Soil Test):**
    *   **Nitrogen (N):** Apply **Urea** (46% N) at 40-50 kg/acre in two splits (half at sowing, half after first cut).
    *   **Phosphorus (P):** Apply **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5) at 25-30 kg/acre or **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5) at 60-75 kg/acre at the time of sowing.
    *   **Potassium (K):** Apply **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** (60% K2O) at 10-15 kg/acre at sowing, especially on light soils or if soil test indicates deficiency.
    *   **Zinc (Zn):** If deficient, apply **Zinc sulphate** (21% Zn) at 8-10 kg/acre as basal application or 0.5% foliar spray (5 g/L water) at 20-30 days after sowing.
    *   **Iron (Fe):** If deficient (often in high pH soils), apply **Ferrous sulphate** (19% Fe) at 0.5% foliar spray (5 g/L water).
*   **Water Management:** Ensure timely and adequate irrigation, especially during dry spells. Avoid waterlogging by ensuring proper drainage.
*   **Pest Management:**
    *   For shoot fly (Atherigona soccata), which causes "dead heart" and stunted growth:
        *   Seed treatment with **Thiamethoxam** 70 WS at 3 g/kg seed.
        *   If infestation occurs, apply **Carbofuran** 3G at 5 kg/acre in the whorl of plants at 10-15 days after emergence.
*   **Weed Control:** Implement timely weeding (manual or mechanical) to reduce competition.
*   **Agronomic Practices:** Ensure proper seedbed preparation, optimal seed rate (15-20 kg/acre), and correct sowing depth (2-3 cm).

### 2. Yellow Growth (Chlorosis)

Yellowing of leaves (chlorosis) is a common symptom of nutrient deficiencies, water stress, or sometimes disease.

**Potential Causes:**
*   **Nitrogen Deficiency:** General yellowing, starting from older leaves.
*   **Iron Deficiency:** Interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins), primarily on younger leaves, common in high pH (alkaline) soils.
*   **Zinc Deficiency:** Stunted growth with interveinal chlorosis, often on middle leaves.
*   **Sulphur Deficiency:** General yellowing, often starting on younger leaves.
*   **Waterlogging:** Causes root damage and nutrient uptake issues.
*   **Herbicide Injury:** Residual effects from previous crops or drift.
*   **Viral Diseases:** Can cause mosaic patterns and yellowing.

**Management Strategies:**

*   **Soil Testing:** Essential to pinpoint specific nutrient deficiencies and soil pH.
*   **Nutrient Management (Based on Soil Test):**
    *   **Nitrogen:** Apply **Urea** as a top-dressing (refer to slow growth section).
    *   **Iron:** For iron chlorosis, especially in high pH soils, foliar spray of **Ferrous sulphate** (19% Fe) at 0.5% (5 g/L water) with 0.1% citric acid (1 g/L water) or a suitable wetting agent. Repeat after 7-10 days if needed.
    *   **Zinc:** For zinc deficiency, foliar spray of **Zinc sulphate** (21% Zn) at 0.5% (5 g/L water).
    *   **Sulphur:** Apply **Elemental sulphur** at 10-15 kg/acre or **Gypsum** (if calcium is also needed) at 100-200 kg/acre at sowing.
*   **Drainage:** Improve field drainage to prevent waterlogging.
*   **Disease/Pest Identification:** If yellowing is accompanied by other symptoms (spots, wilting), identify the specific disease or pest and apply appropriate CIBRC-approved fungicides or insecticides. For example, for downy mildew, which can cause yellowing and white growth on leaves, **Metalaxyl** based fungicides can be used as seed treatment or foliar spray.

### 3. Excessive Height

Sudan Grass is naturally a tall-growing forage crop. "Excessive height" is usually a concern if it leads to lodging (falling over) or makes harvesting difficult, or if it indicates a decline in forage quality.

**Potential Causes:**
*   **High Nitrogen Application:** Over-fertilization with nitrogen can promote lush, tall growth.
*   **Dense Planting:** Can lead to etiolation (stretching for light).
*   **Variety Characteristics:** Some varieties are inherently taller.
*   **Delayed Harvesting:** Allowing the crop to grow beyond its optimal forage stage.

**Management Strategies:**

*   **Harvesting Management:** This is the primary method to manage height. Harvest Sudan Grass when it reaches 1.0-1.5 meters in height or at the boot stage (just before flowering) for optimal forage quality and to encourage regrowth. Multiple cuts are typical.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Optimize nitrogen application based on soil test recommendations and desired forage quality, rather than solely aiming for maximum height. Avoid excessive nitrogen.
*   **Variety Selection:** If lodging is a consistent problem, consider varieties known for better standability or shorter stature, if available and suitable for forage.
*   **Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs):** This is not known to be a recommended or economically viable practice for managing height in Sudan Grass for forage production in Haryana. Timely harvesting is the most effective and practical approach.

### 4. Excessive Flowering

Excessive flowering in Sudan Grass indicates that the crop has matured beyond its optimal stage for high-quality forage. Forage quality (digestibility, protein content) declines significantly once the plant starts flowering and setting seeds.

**Potential Causes:**
*   **Delayed Harvesting:** The most common reason; the crop was allowed to mature too much.
*   **Stress Conditions:** Drought or severe nutrient deficiency can sometimes induce premature flowering as a survival mechanism.
*   **Variety Characteristics:** Some varieties may flower earlier than others.

**Management Strategies:**

*   **Timely Harvesting:** This is the most crucial management strategy. Harvest Sudan Grass at the boot stage (when the seed head is enclosed in the flag leaf sheath) or when the crop is 1.0-1.5 meters tall, before significant flowering occurs. This ensures maximum nutritional value and palatability for livestock and promotes vigorous regrowth for subsequent cuts.
*   **Water and Nutrient Management:** Ensure the crop receives adequate water and balanced nutrients throughout its growth cycle to prevent stress-induced premature flowering.
