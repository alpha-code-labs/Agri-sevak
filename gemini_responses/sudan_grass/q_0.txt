As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Sudan Grass in Haryana. Effective management relies on an integrated approach combining cultural practices, resistant varieties, and judicious use of fungicides. Always monitor your fields regularly for early detection.

Here's how to control the specified fungal diseases:

### General Integrated Disease Management (IDM) Principles for Sudan Grass:
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available, choose Sudan Grass varieties known for resistance or tolerance to common fungal diseases.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate Sudan Grass with non-host crops (e.g., legumes) to break disease cycles and reduce inoculum in the soil.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest to reduce overwintering fungal spores.
*   **Optimal Plant Spacing:** Ensure proper plant spacing to improve air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce humidity and fungal growth.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced fertilization, avoiding excessive nitrogen, which can make plants more susceptible to certain fungal diseases.
*   **Weed Control:** Manage weeds, as they can act as alternate hosts for some pathogens.
*   **Disease-Free Seed:** Use certified, disease-free seeds.

### Specific Disease Control Measures:

#### Alternaria Leaf Spot
*   **Cultural Practices:** Use disease-free seeds, practice crop rotation, and remove crop debris.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Foliar spray with **Mancozeb** at 2.0-2.5 kg/acre in 500-750 L of water, or
    *   **Propiconazole** at 250-300 ml/acre in 200-400 L of water, or
    *   **Azoxystrobin** at 200 ml/acre in 200-400 L of water, upon disease appearance.

#### Anthracnose
*   **Cultural Practices:** Use resistant varieties if available, practice crop rotation, ensure proper plant spacing for good air circulation, and manage nitrogen levels appropriately.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Seed treatment with **Carbendazim** at 2 g/kg seed.
    *   Foliar spray with **Carbendazim** at 250-500 g/acre in 500-750 L of water, or
    *   **Propiconazole** at 250-300 ml/acre in 200-400 L of water, or
    *   **Azoxystrobin** at 200 ml/acre in 200-400 L of water, upon disease appearance.

#### Blast
*   This is not known to affect Sudan Grass as a major, yield-limiting disease. While *Pyricularia* species can cause minor leaf spots on various grasses, "Blast" in the context of a severe disease is not characteristic of Sudan Grass.

#### Blight (e.g., Southern Corn Leaf Blight, Northern Corn Leaf Blight)
*   **Cultural Practices:** Use resistant/tolerant varieties, practice crop rotation, remove infected plant debris, and maintain optimal plant density.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Foliar spray with **Mancozeb** at 2.0-2.5 kg/acre in 500-750 L of water, or
    *   **Chlorothalonil** at 1.0-1.5 kg/acre in 500-750 L of water, or
    *   **Propiconazole** at 250-300 ml/acre in 200-400 L of water, or
    *   **Azoxystrobin** at 200 ml/acre in 200-400 L of water, upon disease appearance.

#### Brown Spot
*   **Cultural Practices:** Use disease-free seeds, practice crop rotation, and ensure balanced nutrition, especially potassium.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Seed treatment with **Carbendazim** at 2 g/kg seed.
    *   Foliar spray with **Mancozeb** at 2.0-2.5 kg/acre in 500-750 L of water, or
    *   **Propiconazole** at 250-300 ml/acre in 200-400 L of water, or
    *   **Tebuconazole** at 250-300 ml/acre in 200-400 L of water, upon disease appearance.

#### Downy Mildew
*   **Cultural Practices:** Use resistant varieties, practice crop rotation, rogue out infected plants early, and ensure good field sanitation.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Seed treatment with **Metalaxyl** at 6 g/kg seed (often as a combination product like Metalaxyl-M).
    *   Foliar spray with **Metalaxyl + Mancozeb** (pre-mix) at 1.0 kg/acre in 500-750 L of water, or
    *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride** at 1.5-2.0 L/acre in 500-750 L of water, upon disease appearance.

#### Powdery Mildew
*   **Cultural Practices:** Use resistant varieties, ensure good air circulation through proper spacing, and avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Foliar spray with **Sulphur** (wettable powder) at 2.0-2.5 kg/acre in 500-750 L of water, or
    *   **Propiconazole** at 250-300 ml/acre in 200-400 L of water, or
    *   **Tebuconazole** at 250-300 ml/acre in 200-400 L of water, upon disease appearance.

#### Grey Mildew
*   This is not a commonly recognized specific fungal disease of Sudan Grass. If you are observing symptoms that resemble a greyish fungal growth, it might be a form of leaf spot or another mildew. Please consult with your local agricultural extension specialist for accurate diagnosis.

### Important Considerations:
*   Always read and strictly follow the label instructions for any pesticide product regarding dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest intervals.
*   The efficacy of chemical control depends on timely application, proper dosage, and environmental conditions.
*   For precise diagnosis and tailored recommendations specific to your field conditions, it is always advisable to consult with your local agricultural extension officer or the plant pathology department at HAU, Hisar, especially if symptoms are unusual or severe.
