As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Sudan Grass in Haryana:

### Control of Grasshopper in Sudan Grass

Grasshoppers are polyphagous pests that can cause significant defoliation in Sudan Grass, especially during the nymphal and adult stages. An integrated approach is recommended for effective management.

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Deep Summer Ploughing:** Ploughing fields deeply during summer exposes grasshopper egg pods to predators and the harsh sun, reducing their population.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Keep field bunds and surrounding areas free of weeds, which can serve as alternate hosts and breeding sites for grasshoppers.

**2. Mechanical Control:**
*   **Hand Picking:** In areas with low to moderate infestations, especially during the early nymphal stages, hand picking and destroying the nymphs and adults can be effective.

**3. Chemical Control (if infestation is severe and economic threshold is crossed):**
*   When grasshopper populations are high and causing significant damage, chemical intervention may be necessary. Ensure proper coverage of the foliage.
    *   **Malathion** 50% EC: Apply 1.0 - 1.25 litres per acre mixed in 200-250 litres of water.
    *   **Quinalphos** 25% EC: Apply 500 ml per acre mixed in 200-250 litres of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: Apply 200-250 ml per acre mixed in 200-250 litres of water.

### Control of Other Pests

*   **Painted bug (Bagrada hilaris):** This is not known to affect Sudan Grass.
*   **Red cotton bug (Dysdercus spp.):** This is not known to affect Sudan Grass.
*   **Black ants:** This is not known to affect Sudan Grass as a direct pest causing significant damage.
