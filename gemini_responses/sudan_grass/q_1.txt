Namaste, Kisan bhaiyon! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I will provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling smut diseases in Sudan Grass.

Sudan Grass (Sorghum × drummondii) is susceptible to several smut diseases, which can significantly impact yield and fodder quality. It's important to correctly identify and manage them.

Let's address the specific smuts you mentioned:

1.  **False Smut:** This is not known to affect Sudan Grass. False smut is primarily a disease of rice.

2.  **Black Smut:** This is a general descriptive term often used for smuts due to the dark, sooty appearance of the spore masses. For Sudan Grass, the specific smut diseases that produce such symptoms and are of concern are Kernel Smut, Loose Smut, and Head Smut.

3.  **Kernel Smut (Covered Smut):** Caused by *Sporisorium sorghi*. This disease affects individual grains, turning them into a conical or oval smut sorus covered by a whitish membrane. The membrane eventually ruptures, releasing black spore masses.

4.  **Loose Smut:** Caused by *Sporisorium cruentum*. This smut affects individual florets, converting them into elongated, dark, powdery sori. The spores are quickly dispersed, leaving behind a bare rachis.

5.  **Head Smut:** Caused by *Sporisorium reilianum*. This is a more destructive smut where the entire head (panicle) is converted into a large, black, powdery mass of spores, often enclosed by a whitish membrane that soon ruptures.

**Control Measures for Smut Diseases (Kernel, Loose, and Head Smut) in Sudan Grass:**

Effective management of smut diseases relies on an integrated approach combining cultural practices and chemical control.

**I. Cultural Practices:**

*   **Resistant Varieties:** The most economical and effective method is to use smut-resistant or tolerant varieties of Sudan Grass. Consult with HAU or your local agricultural extension office for recommended varieties suitable for Haryana.
*   **Certified Seed:** Always use certified, disease-free seed from a reputable source.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops (e.g., legumes, wheat) for at least 2-3 years to reduce the build-up of soil-borne inoculum, especially for Head Smut.
*   **Field Sanitation:**
    *   Rogue out and destroy infected plants, especially those showing Head Smut symptoms, before the spores are dispersed. Carefully remove them in a bag to prevent spore spread.
    *   Avoid feeding infected fodder to livestock, as spores can pass through the digestive system and be spread through manure.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** Deep summer ploughing can help expose soil-borne spores to sunlight and heat, reducing their viability.

**II. Chemical Control (Seed Treatment):**

Seed treatment is highly effective for controlling seed-borne smuts (Kernel and Loose Smut) and can also help reduce the incidence of Head Smut.

*   **For Kernel Smut and Loose Smut:**
    *   Treat the seeds before sowing with a systemic fungicide.
    *   Recommended fungicides and dosages:
        *   **Carboxin 37.5% FS:** 2-3 g per kg of seed.
        *   **Thiram 75% WS:** 2-3 g per kg of seed.
        *   **Tebuconazole 2% DS:** 1-1.25 g per kg of seed.
        *   **Tebuconazole 60 FS:** 1.25 ml per kg of seed.

*   **For Head Smut:**
    *   While seed treatment helps, Head Smut is primarily soil-borne. Therefore, cultural practices like crop rotation and resistant varieties are crucial.
    *   Seed treatment with systemic fungicides like **Carboxin** or **Tebuconazole** can offer some protection against early infection from soil-borne inoculum.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the fungicide label carefully regarding dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (gloves, mask) during seed treatment.
*   Ensure uniform coating of the fungicide on the seeds for best results.

By implementing these integrated control measures, you can effectively manage smut diseases in your Sudan Grass crop and ensure good yield and quality. For any further specific queries, please contact your nearest Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or HAU extension specialist.
