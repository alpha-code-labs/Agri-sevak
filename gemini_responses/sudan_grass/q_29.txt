This is not known to affect Sudan Grass.

Sudan Grass (Sorghum × drummondii) is primarily cultivated as a forage crop for its vegetative biomass (leaves and stems). The terms "flower drop," "fruit drop," "tinda dropping," or "boll dropping" are typically associated with fruit-bearing or fiber crops (like cotton for bolls, or various vegetables for flowers/fruits) where the reproductive structures or developing fruits are the economic yield. These phenomena are not relevant issues for Sudan Grass production, as its economic value lies in its fodder yield, not in its reproductive structures in the context of "dropping."
