As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice on irrigation management for Sudan Grass in Haryana:

Sudan Grass (Sorghum sudanense) is a fast-growing, high-yielding fodder crop that requires adequate moisture for optimal growth and multiple cuts. Effective irrigation management is crucial for maximizing its productivity in Haryana's climatic conditions.

### Irrigation Management for Sudan Grass

**1. First Irrigation:**
The timing of the first irrigation is critical for seedling establishment and early vigor.

*   **If sown after pre-sowing irrigation (Palewa):** The first irrigation can generally be delayed until about 20-25 days after sowing, or when the crop reaches the 4-5 leaf stage. This allows the roots to penetrate deeper in search of moisture.
*   **If sown in dry soil (without pre-sowing irrigation):** A light irrigation should be given immediately after sowing to ensure proper germination and establishment. Subsequent irrigation would then follow the schedule for crops sown after palewa.
*   **General Guideline:** The first irrigation is typically applied around 20-25 days after sowing, or when signs of moisture stress (e.g., leaf rolling, wilting in the afternoon) are observed, especially in lighter soils.

**2. Subsequent Irrigations (Second Irrigation and Beyond):**
Sudan Grass is a multi-cut crop, and timely irrigation is essential for good regrowth and sustained fodder yield.

*   **Frequency:** Subsequent irrigations should be applied every 15-20 days during the active growth period, especially in hot and dry weather conditions prevalent in Haryana. This frequency may vary depending on soil type (lighter soils require more frequent irrigation), rainfall, and temperature.
*   **Critical Stages:**
    *   **Tillering/Branching Stage:** Adequate moisture during this stage promotes vigorous growth and higher biomass.
    *   **After Each Cut:** An irrigation immediately after each fodder cut is vital to encourage rapid and healthy regrowth for subsequent harvests.
*   **Monitoring:** Always observe the crop for signs of water stress. Leaves turning bluish-green or rolling during the day are indicators that irrigation is needed.

**3. Sprinkler Use:**
Sprinkler irrigation is highly recommended for Sudan Grass cultivation in Haryana due to its numerous advantages, particularly in water-scarce regions and sandy soils.

*   **Water Use Efficiency:** Sprinklers apply water uniformly and precisely, significantly reducing water losses due to deep percolation and surface runoff, leading to higher water use efficiency compared to flood irrigation. This is crucial for water conservation in Haryana.
*   **Suitability for Soil Types:** It is particularly beneficial for light-textured (sandy) soils where flood irrigation can lead to high percolation losses and uneven water distribution.
*   **Uniform Application:** Ensures even distribution of water across the field, leading to uniform crop growth and yield.
*   **Fertigation Potential:** Sprinkler systems can be effectively used for fertigation, allowing for precise application of water-soluble fertilizers directly to the root zone, improving nutrient use efficiency.
*   **Application Rate:** Adjust the sprinkler application rate to match the infiltration rate of the soil to avoid runoff. For Sudan Grass, a typical application depth of 40-60 mm per irrigation is often sufficient, depending on soil type and weather.
*   **Energy Efficiency:** Modern low-pressure sprinkler systems can also reduce energy consumption.

**General Recommendation:**
Aim to maintain adequate soil moisture throughout the growing season, especially during critical growth stages and after each cut. While Sudan Grass is relatively drought-tolerant once established, consistent moisture supply ensures maximum fodder production and quality.
