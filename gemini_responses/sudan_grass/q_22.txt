As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), here are the recommended cultivation practices for Sudan Grass in Haryana:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   Sudan Grass can be sown either by broadcasting or in rows.
    *   For optimal fodder yield and ease of intercultivation (weeding), sowing in rows is generally preferred.
    *   If broadcasting, ensure uniform distribution of seeds.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   Seeds should be sown at a shallow depth of 2-3 cm. Deeper sowing can hinder germination and emergence.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   When sown in rows, maintain a row-to-row spacing of 25-30 cm.
    *   Plant-to-plant spacing within the row is generally not maintained for fodder crops as a dense stand is desired.

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   For fodder production, a seed dose of 20-25 kg/acre is recommended to achieve a dense and productive stand.
