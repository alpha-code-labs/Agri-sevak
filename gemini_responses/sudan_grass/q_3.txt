As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling various rot types in Sudan Grass (Sorghum × drummondii) in Haryana.

Firstly, regarding the specific rot types mentioned:
*   **Fruit Rot:** This is not known to affect Sudan Grass, as it is primarily grown for forage and grain, not fleshy fruits.

For the other rot types, including Root Rot, Stem Rot, Foot Rot, Collar Rot, Crown Rot, Neck Rot, Black Rot (often associated with Charcoal Rot), Seed Rot, and Seedling Rot, they are primarily caused by a complex of soil-borne fungal pathogens and, in some cases, bacteria. These pathogens often thrive under conditions of high moisture, poor drainage, and plant stress. Common fungal pathogens include *Fusarium spp.*, *Pythium spp.*, *Rhizoctonia solani*, and *Macrophomina phaseolina* (causing charcoal rot, which leads to blackening of the stem and roots). Bacterial stalk rots can also occur.

Effective control requires an integrated approach combining cultural practices and judicious chemical application.

### Integrated Management Strategies for Rot Diseases in Sudan Grass:

**I. Cultural and Agronomic Practices (Prevention and Management):**

1.  **Crop Rotation:**
    *   Avoid continuous cultivation of Sudan Grass or other susceptible crops (like maize, sorghum, pearl millet) in the same field. Rotate with non-host crops such as legumes (e.g., cluster bean, cowpea) or wheat for at least 2-3 years to reduce pathogen inoculum in the soil.
2.  **Resistant Varieties:**
    *   Where available, select Sudan Grass varieties known to have tolerance or resistance to common root and stalk rot pathogens. Consult with HAU extension services for recommended varieties suitable for Haryana.
3.  **Soil Health and Drainage:**
    *   Improve soil structure and drainage by incorporating organic matter (e.g., farmyard manure, compost). Well-drained soils reduce conditions favorable for many rot pathogens, especially *Pythium spp.*
    *   Avoid waterlogging in the field.
4.  **Balanced Nutrition:**
    *   Provide balanced fertilization based on soil test recommendations. Excessive nitrogen can sometimes make plants more susceptible to stalk rots, while potassium deficiency can also increase susceptibility.
5.  **Timely Sowing:**
    *   Sow seeds at the recommended time for your region in Haryana. Early or late sowing can expose seedlings to unfavorable environmental conditions, increasing stress and susceptibility to seedling rots.
6.  **Optimum Plant Density:**
    *   Maintain recommended plant spacing to ensure adequate air circulation and reduce competition, which can stress plants and make them more vulnerable.
7.  **Weed Management:**
    *   Control weeds effectively as they compete for nutrients and moisture, stressing the crop and potentially harboring pathogens.
8.  **Sanitation:**
    *   Remove and destroy infected plant debris from the field after harvest. This reduces the primary inoculum source for subsequent crops.
9.  **Water Management:**
    *   Practice judicious irrigation. Avoid over-irrigation, especially during critical growth stages, as excessive soil moisture favors many rot pathogens. Use furrow irrigation where possible to avoid wetting the plant base.

**II. Chemical Control (Targeted Application):**

**A. Seed Treatment (Most Critical for Seed, Seedling, Root, and Collar Rots):**
Seed treatment is the most effective and economical method to protect seeds and young seedlings from soil-borne pathogens causing seed rot, seedling rot, damping-off, and early root/collar rots.

*   **For broad-spectrum fungal protection:**
    *   Treat seeds with a combination fungicide containing **Carbendazim 12% + Mancozeb 63% WP** at a rate of **2.0-2.5 g/kg seed**. This combination provides systemic and contact action against a wide range of fungi, including *Fusarium* and *Rhizoctonia*.
*   **For specific protection against Oomycetes (e.g., *Pythium* spp. causing damping-off):**
    *   Treat seeds with **Metalaxyl 35% WS** at a rate of **1.0-2.0 g/kg seed**. This can be used alone or in combination with other fungicides for broader spectrum control.
*   **Other effective options for seed treatment:**
    *   **Thiram 75% WS** at **2.5-3.0 g/kg seed**.
    *   **Captan 75% WS** at **2.5-3.0 g/kg seed**.
    *   **Tebuconazole 2% DS** at **1.0-1.5 g/kg seed**.

**B. Soil Drench/Foliar Application (Less common for widespread rot in forage, but for specific severe cases):**
For established plants showing symptoms of root, stem, or crown rot, soil drenching with fungicides might be considered, though it is often less practical and economical for a forage crop like Sudan Grass.

*   In severe localized outbreaks of root/collar rot, a soil drench with **Carbendazim 50% WP** at **1.0-2.0 g/L of water** around the base of affected plants might be considered.
*   For bacterial stalk rots, chemical control is generally not effective. Focus on cultural practices and resistant varieties.

Always ensure to follow the specific instructions and safety precautions provided on the fungicide product label. Consult with your local HAU extension specialist for the most current and specific recommendations for your farm conditions in Haryana.
