As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling soil pests like termites and root-knot nematodes in Sudan Grass, which are indeed known to affect this crop in our region. An integrated approach combining cultural practices with judicious use of CIBRC-approved chemicals is recommended.

### Control of Termites in Sudan Grass

Termites can cause significant damage by feeding on roots and the base of the stem, leading to wilting and plant death, especially in dry conditions.

**1. Cultural Control Measures:**

*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove all stubble, crop residues, and woody debris from the field before sowing, as these can serve as food sources and breeding sites for termites.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** Ploughing the field deeply during summer exposes termite colonies to the sun and predators, disrupting their nests.
*   **Adequate Irrigation:** Maintain proper soil moisture, as termites thrive in dry conditions. Regular irrigation can reduce their activity.
*   **Organic Manures:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost. Undecomposed organic matter can attract termites.

**2. Chemical Control Measures (Pre-sowing/At Sowing):**

For effective control, soil application of insecticides is crucial.

*   **Soil Treatment:**
    *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC:** Apply 2.0-2.5 litres per acre mixed with 200-400 litres of water and drench the soil, or mix with 20-25 kg of sand and broadcast evenly before the last ploughing, followed by light incorporation.
    *   **Fipronil 0.3% GR:** Apply 6.6-10 kg per acre by broadcasting evenly over the soil surface before sowing and incorporate into the soil.

### Control of Nematodes (Root-knot) in Sudan Grass

Root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.) are a major concern, causing galls on roots, leading to stunted growth, nutrient deficiency symptoms, and reduced yield.

**1. Cultural Control Measures:**

*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate Sudan Grass with non-host crops like marigold (Tagetes spp.), mustard, or specific varieties of cereals that are poor hosts for root-knot nematodes. Avoid continuous cultivation of susceptible crops.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** If available and suitable for your region, choose Sudan Grass varieties known to have resistance or tolerance to root-knot nematodes.
*   **Summer Solarization:** During hot summer months, cover moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks. The heat generated can kill nematodes in the upper soil layers.
*   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporate neem cake at 100-200 kg per acre or well-decomposed FYM/compost. Neem cake has nematicidal properties and improves soil health, enhancing plant tolerance.
*   **Timely Sowing:** Ensure timely sowing to allow plants to establish well before nematode populations build up significantly.

**2. Chemical Control Measures (At Sowing):**

Chemical nematicides can be used as a prophylactic measure or when nematode populations are high.

*   **Granular Application:**
    *   **Carbofuran 3% G:** Apply 10-13 kg per acre in furrows at the time of sowing, ensuring proper mixing with the soil.
    *   **Phorate 10% G:** Apply 4 kg per acre in furrows at the time of sowing, ensuring proper mixing with the soil.
    *   **Fipronil 0.3% GR:** (As mentioned for termites, it also offers some control against nematodes) Apply 6.6-10 kg per acre by broadcasting evenly over the soil surface before sowing and incorporate into the soil.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the pesticide label regarding dosage, application method, safety precautions, and waiting periods.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and pest severity.
*   Regular monitoring of your field for pest incidence is crucial for timely intervention.
