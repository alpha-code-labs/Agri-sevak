As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for Sudan Grass cultivation in Haryana:

*   **Dieback:** This is not known to affect Sudan Grass as a specific disease. While general plant stress can lead to symptoms resembling dieback, it is not a recognized primary disease of this crop.
*   **Twig blight:** This is not known to affect Sudan Grass. Sudan Grass is an annual forage grass and does not produce woody twigs.
*   **Tikka disease:** This is not known to affect Sudan Grass. Tikka disease is a significant foliar disease primarily affecting groundnut (peanut).
