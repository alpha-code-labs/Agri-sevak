As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the suitable climate, soil type, and drainage requirements for Sudan Grass (Sorghum × drummondii) in Haryana:

**Climate:**
*   **Temperature:** Sudan Grass is a warm-season annual crop. It thrives in warm temperatures, with an optimal growth range typically between 25°C to 35°C. It is sensitive to frost and requires frost-free conditions for establishment and growth.
*   **Rainfall:** It is relatively drought-tolerant once established but performs best with adequate moisture. An annual rainfall of 400-800 mm distributed during the growing season is ideal. It can be successfully grown under rainfed conditions in regions of Haryana receiving sufficient monsoon rains, or with supplemental irrigation.
*   **Sunlight:** Requires full sun exposure for optimal growth and forage production.

**Soil Type:**
*   **Texture:** Sudan Grass is adaptable to a wide range of soil types but performs best on well-drained, fertile loamy to sandy-loam soils. It can also tolerate heavier clay soils provided they have good drainage.
*   **pH:** It prefers a soil pH range of 6.0 to 7.5, which is slightly acidic to neutral. However, it shows reasonable tolerance to slightly alkaline conditions, which are common in parts of Haryana.
*   **Fertility:** Responds well to soils with good organic matter content and adequate levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.

**Drainage Requirement:**
*   **Drainage:** Good drainage is crucial for Sudan Grass. It does not tolerate waterlogging or prolonged periods of standing water, which can lead to root rot and poor growth.
*   **Aeration:** Well-aerated soils are essential for healthy root development and nutrient uptake. Compacted soils with poor drainage should be avoided or improved through appropriate tillage practices.
