As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following fertilizer doses for Sudan Grass (multi-cut varieties) in Haryana. Please note that these are general recommendations, and a soil test is highly advised to determine the precise nutrient requirements for your specific field conditions.

**General Nutrient Requirement for Sudan Grass (Multi-cut) in Haryana:**
*   **Nitrogen (N):** 100-120 kg per acre
*   **Phosphorus (P2O5):** 40-60 kg per acre
*   **Potassium (K2O):** 30-40 kg per acre
*   **Sulphur (S):** 20 kg per acre (if not supplied by **Single Super Phosphate**)

**Recommended Fertilizer Doses:**

**1. Basal Application (at the time of sowing):**

*   **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP):** 110-120 kg per acre.
    *   *(This provides approximately 20-22 kg Nitrogen and 50-55 kg Phosphorus (P2O5) per acre).*
*   **Muriate of Potash (Potash):** 40-50 kg per acre.
    *   *(This provides approximately 24-30 kg Potassium (K2O) per acre).*
*   **Bentonite Sulphur (90%):** 20-25 kg per acre.
    *   *(This provides approximately 18-22.5 kg Sulphur per acre. If **Single Super Phosphate** is used, separate Sulphur application may not be needed).*
*   **Urea:** 40-50 kg per acre.
    *   *(This provides approximately 18-23 kg Nitrogen per acre).*

**2. Top-dressing Application (after each cut):**

*   **Urea:** 60-70 kg per acre after each cut.
    *   *(Apply after the first cut and subsequent cuts, typically 2-3 cuts are taken. This provides approximately 28-32 kg Nitrogen per acre per cut).*

**3. Alternative for Phosphorus and Sulphur (Basal):**

*   **Single Super Phosphate (SSP):** 300-350 kg per acre.
    *   *(This can be used as an alternative to **Di-ammonium Phosphate** for Phosphorus. It provides approximately 48-56 kg Phosphorus (P2O5) and 33-38 kg Sulphur per acre. If using **Single Super Phosphate**, reduce **Urea** in basal application to 80-90 kg per acre to compensate for no N from SSP, and separate **Bentonite Sulphur** may not be required).*

**4. Alternative for NPK (Basal):**

*   **NPK (Complex Fertilizers, e.g., 12:32:16 or 10:26:26):** 150-200 kg per acre.
    *   *(This can be used as a basal application to provide N, P, and K. Adjust **Urea** and **Muriate of Potash** doses accordingly based on the NPK grade used. For example, 150 kg of 12:32:16 provides 18 kg N, 48 kg P2O5, and 24 kg K2O).*

**5. Foliar Application (Supplemental):**

*   **Nano-Urea (Liquid, 4% N):** 500 ml per acre.
    *   *(Dilute in 100-150 litres of water and spray. Apply 2-3 sprays during the crop cycle: first at tillering/early vegetative stage, and subsequent sprays after each cut for better nutrient utilization and yield. This is a supplement and does not fully replace granular **Urea**).*
*   **Nano-DAP (Liquid, 8% N, 16% P2O5):** 500 ml per acre.
    *   *(Dilute in 100-150 litres of water and spray. Apply 1-2 sprays: first at early vegetative stage, and optionally before flowering/first cut. This is a supplement to granular **Di-ammonium Phosphate**).*
