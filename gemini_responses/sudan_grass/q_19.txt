Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the importance of balanced nutrition for optimal yield and quality of Sudan Grass, a valuable fodder crop in our region. Addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium) is crucial.

The most accurate way to determine nutrient deficiencies and their required quantities is through **soil testing**. I strongly advise getting your soil tested from a certified laboratory (like HAU's soil testing lab or a government-approved facility) before applying any fertilizers. This will provide precise recommendations tailored to your field's specific needs.

However, based on general recommendations for Sudan Grass in Haryana and common deficiency symptoms, here's how to address N, P, and K deficiencies:

---

### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

Nitrogen is vital for vegetative growth, chlorophyll production, and protein synthesis, directly impacting the yield and quality of fodder.

*   **Visual Symptoms:**
    *   General yellowing (chlorosis) of older leaves, starting from the tip and progressing along the midrib.
    *   Stunted growth and thin stems.
    *   Reduced tillering.
    *   Overall pale green appearance of the crop.

*   **Addressing Deficiency (General Recommendation, subject to soil test):**
    *   **Basal Application:** Apply a portion of Nitrogen at the time of sowing.
    *   **Top-dressing:** Split the remaining Nitrogen into 1-2 top-dressings, especially after each cut, to support continuous vigorous growth.
    *   **Recommended Dose (General):** 60-80 kg Nitrogen per acre, applied in splits.

*   **CIBRC Approved Fertilizers:**
    *   **Urea** (46% N): A common and effective source of Nitrogen.
        *   *Application:* For 60 kg N/acre, apply approximately 130 kg **Urea** per acre in splits. For 80 kg N/acre, apply approximately 174 kg **Urea** per acre in splits.
    *   **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5): Provides both Nitrogen and Phosphorus.
        *   *Application:* Can be used as a basal application to meet initial N and P requirements.
    *   **Calcium Ammonium Nitrate (CAN)** (25% N): Another source of Nitrogen, also provides Calcium.
        *   *Application:* Can be used as a top-dressing.

### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

Phosphorus is essential for root development, energy transfer, cell division, and early plant vigor.

*   **Visual Symptoms:**
    *   Stunted growth and poor root development.
    *   Dark green or purplish discoloration, especially on older leaves and stems.
    *   Delayed maturity.
    *   Thin stems.

*   **Addressing Deficiency (General Recommendation, subject to soil test):**
    *   **Basal Application:** Phosphorus is relatively immobile in the soil, so it should be applied entirely as a basal dose at the time of sowing.
    *   **Recommended Dose (General):** 20-30 kg P2O5 per acre.

*   **CIBRC Approved Fertilizers:**
    *   **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5): Excellent for basal application, providing both N and P.
        *   *Application:* For 20 kg P2O5/acre, apply approximately 43.5 kg **DAP** per acre. For 30 kg P2O5/acre, apply approximately 65 kg **DAP** per acre. (Adjust N from DAP when calculating total N requirement).
    *   **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5): A cost-effective source of Phosphorus, also provides Sulfur and Calcium.
        *   *Application:* For 20 kg P2O5/acre, apply approximately 125 kg **SSP** per acre. For 30 kg P2O5/acre, apply approximately 187.5 kg **SSP** per acre.

### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency

Potassium (Potash) plays a crucial role in water regulation, nutrient transport, enzyme activation, disease resistance, and stalk strength.

*   **Visual Symptoms:**
    *   Yellowing and scorching (browning) of leaf margins, typically starting on older leaves.
    *   Weak stems, leading to lodging.
    *   Increased susceptibility to diseases and drought stress.
    *   Poor overall plant vigor.

*   **Addressing Deficiency (General Recommendation, subject to soil test):**
    *   **Basal Application:** Potassium, like Phosphorus, is generally applied as a basal dose at the time of sowing.
    *   **Recommended Dose (General):** 20-30 kg K2O per acre.

*   **CIBRC Approved Fertilizers:**
    *   **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** / **Potassium Chloride** (60% K2O): The most common and economical source of Potassium.
        *   *Application:* For 20 kg K2O/acre, apply approximately 33.3 kg **Muriate of Potash** per acre. For 30 kg K2O/acre, apply approximately 50 kg **Muriate of Potash** per acre.
    *   **Sulphate of Potash (SOP)** / **Potassium Sulphate** (50% K2O): Provides Potassium along with Sulfur, beneficial in sulfur-deficient soils.
        *   *Application:* For 20 kg K2O/acre, apply approximately 40 kg **Sulphate of Potash** per acre. For 30 kg K2O/acre, apply approximately 60 kg **Sulphate of Potash** per acre.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Soil Testing is Paramount:** The doses mentioned above are general. A soil test report will give you precise recommendations for your specific field.
*   **Organic Matter:** Incorporating farmyard manure (FYM) or compost (5-10 tonnes/acre) before sowing can significantly improve soil health, nutrient availability, and water retention, reducing reliance on chemical fertilizers.
*   **Application Method:** Ensure uniform application of fertilizers. Basal doses should be incorporated into the soil before sowing. Top-dressed Nitrogen should be applied when the soil is moist or followed by irrigation.
*   **Water Management:** Adequate and timely irrigation is crucial for nutrient uptake and overall crop health.
