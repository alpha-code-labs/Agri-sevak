As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm the following regarding the conditions you've inquired about for Sudan Grass:

*   **Scab:** This is not known to affect Sudan Grass.
*   **Canker:** This is not known to affect Sudan Grass.
*   **Gummosis:** This is not known to affect Sudan Grass.
*   **Lichen:** This is not known to affect Sudan Grass.

These conditions are typically associated with different types of plants (e.g., woody perennials, fruit trees) or are not recognized as diseases of Sudan Grass (an annual forage grass). Sudan Grass is susceptible to other diseases such as anthracnose, downy mildew, rusts, and various smuts, but not the specific conditions you listed.
