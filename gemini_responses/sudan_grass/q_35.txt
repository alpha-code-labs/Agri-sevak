As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding Sudan Grass for fodder production in Haryana:

### Maturity Signs for Fodder

For Sudan Grass grown as fodder, maturity is assessed based on its vegetative development, not seed maturity. The key signs indicating readiness for harvest are:

*   **Height:** The crop has reached an optimal height, typically between 60-90 cm.
*   **Leafiness:** The plants are lush, green, and have a high proportion of leaves, indicating good palatability and nutritional value.
*   **Pre-flowering Stage:** The plants are in the vegetative stage, ideally before the emergence of the flower head (boot stage). Harvesting at this stage ensures maximum crude protein content and digestibility.

### Harvesting Time

The timing of harvest is crucial for maximizing both yield and fodder quality.

*   **First Cut:** The first cut is generally taken 45-60 days after sowing, or when the crop attains a height of 60-90 cm.
*   **Subsequent Cuts:** Subsequent cuts can be taken every 30-40 days, or when the crop regrows to a height of 60-90 cm.
*   **Optimal Stage:** It is imperative to harvest Sudan Grass before it starts flowering. Harvesting after the flowering stage significantly reduces the crude protein content, increases crude fibre, and lowers the overall digestibility and palatability of the fodder.

### Cutting Process

The cutting process directly impacts the regrowth potential and subsequent yields.

*   **Stubble Height:** For optimal regrowth and sustained productivity, cut the Sudan Grass at a stubble height of 10-15 cm from the ground. Cutting too low can damage the crown of the plant, hindering regrowth, while cutting too high leaves considerable unutilized biomass.
*   **Method:** Harvesting can be performed manually using sickles or mechanically using fodder harvesters or mowers, depending on the scale of cultivation.
*   **Number of Cuts:** Depending on the variety, soil fertility, irrigation availability, and overall management practices, 3 to 5 cuts can typically be obtained from a single sowing during the growing season in Haryana.
