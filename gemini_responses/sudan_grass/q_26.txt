As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following information regarding specialized practices in Sudan Grass:

*   **Pruning:**
    *   The practice of "pruning" as understood for horticultural crops (e.g., fruit trees, ornamentals) is not applicable to Sudan Grass.
    *   Sudan Grass is a forage crop harvested by cutting the aerial biomass. This cutting stimulates regrowth and tillering, which is analogous to how pruning can stimulate new growth in other plants. However, this is a standard harvesting practice for forage production, not a specialized pruning technique.

*   **Desuckering:**
    *   This is not known to affect Sudan Grass.
    *   Desuckering is a practice typically applied to crops like banana or sugarcane to remove unproductive tillers or suckers. Sudan Grass is a tillering grass, and tillering is a desirable trait for maximizing biomass yield. Removing tillers would be detrimental to yield and is not practiced.

*   **Mulching:**
    *   While mulching can be beneficial for soil moisture conservation and weed control, it is not considered a specialized practice specifically for Sudan Grass in the way it might be for high-value horticultural crops.
    *   In large-scale Sudan Grass cultivation, practices like retaining crop residues from previous crops (conservation agriculture) can serve a similar purpose to mulching by improving soil health and moisture retention.
    *   Direct application of mulch after sowing or establishment is generally not practical or economically viable for a broadcast or drilled forage crop like Sudan Grass.

*   **Grafting:**
    *   This is not known to affect Sudan Grass.
    *   Grafting is a horticultural technique primarily used for dicotyledonous plants to join parts of two plants. Sudan Grass is a monocotyledonous plant (a grass), and grafting is not biologically possible or practiced in grasses.

*   **Pollination:**
    *   Sudan Grass is a wind-pollinated crop.
    *   It is primarily self-pollinated but can also cross-pollinate via wind.
    *   No specialized practices (e.g., hand pollination, managed insect pollination) are required or performed for pollination in Sudan Grass cultivation, whether for forage or seed production.
