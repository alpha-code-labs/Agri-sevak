As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the control of the mentioned conditions in Sudan Grass for Haryana, India:

*   **Fruit bursting:** This is not known to affect Sudan Grass. Sudan Grass is a forage crop primarily grown for its vegetative parts (leaves and stems) and seeds, not for fleshy fruits where "bursting" is a common issue.

*   **Hardness in fruit:** This is not known to affect Sudan Grass. As a forage crop, Sudan Grass does not produce fleshy fruits. If "hardness" refers to the lignification of stems, this is a natural process of plant maturity that affects forage quality, not a "damage" to be controlled. Harvest timing is adjusted to optimize forage quality before excessive lignification occurs.

*   **Leaf burning/melting:** This is a symptom that can occur in Sudan Grass due to various environmental stresses, nutrient imbalances, chemical phytotoxicity, or disease. It is not a primary "physical damage" in itself but an indicator of an underlying problem. Control measures focus on preventing these underlying causes:

    *   **Water Management:**
        *   Ensure adequate and timely irrigation, especially during dry periods, to prevent drought stress.
        *   Avoid waterlogging, which can also damage roots and lead to leaf symptoms.

    *   **Nutrient Management:**
        *   Conduct regular soil testing to determine nutrient status.
        *   Apply balanced fertilizers as per HAU recommendations for Sudan Grass to prevent deficiencies (e.g., potassium deficiency can cause leaf margin burn) or toxicities.

    *   **Temperature Stress:**
        *   Select Sudan Grass varieties known to be tolerant to local high temperatures if heat stress is a recurring issue.
        *   Ensure appropriate planting times to avoid extreme heat or frost during sensitive growth stages.

    *   **Salinity Management:**
        *   If soil or irrigation water salinity is an issue, adopt practices like proper drainage, use of good quality irrigation water, and selection of salt-tolerant varieties.

    *   **Chemical Phytotoxicity:**
        *   Always follow recommended dosages and application guidelines for herbicides, pesticides, and fertilizers.
        *   Ensure proper calibration of spray equipment.
        *   Avoid spraying during high temperatures or windy conditions to prevent drift and chemical burn.

    *   **Disease Management:**
        *   Regularly scout fields for signs of fungal or bacterial diseases that can cause leaf necrosis resembling burning (e.g., leaf blights).
        *   If a specific disease is identified, consult HAU for specific CIBRC-approved chemical recommendations. For general leaf blight control, if severe, a broad-spectrum fungicide might be considered, but this should be based on disease diagnosis. For example, **Propiconazole** (0.1% solution, i.e., 1 ml/L water) or **Azoxystrobin** (0.5 g/L water) can be used if a fungal blight is confirmed, following label instructions and local recommendations.
