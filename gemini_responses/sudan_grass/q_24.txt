While Sudan Grass (Sorghum bicolor subsp. drummondii) is predominantly direct-sown for fodder production due to its rapid growth, ease of establishment, and cost-effectiveness, if transplantation is opted for, the following guidelines can be followed for optimal results in Haryana:

**1. Ideal Transplantation Time:**
*   **Nursery Sowing:** Mid-June to early July, coinciding with the onset of the monsoon season for the Kharif crop.
*   **Transplanting to Main Field:** When seedlings are 3-4 weeks old and have attained a height of 15-20 cm. This typically falls between mid-July to early August.

**2. Ideal Transplantation Distance:**
*   **Row-to-Row Spacing:** 30-45 cm
*   **Plant-to-Plant Spacing (within the row):** 10-15 cm

**3. Ideal Transplantation Process:**

*   **Nursery Preparation and Sowing:**
    *   Select a well-drained, fertile nursery bed.
    *   Prepare the soil to a fine tilth and incorporate well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) at 5-10 kg per square meter.
    *   Sow Sudan Grass seeds thinly in lines 10-15 cm apart or broadcast evenly.
    *   Cover the seeds with a thin layer of soil (1-2 cm) and irrigate immediately with a fine spray.
    *   Maintain adequate moisture in the nursery bed until seedlings are ready for transplanting.

*   **Main Field Preparation:**
    *   Plough the main field 2-3 times to achieve a fine, friable tilth.
    *   Incorporate 10-15 tonnes of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) per acre during the final ploughing.
    *   Level the field to ensure uniform water distribution.

*   **Transplanting:**
    *   Irrigate the nursery bed thoroughly a few hours before uprooting seedlings. This makes uprooting easier and minimizes root damage.
    *   Carefully uproot 3-4 week old seedlings (15-20 cm tall) without damaging their root system.
    *   Plant the seedlings in the prepared main field at the recommended spacing (30-45 cm row-to-row and 10-15 cm plant-to-plant).
    *   Ensure the seedlings are planted at the same depth as they were in the nursery. Avoid bending the roots.
    *   Transplant preferably in the late afternoon or on a cloudy day to reduce transplanting shock.

*   **Post-Transplanting Care:**
    *   Provide light irrigation immediately after transplanting to help the seedlings establish.
    *   Monitor the field for any missing plants (gaps) and perform gap filling within 5-7 days of transplanting.
    *   Manage weeds effectively, especially during the initial establishment phase, as they compete for nutrients and water.
