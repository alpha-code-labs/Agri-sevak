As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach for controlling pests in Sudan Grass, focusing on cultural practices, regular monitoring, and judicious use of CIBRC-approved chemicals when necessary.

Here's the advice for controlling Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies in Sudan Grass:

### Control of Beetles in Sudan Grass

Various beetle species can affect Sudan Grass, including defoliators like Blister Beetles and Flea Beetles, and root feeders like White Grubs (larvae of Chafer Beetles).

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove crop residues and weeds that can harbor pests.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** In areas with a history of white grub infestation, deep summer ploughing can expose grubs to predators and sunlight, reducing their population.
*   **Hand Picking:** For larger beetles like Blister Beetles, hand-picking can be effective in small areas, especially during early morning or late evening.
*   **Timely Sowing:** Sowing at the recommended time can help plants establish well and tolerate minor pest damage.

**2. Chemical Control (for significant infestations):**

*   **For Foliar Feeding Beetles (e.g., Blister Beetles, Flea Beetles):**
    *   **Malathion** 50% EC: Apply 1.0 - 1.5 Litres per acre mixed in 200-400 Litres of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: Apply 100 - 150 ml per acre mixed in 200-400 Litres of water.
    *   **Quinalphos** 25% EC: Apply 1.0 - 1.2 Litres per acre mixed in 200-400 Litres of water.

*   **For White Grubs (Soil Application):**
    *   **Fipronil** 0.3% GR: Apply 6 - 8 kg per acre at the time of sowing or transplanting, or as a broadcast application and light incorporation into the soil.
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: For seed treatment, use 5-7 ml per kg of seed. For drenching, apply 100-125 ml per acre mixed in sufficient water around the root zone.

### Control of Weevils in Sudan Grass

This is not known to affect Sudan Grass.

### Control of Sawflies in Sudan Grass

This is not known to affect Sudan Grass.

### Important Precautions:

*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always observe the recommended pre-harvest interval (waiting period) between chemical application and fodder cutting to ensure the safety of the feed for livestock. This information is typically provided on the product label.
*   **Safety Gear:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (gloves, mask, protective clothing) while handling and applying pesticides.
*   **Calibration:** Ensure proper calibration of sprayers and accurate measurement of chemicals to avoid under or over-dosing.
*   **Environmental Safety:** Avoid spraying during windy conditions or when bees are actively foraging. Dispose of empty containers safely.
*   **Consult Experts:** For specific local recommendations or severe infestations, consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts.
