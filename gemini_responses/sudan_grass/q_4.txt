Wilt, including conditions that might be termed "Parawilt" (often a complex of fungal and/or bacterial pathogens, or abiotic factors mimicking wilt), can affect Sudan Grass. Various *Fusarium* species are common causes of fungal wilt, and certain bacterial pathogens can also induce wilt symptoms in Sudan Grass and related fodder crops.

Control measures for Wilt in Sudan Grass should focus on an integrated approach:

### I. Cultural and Agronomic Practices:

1.  **Resistant Varieties:** Where available and suitable for Haryana's agro-climatic conditions, select and plant wilt-resistant or tolerant Sudan Grass varieties. Consult HAU's latest recommendations for specific varieties.
2.  **Crop Rotation:** Implement a strict crop rotation schedule with non-host crops (e.g., legumes, wheat, mustard) for at least 2-3 years to reduce the build-up of soil-borne pathogens. Avoid continuous cultivation of Sudan Grass or other susceptible fodder crops.
3.  **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris immediately after harvest. Deep ploughing can help bury crop residues and reduce pathogen inoculum.
4.  **Soil Health Management:**
    *   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure balanced fertilization. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can make plants more susceptible. Adequate potassium can improve plant vigor and resistance.
    *   **Drainage:** Improve soil drainage to prevent waterlogging, which stresses plants and favors certain wilt pathogens.
    *   **Soil pH:** Maintain optimal soil pH for Sudan Grass growth, as extreme pH can stress plants.
5.  **Irrigation Management:** Provide adequate and timely irrigation. Avoid both water stress (which can predispose plants to wilt) and over-irrigation (which can create anaerobic conditions and favor root rot/wilt pathogens).
6.  **Timely Sowing:** Sow at the recommended time to ensure vigorous plant growth and reduce susceptibility to early-season infections.
7.  **Weed Control:** Manage weeds effectively, as they can compete for nutrients and water, stressing the crop, and some may act as alternate hosts for pathogens.

### II. Biological Control:

1.  **Bio-fungicides:** Application of CIBRC approved bio-agents like *Trichoderma viride* or *Pseudomonas fluorescens* as seed treatment or soil application can help suppress soil-borne fungal pathogens causing wilt.
    *   **Seed Treatment:** Mix 10 g of *Trichoderma viride* (or *Pseudomonas fluorescens*) formulation per kg of seed before sowing.
    *   **Soil Application:** Mix 2.5 kg of *Trichoderma viride* (or *Pseudomonas fluorescens*) formulation with 50 kg of farmyard manure (FYM) and apply per acre before sowing or transplanting.

### III. Chemical Control:

Chemical control is primarily effective as a preventive measure, especially through seed treatment.

1.  **Seed Treatment (for Fungal Wilts):**
    *   Treat Sudan Grass seeds with a systemic fungicide before sowing to protect against soil-borne fungal pathogens.
    *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: 1-2 g per kg of seed.
    *   **Thiram** 75% WS: 2-3 g per kg of seed.
    *   **Captan** 50% WP: 2-3 g per kg of seed.

2.  **Soil Drench (for Fungal Wilts in severe cases):**
    *   In areas with a history of severe wilt, a soil drench might be considered, though it is less common for large-scale fodder crops.
    *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: 1 g per litre of water, applied around the base of affected plants.

3.  **For Bacterial Wilts (if identified):**
    *   If bacterial wilt is confirmed, seed treatment with an antibiotic mixture can be considered.
    *   **Streptomycin sulphate** 9% + **Tetracycline hydrochloride** 1% SP: 100-200 mg per kg of seed for seed treatment, or 1 g per litre of water for foliar spray/drench in severe cases (consult local HAU experts for specific recommendations and CIBRC approval for this use in Sudan Grass).

Always consult with your local HAU extension specialist for the most current and specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and the prevailing disease situation in Haryana.
