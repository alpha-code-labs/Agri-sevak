Dear Farmer,

Incorporating organic manures is crucial for improving soil health, fertility, and overall productivity of Sudan Grass in Haryana. Here are the recommended doses for the mentioned organic inputs:

*   **Farm Yard Manure (FYM):**
    *   Apply 10-15 tonnes per acre of well-decomposed FYM.
    *   It should be incorporated into the soil at least 2-3 weeks before sowing.
    *   For soils with very low organic matter, the dose can be increased up to 20 tonnes per acre.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   Apply 2-4 tonnes per acre.
    *   Vermicompost can be applied before sowing and incorporated into the soil, or as a top-dressing after the first cut, followed by light irrigation.

*   **Sagarika:**
    *   Sagarika is a seaweed extract-based biostimulant/plant growth promoter, not a bulk organic manure like FYM or vermicompost. It helps in enhancing nutrient uptake, root development, and overall plant vigor.
    *   **Foliar Application:** Mix 250-500 ml of Sagarika in 150-200 litres of water per acre.
    *   **Application Timing:**
        *   First spray: 20-25 days after sowing.
        *   Second spray: 15-20 days after the first cut.
        *   Subsequent sprays can be given after each cut, depending on crop vigor and nutrient demand.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always ensure the FYM and vermicompost are well-decomposed to avoid nutrient immobilization and pest issues.
*   For precise nutrient management, it is highly recommended to conduct a soil test every 2-3 years. This will help in determining the exact nutrient deficiencies and organic matter status of your soil, allowing for tailored recommendations.
