As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the use of Growth Regulators/Hormones in Sudan Grass for Haryana:

**1. Ethephon (Ethrel)**
The use of **Ethephon** as a growth regulator/hormone in Sudan Grass is not a standard recommended practice for forage production in Haryana. There are no established recommendations for its dose or application timing for this purpose.

**2. 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D)**
While **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid** is a synthetic auxin, its application as a growth regulator/hormone for Sudan Grass is not a standard recommended practice in Haryana. Its primary agricultural use in Sudan Grass is as a selective herbicide for broadleaf weed control, at specific doses and timings, which is distinct from its role as a growth regulator.

**3. Boron**
Boron is an essential micronutrient, not a hormone or growth regulator in the same category as Ethephon or 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid. Its application is recommended only when soil tests indicate a deficiency. For Haryana soils, general recommendations for Boron application in fodder crops like Sudan Grass, if deficiency is confirmed, are as follows:

*   **Foliar Application:**
    *   Apply a 0.2% solution of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** or **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate).
    *   This translates to approximately 2 g of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** or 2.5 g of **Borax** per litre of water.
    *   Spray 200-250 litres of solution per acre (i.e., 400-500 g of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** or 500-625 g of **Borax** per acre).
    *   Apply at the tillering stage or early vegetative growth.

*   **Soil Application (if severe deficiency is confirmed by soil test):**
    *   Apply 1-2 kg of **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate) per acre, mixed with sand or fertilizer, at the time of sowing. This method is less common for fodder crops unless a severe deficiency is known.

**Important Note:** Always conduct a soil test to determine nutrient deficiencies before applying micronutrients like Boron. Over-application of Boron can be toxic to plants.
