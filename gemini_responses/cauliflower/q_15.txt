As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Cauliflower in Haryana:

### Control Measures for Pests in Cauliflower

**1. Grasshopper**
Grasshoppers are generalist feeders and can cause damage to cauliflower leaves, especially in young plants.
*   **Cultural Control:** Maintain field sanitation, remove weeds, and deep ploughing after harvest can expose grasshopper eggs to predators and harsh weather.
*   **Chemical Control:** In case of severe infestation, consider spraying:
    *   **Malathion 50% EC** at 1.0 - 1.5 L per acre (mixed in 200-400 L of water).
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC** at 200 - 250 ml per acre (mixed in 200-400 L of water).

**2. Painted bug (Bagrada hilaris)**
The painted bug is a significant sucking pest of cruciferous crops like cauliflower. It sucks sap from leaves and growing points, leading to wilting, stunting, and reduced yield.
*   **Cultural Control:** Remove cruciferous weeds from around the field, as they can serve as alternate hosts. Early sowing can sometimes help avoid peak pest populations.
*   **Chemical Control:** For effective control, spray with:
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL** at 100 - 125 ml per acre (mixed in 200-400 L of water).
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG** at 80 - 100 g per acre (mixed in 200-400 L of water).
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP** at 80 - 100 g per acre (mixed in 200-400 L of water).

**3. Red cotton bug**
This is not known to affect Cauliflower. The red cotton bug is primarily a pest of cotton and other malvaceous plants.

**4. Black ants**
This is not known to directly affect Cauliflower as a primary pest causing significant damage to the crop itself. While ants may be present in the field, often associated with other pests like aphids (feeding on honeydew), they do not typically feed on or damage cauliflower plants directly to an extent requiring specific control measures for the crop. If ants are protecting aphids, controlling the aphids will indirectly manage the ant population.
