As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm that Wilt and Parawilt are significant challenges in cauliflower cultivation in Haryana, often leading to substantial yield losses. These conditions are primarily caused by soil-borne fungal pathogens, most commonly *Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. conglutinans*. The term "Parawilt" often refers to a sudden wilting and collapse of plants, which can be due to a complex interaction of pathogens (like *Fusarium*) and environmental stresses such as high temperatures, waterlogging, or drought.

Effective management of Wilt and Parawilt requires an integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical control measures.

### Integrated Management Strategies for Wilt (including Parawilt) in Cauliflower:

1.  **Cultural Practices (Foundation of Control):**
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Implement a strict 3-4 year crop rotation plan, avoiding other cruciferous crops (like cabbage, broccoli, radish, mustard) in the same field to break the disease cycle.
    *   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available and suitable for Haryana's agro-climatic conditions, select cauliflower varieties known for their resistance or tolerance to wilt. Consult local HAU extension services for recommended varieties.
    *   **Soil Solarization:** During the hot summer months (May-June), prepare the field, moisten the soil, and cover it tightly with transparent polyethylene sheets (100-150 micron thickness) for 4-6 weeks. This raises soil temperature sufficiently to kill many soil-borne pathogens, including *Fusarium*.
    *   **Proper Drainage:** Ensure excellent field drainage to prevent waterlogging, which stresses plants and creates anaerobic conditions favorable for some pathogens. Raised beds can be beneficial.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Promptly identify, remove, and destroy infected plants along with surrounding soil to prevent the spread of inoculum. Clean farm tools and equipment thoroughly after use in infected fields.
    *   **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced fertilizers based on soil test recommendations. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can make plants more susceptible. Adequate potassium and phosphorus promote plant vigor and resistance.
    *   **Water Management:** Avoid both water stress (drought) and over-irrigation. Maintain consistent and appropriate soil moisture levels, especially during critical growth stages.
    *   **Deep Ploughing:** Expose the soil to direct sunlight during summer fallow periods by deep ploughing, which helps reduce pathogen populations.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   **Trichoderma viride / Trichoderma harzianum:** These beneficial fungi act as bio-control agents against soil-borne pathogens.
        *   **Soil Application:** Mix 2.5 kg of **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum** formulation with 50 kg of well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost. Keep the mixture moist for 7-10 days in a shaded area, then broadcast it uniformly over one acre of land and incorporate it into the soil before transplanting.
        *   **Seed Treatment:** Treat cauliflower seeds with **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum** @ 4-6 g/kg seed before sowing.

3.  **Chemical Control (Use CIBRC approved technical names only):**
    *   **Seed Treatment:** To protect seedlings from early infection and reduce initial inoculum.
        *   **Carbendazim** @ 1-2 g/kg seed.
        *   **Thiram** @ 2-3 g/kg seed.
    *   **Nursery Bed Treatment / Soil Drenching:**
        *   Before transplanting, drench nursery beds with a fungicide solution. After transplanting, drench around the base of affected plants or in areas where wilt is anticipated. Repeat drenching if symptoms persist or new plants show signs of wilting, typically at 10-15 day intervals.
        *   **Carbendazim** @ 1-2 g/L water (for drenching, apply 200-250 ml solution per plant or 200-250 L/acre for general field drench).
        *   **Thiophanate Methyl** @ 1-1.5 g/L water (for drenching, similar application rates as Carbendazim).
        *   **Propiconazole** @ 0.5-1 ml/L water (for drenching, similar application rates).
    *   **For suspected bacterial wilt (less common for cauliflower wilt, but if symptoms suggest it, e.g., water-soaked lesions leading to wilting):**
        *   **Streptomycin Sulphate + Tetracycline Hydrochloride** (as a readymix formulation) @ 0.5-1 g/L water for drenching.
        *   **Copper Oxychloride** @ 2-3 g/L water for drenching.

Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions when handling and applying any chemical. It is advisable to consult with local agricultural extension officers from HAU for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and the prevailing disease situation.
