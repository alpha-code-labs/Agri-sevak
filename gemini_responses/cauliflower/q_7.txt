As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm the following regarding the diseases mentioned for Cauliflower:

*   **Dieback:** This is not known to affect Cauliflower in the typical sense of a specific disease. While parts of a cauliflower plant can die back due to various stresses (e.g., waterlogging, nutrient deficiency, severe pest damage, or other specific diseases like *Alternaria* leaf spot causing severe necrosis), "Dieback" as a primary disease term is not applied to cauliflower.
*   **Twig blight:** This is not known to affect Cauliflower. Cauliflower is an herbaceous plant and does not have twigs.
*   **Tikka disease:** This is not known to affect Cauliflower. Tikka disease is a specific fungal disease primarily affecting groundnut (peanut).
