Namaste, Kisan Bhaiyon! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can confirm that Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies are indeed known pests of cauliflower in Haryana. Effective management requires an integrated approach combining cultural practices with judicious use of CIBRC-approved insecticides.

Here's how to control them:

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy crop residues after harvest to reduce overwintering pest populations.
*   **Weed Management:** Keep the field free of weeds, especially cruciferous weeds, which can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
*   **Early Detection:** Regularly monitor your cauliflower crop, especially during the seedling stage, for signs of pest damage or presence. Hand-picking of sawfly larvae can be effective in small infestations.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting cauliflower or other cruciferous crops in the same field consecutively to break the pest life cycle.

**2. Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved Insecticides):**
When pest populations reach economic threshold levels, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always ensure thorough spray coverage for best results.

*   **For Sawflies (e.g., Mustard Sawfly larvae) and Chewing Beetles (e.g., Flea Beetles, Leaf Beetles):**
    *   **Malathion** 50% EC: Apply 1.0 - 1.25 litres per acre mixed in 500 litres of water.
    *   **Quinalphos** 25% EC: Apply 1.0 - 1.25 litres per acre mixed in 500 litres of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: Apply 200 - 250 ml per acre mixed in 200-400 litres of water.
    *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: Apply 1.0 - 1.25 litres per acre mixed in 500 litres of water.
    *   **Emamectin Benzoate** 5% SG: Apply 80 - 100 grams per acre mixed in 200-400 litres of water (highly effective against sawfly larvae).

*   **For Weevils (e.g., Cabbage Stem Weevil, Turnip Gall Weevil):**
    *   Control often targets adult weevils to prevent egg-laying or early larval stages.
    *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: Apply 1.0 - 1.25 litres per acre mixed in 500 litres of water. This can be sprayed on foliage or, if stem/root weevils are suspected, applied as a drench around the base of the plants.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: Apply 200 - 250 ml per acre mixed in 200-400 litres of water.
    *   **Quinalphos** 25% EC: Apply 1.0 - 1.25 litres per acre mixed in 500 litres of water.

*   **For Flea Beetles (especially at seedling stage for early protection):**
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: Apply 100 - 125 ml per acre mixed in 200-400 litres of water.
    *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: Apply 50 - 100 grams per acre mixed in 200-400 litres of water.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Read the Label:** Always read and strictly follow the instructions, dosage, and safety precautions mentioned on the insecticide label.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Observe the specified pre-harvest interval before harvesting to ensure the produce is safe for consumption.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pest resistance.
*   **Safety:** Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, and protective clothing while handling and spraying chemicals.
*   **Timing:** Spray during the cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
