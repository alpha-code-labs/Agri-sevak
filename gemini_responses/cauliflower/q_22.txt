As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following cultivation practices for Cauliflower in Haryana:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   Cauliflower is primarily grown by transplanting seedlings. Seeds are first sown in a nursery, and then 4-6 week old seedlings are transplanted to the main field.
    *   **Nursery Sowing:** Seeds can be sown in well-prepared raised nursery beds (1 meter wide, 15-20 cm high, and of convenient length). Sow seeds thinly in lines 5-7 cm apart, or broadcast evenly. Cover with a thin layer of soil or sand.
    *   **Main Field Transplanting:** Seedlings are transplanted into the main field in a row-to-row and plant-to-plant pattern.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   **Nursery Sowing:** Seeds should be sown shallowly, typically at a depth of 0.5 to 1.0 cm.
    *   **Main Field Transplanting:** Seedlings should be planted at the same depth they were growing in the nursery, ensuring the root ball is well covered with soil. Avoid planting too deep or too shallow.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   Spacing recommendations vary slightly depending on the variety (early, mid, late) and desired curd size.
    *   **Early Varieties:**
        *   Row-to-row: 45-60 cm
        *   Plant-to-plant: 30-45 cm
    *   **Mid and Late Varieties:**
        *   Row-to-row: 60-75 cm
        *   Plant-to-plant: 45-60 cm

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   The recommended seed dose for cauliflower generally ranges from 400 to 600 g/acre.
    *   **Early Varieties:** Approximately 500-600 g/acre.
    *   **Mid and Late Varieties:** Approximately 400-500 g/acre.
    *   (Note: This accounts for nursery raising and subsequent transplanting, assuming good germination and seedling survival.)
