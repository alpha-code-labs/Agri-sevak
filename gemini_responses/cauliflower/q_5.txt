As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned conditions in Cauliflower in Haryana:

### Scab

This is not known to be a common or major disease affecting Cauliflower in Haryana. While some minor blemishes or leaf spots might occur, a distinct "Scab" disease requiring specific control measures is not typically recognized for Cauliflower.

### Canker (Phoma Stem Canker / Blackleg)

Canker, caused by the fungus *Leptosphaeria maculans* (anamorph *Phoma lingam*), is a significant disease of Cauliflower and other brassicas. It can cause dark lesions on stems, leaves, and pods, leading to wilting and plant death.

**Control Measures:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Practice a minimum 3-4 year crop rotation with non-brassica crops to reduce pathogen inoculum in the soil.
    *   **Disease-Free Seeds:** Always use certified, disease-free seeds.
    *   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy all infected crop residues immediately after harvest. Avoid leaving brassica weeds in or around the field.
    *   **Field Hygiene:** Ensure good field sanitation to prevent the spread of spores.

2.  **Chemical Control:**

    *   **Seed Treatment (Crucial for prevention):**
        *   Treat seeds before sowing with:
            *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: 2 g per kg of seed.
            *   **Thiram** 75% WS: 2.5 g per kg of seed.
            *   A combination product containing **Fludioxonil** 2.5% FS + **Metalaxyl-M** 1.0% FS: 10 ml per kg of seed.

    *   **Foliar Spray (if disease symptoms appear in the field):**
        *   Apply fungicides at the first sign of disease, ensuring thorough coverage. Repeat sprays as per product label recommendations, typically at 10-15 day intervals, depending on disease severity and weather conditions.
            *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC: 0.5-1 ml per litre of water (or 200-400 ml per acre).
            *   **Difenoconazole** 25% EC: 0.5 ml per litre of water (or 200 ml per acre).
            *   **Propiconazole** 25% EC: 0.5 ml per litre of water (or 200 ml per acre).
            *   **Tebuconazole** 25.9% EC: 0.75 ml per litre of water (or 300 ml per acre).
            *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP: 2.5 g per litre of water (or 1 kg per acre).

### Gummosis

This is not known to affect Cauliflower. Gummosis is typically a condition observed in woody plants (trees and shrubs) where sap or gum exudes from the bark, often in response to disease or injury. Cauliflower is an herbaceous plant and does not exhibit gummosis.

### Lichen

This is not known to affect Cauliflower. Lichens are symbiotic organisms (fungus and alga) that grow on surfaces like tree bark, rocks, or soil. They are non-parasitic and do not grow on herbaceous annual plants like Cauliflower.
