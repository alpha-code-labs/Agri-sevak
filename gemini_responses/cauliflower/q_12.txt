As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Scale insects and Mealybugs in Cauliflower in Haryana:

**Scale Insects in Cauliflower:**
This is not known to affect Cauliflower as a significant pest in Haryana.

**Mealybugs in Cauliflower:**
Mealybugs (e.g., *Phenacoccus solenopsis*) can be a significant pest of cauliflower, especially during warmer periods. They feed on plant sap, leading to stunted growth, yellowing, and reduced yield. Their waxy coating makes them difficult to control. An Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is recommended.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Mealybugs:**

1.  **Monitoring:**
    *   Regularly inspect cauliflower plants, especially the undersides of leaves, stem joints, and developing curds, for the presence of mealybugs. Early detection is crucial for effective control.

2.  **Cultural and Mechanical Practices:**
    *   **Weed Management:** Remove weeds from and around the field, as many weeds can serve as alternate hosts for mealybugs.
    *   **Pruning:** For small infestations, manually remove and destroy heavily infested plant parts or entire plants.
    *   **Sanitation:** Remove crop residues after harvest to reduce carry-over populations.
    *   **Avoid Excessive Nitrogen:** High nitrogen fertilization can lead to lush, soft growth that is more attractive to mealybugs.

3.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Conserve and encourage natural enemies such as ladybird beetles, lacewings, and parasitoid wasps (e.g., *Anagyrus lopezi*). Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

4.  **Chemical Control (Apply only when necessary and as a last resort):**
    *   When mealybug populations are high and causing economic damage, chemical intervention may be required. Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and in plant crevices where mealybugs hide.
    *   Always use a spreading agent/sticker with the insecticide solution to improve penetration through the waxy coating of mealybugs.
    *   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

    **CIBRC Approved Insecticides for Mealybugs in Cauliflower:**

    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at a rate of **2.5 ml/L** of water. This is an Insect Growth Regulator (IGR) that primarily affects nymphs by inhibiting chitin synthesis.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at a rate of **0.5 g/L** of water. This is a systemic neonicotinoid insecticide effective against sucking pests.
    *   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:** Apply at a rate of **1.0 - 1.25 ml/L** of water. This is a systemic insecticide with dual-directional movement, providing excellent control of hidden pests like mealybugs.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the insecticide label carefully, including dosage, application method, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and safety precautions.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension services or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and current pest pressure.
