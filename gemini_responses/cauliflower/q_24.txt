As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified practices for cauliflower transplantation in Haryana:

### Ideal Transplantation Time

The optimal transplantation time for cauliflower in Haryana depends on the variety and desired harvest period, primarily aligning with the Rabi (winter) season.

*   **Early Varieties:** For harvesting in September-October, transplant seedlings raised in July-August.
*   **Main/Mid-Season Varieties:** For harvesting in December-January, transplant seedlings raised in September-October. This is the most common and ideal period for high-quality curds.
*   **Late Varieties:** For harvesting in February-March, transplant seedlings raised in October-November.

**Nursery Period:** Seedlings are typically ready for transplanting when they are 4-6 weeks old and have developed 4-5 true leaves.

### Ideal Transplantation Distance

Maintaining proper spacing is crucial for optimal growth, curd development, and air circulation, which helps in disease management.

*   **Row-to-Row Distance:** 45-60 cm
*   **Plant-to-Plant Distance:** 30-45 cm

**Note:**
*   Closer spacing (e.g., 45x30 cm) is often used for early varieties or when smaller curd sizes are desired.
*   Wider spacing (e.g., 60x45 cm) is preferred for main-season and late varieties to allow for larger curd development and better air circulation.

### Ideal Transplantation Process

A meticulous transplantation process minimizes shock and ensures healthy establishment of the cauliflower crop.

1.  **Seedling Preparation:**
    *   Ensure seedlings are 4-6 weeks old, healthy, and stocky, with 4-5 true leaves.
    *   **Hardening Off:** Gradually expose seedlings to outdoor conditions (reduced water, increased sunlight) for 7-10 days before transplanting to acclimate them to field conditions and reduce transplant shock.

2.  **Field Preparation:**
    *   The field should be well-prepared with deep ploughing, harrowing, and leveling.
    *   Incorporate well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost (20-25 tonnes/acre) during the final ploughing.
    *   Ensure the soil has good drainage and a pH between 6.0-7.0.
    *   Apply basal doses of fertilizers as per soil test recommendations.

3.  **Pre-Transplant Irrigation:**
    *   Lightly irrigate the nursery beds a few hours before transplanting to moisten the soil, making it easier to remove seedlings with an intact root ball.
    *   If the field is dry, give a light irrigation (palewa) a day or two before transplanting to ensure adequate moisture.

4.  **Timing of Transplanting:**
    *   Transplant seedlings preferably in the late afternoon or on a cloudy day to avoid direct harsh sunlight, which can cause wilting and transplant shock.

5.  **Transplanting Method:**
    *   Carefully lift seedlings from the nursery bed, ensuring a ball of earth adheres to the roots to minimize root disturbance.
    *   Plant the seedlings at the same depth they were growing in the nursery. Avoid planting too deep or too shallow.
    *   Gently firm the soil around the base of each seedling to ensure good root-to-soil contact and remove air pockets.

6.  **Post-Transplant Irrigation:**
    *   Immediately after transplanting, provide a light irrigation to settle the soil around the roots and help the seedlings establish.

7.  **Gap Filling:**
    *   Inspect the field 5-7 days after transplanting. Replace any dead or unhealthy seedlings with healthy ones from the nursery to maintain uniform plant stand.
