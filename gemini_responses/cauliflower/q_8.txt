As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I will provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling sucking pests in Cauliflower in Haryana.

First, addressing your query about Psylla:
This is not known to affect Cauliflower.

Now, regarding the control of Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips in Cauliflower:

Sucking pests can cause significant damage by feeding on plant sap, leading to curling, yellowing, stunting, and reduced yield. They can also transmit viral diseases. An integrated pest management (IPM) approach is recommended, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies:**

1.  **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your cauliflower crop, especially the undersides of leaves and growing points, for the presence of pests. Early detection is crucial.
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Remove weeds from and around the field, as they can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
    *   Ensure balanced fertilization; excessive nitrogen can lead to lush growth, making plants more attractive to sucking pests.
    *   Use yellow sticky traps (10-15 traps per acre) to monitor and mass-trap whiteflies and leafhoppers.
3.  **Biological Control:** Conserve natural enemies like ladybird beetles, lacewings, and parasitic wasps, which prey on aphids and whiteflies. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.
4.  **Resistant Varieties:** While specific resistant varieties for all sucking pests in cauliflower are not widely available, choosing healthy, vigorous planting material can help.

**Chemical Control (When pest populations reach economic threshold levels):**

When chemical intervention is necessary, it is crucial to use CIBRC approved technical chemicals and rotate them to prevent the development of resistance. Always ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves.

Here are some recommended CIBRC approved technical chemicals and their dosages:

*   **For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips (Broad Spectrum):**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** 125-150 ml per acre (or 0.5 ml per litre of water).
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** 50-100 g per acre (or 0.2-0.4 g per litre of water).
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** 100-125 g per acre (or 0.4-0.5 g per litre of water).
    *   **Dinotefuran 20% SG:** 150-200 g per acre (or 0.6-0.8 g per litre of water).

*   **Primarily for Whitefly Nymphs:**
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** 600-800 ml per acre (or 2.4-3.2 ml per litre of water). This is an Insect Growth Regulator (IGR) and is effective against nymphs.

*   **Primarily for Aphids:**
    *   **Flonicamid 50% WG:** 60 g per acre (or 0.24 g per litre of water). This is a selective aphicide.

*   **Primarily for Thrips and Leafhoppers:**
    *   **Fipronil 5% SC:** 600-800 ml per acre (or 2.4-3.2 ml per litre of water).

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Rotation:** Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in pest populations.
*   **Timing:** Apply insecticides during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Strictly observe the pre-harvest interval mentioned on the insecticide label to ensure the produce is safe for consumption.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying. Follow all safety instructions on the product label.
