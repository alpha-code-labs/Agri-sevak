As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the use of Ethrel, 2,4-D, and Boron in Cauliflower cultivation in Haryana:

---

### **1. Ethrel (Ethephon)**

**Ethephon** is a plant growth regulator that releases ethylene within plant tissues. Its primary applications include fruit ripening, flower induction, and promoting abscission.

*   **Recommendation for Cauliflower:** This is not known to be a standard or recommended growth regulator for enhancing curd development, yield, or quality in cauliflower cultivation in Haryana. Its use for these purposes is generally not advised as it can lead to undesirable effects such as premature senescence or phytotoxicity if not applied precisely for specific research objectives.

### **2. 2,4-D (2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid)**

**2,4-D** is a synthetic auxin. While auxins are plant hormones, 2,4-D is predominantly known and registered as a selective broadleaf herbicide.

*   **Recommendation for Cauliflower:** This is not known to be a recommended growth regulator for cauliflower. Using 2,4-D as a growth regulator in vegetable crops like cauliflower is extremely risky due to its very narrow margin between a hormonal effect and its potent herbicidal effect. Even slight overdoses can cause severe damage, malformations, or complete crop failure. Therefore, its use for growth regulation in cauliflower is strongly discouraged.

### **3. Boron**

Boron is an essential micronutrient, not a growth regulator or hormone. It plays a crucial role in cell wall formation, sugar transport, pollen germination, and overall plant development. Cauliflower is highly susceptible to Boron deficiency.

*   **Symptoms of Boron Deficiency:** In cauliflower, Boron deficiency typically manifests as "brown rot" or "hollow stem." The curd develops a brownish discoloration, becomes bitter, and the stem may become hollow and water-soaked.

*   **Recommended Doses for Cauliflower:**

    *   **Soil Application (Preventive):**
        *   Apply 10-15 kg/acre of **Borax (Disodium Tetraborate Decahydrate)** or 5-7 kg/acre of **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** at the time of field preparation or transplanting, especially in soils known to be deficient in Boron. This should be mixed thoroughly with the soil.

    *   **Foliar Application (Corrective/Preventive):**
        *   If deficiency symptoms appear or as a preventive measure in susceptible areas, spray 1.5-2.0 g/L of **Borax (Disodium Tetraborate Decahydrate)** or 1.0-1.5 g/L of **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** in water.
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, starting from 3-4 weeks after transplanting or at the curd initiation stage. Ensure complete coverage of the foliage.

**Note:** Always ensure proper soil testing to determine Boron levels before application, as excessive Boron can also be toxic to plants.
