As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following doses for organic manures in cauliflower cultivation, based on scientific verification for Haryana conditions:

*   **Farm Yard Manure (FYM)**
    *   Apply **Farm Yard Manure (FYM)** at a rate of 20-25 tonnes per acre. It should be well-decomposed and incorporated thoroughly into the soil during land preparation, at least 2-3 weeks before transplanting. This provides a broad spectrum of nutrients and improves soil structure and water retention.

*   **Vermicompost**
    *   Apply **Vermicompost** at a rate of 4-5 tonnes per acre. Similar to FYM, it should be incorporated into the soil during land preparation. Vermicompost is richer in nutrients and microbial activity than FYM, contributing to better plant growth and soil health. It can also be used as a partial replacement for FYM or as a top-dressing.

*   **Sagarika**
    *   **Sagarika** is a seaweed extract-based bio-stimulant that enhances nutrient uptake and plant growth. It is not a bulk manure but an additive.
        *   **Foliar Spray:** Mix **Sagarika** liquid at a concentration of 2.5-3 ml per litre of water. Apply 2-3 foliar sprays at 15-20 day intervals, starting from 20-25 days after transplanting. Ensure complete coverage of the foliage.
        *   **Soil Application (Drench/Drip):** For soil application, use **Sagarika** liquid at a rate of 1-1.5 litres per acre. Apply at critical growth stages, such as vegetative growth and curd initiation, either through drenching around the root zone or via drip irrigation.
