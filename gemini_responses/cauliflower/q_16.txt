As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following fertilizer schedule for Cauliflower cultivation in Haryana. Please note that these are general recommendations for average soil conditions. For precise nutrient management, **soil testing is highly recommended** to tailor the fertilizer application to your specific field's requirements.

Cauliflower is a heavy feeder and requires a balanced supply of macro and micronutrients for optimal growth and curd formation.

**General Nutrient Requirements for Cauliflower (per acre):**
*   **Nitrogen (N):** 100-120 kg
*   **Phosphorus (P2O5):** 60 kg
*   **Potassium (K2O):** 60 kg
*   **Sulphur (S):** 20 kg
*   **Boron (B):** 1-2 kg
*   **Molybdenum (Mo):** 0.5 kg

**Recommended Fertilizer Doses and Application Timing:**

**1. Basal Application (at the time of transplanting):**
Apply the following fertilizers and micronutrients uniformly in the field and incorporate them into the soil before transplanting the seedlings.

*   **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP):** 130 kg/acre
    *   *This provides approximately 23.4 kg N and 59.8 kg P2O5.*
*   **Muriate of Potash (MOP):** 100 kg/acre
    *   *This provides approximately 60 kg K2O.*
*   **Urea:** 80 kg/acre
    *   *This provides approximately 36.8 kg N.*
*   **Elemental Sulphur:** 20 kg/acre
    *   *Alternatively, 200 kg of **Gypsum** (Calcium Sulphate) can be used to supply Sulphur and Calcium.*
*   **Borax (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate):** 10 kg/acre
    *   *This provides 1-2 kg of Boron, crucial for curd development and preventing hollow stem.*
*   **Sodium Molybdate:** 0.5 kg/acre
    *   *This provides Molybdenum, essential for nitrogen metabolism and preventing 'whiptail' disorder.*

**2. Top Dressing (30-45 days after transplanting):**
Apply the remaining Nitrogen as a top-dressing when the plants are well-established and actively growing.

*   **Urea:** 100 kg/acre
    *   *This provides approximately 46 kg N.*

**Total Nutrients Supplied (approximate):**
*   **Nitrogen (N):** 23.4 kg (from DAP) + 36.8 kg (Basal Urea) + 46 kg (Top-dress Urea) = **106.2 kg/acre**
*   **Phosphorus (P2O5):** **59.8 kg/acre**
*   **Potassium (K2O):** **60 kg/acre**
*   **Sulphur (S):** **20 kg/acre**

**Specific Fertilizers and Their Role:**

*   **Urea:**
    *   **Basal:** 80 kg/acre
    *   **Top Dressing:** 100 kg/acre
    *   *Provides readily available Nitrogen for vegetative growth.*

*   **Nano Urea (Liquid):**
    *   **Recommended Dose:** 2-4 ml/L of water.
    *   **Application:** Foliar spray. Apply 1-2 sprays at critical growth stages (e.g., 30-40 days after transplanting and pre-curd initiation).
    *   *Nano Urea is a supplementary source of Nitrogen, enhancing nutrient use efficiency and reducing the requirement for granular Urea. It is not a complete replacement for basal granular Urea for heavy feeders like cauliflower.*

*   **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP):**
    *   **Basal:** 130 kg/acre
    *   *Provides Phosphorus for root development, flowering, and energy transfer, along with some Nitrogen.*

*   **Nano DAP (Liquid):**
    *   **Recommended Dose:** 2-4 ml/L of water.
    *   **Application:** Foliar spray. Apply 1-2 sprays at critical growth stages (e.g., pre-flowering/curd initiation).
    *   *Nano DAP is a supplementary source of Phosphorus and Nitrogen, improving nutrient uptake and plant vigor. It is not a complete replacement for basal granular DAP.*

*   **NPK (Complex NPK Fertilizers):**
    *   If using complex NPK fertilizers (e.g., 12:32:16, 10:26:26), the doses of individual Urea, DAP, and MOP would need to be adjusted to meet the target N, P2O5, and K2O requirements. For example, to meet 60 kg P2O5, you would need approximately 187.5 kg of NPK 12:32:16, which would also supply 22.5 kg N and 30 kg K2O. The remaining N and K would then be supplied by Urea and MOP.

*   **Single Super Phosphate (SSP):**
    *   **Alternative for Phosphorus and Sulphur:** If **Single Super Phosphate** (SSP) is preferred over DAP, apply 375 kg/acre as a basal dose.
    *   *This provides approximately 60 kg P2O5 and 41 kg S. If SSP is used, the separate application of Elemental Sulphur would not be required, and the basal Urea dose would need to be increased to compensate for the N not supplied by DAP.*

*   **Muriate of Potash (MOP):**
    *   **Basal:** 100 kg/acre
    *   *Provides Potassium for overall plant health, disease resistance, water regulation, and curd quality.*

*   **Sulphur:**
    *   **Basal:** 20 kg/acre of **Elemental Sulphur** (or 200 kg **Gypsum**).
    *   *Sulphur is essential for protein synthesis, chlorophyll formation, and improving nutrient use efficiency. It also helps in improving soil health.*

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Soil Testing:** Always prioritize soil test-based recommendations for optimal and sustainable nutrient management.
*   **Irrigation:** Ensure adequate and timely irrigation, especially after fertilizer application, to facilitate nutrient uptake.
*   **Organic Manures:** Supplementing chemical fertilizers with well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) at 10-15 tonnes/acre or vermicompost at 2-3 tonnes/acre can significantly improve soil health and nutrient availability.
