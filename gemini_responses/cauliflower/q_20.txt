As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I emphasize the critical role of micronutrients for healthy cauliflower growth and optimal yield in Haryana. Deficiencies can significantly impact curd quality and overall plant vigor.

**General Recommendations:**
1.  **Soil Testing:** The most accurate way to diagnose micronutrient deficiencies is through regular soil testing. This allows for precise, site-specific recommendations.
2.  **Integrated Nutrient Management:** Combine organic matter application (farmyard manure, compost) with judicious use of chemical fertilizers.
3.  **Foliar Application:** For quick correction of visible deficiency symptoms, foliar sprays are generally more effective than soil application for micronutrients. Apply sprays during cooler parts of the day (morning or evening) and ensure good coverage. A spreading agent/sticker can improve efficacy.

Here's how to address specific micronutrient deficiencies in Cauliflower:

### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted plant growth, small and narrow leaves (often called "little leaf"), interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, and sometimes a rosetted appearance.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (21% Zn) @ 10-12 kg/acre at the time of land preparation or transplanting.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Spray with **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (21% Zn) @ 2.5-5 g/L water, or **Zinc EDTA** (12% Zn) @ 0.5-1 g/L water. Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, starting 3-4 weeks after transplanting or upon symptom appearance.

### 2. Iron (Fe) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Prominent interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on young leaves, with veins remaining green. In severe cases, the entire leaf may turn yellow or even white.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** In non-calcareous soils, **Ferrous sulphate** (19% Fe) @ 20-25 kg/acre can be applied. However, soil application is often less effective in alkaline soils common in Haryana.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Spray with **Ferrous sulphate** (19% Fe) @ 5 g/L water, or **Iron EDTA** (12% Fe) @ 1-2 g/L water. Apply 2-3 sprays at 7-10 day intervals, especially when symptoms appear.

### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** "Hollow stem" (pith breakdown in the stem), browning of the curd (internal and external), water-soaked areas in the curd, stunted growth, and brittle leaves. This is often referred to as "brown rot" or "internal browning" of the curd.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Borax** (10.5% B) @ 4-6 kg/acre or **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (20.5% B) @ 2-3 kg/acre, mixed with soil during land preparation or at transplanting.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Spray with **Borax** @ 1.5-2 g/L water or **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** @ 1-1.5 g/L water. Apply 2-3 sprays, with the first spray at the head initiation stage, and subsequent sprays at 10-15 day intervals.

### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** "Tip burn" of young leaves (margins of young leaves turn brown and die), stunted growth, poor curd development, and increased susceptibility to soft rot.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** If soil test indicates low calcium, apply **Gypsum** (Calcium sulphate) @ 200-400 kg/acre (especially beneficial in sodic/alkaline soils) or **Calcium nitrate** @ 10-15 kg/acre.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Spray with **Calcium chloride** @ 5-7 g/L water or **Calcium nitrate** @ 5-10 g/L water. Apply 2-3 sprays, starting from curd initiation, at 7-10 day intervals.

### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, starting from the leaf margins and progressing inwards, often leaving a green "Christmas tree" pattern. Leaves may become brittle and sometimes develop a purplish tint.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Magnesium sulphate** @ 10-15 kg/acre during land preparation or as a side-dressing.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Spray with **Magnesium sulphate** @ 5-10 g/L water. Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, especially when symptoms appear.

### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, similar to iron deficiency but often accompanied by small necrotic (dead) spots. Leaves may appear mottled or speckled.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Manganese sulphate** @ 10-15 kg/acre during land preparation.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Spray with **Manganese sulphate** @ 2.5-5 g/L water. Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, particularly when symptoms are observed.

Always consult your local agricultural extension office or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's soil conditions and crop stage.
