Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist from HAU, Hisar, I understand the challenges posed by soil pests like termites and root-knot nematodes in cauliflower cultivation. These pests can significantly reduce yield and plant vigour if not managed effectively. Here's a scientifically verified approach for their control:

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Principles for Soil Pests:**
A holistic approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods is most effective and sustainable for managing soil pests.

**1. Control of Termites (Deemak):**
Termites feed on the roots and stem base, leading to wilting and eventual death of plants.

*   **Cultural and Mechanical Methods:**
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove all crop residues, stubble, and woody debris from the field before planting, as these can serve as food sources for termites.
    *   **Deep Ploughing:** Exposes termite colonies to predators and desiccation, especially during hot summer months.
    *   **Proper Irrigation:** Avoid water stress, as stressed plants are more susceptible to termite attack.
    *   **Farmyard Manure (FYM):** Ensure well-decomposed FYM is used, as undecomposed organic matter can attract termites.

*   **Chemical Control (Pre-planting/Soil Application):**
    *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC:** Apply 2.5 litres per acre mixed with 200-400 litres of water as a drench in the soil or incorporate into the soil before transplanting.
    *   **Fipronil 0.3% GR:** Apply 10-15 kg per acre by broadcasting and incorporating into the soil before transplanting.

**2. Control of Root-Knot Nematodes (Jad Ganth Krumi):**
Root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.) cause galls or knots on roots, impairing nutrient and water uptake, leading to stunted growth, yellowing, and reduced yield.

*   **Cultural and Mechanical Methods:**
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate cauliflower with non-host crops like marigold (Tagetes spp.), maize, sorghum, or other cereals for at least 2-3 years. Marigold is particularly effective as a trap crop.
    *   **Summer Ploughing/Solarization:** Deep ploughing during summer exposes nematode eggs and larvae to heat and desiccation. Soil solarization (covering moist soil with clear polyethylene sheets during hot months) can significantly reduce nematode populations.
    *   **Use of Healthy Seedlings:** Ensure that seedlings are free from nematode infestation.
    *   **Organic Matter Incorporation:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM), compost, or neem cake (200-400 kg/acre) into the soil. Neem cake has nematicidal properties.

*   **Biological Control:**
    *   **Bio-nematicides:** Apply formulations of *Paecilomyces lilacinus* or *Purpureocillium lilacinum* (e.g., 2.5 kg/acre) or *Trichoderma harzianum* (e.g., 2.5 kg/acre) mixed with FYM or compost and incorporated into the soil before planting. These fungi parasitize nematode eggs and larvae.

*   **Chemical Control (Pre-planting/At Planting Soil Application):**
    *   **Fluensulfone 2% GR:** Apply 20-25 kg per acre by broadcasting and incorporating into the soil before transplanting, or apply in furrows at the time of planting.
    *   **Cadusafos 10% GR:** Apply 10 kg per acre in furrows at the time of planting.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully, including dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions.

By adopting these integrated strategies, you can effectively manage soil pests and ensure a healthy and productive cauliflower crop.

Jai Kisan!
