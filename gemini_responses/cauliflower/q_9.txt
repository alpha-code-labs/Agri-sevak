Mites, including Red Spider Mite (Tetranychus urticae) and various Rust Mites (Eriophyidae family), are significant pests of Cauliflower in Haryana, especially during dry and warm periods. They can cause considerable damage, leading to reduced yield and quality.

**Symptoms of Mite Infestation:**
*   **Red Spider Mite:** Tiny, reddish-brown mites visible on the underside of leaves. Initial symptoms include yellow or white speckles on the upper leaf surface. As infestation progresses, leaves turn bronze or yellow, become brittle, and may drop prematurely. Fine webbing can be observed on the underside of leaves and between plant parts in severe cases.
*   **Rust Mite:** These mites are microscopic and not visible to the naked eye. Their feeding causes bronzing, russeting, or purpling of leaves, especially on the undersides. Leaves may become leathery, distorted, or stunted.

**Control Measures for Mites in Cauliflower:**

An Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is recommended for effective and sustainable mite control.

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Regular Monitoring:** Inspect the underside of leaves regularly, especially during dry weather, to detect mite infestations early.
*   **Water Management:** Overhead irrigation or strong water sprays can help dislodge mites and reduce their populations. Ensure adequate soil moisture to reduce plant stress, which can make plants more susceptible to mites.
*   **Weed Control:** Remove weeds around the field as they can act as alternate hosts for mites.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation to break the pest cycle.

**2. Biological Control:**
*   Naturally occurring predatory mites (e.g., Amblyseius spp.) and insects (e.g., ladybird beetles, lacewings) can help suppress mite populations. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

**3. Chemical Control (Acaricides):**
When mite populations reach damaging levels, chemical control using CIBRC approved acaricides is necessary. Always rotate chemicals with different modes of action to prevent resistance development. Apply sprays thoroughly, ensuring good coverage on the underside of leaves where mites primarily reside.

**Recommended CIBRC Approved Acaricides for Mites in Cauliflower:**

*   **Spiromesifen** (22.9% SC): Apply at 0.5 - 0.75 ml per litre of water.
*   **Fenpyroximate** (5% SC): Apply at 1.0 - 1.5 ml per litre of water.
*   **Propargite** (57% EC): Apply at 1.5 - 2.0 ml per litre of water.
*   **Abamectin** (1.8% EC): Apply at 0.5 ml per litre of water.
*   **Sulphur** (80% WP): Apply at 2.0 - 3.0 g per litre of water. (Effective against rust mites and also helps control powdery mildew).
*   **Pyridaben** (10% WP): Apply at 1.0 g per litre of water.
*   **Fenazaquin** (10% EC): Apply at 1.0 - 1.5 ml per litre of water.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label for specific dosages, application methods, pre-harvest intervals (PHI), and safety precautions.
*   Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and application.
*   Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves.
*   Rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in mite populations.
*   Avoid spraying during hot periods of the day, especially with Sulphur, to prevent phytotoxicity.
