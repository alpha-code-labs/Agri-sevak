As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I advise on addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium) in Cauliflower based on scientific principles and practices suitable for Haryana.

**General Recommendations:**
Before applying any corrective measures, it is highly recommended to conduct a soil test to accurately determine the nutrient status of your field. This will help in precise application and prevent over-fertilization. Visual symptoms are indicators, but soil testing provides definitive data.

### Addressing Nitrogen (N) Deficiency in Cauliflower

**Symptoms:**
*   General yellowing of older leaves, starting from the tips and progressing inwards.
*   Stunted plant growth with small, pale green leaves.
*   Reduced curd size and delayed maturity.

**Corrective Measures:**
*   **Soil Application:**
    *   For established plants showing deficiency, apply 20-30 kg Nitrogen per acre as a top-dressing. This can be achieved by applying:
        *   **45-65 kg Urea** per acre.
        *   **70-100 kg Calcium Ammonium Nitrate** per acre.
        *   **100-150 kg Ammonium Sulphate** per acre.
    *   Ensure the fertilizer is broadcast evenly and lightly incorporated into the soil, followed by irrigation.
*   **Foliar Application (for quick recovery or mild deficiency):**
    *   Spray a 1-2% solution of **Urea**.
    *   Mix **10-20 g Urea** per litre of water.
    *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 7-10 day intervals, preferably in the morning or late afternoon.

### Addressing Phosphorus (P) Deficiency in Cauliflower

**Symptoms:**
*   Leaves, especially older ones, may develop a purplish discoloration on the undersides.
*   Stunted growth with dark green to bluish-green leaves.
*   Poor root development and delayed maturity.
*   Small, poorly developed curds.

**Corrective Measures:**
*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Phosphorus is less mobile in the soil, so soil application is generally more effective than foliar for significant deficiencies. Apply 20-30 kg P2O5 per acre. This can be achieved by applying:
        *   **45-65 kg Di-ammonium Phosphate** per acre.
        *   **125-188 kg Single Superphosphate** per acre.
    *   Incorporate the fertilizer into the soil near the root zone, followed by irrigation.
*   **Foliar Application (for very mild deficiency or as a supplement):**
    *   A 0.5-1% solution of **Monoammonium Phosphate** can be used.
    *   Mix **5-10 g Monoammonium Phosphate** per litre of water.
    *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 7-10 day intervals.

### Addressing Potassium (K) Deficiency in Cauliflower

**Symptoms:**
*   Yellowing and scorching (browning) of leaf margins, particularly on older leaves.
*   Leaves may appear dull and sometimes crinkled.
*   Weak stems and reduced plant vigor.
*   Poor curd quality, often soft and prone to bruising.

**Corrective Measures:**
*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply 20-30 kg K2O per acre as a top-dressing. This can be achieved by applying:
        *   **35-50 kg Potassium Chloride** (Muriate of Potash) per acre.
        *   **40-60 kg Potassium Sulphate** (Sulphate of Potash) per acre.
    *   Broadcast evenly and incorporate into the soil, followed by irrigation.
*   **Foliar Application (for quick response or mild deficiency):**
    *   Spray a 0.5-1% solution of **Potassium Nitrate** or **Potassium Sulphate**.
    *   Mix **5-10 g Potassium Nitrate** per litre of water.
    *   Mix **5-10 g Potassium Sulphate** per litre of water.
    *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 7-10 day intervals.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Timing:** Apply corrective fertilizers when deficiency symptoms are first observed for best results.
*   **Irrigation:** Always ensure adequate moisture in the soil after fertilizer application to facilitate nutrient uptake and prevent root burn.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** While addressing specific deficiencies, remember the importance of a balanced nutrient program to support overall plant health and yield.
*   **Organic Matter:** Incorporating organic matter (farmyard manure, compost) improves soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability over time.
