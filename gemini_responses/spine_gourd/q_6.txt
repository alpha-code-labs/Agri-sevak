Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I understand your concern regarding viral diseases in Spine Gourd (Momordica dioica). Viral diseases can significantly impact yield and quality. It's crucial to understand that there are no direct chemical cures for viral diseases once a plant is infected. Management focuses primarily on preventing infection by controlling the vectors that transmit these viruses and implementing sound cultural practices.

Let's address the specific conditions you've mentioned:

1.  **Tristeza:**
    This is not known to affect Spine Gourd. Citrus Tristeza Virus (CTV) primarily affects citrus species.

2.  **Leaf curl, Mosaic, Yellow vein clearing, Stripe, and Stunt virus:**
    These are common viral disease symptoms or types that can affect Spine Gourd and other cucurbits in Haryana. They are typically transmitted by insect vectors like whiteflies and aphids.

    **Integrated Management Strategy for Viral Diseases in Spine Gourd:**

    The most effective approach is an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategy focusing on vector control and cultural practices.

    **A. Vector Management (Controlling the insects that spread the viruses):**

    *   **For Whiteflies (Vectors of Leaf Curl and Yellow Vein Clearing Viruses):**
        *   **Foliar Spray:**
            *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** 0.5 - 1 ml per litre of water.
            *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** 0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water.
            *   **Flonicamid 50% WG:** 0.3 g per litre of water.
            *   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** 0.5 - 0.7 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Soil Drench (for systemic action, especially in early stages):**
            *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** 250 - 300 ml per acre.
            *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** 100 - 200 g per acre.

    *   **For Aphids (Vectors of Mosaic and Stunt Viruses):**
        *   **Foliar Spray:**
            *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** 0.5 - 1 ml per litre of water.
            *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** 0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water.
            *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** 0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water.
            *   **Pymetrozine 50% WG:** 0.4 g per litre of water.
            *   **Flonicamid 50% WG:** 0.3 g per litre of water.

    **B. Cultural and Agronomic Practices:**

    *   **Use Healthy Planting Material:** Always start with seeds or seedlings from a reputable source, ensuring they are disease-free.
    *   **Rogueing:** Immediately remove and destroy (bury or burn) any plants showing symptoms of viral infection. This prevents the virus from spreading to healthy plants.
    *   **Weed Management:** Many weeds act as alternate hosts for both viruses and their insect vectors. Keep the field and surrounding areas free of weeds.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy crop residues after harvest to eliminate potential sources of inoculum and vectors.
    *   **Nursery Protection:** If raising seedlings, protect them from insect vectors using insect-proof nets (50-mesh) or by regular spraying of recommended insecticides.
    *   **Mulching:** Use silver or reflective plastic mulches between rows. These mulches can deter whiteflies and aphids, reducing their landing on plants.
    *   **Barrier Crops:** Planting non-host crops (e.g., maize, sorghum) around the Spine Gourd field can act as a physical barrier, reducing the movement of vectors into the main crop.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure balanced fertilization to promote strong, healthy plant growth, which can sometimes help plants tolerate stress better. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can make plants more attractive to sucking pests.
    *   **Timely Sowing:** Adjust planting dates to avoid periods of high vector population activity, if possible.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-cucurbit crops to break the disease cycle.
    *   **Resistant Varieties:** If available and suitable for your region, choose Spine Gourd varieties known to have resistance or tolerance to common viral diseases.

    **Important Considerations:**
    *   Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in insect populations.
    *   Follow the manufacturer's instructions for dosage, application method, and safety precautions for all chemical sprays.
    *   Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where vectors often reside.

By adopting these integrated measures, you can effectively manage viral diseases in your Spine Gourd crop and minimize yield losses.
