Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm that both Red Spider Mite (Tetranychus urticae) and Rust Mite (Eriophyes cucurbitae or similar species) are significant pests of Spine Gourd (Momordica dioica) in our region, especially during dry and warm periods. Effective management requires an integrated approach.

Here's a scientifically verified approach to control these mites:

**I. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Principles:**

1.  **Regular Monitoring:** Frequently inspect the underside of leaves for mite presence, webbing (for red spider mites), and bronzing/rusting symptoms (for rust mites). Early detection is crucial.
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Maintain good field sanitation by removing weeds, which can act as alternate hosts for mites.
    *   Ensure proper irrigation, as water stress can exacerbate mite infestations. Overhead irrigation or strong water sprays can physically dislodge mites from plants, especially on the undersides of leaves.
    *   Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can promote lush growth that is more attractive to mites.
3.  **Biological Control:** Conserve natural enemies such as predatory mites (e.g., Amblyseius spp.), lacewings, and ladybird beetles, which prey on spider mites. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

**II. Chemical Control (Acaricides):**

When mite populations reach damaging levels, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Ensure thorough coverage, especially on the underside of leaves where mites reside.

Here are some CIBRC approved technical chemical names effective against mites in cucurbits, along with their recommended dosages:

*   **For Red Spider Mite and Rust Mite:**
    *   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** Apply at a rate of **0.6 ml per liter of water** (or 125 ml per acre). This acaricide is effective against all life stages of mites, including eggs and nymphs.
    *   **Fenpyroximate 5% SC:** Apply at a rate of **1.5 - 2.0 ml per liter of water** (or 300-400 ml per acre). It provides quick knockdown and good residual activity.
    *   **Propargite 57% EC:** Apply at a rate of **2.0 - 2.5 ml per liter of water** (or 1.0 - 1.25 liters per acre). This is a well-established acaricide effective against red spider mites.
    *   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP:** Apply at a rate of **4-5 grams per liter of water** (or 2.0 - 2.5 kg per acre). This is particularly effective against rust mites and also helps in controlling powdery mildew. It is best applied when temperatures are not excessively high (below 30°C) to avoid phytotoxicity.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Water Volume:** Ensure adequate spray volume (typically 200-250 liters per acre for field crops) to achieve complete coverage of the foliage, especially the undersides of leaves.
*   **Rotation:** To prevent resistance development, rotate between acaricides with different modes of action (e.g., Group 23, Group 10A, Group 12A, Group M02).
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, and protective clothing while handling and spraying chemicals. Follow the instructions and safety precautions mentioned on the product label.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Observe the specified pre-harvest interval for each chemical to ensure the produce is safe for consumption.

For specific recommendations tailored to your exact field conditions, it is always advisable to consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts.
