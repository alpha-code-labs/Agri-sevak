Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following fertilizer schedule for Spine Gourd (Parwal) in Haryana. Please note that these are general recommendations, and a **soil test is highly recommended** to determine the precise nutrient requirements for your specific field conditions.

**General NPK Recommendation for Spine Gourd:**
For optimal yield, a general recommendation for Spine Gourd is approximately 80 kg Nitrogen (N), 60 kg Phosphorus (P2O5), and 60 kg Potassium (K2O) per acre. Sulphur (S) is also beneficial, typically around 20 kg S per acre.

Here's how to achieve this using the specified fertilizers:

---

### **I. Basal Application (at the time of planting/sowing):**

Apply the full dose of Phosphorus, Potassium, and Sulphur, along with one-third of the total Nitrogen requirement.

*   **Phosphorus (P2O5):** 60 kg/acre
*   **Potassium (K2O):** 60 kg/acre
*   **Sulphur (S):** 20 kg/acre
*   **Nitrogen (N):** 27 kg/acre (1/3rd of 80 kg N)

To meet these requirements, apply the following per acre:

*   **Single Super Phosphate**: 375 kg/acre
    *   *(This provides approximately 60 kg P2O5 and 41 kg Sulphur, fulfilling the P and S requirements.)*
*   **Muriate of Potash**: 100 kg/acre
    *   *(This provides approximately 60 kg K2O, fulfilling the K requirement.)*
*   **Urea**: 59 kg/acre
    *   *(This provides approximately 27 kg N, fulfilling the 1/3rd N requirement for basal application.)*

---

### **II. Top Dressing (remaining Nitrogen):**

The remaining two-thirds of the Nitrogen (approximately 53 kg N/acre) should be applied in two equal splits as top dressing.

*   **First Split (25-30 days after planting):**
    *   **Urea**: 58 kg/acre
    *   *(This provides approximately 26.5 kg N.)*

*   **Second Split (at flowering/early fruiting stage):**
    *   **Urea**: 58 kg/acre
    *   *(This provides approximately 26.5 kg N.)*

### **III. Nano Fertilizers (as supplements):**

Nano fertilizers are designed for foliar application and act as supplements to conventional fertilizers, enhancing nutrient use efficiency. They are not meant to fully replace granular fertilizers.

*   **Nano-Urea (Liquid)**:
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml/L of water for foliar spray.
    *   **Application:** 2-3 sprays can be given during the vegetative growth and reproductive stages (e.g., 30-40 days after planting, and again at flowering/fruiting).

*   **Nano-DAP (Liquid)**:
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml/L of water for foliar spray.
    *   **Application:** 1-2 sprays can be given during early vegetative growth (e.g., 20-30 days after planting).

### **IV. NPK Complex Fertilizers:**

If you prefer using NPK complex fertilizers, they can be used to meet a part of the basal NPK requirement. However, you will need to calculate the remaining nutrient deficit and supplement with other fertilizers.

*   For example, if using **NPK (12:32:16)**:
    *   You would need approximately 188 kg of **NPK (12:32:16)** per acre to meet the 60 kg P2O5 requirement. This would provide 22.5 kg N and 30 kg K2O.
    *   You would then need to supplement with additional **Urea** (approx. 10 kg/acre for N) and **Muriate of Potash** (approx. 50 kg/acre for K2O), along with **Single Super Phosphate** for Sulphur if not already covered.
    *   *Due to the variability in NPK grades and the need for precise balancing, it is often simpler to follow the elemental approach outlined above using Urea, SSP, and MOP.*

### **V. Diammonium Phosphate (DAP):**

**Diammonium Phosphate** (DAP) contains 18% N and 46% P2O5. If you choose to use DAP for Phosphorus, it will also contribute Nitrogen.

*   To provide 60 kg P2O5, you would need approximately 130 kg of **Diammonium Phosphate** per acre.
*   This would simultaneously provide approximately 23.4 kg N.
*   In this scenario, you would adjust your **Urea** application accordingly to meet the remaining N requirement and still need to apply **Muriate of Potash** for K and **Single Super Phosphate** (or elemental Sulphur) for S.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Soil pH:** Ensure your soil pH is suitable for Spine Gourd (ideally 6.0-7.0).
*   **Organic Manure:** Incorporating 10-15 tonnes of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost per acre during land preparation significantly improves soil health and nutrient availability, reducing the need for chemical fertilizers.
*   **Irrigation:** Ensure adequate and timely irrigation, especially during flowering and fruiting, as nutrient uptake is dependent on soil moisture.

Always consult with your local agricultural extension officer for specific advice tailored to your farm.
