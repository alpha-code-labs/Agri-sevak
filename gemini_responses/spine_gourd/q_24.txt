As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for the ideal transplantation time, distance, and process for Spine Gourd (Momordica dioica) in Haryana:

Spine Gourd is a perennial, dioecious cucurbit primarily propagated through root tubers or stem cuttings, and less commonly by seeds.

### Ideal Transplantation Time

The optimal time for planting Spine Gourd in Haryana to ensure good establishment and yield is:

*   **February - March:** For an early crop, allowing plants to establish before the peak summer and yield during the monsoon.
*   **June - July:** With the onset of the monsoon, which is ideal for establishment due to sufficient moisture and moderate temperatures. This is the most common planting period.

### Ideal Transplantation Distance

Spine Gourd is a vining crop that requires support (trellis or pandal system). The recommended spacing ensures proper growth, air circulation, and ease of management:

*   **Row-to-Row Distance:** 2.0 - 2.5 meters
*   **Plant-to-Plant Distance:** 0.5 - 1.0 meter

This spacing typically results in a plant density of approximately 4,000 - 10,000 plants per acre, depending on the exact spacing chosen.

### Transplantation Process

1.  **Field Preparation:**
    *   Plough the field thoroughly to a fine tilth.
    *   Incorporate 10-15 tonnes of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost per acre during the last ploughing.
    *   Level the field to ensure uniform irrigation and drainage.

2.  **Pit/Furrow Preparation:**
    *   Dig pits of approximately 30 cm x 30 cm x 30 cm size at the recommended spacing (2.0-2.5 m between rows and 0.5-1.0 m between plants).
    *   Alternatively, prepare furrows at the recommended row spacing.
    *   Fill the pits/furrows with a mixture of topsoil, sand, and well-decomposed FYM (e.g., 1:1:1 ratio).

3.  **Selection of Planting Material:**
    *   **Root Tubers:** Select healthy, disease-free root tubers (rhizomes) weighing 20-30 grams each, preferably with an eye bud. Ensure you have a mix of male and female tubers.
    *   **Stem Cuttings:** Use semi-hardwood cuttings of 15-20 cm length with 2-3 nodes, taken from healthy mother plants. These are often rooted in polybags before transplanting.
    *   **Seedlings (if raised):** If using seedlings raised in nursery bags or trays, ensure they are 3-4 weeks old and hardened off before transplanting.

4.  **Transplanting:**
    *   **For Root Tubers/Cuttings:** Place one tuber or rooted cutting per pit/hill, ensuring the eye bud (if present on tuber) faces upwards. Cover lightly with soil.
    *   **For Seedlings:** Carefully remove the seedling from the nursery bag/tray with the root ball intact to minimize root disturbance. Plant it in the center of the prepared pit/hill.
    *   Ensure the planting depth is such that the top of the root ball (for seedlings) or the top of the tuber is just below the soil surface.

5.  **Sex Ratio Management (Crucial for Spine Gourd):**
    *   Spine Gourd is dioecious (male and female flowers on separate plants). For successful fruit set, ensure adequate male plants for pollination.
    *   A general recommendation is to plant 1 male plant for every 10-15 female plants. If planting tubers, it is essential to identify and plant male and female tubers in the correct ratio. If sex cannot be determined from tubers, plant extra and remove excess males later.

6.  **Immediate Post-Transplantation Care:**
    *   **Watering:** Immediately after transplanting, provide light irrigation to settle the soil around the roots.
    *   **Support System:** Plan for the installation of a trellis or pandal system as the plants begin to vine. This should ideally be in place within 2-3 weeks of planting.

Following these guidelines will help establish a healthy and productive Spine Gourd crop in Haryana.
