As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling sucking pests in Spine Gourd (Momordica dioica) in Haryana.

**Regarding Psylla:**
This is not known to affect Spine Gourd. Psyllids are generally host-specific and are not considered a significant pest of Spine Gourd in our region.

For the control of other sucking pests like Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips, an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is highly recommended for sustainable and effective management.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategy:**

**1. Cultural Control Measures:**
*   **Regular Field Monitoring:** Frequently inspect plants, especially the undersides of leaves and growing tips, to detect pest infestations early.
*   **Weed Management:** Remove weeds from and around the field, as they can serve as alternate hosts for these pests.
*   **Yellow Sticky Traps:** Install yellow sticky traps (10-15 traps per acre) to monitor and trap adult whiteflies, leafhoppers, and thrips.
*   **Proper Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush, succulent growth that is more attractive to sucking pests.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation to break pest cycles.
*   **Removal of Infested Plants:** Promptly remove and destroy severely infested plant parts or entire plants to prevent further spread.

**2. Biological Control Measures:**
*   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Protect and encourage natural predators like ladybird beetles, lacewings, hoverfly larvae, and parasitic wasps (e.g., *Encarsia formosa* for whiteflies), which naturally prey on these sucking pests. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.
*   **Biopesticides:** Consider using neem-based formulations (e.g., Azadirachtin 1500 ppm or 3000 ppm) at early stages of infestation. Apply 3-5 ml/L of water.

**3. Chemical Control Measures:**
When pest populations reach economic threshold levels and cultural/biological methods are insufficient, judicious use of CIBRC-approved insecticides is necessary. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

*   **For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips:**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at 0.5-0.75 ml/L of water.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at 0.2-0.3 g/L of water.
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply at 0.2-0.3 g/L of water.
    *   **Fipronil 5% SC:** Apply at 1.5-2.0 ml/L of water.

*   **Specifically for Whiteflies (especially nymphs) and Thrips:**
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at 1.25-1.5 ml/L of water (effective against nymphs, acts as an insect growth regulator).
    *   **Diafenthiuron 50% WP:** Apply at 1.0-1.2 g/L of water (also effective against mites).
    *   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** Apply at 0.75-1.0 ml/L of water (effective against whiteflies and mites).

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Spray Coverage:** Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where many sucking pests reside.
*   **Rotation:** Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Strictly observe the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) mentioned on the product label before harvesting.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying. Follow all safety instructions and disposal guidelines on the product label.
*   **Consult Experts:** For specific recommendations based on the severity of infestation and local conditions, farmers are advised to consult with agricultural extension officers or HAU experts.
