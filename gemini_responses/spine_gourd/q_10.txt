As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for managing pests in Spine Gourd in Haryana.

Effective pest management in Spine Gourd relies on an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, mechanical, biological, and judicious chemical control methods.

**General Management Practices (IPM):**

*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infested plant parts, fallen fruits, and crop residues to reduce pest populations.
*   **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect plants for pest incidence, especially on young shoots, flowers, and developing fruits.
*   **Mechanical Control:** Hand-pick and destroy visible caterpillars and borers in the early stages of infestation.
*   **Pheromone Traps:** For fruit flies (a major borer), install cucurbit fruit fly pheromone traps at 4-5 traps per acre to monitor and mass trap male flies.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation to break the pest life cycle.
*   **Timely Sowing:** Adhere to recommended sowing times to avoid peak pest periods.

**Specific Pest Management:**

### Borers (Fruit Borers, Shoot Borers) and Caterpillars (including Leaf Folder)

These pests, primarily lepidopteran larvae, cause damage by boring into fruits, shoots, or feeding on leaves, sometimes folding them. The following CIBRC approved insecticides are effective:

*   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC: Apply at 60 ml per acre.
*   **Flubendiamide** 20% WG: Apply at 50 g per acre.
*   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG: Apply at 80-100 g per acre.
*   **Indoxacarb** 14.5% SC: Apply at 200 ml per acre.
*   **Spinosad** 45% SC: Apply at 64 ml per acre.
*   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: Apply at 200-250 ml per acre (also effective against fruit flies).

**Note:** For effective spray coverage, ensure adequate water volume, typically 200-400 litres per acre, depending on crop canopy. Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

### Diamondback Moth (*Plutella xylostella*)

This is not known to affect Spine Gourd. Diamondback moth is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower, mustard).

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label, including dosage, application method, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of pesticides.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension officers for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and current pest pressure.
