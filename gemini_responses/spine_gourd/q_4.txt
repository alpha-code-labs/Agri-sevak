Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I understand your concern regarding Wilt and Parawilt in Spine Gourd. These conditions can significantly impact yield. It's important to distinguish between true wilts (caused by pathogens) and parawilt (often physiological), though management strategies often overlap.

Here's a comprehensive approach to control Wilt (including Parawilt) in Spine Gourd:

**I. General Management Principles (Applicable to all forms of Wilt and Parawilt):**

1.  **Crop Rotation:**
    *   Practice a long crop rotation (at least 3-4 years) with non-cucurbit crops like cereals (wheat, maize) or pulses. This helps to reduce the build-up of soil-borne pathogens.
2.  **Resistant Varieties and Grafting:**
    *   Where available, use wilt-resistant Spine Gourd varieties recommended for Haryana.
    *   Grafting Spine Gourd onto resistant rootstocks (e.g., specific bottle gourd or pumpkin varieties) is a highly effective method to manage soil-borne wilts.
3.  **Soil Health Management:**
    *   **Improve Soil Drainage:** Ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging, which favors many wilt pathogens. Raised beds can be beneficial.
    *   **Increase Organic Matter:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost to improve soil structure, water holding capacity, and microbial activity, which can suppress pathogens.
    *   **Soil Solarization:** During hot summer months, cover moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks. This raises soil temperature and helps to kill soil-borne pathogens and nematodes.
4.  **Water Management:**
    *   Provide consistent and adequate moisture. Avoid both water stress (drought) and over-irrigation, as both can predispose plants to wilt or exacerbate parawilt. Drip irrigation is highly recommended.
5.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Ensure balanced nutrition. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can promote lush growth susceptible to disease. Adequate potassium and micronutrients improve plant vigor and resistance.
6.  **Sanitation:**
    *   Remove and destroy infected plant debris promptly to prevent the spread of pathogens.
    *   Clean farm tools and equipment to avoid pathogen transmission.

**II. Specific Management for Fungal Wilt (e.g., Fusarium Wilt):**

Fungal wilts are caused by soil-borne fungi like *Fusarium oxysporum*.

1.  **Seed Treatment:**
    *   Treat seeds before sowing with a fungicide to protect seedlings from early infection.
        *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP @ 2 g/kg seed
        *   **Thiram** 75% WS @ 2-3 g/kg seed
2.  **Biological Control (Soil Application):**
    *   Apply beneficial microbial antagonists to the soil.
        *   **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum** @ 2.5 kg/acre mixed with 50 kg of well-decomposed FYM or compost. Apply at the time of planting or as a soil drench.
        *   **Pseudomonas fluorescens** @ 2.5 kg/acre mixed with 50 kg of well-decomposed FYM or compost.
3.  **Chemical Control (Soil Drench):**
    *   For established plants showing early symptoms, a soil drench can be applied.
        *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP @ 1-2 g/L of water, drench around the base of the affected plants.

**III. Specific Management for Bacterial Wilt (e.g., Ralstonia solanacearum):**

Bacterial wilts are more challenging to control with chemicals once established. Emphasis is on prevention.

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Strict adherence to crop rotation, resistant varieties/grafting, and sanitation is paramount.
    *   Avoid planting in fields with a history of bacterial wilt.
2.  **Soil pH Management:**
    *   Maintain soil pH between 6.0-7.0, as *Ralstonia* often thrives in acidic soils.
3.  **Nematode Management:**
    *   Nematode damage can create entry points for bacterial wilt pathogens. If nematodes are a problem, integrate their management into your strategy.

**IV. Management for Parawilt (Physiological Wilt):**

Parawilt is often a non-pathogenic condition caused by environmental stress or root damage.

1.  **Optimize Environmental Conditions:**
    *   Ensure consistent soil moisture, avoiding extremes of drought or waterlogging.
    *   Protect roots from mechanical damage during weeding or intercultural operations.
    *   Manage soil temperature through mulching, especially during hot periods.
2.  **Address Nutrient Deficiencies/Toxicities:**
    *   Conduct soil testing to identify any nutrient imbalances. Correct deficiencies or toxicities as recommended.
3.  **Improve Root Health:**
    *   Promote a healthy root system through good soil aeration, organic matter, and proper irrigation.

By implementing these integrated management strategies, you can effectively control wilt and parawilt in your Spine Gourd crop. For specific product recommendations and dosages, always consult your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts.
