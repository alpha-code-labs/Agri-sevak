Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding the various rot diseases in Spine Gourd (Momordica dioica). These rots are indeed a significant threat and can severely impact yield and plant health. The good news is that an integrated approach can effectively manage them.

All the rot types you've mentioned – Root, Stem, Foot, Collar, Crown, Neck, Black, Fruit, Seed, and Seedling rot – are known to affect Spine Gourd and are primarily caused by a complex of soil-borne and foliar fungal pathogens such as *Pythium spp.*, *Phytophthora spp.*, *Rhizoctonia solani*, *Fusarium spp.*, *Sclerotium rolfsii*, and *Didymella bryoniae* (for Black Rot/Gummy Stem Blight).

Here's a comprehensive strategy for their control:

### Integrated Disease Management (IDM) for Rot Diseases in Spine Gourd

An IDM approach combines cultural, biological, and chemical methods for sustainable and effective disease control.

#### 1. Cultural and Agronomic Practices (Prevention is Key)

These practices are fundamental in preventing the onset and spread of rot diseases:

*   **Site Selection and Soil Preparation:** Choose well-drained fields. Prepare raised beds to improve drainage and prevent waterlogging around the plant base, which is crucial for preventing root, foot, collar, and stem rots.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting Spine Gourd or other cucurbits in the same field for at least 2-3 years. Rotate with non-host crops like cereals (wheat, maize) or pulses.
*   **Sanitation:** Promptly remove and destroy infected plant debris (leaves, stems, fruits) from the field to reduce inoculum sources.
*   **Water Management:** Practice judicious irrigation. Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day, which can keep foliage wet and promote fungal growth. Drip irrigation is highly recommended as it delivers water directly to the root zone, keeping the rest of the plant dry and minimizing soil splash. Avoid overwatering.
*   **Planting Density:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to promote good air circulation, which helps in drying foliage and reducing humidity around the plants, thereby discouraging fruit and stem rots.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced fertilization. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can lead to lush, succulent growth more susceptible to disease.
*   **Soil Solarization:** In summer, cover moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks to raise soil temperatures and kill soil-borne pathogens, effective against root, stem, and seedling rots.

#### 2. Biological Control

*   **Seed Treatment/Soil Application:**
    *   Apply *Trichoderma viride* (1% WP) @ 5-10 kg/acre mixed with 100 kg farmyard manure (FYM) and broadcast before planting, or @ 4 g/kg seed as seed treatment.
    *   Apply *Pseudomonas fluorescens* (1% WP) @ 5-10 kg/acre mixed with 100 kg FYM and broadcast before planting, or @ 10 g/kg seed as seed treatment.
    These bio-agents colonize the root zone and suppress pathogenic fungi.

#### 3. Chemical Control (Targeted Application)

Chemical control should be used judiciously and as per CIBRC guidelines. Always read the label for specific instructions and safety precautions.

**A. For Seed Rot & Seedling Rot (Seed Treatment):**
To protect seeds from rotting in the soil and young seedlings from damping-off and early blight:

*   **Captan** (75% WS) @ 2.5-3.0 g/kg seed
*   **Thiram** (75% WS) @ 2.5-3.0 g/kg seed
*   **Carbendazim** (50% WP) @ 1.0-1.5 g/kg seed
*   **Metalaxyl** (35% WS) @ 6 g/kg seed (specifically effective against *Pythium* causing damping-off)

**B. For Root Rot, Stem Rot, Foot Rot, Collar Rot, Crown Rot, Neck Rot (Soil Drench/Drip Application):**
These applications target soil-borne pathogens affecting the plant base and root system. Apply at the first sign of disease or preventively in disease-prone areas.

*   **Propamocarb hydrochloride** (72.2% SL) @ 2.5 ml/L water (drench 200-250 ml solution around the base of each plant).
*   **Metalaxyl** (8% WG) + **Mancozeb** (64% WG) @ 2.0-2.5 g/L water (drench 200-250 ml solution around the base of each plant).
*   **Fosetyl-aluminium** (80% WP) @ 2.5 g/L water (drench 200-250 ml solution around the base of each plant).
*   **Carbendazim** (50% WP) @ 1.0-1.5 g/L water (drench 200-250 ml solution around the base of each plant, effective against *Fusarium* and *Rhizoctonia*).
*   **Thiophenate methyl** (70% WP) @ 1.0-1.5 g/L water (drench 200-250 ml solution around the base of each plant).

**C. For Black Rot & Fruit Rot (Foliar Spray):**
These sprays protect foliage, stems, and fruits from aerial infections. Apply preventively or at the first appearance of symptoms, repeating as per label instructions.

*   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC) @ 0.5-1.0 ml/L water.
*   **Difenoconazole** (25% EC) @ 0.5 ml/L water.
*   **Tebuconazole** (25.9% EC) @ 0.75 ml/L water.
*   **Mancozeb** (75% WP) @ 2.0-2.5 g/L water (broad-spectrum protective fungicide).
*   **Chlorothalonil** (75% WP) @ 2.0 g/L water.
*   For *Phytophthora* fruit rot: **Metalaxyl** (8% WG) + **Mancozeb** (64% WG) @ 2.0-2.5 g/L water.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Fungicide Rotation:** To prevent the development of fungicide resistance, always rotate fungicides with different modes of action.
*   **Adherence to Label:** Strictly follow the instructions on the fungicide label regarding dosage, application timing, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and safety precautions.
*   **Local Consultation:** For the most current and specific recommendations tailored to your local conditions and prevailing disease pressure in Haryana, always consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts.

By implementing these integrated strategies, you can effectively manage and control various rot diseases in your Spine Gourd crop, ensuring healthy growth and good yields.
