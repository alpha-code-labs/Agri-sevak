Namaste, Kisan bhaiyon! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I understand the critical importance of balanced nutrition for healthy Spine Gourd cultivation. Addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium) is crucial for optimal yield and quality.

The first and most important step in addressing any nutrient deficiency is to conduct a **soil test**. This will provide precise information on the nutrient status of your field and allow for tailored recommendations. The following are general guidelines for addressing these deficiencies in Spine Gourd, assuming a deficiency has been identified through visual symptoms or soil testing:

### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   General yellowing (chlorosis) of older leaves, starting from the tips and margins.
*   Stunted plant growth with thin, weak stems.
*   Reduced fruit set and smaller fruits.

**Corrective Measures:**
Nitrogen is highly mobile in the soil and within the plant, so split applications are often recommended.

*   **Soil Application (Basal or Top-dressing):**
    *   **Urea** (46% N): Apply 20-30 kg/acre as a top-dressing, preferably in 2-3 split doses during the vegetative growth phase.
    *   **Ammonium Sulphate** (20.6% N): Apply 40-60 kg/acre, especially beneficial in alkaline soils.
    *   **Calcium Ammonium Nitrate** (25% N): Apply 30-50 kg/acre, also suitable for split applications.
*   **Foliar Spray (for quick recovery):**
    *   **Urea** (46% N): Dissolve 5-10 g/L of water (0.5-1% solution) and spray on the foliage during cooler parts of the day. Repeat after 7-10 days if symptoms persist.

### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   Dark green or purplish discoloration of older leaves, especially on the underside.
*   Stunted growth, poor root development, and delayed maturity.
*   Reduced flowering and fruit development.

**Corrective Measures:**
Phosphorus is relatively immobile in the soil, so it is best applied as a basal dose before planting or at the time of sowing.

*   **Soil Application (Basal):**
    *   **Calcium dihydrogen phosphate** (Single Super Phosphate - 16% P2O5): Apply 100-150 kg/acre.
    *   **Diammonium hydrogen phosphate** (Di-Ammonium Phosphate - 18% N, 46% P2O5): Apply 40-60 kg/acre. This also provides a significant amount of Nitrogen.

### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   Yellowing and scorching (browning) of leaf margins, particularly on older leaves, progressing inwards.
*   Weak stems, poor fruit development, and reduced fruit quality (size, taste, shelf life).
*   Increased susceptibility to diseases and drought stress.

**Corrective Measures:**
Potassium can be applied as a basal dose or as top-dressing in split applications.

*   **Soil Application (Basal or Top-dressing):**
    *   **Potassium Chloride** (Muriate of Potash - 60% K2O): Apply 30-50 kg/acre, preferably in split doses (half basal, half as top-dressing).
    *   **Potassium Sulphate** (Sulphate of Potash - 50% K2O): Apply 35-60 kg/acre, especially beneficial where sulfur is also deficient or in salt-sensitive conditions.
*   **Foliar Spray (for quick recovery/supplement):**
    *   **Potassium Nitrate** (13% N, 45% K2O): Dissolve 5-10 g/L of water (0.5-1% solution) and spray on the foliage. Repeat after 7-10 days if needed.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always ensure proper irrigation after applying fertilizers to the soil to facilitate nutrient uptake.
*   Foliar sprays are effective for quick correction but should be considered supplementary to soil application for long-term nutrient management.
*   Always follow the recommended dosage and application methods to avoid over-fertilization, which can harm plants and the environment.
