As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Spine Gourd (Momordica dioica) in Haryana.

Effective management of fungal diseases requires an integrated approach combining cultural practices and timely application of appropriate fungicides.

**General Cultural Practices for Fungal Disease Management:**

*   **Use Disease-Free Seeds:** Always source seeds from reputable suppliers to ensure they are free from pathogens.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting spine gourd or other cucurbits in the same field year after year. Rotate with non-host crops for at least 2-3 years.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris, weeds, and volunteer plants that can harbor pathogens.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Maintain adequate plant spacing to ensure good air circulation, which helps reduce humidity and fungal growth.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced fertilizers. Excessive nitrogen can lead to lush growth, making plants more susceptible to certain diseases.
*   **Irrigation Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day, as prolonged leaf wetness promotes fungal development. Drip irrigation is preferred.
*   **Pruning:** Remove old, diseased, or overcrowded leaves to improve air circulation and reduce inoculum.

Here's how to control the specific fungal diseases you've mentioned:

### Diseases Known to Affect Spine Gourd:

**1. Alternaria Leaf Spot/Blight (Caused by *Alternaria cucumerina*)**
Symptoms include small, circular, water-soaked spots that enlarge, become angular, and turn brown with concentric rings (target-spot appearance). Severe infection can lead to defoliation.

*   **Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
    *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Chlorothalonil** (75% WP) at 2 g/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC) at 1 ml/L of water.
    *   **Difenoconazole** (25% EC) at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Tebuconazole** (25.9% EC) at 0.75 ml/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin + Difenoconazole** (11% + 18.2% SC) at 1 ml/L of water.

**2. Anthracnose (Caused by *Colletotrichum orbiculare*)**
Symptoms appear on leaves as circular, water-soaked spots that turn brown to black and may fall out, creating a "shot-hole" effect. On fruits, sunken, circular, black lesions with pinkish spore masses are characteristic.

*   **Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
    *   **Carbendazim** (50% WP) at 1 g/L of water.
    *   **Thiophanate Methyl** (70% WP) at 1 g/L of water.
    *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Chlorothalonil** (75% WP) at 2 g/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC) at 1 ml/L of water.
    *   **Tebuconazole** (25.9% EC) at 0.75 ml/L of water.
    *   **Mancozeb + Carbendazim** (63% + 12% WP) at 2 g/L of water.

**3. Blight (General term, often referring to Alternaria Blight or Phytophthora Blight)**
In cucurbits, blight symptoms can be caused by various fungi. *Alternaria cucumerina* causes Alternaria blight (as described above). *Phytophthora capsici* can cause fruit rot and vine blight, especially under wet conditions.

*   **For Alternaria Blight:** Refer to the recommendations for Alternaria Leaf Spot/Blight above.
*   **For Phytophthora Blight/Fruit Rot (Oomycete):**
    *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Chlorothalonil** (75% WP) at 2 g/L of water.
    *   **Propamocarb Hydrochloride** (72.2% SL) at 2.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Dimethomorph** (50% WP) at 1 g/L of water.
    *   **Mancozeb + Metalaxyl** (64% + 8% WP) at 2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Fluopicolide + Propamocarb Hydrochloride** (4.44% + 44.4% SC) at 2.5 ml/L of water.

**4. Downy Mildew (Caused by *Pseudoperonospora cubensis*)**
Characterized by angular, yellow spots on the upper leaf surface, delimited by veins. On the underside, a purplish-grey, fuzzy growth (spores) can be seen, especially in humid conditions. Leads to rapid defoliation.

*   **Chemical Control (Fungicides - specific for Oomycetes):**
    *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2.5 g/L of water (protective).
    *   **Chlorothalonil** (75% WP) at 2 g/L of water (protective).
    *   **Propamocarb Hydrochloride** (72.2% SL) at 2.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Dimethomorph** (50% WP) at 1 g/L of water.
    *   **Fenamidone** (10% SC) at 1 ml/L of water.
    *   **Mancozeb + Metalaxyl** (64% + 8% WP) at 2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Mancozeb + Cymoxanil** (68% + 8% WP) at 2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Dimethomorph + Pyraclostrobin** (9% + 6% WG) at 1.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Fluopicolide + Propamocarb Hydrochloride** (4.44% + 44.4% SC) at 2.5 ml/L of water.

**5. Powdery Mildew (Caused by *Podosphaera xanthii* or *Erysiphe cichoracearum*)**
Appears as white, powdery patches on the upper and lower surfaces of leaves, stems, and sometimes fruits. Infected leaves may turn yellow, curl, and dry out.

*   **Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
    *   **Sulfur** (80% WP or 70% WDG) at 2-3 g/L of water (ensure good coverage, avoid application during very hot weather).
    *   **Myclobutanil** (10% WP) at 0.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Penconazole** (10% EC) at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Hexaconazole** (5% SC) at 1 ml/L of water.
    *   **Difenoconazole** (25% EC) at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC) at 1 ml/L of water.
    *   **Tebuconazole** (25.9% EC) at 0.75 ml/L of water.

**2. Brown spot:** This is not known to affect Spine Gourd as a specific, distinct disease. "Brown spot" is a general symptom that can be caused by various pathogens, but it's not a recognized primary disease of spine gourd.

**3. Grey mildew:** This is not known to affect Spine Gourd as a specific, distinct disease. While some fungi can cause greyish mold or powdery mildew with a greyish appearance, "Grey mildew" is not a standard disease name for spine gourd.

**Important Considerations for Fungicide Application:**

*   **Rotation:** Always rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in pathogens.
*   **Timing:** Apply fungicides preventively or at the very first sign of disease symptoms for best efficacy.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough coverage of all plant parts, especially the undersides of leaves.
*   **Adjuvants:** Consider using a spreading agent (sticker/spreader) to improve fungicide efficacy.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always observe the recommended Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) mentioned on the fungicide label to ensure the safety of the produce.
*   **Safety:** Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and application.

For specific recommendations tailored to your local conditions and current disease pressure, it is always advisable to consult with the plant pathology experts at HAU, Hisar, or your nearest Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK).
