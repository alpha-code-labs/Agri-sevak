As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing pests in Spine Gourd in Haryana.

Effective management of Beetles and Weevils in Spine Gourd requires timely identification and appropriate control measures.

### Control of Beetles and Weevils in Spine Gourd

Beetles (e.g., Red Pumpkin Beetle, Flea Beetles, Epilachna Beetles) and certain Weevils can cause significant damage by feeding on leaves, stems, flowers, and fruits of Spine Gourd.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Approach:**

1.  **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your crop for signs of pest activity, especially on young leaves and flowers.
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Maintain field sanitation by removing weeds and crop debris that can harbor pests.
    *   Timely sowing can help avoid peak pest populations.
    *   Use yellow sticky traps for monitoring adult beetle populations.
3.  **Chemical Control (when necessary):**
    When pest populations reach economic threshold levels, chemical intervention may be required. Always ensure thorough coverage of the plant, especially the undersides of leaves.

    For the control of Beetles and Weevils, consider the following CIBRC approved technical chemicals:

    *   **Malathion** 50% EC: Apply at a concentration of **1.0-1.5 ml/L** of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: Apply at a concentration of **0.5 ml/L** of water.
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC: Apply at a concentration of **0.3 ml/L** of water. This is particularly effective against chewing pests and some borers.

**Important Considerations for Chemical Application:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label, including dosage, application method, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
*   Apply insecticides during the cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   Ensure proper safety gear (gloves, mask, protective clothing) is used during handling and application of chemicals.

### Control of Sawflies in Spine Gourd

This is not known to affect Spine Gourd. Sawflies are primarily pests of cruciferous crops and some fruit trees, and are not typically reported as a significant pest of cucurbits like Spine Gourd in Haryana.
