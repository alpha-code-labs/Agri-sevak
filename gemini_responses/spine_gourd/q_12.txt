Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm that Scale insects and Mealybugs are significant sap-sucking pests that can severely affect Spine Gourd (Kundru) cultivation in Haryana. Effective management requires an integrated approach.

Here's how to control Scale insects and Mealybugs in Spine Gourd:

**I. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Principles:**

1.  **Regular Monitoring:** Frequently inspect your Spine Gourd plants, especially the undersides of leaves, stems, and fruit, for early signs of these pests. Look for sticky honeydew, sooty mold, and the pests themselves.
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy heavily infested plant parts (leaves, stems, branches) to reduce pest populations.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Keep the field free of weeds and plant debris, which can harbor pests.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, as it can lead to lush, succulent growth that is more attractive to sap-sucking pests.
3.  **Biological Control:** Conserve natural enemies such as ladybird beetles, lacewings, and parasitic wasps, which prey on or parasitize scale insects and mealybugs. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

**II. Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved Technical Chemicals):**

For effective chemical control, especially during moderate to severe infestations, it is crucial to use CIBRC approved technical chemicals. Ensure thorough coverage, particularly on the undersides of leaves and stems where these pests often hide. Always spray during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.

**Important Note:** Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance. Read the label carefully for specific instructions, safety precautions, and pre-harvest intervals (PHI).

Here are some recommended CIBRC approved technical chemicals:

*   **For Systemic Control (effective against hidden pests):**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Use at a concentration of **0.5 - 0.75 ml per litre of water**.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Use at a concentration of **0.2 - 0.3 g per litre of water**.
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Use at a concentration of **0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water**.
    *   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:** Use at a concentration of **0.75 - 1.0 ml per litre of water**. This is particularly effective against scales and mealybugs due to its dual-systemic action.

*   **For Insect Growth Regulation (effective against nymphs and preventing molting):**
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Use at a concentration of **1.25 - 1.5 ml per litre of water**. This is highly effective against nymphs of both scale insects and mealybugs by inhibiting chitin synthesis.

*   **For Contact Action (effective for direct hit and localized infestations):**
    *   **Malathion 50% EC:** Use at a concentration of **2.0 ml per litre of water**. This can be used for quick knockdown, especially if the infestation is accessible.

**Safety Precautions:**
*   Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, and protective clothing while handling and spraying pesticides.
*   Do not eat, drink, or smoke during application.
*   Wash hands and exposed skin thoroughly with soap and water after spraying.
*   Dispose of empty containers safely as per guidelines.

By combining these strategies, you can effectively manage Scale insects and Mealybugs in your Spine Gourd crop and ensure a healthy yield. For any further specific queries, please consult your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts.
