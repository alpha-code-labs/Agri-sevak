As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the suitable climate, soil type, and drainage requirements for Spine Gourd (Momordica dioica) in Haryana:

**Climate:**
Spine Gourd is a tropical to subtropical crop that thrives in warm and humid conditions.

*   **Temperature:** It prefers a temperature range of 25°C to 35°C for optimal growth and fruit development.
*   **Humidity:** High humidity is generally favorable.
*   **Frost:** It is highly sensitive to frost, which can severely damage the plants. Therefore, cultivation should avoid periods of frost.

**Soil Type:**
Spine Gourd can adapt to a variety of soil types but performs best in specific conditions.

*   **Texture:** Well-drained sandy loam to loamy soils are ideal. Heavy clay soils should be avoided due to poor drainage.
*   **Organic Matter:** Soils rich in organic matter are highly beneficial for vigorous growth and yield.
*   **pH:** A soil pH range of 6.0 to 7.0 (slightly acidic to neutral) is considered optimal.

**Drainage Requirement:**
Excellent drainage is paramount for successful Spine Gourd cultivation.

*   **Waterlogging:** The crop is highly susceptible to waterlogging, which can lead to root rot, wilting, and ultimately plant death.
*   **Soil Structure:** The soil must allow for rapid percolation of water, preventing standing water around the root zone. Raised beds are often recommended in areas prone to water accumulation to ensure adequate drainage.
