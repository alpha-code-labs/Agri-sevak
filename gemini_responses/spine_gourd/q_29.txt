As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding dropping issues in Spine Gourd. Flower and fruit drop can significantly reduce yields in this valuable crop.

Firstly, regarding "Tinda/Boll dropping":
*   **This is not known to affect Spine Gourd.** Spine Gourd (Momordica dioica) is a cucurbit vegetable and does not produce Tinda (Praecitrullus fistulosus) or Bolls (as in cotton). Therefore, this specific concern is not relevant to Spine Gourd cultivation.

Now, let's address the control of flower and fruit drop in Spine Gourd:

Flower and fruit drop in Spine Gourd are often multifactorial, stemming from environmental stress, nutritional imbalances, poor pollination, or physiological issues.

**Common Causes of Flower and Fruit Drop:**

1.  **Environmental Stress:**
    *   **High Temperatures:** Especially above 35-40°C during flowering and fruit set, which can lead to pollen sterility and poor fruit development.
    *   **Water Stress:** Both drought conditions and waterlogging can severely impact flower and fruit retention.
    *   **Low Humidity:** Can cause desiccation of flowers and young fruits.
    *   **Sudden Weather Changes:** Abrupt shifts in temperature or humidity.
2.  **Nutritional Deficiencies:**
    *   Lack of essential micronutrients like Boron and Calcium, and macronutrients like Phosphorus and Potassium.
3.  **Poor Pollination:**
    *   Insufficient pollinator activity (e.g., bees) due to adverse weather, lack of pollinators, or insecticide use during flowering.
    *   Non-viable pollen.
4.  **Physiological Imbalance:**
    *   Imbalance of plant hormones (e.g., high abscisic acid relative to auxins).
    *   Excessive vegetative growth at the expense of reproductive growth.
5.  **Pest and Disease Damage:**
    *   Sucking pests (e.g., thrips, mites) damaging flowers.
    *   Fruit borers attacking young fruits, leading to their abscission.

**Control Measures for Flower and Fruit Drop in Spine Gourd:**

A holistic approach combining good agronomic practices, balanced nutrition, and judicious use of plant growth regulators is recommended.

**1. Agronomic and Cultural Practices:**

*   **Water Management:** Maintain consistent soil moisture, especially during flowering and fruit development. Avoid both water stress (wilting) and waterlogging. Irrigate judiciously based on soil type and weather conditions.
*   **Pollination Enhancement:**
    *   Avoid spraying insecticides during peak flowering hours (typically morning) to protect natural pollinators like bees.
    *   Consider placing bee boxes in or near the field if natural pollinator activity is low.
*   **Weed Control:** Keep the field free of weeds to reduce competition for water, nutrients, and light.
*   **Optimal Plant Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to allow for good air circulation and light penetration, promoting healthy growth.

**2. Nutritional Management:**

*   **Balanced Fertilization:** Apply recommended doses of NPK based on soil test reports.
*   **Micronutrient Application:**
    *   **Boron:** Essential for pollen germination, pollen tube growth, and fruit set.
        *   Soil application: **Borax** (10.5% Boron) at 10-15 kg/acre before planting.
        *   Foliar spray: **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (20% Boron) at 1-1.5 g/L water during the pre-flowering and early flowering stages.
    *   **Calcium:** Crucial for cell wall development, fruit firmness, and preventing physiological disorders.
        *   Soil application: **Calcium Nitrate** at 5 kg/acre.
        *   Foliar spray: **Calcium Nitrate** at 5 g/L water during fruit development.
    *   **Potassium:** Improves overall plant vigor, stress tolerance, and fruit quality. Ensure adequate application of **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** or **Sulphate of Potash (SOP)** as per soil test recommendations.

**3. Hormonal Management (Plant Growth Regulators - PGRs):**

*   To reduce flower and fruit drop, the application of auxins can be highly beneficial.
    *   **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA) 4.5% SL:** Apply at a concentration of 10-20 ppm. This typically translates to **0.2-0.4 ml of NAA 4.5% SL per liter of water.**
        *   **Timing:** The first spray should be given at the pre-flowering stage, and a second spray 15-20 days later, or at the early fruit set stage.
        *   **Note:** Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and CIBRC guidelines for specific product dosages and safety precautions.

**4. Pest and Disease Management:**

*   Regularly scout your field for pests and diseases. If pests are identified as a cause for flower/fruit drop:
    *   **For Sucking Pests (Thrips, Mites):** If severe, apply **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL** at 0.5 ml/L or **Thiamethoxam 25% WG** at 0.2 g/L.
    *   **For Fruit Borers:** If identified, apply **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC** at 0.3 ml/L or **Flubendiamide 20% WG** at 0.2 g/L.
    *   **Note:** Apply chemicals only when necessary, following recommended dosages and safety precautions. Avoid spraying during peak pollinator activity.

By implementing these integrated management strategies, you can significantly reduce flower and fruit drop and improve the yield of your Spine Gourd crop.
