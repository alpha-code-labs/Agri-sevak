As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an integrated approach for weed control in Spine Gourd (Momordica dioica), combining cultural, mechanical, and judicious chemical methods. Due to the sensitivity of cucurbit crops to many herbicides, manual weeding remains the primary and safest method.

**General Weed Management Strategies:**

*   **Manual Weeding:** This is the most effective and recommended method for Spine Gourd. Perform weeding at critical stages (typically 20-40 days after planting) to minimize crop-weed competition. Regular weeding will keep the field clean.
*   **Mulching:** Applying organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves, crop residues) around the base of the plants can significantly suppress weed growth, conserve soil moisture, and regulate soil temperature.
*   **Inter-row Cultivation:** Shallow cultivation between rows can control young weeds without disturbing the crop roots, especially in the early stages.
*   **Clean Planting Material:** Always use certified weed-free seeds and planting material to prevent the introduction of weed seeds into the field.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Implement appropriate crop rotation practices to break the weed cycle.

**Chemical Control (Use with extreme caution and strictly as per label instructions):**

**For Broadleaf and Narrowleaf Weeds (General Control):**

*   **Pre-emergence Application:**
    *   **Pendimethalin** (30% EC formulation): Apply 1.0 kg a.i. per acre (approximately **3.3 Litres** of 30% EC formulation per acre) as a pre-emergence spray within 1-3 days after sowing or transplanting. Ensure uniform coverage on moist soil. This provides control of many germinating broadleaf and narrowleaf weeds.
    *   **Pendimethalin** (38.7% CS formulation): Apply 1.0 kg a.i. per acre (approximately **2.6 Litres** of 38.7% CS formulation per acre) as a pre-emergence spray within 1-3 days after sowing or transplanting.

**Specific Weed Control:**

*   **Amarbail (Cuscuta spp.):**
    *   **Prevention:** Use certified weed-free seeds. Remove any Amarbail plants from surrounding areas (field bunds, non-crop areas) before they produce seeds.
    *   **Manual Removal:** Immediately remove and destroy any Amarbail strands observed on Spine Gourd plants or nearby weeds. This is critical to prevent its spread and establishment.
    *   **Pre-emergence:** **Pendimethalin** (as mentioned above) can offer some suppression of Amarbail seed germination, but it is not a complete control measure once the parasite has attached to the crop.
*   **Bathu (Chenopodium album) and Congress Grass (Parthenium hysterophorus):**
    *   These are broadleaf weeds. They are primarily controlled by the general weed management strategies, including manual weeding and pre-emergence application of **Pendimethalin**. Manual removal of Congress grass is highly recommended due to its allergenic properties and to prevent seed dispersal.
*   **Phalaris minor (Little seed canary grass):**
    *   This is a narrowleaf (grass) weed. It is primarily controlled by manual weeding and the pre-emergence application of **Pendimethalin**.
    *   *Note:* While some grass-specific post-emergence herbicides are available for broadleaf crops, their specific registration and safety for Spine Gourd in India are limited. Therefore, manual removal of grasses is the safest and most recommended post-emergence approach for Spine Gourd.

*   **Orobanche (Broomrape):**
    *   **This is not known to affect Spine Gourd.** Orobanche species are primarily parasitic on solanaceous crops (e.g., brinjal, tomato, tobacco), legumes, and some oilseed crops.

**Important Considerations for Herbicide Application:**

*   Always read and strictly follow the label instructions of any herbicide product.
*   Ensure proper calibration of spray equipment for accurate dosage and uniform coverage.
*   Apply herbicides during calm weather conditions to avoid drift onto non-target plants.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including gloves, mask, and protective clothing during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions.
