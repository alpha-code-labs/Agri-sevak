As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned conditions in Spine Gourd (Momordica dioica) in Haryana:

### Control Measures for Diseases and Conditions in Spine Gourd

**1. Scab**
*   This is not known to affect Spine Gourd.

**2. Canker**
Canker-like symptoms on Spine Gourd stems and fruits are often associated with fungal diseases such as Gummy Stem Blight (*Didymella bryoniae* / *Stagonosporopsis cucurbitacearum*) or Anthracnose (*Colletotrichum* species).

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Ensure good field sanitation by removing and destroying infected plant debris.
    *   Practice crop rotation with non-cucurbit crops for at least 2-3 years.
    *   Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day, to reduce leaf wetness.
    *   Maintain proper plant spacing to improve air circulation.
    *   Use disease-free seeds or seedlings.

*   **Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
    *   For preventive control or at the first sign of symptoms, apply systemic and contact fungicides alternately.
    *   **Mancozeb**: Apply at 2.0-2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Chlorothalonil**: Apply at 2.0 g/L of water.
    *   **Carbendazim**: Apply at 0.5-1.0 g/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin**: Apply at 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water.
    *   **Difenoconazole**: Apply at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   Ensure thorough coverage of the plant, especially stems and fruits. Repeat applications as per product label recommendations, typically at 7-10 day intervals, depending on disease severity and weather conditions.

**3. Gummosis**
Gummosis in Spine Gourd is typically a symptom, often associated with stem cankers caused by fungal pathogens like Gummy Stem Blight (*Didymella bryoniae*). It manifests as the exudation of a gummy substance from infected stems.

*   **Control measures for Gummosis are integrated with those for Canker, as it is a symptom of the underlying fungal infection.**
*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Implement all cultural practices mentioned for Canker control, including sanitation, crop rotation, and proper irrigation management.
    *   Avoid any mechanical injury to stems that could create entry points for pathogens.

*   **Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
    *   The same fungicides recommended for Canker control are effective against the pathogens causing gummosis.
    *   **Mancozeb**: Apply at 2.0-2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Chlorothalonil**: Apply at 2.0 g/L of water.
    *   **Carbendazim**: Apply at 0.5-1.0 g/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin**: Apply at 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water.
    *   **Difenoconazole**: Apply at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   Focus on protecting stems and nodes where gummosis typically appears.

**4. Lichen**
Lichens are symbiotic organisms (fungus and alga) that grow on the surface of plants, rocks, or other substrates. They are epiphytic and generally do not parasitize the plant or cause direct harm to Spine Gourd.

*   **Control is generally not required.** Lichens are harmless and do not extract nutrients from the plant. Their presence often indicates good air quality and a stable, non-disturbed environment.
*   If their presence is aesthetically undesirable or perceived to be excessive, improving plant vigor and ensuring good air circulation around the plants can sometimes reduce their growth. However, no chemical control is recommended or necessary for lichens on Spine Gourd.
