For Spine Gourd (Momordica dioica) cultivation in Haryana, the following scientifically verified practices are recommended:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   Spine gourd is primarily propagated vegetatively using root tubers for commercial cultivation. This method ensures true-to-type plants, early fruiting, and allows for maintaining the desired male:female plant ratio (typically 1 male plant for every 9-10 female plants).
    *   Prepare pits of 45 cm x 45 cm x 45 cm size. Fill these pits with a well-mixed blend of topsoil, 10-15 kg of well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) per pit, and a small amount of sand if the soil is heavy.
    *   Plant one healthy root tuber per pit.
    *   While seed propagation is possible, it is less common due to variability in sex expression, delayed fruiting, and the challenge of identifying male and female plants at an early stage. If seeds are used, they can be sown directly in pits or raised in a nursery and transplanted.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   For root tubers: Plant the tubers horizontally or vertically with the sprouting eye upwards, approximately 5-7 cm deep in the prepared pits.
    *   For seeds (if used): Sow seeds at a depth of 2-3 cm.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   Maintain a spacing of 2.0 meters between rows and 2.0 meters between plants within a row (2.0 m x 2.0 m). This spacing provides adequate room for vine growth, sunlight penetration, and facilitates cultural operations like weeding, training, and harvesting.

*   **Seed Dose / Tuber Dose:**
    *   As vegetative propagation using root tubers is the preferred and most efficient method for commercial production: Approximately 2000-2500 healthy root tubers are required per acre to achieve the recommended plant density and ensure a balanced male:female ratio.
    *   If propagating through seeds (less common and generally not recommended for commercial production due to the reasons mentioned above): A seed rate of 1.0-1.5 kg per acre might be used, but this method requires careful management to ensure proper male and female plant distribution and uniform yield.
