As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified recommendations for the use of growth regulators and Boron in Spine Gourd cultivation in Haryana:

*   **Ethephon**
    *   **Purpose:** To promote the production of female flowers, which is crucial for increasing fruit set and overall yield in Spine Gourd.
    *   **Recommended Dose:** Apply **Ethephon** (39% SL formulation) at a concentration of 250 ppm (parts per million). This translates to approximately **0.64 ml/L** of water.
    *   **Timing:** Apply as a foliar spray when the plants are at the 2-4 true leaf stage.

*   **2,4-D**
    *   This is not a standard recommended growth regulator for Spine Gourd in Haryana. While **2,4-D** is a synthetic auxin, its use as a growth regulator in cucurbits like Spine Gourd is generally not advised due to its narrow margin between growth regulation and herbicidal effects, which can easily lead to phytotoxicity and adverse effects on the crop.

*   **Boron**
    *   **Purpose:** Boron is an essential micronutrient vital for pollen germination, pollen tube growth, cell wall formation, and sugar transport. Adequate Boron supply improves flowering, fruit set, and overall fruit development, preventing malformed fruits.
    *   **Recommended Dose:** Apply **Boron** as a foliar spray at a concentration of 0.1% to 0.2%. This can be achieved by dissolving:
        *   **1-2 g/L** of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (e.g., Solubor, typically containing 17% Boron) in water.
        *   OR **2-4 g/L** of **Sodium tetraborate decahydrate** (e.g., Borax, typically containing 11% Boron) in water.
    *   **Timing:** Apply before flowering and repeat during the peak flowering period, especially in soils known to be deficient in Boron.
