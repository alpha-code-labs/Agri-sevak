Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing diseases in Spine Gourd (Momordica dioica) in Haryana.

Let's address your concerns regarding Dieback, Twig blight, and Tikka disease:

### Control of Dieback and Twig Blight in Spine Gourd

Dieback and Twig blight are often symptomatic descriptions of various fungal infections that cause the tips of shoots or twigs to die back. In Spine Gourd, these symptoms can be associated with diseases like anthracnose, gummy stem blight, or other stem/shoot blights. Effective management involves both cultural practices and timely application of fungicides.

**1. Cultural Practices:**

*   **Sanitation:** Regularly inspect plants and promptly remove and destroy all infected plant parts (twigs, leaves, fruits) to reduce the source of inoculum.
*   **Pruning:** Prune affected twigs during dry weather conditions, making clean cuts into healthy tissue. Sterilize pruning tools with a 10% bleach solution between cuts to prevent disease spread.
*   **Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to improve air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce humidity and fungal growth.
*   **Water Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day, as prolonged leaf wetness promotes fungal development. Drip irrigation is preferable.
*   **Nutrition:** Provide balanced nutrition to the plants to enhance their natural resistance and vigor. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can lead to lush, susceptible growth.

**2. Chemical Control (Fungicides):**

For effective control, apply fungicides preventively or at the first sign of symptoms. Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

*   **Option 1 (Broad-spectrum protectant + systemic):**
    *   Spray with **Mancozeb** at 2.5 grams per litre of water.
    *   Alternatively, spray with **Copper Oxychloride** at 3 grams per litre of water.
    *   Followed by a systemic fungicide like **Carbendazim** at 1 gram per litre of water, or **Thiophanate-methyl** at 1 gram per litre of water, 10-15 days later, depending on disease severity.

*   **Option 2 (Systemic fungicides):**
    *   Spray with **Propiconazole** at 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   Alternatively, spray with **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   Repeat application after 10-15 days if symptoms persist or disease pressure is high.

*   **Application:** Ensure thorough coverage of all plant parts, especially the affected twigs and surrounding foliage.

### Control of Tikka Disease in Spine Gourd

This is not known to affect Spine Gourd. Tikka disease is primarily a common leaf spot disease of groundnut (peanut) caused by *Cercospora arachidicola* and *Phaeoisariopsis personata*.
