As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following doses of organic manures for Spine Gourd cultivation in Haryana:

*   **Farmyard Manure (FYM):**
    *   Apply 15-20 tonnes per acre (15,000-20,000 kg/acre) during land preparation, at least 2-3 weeks before planting. Ensure the FYM is well-decomposed.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   Apply 3-5 tonnes per acre (3,000-5,000 kg/acre) during land preparation, or as a partial replacement/supplement to FYM. It can also be applied as a top-dressing around the plants during the early growth stages.

*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract):**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Mix **2-3 ml/L** of water and spray uniformly on the foliage.
    *   **Soil Drench/Drip Application:** Apply **1-2 L per acre** mixed with irrigation water.
    *   **Application Timing:** Start applications 20-30 days after planting and repeat 2-3 times at 20-30 day intervals, especially during vegetative growth and fruit development stages.
