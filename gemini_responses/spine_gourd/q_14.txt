Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling soil pests like termites and root-knot nematodes in Spine Gourd (Parwal/Kantola) cultivation in Haryana. Both these pests are significant threats to cucurbit crops, including Spine Gourd.

It is crucial to adopt an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods for sustainable control.

### Control of Termites (Deemak) in Spine Gourd

Termites can cause significant damage by feeding on roots and the base of the stem, leading to wilting and plant death.

**1. Cultural and Preventive Measures:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove all crop residues, stubble, and woody debris from the field before planting, as these can serve as food sources and breeding sites for termites.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** Plough the field deeply during summer to expose termite colonies to sunlight and predators, disrupting their nests.
*   **Proper Irrigation:** Avoid water stress, as termites are often more active in dry conditions. However, also avoid waterlogging.
*   **Farmyard Manure (FYM):** Ensure that FYM is well-decomposed before application, as undecomposed organic matter can attract termites.

**2. Chemical Control (Soil Application):**
For effective control, apply chemicals to the soil before planting or at the time of planting.

*   **Pre-planting Soil Treatment:**
    *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC:** Apply 2.5 - 4 litres per acre, mixed with 200-400 litres of water, and drench the soil thoroughly or mix it into the soil during the last ploughing.
    *   **Fipronil 0.3% GR:** Apply 10-15 kg per acre by broadcasting and incorporating into the soil before planting.

### Control of Nematodes (Root-Knot Nematodes - *Meloidogyne* spp.) in Spine Gourd

Root-knot nematodes are microscopic worms that infect plant roots, causing characteristic galls or knots. This impairs water and nutrient uptake, leading to stunted growth, yellowing, wilting, and reduced yield.

**1. Cultural and Preventive Measures:**
*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate Spine Gourd with non-host crops like cereals (wheat, maize), marigold, or mustard for at least 2-3 years. Marigold (Tagetes spp.) is particularly effective as a trap crop.
*   **Solarization:** Cover the moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets during hot summer months (May-June) for 4-6 weeks. This raises soil temperature, killing nematodes and other soil-borne pathogens.
*   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporate well-decomposed Farmyard Manure (FYM) or compost at 10-15 tonnes per acre.
*   **Neem Cake Application:** Apply **Neem cake** at 200-400 kg per acre and mix it into the soil 2-3 weeks before planting. Neem cake has nematicidal properties and improves soil health.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** If available, choose Spine Gourd varieties known to have resistance or tolerance to root-knot nematodes.

**2. Biological Control:**
*   **Bio-nematicides:** Apply beneficial fungi like *Purpureocillium lilacinum* (formerly *Paecilomyces lilacinus*) or *Trichoderma harzianum* to the soil. These can be applied as seed treatment, soil application, or root dip. Follow manufacturer's instructions for dosage.

**3. Chemical Control (Nematicides):**
Chemical nematicides should be used judiciously, especially in conjunction with other control methods.

*   **At Planting/Transplanting:**
    *   **Carbofuran 3% GR:** Apply 10-15 kg per acre by broadcasting and incorporating into the soil at the time of planting or as a side dressing around the plants.
    *   **Fluensulfone 2% GR:** Apply 10-15 kg per acre by broadcasting and incorporating into the soil at the time of planting or as a side dressing around the plants.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the product label for dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) while handling chemicals.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and current pest pressure.

By implementing these strategies, you can effectively manage soil pests in your Spine Gourd crop and ensure a healthy yield.
