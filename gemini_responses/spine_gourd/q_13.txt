As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in Spine Gourd in Haryana:

**Ber Fly (Carpomyia vesuviana):**
This is not known to affect Spine Gourd. Ber fly is a specific pest of Ber (Ziziphus mauritiana).

**Fruit Fly (Primarily *Bactrocera cucurbitae* and *Bactrocera dorsalis*) in Spine Gourd:**
Fruit flies are a major pest of cucurbits, including Spine Gourd, causing significant damage by laying eggs in developing fruits, leading to maggot infestation and fruit rot. An integrated pest management (IPM) approach is recommended for effective control.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Fruit Fly:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Regularly collect and destroy all fallen, damaged, and infested fruits by burying them deep in the soil or burning them. This breaks the life cycle of the pest.
    *   **Deep Ploughing:** After harvest, deep ploughing helps expose pupae in the soil to predators and adverse weather conditions.
    *   **Timely Harvesting:** Harvest fruits at the appropriate stage to prevent them from becoming overripe and more attractive to fruit flies.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid continuous cultivation of cucurbit crops in the same field.

2.  **Mechanical/Physical Methods:**
    *   **Pheromone Traps:** Install fruit fly pheromone traps (e.g., Cue-lure for *Bactrocera cucurbitae* and Methyl eugenol lure for *Bactrocera dorsalis*) at a density of 10-12 traps per acre. These traps help in monitoring the pest population and also in mass trapping, reducing the adult population. Replace lures every 2-3 weeks.
    *   **Bagging of Fruits:** For small-scale cultivation, individual fruits can be covered with paper or cloth bags to prevent egg-laying by fruit flies.

3.  **Chemical Control (Use only CIBRC approved technical chemicals):**
    When pest incidence is high or other methods are insufficient, chemical control can be integrated.

    *   **Bait Sprays:** This is a highly effective and targeted method. Prepare a bait solution and apply it as spot sprays on the foliage (not directly on fruits) in the morning hours.
        *   Mix **Malathion 50% EC** at 2 ml/L of water with 10 g/L of protein hydrolysate or jaggery. Apply this mixture as spot sprays on 5-10% of the plants, targeting the upper leaves.
    *   **Foliar Sprays (if necessary):** In cases of severe infestation, general foliar sprays may be required. Ensure thorough coverage of the plant canopy.
        *   **Spinosad 45% SC** at 0.25-0.3 ml/L of water.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC** at 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Deltamethrin 2.8% EC** at 1 ml/L of water.

    **Important Considerations for Chemical Application:**
    *   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully.
    *   Observe the recommended pre-harvest interval (PHI) to ensure the safety of the produce.
    *   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
    *   Apply insecticides preferably in the evening to minimize harm to beneficial insects.
