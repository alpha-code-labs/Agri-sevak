Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU), Hisar, I can provide you with scientifically verified advice on addressing micronutrient deficiencies in Spine Gourd.

First and foremost, it is crucial to conduct a **soil test** to accurately identify which micronutrients are deficient and to what extent. This will help in precise application and prevent over-application, which can be detrimental.

Here's how to address specific micronutrient deficiencies in Spine Gourd:

### General Recommendations for Micronutrient Application:

*   **Foliar Application:** Often preferred for quick correction of micronutrient deficiencies, especially when symptoms are visible. Apply sprays during early morning or late evening hours for better absorption. Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.
*   **Soil Application:** Suitable for long-term correction and as a preventive measure, especially for nutrients like Zinc and Boron. Incorporate into the soil before planting or as a top-dressing.
*   **Water Quality:** Ensure the pH of the spray water is suitable (usually slightly acidic to neutral) for optimal nutrient uptake.
*   **Compatibility:** Avoid mixing micronutrient fertilizers with incompatible pesticides or other fertilizers without checking compatibility.

### Specific Micronutrient Deficiencies and Their Management:

#### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, small leaves (often called 'little leaf'), interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, and sometimes bronzing of older leaves.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray 0.5% solution of **Zinc sulfate heptahydrate** (5 g/L of water).
        *   Alternatively, spray 0.1% solution of **Zinc EDTA** (1 g/L of water).
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, starting when symptoms appear or at the vegetative growth stage.
    *   **Soil Application (Preventive/Corrective):**
        *   Apply 5-10 kg/acre of **Zinc sulfate heptahydrate** at the time of field preparation or planting. This application is generally effective for 2-3 years.

#### 2. Iron (Fe) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Prominent interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins, with veins remaining green) on young leaves. In severe cases, entire leaves may turn yellow or white.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray 0.5% solution of **Ferrous sulfate heptahydrate** (5 g/L of water).
        *   Alternatively, spray 0.1% solution of **Ferrous EDTA** (1 g/L of water).
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 7-10 day intervals until symptoms disappear.
    *   **Soil Application (Less efficient in alkaline soils common in Haryana):**
        *   For severe cases in alkaline soils, apply 1-2 kg/acre of **Ferrous EDDHA**.
        *   **Ferrous sulfate heptahydrate** (10-20 kg/acre) can be applied, but its effectiveness is limited in high pH soils.

#### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, death of growing points (terminal buds), cracking of stems and fruits, hollow stems, poor fruit set, and malformed fruits.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray 0.1-0.2% solution of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (1-2 g/L of water).
        *   Alternatively, spray 0.1-0.2% solution of **Boric acid** (1-2 g/L of water).
        *   Apply 1-2 sprays, especially at the pre-flowering and fruit-setting stages.
    *   **Soil Application (Use with caution, as excess Boron is toxic):**
        *   Apply 1-2 kg/acre of **Borax** or 0.5-1 kg/acre of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** based on soil test recommendations.

#### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, distorted or curled new leaves, weak stems, poor root development, and sometimes blossom end rot in fruits (though less common in Spine Gourd than in other cucurbits like bottle gourd or tomato).
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray 0.5-1% solution of **Calcium chloride** (5-10 g/L of water).
        *   Alternatively, spray 0.5-1% solution of **Calcium nitrate** (5-10 g/L of water).
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays during the fruit development stage.
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   If soil test indicates low calcium, apply 200-400 kg/acre of **Gypsum** (Calcium sulfate dihydrate) during soil preparation. This also helps in improving soil structure.

#### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins, with veins remaining green) on older leaves. In severe cases, leaves may develop a purplish or reddish tint.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray 0.5-1% solution of **Magnesium sulfate heptahydrate** (5-10 g/L of water).
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals.
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   Apply 10-20 kg/acre of **Magnesium sulfate heptahydrate** during soil preparation or as a top-dressing.

#### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, similar to iron deficiency but often accompanied by small necrotic (dead) spots. Growth may be stunted.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray 0.2-0.5% solution of **Manganese sulfate monohydrate** (2-5 g/L of water).
        *   Alternatively, spray 0.1% solution of **Manganese EDTA** (1 g/L of water).
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals.
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   Apply 5-10 kg/acre of **Manganese sulfate monohydrate** during soil preparation.

Always remember to follow the specific instructions and safety precautions provided on the product labels. For precise recommendations tailored to your specific field conditions, please consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts after obtaining a detailed soil test report.
