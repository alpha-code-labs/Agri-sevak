As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Spine Gourd (Momordica dioica) in Haryana:

### Control of Pests in Spine Gourd

**1. Grasshopper**
Grasshoppers can cause significant defoliation by chewing leaves and tender shoots of Spine Gourd.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Regular weeding around the field reduces breeding sites and food sources for nymphs.
    *   Deep ploughing after harvest can expose eggs to predators and harsh weather.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   For effective control, especially during outbreaks, consider spraying with CIBRC approved insecticides:
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC**: Apply at 0.5 ml per litre of water (approximately 100-125 ml per acre).
        *   **Malathion 50% EC**: Apply at 2 ml per litre of water (approximately 500 ml per acre).
    *   Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.

**2. Painted Bug**
This is not known to affect Spine Gourd. Painted bugs (Bagrada hilaris) are primarily pests of cruciferous crops like mustard, cabbage, and cauliflower.

**3. Red Cotton Bug**
This is not known to affect Spine Gourd. Red cotton bugs (Dysdercus cingulatus) are specific pests of cotton and other malvaceous plants.

**4. Black Ants**
This is not known to directly affect Spine Gourd as a primary pest causing significant damage to the plant itself. While ants can be a nuisance, their presence on plants often indicates the presence of other honeydew-producing insects like aphids or mealybugs, which they protect. If ants are observed, it is advisable to inspect the plant for these secondary pests and manage them accordingly. If ants are causing specific damage (e.g., nesting in fruits, damaging roots), further investigation would be required.
