As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm that:

*   **Fruit fly** is not known to affect Jasmine. Fruit flies primarily infest a wide range of fruit crops, but Jasmine flowers or its small, non-commercial fruits are not typical hosts for economically significant damage.
*   **Ber fly** (*Carpomyia vesuviana*) is a highly host-specific pest that exclusively infests Ber (*Ziziphus mauritiana*) fruits. This is not known to affect Jasmine.
