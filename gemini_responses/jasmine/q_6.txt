As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling viral diseases in Jasmine in Haryana.

Firstly, regarding some of the specific viruses mentioned:

*   **Tristeza:** This is not known to affect Jasmine. Citrus Tristeza Virus (CTV) primarily affects citrus species.

For Leaf curl, Mosaic, Yellow vein clearing, Stripe, and Stunt virus, it is crucial to understand that there are no direct chemical cures for viral diseases once a plant is infected. The primary strategy revolves around prevention, managing the vectors that transmit these viruses, and maintaining plant health.

Here are the recommended control measures:

**1. Cultural and Management Practices (Prevention is Key):**

*   **Use Virus-Free Planting Material:** Always source healthy, certified virus-free saplings or cuttings from reputable nurseries. This is the most critical step.
*   **Rogueing of Infected Plants:** Immediately remove and destroy (burn or bury deep) any plants showing symptoms of viral infection (e.g., distorted leaves, yellowing, stunted growth, mosaic patterns). This prevents the spread of the virus to healthy plants.
*   **Weed Management:** Many weeds can act as alternative hosts for viruses and their insect vectors. Keep the area around Jasmine plants free of weeds.
*   **Sanitation:** Sterilize pruning tools with a 10% bleach solution or 70% alcohol before and after pruning each plant to prevent mechanical transmission of viruses.
*   **Proper Nutrition and Irrigation:** Ensure plants receive balanced nutrition and adequate water. Healthy, vigorous plants are generally more resilient to pest attacks and stress.
*   **Crop Rotation (if applicable for new plantings):** While Jasmine is a perennial, if replanting in an area where viral diseases were severe, consider a short break or soil solarization.

**2. Vector Control (Chemical Management):**

Most of the viral diseases in Jasmine are transmitted by insect vectors such as aphids, whiteflies, and thrips. Controlling these vectors is paramount to preventing the spread of the virus. Apply insecticides when vector populations are observed or as a preventive measure during peak vector activity periods.

*   **For Aphids and Thrips:**
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: Apply at 0.5-1 ml/L of water.
    *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: Apply at 0.2-0.4 g/L of water.
    *   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP: Apply at 0.2-0.4 g/L of water.
    *   **Fipronil** 5% SC: Apply at 1.5-2 ml/L of water.

*   **For Whiteflies:**
    *   **Buprofezin** 25% SC: Apply at 1.25 ml/L of water (effective against nymphs).
    *   **Spiromesifen** 22.9% SC: Apply at 0.5-0.75 ml/L of water.
    *   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP: Apply at 0.2-0.4 g/L of water.
    *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: Apply at 0.2-0.4 g/L of water.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label for dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance in insect populations.
*   Apply insecticides during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   For severe infestations, multiple applications at recommended intervals may be necessary.

By implementing these integrated management strategies, you can significantly reduce the incidence and spread of viral diseases in your Jasmine plants.
