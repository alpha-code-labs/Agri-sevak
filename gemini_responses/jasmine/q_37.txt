Protecting Jasmine from wild animals is essential to prevent damage to the plants and ensure healthy growth and flowering. In Haryana, common wild animals such as Nilgai (Blue Bull), wild boar, monkeys, and deer can cause significant damage by browsing leaves, flowers, and young shoots, or by uprooting plants. The most effective and scientifically verified methods primarily involve physical barriers and sound cultural practices.

**Methods to Protect Jasmine from Wild Animals:**

1.  **Physical Barriers (Fencing):** This is the most reliable and recommended method for protecting Jasmine from wild animals.
    *   **Wire Mesh Fencing:** Install a sturdy wire mesh fence around the entire cultivation area.
        *   **Height:** For larger animals like Nilgai and deer, a fence height of at least 2.0 to 2.5 meters (approximately 6.5 to 8 feet) is recommended.
        *   **Mesh Size:** The mesh size should be small enough to prevent smaller animals like rabbits from passing through, and the fence should be buried slightly below ground level (15-30 cm) to deter burrowing animals like wild boar or porcupines.
    *   **Barbed Wire Fencing:** Multiple strands of barbed wire can be used, often in conjunction with wire mesh or as a standalone barrier, particularly effective against larger animals.
    *   **Electric Fencing:** A highly effective deterrent against a wide range of wild animals, including Nilgai and wild boar. However, it requires careful installation, regular maintenance, and strict adherence to safety regulations to prevent harm to humans and non-target animals. It is advisable to consult with experts for proper design and installation.

2.  **Thorny Hedges:** Planting dense, thorny hedges around the Jasmine cultivation area can act as a living barrier.
    *   Species like *Carissa carandas* (Karonda) or *Ziziphus mauritiana* (Ber) can be considered, provided they are suitable for the local agro-climatic conditions and do not compete excessively with the Jasmine plants for resources. These hedges can deter animals from entering the protected area.

3.  **Cultural Practices and Habitat Management:**
    *   **Weed Control:** Keep the area around Jasmine plants free of weeds and tall grasses, which can provide cover for smaller animals and attract them to the vicinity.
    *   **Remove Attractants:** Ensure there are no other food sources (e.g., fallen fruits from other trees, discarded food waste) near the Jasmine plants that might attract wild animals.
    *   **Regular Monitoring:** Regularly inspect the Jasmine plants and the protective barriers for any signs of animal activity or damage. Promptly repair any breaches in fences or other protective structures.

4.  **Chemical Repellents:**
    *   Currently, there are no CIBRC (Central Insecticides Board & Registration Committee) approved technical chemical names specifically registered as repellents for wild animals to protect ornamental plants like Jasmine in India. Therefore, we cannot recommend any chemical repellents for this purpose. Physical barriers and habitat management remain the most effective and recommended approaches.
