As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified fertilizer schedule for Jasmine cultivation in Haryana. Please note that these are general recommendations, and a soil test is highly recommended for precise nutrient management tailored to your specific field conditions.

**General Fertilizer Recommendation for Mature Jasmine (per plant per year):**
For healthy growth and abundant flowering, a mature Jasmine plant typically requires:
*   Nitrogen (N): 100-120 g
*   Phosphorus (P2O5): 150-200 g
*   Potassium (K2O): 150-200 g
*   Sulphur (S): 20-30 g (often supplied through P and K fertilizers)

These amounts should be split into 2-3 applications throughout the year, typically after pruning (February-March) and during active growth/flowering periods (June-July and September-October).

**Recommended Dose of Fertilizers:**

Here are the recommendations using the specified fertilizers, considering both soil application and foliar sprays.

**A. Soil Application (Per Plant Per Year):**

You can choose one of the following combinations for soil application, split into 2-3 doses as mentioned above. Apply fertilizers in a ring around the plant, 15-30 cm away from the main stem, and mix lightly with the soil, followed by irrigation.

**Option 1: Using Urea, Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP), Single Super Phosphate (SSP), and Muriate of Potash**

*   **Urea**: 145 g per plant per year
*   **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)**: 300 g per plant per year
*   **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)**: 390 g per plant per year
*   **Muriate of Potash**: 335 g per plant per year

    *This combination provides approximately 120 g N, 200 g P2O5, 200 g K2O, and about 43 g S (from SSP).*

**Option 2: Using Urea, Single Super Phosphate (SSP), and Muriate of Potash (if DAP is not preferred)**

*   **Urea**: 260 g per plant per year
*   **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)**: 1250 g per plant per year
*   **Muriate of Potash**: 335 g per plant per year

    *This combination provides approximately 120 g N, 200 g P2O5, 200 g K2O, and about 138 g S (from SSP).*

**B. Foliar Application (Supplementary to Soil Application):**

Foliar applications are supplementary and help in quick nutrient uptake, especially during critical growth stages or nutrient stress.

*   **Nano Urea Liquid**:
    *   **Dose**: 2-4 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Application**: Spray 2-3 times during active vegetative growth and flowering stages, at 15-20 day intervals.

*   **Nano Di-ammonium Phosphate Liquid**:
    *   **Dose**: 2-4 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Application**: Spray 2-3 times during pre-flowering and flowering stages, at 15-20 day intervals.

*   **NPK Complex Fertilizers (Water Soluble)**:
    *   For general growth (e.g., **NPK 19:19:19**):
        *   **Dose**: 5 g per litre of water.
        *   **Application**: Spray 2-3 times during active growth.
    *   For flowering/fruiting (e.g., **NPK 0:52:34** or **NPK 13:0:45**):
        *   **Dose**: 5 g per litre of water.
        *   **Application**: Spray 1-2 times during pre-flowering and flowering stages.

**C. Specific Nutrient Recommendations:**

*   **Urea**: (See soil application options above).
*   **Nano Urea Liquid**: (See foliar application above).
*   **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)**: (See soil application Option 1 above).
*   **Nano Di-ammonium Phosphate Liquid**: (See foliar application above).
*   **NPK Complex Fertilizers**: (See foliar application above, or can be used for soil application if preferred, adjusting quantities to meet NPK requirements).
*   **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)**: (See soil application options above). This fertilizer is an excellent source of Phosphorus and also provides Sulphur and Calcium.
*   **Potash (Muriate of Potash)**: (See soil application options above). **Muriate of Potash** (60% K2O) is the most common source. If **Sulphate of Potash** (50% K2O, 17.5% S) is used, adjust the quantity accordingly (e.g., 400 g per plant per year to provide 200 g K2O).
*   **Sulphur**:
    *   The recommended **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** application provides sufficient Sulphur.
    *   If a soil test indicates a severe Sulphur deficiency, or if you are not using SSP, you may apply **Elemental Sulphur (90% WDG)** at a dose of 20-30 g per plant per year, mixed with soil during the first application.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Soil Testing**: Always conduct a soil test to determine the exact nutrient status of your soil. This will help in fine-tuning the fertilizer doses and avoiding over or under-application.
*   **Irrigation**: Ensure adequate irrigation after every soil fertilizer application to facilitate nutrient dissolution and uptake by the roots.
*   **Organic Manures**: Supplement chemical fertilizers with well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost (5-10 kg per plant per year) for improved soil health and nutrient availability.
*   **Plant Age and Vigor**: Adjust fertilizer doses based on the age and vigor of the plant. Younger plants require less, while older, highly productive plants may require slightly more.
