As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified recommendations for Jasmine cultivation in Haryana:

### Seed Treatment for Jasmine

This is not known to affect Jasmine. Commercial cultivation of Jasmine (Jasminum spp.) is primarily done through vegetative propagation using cuttings (semi-hardwood or hardwood cuttings), not seeds. Therefore, a conventional seed treatment process is not applicable or recommended for Jasmine.

### Soil Treatment Process for Jasmine

Effective soil treatment is crucial for establishing a healthy Jasmine plantation. This involves both general soil preparation and specific treatments for potential soil-borne pests and diseases.

**A. General Soil Preparation (Pre-planting):**

1.  **Soil Testing:** Before any treatment, conduct a comprehensive soil test to determine nutrient status, pH, and presence of any soil-borne pests or pathogens (e.g., nematodes). This will guide specific recommendations.
2.  **Deep Ploughing:** Plough the field deeply (25-30 cm) to loosen the soil, improve aeration, and facilitate root penetration.
3.  **Organic Matter Incorporation:** Incorporate well-decomposed Farmyard Manure (FYM) or compost at a rate of 10-15 kg per square meter (or 20-30 tonnes per acre) during the final ploughing. This improves soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability.
4.  **Soil Solarization (Recommended for Haryana):** In hot summer months (May-June), after preparing the soil and moistening it, cover the area with a transparent polyethylene sheet (25-100 micron thickness) for 4-6 weeks. This non-chemical method effectively reduces soil-borne fungi, bacteria, nematodes, and weed seeds by increasing soil temperature.

**B. Specific Soil Treatments (Based on Soil Test Results):**

If soil testing reveals specific problems like high nematode populations or a history of soil-borne fungal diseases, the following treatments may be considered:

1.  **For Nematode Management:**
    *   **Biological Control:**
        *   Mix 2.5 kg of **Paecilomyces lilacinus** (or **Purpureocillium lilacinum**) formulation (1x10^8 CFU/g) with 50 kg of well-decomposed FYM or compost. Apply this mixture uniformly to one acre of land and incorporate it into the soil before planting.
    *   **Chemical Control (if severe infestation):**
        *   Apply **Carbofuran 3% G** at a rate of 10-15 kg per acre. Broadcast uniformly and incorporate into the soil before planting. *Note: This is a restricted-use pesticide and should be handled with extreme care, following all safety guidelines.*

2.  **For Soil-borne Fungal Disease Management (e.g., Wilt, Root Rot):**
    *   **Biological Control:**
        *   Mix 2.5 kg of **Trichoderma viride** (or **Trichoderma harzianum**) formulation (1x10^8 CFU/g) with 50 kg of well-decomposed FYM or compost. Apply this mixture uniformly to one acre of land and incorporate it into the soil before planting. This helps in suppressing various soil-borne fungal pathogens.
    *   **Chemical Control (if severe problem and biological methods are insufficient):**
        *   While pre-planting soil incorporation of fungicides is less common for general fungal control, if a specific pathogen is identified, a drench with **Carbendazim 50% WP** at 1-2 g/L of water can be applied to the planting pits or around the base of established plants. For pre-planting, it's generally better to rely on solarization and bio-agents.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always prioritize integrated pest and disease management (IPM) approaches, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods.
*   Chemical treatments should be a last resort and applied strictly according to label instructions and CIBRC guidelines.
*   Ensure proper drainage in the field to prevent waterlogging, which can exacerbate root rot issues.
