Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the challenges posed by sucking pests in Jasmine cultivation. Timely and effective management is crucial to ensure healthy plant growth and abundant flowering.

The sucking pests you've mentioned – Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, Thrips, and Psylla – are indeed common and can cause significant damage to Jasmine by feeding on plant sap, leading to stunted growth, leaf curling, yellowing, and reduced flower production. They can also transmit viral diseases and excrete honeydew, which promotes sooty mould growth.

Here's a scientifically verified approach for their control in Jasmine:

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategy:**

A holistic approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods is most effective for sustainable control.

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Regular Monitoring:** Inspect your Jasmine plants frequently, especially the undersides of leaves and new shoots, for early signs of pest infestation.
    *   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy heavily infested leaves, shoots, or branches to reduce pest populations.
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the area around Jasmine plants free of weeds, as many weeds can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
    *   **Proper Nutrition and Irrigation:** Maintain optimal plant health through balanced fertilization and adequate watering, as stressed plants are more susceptible to pest attacks.
    *   **Water Jet:** For minor aphid infestations, a strong jet of water can dislodge them from the plants.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Encourage natural enemies like ladybird beetles, lacewings, and parasitic wasps, which prey on aphids, whiteflies, and other soft-bodied insects. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

3.  **Chemical Control (as needed):**
    When pest populations are high and cultural/biological methods are insufficient, judicious use of CIBRC-approved insecticides is necessary. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

    *   **For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, Thrips, and Psylla:**
        *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at a concentration of 0.5 - 1.0 ml per litre of water. This is a systemic insecticide effective against a broad range of sucking pests.
        *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Use at a concentration of 0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water. Another systemic insecticide, excellent for aphids, whiteflies, leafhoppers, and thrips.
        *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply at a concentration of 0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water. This is a good option for resistance management, effective against aphids, whiteflies, and thrips.
        *   **Fipronil 5% SC:** Use at a concentration of 1.0 - 1.5 ml per litre of water. Particularly effective against thrips and leafhoppers.
        *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at a concentration of 1.0 - 1.25 ml per litre of water. This is an insect growth regulator, highly effective against whitefly nymphs and pupae, and can be used in rotation.
        *   **Azadirachtin (Neem-based formulations, e.g., 1500 ppm EC):** For early infestations or as part of an organic approach, apply at a concentration of 3-5 ml per litre of water. It acts as an antifeedant and insect growth disruptor.

    **Important Considerations for Chemical Application:**
    *   **Timing:** Spray in the early morning or late evening to minimize drift and maximize efficacy, and to protect pollinators if the plant is flowering.
    *   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough coverage of the plant, especially the undersides of leaves where many sucking pests reside.
    *   **Rotation:** Never use the same insecticide repeatedly. Rotate between chemicals with different modes of action to prevent pests from developing resistance.
    *   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, mask, and protective clothing while handling and spraying insecticides. Follow the instructions and safety precautions mentioned on the product label.
    *   **Water Quality:** Use clean water for mixing pesticides.

By implementing these measures, you can effectively manage sucking pests in your Jasmine plants and ensure their healthy growth and flowering. For any specific concerns or severe infestations, please consult with your local agricultural extension officer.
