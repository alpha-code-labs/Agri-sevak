As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I must clarify that Jasmine (Jasminum spp.) is primarily cultivated for its highly fragrant flowers, which are used in perfumes, aromatherapy, teas, and garlands. While Jasmine plants do produce small, dark berries (botanical fruits), these are not commercially harvested or consumed. Therefore, there are no established practices for improving "fruit quality" or "storage life" for Jasmine fruits.

This advice will focus on improving **flower yield**, **flower quality**, and **post-harvest life of Jasmine flowers**.

### General Recommendations for Jasmine Cultivation:

Before specific interventions, ensure fundamental good agricultural practices:
*   **Soil Testing:** Conduct regular soil tests to determine nutrient deficiencies and soil pH. This is crucial for precise nutrient management.
*   **Site Selection:** Ensure adequate sunlight (at least 6-8 hours direct sun) and well-drained soil.
*   **Irrigation:** Provide consistent moisture, especially during flowering periods, but avoid waterlogging.

### 1. Improving Flower Yield:

To maximize the quantity of flowers produced:

*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Nitrogen (N):** Promotes vegetative growth, which supports more flowering shoots. Apply in split doses.
    *   **Phosphorus (P):** Essential for root development and flower bud formation.
    *   **Potassium (K):** Crucial for overall plant health, disease resistance, and flower development.
    *   **Micronutrients:** Deficiencies in Zinc (Zn), Boron (B), and Iron (Fe) can limit yield.
    *   **Recommendation (General, adjust based on soil test):**
        *   Apply a balanced NPK fertilizer like 100-150 g N, 60-80 g P2O5, and 60-80 g K2O per plant per year, split into 2-3 applications (e.g., after pruning, during peak growth).
        *   Foliar spray of micronutrient mixture (containing Zn, B, Fe) at recommended concentrations (e.g., 0.5-1.0 g/L) during active growth and bud initiation.
*   **Pruning:**
    *   Annual pruning (typically after the main flowering season or in late winter/early spring) is essential to remove old, unproductive wood and encourage new growth, which bears flowers.
    *   Remove dead, diseased, or weak branches. Shape the plant to allow good air circulation and light penetration.
*   **Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs):**
    *   **Gibberellic acid (GA3):** Can promote shoot elongation and increase flower size/number in some varieties.
        *   Apply **Gibberellic acid** at 50-100 mg/L (ppm) as a foliar spray during the vegetative growth phase or at bud initiation.
    *   **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA):** Can help in flower retention and sometimes increase flower numbers at specific concentrations.
        *   Apply **Naphthalene Acetic Acid** at 10-20 mg/L (ppm) as a foliar spray during bud development.
*   **Pest and Disease Management:** Healthy plants are more productive. Regularly monitor for common pests (e.g., mites, thrips, bud borers) and diseases (e.g., rust, leaf spot) and manage them promptly using CIBRC-approved pesticides/fungicides as per HAU recommendations.

### 2. Improving Flower Quality:

Flower quality refers to attributes like size, fragrance, color, and freshness.

*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Potassium (K):** Plays a vital role in flower development, fragrance intensity, and overall flower quality. Ensure adequate K supply.
    *   **Boron (B):** Essential for pollen viability and flower development.
    *   **Recommendation:** Ensure balanced NPK application as mentioned above. Foliar spray of **Boron** (e.g., Borax) at 0.1-0.2% (1-2 g/L) during bud initiation can improve flower quality.
*   **Irrigation:** Consistent and adequate water supply, especially during bud formation and flowering, prevents flower drop and ensures turgid, well-developed flowers. Avoid both drought stress and waterlogging.
*   **Pest and Disease Management:** Prevent damage to buds and flowers by timely management of pests and diseases. For example, thrips can cause malformed flowers, and bud borers can destroy buds.
*   **Environmental Factors:** Ensure plants receive sufficient sunlight. Proper spacing between plants allows for good air circulation, reducing disease incidence and promoting healthy growth.

### 3. Improving Post-Harvest Life of Flowers:

The post-harvest life of Jasmine flowers is typically short due to their delicate nature and high respiration rate. These steps can help extend their freshness:

*   **Harvesting Practices:**
    *   Harvest flowers in the early morning (before sunrise) when they are fully developed but still in the bud stage or just beginning to open. This ensures maximum fragrance and freshness.
    *   Handle flowers gently to avoid physical damage.
*   **Pre-cooling:**
    *   Immediately after harvest, remove field heat by placing flowers in a cool, shaded area or a cold room (e.g., 5-10°C) for a short period.
*   **Holding Solutions (Pulsing/Vase Solutions):**
    *   Immerse the cut ends of flower stalks in a holding solution immediately after harvest. This provides nutrients, reduces microbial growth, and maintains turgidity.
    *   **Components of a typical holding solution:**
        *   **Energy Source:** Sucrose (2-5%) provides energy for respiration and maintains turgor.
        *   **Acidifier:** Citric acid (50-100 mg/L) or a few drops of lemon juice to lower the pH of the water (pH 3.5-4.5), which improves water uptake.
        *   **Bactericide:** To inhibit microbial growth in the water, which can block xylem vessels.
            *   Use **Aluminium Sulphate** at 200-300 mg/L (ppm) in the holding solution.
*   **Storage Conditions:**
    *   Store flowers at low temperatures (5-10°C) and high relative humidity (90-95%) to reduce respiration and transpiration rates.
    *   Avoid storing flowers with ripening fruits, as ethylene gas released by fruits can accelerate flower senescence.
*   **Packaging:**
    *   Pack flowers loosely in well-ventilated containers or baskets lined with moist paper to prevent desiccation and physical damage during transport.

By implementing these scientifically verified practices, Jasmine growers in Haryana can significantly improve their flower yield, quality, and the post-harvest life of their valuable produce.
