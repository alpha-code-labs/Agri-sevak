Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling soil pests like termites and nematodes (specifically root-knot nematodes) in your Jasmine cultivation. Both these pests are known to affect Jasmine plants, causing significant damage if not managed properly.

Here's a comprehensive approach:

### 1. Control of Termites (Odontotermes obesus, Microtermes obesi)

Termites can cause severe damage by feeding on the roots and stem base, leading to wilting, yellowing, and eventual death of the plant.

*   **Cultural and Preventive Measures:**
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove all dead wood, stubble, and plant debris from the field before planting and regularly thereafter, as these serve as food sources for termites.
    *   **Proper Irrigation:** Avoid water stress, as termites are often more active in dry conditions. However, also avoid waterlogging.
    *   **Deep Ploughing:** If possible before planting, deep ploughing can expose termite colonies to predators and sunlight.
    *   **Organic Matter:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost, as undecomposed organic matter can attract termites.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Soil Drenching/Application:**
        *   For existing infestations or as a preventive measure before planting, drench the soil around the base of the plants or mix into the soil.
        *   Use **Fipronil** 5% SC (Suspension Concentrate) at 1.5-2.0 ml per litre of water for drenching around the plant base.
        *   Alternatively, **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC (Emulsifiable Concentrate) can be used at 2.5-5.0 ml per litre of water for soil drenching. Ensure thorough wetting of the soil around the root zone.
        *   For granular application, **Fipronil** 0.3% GR (Granules) can be applied at 10-15 kg per acre, mixed into the soil around the plants.

### 2. Control of Nematodes (Root-knot Nematodes - Meloidogyne spp.)

Root-knot nematodes are microscopic worms that infect plant roots, causing characteristic galls or knots. This impairs the plant's ability to absorb water and nutrients, leading to stunted growth, yellowing, wilting, and reduced flowering.

*   **Cultural and Preventive Measures:**
    *   **Soil Solarization:** Before planting, especially in summer, cover the moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks. This raises soil temperature and kills nematodes, weed seeds, and soil-borne pathogens.
    *   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporate well-decomposed FYM, neem cake (at 200-400 kg/acre), or other organic matter into the soil. Neem cake has nematicidal properties.
    *   **Marigold Intercropping:** Planting marigolds (Tagetes spp.) as an intercrop or trap crop can help reduce nematode populations in the soil.
    *   **Resistant Varieties:** While specific resistant Jasmine varieties might not be widely available, choosing healthy, certified nematode-free planting material is crucial.

*   **Biological Control:**
    *   **Bio-nematicides:** Apply beneficial fungi like **Purpureocillium lilacinum** (formerly *Paecilomyces lilacinus*) or bacteria like **Bacillus subtilis**.
        *   **Purpureocillium lilacinum** (liquid formulation): Apply at 2.5-5.0 litres per acre through drip irrigation or drenching, mixed with 200 litres of water.
        *   **Purpureocillium lilacinum** (powder formulation): Apply at 2.5-5.0 kg per acre, mixed with 100 kg of well-decomposed FYM or compost, and broadcast around the plants, followed by light irrigation.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Nematicides:**
        *   For severe infestations, **Fluensulfone** 2% GR (Granules) can be applied at 20-30 kg per acre, broadcast and incorporated into the soil around the plants, followed by irrigation.
        *   Alternatively, **Oxamyl** 24% SL (Soluble Liquid) can be used as a soil drench at 1.5-2.0 ml per litre of water around the root zone.

### General Advice and Safety Precautions:

*   **Integrated Pest Management (IPM):** Always combine cultural, biological, and chemical methods for sustainable and effective pest control.
*   **Soil Health:** Maintain good soil health through regular addition of organic matter, proper drainage, and balanced nutrition to enhance plant vigor and resistance.
*   **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your Jasmine plants for early signs of pest infestation to take timely action.
*   **Safety First:** When using any chemical pesticide, always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (gloves, mask, eye protection) and follow the instructions and safety precautions mentioned on the product label strictly. Keep chemicals out of reach of children and livestock.
*   **Consult Local Experts:** For specific recommendations tailored to your exact field conditions, it is always advisable to consult with the local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts.

By implementing these measures, you can effectively manage soil pests in your Jasmine cultivation and ensure healthy, productive plants.
