Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing rot diseases in Jasmine cultivation in Haryana.

Rot diseases in Jasmine are primarily caused by various soil-borne fungal and oomycete pathogens, often exacerbated by poor drainage and excessive moisture.

Here's how to control different types of rot in Jasmine:

**1. Rot Types Affecting Jasmine (Root, Stem, Foot, Collar, Crown, Neck Rot):**
These are common manifestations of rot in Jasmine, often caused by pathogens like *Phytophthora*, *Pythium*, *Rhizoctonia*, and *Sclerotium* species. They affect the plant at or below the soil line, leading to wilting, yellowing, and eventual plant death.

**2. Black Rot:**
While rot symptoms can cause blackening of tissues, "Black Rot" as a specific disease name is not commonly associated with Jasmine in the same way it is for other crops (e.g., grapes, crucifers). However, any severe rot can lead to black discoloration. The control measures for general root/stem/collar rot will address such symptoms.

**3. Fruit Rot:**
This is not known to be a primary concern or a significant disease affecting Jasmine cultivation, as the plant is primarily grown for its flowers, and its small fruits are not typically harvested or consumed.

**4. Seed Rot and Seedling Rot:**
Jasmine is predominantly propagated vegetatively through cuttings in commercial cultivation. Therefore, seed rot and seedling rot (damping-off) are not primary concerns for typical Jasmine growers. If you are propagating by seed, ensure sterile potting mix and proper moisture management.

**Integrated Management Strategy for Rot Diseases in Jasmine (Root, Stem, Foot, Collar, Crown, Neck Rot):**

Effective control involves a combination of cultural practices and judicious use of CIBRC-approved fungicides.

**A. Cultural and Preventive Measures (Most Important):**

1.  **Site Selection and Soil Preparation:**
    *   Choose well-drained soil. Avoid heavy clay soils prone to waterlogging.
    *   Improve soil drainage by incorporating organic matter (e.g., well-rotted farmyard manure) and sand if necessary.
    *   Plant on raised beds or mounds, especially in areas with poor drainage.

2.  **Irrigation Management:**
    *   Avoid overwatering. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the topsoil to dry out between irrigations.
    *   Ensure proper drainage around the base of the plants.

3.  **Sanitation:**
    *   Remove and destroy all infected plant parts (leaves, stems, roots) immediately to prevent disease spread.
    *   Sterilize pruning tools with a 10% bleach solution or rubbing alcohol after use on infected plants.
    *   Use healthy, disease-free planting material (cuttings).

4.  **Planting Density and Air Circulation:**
    *   Maintain adequate spacing between plants to ensure good air circulation, which helps in drying the soil surface and reducing humidity around the plant base.

5.  **Nutrition:**
    *   Provide balanced nutrition. Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can promote lush, tender growth more susceptible to disease.

6.  **Soil Solarization:**
    *   For nursery beds or small areas, soil solarization during hot summer months can help reduce the inoculum of soil-borne pathogens.

**B. Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved Fungicides for Haryana):**

For existing infections or as a preventive measure in high-risk areas, the following CIBRC-approved fungicides can be used as soil drench applications. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions.

1.  **For Oomycete Rots (*Phytophthora*, *Pythium*):**
    *   **Propamocarb Hydrochloride** (e.g., 2-3 ml/L of water as a soil drench around the base of the plant).
    *   **Metalaxyl + Mancozeb** (e.g., 2-2.5 g/L of water as a soil drench).
    *   **Fosetyl-Al** (e.g., 2-3 g/L of water as a soil drench).

2.  **For Fungal Rots (*Rhizoctonia*, *Sclerotium*):**
    *   **Carbendazim** (e.g., 1-1.5 g/L of water as a soil drench).
    *   **Thiophenate Methyl** (e.g., 1-1.5 g/L of water as a soil drench).
    *   **Validamycin** (e.g., 2-3 ml/L of water as a soil drench, particularly effective against *Rhizoctonia*).
    *   **Pencycuron** (e.g., 0.5-1 g/L of water as a soil drench, specific for *Rhizoctonia*).

**Application Guidelines:**
*   Apply fungicides as a drench around the base of the plant, ensuring the solution penetrates the root zone.
*   Repeat applications may be necessary based on disease severity and product label recommendations.
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

**Recommendation:**
Always prioritize cultural practices as the first line of defense. Chemical control should be used judiciously and as part of an integrated disease management strategy. For specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions, it is advisable to consult with the local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts.
