As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Jasmine:

### Grasshopper

Grasshoppers are general feeders and can cause damage to Jasmine by feeding on leaves and young shoots.

**Control Measures:**

1.  **Cultural Control:** For small infestations, hand-picking and destroying grasshoppers can be effective, especially in the early morning when they are less active.
2.  **Chemical Control:** In case of severe infestation, chemical intervention may be necessary.
    *   Spray with **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at a concentration of 0.5 ml per litre of water. Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.

### Painted bug (Bagrada hilaris)

This is not known to affect Jasmine. Painted bugs are primarily pests of cruciferous crops (e.g., mustard, cabbage).

### Red cotton bug (Dysdercus cingulatus)

This is not known to affect Jasmine. Red cotton bugs are primarily pests of cotton and other malvaceous plants, feeding on developing seeds.

### Black Ants

Black ants themselves generally do not directly damage Jasmine plants by feeding on them. However, they are often associated with sap-sucking pests like aphids, mealybugs, and scale insects, as they feed on the honeydew secreted by these pests. They protect these sap-suckers from natural enemies, thus exacerbating the primary pest problem. They can also be a nuisance.

**Control Measures:**

1.  **Identify and Control Primary Pests:** If ants are present on Jasmine, inspect the plant for sap-sucking pests (aphids, mealybugs, scale insects). Controlling these primary pests will eliminate the ants' food source (honeydew), causing them to disperse.
2.  **Direct Ant Control:**
    *   **Perimeter Spray/Spot Treatment:** Spray the base of the plant, ant trails, and entry points with **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at a concentration of 2.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Baits:** Granular ant baits containing active ingredients like **Fipronil** can be placed around the base of the plant or along ant trails. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions for application rates and safety.
