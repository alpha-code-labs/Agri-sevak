As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding rust diseases in Jasmine:

*   **Black Rust (Stem Rust), Brown Rust (Leaf Rust), and Yellow Rust (Stripe Rust):** These specific rust diseases, primarily caused by *Puccinia* species, are not known to affect Jasmine. They are typically diseases of cereal crops like wheat and barley.

*   **White Rust:** This condition, caused by *Albugo* species, is not known to affect Jasmine as a significant disease. It primarily affects cruciferous plants and some other specific hosts.

*   **Red Rust:** This condition, caused by the parasitic alga *Cephaleuros virescens*, **is known to affect Jasmine**, particularly in warm, humid conditions. It manifests as reddish-brown, velvety spots on leaves and stems. While not a true fungal rust, it is commonly referred to as "Red Rust" due to its appearance.

**Control Measures for Red Rust (*Cephaleuros virescens*) in Jasmine:**

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Pruning:** Regularly inspect plants and promptly remove and destroy all infected leaves and stems to reduce the source of inoculum.
*   **Air Circulation:** Ensure good air circulation around the plants by proper spacing and judicious pruning of dense canopy. This helps to reduce humidity within the plant.
*   **Watering:** Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day, as prolonged leaf wetness promotes algal growth. Water at the base of the plant in the morning.
*   **Sanitation:** Keep the area around the plants free of weeds and plant debris, which can harbor pathogens and maintain humidity.

**2. Chemical Control:**
For severe infestations, fungicidal sprays can be applied. Copper-based fungicides are effective against this algal pathogen.
*   **Copper Oxychloride** (50% WP): Apply at a concentration of 2.5-3.0 grams per litre of water.
*   **Copper Hydroxide** (77% WP): Apply at a concentration of 1.5-2.0 grams per litre of water.

Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage, especially the undersides of leaves. Repeat applications may be necessary at 10-14 day intervals, depending on disease severity and prevailing weather conditions. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions on the product label.
