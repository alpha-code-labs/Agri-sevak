As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for managing fungal diseases in Jasmine in Haryana.

**General Cultural Practices for Fungal Disease Management:**
Implementing good cultural practices is the first line of defense against most fungal diseases:
*   **Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy all infected plant parts (leaves, twigs, flowers, fallen debris) to reduce the source of fungal inoculum.
*   **Pruning:** Prune jasmine plants to ensure good air circulation within the canopy. This helps reduce humidity, which is favorable for fungal growth.
*   **Spacing:** Maintain adequate plant spacing to prevent overcrowding, which can lead to poor air circulation and increased humidity.
*   **Watering:** Water plants at the base in the morning. Avoid overhead irrigation, especially in the evening, to allow foliage to dry quickly. Wet foliage for extended periods promotes fungal development.
*   **Nutrition:** Provide balanced nutrition to enhance plant vigor and natural resistance. Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can promote lush, succulent growth that is more susceptible to certain diseases.

**Specific Fungal Diseases and Their Control:**

1.  **Alternaria Leaf Spot (Caused by *Alternaria jasmini*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Small, circular to irregular brown spots with characteristic concentric rings, often surrounded by a yellow halo, primarily on leaves. Severe infection can lead to premature defoliation.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   **Cultural:** Implement general cultural practices as mentioned above.
        *   **Chemical:**
            *   Spray with **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water.
            *   Alternatively, use **Chlorothalonil** at 2 g/L of water.
            *   For systemic action, **Propiconazole** at 0.5 ml/L of water can be effective.
            *   A combination product containing **Azoxystrobin + Difenoconazole** can also be used at 1 ml/L of water.

2.  **Anthracnose (Caused by *Colletotrichum gloeosporioides*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Irregular, dark brown to black spots on leaves, stems, and flowers. Lesions may coalesce, leading to blight and dieback of twigs. Sunken lesions on stems are characteristic.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   **Cultural:** Remove and destroy infected plant parts promptly. Ensure good air circulation through proper pruning.
        *   **Chemical:**
            *   Apply **Carbendazim** at 1 g/L of water.
            *   Alternatively, spray **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water.
            *   **Copper Oxychloride** at 3 g/L of water can also be used, especially as a protective spray.
            *   **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5 ml/L of water provides good control.

3.  **Blight and Brown Spot (Primarily caused by *Cercospora jasminicola* and other fungi)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Blight refers to the rapid browning and death of plant tissues. Brown spot typically manifests as distinct brown lesions on leaves, which can enlarge and coalesce, leading to blight-like symptoms and defoliation.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   **Cultural:** Remove infected leaves and debris. Improve air circulation and reduce canopy wetness.
        *   **Chemical:**
            *   Spray with **Carbendazim** at 1 g/L of water.
            *   **Chlorothalonil** at 2 g/L of water is also effective.
            *   **Tebuconazole** at 0.75 ml/L of water can provide systemic protection.
            *   **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water can be used as a protective spray.

4.  **Powdery Mildew (Caused by *Oidium jasmini* or other *Oidium* species)**
    *   **Symptoms:** White, powdery patches on the surface of leaves, young stems, and flower buds. Infected leaves may become distorted, yellow, and drop prematurely.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   **Cultural:** Ensure good air circulation and avoid excessive humidity.
        *   **Chemical:**
            *   Apply **Wettable Sulphur** at 2.5 g/L of water, especially in early stages or as a preventive.
            *   For systemic control, spray **Hexaconazole** at 0.5 ml/L of water.
            *   Alternatively, **Myclobutanil** at 0.5 g/L of water is highly effective.
            *   **Penconazole** at 0.5 ml/L of water can also be used.

**Diseases Not Known to Affect Jasmine:**

*   **Blast:** This is not known to affect Jasmine.
*   **Downy Mildew:** This is not known to affect Jasmine.
*   **Grey Mildew:** This is not known to affect Jasmine.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the pesticide label for correct dosage, application method, pre-harvest interval, and safety precautions.
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of fungicide resistance in pathogens.
*   Apply fungicides proactively during periods conducive to disease development or at the first sign of symptoms for best results.
*   For specific local conditions and further guidance, it is always advisable to consult with your local agricultural extension services.
