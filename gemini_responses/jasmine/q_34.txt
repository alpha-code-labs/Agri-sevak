The direct application of most weedicides/herbicides on Jasmine (Jasminum spp.) plants can cause significant phytotoxicity, leading to leaf yellowing, scorching, stunted growth, and reduced flowering. The primary approach to mitigate these harmful effects is prevention and the adoption of non-chemical weed management strategies.

Here's how to reduce the harmful effects:

**I. Prioritize Non-Chemical Weed Management (Recommended Approach):**

*   **Manual Weeding:** This is the most effective and safest method to remove weeds from Jasmine beds without any risk of herbicide damage. Regular hand weeding or hoeing keeps the area clean.
*   **Mulching:** Applying a layer of organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves, wood chips, paddy husk) around the base of Jasmine plants can effectively suppress weed growth, conserve soil moisture, and regulate soil temperature, thereby reducing the need for herbicides.

**II. If Herbicide Use is Absolutely Necessary (for inter-row weeds, NOT ON JASMINE):**

If herbicides must be used for weed control in pathways or inter-row spaces, extreme caution is paramount to prevent any contact with Jasmine plants. No herbicide is generally recommended for direct application *on* Jasmine plants for weed control.

*   **A. Herbicide Selection:**
    *   For general weed control in non-cropped areas or inter-row spaces, non-selective herbicides can be used, but with utmost care. An example of a CIBRC approved non-selective herbicide is **Glyphosate**.
    *   **Important Note:** Always ensure the chosen herbicide is approved for use in India by CIBRC and strictly follow its label instructions.

*   **B. Application Techniques to Prevent Damage:**
    *   **Shielded Spraying:** Use protective shields or hoods on spray nozzles to prevent the herbicide from drifting onto Jasmine plants.
    *   **Spot Application / Wick Applicator:** Apply the herbicide directly onto the target weeds using a spot sprayer or a wick applicator (which wipes the herbicide onto weeds), ensuring no contact with Jasmine foliage or stems.
    *   **Drift Control:**
        *   Apply herbicides on calm days with minimal wind (ideally wind speed less than 8 km/h) to prevent spray drift.
        *   Use low-pressure sprayers with large droplet nozzles (e.g., flat fan nozzles) to minimize fine mist that can drift.
        *   Keep the spray boom or nozzle as close to the ground as possible.
    *   **Correct Dosage:** Always adhere strictly to the manufacturer's recommended dosage rates (e.g., ml/L or kg/acre). Overdosing increases the risk of phytotoxicity to non-target plants and environmental contamination.
    *   **Timing:** Apply herbicides when Jasmine plants are not under stress (e.g., drought, nutrient deficiency) as stressed plants can be more susceptible to damage.

**III. Post-Exposure Management (if accidental contact occurs):**

If Jasmine plants accidentally come into contact with a herbicide, immediate action can help reduce the damage:

*   **Immediate Washing:** If caught immediately after accidental spraying, thoroughly wash the affected parts of the Jasmine plant with clean water to dilute and remove the herbicide residue.
*   **Nutritional Support:** Apply foliar sprays of micronutrients (e.g., Zinc, Iron, Manganese) or a balanced NPK fertilizer to help the plant recover from stress and promote new growth.
*   **Pruning:** Carefully prune and remove severely damaged leaves or shoots to encourage the plant to produce new, healthy growth.
*   **Adequate Irrigation:** Ensure the plant receives adequate irrigation. This can help dilute any herbicide that may have reached the soil and support the plant's overall recovery process.
