Mites, including Red Spider Mite (Tetranychus urticae) and various species of Rust Mites (Eriophyidae family), can cause significant damage to Jasmine plants, leading to reduced vigour, poor flowering, and aesthetic decline. Effective control requires an integrated approach combining cultural practices and judicious use of CIBRC-approved acaricides.

**1. Identification:**

*   **Red Spider Mite:** Look for fine webbing, especially on the underside of leaves. Leaves may show stippling (tiny yellow or white dots), bronzing, or yellowing. The mites themselves are tiny, reddish-brown, and visible with a magnifying glass on the leaf surface.
*   **Rust Mite:** These mites are microscopic and not visible to the naked eye. Symptoms include bronzing, russeting, or browning of leaves, particularly on the underside, and distortion or curling of new growth.

**2. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**

*   **Water Spray:** Regularly spray the underside of leaves with a strong jet of water. This can physically dislodge spider mites and help reduce their populations, especially in early stages of infestation.
*   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy heavily infested leaves or branches to reduce the mite population and prevent further spread.
*   **Sanitation:** Keep the area around Jasmine plants free of weeds, as weeds can serve as alternate hosts for mites.
*   **Adequate Watering:** Ensure plants are well-watered. Water-stressed plants are more susceptible to mite infestations.
*   **Avoid Excessive Nitrogen:** High nitrogen fertilization can promote lush, soft growth that is more attractive to mites.

**3. Chemical Control (Acaricides):**

For moderate to severe infestations, chemical control using CIBRC-approved acaricides is necessary. It is crucial to rotate different classes of acaricides to prevent the development of resistance. Always ensure thorough coverage, especially on the underside of leaves where mites primarily reside.

Here are some recommended acaricides:

*   **For Red Spider Mite and Rust Mite:**
    *   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** Apply at 0.5 - 1 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Abamectin 1.9% EC:** Apply at 0.3 - 0.5 ml per litre of water.

*   **Primarily for Red Spider Mite:**
    *   **Propargite 57% EC:** Apply at 1 - 1.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Fenpyroximate 5% SC:** Apply at 0.5 - 1 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Etoxazole 10% SC:** Apply at 0.5 ml per litre of water. (This is a mite growth regulator, effective on eggs and nymphs, and good for resistance management).
    *   **Pyridaben 20% WP:** Apply at 0.5 - 1 g per litre of water.

*   **Primarily for Rust Mite (and some effect on Red Spider Mite):**
    *   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP:** Apply at 2 - 3 g per litre of water. (Note: Do not apply sulphur when temperatures are very high, i.e., above 30-32°C, as it can cause phytotoxicity).

**Important Considerations for Application:**

*   **Rotation:** To prevent mites from developing resistance, always rotate between acaricides with different modes of action. For example, use Spiromesifen for one spray, then Abamectin for the next, and Propargite for a subsequent spray if needed.
*   **Coverage:** Mites primarily reside on the underside of leaves. Ensure the spray thoroughly covers these areas for maximum efficacy.
*   **Repeat Application:** Mite eggs are often resistant to acaricides. A second application 7-10 days after the first may be necessary to target newly hatched mites and break the life cycle.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, mask, and eye protection while handling and spraying chemicals. Follow the instructions and safety precautions mentioned on the product label.
*   **Timing:** Early detection and intervention are crucial for effective mite control. Regular scouting of your Jasmine plants will help identify infestations before they become severe.
