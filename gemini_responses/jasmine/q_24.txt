As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified practices for the ideal transplantation of Jasmine in Haryana:

**1. Ideal Transplantation Time:**
The most suitable times for transplanting Jasmine in Haryana are:
*   **Monsoon Season:** July to August, as the increased humidity and moderate temperatures aid in better establishment of the young plants.
*   **Post-Monsoon/Autumn:** September to October, when the intense heat has subsided, and the soil retains moisture.
*   **Late Winter/Early Spring:** February to March, before the onset of the scorching summer heat, allowing plants to establish before stress.

**2. Ideal Transplantation Distance:**
The spacing depends on the variety and the intended purpose (e.g., individual plants, hedge, commercial cultivation). For most common Jasmine varieties grown in Haryana, such as *Jasminum sambac* (Mogra) or *Jasminum grandiflorum* (Chameli), a spacing that allows for optimal growth, air circulation, and management is crucial:
*   **For individual plants or commercial cultivation:** A spacing of **1.5 meters x 1.5 meters** to **2 meters x 2 meters** is generally recommended. This allows for good canopy development and ease of cultural operations.
*   **For hedges:** Plants can be spaced closer, typically **1 meter** apart in a row, with rows spaced **1.5 meters** apart.

**3. Ideal Transplantation Process:**
A meticulous transplantation process ensures better survival and establishment of Jasmine plants:

*   **Preparation of Planting Material:**
    *   Use healthy, well-rooted cuttings or saplings from a reputable nursery. Ensure the root ball is intact and free from pests or diseases.

*   **Site Selection and Soil Preparation:**
    *   Choose a location that receives at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily.
    *   Jasmine thrives in well-drained, fertile loamy soil with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.5.
    *   Dig pits of approximately **45 cm x 45 cm x 45 cm** (length x width x depth) at the recommended spacing.
    *   Amend the excavated soil by mixing it with well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost at a ratio of 1:1 or 1:2 (soil:organic matter). Approximately **5-10 kg** of FYM per pit is beneficial.

*   **Planting:**
    *   Carefully remove the plant from its nursery bag or container, ensuring the root ball remains undisturbed.
    *   Place the plant in the center of the prepared pit, ensuring that the top of the root ball is level with or slightly below the surrounding ground surface.
    *   Backfill the pit with the amended soil, gently firming it around the base of the plant to remove air pockets.
    *   Create a small basin around the plant to help retain water.

*   **Initial Watering:**
    *   Immediately after planting, thoroughly water the plant until the soil is saturated. This helps settle the soil around the roots.

*   **Post-Transplantation Care:**
    *   **Watering:** Maintain consistent moisture, especially during the establishment phase. Water regularly, but avoid waterlogging.
    *   **Mulching:** Apply a layer of organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves, wood chips) around the base of the plant to conserve soil moisture, regulate soil temperature, and suppress weeds.
    *   **Support:** For climbing varieties, provide a trellis, stake, or other support structure at the time of planting.
    *   **Protection:** Protect young plants from strong winds or intense direct sun immediately after transplanting if necessary, though Jasmine is generally hardy.
