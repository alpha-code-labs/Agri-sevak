As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling diseases in Jasmine:

**1. Dieback in Jasmine:**
Dieback in Jasmine is characterized by the progressive death of twigs and branches, starting from the tip downwards. It is often caused by fungal pathogens and can be exacerbated by environmental stress.

*   **Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
    *   **Pruning:** Regularly inspect plants and promptly prune off all affected branches well below the visible diseased portion. Ensure clean cuts.
    *   **Sanitation:** Collect and destroy all pruned material to prevent further spread of inoculum.
    *   **Tool Sterilization:** Sterilize pruning tools with a 10% bleach solution or rubbing alcohol after each cut, especially when moving between plants, to prevent disease transmission.
    *   **Plant Health:** Ensure proper plant nutrition, adequate drainage, and avoid waterlogging or severe drought stress, as stressed plants are more susceptible.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   After pruning, apply a protective fungicide spray.
    *   **Carbendazim** at 0.5-1 g per litre of water.
    *   **Propiconazole** at 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Mancozeb** at 2-2.5 g per litre of water can be used as a protective spray, especially during humid conditions.
    *   For severe cases, a combination or rotation of systemic and contact fungicides can be beneficial. For instance, an initial spray of **Carbendazim** followed by **Mancozeb** after 10-15 days.

**2. Twig Blight in Jasmine:**
Twig blight in Jasmine presents with symptoms similar to dieback, involving the browning and death of twigs, often starting from the tip or at nodes, and can sometimes lead to canker formation. It is also primarily caused by fungal pathogens.

*   **Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
    *   **Pruning:** As with dieback, promptly remove and destroy all infected twigs and branches. Prune well into healthy wood.
    *   **Sanitation:** Clear fallen leaves and plant debris from around the base of the plants to reduce fungal inoculum.
    *   **Air Circulation:** Ensure adequate spacing between plants and prune for good air circulation within the canopy to reduce humidity, which favors fungal growth.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Fungicide applications are similar to those for dieback.
    *   **Copper Oxychloride** at 2.5-3 g per litre of water can be effective as a protective and curative spray.
    *   **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5-1 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Carbendazim** at 0.5-1 g per litre of water.
    *   Repeat applications may be necessary, especially during periods conducive to disease development, following label instructions for spray intervals.

**3. Tikka disease in Jasmine:**
This is not known to affect Jasmine. "Tikka disease" specifically refers to a leaf spot disease primarily affecting groundnut (peanut) caused by *Cercospora arachidicola* and *Cercosporidium personatum*.
