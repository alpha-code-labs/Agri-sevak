As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding "dropping" in Jasmine:

1.  **Fruit drop in Jasmine:** Jasmine (Jasminum spp.) is primarily cultivated for its fragrant flowers. While it does produce small berries (fruits), "fruit drop" is not a significant economic concern or a commonly reported problem in commercial jasmine cultivation. If observed, it is usually due to the same environmental or physiological stresses that cause flower drop, or simply natural senescence. Therefore, specific control measures for "fruit drop" in jasmine are generally not required.

2.  **Tinda/Boll dropping in Jasmine:** This is not known to affect Jasmine. "Tinda" refers to a type of gourd (Praecitrullus fistulosus), and "boll dropping" is a phenomenon associated with cotton (Gossypium spp.). These conditions are entirely irrelevant to Jasmine.

3.  **Flower drop in Jasmine:** Flower drop is the primary concern under the general term "dropping" for Jasmine. It can significantly reduce yield and quality.

**Causes of Flower Drop in Jasmine:**
Flower drop in Jasmine can be attributed to a combination of factors:
*   **Environmental Stress:** Extreme temperatures (very high or very low), water stress (drought or waterlogging), high humidity, or strong winds.
*   **Nutritional Deficiencies:** Lack of essential micronutrients like Boron and Calcium, or an imbalance of macronutrients.
*   **Pest Infestations:** Sucking pests like thrips and mites can damage flower buds and open flowers, leading to their premature drop.
*   **Physiological Factors:** Natural senescence of older flowers, hormonal imbalances within the plant, or poor pollination.
*   **Cultural Practices:** Improper irrigation, inadequate fertilization, or lack of timely pruning.

**Control Measures for Flower Drop in Jasmine:**

An integrated approach combining cultural practices, pest management, and judicious use of plant growth regulators is recommended.

**A. Cultural and Agronomic Practices (Preventive):**
*   **Water Management:** Ensure consistent and adequate irrigation, especially during flowering. Avoid both waterlogging and severe drought stress.
*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Apply balanced fertilizers based on soil test recommendations.
    *   Foliar application of micronutrients, particularly Boron (e.g., Borax @ 1-1.5 g/L of water) and Calcium (e.g., Calcium Nitrate @ 2-3 g/L of water), can be beneficial if deficiencies are suspected.
*   **Pruning:** Regular and timely pruning helps maintain plant vigor, promotes new growth, and encourages better flowering.
*   **Weed Control:** Keep the area around plants free of weeds to reduce competition for nutrients and water.

**B. Pest Management (if pests are causing damage leading to drop):**
If sucking pests like thrips or mites are observed damaging buds and flowers, leading to drop, consider the following CIBRC approved insecticides/acaricides:
*   **For Thrips:**
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL @ 0.5-1 ml/L of water.
    *   **Fipronil** 5% SC @ 1-1.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP @ 0.2-0.4 g/L of water.
*   **For Mites:**
    *   **Spiromesifen** 22.9% SC @ 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Propargite** 57% EC @ 1-1.5 ml/L of water.

**C. Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs) (for physiological flower drop):**
To reduce physiological flower drop and improve flower retention, plant growth regulators can be used:
*   **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA):** Apply **NAA** (e.g., 4.5% SL formulation) @ 10-20 ppm (parts per million). This translates to approximately 0.2-0.4 ml per litre of water for a 4.5% SL formulation.
    *   Apply at the bud initiation stage or when flower drop is first observed. Repeat if necessary, following product label instructions.

Always read and follow the instructions on the product label for safe and effective application.
