As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for managing growth issues in Jasmine plants in Haryana:

It is important to first identify the specific cause of the growth issue, as management strategies vary. Regular observation of your plants and soil conditions is crucial.

### 1. Slow Growth

Slow growth in Jasmine can be attributed to several factors, including nutrient deficiencies, poor soil health, inadequate sunlight, improper watering, or incorrect soil pH.

**Management:**

*   **Soil Health and pH:** Ensure well-drained soil with good organic matter content. Jasmine prefers a slightly acidic to neutral pH (6.0-7.0). If your soil is highly alkaline, consider incorporating organic matter or elemental sulfur to gradually lower the pH.
*   **Sunlight:** Jasmine requires at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily for optimal growth. Ensure your plants are not shaded.
*   **Watering:** Provide consistent watering, especially during dry periods. Avoid both waterlogging and drought stress.
*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Balanced Fertilization:** Apply a balanced NPK (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium) fertilizer. For general slow growth, a granular NPK 19:19:19 or similar can be applied to the soil.
    *   **Nitrogen (N) for Vegetative Growth:** If overall growth is stunted and leaves are pale green, a nitrogen boost may be beneficial.
        *   **Urea:** Apply 10-20 g per plant (for mature plants) every 4-6 weeks during the growing season, or use a foliar spray of 10-15 g/L water.
    *   **Micronutrients:** If a general deficiency is suspected, a foliar spray of a complete micronutrient mixture can be applied.
        *   **Chelated Micronutrient Mixture:** Use as per product label, typically 1-2 g/L water.

### 2. Yellow Growth (Chlorosis)

Yellowing of leaves (chlorosis) often indicates a nutrient deficiency, most commonly iron or nitrogen, but can also be due to magnesium or sulfur deficiency, or high soil pH leading to nutrient unavailability.

**Management:**

*   **Identify Deficiency:**
    *   **Nitrogen Deficiency:** Older leaves turn uniformly yellow first.
    *   **Iron Deficiency:** Younger leaves show interveinal yellowing (veins remain green). Common in alkaline soils.
    *   **Magnesium Deficiency:** Older leaves show interveinal yellowing, often starting from the margins.
*   **Nutrient Application:**
    *   **For Nitrogen Deficiency:**
        *   **Urea:** Apply 10-20 g per plant (for mature plants) to the soil, or a foliar spray of 10-15 g/L water.
    *   **For Iron Deficiency (most common in Haryana's alkaline soils):**
        *   **Ferrous EDTA (Iron Chelate):** For foliar application, use 0.5-1 g/L water. For soil application, apply 5-10 kg/acre, or 5-10 g per plant mixed with soil.
    *   **For Magnesium Deficiency:**
        *   **Magnesium Sulfate:** For foliar application, use 2-5 g/L water. For soil application, apply 10-20 kg/acre, or 10-20 g per plant.
*   **Soil pH Correction:** If high soil pH is the root cause, incorporate organic matter or elemental sulfur to gradually lower the pH and improve nutrient availability.

### 3. Excessive Height

Excessive height, often accompanied by sparse foliage or reduced flowering, can result from over-fertilization with nitrogen, insufficient pruning, or the plant stretching for light.

**Management:**

*   **Pruning:** Regular and timely pruning is essential for Jasmine.
    *   **Formative Pruning:** Prune young plants to encourage branching and a bushy habit.
    *   **Maintenance Pruning:** After the main flowering season, prune back spent flower stalks and overgrown branches by about one-third to one-half to maintain shape, promote new growth, and encourage future flowering.
*   **Fertilization Adjustment:** Reduce nitrogen application if excessive vegetative growth is observed. Focus on balanced NPK fertilizers or those with higher phosphorus and potassium during flowering periods.
*   **Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs):** For commercial cultivation or specific landscape requirements, PGRs can be used to control height.
    *   **Paclobutrazol:** This growth retardant can reduce internode length, leading to more compact growth. Apply as a soil drench at 0.5-1 ml/L water per plant (adjust based on plant size and product concentration) or as a foliar spray at 0.5-1 ml/L water. Always follow product-specific instructions carefully, as overdose can be detrimental.
    *   **Chlormequat Chloride:** Another growth retardant that can be used as a foliar spray at 1-2 ml/L water to reduce stem elongation.

### 4. Excessive Flowering

While generally a desirable trait for Jasmine, if "excessive flowering" leads to plant weakening or reduced vigor, it might indicate stress or an imbalance. However, it is rarely a problem that requires suppression.

**Management:**

*   **Nutrient Balance:** Ensure the plant receives a balanced diet. While phosphorus and potassium promote flowering, an overall healthy plant with adequate nitrogen will sustain vigorous growth and flowering without exhaustion.
*   **Post-Flowering Care:** After a heavy flush of flowers, provide adequate water and a balanced fertilizer to help the plant recover and prepare for the next flowering cycle.
*   **Pruning:** Pruning spent flowers and branches after a heavy bloom can redirect the plant's energy into new vegetative growth, which will then produce more flowers in the next cycle.
*   **Stress Reduction:** Ensure optimal growing conditions (water, sunlight, soil health) to prevent stress-induced flowering that might weaken the plant.

Always consult the specific product labels for precise application rates and safety precautions for any chemical used. For further specific advice, you may contact the Department of Horticulture at HAU, Hisar.
