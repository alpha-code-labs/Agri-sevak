As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified recommendations for the use of growth regulators and Boron in Jasmine cultivation in Haryana:

It is crucial to use these chemicals precisely as recommended, as incorrect dosages can lead to adverse effects on the plant. Always ensure thorough coverage during foliar sprays.

*   **Ethephon**
    *   **Purpose:** To induce uniform flowering and promote early flowering in Jasmine.
    *   **Recommended Dose:** Apply a foliar spray of **Ethephon** at 250-500 ppm (parts per million). This translates to approximately 0.75 - 1.25 ml of 40% **Ethephon** formulation per litre of water.
    *   **Timing:** Apply during the pre-flowering stage, typically 45-60 days before the expected flowering period, or after pruning to encourage a flush of uniform blooms.

*   **2,4-D**
    *   **Recommendation:** This is not recommended as a growth regulator for Jasmine. **2,4-D** is primarily a selective herbicide, and its use as a growth regulator in ornamental plants like Jasmine carries a very high risk of phytotoxicity (plant damage) even at slightly elevated concentrations. Its application for growth regulation in Jasmine is not a standard or recommended practice by HAU.

*   **Boron**
    *   **Purpose:** Boron is an essential micronutrient vital for pollen germination, pollen tube growth, cell wall formation, sugar transport, and overall flower development and fruit set (though Jasmine is grown for flowers). Boron deficiency can lead to poor flowering and reduced flower quality.
    *   **Recommended Dose:** Apply a foliar spray of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (a soluble source of Boron) at a concentration of 1.0 - 1.5 grams per litre of water.
    *   **Timing:** Apply during the active vegetative growth phase and again at the pre-flowering stage to ensure adequate Boron availability for optimal flower development.
