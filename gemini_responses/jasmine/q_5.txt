As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned conditions in Jasmine in Haryana:

### Control of Scab, Canker, Gummosis, and Lichen in Jasmine

**1. Scab:**
This is not known to affect Jasmine.

**2. Canker:**
While a specific "Canker disease" is not a primary, well-documented disease of Jasmine, stem dieback and lesions, which can appear canker-like, can occur due to various fungal pathogens (e.g., *Lasiodiplodia theobromae*, *Fusarium* species) or sometimes bacterial infections. These symptoms are often associated with plant stress, mechanical injury, or poor cultural practices.

**Control Measures:**
*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Pruning:** Immediately prune and destroy all affected branches, cutting well below the visible symptoms into healthy wood. Sterilize pruning tools with a 10% bleach solution or alcohol between cuts to prevent spread.
    *   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy all plant debris from around the base of the plants.
    *   **Avoid Injury:** Be careful during cultivation and harvesting to avoid wounding the plants, as wounds serve as entry points for pathogens.
    *   **Proper Nutrition and Irrigation:** Ensure the plants are well-nourished and receive adequate, but not excessive, water to reduce stress.
*   **Chemical Control (for fungal causes of stem dieback/lesions):**
    *   After pruning, apply a protective fungicidal paste or spray to the cut surfaces and remaining healthy stems.
    *   **For paste on cut surfaces:** Mix **Copper Oxychloride** at 50 g per litre of water to make a thick paste and apply immediately after pruning.
    *   **For foliar spray/drench:**
        *   Spray with **Carbendazim** at 0.5-1 g/L of water.
        *   Alternatively, spray with **Thiophanate Methyl** at 0.5-1 g/L of water.
    *   Ensure thorough coverage of the plant, especially the stem and branch junctions. Repeat sprays may be necessary based on disease severity and environmental conditions, following label instructions.

**3. Gummosis:**
This is not known to affect Jasmine.

**4. Lichen:**
Lichens are symbiotic organisms (a fungus and an alga) that grow on the bark of trees and shrubs. They are generally epiphytic and non-parasitic, meaning they do not directly harm the Jasmine plant by drawing nutrients from it. Their presence often indicates good air quality and can be a sign of a healthy, mature plant or one that is growing slowly.

**Control Measures:**
*   **No Chemical Control Recommended:** Chemical sprays are generally not necessary or recommended for lichens as they are not a disease or pest.
*   **Cultural Practices (if removal is desired for aesthetic reasons):**
    *   **Improve Air Circulation:** Prune surrounding vegetation to improve air circulation around the Jasmine plants, which can make conditions less favourable for lichen growth.
    *   **Gentle Scrubbing:** For aesthetic reasons, lichens can sometimes be gently scrubbed off the bark with a soft brush and water, especially on older, woody stems. Be careful not to damage the bark.
    *   **Promote Vigorous Growth:** Ensure the plant is healthy and growing vigorously through proper fertilization and irrigation. A rapidly growing plant may shed bark more frequently, naturally reducing lichen accumulation.
