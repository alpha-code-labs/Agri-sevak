As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified cultivation practices for Jasmine in Haryana:

Jasmine (primarily *Jasminum sambac* and *Jasminum grandiflorum* for commercial cultivation) is predominantly propagated vegetatively. Seed propagation is not commercially viable due to poor germination, genetic variability, and a longer time to flowering.

**1. Sowing Method/Pattern:**
Jasmine is propagated through vegetative methods. The most common and recommended methods are:
*   **Semi-hardwood Cuttings:** This is the most popular and efficient method. Cuttings of 15-20 cm length with 3-4 nodes are taken from healthy, mature, non-flowering shoots. These are often treated with rooting hormones (e.g., Indole-3-butyric acid - IBA at 2,000-4,000 ppm) before planting in nursery beds or polybags.
*   **Layering:** Ground layering or air layering can also be successfully employed, particularly for *Jasminum grandiflorum*.
*   **Suckers:** Healthy suckers arising from the base of established plants can be carefully separated and planted.

The planting pattern in the main field is typically a square or rectangular system to facilitate inter-cultural operations, irrigation, and harvesting.

**2. Planting Depth:**
*   **For Cuttings:** When planting rooted cuttings or treated semi-hardwood cuttings, approximately 2/3 of the cutting length (about 10-15 cm) should be buried in the soil, ensuring at least one node is below the soil surface for optimal root development.
*   **For Layered Plants/Suckers:** Plant them at the same depth as they were growing on the mother plant, ensuring the entire root ball is fully covered with soil and the stem base is at the soil surface level.

**3. Spacing:**
Optimal spacing is crucial for proper plant growth, air circulation, light penetration, and maximizing yield. The recommended spacing varies slightly depending on the Jasmine species and the training system:
*   **For *Jasminum sambac* (Mogra/Motia):** A spacing of 1.5 meters between rows and 1.0 meter between plants (1.5 m x 1.0 m) is generally recommended. This accommodates approximately 6,666 plants per hectare.
*   **For *Jasminum grandiflorum* (Jathi/Chameli):** A wider spacing of 2.0 meters between rows and 1.5 meters between plants (2.0 m x 1.5 m) is often preferred, especially if trained on a trellis or support system. This accommodates approximately 3,333 plants per hectare.
*   Adjustments may be made based on soil fertility, specific training methods, and local agro-climatic conditions.

**4. Seed Dose:**
This is not known to affect Jasmine. Commercial cultivation of Jasmine does not rely on seed propagation. Plants are propagated vegetatively using cuttings, layering, or suckers. Therefore, there is no recommended "seed dose" for Jasmine cultivation.
