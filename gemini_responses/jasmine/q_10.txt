Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing pests in Jasmine cultivation in Haryana.

Here's how to control the specified pests:

### 1. Borers (Shoot and Stem Borers)

Borers can cause significant damage by tunneling into shoots and stems, leading to wilting and dieback.

**Control Measures:**
*   **Cultural:** Regularly inspect plants and prune off affected shoots or branches showing signs of wilting or boreholes. Destroy the pruned material to prevent further spread.
*   **Chemical:**
    *   For shoot borers, a systemic insecticide can be effective.
        *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG at 0.2 g/L of water (foliar spray).
    *   For stem borers, after removing the affected part, you can apply a paste or drench.
        *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 2.5 ml/L of water (drench around the base of affected plants or apply a paste made with clay to boreholes).

### 2. Caterpillars (Defoliating Caterpillars)

Various caterpillar species can feed on Jasmine leaves, flowers, and buds, causing defoliation and damage to the aesthetic and economic value of the crop.

**Control Measures:**
*   **Cultural:** Hand-pick larger caterpillars if the infestation is localized and manageable.
*   **Chemical:**
    *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG at 0.2 g/L of water.
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC at 0.3 ml/L of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 1 ml/L of water.

### 3. Diamondback Moth

This is not known to affect Jasmine. Diamondback moth (*Plutella xylostella*) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops like cabbage, cauliflower, and mustard.

### 4. Leaf Folder

Leaf folders are a type of caterpillar that roll or fold leaves and feed from within the protective fold. This damages the foliage and can affect plant vigor and flowering.

**Control Measures:**
*   **Cultural:** Remove and destroy folded leaves containing larvae.
*   **Chemical:** Since leaf folders are lepidopteran larvae (caterpillars), the same insecticides recommended for general caterpillars are effective.
    *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG at 0.2 g/L of water.
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC at 0.3 ml/L of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 1 ml/L of water.

**General Recommendations:**
*   Always ensure thorough coverage of the plant when spraying.
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
*   Follow the manufacturer's instructions for safe handling, mixing, and application of all pesticides.
*   Observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) if you are harvesting flowers for commercial purposes.
*   Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approaches, combining cultural, mechanical, and chemical methods, are always recommended for sustainable pest control.
