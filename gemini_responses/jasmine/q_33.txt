As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling weeds in Jasmine cultivation in Haryana. Effective weed management in perennial crops like Jasmine requires an integrated approach combining cultural and chemical methods.

**General Principles for Weed Control in Jasmine:**

1.  **Integrated Weed Management (IWM):** Combine cultural practices with judicious use of herbicides.
2.  **Timeliness:** Control weeds before they establish, flower, and set seed.
3.  **Safety:** Always prioritize the safety of the Jasmine plants and the environment. Use directed sprays for non-selective herbicides.

**Specific Weed Condition:**

*   **Orobanche (Broomrape):** This is not known to affect Jasmine. Orobanche species are parasitic weeds primarily affecting solanaceous crops, legumes, and some oilseeds, and are not typically associated with Jasmine (Jasminum spp.).

**Weed Control Strategies for Broadleaf, Narrowleaf, Amarbail, Bathu, Congress grass, and Phalaris minor in Jasmine:**

**A. Cultural Methods (Highly Recommended):**

1.  **Manual Weeding:** Regular hand weeding or hoeing is highly effective, especially for young weeds and parasitic weeds like Amarbail. This should be done before weeds flower and set seed.
2.  **Mulching:** Apply organic mulches (e.g., straw, dry leaves, wood chips) around the base of Jasmine plants. A 5-10 cm thick layer can suppress weed germination, conserve soil moisture, and regulate soil temperature.
3.  **Inter-row Cultivation:** In wider row plantings, shallow inter-row cultivation can manage weeds between Jasmine rows.
4.  **Clean Planting Material:** Ensure that planting material (cuttings, saplings) is free from weed seeds or parasitic weed attachments (like Amarbail).

**B. Chemical Methods (Herbicides):**

When using herbicides, always read and follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions. Ensure proper calibration of spray equipment.

**1. Pre-Emergent Herbicides (for Broadleaf and Narrowleaf Weeds, including Phalaris minor and some Amarbail suppression):**
These herbicides are applied to the soil before weed seeds germinate. The soil should be moist for optimal efficacy.

*   **Pendimethalin 30% EC:**
    *   **Dosage:** 3.3 litres per acre (in 200-300 litres of water).
    *   **Application:** Apply as a pre-emergent spray to the soil surface within 3 days of planting or after light irrigation in established beds. It forms a chemical barrier that inhibits weed seed germination.
*   **Oxyfluorfen 23.5% EC:**
    *   **Dosage:** 425 ml per acre (in 200-300 litres of water).
    *   **Application:** Apply as a pre-emergent spray to the soil surface. Effective against a wide range of annual broadleaf and narrowleaf weeds.

**2. Post-Emergent Herbicides (for existing Broadleaf, Narrowleaf, Bathu, Congress grass, Phalaris minor, and Amarbail on weeds):**
These herbicides are applied directly to the emerged weeds. **Extreme caution is required to prevent contact with Jasmine foliage, stems, or roots, as most are non-selective.** Use a protective shield or directed spray nozzle.

*   **Non-Selective Herbicides (Directed Spray):**
    *   **Glyphosate 41% SL:**
        *   **Dosage:** 2.5 - 3.0 litres per acre (in 200-300 litres of water) for general weed control. For spot treatment, 10-20 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Application:** Apply as a directed spray to actively growing weeds. It is systemic and kills perennial weeds effectively. **Absolutely avoid contact with Jasmine plants.**
    *   **Paraquat dichloride 24% SL:**
        *   **Dosage:** 1.0 - 1.2 litres per acre (in 200-300 litres of water) for general weed control. For spot treatment, 10-20 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Application:** Apply as a directed contact spray to actively growing weeds. It acts quickly but is less effective on perennial weeds compared to glyphosate. **Absolutely avoid contact with Jasmine plants.**

*   **Selective Herbicides (for Narrowleaf Weeds like Phalaris minor):**
    These herbicides are generally safe for broadleaf crops like Jasmine but specifically target grasses.

    *   **Quizalofop-ethyl 5% EC:**
        *   **Dosage:** 400-500 ml per acre (in 200-300 litres of water).
        *   **Application:** Apply as a post-emergent spray when grasses are 2-4 leaf stage. Effective against a wide range of annual and perennial grasses, including Phalaris minor.
    *   **Fenoxaprop-p-ethyl 9% EC:**
        *   **Dosage:** 250-300 ml per acre (in 200-300 litres of water).
        *   **Application:** Apply as a post-emergent spray when grasses are actively growing. Effective against various annual and perennial grasses.

**C. Specific Control for Amarbail (Cuscuta spp.):**

Amarbail is a parasitic weed that can severely damage Jasmine.

1.  **Manual Removal:** This is the most effective method. As soon as Amarbail is observed, manually remove it by cutting the affected Jasmine branches or carefully detaching the parasite before it establishes a strong connection and produces seeds. Dispose of the removed Amarbail away from the field to prevent re-infestation.
2.  **Pre-emergent Control:** **Pendimethalin** (as mentioned above) can offer some suppression of Amarbail seed germination if applied to the soil before the parasite emerges.
3.  **Post-emergent Chemical Control:** Once Amarbail has attached to the Jasmine plant, chemical control is extremely challenging without harming the host plant. Non-selective herbicides like **Glyphosate** or **Paraquat dichloride** can kill Amarbail if applied directly, but they will also kill the Jasmine plant if they come into contact. Therefore, manual removal remains the primary and safest option for established Amarbail on Jasmine.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Water Volume:** Always use the recommended water volume for uniform coverage.
*   **Weather Conditions:** Avoid spraying during windy conditions to prevent drift, or during rain.
*   **Protective Gear:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during herbicide application.
*   **Consult Local Experts:** For precise recommendations tailored to your specific field conditions and local weed spectrum, it is always advisable to consult with the agricultural extension specialists at HAU or the local Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK).
