Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU), Hisar, I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling Scale insects and Mealybugs in Jasmine plants. These sap-sucking pests can significantly damage your plants if not managed effectively.

Here's an integrated approach for their control:

**I. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Principles:**

1.  **Regular Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your Jasmine plants, especially the undersides of leaves, leaf axils, and stems, for early signs of these pests. Look for white, cottony masses (Mealybugs) or small, immobile, waxy/hard bumps (Scales).
2.  **Pruning Infested Parts:** For localized infestations, prune and destroy heavily infested branches, leaves, or flowers. This helps reduce the pest population significantly.
3.  **Manual Removal:** For small infestations, Mealybugs can be removed by a strong jet of water or by dabbing them with a cotton swab dipped in rubbing alcohol. Scale insects can sometimes be gently scrubbed off with a soft brush.
4.  **Promote Natural Enemies:** Encourage beneficial insects like ladybird beetles (e.g., *Cryptolaemus montrouzieri* for mealybugs) and parasitic wasps, which are natural predators and parasites of these pests. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.
5.  **Maintain Plant Health:** Healthy plants are more resilient to pest attacks. Ensure proper nutrition, watering, and sunlight for your Jasmine plants.

**II. Chemical Control (For moderate to severe infestations):**

When cultural and biological methods are insufficient, chemical control may be necessary. Always ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and in crevices where these pests hide. Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

Here are some CIBRC approved technical chemicals effective against Scale insects and Mealybugs:

*   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply as a foliar spray at a concentration of **0.5 - 0.75 ml per litre of water**. This is a systemic insecticide that is absorbed by the plant and kills pests feeding on the sap.
*   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply as a foliar spray at a concentration of **0.2 - 0.3 g per litre of water**. Similar to Imidacloprid, it is a systemic insecticide effective against sucking pests.
*   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply as a foliar spray at a concentration of **1.25 - 1.5 ml per litre of water**. This is an insect growth regulator that interferes with the molting process of nymphs, making it very effective against immature stages of both scales and mealybugs.
*   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply as a foliar spray at a concentration of **0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water**. This is another systemic insecticide effective against a wide range of sucking pests.
*   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:** Apply as a foliar spray at a concentration of **0.75 - 1.0 ml per litre of water**. This is a systemic insecticide with translaminar movement, providing excellent control of both scales and mealybugs.
*   **Azadirachtin (Neem Oil) 1500 ppm or 3000 ppm:** For organic control or early stages, apply as a foliar spray at a concentration of **5 - 10 ml per litre of water**. It acts as an antifeedant, repellent, and insect growth disruptor, particularly effective against crawlers and nymphs.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Safety:** Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (gloves, mask, eye protection) during mixing and application.
*   **Timing:** For scale insects, targeting the "crawler" stage (the mobile nymph stage before they settle and form their protective covering) is most effective for contact insecticides. Systemic insecticides are effective against all feeding stages.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and in dense foliage, as these pests are often hidden.
*   **Repeat Application:** A single application may not be sufficient. Repeat the application after 7-10 days if the infestation persists, following label recommendations.

By implementing these strategies, you can effectively manage Scale insects and Mealybugs and ensure the healthy growth of your Jasmine plants.
