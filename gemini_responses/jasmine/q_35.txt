Namaste,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with the scientifically verified advice regarding the maturity signs, harvesting time, and cutting process for Jasmine (Jasminum spp.) cultivation in Haryana.

### Maturity Signs for Jasmine

The maturity of jasmine flowers for harvesting depends largely on their intended use. However, for most commercial purposes (loose flowers, garlands, essential oil extraction), the following signs indicate optimal maturity:

*   **Tight, Plump Buds:** The ideal stage is when the flower buds are fully developed, plump, and show a slight whitish tinge, indicating they are just about to open.
*   **Pre-Bloom Stage:** Buds should be harvested before they fully open. Once fully open, the flowers have a shorter shelf life and may lose some fragrance or quality, especially if exposed to direct sunlight.
*   **Size and Firmness:** Mature buds will be firm to the touch and have reached their characteristic size for the specific jasmine variety.

### Harvesting Time for Jasmine

The timing of harvest is crucial for maximizing flower quality, fragrance, and shelf life.

*   **Early Morning Harvest:** The most suitable time for harvesting jasmine flowers is in the early morning, typically between 4:00 AM and 8:00 AM.
    *   **Reasoning:** At this time, the flowers are fresh, turgid, and their fragrance is at its peak. Harvesting before the sun becomes intense prevents wilting, loss of essential oils, and degradation of flower quality due to heat.
*   **Avoid Wet Conditions:** Do not harvest flowers immediately after rain or when they are wet with dew, as this can lead to fungal issues and reduced shelf life. Allow them to dry naturally first.
*   **Flowering Season in Haryana:** Jasmine typically flowers from March/April to October/November in Haryana, with peak flowering occurring during the warmer months of May to September. Harvesting should be done daily during the peak season.

### Cutting Process for Jasmine

The method of harvesting should be gentle to ensure minimal damage to the flowers and the plant, promoting continuous flowering.

*   **Hand Plucking:** Jasmine flowers are primarily harvested by hand plucking. This allows for selective picking of only the mature buds.
*   **Gentle Removal:** Carefully pluck the individual flower buds along with their short pedicel (flower stalk) from the plant. Avoid tearing or damaging the branch or the developing younger buds.
*   **Avoid Damage to Plant:** Ensure that the leaves and stems are not damaged during the plucking process, as this can negatively impact future yields and plant health.
*   **Collection:** Collect the harvested flowers in clean, shallow baskets or trays to prevent crushing and maintain their freshness. Do not overfill containers.
*   **Post-Harvest Handling:** After harvesting, the flowers should be moved to a cool, shaded area immediately to prevent wilting and preserve their quality.
