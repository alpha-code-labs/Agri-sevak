Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the importance of balanced nutrition for optimal growth and flowering of Jasmine (Chameli/Mogra) plants. Micronutrient deficiencies, though required in small quantities, can significantly impact plant health and productivity.

Before applying any micronutrient, it is highly recommended to conduct a soil test to accurately determine the specific deficiencies in your field. Visual symptoms can also provide clues, but a soil test offers precise data for targeted application.

Here's how to address the specified micronutrient deficiencies in Jasmine:

### General Recommendations:

*   **Diagnosis:** Always confirm the deficiency through soil testing or by observing characteristic visual symptoms.
*   **Application Method:** Micronutrients can be applied either through foliar sprays (for quick correction) or soil application (for sustained availability). Foliar sprays are generally more efficient for immediate correction as they bypass soil fixation issues.
*   **Timing:** For foliar sprays, apply during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to prevent scorching and improve absorption. Repeat applications may be necessary based on the severity of the deficiency and plant response.

### Specific Micronutrient Deficiencies and Their Management:

These micronutrients are essential for all plants, including Jasmine, and their deficiencies can manifest under specific soil or environmental conditions, particularly in the alkaline soils often found in Haryana.

#### 1. Zinc (Zn)

*   **Deficiency Symptoms:** Characterized by 'little leaf' disease, reduced leaf size, shortened internodes leading to a rosetted appearance, and interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.5% solution of **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (5 g per litre of water) or 0.1% solution of **Zinc EDTA** (1 g per litre of water). Apply 2-3 sprays at 15-day intervals.
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 10-25 kg of **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** per acre, mixed with soil before planting or as a top dressing for established plants.

#### 2. Iron/Ferrous (Fe)

*   **Deficiency Symptoms:** Prominent interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins while veins remain green) on younger leaves, eventually affecting the entire leaf and leading to stunted growth. Common in alkaline soils.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.5-1% solution of **Ferrous sulphate** (5-10 g per litre of water) or 0.1% solution of **Ferrous EDTA** (1 g per litre of water). Repeat every 10-15 days until symptoms disappear.
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 25-50 kg of **Ferrous sulphate** per acre, especially in highly alkaline soils. Chelate forms like **Ferrous EDTA** can also be applied to the soil at lower rates (e.g., 5-10 kg/acre) for better availability.

#### 3. Boron (B)

*   **Deficiency Symptoms:** Stunted growth, thickening and brittleness of leaves, dieback of growing points, poor flower development, and sometimes distorted or cracked stems.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.1-0.2% solution of **Borax (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate)** (1-2 g per litre of water) or 0.1% solution of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (1 g per litre of water).
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 5-10 kg of **Borax (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate)** per acre, mixed into the soil. Boron should be applied cautiously as excess can be toxic.

#### 4. Calcium (Ca)

*   **Deficiency Symptoms:** Affects young tissues first, leading to distorted or stunted new growth, tip burn on young leaves, and weak stems.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.5-1% solution of **Calcium nitrate** (5-10 g per litre of water) or 0.5% solution of **Calcium chloride** (5 g per litre of water).
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 50-100 kg of **Calcium nitrate** per acre, or incorporate gypsum (Calcium sulphate) if soil pH is also an issue.

#### 5. Magnesium (Mg)

*   **Deficiency Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves (yellowing between veins, which remain green), sometimes followed by reddish-purple discoloration. Leaves may become brittle.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.5-1% solution of **Magnesium sulphate** (5-10 g per litre of water). Repeat every 15-20 days as needed.
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 25-50 kg of **Magnesium sulphate** per acre, especially in sandy soils or where leaching is high.

#### 6. Manganese (Mn)

*   **Deficiency Symptoms:** Similar to iron deficiency, showing interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, but often with a finer network of green veins and sometimes small necrotic spots.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.5% solution of **Manganese sulphate** (5 g per litre of water) or 0.1% solution of **Manganese EDTA** (1 g per litre of water).
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 10-20 kg of **Manganese sulphate** per acre, particularly in alkaline soils where manganese availability is reduced.

Always ensure thorough coverage during foliar sprays and follow safety precautions as per product labels. For any further clarification or specific field issues, please consult with your local agricultural extension officer or visit HAU, Hisar for expert advice.
