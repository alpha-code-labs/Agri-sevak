As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach for controlling pests in Jasmine, focusing on prevention, monitoring, and judicious use of scientifically verified methods.

### Control of Beetles and Weevils in Jasmine

Beetles and Weevils (weevils are a type of beetle) can cause significant damage to Jasmine by feeding on leaves, flowers, and sometimes roots. Common pests include flea beetles, chafer beetles, and various weevil species.

**Symptoms of Damage:**
*   **Beetles:** Irregular holes in leaves (flea beetles), defoliation, damage to flowers. Some chafer beetles are nocturnal and feed on foliage and flowers at night.
*   **Weevils:** Notching on leaf margins, holes in leaves, damage to flower buds, and in some cases, root damage by larvae.

**Management Strategies:**

1.  **Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
    *   **Regular Monitoring:** Inspect plants frequently, especially the undersides of leaves and new growth, to detect infestations early.
    *   **Hand-picking:** For larger beetles and weevils, especially during early morning or late evening, hand-picking and destroying them can be effective for small infestations.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy fallen leaves, flowers, and plant debris where pests might hide or overwinter.
    *   **Proper Plant Care:** Ensure plants are healthy with adequate water and nutrients, as stressed plants are more susceptible to pest attacks.
    *   **Physical Barriers:** For very small-scale cultivation, fine mesh netting can sometimes deter adult beetles.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Encourage natural enemies like predatory beetles, spiders, and parasitic wasps by avoiding broad-spectrum insecticides and maintaining a diverse garden ecosystem.

3.  **Chemical Control (Use only when necessary and as a last resort):**
    *   Apply insecticides during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize harm to beneficial insects and reduce evaporation. Always follow label instructions carefully.

    *   For general chewing beetles and weevils:
        *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at 0.5 - 1.0 ml per litre of water. This is a systemic insecticide effective against sucking and some chewing pests like flea beetles.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** Apply at 0.5 - 1.0 ml per litre of water. This is a broad-spectrum contact and stomach insecticide.
        *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** Apply at 0.3 ml per litre of water. This is effective against a range of chewing pests, including some beetle species.
        *   **Azadirachtin (e.g., 1500 ppm formulation):** Apply at 3 - 5 ml per litre of water. This is a botanical insecticide with antifeedant and repellent properties, suitable for early stages of infestation or as part of an organic approach.

### Control of Sawflies in Jasmine

This is not known to affect Jasmine.

### General Precautions for Pesticide Application:
*   Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, mask, and protective clothing.
*   Read and strictly follow the instructions on the pesticide label regarding dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Avoid spraying during windy conditions to prevent drift.
*   Dispose of empty containers safely as per local regulations.
*   Keep pesticides out of reach of children and pets.
