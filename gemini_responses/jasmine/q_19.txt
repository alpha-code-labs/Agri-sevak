As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice on addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium) in Jasmine plants, keeping in mind the conditions in Haryana.

Before applying any fertilizers, it is highly recommended to conduct a soil test. This will accurately determine the existing nutrient levels in your soil and help tailor a precise fertilization program, preventing over-application and nutrient imbalances.

Here's how to address specific macro-nutrient deficiencies:

### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   General yellowing (chlorosis) of older leaves, starting from the tips and progressing inwards.
*   Stunted growth with fewer and smaller leaves.
*   Reduced flowering and overall vigor.

**Treatment:**
*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Urea** (46% Nitrogen) at a rate of 10-15 grams per established plant.
    *   Split this into 2-3 applications during the active growing season (e.g., March-April, June-July, September-October).
    *   Broadcast the granules evenly around the base of the plant, gently incorporate into the topsoil, and water thoroughly immediately after application to prevent nitrogen loss and ensure nutrient uptake.
*   **Foliar Spray (for quick recovery in severe cases):**
    *   Dissolve **Urea** at a concentration of 5-10 grams per litre of water.
    *   Spray the solution evenly on the foliage, ensuring good coverage.
    *   Apply preferably in the early morning or late evening to avoid scorching of leaves. Repeat after 10-15 days if symptoms persist.

### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   Dark green or purplish discoloration of older leaves, especially on the undersides.
*   Stunted growth, poor root development, and delayed maturity.
*   Reduced flowering and fruit set.

**Treatment:**
*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% Nitrogen, 46% P2O5) at 15-25 grams per established plant, or **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5) at 30-50 grams per established plant.
    *   Phosphorus is less mobile in the soil, so it's best applied as a basal dose during planting or once or twice a year, preferably before the main flowering season.
    *   Incorporate the fertilizer into the soil around the root zone and water well.

### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   Yellowing and browning (scorching) of leaf margins, particularly on older leaves.
*   Weak stems and reduced plant vigor.
*   Poor flower quality, reduced flower size, and quantity.
*   Increased susceptibility to diseases and environmental stresses.

**Treatment:**
*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** (60% K2O) at a rate of 10-15 grams per established plant.
    *   Similar to Nitrogen, split this into 2-3 applications during the active growing season.
    *   Broadcast around the plant, lightly incorporate into the soil, and water thoroughly.
*   **Foliar Spray (for quick recovery):**
    *   Dissolve **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** at a concentration of 5-10 grams per litre of water.
    *   Spray on the foliage, ensuring good coverage. Apply in the early morning or late evening.

### General Recommendations:

*   **Soil Testing:** As mentioned, a soil test is the most accurate way to determine specific nutrient needs. Contact HAU's soil testing lab for assistance.
*   **Balanced Fertilization:** While addressing specific deficiencies, ensure a balanced approach to avoid creating other nutrient imbalances. Consider using a complete NPK fertilizer if general deficiency is suspected after soil testing.
*   **Watering:** Always water the plants thoroughly after applying granular fertilizers to the soil. This helps dissolve the nutrients and makes them available for root uptake.
*   **Avoid Over-fertilization:** Excessive application of fertilizers can lead to nutrient toxicity, root burn, and environmental pollution. Always follow recommended dosages.
*   **Organic Matter:** Incorporating well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost regularly improves soil structure, water retention, and provides a slow release of macro and micronutrients.
