For optimal growth and flowering of Jasmine (Chameli) in Haryana, the application of organic manures is highly beneficial for improving soil health, nutrient availability, and plant vigour. Here are the recommended doses:

*   **Farmyard Manure (FYM):**
    *   **Dose:** 10-15 kg per plant per year, or 20-25 tonnes per acre per year.
    *   **Application:** Incorporate well into the soil around the plant base, preferably during the annual pruning period (e.g., December-January) or before the onset of new growth. This provides a steady supply of macro and micronutrients.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   **Dose:** 2-3 kg per plant per year, or 4-5 tonnes per acre per year.
    *   **Application:** Can be used as a partial substitute for FYM or as a supplementary top-dressing. Apply around the root zone and lightly mix with the topsoil, ideally split into two applications (e.g., pre-monsoon and post-monsoon) for sustained nutrient release.

*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract-based product):**
    *   **Dose (Foliar Spray):** 2.5-3.0 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Application:** Spray uniformly on the foliage during active growth and flowering stages.
    *   **Frequency:** 2-3 sprays can be given at intervals of 20-30 days, starting from the vegetative growth phase and continuing through the flowering period, to enhance flower production and quality.
