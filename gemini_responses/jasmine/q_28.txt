Jasmine (Jasminum spp.) is a valuable crop in Haryana, but it is susceptible to the region's extreme environmental conditions. Protecting your jasmine plants from these stresses is vital for their health, flowering, and productivity.

Here's how to protect Jasmine from environmental stress:

### Protection from Extreme Cold and Frost

Haryana experiences severe cold and frost during winter, which can cause significant damage to jasmine plants.

*   **Adequate Watering:** Ensure the soil around the jasmine plants is adequately moist before a predicted frost event. Moist soil retains heat better than dry soil, releasing it slowly overnight and helping to keep the root zone warmer.
*   **Mulching:** Apply a thick layer (5-10 cm) of organic mulch such as straw, dry leaves, sugarcane trash, or paddy husk around the base of the plants. This insulates the soil, protects the root system from freezing temperatures, and helps retain soil warmth.
*   **Covering:** For individual plants or smaller plots, cover the jasmine plants with burlap, jute bags, old blankets, or specialized non-woven frost protection fabric before sunset. Ensure the cover extends to the ground to trap warmth. Remove covers during the day if temperatures rise significantly to allow light and air circulation.
*   **Windbreaks:** Plant natural windbreaks (e.g., taller, hardy shrubs or trees) or erect artificial barriers on the northern and western sides of the jasmine plot. This helps to reduce the impact of cold, dry winds.
*   **Site Selection:** If planting new jasmine, choose a location that is naturally sheltered from prevailing cold winds and receives good morning sun, which helps in thawing frost quickly.

### Protection from Heat/Loo (Hot Winds)

The hot, dry winds (Loo) and high temperatures during summer in Haryana can cause wilting, leaf scorch, and overall plant stress.

*   **Adequate Irrigation:** Provide regular and deep watering, especially during the morning or late evening hours. The frequency will depend on soil type and weather conditions, but ensure the soil remains consistently moist, not waterlogged. This helps the plant cope with high transpiration rates.
*   **Mulching:** Maintain a thick layer of organic mulch around the plants to conserve soil moisture, reduce soil temperature, and suppress weeds, all of which are crucial during hot periods.
*   **Shade Nets:** Install green or black shade nets (typically 30-50% shade factor) over the jasmine plants during the peak summer months (April to June). This significantly reduces the ambient temperature around the plants and protects them from direct heat.
*   **Windbreaks:** Establish natural or artificial windbreaks on the western and southern sides of the jasmine plot to mitigate the drying and damaging effects of hot, dry winds (Loo).
*   **Misting/Sprinkling:** In extreme heat, occasional misting of the foliage during the cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) can help reduce leaf temperature and increase humidity around the plants. However, avoid prolonged leaf wetness to prevent fungal issues.

### Protection from Intense Sunlight

Intense solar radiation, especially during summer, can lead to leaf scorch, bleaching, and reduced photosynthetic efficiency.

*   **Shade Nets:** As mentioned for heat stress, shade nets (30-50% shade factor) are highly effective in protecting jasmine from intense direct sunlight. They filter out a portion of the harsh UV rays and reduce light intensity, preventing leaf burn and stress.
*   **Site Selection:** If possible, plant jasmine in a location that receives some afternoon shade, especially in areas with very high solar intensity. This can be achieved by planting near taller structures or trees that provide natural shade during the hottest part of the day.
*   **Mulching:** A layer of organic mulch protects the soil and roots from overheating due to direct sun exposure, maintaining a cooler root zone.
