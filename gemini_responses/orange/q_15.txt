As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Orange orchards in Haryana:

### Control of Grasshopper in Orange

Grasshoppers can cause damage to Orange trees by feeding on leaves, especially young foliage.

*   **Cultural/Mechanical Control:**
    *   Regular monitoring of the orchard for grasshopper activity.
    *   Hand-picking of nymphs and adults, especially in small orchards, can be effective in reducing populations.
    *   Maintaining orchard hygiene and removing weeds can reduce breeding sites.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   For effective control, spray when grasshopper populations are high, targeting young nymphs.
    *   **Malathion 50% EC**: Apply at a rate of 1.5 - 2 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC**: Apply at a rate of 0.5 - 1 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC**: Apply at a rate of 2 - 2.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   *Application*: Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage, preferably during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening).

### Control of Painted bug in Orange

This is not known to affect Orange. Painted bug (Bagrada hilaris) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops like mustard, cabbage, and cauliflower.

### Control of Red cotton bug in Orange

This is not known to affect Orange. Red cotton bug (Dysdercus cingulatus) is a major pest of cotton and other malvaceous plants, feeding on developing seeds.

### Control of Black Ants in Orange

Black ants are often secondary pests in Orange orchards, primarily attracted to the honeydew secreted by primary sucking pests like aphids, mealybugs, and scale insects. They protect these honeydew-producing pests, thus exacerbating the primary pest problem.

*   **Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Approach:**
    *   **Control Primary Pests First**: The most effective way to manage ants is to control the primary sucking pests (aphids, mealybugs, scale insects) that produce honeydew. Once the honeydew source is eliminated, ants will naturally disperse.
    *   **Physical Barriers**: Apply sticky bands (e.g., non-drying glue or grease) around the tree trunk at about 30-45 cm height to prevent ants from climbing up the tree. Ensure the band is continuous and free of debris that could form bridges.
    *   **Orchard Sanitation**: Remove weeds and debris around the tree base that can provide shelter or alternative food sources for ants.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC**:
        *   As a drench around the base of the tree: Apply 5-10 ml per litre of water, depending on tree size and infestation severity. This creates a chemical barrier.
        *   As a trunk paint: Mix with clay or lime to form a paste and paint a band around the tree trunk to create a barrier.
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL**: If primary sucking pests are present, a foliar spray at 0.3-0.5 ml per litre of water will control them, thereby reducing honeydew and ant attraction. It can also be used as a soil drench (consult product label for specific drenching rates for citrus).
    *   **Fipronil 0.3% GR**: Apply granules around the base of the tree as per product label recommendations (e.g., 10-20 kg per acre, broadcast or spot application) to control ground-dwelling ants.

**General Recommendation:**
Always read and strictly follow the instructions, dosage rates, and safety precautions provided on the product label of any chemical insecticide. Ensure proper protective equipment is used during application. Consult with local agricultural extension services for the most current and specific recommendations for your region.
