As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified recommendations for the use of Growth Regulators/Hormones in Orange cultivation in Haryana:

It is crucial to ensure accurate measurement and uniform application for optimal results and to avoid phytotoxicity. Always read the product label for specific instructions and safety precautions.

*   **Ethephon** (commonly sold as Ethrel)
    *   **Purpose:** Primarily used for fruit degreening (enhancing color development) in mature oranges. It can also be used for fruit thinning in some citrus varieties, but degreening is its more common application in oranges.
    *   **Recommended Dose:** For degreening, apply **Ethephon** at a concentration of 250-500 ppm (parts per million) of the active ingredient.
        *   *Practical Application:* If using a 39% SL (Soluble Liquid) formulation, this translates to approximately **0.6 - 1.3 ml per liter of water**.
    *   **Timing:** Apply when fruits have attained physiological maturity but still show some green patches, typically 7-10 days before the desired harvest.

*   **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid** (commonly known as 2,4-D)
    *   **Purpose:** To prevent pre-harvest fruit drop, thereby increasing marketable yield.
    *   **Recommended Dose:** Apply **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid** at a concentration of 10-20 ppm (parts per million) of the active ingredient.
        *   *Practical Application:* If using an 80% Sodium Salt formulation, this translates to approximately **1.25 - 2.5 grams per 100 liters of water** (or 0.0125 - 0.025 g/L).
    *   **Timing:** Apply 2-4 weeks before the anticipated period of natural fruit drop, usually when fruits are nearing maturity. A single application is generally sufficient.

*   **Boron** (as **Disodium tetraborate decahydrate** or **Boric acid**)
    *   **Purpose:** Boron is an essential micronutrient. Its application prevents and corrects Boron deficiency symptoms such as gumming, fruit cracking, hard and misshapen fruits, and dieback of young shoots. It is crucial for pollen viability, fruit set, and overall fruit quality.
    *   **Recommended Dose:** For foliar application to correct Boron deficiency, spray a 0.1% - 0.2% solution of **Disodium tetraborate decahydrate** (Borax).
        *   *Practical Application:* This means **1-2 grams of Borax per liter of water**.
    *   **Timing:** Apply during critical growth stages such as flowering and fruit set, or when deficiency symptoms are observed. Repeat application may be necessary based on the severity of deficiency and soil test results. For maintenance, a spray during pre-bloom and post-fruit set is beneficial.
