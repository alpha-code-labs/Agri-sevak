As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following doses of organic manures for Orange cultivation in Haryana. These recommendations are based on scientific research and best practices for citrus in the region.

It is crucial to conduct a soil test before applying any manures to determine the specific nutrient status of your orchard and tailor the application accordingly.

### Recommended Doses of Organic Manures for Orange:

*   **Farm Yard Manure (FYM):**
    *   Ensure the FYM is well-decomposed (at least 3-6 months old) to avoid nutrient lock-up and pest issues.
    *   **For young trees (1-3 years old):** 10-20 kg per tree per year.
    *   **For bearing trees (4 years and above):** 25-50 kg per tree per year.
    *   **Application:** Apply in two split doses. The first dose should be applied during July-August (monsoon season) and the second dose during October-November (post-harvest). Spread the FYM evenly in the tree basin, 30-60 cm away from the trunk, and incorporate it into the soil by light digging.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   Vermicompost is richer in nutrients than FYM and improves soil structure and microbial activity more effectively.
    *   **For young trees (1-3 years old):** 5-10 kg per tree per year.
    *   **For bearing trees (4 years and above):** 10-20 kg per tree per year.
    *   **Application:** Similar to FYM, apply in two split doses during July-August and October-November. Vermicompost can be used to supplement or partially replace FYM, often at half the quantity of FYM due to its higher nutrient concentration.

*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract based bio-stimulant):**
    *   Sagarika is a bio-stimulant derived from seaweed extracts, rich in plant growth regulators, micronutrients, and amino acids. It is not a bulk manure but enhances plant growth, flowering, and fruiting.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** 2-3 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Application Frequency:** Apply 2-3 times during the crop cycle for optimal results:
        *   **First spray:** At the pre-flowering stage (e.g., February-March).
        *   **Second spray:** At the fruit set stage (e.g., April-May).
        *   **Third spray:** During the fruit development/enlargement stage (e.g., July-August).
    *   Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage during spraying.

**General Recommendations:**
*   Always ensure the organic manures are well-decomposed to prevent the introduction of weeds, pests, and diseases.
*   The exact doses may vary based on the specific soil type, tree age, tree health, and yield expectations. Regular soil testing is highly recommended to fine-tune nutrient management.
*   Proper irrigation after manure application helps in nutrient dissolution and uptake by the roots.
