Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling Scale insects and Mealybugs in Orange orchards in Haryana. These are common sucking pests that can significantly impact the health and productivity of your orange trees if not managed effectively.

Here's an integrated approach for their control:

**I. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies:**

1.  **Regular Monitoring:** Frequently inspect your orange trees, especially the undersides of leaves, stems, and fruit, for early signs of scale insects (small, immobile bumps) and mealybugs (white, cottony masses). Early detection is key to effective control.
2.  **Pruning:** Remove and destroy heavily infested branches, twigs, and leaves. This reduces the pest population and improves air circulation, making the environment less favourable for these pests.
3.  **Ant Management:** Control ant populations in your orchard. Ants often protect mealybugs and scales from their natural enemies in exchange for honeydew.
4.  **High-Pressure Water Spray:** For light infestations, a strong jet of water can dislodge mealybugs and scale crawlers from the plant surface.
5.  **Biological Control:** Encourage natural enemies such as ladybird beetles (e.g., *Cryptolaemus montrouzieri* for mealybugs), lacewings, and parasitic wasps. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

**II. Chemical Control (When necessary, using CIBRC approved chemicals):**

When infestations are severe and cultural methods are insufficient, chemical intervention may be required. Ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and in crevices where these pests hide.

*   **Horticultural Mineral Oil (HMO):**
    *   **Dosage:** 10-20 ml/L of water.
    *   **Application:** Effective against all stages, particularly scale crawlers and mealybug nymphs, by suffocating them. Apply during cooler parts of the day to avoid phytotoxicity. Ensure complete coverage.

*   **Buprofezin 25% SC:**
    *   **Dosage:** 1.25 - 1.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Application:** An insect growth regulator that interferes with the molting process of nymphs, making it highly effective against young stages of both scales and mealybugs.

*   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:**
    *   **Dosage:** 0.75 - 1.0 ml/L of water.
    *   **Application:** A systemic insecticide that moves both upwards and downwards in the plant (phloem and xylem), providing excellent control of hidden scales and mealybugs.

*   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:**
    *   **Dosage:** 0.3 - 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Application:** A systemic insecticide effective against sucking pests, including mealybugs and scale crawlers.

*   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:**
    *   **Dosage:** 0.2 - 0.3 g/L of water.
    *   **Application:** Another systemic insecticide that provides good control of sucking pests like mealybugs and scale crawlers.

**Important Considerations for Chemical Application:**

*   **Thorough Coverage:** Both scale insects and mealybugs are often protected by waxy coatings or hide in crevices. Ensure the spray solution reaches all parts of the plant, including the undersides of leaves and stem junctions.
*   **Rotation of Chemicals:** To prevent the development of pesticide resistance, rotate insecticides with different modes of action. Do not use the same chemical repeatedly.
*   **Timing:** Apply insecticides when pest populations are high, but also consider the life cycle of the pests (e.g., targeting scale crawlers is more effective than adult scales).
*   **Safety:** Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the pesticide label, including dosage, application method, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and safety precautions (wearing protective gear).
*   **Environmental Conditions:** Avoid spraying during windy conditions or when rain is expected shortly after application.

By implementing these strategies, you can effectively manage scale insects and mealybugs in your orange orchard and ensure healthy fruit production.
