As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding viral diseases in Orange (Citrus). It's crucial to remember that once a plant is infected with a virus, there is generally no chemical cure. Therefore, control strategies primarily focus on prevention and managing the vectors that spread these viruses.

**Addressing Specific Viral Diseases in Orange:**

1.  **Leaf curl:** Leaf curling in Orange can be a symptom of various issues, including nutrient deficiencies, insect feeding, or viral infections like Citrus Tristeza Virus (CTV) or Citrus Psorosis Virus (CPsV). While a specific "Leaf curl virus" as a standalone entity is not the primary concern in citrus, managing the underlying causes, especially viral ones, is key.
2.  **Mosaic:** Citrus Psorosis Virus (CPsV) and Citrus Mosaic Virus (CMV) are known to affect Orange, causing mosaic-like patterns on leaves and sometimes fruit.
3.  **Yellow vein clearing:** Citrus Yellow Vein Clearing Virus (CYVCV) is a known viral disease affecting Orange, characterized by yellowing of leaf veins.
4.  **Stripe:** This is not known to affect Orange as a distinct viral disease.
5.  **Tristeza:** Citrus Tristeza Virus (CTV) is one of the most devastating viral diseases of Orange worldwide, causing decline, stem pitting, and sometimes leaf curling. It is primarily spread by aphids.
6.  **Stunt virus:** Stunting in Orange can be caused by various factors, including Citrus Exocortis Viroid (CEVd) and Citrus Tatter Leaf Virus (CTLV). These pathogens can significantly reduce tree vigour and yield.

**General Control Strategies for Viral Diseases in Orange:**

Since viral diseases are incurable, the focus must be on preventive measures and managing the spread.

1.  **Use Certified, Virus-Free Planting Material:**
    *   Always procure budwood, rootstock, and scion material from certified nurseries that guarantee virus-free stock. This is the most critical step to prevent the introduction of viral diseases.

2.  **Rogue and Remove Infected Plants:**
    *   Promptly identify and remove (rogue) any trees showing symptoms of viral infection. This helps reduce the source of inoculum for further spread. Dispose of infected plant material properly, preferably by burning or deep burial.

3.  **Control of Insect Vectors:**
    *   Many citrus viruses are transmitted by insect vectors such as aphids (e.g., for Tristeza), mealybugs, and whiteflies. Effective management of these pests is crucial to prevent virus spread.
    *   Monitor your orchard regularly for the presence of these pests.
    *   Apply insecticides when pest populations reach economic thresholds. Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

    **CIBRC Approved Technical Chemicals for Vector Control (Aphids, Mealybugs, Whiteflies):**

    *   **For Aphids (e.g., *Toxoptera citricida* - vector of Tristeza):**
        *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: 0.5-0.75 ml/L of water (Foliar spray)
        *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: 0.2-0.4 g/L of water (Foliar spray)
        *   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP: 0.2-0.3 g/L of water (Foliar spray)
        *   **Flonicamid** 50% WG: 0.3 g/L of water (Foliar spray)

    *   **For Mealybugs and Whiteflies:**
        *   **Buprofezin** 25% SC: 1.25 ml/L of water (Foliar spray, targets nymphs)
        *   **Spiromesifen** 22.9% SC: 0.5 ml/L of water (Foliar spray, effective against whiteflies)
        *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: 0.5-0.75 ml/L of water (Foliar spray)
        *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: 0.2-0.4 g/L of water (Foliar spray)
        *   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP: 0.2-0.3 g/L of water (Foliar spray)

    *   *Note: Always follow the specific dosage and application instructions provided on the product label. Ensure thorough coverage during spraying.*

4.  **Sanitation and Hygiene:**
    *   Disinfect pruning tools and equipment with a 1-2% sodium hypochlorite solution (bleach) or 70% alcohol between trees to prevent mechanical transmission of viruses and viroids.
    *   Keep the orchard free of weeds, as some weeds can act as alternate hosts for viruses or their vectors.

5.  **Use of Resistant Rootstocks and Varieties:**
    *   Where available and suitable for Haryana's conditions, utilize rootstocks and scion varieties known to be tolerant or resistant to specific viral diseases, especially Tristeza. For example, sour orange rootstock is highly susceptible to CTV, while trifoliate orange and its hybrids are generally tolerant.

6.  **Nutritional Management:**
    *   Maintain optimal tree health through balanced fertilization and irrigation. Healthy trees are generally more resilient to stress, although this does not prevent viral infection.

By implementing these integrated management strategies, you can significantly reduce the incidence and spread of viral diseases in your Orange orchard.
