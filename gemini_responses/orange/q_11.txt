As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing pests in Orange orchards in Haryana.

### Control of Beetles and Weevils in Orange

Beetles and Weevils can cause significant damage to orange trees by feeding on leaves, fruits, stems, or roots. Effective management involves an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, mechanical, and chemical methods.

**1. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Principles:**

*   **Regular Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your orchard for signs of beetle or weevil activity (e.g., chewed leaves, boreholes in stems, damaged fruits, presence of adult insects). Early detection is key to effective control.
*   **Orchard Sanitation:** Remove and destroy fallen fruits, plant debris, and weeds that can harbor pests.
*   **Pruning:** Remove any infested or dead branches to reduce breeding sites and improve air circulation.
*   **Maintain Tree Vigor:** Ensure proper nutrition and irrigation to keep trees healthy and more resilient to pest attacks.

**2. Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved for Citrus in India):**

For effective chemical control, it is crucial to identify the specific type of beetle or weevil causing the damage. However, for general control of chewing pests like many beetles and weevils, the following CIBRC-approved insecticides can be used:

*   **For Leaf-feeding Beetles and Weevils:**
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** Apply at a concentration of **0.5 ml per litre of water** as a foliar spray. This provides contact and stomach action against a broad spectrum of chewing pests.
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** Apply at a concentration of **0.3 ml per litre of water** as a foliar spray. This insecticide offers excellent control against various chewing insects with systemic and translaminar action.

*   **For Stem/Trunk Borers (some beetles are borers in their larval stage):**
    *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC:** For borers, clean the affected portion of the stem/trunk and apply a solution of **2.5 ml per litre of water** by swabbing or drenching around the base of the tree. This can also be used as a soil drench against root weevils if they are identified as a problem.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the insecticide label carefully, including dosage, application method, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and application.
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer for specific pest identification and tailored recommendations for your region and specific pest situation.

### Sawflies in Orange

This is not known to affect Orange. Sawflies are generally not considered pests of citrus crops.
