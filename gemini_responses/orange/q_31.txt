As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the importance of managing physical damage in orange orchards to ensure optimal yield and quality. Addressing fruit bursting, leaf burning/melting, and fruit hardness requires a holistic approach focusing on proper cultural practices, irrigation management, and balanced nutrition.

Here's how to control these physical damages in Orange:

### 1. Fruit Bursting (Cracking)

**Causes:** Primarily due to sudden fluctuations in soil moisture (e.g., heavy irrigation after a dry spell, or heavy rainfall), nutrient deficiencies (especially Boron and Calcium), and sometimes high humidity or temperature extremes.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Consistent Irrigation:** Maintain uniform soil moisture throughout the fruit development period. Avoid extremes of wet and dry cycles. Drip irrigation is highly recommended for precise water management.
*   **Mulching:** Apply organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves) around the tree base to conserve soil moisture, regulate soil temperature, and reduce evaporation.
*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Calcium:** Essential for cell wall integrity and strength.
        *   Apply **Calcium Nitrate** at 10-15 kg/acre through soil application or 5-7 g/L as a foliar spray during fruit development stages.
    *   **Boron:** Improves calcium uptake and cell wall elasticity.
        *   Apply **Borax (Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate)** at 4-5 kg/acre through soil application once a year, or **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** at 1-1.5 g/L as a foliar spray during flowering and fruit set.

### 2. Leaf Burning/Melting (Scorching)

**Causes:** High temperatures, intense solar radiation (sunburn), water stress, high soil/water salinity, or improper application of agrochemicals.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Adequate Irrigation:** Ensure sufficient and timely irrigation, especially during hot and dry periods, to prevent water stress.
*   **Shade Management:** For young plants, temporary shading (e.g., shade nets) during peak summer months can protect leaves from intense sun.
*   **Mulching:** Helps in reducing soil temperature and conserving moisture, thereby mitigating heat stress.
*   **Salinity Management (if applicable):** If soil or water salinity is an issue, use good quality irrigation water. Improve soil drainage.
    *   Apply **Calcium Sulfate Dihydrate (Gypsum)** at 2-4 tonnes/acre (depending on soil test results) to improve soil structure and facilitate leaching of salts.
*   **Proper Chemical Application:** Always follow label instructions for agrochemicals. Avoid spraying during high temperatures or strong sunlight to prevent phytotoxicity.
*   **Nutrient Support:**
    *   **Potassium:** Helps in improving the plant's tolerance to heat and drought stress.
        *   Apply **Potassium Nitrate** at 5-10 g/L as a foliar spray during stress periods.

### 3. Hardness in Fruit (Poor Juice Content, Thick Rind)

**Causes:** Primarily due to insufficient water during fruit development, nutrient imbalances (especially Potassium deficiency or excessive Nitrogen), high temperatures, and sometimes over-cropping.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Consistent Water Supply:** Ensure a steady and adequate supply of water, particularly during the fruit growth and ripening stages. Water stress is a major contributor to hard, small fruits with less juice.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:**
    *   **Potassium:** Crucial for fruit size, juice content, sugar accumulation, and rind thickness.
        *   Apply **Potassium Sulfate** at 10-15 kg/acre through soil application during fruit development, or **Potassium Nitrate** at 5-10 g/L as a foliar spray.
    *   Avoid excessive nitrogen application, which can sometimes lead to thicker rinds and reduced juice content.
*   **Fruit Thinning:** If the tree is heavily laden with fruit, judicious thinning can improve the size and quality of the remaining fruits, leading to better juice content and reduced hardness.
*   **Mulching:** Helps maintain stable soil moisture and temperature, which are beneficial for optimal fruit development.
