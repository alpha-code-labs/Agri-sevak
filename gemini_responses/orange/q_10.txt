Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing these pests in Orange orchards in Haryana.

Here's how to control the mentioned pests:

### 1. Borers (e.g., Stem Borer, Shoot Borer, Fruit Borer)

Borers can cause significant damage by tunneling into stems, shoots, or fruits, leading to wilting, branch dieback, or fruit drop.

*   **Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
    *   Regularly inspect trees for signs of borer activity (e.g., sawdust-like frass, gum exudation, boreholes).
    *   Prune and destroy affected branches well below the point of infestation.
    *   For stem borers, use a thin wire to physically extract larvae from boreholes.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **For Stem Borers:**
        *   Inject 5-10 ml of **Chlorpyrifos** (20 EC) directly into the boreholes and plug with mud.
        *   Alternatively, swab the tree trunk up to 1 meter height with a solution of **Chlorpyrifos** (20 EC) at 2.5 ml/L of water, especially during peak emergence periods.
    *   **For Shoot Borers:**
        *   Spray with **Lambda-cyhalothrin** (5 EC) at 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   Or spray with **Chlorantraniliprole** (18.5 SC) at 0.3 ml/L of water.

### 2. Caterpillars (General Defoliators, Fruit Sucking Moth Larvae)

Various caterpillar species can feed on orange leaves, shoots, and sometimes fruits.

*   **Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
    *   Monitor young orchards regularly for caterpillar feeding damage.
    *   Hand-pick and destroy visible larvae in small infestations.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Spray with **Chlorantraniliprole** (18.5 SC) at 0.3 ml/L of water.
    *   Or spray with **Emamectin benzoate** (5 SG) at 0.2 g/L of water.
    *   Or spray with **Lambda-cyhalothrin** (5 EC) at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   Or spray with **Indoxacarb** (14.5 SC) at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   Or spray with **Flubendiamide** (20 WG) at 0.2 g/L of water.

### 3. Diamondback Moth (*Plutella xylostella*)

This is not known to affect Orange. The Diamondback moth is a primary pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower, mustard).

### 4. Leaf Folder (e.g., *Psorosticha zizyphi*)

Leaf folders cause damage by folding or rolling leaves and feeding from within, affecting photosynthesis and new flush growth.

*   **Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
    *   Prune and destroy infested leaves or shoots containing larvae.
    *   Encourage natural enemies like parasitic wasps.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Spray with **Chlorantraniliprole** (18.5 SC) at 0.3 ml/L of water.
    *   Or spray with **Emamectin benzoate** (5 SG) at 0.2 g/L of water.
    *   Or spray with **Lambda-cyhalothrin** (5 EC) at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   Or spray with **Indoxacarb** (14.5 SC) at 0.5 ml/L of water.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully, including dosage, application method, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Ensure proper coverage during spraying for effective control.
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
*   Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, mechanical, biological, and chemical methods, is always recommended for sustainable pest control.
*   Consult your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and the current pest situation.
