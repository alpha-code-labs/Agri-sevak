Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide you with the scientifically verified requirements for successful Orange cultivation in Haryana.

Here are the suitable climate, soil type, and drainage requirements for Orange (Citrus sinensis):

### Climate Requirements:

*   **Temperature:** Oranges thrive in subtropical climates characterized by warm to hot summers and mild winters.
    *   **Optimal Growth:** Ideal temperatures for vegetative growth and fruit development range from 13°C to 35°C.
    *   **Fruit Quality:** A distinct cool period during winter (but not freezing) is beneficial for flowering, fruit set, and enhancing fruit quality (colour and sweetness).
    *   **Frost Sensitivity:** Orange trees are highly sensitive to frost. Temperatures below 0°C can cause significant damage to flowers, young fruits, and even mature trees, especially young plants.
*   **Sunlight:** Abundant sunshine (at least 6-8 hours daily) is crucial for photosynthesis, good fruit development, and high sugar content in the fruits.
*   **Rainfall/Humidity:** While oranges require moderate rainfall (900-1200 mm annually), in Haryana's semi-arid to sub-humid conditions, supplementary irrigation is absolutely critical, especially during dry spells, flowering, and fruit development stages. High humidity can sometimes increase the incidence of certain fungal diseases.

### Soil Type Requirements:

*   **Texture:** Deep, well-drained, fertile loamy to sandy loam soils are considered ideal for orange cultivation. These soils provide good aeration and water retention capacity.
    *   They can also be grown in medium black soils, provided the drainage is excellent.
*   **pH:** Oranges prefer slightly acidic to neutral soil pH, ideally ranging from 6.0 to 7.5, for optimal nutrient availability and uptake.
*   **Organic Matter:** Soils rich in organic matter are highly beneficial as they improve soil structure, water holding capacity, and nutrient supply.
*   **Avoid:** Heavy clay soils, saline-alkaline soils, or soils with hardpans are unsuitable due to their poor aeration, drainage issues, and potential for nutrient imbalances.

### Drainage Requirements:

*   **Critical Importance:** Excellent drainage is paramount for orange cultivation. Oranges are extremely sensitive to waterlogging.
*   **Root Aeration:** The root system of orange trees requires good aeration. Waterlogged conditions deprive roots of oxygen, leading to:
    *   Root rot diseases (e.g., Phytophthora root rot).
    *   Impaired nutrient and water uptake.
    *   Stunted growth and eventual tree decline.
*   **Water Table:** A deep water table (ideally below 2-3 meters) is preferred to prevent root damage from prolonged saturation.
*   **Soil Structure:** The soil should have a good crumb structure that allows for rapid infiltration and percolation of water. In areas with naturally poor drainage, practices like raised beds or the installation of subsurface drainage systems may be necessary to ensure adequate root zone aeration.
