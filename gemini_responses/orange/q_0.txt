Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist from Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I am pleased to provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Orange cultivation in Haryana.

It is crucial to implement an Integrated Disease Management (IDM) approach, combining cultural practices with judicious use of CIBRC approved fungicides. Always ensure proper diagnosis before applying any control measures.

Here's how to control the mentioned fungal diseases in Orange:

### 1. Alternaria (and Brown Spot)
*   **Affects Orange:** Yes, *Alternaria alternata* f. sp. *citri* causes Alternaria Brown Spot, a significant disease in citrus.
*   **Symptoms:** Characterized by small, irregular brown spots on young leaves, twigs, and fruit. These lesions enlarge, become necrotic, and can lead to defoliation, twig dieback, and premature fruit drop.
*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Prune and destroy infected twigs and leaves to reduce inoculum.
    *   Improve air circulation within the canopy through proper pruning.
    *   Avoid overhead irrigation, especially during periods of high humidity, to minimize leaf wetness.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Azoxystrobin** (0.5-1 ml/L of water or 200-250 g/acre)
    *   **Difenoconazole** (0.5 ml/L of water)
    *   **Mancozeb** (2.5 g/L of water)
    *   **Copper Oxychloride** (3 g/L of water) - particularly effective as a protectant.

### 2. Anthracnose
*   **Affects Orange:** Yes, *Colletotrichum gloeosporioides* causes Anthracnose in citrus.
*   **Symptoms:** Manifests as irregular brown spots on leaves, twig dieback, blossom blight, and fruit rot, especially on mature or stressed fruit.
*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Remove and destroy dead or diseased wood from the trees.
    *   Maintain tree vigor through balanced nutrition and proper irrigation.
    *   Ensure good orchard sanitation.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Carbendazim** (1 g/L of water)
    *   **Mancozeb** (2.5 g/L of water)
    *   **Copper Oxychloride** (3 g/L of water)
    *   **Azoxystrobin** (0.5-1 ml/L of water)
    *   **Thiophanate Methyl** (1 g/L of water)

### 3. Blast
*   **Affects Orange:** This is not known to affect Orange as a specific fungal disease (like rice blast). Bacterial blast caused by *Pseudomonas syringae* does occur, but the question specifies fungal diseases.

### 4. Blight
*   **Affects Orange:** Yes, various fungi can cause blight symptoms in Orange (e.g., *Phytophthora* species causing twig blight, *Colletotrichum* causing blossom blight, or severe *Alternaria* infections).
*   **Symptoms:** Rapid browning, wilting, and death of leaves, twigs, flowers, or fruit.
*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Prune and destroy all blighted plant parts.
    *   Improve soil drainage to prevent waterlogging, which can predispose trees to root and collar rot leading to blight.
    *   Maintain overall tree health to enhance resistance.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Copper Oxychloride** (3 g/L of water)
    *   **Mancozeb** (2.5 g/L of water)
    *   **Azoxystrobin** (0.5-1 ml/L of water)
    *   **Propiconazole** (0.5 ml/L of water)

### 5. Brown spot
*   **Affects Orange:** Yes, this is caused by *Alternaria alternata* f. sp. *citri* and is covered under the "Alternaria" section above.

### 6. Downy/Powdery mildew
*   **Downy Mildew:** This is not known to affect Orange as a significant disease.
*   **Powdery Mildew:** Yes, *Oidium citri* or *Erysiphe* species can cause powdery mildew in Orange, though it is generally considered a minor disease.
*   **Symptoms:** Characterized by white, powdery patches on young leaves, shoots, and sometimes fruit. Infected leaves may curl or distort.
*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Ensure good air circulation within the canopy through appropriate pruning.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Sulphur** (wettable powder, 2-3 g/L of water)
    *   **Difenoconazole** (0.5 ml/L of water)
    *   **Azoxystrobin** (0.5-1 ml/L of water)

### 7. Grey mildew
*   **Affects Orange:** This is not known to affect Orange as a recognized fungal disease. Grey mold (*Botrytis cinerea*) can affect citrus fruit post-harvest, but it is not typically referred to as "grey mildew" in the field.

**Important Considerations for Chemical Application:**
*   **Timing:** Apply fungicides preventively or at the very first sign of disease symptoms.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough coverage of all plant parts, especially the undersides of leaves.
*   **Rotation:** Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of fungicide resistance.
*   **Safety:** Always read and follow the instructions on the fungicide label, including dosage, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and personal protective equipment (PPE) recommendations.
