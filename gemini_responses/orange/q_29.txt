Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

Flower and fruit drop in Orange is a common physiological phenomenon, but excessive dropping can significantly reduce yield. As a Senior Agronomist, I will provide scientifically verified advice to manage this issue in Haryana.

**Understanding Dropping in Orange:**

Dropping in Orange refers to the premature shedding of flowers, young fruits, or mature fruits before harvest. This can be due to a combination of physiological, environmental, nutritional, and sometimes pest/disease factors.

**Common Causes of Dropping:**

*   **Physiological Stress:** The plant naturally sheds excess flowers and fruits to balance its energy reserves, especially during heavy flowering/fruiting.
*   **Nutritional Deficiencies:** Lack of essential micronutrients like Boron and Zinc, or an imbalance of major nutrients (NPK).
*   **Water Stress:** Both insufficient and excessive irrigation can lead to stress and subsequent drop.
*   **Temperature Extremes:** Very high or low temperatures during critical stages (flowering, fruit set).
*   **Hormonal Imbalance:** An imbalance of plant growth hormones (auxins, gibberellins, abscisic acid).
*   **Pests and Diseases:** Damage from pests (e.g., fruit flies, mites, thrips) or diseases (e.g., gummosis, root rot) can weaken the tree and cause drop.
*   **Environmental Factors:** Strong winds, hailstorms can physically dislodge flowers and fruits.

**Integrated Management Strategies:**

To effectively control dropping, an integrated approach combining good agricultural practices with targeted chemical interventions is recommended:

1.  **Balanced Nutrition:**
    *   Conduct regular soil and leaf analysis to identify nutrient deficiencies.
    *   Apply balanced NPK fertilizers as per recommendations for orange orchards in Haryana.
    *   Ensure adequate supply of micronutrients, especially Boron and Zinc, which are crucial for flower and fruit retention.

2.  **Optimal Irrigation:**
    *   Maintain consistent soil moisture, especially during flowering and fruit development stages.
    *   Avoid both waterlogging and severe drought stress. Drip irrigation is highly recommended for efficient water management.

3.  **Pest and Disease Management:**
    *   Regularly scout for pests like fruit flies, mites, and thrips, and diseases like gummosis.
    *   Implement timely and appropriate control measures as per HAU recommendations to keep the trees healthy and vigorous.

4.  **Canopy Management:**
    *   Proper pruning helps maintain a balanced canopy, improves light penetration, and air circulation, reducing stress on the tree.

**Specific Chemical Interventions (CIBRC Approved):**

For targeted control of flower and fruit drop, certain plant growth regulators and micronutrients can be applied:

*   **For Flower and Early Fruit Drop:**
    *   **Boron (as Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate 20%):**
        *   **Dosage:** 100-150 g per 100 litres of water.
        *   **Application:** Foliar spray before flowering and again at the pea-size fruit stage. Boron is vital for pollen viability and fruit set.
    *   **Zinc (as Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate 21%):**
        *   **Dosage:** 200-300 g per 100 litres of water.
        *   **Application:** Foliar spray during new flush growth and at fruit development stages. Zinc is essential for hormone synthesis and overall plant vigor.

*   **For Pre-Harvest Fruit Drop (Late Fruit Drop):**
    *   **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA) 4.5% SL:**
        *   **Dosage:** 10-20 ml per 100 litres of water.
        *   **Application:** Apply as a foliar spray when fruits are at the pea-size stage, and a second application can be given 4-6 weeks before the anticipated harvest, if needed, to prevent pre-harvest drop.
    *   **2,4-D (2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) Sodium Salt 80% WP:**
        *   **Dosage:** 1.25-2.5 g per 100 litres of water. (Note: This is a very low concentration. Higher concentrations are used as herbicides. Use with extreme caution and precision).
        *   **Application:** Apply as a foliar spray when fruits are about 2-3 cm in diameter, or 4-6 weeks before the anticipated drop. This helps in delaying the formation of the abscission layer, thus reducing fruit drop.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions on the product label.
*   Ensure thorough spray coverage for effective results.
*   Avoid spraying during extreme temperatures or strong winds.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your orchard conditions.

Regarding "Tinda/Boll dropping": This is not known to affect Orange. Tinda is a cucurbit vegetable, and boll dropping is a phenomenon associated with cotton.
