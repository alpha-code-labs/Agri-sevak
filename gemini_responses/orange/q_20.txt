Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the critical importance of balanced nutrition for optimal Orange (Citrus sinensis) production in our region. Micronutrient deficiencies can significantly impact yield and fruit quality.

Before applying any corrective measures, it is **highly recommended to conduct soil and leaf tissue analysis**. Visual symptoms can sometimes be misleading, and precise diagnosis ensures effective and economical treatment.

Here's how to address the specified micronutrient deficiencies in Orange:

### General Recommendations for Micronutrient Application:
*   Foliar sprays are generally preferred for quick correction of micronutrient deficiencies in citrus, especially for Zinc, Iron, Boron, and Manganese, as they allow for rapid absorption by the leaves.
*   Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage during spraying.
*   Avoid spraying during hot midday hours or when rain is expected.
*   Always use clean water for mixing and follow safety precautions.
*   Combine with a non-ionic spreader/sticker for better efficacy, if recommended on the product label.

### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Small, narrow leaves (often called 'little leaf'), interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) with green veins, often giving a mottled appearance. New growth is most severely affected. Reduced fruit size and yield.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Spray:**
        *   **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (21% Zn): 0.5% - 1.0% solution (5-10 g/L of water).
        *   **Zinc EDTA** (12% Zn): 0.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Timing:** Apply during new flushes of growth (e.g., spring, monsoon, autumn flushes). Repeat if symptoms persist.
    *   **Soil Application (for severe or persistent deficiency, based on soil test):**
        *   **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate**: 10-20 kg/acre, broadcast and incorporated into the soil.

### 2. Iron (Fe) / Ferrous Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Pronounced interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, with veins remaining distinctly green. In severe cases, the entire leaf may turn pale yellow or almost white, leading to defoliation and dieback. Often observed in high pH (alkaline) or calcareous soils.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Spray:**
        *   **Ferrous sulphate heptahydrate** (19% Fe): 0.5% - 1.0% solution (5-10 g/L of water). Often less effective on its own due to poor absorption.
        *   **Iron EDTA** (12% Fe): 0.5 g/L of water. More effective for foliar application.
    *   **Soil Application (most effective for persistent issues in alkaline soils):**
        *   **Iron EDDHA** (6% Fe): 10-20 g per tree, depending on tree size and severity. Apply in the root zone. This chelated form is highly stable and available in alkaline conditions.
        *   **Ferrous sulphate heptahydrate**: Can be applied to soil at 20-40 kg/acre, but its availability is limited in high pH soils.

### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Dieback of terminal shoots, gumming on twigs and fruit, corky veins, fruit cracking, hard and lumpy fruit, small and misshapen fruit, premature fruit drop. Young leaves may be thick, brittle, and curled.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Spray:**
        *   **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (20% B): 1.0 - 1.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Boric acid** (17% B): 1.0 g/L of water.
    *   **Timing:** Apply before flowering or during fruit set for best results.
    *   **Soil Application (use with extreme caution, as the margin between deficiency and toxicity is narrow):**
        *   **Borax** (11% B) or **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate**: 5-10 kg/acre, based on soil test recommendations.

### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Relatively rare as a primary deficiency in Orange in most soils, but can occur in highly acidic soils or with imbalances of other nutrients. Symptoms include dieback of growing points, stunted root growth, premature fruit drop, and poor fruit quality. Leaves may be small and distorted.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Spray:**
        *   **Calcium nitrate** (19% Ca): 0.5% - 1.0% solution (5-10 g/L of water).
        *   **Calcium chloride** (27% Ca): 0.5% solution (5 g/L of water).
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   **Gypsum** (Calcium sulphate dihydrate, 23% Ca): 200-400 kg/acre, especially beneficial in sodic soils.
        *   **Calcium carbonate** (Lime, 35-40% Ca): If soil pH is low and calcium is needed.
        *   **Calcium nitrate**: As a regular fertilizer source.

### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, starting from the tip and margins, leaving a characteristic green inverted 'V' shape at the base of the leaf. In severe cases, leaves become bronze or yellow and drop prematurely. Reduced fruit size and yield.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Spray:**
        *   **Magnesium sulphate heptahydrate** (Epsom salt, 9.6% Mg): 1.0% - 2.0% solution (10-20 g/L of water).
    *   **Timing:** Apply when symptoms appear, often during fruit development.
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   **Magnesium sulphate heptahydrate**: 20-40 kg/acre.
        *   **Dolomitic lime** (Calcium magnesium carbonate): If soil pH is low and both calcium and magnesium are required.

### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on young to mature leaves, similar to zinc but less distinct mottling, often appearing as a fine network of green veins on a lighter green background. Leaves may appear dull.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Spray:**
        *   **Manganese sulphate monohydrate** (30.5% Mn): 0.5% - 1.0% solution (5-10 g/L of water).
        *   **Manganese EDTA** (12% Mn): 0.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Timing:** Apply during new flushes of growth.
    *   **Soil Application (less common for quick fix, can be fixed in high pH soils):**
        *   **Manganese sulphate monohydrate**: 10-20 kg/acre.

**Important Considerations for Haryana:**

*   **Soil pH:** Many soils in Haryana are alkaline. High pH can significantly reduce the availability of Iron, Zinc, and Manganese. Using chelated forms (EDTA, EDDHA) for foliar or soil application is often more effective in such conditions.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management:** Always consider these applications as part of a comprehensive nutrient management plan that includes balanced NPK fertilization, organic matter addition, and proper irrigation.
*   **Safety:** Always read and follow the instructions and safety precautions on the product labels. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application.

By carefully diagnosing and addressing these micronutrient deficiencies, you can significantly improve the health, productivity, and fruit quality of your Orange orchards.
