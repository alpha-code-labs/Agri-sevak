Controlling weeds in an orange orchard is crucial for optimal tree health, growth, and yield. An integrated approach combining cultural, mechanical, and chemical methods is most effective. Here's a scientifically verified approach for managing the specified weeds in Orange orchards in Haryana:

**General Weed Management Principles:**

*   **Clean Cultivation:** Keep the area around the tree basin (at least 1-1.5 meter radius) free of weeds, especially for young trees.
*   **Mulching:** Applying organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves, wood chips) around the tree base can suppress weed growth, conserve moisture, and improve soil health.
*   **Mechanical Weeding:** Manual weeding or shallow cultivation can be effective for young weeds, especially in the tree basin. Avoid deep cultivation that can damage feeder roots.
*   **Directed Sprays:** When using herbicides, always use directed sprays, ensuring the chemical does not come into contact with the orange tree's trunk, branches, or foliage, especially for non-selective herbicides. Use a protective shield if necessary.

**Specific Weed Control Measures:**

**1. Broadleaf Weeds (e.g., Bathu, Congress grass) and Narrowleaf Weeds (Grasses, including Phalaris minor if present):**

These common weeds compete with orange trees for water, nutrients, and sunlight.

*   **Post-Emergent Herbicides (for actively growing weeds):**
    *   **Glyphosate (41% SL):** A non-selective, systemic herbicide. Apply at 4-5 litres per acre in 200 litres of water, or 20-25 ml per litre of water for spot treatment. Apply when weeds are actively growing and have sufficient leaf area to absorb the herbicide. Avoid contact with orange tree foliage and green bark.
    *   **Paraquat dichloride (24% SL):** A non-selective, contact herbicide. Apply at 1-2 litres per acre in 200 litres of water, or 5-10 ml per litre of water for spot treatment. Provides quick knockdown of weeds. Avoid contact with orange tree foliage and green bark.
    *   **Glufosinate-ammonium (13.5% SL):** A non-selective, contact herbicide. Apply at 1.5-2.5 litres per acre in 200 litres of water, or 7.5-12.5 ml per litre of water for spot treatment. Avoid contact with orange tree foliage and green bark.

*   **Pre-Emergent Herbicides (for preventing weed germination):**
    *   **Pendimethalin (30% EC):** Apply at 1.2-1.6 litres per acre in 200 litres of water to a clean, moist soil surface before weed emergence. Effective against many annual grasses and some broadleaf weeds.
    *   **Oxyfluorfen (23.5% EC):** Apply at 400-800 ml per acre in 200 litres of water to a clean, moist soil surface before weed emergence. Effective against many broadleaf weeds and some grasses.
    *   **Diuron (80% WP):** Apply at 0.8-1.6 kg per acre in 200 litres of water to a clean, moist soil surface before weed emergence. Effective against many annual grasses and broadleaf weeds.
    *   **Simazine (50% WP):** Apply at 0.8-1.6 kg per acre in 200 litres of water to a clean, moist soil surface before weed emergence. Effective against many annual grasses and broadleaf weeds.

**2. Amarbail (Cuscuta spp.):**

Amarbail is a parasitic weed that can severely affect host plants.

*   **Manual Removal:** This is the most effective method. Carefully remove Amarbail strands as soon as they are noticed, ensuring no fragments are left behind, and destroy them away from the orchard. If it has attached to the orange tree, prune the affected branch if feasible, ensuring the Amarbail is completely removed.
*   **Directed Spot Application (with extreme caution):** For small, isolated patches of Amarbail on the ground or on non-essential weeds, a very carefully directed spot application of **Paraquat dichloride (24% SL)** at 5-10 ml per litre of water can be used to burn off the parasite. **Extreme care must be taken to prevent any spray drift or contact with the orange trees, as it is highly phytotoxic.**
*   **Pre-emergent suppression:** While not a direct control, applying **Pendimethalin (30% EC)** as a pre-emergent herbicide (as mentioned above) can help suppress the germination of Cuscuta seeds in the soil.

**3. Orobanche (Broomrape):**

This is not known to affect Orange. Orobanche species are typically parasitic on the roots of dicotyledonous crops like mustard, tobacco, tomato, and potato, not on perennial fruit trees like Orange.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Read Labels:** Always read and strictly follow the instructions, precautions, and safety guidelines provided on the herbicide product label.
*   **Timing:** Apply herbicides when weeds are young and actively growing for best results. Pre-emergent herbicides must be applied before weed seeds germinate.
*   **Weather Conditions:** Avoid spraying on windy days to prevent drift. Ensure no rain is expected for at least 6-8 hours after application for systemic herbicides.
*   **Water Quality:** Use clean water for mixing herbicides.
*   **Rotation of Herbicides:** To prevent the development of herbicide resistance, it is advisable to rotate herbicides with different modes of action.
*   **Safety Gear:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (gloves, mask, protective clothing, eye protection) while handling and spraying chemicals.
