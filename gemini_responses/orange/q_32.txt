Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

The symptom of "drying up" in Orange (drying branches, leaves, fruits, and flowers) is a general indication of severe stress or disease, rather than a single specific condition. As Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I strongly advise a thorough field inspection to accurately diagnose the underlying cause, as the treatment will vary significantly depending on what is causing the problem.

Here are the potential causes and recommended approaches:

### **I. Abiotic Factors (Environmental and Cultural Stress)**

These are often the primary culprits for widespread drying symptoms:

1.  **Water Stress:**
    *   **Water Deficit (Drought):** Prolonged lack of water leads to wilting, leaf drop, and branch dieback.
    *   **Waterlogging (Excess Water):** Poor drainage or over-irrigation can lead to root rot (e.g., Phytophthora root rot), which damages the root system, preventing water and nutrient uptake, causing symptoms similar to drought.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Ensure proper irrigation schedules based on soil moisture and plant needs.
        *   Improve drainage in the orchard to prevent water stagnation.
        *   Apply mulch around the tree base to conserve soil moisture and regulate temperature.

2.  **Nutrient Deficiencies:**
    *   Severe deficiencies of certain nutrients like Potassium, Calcium, or Boron can lead to leaf tip burn, marginal necrosis, and twig dieback.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Conduct regular soil and leaf tissue analysis to identify specific deficiencies.
        *   Apply balanced fertilizers as per recommendations.

3.  **Soil Salinity/Alkalinity:**
    *   High salt content or alkaline pH in the soil can hinder water and nutrient uptake, leading to leaf burn and dieback.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Soil testing is crucial.
        *   Use gypsum for alkaline soils.
        *   Leaching with good quality water (if available and drainage is good).

4.  **Temperature Extremes:**
    *   Severe heat stress or frost damage can cause sudden drying of leaves, twigs, and flowers.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Provide shade during extreme heat.
        *   Protect young trees from frost using covers or light irrigation.

5.  **Herbicide Drift:**
    *   Accidental exposure to herbicides used in adjacent fields can cause severe damage, leading to drying and defoliation.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Exercise extreme caution when applying herbicides near citrus orchards.

### **II. Biotic Factors (Diseases and Pests)**

If abiotic factors are ruled out, consider these biological causes:

1.  **Citrus Greening (Huanglongbing - HLB):**
    *   This is a devastating bacterial disease spread by the Citrus Psylla. Symptoms include yellowing of leaves (often asymmetrical), stunted growth, twig dieback, premature fruit drop, and small, misshapen fruits. The entire tree gradually declines and dries up.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Vector Control:** Manage Citrus Psylla populations.
            *   Spray with **Imidacloprid** @ 0.3-0.5 ml/L of water or **Thiamethoxam** @ 0.2-0.4 g/L of water.
        *   **Removal of Infected Trees:** Severely infected trees should be promptly removed and destroyed to prevent further spread.
        *   Use disease-free planting material.

2.  **Gummosis / Root Rot (Phytophthora spp.):**
    *   Often associated with waterlogging, this fungal disease causes rotting of roots and collar region, leading to yellowing, defoliation, dieback, and gum exudation on the trunk.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Improve drainage.
        *   Avoid injury to the trunk and roots.
        *   Apply fungicides as a drench or paint on affected areas.
            *   Drench with **Copper Oxychloride** @ 2-3 g/L of water around the base of the tree.
            *   Alternatively, paint the affected trunk area with a paste of **Copper Oxychloride**.

3.  **Dieback (Diplodia natalensis, Phomopsis citri):**
    *   These fungal diseases cause drying of twigs and branches, typically starting from the tip and progressing downwards.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Prune and destroy all affected branches well below the dried portion.
        *   Apply a protective fungicide spray after pruning.
            *   Spray with **Carbendazim** @ 0.5-1 g/L of water or **Propiconazole** @ 0.5 ml/L of water.

4.  **Anthracnose (Colletotrichum gloeosporioides):**
    *   Can cause twig blight, leaf spots, and fruit rot, leading to drying of affected parts, especially during humid conditions.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Prune out dead and diseased wood.
        *   Spray with **Carbendazim** @ 0.5-1 g/L of water or **Copper Oxychloride** @ 2-3 g/L of water.

5.  **Citrus Canker (Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri):**
    *   While primarily causing lesions on leaves, stems, and fruits, severe infections can lead to defoliation and twig dieback, contributing to the overall drying appearance.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Prune and destroy severely infected branches.
        *   Spray with **Copper Oxychloride** @ 2-3 g/L of water.

6.  **Stem/Twig Borers:**
    *   Larvae of certain insects bore into the stem or twigs, disrupting nutrient and water flow, leading to sudden wilting and drying of branches above the point of attack. Look for sawdust-like frass or entry holes.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Prune and destroy affected branches.
        *   If a borer hole is identified, inject a suitable insecticide (e.g., **Chlorpyrifos** diluted as per label instructions for localized application) into the hole and seal it.

### **General Management Strategies:**

*   **Pruning:** Regularly remove all dead, diseased, or weak branches. Ensure clean cuts and sterilize pruning tools.
*   **Orchard Sanitation:** Remove and destroy fallen leaves, fruits, and pruned material to reduce inoculum sources.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure the trees receive adequate and balanced nutrients based on soil test reports.
*   **Proper Irrigation:** Avoid both water scarcity and waterlogging.
*   **Weed Control:** Keep the orchard free of weeds to reduce competition for nutrients and water.
*   **Regular Monitoring:** Inspect your trees regularly for early signs of stress, disease, or pest infestation.

**Recommendation:**

Given the complexity of "drying up" symptoms, it is highly recommended that you bring samples of the affected branches, leaves, and fruits to the Department of Horticulture or Plant Pathology at HAU, Hisar, or contact our field experts for an on-site diagnosis. This will ensure the most accurate identification of the problem and lead to the most effective treatment plan for your orange orchard.
