Namaste, as a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling Scab, Canker, Gummosis, and Lichen in Orange orchards in Haryana. It is crucial to adopt an integrated approach combining cultural practices with timely and appropriate chemical interventions using CIBRC-approved products.

Here are the control measures for each condition:

### 1. Citrus Scab (caused by *Elsinoë fawcettii*)

*   **Impact:** This fungal disease causes raised, corky lesions on fruit, leaves, and twigs, leading to reduced fruit quality and marketability.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Cultural:** Prune infected twigs and leaves during dry periods. Ensure good air circulation within the canopy.
    *   **Chemical:** Apply fungicides during new flush emergence and fruit set stages.
        *   **Copper Oxychloride:** Spray at 2.5-3.0 g/L of water.
        *   **Azoxystrobin:** Spray at 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water.
        *   **Difenoconazole:** Spray at 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   Rotate fungicides to prevent resistance development.

### 2. Citrus Canker (caused by *Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri*)

*   **Impact:** This highly contagious bacterial disease causes raised, corky lesions with a water-soaked margin and yellow halo on leaves, stems, and fruit, leading to premature fruit drop and reduced tree vigor.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Cultural:**
        *   Plant disease-free nursery stock.
        *   Prune and destroy infected branches immediately, especially after rainfall. Disinfect pruning tools with a 10% bleach solution.
        *   Establish windbreaks around the orchard to minimize wind-driven rain and spread of bacteria.
        *   Avoid overhead irrigation.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   **Copper Oxychloride:** Spray at 2.5-3.0 g/L of water, especially before anticipated rainfall or during periods of new flush growth. Multiple applications may be required.

### 3. Gummosis (often caused by *Phytophthora* species)

*   **Impact:** Characterized by the oozing of gum from the trunk or main branches, bark discoloration, and cankers, leading to bark decay, girdling, and eventual tree decline.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Cultural:**
        *   Avoid mechanical injuries to the trunk and roots.
        *   Ensure proper drainage and avoid water stagnation around the tree base.
        *   Plant trees on mounds in heavy soils.
        *   Avoid planting too deep; the bud union should be well above the soil line.
        *   Scrape off infected bark and paint the wound.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   **Potassium Phosphonate:** Foliar spray at 2.5-3.0 ml/L of water or apply as a trunk paint/drench at 5-10 ml/L of water (mixed with an equal volume of water for painting).
        *   **Fosetyl-aluminium:** Foliar spray at 2.5-3.0 g/L of water.
        *   **Copper Oxychloride:** Prepare a paste (50 g/L of water) and paint the affected trunk area after scraping off the infected bark.

### 4. Lichen

*   **Impact:** Lichens are symbiotic organisms (fungus and alga) that grow on tree bark. They are generally not parasitic but can indicate poor tree vigor, excessive shade, or high humidity. Dense growth can harbor pests and reduce photosynthetic activity of the bark.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Cultural:**
        *   Improve tree vigor through proper nutrition and irrigation.
        *   Prune to improve air circulation and light penetration within the canopy.
        *   Gently scrub off lichens from the bark using a stiff brush during dry weather.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   **Copper Oxychloride:** Spray at 2.5-3.0 g/L of water during dormant periods or when lichen growth is excessive. This helps to reduce their growth.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label for safe and effective use.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during chemical application.
*   Monitor your orchard regularly for early detection of diseases and pests.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension specialists for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions.
