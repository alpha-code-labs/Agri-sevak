As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I emphasize that addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium) in Orange (Citrus sinensis) is critical for maintaining tree health, productivity, and fruit quality. Accurate diagnosis through soil and leaf tissue analysis is paramount before applying any fertilizers, as visual symptoms can sometimes be misleading or indicative of multiple issues. The following recommendations are based on scientific principles and common practices suitable for Haryana's conditions.

**General Recommendations for Macro-nutrient Management:**

*   **Soil Testing:** Conduct regular soil tests (every 2-3 years) to determine the current nutrient status, pH, and organic matter content of your orchard soil. This is the most reliable way to identify deficiencies.
*   **Leaf Tissue Analysis:** When visual symptoms appear, or for fine-tuning nutrient management, leaf tissue analysis provides a precise diagnosis of the tree's actual nutrient uptake.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management (INM):** Combine chemical fertilizers with organic manures (e.g., well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure, vermicompost) to improve soil health, microbial activity, and nutrient use efficiency.
*   **Split Applications:** Apply macro-nutrients, especially Nitrogen and Potassium, in multiple split doses throughout the year to match the tree's physiological demand and minimize nutrient losses through leaching or volatilization.
*   **Irrigation:** Always ensure adequate irrigation after soil application of fertilizers to facilitate nutrient dissolution and uptake by roots.

**Specific Recommendations for Macro-nutrient Deficiencies:**

**1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency:**
Nitrogen is crucial for vegetative growth, leaf development, and fruit set.
*   **Symptoms:** General yellowing (chlorosis) of older leaves, stunted growth, reduced leaf size, poor flowering, and small, pale green fruits. In severe cases, leaves may drop prematurely.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   For mature bearing Orange trees (5+ years old), apply 200-300 g of actual Nitrogen per tree per year. This can be achieved using:
            *   **Urea** (46% N): Approximately 435-650 g per tree per year.
            *   **Ammonium Sulphate** (20.6% N): Approximately 970-1450 g per tree per year.
            *   **Calcium Ammonium Nitrate (CAN)** (25% N): Approximately 800-1200 g per tree per year.
        *   **Timing:** Apply in 2-3 split doses: first during fruit set (February-March), second during fruit development (May-June), and a third if needed (August-September).
        *   **Method:** Apply in a ring around the tree canopy, 30-60 cm away from the trunk, and lightly incorporate into the soil, followed by irrigation.
    *   **Foliar Application (for quick correction or mild deficiency):**
        *   Spray a 1-2% solution of **Urea** (10-20 g/L of water).
        *   **Timing:** Apply during cooler parts of the day, avoiding flowering periods. Repeat after 15-20 days if necessary.

**2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency:**
Phosphorus is essential for root development, flowering, fruiting, and energy transfer within the plant.
*   **Symptoms:** Dull, bronze-purple discoloration of older leaves, reduced leaf expansion, poor root development, delayed flowering, and small, hard fruits with thick rind.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   For mature bearing Orange trees, apply 50-100 g of actual Phosphorus (P2O5) per tree per year. This can be achieved using:
            *   **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5): Approximately 310-625 g per tree per year.
            *   **Di-Ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (46% P2O5, 18% N): Approximately 110-220 g per tree per year (adjust Nitrogen application accordingly if using DAP).
        *   **Timing:** Apply the full dose once a year, preferably before the main flush of growth or flowering (January-February).
        *   **Method:** Apply in a ring around the tree canopy and incorporate into the soil, followed by irrigation. Phosphorus is less mobile in soil, so placement near the root zone is important.

**3. Potassium (K) Deficiency:**
Potassium plays a vital role in fruit quality (size, sweetness, rind thickness), water regulation, and disease resistance.
*   **Symptoms:** Yellowing and necrosis (scorching/browning) of leaf margins, especially on older leaves, reduced fruit size, poor fruit quality (low sugar, thick rind), and increased susceptibility to diseases.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   For mature bearing Orange trees, apply 150-250 g of actual Potassium (K2O) per tree per year. This can be achieved using:
            *   **Muriate of Potash (Potassium Chloride)** (60% K2O): Approximately 250-415 g per tree per year.
            *   **Sulphate of Potash (Potassium Sulphate)** (50% K2O): Approximately 300-500 g per tree per year.
        *   **Timing:** Apply in 2-3 split doses: first during fruit set (February-March), second during fruit development (May-June), and a third if needed (August-September).
        *   **Method:** Apply in a ring around the tree canopy and incorporate into the soil, followed by irrigation.
    *   **Foliar Application (for quick correction or mild deficiency):**
        *   Spray a 1-2% solution of **Potassium Nitrate** (10-20 g/L of water) or **Potassium Sulphate** (10-20 g/L of water).
        *   **Timing:** Apply during cooler parts of the day. Repeat after 15-20 days if necessary.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Soil pH:** Orange trees prefer slightly acidic to neutral soils (pH 6.0-7.0). Extreme pH can significantly affect nutrient availability and uptake.
*   **Tree Age and Yield:** Adjust fertilizer doses based on the age of the tree and its expected yield. Young, non-bearing trees require lower doses.
*   **Water Management:** Adequate and timely irrigation is essential for nutrient uptake and overall tree health.
*   **Organic Matter:** Regular incorporation of organic matter improves soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability, enhancing the efficiency of applied fertilizers.
