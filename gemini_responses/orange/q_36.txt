Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I am pleased to provide scientifically verified advice to help you improve the yield, fruit quality, and storage life of your orange crop in Haryana.

Achieving these goals requires an integrated approach focusing on nutrition, water management, canopy management, and pest/disease control.

### **I. Improving Yield**

To maximize the number of fruits per tree and overall productivity:

1.  **Balanced Nutrition:**
    *   **Nitrogen (N):** Essential for vegetative growth and fruit set. Apply in split doses.
        *   Recommendation: 200-300 kg **Urea** per acre per year, split into 3-4 applications.
    *   **Phosphorus (P):** Crucial for root development, flowering, and fruit development.
        *   Recommendation: 100-150 kg **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** per acre per year.
    *   **Potassium (K):** Vital for fruit size, sugar accumulation, and overall plant vigor.
        *   Recommendation: 200-300 kg **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** per acre per year, split into 2-3 applications.
    *   **Micronutrients:** Deficiencies can severely limit yield.
        *   **Zinc (Zn):** Apply foliar spray of 0.5% **Zinc Sulphate** (5 g/L water) during new flush emergence.
        *   **Boron (B):** Apply foliar spray of 0.1% **Borax** (1 g/L water) before flowering and at fruit set.
        *   **Manganese (Mn):** Apply foliar spray of 0.5% **Manganese Sulphate** (5 g/L water) if deficiency symptoms appear.
    *   *Always conduct a soil test to determine precise nutrient requirements.*

2.  **Efficient Water Management:**
    *   **Irrigation:** Oranges require consistent moisture, especially during flowering, fruit set, and fruit development.
    *   **Drip Irrigation:** Highly recommended for efficient water use and direct delivery to the root zone, reducing water stress.
    *   Schedule irrigation based on soil moisture and weather conditions. Avoid waterlogging and severe drought stress.

3.  **Canopy Management (Pruning):**
    *   **Training:** Train young trees to a strong framework.
    *   **Annual Pruning:** Remove dead, diseased, crossing, and weak branches. Thin out dense canopy to allow light penetration and air circulation, which promotes flowering and fruit development on inner branches.
    *   **Skirting:** Remove branches touching the ground to prevent pest and disease entry.

4.  **Pest and Disease Management:**
    *   Implement an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategy to control major pests (e.g., citrus psylla, leaf miner, fruit fly) and diseases (e.g., citrus canker, gummosis) that can reduce yield.
    *   Consult HAU experts for specific pest/disease identification and CIBRC-approved chemical recommendations if cultural methods are insufficient.

### **II. Improving Fruit Quality**

High-quality oranges are characterized by good size, uniform color, high juice content, desirable sugar-acid ratio, and absence of blemishes.

1.  **Nutrient Management (Specific for Quality):**
    *   **Potassium (K):** Crucial for sugar accumulation, fruit size, and color development. Ensure adequate **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** application as mentioned above.
    *   **Calcium (Ca):** Improves fruit firmness, reduces physiological disorders, and enhances shelf life.
        *   Recommendation: Foliar sprays of 0.5-1.0% **Calcium Nitrate** (5-10 g/L water) at 30-45 days intervals, starting from fruit set.
    *   **Boron (B):** Essential for pollen germination, fruit set, and preventing fruit malformation. Ensure adequate **Borax** application.
    *   **Zinc (Zn):** Important for overall tree health, which reflects in fruit quality. Ensure adequate **Zinc Sulphate** application.

2.  **Water Management:**
    *   Consistent irrigation prevents fruit cracking and promotes uniform fruit development. Avoid sudden changes in soil moisture, especially during fruit enlargement.

3.  **Canopy Management:**
    *   Proper pruning ensures good light penetration to all parts of the canopy, leading to better fruit color development and uniform ripening.

4.  **Timely Harvesting:**
    *   Harvest fruits at optimal maturity. Harvesting too early results in sour, small fruits, while harvesting too late can lead to over-ripening, reduced juice content, and increased susceptibility to post-harvest decay. Use a refractometer to check Brix (sugar content).

5.  **Pest and Disease Control:**
    *   Effective control of pests (e.g., fruit fly, mites) and diseases (e.g., citrus canker, scab) prevents blemishes and maintains the aesthetic appeal and market value of the fruit.

### **III. Improving Storage Life**

Extending the storage life of oranges reduces post-harvest losses and allows for better market timing.

1.  **Pre-harvest Treatments:**
    *   **Calcium (Ca) Sprays:** As mentioned for quality, foliar applications of **Calcium Nitrate** (0.5-1.0% or 5-10 g/L water) starting from fruit set and continuing up to 2-3 weeks before harvest significantly improve fruit firmness and reduce susceptibility to chilling injury and post-harvest rots.
    *   **Fungicide Sprays (if necessary):** In orchards with a history of specific post-harvest diseases (e.g., stem-end rot, anthracnose), a pre-harvest spray of a CIBRC-approved fungicide like **Thiophanate-methyl** (0.1% or 1 g/L water) 10-15 days before harvest can reduce initial inoculum. *Always adhere to the recommended pre-harvest interval (PHI).*

2.  **Optimal Maturity at Harvest:**
    *   Harvest fruits when they have reached physiological maturity but are not over-ripe. Over-ripe fruits have a shorter shelf life.

3.  **Gentle Harvesting and Handling:**
    *   Harvest fruits carefully using clippers to avoid pulling and tearing the fruit stem or skin.
    *   Avoid dropping or bruising fruits during collection and transport. Any physical damage creates entry points for pathogens.
    *   Use clean harvesting tools and containers.

4.  **Sanitation:**
    *   Remove fallen fruits and plant debris from the orchard floor regularly to reduce sources of infection.
    *   Clean and sanitize packing house equipment and storage areas.

5.  **Post-harvest Treatments (Packing House Level):**
    *   **Washing:** Wash fruits with clean water, possibly containing a mild disinfectant, to remove dirt and surface contaminants.
    *   **Waxing:** Application of food-grade wax can reduce moisture loss and improve appearance, thereby extending shelf life.
    *   **Fungicide Dips/Sprays:** In commercial packing houses, fruits are often treated with CIBRC-approved post-harvest fungicides (e.g., **Imazalil**, **Thiabendazole**) to control common storage rots. *This is typically done at a dedicated packing facility.*

6.  **Proper Storage Conditions:**
    *   **Temperature:** Store oranges at optimal cool temperatures, typically 5-7°C, depending on the variety.
    *   **Humidity:** Maintain high relative humidity (90-95%) to minimize weight loss and shriveling.
    *   **Ventilation:** Ensure good air circulation in storage to prevent accumulation of ethylene and other gases.

By diligently implementing these practices, you can significantly enhance the yield, quality, and storage life of your orange crop, leading to better returns. For specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions, I strongly advise regular soil and leaf tissue analysis and consultation with HAU experts.
