As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Dieback, Twig blight, and Tikka disease in Orange cultivation in Haryana.

### Control of Dieback in Orange

Dieback in orange is a complex condition often caused by a combination of factors including nutrient deficiencies (especially micronutrients like Zinc, Copper, Manganese, Boron), water stress (both excess and deficit), soil salinity/alkalinity, root damage, and fungal infections (e.g., *Colletotrichum gloeosporioides*).

**Integrated Management Strategies:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Pruning:** Regularly remove all dead, diseased, and weak twigs and branches. Prune well into the healthy wood. Sterilize pruning tools with a 10% bleach solution or methylated spirit between cuts to prevent disease spread.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure balanced nutrition. Conduct soil and leaf analysis to identify specific deficiencies.
        *   Apply recommended doses of macro and micronutrients.
        *   Foliar spray of micronutrient mixture (e.g., Zinc sulphate 0.5%, Copper sulphate 0.2%, Manganese sulphate 0.2%, Borax 0.1%) can help correct deficiencies.
    *   **Water Management:** Provide optimal irrigation. Avoid both waterlogging and severe drought stress. Use drip irrigation for efficient water use.
    *   **Soil Health:** Improve soil drainage and aeration. Avoid deep cultivation that can damage roots.
    *   **Pest Control:** Manage insect pests that can cause wounds and facilitate fungal entry.

2.  **Chemical Control (if fungal infection is suspected/confirmed):**
    *   After pruning, apply a protective fungicide spray.
    *   **Copper oxychloride**: Spray at a concentration of 2.5-3 g/L of water.
    *   **Carbendazim**: Spray at a concentration of 1 g/L of water.
    *   Repeat sprays may be necessary, especially during periods conducive to fungal growth.

### Control of Twig Blight in Orange

Twig blight in orange is primarily a fungal disease, often caused by pathogens like *Colletotrichum gloeosporioides* or *Botryodiplodia theobromae*. It leads to the drying and death of twigs, often progressing downwards.

**Integrated Management Strategies:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Pruning:** Immediately remove all blighted twigs and branches, cutting several centimeters into the healthy wood. Dispose of pruned material away from the orchard. Sterilize pruning tools.
    *   **Orchard Sanitation:** Keep the orchard clean by removing fallen leaves and fruit, which can harbor pathogens.
    *   **Maintain Tree Vigor:** Ensure trees are healthy and well-nourished to increase their resistance to disease. Follow proper irrigation and fertilization schedules.

2.  **Chemical Control:**
    *   After pruning, apply a protective fungicide spray to the entire tree.
    *   **Copper oxychloride**: Spray at a concentration of 2.5-3 g/L of water.
    *   **Mancozeb**: Spray at a concentration of 2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Carbendazim**: Spray at a concentration of 1 g/L of water.
    *   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development. Apply sprays at critical growth stages or when environmental conditions favor disease development.

### Tikka Disease in Orange

This is not known to affect Orange. Tikka disease is a common fungal disease primarily affecting groundnut (peanut) crops.
