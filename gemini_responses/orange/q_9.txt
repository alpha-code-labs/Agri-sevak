Mites, including Red spider mite (Tetranychus urticae) and Rust mite (Phyllocoptruta oleivora), are significant pests of Orange in Haryana. Effective control requires a combination of cultural practices and judicious use of acaricides.

**Symptoms of Mite Infestation:**

*   **Red Spider Mite:** Causes stippling (tiny yellow or white spots) on leaves, leading to bronzing or silvering. In severe cases, leaves may drop. Fine webbing may be visible on the undersides of leaves and between branches.
*   **Rust Mite:** Primarily affects fruit, causing a characteristic bronzing or russeting of the peel, making it rough and dull. On leaves, it can cause a greasy appearance or bronzing.

**Control Measures:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Regular Monitoring:** Inspect trees frequently, especially the undersides of leaves and developing fruits, to detect mite populations early.
    *   **Proper Irrigation:** Avoid water stress, as stressed plants are more susceptible to mite infestations.
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the orchard floor free of weeds, as they can act as alternate hosts for mites.
    *   **Pruning:** Ensure good air circulation within the canopy through proper pruning, which can reduce mite build-up.
    *   **Conservation of Natural Enemies:** Protect beneficial insects and predatory mites (e.g., *Amblyseius* species) that naturally prey on pest mites. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these natural enemies.

2.  **Chemical Control (Acaricides):**
    When mite populations reach damaging levels, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development. Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and on fruits.

    The following CIBRC approved technical chemicals are recommended for mite control in Orange:

    *   **For Red Spider Mite and Rust Mite:**
        *   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP:** Apply at 2.0-3.0 g/L of water. This is effective against both mites and also helps in managing powdery mildew.
        *   **Abamectin 1.9% EC:** Apply at 0.3-0.5 ml/L of water. It has translaminar action and is effective against both mites and leaf miners.
        *   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** Apply at 0.4-0.5 ml/L of water. It is effective against all life stages of mites.
        *   **Fenpyroximate 5% SC:** Apply at 0.5 ml/L of water. It acts by contact and stomach action.

    *   **Primarily for Red Spider Mite (also has some effect on Rust Mite):**
        *   **Propargite 57% EC:** Apply at 1.0-1.5 ml/L of water. It is a contact acaricide.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Rotation:** Never use the same acaricide repeatedly. Rotate chemicals with different modes of action to prevent mites from developing resistance.
*   **Timing:** Apply acaricides when mite populations are building up, not after severe damage has occurred. Early intervention is key.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure complete and uniform spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and on the fruit surface, where mites are often found.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always observe the recommended Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) for any chemical applied to ensure the safety of the produce.
*   **Water Volume:** Use adequate water volume to ensure proper coverage of the entire tree canopy.
