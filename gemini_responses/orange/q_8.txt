Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I understand the challenges posed by sucking pests in orange orchards. Effective management is crucial for maintaining tree health and fruit quality. Here's a scientifically verified approach for controlling Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, Thrips, and Psylla in Orange in Haryana:

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Principles:**
Before resorting to chemical control, consider IPM strategies to minimize pesticide use and promote sustainable pest management:
*   **Regular Monitoring:** Inspect trees frequently, especially new flushes, for early signs of pest infestation. Early detection allows for timely intervention.
*   **Pruning:** Remove water sprouts and diseased/infested branches to reduce pest harborage and improve air circulation.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can promote succulent growth highly attractive to sucking pests. Maintain balanced nutrition.
*   **Biological Control:** Encourage natural enemies like ladybird beetles, lacewings, hoverflies, and parasitic wasps. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.
*   **Weed Management:** Control weeds in and around the orchard, as they can host alternative pest populations.

**Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved Technical Chemicals):**
When pest populations reach economic threshold levels, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and new flushes. Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

Here are some CIBRC approved technical chemicals effective against a broad spectrum of sucking pests in Orange:

*   **For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Psylla:**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at 0.5 - 1 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at 0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water.
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply at 0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water.
    *   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:** Apply at 0.75 - 1 ml per litre of water. (Effective against nymphs and adults, with translaminar and systemic action).

*   **For Whiteflies (especially nymphs) and Mealybugs:**
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at 1.25 - 1.5 ml per litre of water. (Insect growth regulator, primarily targets nymphs).

*   **For Thrips, Whiteflies, and Leafhoppers:**
    *   **Fipronil 5% SC:** Apply at 1.5 - 2 ml per litre of water.

*   **For Aphids and Whiteflies:**
    *   **Flonicamid 50% WG:** Apply at 0.3 - 0.4 g per litre of water.

*   **For Thrips and Whiteflies (also has acaricidal action):**
    *   **Diafenthiuron 50% WP:** Apply at 0.6 - 1 g per litre of water.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Timing:** Apply insecticides during the initial stages of infestation or when new flushes emerge, as these are most vulnerable. For citrus psylla, timely application on new flushes is critical to prevent the transmission of Huanglongbing (HLB) disease.
*   **Water Volume:** Ensure adequate water volume (typically 200-400 litres per acre depending on tree size and canopy density) for thorough coverage of all plant parts.
*   **Safety:** Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the pesticide label, including safety precautions, pre-harvest intervals (PHI), and proper disposal of empty containers. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and application.
*   **Resistance Management:** To prevent pests from developing resistance, rotate chemicals with different modes of action. Do not use the same chemical or chemicals from the same chemical group repeatedly.
