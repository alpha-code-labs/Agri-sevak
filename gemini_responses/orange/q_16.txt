As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following fertilizer doses for Orange (Citrus sinensis) in Haryana. Please note that these are general recommendations for bearing trees (5 years and older) under average soil conditions. For precise recommendations, a soil test is highly recommended.

**General Fertilizer Recommendations for Bearing Orange Trees (5+ years old) per tree per year:**

*   **Nitrogen (N):** 600-800 g N per tree per year
    *   **Urea (46% N):** Apply 1.3 kg to 1.7 kg **Urea** per tree per year. This should be split into 2-3 applications (e.g., February-March, June-July, and September-October).
    *   **Nano-Urea (4% N):** As a supplementary foliar spray, apply 2-4 ml **Nano-Urea** per litre of water. Give 2-3 sprays per year (e.g., at flowering, fruit set, and fruit development stages). Consistent use of Nano-Urea can reduce the granular urea requirement by 25-50%.

*   **Phosphorus (P2O5):** 200-400 g P2O5 per tree per year
    *   **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP) (18% N, 46% P2O5):** Apply 435 g to 870 g **Diammonium Phosphate** per tree per year. This should be applied as a single basal dose (e.g., February-March). *Note: This will also supply 78-156 g of Nitrogen, so adjust the Urea application accordingly.*
    *   **Single Superphosphate (SSP) (16% P2O5, 11% S):** Alternatively, apply 1.25 kg to 2.5 kg **Single Superphosphate** per tree per year. This should be applied as a single basal dose (e.g., February-March). *This is a good option as it also supplies Sulphur.*
    *   **Nano-DAP (8% N, 16% P2O5):** As a supplementary foliar spray, apply 2-4 ml **Nano-DAP** per litre of water. Give 2-3 sprays per year (e.g., pre-flowering, fruit set).

*   **Potassium (K2O):** 600-800 g K2O per tree per year
    *   **Muriate of Potash (MOP) (60% K2O):** Apply 1 kg to 1.3 kg **Muriate of Potash** per tree per year. This should be split into 2 applications (e.g., February-March and June-July).

*   **Sulphur (S):** 100-200 g S per tree per year
    *   If **Single Superphosphate** is used, it will generally supply sufficient Sulphur.
    *   Otherwise, apply 110-220 g **Elemental Sulphur** (90% S) per tree per year, or 625-1250 g **Gypsum** (18.6% S) per tree per year. Apply as a basal dose (e.g., February-March).

*   **NPK Compound Fertilizers:**
    *   While various NPK ratios are available, it is generally recommended to apply individual nutrients based on soil test results for optimal citrus nutrition. If a general NPK compound fertilizer is used, ensure the total N, P, and K supplied aligns with the above recommendations.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Soil Testing:** Always conduct a soil test to determine the exact nutrient status of your orchard and tailor fertilizer recommendations accordingly.
*   **Tree Age:** Fertilizer doses should be adjusted based on the age and bearing status of the trees. Young, non-bearing trees require lower doses, which gradually increase as the tree matures and starts bearing fruit.
*   **Application Method:** Fertilizers are typically applied in a ring around the tree canopy, 30-60 cm away from the trunk, and incorporated into the soil. For fertigation, consult specific guidelines for drip irrigation systems.
*   **Watering:** Ensure adequate irrigation after fertilizer application to facilitate nutrient uptake.
