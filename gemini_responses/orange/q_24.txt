As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified practices for orange transplantation in Haryana:

### Ideal Transplantation Time

The most suitable time for transplanting orange saplings in Haryana is during periods that offer optimal conditions for root establishment and minimal transplant shock.
*   The primary and most recommended period is the **monsoon season**, typically from **July to September**. This period provides adequate soil moisture and moderate temperatures, which are highly conducive for the successful establishment of young plants.
*   Alternatively, planting can also be carried out in **February-March** (late winter/early spring), provided consistent irrigation facilities are available to support the saplings through the warmer months that follow. However, monsoon planting is generally preferred due to natural rainfall.

### Ideal Transplantation Distance

The recommended spacing for orange plants is crucial for optimal growth, light interception, air circulation, and ease of cultural operations. For standard cultivation practices in Haryana, a square system of planting is generally adopted.
*   A common and ideal spacing is **6 meters x 6 meters** (plant to plant and row to row).
*   For vigorous varieties, highly fertile soils, or specific high-density planting (HDP) systems, spacing can be adjusted, but for general recommendations, **7 meters x 7 meters** might also be considered.
*   This spacing allows for proper canopy development, efficient nutrient and water uptake, and facilitates inter-cultural operations and pest/disease management.

### Ideal Transplantation Process

The transplantation process involves several critical steps to ensure the healthy establishment and long-term productivity of orange plants.

1.  **Pit Preparation:**
    *   Dig pits of **1 meter x 1 meter x 1 meter** (length x width x depth) at the marked planting spots. This should be done at least 15-30 days before the actual planting to allow the soil to aerate and expose to sunlight, which helps in sterilizing the soil and killing any soil-borne pests or pathogens.
    *   Separate the topsoil from the subsoil during digging.

2.  **Pit Filling:**
    *   Fill each pit with a well-mixed combination of the original topsoil, **20-25 kg** of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost, **1 kg** of **Single Super Phosphate**, and **250 g** of **Muriate of Potash**. Alternatively, **500 g** of **Diammonium Phosphate** can be used instead of Single Super Phosphate.
    *   Mix these components thoroughly and fill the pits, creating a slight mound above ground level to account for future settling of the soil.

3.  **Sapling Selection:**
    *   Procure healthy, disease-free, and true-to-type budded saplings from a certified and reputable nursery. Ensure the saplings have a well-developed root system and a clear, healthy graft union.

4.  **Transplanting:**
    *   Carefully remove the sapling from its polybag or container, ensuring the root ball remains intact and undisturbed.
    *   Place the sapling in the center of the prepared pit. It is crucial to ensure that the graft union (the point where the scion is joined to the rootstock) remains **15-20 cm** above the ground level to prevent scion rooting and reduce the risk of collar rot diseases.
    *   Backfill the pit with the remaining soil mixture, gently firming the soil around the root ball to remove any air pockets.

5.  **Initial Watering:**
    *   Immediately after planting, provide a thorough and gentle watering to settle the soil around the roots and ensure good soil-root contact.

6.  **Staking and Protection:**
    *   Provide a sturdy stake to support the young sapling, especially in windy areas, to prevent it from bending or breaking.
    *   Protect young plants from direct scorching sun and strong winds during the initial establishment phase using temporary shade nets or windbreaks if necessary.

7.  **Basin Formation:**
    *   Create a small, circular basin around the plant for efficient water management and to ensure water reaches the root zone effectively.
