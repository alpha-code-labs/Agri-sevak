Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing these pests in Orange orchards in Haryana.

### Control of Fruit Fly in Orange

Fruit flies (primarily *Bactrocera dorsalis* and *Bactrocera zonata*) are a significant pest of Orange. Effective management requires an integrated approach:

1.  **Orchard Sanitation:**
    *   Regularly collect and destroy all fallen and infested fruits by burying them deep in the soil (at least 60 cm) or by boiling them. This breaks the life cycle of the pest.
    *   Avoid leaving ripe fruits on the tree for extended periods.

2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Deep ploughing during the off-season (winter) helps expose pupae in the soil to predators and adverse weather conditions, reducing the next generation's population.

3.  **Monitoring and Mass Trapping:**
    *   Install pheromone traps (methyl eugenol lure) at a density of 10-15 traps per acre. These traps attract and kill male fruit flies, helping to monitor population levels and reduce mating. Replace lures every 2-3 weeks.

4.  **Bait Sprays:**
    *   This is a highly effective and targeted method. Mix an insecticide with a protein source (like jaggery or protein hydrolysate) to attract and kill adult fruit flies. Apply these baits as spot sprays on the foliage, not as a full cover spray.
    *   **Option 1:** Mix **Malathion** 50% EC at 2 ml/L of water with 100 g of jaggery or protein hydrolysate per 10 litres of water.
    *   **Option 2:** Mix **Spinosad** 45% SC at 0.25 ml/L of water with 100 g of jaggery or protein hydrolysate per 10 litres of water.
    *   Apply these bait sprays on 10-15% of the trees, preferably on the lower canopy, once every 7-10 days during the fruiting period, especially when fruit ripening begins.

5.  **Foliar Sprays (for severe infestations):**
    *   If the infestation is very high and bait sprays are not providing sufficient control, a full cover spray may be necessary.
    *   **Option 1:** **Dimethoate** 30% EC at 1.0 ml/L of water.
    *   **Option 2:** **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Option 3:** **Cyantraniliprole** 10.26% OD at 1.8 ml/L of water.
    *   Ensure thorough coverage of the fruit and foliage. Always observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) for any chemical applied.

### Control of Ber Fly in Orange

This is not known to affect Orange. The Ber fly (*Carpomyia vesuviana*) is a highly host-specific pest primarily affecting Ber (*Ziziphus mauritiana*) fruits.
