As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling soil pests like termites and root-knot nematodes in Orange orchards in Haryana. Both these pests are known to significantly affect Orange trees, impacting their health, vigour, and productivity.

Effective management involves a combination of cultural practices and judicious use of CIBRC-approved chemical interventions.

### General Cultural Practices for Soil Health and Pest Management:

1.  **Maintain Orchard Hygiene:** Regularly remove weeds, fallen leaves, and dead plant material from around the tree base, as these can harbour pests.
2.  **Proper Irrigation:** Avoid waterlogging, which can stress trees and make them more susceptible to pests. Ensure good drainage.
3.  **Organic Matter Addition:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost into the soil. This improves soil structure, water retention, and promotes beneficial microbial activity, which can naturally suppress some pests.
4.  **Resistant Rootstocks:** For new plantings, consider using rootstocks known for resistance or tolerance to nematodes prevalent in your area. (e.g., Trifoliate orange, Swingle citrumelo, Carrizo citrange have varying degrees of resistance to different nematode species).

### 1. Control of Termites (Dimag) in Orange:

Termites primarily damage the roots and the collar region of the tree, especially young plants, leading to wilting, yellowing, and eventual death. They can also create mud channels on the trunk.

**Preventive and Cultural Measures:**
*   Avoid planting trees too deep.
*   Ensure proper drainage to prevent water stagnation around the tree base.
*   Remove any dead wood or stumps from the orchard area.
*   Avoid direct contact of wooden stakes or supports with the soil near the tree trunk.

**Chemical Control (Post-planting):**
For established trees, soil drenching around the tree base is the most effective method.

*   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC:**
    *   **Dosage:** 2.5 - 5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Application:** Drench the soil around the tree trunk, covering an area of about 30-50 cm radius, with 5-10 litres of the solution per tree, depending on the tree size. Ensure the solution penetrates the soil to a depth of 15-30 cm.
*   **Fipronil 5% SC:**
    *   **Dosage:** 1.5 - 2 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Application:** Similar to Chlorpyrifos, drench the soil around the tree base with 5-10 litres of solution per tree.

### 2. Control of Nematodes (Root-knot Nematodes - *Meloidogyne* spp.) in Orange:

Root-knot nematodes are microscopic worms that infect tree roots, causing characteristic galls or swellings. This damage impairs the roots' ability to absorb water and nutrients, leading to stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, reduced fruit size and yield, and increased susceptibility to other diseases.

**Preventive and Cultural Measures:**
*   **Solarization:** In fallow land before planting, soil solarization during hot summer months can significantly reduce nematode populations.
*   **Organic Amendments:** Regular application of neem cake (200-500 g per tree, depending on age) or other oil cakes can help suppress nematode populations by releasing nematicidal compounds and promoting beneficial microbes.
*   **Resistant Rootstocks:** As mentioned above, selecting resistant rootstocks is the most sustainable long-term solution for new plantings.

**Chemical Control (Post-planting):**
Chemical nematicides are applied to the soil around the root zone.

*   **Fluensulfone 2% GR (Granular):**
    *   **Dosage:** 50 - 100 kg per acre, or 50 - 100 g per tree for established trees.
    *   **Application:** Apply the granules uniformly in the root zone around the tree, mix lightly with the topsoil, and then irrigate immediately to ensure the chemical dissolves and reaches the roots.
*   **Ethoprophos 10% G (Granular):**
    *   **Dosage:** 10 - 20 kg per acre, or 100 - 200 g per tree for established trees.
    *   **Application:** Similar to Fluensulfone, apply granules in the root zone, mix with soil, and irrigate thoroughly.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label carefully, including safety precautions, dosage rates, and application methods.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Apply chemicals during calm weather to avoid drift.
*   Consider the pre-harvest interval (PHI) for any chemical applied, especially if fruits are nearing maturity.
*   For severe infestations, a combination of cultural and chemical methods, possibly repeated applications as per label recommendations, might be necessary.
*   It is advisable to get a soil test done to confirm the presence and population density of nematodes before applying nematicides.

By implementing these integrated pest management strategies, you can effectively control soil pests in your Orange orchard and ensure healthy, productive trees.
