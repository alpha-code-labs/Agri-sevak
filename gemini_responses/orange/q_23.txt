As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for orange cultivation in Haryana:

### Seed Treatment for Orange

Commercial orange cultivation primarily relies on vegetative propagation methods, such as budding, rather than direct seeding of the fruit-bearing variety. Therefore, there is no standard "seed treatment" process for commercial orange fruit production. Oranges are typically propagated by budding a scion (from the desired orange variety) onto a rootstock (e.g., Rough Lemon, Rangpur Lime, Trifoliate Orange hybrids) that is grown from seed.

If the question implicitly referred to rootstock seeds, which are used to grow seedlings onto which the desired orange variety is budded, then seed treatments for rootstock seeds might involve fungicides to protect against damping-off diseases. However, for the "Orange" fruit variety itself, seed treatment is not applicable.

### Soil Treatment for Orange

Effective soil treatment is crucial for establishing a healthy orange orchard and maintaining its productivity. This involves both pre-plant preparation and ongoing management.

#### A. Pre-Plant Soil Treatment (Before planting saplings):

1.  **Soil Testing:**
    *   It is essential to conduct a comprehensive soil test to determine soil pH, nutrient status, and the presence of soil-borne pests or pathogens (e.g., nematodes).
2.  **Soil Amendments:**
    *   **Organic Matter:** Incorporate well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost at 10-15 kg per planting pit (or 20-30 tonnes per acre) to improve soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability.
    *   **pH Correction:**
        *   For acidic soils (pH < 6.0): Apply agricultural lime (calcium carbonate) as per soil test recommendations.
        *   For alkaline soils (pH > 8.0): Apply gypsum (calcium sulfate) or elemental sulfur as per soil test recommendations.
3.  **Nematode Management (if soil test indicates high population):**
    *   **Fumigation:** In severe cases, soil fumigation can be done 3-4 weeks before planting.
        *   **Dazomet**: Apply 200-300 kg/acre, incorporate thoroughly into the soil, and cover with plastic for 7-10 days, then aerate the soil for at least 10-14 days before planting.
    *   **Non-Fumigant Nematicides:**
        *   **Fluensulfone**: Apply 10-15 kg/acre as a pre-plant broadcast and incorporation into the soil.
4.  **Soil-borne Disease Management (e.g., *Phytophthora* root rot, if there is a history of disease in the area):**
    *   Ensure proper drainage to prevent waterlogging.
    *   Soil Solarization: Cover moist soil with clear plastic for 4-6 weeks during hot periods to reduce pathogen populations.

#### B. Post-Plant / Ongoing Soil Treatment (For established orchards):

1.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Based on regular soil and leaf analysis, apply macro and micronutrients as required. This is a continuous process, not a one-time "treatment."
2.  **Weed Management:**
    *   **Herbicides:**
        *   **Glyphosate**: Apply 1.0-1.5 kg a.i./acre (e.g., 2-3 L of 41% SL formulation) as a shielded spray to avoid contact with the tree trunk and foliage.
        *   **Paraquat dichloride**: Apply 0.5-1.0 kg a.i./acre (e.g., 1.5-3 L of 24% SL formulation) as a shielded spray for contact weed control.
        *   **Oxyfluorfen**: Apply 0.2-0.4 kg a.i./acre (e.g., 1-2 L of 23.5% EC formulation) as a pre-emergent herbicide to prevent weed germination.
3.  **Nematode Management (if re-infestation occurs or populations rise):**
    *   **Oxamyl**: Apply 2-4 L/acre as a soil drench around the root zone of affected trees.
    *   **Fluensulfone**: Apply 10-15 kg/acre as a broadcast application followed by light irrigation.
4.  **Soil-borne Disease Management (e.g., *Phytophthora* root rot):**
    *   **Fosetyl-aluminium**: Apply 2.5-5.0 g/L water as a soil drench around the base of affected trees.
    *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride**: Apply 2-3 ml/L water as a soil drench.
    *   **Metalaxyl-M**: Apply 1-2 g/L water as a soil drench.
    *   **Potassium phosphonate**: Apply 2-3 ml/L water as a soil drench or as a trunk paint application.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always conduct soil tests before applying any major soil amendments or pesticides.
*   Follow label instructions carefully for all chemical applications, including dosage, timing, and safety precautions.
*   Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approaches, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods, are recommended for sustainable orange cultivation.
*   Consult with local HAU extension specialists for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and the latest CIBRC guidelines.
