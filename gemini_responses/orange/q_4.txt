Wilt, including symptoms often referred to as 'Parawilt' (which can encompass various causes of sudden wilting), is a serious concern for Orange (Citrus sinensis) cultivation in Haryana. It can be caused by various factors, including fungal pathogens (like *Fusarium* species, *Verticillium* species, or *Phytophthora* species causing root rot), bacterial infections, or severe physiological stress (e.g., waterlogging, drought, nutrient imbalances, root damage). A precise diagnosis is crucial for effective management.

Here's a scientifically verified approach to control wilt in Orange:

**I. Integrated Management Strategy**

An integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods is most effective for managing wilt.

**A. Cultural Practices (Foundation for Prevention and Management)**

1.  **Resistant Rootstocks:** Where available and suitable for Haryana's conditions, planting on resistant rootstocks is the most sustainable long-term solution. Rootstocks like Rangpur lime, Trifoliate orange, Troyer citrange, and Carrizo citrange show varying degrees of resistance to different soil-borne diseases. Consult with HAU experts for the most suitable rootstock for your specific soil and disease pressure.
2.  **Soil Health and Drainage:**
    *   Ensure excellent soil drainage. Orange trees are highly susceptible to root rot and wilting in waterlogged conditions. Avoid planting in low-lying areas prone to water accumulation.
    *   Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost (10-15 kg per tree annually) to improve soil structure, aeration, and microbial activity.
3.  **Irrigation Management:**
    *   Irrigate judiciously. Avoid both over-irrigation (which leads to waterlogging and root rot) and under-irrigation (which causes drought stress and wilting).
    *   Use drip irrigation to deliver water directly to the root zone, minimizing water wastage and reducing humidity around the trunk.
    *   Monitor soil moisture regularly and irrigate based on plant needs and weather conditions.
4.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Maintain balanced nutrition. Deficiencies or excesses of certain nutrients can predispose trees to stress and disease. Conduct soil and leaf analysis to determine specific nutrient requirements.
    *   Ensure adequate levels of micronutrients, especially zinc, iron, and manganese.
5.  **Sanitation:**
    *   Remove and destroy severely infected or dead trees and plant parts to reduce inoculum sources.
    *   Disinfect pruning tools with a 1% sodium hypochlorite solution or 70% alcohol between trees to prevent disease spread.
6.  **Weed Control:** Keep the area around the tree base free of weeds, which can compete for nutrients and harbor pests/diseases.
7.  **Avoid Root Injury:** Be careful during inter-cultivation practices to prevent damage to the root system, which can create entry points for pathogens.
8.  **Soil Solarization:** In severely affected areas or for new plantings, soil solarization during hot summer months (May-June) for 4-6 weeks can significantly reduce soil-borne pathogen populations.

**B. Biological Control**

1.  **Trichoderma spp. Application:**
    *   Apply **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum** (liquid or powder formulation) to the soil around the root zone. These beneficial fungi act as antagonists against various soil-borne pathogens.
    *   **Dosage:** 2.5-5 kg of powder formulation or 5-10 litres of liquid formulation per acre, mixed with 100-200 kg of well-decomposed FYM/compost and applied as a soil drench or incorporated into the soil. For individual trees, drench with a solution of 5-10 ml/g per litre of water (5-10 litres per tree, depending on tree size). Repeat every 3-4 months, especially during periods of stress.

**C. Chemical Control (For Confirmed Fungal Wilts)**

Chemical control should be used as a targeted measure, especially when fungal pathogens are confirmed. Always follow label instructions and safety precautions.

1.  **For Fusarium/Verticillium Wilt:**
    *   **Carbendazim 50% WP:** Drench the soil around the affected tree with a solution of **Carbendazim** at 1-2 grams per litre of water. Apply 5-10 litres of this solution per tree, depending on its size and age. Repeat after 15-20 days if symptoms persist.
    *   **Thiophanate-methyl 70% WP:** Alternatively, drench the soil with **Thiophanate-methyl** at 1-1.5 grams per litre of water. Apply 5-10 litres of solution per tree.

2.  **For Phytophthora Root Rot (leading to wilting):**
    *   **Copper Oxychloride 50% WP:** Drench the soil around the tree with **Copper Oxychloride** at 2-3 grams per litre of water. Apply 5-10 litres of solution per tree. This can also be applied as a paste to the trunk base if gummosis is present.
    *   **Propiconazole 25% EC:** Drench the soil with **Propiconazole** at 1-2 ml per litre of water. Apply 5-10 litres of solution per tree.

**II. Important Considerations**

*   **Early Diagnosis:** Accurate identification of the cause of wilt is paramount. If possible, consult with HAU plant pathology experts for laboratory diagnosis of soil and plant samples.
*   **Preventive Measures:** Focus on preventive cultural practices, as treating established wilt can be challenging.
*   **Rotation:** While not directly applicable to perennial orchards, maintaining good soil health and avoiding stress are key.
*   **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your orchard for early signs of wilting to initiate control measures promptly.

By implementing these scientifically verified strategies, you can effectively manage and control wilt in your Orange orchard in Haryana.
