As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified cultivation practices for Orange (Sweet Orange, *Citrus sinensis*) in Haryana:

Commercial orange orchards are primarily established using vegetatively propagated, budded plants, not seeds of the scion variety. Seeds are typically used for raising rootstock seedlings in a nursery.

Here are the recommended practices:

*   **Sowing method/pattern (Planting Method/Pattern):**
    *   **Propagation:** Commercial orange cultivation relies on budding (e.g., T-budding or shield budding) of desired scion varieties onto suitable rootstocks. Common rootstocks for Haryana conditions include Rough Lemon (Jatti Khatti), Rangpur Lime, or Karna Khatta, known for their adaptability to varying soil conditions and disease resistance.
    *   **Planting Material:** Use healthy, disease-free, 1-2 year old budded plants obtained from certified nurseries.
    *   **Planting Pattern:** The most common and recommended planting pattern is the **Square System**, which facilitates inter-cultivation operations, irrigation, and spraying. A **Rectangular System** can also be adopted, especially for high-density planting.
    *   **Pit Preparation:** Dig pits of 1m x 1m x 1m size at least one month before planting. Fill these pits with a mixture of topsoil, 20-25 kg of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost, 1 kg of Single Super Phosphate, and 100 g of Chlorpyrifos (as a termite prophylactic, if needed, ensuring CIBRC approval for this use). Allow the pits to settle before planting.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   The budded plant should be planted in the center of the prepared pit.
    *   Ensure that the **bud union (graft union) remains well above the soil surface**, typically 15-20 cm. This prevents scion rooting and potential rootstock-related issues.
    *   The soil around the plant should be gently firmed, and a small basin should be formed for irrigation.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   The optimal spacing depends on the scion variety, rootstock vigor, soil fertility, and management practices (e.g., pruning, irrigation).
    *   **Standard Density Planting:**
        *   For vigorous varieties on standard rootstocks: **6 meters x 6 meters** (row to row x plant to plant). This accommodates approximately 112 plants per acre.
        *   Alternatively, **7 meters x 7 meters** can be used for very vigorous combinations, accommodating about 82 plants per acre.
    *   **High-Density Planting (HDP):**
        *   For semi-vigorous varieties or with proper canopy management: **5 meters x 5 meters** (approx. 162 plants per acre).
        *   A rectangular system like **6 meters x 3 meters** can also be adopted for HDP, accommodating about 225 plants per acre, which requires intensive pruning and training.

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   **This is not applicable for establishing a commercial orange orchard.** Commercial orange cultivation uses budded plants, not seeds of the orange variety itself. Seeds are only used in nurseries to raise rootstock seedlings, which are then budded with the desired orange scion. Therefore, there is no "seed dose" for planting an orange orchard.
