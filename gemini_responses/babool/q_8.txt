To effectively control sucking pests such as Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, Thrips, and Psyllids on Babool (*Acacia nilotica*) in Haryana, an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is recommended. These pests can cause significant damage by sucking sap, leading to stunted growth, leaf curling, yellowing, and in severe cases, defoliation and reduced vigor of the tree. They can also transmit viral diseases and excrete honeydew, promoting sooty mould growth.

**1. Non-Chemical Control Measures:**

*   **Regular Monitoring:** Inspect Babool trees regularly, especially new flushes and the undersides of leaves, for early signs of pest infestation.
*   **Pruning:** Remove heavily infested branches or twigs to reduce pest populations. Dispose of pruned material properly to prevent further spread.
*   **Water Spray:** For small trees or localized infestations, a strong jet of water can physically dislodge pests from the foliage.
*   **Promote Natural Enemies:** Encourage the presence of beneficial insects like ladybird beetles, lacewings, and parasitic wasps, which are natural predators and parasitoids of these sucking pests. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficials.
*   **Maintain Tree Health:** Healthy trees are more resilient to pest attacks. Ensure proper nutrition and adequate watering, especially during dry periods.

**2. Chemical Control Measures (When infestation is severe and non-chemical methods are insufficient):**

Always ensure thorough coverage of the foliage, especially the undersides of leaves where many sucking pests reside. Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pest resistance.

*   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at a concentration of **0.5 - 1.0 ml per litre of water**.
*   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at a concentration of **0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water**.
*   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply at a concentration of **0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water**.
*   **Dimethoate 30% EC:** Apply at a concentration of **1.5 - 2.0 ml per litre of water**.
*   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Particularly effective against whiteflies and psyllids, acting as an insect growth regulator. Apply at a concentration of **1.25 - 1.5 ml per litre of water**.
*   **Pymetrozine 50% WG:** Specific for sucking pests like aphids, whiteflies, and leafhoppers, with a unique mode of action. Apply at a concentration of **0.3 - 0.4 g per litre of water**.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Timing:** Apply insecticides during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift, reduce evaporation, and maximize efficacy.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, and protective clothing while handling and applying chemicals.
*   **Adherence to Labels:** Strictly follow the instructions, dosage rates, and safety precautions mentioned on the insecticide product label.
*   **Environmental Impact:** Be mindful of the surrounding environment, non-target organisms, and local regulations regarding pesticide use.
