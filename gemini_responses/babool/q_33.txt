As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling weeds in Babool (Acacia nilotica) plantations in Haryana.

Effective weed management in Babool involves a combination of cultural, mechanical, and chemical methods. The choice of method depends on the age of the plantation, weed intensity, and specific weed species. For young Babool plants, manual weeding and mulching are highly recommended to minimize herbicide exposure. For established trees, directed herbicide sprays can be employed with caution.

Here's how to control the specified weeds:

### 1. Broadleaf Weeds (General, including Bathu and Congress Grass)

*   **Cultural and Mechanical Methods:**
    *   Regular manual weeding, especially around young Babool plants, is highly effective.
    *   Mulching with organic materials (e.g., crop residues, wood chips) around the base of trees can suppress weed growth and conserve soil moisture.
    *   Inter-row cultivation can be done in wider spaced plantations, taking care not to damage tree roots.

*   **Chemical Control (Herbicides):**
    *   **Pre-emergence:**
        *   Apply **Pendimethalin** 30% EC at 3.3 litres per acre in 200-300 litres of water, immediately after planting or before weed emergence. This provides broad-spectrum control of germinating broadleaf and narrowleaf weeds.
    *   **Post-emergence (Selective):**
        *   For established broadleaf weeds like Bathu (Chenopodium album) and Congress grass (Parthenium hysterophorus), apply **2,4-D ethyl ester** 38% EC at 1.3 - 2.6 litres per acre in 200-300 litres of water. Ensure directed spray to avoid contact with Babool foliage, especially young plants.
    *   **Post-emergence (Non-selective, Directed Spray):**
        *   For general broadleaf and narrowleaf weed control in established plantations, **Glyphosate** 41% SL can be used at 2.5 - 3.5 litres per acre in 200-300 litres of water. Apply as a directed spray, strictly avoiding contact with the green parts (leaves, young bark) of Babool trees.

### 2. Narrowleaf Weeds (General, including Phalaris minor)

*   **Cultural and Mechanical Methods:**
    *   Similar to broadleaf weeds, manual weeding and mulching are effective.

*   **Chemical Control (Herbicides):**
    *   **Pre-emergence:**
        *   Apply **Pendimethalin** 30% EC at 3.3 litres per acre in 200-300 litres of water, as mentioned above, for control of germinating narrowleaf weeds like Phalaris minor.
    *   **Post-emergence (Selective):**
        *   For established narrowleaf weeds (grasses) like Phalaris minor, apply **Quizalofop-ethyl** 5% EC at 1.0 - 2.0 litres per acre or **Fenoxaprop-p-ethyl** 9% EC at 0.5 - 0.67 litres per acre in 200-300 litres of water. These herbicides are selective for grasses and generally safe for broadleaf trees like Babool, but always ensure proper application to minimize drift.
    *   **Post-emergence (Non-selective, Directed Spray):**
        *   **Glyphosate** 41% SL at 2.5 - 3.5 litres per acre or **Paraquat dichloride** 24% SL at 2.0 - 4.0 litres per acre in 200-300 litres of water can be used as a directed spray for general narrowleaf weed control, strictly avoiding contact with Babool foliage and young bark.

### 3. Amarbail (Cuscuta spp.)

*   **Cultural and Mechanical Methods:**
    *   **Manual Removal:** This is the most effective method. Infested Babool branches should be pruned and the Cuscuta removed and destroyed (preferably by burning) before it sets seed.
    *   **Early Detection:** Regularly inspect Babool plants for early signs of Amarbail infestation and remove promptly.
    *   **Sanitation:** Prevent the spread of Cuscuta seeds through contaminated soil, tools, or planting material.

*   **Chemical Control (Herbicides):**
    *   **Pre-emergence:**
        *   **Pendimethalin** 30% EC at 3.3 litres per acre in 200-300 litres of water can provide some suppression of Cuscuta seed germination if applied to the soil surface before its emergence.
    *   **Post-emergence:**
        *   Post-emergence chemical control of Amarbail on a living host like Babool is extremely challenging without harming the host. If Amarbail patches are dense and can be isolated, a highly directed spot application of **Paraquat dichloride** 24% SL at 2.0 - 4.0 litres per acre in 200-300 litres of water might be considered, but with extreme caution to prevent any contact with Babool. This is generally not recommended due to the high risk of damage to the host tree.

### 4. Orobanche

*   This is not known to affect Babool.

### Important Considerations:

*   **Always read and follow the label instructions** of any herbicide product before use.
*   **Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE)** during herbicide application.
*   **Calibrate spray equipment** to ensure correct dosage and uniform coverage.
*   **Avoid spraying on windy days** to prevent drift to non-target plants.
*   **Consider the age of Babool trees:** Young trees are more susceptible to herbicide damage. Use directed sprays and protective shields for young plants.
*   **Integrated Weed Management (IWM)** approach, combining cultural, mechanical, and chemical methods, is always the most sustainable and effective strategy.
