As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling Red spider mites (Tetranychus spp.) and Rust mites (Eriophyidae) on Babool (Acacia nilotica) in Haryana.

Mites are common pests that can infest Babool, especially during dry and warm periods. They feed on plant sap, leading to stippling, bronzing, leaf distortion, and in severe cases, defoliation. Early detection and timely intervention are crucial for effective management.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Approach:**

1.  **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect Babool trees, particularly the undersides of leaves, for signs of mites (fine webbing, tiny reddish or yellowish dots, stippling, bronzing, or reddish dust-like appearance).
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Ensure adequate water availability to the trees, as water stress can make trees more susceptible to mite infestations.
    *   Maintain tree health through proper nutrition.
    *   Prune heavily infested branches if practical and the infestation is localized, especially for smaller trees.

**Chemical Control (Acaricides):**

When mite populations reach damaging levels, chemical control may be necessary. It is crucial to rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Always ensure thorough coverage of the foliage, especially the undersides of leaves, as mites primarily reside there.

Here are some CIBRC approved technical chemical names for mite control, along with their general recommended dosages for foliar application:

*   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** Apply at 0.5 - 1 ml per liter of water. This acaricide is effective against all life stages of spider mites.
*   **Fenpyroximate 5% SC:** Apply at 0.5 - 1 ml per liter of water. It provides quick knockdown and residual control against spider mites and some rust mites.
*   **Propargite 57% EC:** Apply at 1.5 - 2 ml per liter of water. A broad-spectrum acaricide effective against various mite species.
*   **Abamectin 1.9% EC:** Apply at 0.3 - 0.5 ml per liter of water. Effective against spider mites and some eriophyid mites, with translaminar action.
*   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP:** Apply at 2 - 3 g per liter of water. This is a contact acaricide and fungicide, particularly effective against rust mites and as a preventive measure. Avoid application during very hot weather (above 30-32°C) to prevent phytotoxicity.
*   **Hexythiazox 5.45% EC:** Apply at 0.5 - 1 ml per liter of water. This is an ovicide and larvicide, effective against eggs and nymphs of spider mites, making it suitable for rotation.
*   **Etoxazole 10% SC:** Apply at 0.5 ml per liter of water. Another ovicide and larvicide, effective against eggs and nymphs of spider mites.
*   **Pyridaben 10% WP:** Apply at 1 g per liter of water. A contact acaricide with quick knockdown action.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Rotation:** Always rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development in mite populations.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure complete and thorough coverage of the entire plant, especially the undersides of leaves, where mites are most prevalent. For tall Babool trees, specialized spray equipment (e.g., high-volume sprayers or mist blowers) may be required.
*   **Safety:** Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the product label, including safety precautions, dosage, and application guidelines. Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).
*   **Environmental Conditions:** Avoid spraying during strong winds or when rain is expected shortly after application. For sulphur, avoid application during very high temperatures.

For specific recommendations tailored to the severity of the infestation and local conditions, it is always advisable to consult with the agricultural extension services of HAU, Hisar.
