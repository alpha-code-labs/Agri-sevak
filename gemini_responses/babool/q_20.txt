As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I advise that addressing micronutrient deficiencies in Babool (Acacia nilotica) requires a precise diagnosis through soil testing and leaf tissue analysis. Babool is a hardy tree, but deficiencies can occur, especially in specific soil types prevalent in Haryana.

Here's how to address the potential deficiencies:

**General Recommendations:**
*   **Diagnosis is Key:** Before applying any micronutrient, it is crucial to conduct soil testing and, if possible, leaf tissue analysis to confirm the specific deficiency and its severity. Visual symptoms can be misleading.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management:** Incorporate organic matter (farmyard manure, compost) into the soil to improve nutrient availability and soil health.

**Specific Micronutrient Deficiencies:**

1.  **Zinc (Zn) Deficiency:**
    *   **Is it known to affect Babool?** Yes, Zinc deficiency is common in many crops and trees, including Babool, particularly in alkaline and calcareous soils prevalent in Haryana. Symptoms include stunted growth, small leaves, and interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves.
    *   **Recommendations:**
        *   **Foliar Application:**
            *   Apply 0.5-1.0% solution of **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** (5-10 g/L of water) or 0.1-0.2% solution of **Zinc EDTA** (1-2 g/L of water). Repeat 2-3 times at 15-day intervals if symptoms persist.
        *   **Soil Application (for severe deficiency, based on soil test):**
            *   Apply **Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate** at 10-25 kg/acre, mixed with soil around the tree base, or **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** at 15-35 kg/acre.

2.  **Iron (Fe) Deficiency:**
    *   **Is it known to affect Babool?** Yes, Iron deficiency (iron chlorosis) is very common in Babool, especially in the alkaline and calcareous soils found in Haryana. Symptoms include prominent interveveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on young leaves, with veins remaining green.
    *   **Recommendations:**
        *   **Foliar Application:**
            *   Apply 0.5-1.0% solution of **Ferrous Sulphate** (5-10 g/L of water) or 0.1-0.2% solution of **Ferrous EDTA** (1-2 g/L of water). Repeat 2-3 times at 15-day intervals.
        *   **Soil Application (less effective for trees due to rapid fixation in alkaline soils):**
            *   For severe cases, **Ferrous EDTA** can be applied at 5-10 kg/acre, mixed into the soil around the root zone. **Ferrous Sulphate** can be applied at 25-50 kg/acre, but its effectiveness in alkaline soils is limited.

3.  **Boron (B) Deficiency:**
    *   **Is it known to affect Babool?** Yes, Boron deficiency can occur in Babool, particularly in sandy soils or soils with low organic matter. Symptoms include dieback of growing points, distorted new growth, and sometimes cracking of stems or petioles.
    *   **Recommendations:**
        *   **Foliar Application:**
            *   Apply 0.1-0.2% solution of **Borax (Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate)** (1-2 g/L of water) or 0.05-0.1% solution of **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (0.5-1 g/L of water).
        *   **Soil Application (based on soil test):**
            *   Apply **Borax (Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate)** at 2-5 kg/acre, mixed into the soil around the tree.

4.  **Calcium (Ca) Deficiency:**
    *   **Is it known to affect Babool?** This is not known to affect Babool as a primary deficiency in Haryana's soil conditions, which are typically calcareous (rich in calcium carbonate). True calcium deficiency symptoms (e.g., dieback of growing points, distorted new leaves) are rare in such environments. If symptoms resembling Ca deficiency appear, they are more likely due to water stress or other nutrient imbalances affecting calcium uptake rather than a lack of calcium in the soil.

5.  **Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency:**
    *   **Is it known to affect Babool?** Yes, Magnesium deficiency can occur in Babool, especially in sandy soils, acidic soils (less common in Haryana), or where there is an imbalance with high potassium or calcium levels. Symptoms typically appear as interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, sometimes progressing to reddish-brown discoloration.
    *   **Recommendations:**
        *   **Foliar Application:**
            *   Apply 0.5-1.0% solution of **Magnesium Sulphate** (5-10 g/L of water). Repeat 2-3 times at 15-day intervals.
        *   **Soil Application (based on soil test):**
            *   Apply **Magnesium Sulphate** at 10-20 kg/acre, mixed into the soil around the tree.

6.  **Manganese (Mn) Deficiency:**
    *   **Is it known to affect Babool?** Yes, Manganese deficiency can affect Babool, particularly in alkaline soils, soils with high organic matter, or poorly drained conditions. Symptoms are similar to iron deficiency, showing interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, but often with a finer network of green veins.
    *   **Recommendations:**
        *   **Foliar Application:**
            *   Apply 0.5-1.0% solution of **Manganese Sulphate** (5-10 g/L of water) or 0.1-0.2% solution of **Manganese EDTA** (1-2 g/L of water). Repeat 2-3 times at 15-day intervals.
        *   **Soil Application (based on soil test):**
            *   Apply **Manganese Sulphate** at 5-10 kg/acre, mixed into the soil around the tree.
