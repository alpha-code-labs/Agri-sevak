As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding rust diseases in Babool (*Acacia nilotica*) for Haryana.

Regarding the specific rust diseases you mentioned:

*   **Black Rust (Stem Rust), Brown Rust (Leaf Rust), and Yellow Rust (Stripe Rust):** These are primarily diseases of cereal crops like wheat, barley, and rye, caused by different species of *Puccinia*. **These are not known to affect Babool.**
*   **White Rust:** This disease is caused by *Albugo candida*, an oomycete, and primarily affects cruciferous plants (e.g., mustard, radish). **This is not known to affect Babool.**

**Red Rust in Babool:**
True rust diseases affecting Babool are typically caused by fungi belonging to the genus *Ravenelia* (e.g., *Ravenelia acaciae-arabicae*). These rusts manifest as reddish-brown pustules on leaves, petioles, and sometimes young twigs, leading to premature defoliation and reduced tree vigour.

Here's how to control *Ravenelia* rusts in Babool:

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Sanitation:** Collect and destroy fallen infected leaves and twigs to reduce the inoculum source.
*   **Pruning:** Remove severely infected branches or twigs during dry periods to prevent further spread.
*   **Tree Health:** Ensure trees are healthy and well-nourished, as stressed trees can be more susceptible to diseases.

**2. Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
For effective control, especially during periods conducive to disease development (e.g., high humidity, moderate temperatures), foliar application of CIBRC-approved fungicides can be beneficial. Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage. Repeat applications may be necessary based on disease severity and weather conditions.

Recommended fungicides and their dosages:

*   **Propiconazole 25% EC:** Apply at a rate of 0.5 - 1 ml per litre of water.
*   **Hexaconazole 5% SC:** Apply at a rate of 1 - 2 ml per litre of water.
*   **Tebuconazole 25.9% EC:** Apply at a rate of 0.75 - 1 ml per litre of water.
*   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:** Apply at a rate of 0.5 - 1 ml per litre of water.
*   **Mancozeb 75% WP:** Apply at a rate of 2 - 2.5 g per litre of water. This is a contact fungicide and can be used preventatively or in rotation with systemic fungicides.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the fungicide label for safe and effective use.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and application.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension specialists for specific recommendations tailored to your exact location and disease pressure.
