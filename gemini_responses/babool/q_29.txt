As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm the following regarding "Dropping" (Flower drop, Fruit drop, and Tinda/Boll dropping) in Babool (Acacia nilotica):

This is not known to affect Babool as a significant problem requiring specific chemical interventions.

Babool is a hardy, drought-tolerant tree species native to Haryana and other parts of India. While some natural shedding of flowers and immature fruits is a normal physiological process for most plants to conserve resources and ensure optimal development of remaining fruits, widespread problematic "dropping" that necessitates specific control measures is not a commonly reported issue for Babool.

If you observe excessive shedding, it is more likely due to general environmental stresses rather than a specific disease or pest causing abscission. These stresses could include:
*   **Severe water stress:** Prolonged drought or, conversely, waterlogging.
*   **Extreme temperatures:** Unusually high or low temperatures during flowering/fruiting.
*   **Nutrient deficiencies:** While Babool is adapted to poor soils, severe deficiencies could impact overall plant health.

For general tree health and resilience, ensure appropriate site selection and minimal stress conditions, but specific chemical controls for "dropping" are not recommended or typically necessary for Babool.
