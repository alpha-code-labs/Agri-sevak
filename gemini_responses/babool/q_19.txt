As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm that Babool (Acacia nilotica) can indeed suffer from macro-nutrient deficiencies, particularly in poor or depleted soils, despite its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen. Addressing these deficiencies is crucial for healthy growth and productivity.

Here's how to address Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium deficiencies in Babool:

**General Recommendations (Always prioritize Soil Testing for precise recommendations):**

1.  **Soil Testing:** The most accurate way to determine specific nutrient deficiencies and required quantities is through a soil test. HAU recommends regular soil testing for optimal nutrient management.
2.  **Application Method:** For soil application, spread the fertilizer evenly around the drip line of the tree (the area directly beneath the outermost branches), lightly incorporate it into the soil, and water thoroughly. Avoid applying too close to the trunk.
3.  **Organic Matter:** Regular incorporation of well-rotted Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost (5-10 kg per young tree, 20-50 kg per mature tree annually) significantly improves soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability, reducing the need for synthetic fertilizers.

**1. Addressing Nitrogen (N) Deficiency:**

While Babool is a legume and fixes atmospheric nitrogen, deficiency can occur in very poor soils, young plants, or if nodulation is poor.

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   For young trees (1-3 years): Apply **Urea** at 50-100 g per tree, or **Ammonium Sulfate** at 100-200 g per tree.
    *   For mature trees: Apply **Urea** at 200-500 g per tree, or **Ammonium Sulfate** at 400-1000 g per tree.
    *   *Application frequency:* Split the annual dose into 2-3 applications, typically during active growth periods (e.g., post-monsoon and early spring).
*   **Foliar Spray (for quick, temporary relief):**
    *   Spray a 1-2% solution of **Urea** (10-20 g of **Urea** per litre of water). Apply during cooler parts of the day to avoid leaf scorch. Repeat every 10-15 days if needed.

**2. Addressing Phosphorus (P) Deficiency:**

Phosphorus is crucial for root development, flowering, and fruiting. It is less mobile in the soil, so soil application is generally more effective.

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   For young trees (1-3 years): Apply **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** at 100-200 g per tree, or **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** at 50-100 g per tree.
    *   For mature trees: Apply **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** at 500-1000 g per tree, or **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** at 200-400 g per tree.
    *   *Application frequency:* Phosphorus is often applied once a year, preferably before the main growth flush or during planting.

**3. Addressing Potassium (K) Deficiency:**

Potassium enhances disease resistance, water use efficiency, and overall plant vigour.

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   For young trees (1-3 years): Apply **Muriate of Potash (Potassium Chloride)** at 50-100 g per tree.
    *   For mature trees: Apply **Muriate of Potash (Potassium Chloride)** at 200-500 g per tree.
    *   *Application frequency:* Potassium can be applied once or twice a year, similar to nitrogen, during active growth periods.

**Important Note:** Always observe the tree's response to fertilization. Over-fertilization can be detrimental. Start with lower doses and increase if necessary based on visual symptoms and soil test results.
