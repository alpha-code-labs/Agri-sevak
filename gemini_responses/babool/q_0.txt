As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Babool (*Acacia nilotica*) in Haryana:

**General Cultural Practices for Fungal Disease Management in Babool:**

Before resorting to chemical control, implementing good cultural practices is crucial for preventing and managing fungal diseases:

*   **Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy fallen infected leaves, twigs, and other plant debris from around the trees. This reduces the source of inoculum for future infections.
*   **Pruning:** Prune dead, diseased, or overcrowded branches to improve air circulation within the canopy. This reduces humidity, which is favorable for fungal growth. Ensure pruning tools are sterilized between cuts.
*   **Spacing:** In plantations, ensure adequate spacing between trees to prevent overcrowding and promote good air movement.
*   **Watering:** If irrigation is necessary, avoid overhead watering, especially late in the day. Water at the base of the plant to keep foliage dry.
*   **Nutrition:** Maintain balanced soil fertility. Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush, succulent growth that is more susceptible to certain diseases.

Here's how to control the specific fungal diseases mentioned:

### 1. Alternaria (Leaf Spot/Blight)

*   **Symptoms:** Irregular to circular spots on leaves, often with concentric rings, turning dark brown to black. Severe infection can lead to defoliation and blight of young shoots.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Cultural:** Implement general sanitation and pruning practices as mentioned above.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   For preventive control or early stages, spray with contact fungicides:
            *   **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water.
            *   **Chlorothalonil** at 2 g/L of water.
            *   **Copper Oxychloride** at 3 g/L of water.
        *   For systemic action or severe infections, use:
            *   **Propiconazole** at 0.5 ml/L of water.
            *   **Difenoconazole** at 0.5 ml/L of water.
            *   **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5 ml/L of water.

### 2. Anthracnose

*   **Symptoms:** Irregular, sunken spots on leaves, twigs, and sometimes pods, often with dark margins. Can cause dieback of twigs and defoliation.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Cultural:** Remove and destroy infected plant parts. Improve air circulation through pruning.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   For preventive control, spray with contact fungicides:
            *   **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water.
            *   **Chlorothalonil** at 2 g/L of water.
            *   **Copper Oxychloride** at 3 g/L of water.
        *   For systemic control, use:
            *   **Carbendazim** at 1 g/L of water.
            *   **Propiconazole** at 0.5 ml/L of water.
            *   **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5 ml/L of water.

### 3. Blast

*   This is not known to affect Babool.

### 4. Blight (General Leaf/Twig Blight)

*   **Symptoms:** Rapid browning and death of leaves, twigs, or entire shoots. Can be caused by various fungi (e.g., *Alternaria*, *Fusarium*, *Rhizoctonia*). Seedling blight can cause damping-off.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Cultural:** Ensure good drainage, avoid waterlogging. Remove and destroy blighted plant parts.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   For general blight symptoms, especially on foliage:
            *   **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water.
            *   **Chlorothalonil** at 2 g/L of water.
            *   **Propiconazole** at 0.5 ml/L of water.
            *   **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   For seedling blight/damping-off, consider soil drenching or seed treatment (if applicable for nursery stage):
            *   **Carbendazim** at 1 g/L of water (for drenching).
            *   **Thiophanate Methyl** at 1 g/L of water (for drenching).

### 5. Brown Spot

*   **Symptoms:** Circular to irregular brown spots on leaves, which may enlarge and coalesce, leading to defoliation.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Cultural:** Similar to Alternaria and Anthracnose, focus on sanitation and improving air circulation.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   Effective fungicides include:
            *   **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water.
            *   **Chlorothalonil** at 2 g/L of water.
            *   **Carbendazim** at 1 g/L of water.
            *   **Propiconazole** at 0.5 ml/L of water.

### 6. Downy Mildew

*   This is not known to affect Babool.

### 7. Powdery Mildew

*   **Symptoms:** White, powdery patches on the surface of leaves, young stems, and sometimes pods. Infected leaves may become distorted, yellow, and drop prematurely.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Cultural:** Improve air circulation. Avoid excessive nitrogen.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   For effective control, spray with:
            *   **Sulphur** (Wettable Sulphur) at 2-3 g/L of water (ensure good coverage, avoid spraying in very hot weather).
            *   **Hexaconazole** at 0.5 ml/L of water.
            *   **Myclobutanil** at 0.4 ml/L of water.
            *   **Penconazole** at 0.5 ml/L of water.
            *   **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5 ml/L of water.

### 8. Grey Mildew (Assuming Grey Mold / *Botrytis cinerea*)

*   **Symptoms:** Greyish-brown, fuzzy mold growth on leaves, flowers, twigs, or seedlings, especially under high humidity. Can cause damping-off in seedlings, or blight on older plants.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Cultural:** Crucial to reduce humidity. Improve air circulation, avoid overhead irrigation, and remove infected plant parts promptly.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   For effective control, spray with:
            *   **Carbendazim** at 1 g/L of water.
            *   **Thiophanate Methyl** at 1 g/L of water.
            *   **Pyraclostrobin + Metiram** (combination product) at 2 g/L of water.
            *   **Boscalid + Pyraclostrobin** (combination product) at 1.5 g/L of water.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the fungicide label for dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest intervals (if applicable).
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of fungicide resistance.
*   Apply fungicides thoroughly to ensure complete coverage of the foliage.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension specialists for specific recommendations tailored to your exact conditions and disease severity.
