Babool (Acacia nilotica) is a leguminous tree, which means it has the remarkable ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria (Rhizobium) in its root nodules. This significantly reduces its external nitrogen requirement compared to non-leguminous plants. In its natural habitat, established Babool trees often thrive with minimal or no external fertilization, especially if the soil is reasonably fertile.

However, for optimal establishment and initial growth, particularly in degraded soils or during the first few years, a balanced approach focusing on phosphorus, potassium, and sulphur, with very limited nitrogen, can be beneficial.

**It is highly recommended to conduct a soil test before applying any fertilizers to determine the specific nutrient deficiencies in your field.** This will allow for precise and efficient nutrient management.

Based on general recommendations for leguminous trees in Haryana, and assuming average soil conditions (without a soil test), the following can be considered for **young Babool plants (up to 3 years old)** to aid establishment. For mature, established trees, routine fertilization is generally not required unless specific deficiency symptoms are observed or a soil test indicates severe deficiencies.

**For Young Babool Plants (0-3 years):**

*   **Nitrogen (N):** Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, Babool requires very little external nitrogen. A small starter dose can help establishment.
    *   **Urea:** 10-15 kg/acre (split into 2 applications, e.g., at planting and 3-6 months later) OR 20-30 g per plant (applied in a ring around the plant, 15-30 cm away from the stem).
    *   **Nano-Urea:** If used as a foliar supplement, typically 2-4 ml/L water for foliar spray, applied during active growth. This is generally not a primary method for initial tree establishment.
*   **Phosphorus (P):** Crucial for root development, nodulation, and overall plant vigor.
    *   **DAP (Diammonium Phosphate):** 25-30 kg/acre (at planting) OR 50-60 g per plant (at planting).
    *   **SSP (Single Super Phosphate):** 50-60 kg/acre (at planting) OR 100-120 g per plant (at planting). SSP also provides Sulphur and Calcium.
    *   **Nano-DAP:** If used as a foliar supplement, typically 2-4 ml/L water for foliar spray, applied during active growth.
*   **Potassium (K):** Important for water regulation, disease resistance, and overall plant health.
    *   **Potash (Muriate of Potash - MOP):** 15-20 kg/acre (at planting) OR 30-40 g per plant (at planting).
*   **Sulphur (S):** Often deficient in Haryana soils and important for protein synthesis and overall plant metabolism.
    *   **Sulphur (Elemental Sulphur 90% WDG):** If not using SSP, apply 10-15 kg/acre of elemental sulphur (90% WDG) at planting, or 20-30 g per plant.
*   **NPK (Compound Fertilizers):** If using a compound NPK fertilizer, choose one with a lower N ratio, e.g., 10:26:26 or 12:32:16, to account for Babool's nitrogen-fixing ability.
    *   **NPK (e.g., 12:32:16):** 30-40 kg/acre (at planting) OR 60-80 g per plant (at planting). This would provide N, P, and K.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Application Method:** Fertilizers should be applied in a ring around the plant's drip line (the area directly beneath the outer circumference of the branches), not directly at the base of the stem. Lightly incorporate into the soil and water thoroughly to ensure nutrient availability and prevent root burn.
*   **Soil Moisture:** Ensure adequate soil moisture before and after fertilizer application.
*   **Mature Trees:** For established Babool trees (over 3 years old) growing in their natural environment, routine fertilization is generally not necessary. They are well-adapted to local conditions and their nitrogen-fixing ability largely covers their N needs. Fertilize only if specific nutrient deficiencies are identified through soil testing or visual symptoms.
*   **Nano Fertilizers:** Nano-Urea and Nano-DAP are primarily designed for foliar application and are relatively new. While they offer potential benefits in terms of efficiency, their long-term impact and optimal use for established trees are still being researched. For soil application, traditional fertilizers are generally preferred for initial establishment.

This advice is general. For precise recommendations tailored to your specific field conditions, a soil test is indispensable.
