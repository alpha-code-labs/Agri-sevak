As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies in Babool (Acacia nilotica) in Haryana.

Babool trees are generally hardy, but they can be affected by various insect pests, particularly beetles and weevils, which can cause significant damage through defoliation or boring into stems.

### Control of Beetles and Weevils in Babool

Beetles and weevils can be broadly categorized into defoliators (feeding on leaves) and borers (feeding inside stems or branches).

**1. For Defoliating Beetles and Weevils (e.g., *Myllocerus* spp., *Hypolixus truncatulus*):**
These pests feed on the leaves, causing holes, notching, or skeletonization.

*   **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect trees for signs of leaf damage or the presence of adult beetles/weevils.
*   **Mechanical Control:** For young trees or small infestations, hand-picking and destroying the adult insects can be effective.
*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):** In cases of severe defoliation, especially on young trees or plantations, chemical intervention may be necessary. Apply a thorough foliar spray, ensuring good coverage of the foliage.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC:** 2.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Spinosad 45% SC:** 0.25 ml per litre of water. (This is a good option for its relatively lower impact on beneficial insects).
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** 0.2 ml per litre of water.

**2. For Stem and Wood Boring Beetles and Weevils (e.g., *Celosterna scabrator*):**
These pests bore into the stems and branches, leading to wilting, dieback, and weakening of the tree.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy infested branches showing signs of wilting, frass (sawdust-like material), or exit holes. This helps to reduce the pest population.
    *   **Tree Health:** Maintain tree vigour through proper watering and nutrient management, as healthy trees are more resilient to borer attacks.
*   **Chemical Control (Systemic Application):** For active borer infestations, systemic insecticides are effective as they are absorbed by the tree and translocated to the feeding sites of the borers.
    *   **Trunk Injection:** For larger trees, direct injection of systemic insecticides into the trunk can be highly effective.
        *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** 1-2 ml per tree, diluted as per product label instructions for trunk injection.
    *   **Soil Drench:** For smaller trees or as a preventive measure, apply systemic insecticides around the base of the tree.
        *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** 2-5 ml per tree, diluted in 5-10 litres of water, applied evenly around the root zone.
        *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** 2-5 g per tree, diluted in 5-10 litres of water, applied evenly around the root zone.
    *   **Borehole Treatment/Bark Painting:** For visible boreholes, inject a solution directly into the hole and seal it, or paint affected bark areas.
        *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC:** Mix 10 ml per litre of water and apply to affected bark or inject into boreholes.

### Control of Sawflies in Babool

This is not known to affect Babool as a significant pest in Haryana.

### General Recommendations:

*   **Integrated Pest Management (IPM):** Always prioritize cultural and mechanical control methods. Chemical control should be a last resort and used judiciously.
*   **Safety Precautions:** When using any chemical insecticide, always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, and protective clothing. Read and strictly follow the instructions and safety guidelines provided on the product label.
*   **Timing of Application:** Apply insecticides during the cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize evaporation and maximize efficacy. Avoid spraying during windy conditions.
*   **Consult Experts:** For severe or persistent infestations, it is advisable to consult with local agricultural extension officers or entomologists at HAU for specific diagnosis and recommendations.
