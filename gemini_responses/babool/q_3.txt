Babool (Acacia nilotica) is a resilient tree species, vital for agroforestry and ecological balance in Haryana. While generally hardy, it can be susceptible to various rot diseases, particularly under adverse environmental conditions or during the vulnerable seedling stage. Controlling these rots requires an integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods.

Here's a comprehensive strategy to manage various rot types in Babool:

**I. General Management Principles (Applicable to all Rot Types):**

1.  **Site Selection and Soil Health:**
    *   Ensure well-drained soil. Waterlogging is a primary predisposing factor for most rots.
    *   Improve soil structure and organic matter content through farmyard manure (FYM) or compost application to enhance microbial activity and drainage.
    *   Avoid planting in areas with a history of severe rot diseases.

2.  **Sanitation:**
    *   Remove and destroy infected plant parts (leaves, branches, roots) to reduce inoculum.
    *   Sterilize pruning tools before and after use, especially when working on infected trees.

3.  **Avoid Injury:**
    *   Prevent mechanical injuries to roots, stem, and collar region during cultivation, weeding, or other operations, as these serve as entry points for pathogens.

4.  **Proper Irrigation:**
    *   Avoid over-irrigation, especially around the collar region of the plant. Water early in the day to allow foliage and soil surface to dry.

**II. Specific Control Measures:**

**A. For Seed Rot and Seedling Rot (Damping-off) - Primarily in Nursery Stage:**

These rots are critical during seed germination and early seedling development, often caused by *Pythium*, *Phytophthora*, *Rhizoctonia*, and *Fusarium* species.

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Use healthy, certified seeds.
    *   Prepare raised nursery beds to ensure good drainage.
    *   Solarize nursery soil during hot months (May-June) by covering it with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks to reduce pathogen load.
    *   Maintain optimal spacing to ensure good air circulation.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds with bio-fungicides before sowing.
        *   **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum** (WP formulation): 5-10 g/kg seed.
        *   **Pseudomonas fluorescens** (WP formulation): 5-10 g/kg seed.
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply bio-fungicides to nursery beds.
        *   **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum** (WP formulation): 5-10 kg/acre mixed with 100 kg of well-decomposed FYM or compost, applied before sowing or transplanting.

3.  **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Seed Treatment:**
        *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: 2-3 g/kg seed.
        *   **Thiram** 75% WS: 2-3 g/kg seed.
        *   **Metalaxyl** 35% WS: 6 g/kg seed (especially effective against Oomycetes like *Pythium* and *Phytophthora*).
    *   **Nursery Soil Drench (if rot appears):**
        *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: 1-2 g/L water, drench around the base of seedlings.
        *   **Metalaxyl 8% + Mancozeb 64% WP:** 2-2.5 g/L water, drench around the base of seedlings.
        *   **Copper Oxychloride** 50% WP: 2-3 g/L water, drench around the base of seedlings.

**B. For Root, Stem, Foot, Collar, Crown, Neck, and Black Rot - In Established Plants:**

These rots are often caused by soil-borne fungi like *Fusarium*, *Phytophthora*, *Rhizoctonia*, *Sclerotium*, and *Ganoderma*. Black rot can be a general term for dark discoloration associated with these rots.

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Ensure proper drainage around the base of the tree. Create shallow channels to divert excess water.
    *   Avoid piling soil or mulch directly against the tree trunk (collar region).
    *   Prune infected branches or roots (if accessible) and destroy them. Ensure clean cuts.
    *   Maintain tree vigor through balanced nutrition.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   **Soil Drench/Application:**
        *   **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum** (WP formulation): 5-10 g/L water, drench around the root zone of affected trees. Repeat every 3-4 months if conditions persist.
        *   **Pseudomonas fluorescens** (WP formulation): 5-10 g/L water, drench around the root zone.

3.  **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Soil Drench/Collar Application:**
        *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: 1-2 g/L water. Drench 2-5 L solution per tree, depending on size, around the collar region and root zone.
        *   **Metalaxyl 8% + Mancozeb 64% WP:** 2-2.5 g/L water. Drench 2-5 L solution per tree, especially effective if *Phytophthora* or *Pythium* are suspected.
        *   **Propiconazole** 25% EC: 1 ml/L water. Drench around the base of the tree.
        *   **Thiophanate Methyl** 70% WP: 1-1.5 g/L water. Drench around the base of the tree.
        *   **Copper Oxychloride** 50% WP: 2-3 g/L water. Drench around the base of the tree. Can also be applied as a paste (mix with water to form a thick paste) on stem lesions after scraping.

**C. For Fruit Rot (Pods):**

While less common as a major issue in Babool, pod rot can occur under prolonged humid conditions.

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Ensure good air circulation around the tree canopy.
    *   Remove and destroy any infected pods.

2.  **Chemical Control (if severe):**
    *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP: 2-2.5 g/L water. Spray thoroughly covering the pods and foliage.
    *   **Copper Oxychloride** 50% WP: 2-3 g/L water. Spray thoroughly.
    *   **Propiconazole** 25% EC: 1 ml/L water. Spray thoroughly.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Diagnosis:** Accurate diagnosis of the specific pathogen causing the rot is crucial for effective management. If possible, consult with HAU plant pathology experts for confirmation.
*   **Timing:** Apply treatments preventively during periods conducive to disease development (e.g., monsoon season for soil-borne rots, high humidity for fruit rots) or at the first sign of symptoms.
*   **Rotation of Chemicals:** To prevent the development of fungicide resistance, rotate between different classes of fungicides.
*   **Safety:** Always follow label instructions for all chemical and biological products, including recommended dosage, application method, and safety precautions.

By implementing these integrated strategies, the incidence and severity of various rot types in Babool can be effectively managed, ensuring healthy tree growth and productivity.
