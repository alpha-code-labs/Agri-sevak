As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in Babool (Acacia nilotica) in Haryana:

### 1. Borers (Stem and Shoot Borers)

Borers can cause significant damage by tunneling into the stem and branches, leading to wilting, dieback, and even tree mortality.

*   **Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
    *   Regularly inspect trees for signs of borer activity (e.g., frass, exit holes, wilting branches).
    *   Prune and destroy infested branches promptly to prevent further spread.
    *   Maintain tree health through proper watering and nutrition to enhance natural resistance.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **For active boreholes:** Inject a solution of systemic insecticide directly into the boreholes using a syringe, then plug the holes with mud or wax.
        *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20 EC at 2-3 ml/L of water.
        *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8 SL at 1-2 ml/L of water.
    *   **For young trees or prophylactic treatment:**
        *   **Soil Drenching:** Apply a drench around the base of the tree with a systemic insecticide. The quantity of solution depends on the tree size (e.g., 2-5 litres per tree).
            *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20 EC at 5-10 ml/L of water.
            *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8 SL at 1-2 ml/L of water.
        *   **Trunk Painting:** For some borers, painting the trunk with a concentrated solution can offer protection.
            *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20 EC at 20-30 ml/L of water, mixed with white clay or lime, applied to the lower trunk.

### 2. Caterpillars (Defoliators)

Various caterpillar species can defoliate Babool trees, especially during monsoon.

*   **Cultural and Biological Control:**
    *   For young trees or small infestations, hand-picking and destroying caterpillars can be effective.
    *   Encourage natural enemies like parasitic wasps and predatory birds.

*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
    *   **Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) var. kurstaki** (e.g., 1-2 g/L of water or 500-1000 g/acre). This is a biological insecticide specific to caterpillars.
    *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5 SG at 0.2-0.4 g/L of water (or 80-100 g/acre).
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5 SC at 0.2-0.3 ml/L of water (or 60 ml/acre).
    *   **Flubendiamide** 20 WG at 0.2-0.3 g/L of water (or 50-60 g/acre).
    *   **Quinalphos** 25 EC at 2 ml/L of water (or 800 ml/acre).
    *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20 EC at 2 ml/L of water (or 800 ml/acre).

### 3. Diamondback Moth (DBM)

This is not known to affect Babool.

### 4. Leaf Folder

Leaf folders cause damage by folding or rolling leaves and feeding from within, often tying leaves with silk.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Prune and destroy infested leaves or shoots, especially during early stages of infestation.

*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
    *   Control measures are similar to those for defoliating caterpillars, as the larval stage is the target.
    *   **Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) var. kurstaki** (e.g., 1-2 g/L of water or 500-1000 g/acre).
    *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5 SG at 0.2-0.4 g/L of water (or 80-100 g/acre).
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5 SC at 0.2-0.3 ml/L of water (or 60 ml/acre).
    *   **Flubendiamide** 20 WG at 0.2-0.3 g/L of water (or 50-60 g/acre).
    *   **Quinalphos** 25 EC at 2 ml/L of water (or 800 ml/acre).
    *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20 EC at 2 ml/L of water (or 800 ml/acre).

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always ensure thorough coverage when spraying.
*   Follow label instructions for specific product dosages, safety precautions, and pre-harvest intervals (though less critical for Babool unless used for fodder).
*   Consider the size and age of the trees when determining application methods and quantities.
*   Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approaches, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods, are always recommended for sustainable pest control.
