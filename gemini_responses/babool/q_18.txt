As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the use of growth regulators and micronutrients in Babool (Acacia nilotica) for Haryana conditions:

It is important to note that for general growth enhancement of Babool trees in forestry practices, the application of synthetic growth regulators like Ethrel or 2,4-D is not a standard recommendation. Babool is a hardy, fast-growing tree that generally thrives without such interventions under suitable conditions. Boron, however, is an essential micronutrient whose deficiency can significantly impact tree health and growth.

Here are the specific recommendations for the substances you mentioned:

*   **Ethephon (Ethrel)**
    This is not commonly recommended or used as a growth regulator for promoting general vegetative growth or enhancing tree development in Babool in standard forestry practices. While ethephon can be used to induce gum exudation in some Acacia species (like *Acacia senegal*), its application for general growth regulation in *Acacia nilotica* is not a standard practice in Haryana.

*   **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D)**
    This is not commonly recommended or used as a growth regulator for foliar application on Babool trees to promote general growth or development. At low concentrations, 2,4-D acts as an auxin, but its use for enhancing tree growth in forestry is not a standard practice for Babool. At higher concentrations, it functions as a herbicide.

*   **Boron**
    Boron is an essential micronutrient, not a hormone or growth regulator, but it plays a crucial role in cell wall formation, cell division, sugar transport, and pollen viability, all of which are vital for healthy plant growth and development. If a Boron deficiency is diagnosed in the soil or in the Babool trees (symptoms may include stunted growth, dieback of young shoots, or abnormal leaf development), its application can be beneficial.

    *   **Foliar Application (for deficiency correction):**
        *   **Technical Chemical Name:** **Disodium tetraborate decahydrate** (commonly known as Borax, containing approximately 10.5% Boron)
        *   **Recommended Dose:** 1.5 - 2.0 grams per litre of water (0.15 - 0.2% solution).
        *   **Application:** Spray to cover the foliage thoroughly, preferably in the morning or late afternoon. Repeat if deficiency symptoms persist after 2-3 weeks.
    *   **Soil Application (for prophylactic or severe deficiency):**
        *   **Technical Chemical Name:** **Disodium tetraborate decahydrate**
        *   **Recommended Dose:** 5 - 10 kg per acre, depending on soil test results and severity of deficiency. This should be broadcast evenly and incorporated into the soil, ideally before planting or during active growth.

It is always advisable to conduct a soil test and/or plant tissue analysis to confirm any nutrient deficiencies before applying micronutrients like Boron. Over-application of Boron can be toxic to plants.
