As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm that Scale insects and Mealybugs are common sap-sucking pests that can affect Babool (Acacia nilotica) trees in Haryana. Effective control requires an integrated approach.

Here's how to control Scale insects and Mealybugs in Babool:

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy heavily infested branches, twigs, or leaves to reduce pest populations.
*   **Water Jet:** For smaller trees or accessible areas, a strong jet of water can dislodge mealybugs and some scale crawlers.
*   **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect trees for early signs of infestation to enable timely intervention.

**2. Biological Control:**
*   Encourage natural enemies such as ladybird beetles (e.g., *Cryptolaemus montrouzieri* for mealybugs), lacewings, and parasitic wasps. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that can harm these beneficial insects.

**3. Chemical Control (Use CIBRC approved chemicals only, with strict adherence to label instructions):**
For effective control, especially on larger trees, chemical intervention may be necessary. Ensure thorough coverage of the infested parts, including stems, branches, and both sides of leaves.

*   **Horticultural Mineral Oil (HMO):**
    *   Apply a spray of **Horticultural Mineral Oil** (e.g., 80% EC formulation) at a concentration of **10-15 ml per litre of water**. HMO works by suffocating the insects and their eggs. It is effective against all stages, including scales and mealybugs. Ensure complete coverage. Repeat after 10-15 days if infestation persists.

*   **Systemic Insecticides:** These are absorbed by the plant and provide residual control against sap-sucking pests.
    *   **Imidacloprid:** Spray with **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL at **0.5-1 ml per litre of water**.
    *   **Thiamethoxam:** Alternatively, use **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG at **0.2-0.4 g per litre of water**.
    *   **Acetamiprid:** Another effective option is **Acetamiprid** 20% SP at **0.2-0.4 g per litre of water**.
    *   **Spirotetramat:** For persistent and severe infestations, **Spirotetramat** 150 OD at **0.75-1 ml per litre of water** can be highly effective due to its dual-systemic action.

*   **Insect Growth Regulator (IGR):**
    *   **Buprofezin:** **Buprofezin** 25% SC at **1.25-1.5 ml per litre of water** can be used, particularly effective against the nymphal stages of mealybugs and scales by disrupting their molting process.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Timing:** Apply insecticides when pest populations are building up or when young, mobile crawlers of scale insects are active.
*   **Coverage:** For large Babool trees, use high-pressure sprayers to ensure thorough coverage of all infested parts, including the bark, branches, and undersides of leaves.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, and eye protection while handling and spraying chemicals. Follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions strictly.
*   **Rotation:** To prevent the development of resistance, rotate between different classes of insecticides with different modes of action.
*   **Environmental Impact:** Be mindful of the impact on beneficial insects and the environment. Horticultural oils are generally considered safer for beneficial insects once dry.
