As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), here are the recommended cultivation practices for Babool (Acacia nilotica) in Haryana:

**1. Seed Pre-treatment:**
Babool seeds have a hard seed coat that inhibits germination. Pre-treatment is essential for good germination rates.
*   **Hot Water Treatment:** Soak seeds in hot water (around 80-100°C) for 24 hours. Allow the water to cool naturally during this period. This softens the seed coat.

**2. Sowing Method/Pattern:**
Babool can be propagated by direct sowing or by raising seedlings in a nursery and then transplanting. Nursery raising is generally preferred for better establishment and survival.

*   **Nursery Raising:**
    *   Sow pre-treated seeds in polybags (15 cm x 25 cm) or raised nursery beds.
    *   Use a well-drained potting mix of soil, sand, and farmyard manure (1:1:1 ratio).
    *   Seedlings are ready for transplanting to the main field when they are 6-12 months old or have attained a height of 30-60 cm.
*   **Direct Sowing:**
    *   Can be done in pits or lines, especially in areas where large-scale planting is planned and initial care is less intensive.
    *   Prepare pits or furrows before sowing.

**3. Planting Depth:**
*   For both direct sowing and nursery beds/polybags, sow seeds at a depth of **1-2 cm**.

**4. Spacing:**
The spacing for Babool varies significantly depending on the purpose of cultivation (e.g., timber, fodder, agroforestry, boundary planting).

*   **For Timber/Fuelwood Plantations:**
    *   **2 m x 2 m** (approximately 2500 trees/acre) for dense stands.
    *   **3 m x 3 m** (approximately 1111 trees/acre) for moderate density.
    *   **4 m x 4 m** (approximately 625 trees/acre) for wider spacing.
*   **For Agroforestry Systems (with agricultural crops):**
    *   Wider spacing is recommended to minimize competition with crops.
    *   **5 m x 5 m** (approximately 400 trees/acre) or **6 m x 4 m** (approximately 166 trees/acre).
*   **For Boundary Planting/Shelterbelts:**
    *   Trees can be planted closer, typically **2-3 m** apart along the field boundaries.

**5. Seed Dose:**
*   **For Direct Sowing:**
    *   Approximately **5-10 kg** of pre-treated seeds per acre, depending on the desired plant density and expected germination rate.
*   **For Nursery Raising:**
    *   The quantity of seeds required depends on the number of seedlings to be raised. Babool seeds typically have 8,000-12,000 seeds per kg. With proper pre-treatment and care, 1 kg of seeds can yield 4,000-8,000 viable seedlings.
