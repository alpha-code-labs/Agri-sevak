As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding Babool (Acacia nilotica) in Haryana:

**Maturity Signs for Babool Pods:**

*   **Colour Change:** The most prominent sign is the change in pod colour from green to a dark brown or blackish hue.
*   **Dryness and Brittleness:** Mature pods become dry, hard, and brittle to the touch. They will not feel fleshy or pliable.
*   **Seed Hardness:** When a pod is broken open, the seeds inside should be hard, dark brown to black, and fully developed.
*   **Natural Shedding:** Some mature pods may start to naturally fall from the tree, indicating readiness for harvest.

**Harvesting Time for Babool in Haryana:**

*   Babool typically flowers after the monsoon season (August-September) and the pods mature over several months.
*   The optimal harvesting period in Haryana generally falls between **March and May**. This timing ensures the pods are fully mature and dry, minimizing post-harvest losses.
*   Harvesting can extend into early June depending on local climatic variations and the specific tree's fruiting cycle.

**Cutting/Harvesting Process for Babool Pods:**

*   **Hand Picking:** For smaller trees or lower branches, pods are typically hand-picked directly from the tree. This allows for selective harvesting of fully mature pods.
*   **Pole Harvesting:** For taller trees, long poles equipped with hooks or small cutting blades are used to reach and detach the mature pods. Care should be taken to avoid damaging the tree branches.
*   **Collection of Fallen Pods:** While less ideal due to potential quality degradation (e.g., moisture absorption, pest infestation), naturally fallen, dry pods can also be collected from the ground, especially in areas where trees are abundant.
*   **Post-Harvest Drying:** After collection, the pods should be spread out in a thin layer on a clean, dry surface (e.g., tarpaulin, concrete yard) under direct sunlight for several days. This further drying ensures complete moisture removal, which is crucial for preventing fungal growth and pest infestation during storage.
*   **Seed Extraction:** Once thoroughly dry, the pods can be threshed or crushed to extract the seeds. Traditional methods involve beating the dried pods with sticks or using small mechanical threshers.
