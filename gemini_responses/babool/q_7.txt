As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling diseases in Babool (Acacia nilotica) in Haryana:

**1. Dieback in Babool**
Dieback in Babool can be caused by various fungal pathogens and environmental stresses, leading to the progressive drying and death of twigs and branches.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Prune affected branches well into healthy wood, ensuring clean cuts.
    *   Collect and destroy all pruned material (burning or deep burying) to prevent further spread of pathogens.
    *   Ensure proper tree nutrition and adequate irrigation to enhance tree vigor and natural resistance.
    *   Avoid mechanical injuries to the tree, as these can serve as entry points for pathogens.
*   **Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
    *   Apply a broad-spectrum fungicide after pruning and during periods conducive to disease development.
    *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 1 g/L of water.
    *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP at 2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Copper Oxychloride** 50% WP at 3 g/L of water.
    *   Ensure thorough coverage of the canopy. Repeat applications as per product label or disease severity.

**2. Twig Blight in Babool**
Twig blight is characterized by the drying and death of twigs, often starting from the tips, and can be caused by various fungal pathogens.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Regularly inspect trees and prune out blighted twigs as soon as they appear, cutting into healthy wood.
    *   Maintain good orchard sanitation by removing and destroying infected plant debris.
    *   Avoid practices that cause wounds to the tree, as these can be entry points for pathogens.
*   **Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
    *   Apply fungicides preventively or at the first sign of symptoms, especially during humid conditions.
    *   **Propiconazole** 25% EC at 1 ml/L of water.
    *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 1 g/L of water.
    *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP at 2.5 g/L of water.
    *   Ensure complete coverage of the foliage and twigs.

**3. Tikka Disease in Babool**
This is not known to affect Babool. Tikka disease is primarily a disease of groundnut (peanut) caused by *Cercospora arachidicola* and *Cercosporidium personatum*.
