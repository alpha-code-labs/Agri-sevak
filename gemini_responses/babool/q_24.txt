As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following for the ideal transplantation of Babool (Acacia nilotica) in Haryana:

**Ideal Transplantation Time for Babool (Acacia nilotica):**
*   The most ideal time for transplanting Babool seedlings in Haryana is during the monsoon season, typically from **July to August**. This period benefits from natural rainfall, which significantly aids in the establishment of the young plants and reduces transplant shock.
*   Alternatively, transplantation can also be done in **February-March** (late winter/early spring) if assured irrigation facilities are available, allowing the plants to establish before the peak summer heat. However, monsoon planting is generally preferred for better survival rates and reduced irrigation dependency.

**Transplantation Distance for Babool (Acacia nilotica):**
*   The spacing depends on the purpose of planting:
    *   **For Agroforestry/Boundary Planting/Shelterbelts:** A spacing of **4 meters x 4 meters** to **5 meters x 5 meters** is generally recommended to allow for proper canopy development, minimize competition, and facilitate intercropping if desired.
    *   **For Block Planting/Fuelwood/Fodder Production (with future thinning):** A closer spacing of **3 meters x 3 meters** can be adopted initially, with thinning carried out as the trees grow to manage density.

**Transplantation Process for Babool (Acacia nilotica):**
1.  **Nursery Stock Selection:** Use healthy, vigorous seedlings, typically 6-12 months old, raised in polybags or root trainers, with a height of 30-60 cm. Ensure the root system is well-developed and free from diseases or pests.
2.  **Pit Preparation:** Dig pits of **45 cm x 45 cm x 45 cm** (length x width x depth) at the desired spacing. It is advisable to dig pits a few weeks before planting to allow the soil to aerate.
3.  **Soil Amendment:** Refill the pits with a mixture of topsoil, **5-10 kg** of well-decomposed Farmyard Manure (FYM) or compost, and **50-100 grams** of **Single Super Phosphate** per pit. Mix these components thoroughly with the soil.
4.  **Planting:**
    *   Carefully remove the seedling from its polybag or root trainer, ensuring the root ball remains intact. Avoid disturbing the roots as much as possible.
    *   Place the seedling in the center of the prepared pit, ensuring the root collar (the point where the stem meets the roots) is at ground level.
    *   Backfill the pit with the amended soil mixture, gently firming the soil around the base of the plant to remove any air pockets.
5.  **Watering:** Immediately after planting, provide thorough watering. Continue regular watering, especially during dry periods, until the plant is well-established. During monsoon, supplemental watering might be needed if there are long dry spells.
6.  **Protection:** Protect young seedlings from livestock grazing, rodents, and other pests by using tree guards, fencing, or thorny branches around the plant.
7.  **Weeding:** Keep the area around the young plant free of weeds for at least the first 1-2 years to reduce competition for nutrients and water.
