Dear Farmer,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU), Hisar, I recommend the following doses of organic manures for Babool (Acacia nilotica) to enhance its growth, vigour, and soil health in Haryana conditions. Babool, being a hardy tree, benefits significantly from organic matter, which improves soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability.

Here are the recommended doses:

*   **Farmyard Manure (FYM):**
    *   **For newly planted saplings:** Apply **5-10 kg** of well-decomposed FYM per pit, thoroughly mixed with the soil before planting.
    *   **For established trees (1-3 years old):** Apply **10-15 kg** of FYM per tree annually, spread evenly around the root zone and lightly incorporated into the soil, preferably before the monsoon or during winter.
    *   **For mature trees (>3 years old):** Apply **15-20 kg** of FYM per tree annually, following the same application method.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   **For newly planted saplings:** Apply **1-2 kg** of vermicompost per pit, mixed well with the soil before planting.
    *   **For established trees (1-3 years old):** Apply **2-3 kg** of vermicompost per tree annually, spread around the root zone.
    *   **For mature trees (>3 years old):** Apply **3-5 kg** of vermicompost per tree annually.

*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract Bio-stimulant):**
    *   Sagarika is a bio-stimulant and not a bulk manure, but it significantly aids in root development and nutrient uptake.
    *   **For soil drenching (around the root zone):** Mix **2-4 ml** of **Sagarika** per litre of water. Apply **2-5 litres** of this solution per young tree or **5-10 litres** for mature trees, ensuring the solution reaches the root zone.
    *   **Application frequency:** Apply 2-3 times a year during active growth phases (e.g., post-monsoon, spring flush) for best results.

Always ensure that the organic manures are well-decomposed to avoid nutrient lock-up and pest issues. Regular application of these organic inputs will contribute to the long-term health and productivity of your Babool trees.
