Babool (Acacia nilotica) is indeed susceptible to various wilt diseases, including those caused by soil-borne fungal pathogens like *Fusarium* species, which can lead to symptoms resembling parawilt (sudden wilting). Effective management requires an integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods.

Here's how to control wilt in Babool:

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Sanitation:** Promptly remove and destroy severely infected or dead trees and branches to reduce the inoculum source.
*   **Improve Soil Drainage:** Ensure good soil drainage around the trees. Waterlogging can stress roots and make them more susceptible to fungal infections.
*   **Avoid Mechanical Injury:** Prevent any damage to the roots or trunk during cultivation or other activities, as wounds can serve as entry points for pathogens.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide adequate and balanced nutrients to maintain tree vigour, making them more resilient to diseases. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can promote lush growth susceptible to disease.
*   **Proper Watering:** Water trees deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out slightly between waterings.

**2. Biological Control:**
*   **Bio-fungicides:** Application of beneficial microbial antagonists can help suppress soil-borne pathogens.
    *   **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum**: Apply 5-10 g/L of water as a soil drench around the base of the affected trees. For larger areas, mix 2.5 kg/acre of the formulation with 50 kg of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost and apply around the root zone. Repeat application every 3-4 months, especially during favourable conditions for disease development.

**3. Chemical Control (for severe cases or early intervention):**
*   **Systemic Fungicides:** These can be effective when applied as a soil drench to reach the root system where the pathogens reside.
    *   **Carbendazim**: Prepare a solution by mixing **1 g/L** of water. Drench the soil around the base of the affected tree with 5-10 litres of this solution, depending on the tree's size. Ensure the solution penetrates the root zone.
    *   **Thiophanate-methyl**: Prepare a solution by mixing **1 g/L** of water. Drench the soil around the base of the affected tree with 5-10 litres of this solution, ensuring it reaches the root zone.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Early detection and intervention are crucial for effective management of wilt diseases.
*   Always follow the manufacturer's instructions for dosage and safety precautions when using any chemical.
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in pathogens.
*   Consult with a local agricultural expert or HAU extension specialist for specific recommendations tailored to your exact situation and disease diagnosis.
