As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests on Babool (Acacia nilotica) in Haryana:

### Control Measures for Pests on Babool

**1. Grasshopper**
Grasshoppers are generalist feeders and can affect Babool, especially young plants.

*   **Cultural Control:** For small infestations, hand-picking and destroying the nymphs and adults can be effective.
*   **Chemical Control:** In case of severe infestation, the following CIBRC approved insecticides can be used:
    *   **Malathion 50% EC**: Apply at 1.25 L per acre (diluted in 500-600 L of water) as a foliar spray, or 2.5 ml per litre of water for spot treatment.
    *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC**: Apply at 1.0-1.25 L per acre (diluted in 500-600 L of water) as a foliar spray, or 2.0-2.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC**: Apply at 200-250 ml per acre (diluted in 500-600 L of water) as a foliar spray, or 0.4-0.5 ml per litre of water.

**2. Painted bug (Bagrada hilaris)**
This is not known to affect Babool. Painted bug is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops like mustard, cabbage, and radish.

**3. Red cotton bug (Dysdercus cingulatus)**
This is not known to affect Babool. Red cotton bug is primarily a pest of cotton and other malvaceous plants, feeding on developing seeds.

**4. Black ants**
Black ants can be found on Babool, often attracted to honeydew secreted by other sap-sucking insects (like aphids or mealybugs) or nesting in the vicinity. While they may not directly feed on the tree, they can protect other pests or cause nuisance.

*   **Integrated Approach:** First, identify and control any primary sap-sucking pests that the ants might be tending for honeydew.
*   **Direct Ant Control:** For direct control of ant nests or trails:
    *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC**: Apply at 2.5 ml per litre of water as a drench around the base of the tree or directly into ant nests.
    *   **Fipronil 0.3% GR**: Apply at 10-15 kg per acre, broadcast around the base of affected trees or directly on ant mounds.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC**: Apply at 0.4-0.5 ml per litre of water, sprayed on ant trails or around the base of the tree.
