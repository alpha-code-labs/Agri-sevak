As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I must provide scientifically verified advice.

Regarding your query about controlling Fruit fly and Ber fly in Babool (Acacia nilotica):

*   **Fruit fly (Bactrocera spp.)**: This is not known to significantly affect Babool. Common fruit flies primarily infest fleshy fruits like mango, guava, citrus, and cucurbits. Babool produces pods, and while various insects can bore into pods, the typical "fruit fly" species are not recognized as major pests of Babool.
*   **Ber fly (Carpomyia vesuviana)**: This is not known to affect Babool. The Ber fly is a highly specific pest of Ber (Ziziphus mauritiana) and does not infest other plant species like Babool.
