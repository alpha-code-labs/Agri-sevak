As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Scab, Canker, Gummosis, and Lichen in Babool (Acacia nilotica) in Haryana:

### Scab

This is not known to affect Babool in the typical sense of the disease 'Scab' as it affects other crops like apple or potato. Babool may experience various leaf spot diseases caused by different fungi, but these are generally not referred to as 'Scab'.

### Canker

Yes, Babool can be affected by cankers, which are sunken, necrotic lesions on the bark, branches, or trunk, often caused by fungal or bacterial pathogens, especially on stressed or wounded trees.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Prune out infected branches well below the canker during dry periods to prevent spread. Ensure pruning tools are sterilized with a 1% sodium hypochlorite solution between cuts.
    *   Maintain tree vigor through proper irrigation and nutrition.
    *   Avoid mechanical injuries to the bark.
*   **Chemical Control (for active infections or as a protective measure on wounds):**
    *   Apply a paste or spray containing **Copper oxychloride** at 3 g/L of water, or **Carbendazim** at 1 g/L of water, directly to the canker after scraping away loose bark, or as a protective spray after pruning.
    *   For severe cases, systemic fungicides like **Propiconazole** or **Thiophanate methyl** might be considered through soil drenching or trunk injection, but this should be done under expert supervision for specific dosage and method.

### Gummosis

Yes, gummosis (exudation of gum) is a common physiological response in Babool. It is usually a symptom of underlying stress, injury, or disease rather than a disease itself.

*   **Identify and Address the Underlying Cause:**
    *   **Stress:** Improve growing conditions (e.g., proper drainage, adequate water during drought, balanced nutrition).
    *   **Mechanical Injury:** Protect trees from wounds.
    *   **Insect Damage:** Identify and control borers or other insects causing damage.
    *   **Fungal/Bacterial Infection (often associated with cankers):** If gummosis is accompanied by cankers, follow the control measures for Canker as described above.
*   **Wound Management:**
    *   Carefully scrape away the gum and any discolored bark.
    *   Apply a fungicidal paste or spray to the cleaned area.
    *   **Chemicals:**
        *   **Copper oxychloride** at 3 g/L of water, applied as a paste or spray.
        *   **Carbendazim** at 1 g/L of water, applied as a paste or spray.

### Lichen

Yes, lichens are commonly found growing on the bark of Babool trees. However, lichens are symbiotic organisms (fungus and alga) that are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surface of the tree without parasitizing it or drawing nutrients from it. They are generally harmless to the tree.

*   **Control:**
    *   **Generally Not Recommended:** Since lichens do not harm the tree, control measures are usually unnecessary. Their presence often indicates good air quality.
    *   **If removal is desired for aesthetic reasons (rarely needed):**
        *   Gently scrub the bark with a stiff brush and water during the dormant season.
        *   In extreme cases, a very dilute solution of **Copper oxychloride** (e.g., 1 g/L of water) can be sprayed, but this is usually overkill and not recommended for routine use as it can affect other beneficial organisms. Ensure proper safety precautions if using chemicals.
