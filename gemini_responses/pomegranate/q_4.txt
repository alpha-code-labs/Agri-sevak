As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the significant challenges posed by Wilt and Parawilt in Pomegranate cultivation across Haryana. Effective management requires an integrated approach, distinguishing between the causes and applying appropriate strategies.

**Understanding Wilt and Parawilt in Pomegranate:**

1.  **Pomegranate Wilt (Fungal/Bacterial):** This is primarily caused by soil-borne fungal pathogens such as *Ceratocystis fimbriata*, *Fusarium oxysporum*, and *Verticillium dahliae*. Bacterial wilt can also occur, though less common as a primary cause. These pathogens infect the roots and vascular system, leading to blockages and eventual wilting and death of the plant.
2.  **Pomegranate Parawilt (Physiological):** This is a non-pathogenic disorder, often triggered by sudden environmental stresses. Key factors include abrupt changes in soil moisture (e.g., prolonged drought followed by heavy irrigation, or vice-versa), high soil temperatures, root damage during intercultural operations, and nutrient imbalances. Plants show sudden wilting without clear signs of pathogen infection in the early stages.

**Control Measures for Pomegranate Wilt (Fungal/Bacterial):**

An integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods is crucial.

**1. Cultural and Horticultural Practices:**
    *   **Site Selection:** Avoid planting in fields with a history of wilt or in poorly drained, waterlogged soils.
    *   **Soil Health:** Improve soil drainage and aeration by incorporating well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost (5-10 kg/plant annually).
    *   **Disease-Free Planting Material:** Always use healthy, certified, disease-free saplings from reputable nurseries.
    *   **Root Protection:** Avoid any injury to roots during intercultural operations (e.g., weeding, hoeing), as wounds serve as entry points for pathogens.
    *   **Pruning and Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected branches or entire plants immediately to prevent further spread. Sanitize pruning tools with a 10% bleach solution or alcohol after each cut.
    *   **Irrigation Management:** While not the primary cause, erratic irrigation can stress plants, making them more susceptible. Maintain consistent soil moisture.

**2. Biological Control:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply beneficial microbial antagonists to the soil around the root zone.
        *   **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum**: Apply 2-4 kg/acre mixed with 100 kg of well-decomposed FYM or compost, or drench with a suspension of 5-10 g/L water around the root zone.
        *   **Pseudomonas fluorescens**: Apply 2-4 kg/acre mixed with 100 kg of well-decomposed FYM or compost, or drench with a suspension of 5-10 g/L water around the root zone.
    *   Repeat applications every 3-4 months, especially during favorable conditions for the pathogen.

**3. Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved Technical Names):**
    *   **Soil Drenching:** For existing infections, drenching the soil around the affected plants is effective.
        *   **Carbendazim 50% WP**: Drench with 1-2 g/L water (2-5 L solution per plant depending on age and size).
        *   **Thiophanate-methyl 70% WP**: Drench with 1-1.5 g/L water (2-5 L solution per plant).
        *   **Propiconazole 25% EC**: Drench with 0.5-1 ml/L water (2-5 L solution per plant).
    *   **Trunk Swab/Paste:** For cankers or lesions on the main stem, a paste can be applied.
        *   **Copper Oxychloride 50% WP**: Make a paste with 50 g of fungicide in 100 ml of water and apply to the affected trunk area.
    *   **Preventive Drenching:** In areas with a history of wilt, preventive drenching can be done during critical periods (e.g., post-monsoon).
        *   **Mancozeb 75% WP**: Drench with 2-2.5 g/L water (2-5 L solution per plant).

**Control Measures for Pomegranate Parawilt (Physiological):**

Since Parawilt is a physiological disorder, management focuses on alleviating stress and maintaining optimal growing conditions.

**1. Irrigation Management (Most Critical):**
    *   **Consistent Moisture:** Maintain uniform soil moisture. Avoid sudden and drastic fluctuations in irrigation.
    *   **Drip Irrigation:** Implement drip irrigation for precise and consistent water delivery, reducing water stress.
    *   **Avoid Waterlogging:** Ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging, which can damage roots and induce stress.
    *   **Timely Irrigation:** Irrigate adequately during dry spells and reduce irrigation during heavy rains.

**2. Soil Temperature Regulation:**
    *   **Mulching:** Apply organic mulches (e.g., straw, dry leaves, sugarcane trash) around the base of the plants. This helps conserve soil moisture, regulate soil temperature, and reduce evaporation.
    *   **White Wash:** In extreme heat, painting the main trunk with a lime wash can help reflect sunlight and reduce stem temperature.

**3. Root Protection:**
    *   **Minimize Disturbance:** Avoid deep cultivation or any activity that might damage the root system, as root injury is a major trigger for Parawilt.
    *   **Weed Control:** Manage weeds without disturbing the root zone, preferably through mulching or shallow hand weeding.

**4. Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Balanced Fertilization:** Ensure balanced nutrition based on soil test reports. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can lead to lush, succulent growth more susceptible to stress.
    *   **Micronutrients:** Address any micronutrient deficiencies, as these can weaken the plant.

**5. Stress Alleviation:**
    *   **Shading:** In areas prone to extreme heat, temporary shading during peak summer months can help reduce plant stress.

**General Recommendations:**

*   **Regular Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your orchard for early signs of wilt or parawilt to enable timely intervention.
*   **Soil Testing:** Conduct regular soil tests to understand nutrient status and soil health, guiding appropriate amendments.
*   **Consult Experts:** For precise dosages and application timings, always consult with local agricultural extension officers or HAU experts, as recommendations may vary based on specific field conditions and product formulations.

By implementing these integrated strategies, pomegranate growers in Haryana can effectively manage and mitigate the impact of Wilt and Parawilt, ensuring healthier orchards and better yields.
