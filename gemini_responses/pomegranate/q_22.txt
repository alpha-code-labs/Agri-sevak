As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified recommendations for Pomegranate cultivation practices in Haryana:

Pomegranate is primarily propagated vegetatively for commercial orchards to ensure genetic purity and consistent fruit quality. Therefore, the terms "sowing method" and "seed dose" are not directly applicable in the traditional sense for establishing a commercial pomegranate orchard.

Here are the recommended practices:

*   **Propagation Method (Addressing "Sowing method/pattern" and "Seed dose")**:
    *   Commercial pomegranate orchards are established using vegetatively propagated plant material, not by direct sowing of seeds. This ensures that the plants are true-to-type and bear fruit of the desired quality.
    *   Common propagation methods include:
        *   **Hardwood cuttings**: Rooted cuttings are prepared from mature shoots.
        *   **Air layering (Gootee)**: This method involves rooting a branch while it is still attached to the parent plant.
        *   **Grafting**: Sometimes used, especially for specific rootstock benefits.
    *   Therefore, there is no "seed dose" for commercial pomegranate cultivation. Instead, you would determine the number of healthy, disease-free saplings or rooted cuttings required based on your chosen spacing.

*   **Planting Depth**:
    *   When planting saplings or rooted cuttings, ensure that the root ball is placed at the same depth as it was in the nursery bag or pot.
    *   The top of the root ball should be level with or slightly below the surrounding soil surface.
    *   If using grafted plants, ensure the graft union remains well above the soil surface to prevent scion rooting.

*   **Spacing**:
    *   The optimal spacing depends on the variety, soil fertility, irrigation availability, and the pruning system adopted.
    *   **Standard Spacing**:
        *   **4 meters (plant-to-plant) x 4 meters (row-to-row)**. This spacing allows for good canopy development, light penetration, and ease of cultural operations. This translates to approximately 625 plants per hectare (or about 253 plants per acre).
    *   **High-Density Planting (HDP)**: For certain varieties and under intensive management with proper pruning, HDP can be adopted to maximize yield per unit area.
        *   **3 meters (plant-to-plant) x 3 meters (row-to-row)**. This spacing requires more rigorous pruning to manage canopy size and maintain productivity. This translates to approximately 1111 plants per hectare (or about 450 plants per acre).
        *   **4.5 meters (row-to-row) x 2.5 meters (plant-to-plant)** (rectangular system) can also be considered for HDP, especially with drip irrigation.

It is crucial to select healthy, certified planting material from a reputable nursery to ensure a successful orchard.
