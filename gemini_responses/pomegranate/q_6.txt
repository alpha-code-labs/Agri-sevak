As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling viral diseases in Pomegranate in Haryana:

It is crucial to understand that there is no direct chemical cure for viral diseases once a plant is infected. Control strategies primarily focus on prevention, managing vectors (insects that transmit viruses), and sanitation.

Here's the breakdown for each condition:

*   **Leaf curl (Pomegranate Leaf Curl Virus - PoLCV):**
    This virus is known to affect Pomegranate and is primarily transmitted by whiteflies.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   **Use healthy planting material:** Always source certified virus-free saplings from reputable nurseries.
        *   **Roguing:** Immediately remove and destroy (burn or bury deep) any infected plants showing symptoms to prevent further spread.
        *   **Vector Control (Whiteflies):** Manage whitefly populations, which act as vectors for the virus.
            *   Spray with insecticides when whitefly populations are observed.
            *   **Buprofezin** 25% SC @ 1.25 ml/L of water.
            *   **Spiromesifen** 22.9% SC @ 0.6 ml/L of water.
            *   **Flonicamid** 50% WG @ 0.3 g/L of water.
            *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG @ 0.2 g/L of water.
            *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL @ 0.5 ml/L of water.

*   **Mosaic (Pomegranate Mosaic Virus - PMV):**
    This virus is known to affect Pomegranate. It is primarily transmitted through infected propagation material (grafting, cuttings) and possibly through sap.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   **Use healthy planting material:** This is the most critical step. Ensure all propagation material is virus-free.
        *   **Roguing:** Remove and destroy infected plants promptly.
        *   **Sanitation:** Disinfect pruning tools with a 10% bleach solution or 70% alcohol between plants to prevent mechanical transmission.

*   **Yellow vein clearing (Pomegranate Yellow Vein Clearing Virus - PYVCV):**
    This virus is known to affect Pomegranate and is primarily transmitted by whiteflies.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   **Use healthy planting material:** Source certified virus-free saplings.
        *   **Roguing:** Immediately remove and destroy infected plants.
        *   **Vector Control (Whiteflies):** Manage whitefly populations using the same insecticides as listed for Leaf Curl.
            *   **Buprofezin** 25% SC @ 1.25 ml/L of water.
            *   **Spiromesifen** 22.9% SC @ 0.6 ml/L of water.
            *   **Flonicamid** 50% WG @ 0.3 g/L of water.
            *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG @ 0.2 g/L of water.
            *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL @ 0.5 ml/L of water.

*   **Stripe (Pomegranate Necrotic Stripe Virus - PNSV):**
    This virus is known to affect Pomegranate. Transmission can occur through infected propagation material and possibly through sap.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   **Use healthy planting material:** Ensure all propagation material is virus-free.
        *   **Roguing:** Remove and destroy infected plants promptly.
        *   **Sanitation:** Disinfect pruning tools between plants.

*   **Tristeza:**
    This is not known to affect Pomegranate. Citrus Tristeza Virus (CTV) primarily affects citrus species.

*   **Stunt virus (e.g., Pomegranate Stunt Viroid - PSVd):**
    Stunting conditions caused by viruses or viroids are known to affect Pomegranate. These are primarily transmitted through infected propagation material and mechanical means.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   **Use healthy planting material:** This is paramount. Use only certified virus/viroid-free planting material.
        *   **Roguing:** Remove and destroy any stunted or symptomatic plants.
        *   **Sanitation:** Disinfect pruning tools thoroughly between plants to prevent mechanical transmission.

**General Recommendations for Viral Disease Management in Pomegranate:**

*   **Integrated Pest Management (IPM):** Implement an IPM approach that combines cultural, biological, and chemical methods for vector control.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure proper nutrition and irrigation to maintain plant vigor, which can help plants tolerate stress better.
*   **Weed Control:** Control weeds in and around the orchard, as they can harbor both viruses and their insect vectors.
*   **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect plants for symptoms of viral diseases and the presence of insect vectors.
