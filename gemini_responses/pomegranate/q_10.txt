As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), here is the scientifically verified advice for controlling borers, caterpillars, Diamondback moth, and leaf folders in Pomegranate in Haryana:

### Pomegranate Pests and Control Measures

**1. Borers:**

*   **Pomegranate Fruit Borer (Deudorix isocrates):** This is a major pest where the larvae bore into developing fruits, making them unfit for consumption.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   Regular monitoring of fruits for entry holes and signs of damage.
        *   Bagging of individual fruits with butter paper or cloth bags can be effective in small orchards.
        *   **Chemical Control (Spray at fruit setting stage and repeat as needed, typically 2-3 sprays at 15-day intervals):**
            *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC @ 0.3 ml/L of water.
            *   **Flubendiamide** 20% WG @ 0.25 g/L of water.
            *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG @ 0.2 g/L of water.
*   **Stem Borers (e.g., Indarbela quadrinotata, Zeuzera coffeae):** Larvae bore into the main stem and branches, leading to weakening or death of affected parts.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   Identify bore holes and remove the larvae physically using a hooked wire.
        *   Inject a cotton swab soaked in **Dichlorvos** 76% EC or **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC into the bore hole and seal it with mud to kill the larva inside.

**2. Caterpillars:**

*   This category includes various defoliating caterpillars that feed on leaves and sometimes young shoots, as well as the larval stage of the Pomegranate Fruit Borer.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   Hand-picking and destruction of larvae in early stages for small infestations.
        *   **Chemical Control (Spray when infestation is observed):**
            *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC @ 0.3 ml/L of water.
            *   **Flubendiamide** 20% WG @ 0.25 g/L of water.
            *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG @ 0.2 g/L of water.
            *   **Indoxacarb** 14.5% SC @ 0.5 ml/L of water.
            *   **Spinosad** 45% SC @ 0.16 ml/L of water.

**3. Diamondback Moth:**

*   This is not known to affect Pomegranate. Diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops.

**4. Leaf Folder:**

*   While a specific "Pomegranate Leaf Folder" is not as prominent as the fruit borer, general leaf-folding caterpillars can occasionally affect pomegranate, causing leaves to fold or roll, hindering photosynthesis.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   Remove and destroy infested leaves/shoots to reduce pest population.
        *   **Chemical Control (Spray when leaf folding is observed):**
            *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC @ 0.3 ml/L of water.
            *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG @ 0.2 g/L of water.
            *   **Indoxacarb** 14.5% SC @ 0.5 ml/L of water.

Always ensure proper spray coverage and follow the manufacturer's instructions for dosage and safety precautions. It is also advisable to rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
