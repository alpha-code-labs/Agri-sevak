As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling dropping in Pomegranate:

Firstly, regarding "Tinda/Boll dropping":
This is not known to affect Pomegranate. "Tinda" refers to Indian round gourd, and "boll" is a term used for the fruit capsule of plants like cotton. These terms are not applicable to pomegranate.

Now, addressing Flower drop and Fruit drop in Pomegranate:

Flower and fruit drop are common physiological issues in pomegranate, often caused by a combination of factors including:
*   Nutritional deficiencies (especially Boron and Zinc).
*   Hormonal imbalances within the plant.
*   Environmental stresses such as high temperatures, water stress (both deficit and excess), and low humidity.
*   Poor pollination.
*   Excessive fruit load.

To effectively control flower and fruit drop, an integrated approach combining good cultural practices and judicious use of plant growth regulators and micronutrients is recommended:

**I. Cultural Practices:**

1.  **Irrigation Management:** Maintain consistent soil moisture, especially during flowering and fruit development stages. Avoid both waterlogging and severe drought stress.
2.  **Nutrient Management:** Ensure balanced nutrition. Conduct soil and leaf analysis to identify specific deficiencies.
3.  **Pollination:** Ensure adequate pollinator activity.

**II. Chemical Interventions:**

The following CIBRC approved technical chemicals can be used to reduce flower and fruit drop:

1.  **Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs):**
    *   **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA):**
        *   **Application:** Spray at the full bloom stage and again at the fruit set stage (when fruits are pea-sized).
        *   **Dosage:** 0.2 - 0.4 ml/L of water (for 4.5% SL formulation). This translates to approximately 10-20 ppm.

2.  **Micronutrients:**
    *   **Boron:** Boron is crucial for pollen viability, fertilization, and fruit set.
        *   **Technical Chemical:** **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (20.5% Boron) or **Borax** (10.5% Boron).
        *   **Application:** Foliar spray before flowering and again after fruit set.
        *   **Dosage:**
            *   **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate**: 0.5 - 1 g/L of water.
            *   **Borax**: 1 - 1.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Zinc:** Zinc plays a vital role in hormone production and overall plant metabolism, impacting flowering and fruit development.
        *   **Technical Chemical:** **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (21% Zinc) or **Zinc EDTA** (12% Zinc).
        *   **Application:** Foliar spray before flowering and again after fruit set.
        *   **Dosage:**
            *   **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate**: 2 - 3 g/L of water.
            *   **Zinc EDTA**: 0.5 - 1 g/L of water. (Zinc EDTA is often preferred for better absorption).

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always ensure thorough coverage of the foliage during spraying.
*   Use the recommended dosages precisely, as higher concentrations of PGRs can have adverse effects.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension services for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and the specific pomegranate variety.
