As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling physical damage in Pomegranate:

### 1. Fruit Bursting (Fruit Cracking)

Fruit bursting is primarily caused by sudden fluctuations in soil moisture (e.g., heavy irrigation or rainfall after a prolonged dry spell), high temperatures, low humidity, and deficiencies of certain micronutrients like Boron and Calcium. Varietal susceptibility also plays a role.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Consistent Water Management:**
    *   Maintain uniform soil moisture throughout the fruit development period.
    *   Utilize drip irrigation to provide precise and consistent water supply, avoiding extremes of wet and dry conditions.
    *   Avoid heavy irrigation immediately after a dry spell, especially when fruits are nearing maturity.
*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Conduct regular soil and leaf analysis to identify nutrient deficiencies.
    *   **Boron:** Apply **Disodium tetraborate decahydrate** (Borax) at 10-15 kg/acre as a soil application based on soil test recommendations, or 1-2 g/L water as a foliar spray during fruit development.
    *   **Calcium:** Apply **Calcium nitrate** at 5-10 g/L water as a foliar spray, starting from fruit set and repeating at 15-20 day intervals. Calcium strengthens cell walls and improves fruit integrity.
    *   **Potassium:** Ensure adequate Potassium supply, as it helps in water regulation within the plant. Apply **Potassium nitrate** at 5-10 g/L water as a foliar spray during fruit development.
*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Mulching around the tree base helps conserve soil moisture, regulate soil temperature, and reduce evaporation.
    *   Provide partial shade to the orchard during peak summer months to reduce extreme temperature fluctuations.
*   **Plant Growth Regulators:**
    *   Foliar application of **Gibberellic acid** at 10-25 mg/L (ppm) during early fruit development can sometimes help improve fruit quality and reduce cracking, but should be used judiciously.

### 2. Leaf Burning/Melting (Sunscald, Heat Stress, Water Stress)

Leaf burning or melting is often a symptom of severe heat stress, sunscald, or extreme water stress (both deficit and excess). It can also be exacerbated by nutrient imbalances or high salt concentrations in the soil/water.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Optimal Water Management:**
    *   Ensure adequate and consistent irrigation, especially during hot and dry periods, to prevent water stress.
    *   Avoid waterlogging, which can also damage roots and lead to leaf symptoms.
    *   Use drip irrigation for efficient water delivery.
*   **Shade and Canopy Management:**
    *   Provide partial shade to the orchard during intense summer heat, especially for young plants.
    *   Maintain a healthy canopy through proper pruning to provide natural shade to the leaves and fruits.
*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Ensure balanced fertilization. Deficiencies of nutrients like Potassium can make plants more susceptible to heat stress.
    *   Foliar application of **Potassium nitrate** at 5-10 g/L water can help improve the plant's tolerance to heat and water stress by aiding in osmoregulation.
    *   Avoid excessive application of nitrogen, which can lead to lush, tender growth more susceptible to sunscald.
*   **Soil Health:**
    *   Mulching helps regulate soil temperature and moisture, reducing stress on roots.
    *   Improve soil organic matter content to enhance water retention and nutrient availability.

### 3. Hardness in Fruit (Poor Fruit Development, Reduced Juice Content)

Hardness in fruit, often accompanied by small size and reduced juice content, is typically a result of insufficient water supply during critical fruit development stages, nutrient deficiencies (especially Potassium and Phosphorus), high temperatures, or over-cropping.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Consistent Water Management:**
    *   Provide adequate and consistent irrigation throughout the fruit development and ripening stages. Water stress is a major cause of small, hard fruits with poor juice content.
    *   Drip irrigation is highly recommended for precise water delivery.
*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Potassium:** Crucial for fruit size, sweetness, and juice accumulation. Apply **Potassium nitrate** at 5-10 g/L water as a foliar spray during fruit development, or through fertigation.
    *   **Phosphorus:** Essential for energy transfer and overall fruit development. Apply **Monoammonium phosphate** or **Monopotassium phosphate** at 5-10 g/L water as a foliar spray, especially during flowering and early fruit set.
    *   **Calcium:** While primarily for fruit integrity, adequate Calcium also contributes to overall fruit health. Apply **Calcium nitrate** at 5-10 g/L water as a foliar spray.
*   **Fruit Thinning:**
    *   Thinning excess fruits early in the season allows the remaining fruits to develop to their optimal size and quality, preventing competition for resources and reducing fruit hardness.
*   **Temperature Management:**
    *   Protect fruits from extreme high temperatures, which can lead to premature ripening and reduced juice accumulation. Partial shading can be beneficial.
*   **Plant Growth Regulators:**
    *   Foliar application of **Gibberellic acid** at 10-25 mg/L (ppm) during early fruit development can promote cell elongation and increase fruit size, potentially reducing hardness.

Always remember to conduct soil and water tests to determine specific nutrient requirements and adjust recommendations accordingly. For any chemical application, strictly follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety guidelines.
