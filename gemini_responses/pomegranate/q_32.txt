Dear Farmer,

The "drying up" of branches, leaves, fruits, and flowers in Pomegranate is a serious symptom that can be caused by various factors, including diseases, pests, and physiological stresses. A careful diagnosis is essential to implement effective management strategies. As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, I recommend the following approaches based on common issues observed in Haryana:

### I. Diseases

**1. Bacterial Blight (*Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. punicae*)**
This is one of the most devastating diseases of Pomegranate in Haryana, causing severe drying.
*   **Symptoms:** Initially, small, irregular, water-soaked spots appear on leaves, twigs, flowers, and fruits. These spots enlarge, turn dark brown to black, and can lead to defoliation, twig dieback, flower drop, and fruit cracking/rotting, ultimately causing extensive drying of affected parts. Cankers may form on stems and branches.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Sanitation:** Prune and destroy all infected plant parts (leaves, twigs, fruits) immediately. Burn the debris to prevent further spread.
    *   **Pruning:** Remove affected branches well below the visible symptoms, ensuring clean cuts. Disinfect pruning tools with a 1% sodium hypochlorite solution after each cut.
    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   Spray with a combination of **Streptomycin sulphate + Tetracycline hydrochloride** at 0.5 g/L of water.
        *   Alternatively, spray with **Copper oxychloride** at 3 g/L of water.
        *   Rotate these chemicals to prevent resistance development. Start spraying preventively during monsoon and continue at 10-15 day intervals if the disease is prevalent.

**2. Fungal Dieback / Wilt (e.g., *Botryosphaeria*, *Fusarium*)**
These fungi can cause progressive drying of branches and sometimes the entire plant.
*   **Symptoms:** Branches start drying from the tip downwards, leaves wilt and turn brown, and eventually the entire branch or plant may die. A cross-section of the affected stem may show vascular discoloration.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Pruning:** Remove all dried and diseased branches by cutting well into the healthy wood.
    *   **Pruning Cut Protection:** Immediately after pruning, paste the cut ends with a solution of **Carbendazim** (2 g/L) or **Copper oxychloride** (3 g/L) mixed with water to form a thick paste.
    *   **Foliar Spray/Drenching:**
        *   Spray the plants with **Carbendazim** at 1 g/L of water or **Propiconazole** at 1 ml/L of water.
        *   In case of suspected root/collar rot leading to wilt, drench the soil around the base of the plant with **Carbendazim** at 2 g/L of water.

### II. Pests

**1. Stem Borers (e.g., *Zeuzera coffeae*, *Indarbela quadrinotata*)**
These pests bore into the branches, disrupting nutrient and water flow, leading to drying.
*   **Symptoms:** Presence of boreholes on branches, accumulation of frass (excreta and wood powder) near the holes, and wilting/drying of the affected branch above the point of infestation.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Mechanical Removal:** Insert a flexible wire into the boreholes to kill the larvae.
    *   **Chemical Injection:** Inject a solution of **Chlorpyrifos** (2 ml/L of water) into the boreholes using a syringe and then plug the holes with mud or cotton.
    *   For bark-eating caterpillars (*Indarbela quadrinotata*), remove the silken webs and frass, then swab the affected bark area with a solution of **Chlorpyrifos** (2.5 ml/L of water).

### III. Physiological / Environmental Factors

**1. Water Stress (Drought or Waterlogging)**
Both insufficient and excessive water can lead to drying symptoms.
*   **Drought:** Lack of water causes leaves to wilt, turn yellow/brown, and eventually dry and drop. Branches may also dry back.
*   **Waterlogging:** Excessive water suffocates roots, leading to root rot, nutrient uptake issues, and similar drying symptoms as drought.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Irrigation:** Maintain optimal soil moisture. Irrigate regularly, especially during dry periods and fruit development stages. Use drip irrigation for efficient water use.
    *   **Drainage:** Ensure good drainage in the orchard to prevent water stagnation, especially during monsoon.

**2. Nutrient Deficiencies**
Severe deficiencies of certain nutrients can lead to poor plant health and drying symptoms.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Soil Testing:** Conduct regular soil tests to determine nutrient status.
    *   **Balanced Fertilization:** Apply fertilizers based on soil test recommendations to ensure balanced nutrition.

**3. Root Damage**
Mechanical damage to roots during intercultural operations or damage by nematodes can impair water and nutrient uptake, leading to drying.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Careful Cultivation:** Avoid deep cultivation near the plant base.
    *   **Nematode Management:** If nematodes are a problem, use appropriate nematicides or cultural practices (e.g., marigold intercropping, resistant rootstocks if available).

### General Management Practices:

*   **Orchard Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy fallen leaves, fruits, and pruned material to reduce inoculum sources for diseases and pest habitats.
*   **Proper Pruning:** Prune plants annually to remove dead, diseased, or weak branches, ensuring good air circulation within the canopy. Always disinfect pruning tools.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide adequate and balanced nutrients to maintain plant vigor and resistance to stress.
*   **Regular Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your orchard for early signs of diseases or pests to allow for timely intervention.

It is crucial to accurately identify the primary cause of drying up in your pomegranate orchard. If you are unsure, please collect samples of affected plant parts and consult with the plant pathology or entomology experts at HAU, Hisar, for a precise diagnosis.
