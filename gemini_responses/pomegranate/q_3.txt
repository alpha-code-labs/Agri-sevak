Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I understand your concern regarding the various rot types in Pomegranate. These diseases can significantly impact plant health and yield. It's important to note that many of these rots share common causal pathogens and management strategies, especially those affecting the root and basal stem regions.

Here's a comprehensive approach to control all mentioned rot types in Pomegranate, based on scientific recommendations and CIBRC approved chemicals for Haryana:

**General Preventative Measures (Applicable to all Rot Types):**

1.  **Site Selection and Soil Management:**
    *   Ensure well-drained soil. Avoid heavy clay soils prone to waterlogging.
    *   Improve soil structure by incorporating organic matter (e.g., well-decomposed farmyard manure).
    *   Maintain proper soil pH (6.0-7.0) for optimal plant health.
    *   Consider raised beds in areas with poor drainage.
2.  **Irrigation Management:**
    *   Avoid over-irrigation, especially during cooler periods.
    *   Use drip irrigation to deliver water directly to the root zone, minimizing wetting of the collar region and foliage.
    *   Irrigate in the morning to allow foliage and soil surface to dry.
3.  **Planting Material:**
    *   Use healthy, disease-free planting material (cuttings or seedlings) from certified nurseries.
    *   Inspect planting material thoroughly for any signs of disease before planting.
4.  **Orchard Sanitation:**
    *   Regularly remove and destroy infected plant parts (leaves, fruits, branches, entire plants if severely affected) to reduce inoculum sources.
    *   Keep the orchard floor clean of weeds, which can harbor pathogens and impede air circulation.
5.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Provide balanced nutrition to enhance plant vigor and resistance to diseases. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can promote lush, susceptible growth.
6.  **Pruning:**
    *   Prune trees to ensure good air circulation within the canopy, reducing humidity and fungal growth.
    *   Sanitize pruning tools with a 1% sodium hypochlorite solution or 70% alcohol between trees to prevent disease spread.
7.  **Soil Solarization:**
    *   In areas with high disease incidence, soil solarization during hot summer months can reduce soil-borne pathogen populations.

**Specific Control Measures for Rot Types:**

Many of the rots (Root, Stem, Foot, Collar, Crown, Neck, Seed, and Seedling rot) are primarily caused by soil-borne fungi and oomycetes such as *Phytophthora*, *Pythium*, *Fusarium*, and *Rhizoctonia*. Neck rot is generally considered part of the collar/crown rot complex, affecting the plant at or just above the soil line. Black rot can refer to a specific fruit disease or a severe symptom of other rots.

### A. For Soil-borne Rots (Root, Stem, Foot, Collar, Crown, Neck, Seed, and Seedling Rot):

These rots often manifest as wilting, yellowing, stunted growth, and eventual death of the plant, with characteristic discoloration and decay at the affected parts.

1.  **Seed Treatment (for Seed Rot and Seedling Rot prevention):**
    *   Treat seeds before sowing to protect against soil-borne pathogens.
    *   **Carbendazim 50% WP:** 2-3 g/kg seed
    *   **Thiram 75% WS:** 2.5-3 g/kg seed
    *   **Captan 50% WP:** 2.5 g/kg seed
    *   **Metalaxyl 35% WS:** 6 g/kg seed (especially effective against oomycetes like *Pythium*)

2.  **Soil Drenching / Drip Application (for Root, Stem, Foot, Collar, Crown, Neck Rots):**
    *   Apply fungicides to the soil around the base of the affected plants or as a preventative measure.
    *   **Metalaxyl 8% + Mancozeb 64% WP:** 2.5 kg/acre (mixed in sufficient water for drenching) or 2.5-3 g/L water for individual plant drenching.
    *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride 72.2% SL:** 2-3 ml/L water for drenching.
    *   **Fosetyl-aluminium 80% WP:** 2.5-3 g/L water for drenching.
    *   **Potassium phosphonate (e.g., 40% SL):** 3-5 ml/L water for drenching.
    *   **Carbendazim 50% WP:** 1-2 g/L water for drenching.
    *   **Thiophanate-methyl 70% WP:** 1-1.5 g/L water for drenching.
    *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:** 0.5-1 ml/L water for drenching.

3.  **Paste Application (for Stem, Foot, Collar, Crown, Neck Rots):**
    *   For visible lesions at the collar or stem base, scrape off infected tissue and apply a fungicidal paste.
    *   **Copper oxychloride 50% WP:** Mix 50 g in 100 ml water to make a thick paste.
    *   **Carbendazim 50% WP:** Mix 20-30 g in 100 ml water to make a thick paste.

### B. For Fruit Rots (including Black Rot of Fruit):

Fruit rots are caused by various fungi like *Alternaria*, *Aspergillus*, *Colletotrichum*, *Botrytis*, and *Phytophthora*. Black rot of fruit is often associated with *Alternaria alternata* or *Aspergillus niger*.

1.  **Foliar Sprays:**
    *   Initiate sprays at flowering or early fruit set and continue at regular intervals (10-15 days) depending on disease pressure and weather conditions.
    *   **Mancozeb 75% WP:** 2-2.5 g/L water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:** 0.5-1 ml/L water.
    *   **Difenoconazole 25% EC:** 0.5 ml/L water.
    *   **Propiconazole 25% EC:** 0.5 ml/L water.
    *   **Tebuconazole 25.9% EC:** 0.75 ml/L water.
    *   **Copper oxychloride 50% WP:** 2.5-3 g/L water (can also help with bacterial issues).
    *   **Fosetyl-aluminium 80% WP:** 2.5-3 g/L water (effective against *Phytophthora* fruit rot).

2.  **Post-Harvest Management:**
    *   Handle fruits carefully to avoid injuries, which can be entry points for pathogens.
    *   Store fruits in cool, well-ventilated conditions.

**Integrated Disease Management (IDM):**

For effective and sustainable control, it is crucial to adopt an Integrated Disease Management approach, combining cultural practices, biological control (e.g., *Trichoderma viride* or *Pseudomonas fluorescens* as soil amendments or seed treatment), and judicious use of CIBRC approved chemical fungicides. Always rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

Always read and follow the instructions on the product label for specific dosages, application methods, and safety precautions.
