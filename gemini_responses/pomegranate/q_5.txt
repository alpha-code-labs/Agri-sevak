Namaste, Kisan Bhaiyon! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I am here to provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing common issues in your pomegranate orchards.

Here's how you can control Scab, Canker, Gummosis, and Lichen in Pomegranate:

### 1. Pomegranate Scab (Caused by *Sphaceloma punicae* or *Elsinoë punicae*)

**Symptoms:** This disease causes characteristic raised, corky, dark brown spots on fruits, leaves, and stems. Severe infection can lead to fruit cracking and reduced market value.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Prune infected branches and twigs during dormancy and burn them to reduce inoculum.
    *   Ensure proper spacing between trees for good air circulation.
    *   Avoid overhead irrigation, especially during fruit development.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Preventive Sprays (start at flowering and repeat at 15-20 day intervals):**
        *   **Copper oxychloride** at 2.5-3.0 g/L of water.
        *   **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Systemic Sprays (for existing infections or in rotation with protectants):**
        *   **Difenoconazole** at 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Propiconazole** at 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

### 2. Pomegranate Canker (Often associated with Bacterial Blight caused by *Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. punicae*)

**Symptoms:** Cankers appear as sunken, dark brown to black lesions on stems, branches, and sometimes on the main trunk. These cankers can girdle the stem, leading to dieback of branches above the infected area.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Use disease-free planting material.
    *   Prune out all infected branches and twigs immediately, cutting well below the visible canker. Disinfect pruning tools with 70% alcohol or a 10% bleach solution between cuts. Burn the pruned material.
    *   Avoid any injury to the bark, as wounds serve as entry points for pathogens.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Copper oxychloride** at 3.0 g/L of water, applied as a thorough spray, especially after pruning or during periods conducive to disease development.
    *   **Streptomycin sulfate + Tetracycline hydrochloride** (combination product) at 0.5 g/L of water, applied as a foliar spray. This is particularly effective against bacterial cankers.
    *   For severe cankers on the main stem, scrape the infected bark gently and paint the area with a paste of **Copper oxychloride** (50 g in 100 ml water).

### 3. Gummosis

**Symptoms:** Gummosis is the exudation of gum (a sticky, amber-colored substance) from the bark of the tree. It is a symptom, not a disease itself, and can be caused by various factors including fungal infections (e.g., *Phytophthora* species, *Botryosphaeria* species), bacterial infections, insect borers, mechanical injury, or environmental stress (e.g., waterlogging, drought).

**Control Measures:**

*   **Identify and Address the Underlying Cause:**
    *   **Improve Drainage:** If waterlogging is an issue, improve soil drainage around the trees.
    *   **Avoid Injury:** Protect trees from mechanical injuries during cultivation or harvesting.
    *   **Manage Pests:** If insect borers are present, implement appropriate pest control measures.
    *   **Fungal Infections (e.g., *Phytophthora*):**
        *   **Fosetyl-aluminium** at 2.5 g/L of water, applied as a foliar spray or soil drench around the base of the tree.
        *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride** at 2.5 ml/L of water, applied as a soil drench.
        *   **Copper oxychloride** at 3.0 g/L of water, applied as a drench around the base of the tree or painted on affected trunk areas after scraping off loose bark.
    *   **Bacterial Infections:** Refer to the control measures for Canker (Bacterial Blight) above.
*   **Surgical Removal:** Carefully scrape away the gum and discolored bark until healthy tissue is exposed. Disinfect the wound with a solution of **Copper oxychloride** (3 g/L) and then paint with Bordeaux paste or a wound dressing.

### 4. Lichen

**Symptoms:** Lichens appear as crusty, leafy, or bushy growths of various colors (grey, green, yellow, orange) on the bark of the tree trunk and branches.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Nature of Lichens:** Lichens are symbiotic organisms (a fungus and an alga) that grow on the surface of the bark. They are **not parasitic** and do not directly harm the pomegranate tree by drawing nutrients from it. They are generally considered harmless epiphytes. Their presence often indicates good air quality and can be more prevalent on older, less vigorous trees or in shaded, humid conditions.
*   **When to Consider Removal:** Removal is usually not necessary. However, if they are aesthetically undesirable, or if they are thought to harbor pests (though this is rare), you may consider removal.
*   **Removal Methods:**
    *   **Physical Removal:** Gently scrub the bark with a stiff brush (not wire) during the dormant season. Be careful not to damage the bark.
    *   **Mild Chemical Application:** A very mild spray of **Copper oxychloride** at 2.0 g/L of water during the dormant season can help to dislodge lichens. Alternatively, a lime wash (calcium hydroxide) can be applied to the trunk and main branches, which can also help in dislodging lichens over time.

Always ensure proper safety precautions, including wearing gloves and protective clothing, when handling any chemicals. Follow the instructions on the product label for dosage and application timing. For specific recommendations tailored to your farm, please consult with your local agricultural extension officer.
