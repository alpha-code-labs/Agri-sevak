As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified management strategies for growth issues in Pomegranate in Haryana.

**General Principle:** Always conduct a soil test to understand nutrient availability and pH before applying any fertilizers. This forms the basis for precise nutrient management.

### 1. Slow Growth

Slow growth can be attributed to various factors including nutrient deficiencies, water stress, poor soil health, or root issues.

*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Based on soil test results, apply a balanced fertilizer. Ensure adequate supply of Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K).
    *   For micronutrient deficiencies, foliar application can provide quick relief.
        *   **Zinc sulfate** (0.5% solution, i.e., 5 g/L)
        *   **Ferrous sulfate** (0.5% solution, i.e., 5 g/L)
        *   **Manganese sulfate** (0.5% solution, i.e., 5 g/L)
        *   **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (0.1% solution, i.e., 1 g/L)
*   **Water Management:** Ensure optimal irrigation, avoiding both water stress and waterlogging.
*   **Soil Health:** Incorporate organic matter (e.g., well-decomposed farmyard manure) to improve soil structure and water retention. Mulching around the base of the plants can help conserve moisture and regulate soil temperature.
*   **Pruning:** Light pruning to remove dead, diseased, or weak branches can redirect energy to healthy growth.

### 2. Yellow Growth (Chlorosis)

Yellowing of leaves (chlorosis) is often a symptom of nutrient deficiency, particularly iron, zinc, or manganese, especially in high pH soils common in Haryana.

*   **Identify Deficiency:** Observe the pattern of yellowing (e.g., interveinal chlorosis on young leaves often indicates iron deficiency). A leaf tissue analysis can confirm specific deficiencies.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Iron Deficiency:**
        *   Foliar spray of **Ferrous sulfate** (0.5% solution, i.e., 5 g/L) or **Iron chelate (Fe-EDTA)** (0.1-0.2% solution, i.e., 1-2 g/L). Repeat at 10-15 day intervals if needed.
    *   **Zinc Deficiency:**
        *   Foliar spray of **Zinc sulfate** (0.5% solution, i.e., 5 g/L) or **Zinc chelate (Zn-EDTA)** (0.1-0.2% solution, i.e., 1-2 g/L).
    *   **Manganese Deficiency:**
        *   Foliar spray of **Manganese sulfate** (0.5% solution, i.e., 5 g/L).
    *   **Nitrogen Deficiency (general yellowing of older leaves):**
        *   Foliar spray of **Urea** (1-2% solution, i.e., 10-20 g/L).
*   **Soil pH Management:** In severe cases of high soil pH, consider soil amendments like gypsum (for sodic soils) or elemental sulfur (to lower pH, but this is a slow process and needs careful monitoring).

### 3. Excessive Height (Leggy Growth)

Excessive vegetative growth or leggy plants can reduce fruit production and make management difficult.

*   **Pruning:** Regular training and pruning are crucial.
    *   **Heading back cuts:** Remove the terminal portion of branches to encourage lateral branching and maintain desired height.
    *   **Thinning cuts:** Remove entire branches to improve light penetration and air circulation.
*   **Nutrient Balance:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which promotes vegetative growth. Ensure a balanced supply of Phosphorus and Potassium.
*   **Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs):**
    *   **Paclobutrazol (23% SC formulation):** Apply 2.2-4.3 ml per tree as a soil drench, diluted in sufficient water, usually after fruit harvest or before flowering flush. Adjust dose based on tree age and vigor.
    *   **Chlormequat chloride (50% SL formulation):** Apply 1-2 ml/L of water as a foliar spray during active vegetative growth to reduce internode length and promote compactness.

### 4. Excessive Flowering (and poor fruit set)

While flowering is desirable, excessive flowering without adequate fruit set can be unproductive and deplete plant resources.

*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Ensure adequate supply of Phosphorus and Potassium, which are crucial for flowering and fruiting.
    *   **Boron:** Critical for pollen viability and fruit set.
        *   Foliar spray of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (0.1% solution, i.e., 1 g/L) before flowering and at pea-size fruit stage.
*   **Water Management:** Avoid water stress during flowering and fruit development stages.
*   **Pruning:** In cases of extremely heavy flowering on young trees, light flower thinning can be considered to conserve energy for fruit development, but generally, the plant self-thins. Focus on maintaining a healthy canopy structure.
*   **Pollination:** Ensure adequate pollinator activity.
*   **Avoid Stress:** Minimize any environmental or physiological stress on the plants during critical reproductive stages.
