As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I am providing scientifically verified advice for the control of fungal diseases in Pomegranate, specifically for the conditions prevalent in Haryana.

It is crucial to correctly identify the disease as control measures differ significantly between fungal and bacterial pathogens.

Here's how to control the listed conditions:

### **1. Alternaria (Alternaria Fruit Spot/Blight)**
This is a significant fungal disease affecting leaves, stems, and fruits, causing dark, sunken spots.
*   **Preventive Sprays (start at flowering/fruit set):**
    *   **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Chlorothalonil** at 2 g/L of water.
*   **Curative/Systemic Sprays (if disease is observed):**
    *   **Difenoconazole** at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Propiconazole** at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5-1 ml/L or g/L of water (depending on formulation).
    *   **Tebuconazole** at 0.75 ml/L of water.
*   **Rotation of fungicides** from different groups is essential to prevent resistance development.

### **2. Anthracnose (Colletotrichum gloeosporioides)**
This fungal disease causes dark, irregular spots on leaves, twigs, and fruits, leading to fruit rot and dieback.
*   **Preventive Sprays:**
    *   **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Copper Oxychloride** at 3 g/L of water.
*   **Curative/Systemic Sprays:**
    *   **Carbendazim** at 1 g/L of water.
    *   **Thiophanate Methyl** at 1 g/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5-1 ml/L or g/L of water.
    *   **Tebuconazole** at 0.75 ml/L of water.
*   Ensure good orchard sanitation by removing and destroying infected plant parts.

### **3. Blast (Bacterial Blight)**
This condition, commonly known as Bacterial Blight in Pomegranate, is caused by the bacterium *Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. punicae*, not a fungus. Therefore, it falls outside the scope of fungal disease control measures.

### **4. Blight (Fungal Blights)**
This is a general term for various fungal diseases causing rapid browning and death of plant tissues. Specific fungal blights like Alternaria blight or Cercospora blight affect Pomegranate.
*   Control measures are similar to those for Alternaria and Anthracnose.
*   **Preventive Sprays:**
    *   **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Chlorothalonil** at 2 g/L of water.
*   **Curative/Systemic Sprays:**
    *   **Difenoconazole** at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5-1 ml/L or g/L of water.
    *   **Tebuconazole** at 0.75 ml/L of water.

### **5. Brown Spot**
Brown spot on Pomegranate is often caused by fungal pathogens such as *Alternaria* or *Cercospora*.
*   Control measures are similar to those for Alternaria.
*   **Preventive Sprays:**
    *   **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Chlorothalonil** at 2 g/L of water.
*   **Curative/Systemic Sprays:**
    *   **Difenoconazole** at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Propiconazole** at 0.5 ml/L of water.

### **6. Downy Mildew**
This is not known to be a significant disease of Pomegranate in Haryana.

### **7. Powdery Mildew (Erysiphe punicae / Podosphaera punicae)**
This fungal disease appears as white, powdery patches on leaves, stems, flowers, and fruits, leading to distortion and reduced fruit quality.
*   **Preventive/Curative Sprays:**
    *   **Wettable Sulphur** at 2-3 g/L of water (avoid spraying in very hot weather).
    *   **Hexaconazole** at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Myclobutanil** at 0.4 g/L of water.
    *   **Penconazole** at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Difenoconazole** at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5-1 ml/L or g/L of water.
*   Ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves.

### **8. Grey Mildew**
This is not a commonly recognized specific fungal disease of Pomegranate. If you are observing a greyish mould, it might be Grey Mould (*Botrytis cinerea*), which can affect fruits, especially under high humidity.
*   For general fungal fruit rots, fungicides like **Carbendazim** (1 g/L) or **Thiophanate Methyl** (1 g/L) can be used, along with good sanitation and improved air circulation.

**General Recommendations for Fungal Disease Management:**
*   **Orchard Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy fallen leaves, fruits, and infected branches.
*   **Pruning:** Ensure proper pruning to improve air circulation within the canopy, reducing humidity.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Maintain balanced nutrition to enhance plant vigour and resistance.
*   **Water Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation late in the day, which can prolong leaf wetness.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available and suitable for the region, consider planting disease-tolerant varieties.
*   **Spray Schedule:** Follow a regular spray schedule, especially during critical growth stages and periods of high humidity or rainfall. Always rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
*   **Adherence to Label Instructions:** Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the fungicide label for dosage, application method, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
