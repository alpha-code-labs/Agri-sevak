As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following fertilizer doses for Pomegranate cultivation in Haryana. Please note that these are general recommendations, and a **soil test is crucial** for precise nutrient management tailored to your specific field conditions.

**General NPK & Sulphur Recommendations for Pomegranate (per plant per year):**

*   **Young Plants (1-3 years):** Gradually increase the dose.
    *   **Year 1:** 200 g Nitrogen (N), 100 g Phosphorus (P2O5), 100 g Potassium (K2O)
    *   **Year 2:** 400 g Nitrogen (N), 200 g Phosphorus (P2O5), 200 g Potassium (K2O)
    *   **Year 3:** 600 g Nitrogen (N), 250 g Phosphorus (P2O5), 250 g Potassium (K2O)
*   **Mature Bearing Plants (4+ years):**
    *   **Nitrogen (N):** 600-700 g per plant
    *   **Phosphorus (P2O5):** 250-300 g per plant
    *   **Potassium (K2O):** 250-300 g per plant
    *   **Sulphur (S):** 20-40 kg per acre per year (applied as a broadcast or with P fertilizers)

**Recommended Fertilizer Doses (per acre per year for mature bearing trees, 4+ years):**

*   *Assuming a planting density of approximately 200 plants per acre (e.g., 5m x 4m spacing), the per acre requirement would be:*
    *   **Nitrogen (N):** 120-140 kg/acre
    *   **Phosphorus (P2O5):** 50-60 kg/acre
    *   **Potassium (K2O):** 50-60 kg/acre
    *   **Sulphur (S):** 20-40 kg/acre

Based on these requirements, here are the recommended doses of specific fertilizers:

*   **Urea (46% N):**
    *   **Dose:** 220-260 kg/acre.
    *   *Note:* This dose is adjusted assuming **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** is used for Phosphorus, which also contributes some Nitrogen. If **Single Superphosphate (SSP)** is used (which has no N), the **Urea** dose would be higher (260-300 kg/acre).

*   **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP) (18% N, 46% P2O5):**
    *   **Dose:** 110-130 kg/acre.
    *   *This will provide the required Phosphorus and a portion of the Nitrogen.*

*   **Single Superphosphate (SSP) (16% P2O5, 11% S):**
    *   **Dose:** 315-375 kg/acre.
    *   *This can be used as an alternative to **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** to meet Phosphorus and Sulphur requirements. If **Single Superphosphate (SSP)** is used, adjust **Urea** dose upwards as it provides no Nitrogen.*

*   **Muriate of Potash (60% K2O) (Potash):**
    *   **Dose:** 85-100 kg/acre.

*   **Elemental Sulphur (90% S) (Sulphur):**
    *   **Dose:** 25-45 kg/acre.
    *   *This is recommended if **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** is used. If **Single Superphosphate (SSP)** is used, additional Sulphur might not be required as **Single Superphosphate (SSP)** contains Sulphur.*

*   **Nano-Urea (Liquid) (4% N):**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml/L of water for foliar spray.
    *   *Apply 2-3 sprays during active vegetative growth and fruit development stages. Nano-Urea is a supplementary source and does not replace the full requirement of soil-applied **Urea**.*

*   **Nano-DAP (Liquid) (8% N, 16% P2O5):**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml/L of water for foliar spray.
    *   *Apply 2 sprays, one at pre-flowering and another at fruit development stage. Nano-DAP is a supplementary source and does not replace the full requirement of soil-applied Phosphorus fertilizers.*

*   **NPK Complex Fertilizers (e.g., 19:19:19, 10:26:26, 12:32:16):**
    *   These can be used to meet the NPK requirements. The specific dose will depend on the NPK ratio of the chosen fertilizer and the total nutrient requirement. Calculate the amount needed to meet the P2O5 or K2O requirement, then adjust **Urea** for any remaining Nitrogen deficit.

**Timing and Application Method:**

*   **Basal Application (Pre-flowering/After Pruning):** Apply all Phosphorus, Potassium, and Sulphur fertilizers along with half the Nitrogen dose. These should be broadcast or placed in a ring around the plant and incorporated into the soil.
*   **Top Dressing (Post-flowering/Fruit Set & Development):** Apply the remaining half of the Nitrogen in 1-2 split doses during fruit development.
*   **Foliar Sprays:** Nano-fertilizers should be applied as foliar sprays during critical growth stages.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Soil Testing:** Always conduct a soil test to determine the exact nutrient status of your field and adjust fertilizer doses accordingly.
*   **Micronutrients:** Pomegranate also requires micronutrients like Zinc, Boron, Iron, Manganese, and Copper. If soil tests indicate deficiencies, apply appropriate micronutrient formulations.
*   **Organic Matter:** Incorporating farmyard manure (FYM) or compost (20-30 kg/plant/year for mature trees) significantly improves soil health and nutrient use efficiency.
*   **Water Management:** Efficient irrigation (drip irrigation is highly recommended) ensures better nutrient uptake.
