Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I will provide scientifically verified advice for managing the mentioned conditions in Pomegranate cultivation in Haryana.

Here's how to control the specified pests:

**1. Grasshopper:**
Grasshoppers can cause defoliation by feeding on leaves and young shoots of pomegranate plants.
*   **Cultural Control:** For small infestations, hand-picking and destroying grasshoppers can be effective.
*   **Chemical Control:** In case of severe infestation, apply insecticides when nymphs are young.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC**: 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Malathion 50% EC**: 2 ml per litre of water.

**2. Painted bug:**
This is not known to affect Pomegranate. Painted bug is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops like mustard, cabbage, and radish.

**3. Red cotton bug:**
This is not known to affect Pomegranate. Red cotton bug is primarily a pest of cotton and other malvaceous plants.

**4. Black ants:**
Black ants are often secondary pests, attracted to the honeydew secreted by primary sucking pests like aphids, mealybugs, and scales. They also protect these honeydew-producing pests from natural enemies.
*   **Integrated Approach:** The most effective control for ants is to manage the primary sucking pests that produce honeydew.
*   **Direct Control (if ants are a nuisance or causing direct damage):**
    *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC**: 2.5 ml per litre of water. Apply as a drench around the base of the tree trunk or spray on ant trails and nests around the plant, avoiding direct contact with fruits.
    *   **Fipronil 0.3% GR**: 10-15 kg per acre. Apply as a soil application around the base of the affected plants, especially if ant nests are observed in the soil.

Always ensure proper safety measures, wear protective gear, and follow the instructions on the product label for dosage and application. For any further clarification, please contact your local agricultural extension office or HAU experts.
