As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an Integrated Weed Management (IWM) approach for effective and sustainable weed control in Pomegranate orchards. This involves a combination of cultural, mechanical, and chemical methods.

**General Recommendations for Herbicide Application in Pomegranate:**

*   **Directed Spray:** Always apply herbicides as a directed spray, avoiding contact with the trunk, branches, and foliage of the pomegranate plants. This is especially critical for young plants. Use protective shields if necessary.
*   **Soil Moisture:** Ensure adequate soil moisture for optimal efficacy of pre-emergence herbicides. For post-emergence herbicides, apply when weeds are actively growing.
*   **Water Volume:** Use sufficient water volume (typically 200-400 L/acre) to ensure thorough coverage of the weed foliage.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) and follow label instructions carefully.

Here are the scientifically verified recommendations for controlling the specified weeds in Pomegranate:

### Weed Control in Pomegranate

**1. Broadleaf Weeds (including Bathu and Congress grass) & Narrowleaf Weeds (including Phalaris minor):**

These weeds can be controlled using a combination of pre-emergence and post-emergence herbicides.

*   **Pre-emergence Herbicides (for broad spectrum control before weed emergence):**
    *   **Pendimethalin** (30% EC): Apply 3.3 - 5.0 L per acre in 200-400 L of water, immediately after planting or before weed emergence in established orchards, to moist soil.
    *   **Oxyfluorfen** (23.5% EC): Apply 1.0 - 2.0 L per acre in 200-400 L of water, before weed emergence to moist soil.

*   **Post-emergence Herbicides (Non-selective, for existing weeds):**
    *   **Glyphosate** (41% SL): Apply 2.5 - 5.0 L per acre in 200-400 L of water as a directed spray to actively growing weeds. Ensure no contact with pomegranate plants.
    *   **Paraquat dichloride** (24% SL): Apply 2.0 - 4.0 L per acre in 200-400 L of water as a directed spray to actively growing weeds. This is a contact herbicide, so thorough coverage of weeds is essential. Ensure no contact with pomegranate plants.

*   **Post-emergence Herbicides (Selective for Narrowleaf Weeds/Grasses, including Phalaris minor):**
    *   **Quizalofop-ethyl** (5% EC): Apply 1.0 - 2.0 L per acre in 200-400 L of water as a directed spray to actively growing grasses. This herbicide is generally safe for broadleaf crops like pomegranate.
    *   **Fenoxaprop-p-ethyl** (9% EC): Apply 0.5 - 1.0 L per acre in 200-400 L of water as a directed spray to actively growing grasses. This herbicide is also generally safe for broadleaf crops.

**2. Amarbail (Cuscuta):**

Amarbail is a parasitic weed that can be challenging to control.

*   **Cultural/Mechanical:** Manual removal of Amarbail before it flowers and sets seed is the most effective method. Remove any infested plant parts or weeds immediately.
*   **Chemical (Pre-emergence suppression):**
    *   **Pendimethalin** (30% EC) or **Oxyfluorfen** (23.5% EC) applied pre-emergence (as mentioned above) can offer some suppression of Amarbail seed germination.
*   **Chemical (Post-emergence):** There are no selective post-emergence herbicides that can control Amarbail once it has attached to the pomegranate plant without harming the crop. If Amarbail is infesting other weeds in the inter-row spaces, directed sprays of non-selective herbicides like **Glyphosate** or **Paraquat dichloride** can be used, ensuring no contact with the pomegranate plants.

**3. Orobanche:**

This is not known to affect Pomegranate.
