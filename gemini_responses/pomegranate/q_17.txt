Dear Farmer,

Incorporating organic manures is crucial for improving soil health, nutrient availability, and overall productivity of Pomegranate orchards in Haryana. Here are the recommended doses for Farmyard Manure (FYM), Vermicompost, and Sagarika:

*   **Farmyard Manure (FYM):**
    *   For established Pomegranate trees (3 years and older): **20-30 kg per plant per year.**
    *   For young Pomegranate trees (1-2 years old): **10-15 kg per plant per year.**
    *   **Application:** Apply the FYM in two split doses, typically before the monsoon (June-July) and after the monsoon (September-October). Spread it evenly around the root zone of the plant, keeping a small distance from the main stem, and incorporate it lightly into the soil.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   For established Pomegranate trees: **5-10 kg per plant per year.**
    *   For young Pomegranate trees: **2-5 kg per plant per year.**
    *   **Application:** Vermicompost can be applied in a similar manner to FYM, either in a single application or in two split doses, mixed into the soil around the root zone.

*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract-based Bio-stimulant):**
    *   **Sagarika** is a bio-stimulant that enhances nutrient uptake and plant growth, rather than a bulk manure. Its application methods are typically:
        *   **Foliar Spray:** **2-3 ml per litre of water.** Apply at critical growth stages such as pre-flowering, fruit set, and during fruit development. Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.
        *   **Soil Drench/Drip Application:** **500 ml to 1 litre per acre.** This can be mixed with irrigation water and applied to the root zone during active growth phases.

These recommendations are designed to provide a balanced supply of organic matter and nutrients, promoting healthy growth and fruit production in Pomegranate. Regular soil testing is advised to fine-tune nutrient management practices.
