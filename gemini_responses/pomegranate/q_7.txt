Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing diseases in Pomegranate.

Here's how to control Dieback, Twig blight, and address Tikka disease in Pomegranate:

### Control of Dieback and Twig Blight in Pomegranate

Dieback and Twig blight are significant fungal diseases in Pomegranate, often caused by pathogens like *Colletotrichum gloeosporioides*, *Botryosphaeria dothidea*, and *Phomopsis* species. These diseases lead to the drying and death of twigs and branches, potentially affecting the entire plant if not managed promptly.

**1. Cultural Management Practices:**

*   **Pruning:** Regularly inspect your orchard. As soon as symptoms of dieback (drying twigs, discoloured bark) are observed, prune the affected branches. Make the cut at least 15-20 cm below the visible symptoms into healthy wood.
*   **Sanitation:** Collect and immediately destroy all pruned material (burn or bury deeply) to prevent the spread of fungal spores.
*   **Wound Protection:** After pruning, especially for larger cuts, apply a protective fungicidal paste to the wound to prevent pathogen entry.
*   **Orchard Hygiene:** Maintain good orchard sanitation by removing fallen leaves, fruits, and debris that can harbour pathogens.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure balanced nutrition for the plants to enhance their natural resistance. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can lead to lush, susceptible growth.
*   **Water Management:** Avoid water stress (both deficit and excess) as stressed plants are more susceptible to disease.

**2. Chemical Management:**

*   **Fungicidal Paste for Pruning Cuts:**
    *   Prepare a paste using **Copper Oxychloride** (50% WP) at 50 grams per litre of water, or **Carbendazim** (50% WP) at 10 grams per litre of water. Apply this paste immediately after pruning to all cut surfaces.
*   **Foliar Sprays (Preventive and Curative):**
    *   **Pre-monsoon/Flowering Stage:** Apply a preventive spray of **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2.5 grams per litre of water, or **Copper Oxychloride** (50% WP) at 3 grams per litre of water.
    *   **Post-monsoon/Disease Appearance:** If symptoms appear, spray with systemic fungicides.
        *   **Carbendazim** (50% WP) at 1 gram per litre of water.
        *   **Propiconazole** (25% EC) at 0.5 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Thiophanate Methyl** (70% WP) at 1 gram per litre of water.
        *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC) at 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Rotation:** Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. For example, alternate between a contact fungicide like **Mancozeb** and a systemic fungicide like **Carbendazim** or **Propiconazole**.
    *   **Timing:** Ensure thorough coverage of the plant, especially twigs and branches. Repeat sprays at 10-15 day intervals if disease pressure is high, or as per product label recommendations.

### Tikka Disease in Pomegranate

This is not known to affect Pomegranate. "Tikka disease" is a specific term primarily used for the leaf spot disease of Groundnut (Peanut) caused by *Cercospora arachidicola* and *Cercosporidium personatum*. While Pomegranate can suffer from various leaf spot diseases caused by other fungi (e.g., *Alternaria* spp., *Cercospora* spp. different from those causing Tikka in groundnut) or bacteria, the specific disease known as "Tikka disease" does not affect Pomegranate.

For any general leaf spot issues in Pomegranate, please provide specific symptoms or images for accurate diagnosis and control recommendations.
