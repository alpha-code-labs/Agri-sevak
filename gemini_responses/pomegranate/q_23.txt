As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified seed and soil treatment processes for Pomegranate cultivation in Haryana:

It is important to note that commercial pomegranate cultivation primarily relies on vegetative propagation (cuttings) to ensure genetic purity and desired traits. Seed propagation is generally used for breeding purposes or rootstock development. However, if seeds are used, the following treatments are recommended.

### Recommended Seed Treatment Process for Pomegranate (if seeds are used)

Seed treatment aims to protect germinating seeds and young seedlings from soil-borne pathogens and to enhance early plant vigour.

1.  **Fungal Protection (First Step):**
    *   Mix the seeds thoroughly with one of the following fungicides:
        *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: 1-2 grams per kilogram of seed.
        *   **Thiram** 75% WS: 2-3 grams per kilogram of seed.
    *   Alternatively, for organic approaches or as a follow-up:
        *   **Trichoderma viride** 1% WP: 5-10 grams per kilogram of seed. (Apply after chemical fungicide treatment, or as a standalone biological treatment if no chemical fungicide is used).
    *   Allow the treated seeds to dry slightly in the shade before proceeding.

2.  **Bio-fertilizer Application (Second Step):**
    *   After fungicide treatment (if used), or as the primary treatment, coat the seeds with bio-fertilizers to enhance nutrient availability and plant growth:
        *   **Azotobacter chroococcum** 1% WP: 20 grams per kilogram of seed.
        *   **Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria (PSB)** 1% WP: 20 grams per kilogram of seed.
    *   Ensure uniform coating.
    *   Sow the treated seeds immediately after treatment for best results.

### Recommended Soil Treatment Process for Pomegranate

Soil treatment is crucial for managing soil-borne diseases, pests, and improving overall soil health before and during the cultivation of pomegranate.

#### A. Pre-planting Soil Preparation and Treatment

1.  **Organic Matter Incorporation:**
    *   Incorporate well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or quality compost at a rate of 10-15 tonnes per acre into the soil during land preparation. This improves soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability.

2.  **Soil Solarization (for pathogen and weed control):**
    *   During hot summer months (May-June), after preparing the field and ensuring adequate moisture, cover the soil surface with transparent polyethylene sheets (25-100 micron thickness) for 4-6 weeks. This process increases soil temperature, effectively reducing populations of soil-borne fungi, bacteria, nematodes, and weed seeds.

3.  **Biological Control for Soil-borne Diseases and Nematodes:**
    *   To manage soil-borne fungal diseases (e.g., Wilt, Root Rot, Collar Rot) and nematodes (e.g., Root-knot nematodes), apply beneficial microbial agents:
        *   **Trichoderma viride** 1% WP or **Trichoderma harzianum** 1% WP: 2.5 kilograms per acre.
        *   **Purpureocillium lilacinum** 1% WP (for nematode management): 2.5 kilograms per acre.
    *   **Process:** Mix the recommended quantity of these biological agents with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed FYM or compost. Broadcast this mixture evenly over the field and incorporate it into the soil before planting, or apply it in the planting pits/trenches.

4.  **Pre-emergent Herbicide Application (for weed control):**
    *   To control weeds effectively from the initial stages:
        *   **Pendimethalin** 30% EC: 1.0-1.5 litres per acre, applied to moist, weed-free soil within 3 days of planting or before weed emergence.
        *   **Oxyfluorfen** 23.5% EC: 0.5-1.0 litre per acre, applied to weed-free soil before planting or transplanting.
    *   **Process:** Ensure uniform spray coverage on the soil surface.

#### B. Post-planting / During Cultivation Soil Treatment (as needed)

1.  **Management of Soil-borne Fungal Diseases (e.g., Wilt, Root Rot, Collar Rot):**
    *   If symptoms of soil-borne fungal diseases appear, or as a preventive measure in disease-prone areas, drench the soil around the base of the plants:
        *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: 1-2 grams per litre of water.
        *   **Propiconazole** 25% EC: 1 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Copper oxychloride** 50% WP: 2-3 grams per litre of water.
    *   **Process:** Prepare the solution and drench 2-5 litres (depending on plant size) around the base of each plant, ensuring the solution penetrates the root zone. Repeat as per disease severity and product label recommendations.

2.  **Nematode Management (for established plants):**
    *   For managing nematode populations around established plants, continue with biological applications:
        *   **Purpureocillium lilacinum** 1% WP: 2.5 kilograms per acre, mixed with 50-100 kg of FYM/compost, and applied in the root zone.
    *   **Chemical Nematicides:** The use of chemical nematicides is highly regulated. For severe infestations, consult with HAU experts for specific, CIBRC-approved chemical recommendations suitable for pomegranate in Haryana, as options are limited and require careful application.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always conduct a soil test before planting to understand nutrient status and pH, which guides further soil amendments.
*   Follow all safety precautions and label instructions when handling and applying any chemical or biological product.
*   For specific local conditions and pest/disease outbreaks, always consult with your nearest Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or HAU extension specialist for tailored advice.
