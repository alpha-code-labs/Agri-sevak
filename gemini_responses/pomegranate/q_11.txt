As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling beetles, weevils, and sawflies in Pomegranate in Haryana.

### Control Measures for Beetles in Pomegranate

Beetles can cause damage to pomegranate plants, primarily through their larval stages (grubs) feeding on roots or adults/larvae boring into stems and branches.

**1. Shot Hole Borer (Xyleborus fornicatus):**
These are small beetles that bore into the main stem and branches, leading to wilting, dieback, and reduced fruit production. Look for small bore holes and frass (sawdust-like material) on affected parts.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Regularly inspect trees for signs of infestation, especially during dry periods.
    *   Prune and immediately destroy (burn or bury deep) all infested branches showing bore holes and wilting. Ensure pruning cuts are clean.
    *   Maintain tree vigour through balanced nutrition and proper irrigation to help trees withstand minor infestations.
    *   Avoid mechanical injuries to the bark, as these can attract borers.
*   **Chemical Control (for severe infestations):**
    *   **For trunk/branch application:** Swab the affected trunk and branches with a solution of **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 2.5 ml/L of water. Repeat as necessary, especially during peak emergence periods.
    *   **For systemic action:** Apply a soil drench of **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL at 0.5-1 ml/L of water (or 100-200 ml per acre, depending on tree size and age, diluted in sufficient water) around the root zone. This provides systemic protection.

**2. White Grubs (larvae of various scarab beetles):**
White grubs are soil-dwelling larvae that feed on the roots of pomegranate plants, leading to stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, and wilting. Adult beetles may feed on foliage, but root damage by grubs is more significant.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Deep ploughing during summer exposes grubs and pupae to predators and scorching sun, reducing their population.
    *   Collect and destroy adult beetles during their emergence, typically after the first monsoon rains, by shaking them off trees in the early morning.
    *   Use light traps to attract and kill adult beetles.
*   **Chemical Control (for soil application):**
    *   **For soil drench:** Apply **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 4 L/acre, diluted in sufficient water, as a soil drench around the root zone of affected plants.
    *   **For granular application:** Incorporate **Fipronil** 0.3% GR at 10-15 kg/acre into the soil around the base of the plants before planting or during early growth stages.

### Weevils

Specific weevil pests (Curculionidae) causing significant damage to pomegranate are not commonly reported as primary pests in Haryana. Therefore, specific control measures are not typically recommended for this crop in our region.

### Sawflies

This is not known to affect Pomegranate.
