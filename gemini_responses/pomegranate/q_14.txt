Dear Farmer,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding soil pests in your pomegranate orchard. Both termites and root-knot nematodes can cause significant damage to pomegranate plants, affecting their growth, yield, and overall health. Here's scientifically verified advice for their control:

### 1. Control of Termites in Pomegranate

Termites can damage the root system and collar region of pomegranate plants, leading to wilting and eventual death. Effective control measures include:

*   **Pre-planting Treatment:**
    *   Before planting, treat the soil in the pits or trenches with an insecticide solution.
    *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC**: Apply at 2.5 ml per liter of water, drenching the planting pit thoroughly.
*   **Post-planting Treatment (for existing orchards):**
    *   If termite mounds are observed in or around the orchard, destroy them and drench the area.
    *   For active infestation on plants, drench the soil around the base of the affected plants (up to 15-20 cm deep) with an insecticide solution.
    *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC**: Apply at 2.5 ml per liter of water, drenching the soil around the plant base.
    *   **Fipronil 0.3% GR**: Apply 10-15 kg per acre by broadcasting and mixing into the soil, or apply around the base of individual plants.

### 2. Control of Nematodes (Root-knot) in Pomegranate

Root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.) are microscopic worms that infect plant roots, causing galls or knots, leading to stunted growth, nutrient deficiency symptoms, and reduced yield.

*   **Cultural and Biological Control (Integrated Approach):**
    *   **Soil Solarization:** In summer, cover moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks to raise soil temperature and kill nematodes.
    *   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM), neem cake (200-400 kg/acre), or other organic matter into the soil. This improves soil health and promotes beneficial microorganisms that suppress nematodes.
    *   **Biological Nematicides:**
        *   **Purpureocillium lilacinum (formerly Paecilomyces lilacinus)**: Apply 2.5-5 kg per acre (carrier-based formulation) or 2.5-5 liters per acre (liquid formulation) by mixing with FYM and applying to the soil around the root zone, or through drip irrigation.
        *   **Trichoderma harzianum**: Apply 2.5-5 kg per acre (carrier-based formulation) or 2.5-5 liters per acre (liquid formulation) similarly. These fungi parasitize nematode eggs and juveniles.
*   **Chemical Control (for severe infestations):**
    *   **Fluensulfone 2% GR**: Apply 20-30 kg per acre by broadcasting and mixing into the soil, or apply around the base of individual plants. This should be done at the time of planting or when nematode populations are high.
    *   **Thionazin 10% GR**: Apply 10-15 kg per acre by broadcasting and mixing into the soil, or apply around the base of individual plants.

### Important Considerations:

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label carefully, including dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during application.
*   Rotate chemical nematicides with biological options to prevent resistance development and promote soil health.
*   Regularly monitor your orchard for signs of pest infestation to ensure timely intervention.
*   Maintain good orchard hygiene and remove any diseased or infested plant material.
