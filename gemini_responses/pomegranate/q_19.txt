Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice on addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies in Pomegranate for the Haryana region.

It is crucial to emphasize that a proper soil test is the most accurate way to determine specific nutrient deficiencies and the exact quantities required. The recommendations below are general guidelines for bearing Pomegranate trees and should be adjusted based on soil test results and the specific growth stage of your plants.

### Addressing Macro-nutrient Deficiencies in Pomegranate

**1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency:**
Nitrogen deficiency typically manifests as general yellowing (chlorosis) of older leaves, stunted growth, and reduced fruit set and size.

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply nitrogen in split doses throughout the growing season, especially during vegetative growth and fruit development.
    *   Common sources include:
        *   **Urea** (46% N): 200-300 kg/acre per year, applied in 3-4 split doses.
        *   **Ammonium Sulphate** (20.5% N): 400-600 kg/acre per year, applied in split doses, especially beneficial in alkaline soils.
        *   **Calcium Nitrate** (15.5% N, 18.8% Ca): 300-500 kg/acre per year, applied in split doses, also provides calcium.
*   **Foliar Application (for quick correction or supplementary feeding):**
    *   Spray a 1-2% solution of **Urea** (10-20 g/L of water) during active growth phases. Repeat every 15-20 days if needed. Avoid spraying during flowering.

**2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency:**
Phosphorus deficiency can lead to stunted growth, dark green or purplish discoloration of older leaves, poor root development, and reduced flowering and fruit set.

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Phosphorus is generally applied as a basal dose before planting or during the dormant season for established trees, as it is less mobile in the soil.
    *   Common sources include:
        *   **Single Superphosphate** (SSP, 16% P2O5): 300-500 kg/acre per year.
        *   **Di-ammonium Phosphate** (DAP, 46% P2O5, 18% N): 100-200 kg/acre per year. (Note: DAP also provides nitrogen, so adjust N application accordingly).
*   **Foliar Application:**
    *   Foliar application of phosphorus is less common for correcting severe deficiencies but can be used as a supplement.
    *   Use a water-soluble phosphorus fertilizer like **Monoammonium Phosphate** (MAP, 12% N, 61% P2O5) at 5-10 g/L of water.

**3. Potassium (K) Deficiency (Potash Deficiency):**
Potassium deficiency symptoms include yellowing and browning (scorching) of leaf margins, especially on older leaves, poor fruit development, reduced fruit size, poor color, and lower sugar content.

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Potassium is typically applied in split doses, especially during fruit development and maturation stages.
    *   Common sources include:
        *   **Muriate of Potash** (Potassium Chloride, 60% K2O): 150-250 kg/acre per year, applied in 2-3 split doses.
        *   **Sulphate of Potash** (Potassium Sulphate, 50% K2O, 17.5% S): 180-300 kg/acre per year, applied in 2-3 split doses. This is preferred in soils where chloride sensitivity is a concern or sulfur is also deficient.
*   **Foliar Application (for quick correction or supplementary feeding):**
    *   Spray a 1-2% solution of **Potassium Nitrate** (13% N, 45% K2O) (10-20 g/L of water) or **Sulphate of Potash** (10-20 g/L of water) during fruit development. Repeat every 15-20 days if needed.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Soil Testing:** Always conduct a soil test every 2-3 years to get precise recommendations for your specific field conditions.
*   **Timing:** Apply fertilizers at appropriate growth stages to maximize uptake and efficiency.
*   **Irrigation:** Ensure adequate and consistent irrigation, especially with drip irrigation, for efficient nutrient uptake.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** While addressing specific deficiencies, ensure overall balanced nutrition to prevent other nutrient imbalances.
