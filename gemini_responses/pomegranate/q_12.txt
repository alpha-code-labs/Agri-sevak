Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding Scale insects and Mealybugs in Pomegranate. Both these pests can cause significant damage by sucking sap, leading to reduced plant vigour, poor fruit quality, and sooty mold development. Effective management requires an integrated approach.

### Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Scale Insects and Mealybugs in Pomegranate

1.  **Regular Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your pomegranate plants, especially the undersides of leaves, stems, and fruit calyx, for early signs of infestation.
2.  **Pruning and Sanitation:**
    *   Remove and destroy severely infested branches, leaves, and fruits.
    *   Prune out water sprouts and suckers to improve air circulation and reduce hiding places for pests.
    *   Keep the orchard floor clean of weeds and plant debris, which can harbour pests.
3.  **Biological Control:** Encourage natural enemies such as parasitic wasps (e.g., *Anagyrus dactylopii* for mealybugs) and predatory beetles (e.g., *Cryptolaemus montrouzieri* for mealybugs, ladybird beetles for scales). Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.
4.  **Proper Nutrition and Irrigation:** Maintain healthy plants through balanced fertilization and appropriate irrigation, as stressed plants are more susceptible to pest attacks.

### Chemical Control Measures

When pest populations are high and cultural/biological methods are insufficient, chemical control becomes necessary. Always ensure thorough spray coverage, especially reaching the hidden parts of the plant where these pests reside. Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

#### For Scale Insects:

Apply insecticides when crawlers (young, mobile scales) are active, or when infestation is noticed.

*   **Horticultural Mineral Oil (HMO)**: Apply at 10-25 ml/L of water. This works by smothering the scales. It is particularly effective during dormant periods or for low infestations.
*   **Buprofezin 25% SC**: Apply at 1.25 ml/L of water (or 500 ml/acre). This is an insect growth regulator, effective against nymphs.
*   **Spirotetramat 150 OD**: Apply at 0.75-1 ml/L of water (or 300-400 ml/acre). This is a systemic insecticide that moves both upwards and downwards in the plant, providing excellent control of hidden scales.
*   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL**: Apply at 0.5-0.75 ml/L of water (or 200-300 ml/acre). This is a systemic insecticide effective against sucking pests.
*   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG**: Apply at 0.2-0.4 g/L of water (or 80-160 g/acre). This is another systemic insecticide.

#### For Mealybugs:

Mealybugs are often protected by their waxy coating, so thorough coverage and systemic insecticides are crucial.

*   **Horticultural Mineral Oil (HMO)**: Apply at 10-25 ml/L of water. Can help in smothering mealybugs, especially when mixed with other insecticides.
*   **Buprofezin 25% SC**: Apply at 1.25 ml/L of water (or 500 ml/acre). Effective against mealybug nymphs.
*   **Spirotetramat 150 OD**: Apply at 0.75-1 ml/L of water (or 300-400 ml/acre). Its systemic action helps reach mealybugs in hidden crevices.
*   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL**: Apply at 0.5-0.75 ml/L of water (or 200-300 ml/acre). A systemic option for sucking pests.
*   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG**: Apply at 0.2-0.4 g/L of water (or 80-160 g/acre). Another systemic insecticide.
*   **Acetamiprid 20% SP**: Apply at 0.2-0.4 g/L of water (or 80-160 g/acre). This is a systemic neonicotinoid insecticide.
*   **Flupyradifurone 200 SL**: Apply at 0.75-1 ml/L of water (or 300-400 ml/acre). A newer systemic insecticide with good efficacy against sucking pests.

### Important Considerations:

*   **Spray Coverage:** For both pests, especially mealybugs and scales, ensure complete and thorough coverage of the plant, including the undersides of leaves, stems, and fruit clusters. A high-volume sprayer is often recommended.
*   **Resistance Management:** Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent pests from developing resistance. Do not use the same chemical repeatedly.
*   **Safety:** Always read and follow the instructions on the product label carefully, including dosage, application method, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and safety precautions. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying.
*   **Adjuvants:** Adding a good quality spreading/sticking agent (adjuvant) to the spray solution can improve the efficacy of insecticides, especially against waxy pests like mealybugs and scales.
