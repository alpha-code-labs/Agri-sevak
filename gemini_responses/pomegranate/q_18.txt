As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified recommendations for the use of growth regulators and Boron in Pomegranate cultivation in Haryana:

Please note that the use of growth regulators requires precise application and timing for optimal results and to avoid phytotoxicity. Always follow label instructions and conduct a small-scale trial if unsure.

*   **Ethephon** (formerly known by brand name Ethrel)
    *   **Purpose:** To promote uniform fruit ripening and enhance fruit colour development.
    *   **Recommended Dose:** Apply a foliar spray of **Ethephon** at 250-500 ppm (parts per million).
        *   For a 48% SL formulation (480 g/L **Ethephon**), this translates to approximately **0.5-1.0 ml/L** of water.
    *   **Timing:** Apply 10-15 days before the anticipated harvest, when fruits have attained physiological maturity.

*   **2,4-D**
    *   **Purpose:** **2,4-D** is primarily a selective herbicide. While it can act as a growth regulator at extremely low concentrations in some crops, its use as a growth regulator (e.g., for fruit drop control or fruit enlargement) in Pomegranate is **not a standard or widely recommended practice** by agricultural universities in India.
    *   **Caution:** Due to its potent herbicidal nature, even slight deviations from extremely low concentrations can cause severe phytotoxicity, deformities, and yield loss in Pomegranate. For fruit drop control in Pomegranate, **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA)** is a much safer and commonly recommended alternative.
    *   **Recommendation:** We do not recommend the use of **2,4-D** as a growth regulator for Pomegranate due to the high risk of crop damage and the availability of safer alternatives.

*   **Boron** (as a micronutrient)
    *   **Purpose:** Boron is an essential micronutrient critical for pollen germination, fruit set, fruit development, and preventing fruit cracking in Pomegranate.
    *   **Recommended Dose (Foliar Application):**
        *   Using **Borax (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate)** (containing 10.5% Boron): Apply **1-2 g/L** of water.
        *   Using **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (e.g., Solubor, containing 20% Boron): Apply **0.5-1 g/L** of water.
    *   **Timing:**
        *   First spray: At the pre-flowering stage.
        *   Second spray: During fruit set/early fruit development stage.
        *   Third spray (if needed): During fruit development, especially if symptoms of Boron deficiency (e.g., fruit cracking) are observed or anticipated.
