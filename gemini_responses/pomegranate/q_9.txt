Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can confirm that Red Spider Mite (Tetranychus urticae) and Rust Mite (Aceria granati or similar eriophyid mites) are significant pests of Pomegranate in Haryana, especially during hot and dry periods. Effective management is crucial to prevent yield and quality losses.

Here's a scientifically verified approach to control these mites:

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Principles:**

Before resorting to chemical control, consider these IPM practices:

1.  **Regular Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your pomegranate plants, especially the undersides of leaves and developing fruits, for early signs of mite infestation (stippling, bronzing, webbing for spider mites; russeting, bronzing for rust mites). Early detection allows for timely intervention.
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Pruning:** Ensure proper pruning to improve air circulation within the canopy, which can make the environment less favourable for mites.
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the orchard floor free of weeds, as many weeds can act as alternate hosts for mites.
    *   **Proper Irrigation:** Avoid water stress, as stressed plants are more susceptible to mite attacks. Overhead irrigation can sometimes help wash off mites, but should be used judiciously to avoid fungal issues.
3.  **Biological Control:** Encourage natural enemies like predatory mites (e.g., Amblyseius species) and ladybird beetles, which feed on pest mites. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

**Chemical Control (Acaricides):**

When mite populations reach damaging levels, chemical control with CIBRC approved acaricides becomes necessary. It is crucial to rotate different groups of acaricides to prevent the development of resistance. Always ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves.

Here are some recommended acaricides and their dosages:

*   **For Red Spider Mite and Rust Mite:**
    *   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** Apply at a rate of 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Fenpyroximate 5% SC:** Apply at a rate of 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP:** Apply at a rate of 2.0 - 3.0 grams per litre of water. This is particularly effective against rust mites and also helps suppress spider mites.
    *   **Abamectin 1.9% EC:** Apply at a rate of 0.3 - 0.5 ml per litre of water.

*   **Primarily for Red Spider Mite:**
    *   **Propargite 57% EC:** Apply at a rate of 1.5 - 2.0 ml per litre of water.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Rotation:** Always rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development. Do not use the same chemical group repeatedly.
*   **Spray Coverage:** Mites are often found on the undersides of leaves. Ensure thorough spray coverage for effective control.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying. Follow the instructions on the product label regarding dosage, application timing, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   **Water Quality:** Use clean water for spraying.
