Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice on addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies in Safed Musli (*Chlorophytum borivilianum*).

The foundation of effective nutrient management is a comprehensive **soil test**. This will accurately determine the existing nutrient levels in your field and guide precise fertilizer application, preventing both deficiencies and over-application.

Here's how to address deficiencies of Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K) in Safed Musli:

### General NPK Recommendation for Safed Musli (Guideline, subject to soil test):
Typically, Safed Musli requires around 20-40 kg Nitrogen (N), 40-60 kg Phosphorus (P2O5), and 20-40 kg Potassium (K2O) per acre.

### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** General yellowing of older leaves, stunted growth, reduced leaf size, and overall pale green appearance of the plant.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Basal Application:** A portion of the total Nitrogen requirement is applied at the time of planting.
    *   **Top Dressing:** If deficiency symptoms appear during the growth phase, or as part of a split application schedule.
    *   **Fertilizer:**
        *   **Urea** (46% Nitrogen)
    *   **Application Rate (for correction/maintenance):**
        *   Apply 45-90 kg of **Urea** per acre, split into 2-3 doses. The first dose can be basal, and subsequent doses as top dressing at 30-45 and 60-75 days after planting, depending on plant growth and soil test recommendations.
        *   For immediate correction of visible deficiency, a top dressing of 10-15 kg **Urea** per acre can be applied, followed by light irrigation.
        *   **Foliar Spray (for quick but temporary relief):** A 1-2% solution of **Urea** (10-20 g **Urea** per litre of water) can be sprayed on the foliage during cooler parts of the day. Repeat after 7-10 days if needed.

### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Dark green or purplish discoloration of older leaves, stunted root development, delayed maturity, and poor tuber formation.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Basal Application:** Phosphorus is relatively immobile in the soil, so it is most effective when applied at or before planting, incorporated into the soil.
    *   **Fertilizers:**
        *   **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% Nitrogen, 46% P2O5)
        *   **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5)
    *   **Application Rate (for maintenance):**
        *   Apply 85-130 kg of **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** per acre, or 250-375 kg of **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** per acre. The entire dose should be applied as a basal application at the time of planting and thoroughly mixed with the soil.
        *   **Note:** Foliar application of Phosphorus is generally less effective for correcting severe deficiencies due to poor absorption.

### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Yellowing and browning (scorching) of leaf margins, especially on older leaves, weak stems, poor tuber development, and increased susceptibility to diseases.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Basal Application:** Potassium should primarily be applied at the time of planting.
    *   **Fertilizer:**
        *   **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** / **Potassium Chloride** (60% K2O)
    *   **Application Rate (for maintenance):**
        *   Apply 35-65 kg of **Muriate of Potash** per acre. The entire dose can be applied as a basal application at the time of planting.
        *   **Foliar Spray (for quick but temporary relief):** A 1% solution of **Muriate of Potash** (10 g **Muriate of Potash** per litre of water) can be sprayed on the foliage during cooler parts of the day. Repeat after 7-10 days if needed.

### Important Considerations:

*   **Soil pH:** Ensure your soil pH is within the optimal range (typically 6.0-7.5) for Safed Musli, as extreme pH values can reduce nutrient availability.
*   **Organic Matter:** Incorporating well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost (10-15 tonnes per acre) significantly improves soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability, reducing reliance on chemical fertilizers.
*   **Irrigation:** Adequate and timely irrigation is crucial for nutrient uptake by the plants.
