As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the use of Growth Regulators/Hormones and Boron in Safed Musli (Chlorophytum borivilianum) for Haryana.

It is important to note that the primary focus for Safed Musli cultivation is on healthy root development and yield.

*   **Ethrel (Ethephon):**
    This is not known to affect Safed Musli in a beneficial way for commercial root production.

*   **2,4-D (2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid):**
    This is not known to affect Safed Musli in a beneficial way for commercial root production. At higher concentrations, 2,4-D acts as a herbicide and can be detrimental to the crop.

*   **Boron:**
    Boron is an essential micronutrient, not a hormone or growth regulator, but it plays a crucial role in cell wall formation, sugar transport, and overall plant development, including tuber formation. Its deficiency can severely impact Safed Musli yield.

    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   **Technical Chemical Name:** **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (e.g., Solubor)
        *   **Dose:** 1-2 g/L of water.
        *   **Timing:** Apply as a foliar spray during the active vegetative growth phase and at the onset of tuber initiation. Two sprays at an interval of 15-20 days can be beneficial if deficiency is suspected or as a prophylactic measure in boron-deficient soils.
