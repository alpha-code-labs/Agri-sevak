As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified seed (tuber) and soil treatment processes for Safed Musli (Chlorophytum borivilianum) cultivation in Haryana.

It is important to note that Safed Musli is propagated through fasciculated roots (tubers), not true seeds. Therefore, "seed treatment" refers to the treatment of these planting tubers, and "soil treatment" refers to the pre-planting preparation of the field.

### 1. Planting Material (Tuber) Treatment

To protect the planting tubers from soil-borne fungal diseases and to promote healthy establishment, the following treatments are recommended:

*   **Fungicidal Treatment:**
    *   Dip the healthy, disease-free tubers for 20-30 minutes in a solution of **Carbendazim 50% WP** at 1 g/L of water, or a combination product of **Carbendazim 12% + Mancozeb 63% WP** at 2 g/L of water.
    *   Allow the tubers to air dry thoroughly in shade before planting.
*   **Bio-fungicidal Treatment:**
    *   Alternatively, or in addition to chemical treatment (after the tubers have dried), dip the tubers for 30 minutes in a suspension of **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum** (20-30 g/L of water). This helps in suppressing soil-borne pathogens and promoting early root growth.
    *   Allow to air dry in shade before planting.

### 2. Soil Treatment

Proper soil treatment is crucial for managing soil-borne diseases, nematodes, and improving overall soil health for Safed Musli cultivation.

*   **Pre-planting Soil Preparation:**
    *   Incorporate well-decomposed Farmyard Manure (FYM) or vermicompost at 10-15 tonnes/acre into the soil at least 2-3 weeks before planting. This improves soil structure, fertility, and microbial activity.
*   **Management of Soil-borne Fungal Diseases:**
    *   **Biological Control:** Apply **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum** at 2-4 kg/acre, mixed with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed FYM or sand. Broadcast this mixture evenly over the field before the last ploughing or at the time of planting.
    *   **Chemical Control (if severe disease history):** If there is a known history of severe tuber rot, a pre-planting soil drench with **Carbendazim 50% WP** at 500 g/acre or **Propamocarb hydrochloride 72.2% SL** at 1-1.5 L/acre (mixed with sufficient water for drenching) can be considered. This should be done before planting.
*   **Nematode Management:** Root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.) can be a significant problem for Safed Musli.
    *   **Biological Control:** Apply **Purpureocillium lilacinum** (formerly Paecilomyces lilacinus) at 2-4 kg/acre, mixed with 50-100 kg of FYM or sand. Broadcast this mixture evenly before planting and incorporate into the soil.
    *   **Chemical Control (if severe nematode infestation):**
        *   Apply **Carbofuran 3% G** at 10-12 kg/acre at the time of planting by broadcasting and incorporating into the soil.
        *   Alternatively, **Phorate 10% G** at 4 kg/acre can be used, but it is highly toxic and requires extreme caution during application.
        *   *Note: Always follow label instructions, wear appropriate personal protective equipment, and adhere to local agricultural department guidelines for the safe and effective use of nematicides.*
