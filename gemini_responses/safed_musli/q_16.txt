As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following fertilizer schedule for Safed Musli (Chlorophytum borivilianum) in Haryana. Please note that these are general recommendations, and a soil test report is always the most accurate basis for fertilizer application.

**General NPK and Sulphur Recommendation for Safed Musli (without soil test):**
*   **Nitrogen (N):** 30-40 kg/acre
*   **Phosphorus (P2O5):** 60-80 kg/acre
*   **Potassium (K2O):** 40-60 kg/acre
*   **Sulphur (S):** 20 kg/acre

Based on these targets, here are the recommended doses for the specific fertilizers you mentioned:

### Recommended Fertilizer Doses for Safed Musli

**1. Basal Application (at the time of planting):**
Apply the following fertilizers uniformly and incorporate them into the soil before planting the Safed Musli tubers. This covers the full dose of Phosphorus, Potassium, Sulphur, and a part of Nitrogen.

*   **DAP (Di-ammonium Phosphate):**
    *   **Dose:** **150-155 kg/acre**
    *   *Provides approximately 27-28 kg N and 69-71 kg P2O5.*
*   **Muriate of Potash (MOP):**
    *   **Dose:** **80-85 kg/acre**
    *   *Provides approximately 48-51 kg K2O.*
*   **Bentonite Sulphur (90%):**
    *   **Dose:** **20-25 kg/acre**
    *   *Provides approximately 18-22.5 kg S.*

**Alternative for Phosphorus and Sulphur (if DAP is not preferred or for higher Sulphur):**

*   **Single Super Phosphate (SSP):**
    *   **Dose:** **430-440 kg/acre**
    *   *If using SSP, apply this dose as basal. This will provide approximately 69-70 kg P2O5 and 47-48 kg S. In this case, separate Bentonite Sulphur application is not required, and you would need to supplement Nitrogen separately using Urea.*

**Alternative for NPK Complex (if preferred for basal application):**

*   **NPK (Complex Fertilizer, e.g., 12:32:16):**
    *   **Dose:** **200-220 kg/acre**
    *   *Apply as basal. This will provide approximately 24-26 kg N, 64-70 kg P2O5, and 32-35 kg K2O. You may need to supplement with additional **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** (20-25 kg/acre) and **Urea** (15-20 kg/acre) as top-dressing to meet the full K and N requirements.*

**2. Top-dressing Application (30-45 days after planting):**
This application provides the remaining Nitrogen required for plant growth.

*   **Urea:**
    *   **Dose:** **15-20 kg/acre**
    *   *Apply as a top-dressing, preferably when the soil has adequate moisture or before irrigation.*

**3. Foliar Application (as supplementary or corrective measures):**
These nano-fertilizers are primarily for foliar application and act as supplementary nutrient sources or for correcting deficiencies.

*   **Nano-Urea:**
    *   **Dose:** **2-4 ml/L** of water.
    *   *Apply as a foliar spray at 30-45 days after planting, and again at 60-75 days if needed, especially during active vegetative growth or if N deficiency symptoms appear.*
*   **Nano-DAP:**
    *   **Dose:** **2-4 ml/L** of water.
    *   *Apply as a foliar spray at 30-45 days after planting, especially during early growth stages or if P deficiency symptoms appear.*

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Organic Matter:** Always enrich the soil with well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost at a rate of **10-15 tonnes/acre** during land preparation. This significantly improves soil health and nutrient availability.
*   **Micronutrients:** Safed Musli may also benefit from micronutrient application, especially Zinc and Boron. A soil test can confirm specific deficiencies. If not tested, a general application of a micronutrient mixture (e.g., **5 kg/acre** of a chelated micronutrient mix) can be beneficial as a basal dose.
*   **Water Management:** Ensure proper irrigation and drainage, as nutrient uptake is highly dependent on soil moisture.
*   **Soil Testing:** For precise and efficient nutrient management, it is highly recommended to get your soil tested every 2-3 years. This will provide specific recommendations tailored to your field's nutrient status.
