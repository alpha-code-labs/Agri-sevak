As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following practices for the ideal transplantation of Safed Musli in Haryana:

*   **Ideal Transplantation Time:**
    The ideal time for transplanting Safed Musli in Haryana is with the onset of the monsoon, typically from **mid-June to mid-July**. Planting should ideally be done immediately after the first good monsoon showers to ensure adequate moisture for establishment and vigorous growth during the rainy season.

*   **Planting Distance:**
    For optimal growth and development of the fasciculated roots, a spacing of **30 cm between rows and 15 cm between plants** within a row is recommended. This spacing allows for proper aeration, nutrient uptake, and root development.

*   **Transplantation Process:**
    1.  **Land Preparation:** Prepare a well-drained, fertile field. Plough the land thoroughly to a depth of 20-30 cm, followed by harrowing to achieve a fine tilth. Incorporate 15-20 tonnes of well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost per acre during the last ploughing.
    2.  **Bed Preparation:** For optimal drainage and aeration, especially during the monsoon, prepare raised beds of approximately 15-20 cm height and 90-120 cm width, with furrows in between.
    3.  **Selection of Planting Material:** Use healthy, disease-free fasciculated roots (finger-like tubers) weighing 5-10 grams each, with at least one prominent crown bud.
    4.  **Treatment of Planting Material:** Before planting, treat the fasciculated roots by dipping them for 20-30 minutes in a solution of **Carbendazim** (1 g/L of water) to prevent fungal diseases and improve establishment.
    5.  **Planting:** Plant the treated fasciculated roots vertically in the prepared beds, ensuring the crown bud faces upwards and is just covered by 2-3 cm of soil. Maintain the recommended spacing of 30 cm x 15 cm.
    6.  **Initial Irrigation:** If there is a dry spell after planting or if planting is done before heavy monsoon, provide light irrigation immediately after planting to ensure proper establishment.
    7.  **Mulching (Optional but Recommended):** Apply a layer of organic mulch (e.g., paddy straw, dry leaves) 5-7 cm thick over the beds after planting. This helps conserve soil moisture, suppress weed growth, and regulate soil temperature, which is beneficial for root development.
