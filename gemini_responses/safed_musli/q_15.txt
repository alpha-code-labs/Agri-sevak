As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned conditions in Safed Musli (Chlorophytum borivilianum) in Haryana:

*   **Grasshopper:**
    Grasshoppers are polyphagous pests and can occasionally cause defoliation in Safed Musli, especially during outbreaks or high population densities, although they are not considered a primary pest of this crop.
    *   **Cultural Control:** Maintain field hygiene and remove weeds that can serve as alternate hosts.
    *   **Chemical Control (if severe infestation):**
        *   Spray with **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 1.0 ml/L of water.
        *   Alternatively, spray with **Cypermethrin** 25% EC at 0.5 ml/L of water.

*   **Painted bug (Bagrada hilaris):**
    This is not known to affect Safed Musli. Painted bug is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops like mustard, cabbage, and radish.

*   **Red cotton bug (Dysdercus cingulatus):**
    This is not known to affect Safed Musli. Red cotton bug is a major pest of cotton and other malvaceous plants, primarily feeding on developing seeds.

*   **Black ants:**
    Black ants are generally not considered direct pests that cause significant damage to Safed Musli plants by feeding on them. They might occasionally disturb roots while nesting or carry away seeds if direct seeded. If they are causing such damage:
    *   **Cultural Control:** Maintain good field sanitation and remove debris where ants might nest.
    *   **Chemical Control (if causing direct damage to roots or seeds):**
        *   For soil drenching around affected plants or seed lines, use **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 2.5 ml/L of water.
