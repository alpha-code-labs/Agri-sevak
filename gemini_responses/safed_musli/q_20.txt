As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified approaches to address micronutrient deficiencies in Safed Musli. It is crucial to conduct a soil test to confirm specific deficiencies and their severity before applying any amendments.

### General Recommendations:

*   **Soil Testing:** Always begin with a comprehensive soil test to accurately diagnose deficiencies and determine the appropriate application rates.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management:** Combine soil application for long-term correction with foliar sprays for quick relief, especially for immobile nutrients like Iron and Manganese.
*   **Timing:** Foliar sprays are best applied during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late afternoon) to prevent leaf scorching and improve absorption.
*   **Adjuvants:** Use a good quality non-ionic spreader/sticker with foliar sprays to enhance coverage and uptake.

### Specific Micronutrient Deficiencies and Management:

#### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, small leaves (little leaf), interveinal chlorosis, bronzing of older leaves.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 10-15 kg/acre of **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (21% Zn) or 6-8 kg/acre of **Zinc sulphate monohydrate** (33% Zn) at the time of planting or as a basal dose.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Spray 0.5% solution (5 g/L) of **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** mixed with 0.25% (2.5 g/L) of slaked lime, or 0.1% solution (1 g/L) of **Zinc EDTA**. Apply 2-3 sprays at 15-day intervals, starting when symptoms appear.

#### 2. Iron (Fe) Deficiency (Ferrous)

*   **Symptoms:** Prominent interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on young leaves, with veins remaining green. In severe cases, leaves may turn completely yellow or white.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Spray (Most Effective):** Spray 0.5-1% solution (5-10 g/L) of **Ferrous sulphate** mixed with 0.25% (2.5 g/L) of slaked lime, or 0.1% solution (1 g/L) of **Ferrous EDTA**. Apply 2-3 sprays at 7-10 day intervals, as iron is relatively immobile in the plant and soil conditions in Haryana often lead to its unavailability.

#### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, death of growing points, brittle leaves, cracking of stems/petioles, poor root/tuber development.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 2-4 kg/acre of **Borax** (10.5-11.3% B) or 1-2 kg/acre of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (20% B) as a basal dose.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Spray 0.1-0.2% solution (1-2 g/L) of **Borax** or **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate**. Apply 1-2 sprays during the active growth phase.

#### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Death of growing points (meristems), distorted or stunted young leaves, poor root development.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** If soil test indicates low calcium and/or high acidity, apply **Gypsum** (Calcium sulphate) as per soil test recommendations. For general maintenance, 10-20 kg/acre of **Calcium nitrate** can be applied.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Spray 0.5-1% solution (5-10 g/L) of **Calcium nitrate** or **Calcium chloride**. Apply 2-3 sprays during critical growth stages.

#### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, starting from leaf margins and progressing inwards, often with purplish or reddish tints.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 10-20 kg/acre of **Magnesium sulphate** (Epsom salt) as a basal dose or side-dressed.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Spray 0.5-1% solution (5-10 g/L) of **Magnesium sulphate**. Apply 2-3 sprays at 15-day intervals.

#### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, similar to iron deficiency but often with a finer network of green veins, sometimes accompanied by necrotic spots.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 5-10 kg/acre of **Manganese sulphate** as a basal dose.
    *   **Foliar Spray (Often Preferred):** Spray 0.25-0.5% solution (2.5-5 g/L) of **Manganese sulphate**. Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals.

Always consult with a local agricultural expert or HAU extension specialist for precise recommendations tailored to your specific field conditions and soil test results.
