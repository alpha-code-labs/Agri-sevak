For Safed Musli (Chlorophytum borivilianum) cultivation in Haryana, the application of organic manures is highly beneficial for soil health, nutrient availability, and overall plant growth, especially considering its medicinal value often requiring organic cultivation practices. Here are the recommended doses:

*   **Farm Yard Manure (FYM):**
    *   Apply **15-20 tonnes per acre** during land preparation. It should be thoroughly incorporated into the soil at least 2-3 weeks before planting. Ensure the FYM is well-decomposed to avoid nutrient immobilization and pest issues.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   Apply **4-5 tonnes per acre** during land preparation, or as a basal application in the planting pits. Vermicompost can also be used as a top dressing after planting to provide a continuous supply of nutrients.

*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract):**
    *   **Granular Form (e.g., Sagarika G):** Apply **8-10 kg per acre** as a soil application at the time of planting or as a basal dose, mixed with the soil.
    *   **Liquid Form (e.g., Sagarika Z+):**
        *   For foliar application, mix **2-3 ml per litre of water** and spray at critical growth stages (e.g., 30-45 days after planting, and again at the tuber development stage).
        *   For soil drenching, use **1 litre per acre** mixed with sufficient water, applied around the root zone.
