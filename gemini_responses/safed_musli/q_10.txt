As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in Safed Musli in Haryana:

**Diamondback moth:**
This is not known to affect Safed Musli.

For the control of Borers, Caterpillars, and Leaf folders in Safed Musli, the following integrated pest management (IPM) strategies and chemical control measures are recommended:

**1. For Borers (Tuber Borers/Stem Borers):**
*   **Soil application/Drenching (for tuber borers, applied at planting or as a drench around the plant base):**
    *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: 2.5 ml/L of water for drenching, or **Chlorpyrifos** 10% GR: 20 kg/acre mixed with soil.
    *   **Fipronil** 0.3% GR: 10-15 kg/acre applied to the soil.
*   **Foliar spray (for stem borers or early stage borers):**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC: 0.3 ml/L of water.
    *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG: 0.4 g/L of water.

**2. For Caterpillars and Leaf folders:**
*   **Foliar spray:**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC: 0.3 ml/L of water.
    *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG: 0.4 g/L of water.
    *   **Flubendiamide** 20% WG: 0.25 g/L of water.
    *   **Indoxacarb** 14.5% SC: 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Spinosad** 45% SC: 0.25 ml/L of water.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pest resistance.
*   Ensure thorough coverage of the plant foliage during spraying.
*   Strictly follow the label instructions for dosage, safety precautions, and pre-harvest intervals.
*   Regularly monitor your crop for pest incidence to ensure timely intervention.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension specialists for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and the prevailing pest situation.
