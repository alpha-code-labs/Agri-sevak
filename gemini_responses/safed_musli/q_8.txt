Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I will provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling sucking pests in Safed Musli.

First, regarding Psylla, please note:
*   This is not known to affect Safed Musli.

For the control of Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips in Safed Musli, consider the following CIBRC approved technical chemicals and practices:

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Principles:**
*   **Regular Scouting:** Monitor your crop frequently (at least twice a week) for the presence of pests, especially on the undersides of leaves and new shoots. Early detection is key.
*   **Cultural Practices:** Maintain good field sanitation, remove weeds which can act as alternate hosts for pests.
*   **Biological Control:** Encourage natural enemies like ladybird beetles, lacewings, and hoverfly larvae, which prey on aphids and other soft-bodied insects. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides if natural enemy populations are high.

**Chemical Control (when pest populations exceed economic threshold):**
When chemical intervention is necessary, rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where these pests often reside.

Here are some CIBRC approved technical chemicals:

*   **For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips:**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at a rate of 0.5 - 0.75 ml per litre of water (or 100 - 150 ml per acre in 200-300 litres of water).
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at a rate of 0.2 - 0.3 g per litre of water (or 40 - 60 g per acre in 200-300 litres of water).
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply at a rate of 0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water (or 40 - 80 g per acre in 200-300 litres of water).
    *   **Dimethoate 30% EC:** Apply at a rate of 1.5 - 2.0 ml per litre of water (or 300 - 400 ml per acre in 200-300 litres of water).

*   **For Whiteflies (especially nymphs) and Thrips:**
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at a rate of 1.0 - 1.25 ml per litre of water (or 200 - 250 ml per acre in 200-300 litres of water). This primarily targets nymphs and pupae.

*   **For Aphids and Whiteflies:**
    *   **Flonicamid 50% WG:** Apply at a rate of 0.3 g per litre of water (or 60 g per acre in 200 litres of water).

*   **Botanical Insecticide (for early stages or organic approach):**
    *   **Azadirachtin 1500 ppm EC:** Apply at a rate of 3 - 5 ml per litre of water (or 600 - 1000 ml per acre in 200 litres of water). This acts as an antifeedant and growth regulator.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label carefully.
*   Use appropriate safety gear (gloves, mask, protective clothing) during mixing and spraying.
*   Ensure proper spray coverage for effective control.
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations based on the current pest situation in your area.

Jai Kisan!
