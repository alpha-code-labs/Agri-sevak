Here are the recommended cultivation practices for Safed Musli:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   Safed Musli is primarily propagated using healthy, disease-free fasciculated roots (tubers).
    *   Planting should be done on well-prepared **raised beds**. These beds should typically be 15-20 cm high and 90-120 cm wide, with adequate space between beds for irrigation and drainage channels. This method is crucial to prevent waterlogging, which is detrimental to the crop.
    *   Plant the tubers in rows on these raised beds.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   Plant the tubers at a depth of **2-5 cm** from the soil surface. Ensure the growing point (apical bud) of the tuber faces upwards for proper emergence.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   Maintain a spacing of **30 cm** between rows and **15-20 cm** between plants within a row. This spacing allows for optimal growth, air circulation, and nutrient uptake.

*   **Seed Dose (Tuber Dose):**
    *   For planting, use healthy fasciculated roots (tubers) weighing 5-10 grams each.
    *   An average tuber dose of **400-600 kg per acre** is recommended, depending on the size of the tubers and the chosen planting density. This typically translates to approximately 150,000 to 200,000 tubers per acre.
