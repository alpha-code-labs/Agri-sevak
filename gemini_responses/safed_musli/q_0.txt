As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Safed Musli (Chlorophytum borivilianum) in Haryana.

It is important to note that not all listed diseases are commonly reported or known to significantly affect Safed Musli.

Here's a breakdown for each condition:

1.  **Alternaria (Alternaria Leaf Spot):**
    This is a known fungal disease affecting Safed Musli, causing characteristic spots on leaves.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   **Cultural Practices:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris. Ensure proper plant spacing for good air circulation. Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day.
        *   **Chemical Control:**
            *   For prevention or early stages, spray with contact fungicides:
                *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP at 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5-3 g/L of water).
                *   **Chlorothalonil** 75% WP at 2 kg/acre (or 2-2.5 g/L of water).
            *   For moderate to severe infections, use systemic fungicides or a combination:
                *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC at 200 ml/acre (or 0.2 ml/L of water).
                *   **Tebuconazole** 250 EC at 200 ml/acre (or 0.2 ml/L of water).
                *   A combination of **Azoxystrobin + Tebuconazole** (e.g., 18.2% + 18.2% SC) at 300-400 ml/acre (or 0.3-0.4 ml/L of water).

2.  **Anthracnose:**
    Anthracnose (caused by *Colletotrichum* species) is a known fungal disease affecting Safed Musli, leading to sunken lesions on leaves and stems.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   **Cultural Practices:** Use disease-free planting material. Maintain field sanitation.
        *   **Chemical Control:**
            *   For prevention or early stages, spray with contact fungicides:
                *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP at 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5-3 g/L of water).
                *   **Copper Oxychloride** 50% WP at 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5-3 g/L of water).
            *   For moderate to severe infections, use systemic fungicides:
                *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 500 g/acre (or 0.5 g/L of water).
                *   **Propiconazole** 25% EC at 200 ml/acre (or 0.2 ml/L of water).
                *   **Difenoconazole** 25% EC at 100 ml/acre (or 0.1 ml/L of water).

3.  **Blast:**
    This is not known to affect Safed Musli.

4.  **Blight (Leaf Blight):**
    Leaf blight, often caused by *Alternaria* or *Colletotrichum* species, is a common symptom complex affecting Safed Musli. The control measures are similar to those for Alternaria and Anthracnose.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   **Cultural Practices:** As mentioned for Alternaria and Anthracnose.
        *   **Chemical Control:**
            *   Apply broad-spectrum fungicides:
                *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP at 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5-3 g/L of water).
                *   **Chlorothalonil** 75% WP at 2 kg/acre (or 2-2.5 g/L of water).
                *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC at 200 ml/acre (or 0.2 ml/L of water).
                *   **Tebuconazole** 250 EC at 200 ml/acre (or 0.2 ml/L of water).
                *   A combination of **Azoxystrobin + Tebuconazole** (e.g., 18.2% + 18.2% SC) at 300-400 ml/acre (or 0.3-0.4 ml/L of water).

5.  **Brown Spot:**
    Brown spot, often caused by *Curvularia* or *Alternaria* species, is a known leaf spot disease in Safed Musli. The control measures are similar to those for Alternaria leaf spot.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   **Cultural Practices:** As mentioned for Alternaria.
        *   **Chemical Control:**
            *   Apply fungicides effective against leaf spots:
                *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP at 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5-3 g/L of water).
                *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 500 g/acre (or 0.5 g/L of water).
                *   **Propiconazole** 25% EC at 200 ml/acre (or 0.2 ml/L of water).

6.  **Downy Mildew:**
    This is not known to affect Safed Musli.

7.  **Powdery Mildew:**
    This is not known to affect Safed Musli.

8.  **Grey Mildew:**
    This is not known to affect Safed Musli.

**General Recommendations for Fungal Disease Management in Safed Musli:**

*   **Integrated Approach:** Combine cultural practices with judicious use of fungicides for effective and sustainable disease management.
*   **Fungicide Rotation:** Always rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in fungal pathogens.
*   **Timely Application:** Apply fungicides preventively or at the very first sign of disease symptoms for best results.
*   **Thorough Coverage:** Ensure complete and uniform spray coverage of the plant foliage, including the undersides of leaves.
*   **Water Quality:** Use clean water for spraying and ensure proper pH if required for specific chemicals.
*   **Safety Precautions:** Always read and strictly follow the instructions, dosage, and safety precautions mentioned on the fungicide label. Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application.
*   **Consultation:** For specific local conditions and severe outbreaks, it is advisable to consult with local agricultural extension specialists or HAU experts for tailored advice.
