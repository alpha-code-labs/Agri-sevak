As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm that various types of rot, including Root, Stem, Foot, Collar, Crown, Neck, Black, Fruit, Seed, and Seedling rot, are significant concerns in Moth Bean (Vigna aconitifolia) cultivation in Haryana. These conditions are primarily caused by a complex of soil-borne and seed-borne fungal pathogens such as *Rhizoctonia solani*, *Fusarium spp.*, *Macrophomina phaseolina*, *Sclerotium rolfsii*, and *Pythium spp.*.

Effective control requires an integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods.

### Integrated Management Strategy for Rot Diseases in Moth Bean:

**1. Cultural Practices (Preventive Measures):**

*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice rotation with non-host crops (e.g., cereals like pearl millet or sorghum) for at least 2-3 years to reduce pathogen inoculum in the soil.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris from the field to prevent pathogen carryover.
*   **Proper Drainage:** Ensure good field drainage to avoid waterlogging, which favors the development of most rot pathogens.
*   **Optimum Sowing Time and Depth:** Sow seeds at the recommended time and depth to ensure vigorous seedling emergence, reducing the window of susceptibility.
*   **Balanced Fertilization:** Avoid excessive nitrogen application, which can lead to lush, succulent growth more susceptible to disease. Use balanced NPK fertilizers based on soil test recommendations.
*   **Use of Healthy Seeds:** Always use certified, disease-free seeds from reputable sources.
*   **Deep Ploughing/Summer Ploughing:** Exposing the soil to high summer temperatures can help reduce the inoculum of soil-borne pathogens.

**2. Biological Control:**

*   **Seed Treatment with Bio-agents:**
    *   Treat seeds with *Trichoderma viride* or *Trichoderma harzianum* (4 g/kg seed) or *Pseudomonas fluorescens* (10 g/kg seed) before sowing. These bio-agents colonize the root zone and suppress the growth of pathogenic fungi.

**3. Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved Technical Chemicals):**

Chemical control primarily focuses on seed treatment to protect against seed, seedling, root, collar, crown, and foot rots. For established plants, soil drenching or foliar sprays may be required for severe cases or specific rot types like fruit rot.

*   **A. Seed Treatment (Most Critical Step):**
    *   Treat seeds with any one of the following fungicides before sowing. This provides initial protection against seed-borne and soil-borne pathogens causing seed rot, seedling rot, root rot, collar rot, foot rot, and crown rot.
        *   **Carbendazim 50% WP:** 1-2 g/kg seed.
        *   **Thiram 75% WS:** 2-3 g/kg seed.
        *   **Captan 50% WP:** 2-3 g/kg seed.
        *   **Carboxin 37.5% + Thiram 37.5% DS:** 2-2.5 g/kg seed.
        *   **Metalaxyl 35% WS:** 2-3 g/kg seed (especially effective against *Pythium* and *Phytophthora*). Often used in combination with other fungicides.

*   **B. Soil Drenching (for established plants showing symptoms of Root, Collar, Foot, Crown, or Stem Rot):**
    *   If symptoms appear in the field on established plants, drenching the soil around the base of the affected plants can help.
        *   **Carbendazim 50% WP:** 1-2 g/L water. Apply 50-100 ml of solution per plant, ensuring it reaches the root zone.
        *   **Copper Oxychloride 50% WP:** 2-3 g/L water. Drench around the base of affected plants.

*   **C. Foliar Spray (for Fruit Rot or severe Stem Rot affecting aerial parts):**
    *   For fruit rot or if stem rot progresses significantly above the soil line, foliar application may be necessary.
        *   **Mancozeb 75% WP:** 2-2.5 g/L water.
        *   **Carbendazim 50% WP:** 0.5-1 g/L water.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions on the pesticide label.
*   Ensure proper coverage during spraying or drenching.
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension specialists for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and current disease prevalence.
