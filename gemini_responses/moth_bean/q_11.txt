Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling beetles, weevils, and sawflies in Moth Bean (Vigna aconitifolia) in Haryana. These pests are known to affect Moth Bean, primarily causing defoliation and sometimes stem or pod damage.

Effective management involves a combination of cultural practices and judicious use of CIBRC-approved insecticides when pest populations reach economic thresholds.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Approach:**

1.  **Regular Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your Moth Bean fields, especially during the vegetative and flowering stages, for the presence of adult beetles, weevils, sawfly larvae, and signs of feeding damage (e.g., holes in leaves, skeletonization).
2.  **Economic Threshold Level (ETL):** Apply chemical control only when the pest population crosses the ETL. For defoliators like beetles and sawflies, this is typically when 10-15% of the leaf area is damaged, or 2-3 adults/larvae per plant are observed. For weevils, it depends on the specific species and damage.
3.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Timely Sowing:** Sow Moth Bean at the recommended time to avoid peak pest incidence.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy crop residues and weeds that can harbor pests.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops to break the pest life cycle.

**Chemical Control (When Necessary):**

If pest populations exceed the economic threshold, the following CIBRC-approved insecticides can be used. Always ensure thorough coverage of the foliage. Use 200-250 litres of water per acre for spraying.

*   For general defoliating beetles, weevils, and sawflies:
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: Apply 200-250 ml per acre.
    *   **Quinalphos** 25% EC: Apply 1000 ml per acre.
    *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: Apply 1000 ml per acre.

*   For specific control of certain beetles and weevils (especially if pod damage is also a concern):
    *   **Indoxacarb** 14.5% SC: Apply 200 ml per acre.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Rotation of Chemicals:** To prevent the development of pesticide resistance, rotate the use of insecticides with different modes of action.
*   **Safety Precautions:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying. Follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Observe the recommended pre-harvest interval (PHI) for each insecticide to ensure the produce is safe for consumption.

For any further specific concerns or identification of particular pest species, please consult with your local agricultural extension officer or visit HAU, Hisar for detailed guidance.
