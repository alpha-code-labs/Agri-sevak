As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified information regarding specialized practices in Moth Bean (Vigna aconitifolia) for Haryana conditions:

*   **Pruning:** This is not known to affect Moth Bean as a beneficial practice. Moth bean is a short-duration, bushy annual pulse crop. Pruning is generally not practiced as it can reduce the overall yield by removing potential flowering and pod-bearing branches.
*   **Desuckering:** This is not known to affect Moth Bean. Desuckering is a practice typically applied to crops that produce unwanted basal shoots (suckers), such as sugarcane or banana. Moth bean does not produce suckers that require removal.
*   **Mulching:** Mulching can be a beneficial practice for Moth Bean, particularly in the arid and semi-arid regions of Haryana, to conserve soil moisture, suppress weed growth, and moderate soil temperature.
    *   **Organic mulches:** Crop residues (e.g., wheat straw, pearl millet stover) can be spread on the soil surface after sowing or emergence. This helps in reducing evaporation and improving soil health.
    *   **Plastic mulches:** While less common for pulse crops due to cost and management, black plastic mulch can be used for significant moisture conservation and weed control, especially in high-value cultivation or specific research trials.
*   **Grafting:** This is not known to affect Moth Bean. Grafting is a horticultural technique primarily used for perennial crops, fruit trees, or some vegetable crops to combine desirable traits of a scion and rootstock. Moth bean is an annual crop grown directly from seed, and grafting is not a relevant practice.
*   **Pollination:** This is not known to affect Moth Bean as a specialized practice. Moth bean flowers are predominantly self-pollinated (autogamous). The floral structure facilitates self-pollination, and external agents like insects are not typically required for successful fruit set. Therefore, no specialized pollination management is needed.
