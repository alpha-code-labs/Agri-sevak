As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling soil pests like Termites and Root-knot Nematodes in Moth Bean (Vigna aconitifolia) in Haryana.

Both Termites and Root-knot Nematodes are significant soil pests that can severely impact Moth Bean cultivation.

### 1. Control of Termites (e.g., *Odontotermes obesus*, *Microtermes obesi*)

Termites are polyphagous pests that can cause considerable damage to Moth Bean by feeding on germinating seeds, roots, and the collar region of young plants, leading to wilting and plant death.

**Cultural Control Measures:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove crop residues, stubble, and any woody debris from the field, as these can serve as food sources and breeding sites for termites.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** Summer deep ploughing exposes termite colonies to sunlight and predators, reducing their population.
*   **Irrigation:** Adequate irrigation can deter termites, as they prefer drier conditions.

**Chemical Control Measures (Pre-sowing/At-sowing Soil Application):**
For effective control, chemical application should target the soil before or at the time of sowing.
*   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC:** Apply **2.5 litres per acre** mixed with 200-400 litres of water as a soil drench before sowing, or mix with 20-25 kg of sand and broadcast evenly before the last ploughing.
*   **Fipronil 0.3% GR:** Apply **6-8 kg per acre** by broadcasting evenly and incorporating into the soil before sowing.

### 2. Control of Root-knot Nematodes (*Meloidogyne spp.*)

Root-knot nematodes are microscopic roundworms that infect the roots of Moth Bean, causing characteristic galls or knots. This leads to stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, reduced nutrient uptake, and significant yield losses.

**Cultural Control Measures:**
*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate Moth Bean with non-host crops like cereals (e.g., wheat, barley) for at least 2-3 years to reduce nematode populations in the soil.
*   **Summer Ploughing:** Deep ploughing during hot summer months exposes nematode eggs and larvae to desiccation and sunlight, reducing their survival.
*   **Organic Matter Incorporation:** Incorporating well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or neem cake (**200-400 kg per acre**) can improve soil health and promote beneficial microorganisms that antagonize nematodes.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** If available, cultivate Moth Bean varieties known to have resistance or tolerance to root-knot nematodes.

**Chemical Control Measures (Pre-sowing/At-sowing Soil Application):**
*   **Carbofuran 3% G:** Apply **10-13 kg per acre** in furrows at the time of sowing or broadcast evenly and incorporate into the soil before sowing.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label for safe and effective use.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods, is recommended for sustainable pest control.
*   Consult your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and current pest pressure.
