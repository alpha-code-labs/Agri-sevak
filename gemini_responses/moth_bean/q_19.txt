Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU), Hisar, I advise you on addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies in Moth Bean (Vigna aconitifolia). It is crucial to conduct a soil test to accurately determine the specific nutrient deficiencies and their severity in your field. The following recommendations are general guidelines; precise application rates should always be based on soil test reports.

Moth bean, being a leguminous crop, has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria (Rhizobium) in its root nodules. This significantly reduces its external nitrogen requirement.

### Addressing Macro-nutrient Deficiencies in Moth Bean:

#### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency:

*   **Symptoms:** Pale green to yellow leaves (especially older leaves), stunted growth, reduced branching, and overall poor vigor.
*   **Recommendations:**
    *   **Basal Application (Starter Dose):** Although moth bean fixes nitrogen, a small starter dose of nitrogen is beneficial, especially in soils with low organic matter or to support initial growth before nodulation is fully established.
        *   Apply 15-20 kg N per acre at the time of sowing.
        *   Use **Urea** (46% N) at a rate of 32-43 kg per acre.
    *   **Foliar Application (for quick correction):** If symptoms appear in standing crops, a foliar spray can provide a quick boost.
        *   Spray 1-2% solution of **Urea** (1-2 kg of Urea dissolved in 100 litres of water). Apply 200-250 litres of this solution per acre, ensuring good leaf coverage. Repeat if necessary after 10-15 days.
    *   **Crucial Note:** Ensure proper seed inoculation with recommended Rhizobium culture at the time of sowing to maximize biological nitrogen fixation.

#### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency:

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, dark green or purplish discoloration of leaves (especially lower leaves), delayed maturity, poor root development, and reduced pod formation. Phosphorus is vital for root development, nodulation, flowering, and seed set.
*   **Recommendations:**
    *   **Basal Application:** Phosphorus is relatively immobile in the soil, so basal application at sowing is most effective.
        *   Apply 40-60 kg P2O5 per acre at the time of sowing.
        *   Use **Single Superphosphate** (16% P2O5) at a rate of 250-375 kg per acre.
        *   Alternatively, use **Diammonium Phosphate** (18% N, 46% P2O5) at a rate of 87-130 kg per acre (adjusting for the N component if using this).
    *   **Foliar Application (for quick correction):** For standing crops showing deficiency, a foliar spray can help.
        *   Spray 0.5-1% solution of **Monoammonium Phosphate** (12% N, 61% P2O5) or **Potassium Dihydrogen Phosphate** (0% N, 52% P2O5, 34% K2O). (0.5-1 kg of chemical dissolved in 100 litres of water). Apply 200-250 litres of this solution per acre.

#### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency:

*   **Symptoms:** Yellowing and scorching of leaf margins (especially older leaves), stunted growth, weak stems, poor disease resistance, and reduced seed size. Potassium is important for water regulation, photosynthesis, and stress tolerance.
*   **Recommendations:**
    *   **Basal Application:** Apply potassium at the time of sowing if soil tests indicate deficiency.
        *   Apply 20-30 kg K2O per acre at the time of sowing.
        *   Use **Muriate of Potash** (Potassium Chloride - 60% K2O) at a rate of 33-50 kg per acre.
        *   Alternatively, use **Sulphate of Potash** (Potassium Sulphate - 50% K2O) at a rate of 40-60 kg per acre.
    *   **Foliar Application (for quick correction):** For standing crops showing deficiency.
        *   Spray 0.5-1% solution of **Potassium Nitrate** (13% N, 45% K2O), **Potassium Dihydrogen Phosphate** (0% N, 52% P2O5, 34% K2O), or **Sulphate of Potash** (0.5-1 kg of chemical dissolved in 100 litres of water). Apply 200-250 litres of this solution per acre.

**General Advice:**
Always adopt an Integrated Nutrient Management (INM) approach, combining organic manures (Farm Yard Manure, compost) with chemical fertilizers to maintain soil health and fertility in the long term. Regular soil testing is the cornerstone of efficient nutrient management.
