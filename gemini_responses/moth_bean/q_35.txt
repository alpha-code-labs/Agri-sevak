As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the maturity signs, harvesting time, and cutting process for Moth Bean (Vigna aconitifolia) in Haryana:

### Maturity Signs for Moth Bean:

*   **Pod Colour Change:** The most prominent sign is when the pods change colour from green to yellow, eventually turning light brown or straw-coloured.
*   **Leaf Senescence:** The leaves of the plant will start to turn yellow, dry up, and begin to shed. The overall plant will appear dry and brittle.
*   **Seed Hardness:** The seeds inside the pods will become hard and firm. When you shake a mature pod, you should hear the seeds rattling inside.
*   **Overall Plant Dryness:** The entire plant will show signs of drying, indicating that it has completed its physiological maturity.

### Harvesting Time for Moth Bean:

*   **Optimal Pod Maturity:** Harvesting should commence when 80-90% of the pods on the plant have matured and dried, exhibiting the signs mentioned above.
*   **Days After Sowing (DAS):** Depending on the variety and prevailing weather conditions, moth bean typically matures and is ready for harvest between 60 to 90 days after sowing.
*   **Weather Conditions:** It is crucial to harvest during dry weather. Avoid harvesting immediately after rain or during periods of high humidity, as this can lead to spoilage and hinder proper drying.
*   **Time of Day:** Harvesting in the early morning hours is often recommended, especially if the crop is very dry, to minimize pod shattering and seed loss.

### Cutting Process for Moth Bean:

*   **Manual Harvesting:** Moth bean is predominantly harvested manually in Haryana. The entire plant is cut close to the ground level using a sickle.
*   **Bundling and Drying:** After cutting, the plants are gathered into small bundles and left in the field for 2-3 days under direct sunlight. This post-harvest drying is essential to further reduce the moisture content of the pods and seeds, making threshing easier and preventing storage losses.
*   **Threshing:** Once sufficiently dried, the bundles are transported to the threshing yard. Threshing can be done manually by beating the dried plants with sticks or mechanically using a thresher specifically designed or adjusted for pulse crops.
*   **Winnowing:** After threshing, the mixture of grains and chaff is winnowed to separate the clean moth bean seeds.
*   **Storage Moisture:** For safe storage, the moisture content of the seeds should be brought down to 8-10%.
