Moth Bean (Vigna aconitifolia) is a hardy and drought-tolerant legume well-suited to the semi-arid and arid regions, making it an excellent choice for cultivation in Haryana.

Here are the suitable climate, soil type, and drainage requirements for Moth Bean:

**Climate:**
*   **Temperature:** Moth Bean thrives in warm to hot climates. The optimal temperature range for its growth and development is between 25°C and 32°C. It can tolerate high temperatures up to 40°C, which is common during the monsoon season in Haryana.
*   **Rainfall:** It is primarily grown as a rainfed *kharif* crop. It requires low to moderate rainfall, typically between 250-750 mm annually. Its exceptional drought tolerance allows it to perform well even in areas with erratic and scanty rainfall, making it highly suitable for the dryland farming systems of Haryana.
*   **Sunshine:** Moth Bean requires abundant sunshine for optimal growth and photosynthesis.

**Soil Type:**
*   **Texture:** Moth Bean prefers light-textured soils. Well-drained sandy to sandy loam soils are ideal. It can also grow in loamy sands and light loams. Heavy clay soils are generally not suitable due to their poor drainage and aeration.
*   **pH:** It can tolerate a wide range of soil pH, but an optimal range of 6.0 to 8.0 is preferred for best yields. It is also known to tolerate slightly alkaline and saline soils to some extent.
*   **Fertility:** While it can grow in soils of low to moderate fertility, a moderate level of organic matter improves soil structure and nutrient availability, benefiting the crop.

**Drainage Requirement:**
*   **Well-drained soils are crucial.** Moth Bean is highly sensitive to waterlogging conditions. Stagnant water can severely impede root development, lead to root rot, and significantly reduce yield or even cause crop failure. Therefore, fields must have good surface and subsurface drainage to prevent water accumulation, especially during periods of heavy rainfall.
