As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Moth Bean in Haryana:

**1. Grasshopper Control in Moth Bean:**

Grasshoppers are polyphagous pests that can cause significant defoliation in Moth Bean, especially during early growth stages. Severe infestations can lead to reduced plant vigor and yield.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural/Mechanical:**
    *   Regular field monitoring to detect infestations early.
    *   Hand picking and destroying grasshopper nymphs and adults in small areas, especially during the early morning when they are less active.
    *   Maintaining field sanitation and removing weeds that can serve as alternate hosts.

*   **Chemical Control (Apply when infestation reaches economic threshold):**
    *   Spray with one of the following CIBRC approved insecticides:
        *   **Malathion** 50 EC at 1.0 - 1.25 L per acre in 200-250 L of water.
        *   **Quinalphos** 25 EC at 1.0 - 1.25 L per acre in 200-250 L of water.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5 EC at 100 - 120 ml per acre in 200-250 L of water.
        *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20 EC at 1.0 - 1.25 L per acre in 200-250 L of water.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the label instructions for any pesticide.
*   Observe pre-harvest intervals (PHI) to ensure food safety.
*   Consider integrated pest management (IPM) approaches, combining cultural, mechanical, and chemical methods for sustainable control.

**2. Painted bug:**
This is not known to affect Moth Bean.

**3. Red cotton bug:**
This is not known to affect Moth Bean.

**4. Black ants:**
This is not known to affect Moth Bean as a direct pest causing significant damage. If ants are observed tending to other sap-sucking pests like aphids or mealybugs, the primary control should be directed at those sap-sucking pests.
