As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend a comprehensive approach to address micronutrient deficiencies in Moth Bean, emphasizing the importance of prior soil testing for accurate diagnosis and precise recommendations.

Here's how to address the specified micronutrient deficiencies:

### General Recommendation:
Always conduct a soil test to confirm the specific deficiency and its severity. Foliar applications are generally effective for quick correction of visible symptoms, while soil applications provide a more sustained supply.

### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency
Zinc deficiency is common in Moth Bean, especially in alkaline and calcareous soils prevalent in Haryana, leading to significant yield losses.

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, small leaves (little leaf symptom), interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, and bronzing of older leaves.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application (Preventive):** Apply 25 kg/acre of **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** at the time of sowing.
    *   **Foliar Application (Curative):** If symptoms appear, spray a 0.5% solution (5 g/L) of **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** mixed with 0.25% (2.5 g/L) of unslaked lime (calcium hydroxide) to neutralize acidity. Alternatively, use a 0.1% solution (1 g/L) of **Chelated Zinc (Zn-EDTA)**. Apply at the pre-flowering or early vegetative stage. Repeat after 10-15 days if symptoms persist.

### 2. Iron (Fe) / Ferrous Deficiency
Iron deficiency, often termed 'lime-induced chlorosis', is a common problem in Moth Bean grown in high pH (alkaline) soils of Haryana.

*   **Symptoms:** Prominent interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) of young leaves, while the veins remain distinctly green. In severe cases, entire leaves turn yellow or whitish, and growth is severely stunted.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray a 0.5% solution (5 g/L) of **Ferrous Sulphate** at the early vegetative stage or when symptoms first appear. Repeat 2-3 times at 7-10 day intervals for effective recovery. For highly alkaline soils or severe deficiency, a 0.1% solution (1 g/L) of **Chelated Iron (Fe-EDTA)** can be more effective.

### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency
Boron is crucial for flowering, pollen viability, and seed development in Moth Bean.

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, thickening and brittleness of young leaves, poor flower and pod set, malformed pods, and sometimes internal necrosis of stems.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application (Preventive, if soil test indicates low B):** Apply 1-2 kg/acre of **Borax (Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate)** at sowing. Exercise caution as the margin between deficiency and toxicity is narrow.
    *   **Foliar Application (Curative):** Spray a 0.1-0.2% solution (1-2 g/L) of **Borax** or **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** at the pre-flowering stage.

### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency
Calcium is essential for cell wall structure, root development, and nodulation in Moth Bean. While Haryana soils are generally not calcium deficient, specific conditions or high potassium levels can induce it.

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, curling and distortion of young leaves, necrosis (death) of growing points, poor root development, and reduced nodulation.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application (if soil test indicates low Ca or sodicity):** Apply **Gypsum (Calcium Sulphate)** as per soil test recommendations, especially in sodic soils common in parts of Haryana.
    *   **Foliar Application (Curative):** Spray a 0.5-1.0% solution (5-10 g/L) of **Calcium Nitrate** or **Calcium Chloride** at the early vegetative stage or pre-flowering.

### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency
Magnesium is a vital component of chlorophyll, essential for photosynthesis in Moth Bean.

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis of older leaves, where the veins remain green but the tissue between them turns yellow. Symptoms often start from the leaf margins and progress inwards. Leaves may become brittle.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application (if severe deficiency):** Apply 10-20 kg/acre of **Magnesium Sulphate** at the time of sowing.
    *   **Foliar Application (Curative):** Spray a 0.5-1.0% solution (5-10 g/L) of **Magnesium Sulphate** when symptoms appear. Repeat after 10-15 days if necessary.

### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency
Manganese deficiency can occur in Moth Bean, particularly in alkaline soils, affecting photosynthesis and enzyme activity.

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis of young leaves, similar to iron deficiency but often with a finer network of green veins. In severe cases, brown spots or streaks may appear on the leaves.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application (if severe deficiency and soil test indicates):** Apply 10-15 kg/acre of **Manganese Sulphate** at the time of sowing.
    *   **Foliar Application (Curative):** Spray a 0.5% solution (5 g/L) of **Manganese Sulphate** when symptoms appear. Repeat after 10-15 days if needed. Alternatively, a 0.1% solution (1 g/L) of **Chelated Manganese (Mn-EDTA)** can be used for foliar spray.
