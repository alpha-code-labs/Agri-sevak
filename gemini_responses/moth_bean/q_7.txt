As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm the following regarding the diseases mentioned for Moth Bean:

*   **Dieback:** This is not known to affect Moth Bean as a specific disease. While parts of the plant may die back due to various stresses (e.g., water stress, nutrient deficiency, or other diseases like stem rot), "Dieback" as a primary disease requiring specific chemical control is not recognized for Moth Bean.
*   **Twig blight:** This is not known to affect Moth Bean. Moth Bean is an herbaceous plant and does not have "twigs" in the conventional sense that would be affected by twig blight diseases.
*   **Tikka disease:** This is not known to affect Moth Bean. Tikka disease is a specific common name for leaf spot diseases primarily affecting Groundnut (*Arachis hypogaea*). Moth Bean can be affected by other leaf spot diseases (e.g., *Cercospora* leaf spot), but these are not referred to as "Tikka disease."
