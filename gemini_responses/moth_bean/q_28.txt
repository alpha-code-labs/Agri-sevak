Moth Bean (Vigna aconitifolia) is renowned for its hardiness and drought tolerance, making it well-suited for the arid and semi-arid regions of Haryana. While it possesses inherent resilience, extreme environmental conditions can still impact its growth and yield. Here's how to protect your Moth Bean crop from various stresses:

### 1. Extreme Cold and Frost

Moth Bean is a warm-season Kharif crop, typically sown from June to August and harvested from September to November. Therefore, it generally avoids periods of extreme cold or frost during its main growth cycle in Haryana.

*   **Sowing Time:** Ensure timely sowing within the recommended Kharif window (June-July) to allow the crop to mature before the onset of winter cold. Late sowing might expose young plants or flowering stages to unseasonal cold snaps.
*   **Light Irrigation:** If unseasonal cold or a mild frost is anticipated, a light irrigation in the evening can help raise the soil temperature and protect the plants by releasing latent heat.
*   **Mulching:** Applying a layer of organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves) around the base of the plants can help insulate the soil and maintain a more stable root zone temperature.

### 2. Heat/Loo (Hot Winds) and Intense Sunlight

Moth Bean is tolerant to high temperatures and intense sunlight. However, prolonged periods of extreme heat, especially when combined with hot, dry winds (Loo) and water scarcity, can lead to flower drop, poor pod setting, and reduced yield. Intense sunlight, when coupled with water stress, can also cause scorching.

*   **Timely and Adequate Irrigation:** This is the most critical measure. Ensure the crop receives sufficient moisture, especially during critical growth stages like flowering and pod development. Timely irrigation helps plants cope with high temperatures and reduces the adverse effects of hot winds by maintaining turgor.
*   **Mulching:** Apply organic mulch to the soil surface to conserve soil moisture, reduce soil temperature fluctuations, and suppress weed growth, all of which help the plant cope with heat and intense sunlight.
*   **Windbreaks:** Where feasible, planting shelterbelts or windbreaks (e.g., rows of tall, fast-growing trees or shrubs) on the windward side of the field can significantly reduce the impact of hot, dry winds.
*   **Foliar Application of Nutrients:**
    *   A foliar spray of **Potassium Nitrate** can help improve the plant's physiological tolerance to heat and drought stress by enhancing water use efficiency and osmotic adjustment.
        *   **Dosage:** Spray 20 g of **Potassium Nitrate** per litre of water (2% solution) at the pre-flowering and pod development stages. Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.
