Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding sucking pests in Moth Bean. Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips are indeed significant pests that can cause considerable yield losses in Moth Bean (Vigna aconitifolia) in Haryana.

Regarding Psylla, this pest is primarily associated with fruit crops like citrus and mango and is **not known to affect Moth Bean**.

Here's a comprehensive approach to control Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips in Moth Bean:

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Timely Sowing:** Sow Moth Bean at the recommended time to avoid peak pest incidence periods.
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the field free from weeds, as many weeds act as alternate hosts for these pests.
    *   **Balanced Nutrition:** Avoid excessive nitrogenous fertilizers, which can lead to lush growth, making plants more attractive to sucking pests.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation to break the pest cycle.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Encourage natural enemies like ladybird beetles, lacewings, and syrphid flies, which prey on aphids and other soft-bodied insects. Avoid indiscriminate use of broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

3.  **Monitoring:**
    *   Regularly scout your fields, especially the undersides of leaves and tender shoots, to detect pest infestations early. Early detection allows for timely intervention.

**Chemical Control (As a last resort, when pest populations exceed economic threshold levels):**

When chemical intervention is necessary, choose CIBRC-approved insecticides and ensure proper application. Always use the recommended dosage and follow safety precautions.

For effective control of Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips, you can consider the following CIBRC-approved technical chemicals:

*   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply 125 ml per acre.
*   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply 100 g per acre.
*   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply 80-100 g per acre.
*   **Dimethoate 30% EC:** Apply 300-400 ml per acre.
*   For specific control of whitefly nymphs: **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply 500-600 ml per acre.

**Important Considerations for Spraying:**

*   **Water Volume:** Ensure thorough coverage by using an adequate volume of water, typically 200-250 litres per acre, depending on the crop canopy.
*   **Spray Timing:** Spray during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   **Safety:** Always wear protective clothing (gloves, mask, goggles) while mixing and spraying insecticides. Wash hands thoroughly after handling chemicals.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Observe the recommended pre-harvest interval for each insecticide to ensure the produce is safe for consumption.

By adopting these integrated strategies, you can effectively manage sucking pests in your Moth Bean crop and ensure a healthy yield. For any further specific queries, please consult your local agricultural extension officer or the scientists at HAU.
