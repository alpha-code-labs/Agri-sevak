As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I must clarify that **transplantation is generally not recommended or ideal for Moth Bean (Vigna aconitifolia)**.

Moth Bean is a pulse crop with a well-developed taproot system that is sensitive to disturbance. Transplanting can lead to:
*   **Transplant shock:** This can severely stunt growth and reduce yield.
*   **Delayed maturity:** The crop takes longer to establish and mature.
*   **Increased cost and labor:** Transplanting is labor-intensive and not economically viable for a field crop like Moth Bean.

Therefore, Moth Bean is almost exclusively grown by **direct sowing**. Below are the ideal recommendations for direct sowing in Haryana:

### Ideal Direct Sowing Time, Distance, and Process for Moth Bean

**1. Ideal Sowing Time:**
*   **Kharif Season:** First fortnight of July, coinciding with the onset of the monsoon rains. Early July sowing generally provides the best yields.

**2. Ideal Sowing Distance:**
*   **Row-to-Row Spacing:** 30-45 cm
*   **Plant-to-Plant Spacing:** 10-15 cm (achieved by maintaining appropriate seed rate and thinning if necessary)

**3. Ideal Sowing Process:**

*   **Land Preparation:**
    *   Perform one deep ploughing followed by 1-2 harrowing or cultivations to achieve a fine, firm, and well-pulverized seedbed.
    *   Level the field properly to ensure uniform germination and efficient water management.

*   **Seed Rate:**
    *   For pure crop: 15-20 kg/acre
    *   For intercropping: 5-8 kg/acre (depending on the intercropping system)

*   **Seed Treatment:**
    *   **Fungicide Treatment:** To protect against seed-borne diseases, treat seeds with:
        *   **Carbendazim** @ 1 g/kg seed, OR
        *   **Thiram** @ 2.5 g/kg seed.
    *   **Insecticide Treatment (Optional, for early pest protection):** If early sucking pest incidence is anticipated, treat seeds with:
        *   **Imidacloprid** @ 5 g/kg seed.
    *   **Rhizobium Inoculation:** After fungicide/insecticide treatment (and ensuring the seeds are dry), treat seeds with a specific *Rhizobium* culture (200 g/10-15 kg seed). This enhances nitrogen fixation. Allow the seeds to dry in the shade before sowing.

*   **Sowing Depth:**
    *   Sow seeds at a depth of 3-5 cm. Deeper sowing can delay emergence, while shallower sowing can lead to poor germination due to moisture stress.

*   **Sowing Method:**
    *   Use a seed drill for uniform spacing, depth, and efficient seed placement. This ensures better germination and plant stand compared to broadcasting.
