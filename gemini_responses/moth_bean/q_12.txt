Yes, Scale insects and Mealybugs are known to affect Moth Bean (Vigna aconitifolia) and can cause significant damage if not managed properly.

Here's a scientifically verified approach for their control in Haryana:

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategy:**

1.  **Monitoring and Early Detection:** Regularly inspect plants, especially the undersides of leaves, stems, and growing points, for the presence of scale insects (small, immobile bumps) and mealybugs (white, cottony masses). Early detection is crucial for effective control.
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy severely infested plant parts or entire plants to prevent further spread.
    *   **Weed Management:** Control weeds in and around the field, as they can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
    *   **Proper Nutrition:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush growth that is more attractive to sucking pests.
3.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Encourage natural enemies such as ladybird beetles (predators) and parasitic wasps (parasitoids) by minimizing the use of broad-spectrum insecticides.
    *   If available, release commercially reared natural enemies.
4.  **Chemical Control (as a last resort and when infestation levels are high):**
    When chemical intervention is necessary, choose systemic insecticides or insect growth regulators (IGRs) that can penetrate the waxy coating of mealybugs and scales. Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and stems.

    *   **For Mealybugs and Scale Insects:**
        *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at 1.25 litres per hectare (or 2.5 ml per litre of water). This is an insect growth regulator that primarily affects nymphs.
        *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at 125-150 ml per hectare (or 0.25-0.3 ml per litre of water). This is a systemic insecticide effective against sucking pests.
        *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at 100 grams per hectare (or 0.2 grams per litre of water). This is another systemic insecticide.
        *   **Dimethoate 30% EC:** Apply at 660 ml per hectare (or 1.3 ml per litre of water). This is a systemic and contact insecticide.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Rotation of Chemicals:** To prevent the development of resistance, rotate insecticides with different modes of action.
*   **Spray Coverage:** Ensure complete and thorough coverage of the plant, especially the hidden parts where these pests tend to aggregate. A high-volume sprayer with a fine mist nozzle is recommended.
*   **Adjuvants:** Consider adding a spreading agent (sticker/spreader) to the spray solution to improve coverage and penetration, especially for waxy pests.
*   **Safety:** Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label, including dosage, application timing, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and safety precautions. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).
*   **Consult Local Experts:** For specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and current pest pressure, consult with the agricultural extension officers at HAU or the nearest Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK).
