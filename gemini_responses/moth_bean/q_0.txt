Namaste, Kisan Bhaiyon! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I am here to provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing fungal diseases in Moth Bean (Vigna aconitifolia) in Haryana.

Effective management of fungal diseases involves an integrated approach combining cultural practices and timely chemical interventions.

**General Management Principles for Fungal Diseases in Moth Bean:**

1.  **Resistant Varieties:** Whenever possible, choose Moth Bean varieties known for their resistance or tolerance to common fungal diseases prevalent in your area.
2.  **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-leguminous crops to break the disease cycle and reduce inoculum build-up in the soil.
3.  **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest to reduce primary inoculum for the next season.
4.  **Timely Sowing:** Adhere to recommended sowing dates to avoid periods of high humidity and temperature that favor disease development.
5.  **Optimum Plant Spacing:** Maintain recommended plant spacing to ensure good air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce humidity and disease spread.
6.  **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced fertilization. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can lead to lush growth susceptible to fungal infections.
7.  **Weed Control:** Keep fields free of weeds, as they can act as alternate hosts for pathogens and impede air circulation.

Now, let's address the specific fungal diseases you've mentioned:

*   **Alternaria (Alternaria Leaf Spot):**
    *   This is a common fungal disease affecting Moth Bean, causing dark brown spots on leaves, often with concentric rings.
    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   Spray with **Mancozeb** 75% WP at 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L of water).
        *   Alternatively, use **Chlorothalonil** 75% WP at 1.0-1.25 kg/acre (or 2.0-2.5 g/L of water).
        *   For systemic action, **Propiconazole** 25% EC at 250-500 ml/acre (or 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water) or **Tebuconazole** 25.9% EC at 250-500 ml/acre (or 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water) can be effective.

*   **Anthracnose:**
    *   Anthracnose, caused by *Colletotrichum truncatum*, can affect leaves, stems, and pods, leading to sunken lesions with dark borders.
    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   Seed treatment with **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 2 g/kg of seed can help prevent early infection.
        *   For foliar spray, use **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 250-500 g/acre (or 0.5-1.0 g/L of water).
        *   Alternatively, **Mancozeb** 75% WP at 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L of water) or **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC at 200-300 ml/acre (or 0.4-0.6 ml/L of water) are also effective.

*   **Blast:**
    *   This is not known to affect Moth Bean. Blast is primarily a disease of cereals like rice.

*   **Blight (e.g., Cercospora Leaf Blight, Rhizoctonia Blight):**
    *   Various blights can cause significant damage to Moth Bean. Symptoms include irregular spots, lesions, and defoliation.
    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   For leaf blights, **Mancozeb** 75% WP at 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L of water) or **Chlorothalonil** 75% WP at 1.0-1.25 kg/acre (or 2.0-2.5 g/L of water) are good protective options.
        *   Systemic fungicides like **Propiconazole** 25% EC at 250-500 ml/acre (or 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water) or **Tebuconazole** 25.9% EC at 250-500 ml/acre (or 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water) can also be used.

*   **Brown Spot (Cercospora Leaf Spot):**
    *   Caused by *Cercospora* species, this disease manifests as small, circular to irregular brown spots on leaves, often with a reddish-brown margin.
    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   Similar to Alternaria and Blight, **Mancozeb** 75% WP at 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L of water) or **Chlorothalonil** 75% WP at 1.0-1.25 kg/acre (or 2.0-2.5 g/L of water) are effective.
        *   Systemic options include **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 250-500 g/acre (or 0.5-1.0 g/L of water) or **Propiconazole** 25% EC at 250-500 ml/acre (or 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water).

*   **Downy Mildew:**
    *   Downy mildew can occur in Moth Bean, causing yellowish patches on the upper leaf surface and a grayish-purplish fungal growth on the underside.
    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   Spray with **Mancozeb** 75% WP at 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L of water).
        *   For systemic and contact action, a combination product of **Metalaxyl 8% + Mancozeb 64% WP** at 1.0-1.25 kg/acre (or 2.0-2.5 g/L of water) is highly effective.

*   **Powdery Mildew:**
    *   This is a very common and significant disease in Moth Bean, characterized by white, powdery patches on leaves, stems, and pods.
    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   **Wettable Sulphur** 80% WP at 2.0-2.5 kg/acre (or 3.0-5.0 g/L of water) is a cost-effective and widely used option.
        *   Systemic fungicides like **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 250-500 g/acre (or 0.5-1.0 g/L of water).
        *   **Propiconazole** 25% EC at 250-500 ml/acre (or 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water) or **Tebuconazole** 25.9% EC at 250-500 ml/acre (or 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water) are also highly effective.

*   **Grey Mildew:**
    *   This is not known to affect Moth Bean as a distinct disease. Symptoms that might be described as "grey mildew" are often associated with other leaf spot diseases like Cercospora.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the fungicide label regarding dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Ensure thorough spray coverage for effective disease control.
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of fungicide resistance.
*   Monitor your crop regularly for early signs of disease to enable timely intervention.
*   For specific local recommendations and to confirm disease diagnosis, please consult your nearest Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or agricultural extension officer.

By adopting these practices, you can effectively manage fungal diseases and ensure a healthy and productive Moth Bean crop.
