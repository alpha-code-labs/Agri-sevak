As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice to improve yield, fruit quality, and storage life for Moth Bean (Vigna aconitifolia) in Haryana:

### I. Improving Yield for Moth Bean

To maximize the yield of Moth Bean, focus on the following practices:

*   **1. Variety Selection:**
    *   Choose high-yielding, disease-resistant varieties recommended for Haryana, such as HFM-612, RMO-40, RMO-257, or CZM-3.
*   **2. Optimal Sowing Time:**
    *   Sow during the first fortnight of July for optimal growth and yield under Haryana conditions.
*   **3. Seed Treatment:**
    *   Treat seeds before sowing to protect against early diseases and pests, and to enhance nutrient uptake:
        *   Fungicide: Treat with **Carbendazim** (1 g/kg seed) + **Thiram** (2 g/kg seed) or **Carboxin** (2 g/kg seed).
        *   Insecticide: Treat with **Imidacloprid** (5-7 ml/kg seed) to protect against sucking pests in early stages.
        *   Bio-fertilizers: Inoculate seeds with Rhizobium culture (200 g/10-15 kg seed) and Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria (PSB) culture (200 g/10-15 kg seed) for improved nitrogen fixation and phosphorus availability.
*   **4. Nutrient Management:**
    *   Apply fertilizers based on soil test recommendations. In the absence of a soil test, a general recommendation is:
        *   Basal Application: 10-15 kg Nitrogen, 30-40 kg Phosphorus, and 20 kg Potassium per acre. This can be achieved by applying approximately 50-75 kg Diammonium Phosphate (DAP) and 30 kg Muriate of Potash (MOP) per acre.
        *   Micronutrients: If soil is deficient in Zinc, apply Zinc Sulphate (10 kg/acre) as a basal dose. Alternatively, a foliar spray of Zinc Sulphate (0.5%) mixed with Urea (0.25%) can be applied at the flowering stage.
*   **5. Weed Management:**
    *   Effective weed control is crucial for yield.
        *   Pre-emergence Herbicide: Apply **Pendimethalin** (1.0 L/acre) within 2-3 days after sowing.
        *   Post-emergence Herbicide: For broad-leaf weeds, apply **Imazethapyr** (200 ml/acre) at 20-25 days after sowing (DAS). For grassy weeds, apply **Quizalofop-ethyl** (400 ml/acre).
        *   Manual Weeding: Perform 1-2 manual weedings at 20-25 DAS and 40-45 DAS, if necessary.
*   **6. Pest and Disease Management:**
    *   Monitor crops regularly and take timely action against common pests and diseases:
        *   **Yellow Mosaic Virus (YMV):** Control the whitefly vector by spraying **Imidacloprid** (200 ml/acre) or **Thiamethoxam** (100 g/acre) at early stages.
        *   **Pod Borer:** At pod initiation, if infestation is observed, spray **Chlorantraniliprole** (60 ml/acre) or **Lambda-cyhalothrin** (200 ml/acre).
        *   **Powdery Mildew:** If symptoms appear, spray **Wettable Sulphur** (2.5 kg/acre) or **Carbendazim** (200 g/acre).

### II. Improving Fruit Quality (Pods/Grains) for Moth Bean

High-quality grains are a direct result of healthy plant growth and proper management:

*   **1. Balanced Nutrition:**
    *   Ensure adequate supply of Phosphorus, Potassium, and micronutrients like Boron. Boron deficiency can affect grain filling; a foliar spray of Borax (0.2%) can be applied if deficiency symptoms are observed.
*   **2. Effective Pest and Disease Control:**
    *   Healthy plants free from pests and diseases produce well-filled, blemish-free grains. Timely control of pod borers is critical as they directly damage the developing grains.
*   **3. Timely Harvest:**
    *   Harvest the crop when 80-85% of the pods have matured and turned yellow/brown. Harvesting too early results in shriveled grains, while delayed harvesting can lead to shattering and quality deterioration.

### III. Improving Storage Life for Moth Bean

Proper post-harvest handling and storage are essential to minimize losses and extend the shelf life of Moth Bean grains:

*   **1. Proper Drying:**
    *   Immediately after harvest, dry the grains to a safe moisture content of 8-10%. This is the most critical step to prevent fungal growth and insect infestation during storage.
*   **2. Cleaning and Grading:**
    *   Thoroughly clean the grains to remove chaff, dust, immature grains, broken grains, and any insect-damaged grains before storage. This reduces the inoculum for pests and diseases.
*   **3. Storage Structures:**
    *   Store grains in clean, dry, airtight, and rodent-proof storage structures such as metal bins, improved mud bins, or Pusa bins. Ensure the storage area is well-ventilated and free from moisture.
*   **4. Pest Management in Storage:**
    *   **Fumigation:** For large-scale storage, fumigation with **Aluminium Phosphide** tablets (1-2 tablets/tonne) can be done by trained personnel in airtight conditions.
    *   **Prophylactic Treatment of Storage Structures:** Before storing grains, spray the walls and floor of empty godowns/storage structures with **Deltamethrin** (2.5% EC @ 10 ml/L water) or **Malathion** (50% EC @ 10 ml/L water).
    *   **Regular Inspection:** Periodically inspect stored grains for any signs of moisture, insect infestation, or fungal growth. Take immediate corrective action if any issues are detected.
