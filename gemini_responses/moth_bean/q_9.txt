Mites, including Red spider mite (Tetranychus urticae) and various Rust mites (e.g., Aceria spp.), are known to affect Moth Bean (Vigna aconitifolia) in Haryana, especially during dry and warm weather conditions. They cause damage by sucking sap from leaves, leading to yellowing, bronzing, leaf distortion, and reduced plant vigour and yield.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Mites in Moth Bean:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy weed hosts and crop residues that can harbour mites.
    *   **Proper Irrigation:** Mites thrive in dry conditions. Adequate irrigation can help reduce mite populations. Avoid water stress.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate Moth Bean with non-host crops to break the pest cycle.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Maintain balanced fertilization, as excessive nitrogen can sometimes favour mite multiplication.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Conserve natural enemies such as predatory mites (e.g., *Amblyseius* spp.), lacewings, and ladybird beetles, which feed on pest mites. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

3.  **Chemical Control (Acaricides):**
    When mite populations reach economic threshold levels, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where mites are most prevalent. Rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development. The following CIBRC approved technical chemicals are recommended:

    *   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** Apply at 0.5 ml per litre of water (approximately 125 ml per acre, assuming 250 litres of water).
    *   **Fenpyroximate 5% SC:** Apply at 1.0-1.2 ml per litre of water (approximately 250-300 ml per acre, assuming 250 litres of water).
    *   **Propargite 57% EC:** Apply at 1.5-2.0 ml per litre of water (approximately 375-500 ml per acre, assuming 250 litres of water).
    *   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP:** Apply at 2.0-3.0 g per litre of water (approximately 500-750 g per acre, assuming 250 litres of water). This is particularly effective against rust mites and can be used as a preventive measure or for early infestations.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Spray Coverage:** Mites are often found on the undersides of leaves, so ensure thorough spray coverage for effective control.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in mite populations.
*   **Timing:** Early detection and timely application are crucial for effective mite control.
*   **Safety:** Always read and follow the instructions on the product label, including safety precautions, dosage, and pre-harvest interval (PHI). Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).
