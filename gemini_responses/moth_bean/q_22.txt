As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following cultivation practices for Moth Bean (Vigna aconitifolia) in Haryana:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   Moth Bean is typically sown directly in the field.
    *   **Drilling** is the recommended method for sowing, ensuring uniform seed distribution and proper depth. This facilitates better stand establishment and allows for inter-cultivation operations.
    *   Sowing should be done in **rows**.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   The optimal planting depth for Moth Bean seeds is **3-5 cm**. This ensures good germination and emergence, especially under rainfed conditions.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   **Row-to-Row Spacing:** Maintain a distance of **45 cm** between rows.
    *   **Plant-to-Plant Spacing:** After thinning, aim for a plant-to-plant distance of **10-15 cm** within the rows to achieve an optimal plant population.

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   For grain production, a seed dose of **12-15 kg/acre** is recommended.
    *   (Note: If cultivating for fodder purposes, a higher seed rate of 20-25 kg/acre might be used, but the above recommendation is for grain.)
