Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the critical importance of effective weed management for maximizing Moth Bean (Vigna aconitifolia) yields in Haryana. Weeds compete with the crop for nutrients, water, and sunlight, especially during the initial 30-45 days after sowing.

Here's a scientifically verified approach to control the specified weeds in Moth Bean:

**General Weed Management Strategy for Moth Bean:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Clean Seed:** Always use certified, weed-free Moth Bean seed.
    *   **Timely Sowing:** Sowing at the optimal time (usually July in Haryana) allows the crop to establish well and compete better with weeds.
    *   **Proper Seedbed Preparation:** A well-prepared, fine seedbed helps in uniform germination and reduces initial weed pressure.
    *   **Inter-cultivation/Manual Weeding:** One or two manual weedings or light hoeing operations at 20-25 and 40-45 days after sowing (DAS) are highly effective, especially for broadleaf weeds and for managing weeds that escape herbicide application.

2.  **Chemical Control (Herbicide Application):**
    *   Always ensure proper calibration of sprayers and uniform application.
    *   Use adequate water volume (typically 200-300 litres per acre) for effective herbicide coverage.
    *   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application.

**Specific Weed Control Recommendations for Moth Bean:**

**1. Broadleaf Weeds (e.g., Bathu, Congress grass, other common broadleaf weeds):**
*   **Pre-emergence Application (within 3 days of sowing):**
    *   Apply **Pendimethalin** 30% EC at 1.0 kg active ingredient (a.i.) per acre (approximately 3.3 litres of product per acre) mixed in 200-300 litres of water. This herbicide provides good control of many annual broadleaf and narrowleaf weeds by forming a chemical barrier in the soil.
*   **Post-emergence Application (15-20 DAS):**
    *   For control of a wide spectrum of broadleaf and narrowleaf weeds, apply **Imazethapyr** 10% SL at 75-100 g a.i. per acre (approximately 750-1000 ml of product per acre) mixed in 200-300 litres of water. Apply when weeds are at 2-4 leaf stage.
    *   **Manual weeding** at 20-25 DAS is highly effective for controlling broadleaf weeds like Bathu (Chenopodium album) and Congress grass (Parthenium hysterophorus) that may escape pre-emergence herbicides or emerge later.

**2. Narrowleaf Weeds (Grasses):**
*   **Pre-emergence Application (within 3 days of sowing):**
    *   Apply **Pendimethalin** 30% EC at 1.0 kg a.i. per acre (approximately 3.3 litres of product per acre) mixed in 200-300 litres of water, as mentioned above. This will control many annual grasses.
*   **Post-emergence Application (15-20 DAS):**
    *   For specific control of narrowleaf weeds (grasses), apply a graminicide when grasses are at the 2-4 leaf stage:
        *   **Quizalofop-ethyl** 5% EC at 50 g a.i. per acre (approximately 1.0 litre of product per acre) mixed in 200-300 litres of water.
        *   **Fenoxaprop-p-ethyl** 9% EC at 45-50 g a.i. per acre (approximately 500-550 ml of product per acre) mixed in 200-300 litres of water.
    *   These graminicides are highly effective against annual grasses and are safe for Moth Bean.

**3. Amarbail (Cuscuta spp.):**
*   **Preventive Measures:**
    *   The most crucial step is to use clean, certified Moth Bean seed free from Cuscuta seeds.
    *   Avoid planting Moth Bean in fields known to be heavily infested with Amarbail.
*   **Pre-emergence Application:**
    *   **Pendimethalin** 30% EC (as mentioned above) can offer some suppression of germinating Cuscuta seeds.
*   **Post-emergence Application:**
    *   Manual removal of infested Moth Bean plants along with the Cuscuta strands is the most effective method for small patches. This should be done before Cuscuta produces seeds.
    *   **Imazethapyr** 10% SL (as mentioned above) applied at 15-20 DAS can provide some control of germinating Cuscuta seedlings, but it is not a complete solution for established infestations.

**4. Orobanche:**
*   This is not known to affect Moth Bean significantly as a major parasitic weed in Haryana. Moth Bean is generally considered less susceptible to Orobanche compared to other host crops.

**5. Phalaris minor:**
*   This is not known to affect Moth Bean. *Phalaris minor* (Little seed canary grass) is primarily a weed of Rabi (winter) crops, particularly wheat, and is not a concern in Kharif (monsoon) crops like Moth Bean.
