As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding rust diseases in Moth Bean for Haryana.

Please note the specific types of rusts mentioned:

*   **Black Rust (Stem Rust):** This is not known to affect Moth Bean. This disease is primarily associated with cereal crops like wheat.
*   **Brown Rust (Leaf Rust):** This is not known to affect Moth Bean. This disease is primarily associated with cereal crops like wheat.
*   **Yellow Rust (Stripe Rust):** This is not known to affect Moth Bean. This disease is primarily associated with cereal crops like wheat.
*   **White Rust:** This is not known to affect Moth Bean. White rust is caused by *Albugo* species and primarily affects cruciferous crops (e.g., mustard) and some other vegetables.
*   **Red Rust:** While "Red Rust" is not a specific scientific name for a rust disease in Moth Bean, it is often used to describe the common rust disease caused by *Uromyces vignae* or *Uromyces appendiculatus*, which produces reddish-brown pustules on the leaves. This is the primary rust disease affecting Moth Bean.

Therefore, the control measures below are specifically for the common rust disease (caused by *Uromyces* species) in Moth Bean.

### Control Measures for Rust Disease in Moth Bean (*Uromyces* species)

Effective management of rust in Moth Bean involves an integrated approach combining cultural practices and timely chemical intervention.

**I. Cultural Practices:**

1.  **Resistant Varieties:** Where available and suitable for the Haryana agro-climatic conditions, planting rust-resistant or tolerant varieties is the most economical and environmentally friendly method. Consult with HAU extension services for recommended varieties.
2.  **Crop Rotation:** Avoid continuous cultivation of Moth Bean or other susceptible legumes in the same field. A rotation with non-host crops for at least 2-3 years can help reduce inoculum build-up in the soil.
3.  **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest. This reduces the primary inoculum for the next season.
4.  **Optimum Plant Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to allow for good air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce humidity and makes conditions less favorable for rust development.
5.  **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced fertilization. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can lead to lush growth and increased susceptibility, and ensure adequate potassium, which can enhance plant resistance.

**II. Chemical Control (Fungicides):**

Fungicides should be applied preventively if rust is anticipated or at the very first appearance of symptoms. Repeat applications may be necessary based on disease severity and weather conditions. Always ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.

The following CIBRC approved technical chemical names are recommended:

*   **Propiconazole 25% EC:**
    *   **Dosage:** 250-500 ml per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water.
    *   **Application:** Apply at the first sign of disease and repeat after 10-15 days if necessary.
*   **Difenoconazole 25% EC:**
    *   **Dosage:** 150-200 ml per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water.
    *   **Application:** Effective against rusts, apply preventively or at early disease onset.
*   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:**
    *   **Dosage:** 200 ml per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water.
    *   **Application:** A broad-spectrum fungicide that provides good control of rusts.
*   **Mancozeb 75% WP:**
    *   **Dosage:** 600-800 g per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water.
    *   **Application:** A contact fungicide, effective as a preventive spray or in early stages of disease development. Can be alternated with systemic fungicides.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Timing:** Early detection and timely application of fungicides are crucial for effective control.
*   **Water Volume:** Always use the recommended volume of water (200-300 litres per acre) to ensure proper spray coverage.
*   **Safety:** Always read and follow the instructions on the fungicide label, including safety precautions, dosage, and pre-harvest interval (PHI). Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application.
*   **Resistance Management:** To prevent the development of fungicide resistance, it is advisable to rotate fungicides with different modes of action.
