As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), here are the scientifically verified recommendations for the use of Growth Regulators/Hormones in Moth Bean for Haryana:

### Recommended Dose of Growth Regulators/Hormones in Moth Bean

1.  **Ethrel (Ethephon)**
    *   **CIBRC Approved Technical Name:** **Ethephon**
    *   **Purpose:** To reduce flower drop, improve pod setting, and enhance overall yield in Moth Bean.
    *   **Recommended Dose:** Foliar spray of **Ethephon** at a concentration of 150-200 ppm (parts per million).
        *   For a common 39% SL (Soluble Liquid) formulation of **Ethephon**, this translates to approximately **0.4 - 0.5 ml per liter of water**.
        *   Alternatively, apply **150-200 ml of 39% Ethephon SL per acre**, mixed in 200-300 liters of water for thorough coverage.
    *   **Timing:** Apply at the pre-flowering or early flowering stage when the first few flowers have appeared.

2.  **2,4-D**
    *   **CIBRC Approved Technical Name:** **2,4-D**
    *   **Recommendation:** **2,4-D** is primarily a selective herbicide. While it can act as an auxin (growth regulator) at extremely low concentrations, its use as a growth regulator in Moth Bean is generally **not recommended** by Haryana Agricultural University. There are no established, safe, and consistently beneficial recommendations for its application as a growth regulator in Moth Bean due to the very high risk of phytotoxicity (damage to the crop) even with slight overdosing, which can severely impact yield.

3.  **Boron**
    *   **CIBRC Approved Technical Name:** **Boron** (applied as **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** or **Disodium tetraborate decahydrate**)
    *   **Purpose:** Boron is an essential micronutrient crucial for pollen germination, fertilization, and proper pod development. Its deficiency can lead to poor flower and pod set, resulting in reduced yields.
    *   **Recommended Dose:** Foliar spray of **Boron** at a concentration of 0.1% - 0.2%.
        *   If using **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (e.g., Solubor, typically containing 20.5% Boron): Mix **0.5 - 1.0 g per liter of water**.
        *   If using **Disodium tetraborate decahydrate** (e.g., Borax, typically containing 10.5% Boron): Mix **1.0 - 2.0 g per liter of water**.
    *   **Timing:** Apply at the pre-flowering or early flowering stage. A second spray can be given 10-15 days later if soil tests indicate severe deficiency or if deficiency symptoms persist.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always ensure uniform spray coverage for optimal results.
*   Use clean water for mixing.
*   Consult local agricultural extension officers for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and soil test results.
