Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU), Hisar, I advise you on the scientific management of pests in Moth Bean (Vigna aconitifolia). Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approaches, including regular field scouting, cultural practices, and judicious use of CIBRC-approved chemicals, are crucial for effective control.

Here's the advice for the pests you've mentioned:

### Control of Borers, Caterpillars, and Leaf Folder in Moth Bean

Borers (primarily pod borers like *Helicoverpa armigera*), various caterpillar species (e.g., semiloopers, leaf eaters), and leaf folders are significant pests in Moth Bean. Their management often involves similar chemical interventions due to their feeding habits.

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Practices:**
*   Regularly monitor your field for early signs of pest infestation.
*   Hand-pick and destroy visible larvae in small areas.
*   Install pheromone traps (e.g., for *Helicoverpa armigera*) at 5 traps per acre to monitor pest activity and for mass trapping.
*   Encourage natural enemies like parasitic wasps and predatory bugs by minimizing broad-spectrum pesticide use.

**2. Chemical Control (Apply only when pest population crosses Economic Threshold Level - ETL):**
For effective control of borers, caterpillars, and leaf folders, consider the following CIBRC-approved technical chemicals. Always ensure thorough spray coverage using 200-250 litres of water per acre. Rotate chemicals to prevent resistance development.

*   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** 60 ml per acre
*   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG:** 80-100 g per acre
*   **Flubendiamide 20% WG:** 50 g per acre
*   **Indoxacarb 14.5% SC:** 200 ml per acre
*   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** 200-250 ml per acre (Effective for early instar larvae and contact action)
*   **Quinalphos 25% EC:** 600-800 ml per acre (Broad-spectrum, for higher infestations)

### Diamondback Moth

This is not known to affect Moth Bean. The Diamondback moth (*Plutella xylostella*) is a specific pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., mustard, cabbage, cauliflower) and does not infest Moth Bean.

**Important Note:** Always read the label instructions carefully before using any pesticide. Adhere to recommended dosages, pre-harvest intervals, and safety precautions. For specific local recommendations, please consult your nearest Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or HAU extension specialist.
