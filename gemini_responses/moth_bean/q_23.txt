As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified seed and soil treatment processes for Moth Bean (Vigna aconitifolia) cultivation in Haryana:

### Recommended Seed Treatment Process for Moth Bean

Seed treatment is crucial for protecting young seedlings from early-season pests and diseases, and for enhancing nutrient uptake.

1.  **Fungal Protection:**
    *   To protect against seed-borne and early soil-borne fungal diseases like damping-off and root rot, treat seeds with a broad-spectrum fungicide.
    *   Apply **Carbendazim 12% + Mancozeb 63% WP** @ 2.5-3 grams per kilogram of seed.
    *   Alternatively, **Thiram 75% WS** @ 2.5-3 grams per kilogram of seed can be used.

2.  **Insect Protection:**
    *   To provide early protection against sucking pests (e.g., aphids, jassids) and shoot fly, an insecticide seed treatment is recommended.
    *   Apply **Imidacloprid 600 FS** @ 5-7 ml per kilogram of seed.
    *   Alternatively, **Thiamethoxam 30% FS** @ 5-7 ml per kilogram of seed can be used.

3.  **Bio-fertilizers (Nutrient Enhancement):**
    *   Moth Bean is a legume, and inoculation with beneficial microbes is essential for nitrogen fixation and phosphate solubilization.
    *   **Rhizobium culture** @ 200-250 grams per 10-15 kilograms of seed.
    *   **PSB (Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria) culture** @ 200-250 grams per 10-15 kilograms of seed.

**Order of Application for Seed Treatment:**
It is important to apply the treatments in the correct sequence to ensure efficacy and prevent harm to beneficial microbes:
1.  First, apply the fungicide and allow the seeds to dry slightly.
2.  Next, apply the insecticide and allow the seeds to dry slightly.
3.  Finally, apply the bio-fertilizers (Rhizobium and PSB) and mix thoroughly. Sow the seeds immediately after treatment.

### Recommended Soil Treatment Process for Moth Bean

Soil treatment focuses on managing soil-borne diseases, pests, and improving soil health.

1.  **Management of Soil-borne Diseases (e.g., Root Rot, Wilt):**
    *   To suppress soil-borne fungal pathogens, incorporate bio-fungicides into the soil.
    *   Apply **Trichoderma viride 1% WP** or **Trichoderma harzianum 1% WP** @ 2.5 kilograms per acre. Mix the bio-fungicide with 50-100 kilograms of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost and broadcast evenly before the last ploughing or at the time of sowing.

2.  **Management of Soil-borne Insect Pests (e.g., Termites, White Grubs):**
    *   If there is a known history of termite or white grub infestation in the field, preventive soil treatment is advised.
    *   Apply **Fipronil 0.3% GR** @ 10-15 kilograms per acre, broadcasted and incorporated into the soil before sowing.
    *   Alternatively, **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** @ 2-4 litres per acre can be applied as a soil drench or mixed with irrigation water before sowing.

3.  **Management of Nematodes:**
    *   Moth Bean can be susceptible to root-knot nematodes. For their management, especially in fields with a history of nematode problems:
    *   Apply **Purpureocillium lilacinum 1% WP** (a bio-nematicide) @ 2.5 kilograms per acre. Mix with 50-100 kilograms of FYM or compost and incorporate into the soil before sowing, similar to Trichoderma application.

**Important Note:** Always ensure proper soil moisture for optimal activity of bio-agents (Trichoderma, Rhizobium, PSB, Purpureocillium). Follow all safety precautions and label instructions for chemical pesticides.
