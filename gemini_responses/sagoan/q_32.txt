As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding "Drying up" in Sagoan (*Tectona grandis*), which manifests as drying branches, leaves, fruits, and flowers. This is a general symptom that can be caused by various factors, both abiotic (environmental) and biotic (pests and diseases). Accurate diagnosis is crucial before implementing any management strategy.

Here's a comprehensive approach to address drying up in Sagoan:

**1. Initial Assessment and Diagnosis:**
Observe the pattern of drying:
*   Is it affecting the entire tree or specific branches?
*   Is it starting from the top, bottom, or randomly?
*   Are there any visible signs like cankers, holes, discolouration, or insect activity?
*   What are the recent weather conditions (drought, excessive rain)?

**2. Possible Causes and Management Strategies:**

**A. Abiotic Factors (Environmental Stress):**

*   **Water Stress (Drought):** This is a very common cause, especially during prolonged dry spells in Haryana. Teak, while somewhat drought-tolerant once established, can suffer severe stress leading to premature leaf drop, branch dieback, and reduced fruit/flower development.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Irrigation:** Provide regular and adequate irrigation, especially during dry periods and for young trees. Ensure the soil is moist but not waterlogged.
        *   **Mulching:** Apply organic mulch (e.g., straw, wood chips) around the base of the tree to conserve soil moisture, regulate soil temperature, and suppress weeds.

*   **Nutrient Deficiencies:** Lack of essential nutrients can lead to poor growth and drying symptoms.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Soil Testing:** Conduct a soil test to determine nutrient levels and pH.
        *   **Balanced Fertilization:** Based on soil test results, apply balanced fertilizers. Deficiencies in potassium, calcium, or micronutrients like boron can sometimes manifest as marginal necrosis or dieback.
        *   **Organic Matter:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure or compost to improve soil structure and nutrient availability.

*   **Soil Salinity/Alkalinity:** High salt content or alkaline pH can hinder water and nutrient uptake, leading to stress and drying.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Soil Amendments:** Based on soil test, apply gypsum for sodic soils or use acidifying fertilizers if pH is very high.
        *   **Leaching:** If salinity is an issue, ensure good drainage and occasional heavy irrigation to leach salts below the root zone.

*   **Root Damage/Waterlogging:** Mechanical damage to roots, or prolonged waterlogging leading to root suffocation and rot, can impair water uptake.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Avoid Damage:** Protect roots from mechanical injury during cultivation or construction.
        *   **Drainage:** Ensure proper drainage to prevent waterlogging, especially in heavy soils.

**B. Biotic Factors (Pests and Diseases):**

*   **Fungal Dieback and Root Rot:** Several fungal pathogens can cause dieback of branches or root rot, leading to wilting and drying of the entire tree or parts of it.
    *   **Symptoms:** Cankers on branches, discoloured wood, wilting leaves, drying branches, and eventual death of affected parts. Root rot often causes general decline, yellowing, and sudden wilting.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy all affected (dried, diseased) branches, cutting back into healthy wood. Sterilize pruning tools between cuts.
        *   **Sanitation:** Remove fallen leaves and debris from around the tree to reduce inoculum sources.
        *   **Fungicides (if severe and diagnosed):**
            *   For **Root Rot/Collar Rot** (drenching around the base):
                *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride** at 2-3 ml/L of water.
                *   **Metalaxyl-M + Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water.
            *   For **Foliar/Branch Dieback** (spraying after pruning):
                *   **Carbendazim** at 1 g/L of water.
                *   **Propiconazole** at 1 ml/L of water.

*   **Stem Borers:** Larvae of certain insects bore into the stem and branches, disrupting water and nutrient flow, leading to wilting and drying of branches above the point of attack.
    *   **Symptoms:** Presence of boreholes, frass (sawdust-like material) extruding from holes, wilting, and drying of branches.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy heavily infested branches.
        *   **Mechanical Removal:** If borers are detected in accessible areas, they can sometimes be physically removed using a wire.
        *   **Insecticides (if infestation is significant):**
            *   **Injection:** Inject a solution of **Chlorpyrifos** (2 ml/L water) or **Imidacloprid** (1 ml/L water) directly into the borer holes and seal them with mud or wax. This is effective for localized infestations.
            *   **Drenching (for young trees):** For systemic action in younger trees, drench the soil around the base with **Imidacloprid** at 1 ml/L of water.

**3. General Tree Health and Preventative Measures:**

*   **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate spacing between trees to allow for good air circulation and reduce competition for resources.
*   **Weed Control:** Keep the area around the tree free of weeds that compete for water and nutrients.
*   **Regular Monitoring:** Regularly inspect trees for any signs of stress, pests, or diseases to allow for early intervention.

**Important Note:**
Given the complexity of diagnosing tree problems, it is highly recommended to consult with the experts at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar) or your local Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) for an accurate diagnosis and specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions. Bring samples of affected branches, leaves, or photos for better assessment.
