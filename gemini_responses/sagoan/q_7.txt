As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Dieback, Twig blight, and Tikka disease in Sagoan (Teak) in Haryana.

### 1. Dieback and Twig Blight in Sagoan (Teak)

Dieback and Twig blight in Sagoan are often caused by fungal pathogens such as *Lasiodiplodia theobromae*, *Phomopsis* spp., and *Colletotrichum* spp. These conditions lead to the drying and death of twigs and branches, typically starting from the tip downwards.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Pruning:** Regularly inspect trees and prune affected twigs and branches immediately. Make cuts well below the visible symptoms into healthy wood.
    *   **Sanitation:** Collect and destroy all pruned diseased material by burning or deep burial to reduce the source of inoculum.
    *   **Tree Vigor:** Ensure proper tree health through adequate nutrition and irrigation, especially during dry periods, to enhance natural resistance. Avoid any stress conditions.
    *   **Air Circulation:** Maintain proper tree spacing to ensure good air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce humidity and fungal growth.

*   **Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
    *   **Wound Protection:** After pruning, apply a fungicidal paste to the cut surfaces to prevent new infections.
        *   **Carbendazim** (50% WP) mixed with water to form a thick paste.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** For active infections or as a preventive measure during high-risk periods (e.g., post-monsoon stress, or periods of high humidity and temperature).
        *   **Carbendazim** (50% WP) at 1 g/L of water.
        *   **Propiconazole** (25% EC) at 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Hexaconazole** (5% SC) at 1 ml/L of water.
        *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2 g/L of water (can be used as a protective spray).
        *   **Copper oxychloride** (50% WP) at 2.5 g/L of water (can be used as a protective spray).

    *   Apply sprays thoroughly to cover all affected and susceptible parts of the tree. Repeat applications as per product label recommendations, typically at 10-15 day intervals, depending on disease severity and weather conditions.

### 2. Tikka Disease in Sagoan (Teak)

This is not known to affect Sagoan. Tikka disease is primarily a foliar disease of groundnut (peanut) caused by *Cercospora arachidicola* and *Cercosporidium personatum*.
