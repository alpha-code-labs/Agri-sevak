Dear Farmer,

Controlling soil pests like termites and nematodes is crucial for the healthy establishment and growth of Sagoan (Teak) plantations. These pests can cause significant damage to the root system, leading to stunted growth, reduced vigor, and even plant mortality. Here's a scientifically verified approach for their management:

**1. Termite Control in Sagoan:**

Termites primarily attack the root system and the base of the stem, especially in young plants.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Ensure proper land preparation, removing all woody debris, stumps, and roots from the previous crop, which can serve as food sources for termites.
    *   Avoid planting in areas with known severe termite infestations without prior soil treatment.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Pre-planting Treatment:**
        *   Before planting Sagoan saplings, treat the planting pits or the entire field soil.
        *   **Chlorpyrifos** (20% EC formulation): Mix 2.5 litres of **Chlorpyrifos** in 500-1000 litres of water and drench the soil thoroughly in one acre, or apply 20 ml per planting pit mixed with 2-3 litres of water.
    *   **Post-planting Treatment (for existing plants):**
        *   If termite damage is observed in established plants, drench the soil around the base of the affected plants.
        *   **Chlorpyrifos** (20% EC formulation): Mix 2-4 ml of **Chlorpyrifos** per litre of water and drench 1-2 litres of this solution around the base of each affected plant, ensuring the solution penetrates the root zone. Repeat if necessary, especially during dry periods.

**2. Nematode (Root-knot) Control in Sagoan:**

Nematodes, particularly root-knot nematodes, cause galls or knots on the roots, impairing water and nutrient uptake, leading to yellowing, wilting, and stunted growth.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Use healthy, nematode-free planting material.
    *   Practice good field sanitation.
*   **Organic Amendments:**
    *   **Neem Cake:** Incorporate well-decomposed neem cake into the soil during land preparation or around existing plants. Neem cake acts as a natural nematicide and also improves soil health.
        *   Apply 200-400 kg of neem cake per acre, or 200-500 grams per plant, mixed into the soil around the root zone.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Pre-planting Treatment:**
        *   In fields with a history of severe nematode infestation, consider soil application before planting.
        *   **Fluensulfone** (2% GR formulation): Apply 10-20 kg of **Fluensulfone** granules per acre by broadcasting and incorporating into the soil before planting.
        *   **Cadusafos** (10% GR formulation): Apply 10-15 kg of **Cadusafos** granules per acre by broadcasting and incorporating into the soil before planting.
    *   **Post-planting Treatment (for existing plants):**
        *   For established plants showing nematode symptoms, apply granular nematicides around the root zone.
        *   **Fluensulfone** (2% GR formulation): Apply 20-40 grams of **Fluensulfone** granules per plant, mixed into the soil around the base.
        *   **Cadusafos** (10% GR formulation): Apply 20-30 grams of **Cadusafos** granules per plant, mixed into the soil around the base.
        *   Ensure adequate moisture after application for the chemicals to be effective.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label for safe and effective use.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) while handling chemicals.
*   Regularly monitor your Sagoan plantation for early signs of pest infestation to implement timely control measures.
*   An Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods, is recommended for sustainable pest control.
