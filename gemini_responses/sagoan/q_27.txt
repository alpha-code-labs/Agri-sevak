As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the suitable climate, soil type, and drainage requirements for Sagoan (Teak, *Tectona grandis*) in Haryana:

### Climate Requirements for Sagoan (Teak)

Sagoan is a tropical species that thrives under specific climatic conditions. For successful cultivation in Haryana, these factors are crucial:

*   **Temperature:**
    *   Optimal growth occurs in temperatures ranging from 25°C to 30°C.
    *   It can tolerate a wider range of 13°C to 40°C.
    *   Young Sagoan plants are highly sensitive to frost, which is a significant concern during Haryana's winter months. Protection measures may be required for young plantations.
*   **Rainfall:**
    *   Requires an annual rainfall of 1200 mm to 2500 mm, with a distinct dry season of 3-5 months.
    *   In Haryana, where average rainfall is often lower than the optimal range (especially in western parts), supplementary irrigation is essential for healthy growth and establishment, particularly during dry spells.
*   **Sunlight:**
    *   Sagoan is a light-demanding species and requires full sunlight for optimal growth and development. Shading can significantly hinder its growth.

### Soil Type Requirements for Sagoan (Teak)

The quality of the soil is paramount for the robust growth of Sagoan:

*   **Texture:**
    *   Prefers deep, well-drained, fertile alluvial soils, sandy loams, or loamy soils.
    *   Avoid stiff clay soils, shallow soils with underlying hardpans, or excessively sandy soils, as these restrict root development and nutrient uptake.
*   **pH:**
    *   Optimal soil pH range is 6.5 to 7.5 (slightly acidic to neutral).
    *   It can tolerate a range of 6.0 to 8.0, but highly acidic or alkaline soils (common in some parts of Haryana) are unsuitable.
*   **Nutrient Status:**
    *   Requires soils rich in calcium, phosphorus, and potassium for vigorous growth. Deep soils allow for extensive root development and access to nutrients and moisture.

### Drainage Requirements for Sagoan (Teak)

Drainage is one of the most critical factors for Sagoan cultivation:

*   **Drainage:**
    *   Sagoan is extremely sensitive to waterlogging. Excellent internal and surface drainage is absolutely essential.
    *   Waterlogged conditions, even for short periods, can lead to stunted growth, root rot, and ultimately plant mortality.
    *   It thrives best on well-drained uplands, gentle slopes, or areas with good sub-surface drainage that prevents water accumulation around the root zone.
    *   In areas prone to waterlogging, proper land preparation, including raised beds or mounds, and ensuring efficient surface runoff, is crucial.
