As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I must inform you that 'Sagoan' is not a recognized agricultural crop in Haryana for which specific, scientifically verified seed treatment and soil treatment recommendations are available from the university.

Therefore, we cannot provide standard recommendations for its seed and soil treatment processes.
