This is not known to affect Sagwan (Teak, *Tectona grandis*), which is likely what "Sagoan" refers to.

Fruit flies (Tephritidae) are primarily pests of edible fruits, and Ber fly (*Carpomyia vesuviana*) is a specific pest of Ber (*Ziziphus mauritiana*). Neither of these are known to cause significant damage to Sagwan (Teak) trees. Teak has its own set of specific pests, mainly defoliators and stem borers, but not fruit flies or Ber fly.
