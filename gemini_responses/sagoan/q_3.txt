As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling various rot types in Sagoan (*Tectona grandis*) relevant to Haryana conditions.

Sagoan is susceptible to several rot types, particularly in the nursery stage and during early establishment. Effective management requires an integrated approach combining cultural practices and judicious use of CIBRC-approved chemicals.

**General Preventive Measures (Cultural Practices):**

1.  **Site Selection and Preparation:**
    *   Ensure well-drained soil to prevent waterlogging, which favors fungal growth.
    *   Avoid planting in low-lying areas prone to water accumulation.
    *   Improve soil aeration through proper tillage.
2.  **Nursery Hygiene:**
    *   Use sterilized or solarized nursery soil/media.
    *   Maintain optimal spacing between seedlings to ensure good air circulation.
    *   Remove and destroy infected seedlings promptly to prevent disease spread.
3.  **Seed Source and Treatment:**
    *   Obtain seeds from healthy, disease-free parent trees.
    *   Always treat seeds before sowing.
4.  **Water Management:**
    *   Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day, to reduce leaf wetness.
    *   Water in the morning to allow foliage to dry quickly.
    *   Avoid overwatering.
5.  **Wound Management:**
    *   Minimize mechanical injuries to stems and roots during planting and cultural operations.
    *   Prune properly and apply wound dressing if necessary, especially for older trees.

**Specific Control Measures (Chemicals):**

**1. Seed Rot and Seedling Rot (including Damping-off, Collar Rot, Neck Rot, Foot Rot):**
These are common in nurseries and young plantations, often caused by fungi like *Pythium*, *Phytophthora*, *Rhizoctonia*, and *Fusarium* species.

*   **Seed Treatment (before sowing):**
    *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: 2-3 g per kg of seed.
    *   **Thiram** 75% WS: 2.5-3 g per kg of seed.
    *   **Captan** 50% WP: 2.5-3 g per kg of seed.
    *   **Metalaxyl** 35% WS: 6 g per kg of seed (especially effective against *Pythium* and *Phytophthora*).
*   **Nursery Bed Drench/Soil Application (after sowing or at first sign of disease):**
    *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride** 72.2% SL: 2-3 ml per litre of water, drench the soil around seedlings.
    *   **Copper oxychloride** 50% WP: 2-3 g per litre of water, drench the soil.
    *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP: 2-2.5 g per litre of water, drench the soil.
    *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: 1-2 g per litre of water, drench the soil.
    *   **Validamycin** 3% L: 1-2 ml per litre of water, drench the soil (specifically for *Rhizoctonia*).

**2. Root Rot (in established trees):**
Root rot in established Sagoan trees can be caused by various fungi, including *Ganoderma* species. Chemical control for established root rot in large trees is challenging and often has limited efficacy. Focus on prevention and early intervention.

*   **Preventive/Early Stage Drenching:**
    *   **Propiconazole** 25% EC: 1-2 ml per litre of water, drench around the root zone of affected or susceptible trees.
    *   **Hexaconazole** 5% SC: 1-2 ml per litre of water, drench around the root zone.
    *   *Note: For severe or advanced root rot in mature trees, chemical treatment is generally not effective. Focus on removing infected trees and improving soil health.*

**3. Stem Rot (including Heart Rot):**
Stem rot, particularly heart rot, is primarily a problem of mature Sagoan trees, often entering through wounds or branch stubs. Once established, chemical control is not feasible.

*   **Prevention is Key:**
    *   Avoid mechanical injuries during logging or cultural operations.
    *   Practice proper pruning techniques, ensuring clean cuts and applying wound protectants if necessary.

**Regarding other rot types:**

*   **Black Rot:** This is not known to affect Sagoan as a distinct, major disease requiring specific control measures.
*   **Fruit Rot:** This is not known to affect Sagoan as a distinct, major disease requiring specific control measures.

Always follow the manufacturer's instructions for application rates and safety precautions when using any chemical. Integrated disease management, combining cultural practices with targeted chemical applications, is crucial for sustainable Sagoan cultivation.
