Regarding the conditions mentioned for Sagoan (Teak, *Tectona grandis*):

*   **Fruit bursting:** Teak produces small, hard, drupaceous fruits (often referred to as seeds in forestry). These fruits are not fleshy and do not typically burst due to turgor pressure or rapid water uptake, which is a common issue in horticultural fruit crops.
    *   This is not known to affect Sagoan.

*   **Leaf burning/melting:** While Teak leaves can exhibit symptoms of scorching (necrosis) due to severe environmental stresses like drought or extreme heat, or sometimes due to nutrient deficiencies, "leaf burning/melting" as a specific form of *physical damage* (implying mechanical injury or a direct, controllable physical phenomenon) is not a recognized condition for Teak. "Melting" of leaves is generally associated with severe pathological conditions (e.g., soft rots) which are not typical for Teak leaves as a primary issue.
    *   This is not known to affect Sagoan.

*   **Hardness in fruit:** Teak fruits are naturally hard and woody. This is their inherent characteristic and not a condition or problem that requires control.
    *   This is not known to affect Sagoan.
