For Sagoan (Teak, *Tectona grandis*), the recommended doses of organic manures and biostimulants for optimal growth and soil health are as follows:

*   **Farm Yard Manure (FYM):**
    *   At the time of planting: 10-20 kg per pit.
    *   For established young trees (1-5 years): 15-25 kg per tree, applied annually around the root zone before the monsoon season.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   At the time of planting: 2-5 kg per pit.
    *   For established young trees (1-5 years): 3-7 kg per tree, applied annually around the root zone before the monsoon season.

*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract Biostimulant):**
    *   Sagarika is a biostimulant derived from seaweed extract, not a bulk organic manure like FYM or vermicompost. It enhances nutrient uptake and plant growth.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** 2-4 ml per litre of water, sprayed to cover the foliage. Apply 2-3 times during the active growth period (e.g., post-monsoon flush, pre-flowering).
    *   **Soil Drench/Root Zone Application:** 50-100 ml per tree, diluted in sufficient water, applied around the root zone. Apply 2-3 times a year, especially during periods of active growth or stress.
