As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in Sagoan (Teak) plantations in Haryana:

It is important to implement an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods for sustainable control.

### 1. Borers

Teak is susceptible to various borers, including the Beehole borer (*Xyleutes ceramica*) and Stem borers (*Zeuzera coffeae*, *Dihammus cervinus*). Control is most effective when targeting young larvae or preventing egg laying.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Regular inspection and removal of infested branches or trees to prevent spread.
    *   Maintain tree vigor through proper nutrition and watering.
    *   Pruning of dead or dying branches.
*   **Chemical Control (for young plantations or high-value trees):**
    *   **For bark application/swabbing (preventive or early infestation):**
        *   **Chlorpyrifos** (20% EC) at 2.5-3 ml/L of water. Apply to the bark of the trunk and main branches, especially during periods of adult emergence and egg laying.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** (5% EC) at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **For systemic action (soil drench or trunk injection by specialists):**
        *   **Imidacloprid** (17.8% SL) at 0.5-1 ml/L of water for soil drenching around the base of young trees. For trunk injection, higher concentrations are used by trained personnel.

### 2. Caterpillars (including Defoliators and Leaf folders)

Teak defoliators like *Hyblaea puera* (Teak defoliator) and *Eutectona machaeralis* (Teak skeletonizer/leaf folder) are major pests, especially in nurseries and young plantations.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Regular monitoring for early detection of infestations.
    *   Collection and destruction of larvae and pupae where feasible.
*   **Biological Control:**
    *   Encourage natural enemies like parasitic wasps and predatory birds.
    *   Application of microbial insecticides:
        *   **Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki** (Wettable Powder) at 1-2 kg/acre or 2-4 g/L of water. This is effective against young caterpillars and is safe for beneficial insects.
*   **Chemical Control (for severe outbreaks):**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** (18.5% SC) at 0.2-0.4 ml/L of water.
    *   **Emamectin benzoate** (5% SG) at 0.2-0.4 g/L of water.
    *   **Flubendiamide** (20% WG) at 0.2-0.4 g/L of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** (5% EC) at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Cypermethrin** (25% EC) at 1 ml/L of water.

### 3. Diamondback Moth

This is not known to affect Sagoan. The Diamondback moth (*Plutella xylostella*) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower, mustard).
