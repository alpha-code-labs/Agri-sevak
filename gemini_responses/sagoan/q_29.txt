This is not known to affect Sagoan (Teak).

Sagoan (Teak) is a timber tree. While it naturally produces flowers and fruits (drupes), and some shedding is a normal physiological process, "dropping" of flowers or fruits is generally not considered a condition requiring control measures in Teak cultivation for timber production. Furthermore, Teak does not produce "Tinda" or "Bolls."
