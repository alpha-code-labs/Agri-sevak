As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Sagoan (*Tectona grandis*) in Haryana.

Effective management of fungal diseases in Sagoan involves a combination of cultural practices and timely chemical interventions.

**General Management Practices for Fungal Diseases:**

1.  **Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy fallen infected leaves, twigs, and other plant debris from around the trees. This reduces the inoculum source for future infections.
2.  **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate spacing between trees to allow for good air circulation, which helps reduce humidity and prevents the prolonged wetness of leaves, unfavorable for fungal growth.
3.  **Nutrient Management:** Maintain optimal plant health through balanced fertilization. Healthy trees are more resilient to disease attacks. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can promote lush, susceptible growth.
4.  **Water Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation late in the day, which can leave foliage wet overnight. Water at the base of the trees in the morning to allow leaves to dry quickly.
5.  **Pruning:** Remove diseased or overcrowded branches to improve air circulation and reduce disease spread.

**Specific Fungal Disease Control in Sagoan:**

Here are the control measures for the fungal diseases known to affect Sagoan:

*   **Alternaria Leaf Spot/Blight (Caused by *Alternaria alternata*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Characterized by irregular, dark brown spots on leaves, often with concentric rings, which can coalesce to form blighted areas.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   Regular scouting and removal of infected leaves.
        *   Foliar spray with fungicides at the first sign of symptoms, and repeat every 10-15 days if conditions are favorable for disease development.
        *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Chlorothalonil** (75% WP) at 2 g/L of water.
        *   **Propiconazole** (25% EC) at 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC) at 0.5-1 ml/L of water.

*   **Anthracnose (Caused by *Colletotrichum gloeosporioides*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Appears as irregular, dark brown to black spots on leaves, often along veins, which can lead to leaf distortion, petiole cankers, and twig dieback.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   Prune and destroy infected twigs and branches.
        *   Apply fungicides preventively during periods of high humidity and rainfall, or at the first appearance of symptoms. Repeat every 10-15 days.
        *   **Carbendazim** (50% WP) at 1 g/L of water.
        *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Propiconazole** (25% EC) at 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC) at 0.5-1 ml/L of water.

*   **Brown Spot (Caused by *Cercospora tectonae*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Small, circular to irregular brown spots on leaves, often with a purplish margin, which can enlarge and lead to premature defoliation.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   Maintain good orchard hygiene.
        *   Foliar spray with fungicides when symptoms are observed, repeating as necessary.
        *   **Carbendazim** (50% WP) at 1 g/L of water.
        *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Chlorothalonil** (75% WP) at 2 g/L of water.

*   **Powdery Mildew (Caused by *Phyllactinia tectonae*, formerly *Uncinula tectonae*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Characterized by a white, powdery growth on the upper and lower surfaces of leaves, young shoots, and sometimes flowers. Severe infection can lead to leaf distortion, yellowing, and premature defoliation. This is a significant disease in Sagoan.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   Ensure good air circulation through proper spacing and pruning.
        *   Apply fungicides at the first sign of powdery growth. Repeat applications every 10-14 days, especially during dry periods followed by high humidity.
        *   **Wettable Sulphur** (80% WP) at 2-3 g/L of water.
        *   **Hexaconazole** (5% EC) at 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Tebuconazole** (25.9% EC) at 0.75 ml/L of water.
        *   **Myclobutanil** (10% WP) at 0.4 g/L of water.
        *   **Penconazole** (10% EC) at 0.5 ml/L of water.

**Diseases Not Known to Affect Sagoan:**

*   **Blast:** This is not known to affect Sagoan.
*   **Downy Mildew:** This is not known to affect Sagoan.
*   **Grey Mildew:** This is not known to affect Sagoan as a distinct disease.

Always ensure thorough coverage of the foliage when spraying fungicides. Consult local agricultural extension services for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and for the latest CIBRC approved products and dosages.
