Wilt and Parawilt are significant concerns in Sagoan (Teak) plantations in Haryana. Effective management requires an integrated approach, as the causes can be both pathogenic (fungal) and physiological (environmental stress).

**Understanding the Conditions:**

*   **Wilt (Pathogenic):** Primarily caused by soil-borne fungi such as *Fusarium solani*. These pathogens infect the roots and block the vascular system, leading to wilting, yellowing, and eventual death of the plant.
*   **Parawilt (Physiological):** Often non-pathogenic, triggered by environmental stresses like sudden changes in soil moisture (drought or waterlogging), high temperatures, root injury during transplanting or cultural operations, or nutrient imbalances. While not directly caused by a pathogen, stressed plants can become more susceptible to secondary infections.

**Integrated Management Strategies:**

**1. Cultural and Agronomic Practices (Crucial for both, especially Parawilt):**
These practices aim to reduce stress on the plants and create an unfavorable environment for pathogens.

*   **Site Selection:** Choose well-drained soils for planting. Avoid areas prone to waterlogging, as this can stress roots and favor fungal growth.
*   **Healthy Planting Material:** Use disease-free and vigorous seedlings from reputable nurseries. Ensure seedlings are well-hardened before transplanting.
*   **Proper Planting Techniques:** Minimize root damage during transplanting. Plant seedlings at appropriate spacing to reduce competition for water and nutrients.
*   **Water Management:** Provide adequate and timely irrigation, especially during dry periods, to prevent water stress. However, avoid over-irrigation and waterlogging. Mulching around the base of trees can help conserve soil moisture and regulate soil temperature.
*   **Soil Health:** Improve soil organic matter content by incorporating well-decomposed farmyard manure or compost. This enhances soil structure, drainage, and microbial activity.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure balanced nutrition. Conduct soil tests to identify deficiencies and apply appropriate fertilizers. Potassium deficiency, for instance, can sometimes exacerbate wilting.
*   **Weed Control:** Keep the area around trees free of weeds to reduce competition for water and nutrients.
*   **Sanitation:** Promptly remove and destroy severely infected plants to prevent the spread of pathogenic wilt. For partial wilting, pruning affected branches can sometimes help.

**2. Biological Control (Primarily for Pathogenic Wilt):**
These beneficial microorganisms can suppress soil-borne pathogens.

*   **Soil Application/Root Dip:**
    *   **Trichoderma viride** (or *Trichoderma harzianum*): Apply 2.5 kg/acre mixed with 50 kg of farmyard manure or soil, broadcast around the plants, and lightly incorporate. For seedlings, use as a root dip at 10 g/L water for 30 minutes before planting.
    *   **Pseudomonas fluorescens:** Apply 2.5 kg/acre mixed with 50 kg of farmyard manure or soil, broadcast around the plants, and lightly incorporate. For seedlings, use as a root dip at 10 g/L water for 30 minutes before planting.

**3. Chemical Control (For Pathogenic Wilt, as a preventive measure or in severe cases):**
Chemical fungicides can be used to manage pathogenic wilt, often as a soil drench.

*   **Soil Drench/Root Dip:**
    *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: Drench the soil around the base of affected plants with a solution of 2 g/L water (approximately 2-5 liters per plant depending on size). For seedlings, use as a root dip at 1-2 g/L water for 30 minutes before planting.
    *   **Propiconazole** 25% EC: Drench the soil around the base of affected plants with a solution of 1 ml/L water.
    *   **Copper oxychloride** 50% WP: Drench the soil around the base of affected plants with a solution of 3 g/L water.

It is crucial to implement these strategies proactively and monitor your Sagoan plantation regularly for any signs of wilting to ensure timely intervention.
