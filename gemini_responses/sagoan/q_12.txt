Scale insects and Mealybugs are known pests that can affect Sagoan (*Tectona grandis*). Effective management involves an integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies:**

1.  **Cultural Control:**
    *   **Regular Monitoring:** Periodically inspect Sagoan trees for early signs of infestation, especially on the undersides of leaves, stems, and branch junctions.
    *   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy heavily infested branches or twigs, if practical, to reduce pest populations.
    *   **Maintain Tree Health:** Ensure proper nutrition and watering to enhance tree vigor, making them more resilient to pest attacks. Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can promote succulent growth attractive to sap-sucking pests.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Encourage the presence of natural predators (e.g., ladybird beetles, lacewings) and parasitoids (tiny wasps) that feed on scale insects and mealybugs. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.
    *   **Biopesticides:** In cases of mild infestation or as part of an organic approach, entomopathogenic fungi like *Beauveria bassiana* can be effective against mealybugs and scale crawlers.

3.  **Chemical Control:**
    When infestations are severe and other methods are insufficient, chemical control may be necessary. For effective control, ensure thorough coverage of the infested parts, including the undersides of leaves and stem crevices. For large trees, systemic insecticides applied as soil drench or trunk injection might be more practical, but foliar sprays are generally recommended for accessible parts.

    **Recommended CIBRC Approved Technical Chemicals:**

    *   **For Scale Insects and Mealybugs (Systemic Action):**
        *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply as a foliar spray at a concentration of **0.5 - 1 ml/L** of water. This systemic insecticide is absorbed by the plant and ingested by the sap-sucking pests.
        *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply as a foliar spray at a concentration of **0.2 - 0.4 g/L** of water. Another systemic insecticide effective against sap-suckers.
        *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply as a foliar spray at a concentration of **0.2 - 0.4 g/L** of water. This is also a systemic insecticide.

    *   **For Scale Insects (especially Nymphs) and Mealybugs (Insect Growth Regulator):**
        *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply as a foliar spray at a concentration of **1.25 - 1.5 ml/L** of water. This acts as an insect growth regulator, disrupting the molting process of nymphs and preventing them from developing into adults.

    *   **For Scale Insects and Mealybugs (Physical Action):**
        *   **Horticultural Mineral Oil:** Apply as a foliar spray at a concentration of **10 - 20 ml/L** of water (1-2% solution). This works by smothering the pests, blocking their breathing pores. It is particularly effective against soft-bodied scales and mealybugs, and their eggs. Ensure thorough coverage.

**Important Considerations for Application:**

*   **Timing:** For scale insects, targeting the crawler stage (the mobile nymphal stage) is most effective, as they are more vulnerable to insecticides.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure complete and thorough coverage of the infested plant parts, including the undersides of leaves and stem crevices, for optimal efficacy.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, and protective clothing while handling and applying insecticides. Follow the instructions and safety precautions mentioned on the product label.
*   **Rotation:** To prevent the development of pesticide resistance, rotate between insecticides with different modes of action.
*   **Consultation:** For large-scale infestations or specific challenges, it is advisable to consult with local agricultural extension specialists or HAU experts for tailored advice.
