As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling weeds in Sagoan (Teak, *Tectona grandis*) plantations in Haryana. Effective weed management is crucial, especially during the initial 2-3 years of establishment, to minimize competition for resources and ensure healthy growth of Sagoan. An integrated approach combining manual, mechanical, and chemical methods is recommended.

**General Weed Management Practices:**

*   **Manual Weeding/Hoeing:** Regular hand weeding and hoeing around young Sagoan plants are highly effective, particularly in the first few years. This also aids in soil aeration.
*   **Mulching:** Applying organic mulch (e.g., crop residues, wood chips) around the base of Sagoan plants can suppress weed growth, conserve soil moisture, and improve soil health.
*   **Inter-row Cultivation:** Mechanical cultivation between rows of Sagoan can control weeds in wider plantations.

**Specific Weed Control Measures:**

**1. Broadleaf Weeds (including Bathu and Congress grass):**
These weeds compete significantly with young Sagoan plants for nutrients, water, and light.

*   **Manual/Mechanical:** Regular hand weeding and hoeing are highly effective, especially for young weeds.
*   **Chemical Control (Post-emergence, directed spray):**
    *   **Glyphosate** (non-selective): Apply at 1.0-1.5 kg active ingredient per acre in 200-300 L of water. Use as a directed spray, strictly avoiding contact with Sagoan foliage and green bark, especially on young plants.
    *   **2,4-D Amine Salt** (selective for broadleaf weeds): Apply at 0.5-1.0 kg active ingredient per acre in 200-300 L of water. Use as a directed spray, taking extreme care to prevent drift onto Sagoan plants.
    *   **Paraquat dichloride** (non-selective, contact herbicide): Apply at 0.5-1.0 kg active ingredient per acre in 200-300 L of water. Use as a directed spray, strictly avoiding contact with Sagoan foliage and green bark.

**2. Narrowleaf Weeds (including Phalaris minor):**
These grassy weeds can also pose significant competition to Sagoan.

*   **Manual/Mechanical:** Hand weeding and hoeing are effective, particularly for small infestations.
*   **Chemical Control (Post-emergence, directed spray):**
    *   **Glyphosate** (non-selective): Apply at 1.0-1.5 kg active ingredient per acre in 200-300 L of water. Use as a directed spray, strictly avoiding contact with Sagoan foliage and green bark.
    *   **Quizalofop-ethyl** (selective for grasses): Apply at 50-100 g active ingredient per acre in 200-300 L of water. This herbicide is generally safer for broadleaf trees when used as a directed spray.
    *   **Fenoxaprop-P-ethyl** (selective for grasses): Apply at 50-60 g active ingredient per acre in 200-300 L of water. Similar to Quizalofop-ethyl, use as a directed spray.
    *   **Paraquat dichloride** (non-selective, contact herbicide): Apply at 0.5-1.0 kg active ingredient per acre in 200-300 L of water. Use as a directed spray, strictly avoiding contact with Sagoan foliage and green bark.

**3. Amarbail (*Cuscuta*):**
This parasitic weed can entangle young Sagoan plants and other weeds in the plantation, leading to competition and weakening of host plants.

*   **Manual Removal:** This is the most effective method. Carefully remove *Cuscuta* strands by hand from Sagoan plants and other weeds. Collect and destroy (preferably by burning) the removed plant material to prevent re-establishment. Repeat regularly.
*   **Chemical Control (Spot application with extreme caution):**
    *   **Glyphosate** (non-selective): Can be used as a highly localized spot application on *Cuscuta* growing on other weeds, ensuring no contact with Sagoan plants. This is generally not recommended directly on Sagoan due to a high risk of damage.
    *   **Paraquat dichloride** (non-selective, contact): Similar to Glyphosate, use with extreme caution for spot treatment on *Cuscuta* growing on other weeds.

**4. Orobanche:**
This is not known to affect Sagoan. *Orobanche* species are root parasitic weeds that primarily infest specific dicotyledonous crops such as mustard, tobacco, and certain vegetables. Teak (*Tectona grandis*) is not a known host for *Orobanche*. Therefore, specific control measures for *Orobanche* on Sagoan are not required. If observed, it would likely be parasitizing other susceptible weed species in the vicinity.

**Important Precautions for Herbicide Application:**

*   **Directed Spray:** Always use a protective hood or shield with spray nozzles to ensure herbicides are applied only to the weeds and do not come into contact with the Sagoan plants, especially young saplings.
*   **Timing:** Apply herbicides when weeds are actively growing and at a susceptible stage (usually young).
*   **Weather Conditions:** Avoid spraying during windy conditions to prevent drift. Ensure no rain is expected for at least 6-8 hours after application.
*   **Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):** Always wear appropriate PPE, including gloves, mask, protective clothing, and eye protection, while handling and applying herbicides.
*   **Read Label:** Always refer to the product label for specific instructions, dosage rates, and safety precautions.
*   **Water Quality:** Use clean water for mixing herbicides.
