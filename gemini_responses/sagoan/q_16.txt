As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU), I must provide scientifically verified advice.

The term "Sagoan" is not recognized as a standard crop name in Haryana for which specific fertilizer recommendations (Urea, Nano-Urea, DAP, Nano-DAP, NPK, SSP, Potash, and Sulphur) are available from HAU in the context of typical field crop cultivation.

To provide accurate and scientifically verified recommendations, please clarify what "Sagoan" refers to (e.g., a specific crop, tree, or a local name for a known plant). Once the crop is identified, I can provide the relevant fertilizer doses based on HAU guidelines for Haryana.
