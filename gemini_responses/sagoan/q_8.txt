Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling sucking pests in Sagoan (Teak) plantations in Haryana. Effective management of these pests requires an integrated approach.

Sucking pests like aphids, leafhoppers, whiteflies, thrips, and psylla can cause significant damage to Sagoan by feeding on plant sap, leading to stunted growth, leaf curling, yellowing, and in severe cases, defoliation. Psylla can also cause gall formation.

Here's a comprehensive approach to manage these pests:

**1. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Principles:**
*   **Regular Monitoring:** Frequently inspect your Sagoan plants, especially the undersides of leaves and new shoots, for the presence of pests or symptoms of damage. Early detection is key to effective control.
*   **Promote Plant Health:** Ensure proper nutrition and irrigation for healthy, vigorous plants, which are more resilient to pest attacks.
*   **Weed Management:** Keep the area around Sagoan plants free of weeds, as many weeds can act as alternate hosts for these pests.

**2. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   **Pruning:** For localized infestations, especially for psylla galls or heavily infested shoots, prune and destroy the affected parts to reduce pest populations.
*   **Water Sprays:** For small plants or localized aphid infestations, a strong jet of water can dislodge pests from the leaves.

**3. Biological Control:**
*   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Many natural enemies like ladybird beetles, lacewings, hoverfly larvae, and parasitic wasps prey on or parasitize sucking pests. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that can harm these beneficial insects.
*   **Neem-based Formulations:**
    *   **Azadirachtin** (e.g., 1500 ppm or 10000 ppm formulation) can be used as a botanical insecticide. It acts as an antifeedant and insect growth regulator.
        *   **Dosage:** 2.5 - 5 ml/L of water (for 1500 ppm) or 1 - 1.5 ml/L of water (for 10000 ppm). Apply during early morning or late evening for best results.

**4. Chemical Control (When Pest Population Reaches Economic Threshold):**
When pest populations are high and causing significant damage, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage, especially the undersides of leaves.

**Recommended CIBRC Approved Insecticides for Sucking Pests in Sagoan:**

*   **For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, Thrips:**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:**
        *   **Dosage:** 0.5 - 0.75 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:**
        *   **Dosage:** 0.2 - 0.4 grams per litre of water.
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:**
        *   **Dosage:** 0.2 - 0.4 grams per litre of water.
    *   **Dinotefuran 20% SG:**
        *   **Dosage:** 0.2 - 0.3 grams per litre of water.

*   **Specifically for Whiteflies and Leafhoppers (Insect Growth Regulator):**
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:**
        *   **Dosage:** 1.25 - 1.5 ml per litre of water. (Effective against nymphs and prevents molting).

*   **For Whiteflies and Thrips:**
    *   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:**
        *   **Dosage:** 0.6 - 1 ml per litre of water.

*   **For Aphids and Whiteflies:**
    *   **Pymetrozine 50% WG:**
        *   **Dosage:** 0.3 - 0.4 grams per litre of water.

**Important Considerations for Chemical Application:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label carefully.
*   Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying.
*   Ensure proper spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where many sucking pests reside.
*   Avoid spraying during windy conditions or when rain is expected shortly after application.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension officers for specific recommendations tailored to your exact situation and current pest pressure.

By adopting these integrated strategies, you can effectively manage sucking pests in your Sagoan plantation and ensure healthy growth.
