As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), my advice is based on scientifically verified information relevant to Haryana.

The term 'Sagoan' is not recognized as a common fruit crop in Haryana or in general agricultural literature. Therefore, I am unable to provide specific, scientifically verified recommendations for improving its yield, fruit quality, and storage life.

Could you please clarify the name of the crop? If it is a local name, providing its botanical name or a more common regional name would help me provide accurate and relevant advice.
