Dear Farmer,

Addressing micronutrient deficiencies in Sagoan (*Tectona grandis*) is crucial for healthy growth and timber yield. Based on scientific research and practices suitable for Haryana, here's how to manage these deficiencies:

It is highly recommended to conduct a soil test and leaf tissue analysis to accurately diagnose specific deficiencies and determine the precise quantities required. The following recommendations are general guidelines for corrective measures.

### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Small leaves (often called 'little leaf'), chlorosis (yellowing) between veins, particularly on younger leaves, and stunted growth.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Apply 0.5% solution of **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (5 grams per litre of water) or 0.1% solution of **Zinc EDTA** (1 gram per litre of water). Spray until leaves are thoroughly wet, preferably in the morning or late afternoon. Repeat after 15-20 days if symptoms persist.
    *   **Soil Application:** For severe deficiency, apply 10-25 kg of **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** per acre, broadcasted and incorporated into the soil, especially around the root zone of the trees.

### 2. Iron (Fe) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Pronounced interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on young leaves, while the veins remain green. In severe cases, entire leaves may turn yellow or even white.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Apply 0.5-1% solution of **Ferrous sulphate heptahydrate** (5-10 grams per litre of water) or 0.1% solution of **Ferrous EDTA** (1 gram per litre of water). Spray thoroughly, focusing on the affected young foliage. Repeat after 10-15 days if necessary.
    *   **Soil Application:** While foliar sprays are generally more effective for quick correction in trees, 25-50 kg of **Ferrous sulphate heptahydrate** per acre can be applied to the soil in severe, persistent cases, especially in alkaline soils.

### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Dieback of terminal buds and young shoots, stunted growth, distorted or thickened leaves, cracking of stems, and sometimes internal browning.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Apply 0.1-0.2% solution of **Borax (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate)** or **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (1-2 grams per litre of water). Ensure good coverage of the foliage.
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 2-4 kg of **Borax (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate)** per acre, broadcasted or applied around the base of the trees.

### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Dieback of growing points (terminal buds), distorted and stunted new leaves, often with marginal necrosis (browning of leaf edges), and poor root development.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Apply 0.5-1% solution of **Calcium nitrate** or **Calcium chloride** (5-10 grams per litre of water). Focus on new growth.
    *   **Soil Application:** For long-term correction and soil amendment, especially in acidic soils, **Gypsum (Calcium sulphate)** can be incorporated into the soil. However, for immediate correction in trees, foliar application is more effective.

### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, starting from the leaf margins and progressing inwards, while the veins remain green. Leaves may become brittle and prematurely shed.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Apply 0.5-1% solution of **Magnesium sulphate** (5-10 grams per litre of water). Spray thoroughly, ensuring coverage of older leaves.
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 10-20 kg of **Magnesium sulphate** per acre, broadcasted or applied around the base of the trees.

### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, often appearing as a fine network of green veins against a pale yellow background. In severe cases, small necrotic (dead) spots may develop.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Apply 0.5% solution of **Manganese sulphate** (5 grams per litre of water). Spray thoroughly, focusing on the affected young foliage.
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 5-10 kg of **Manganese sulphate** per acre, broadcasted or applied around the base of the trees.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Timing:** Foliar sprays are best applied during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late afternoon) to prevent scorching and improve absorption.
*   **Water Quality:** Use clean water for preparing spray solutions.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management:** Always combine these corrective measures with good agricultural practices, including proper irrigation, organic matter addition, and balanced NPK fertilization, as recommended by HAU.
*   **Professional Advice:** For persistent or severe issues, consult with an agronomist from HAU for a detailed diagnosis and tailored recommendations.
