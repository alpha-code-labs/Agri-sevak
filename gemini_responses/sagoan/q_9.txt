As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling mites in Sagoan (Teak) in Haryana.

Mites, including Red Spider Mite (Tetranychus spp.) and Rust Mite (Eriophyes spp.), are known pests of Sagoan (Teak). They feed on the sap, causing characteristic damage like bronzing, yellowing, leaf distortion, and premature defoliation, which can reduce tree vigor and growth.

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   **Water Management:** Ensure adequate irrigation, especially during dry periods, as water-stressed trees are more susceptible to mite infestations.
*   **Weed Control:** Keep the area around Sagoan trees free of weeds, as they can act as alternate hosts for mites.
*   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy severely infested leaves or branches to reduce the initial mite population.
*   **Water Spray:** For small infestations, a strong jet of water can dislodge mites from the leaves, especially from the undersides.

**2. Chemical Control (Acaricides):**
When mite populations are high and causing significant damage, chemical control becomes necessary. It is crucial to ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of the leaves where mites predominantly reside. Always rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

*   **For Red Spider Mite:**
    *   **Propargite** (57% EC): Apply at a rate of 1.5 - 2.0 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Spiromesifen** (22.9% SC): Apply at a rate of 0.5 - 0.7 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Fenazaquin** (10% EC): Apply at a rate of 1.0 - 1.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Abamectin** (1.9% EC): Apply at a rate of 0.3 - 0.5 ml per litre of water.

*   **For Rust Mite (and also effective against Red Spider Mite):**
    *   **Wettable Sulfur** (80% WP): Apply at a rate of 2.0 - 3.0 grams per litre of water. (Note: Avoid applying sulfur when temperatures are very high, typically above 30-32°C, as it can cause phytotoxicity).
    *   **Abamectin** (1.9% EC): Apply at a rate of 0.3 - 0.5 ml per litre of water. (Abamectin is effective against both types of mites).

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and strictly follow the instructions and safety precautions provided on the product label.
*   Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during the mixing and application of chemicals.
*   Monitor your Sagoan trees regularly for signs of mite infestation. Early detection allows for more effective and timely intervention.
*   Repeat applications may be necessary based on the severity of the infestation and the residual action of the chosen acaricide, adhering to the recommended spray intervals.
