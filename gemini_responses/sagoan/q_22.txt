As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I must provide scientifically verified advice for crops cultivated in Haryana.

The term "Sagoan" is not recognized as a common crop or a local variety of any major crop cultivated in Haryana. Therefore, I do not have scientifically verified recommendations for its cultivation practices (sowing method/pattern, planting depth, spacing, and seed dose) specific to the agro-climatic conditions of Haryana.
