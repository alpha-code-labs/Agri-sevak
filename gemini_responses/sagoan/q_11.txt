Namaste,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU), Hisar, I can confirm that Sagoan (Teak, *Tectona grandis*) plantations in Haryana and across India are susceptible to various insect pests, including beetles, weevils, and sawflies. These pests can cause significant damage through defoliation, shoot boring, and stem boring, impacting tree growth and timber quality.

Here is scientifically verified advice for their control:

**I. General Management Practices:**

1.  **Regular Monitoring:** Regularly inspect young plantations and nurseries for early signs of pest infestation, such as chewed leaves, boreholes, or the presence of adult insects/larvae.
2.  **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infested plant parts, fallen leaves, and other debris from the plantation area. This helps reduce pest populations and breeding sites.
3.  **Pruning:** Judiciously prune affected branches, especially those showing signs of borer activity, and dispose of them properly.
4.  **Promote Natural Enemies:** Encourage the presence of natural predators and parasitoids that can help keep pest populations in check. Avoid indiscriminate use of broad-spectrum insecticides that can harm beneficial insects.

**II. Chemical Control:**

For effective chemical control, it is crucial to use CIBRC (Central Insecticides Board & Registration Committee) approved technical chemical names and follow recommended dosages. Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during application.

**For Defoliating Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies (Foliar Spray):**

*   **Chlorpyrifos** (50% EC formulation): Apply at a rate of **2.5 ml per litre of water**.
*   **Cypermethrin** (25% EC formulation): Apply at a rate of **0.5 - 1 ml per litre of water**.
*   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** (5% EC formulation): Apply at a rate of **0.5 ml per litre of water**.
*   **Fipronil** (5% SC formulation): Apply at a rate of **1 - 1.5 ml per litre of water**.

**For Stem/Shoot Borers (Beetles and Weevils):**

*   **Chlorpyrifos** (50% EC formulation): For stem borers, a solution can be injected directly into boreholes or applied as a basal drench around the tree trunk. For drenching, use **2-4 litres of 0.2% solution per tree** (e.g., 4 ml of 50% EC per litre of water).
*   **Imidacloprid** (17.8% SL formulation): This systemic insecticide can be effective against borers when applied as a basal drench or stem injection. Use **1-2 ml per tree** (diluted as per product instructions for drenching/injection).

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Timing:** Apply insecticides during the active feeding stage of the pests, typically when damage is first observed.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage for defoliators and targeted application for borers.
*   **Rotation:** Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
*   **Safety:** Always read and follow the instructions on the product label for safe handling, application, and disposal.

For specific pest identification and tailored advice, it is always recommended to consult with local agricultural extension officers or HAU experts.
