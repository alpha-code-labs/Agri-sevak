Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide guidance on addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies in Sagoan (Teak) in Haryana. Sagoan, like any crop, requires adequate macro-nutrients (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium) for healthy growth and timber production.

**Crucial First Step: Soil Testing**
Before applying any fertilizers, it is highly recommended to conduct a comprehensive soil test through HAU or a certified laboratory. This will accurately determine the existing nutrient levels in your specific field and allow for precise, cost-effective, and environmentally sound fertilizer recommendations. Without a soil test, the following recommendations are general guidelines.

### Addressing Macro-nutrient Deficiencies in Sagoan

**1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency**

*   **Symptoms:** Yellowing of older leaves (chlorosis), stunted growth, reduced leaf size, and poor canopy development.
*   **Recommended Chemical:**
    *   **Urea** (46% Nitrogen)
*   **Application Method & Dosage (General Guideline):**
    *   For young Sagoan plants (1-3 years old) showing deficiency: Apply 50-75 kg **Urea** per acre, split into 2-3 applications during the active growing season (e.g., monsoon and post-monsoon).
    *   For established Sagoan trees showing deficiency: Apply 75-100 kg **Urea** per acre, split into 2-3 applications.
    *   Apply the fertilizer around the base of the tree within the drip line, ensuring it is incorporated into the soil and followed by irrigation if rainfall is insufficient.

**2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency**

*   **Symptoms:** Dark green or purplish discoloration of older leaves, stunted root development, delayed maturity, and reduced overall vigor.
*   **Recommended Chemicals:**
    *   **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% Nitrogen, 46% Phosphorus P2O5)
    *   **Single Superphosphate (SSP)** (16% Phosphorus P2O5)
*   **Application Method & Dosage (General Guideline):**
    *   For young Sagoan plants showing deficiency: Apply 60-100 kg **Diammonium Phosphate** per acre, or 180-300 kg **Single Superphosphate** per acre.
    *   For established Sagoan trees showing deficiency: Apply 100-150 kg **Diammonium Phosphate** per acre, or 300-450 kg **Single Superphosphate** per acre.
    *   Phosphorus is less mobile in the soil, so it should be applied as a basal dose or incorporated into the soil near the root zone. A single application is usually sufficient.

**3. Potassium (K) Deficiency**

*   **Symptoms:** Yellowing and browning of leaf margins (scorching) on older leaves, weak stems, reduced disease resistance, and poor water use efficiency.
*   **Recommended Chemical:**
    *   **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** / **Potassium Chloride** (60% Potassium K2O)
*   **Application Method & Dosage (General Guideline):**
    *   For young Sagoan plants showing deficiency: Apply 50-75 kg **Muriate of Potash** per acre.
    *   For established Sagoan trees showing deficiency: Apply 75-100 kg **Muriate of Potash** per acre.
    *   Apply the fertilizer around the base of the tree within the drip line, ensuring it is incorporated into the soil and followed by irrigation.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Timing:** Apply fertilizers during the active growth phase of Sagoan, typically during the monsoon season or when irrigation is available.
*   **Soil Incorporation:** Always incorporate granular fertilizers into the soil to minimize nutrient loss and ensure availability to roots.
*   **Irrigation:** Adequate moisture is essential for nutrient uptake. Irrigate after fertilizer application, especially in dry conditions.
*   **Organic Matter:** Regular addition of farmyard manure (FYM) or compost can significantly improve soil health, nutrient retention, and microbial activity, reducing the reliance on chemical fertilizers over time.
*   **Foliar Application:** While soil application is primary for macronutrients, in severe deficiency cases, a supplementary foliar spray of a balanced NPK fertilizer (e.g., 19:19:19 or 20:20:20) at 5-10 g/L water can provide a quick boost, but it is not a long-term solution for severe deficiencies.
*   **Consultation:** For precise recommendations tailored to your specific field conditions and Sagoan age, please consult with the experts at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU), Hisar, after obtaining your soil test report.
