As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for Sagoan (Teak, *Tectona grandis*) transplantation in Haryana:

### Ideal Transplantation Time for Sagoan

The optimal period for Sagoan (Teak) transplantation in Haryana is during the **monsoon season**. This typically falls between **July and August**, when the soil moisture is abundant and atmospheric humidity is high, which significantly aids in seedling establishment and reduces transplant shock.

### Ideal Transplantation Distance for Sagoan

The spacing for Sagoan depends on the specific objective (e.g., timber production, agroforestry, boundary planting).

*   For dedicated timber plantations, common recommended spacings are:
    *   **2.5 meters x 2.5 meters** (approximately 1600 plants per acre)
    *   **3 meters x 3 meters** (approximately 1100 plants per acre)
*   For agroforestry systems where intercropping is planned, wider spacing such as **4 meters x 4 meters** or even **5 meters x 5 meters** may be adopted to allow sufficient light and space for agricultural crops.

### Ideal Transplantation Process for Sagoan

1.  **Nursery Material Preparation:**
    *   Sagoan is commonly propagated using stumps (root-shoot cuttings) or polybag seedlings.
    *   **Stumps:** Ideal stumps should have a collar diameter of 1-2 cm, a shoot length of 2-3 cm, and a taproot of 15-20 cm. These are prepared from 12-18 month old nursery seedlings.
    *   **Polybag Seedlings:** Use healthy, vigorous seedlings grown in polybags for 6-9 months, ensuring a well-developed root system.

2.  **Pit Preparation:**
    *   Dig pits of appropriate size well in advance (at least 15-30 days) of transplantation.
    *   Recommended pit size: **45 cm x 45 cm x 45 cm**.
    *   Separate the topsoil from the subsoil. Allow the pits to weather under sun exposure, which helps in pest and disease control.

3.  **Soil Amendment:**
    *   Before planting, mix the excavated topsoil with well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost at a rate of **2-3 kg per pit**.
    *   If soil analysis indicates phosphorus deficiency, a small quantity of phosphatic fertilizer can be thoroughly mixed with the soil.
        *   **Diammonium phosphate** (DAP): 50-100 grams per pit
        *   **Single superphosphate** (SSP): 100-200 grams per pit

4.  **Transplantation:**
    *   Place the prepared stump or polybag seedling carefully in the center of the pit.
    *   Ensure the collar region (junction of root and shoot) is at ground level.
    *   For polybag seedlings, carefully remove the polybag without disturbing the root ball.
    *   Backfill the pit with the amended soil, gently firming around the plant to remove air pockets.

5.  **Initial Watering:**
    *   Immediately after transplantation, provide thorough watering to settle the soil around the roots.

6.  **Post-Transplantation Care:**
    *   **Weeding:** Regular weeding is crucial, especially during the initial establishment phase, to reduce competition for nutrients and moisture.
    *   **Protection:** Protect young plants from grazing animals and other physical damage.
    *   **Irrigation:** Provide supplemental irrigation during prolonged dry spells, particularly in the first 1-2 years, to ensure proper establishment and growth.
