Dear Farmer,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing pests in Sagoan (Teak) plantations in Haryana.

Here's how to address the pests you've mentioned:

1.  **Grasshopper:**
    Grasshoppers can cause defoliation, especially in young Sagoan plantations.
    *   **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect young plants for grasshopper presence and feeding damage.
    *   **Mechanical Control:** For small infestations, hand-picking and destroying grasshoppers can be effective.
    *   **Chemical Control:** If the infestation is severe, especially in young plantations, consider the following CIBRC approved insecticides:
        *   **Malathion** 50% EC at 2.5 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 0.5 ml per litre of water.
        *   Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage. Always follow label instructions for safety and application rates.

2.  **Painted bug:**
    This is not known to affect Sagoan.

3.  **Red cotton bug:**
    This is not known to affect Sagoan.

4.  **Black ants:**
    This is not known to affect Sagoan as a primary pest causing direct damage to the tree itself. While ants may be present, they are generally not considered a direct pest of Sagoan foliage or wood. Their presence is often associated with other issues like sap-sucking insects (e.g., aphids, mealybugs) which produce honeydew, or nesting in pre-existing dead or decaying wood. Addressing the primary issue (if any) that attracts the ants is usually more effective.
