As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide guidance on Sagoan (Teak, *Tectona grandis*), which is primarily a forest tree grown for timber. It's important to understand that Teak cultivation is a long-term forestry endeavor, not an annual agricultural crop.

Here is the information regarding maturity signs, harvesting time, and cutting process for Sagoan:

### Maturity Signs for Sagoan (Teak)

For timber trees like Sagoan, "maturity" refers to the point where the tree has reached an optimal size and age for timber production, maximizing both quantity and quality of heartwood. Unlike agricultural crops, there are no specific visual "signs" like fruit ripening. Instead, maturity is assessed based on:

*   **Age:** Teak is a long-rotation crop. Depending on the site quality, management practices, and desired timber product, Teak can be harvested anywhere from 20-25 years (for poles or smaller timber) to 50-80 years (for high-quality, large-diameter timber). In Haryana, growth rates can vary, but a rotation of 40-60 years is often considered for good quality timber.
*   **Diameter at Breast Height (DBH):** This is a key indicator. Trees are considered mature when they reach a commercially viable DBH, typically above 30-40 centimeters, depending on market demand and end-use.
*   **Heartwood Development:** The valuable part of Teak is its durable heartwood. Maturity implies sufficient development of heartwood, which increases with age.
*   **Growth Rate Decline:** As trees age, their annual growth increment (in terms of volume) tends to slow down. Harvesting is often planned when the annual volume increment begins to decline significantly, indicating that the tree has reached its economic maturity.

### Harvesting Time for Sagoan (Teak)

The harvesting time for Sagoan is determined by its rotation period, which is the planned cycle from planting to final felling. This is a strategic decision based on:

*   **Management Objectives:** Whether the goal is to produce small poles, medium-sized timber, or large, high-quality saw logs.
*   **Site Quality:** Better sites with fertile soil and adequate moisture will allow for shorter rotations to achieve desired dimensions.
*   **Economic Considerations:** Market demand, timber prices, and the cost of maintaining the plantation over a longer period.

In Haryana, under good management and suitable conditions, a typical rotation for quality timber might range from **40 to 60 years**. For agroforestry systems where trees are grown alongside crops, earlier thinnings might occur to provide intermediate income and reduce competition, but final harvest for prime timber is still a long-term prospect.

### Cutting Process for Sagoan (Teak)

The cutting process for Sagoan involves standard forestry felling techniques, prioritizing safety and efficient timber extraction. This is typically carried out by trained personnel.

1.  **Planning and Safety:**
    *   Assess the tree's lean, surrounding obstacles, and potential fall direction.
    *   Clear the area around the tree for safe working space and escape routes.
    *   Ensure all personnel wear appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), including helmets, eye protection, hearing protection, and cut-resistant clothing.

2.  **Directional Notch (Face Cut/Undercut):**
    *   A wedge-shaped cut is made on the side of the tree in the intended direction of fall.
    *   This cut typically involves a horizontal cut (the "top cut") and an angled cut (the "bottom cut") meeting to remove a wedge of wood. The depth of this notch is usually about one-fifth to one-third of the tree's diameter.

3.  **Back Cut (Felling Cut):**
    *   A horizontal cut is made on the opposite side of the tree, slightly above the horizontal cut of the directional notch.
    *   This cut is made towards the directional notch, leaving a hinge of wood between the back cut and the notch. The hinge helps to control the direction of the fall and prevents the tree from splitting or kicking back.

4.  **Felling:**
    *   As the back cut progresses, the tree will begin to fall in the direction of the notch. Wedges or felling levers may be used in the back cut to assist in directing the fall, especially for larger trees or those with a slight lean.
    *   Once the tree starts to fall, the feller must immediately retreat along a pre-planned escape route.

5.  **Limbing and Bucking:**
    *   After the tree is on the ground, branches (limbs) are removed (limbing) using a chainsaw or axe.
    *   The main stem is then cut into desired log lengths (bucking) based on market specifications and transport capabilities.

**Note:** No chemicals are typically used in the felling process of Sagoan for timber production. The process relies on mechanical cutting and skilled operation.
