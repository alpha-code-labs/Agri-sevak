As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned conditions in Sagoan (Teak) in Haryana:

**1. Scab in Sagoan:**
This is not known to affect Sagoan.

**2. Canker in Sagoan:**
Canker is a common disease in woody plants, including Sagoan, often caused by fungal pathogens. It manifests as sunken lesions on stems and branches, sometimes with gum exudation.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Prune infected branches during dry periods to prevent further spread. Ensure clean cuts and sterilize pruning tools between cuts.
    *   Avoid mechanical injuries to the bark, as these can serve as entry points for pathogens.
    *   Maintain overall tree health through proper nutrition and irrigation to enhance natural resistance.
*   **Chemical Control (for valuable trees or localized outbreaks):**
    *   For existing cankers, carefully scrape away the diseased bark until healthy tissue is exposed, then apply a fungicidal paste.
    *   For preventive measures or general control, foliar sprays can be considered.
    *   **Carbendazim 50% WP:** Apply at 0.5-1 g/L of water as a spray, or mix with a small amount of water to form a paste for direct application on scraped cankers.
    *   **Propiconazole 25% EC:** Apply at 0.5-1 ml/L of water as a spray.
    *   **Copper Oxychloride 50% WP:** Apply at 2-3 g/L of water as a spray, or mix with water to form a thick paste for direct application on scraped cankers.

**3. Gummosis in Sagoan:**
Gummosis is the exudation of gum from the bark of Sagoan trees. It is typically a symptom of underlying stress, which can include fungal infections (e.g., *Phytophthora* species), insect borers, or physiological disorders.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Identify and address the primary cause. If due to poor drainage, improve soil conditions.
    *   Avoid wounding the tree trunk and roots.
    *   Ensure balanced nutrition and adequate water supply to reduce tree stress.
    *   Remove any visible insect borers or their larvae if they are identified as the cause.
*   **Chemical Control (if fungal infection is suspected):**
    *   For localized gummosis, carefully scrape the affected bark to remove diseased tissue and apply a fungicidal paste.
    *   For systemic fungal issues, drenching or spraying may be required.
    *   **Copper Oxychloride 50% WP:** Apply at 2-3 g/L of water as a spray, or mix with water to form a thick paste for direct application on scraped areas.
    *   **Fosetyl-aluminium 80% WP:** Apply at 2-3 g/L of water as a drench around the base of the tree or as a foliar spray, particularly effective against *Phytophthora* related gummosis.

**4. Lichen in Sagoan:**
Lichen is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and an alga. It grows superficially on the bark of trees and is generally **non-parasitic**. Lichens do not draw nutrients from the tree and are not considered a disease or pest. Their presence often indicates good air quality and can be a sign of a healthy ecosystem.

*   **Control:**
    *   Control measures for lichen are generally **not recommended or necessary** as they do not harm the Sagoan tree.
    *   If their presence is aesthetically undesirable, improving tree vigor through proper cultural practices (e.g., balanced fertilization, adequate irrigation) can sometimes lead to faster bark shedding, which naturally reduces lichen growth.
    *   Avoid using chemical sprays specifically for lichen control, as these are usually unnecessary and can potentially harm the tree or the environment.
