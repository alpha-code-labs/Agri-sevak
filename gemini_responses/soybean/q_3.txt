As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide scientifically verified advice for managing various rot types in Soybean, focusing on practices and chemicals approved for use in Haryana, India.

Managing rot diseases in soybean requires an integrated approach combining cultural practices, resistant varieties, and judicious use of fungicides.

### General Management Strategies for Rot Diseases in Soybean:

1.  **Cultural Practices (Preventive Measures):**
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate soybean with non-host crops (e.g., cereals like wheat, maize) for at least 2-3 years to reduce pathogen inoculum in the soil.
    *   **Resistant Varieties:** Select and plant soybean varieties known to have resistance or tolerance to common rot diseases prevalent in your area (e.g., Phytophthora Root Rot, Sclerotinia Stem Rot).
    *   **Soil Drainage:** Ensure good field drainage to prevent waterlogging, which favors many rot-causing pathogens (e.g., *Phytophthora*, *Pythium*). Avoid planting in low-lying, poorly drained areas.
    *   **Seedbed Preparation:** Prepare a well-drained, firm seedbed to promote rapid germination and seedling vigor.
    *   **Planting Density & Spacing:** Maintain optimal plant spacing and avoid excessively dense stands, especially for diseases like Sclerotinia Stem Rot, which thrive in humid canopy environments.
    *   **Residue Management:** Incorporate or remove infected crop residues to reduce overwintering inoculum of pathogens like *Diaporthe* spp. and *Sclerotinia sclerotiorum*.
    *   **Irrigation Management:** Avoid over-irrigation, especially during critical growth stages, and use furrow irrigation where possible to keep foliage dry.
    *   **Weed Control:** Manage weeds effectively as they can act as alternate hosts or impede air circulation, increasing humidity.

2.  **Seed Treatment (for Seed Rot, Seedling Rot, and early Root/Collar Rots):**
    Seed treatment is crucial for protecting seeds and young seedlings from soil-borne pathogens causing damping-off, seed rot, and early root/collar rots (e.g., *Pythium*, *Phytophthora*, *Rhizoctonia*, *Fusarium*).

    *   **For broad-spectrum protection against various fungi and oomycetes:**
        *   **Carbendazim 12% + Mancozeb 63% WP:** 2.5-3.0 g/kg seed
        *   **Thiram 75% WS:** 2.5-3.0 g/kg seed
        *   **Captan 75% WS:** 2.5-3.0 g/kg seed
        *   **Carbendazim 50% WP:** 1.0-1.5 g/kg seed
        *   **Thiophanate Methyl 70% WP:** 1.0-1.5 g/kg seed
        *   **Pyraclostrobin 13.3% + Fluxapyroxad 13.3% FS:** 1.0-1.5 ml/kg seed
        *   **Azoxystrobin 2.5% + Fludioxonil 2.5% + Metalaxyl-M 1.0% FS:** 2.0-3.0 ml/kg seed

    *   **Specifically for Oomycetes (e.g., *Phytophthora*, *Pythium*):**
        *   **Metalaxyl 35% WS:** 2.0-3.0 g/kg seed
        *   **Metalaxyl-M 31.8% ES:** 3.0-4.0 ml/kg seed

3.  **Foliar/Soil Application (for Stem, Foot, Collar, Crown, and Pod Rots):**
    For established plants, especially when environmental conditions favor disease development, foliar or soil applications may be necessary.

    *   **For Sclerotinia Stem Rot (White Mold):** Apply at early flowering (R1-R3 stage) if conditions are favorable (cool, wet weather, dense canopy).
        *   **Thiophanate Methyl 70% WP:** 500-700 g/acre (dissolved in 200-300 L water)
        *   **Boscalid 25.2% + Pyraclostrobin 12.8% WG:** 300-400 g/acre (dissolved in 200-300 L water)

    *   **For Charcoal Rot (*Macrophomina phaseolina*):** While primarily managed by cultural practices and stress reduction, some fungicides can offer partial control.
        *   **Thiophanate Methyl 70% WP:** 500-700 g/acre (foliar spray)
        *   **Carbendazim 50% WP:** 250-300 g/acre (foliar spray)

    *   **For Pod and Stem Blight / Diaporthe Stem Canker:** Apply during reproductive stages (R3-R5) if disease pressure is high.
        *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:** 200 ml/acre
        *   **Pyraclostrobin 20% WG:** 150-200 g/acre
        *   **Thiophanate Methyl 70% WP:** 500-700 g/acre

    *   **For Southern Blight / Collar Rot (*Sclerotium rolfsii*):**
        *   **Carbendazim 50% WP:** 250-300 g/acre (as a soil drench around affected plants)
        *   **Validamycin 3% L:** 500-700 ml/acre (as a soil drench)

### Specific Rot Types:

*   **Root Rot, Stem Rot, Foot Rot, Collar Rot, Crown Rot, Seed Rot, Seedling Rot:** These are primarily addressed by the general cultural practices and seed treatments mentioned above, targeting pathogens like *Phytophthora*, *Rhizoctonia*, *Fusarium*, *Pythium*, *Sclerotinia*, and *Macrophomina*.
*   **Neck Rot:** This term is not commonly used as a distinct disease for soybean. Symptoms typically fall under collar, crown, or stem rots caused by the pathogens listed above.
*   **Black Rot:** This is not known to affect Soybean as a specific disease name. If black lesions are observed, they are likely symptoms of other diseases like Pod and Stem Blight, Anthracnose, or other fungal infections, which are covered by the broad-spectrum fungicides mentioned.
*   **Fruit Rot:** In soybean, this typically refers to pod rot, often associated with Pod and Stem Blight (*Diaporthe* spp.), Anthracnose (*Colletotrichum truncatum*), or other fungal infections exacerbated by wet conditions. Control measures for Pod and Stem Blight (foliar fungicides) will be effective.
