As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach for controlling Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies in Soybean, focusing on scientifically verified methods suitable for Haryana.

These pests can cause significant damage to soybean by defoliation, stem boring, or pod damage.

### Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Principles:

1.  **Regular Monitoring and Scouting:**
    *   Regularly inspect your soybean fields, especially during critical growth stages (vegetative to pod formation).
    *   Look for adult beetles, weevils, sawfly larvae, and signs of damage (e.g., holes in leaves, chewed leaf margins, stem damage, pod scarring).
    *   Early detection is key to effective management.

2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Timely Sowing:** Sow soybean at the recommended time for your region to avoid peak pest incidence.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate soybean with non-host crops to break the pest life cycle and reduce pest populations in the soil.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove crop residues after harvest to eliminate overwintering sites for some pests.
    *   **Weed Management:** Control weeds in and around the field, as many weeds can serve as alternate hosts for these pests.

3.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Conserve natural enemies such as predatory beetles, spiders, parasitic wasps, and entomopathogenic fungi, which can help keep pest populations in check. Avoid indiscriminate use of broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

### Chemical Control (When Necessary):

Chemical intervention should be considered when pest populations exceed economic threshold levels, which can vary based on the pest species and crop growth stage. Always consult local agricultural extension services for specific threshold recommendations.

When applying insecticides, ensure thorough coverage and use the recommended water volume (typically 200-400 litres per acre for ground sprays) for optimal efficacy.

Here are some CIBRC approved technical chemical names effective against beetles, weevils, and sawflies in soybean:

*   **For Defoliating Beetles (e.g., Flea Beetles, Leaf Beetles), Weevils, and Sawflies:**
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** (e.g., 4.9% CS formulation): 200-250 ml per acre.
    *   **Quinalphos** (e.g., 25% EC formulation): 600-800 ml per acre.
    *   **Chlorpyrifos** (e.g., 20% EC formulation): 500-1000 ml per acre (check specific label for soybean and target pest).
    *   **Thiamethoxam** (e.g., 25% WG formulation): 100 g per acre (particularly effective against flea beetles and some other chewing insects, also provides control of sucking pests).

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Read the Label:** Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the insecticide label regarding dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance in pest populations.
*   **Safety:** Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and application.
*   **Local Advice:** For the most precise and up-to-date recommendations, always consult with your local Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or agricultural extension officer at HAU, Hisar.
