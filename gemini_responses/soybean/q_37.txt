Protecting soybean crops from wild animals is a significant challenge for farmers in Haryana, leading to substantial yield losses. A multi-pronged approach combining physical barriers, cultural practices, and deterrents is most effective. Chemical repellents specifically approved by CIBRC for deterring large wild animals from field crops are very limited, and their efficacy can vary. Therefore, the focus is primarily on non-chemical methods.

Here are the recommended methods:

1.  **Physical Barriers:**
    *   **Fencing:**
        *   **Barbed Wire Fencing:** A common and relatively inexpensive option. Multiple strands (5-7) at varying heights can deter larger animals like nilgai and wild boar. Regular inspection and maintenance are crucial to ensure its integrity.
        *   **Electric Fencing:** Highly effective against a wide range of animals including nilgai, wild boar, and stray cattle. It delivers a non-lethal shock, deterring animals without causing harm. Requires proper installation, earthing, and regular maintenance (e.g., clearing vegetation around the fence to prevent short circuits). While the initial cost is higher, it can be cost-effective in the long run due to reduced crop damage.
        *   **Bio-fencing:** Planting thorny bushes like *Prosopis juliflora* (though invasive, it is often used) or *Acacia nilotica* around the field periphery can create a living barrier. This is a long-term solution and requires time to establish.
2.  **Acoustic and Visual Deterrents:**
    *   **Human Presence/Watchmen:** The most effective deterrent, especially during critical crop stages (flowering to pod development). Employing watchmen or farmers actively patrolling fields, particularly at dawn, dusk, and night, can significantly reduce damage.
    *   **Scarecrows and Reflective Devices:** While animals can habituate to these, rotating their location and combining them with other methods can enhance their effectiveness. Using reflective tapes, old CDs, or shiny objects that move with the wind can create visual disturbances.
    *   **Sound Devices:** Using crackers, drums, or even recorded sounds of predators or human voices can temporarily scare animals. However, animals often habituate quickly, so these should be used intermittently and unpredictably.
3.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Timely Harvesting:** Harvesting the crop as soon as it matures reduces the period of attraction for animals.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Removing crop residues and weeds from field edges can reduce hiding places and food sources for some animals, making the area less attractive.
    *   **Community-Based Approach:** Coordinated efforts among farmers in a village or cluster of villages to implement protection measures simultaneously can be more effective than individual efforts, as animals might simply move to unprotected fields.
4.  **Chemical Repellents:**
    *   Regarding chemical repellents, it is important to note that CIBRC-approved technical chemicals specifically formulated and approved for deterring large wild animals from field crops like soybean are very limited in India. Farmers should exercise caution and only use products that are explicitly approved for this purpose, following label instructions carefully. Currently, most effective strategies rely on physical and cultural methods.
