As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified seed and soil treatment processes for Soybean cultivation in Haryana:

### Recommended Seed Treatment Process for Soybean

Seed treatment is crucial for protecting soybean seedlings from early-season diseases and pests, ensuring better germination and stand establishment. The treatments should be applied sequentially:

1.  **Fungicidal Treatment:**
    *   Apply **Carbendazim** 12% + **Mancozeb** 63% WP @ 2.5 g/kg seed. This combination provides broad-spectrum protection against various seed-borne and soil-borne fungal diseases like damping-off, seed rot, and seedling blight.

2.  **Insecticidal Treatment (Optional, based on pest history/pressure):**
    *   Apply **Imidacloprid** 600 FS @ 5 ml/kg seed. This provides systemic protection against early-season sucking pests such as aphids, thrips, and whiteflies for up to 30-40 days after germination.

3.  **Bio-fertilizer Treatment:**
    *   After the chemical treatments, apply *Rhizobium japonicum* culture @ 5-10 g/kg seed.
    *   Also, apply *Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria (PSB)* culture @ 5-10 g/kg seed.
    *   Mix the seeds gently with these bio-fertilizers just before sowing. This enhances nitrogen fixation and phosphorus availability, respectively, leading to improved plant growth and yield.

**Note on Application Order:** Always apply fungicides first, followed by insecticides, and finally bio-fertilizers. Ensure the seeds are dry after each chemical application before proceeding to the next step, and sow the seeds as soon as possible after bio-fertilizer treatment.

### Recommended Soil Treatment Process for Soybean

Soil treatment focuses on managing soil-borne diseases and nematodes, contributing to long-term soil health and crop productivity.

1.  **Bio-fungicidal Treatment for Soil-borne Diseases:**
    *   Apply **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum** @ 2.5 kg/acre. Mix the bio-fungicide with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost. Broadcast this mixture evenly in the field before the last ploughing or at the time of sowing. This helps in suppressing various soil-borne fungal pathogens like *Rhizoctonia solani* and *Sclerotium rolfsii*.

2.  **Nematode Management (if history of nematode infestation):**
    *   **Biological Option:** Apply **Purpureocillium lilacinum** (a bio-nematicide) @ 2.5 kg/acre. Mix it with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed FYM or compost and broadcast evenly before the last ploughing or at sowing. This helps in managing plant-parasitic nematodes like root-knot nematodes.
    *   **Chemical Option (for severe infestations):** As an alternative or in addition to biological control for severe nematode problems, consider a pre-plant soil application or drench of **Fluopyram** 34.48% SC @ 125-250 ml/acre.

These recommendations are designed to provide comprehensive protection and enhance the productivity of soybean in the agro-climatic conditions of Haryana. Always ensure proper calibration of equipment and adherence to safety guidelines during application.
