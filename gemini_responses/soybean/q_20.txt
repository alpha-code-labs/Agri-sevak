Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I understand the critical role of micronutrients in achieving optimal soybean yields in Haryana. Addressing these deficiencies scientifically is key.

Here's how to address the common micronutrient deficiencies in Soybean:

**General Recommendation:**
Before any application, it is highly recommended to conduct a **soil test** to accurately diagnose the specific deficiency and its severity. Visual symptoms can be misleading and often overlap between different nutrient deficiencies.

### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

*   **Role:** Essential for enzyme activation, protein synthesis, and growth hormone production.
*   **Symptoms:** Stunted plant growth, small and narrow leaves (often called "little leaf"), interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, and delayed maturity.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application (Pre-sowing or at sowing):**
        *   Apply **Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate** (33% Zn) at 10-12 kg/acre.
        *   Alternatively, **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** (21% Zn) at 15-20 kg/acre.
    *   **Foliar Application (for quick correction or mild deficiency):**
        *   Spray **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** (21% Zn) at 0.5% concentration (5 g/L of water).
        *   Alternatively, **Zinc EDTA** (12% Zn) at 0.5-1 g/L of water.
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, starting from 20-30 days after sowing.

### 2. Iron (Fe) Deficiency

*   **Role:** Crucial for chlorophyll formation, photosynthesis, and respiration.
*   **Symptoms:** Prominent interveinal chlorosis on young leaves (yellowing between veins, while veins remain green), which can progress to almost white leaves in severe cases. Often observed in calcareous (high pH) soils.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application (most effective in high pH soils):**
        *   Spray **Ferrous Sulphate** (19% Fe) at 0.5-1% concentration (5-10 g/L of water).
        *   Alternatively, **Ferrous EDTA** (12% Fe) at 0.5-1 g/L of water.
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 7-10 day intervals, starting when symptoms appear.

### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

*   **Role:** Important for cell wall formation, sugar transport, pollen germination, and seed development.
*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, deformed or thickened new leaves, poor flowering and pod set, cracking of stems and petioles, and hollow stems.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application (Pre-sowing):**
        *   Apply **Borax (Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate)** (10.5% B) at 2-4 kg/acre.
        *   Alternatively, **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (20.5% B) at 1-2 kg/acre.
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray **Borax (Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate)** at 0.1-0.2% concentration (1-2 g/L of water).
        *   Alternatively, **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** at 0.5-1 g/L of water.
        *   Apply 1-2 sprays, one at pre-flowering and another at early pod development stage.

### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

*   **Role:** Essential for cell wall structure, cell division, and membrane function.
*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, deformation or necrosis (death) of young leaves and growing points, "tip burn" on new leaves, and poor root development. Deficiency is less common in Haryana soils unless highly acidic or very sandy.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application (Pre-sowing or at sowing):**
        *   Apply **Gypsum (Calcium Sulphate)** at 200-400 kg/acre (also helps in sodic soils).
        *   Alternatively, **Calcium Nitrate** at 10-15 kg/acre.
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray **Calcium Nitrate** at 0.5-1% concentration (5-10 g/L of water).
        *   Alternatively, **Calcium Chloride** at 0.2-0.4% concentration (2-4 g/L of water).
        *   Apply 1-2 sprays during vegetative growth.

### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

*   **Role:** Central component of chlorophyll, vital for photosynthesis, and activates many enzymes.
*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves (yellowing between veins, while veins remain green), which can progress to reddish-purple discoloration. Leaves may become brittle.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application (Pre-sowing or at sowing):**
        *   Apply **Magnesium Sulphate** at 10-20 kg/acre.
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray **Magnesium Sulphate** at 0.5-1% concentration (5-10 g/L of water).
        *   Apply 1-2 sprays, starting when symptoms appear, at 10-15 day intervals.

### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

*   **Role:** Involved in photosynthesis, nitrogen metabolism, and enzyme activation.
*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, often with a "herringbone" pattern, similar to iron deficiency but usually less severe. Growth may be stunted.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application (most effective in high pH soils):**
        *   Spray **Manganese Sulphate** (30.5% Mn) at 0.5-1% concentration (5-10 g/L of water).
        *   Alternatively, **Manganese EDTA** (12% Mn) at 0.5-1 g/L of water.
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 7-10 day intervals, starting when symptoms appear.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Water Volume:** For foliar sprays, ensure adequate water volume (typically 200-250 L/acre for field crops) for thorough coverage.
*   **Timing:** Early detection and application are crucial for effective correction and minimizing yield loss.
*   **Compatibility:** Always check the compatibility of micronutrient fertilizers if mixing with other pesticides or fertilizers. Perform a small jar test first.
*   **Prevention:** Regular soil testing and balanced fertilization based on soil test reports are the best preventive measures.

Always consult your local agricultural extension specialist for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions.
