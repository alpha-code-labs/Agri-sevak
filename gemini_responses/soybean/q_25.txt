Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice on irrigation management for Soybean cultivation in Haryana.

Soybean (Glycine max) is primarily a rainfed Kharif crop in many regions, but supplemental irrigation is crucial in Haryana to stabilize yields, especially during dry spells or when rainfall is erratic. Proper irrigation management can significantly enhance productivity.

### Importance of Irrigation in Soybean

Soybean has several critical growth stages where water availability is paramount. Water stress during these periods can lead to significant yield losses. Conversely, excessive irrigation can cause waterlogging, leading to root rot and reduced yields.

### First Irrigation

The timing of the first irrigation is critical and depends heavily on the rainfall pattern and soil moisture status after sowing.

*   **Timing:**
    *   If there is no effective rainfall after sowing, the first irrigation may be required around **20-25 days after sowing (DAS)**, coinciding with the branching stage.
    *   However, if adequate rainfall is received post-sowing, the first irrigation can be delayed until the **pre-flowering stage (around 35-40 DAS)**.
    *   The key is to ensure the crop does not experience water stress during its early vegetative growth and especially as it approaches flowering.
*   **Indicators:** Observe the crop for signs of wilting, especially during the hotter parts of the day. Check soil moisture by hand – if the soil feels dry 10-15 cm deep, irrigation is needed.
*   **Quantity:** Apply a light irrigation of approximately **50-60 mm (5-6 cm)** of water. This ensures adequate moisture penetration without causing waterlogging.

### Second and Subsequent Irrigations

Subsequent irrigations are crucial during the reproductive stages, which are highly sensitive to water stress.

*   **Timing:**
    *   **Flowering Stage (around 40-60 DAS):** This is one of the most critical stages. Water stress during flowering can lead to flower abortion and poor pod setting.
    *   **Pod Development and Seed Filling Stage (around 60-80 DAS):** This is another highly critical period. Adequate moisture is essential for proper pod development and the accumulation of dry matter in the seeds, directly impacting yield and seed quality.
    *   The need for subsequent irrigations should be determined based on rainfall, soil type, and crop condition. In a typical dry spell during the Kharif season, 1-2 additional irrigations might be required after the first one.
*   **Indicators:** Continue to monitor the crop for wilting symptoms and check soil moisture. The period from flowering to pod filling is particularly sensitive.
*   **Quantity:** Each irrigation should be around **50-60 mm (5-6 cm)** of water. Avoid heavy irrigations that can lead to waterlogging.

### Sprinkler Use in Soybean

Sprinkler irrigation is an excellent method for soybean cultivation in Haryana, offering several advantages, especially in water-scarce regions.

*   **Advantages:**
    *   **Water Use Efficiency:** Sprinklers apply water more uniformly and with higher efficiency (typically 70-85%) compared to traditional flood irrigation, significantly reducing water wastage. This is crucial for Haryana's dwindling groundwater resources.
    *   **Uniform Application:** Ensures even distribution of water across the field, leading to uniform crop growth and better yields.
    *   **Suitable for Undulating Terrain:** Can be effectively used on uneven fields where flood irrigation is difficult or leads to uneven water distribution.
    *   **Reduced Runoff and Leaching:** Minimizes water loss through surface runoff and deep percolation.
    *   **Soil Conservation:** Reduces soil erosion, especially on slopy lands.
    *   **Fertigation:** Allows for the application of water-soluble fertilizers along with irrigation water (fertigation), improving nutrient use efficiency.
*   **Types of Sprinklers:** Various types can be used, including:
    *   **Portable Sprinkler Systems:** Common for smaller fields.
    *   **Rain Guns:** Suitable for larger areas, providing a wider coverage.
    *   **Micro-sprinklers:** Can be used for precise application, though less common for broadacre soybean.
*   **Application Strategy:**
    *   **Timing:** Apply during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize evaporative losses.
    *   **Duration:** Adjust the duration of sprinkling based on the soil type, desired water depth, and sprinkler discharge rate. Aim for the recommended 50-60 mm per irrigation.
    *   **Pressure:** Maintain optimal operating pressure for the specific sprinkler system to ensure uniform water distribution.

### General Recommendations

*   **Soil Type:** Lighter soils (sandy loams) will require more frequent but lighter irrigations, while heavier soils (clay loams) can hold moisture longer and require less frequent but potentially slightly heavier irrigations.
*   **Weather Conditions:** Adjust irrigation schedules based on rainfall and temperature. During hot, dry, and windy periods, the crop's water requirement increases.
*   **Avoid Waterlogging:** Soybean is highly sensitive to waterlogging, which can lead to root rot (e.g., Phytophthora root rot) and significant yield reduction. Ensure proper drainage and avoid over-irrigation.
*   **Mulching:** Using crop residues as mulch can help conserve soil moisture, reduce evaporation, and suppress weeds, thereby reducing the overall irrigation requirement.

By carefully managing irrigation, especially during the critical growth stages and by adopting water-efficient methods like sprinklers, farmers in Haryana can achieve stable and higher soybean yields.
