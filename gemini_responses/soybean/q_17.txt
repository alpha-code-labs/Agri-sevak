Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University, I am pleased to provide you with scientifically verified recommendations for the application of organic manures in Soybean cultivation in Haryana. Organic manures are crucial for improving soil health, nutrient availability, and overall crop productivity.

Here are the recommended doses:

*   **Farm Yard Manure (FYM):**
    *   Apply **5-10 tonnes per acre** of well-decomposed FYM.
    *   **Application Timing:** It should be incorporated into the soil 2-3 weeks before sowing the soybean crop. This allows for proper decomposition and nutrient release.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   Apply **2-4 tonnes per acre** of high-quality vermicompost.
    *   **Application Timing:** Similar to FYM, it should be incorporated into the soil 1-2 weeks before sowing. Vermicompost is richer in nutrients than FYM, so a lower quantity is effective.

*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract based Bio-stimulant):**
    *   **Sagarika** is a seaweed extract-based bio-stimulant, not a bulk organic manure. It enhances plant growth, nutrient uptake, and stress tolerance.
    *   **Foliar Spray:**
        *   First spray: **250-500 ml per acre** (mixed in 150-200 litres of water) at 30-40 days after sowing (vegetative growth stage).
        *   Second spray: **250-500 ml per acre** (mixed in 150-200 litres of water) at 60-70 days after sowing (flowering/pod development stage).
    *   **Application Timing:** Apply as a foliar spray during critical growth stages to maximize its benefits. Ensure good coverage of the foliage.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Soil Testing:** Always conduct a soil test to understand your specific soil nutrient status and pH. This helps in fine-tuning the manure and fertilizer recommendations.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management:** For optimal results, organic manures should be used as part of an integrated nutrient management strategy, complementing recommended doses of chemical fertilizers based on soil test reports.
*   **Quality of Manure:** Ensure that FYM and vermicompost are well-decomposed and free from weed seeds and pathogens.

These recommendations aim to improve soil fertility, enhance microbial activity, and support healthy soybean growth, leading to better yields.
