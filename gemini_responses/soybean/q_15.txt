As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Soybean in Haryana:

### Grasshopper Control in Soybean

Grasshoppers can cause significant defoliation, especially during the early vegetative stages of soybean. Effective management involves regular monitoring and timely intervention.

*   **Monitoring:** Regularly scout your soybean fields, particularly during the seedling and early vegetative growth stages. Look for grasshopper nymphs and adults. An economic threshold level (ETL) for intervention is typically when defoliation reaches 20% before flowering or 10% after flowering, or if you observe 10-15 grasshoppers per square meter.
*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Maintain good field sanitation by keeping the field and surrounding bunds free of weeds, which can serve as alternate hosts and breeding sites for grasshoppers.
    *   Deep ploughing after harvest can expose grasshopper eggs laid in the soil to predators and adverse weather conditions, reducing the next generation's population.
*   **Chemical Control (when ETL is reached):**
    *   Apply insecticides when grasshopper populations reach the economic threshold, preferably targeting younger nymphs for better efficacy. Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.
    *   **Quinalphos** 25 EC @ 1.0 L per acre in 200-300 L of water.
    *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20 EC @ 1.0 L per acre in 200-300 L of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5 EC @ 200 ml per acre in 200-300 L of water.
    *   **Fipronil** 5 SC @ 400-600 ml per acre in 200-300 L of water.
    *   **Indoxacarb** 14.5 SC @ 200 ml per acre in 200-300 L of water.
    *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5 SG @ 80 g per acre in 200-300 L of water.

### Other Pests

*   **Painted bug (Bagrada hilaris):** This is not known to affect Soybean.
*   **Red cotton bug (Dysdercus cingulatus):** This is not known to affect Soybean.
*   **Black ants:** This is not known to affect Soybean as a direct pest causing significant economic damage. Control is generally not required unless they are associated with other honeydew-producing pests (like aphids or mealybugs), in which case the primary honeydew-producing pest should be targeted.
