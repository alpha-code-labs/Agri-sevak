As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I must provide scientifically verified advice. Based on current agricultural knowledge and disease epidemiology in Haryana, please note the following regarding your query for Soybean:

*   **Dieback:** This is not known to affect Soybean as a specific disease entity. Dieback is typically a term used for woody plants, trees, and shrubs, referring to the progressive death of twigs, branches, or roots starting from the tips. While soybeans can exhibit symptoms of plant death from the top downwards due to various stem rots, wilts, or environmental stresses, "Dieback" is not a recognized disease name for soybean.

*   **Twig blight:** This is not known to affect Soybean. Twig blight is a disease primarily affecting woody plants, trees, and shrubs, causing blighting of twigs and small branches. Soybeans do not have "twigs" in the botanical sense, and diseases affecting their stems or petioles are referred to by other specific names (e.g., stem blight, stem canker).

*   **Tikka disease:** This is not known to affect Soybean. Tikka disease is a very common and significant leaf spot disease, but it is specific to Groundnut (Peanut), caused by *Cercospora arachidicola* and *Phaeoisariopsis personata*. Soybeans are affected by other leaf spot diseases such as Frogeye leaf spot (*Cercospora sojina*) or Septoria brown spot (*Septoria glycines*), but not "Tikka disease."

Therefore, specific control measures for "Dieback," "Twig blight," and "Tikka disease" in Soybean cannot be provided as these conditions/diseases are not known to affect this crop. If you are observing symptoms of plant death, stem lesions, or leaf spots in your soybean crop, please provide more detailed descriptions or images for accurate diagnosis and appropriate recommendations.
