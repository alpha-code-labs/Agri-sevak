As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for the control of pests in Soybean in Haryana:

### Control of Borers, Caterpillars, and Leaf folder in Soybean

It is crucial to adopt an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods for sustainable pest control.

#### Diamondback Moth (*Plutella xylostella*)

This is not known to affect Soybean. Diamondback moth is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops like cabbage, cauliflower, and mustard.

#### Borers (Stem Borer, Pod Borer), Caterpillars (e.g., Gram Pod Borer, Tobacco Caterpillar, Semiloopers, Bihar Hairy Caterpillar), and Leaf folder

These pests are significant in Soybean and often require similar management strategies.

**I. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies:**

1.  **Regular Monitoring:** Regularly scout fields (at least twice a week) to detect pest incidence, identify the pest species, and assess population levels. Look for eggs, larvae, feeding damage, and folded leaves.
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Timely Sowing:** Sow soybean varieties at the recommended time to avoid peak pest infestation periods.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy crop residues and weeds that can harbor pests.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops to break the pest life cycle.
    *   **Trap Cropping:** Planting castor or marigold as trap crops around soybean fields can attract *Spodoptera litura* and *Helicoverpa armigera*, respectively, away from the main crop.
3.  **Biological Control:**
    *   **Conservation of Natural Enemies:** Protect and encourage natural predators (e.g., spiders, ladybird beetles, lacewings) and parasitoids (e.g., *Trichogramma* spp.) that feed on pest eggs and larvae.
    *   **Pheromone Traps:** Install pheromone traps for *Helicoverpa armigera* and *Spodoptera litura* at 5 traps per acre for monitoring and mass trapping to reduce male populations.
    *   **Biopesticides:** Apply formulations of *Bacillus thuringiensis* (Bt) when larvae are young.

**II. Chemical Control (When pest population crosses Economic Threshold Level - ETL):**

When pest populations exceed the Economic Threshold Level (ETL), chemical intervention may be necessary. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

For Borers (Stem Borer, Pod Borer), Caterpillars, and Leaf folder, the following CIBRC approved technical chemicals can be used:

*   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** Apply at 60 ml per acre. Effective against a wide range of lepidopteran pests including stem borers, pod borers, and leaf folders.
*   **Emamectin Benzoate 5% SG:** Apply at 80-100 g per acre. Highly effective against various lepidopteran larvae like pod borers, semiloopers, and leaf folders.
*   **Indoxacarb 14.5% SC:** Apply at 200 ml per acre. Effective against pod borers and semiloopers.
*   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** Apply at 200 ml per acre. A broad-spectrum insecticide effective against defoliating caterpillars and pod borers.
*   **Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki (Bt) formulations:** Apply at 500-1000 g per acre (for WP/DF) or 1-2 L per acre (for liquid formulations). This biological insecticide is effective against young larvae of caterpillars and leaf folders.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label for correct dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Ensure thorough spray coverage for optimal efficacy.
*   Apply insecticides preferably in the evening or early morning to minimize impact on beneficial insects and pollinators.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension specialists for the most current recommendations and pest situation in your specific area of Haryana.
