As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the use of Growth Regulators/Hormones and Boron in Soybean for Haryana:

1.  **Ethephon**
    *   This is not known to be recommended as a general growth regulator for yield enhancement in Soybean by Haryana Agricultural University. While **Ethephon** is a plant growth regulator, its primary uses in agriculture are often for defoliation or fruit ripening in other crops. Its application as a growth regulator for soybean in Haryana is not a standard or recommended practice for improving yield.

2.  **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid**
    *   This is not known to affect Soybean positively as a growth regulator. **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid** is a broadleaf herbicide and is highly phytotoxic to soybean, which is also a broadleaf crop. Its application, even at very low concentrations, will cause severe damage, malformations, and significant yield loss to soybean. It is strictly not recommended for use on soybean.

3.  **Boron**
    *   Boron is an essential micronutrient for soybean, crucial for cell wall formation, sugar transport, flowering, pollen viability, pod setting, and seed development. It is not a hormone but its adequate supply is vital for optimal growth and and yield.
    *   **Foliar Application (for deficiency correction or prophylactic measure):**
        *   **Technical Chemical Name:** **Sodium tetraborate decahydrate** (commonly known as Borax)
        *   **Recommended Dose:** 1.5 - 2.0 g per litre of water (0.15 - 0.2% solution).
        *   **Timing:** Apply at the pre-flowering or early flowering stage (R1-R2 stage) when the first flowers appear. Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.
    *   **Soil Application (if severe deficiency is confirmed by soil test):**
        *   **Technical Chemical Name:** **Sodium tetraborate decahydrate** (commonly known as Borax)
        *   **Recommended Dose:** 1.0 - 2.0 kg per acre.
        *   **Timing:** Apply uniformly at the time of sowing or before sowing, mixed with fertilizers.
