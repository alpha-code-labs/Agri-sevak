Regarding the control of sucking pests in Soybean, here is the scientifically verified advice from Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar):

Firstly, regarding Psylla: This is not known to affect Soybean.

For Aphids, Leafhopper, Whitefly, and Thrips, an integrated pest management (IPM) approach is highly recommended:

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Timely Sowing:** Sow soybean at the recommended time for your region to avoid peak pest incidence periods.
*   **Weed Management:** Keep fields free of weeds, as many weeds can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush growth that is more attractive and susceptible to sucking pests.

**2. Monitoring and Economic Threshold Level (ETL):**
*   Regularly scout your fields (at least twice a week) to monitor pest populations. Early detection is crucial.
*   Apply insecticides only when pest populations reach the Economic Threshold Level (ETL) to conserve natural enemies and prevent resistance development. For most sucking pests in soybean, an ETL of 10-15% infested plants or 2-3 pests per leaf is often considered.

**3. Biological Control:**
*   Conserve natural enemies like ladybird beetles, lacewings, syrphid fly larvae, and parasitic wasps, which naturally prey on or parasitize these pests. Avoid indiscriminate use of broad-spectrum insecticides that can harm these beneficial insects.

**4. Chemical Control (when ETL is reached):**
When chemical intervention is necessary, choose CIBRC approved insecticides and rotate them to prevent resistance development. Ensure thorough spray coverage.

*   **For Aphids, Leafhopper, Whitefly, and Thrips:**
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: 125-150 ml per acre (or 0.6-0.75 ml per litre of water).
    *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: 100-125 g per acre (or 0.5-0.6 g per litre of water).
    *   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP: 100-125 g per acre (or 0.5-0.6 g per litre of water).

*   **Specifically for Whitefly and Thrips (and mites):**
    *   **Diafenthiuron** 50% WP: 250-300 g per acre (or 1.25-1.5 g per litre of water).

*   **Specifically for Whitefly nymphs and Hoppers (Insect Growth Regulator):**
    *   **Buprofezin** 25% SC: 500-625 ml per acre (or 2.5-3.1 ml per litre of water).

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and strictly follow the label instructions for the chosen insecticide regarding dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Use an appropriate spray volume (typically 150-200 litres of water per acre) to ensure good coverage of the plant canopy.
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in pest populations.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for specific recommendations based on current pest pressure and local conditions in your area.
