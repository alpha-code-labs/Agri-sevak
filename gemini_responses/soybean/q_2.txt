As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding rust diseases in Soybean for Haryana.

First, let's clarify which of the mentioned rust types are known to affect Soybean:

*   **Black Rust:** This is not known to affect Soybean.
*   **Brown Rust:** This is not known to affect Soybean.
*   **Yellow Rust (Stripe Rust):** This is not known to affect Soybean.
*   **White Rust:** This is not known to affect Soybean.

The primary rust disease affecting Soybean is **Soybean Rust**, caused by *Phakopsora pachyrhizi*, often referred to as Asian Soybean Rust (ASR). This disease can manifest with reddish-brown pustules, which might be broadly termed "Red Rust" in some contexts.

### Control Measures for Soybean Rust (*Phakopsora pachyrhizi*)

Soybean rust is a serious disease that can lead to significant yield losses if not managed effectively. An integrated approach combining cultural practices and timely chemical intervention is recommended.

**1. Cultural Practices:**

*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available and suitable for Haryana's agro-climatic conditions, planting resistant or tolerant varieties can be the most economical and effective control measure. Consult with HAU for the latest recommendations on suitable varieties.
*   **Timely Sowing:** Sowing soybean at the recommended time can help the crop escape the peak period of disease development.
*   **Crop Rotation:** While rust spores can travel long distances, crop rotation can help reduce local inoculum levels if alternative hosts are present.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Removing and destroying infected crop debris after harvest can reduce the survival of fungal spores, though long-distance spore dispersal is a major factor for this disease.

**2. Chemical Control (Fungicides):**

Fungicides are crucial for managing soybean rust, especially when environmental conditions are favorable for disease development (e.g., prolonged leaf wetness, moderate temperatures). Timely application is key, ideally at the first sign of symptoms or preventatively if the disease is known to be prevalent in the area and conditions are conducive.

Always ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the underside of the leaves where pustules often develop. Use sufficient water volume (e.g., 200-300 L/acre) for effective coverage. Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

Here are some CIBRC approved technical chemical names for rust control in Soybean:

*   **Propiconazole** 25% EC: Apply at 500 ml/acre.
*   **Tebuconazole** 25.9% EC: Apply at 250-300 ml/acre.
*   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC: Apply at 200 ml/acre.
*   **Pyraclostrobin** 20% WG: Apply at 150-200 g/acre.
*   **Azoxystrobin 11% + Tebuconazole 18.3% SC:** Apply at 300-400 ml/acre.
*   **Kresoxim-methyl 15% + Epoxiconazole 15% SE:** Apply at 300-400 ml/acre.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Scouting:** Regularly monitor your soybean fields for early signs of rust, especially during the reproductive stages.
*   **Timing:** The first fungicide application is generally recommended at the R1 (beginning bloom) to R3 (beginning pod) growth stages, or immediately upon detection of the disease. Subsequent applications may be needed depending on disease pressure and weather conditions, following label recommendations for re-application intervals.
*   **Adjuvants:** Always check the fungicide label for recommendations on using spreading/sticking agents (adjuvants) to improve efficacy.
