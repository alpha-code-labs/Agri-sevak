As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Soybean in Haryana. It is crucial to follow label instructions for all chemical applications and prioritize integrated disease management practices.

Here's how to control the specified fungal diseases in Soybean:

### 1. Alternaria Leaf Spot (Caused by *Alternaria spp.*)

This disease is characterized by small, dark, irregular spots on leaves, often with concentric rings.
*   **Cultural Practices:** Use resistant varieties, practice crop rotation, and ensure proper plant spacing for good air circulation.
*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
    *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP: 1.5-2 kg/acre (or 2.5-3 g/L of water)
    *   **Chlorothalonil** 75% WP: 1.25 kg/acre (or 2 g/L of water)
    *   **Tebuconazole** 25.9% EC: 250-300 ml/acre (or 0.5 ml/L of water)
    *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC: 200 ml/acre (or 0.4 ml/L of water)

### 2. Anthracnose (Caused by *Colletotrichum truncatum*)

Anthracnose can affect leaves, stems, pods, and seeds, causing dark, sunken lesions.
*   **Cultural Practices:** Use disease-free seeds, practice crop rotation, and manage crop residues.
*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
    *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: 250-500 g/acre (or 0.5-1 g/L of water)
    *   **Thiophanate-methyl** 70% WP: 280-400 g/acre (or 0.5-0.8 g/L of water)
    *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC: 200 ml/acre (or 0.4 ml/L of water)
    *   **Pyraclostrobin 5% + Metiram 55% WG:** 1.25-1.5 kg/acre (or 2.5-3 g/L of water)

### 3. Blast

This is not a major or commonly reported fungal disease of Soybean in Haryana.

### 4. Blight (e.g., Rhizoctonia Aerial Blight, Cercospora Blight)

*   **Rhizoctonia Aerial Blight (Caused by *Rhizoctonia solani*)**: Characterized by water-soaked lesions on leaves and stems, often leading to defoliation.
    *   **Cultural Practices:** Improve drainage, avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, and ensure proper plant spacing.
    *   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
        *   **Validamycin** 3% L: 1-1.5 L/acre (or 2-3 ml/L of water)
        *   **Propiconazole** 25% EC: 200 ml/acre (or 0.4 ml/L of water)
        *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC: 200 ml/acre (or 0.4 ml/L of water)
*   **Cercospora Blight / Purple Seed Stain (Caused by *Cercospora kikuchii*)**: Causes reddish-purple spots on leaves and purple discoloration of seeds.
    *   **Cultural Practices:** Use resistant varieties and practice crop rotation.
    *   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
        *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: 250-500 g/acre (or 0.5-1 g/L of water)
        *   **Chlorothalonil** 75% WP: 1.25 kg/acre (or 2 g/L of water)
        *   **Tebuconazole** 25.9% EC: 250-300 ml/acre (or 0.5 ml/L of water)

### 5. Brown Spot (Caused by *Septoria glycines*)

This disease causes small, dark brown, angular spots on leaves, starting from lower leaves and progressing upwards.
*   **Cultural Practices:** Use resistant varieties, practice crop rotation, and manage crop residues.
*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
    *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP: 1.5-2 kg/acre (or 2.5-3 g/L of water)
    *   **Chlorothalonil** 75% WP: 1.25 kg/acre (or 2 g/L of water)
    *   **Tebuconazole** 25.9% EC: 250-300 ml/acre (or 0.5 ml/L of water)
    *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC: 200 ml/acre (or 0.4 ml/L of water)

### 6. Downy Mildew (Caused by *Peronospora manshurica*)

Characterized by pale green to yellow spots on the upper leaf surface and a grayish-purple fungal growth on the corresponding lower surface.
*   **Cultural Practices:** Use resistant varieties and practice crop rotation.
*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
    *   **Metalaxyl 8% + Mancozeb 64% WP:** 500 g/acre (or 1 g/L of water)
    *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC: 200 ml/acre (or 0.4 ml/L of water)
    *   **Chlorothalonil** 75% WP: 1.25 kg/acre (or 2 g/L of water)

### 7. Powdery Mildew (Caused by *Microsphaera diffusa*)

Appears as white, powdery patches on the upper and lower surfaces of leaves, stems, and pods.
*   **Cultural Practices:** Use resistant varieties and ensure good air circulation.
*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
    *   **Sulphur** 80% WP: 1.5-2 kg/acre (or 2.5-3 g/L of water)
    *   **Tebuconazole** 25.9% EC: 250-300 ml/acre (or 0.5 ml/L of water)
    *   **Hexaconazole** 5% EC: 400-500 ml/acre (or 0.8-1 ml/L of water)

### 8. Grey Mildew

This is not a recognized or commonly reported fungal disease of Soybean.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Timing of Application:** Fungicides are most effective when applied preventively or at the very early stages of disease development.
*   **Water Volume:** Ensure adequate water volume (typically 200-250 liters per acre for field crops) for thorough coverage.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
*   **Integrated Pest Management (IPM):** Always integrate chemical control with cultural practices, use of resistant varieties, and field sanitation for sustainable disease management.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and application of chemicals.
*   **Local Conditions:** Consult with your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and current disease pressure.
