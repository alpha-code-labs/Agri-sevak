Mites, including the Red spider mite (*Tetranychus urticae*) and other potential mite species like eriophyid mites (sometimes referred to as rust mites due to symptoms), are significant pests of soybean, particularly under hot and dry weather conditions in Haryana. They can cause considerable damage by sucking sap from the leaves, leading to significant yield losses if not managed effectively.

**Symptoms of Mite Damage:**
*   Initial symptoms appear as yellowish-white speckles (stippling) on the upper surface of the leaves.
*   As infestation progresses, leaves develop a bronzed or reddish-brown discoloration.
*   Severely infested leaves may turn yellow, dry up, and drop prematurely.
*   Fine silken webbing can be observed on the underside of leaves and between leaves, especially in the case of red spider mites.
*   Overall plant vigor is reduced, leading to stunted growth and poor pod formation.

**Integrated Mite Management (IMM) Strategies:**

1.  **Monitoring:**
    *   Regularly inspect the underside of soybean leaves, especially during dry periods, for the presence of mites, their eggs, and webbing. Early detection is crucial for timely intervention.
    *   Pay close attention to field edges and areas near dusty roads, as infestations often start there.

2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Irrigation:** Ensure adequate and timely irrigation to reduce plant stress. Well-watered plants are generally more tolerant to mite infestations.
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the field and surrounding areas free of weeds, as many weeds can serve as alternate hosts for mites, allowing them to multiply and spread to the soybean crop.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive use of nitrogenous fertilizers, which can promote lush, succulent growth that is more attractive to mites.

3.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Conserve natural enemies such as predatory mites (*Amblyseius* spp.), ladybird beetles, lacewings, and minute pirate bugs, which prey on various mite species. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that can harm these beneficial insects.

4.  **Chemical Control (Acaricides):**
    *   Apply acaricides when mite populations reach economic threshold levels (e.g., 5-10 mites per leaf or significant visible damage across the field).
    *   Ensure thorough coverage of the underside of the leaves, as mites primarily reside there.
    *   Rotate different classes of acaricides to prevent the development of resistance in mite populations.
    *   **Recommended CIBRC-approved acaricides for Soybean in Haryana (apply in 200-300 litres of water per acre):**
        *   **Propargite 57% EC:** 600-800 ml per acre.
        *   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** 300-400 ml per acre.
        *   **Fenpyroximate 5% SC:** 300-400 ml per acre.
        *   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP:** 1.5-2.0 kg per acre (effective against a broad range of mites, including eriophyid mites, and also acts as a fungicide).
        *   **Abamectin 1.9% EC:** 200-250 ml per acre.
