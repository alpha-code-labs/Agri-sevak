As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified information regarding specialized practices in Soybean cultivation relevant to Haryana:

*   **Pruning:**
    *   Soybean is an annual crop primarily grown for its seeds.
    *   Pruning, which involves the removal of plant parts, is **not a standard or recommended practice** in soybean cultivation.
    *   Any removal of leaves or branches would generally reduce the plant's photosynthetic capacity and could lead to a decrease in overall yield.

*   **Desuckering:**
    *   This is not known to affect Soybean.
    *   Soybean plants do not produce suckers in a manner that requires desuckering. This practice is typically associated with crops like sugarcane or banana.

*   **Mulching:**
    *   Mulching can be a beneficial practice in soybean cultivation, particularly in Haryana, to conserve soil moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature.
    *   **Benefits:**
        *   **Moisture Conservation:** Reduces evaporation from the soil surface, which is crucial during dry spells and for efficient water use.
        *   **Weed Suppression:** Acts as a physical barrier, inhibiting weed germination and growth, thereby reducing competition for nutrients and water.
        *   **Soil Temperature Regulation:** Helps to keep the soil cooler during hot periods and can moderate temperature fluctuations.
        *   **Soil Health Improvement:** Organic mulches decompose over time, contributing to soil organic matter and improving soil structure.
    *   **Types of Mulch:**
        *   **Organic Mulches:** Crop residues from previous crops (e.g., wheat straw, rice straw) are commonly used and are readily available in Haryana.
        *   **Plastic Mulches:** While less common for large-scale soybean compared to high-value vegetable crops, plastic films (e.g., black polyethylene) can also be used for similar benefits.

*   **Grafting:**
    *   This is not known to affect Soybean.
    *   Soybean is an annual crop propagated by seeds, and grafting is not a standard or practical horticultural practice for its commercial cultivation.

*   **Pollination:**
    *   Soybean is primarily a **self-pollinated crop**.
    *   The flowers are perfect (containing both male and female reproductive organs) and are largely cleistogamous, meaning pollination often occurs before the flower fully opens.
    *   Cross-pollination by insects is generally very low (typically less than 1-2%) and is not significant for commercial seed production.
    *   Therefore, specialized practices for enhancing pollination (e.g., introducing pollinators) are **not required** for soybean cultivation.
