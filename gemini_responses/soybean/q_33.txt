As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling weeds in Soybean in Haryana. Effective weed management is crucial for maximizing soybean yield.

**Integrated Weed Management Strategy:**
A combination of cultural practices and timely chemical application is recommended for comprehensive weed control.

**I. Cultural Practices:**
1.  **Timely Sowing:** Sowing soybean at the recommended time helps the crop establish quickly and compete better with weeds.
2.  **Seedbed Preparation:** A well-prepared, fine seedbed reduces initial weed emergence.
3.  **Clean Seed:** Use certified, weed-free soybean seeds to prevent the introduction of new weed seeds, especially Amarbail.
4.  **Inter-row Cultivation:** One or two inter-row cultivations (hoeing/weeding) between 20-40 days after sowing can effectively control weeds, especially in wider row spacing.

**II. Chemical Control (Herbicides):**
Herbicides can be applied as pre-emergence (before weed emergence) or post-emergence (after weed emergence).

**A. Pre-emergence Herbicides (Apply within 0-3 days after sowing):**
These herbicides are applied to the soil surface after sowing but before crop and weed emergence. They are crucial for controlling early flushes of weeds and are particularly important for parasitic weeds like Amarbail. Ensure adequate soil moisture for optimal efficacy.

*   **For Broadleaf, Narrow leaf weeds, Bathu, Congress grass, and Amarbail suppression:**
    *   **Pendimethalin** 30% EC: Apply 1.0 kg a.i./acre (equivalent to 3.3 Litres of product per acre) mixed in 200-250 Litres of water.
    *   **Metribuzin** 70% WP: Apply 0.25-0.35 kg a.i./acre (equivalent to 350-500 grams of product per acre) mixed in 200-250 Litres of water.
    *   **Clomazone** 50% EC: Apply 0.5 kg a.i./acre (equivalent to 1.0 Litre of product per acre) mixed in 200-250 Litres of water. This is particularly effective against Amarbail.
    *   **Flumioxazin** 50% SC: Apply 0.05-0.075 kg a.i./acre (equivalent to 100-150 grams of product per acre) mixed in 200-250 Litres of water. Also provides good control of Amarbail.

**B. Post-emergence Herbicides (Apply 15-25 days after sowing, or when weeds are at 2-4 leaf stage):**
These herbicides are applied after the weeds have emerged. Timely application is critical for best results.

*   **For Broadleaf Weeds (e.g., Bathu, Congress grass, general broadleaf weeds):**
    *   **Chlorimuron ethyl** 25% WP: Apply 9-10 g a.i./acre (equivalent to 36-40 grams of product per acre) mixed in 200-250 Litres of water. Add a non-ionic surfactant as per product label.
    *   **Fomesafen** 25% SL: Apply 250 g a.i./acre (equivalent to 1.0 Litre of product per acre) mixed in 200-250 Litres of water.
    *   **Lactofen** 24% EC: Apply 100-120 g a.i./acre (equivalent to 400-500 ml of product per acre) mixed in 200-250 Litres of water.

*   **For Narrow leaf Weeds (e.g., Phalaris minor, general grasses):**
    *   **Quizalofop ethyl** 5% EC: Apply 50 g a.i./acre (equivalent to 1.0 Litre of product per acre) mixed in 200-250 Litres of water.
    *   **Fluazifop-P-butyl** 13.4% EC: Apply 125-150 g a.i./acre (equivalent to 900-1100 ml of product per acre) mixed in 200-250 Litres of water.
    *   **Fenoxaprop-P-ethyl** 9% EC: Apply 60-70 g a.i./acre (equivalent to 650-750 ml of product per acre) mixed in 200-250 Litres of water.
    *   **Clethodim** 24% EC: Apply 120-150 g a.i./acre (equivalent to 500-625 ml of product per acre) mixed in 200-250 Litres of water.

*   **For Mixed Weeds (Broadleaf and Narrow leaf weeds):**
    *   **Imazethapyr** 10% SL: Apply 75-100 g a.i./acre (equivalent to 750-1000 ml of product per acre) mixed in 200-250 Litres of water. This herbicide provides control of both broadleaf and narrow leaf weeds.
    *   Alternatively, a tank mix of a broadleaf specific herbicide and a grass specific herbicide can be used, provided their compatibility is confirmed by the manufacturer.

**III. Specific Weed Control Notes:**

*   **Amarbail (Cuscuta spp.):**
    *   Pre-emergence application is the most effective strategy. **Clomazone**, **Flumioxazin**, and **Pendimethalin** are recommended.
    *   Post-emergence control is very difficult once Amarbail has established. Early application of **Imazethapyr** can provide some suppression.
    *   Preventive measures like using clean seed and avoiding contaminated farmyard manure are crucial.

*   **Bathu (Chenopodium album) & Congress grass (Parthenium hysterophorus):**
    *   Both pre-emergence (**Pendimethalin**, **Metribuzin**) and post-emergence (**Chlorimuron ethyl**, **Imazethapyr**, **Fomesafen**, **Lactofen**) herbicides are effective.

*   **Phalaris minor:**
    *   While more common in wheat, if present, post-emergence grass-specific herbicides like **Quizalofop ethyl**, **Fluazifop-P-butyl**, **Fenoxaprop-P-ethyl**, or **Clethodim** are highly effective. Pre-emergence **Pendimethalin** offers some suppression.

*   **Orobanche (Broomrape):**
    *   This is not known to affect Soybean. Orobanche is a parasitic weed primarily affecting crops like mustard, tobacco, tomato, and brinjal.

**IV. General Precautions:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the herbicide label carefully.
*   Use the recommended dosage and water volume.
*   Ensure uniform spray coverage.
*   Calibrate your sprayer before application.
*   Apply herbicides when there is no strong wind to avoid drift.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application.
*   Rotate herbicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of herbicide resistance.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for specific advice tailored to your field conditions.
