As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following cultivation practices for Soybean in Haryana:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   **Row Sowing:** Soybean should always be sown in rows using a seed drill. This ensures uniform spacing, facilitates inter-cultivation, and improves light penetration and air circulation within the canopy.
    *   **Ridge and Furrow Method:** In areas prone to waterlogging or for efficient water management, sowing on ridges can be beneficial. This helps in better drainage during heavy rains and efficient irrigation during dry spells.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   The optimal planting depth for Soybean seeds is **3-5 cm**. Sowing too shallow can lead to poor germination due to lack of moisture or bird damage, while sowing too deep can result in delayed emergence and reduced plant stand.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   **Row-to-Row Spacing:** Maintain a distance of **45 cm** between rows. This allows for adequate light interception and air movement, reducing the incidence of diseases and facilitating weeding operations.
    *   **Plant-to-Plant Spacing:** Aim for a plant-to-plant distance of **5-7 cm** within the row. This ensures an optimal plant population for maximum yield.

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   A seed dose of **25-30 kg per acre** is generally recommended for most improved Soybean varieties grown in Haryana. This rate ensures a healthy plant population, considering typical seed size and germination rates. Adjustments may be needed based on specific variety (seed size) and germination percentage.
