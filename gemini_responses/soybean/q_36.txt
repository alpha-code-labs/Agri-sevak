As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified practices to improve yield, fruit (seed) quality, and storage life for Soybean in Haryana:

---

### I. Improving Yield

1.  **Variety Selection:**
    *   Choose high-yielding, short-duration, and disease-resistant varieties suitable for Haryana's agro-climatic conditions. Recommended varieties include JS 335, JS 93-05, JS 95-60, SL 958, SL 525, and DS 2706.

2.  **Optimal Sowing Time:**
    *   Sow during the optimal window from mid-June to mid-July for best yields.

3.  **Seed Rate and Spacing:**
    *   Use a seed rate of 60-75 kg/acre.
    *   Maintain a row-to-row spacing of 45 cm and plant-to-plant spacing of 5-7 cm.

4.  **Seed Treatment:**
    *   Treat seeds before sowing for protection against early-season pests and diseases, and to enhance nutrient uptake.
    *   **Fungicide:** Treat with **Carbendazim** (1 g/kg seed) + **Thiram** (2 g/kg seed) OR **Pyraclostrobin** (0.5 g/kg seed) + **Fluxapyroxad** (0.5 g/kg seed).
    *   **Insecticide:** Treat with **Imidacloprid** (1.25 ml/kg seed) OR **Thiamethoxam** (1.25 g/kg seed).
    *   **Bio-fertilizer:** Inoculate with *Rhizobium japonicum* (5-10 g/kg seed) and Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria (PSB) (5-10 g/kg seed) for improved nitrogen fixation and phosphorus availability.

5.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Nitrogen (N):** Apply 20 kg N/acre as a starter dose (e.g., 45 kg Urea/acre). *Rhizobium* inoculation largely fulfills N requirements.
    *   **Phosphorus (P):** Apply 60-80 kg P2O5/acre (e.g., 130-175 kg DAP/acre). P is crucial for root development and pod formation.
    *   **Potassium (K):** Apply 40 kg K2O/acre (e.g., 65 kg MOP/acre). K enhances overall plant health, stress tolerance, and seed filling.
    *   **Sulphur (S):** Apply 20 kg S/acre (e.g., 200 kg Gypsum/acre or through Single Super Phosphate). S is vital for oil synthesis and protein content.
    *   **Zinc (Zn):** Apply 10 kg **Zinc sulphate** (21%) /acre at sowing, or a foliar spray of 0.5% solution (5 g/L water) at 30-45 days after sowing (DAS).
    *   **Boron (B):** Apply a foliar spray of 0.2% **Borax** solution (2 g/L water) at the flowering stage to improve pod setting.
    *   **Molybdenum (Mo):** In areas with potential Mo deficiency (less common in Haryana's alkaline soils but beneficial), apply as seed treatment with **Sodium molybdate** (0.5 g/kg seed) or a foliar spray of 0.05% solution (0.5 g/L water) at 30-45 DAS.

6.  **Water Management:**
    *   Soybean is sensitive to water stress, especially during critical stages: flowering, pod formation, and seed filling. Provide 1-2 irrigations if rainfall is insufficient during these periods.

7.  **Weed Management:**
    *   Effective weed control is crucial, especially during the first 30-45 DAS.
    *   **Pre-emergence:** Apply **Pendimethalin** (1.0 kg a.i./acre) within 3 days of sowing.
    *   **Post-emergence:** Apply **Imazethapyr** (100 g a.i./acre) or a tank mix of **Quizalofop-p-ethyl** (50 g a.i./acre) + **Chlorimuron ethyl** (9 g a.i./acre) at 15-20 DAS.

8.  **Pest and Disease Management:**
    *   Implement an Integrated Pest and Disease Management (IPDM) approach. Regularly scout fields and apply CIBRC approved pesticides/fungicides as per HAU recommendations only when economic threshold levels are reached.

### II. Improving Fruit Quality (Seed Quality and Pod Filling)

1.  **Balanced Nutrition:**
    *   Ensure adequate and balanced supply of Phosphorus, Potassium, Sulphur, Boron, and Molybdenum, as these nutrients are critical for proper seed development, oil content, and protein synthesis.

2.  **Water Stress Avoidance:**
    *   Prevent water stress during the pod development and seed filling stages, as this directly impacts seed size, weight, and overall quality.

3.  **Pest and Disease Control:**
    *   Protect pods and developing seeds from insect pests (e.g., pod borers, girdle beetles) and diseases (e.g., rust, anthracnose) that can cause shriveling, discoloration, and reduced quality.

4.  **Timely Harvesting:**
    *   Harvest at physiological maturity when 80-85% of the pods have turned yellow and leaves have shed. Delayed harvesting can lead to shattering losses and reduced seed viability.

### III. Improving Storage Life

1.  **Optimal Harvesting Moisture:**
    *   Harvest soybean when the seed moisture content is between 13-15%. Harvesting at higher moisture can lead to mold growth, while harvesting at very low moisture increases shattering.

2.  **Proper Drying:**
    *   Dry the harvested seeds to a safe moisture level of 8-10% for long-term storage. This is critical to prevent fungal growth, insect infestation, and maintain seed viability. Use sun drying or mechanical dryers, ensuring even drying.

3.  **Cleaning and Grading:**
    *   Thoroughly clean the seeds to remove all foreign matter (chaff, stones, weed seeds, broken grains, soil particles). This reduces pest harborage and improves aeration in storage.

4.  **Storage Structure:**
    *   Store cleaned and dried seeds in clean, dry, well-ventilated, rodent-proof, and insect-proof structures. Traditional storage structures should be properly cleaned and disinfected before use. Modern storage bins (e.g., metal bins, Pusa bins) are recommended.

5.  **Pest Management in Storage:**
    *   **Sanitation:** Ensure the storage premises are thoroughly cleaned and free of old grain residues before storing new produce.
    *   **Fumigation:** If insect infestation is observed in stored grains, fumigate with **Aluminium phosphide** tablets (1-2 tablets of 3 g each per tonne of grain) for 5-7 days under airtight conditions. This must be done by trained personnel following safety protocols.
    *   **Regular Inspection:** Periodically inspect stored grains for signs of moisture ingress, temperature fluctuations, and pest activity. Take corrective measures promptly.
