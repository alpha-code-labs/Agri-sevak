As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm that:

This is not known to affect Soybean.

Scale insects and Mealybugs are generally not considered significant or common pests of soybean in Haryana. Soybean is an annual crop, and these pests are more frequently associated with perennial plants, horticultural crops, or other field crops like cotton or sugarcane. Therefore, specific control measures for these pests are typically not required for soybean cultivation in the region.
