As a Senior Agronomist, I must clarify that **transplantation is generally not recommended or practiced for Soybean cultivation.** Soybeans are typically direct-seeded.

Here's why transplantation is not ideal for Soybean and the recommended practices for direct seeding in Haryana:

**Why Transplantation is Not Recommended for Soybean:**
*   **Taproot System:** Soybeans develop a strong taproot system. Transplanting can damage this delicate taproot, leading to transplant shock, stunted growth, and reduced yield.
*   **Stress:** The process of uprooting and re-establishing plants causes significant stress, which soybeans are particularly sensitive to, especially during their early growth stages.
*   **Cost and Labor:** Transplanting is labor-intensive and costly, making it economically unviable for a field crop like soybean.

**Ideal Direct Sowing Practices for Soybean in Haryana:**

Given that direct seeding is the standard and recommended method, here are the ideal practices:

1.  **Ideal Sowing Time:**
    *   The optimal time for sowing Soybean in Haryana is from **last week of June to mid-July**, coinciding with the onset of the monsoon. Early sowing with adequate moisture is crucial for good establishment and yield.

2.  **Ideal Sowing Distance (Spacing):**
    *   **Row-to-Row Distance:** Maintain a distance of **45 cm** between rows.
    *   **Plant-to-Plant Distance:** Aim for a plant-to-plant distance of **5-7 cm** within the row. This can be achieved by using a seed drill with appropriate plate settings or by thinning if necessary after emergence.

3.  **Ideal Sowing Process:**
    *   **Field Preparation:** Prepare a well-pulverized and level seedbed. One deep ploughing followed by 2-3 harrowing operations is generally sufficient.
    *   **Seed Treatment:** Always treat seeds with fungicides and insecticides before sowing to protect against early-season diseases and pests.
        *   For fungal diseases: **Carbendazim** (1 g/kg seed) + **Thiram** (2 g/kg seed) OR **Carboxin** (1.5 g/kg seed) + **Thiram** (1.5 g/kg seed).
        *   For insect pests: **Imidacloprid** (5 g/kg seed) OR **Thiamethoxam** (3 g/kg seed).
        *   For nitrogen fixation: Inoculate seeds with **Rhizobium japonicum** culture (5-10 g/kg seed) just before sowing, after chemical seed treatment.
    *   **Sowing Method:** Use a seed drill for uniform sowing depth and spacing.
    *   **Sowing Depth:** Sow seeds at a depth of **3-5 cm**. Deeper sowing can delay emergence, while shallower sowing can lead to poor germination due to moisture stress or bird damage.
    *   **Seed Rate:** The recommended seed rate is typically **60-75 kg/acre**, depending on seed size and germination percentage, to achieve the desired plant population.

By adhering to these direct sowing practices, farmers can ensure healthy crop establishment and maximize soybean yields in Haryana.
