As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling soil pests like termites and root-knot nematodes in soybean cultivation in Haryana.

Both termites and root-knot nematodes are significant soil-borne pests that can cause substantial yield losses in soybean if not managed effectively. An integrated pest management (IPM) approach, combining cultural practices with judicious use of CIBRC-approved chemicals, is recommended.

### 1. Control of Termites (e.g., *Odontotermes obesus*, *Microtermes obesi*) in Soybean

Termites can damage germinating seeds, seedlings, and even mature plants by feeding on roots and stems, leading to wilting and plant death.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Termites:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Deep Summer Plowing:** Exposes termite colonies to sunlight and predators, disrupting their nests.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove crop residues, stubble, and woody debris from the field, as these can serve as food sources for termites.
    *   **Use of Well-Decomposed FYM:** Avoid using undecomposed organic matter, which can attract termites.
    *   **Timely Sowing:** Ensure optimal soil moisture conditions for quick germination and establishment, making plants less vulnerable.

**Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved):**

*   **Seed Treatment (for early protection):**
    *   Treat soybean seeds before sowing with an insecticide to protect them during germination and early seedling stages.
        *   **Fipronil 5% SC:** Apply at 2-3 ml per kg of seed.

*   **Soil Application (if severe infestation is anticipated or observed):**
    *   For fields with a history of severe termite infestation, a pre-sowing or at-sowing soil application can be beneficial.
        *   **Fipronil 0.3% GR:** Apply at 10-15 kg per acre, broadcast evenly and incorporate into the soil before sowing, or apply in furrows at the time of sowing.

### 2. Control of Root-Knot Nematodes (e.g., *Meloidogyne incognita*, *M. javanica*) in Soybean

Root-knot nematodes cause characteristic galls or swellings on the roots, impairing the plant's ability to absorb water and nutrients. This leads to stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, reduced nodulation, and significant yield reduction.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Root-Knot Nematodes:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate soybean with non-host crops like cereals (wheat, maize, sorghum) for at least 2-3 years to reduce nematode populations in the soil.
    *   **Summer Plowing:** Deep plowing during hot summer months exposes nematode eggs and larvae to desiccation and sunlight, reducing their numbers.
    *   **Use of Resistant/Tolerant Varieties:** If available and suitable for Haryana's agro-climatic conditions, choose soybean varieties known for resistance or tolerance to root-knot nematodes.
    *   **Solarization:** In small areas, covering moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets during peak summer can raise soil temperatures sufficiently to kill nematodes.
    *   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporating well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost can improve soil health and promote beneficial microorganisms that antagonize nematodes.

**Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved):**

*   **Seed Treatment (for early protection):**
    *   Treating seeds with a nematicide provides protection to young seedlings during the critical early growth phase.
        *   **Fluopyram 34.48% SC:** Apply at 1.5-2 ml per kg of seed.

*   **Soil Application (if severe infestation is anticipated or seed treatment is not sufficient):**
    *   For fields with high nematode populations, granular nematicides can be applied at the time of sowing.
        *   **Carbofuran 3% G:** Apply at 10-13 kg per acre, applied in furrows at the time of sowing.
        *   **Phorate 10% G:** Apply at 4 kg per acre, applied in furrows at the time of sowing.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully, including dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and pest pressure.
*   Promote soil health through balanced fertilization and organic matter addition to enhance the natural resilience of the crop against pests.
