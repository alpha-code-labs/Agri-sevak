As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified recommendations for Grape cultivation practices in Haryana:

It is important to note that commercial grape cultivation is primarily done through **vegetative propagation** using rooted cuttings or grafted plants, not by sowing seeds. Sowing seeds is generally reserved for breeding new varieties. Therefore, the terms "sowing method" and "seed dose" are not applicable to commercial grape cultivation.

Here are the recommended practices for planting grapevines:

*   **Propagation Method:**
    *   Commercial grape cultivation in Haryana primarily relies on planting **rooted cuttings** or **grafted plants**. These are typically obtained from certified nurseries to ensure disease-free and true-to-type planting material.
    *   Commonly used methods include hardwood cuttings (for rootstock or own-rooted varieties) or grafting (for scion varieties onto suitable rootstocks).

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   When planting rooted cuttings or grafted plants, ensure that the **graft union (if applicable) remains 10-15 cm above the soil surface** to prevent scion rooting.
    *   For own-rooted cuttings, plant them deep enough so that the entire root system is well covered, typically with the top bud of the cutting just above the soil level, or the original soil line of the nursery plant maintained. A general planting depth for the root ball is around **30-45 cm**.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   The optimal spacing for grapevines depends on the variety, soil fertility, and the training system adopted (e.g., Bower, T-Bar, Y-Trellis). For Haryana conditions, considering common training systems like Bower, the following spacing is generally recommended:
        *   **Row-to-Row Spacing:** **3.0 - 4.5 meters**
        *   **Plant-to-Plant Spacing:** **3.0 - 4.5 meters**
    *   A common spacing for the Bower system is **3.0 m x 3.0 m** or **4.5 m x 4.5 m**. For high-density planting or specific trellis systems, spacing can be adjusted, but these are general guidelines for robust growth and yield.

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   This is **not applicable** to commercial grape cultivation, as grapes are propagated vegetatively using cuttings or grafted plants, not by sowing seeds.
