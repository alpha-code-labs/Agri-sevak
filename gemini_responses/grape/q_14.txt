As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling soil pests like termites and root-knot nematodes in grape cultivation in Haryana.

It is crucial to adopt an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods for sustainable control.

### Control of Termites in Grape

Termites (e.g., *Odontotermes obesus*, *Microtermes obesi*) can cause significant damage to grapevines, especially young plants, by feeding on roots and the base of the stem, leading to wilting, poor growth, and even plant death.

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   Ensure good field sanitation by removing dead wood, stumps, and other organic debris from the vineyard, which can serve as termite food sources.
*   Avoid direct contact of wooden stakes or trellises with the soil if possible, or use treated wood.
*   Regularly inspect the base of the vines for mud tubes, which are a clear sign of termite activity.

**2. Chemical Control:**
*   **Pre-planting Soil Treatment:**
    *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC**: Mix 2.5 litres in 500-1000 litres of water and apply uniformly to one acre of land before planting, incorporating it into the soil. This creates a chemical barrier.
*   **Post-planting (for existing infestation):**
    *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC**: Mix 2.5-5 ml per litre of water and drench 1-2 litres of this solution around the base of each affected vine. Ensure the solution penetrates the soil to reach the termite galleries.
    *   **Fipronil 5% SC**: Mix 1.5-2 ml per litre of water and drench 1-2 litres of this solution around the base of each affected vine.

### Control of Nematodes (Root-knot) in Grape

Root-knot nematodes (*Meloidogyne* spp.) are a major threat to grapevines, causing characteristic galls or swellings on the roots. This damage impairs the plant's ability to absorb water and nutrients, leading to stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, reduced vigour, and significant yield losses.

**1. Cultural and Biological Control:**
*   **Resistant Rootstocks:** Where available and suitable for Haryana's soil and climatic conditions, planting grapevines grafted on nematode-resistant rootstocks is the most effective long-term solution. Consult HAU for recommended rootstock varieties.
*   **Soil Solarization:** In nursery beds or planting pits, especially during hot summer months (May-June), cover moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks. This raises soil temperature sufficiently to kill nematodes and other soil-borne pathogens.
*   **Organic Matter Addition:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost (10-15 tonnes per acre) into the soil. This improves soil health, enhances beneficial microbial activity (some of which are antagonistic to nematodes), and can reduce nematode populations.
*   **Marigold Intercropping/Rotation:** Growing marigolds (Tagetes spp.) as a trap crop or intercrop can help reduce nematode populations in the soil due to nematicidal compounds released by their roots. (More practical for pre-planting or in fallow periods).

**2. Chemical Control (Nematicides):**
*   **Fluopyram 34.48% SC**: Mix 0.625 ml per litre of water (e.g., 250 ml in 400 litres of water per acre) and apply as a drench around the root zone of the vines. This is a modern, effective nematicide. Follow label instructions for application timing and frequency.
*   **Carbofuran 3% G**: Apply 10-13 kg per acre by broadcasting around the root zone of the vines and lightly incorporating into the soil, followed by irrigation. **Caution: Carbofuran is highly toxic. Handle with extreme care, wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), and strictly follow safety guidelines.**
*   **Phorate 10% G**: Apply 4-6 kg per acre by broadcasting around the root zone of the vines and lightly incorporating into the soil, followed by irrigation. **Caution: Phorate is highly toxic. Handle with extreme care, wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), and strictly follow safety guidelines.**

**Important Considerations for Chemical Application:**
*   Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the product label regarding dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Wear appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) including gloves, mask, and protective clothing during handling and application of all chemicals.
*   Avoid applying chemicals during flowering to protect pollinators.
*   Consult with HAU experts or your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and the latest approved practices.
