Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, I can provide you with the scientifically verified recommendations for grape transplantation in Haryana.

### Ideal Transplantation Time for Grape

The ideal time for transplanting grapevines in Haryana is during their dormant period, which allows the plant to establish roots before the onset of active growth.

*   **Late Winter to Early Spring:** The best period is typically from **January to February**. This timing ensures that the plants are dormant and can establish themselves before the hot summer months and the monsoon season.

### Ideal Transplantation Distance for Grape

The spacing for grapevines depends significantly on the variety, the training system (e.g., Bower, Trellis, Head system), and soil fertility. However, general recommendations for commercial cultivation in Haryana are:

*   **Row-to-Row Distance:** 2.5 to 3.0 meters
*   **Plant-to-Plant Distance:** 1.5 to 2.0 meters

For specific high-yielding varieties or specialized training systems like the Bower system, wider spacing might be adopted, for example, 3.0 m x 3.0 m or even 4.5 m x 4.5 m.

### Ideal Transplantation Process for Grape

A meticulous transplantation process is crucial for successful establishment and long-term productivity of grapevines.

1.  **Site Selection and Soil Preparation:**
    *   **Site:** Choose a site with good sunlight exposure and excellent drainage. Grapes prefer deep, well-drained loamy soils.
    *   **Soil Testing:** Conduct a soil test to determine nutrient status and pH. Grapes thrive in a pH range of 6.5 to 7.5.
    *   **Land Preparation:** Deep plough the field (up to 60-90 cm) to break hardpans, followed by harrowing to achieve a fine tilth. Level the land to ensure uniform irrigation.

2.  **Pit Digging and Preparation:**
    *   **Pit Size:** Dig pits of **60 cm x 60 cm x 60 cm** (Length x Width x Depth) at the marked planting distances.
    *   **Pit Filling:** Allow the pits to weather for 15-20 days. Then, refill each pit with a mixture of:
        *   Topsoil
        *   15-20 kg of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost
        *   500 g of **Single Super Phosphate**
        *   250 g of **Muriate of Potash**
        *   (Optional, if soil test indicates deficiency) 25 g of a suitable micronutrient mixture.
    *   Mix these components thoroughly and fill the pits, allowing the soil to settle.

3.  **Selection of Planting Material:**
    *   Use healthy, well-rooted cuttings or grafted plants from a reputable nursery. Ensure the plants are free from pests and diseases.
    *   For grafted plants, ensure the graft union is strong and healthy.

4.  **Planting Procedure:**
    *   **Timing:** Plant during the recommended period (January-February).
    *   **Placement:** Carefully remove the plant from its nursery bag or pot, ensuring the root ball remains intact. Place the plant in the center of the prepared pit.
    *   **Graft Union:** If using grafted plants, ensure the graft union is positioned at least **10-15 cm above the soil line** to prevent scion rooting and potential disease issues.
    *   **Backfilling:** Backfill the pit with the remaining prepared soil, gently firming it around the roots to remove any air pockets. Avoid compacting the soil too much.
    *   **Watering:** Immediately after planting, provide a thorough watering to settle the soil around the roots.

5.  **Post-Planting Care:**
    *   **Staking:** Provide immediate support to the young vine with a sturdy stake (e.g., bamboo or wooden stick) to guide its initial growth and protect it from wind damage.
    *   **Irrigation:** Maintain adequate moisture, especially during the establishment phase. Avoid waterlogging.
    *   **Pest and Disease Management:** Monitor for early signs of pests and diseases and take appropriate control measures as per HAU recommendations.
    *   **Training:** Begin training the vine according to the chosen system (e.g., single stem to a wire) as soon as new growth appears.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure a successful establishment of your grape vineyard in Haryana.
