As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified recommendations for Grape cultivation in Haryana:

### Seed Treatment for Grape

Seed treatment is not applicable for commercial grape cultivation as grapes are propagated vegetatively (primarily through cuttings or grafting), not from seeds. Therefore, there is no conventional "seed treatment" process for grapes.

### Soil Treatment Process for Grape

Soil treatment is a critical step for establishing a healthy grape vineyard. It involves both general preparatory practices and specific treatments based on soil analysis and historical pest/disease incidence.

**A. Pre-Plant Soil Preparation (General Practices):**

1.  **Soil Testing:** Conduct a comprehensive soil test well in advance of planting to determine nutrient status (macro and micronutrients), pH, electrical conductivity (EC), and presence of soil-borne pathogens or nematodes. This forms the basis for all subsequent treatments.
2.  **Organic Matter Incorporation:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost at a rate of 20-30 tonnes per acre during the final ploughing. This improves soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability.
3.  **Deep Ploughing and Levelling:** Deep ploughing (up to 45-60 cm) helps break hardpans, improves aeration, and facilitates root penetration. Follow with proper levelling to ensure uniform irrigation.
4.  **Soil Solarization (if applicable):** In areas with known problems of soil-borne pathogens (e.g., Fusarium, Pythium, Rhizoctonia) or nematodes, soil solarization can be effective. This involves covering moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks during hot summer months (May-June) to raise soil temperature and kill pests/pathogens.

**B. Specific Soil Treatments (Based on Soil Test Results and Field History):**

These treatments should only be applied if a specific problem is identified through soil testing or if there is a history of the pest/disease in the area.

*   **For Nematode Management (if soil test indicates high population):**
    *   **Chemical Treatment (Pre-plant incorporation):**
        *   **Carbofuran 3% G:** Apply 10-15 kg per acre, incorporated into the soil before planting.
        *   **Phorate 10% G:** Apply 4-6 kg per acre, incorporated into the soil before planting.
    *   **Biological Treatment (Pre-plant incorporation):**
        *   **Paecilomyces lilacinus (or Purpureocillium lilacinum) (1x10^8 CFU/g):** Mix 2.5 kg per acre with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed FYM or compost and broadcast evenly, incorporating into the soil.

*   **For Soil-borne Fungal Diseases (e.g., Root Rot, Damping-off, Pythium, Phytophthora - if history exists):**
    *   **Chemical Treatment (Pre-plant drench or incorporation):**
        *   **Carbendazim 50% WP:** Drench the planting pits with a solution of 1-2 g per litre of water before or at the time of planting.
        *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride 72.2% SL:** Drench the planting pits with a solution of 2-3 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Biological Treatment (Pre-plant incorporation or drench):**
        *   **Trichoderma viride (1x10^8 CFU/g):** Mix 2.5 kg per acre with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed FYM or compost and broadcast evenly, incorporating into the soil. Alternatively, drench planting pits with a solution of 5 g per litre of water.

*   **For Termite Control (if prevalent in the area):**
    *   **Chemical Treatment (Pre-plant drench):**
        *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC:** Drench the planting pits or mix with irrigation water at a rate of 2-4 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Fipronil 0.3% G:** Apply 10-15 kg per acre, incorporated into the soil before planting.

Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions when handling and applying any chemical or biological agents. Regular monitoring and integrated pest management (IPM) practices are crucial for long-term vineyard health.
