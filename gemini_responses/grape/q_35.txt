As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding grape maturity, harvesting, and cutting processes for growers in Haryana:

### Maturity Signs for Grape

Determining the correct maturity is crucial for optimal taste, quality, and shelf life of grapes. Key indicators include:

*   **Colour Change:** Berries change from green to their characteristic varietal colour (e.g., amber for Perlette, reddish-purple for Flame Seedless, dark purple for Beauty Seedless). This is a primary visual cue.
*   **Taste and Flavour:** The most reliable indicator for table grapes. Berries should be sweet with a balanced acidity, characteristic of the variety. Acidity decreases and sugar content increases as grapes mature.
*   **Total Soluble Solids (TSS/Brix):** Measured using a refractometer, this indicates the sugar content. For most table grape varieties grown in Haryana, a TSS level of **16-20% Brix** is generally desirable, though specific varieties may vary.
*   **Sugar-Acid Ratio:** This ratio (TSS/Titratable Acidity) is a better indicator of flavour balance than TSS alone. A higher ratio indicates greater sweetness and lower tartness.
*   **Berry Softness:** Berries become softer but still firm and plump. Over-ripe grapes will be excessively soft and prone to shattering.
*   **Ease of Separation:** Mature berries detach more easily from the pedicel (small stem attached to the berry) with a gentle pull.
*   **Seed Colour (for seeded varieties):** Seeds turn from green to light brown or dark brown.

### Harvesting Time for Grape

*   **Timing:** Grape harvesting in Haryana typically commences in **late May and extends through June**, depending on the variety, planting time, and prevailing climatic conditions. Early varieties like Perlette and Beauty Seedless mature first, followed by others like Thompson Seedless and Flame Seedless.
*   **Optimal Maturity:** Grapes should be harvested only when they have reached their optimal maturity as indicated by the signs above. Unlike some fruits, grapes do not ripen further after being harvested.
*   **Time of Day:** Harvesting should ideally be done during the **cooler parts of the day**, such as early morning (after dew has dried) or late afternoon, to minimize field heat and maintain fruit quality. Avoid harvesting during the hottest part of the day.
*   **Selective Harvesting:** For varieties that do not ripen uniformly, it may be necessary to harvest bunches selectively as they reach maturity.

### Cutting Process for Grape

Proper cutting and handling are essential to prevent damage and maintain the quality and shelf life of the harvested bunches.

*   **Tools:** Use clean, sharp **secateurs or harvesting shears**. This ensures a clean cut, prevents tearing of the vine, and minimizes damage to the bunch.
*   **Technique:**
    1.  Gently hold the grape bunch by its main stem (peduncle).
    2.  Cut the main stem of the bunch, leaving a small portion (approximately **1-2 cm**) of the stem attached to the bunch. This stem acts as a handle, reduces berry shatter, and helps in post-harvest handling.
    3.  Avoid touching the berries directly with your hands as much as possible to preserve the natural bloom (waxy coating) and prevent bruising or discolouration.
    4.  Carefully place the harvested bunches into clean, shallow harvesting crates or baskets. Do not pile them high to prevent crushing and damage.
*   **Post-Harvest Handling:**
    *   Immediately move the harvested grapes to a shaded area to protect them from direct sunlight and reduce field heat.
    *   Sort the bunches to remove any damaged, diseased, or immature berries before packing.
    *   For commercial purposes, rapid cooling (pre-cooling) after harvest is highly recommended to extend shelf life.
