As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling weeds in grape cultivation in Haryana. Effective weed management in grapes requires an integrated approach combining cultural, mechanical, and chemical methods.

First, addressing specific weeds mentioned:

*   **Orobanche (Broomrape):** This parasitic weed is primarily known to affect crops like mustard, tomato, brinjal, and tobacco. It is **not known to be a significant or common problem affecting Grape** cultivation in Haryana. Therefore, specific chemical recommendations for Orobanche control in grapes are generally not required. If isolated instances are observed, immediate hand pulling before seed set is the most effective method to prevent its spread.

For other weeds including Broadleaf weeds (like Bathu, Congress grass), Narrowleaf weeds (like Phalaris minor), and Amarbail, the following strategies are recommended:

**I. Integrated Weed Management (IWM) Principles:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Intercultivation:** Regular shallow tillage or hoeing between rows helps to uproot young weeds and prevent their establishment. Avoid deep tillage near vines to prevent root damage.
    *   **Mulching:** Applying organic mulches (e.g., straw, sugarcane trash) or plastic mulches around the base of vines can suppress weed growth by blocking sunlight and conserving soil moisture.
    *   **Hand Weeding:** Essential for removing weeds growing close to the vine trunk where mechanical or chemical methods might cause damage. This is particularly important for parasitic weeds like Amarbail.
    *   **Cover Cropping:** In wider inter-rows, suitable non-competitive cover crops can be grown to suppress weeds, improve soil health, and reduce erosion. These need to be managed carefully to avoid competition with grapevines.

2.  **Chemical Control (Herbicides):**
    Herbicides should be used judiciously, as directed sprays, avoiding contact with grape foliage, green stems, or fruit. Always read and follow the label instructions for safe and effective application.

    **A. Pre-emergence Herbicides (Applied to soil before weed emergence):**
    These are typically applied after pruning and before bud break, or after initial weeding, to a moist soil surface.

    *   **Pendimethalin:** For control of annual grasses and some broadleaf weeds.
        *   **Dosage:** 3.3 Litres of Pendimethalin 30% EC per acre in 200-300 Litres of water.
        *   **Application:** Apply to moist soil as a uniform spray before weed emergence.

    *   **Oxyfluorfen:** For control of annual broadleaf weeds and some grasses.
        *   **Dosage:** 1.0 Litre of Oxyfluorfen 23.5% EC per acre in 200-300 Litres of water.
        *   **Application:** Apply to moist soil as a uniform spray before weed emergence.

    *   **Diuron:** For control of annual broadleaf weeds and grasses.
        *   **Dosage:** 1.0 - 2.0 kg of Diuron 80% WP per acre in 200-300 Litres of water.
        *   **Application:** Apply to moist soil as a uniform spray before weed emergence.

    **B. Post-emergence Herbicides (Applied to actively growing weeds):**
    These are applied as directed sprays, ensuring the spray does not drift onto the grapevines. Apply when weeds are young and actively growing for best results.

    *   **For Broadleaf, Narrowleaf (Grasses including Phalaris minor), and general weed control:**
        *   **Glyphosate:** Non-selective, systemic herbicide.
            *   **Dosage:** 2.5 - 3.75 Litres of Glyphosate 41% SL per acre in 200-300 Litres of water.
            *   **Application:** Use as a directed spray to weeds, avoiding contact with grapevines. Use a hood or shield to prevent drift.

        *   **Paraquat dichloride:** Non-selective, contact herbicide.
            *   **Dosage:** 2.0 - 4.0 Litres of Paraquat dichloride 24% SL per acre in 200-300 Litres of water.
            *   **Application:** Use as a directed spray to weeds, avoiding contact with grapevines. Effective for quick knockdown of emerged weeds. Can be used for spot treatment of Amarbail patches, ensuring minimal contact with grapevines.

    *   **For Narrowleaf Weeds (Grasses including Phalaris minor) only:**
        *   **Quizalofop-ethyl:** Selective, systemic herbicide for grasses.
            *   **Dosage:** 1.0 - 2.0 Litres of Quizalofop-ethyl 5% EC per acre in 200-300 Litres of water.
            *   **Application:** Apply as a directed spray to actively growing grassy weeds, ensuring minimal contact with grapevines.

        *   **Fluazifop-P-butyl:** Selective, systemic herbicide for grasses.
            *   **Dosage:** 0.5 - 1.0 Litre of Fluazifop-P-butyl 25% EC per acre in 200-300 Litres of water.
            *   **Application:** Apply as a directed spray to actively growing grassy weeds, ensuring minimal contact with grapevines.

**II. Specific Control for Amarbail (Cuscuta spp.):**

*   **Hand Removal:** This is the most effective method. Immediately remove and destroy any Amarbail strands as soon as they are detected, before they flower and set seeds. If necessary, prune and destroy the affected parts of the grapevine.
*   **Spot Treatment:** For localized infestations, a directed spot spray of **Paraquat dichloride** can be used, taking extreme care to avoid contact with the grapevines.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Timing:** Apply pre-emergence herbicides to moist soil. Apply post-emergence herbicides when weeds are young and actively growing.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) while handling and applying herbicides.
*   **Drift Management:** Use low-pressure sprayers, appropriate nozzles, and spray shields to minimize herbicide drift onto grapevines.
*   **Water Quality:** Use clean water for herbicide mixing.
*   **Rotation of Herbicides:** To prevent the development of herbicide resistance, rotate different classes of herbicides.
*   **Consultation:** For specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions, it is always advisable to consult with local agricultural extension specialists.
