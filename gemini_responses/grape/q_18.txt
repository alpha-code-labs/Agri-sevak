As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified doses for Growth Regulators/Hormones in Grape cultivation in Haryana:

**1. Ethephon (for ripening and color development):**
*   **Purpose:** To promote uniform ripening and enhance color development in grape berries.
*   **Dose:** Apply **Ethephon** at a concentration of 250-500 mg/L (0.25-0.5 g/L) as a foliar spray.
*   **Timing:** Apply at the onset of veraison (when berries begin to change color). The exact dose may vary depending on the grape variety and desired intensity of color.

**2. 2,4-D (for berry enlargement and fruit set):**
*   **Purpose:** To increase berry size and improve fruit set.
*   **Dose:** Apply **2,4-D** (as sodium salt or amine salt) at an extremely low concentration of 2-5 mg/L (0.002-0.005 g/L) as a foliar spray.
*   **Timing:** Apply approximately 7-10 days after berry set.
*   **Caution:** **2,4-D** is a potent herbicide. Its use as a growth regulator in grapes requires extreme precision and caution to avoid phytotoxicity and off-target damage. Ensure accurate measurement and uniform application.

**3. Boron (for improved fruit set and preventing deficiencies):**
*   **Purpose:** Boron is an essential micronutrient crucial for pollen germination, fruit set, and preventing disorders like 'coulure' (flower/berry drop) and 'millerandage' (uneven berry size).
*   **Dose:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Apply **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate) at a concentration of 1-2 g/L (0.1-0.2% solution) as a foliar spray.
    *   **Timing for Foliar:** Apply at pre-bloom and again at full bloom for optimal fruit set.
    *   **Soil Application (if deficiency is severe and confirmed by soil test):** Apply **Borax** at 10-15 kg/acre, broadcast and incorporated into the soil before flowering. Foliar application is generally more effective for immediate impact on fruit set.
