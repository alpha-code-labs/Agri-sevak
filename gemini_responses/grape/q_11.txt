As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies in Grape cultivation in Haryana.

It is crucial to correctly identify the specific pest species to ensure effective and targeted control. Always follow the recommended dosage and pre-harvest interval (PHI) for any pesticide application.

### Control of Beetles in Grape

Various beetle species can affect grapes, including flea beetles and certain chafer beetles, which feed on leaves, shoots, or berries.

**Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   Regular monitoring of the vineyard for early signs of beetle infestation.
*   Hand-picking of adult beetles in small vineyards, especially during early morning or late evening when they are less active.
*   Maintaining vineyard hygiene by removing weeds and debris that can harbor pests.

**Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved):**
For significant infestations, the following CIBRC approved insecticides can be used:

*   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** Apply at 0.5 - 1.0 ml per liter of water (or 200 - 400 ml per acre, depending on spray volume).
*   **Cypermethrin 25% EC:** Apply at 0.5 - 1.0 ml per liter of water (or 200 - 400 ml per acre, depending on spray volume).
*   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Effective against flea beetles. Apply at 0.25 - 0.5 ml per liter of water (or 100 - 200 ml per acre, depending on spray volume).
*   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Effective against flea beetles. Apply at 0.2 - 0.4 g per liter of water (or 80 - 160 g per acre, depending on spray volume).
*   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply at 0.2 - 0.4 g per liter of water (or 80 - 160 g per acre, depending on spray volume).

### Control of Weevils in Grape

Weevils, such as root weevils or grape berry weevils, can cause damage by feeding on roots, leaves, or developing berries.

**Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   Regular inspection of vines, especially around the base, for signs of root weevil activity.
*   Removal of leaf litter and debris around the base of vines to reduce overwintering sites for adult weevils.
*   Trapping adult weevils using sticky barriers around the trunk or by shaking them off vines onto a sheet in the early morning.

**Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved):**
For effective control of weevils, especially adult feeding, the following insecticides can be used:

*   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** Apply at 0.5 - 1.0 ml per liter of water (or 200 - 400 ml per acre, depending on spray volume).
*   **Cypermethrin 25% EC:** Apply at 0.5 - 1.0 ml per liter of water (or 200 - 400 ml per acre, depending on spray volume).
*   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Can be effective against adult weevils feeding on foliage. Apply at 0.25 - 0.5 ml per liter of water (or 100 - 200 ml per acre, depending on spray volume).
*   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at 0.2 - 0.4 g per liter of water (or 80 - 160 g per acre, depending on spray volume).

### Control of Sawflies in Grape

This is not known to affect Grape. Sawflies are generally not considered a significant pest of grapes in Haryana or other grape-growing regions.

### General Recommendations and Precautions:

*   **Integrated Pest Management (IPM):** Always prioritize IPM strategies, combining cultural, mechanical, biological, and chemical methods for sustainable pest control.
*   **Monitoring:** Regular scouting of the vineyard is essential to detect pest infestations early and apply treatments only when necessary.
*   **Timing of Application:** Apply insecticides during the cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Strictly adhere to the PHI mentioned on the pesticide label to ensure the safety of the produce for consumption.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of pesticides.
*   **Consult Experts:** For specific or severe infestations, consult with local agricultural extension officers or HAU experts for precise recommendations.
