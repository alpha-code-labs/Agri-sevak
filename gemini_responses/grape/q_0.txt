Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing fungal diseases in grapes in Haryana.

Here's how to control the specified fungal diseases:

**General Cultural Practices for Fungal Disease Management in Grapes:**
Implementing good cultural practices is crucial for reducing disease incidence and enhancing the efficacy of chemical treatments.
*   **Pruning:** Ensure proper pruning to maintain an open canopy, which improves air circulation and light penetration, reducing humidity around the vines.
*   **Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy infected leaves, shoots, and fruit to reduce inoculum sources.
*   **Weed Management:** Keep the vineyard free of weeds, as they can harbor pathogens and impede air circulation.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush, susceptible growth.
*   **Irrigation:** Use drip irrigation where possible. If overhead irrigation is used, do it in the morning to allow foliage to dry quickly.

**Specific Disease Management:**

1.  **Alternaria (Alternaria Leaf Spot/Blight)**
    This disease can cause dark, circular spots on leaves, often with concentric rings.
    *   **Chemical Control (Preventive/Early Stage):**
        *   **Mancozeb** @ 2.5 g/L of water
        *   **Azoxystrobin** @ 0.5 ml/L of water
        *   **Pyraclostrobin** @ 0.5 ml/L of water
        *   **Difenoconazole** @ 0.5 ml/L of water

2.  **Anthracnose (Bird's Eye Rot)**
    Characterized by circular, sunken lesions with dark margins and a light-colored center on berries, shoots, and leaves.
    *   **Chemical Control (Preventive/Early Stage):**
        *   **Mancozeb** @ 2.5 g/L of water
        *   **Carbendazim** @ 1.0 g/L of water
        *   **Thiophanate Methyl** @ 1.0 g/L of water
        *   **Azoxystrobin** @ 0.5 ml/L of water

3.  **Blast**
    This is not known to affect Grape as a specific disease.

4.  **Blight**
    While various diseases can cause blight-like symptoms, 'Blight' as a standalone specific disease name is not commonly used for grapes in the context of primary fungal pathogens beyond those already listed (e.g., Downy Mildew can cause blighting).

5.  **Brown spot**
    This is not known to affect Grape as a specific disease.

6.  **Downy Mildew**
    A major disease, causing yellowish-green spots on the upper leaf surface and white, downy fungal growth on the corresponding lower surface. Can lead to defoliation and fruit rot.
    *   **Chemical Control (Preventive/Curative):**
        *   **Mancozeb** @ 2.5 g/L of water (Preventive)
        *   **Copper Oxychloride** @ 3.0 g/L of water (Preventive)
        *   **Metalaxyl + Mancozeb** @ 2.5 g/L of water
        *   **Cymoxanil + Mancozeb** @ 2.5 g/L of water
        *   **Azoxystrobin** @ 0.5 ml/L of water
        *   **Fenamidone** @ 0.5 ml/L of water
        *   **Iprovalicarb + Propineb** @ 2.5 g/L of water

7.  **Powdery Mildew**
    Another major disease, appearing as white, powdery patches on leaves, shoots, and berries. Can cause fruit cracking and reduced quality.
    *   **Chemical Control (Preventive/Curative):**
        *   **Sulphur (Wettable Sulphur)** @ 2.0-3.0 g/L of water (Preventive, avoid spraying in very hot weather)
        *   **Myclobutanil** @ 0.4 ml/L of water
        *   **Penconazole** @ 0.5 ml/L of water
        *   **Hexaconazole** @ 0.5 ml/L of water
        *   **Azoxystrobin** @ 0.5 ml/L of water
        *   **Tebuconazole** @ 0.75 ml/L of water
        *   **Difenoconazole** @ 0.5 ml/L of water

8.  **Grey Mildew (Grey Mould / Botrytis Bunch Rot)**
    Causes a grey, fuzzy mould on ripening berries, often starting from wounds or cracks. Can also affect flowers and shoots.
    *   **Chemical Control (Preventive, especially during flowering and fruit set, and pre-harvest):**
        *   **Carbendazim** @ 1.0 g/L of water
        *   **Thiophanate Methyl** @ 1.0 g/L of water
        *   **Pyraclostrobin** @ 0.5 ml/L of water
        *   **Azoxystrobin** @ 0.5 ml/L of water
        *   **Fenhexamid** @ 1.0 g/L of water

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Rotation of Chemicals:** Always rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in pathogens.
*   **Timing:** The effectiveness of fungicides largely depends on timely application. Apply preventively or at the very first signs of disease.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough spray coverage of all plant parts, especially the undersides of leaves.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always observe the specified Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) for each chemical to ensure the safety of the produce.
*   **Consult Local Experts:** For specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions, always consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts.
