Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I understand the critical importance of balanced nutrition for optimal grape production in Haryana. Addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium) is crucial for vine health, yield, and fruit quality.

**Crucial First Step:**
Before applying any fertilizers, it is **imperative to conduct a comprehensive soil test** of your vineyard. This will accurately determine the existing nutrient levels and pH, allowing for precise and efficient fertilizer recommendations. Leaf tissue analysis can also provide valuable insights into the plant's current nutritional status.

Here's how to address deficiencies in Grape:

### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

Nitrogen is vital for vegetative growth, leaf development, and photosynthesis.

*   **Symptoms:** Pale green to yellowing of older leaves (chlorosis), stunted shoot growth, reduced leaf size, and poor fruit set.
*   **Causes:** Low organic matter in soil, leaching in sandy soils, high rainfall, or excessive weed competition.
*   **Addressing Deficiency:**
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   Apply **Urea** (46% N) at 50-100 kg/acre in split doses during the active vegetative growth phase (e.g., after pruning and during early shoot growth).
        *   Alternatively, apply **Calcium Ammonium Nitrate (CAN)** (25% N) at 100-200 kg/acre in split doses during the same period.
    *   **Foliar Application (for quick correction):**
        *   Spray **Urea** solution at 5-10 g/L (0.5-1%) concentration during active growth. Repeat every 10-15 days if symptoms persist. Avoid spraying during flowering or fruit ripening.

### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

Phosphorus is essential for root development, flowering, fruit set, and energy transfer within the plant.

*   **Symptoms:** Dark green or purplish discoloration of older leaves, stunted growth, poor root development, delayed maturity, and reduced fruit quality.
*   **Causes:** Low soil P content, high soil pH (leading to P fixation), cold and wet soil conditions, or compacted soils.
*   **Addressing Deficiency:**
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   Apply **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5) at 150-250 kg/acre as a basal dose before planting or during dormancy for established vineyards.
        *   Alternatively, apply **Di-Ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5) at 75-125 kg/acre as a basal dose or before flowering.
    *   **Foliar Application (less common but can provide a quick boost):**
        *   Spray **Monoammonium Phosphate (MAP)** (12% N, 61% P2O5) at 5-10 g/L (0.5-1%) concentration, particularly during pre-bloom or early fruit set stages.

### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency

Potassium is crucial for fruit development, sugar accumulation, water regulation, and disease resistance.

*   **Symptoms:** Yellowing and scorching (necrosis) of leaf margins, especially on older leaves, poor fruit color, reduced sugar content, and overall poor fruit quality.
*   **Causes:** Sandy soils, heavy rainfall (leaching), high cropping loads, or imbalance with other cations like Calcium and Magnesium.
*   **Addressing Deficiency:**
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   Apply **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** / **Potassium Chloride** (60% K2O) at 75-150 kg/acre in split doses, particularly during fruit development and post-harvest.
        *   Alternatively, apply **Sulphate of Potash (SOP)** / **Potassium Sulphate** (50% K2O) at 100-200 kg/acre, especially beneficial in soils with high chloride sensitivity or where sulfur is also deficient.
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray **Potassium Nitrate** (13% N, 45% K2O) at 5-10 g/L (0.5-1%) concentration during fruit development and ripening stages to enhance fruit quality.
        *   Alternatively, spray **Sulphate of Potash (SOP)** at 5-10 g/L (0.5-1%) concentration.

**General Recommendations:**

*   **Balanced Fertilization:** Always aim for a balanced nutrient supply. Over-application of one nutrient can induce deficiency of another.
*   **Organic Matter:** Incorporating farmyard manure (FYM) or compost regularly improves soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability, reducing reliance on synthetic fertilizers.
*   **Irrigation:** Ensure proper irrigation practices, as water stress can exacerbate nutrient deficiencies.
*   **Timing:** The timing of fertilizer application is critical for grapevines, aligning with specific growth stages (e.g., post-pruning, pre-bloom, fruit set, veraison, post-harvest).

Remember, these are general guidelines. For precise recommendations tailored to your specific vineyard, please consult your latest soil and leaf analysis reports.
