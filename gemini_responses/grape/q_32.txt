Dear Farmer,

The symptom of "Drying up" (drying branches, leaves, fruits, and flowers) in grapevines is a general indication of stress and can be caused by a multitude of factors, both biotic (living organisms like pests and diseases) and abiotic (environmental or physiological). A precise diagnosis is crucial for effective management.

As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I advise you to carefully observe your vineyard to identify the specific underlying cause. Here are the common reasons for such symptoms in grapes and their management strategies:

### I. Abiotic Stresses (Non-living factors)

1.  **Water Stress:**
    *   **Under-watering:** Prolonged drought or insufficient irrigation can lead to wilting and drying of leaves, shoots, and eventually fruits.
    *   **Over-watering/Poor Drainage:** Waterlogging can cause root rot, which prevents the roots from absorbing water and nutrients, leading to symptoms similar to drought stress (wilting and drying).
    *   **Management:**
        *   Ensure optimal soil moisture. Use drip irrigation for efficient water delivery.
        *   Check soil drainage. Improve drainage by adding organic matter or creating raised beds if necessary.
        *   Monitor soil moisture regularly using tensiometers or by manual inspection.

2.  **Nutrient Deficiencies/Imbalances:**
    *   Deficiencies of essential nutrients like Potassium (K), Boron (B), or Calcium (Ca) can manifest as drying or necrosis of leaf margins, shoot tips, or poor fruit development leading to shriveling.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Conduct soil and leaf tissue analysis to identify specific deficiencies.
        *   Apply balanced fertilizers based on soil test recommendations.
        *   Foliar sprays of micronutrients can provide quick relief for specific deficiencies.

3.  **Environmental Stress:**
    *   **Heat Stress/Sunburn:** High temperatures combined with intense sunlight can scorch leaves and berries, causing them to dry.
    *   **Wind Burn:** Strong, dry winds can desiccate leaves and shoots.
    *   **Salinity:** High salt content in soil or irrigation water can cause leaf margin burn and overall plant stress, leading to drying.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Ensure adequate canopy cover to protect bunches from direct sun.
        *   Consider windbreaks in highly exposed areas.
        *   Use good quality irrigation water. If salinity is an issue, leach salts with good quality water or use salt-tolerant rootstocks.

4.  **Physiological Disorders:**
    *   **Bunch Stem Necrosis:** A physiological disorder where the rachis (bunch stem) dries out, leading to shriveling and drying of berries, even if the rest of the plant appears healthy.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Often linked to nutrient imbalances (e.g., low Calcium, high Magnesium, high Potassium).
        *   Foliar application of Calcium chloride (0.5%) or Magnesium sulphate (0.5%) can sometimes help.

### II. Biotic Stresses (Living organisms)

These are diseases and pests that can cause drying symptoms.

1.  **Fungal Diseases:**
    *   **Anthracnose (Bird's Eye Spot):** Causes sunken, dark lesions with purple margins on shoots, leaves, and berries, leading to drying and dieback of affected parts.
        *   **Management:** Prune and destroy infected plant parts.
        *   **Chemical Control:**
            *   **Carbendazim** 0.5-1 g/L water
            *   **Mancozeb** 2-2.5 g/L water
            *   **Propineb** 2-2.5 g/L water
            *   **Thiophanate Methyl** 1 g/L water
    *   **Powdery Mildew:** White powdery growth on leaves, shoots, and berries. Severe infection can cause leaves to curl, shrivel, and berries to crack and dry.
        *   **Management:** Ensure good air circulation.
        *   **Chemical Control:**
            *   **Sulphur (Wettable Powder)** 2-3 g/L water
            *   **Myclobutanil** 0.4-0.5 g/L water
            *   **Hexaconazole** 0.5 ml/L water
    *   **Downy Mildew:** Yellowish, oily spots on the upper surface of leaves, with white downy growth on the underside. Severe infection leads to browning and drying of leaves, and shriveling of berries.
        *   **Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation.
        *   **Chemical Control:**
            *   **Mancozeb** 2-2.5 g/L water
            *   **Propineb** 2-2.5 g/L water
            *   **Metalaxyl + Mancozeb** 2-2.5 g/L water
            *   **Fenamidone + Fosetyl-aluminium** 2-2.5 g/L water
    *   **Botrytis Bunch Rot (Gray Mold):** Affects ripening berries, causing them to rot and then shrivel and dry, often covered with a gray fuzzy mold.
        *   **Management:** Improve air circulation within the canopy, remove infected bunches.
        *   **Chemical Control:**
            *   **Carbendazim** 0.5-1 g/L water
            *   **Thiophanate Methyl** 1 g/L water
    *   **Stem Rot/Dieback (e.g., Phomopsis, Eutypa):** Fungi that infect pruning wounds or damaged wood, causing cankers and dieback of entire branches, leading to drying.
        *   **Management:** Prune during dry weather, sanitize tools, apply wound protectants.
        *   **Chemical Control:** No direct chemical cure once established. Preventative sprays with **Mancozeb** or **Carbendazim** after pruning can help.
    *   **Root Rot (e.g., Phytophthora, Fusarium):** Damages roots, impairing water and nutrient uptake, leading to wilting and drying of the entire plant.
        *   **Management:** Improve drainage, avoid over-watering.
        *   **Chemical Control:** Drenching with **Propamocarb Hydrochloride** 2-3 ml/L water or **Metalaxyl + Mancozeb** 2-2.5 g/L water can be considered for specific root rot pathogens.

2.  **Bacterial Diseases:**
    *   **Bacterial Blight (Xylophilus ampelinus):** Causes angular, water-soaked spots on leaves, cankers on shoots, and eventual dieback of shoots and branches.
        *   **Management:** Prune and destroy infected parts. Use disease-free planting material.
        *   **Chemical Control:** Copper-based fungicides like **Copper Oxychloride** 2.5-3 g/L water can offer some protection.

3.  **Insect Pests:**
    *   **Stem Borers:** Larvae bore into stems and branches, disrupting water and nutrient flow, causing wilting and drying of the affected parts.
        *   **Management:** Identify and remove infested branches. Inject insecticides into boreholes.
        *   **Chemical Control:**
            *   **Chlorpyrifos** 2.5 ml/L water (drenching or injection into boreholes)
            *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 0.5 ml/L water (foliar spray for adult beetles or young larvae)
    *   **Severe Sap-sucking Pests (Mealybugs, Scale Insects, Thrips, Mites):** Heavy infestations can severely weaken the plant, leading to stress, yellowing, and drying of leaves and shoots.
        *   **Management:** Regular monitoring, biological control.
        *   **Chemical Control:**
            *   **Imidacloprid** 0.3-0.5 ml/L water
            *   **Thiamethoxam** 0.2-0.3 g/L water
            *   **Acetamiprid** 0.2-0.4 g/L water
            *   For mites: **Sulphur (Wettable Powder)** 2-3 g/L water or specific miticides.

### III. Diagnostic Steps and General Recommendations:

1.  **Observe Carefully:** Note the pattern of drying (whole plant, specific branches, only leaves, only fruits), the color changes, presence of spots, molds, or insects.
2.  **Check Roots:** Gently excavate around the base of a symptomatic plant to inspect roots for rot, damage, or pest infestation.
3.  **Inspect Stems/Trunk:** Look for cankers, cracks, boreholes, or girdling.
4.  **Soil Analysis:** Get your soil tested for nutrient levels and pH.
5.  **Water Quality Test:** If using borewell water, get it tested for salinity.
6.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Use certified disease-free planting material.
    *   Maintain proper sanitation in the vineyard (remove fallen leaves, pruned wood).
    *   Ensure balanced nutrition and optimal irrigation.
    *   Prune correctly and at the right time, sealing large wounds.
    *   Maintain good air circulation within the canopy through proper training and pruning.

Given the complexity, I strongly recommend bringing a sample of the affected plant parts (branches, leaves, fruits) to the Department of Horticulture or Plant Pathology at HAU, Hisar, for a definitive diagnosis. This will enable us to provide the most accurate and targeted management strategy for your specific situation.
