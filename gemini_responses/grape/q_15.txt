As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Grape cultivation in Haryana:

It is crucial to adopt an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods for sustainable pest control. Always consult the latest CIBRC guidelines and local agricultural extension services for specific recommendations and pre-harvest intervals (PHI) before applying any chemical.

### Control Measures for Pests in Grape:

**1. Grasshopper:**
Grasshoppers can cause significant defoliation and damage to young shoots and berries.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Maintain field sanitation by removing weeds and debris that can serve as breeding grounds.
    *   Deep ploughing during off-season can expose grasshopper eggs to predators and harsh weather, reducing their population.
*   **Chemical Control (if infestation is severe):**
    *   **Malathion 50% EC**: Apply at 1.0 - 1.5 litres per acre in 500-750 litres of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC**: Apply at 200 - 300 ml per acre in 200-400 litres of water.

**2. Painted bug (Bagrada hilaris):**
This is not known to affect Grape. Painted bug is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops like mustard, cabbage, and radish.

**3. Red cotton bug (Dysdercus cingulatus):**
This is not known to affect Grape. Red cotton bug is primarily a pest of cotton and other malvaceous plants.

**4. Black ants:**
Black ants are often secondary pests in grapes, primarily attracted to the honeydew secreted by sap-sucking insects like mealybugs, aphids, and scale insects. They protect these pests from natural enemies, exacerbating the primary pest problem. Direct damage to grapes by ants is less common.

*   **Primary Control Strategy (Indirect):**
    The most effective way to control black ants in grapes is to manage the primary honeydew-producing pests they are associated with.
    *   **For Mealybugs/Aphids/Scale Insects:**
        *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL**: Apply at 125 ml per acre in 200-400 litres of water. This systemic insecticide will control the sap-sucking pests, thereby removing the food source for ants.
        *   **Buprofezin 25% SC**: Apply at 600 ml per acre in 200-400 litres of water, particularly effective against mealybugs and scale insects by disrupting their growth.
*   **Direct Ant Control (if ants are directly problematic or very high in number):**
    *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC**: Can be used as a drench around the base of the vine or on ant trails at 1.0 - 1.25 litres per acre in 500-600 litres of water. Avoid direct contact with fruit.
    *   **Fipronil 0.3% GR**: Apply 6.6 - 10 kg per acre as a soil application around the base of the vines to control soil-dwelling ants and deter foraging.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read the label carefully before using any pesticide and follow the instructions regarding dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Observe the specified Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) to ensure the produce is safe for consumption and meets market standards.
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.
*   Encourage natural enemies of pests by minimizing broad-spectrum pesticide use and maintaining biodiversity in and around the vineyard.
