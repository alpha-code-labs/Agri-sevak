Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the challenges posed by sucking pests in grape cultivation. Effective management requires an integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods.

Here's a scientifically verified approach to control Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips in Grapes:

**I. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies:**

1.  **Regular Monitoring:** Regularly scout your vineyard (at least twice a week) for the presence of pests, their eggs, and nymphs, especially on the undersides of leaves and tender shoots. Early detection is key to effective control.
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Pruning:** Ensure proper pruning to maintain an open canopy, which improves air circulation and reduces humidity, making the environment less favorable for pests.
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the vineyard and surrounding areas free of weeds, as many weeds act as alternate hosts for these pests.
    *   **Balanced Nutrition:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush, succulent growth that is highly attractive to sucking pests.
3.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Encourage natural enemies such as ladybird beetles, lacewings, hoverflies, and parasitic wasps. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that can harm these beneficial insects.
    *   Consider releasing commercially available biological control agents if pest pressure is high and conditions are suitable.

**II. Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved Technical Chemicals for Grapes in Haryana):**

When pest populations exceed economic threshold levels, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Apply sprays thoroughly, ensuring coverage on the undersides of leaves where these pests often reside.

Here are some CIBRC-approved technical chemicals effective against Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips in Grapes:

*   **For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips:**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at 0.5 - 1.0 ml per litre of water (or 125 - 250 ml per acre).
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at 0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water (or 100 - 200 g per acre).
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply at 0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water (or 100 - 200 g per acre).
    *   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:** Apply at 0.75 ml per litre of water (or 375 ml per acre). This is particularly effective against whiteflies and mealybugs, and also helps with aphids and thrips.

*   **For Aphids and Whiteflies (specific action):**
    *   **Flonicamid 50% WG:** Apply at 0.3 g per litre of water (or 150 g per acre).

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Rotation of Chemicals:** To prevent the development of pesticide resistance, always rotate insecticides with different modes of action (different IRAC groups). Do not use the same chemical or chemicals from the same group repeatedly.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always check the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) mentioned on the label of the chosen insecticide. This is the minimum time required between the last spray and harvesting to ensure the produce is safe for consumption.
*   **Safety Precautions:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, and protective clothing while mixing and spraying pesticides. Follow all instructions and safety guidelines provided on the product label.
*   **Spray Volume:** Ensure adequate spray volume (typically 500-1000 litres per acre for grapes, depending on canopy size) for thorough coverage.

**Regarding Psylla:**

This is not known to affect Grape.
