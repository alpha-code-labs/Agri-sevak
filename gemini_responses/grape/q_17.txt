As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend the following doses of organic manures for Grape cultivation in Haryana to enhance soil health, nutrient availability, and overall vine vigour and productivity:

*   **Farm Yard Manure (FYM):**
    *   **Dose:** 15-20 tonnes per acre annually.
    *   **Application:** For new vineyards, incorporate thoroughly into the soil during land preparation. For established vineyards, spread evenly in the inter-row spaces or around the base of the vines (keeping a small distance from the main trunk) before winter pruning or during the dormant season. Lightly incorporate into the topsoil.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   **Dose:** 3-5 tonnes per acre annually, or 3-5 kg per vine.
    *   **Application:** Can be applied in a single dose or split into two applications (e.g., after pruning and during fruit development). Apply similarly to FYM, spreading around the base of the vines or in the inter-row spaces and lightly incorporating.

*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract):**
    *   **Nature:** Sagarika is a biostimulant derived from seaweed, known to enhance nutrient uptake, promote root development, improve flowering, fruit set, and overall plant vigour.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** 2.5 - 5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Soil Drench/Drip Application:** 1-2 litres per acre.
    *   **Application Timing:** Apply at critical growth stages for best results:
        *   During the active vegetative growth phase (after pruning).
        *   Pre-flowering stage.
        *   At fruit set.
        *   During fruit development.
        *   Repeat applications at 15-20 day intervals as per crop requirement and product guidelines.
