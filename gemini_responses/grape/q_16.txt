As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend the following fertilizer doses for grapes in Haryana. Please note that these are general recommendations for bearing vines and should ideally be adjusted based on a comprehensive soil test report, vine age, variety, and expected yield.

**General Nutrient Requirements (per acre per year for bearing vines):**
*   **Nitrogen (N):** 80-120 kg
*   **Phosphorus (P2O5):** 40-60 kg
*   **Potassium (K2O):** 80-120 kg
*   **Sulphur (S):** 20-40 kg

**Recommended Fertilizer Doses:**

1.  **Urea (46% N):**
    *   **Dose:** 170-260 kg **Urea** per acre per year.
    *   **Application:** Split into 2-3 applications. The first dose (around 50%) should be applied after pruning, and the remaining doses during active vegetative growth and berry development stages.

2.  **Nano-Urea (Liquid, 4% N):**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Application:** 2-3 foliar sprays during active vegetative growth and pre-flowering stages. This is a supplementary source of nitrogen and does not replace granular urea entirely.

3.  **DAP (Di-Ammonium Phosphate - 18% N, 46% P2O5):**
    *   **Dose:** 90-130 kg **DAP** per acre per year.
    *   **Application:** Apply as a basal dose, preferably before pruning or during dormancy, by broadcasting and incorporating into the soil. This will provide a significant portion of the P2O5 and some N.

4.  **Nano-DAP (Liquid, 8% N, 16% P2O5):**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Application:** 2-3 foliar sprays during pre-flowering and fruit set stages. This is a supplementary source of N and P.

5.  **NPK (Compound Fertilizers, e.g., 19:19:19, 12:32:16, 10:26:26):**
    *   **Dose:** The dose depends on the specific NPK grade and the remaining nutrient requirements after applying single fertilizers like DAP, Urea, and Potash.
    *   **Application:** If used as a primary source, 200-300 kg **NPK (19:19:19)** per acre per year can be applied, split into multiple doses, to provide a balanced nutrient supply. Adjust other fertilizer doses accordingly. Often used in fertigation systems.

6.  **SSP (Single Super Phosphate - 16% P2O5, 12% S):**
    *   **Dose:** If DAP is not used, or for additional P and S, 250-375 kg **SSP** per acre per year.
    *   **Application:** Apply as a basal dose, preferably before pruning or during dormancy, by broadcasting and incorporating into the soil. SSP is a good source of both Phosphorus and Sulphur.

7.  **Potash (Muriate of Potash - MOP, 60% K2O):**
    *   **Dose:** 130-200 kg **Potash** (MOP) per acre per year.
    *   **Application:** Split into 2-3 applications. The first dose (around 50%) should be applied after pruning, and the remaining doses during berry development and ripening stages to enhance fruit quality and sugar content.

8.  **Sulphur (Elemental Sulphur 90%):**
    *   **Dose:** 20-45 kg **Sulphur** (elemental, 90%) per acre per year.
    *   **Application:** Apply as a basal dose, preferably before pruning or during dormancy, by broadcasting and incorporating into the soil. If SSP is used, the additional Sulphur requirement might be lower.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Soil Testing:** Always conduct a soil test every 2-3 years to determine the exact nutrient status of your soil and tailor fertilizer recommendations precisely. This will prevent over- or under-application of nutrients.
*   **Timing:** The timing of fertilizer application is crucial for optimal nutrient uptake and vine performance. Generally, P and S are applied basally, while N and K are split into multiple doses throughout the growing season.
*   **Method of Application:** Fertilizers can be broadcast and incorporated, applied in bands, or through fertigation (drip irrigation).
*   **Organic Manures:** Supplementing chemical fertilizers with well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost (20-30 tonnes per acre every 2-3 years) significantly improves soil health, nutrient availability, and water retention.
