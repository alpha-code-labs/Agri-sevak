Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the critical role of balanced nutrition for optimal grape production in Haryana. Micronutrient deficiencies can significantly impact yield and quality.

Before applying any micronutrient, it is highly recommended to conduct a soil test and leaf tissue analysis to accurately diagnose the specific deficiency and its severity. This will help in precise application and avoid unnecessary treatments.

Here's how to address the common micronutrient deficiencies in Grape:

### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Small, narrow leaves (little leaf), short internodes, chlorosis (yellowing) between veins, often starting on younger leaves.

**Correction:**
*   **Foliar Application:**
    *   Spray with **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** at 2-3 g/L of water. Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, starting from new flush.
*   **Soil Application (for severe deficiency, based on soil test):**
    *   Apply **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** at 10-25 kg/acre, broadcast and incorporate into the soil before planting or during dormant season for established vineyards.

### 2. Iron (Fe) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Pronounced interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on young leaves, with veins remaining distinctly green. In severe cases, leaves may turn completely yellow or white.

**Correction:**
*   **Foliar Application (most effective for quick correction, especially in high pH soils common in Haryana):**
    *   Spray with **Ferrous sulphate** at 2-5 g/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, use **Iron EDTA** at 1-2 g/L of water.
    *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 7-10 day intervals until symptoms disappear.
*   **Soil Application (for persistent issues, based on soil test):**
    *   Apply **Ferrous sulphate** at 25-50 kg/acre or **Iron EDTA** at 5-10 kg/acre. Incorporate into the root zone.

### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Poor fruit set, development of "shot berries" (small, seedless berries), cracking of berries, dieback of shoot tips, and brittle leaves.

**Correction:**
*   **Foliar Application:**
    *   Spray with **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (Borax) at 1-1.5 g/L of water or **Boric acid** at 1-1.5 g/L of water.
    *   Apply before flowering and again after fruit set.
*   **Soil Application (for severe deficiency, based on soil test):**
    *   Apply **Borax** at 5-10 kg/acre or **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** at 2-4 kg/acre. Apply uniformly and incorporate.

### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Poor root growth, shoot tip dieback, marginal necrosis (browning) of young leaves, poor fruit quality, and increased susceptibility to fruit disorders.

**Correction:**
*   **Foliar Application (for quick uptake, especially during fruit development):**
    *   Spray with **Calcium nitrate** at 5-10 g/L of water.
    *   Apply multiple sprays during fruit development, starting from berry set.
*   **Soil Application (for long-term correction and soil amendment):**
    *   Apply **Gypsum** (Calcium sulphate dihydrate) at 200-400 kg/acre, especially beneficial in sodic soils.
    *   Alternatively, apply **Calcium nitrate** at 25-50 kg/acre.

### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, starting from the margins and progressing inwards, often accompanied by reddish-purple discoloration in severe cases.

**Correction:**
*   **Foliar Application (most effective for quick relief):**
    *   Spray with **Magnesium sulphate** (Epsom salt) at 5-10 g/L of water.
    *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, targeting affected foliage.
*   **Soil Application (for persistent issues, based on soil test):**
    *   Apply **Magnesium sulphate** at 25-50 kg/acre.

### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, similar to iron deficiency but often with a finer, net-like pattern of green veins, sometimes accompanied by small brown spots.

**Correction:**
*   **Foliar Application (preferred method):**
    *   Spray with **Manganese sulphate** at 2-4 g/L of water.
    *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, targeting new growth.
*   **Soil Application (for severe deficiency, based on soil test):**
    *   Apply **Manganese sulphate** at 10-20 kg/acre.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Timing:** Foliar sprays are best applied during the cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to prevent leaf scorching and maximize absorption.
*   **Water Quality:** Ensure good quality water for spraying.
*   **Adjuvants:** Consider using a non-ionic spreader/sticker with foliar sprays to improve coverage and absorption.
*   **Integrated Approach:** Micronutrient management should be part of an overall balanced nutrient management program, including macro-nutrients and organic matter application.
