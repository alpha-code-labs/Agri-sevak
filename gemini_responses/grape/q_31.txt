Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concerns regarding physical damage in grapes. These issues can significantly impact yield and quality. Here's scientifically verified advice to manage fruit bursting, leaf burning/melting, and hardness in fruit:

### 1. Fruit Bursting (Cracking)

**Causes:** Fruit bursting is primarily caused by sudden fluctuations in water availability (e.g., a dry spell followed by heavy rain or irrigation), high humidity, rapid fruit growth, and deficiencies of certain nutrients like calcium and boron, which are crucial for cell wall integrity. Varietal susceptibility also plays a significant role.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Water Management:**
    *   Maintain consistent soil moisture through regular and uniform irrigation. Drip irrigation is highly recommended to avoid sudden fluctuations in water supply.
    *   Avoid severe water stress followed by heavy irrigation, especially during the berry development and ripening stages.
*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Calcium:** Foliar application of **Calcium nitrate** at 0.5-1.0% concentration (5-10 g/L water) during berry development stages can strengthen cell walls and reduce cracking. Repeat 2-3 times at 10-15 day intervals.
    *   **Boron:** Ensure adequate boron supply. If deficiency is suspected, apply **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (e.g., Solubor) at 1.0-1.5 g/L water as a foliar spray before flowering and during fruit set.
*   **Canopy Management:** Proper pruning and training to ensure good air circulation around the bunches and moderate sunlight exposure can help regulate humidity and temperature.
*   **Mulching:** Apply organic mulch around the base of vines to conserve soil moisture, reduce temperature fluctuations, and maintain consistent soil moisture.

### 2. Leaf Burning/Melting (Sunburn/Heat Stress)

**Causes:** Leaf burning or scorching is typically a result of high ambient temperatures, intense solar radiation, low humidity, and water stress. "Melting" refers to severe tissue damage under extreme heat and water stress conditions.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Canopy Management:**
    *   Maintain a balanced canopy with sufficient leaf area to provide natural shade to the developing fruit and lower leaves. Avoid excessive defoliation, especially during hot periods.
    *   Utilize appropriate trellising systems that allow for good leaf coverage over the fruit zone.
*   **Water Management:**
    *   Ensure adequate and consistent irrigation to prevent water stress, which exacerbates heat damage. Increase irrigation frequency during peak summer months.
*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Ensure balanced nutrition, particularly adequate **Potassium**, which helps in maintaining turgor pressure and improving plant tolerance to heat stress.
*   **Protective Sprays:**
    *   Apply **Kaolin clay** (e.g., Surround WP) at 2.5-5.0% concentration (25-50 g/L water) as a foliar spray. It forms a white reflective film that reduces leaf temperature and reflects solar radiation. Reapply after heavy rains or every 10-14 days during peak heat periods.
    *   Foliar application of **Potassium nitrate** at 1.0-1.5% (10-15 g/L water) can help improve plant tolerance to heat stress.

### 3. Hardness in Fruit (Poor Softening/Ripening)

**Causes:** Hardness in fruit, indicating poor softening and ripening, is often linked to inadequate water supply during the ripening phase, nutrient imbalances (especially potassium deficiency), excessive crop load, and sometimes very high temperatures inhibiting ripening enzymes.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Water Management:**
    *   Provide consistent and adequate irrigation during the veraison (color change) to ripening period to facilitate proper fruit development and softening. Avoid water stress during this critical phase.
*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Potassium:** Ensure sufficient **Potassium** supply, as it is crucial for sugar accumulation and fruit softening. Apply **Potassium nitrate** at 1.0-1.5% (10-15 g/L water) as a foliar spray starting from veraison, repeated 2-3 times at 7-10 day intervals. Soil application of **Sulphate of Potash** (SOP) can also be done based on soil test recommendations.
    *   Maintain a balanced nutrient profile, as imbalances can affect ripening processes.
*   **Crop Load Management:**
    *   Thinning of bunches and berries to achieve an optimal leaf-to-fruit ratio is essential. Over-cropping can lead to delayed and uneven ripening, resulting in smaller, harder fruit with lower sugar content.
*   **Plant Growth Regulators:**
    *   For promoting uniform ripening and softening, apply **Ethephon** at 250-500 mg/L (0.25-0.5 ml/L of 40% SL formulation) as a foliar spray at the onset of veraison (when 5-10% of berries show color change). Always follow the label instructions carefully regarding concentration, timing, and pre-harvest interval.

Always remember to conduct a soil test to understand your field's specific nutrient status and consult with local agricultural experts for tailored advice.
