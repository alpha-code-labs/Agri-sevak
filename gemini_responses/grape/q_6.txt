As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling viral diseases in Grapes in Haryana.

Firstly, regarding your list:
*   **Tristeza:** This is not known to affect Grape. Citrus Tristeza Virus (CTV) is specific to citrus species and does not infect grapevines.

For the other viral diseases you mentioned (Leaf curl, Mosaic, Yellow vein clearing, Stripe, and Stunt virus), it is crucial to understand that once a grapevine is infected with a virus, there is no chemical cure. Control strategies primarily focus on prevention, management of vectors, and removal of infected plants.

Here are the key strategies for managing viral diseases in grapes:

1.  **Use Virus-Free Planting Material:**
    *   Always source planting material (cuttings, rootstocks, grafted plants) from certified nurseries that guarantee virus-free stock. This is the most critical step in preventing viral diseases.

2.  **Vector Control:**
    *   Many grapevine viruses are transmitted by insect vectors (e.g., mealybugs, scale insects) or nematodes. Effective control of these vectors is essential.

    *   **For Mealybugs (vectors for Grapevine Leafroll Disease and others):**
        *   **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect vines, especially under bark, in cracks, and on bunches, for mealybug presence.
        *   **Chemical Control:** Apply systemic insecticides during periods of active mealybug infestation, particularly post-harvest or during dormant pruning, and again during early shoot growth if populations are high.
            *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: 0.5-1.0 ml/L water.
            *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: 0.2-0.4 g/L water.
            *   **Buprofezin** 25% SC: 1.25 ml/L water.
            *   **Spirotetramat** 150 OD: 0.75 ml/L water.
        *   **Biological Control:** Encourage natural enemies like parasitic wasps and predatory beetles. Neem-based formulations can also be used.

    *   **For Nematodes (vectors for Grapevine Fanleaf Virus):**
        *   **Soil Testing:** Conduct soil tests to identify nematode populations before planting or in existing vineyards.
        *   **Pre-plant Treatment:** If nematodes are a known problem, consider soil fumigation or nematicide application before planting.
        *   **Chemical Control (in established vineyards):**
            *   **Fluopyram** 34.48% SC: 1.25-1.5 L/acre (as a soil drench or drip application).
            *   **Ethoprophos** 10% G: 10-15 kg/acre (soil incorporation before planting or as a side-dress).

3.  **Sanitation and Rogueing:**
    *   **Remove Infected Plants:** Carefully identify and remove (rogue) any symptomatic vines as soon as they are detected. This prevents the spread of the virus to healthy plants.
    *   **Pruning Tools:** Disinfect pruning tools with a 10% bleach solution or rubbing alcohol between vines, especially when working in vineyards with known viral issues, to prevent mechanical transmission.

4.  **Weed Management:**
    *   Control weeds in and around the vineyard, as some weeds can act as alternative hosts for viruses or their vectors.

5.  **Integrated Pest Management (IPM):**
    *   Combine all available control methods (cultural, biological, and chemical) in a sustainable manner to minimize pest and disease pressure.

By strictly adhering to these preventive and management strategies, you can significantly reduce the incidence and spread of viral diseases in your grape vineyard. Regular monitoring and timely action are key to successful viral disease management.
