Mites, including Red spider mite (*Tetranychus urticae*) and Rust mite (*Calepitrimerus vitis*), are significant pests of grapevines in Haryana. Effective control requires an integrated approach.

**1. Monitoring and Identification:**
*   **Red Spider Mite:** Look for fine webbing on the underside of leaves, stippling (tiny yellow or white spots) on the upper leaf surface, and bronzing of leaves in severe infestations. Mites are visible to the naked eye as tiny reddish-brown specks.
*   **Rust Mite:** These are microscopic and not visible without magnification. Symptoms include bronzing or russeting of leaves, especially along the veins, and sometimes on young berries, leading to reduced fruit quality and yield.

**2. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Approach:**
An IPM strategy combines cultural, biological, and chemical methods for sustainable mite management.

**3. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Weed Management:** Control weeds in and around the vineyard, as many weeds can host mites.
*   **Dust Control:** Reduce dust in the vineyard, as dusty conditions favor mite outbreaks. This can be achieved through proper irrigation and avoiding excessive soil disturbance.
*   **Pruning:** Ensure proper pruning to improve air circulation and light penetration within the canopy, which can make the environment less favorable for mites.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush, succulent growth that is more attractive to mites.

**4. Biological Control:**
*   Conserve natural enemies such as predatory mites (*Amblyseius* species) and lacewings, which feed on pest mites. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

**5. Chemical Control (Acaricides):**
When mite populations reach damaging levels, chemical intervention with CIBRC-approved acaricides is necessary. Rotate chemicals with different modes of action to prevent resistance development. Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the underside of leaves.

Here are some CIBRC-approved technical chemical names and their recommended dosages for grapes:

*   **Spiromesifen** (e.g., 22.9% SC formulation): 0.5 ml per liter of water.
*   **Fenpyroximate** (e.g., 5% SC formulation): 0.5 ml per liter of water.
*   **Propargite** (e.g., 57% EC formulation): 1.5 - 2.0 ml per liter of water.
*   **Abamectin** (e.g., 1.9% EC formulation): 0.3 - 0.5 ml per liter of water.
*   **Wettable Sulphur** (e.g., 80% WP formulation): 2.0 - 3.0 g per liter of water. (Highly effective against rust mites and also helps control powdery mildew).

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Spray Timing:** Apply acaricides when mite populations are building up, before they cause significant damage. Early season application of Wettable Sulphur can be very effective against rust mites.
*   **Resistance Management:** Always rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent mites from developing resistance. Do not use the same chemical repeatedly.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always observe the specified Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) for each chemical to ensure the safety of the harvested fruit.
*   **Safety:** Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying. Follow all label instructions carefully.
*   **Water Volume:** Ensure adequate water volume (e.g., 500-1000 liters per acre depending on canopy size) for thorough coverage of the foliage.
