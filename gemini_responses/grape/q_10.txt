Namaste Kisan bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU), Hisar, I am providing you with scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in your grape vineyards in Haryana.

### Control of Borers in Grape

Borers, particularly stem borers, can cause significant damage by tunneling into the woody parts of the vine.

*   **Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
    *   Regularly inspect vines for signs of borer attack (e.g., sawdust-like frass, wilting branches, holes).
    *   Prune and destroy affected branches or shoots to remove larvae.
    *   For individual borer holes, you can inject a small amount of insecticide solution or use a wire to physically kill the larva.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   For stem borers, after pruning affected parts, you can apply a drench or swab the affected trunk/branches with:
        *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** at 2.5 ml per liter of water.
    *   For shoot borers or early infestations of lepidopteran borers, foliar sprays can be effective:
        *   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG** at 0.2-0.4 grams per liter of water.
        *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC** at 0.15-0.2 ml per liter of water.

### Control of Caterpillars and Leaf folders in Grape

Various caterpillar species and leaf folders can damage grape leaves and sometimes berries. Their control strategies are often similar.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Regular monitoring of the vineyard to detect early infestations.
    *   Remove and destroy folded leaves or leaves with caterpillar feeding damage.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   For effective control of caterpillars and leaf folders, consider the following CIBRC approved insecticides:
        *   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG** at 0.2-0.4 grams per liter of water.
        *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC** at 0.15-0.2 ml per liter of water.
        *   **Flubendiamide 20% WG** at 0.2-0.3 grams per liter of water.
        *   **Indoxacarb 14.5% SC** at 0.5 ml per liter of water.
        *   For early instar larvae, especially in organic farming or as part of IPM:
            *   **Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) formulations** as per manufacturer's recommendations (typically 1-2 kg per acre or 2-4 grams per liter of water).

### Diamondback Moth

*   This is not known to affect Grape. Diamondback moth (*Plutella xylostella*) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops like cabbage, cauliflower, and mustard.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully, including dosage, application method, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.
*   Apply insecticides during cooler parts of the day, preferably in the morning or evening.
*   Ensure thorough spray coverage for optimal results.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions.
