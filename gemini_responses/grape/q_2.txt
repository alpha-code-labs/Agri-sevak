As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding rust diseases in Grape:

*   **Black Rust:** This is not known to affect Grape.
*   **Brown Rust:** This is not known to affect Grape.
*   **Yellow Rust:** This is not known to affect Grape.
*   **White Rust:** This is not known to affect Grape.
*   **Red Rust:** This is not known to affect Grape.

The specific rust diseases you have listed (Black, Brown, Yellow, White, and Red rust) are primarily known to affect other crops, such as cereals (e.g., wheat for Black, Brown, and Yellow rust) or cruciferous vegetables (for White rust). True rust diseases (caused by fungi in the order Pucciniales) are generally not a significant or common problem for grape cultivation in Haryana or most parts of India. Therefore, specific control measures for these particular rusts are not required for grapes.
