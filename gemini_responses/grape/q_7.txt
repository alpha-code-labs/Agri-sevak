Dear Farmer,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I am providing scientifically verified advice for the control of Dieback and Twig Blight in Grapes, and clarifying the status of Tikka disease.

### Control of Dieback and Twig Blight in Grape

Dieback and Twig Blight in grapes are often caused by a complex of fungal pathogens, including *Phomopsis viticola*, *Botryosphaeria* species, and *Eutypa lata*. These diseases can lead to significant yield losses if not managed effectively.

**Symptoms:**
*   **Dieback:** Characterized by the progressive death of shoots, canes, or entire arms, often starting from the tip and moving downwards. Cankers may form on older wood.
*   **Twig Blight:** Involves the rapid browning and death of young shoots, tendrils, and leaves, often appearing after periods of wet weather. Lesions may be visible on canes.

**Integrated Management Strategies:**

**A. Cultural Practices (Essential for long-term control):**

1.  **Pruning:**
    *   Remove all infected wood well below the visible canker or lesion. Make clean cuts into healthy wood.
    *   Prune during dry periods to minimize the spread of spores and infection through fresh wounds.
    *   Avoid pruning during wet weather or when rain is expected.
2.  **Sanitation:**
    *   Collect and destroy all pruned material, including diseased canes, leaves, and mummified berries, to reduce inoculum sources. Do not leave infected debris in the vineyard.
3.  **Vineyard Hygiene:**
    *   Ensure good air circulation within the canopy by proper training and pruning techniques to reduce humidity, which favors fungal growth.
4.  **Wound Protection:**
    *   Immediately after pruning, especially for larger cuts, apply a protective fungicide paste or spray to the wounds.

**B. Chemical Control (As per CIBRC approved technical chemicals):**

Chemical applications are crucial, especially during susceptible stages and after pruning.

1.  **Dormant Season / Early Bud Break (Preventive):**
    *   Apply a broad-spectrum contact fungicide to reduce overwintering inoculum.
        *   **Mancozeb** @ 2.5 kg per acre (or 2.5-3 g per litre of water for spray).
        *   **Copper oxychloride** @ 2.5 kg per acre (or 2.5-3 g per litre of water for spray).
2.  **Growing Season (Foliar Sprays for Twig Blight and Phomopsis):**
    *   Start applications from early shoot growth and continue at regular intervals (e.g., 10-14 days) during periods conducive to disease development (warm, wet weather).
        *   **Mancozeb** @ 2.5 kg per acre (or 2.5-3 g per litre of water).
        *   **Captan** @ 2 kg per acre (or 2 g per litre of water).
        *   **Thiophanate-methyl** @ 500 g per acre (or 1 g per litre of water).
3.  **Post-Pruning Wound Protection (for Dieback pathogens like Eutypa, Botryosphaeria):**
    *   Immediately after pruning, especially for larger cuts, apply a fungicide directly to the wounds.
        *   **Thiophanate-methyl** @ 1 g per litre of water, mixed with a suitable wound sealant or paint.
        *   **Carbendazim** @ 0.5-1 g per litre of water, mixed with a suitable wound sealant or paint.
        *   **Bordeaux mixture** (1%) can also be painted onto large pruning wounds.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the label instructions for any chemical product.
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
*   Ensure thorough spray coverage for effective control.

### Tikka Disease in Grape

This is not known to affect Grape. Tikka disease is a common and significant fungal disease primarily affecting groundnut (*Arachis hypogaea*).
