Smut diseases (Black, False, Kernel, and Loose smut) are primarily diseases of cereal crops (like wheat, rice, maize, barley, sorghum) and some grasses, caused by specific fungi belonging to the order Ustilaginales. Peach (Prunus persica) is a fruit tree and is not susceptible to these particular smut diseases.
