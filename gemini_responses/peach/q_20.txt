Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the critical role micronutrients play in the healthy growth, yield, and quality of peach (Prunus persica) crops. Deficiencies can significantly impact productivity.

The first and most crucial step in addressing any nutrient deficiency is a **comprehensive soil test** and, if possible, a **leaf tissue analysis**. This scientific approach helps accurately diagnose the specific deficiency and determine the precise amount of nutrient required, preventing both under-application and over-application (which can lead to toxicity or nutrient imbalances).

Here's how to address the common micronutrient deficiencies in peach, based on scientifically verified methods and CIBRC approved chemicals:

---

### General Recommendations for Micronutrient Application:

*   **Soil Application:** Best done before planting or during dormant periods, incorporated into the soil. Ensure adequate moisture for nutrient uptake.
*   **Foliar Application:** Ideal for quick correction of deficiencies, especially during active growth stages. Apply during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to prevent leaf burn and improve absorption. Ensure thorough coverage of foliage. A non-ionic wetting agent can improve efficacy.
*   **Repeat Applications:** Depending on the severity of the deficiency and soil conditions, multiple foliar applications at 10-15 day intervals might be necessary.

### Specific Micronutrient Deficiencies and Their Management:

#### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Characterized by "little leaf" (small, narrow leaves), rosetting of leaves at the shoot tips, interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on young leaves, and reduced fruit size and quality.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Spray:**
        *   **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** (21% Zn): 2.5-5.0 g/L of water (0.25-0.5% solution).
        *   **Zinc EDTA** (12% Zn): 1.0 g/L of water (0.1% solution).
    *   **Soil Application (based on soil test):**
        *   **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** (21% Zn): 10-25 kg/acre, broadcast and incorporated before planting or during dormancy.

#### 2. Iron (Fe) Deficiency (Ferrous Deficiency)

*   **Symptoms:** Pronounced interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, with veins remaining distinctly green. In severe cases, entire leaves may turn yellow or even white, leading to stunted growth and reduced fruit set. Common in alkaline soils (high pH) prevalent in Haryana.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Spray (preferred for quick correction in high pH soils):**
        *   **Ferrous Sulphate Heptahydrate** (19% Fe): 2.5-5.0 g/L of water (0.25-0.5% solution).
        *   **Ferrous EDTA** (12% Fe): 1.0 g/L of water (0.1% solution).
    *   **Soil Application (less effective in high pH soils, but can be used):**
        *   **Ferrous Sulphate Heptahydrate** (19% Fe): 25-50 kg/acre, incorporated.
        *   **Ferrous EDDHA** (6% Fe, more stable in alkaline soils): 5-10 kg/acre, applied in the root zone.

#### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Dieback of growing points, stunted growth, cracking and corkiness of fruits, internal browning of fruit flesh, reduced fruit set, and distorted leaf shape.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Spray:**
        *   **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (20% B): 1.0-2.0 g/L of water (0.1-0.2% solution).
        *   **Boric Acid** (17% B): 1.0 g/L of water (0.1% solution).
    *   **Soil Application (use with extreme caution, as boron toxicity is easy):**
        *   **Borax** (10.5% B): 5-10 kg/acre, broadcast and incorporated.
        *   **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (20% B): 2-4 kg/acre.
        *   **Always perform a soil test before soil application of Boron.**

#### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** While classic "blossom end rot" is rare in peaches, calcium deficiency can manifest as poor fruit quality, soft fruits, reduced shelf life, tip burn on young leaves, and stunted root growth.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Spray (during fruit development stages):**
        *   **Calcium Chloride** (77% CaCl2): 5.0-10.0 g/L of water (0.5-1.0% solution).
        *   **Calcium Nitrate** (19% Ca): 5.0-10.0 g/L of water (0.5-1.0% solution).
    *   **Soil Application (for long-term soil amendment and supply):**
        *   **Gypsum** (Calcium Sulphate Dihydrate): As per soil test recommendations, especially for sodic soils (typically 2-4 tonnes/acre, incorporated).
        *   **Calcium Nitrate** (19% Ca): 50-100 kg/acre, applied in split doses.

#### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, with veins remaining green. The yellowing may progress to reddish or purplish discoloration, followed by premature leaf drop.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Spray:**
        *   **Magnesium Sulphate Heptahydrate** (Epsom salt, 9.6% Mg): 5.0-10.0 g/L of water (0.5-1.0% solution).
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   **Magnesium Sulphate Heptahydrate** (9.6% Mg): 25-50 kg/acre, broadcast and incorporated.
        *   **Dolomite** (Calcium Magnesium Carbonate): As per soil test recommendations for soil pH adjustment and Mg supply (typically 1-2 tonnes/acre).

#### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, often appearing as a fine network of green veins against a lighter green or yellowish background. Can be confused with iron deficiency but usually less severe and more uniform.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Spray:**
        *   **Manganese Sulphate Monohydrate** (30.5% Mn): 2.0-5.0 g/L of water (0.2-0.5% solution).
        *   **Manganese EDTA** (12% Mn): 1.0 g/L of water (0.1% solution).
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   **Manganese Sulphate Monohydrate** (30.5% Mn): 10-20 kg/acre, broadcast and incorporated.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Water Quality:** Ensure the water used for foliar sprays is clean and has a suitable pH (usually slightly acidic to neutral) for optimal nutrient absorption.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management:** Micronutrient applications should be part of a holistic nutrient management plan that includes macronutrients (N, P, K) and organic matter.
*   **Consultation:** Always consult with HAU experts or local agricultural extension officers with your specific soil test reports for tailored recommendations.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively manage micronutrient deficiencies in your peach orchard and ensure healthy, productive trees.
