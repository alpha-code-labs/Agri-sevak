As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified recommendations for the use of growth regulators and Boron in Peach cultivation in Haryana:

*   **Ethrel (Ethephon)**
    *   **Purpose:** Primarily used for fruit thinning to improve fruit size and quality, and to promote uniform ripening.
    *   **Dose for Fruit Thinning:** Apply **Ethephon** at 100-150 mg/L (ppm) as a foliar spray, 7-14 days after full bloom, when fruitlets are 10-15 mm in diameter.
    *   **Dose for Ripening:** Apply **Ethephon** at 200-300 mg/L (ppm) as a foliar spray, 7-10 days before anticipated harvest.
    *   **Note:** Always ensure adequate soil moisture and good tree vigor before application. Avoid application during hot, dry conditions.

*   **2,4-D (2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid)**
    *   **Recommendation:** The use of **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid** (2,4-D) as a growth regulator in peach is generally *not recommended* due to its narrow margin of safety and high risk of phytotoxicity (damage to the plant) even at very low concentrations. It is primarily known as a herbicide, and its misapplication can lead to severe leaf malformation, fruit distortion, and significant yield loss in peaches. Safer and more effective alternatives are available for managing fruit drop or size.

*   **Boron**
    *   **Purpose:** Boron is an essential micronutrient critical for pollen germination, fruit set, and overall fruit development. It helps prevent conditions like poor fruit set and fruit malformation.
    *   **Dose (Foliar Spray):** Apply **Boric acid** at 1-2 g/L of water as a foliar spray.
    *   **Timing:**
        *   First spray: Just before flowering (pink bud stage).
        *   Second spray: At petal fall (when most petals have dropped).
    *   **Note:** Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage. Boron deficiency is common in some soils, and regular application can significantly improve fruit quality and yield.
