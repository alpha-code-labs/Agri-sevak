Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I understand the importance of maintaining optimal nutrient levels for healthy peach orchards in Haryana. Addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium) is crucial for good yield and fruit quality.

**Crucial First Step:** Before applying any fertilizers, it is highly recommended to conduct a **soil test** through a certified laboratory. This will provide precise information about the existing nutrient levels in your soil and allow for tailored recommendations, preventing over-application and nutrient imbalances. The following recommendations are general guidelines; adjust based on your soil test results and tree age/vigour.

### Addressing Macro-nutrient Deficiencies in Peach

#### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Yellowing of older leaves (chlorosis), stunted growth, reduced fruit set, and smaller fruit size.

**Correction Methods:**

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Urea** (46% Nitrogen).
    *   **Dosage:**
        *   For young trees (1-3 years): 100-300 g **Urea** per tree per year.
        *   For mature trees (>3 years): 400-800 g **Urea** per tree per year.
    *   **Application:** Split the annual dose into 2-3 applications. A common schedule is pre-flowering (February-March), fruit set (April), and post-harvest (June-July). Apply in a ring around the tree within the drip line and lightly incorporate into the soil. Always irrigate immediately after application.

*   **Foliar Application (for quick response or mild deficiency):**
    *   Spray with **Urea**.
    *   **Dosage:** 5-10 g **Urea** per litre of water (0.5-1% solution).
    *   **Application:** Spray during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to avoid leaf scorch. Repeat every 10-15 days if symptoms persist.

#### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Dark green or purplish discoloration of older leaves, stunted growth, poor root development, delayed maturity, and reduced fruit quality.

**Correction Methods:**

*   **Soil Application (Phosphorus is less mobile in soil, so foliar application is generally less effective for severe deficiencies):**
    *   Apply **Diammonium Phosphate** (DAP, 18% N, 46% P2O5) or **Single Superphosphate** (SSP, 16% P2O5).
    *   **Dosage:**
        *   For young trees (1-3 years): 100-200 g **Diammonium Phosphate** or 300-600 g **Single Superphosphate** per tree per year.
        *   For mature trees (>3 years): 300-600 g **Diammonium Phosphate** or 900-1800 g **Single Superphosphate** per tree per year.
    *   **Application:** Apply the full annual dose once, preferably before flowering (January-February) or during dormancy, by incorporating it into the soil around the tree. Ensure good irrigation after application.

#### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Scorching or browning of leaf margins (especially older leaves), weak branches, poor fruit colour, reduced fruit size, and susceptibility to diseases.

**Correction Methods:**

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Potassium Chloride** (Muriate of Potash, MOP, 60% K2O) or **Potassium Sulphate** (Sulphate of Potash, SOP, 50% K2O).
    *   **Dosage:**
        *   For young trees (1-3 years): 100-200 g **Potassium Chloride** or 120-240 g **Potassium Sulphate** per tree per year.
        *   For mature trees (>3 years): 300-600 g **Potassium Chloride** or 360-720 g **Potassium Sulphate** per tree per year.
    *   **Application:** Split the annual dose into 2 applications: one before flowering (February-March) and another during fruit development (April-May). Apply in a ring around the tree and incorporate into the soil. Irrigate well after application.

*   **Foliar Application (for quick response or mild deficiency):**
    *   Spray with **Potassium Sulphate**.
    *   **Dosage:** 5-10 g **Potassium Sulphate** per litre of water (0.5-1% solution).
    *   **Application:** Spray during fruit development to improve fruit quality and colour. Repeat every 10-15 days if needed.

**General Recommendations:**

*   **Integrated Nutrient Management (INM):** Supplement chemical fertilizers with organic manures like well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost (20-30 kg per mature tree per year) to improve soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability.
*   **Water Management:** Ensure adequate and timely irrigation, especially after fertilizer application, to facilitate nutrient uptake.
*   **Timing:** Adjust application timings based on the specific growth stage of your peach trees and local climatic conditions in Haryana.
