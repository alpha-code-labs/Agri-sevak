As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Peach cultivation in Haryana.

Effective management of fungal diseases in peach requires an integrated approach combining cultural practices and judicious application of CIBRC approved fungicides.

**General Cultural Practices for Fungal Disease Management:**

*   **Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy fallen leaves, mummified fruits, and diseased branches from the orchard. This reduces inoculum sources.
*   **Pruning:** Prune trees annually to improve air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce humidity and fungal growth. Remove dead, diseased, or crossing branches.
*   **Weed Control:** Keep the orchard floor free of weeds to reduce humidity and alternate hosts for pathogens.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate spacing between trees at planting to facilitate air movement and reduce disease spread.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced fertilizers to maintain tree vigor, as stressed trees are more susceptible to diseases. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can promote lush, susceptible growth.
*   **Irrigation Management:** Use drip irrigation or avoid overhead irrigation, especially during flowering and fruit development, to minimize leaf wetness periods.

**Specific Fungal Diseases and Their Control in Peach:**

1.  **Alternaria (Alternaria Fruit Rot / Leaf Spot)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Dark brown to black spots on leaves, often with concentric rings. On fruits, sunken, dark lesions develop, leading to rot.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   **Cultural:** Implement good orchard sanitation. Prune to improve air circulation.
        *   **Chemical:**
            *   **Mancozeb:** 2.0-2.5 g/L of water, applied preventively.
            *   **Chlorothalonil:** 2.0 g/L of water, applied preventively.
            *   **Azoxystrobin:** 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water, for systemic protection.
            *   **Difenoconazole:** 0.5 ml/L of water, for systemic action.

2.  **Anthracnose**
    *   **Symptoms:** Sunken, circular, dark brown to black lesions on fruits, often with pinkish spore masses in humid conditions. Can also affect leaves and twigs.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   **Cultural:** Remove and destroy infected fruits and twigs. Maintain good orchard hygiene.
        *   **Chemical:**
            *   **Mancozeb:** 2.0-2.5 g/L of water, applied preventively.
            *   **Captan:** 2.0-2.5 g/L of water, applied preventively.
            *   **Chlorothalonil:** 2.0 g/L of water, applied preventively.
            *   **Carbendazim:** 0.5-1.0 g/L of water, for systemic control.
            *   **Azoxystrobin:** 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water, for systemic protection.

3.  **Blast**
    *   This is not known to affect Peach (as a fungal disease). Bacterial blast (*Pseudomonas syringae*) can affect peach, but the question specifically asks about fungal diseases.

4.  **Blight (Fungal Blights, primarily Blossom Blight and Twig Blight caused by *Monilinia* species)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Blossoms turn brown and die, remaining attached to the twig. Twigs may also die back from the tip, and cankers may form.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   **Cultural:** Prune out and destroy blighted blossoms and twigs. Remove mummified fruits from the previous season.
        *   **Chemical:**
            *   **Thiophanate Methyl:** 0.7-1.0 g/L of water, applied at bloom.
            *   **Carbendazim:** 0.5-1.0 g/L of water, applied at bloom.
            *   **Propiconazole:** 0.5 ml/L of water, applied at bloom.
            *   **Tebuconazole:** 0.75-1.0 ml/L of water, applied at bloom.
            *   **Myclobutanil:** 0.4-0.6 ml/L of water, applied at bloom.

5.  **Brown spot**
    *   This is not known to affect Peach (as a distinct fungal disease name). Brown rot (*Monilinia* species) causes brown lesions on fruit, but "Brown spot" is not a specific fungal disease name for peach.

6.  **Downy mildew**
    *   This is not known to affect Peach.

7.  **Powdery mildew**
    *   **Symptoms:** White, powdery patches on young leaves, shoots, and sometimes fruits. Infected leaves may curl or distort.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   **Cultural:** Ensure good air circulation through proper pruning and spacing.
        *   **Chemical:**
            *   **Sulphur (Wettable Powder):** 2.0-3.0 g/L of water, applied preventively, especially effective in early stages. Avoid application in very hot weather.
            *   **Myclobutanil:** 0.4-0.6 ml/L of water, for systemic control.
            *   **Difenoconazole:** 0.5 ml/L of water, for systemic action.
            *   **Tebuconazole:** 0.75-1.0 ml/L of water, for systemic control.
            *   **Kresoxim Methyl:** 0.5 ml/L of water, for systemic protection.

8.  **Grey mildew**
    *   This is not known to affect Peach (as a fungal disease name). Grey mold (*Botrytis cinerea*) can affect peach, but it is distinct from mildew.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the fungicide label for specific dosage, application timing, and safety precautions.
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of fungicide resistance.
*   Apply fungicides preventively, especially during critical growth stages (e.g., bloom, fruit development), or at the first sign of disease symptoms.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension services for specific recommendations tailored to your region and current disease pressure.
