As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in Peach orchards in Haryana:

It is crucial to correctly identify the pest before applying any control measures. Always follow label instructions for any pesticide and observe pre-harvest intervals (PHI).

### Control Measures for Peach Pests:

#### 1. Borers (e.g., Peach Tree Borer, Shot-hole Borer)

Borers can cause significant damage by tunneling into the trunk, branches, or roots, leading to weakening of the tree and sometimes death.

*   **Cultural Practices:** Maintain tree vigor, avoid mechanical injuries, and prune dead or infested branches.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   For trunk borers, apply a drench or swab the affected trunk and main branches, especially around bore holes, during periods of borer activity (e.g., spring and late summer).
        *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 2.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   For shot-hole borers, ensure proper sanitation and remove infested wood. Systemic insecticides can offer some protection.

#### 2. Caterpillars (General Defoliators)

Various caterpillar species can feed on peach leaves, causing defoliation.

*   **Cultural Practices:** Hand-picking in small orchards, removal of egg masses or webs.
*   **Chemical Control:** Apply foliar sprays when caterpillars are actively feeding and before significant damage occurs.
    *   **Emamectin Benzoate** 5% SG at 0.2 g/L of water.
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC at 0.2 ml/L of water.
    *   **Indoxacarb** 14.5% SC at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Spinosad** 45% SC at 0.25 ml/L of water (effective against a wide range of caterpillars and suitable for IPM).

#### 3. Diamondback Moth

This is not known to affect Peach. Diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) is primarily a pest of cruciferous vegetables.

#### 4. Leaf Folder

Leaf folders are typically larval stages of moths that fold or roll leaves and feed from within the protected structure.

*   **Cultural Practices:** Monitor for folded leaves and remove them manually in small infestations.
*   **Chemical Control:** Apply foliar sprays targeting the larval stages.
    *   **Emamectin Benzoate** 5% SG at 0.2 g/L of water.
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC at 0.2 ml/L of water.
    *   **Indoxacarb** 14.5% SC at 0.5 ml/L of water.

### General Recommendations:

*   **Integrated Pest Management (IPM):** Always prioritize cultural and biological control methods. Use chemical control as a last resort and in conjunction with IPM principles.
*   **Safety Precautions:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during pesticide application.
*   **Spraying Technique:** Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage and affected parts of the tree.
*   **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your orchard for pest presence and damage to enable timely intervention.
*   **Consultation:** For specific or severe infestations, it is advisable to consult with local agricultural extension specialists or HAU experts.
