As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding rust diseases in Peach for Haryana.

Regarding the specific rust diseases you mentioned:

*   **Black Rust (Stem Rust):** This is not known to affect Peach. It primarily affects cereal crops like wheat, barley, and rye.
*   **Brown Rust (Leaf Rust):** This is not known to affect Peach. It primarily affects cereal crops like wheat, barley, and rye.
*   **Yellow Rust (Stripe Rust):** This is not known to affect Peach. It primarily affects cereal crops like wheat, barley, and rye.
*   **White Rust:** This is not known to affect Peach. It primarily affects cruciferous vegetables (e.g., mustard, radish) and some other plants like spinach and sweet potato.
*   **Red Rust:** This is not known to affect Peach as a fungal rust disease. "Red rust" is typically caused by an alga (*Cephaleuros virescens*) and affects crops like tea, coffee, mango, and litchi, causing reddish-brown spots on leaves and stems, but it is not a common or significant issue for peach in Haryana.

The primary rust disease affecting Peach is commonly known as **Peach Rust** or **Prune Rust**, caused by the fungus *Tranzschelia discolor* (also known as *Tranzschelia pruni-spinosae* var. *discolor*). This disease causes small, angular, yellow spots on the upper surface of leaves, which turn reddish-brown. On the underside of the leaves, powdery, rust-colored pustules develop. Severe infections can lead to premature defoliation, reduced fruit size, and weakened trees.

Here's how to control Peach Rust (*Tranzschelia discolor*):

**I. Cultural Practices:**

*   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy fallen leaves and infected twigs during autumn and winter, as the fungus can overwinter in plant debris.
*   **Pruning:** Ensure proper pruning to improve air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce humidity and fungal growth.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available and suitable for local conditions, consider planting peach varieties known to have some resistance to rust.

**II. Chemical Control (Fungicides):**

Fungicide applications are crucial for effective management, especially during periods favorable for disease development (warm, humid conditions). Start applications preventatively or at the first sign of symptoms.

*   **Early Season/Preventative:**
    *   Apply a protective fungicide during the early growing season, particularly after petal fall and during fruit development, if rust has been a problem in previous years.
    *   **Wettable Sulphur** (80% WP): 2.0-2.5 kg per 500-600 litres of water per acre (0.4-0.5% solution).
    *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP): 1.0-1.25 kg per 500-600 litres of water per acre (0.2-0.25% solution).

*   **Curative/Systemic (upon symptom appearance or for established infections):**
    *   **Difenoconazole** (25% EC): 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Propiconazole** (25% EC): 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Myclobutanil** (10% WP): 0.4-0.5 g per litre of water.
    *   **Tebuconazole** (25.9% EC): 0.75 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC): 0.5 ml per litre of water.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Spray Interval:** Repeat applications every 10-14 days, especially during periods of high humidity or rainfall, or as per product label recommendations.
*   **Alternation:** To prevent the development of fungicide resistance, it is crucial to alternate fungicides with different modes of action.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough coverage of all leaf surfaces (upper and lower) and twigs for optimal efficacy.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always observe the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) specified on the fungicide label to ensure fruit safety.
