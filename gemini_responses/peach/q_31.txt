Dear Farmer,

Addressing physical damage in peach orchards requires a comprehensive approach focusing on proper cultural practices and timely interventions. Here's how to manage the issues you've described:

### 1. Fruit Bursting (Fruit Cracking/Splitting)

Fruit bursting is primarily a physiological disorder caused by sudden fluctuations in soil moisture, leading to rapid water uptake and internal pressure that the fruit skin cannot withstand. Nutrient deficiencies can also contribute.

*   **Consistent Water Management:** Maintain uniform soil moisture throughout the fruit development period. Avoid extremes of drought followed by heavy irrigation or rainfall.
    *   Implement drip irrigation for precise water delivery.
    *   Apply mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves, black plastic) around the base of trees to conserve soil moisture and regulate soil temperature.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure adequate supply of essential nutrients, particularly those involved in cell wall integrity.
    *   **Calcium:** Apply **Calcium nitrate** (1-2 kg/acre) as a soil drench or foliar spray (5-10 g/L water) during fruit development stages. Calcium strengthens cell walls and improves skin elasticity.
    *   **Boron:** If boron deficiency is suspected (e.g., based on soil test), apply **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate) at 10-15 kg/acre as a soil application or **Boric acid** (1-2 g/L water) as a foliar spray before flowering and during fruit set.
*   **Variety Selection:** Choose peach varieties known for their resistance to fruit cracking, if available and suitable for Haryana's climate.
*   **Pruning:** Maintain an open canopy through proper pruning to ensure good air circulation and light penetration, which can indirectly help in uniform fruit development.

### 2. Leaf Burning/Melting (Leaf Scorch/Sunburn)

This condition is often a result of heat stress, intense solar radiation, and/or water stress. Chemical phytotoxicity can also cause similar symptoms.

*   **Adequate and Consistent Irrigation:** Ensure trees receive sufficient water, especially during hot periods and when fruit is developing. Water stress makes leaves more susceptible to burning.
*   **Mulching:** Apply organic mulch around the tree base to keep the soil cool, conserve moisture, and reduce soil temperature fluctuations.
*   **Canopy Management:** Prune trees to maintain a balanced canopy that provides some self-shading to the fruit and inner leaves, without being excessively dense. Avoid over-pruning that exposes too much of the tree to direct sun.
*   **Nutrient Balance:** Ensure a balanced nutrient supply. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can lead to lush, tender growth more susceptible to sun damage.
*   **Foliar Sprays for Stress Mitigation:**
    *   **Potassium Nitrate:** Foliar application of **Potassium nitrate** (5-10 g/L water) can help improve plant tolerance to heat and drought stress. Apply during periods of high temperature.
    *   **Amino Acid Formulations:** Some CIBRC-approved amino acid-based formulations can help plants recover from stress. Follow product-specific recommendations.
*   **Careful Chemical Application:**
    *   Always follow label instructions for pesticides and fungicides strictly.
    *   Avoid spraying during the hottest part of the day or when temperatures are extremely high, as this can lead to phytotoxicity (chemical burn).
    *   Ensure proper dilution rates.

### 3. Hardness in Fruit (Failure to Soften/Poor Texture)

If the fruit remains unusually hard and fails to soften properly at maturity, or has an undesirable hard texture, it can be due to several factors related to cultural practices and environmental conditions.

*   **Optimal Harvest Maturity:** Harvest peaches at the correct stage of physiological maturity. Harvesting too early will result in fruit that fails to ripen properly and remains hard.
*   **Consistent Water Supply:** Ensure adequate and consistent water availability during the fruit development and ripening stages. Water stress can lead to smaller, harder fruit with poor texture.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:**
    *   **Potassium:** Ensure sufficient **Potassium** supply, as it plays a crucial role in fruit quality, size, and ripening. Apply **Potassium sulphate** (50-100 kg/acre) as a soil application based on soil test recommendations. Foliar sprays of **Potassium nitrate** (5-10 g/L water) can also supplement.
    *   Avoid excessive nitrogen late in the season, which can delay ripening and affect fruit quality.
*   **Fruit Thinning:** Proper fruit thinning is essential. Over-cropping leads to smaller fruit that may not ripen uniformly or achieve desirable size and texture. Thin fruits to appropriate spacing (e.g., 15-20 cm apart) after natural fruit drop.
*   **Temperature Management:** Peaches require specific temperature ranges for optimal ripening. Extreme temperatures (too hot or too cold) during the ripening phase can affect the softening process. Mulching and proper canopy management can help moderate orchard temperatures.

Always conduct a soil test to understand your specific nutrient requirements and consult with HAU experts for tailored advice.
