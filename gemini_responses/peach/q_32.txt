Namaste! The symptom of "drying up" in peach, manifesting as drying branches, leaves, fruits, and flowers, is a general indicator of underlying stress or disease. As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I must emphasize that accurate diagnosis is crucial before implementing any management strategy.

Here are the potential causes and recommended approaches for addressing "drying up" in peach in Haryana:

### I. Potential Causes of Drying Up in Peach

The drying symptoms can be broadly categorized into abiotic (non-living) and biotic (living organism) factors:

**A. Abiotic Factors:**

1.  **Water Stress:**
    *   **Drought:** Insufficient irrigation, especially during critical growth stages (flowering, fruit development), leads to wilting and drying.
    *   **Waterlogging:** Excess water can lead to root asphyxiation and root rot, impairing water uptake and causing symptoms similar to drought stress.
2.  **Nutrient Deficiencies/Imbalances:** Severe deficiencies of certain nutrients (e.g., Potassium, Calcium, Boron) can cause leaf scorch, dieback, and poor fruit development.
3.  **Environmental Stress:**
    *   **Heat Stress/Sunburn:** Intense summer heat can scorch leaves and fruits, leading to drying.
    *   **Frost Damage:** Late frosts can damage tender new shoots, flowers, and young fruits, causing them to blacken and dry up.
    *   **Salinity:** High salt content in soil or irrigation water can cause leaf margin burn and overall plant stress, leading to drying.
4.  **Root Damage:** Physical damage to roots during cultivation or due to rodent activity can impair water and nutrient uptake.

**B. Biotic Factors:**

1.  **Fungal Diseases:**
    *   **Gummosis and Dieback Complex:** Often caused by fungi like *Botryosphaeria dothidea* or *Phomopsis amygdali*. These fungi infect branches, causing cankers, gum exudation, and subsequent drying of branches above the infected area.
    *   **Root Rot:** Caused by fungi such as *Phytophthora* species, especially in poorly drained soils. It damages roots, leading to wilting, yellowing, and eventual drying of the entire plant.
    *   **Verticillium Wilt:** Caused by *Verticillium dahliae*, this soil-borne fungus invades the vascular system, blocking water transport and causing wilting and drying of branches.
2.  **Bacterial Diseases:**
    *   **Bacterial Canker (*Pseudomonas syringae*):** This bacterium causes cankers on branches and trunks, leading to gumming and dieback. It can also infect flowers and young fruits, causing them to shrivel and dry.
3.  **Insect Pests:**
    *   **Stem Borers:** Larvae of certain beetles (e.g., peach stem borer) bore into the main stem or branches, disrupting nutrient and water flow, leading to wilting and drying of affected parts.
    *   **Root-Knot Nematodes:** These microscopic worms infect roots, forming galls and impairing water and nutrient absorption, leading to overall plant decline and drying symptoms.

### II. Management Strategies

Based on the likely cause, an integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods is recommended.

**A. General Cultural Practices (Preventive and Supportive):**

1.  **Proper Irrigation:** Ensure consistent and adequate watering, especially during dry periods. Avoid both drought stress and waterlogging. Use drip irrigation for efficient water use.
2.  **Balanced Nutrition:** Conduct soil testing to determine nutrient status and apply fertilizers as per recommendations. Ensure adequate supply of macro and micronutrients.
3.  **Pruning:**
    *   Regularly remove dead, diseased, or weak branches.
    *   Sanitize pruning tools with a 10% bleach solution or methylated spirit between cuts to prevent disease spread.
    *   Prune during dry weather to minimize infection risk.
4.  **Orchard Sanitation:** Remove and destroy fallen leaves, fruits, and diseased plant parts to reduce inoculum sources.
5.  **Soil Health:** Improve soil drainage and aeration by incorporating organic matter. Mulching around the base of trees helps conserve soil moisture and regulate temperature.
6.  **Variety Selection:** Where possible, choose peach varieties known for their resistance or tolerance to common diseases in the region.

**B. Specific Interventions (Based on Diagnosis):**

**1. For Fungal Dieback/Gummosis (e.g., *Botryosphaeria*):**
    *   Prune out affected branches well below the canker into healthy wood.
    *   Apply a protective fungicidal spray after pruning and during susceptible periods.
    *   **Carbendazim** @ 1 g/L of water.
    *   **Mancozeb** @ 2.5 g/L of water.
    *   *Application:* Spray thoroughly to cover all parts of the tree.

**2. For Bacterial Canker (*Pseudomonas syringae*):**
    *   Prune out infected branches during dry periods.
    *   Apply copper-based bactericides as a protective spray, especially after pruning or during dormancy.
    *   **Copper oxychloride** @ 3 g/L of water.
    *   *Application:* Spray thoroughly, ensuring good coverage of bark and branches.

**3. For Root Rot (*Phytophthora* species):**
    *   Improve soil drainage immediately.
    *   Apply fungicides as a soil drench around the base of affected trees.
    *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride** @ 2-3 ml/L of water (drench).
    *   **Fosetyl-aluminium** @ 2.5 g/L of water (foliar spray or drench).
    *   *Application:* Drench the soil around the root zone.

**4. For Stem Borers:**
    *   Identify and physically remove borers by inserting a wire into the boreholes.
    *   Inject an insecticide into the boreholes and seal them with mud or wax.
    *   **Chlorpyrifos** @ 2 ml/L of water (for injection into boreholes).
    *   *Application:* Inject the solution into the borer holes using a syringe.

**5. For Root-Knot Nematodes:**
    *   Improve soil organic matter content.
    *   Use resistant rootstocks if available for new plantings.
    *   In severe cases, soil application of nematicides may be considered, but this requires careful handling and expert advice.
    *   **Carbofuran** @ 10 kg/acre (granular, soil application, *ensure local approval and safety precautions*).

**Important Note:** Before applying any chemical, always read the label carefully for dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).

For a precise diagnosis and tailored recommendations, I strongly advise you to bring samples of the affected branches, leaves, and fruits to the Plant Pathology or Entomology Department at Haryana Agricultural University, Hisar. Our experts can provide a definitive diagnosis and the most effective management plan for your specific situation.
