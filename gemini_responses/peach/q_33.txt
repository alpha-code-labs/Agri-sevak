As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling weeds in Peach orchards in Haryana. Effective weed management is crucial for healthy peach tree growth and yield.

**General Weed Management Principles in Peach Orchards:**

*   **Integrated Approach:** Combine cultural practices (mulching, hand weeding, inter-row cultivation where appropriate) with judicious use of herbicides.
*   **Timing:** Apply pre-emergent herbicides before weed germination and post-emergent herbicides when weeds are young and actively growing for best results.
*   **Safety:** Always use shielded sprayers for non-selective herbicides to prevent contact with peach foliage, bark, or fruit. Avoid spraying during windy conditions.
*   **Water Volume:** Ensure adequate water volume for thorough coverage, typically 200-400 litres per acre for herbicide application.

Here's how to control the specific weeds mentioned:

1.  **Broadleaf Weeds (General, including Bathu and Congress grass):**
    *   **Pre-emergent Control (before weed emergence):**
        *   Apply **Diuron** 80% WP at 1.25 - 2.5 kg/acre, or
        *   Apply **Simazine** 50% WP at 2 - 4 kg/acre, or
        *   Apply **Oxyfluorfen** 23.5% EC at 850 ml - 1.7 litres/acre.
        *   These should be applied to moist soil or followed by light irrigation for activation.
    *   **Post-emergent Control (after weed emergence):**
        *   For young, actively growing weeds, use **Glyphosate** 41% SL at 2 - 3 litres/acre (or 10-15 ml/litre of water for spot treatment). **Crucially, use a shielded sprayer to prevent any contact with peach trees.**
        *   Alternatively, **Paraquat dichloride** 24% SL at 2 - 4 litres/acre (or 5-10 ml/litre of water for spot treatment). This is a contact herbicide, so ensure thorough coverage of weeds. **Again, use a shielded sprayer to avoid contact with peach trees.**

2.  **Narrowleaf Weeds (Grasses, including Phalaris minor):**
    *   **Pre-emergent Control (before weed emergence):**
        *   Apply **Diuron** 80% WP at 1.25 - 2.5 kg/acre, or
        *   Apply **Simazine** 50% WP at 2 - 4 kg/acre, or
        *   Apply **Pendimethalin** 30% EC at 3.3 litres/acre.
    *   **Post-emergent Control (after weed emergence):**
        *   For selective control of grasses, apply **Quizalofop-ethyl** 5% EC at 1 - 2 litres/acre, or
        *   Apply **Fluazifop-P-butyl** 25% EC at 0.5 - 1 litre/acre. These are systemic grass-specific herbicides and are generally safe for broadleaf crops like peach.
        *   Alternatively, for non-selective control, use **Glyphosate** 41% SL at 2 - 3 litres/acre or **Paraquat dichloride** 24% SL at 2 - 4 litres/acre, **always with a shielded sprayer.**

3.  **Amarbail (Cuscuta spp. - Dodder):**
    *   **Prevention:**
        *   Ensure clean planting material.
        *   Remove any host weeds in and around the orchard before Cuscuta can establish.
        *   Pre-emergent application of **Pendimethalin** 30% EC at 3.3 litres/acre can help reduce germination of Cuscuta seeds.
    *   **Control of Established Amarbail:**
        *   **Manual Removal:** This is the most effective method. Carefully remove any Amarbail strands by hand as soon as they are noticed, ensuring no fragments are left behind. If it's on other weeds, remove those weeds.
        *   If Amarbail is heavily infesting specific weeds, those weeds can be targeted with **Paraquat dichloride** 24% SL (5-10 ml/litre of water) as a directed spray, taking extreme care to avoid contact with peach trees. Direct chemical control of Amarbail *on peach trees* is very challenging without harming the tree.

4.  **Orobanche (Broomrape):**
    *   This is not known to affect Peach. Orobanche species are parasitic weeds that primarily affect dicotyledonous field crops such as mustard, tomato, brinjal, and sunflower, but peach trees are not considered a host for economically important Orobanche species.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the herbicide label carefully.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension office for the most current and specific recommendations for your region and orchard conditions.
