As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an integrated pest management (IPM) approach for controlling sucking pests (Aphids, Leafhopper, Whitefly, Thrips, and Psylla) in Peach orchards. Timely monitoring and intervention are crucial for effective control.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategy:**

1.  **Monitoring:**
    *   Regularly inspect peach trees, especially the undersides of leaves, young shoots, and flowers, for the presence of pests or symptoms of their damage (e.g., curling leaves, honeydew, sooty mold, distorted growth).
    *   Early detection allows for more effective and targeted control measures.

2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the orchard floor free of weeds, as many weeds can serve as alternate hosts for these sucking pests.
    *   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy severely infested shoots or branches during routine pruning, especially if the infestation is localized.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush, succulent growth that is more attractive to sucking pests.

3.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Conserve and encourage natural enemies such as ladybird beetles, lacewings, hoverfly larvae, and parasitic wasps, which prey on aphids, whiteflies, and other soft-bodied insects. Avoid using broad-spectrum insecticides that can harm these beneficial insects.

4.  **Chemical Control:**
    *   Apply insecticides only when pest populations reach economic threshold levels and cultural/biological methods are insufficient.
    *   Ensure thorough spray coverage, particularly on the undersides of leaves where many of these pests reside.
    *   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.

**Recommended CIBRC Approved Insecticides for Sucking Pests in Peach:**

When chemical intervention is necessary, consider the following options. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions.

*   **For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, Thrips, and Psylla:**
    *   **Imidacloprid** (17.8% SL formulation): Apply at 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Thiamethoxam** (25% WG formulation): Apply at 0.3 g per litre of water.
    *   **Acetamiprid** (20% SP formulation): Apply at 0.3 g per litre of water.
    *   **Spirotetramat** (150 OD formulation): Apply at 0.75 ml per litre of water. This is particularly effective against whiteflies and aphids due to its systemic action.
    *   **Diafenthiuron** (50% WP formulation): Apply at 1.0 g per litre of water. Effective against whiteflies, thrips, and also has some miticidal action.

**General Application Guidelines:**
*   The recommended spray volume is typically 500-750 litres per acre, depending on the size and canopy density of the peach trees. Adjust the water volume to ensure complete coverage without runoff.
*   Always use clean water for spraying.
*   Adhere to the pre-harvest interval (PHI) specified on the pesticide label to ensure fruit safety.

By combining these strategies, you can effectively manage sucking pests in your peach orchard, ensuring healthy trees and good fruit yield.
