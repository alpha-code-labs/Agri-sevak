As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified practices for peach transplantation in Haryana:

### Ideal Transplantation Time

The ideal time for transplanting peach saplings in Haryana is during their dormant period, which allows the plant to establish its root system before the onset of active growth.

*   **Late Winter to Early Spring:** The best period is typically from **January to February**, before the new buds begin to swell and break. This timing minimizes transplant shock and ensures better establishment.

### Transplantation Distance (Spacing)

Proper spacing is crucial for optimal light penetration, air circulation, pest and disease management, and overall tree health and productivity.

*   **Standard Spacing:** For most peach varieties grown on standard rootstocks in Haryana, a spacing of **5 meters x 5 meters** (plant-to-plant x row-to-row) is generally recommended.
*   **High-Density Planting:** For specific varieties or rootstocks suitable for high-density planting systems, spacing can be reduced, but this requires specialized training and pruning techniques. Consult with HAU experts for such specific recommendations.

### Transplantation Process

A meticulous transplantation process ensures high survival rates and vigorous growth of peach saplings.

1.  **Pit Preparation (1-2 months prior):**
    *   Dig pits of **1 meter x 1 meter x 1 meter** (length x width x depth) at the marked spacing.
    *   Separate the topsoil from the subsoil.
    *   Allow the pits to remain open for 15-30 days to expose the soil to sunlight and air, which helps in killing pests and pathogens.
    *   Refill each pit with a mixture of:
        *   Topsoil
        *   **20-30 kg** of well-rotted Farmyard Manure (FYM) or compost
        *   **1 kg** of Single Super Phosphate (SSP) or an equivalent phosphatic fertilizer (optional, based on soil test)
        *   **50-100 g** of a suitable insecticide (e.g., chlorpyrifos dust) if termite problems are prevalent (consult CIBRC guidelines for specific product and dosage).
    *   Mix the components thoroughly and mound the soil slightly above ground level to account for settling.

2.  **Sapling Selection:**
    *   Obtain healthy, disease-free saplings from a reputable nursery.
    *   Ensure the saplings have a well-developed root system and are free from any visible pests or diseases.
    *   Bare-root saplings should be planted immediately upon arrival. Polybag saplings can be stored for a short period but should not be allowed to become root-bound.

3.  **Planting:**
    *   Dig a hole in the center of the prepared pit, just large enough to accommodate the root ball of the sapling.
    *   Carefully remove the sapling from the polybag (if applicable), ensuring the root ball remains intact. For bare-root saplings, spread the roots evenly.
    *   Place the sapling in the hole, ensuring that the **graft union remains 10-15 cm above the soil line** to prevent scion rooting.
    *   Backfill the hole with the prepared soil mixture, gently firming the soil around the roots to remove air pockets. Avoid compacting the soil too much.
    *   Create a small basin around the plant for efficient watering.

4.  **Initial Watering:**
    *   Immediately after planting, water each sapling thoroughly until the soil is completely saturated. This helps in settling the soil around the roots.

5.  **Staking (if necessary):**
    *   If the sapling is tall or planted in a windy area, provide a sturdy stake for support to prevent it from swaying and damaging the newly forming roots.

6.  **Pruning (Heading Back):**
    *   After planting, prune the sapling by heading back the main stem to a height of **75-90 cm** from the ground. This encourages the development of strong scaffold branches at a desirable height. Remove any broken or damaged branches.

7.  **Post-Planting Care:**
    *   Maintain consistent moisture in the soil, especially during the initial establishment phase.
    *   Protect young saplings from pests, diseases, and animal damage.
    *   Regularly monitor for signs of stress or nutrient deficiencies.
