Mites, including Red Spider Mite (Tetranychus urticae) and Rust Mite (Aculus fockeui), are common pests of Peach in Haryana and can cause significant damage if not managed effectively. Here's a scientifically verified approach for their control:

**General Management Principles:**

*   **Regular Monitoring:** Inspect peach trees regularly, especially the underside of leaves, for early signs of mite infestation (stippling, bronzing, webbing for red spider mites; russeting/bronzing for rust mites).
*   **Proper Irrigation:** Ensure adequate and timely irrigation to reduce plant stress, which can make trees more susceptible to mite attacks.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, as it can promote lush, soft growth that is more attractive to mites.
*   **Weed Control:** Keep the orchard floor free of weeds, as some weeds can serve as alternate hosts for mites.
*   **Pruning:** Maintain good canopy ventilation through proper pruning, which can create less favorable conditions for mites.

**Chemical Control (Acaricides):**

For effective control of both Red Spider Mite and Rust Mite, consider the following CIBRC approved acaricides. Always ensure thorough coverage, especially on the underside of leaves, and rotate chemicals to prevent resistance development.

*   **Sulphur (Wettable Sulphur 80% WP):**
    *   Dosage: 2.0 - 3.0 g per litre of water.
    *   Notes: Highly effective against rust mites and also provides good suppression of red spider mites. Apply when temperatures are not excessively high (below 30°C) to avoid phytotoxicity.
*   **Propargite (57% EC):**
    *   Dosage: 1.0 - 1.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   Notes: Effective against both red spider mites and rust mites. It is a contact acaricide, so thorough coverage is crucial.
*   **Fenpyroximate (5% SC):**
    *   Dosage: 0.5 - 1.0 ml per litre of water.
    *   Notes: Provides good control of various mite stages, including eggs, larvae, nymphs, and adults of red spider mites, and is also effective against rust mites.
*   **Abamectin (1.9% EC):**
    *   Dosage: 0.3 - 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   Notes: A translaminar acaricide that provides good control of both red spider mites and rust mites. It has some residual activity.
*   **Spiromesifen (22.9% SC):**
    *   Dosage: 0.5 - 0.7 ml per litre of water.
    *   Notes: Primarily targets red spider mites by inhibiting lipid biosynthesis. It has ovicidal and nymphicidal activity. While primarily for tetranychid mites, it can offer some suppression of eriophyid mites.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Rotation:** To prevent the development of resistance, rotate between different classes of acaricides with different modes of action. Do not use the same chemical repeatedly.
*   **Timing:** Apply acaricides when mite populations are building up, before they reach damaging levels. Multiple applications might be necessary depending on the severity of infestation and product residual activity.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always observe the specified Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) mentioned on the product label to ensure the safety of the fruit for consumption.
*   **Water Volume:** Use sufficient water volume to ensure complete wetting of the foliage, especially the undersides of leaves where mites reside.
