As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following fertilizer doses for Peach cultivation in Haryana. Please note that these are general recommendations for *mature, bearing* trees and should ideally be adjusted based on a comprehensive soil test report from a recognized laboratory. Soil testing is crucial for precise nutrient management.

**General Fertilizer Application Guidelines:**

*   **Timing:** Phosphorus, Potassium, and Sulphur are generally applied once a year, before flowering (e.g., January-February). Nitrogen is typically split into 2-3 applications.
*   **Method:** Granular fertilizers should be broadcast evenly around the tree in the drip line (area under the canopy) and lightly incorporated into the soil, followed by irrigation. Foliar sprays should be applied evenly to the foliage.
*   **Organic Manure:** Supplementing with 20-30 kg of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost per tree per year is highly beneficial for soil health and nutrient availability.

**Recommended Fertilizer Doses for Bearing Peach Trees (5+ years old):**

1.  **Urea (46% N)**
    *   Dose: 200-400 g **Urea** per tree per year.
    *   Application: Split into 2-3 doses:
        *   1/2 dose: January-February (before flowering).
        *   1/2 dose: March-April (after fruit set).
        *   (Optional) For heavy bearing trees, a small dose can be given after harvest (May-June).

2.  **Nano-Urea (4% N liquid)**
    *   Dose: 2-4 ml **Nano-Urea** per litre of water (foliar spray).
    *   Application: 2-3 foliar sprays during active growth and fruit development (e.g., March, April, May).
    *   Note: **Nano-Urea** is a supplementary source of Nitrogen and should not fully replace granular **Urea**. It is best used to boost N availability during critical growth stages.

3.  **DAP (Diammonium Phosphate) (18% N, 46% P2O5)**
    *   Dose: 100-200 g **DAP** per tree per year.
    *   Application: Apply once, in January-February (before flowering).
    *   Note: When using **DAP**, reduce the **Urea** dose accordingly, as **DAP** also provides Nitrogen. For example, 200 g **DAP** provides approximately 36 g N.

4.  **Nano-DAP (8% N, 16% P2O5 liquid)**
    *   Dose: 2-4 ml **Nano-DAP** per litre of water (foliar spray).
    *   Application: 1-2 foliar sprays during flowering and fruit set stages (e.g., February, March).
    *   Note: Similar to **Nano-Urea**, **Nano-DAP** is a supplementary source and should not fully replace granular Phosphorus fertilizers.

5.  **NPK (Complex Fertilizers)**
    *   If using a balanced **NPK** complex fertilizer (e.g., 19:19:19, 12:32:16), the dose will depend on the specific grade and desired nutrient levels.
    *   Dose (for a balanced NPK like 19:19:19): 500-1000 g of **NPK** fertilizer per tree per year.
    *   Application: Split into 2 applications:
        *   1/2 dose: January-February (before flowering).
        *   1/2 dose: March-April (after fruit set).
    *   Note: If using **NPK** complex fertilizers, adjust or omit individual **Urea**, **DAP**, **Potash**, and **SSP** applications to avoid over-fertilization.

6.  **SSP (Single Super Phosphate) (16% P2O5, 11% S)**
    *   Dose: 300-600 g **SSP** per tree per year.
    *   Application: Apply once, in January-February (before flowering).
    *   Note: **SSP** is a good source of both Phosphorus and Sulphur. If using **SSP**, separate Sulphur application might not be needed.

7.  **Potash (Muriate of Potash / Sulphate of Potash)**
    *   Dose: 150-300 g **Muriate of Potash** (60% K2O) per tree per year.
    *   Application: Apply once, in January-February (before flowering).
    *   Note: If Sulphur deficiency is suspected or confirmed by soil test, **Sulphate of Potash** (50% K2O, 18% S) can be used at a slightly higher dose (e.g., 180-360 g/tree) to provide both K and S.

8.  **Sulphur (Elemental Sulphur 90%)**
    *   Dose: 20-40 g **Sulphur** (elemental, 90%) per tree per year.
    *   Application: Apply once, in January-February (before flowering).
    *   Note: If **SSP** or **Sulphate of Potash** is used, additional **Sulphur** might not be required.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Young Trees:** For young, non-bearing peach trees (1-4 years old), the fertilizer doses should be significantly lower and gradually increased each year.
*   **Micronutrients:** Peach trees also require micronutrients like Zinc, Boron, Iron, and Manganese. A soil test will indicate if these are deficient, and foliar sprays or soil application of specific micronutrient fertilizers may be recommended.
*   **Water Management:** Efficient irrigation is crucial for nutrient uptake. Ensure proper soil moisture after fertilizer application.
