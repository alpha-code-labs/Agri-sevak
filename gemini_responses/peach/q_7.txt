As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling diseases in Peach:

### Control of Dieback and Twig Blight in Peach

Dieback and Twig Blight are common issues in peach, often caused by various fungal pathogens (e.g., *Botryosphaeria* spp., *Phomopsis* spp., *Cytospora* spp., *Monilinia fructicola*) or environmental stress. Effective management involves a combination of cultural practices and timely chemical interventions.

**I. Cultural Practices:**

1.  **Pruning:** Regularly inspect trees and promptly prune out all affected branches and twigs. Make cuts well into healthy wood, ensuring no diseased tissue remains.
2.  **Sanitation:** Collect and destroy all pruned material (burn or bury) to prevent the spread of fungal spores.
3.  **Wound Protection:** After pruning larger branches, apply a Bordeaux paste or a fungicidal paint containing copper to protect the fresh wounds from pathogen entry.
4.  **Orchard Hygiene:** Keep the orchard clean by removing fallen leaves, twigs, and mummified fruits, which can harbor pathogens.
5.  **Nutrient Management:** Ensure balanced nutrition to maintain tree vigor and reduce stress, making trees less susceptible to disease.
6.  **Irrigation:** Provide adequate and timely irrigation, avoiding water stress, especially during critical growth stages.
7.  **Air Circulation:** Maintain proper tree spacing and prune for an open canopy to improve air circulation, which helps reduce humidity and fungal growth.

**II. Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved):**

Fungicides should be applied preventively or at the first sign of disease, following label instructions for dosage and safety. Rotation of fungicides with different modes of action is crucial to prevent resistance development.

*   **Post-Pruning Application (for Dieback/Canker prevention):**
    *   Apply a copper-based fungicide immediately after pruning, especially to larger cuts.
        *   **Copper Oxychloride** @ 3 g/L of water.
*   **Foliar Applications (for active Twig Blight and Dieback management):**
    *   **Mancozeb** @ 2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Carbendazim** @ 1 g/L of water.
    *   **Thiophanate Methyl** @ 1 g/L of water.
    *   **Propiconazole** @ 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Tebuconazole** @ 0.75 ml/L of water.

**Application Schedule:**
*   Start applications during dormancy or at bud break, and continue at regular intervals (e.g., 10-15 days) during periods conducive to disease development (high humidity, rainfall).
*   Consult the specific product label for the recommended spray interval and pre-harvest interval (PHI).

### Tikka Disease in Peach

This is not known to affect Peach. Tikka disease is a common name for leaf spot diseases primarily affecting groundnut (peanut).
