As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling these pests in Peach in Haryana:

---

### Control of Ber Fly in Peach

This is not known to affect Peach. The Ber fly (*Carpomyia vesuviana*) is a highly specific pest of Ber (*Ziziphus mauritiana*) and does not infest Peach.

### Control of Fruit Fly in Peach

Fruit flies, primarily the Oriental fruit fly (*Bactrocera dorsalis*), are a significant pest of Peach in Haryana. Effective management requires an integrated approach.

**Integrated Management Strategies for Fruit Fly:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Orchard Sanitation:** Regularly collect and destroy all fallen and infested fruits by burying them deep (at least 60 cm) or burning them. This breaks the life cycle of the pest.
    *   **Deep Ploughing:** Ploughing the soil under the trees during winter can expose and destroy pupae in the soil.
    *   **Timely Harvesting:** Harvest fruits as soon as they mature to prevent over-ripening on the tree, which attracts fruit flies.

2.  **Monitoring and Mass Trapping:**
    *   **Methyl Eugenol Traps:** Install pheromone traps containing methyl eugenol (a male attractant) at a density of 10-15 traps per acre, starting from fruit set until harvest. These traps help in monitoring the pest population and also in mass trapping of male flies, reducing the breeding potential. Replace the lure every 2-3 weeks.

3.  **Chemical Control (Bait Sprays):**
    *   Chemical control should be initiated at the stage of fruit colour change or ripening. Bait sprays are highly effective as they target the adult flies and minimize residue on the fruit.
    *   Prepare a bait solution by mixing an insecticide with a protein source (like jaggery or sugar) to attract the flies. Apply this solution as spot sprays on the tree trunks or non-bearing branches, not directly on the fruits.
    *   Recommended CIBRC approved insecticides for bait sprays:
        *   **Malathion 50% EC**: Mix 2 ml of **Malathion 50% EC** with 10 g of jaggery or sugar per litre of water.
        *   **Spinosad 45% SC**: Mix 0.25 ml of **Spinosad 45% SC** with 10 g of jaggery or sugar per litre of water.
    *   Apply these bait sprays at weekly intervals, especially during the peak fruiting period.
    *   Always follow the label instructions for pre-harvest interval (PHI) to ensure fruit safety.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Start control measures early, as soon as fruit ripening begins.
*   A combination of these methods provides the most effective control.
*   Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) when handling pesticides.
