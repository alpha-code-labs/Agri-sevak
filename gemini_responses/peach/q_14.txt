As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling soil pests like termites and root-knot nematodes in peach orchards in Haryana.

It is crucial to adopt an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods for sustainable control.

### Control of Termites (Subterranean Termites) in Peach

Termites can cause significant damage to the root system and collar region of peach trees, especially young saplings, leading to wilting, poor growth, and even tree mortality.

**1. Preventive Measures (Pre-planting):**
*   **Site Preparation:** Clear the land of all woody debris, stumps, and roots before planting, as these can be sources of termite infestation.
*   **Soil Treatment:**
    *   Before planting, treat the entire field or planting pits with an approved termiticide.
    *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC:** Apply 2.5 litres per acre, mixed with 200-400 litres of water, and drench the soil thoroughly.

**2. Curative Measures (Post-planting for existing trees):**
*   **Drenching:** If termite activity is observed (mud channels on the trunk, wilting trees without apparent cause), drench the soil around the base of the affected trees.
    *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC:** Mix 5 ml per litre of water. Drench 2-5 litres of this solution around the base of each tree, ensuring it penetrates the root zone.
    *   **Fipronil 5% SC:** Mix 2 ml per litre of water. Drench 2-5 litres of this solution around the base of each tree.

### Control of Nematodes (Root-knot Nematodes - *Meloidogyne* spp.) in Peach

Root-knot nematodes are microscopic roundworms that infect peach roots, causing characteristic galls or swellings. These galls impair the roots' ability to absorb water and nutrients, leading to stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, reduced fruit yield, and increased susceptibility to other diseases. Peach is highly susceptible to root-knot nematodes.

**1. Cultural and Biological Control (Preventive and Management):**
*   **Resistant Rootstocks:** Where available and suitable for Haryana's climate, planting peach trees grafted on nematode-resistant rootstocks (e.g., Nemaguard, Guardian) is the most effective long-term solution.
*   **Soil Solarization:** In fallow land or before planting, cover moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets during the hot summer months (May-June) for 4-6 weeks. This raises soil temperature sufficiently to kill nematodes and other soil-borne pathogens.
*   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporate well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost at 10-15 tonnes per acre. Neem cake (200-400 kg per acre) can also be highly effective as it releases nematicidal compounds. These amendments also promote beneficial soil microbes that antagonize nematodes.
*   **Biological Nematicides:**
    *   **Purpureocillium lilacinum (formerly Paecilomyces lilacinus) (1x10^8 CFU/g):** Apply 2.5-5 kg per acre, mixed with 100 kg of FYM or compost, and apply around the root zone of trees, followed by light irrigation.

**2. Chemical Control (Post-planting for existing trees):**
*   **Soil Application (Granular Nematicides):** These are applied around the tree's drip line and lightly incorporated into the soil, followed by irrigation.
    *   **Carbofuran 3% G:** Apply 50-100 g per tree.
    *   **Phorate 10% G:** Apply 25-50 g per tree.
    *   **Fluensulfone 2% GR:** Apply 50-100 g per tree.
*   **Soil Drench (Liquid Nematicides):**
    *   **Oxamyl 24% SL:** Mix 2-4 ml per litre of water. Drench 5-10 litres of this solution per tree around the root zone.

**Important Considerations and Precautions:**

*   **Soil Testing:** Before implementing any control measures, it is highly recommended to get your soil tested for the presence and population density of nematodes. This helps in confirming the problem and choosing the most appropriate control strategy.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (gloves, mask, eye protection) while handling and applying any chemical pesticides.
*   **Dosage and Application:** Strictly follow the recommended dosages and application methods mentioned on the product label. Over-application can harm the trees and the environment, while under-application may be ineffective.
*   **Irrigation:** Ensure adequate soil moisture before and after applying granular nematicides or drenching solutions for optimal efficacy and uptake.
*   **Local Recommendations:** Always consult with local agricultural extension officers or HAU experts for the most current and specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and the latest CIBRC approvals for peach in Haryana.
