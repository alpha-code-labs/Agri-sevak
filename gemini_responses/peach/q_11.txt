Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies in Peach orchards in Haryana. These pests can cause significant damage by feeding on leaves, flowers, and developing fruits, leading to reduced yield and quality.

Effective management requires an integrated approach combining cultural practices and timely application of appropriate insecticides.

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Practices:**

*   **Orchard Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy fallen fruits, leaves, and pruned branches, as these can harbor pests.
*   **Pruning:** Prune trees to improve air circulation and sunlight penetration, which can reduce pest incidence. Remove any visibly infested branches, especially for bark beetles.
*   **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your peach trees for signs of pest activity, such as chewed leaves, damaged fruits, or adult insects. Early detection is key for effective control.
*   **Hand-picking:** For larger beetles, hand-picking and destroying them can be effective in small orchards, especially during early morning or late evening.

**2. Chemical Control:**

When pest incidence is high and cultural methods are insufficient, chemical control may be necessary. Always ensure thorough coverage of the foliage and fruits. Apply insecticides during the cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.

Here are some CIBRC approved technical chemical names and their recommended dosages for controlling Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies in Peach:

*   **For general chewing pests (Beetles, Weevils, Sawfly larvae):**
    *   **Malathion 50 EC:** Apply at a concentration of 1.5 - 2.0 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Carbaryl 50 WP:** Apply at a concentration of 2.0 - 4.0 g per litre of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5 EC:** Apply at a concentration of 0.5 - 1.0 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5 SC:** Apply at a concentration of 0.2 - 0.4 ml per litre of water. This is particularly effective against larvae of sawflies and some beetles.
    *   **Spinosad 45 SC:** Apply at a concentration of 0.2 - 0.3 ml per litre of water. This is effective against sawfly larvae and some beetle species.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Timing of Application:**
    *   For sawflies, apply insecticides at petal fall or when young fruits are visible, as larvae bore into developing fruits.
    *   For beetles and weevils, apply when adults are observed feeding on foliage or fruits. Repeat applications may be necessary based on pest pressure and the insecticide's residual activity.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always strictly adhere to the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) mentioned on the insecticide label to ensure the safety of the harvested fruit.
*   **Rotation of Chemicals:** To prevent the development of pesticide resistance, rotate insecticides with different modes of action.
*   **Safety Precautions:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, and protective clothing while handling and applying pesticides.
*   **Consult Local Experts:** For precise recommendations tailored to your specific orchard conditions and the exact pest species identified, it is always advisable to consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts.

By implementing these measures, you can effectively manage Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies and protect your peach crop.
