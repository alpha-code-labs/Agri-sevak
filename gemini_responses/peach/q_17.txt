As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following doses of organic manures for Peach cultivation in Haryana, based on scientific verification:

The application of organic manures is crucial for improving soil health, nutrient availability, and overall tree vigor and productivity in peach orchards. The doses vary depending on the age of the tree.

*   **Farmyard Manure (FYM):**
    *   **Young Trees (1-3 years):** Apply **10-20 kg** of well-decomposed FYM per tree annually, increasing the dose with age.
    *   **Bearing Trees (4 years and above):** Apply **50-75 kg** of well-decomposed FYM per tree annually.
    *   *Application:* FYM should be incorporated into the soil around the tree basin, preferably in two splits – one before flowering (e.g., January-February) and another after fruit harvest (e.g., May-June).

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   **Young Trees (1-3 years):** Apply **5-10 kg** of vermicompost per tree annually, increasing the dose with age.
    *   **Bearing Trees (4 years and above):** Apply **20-30 kg** of vermicompost per tree annually.
    *   *Application:* Similar to FYM, vermicompost should be incorporated into the soil around the tree basin, ideally in two splits.

*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract based bio-stimulant):**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Mix **2.5-3 ml** of Sagarika liquid per litre of water and spray uniformly on the foliage.
        *   *Application:* Apply 2-3 sprays during the active growth period, typically at pre-flowering, fruit set, and fruit development stages.
    *   **Soil Application (Granular):** Apply **8-10 kg** per acre or **50-100 g** per tree for mature trees.
        *   *Application:* Granular forms can be broadcasted around the tree basin and lightly incorporated into the soil, usually once or twice a year during active growth phases.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always ensure the FYM and vermicompost are well-decomposed to avoid pest issues and nutrient immobilization.
*   The exact doses can be adjusted based on soil test reports and the specific vigor and yield of the trees.
*   Ensure proper irrigation after applying soil-based organic manures to help with nutrient release and uptake.
