As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I must emphasize that there is no direct chemical cure for viral diseases in plants once they are infected. Management strategies primarily focus on prevention, control of vectors, and removal of infected plants.

Let's address the specific conditions mentioned:

*   **Tristeza:** This is not known to affect Peach. Citrus Tristeza Virus (CTV) is specific to citrus species.

For the other viral diseases and symptoms listed (Leaf curl, Mosaic, Yellow vein clearing, Stripe, and Stunt virus), which can be caused by various viruses like Peach Mosaic Virus (PMV), Plum Pox Virus (PPV - Sharka disease), Peach Latent Mosaic Viroid (PLMVd), or other latent viruses, the control measures are integrated and focus on preventing their spread. Please note that "Peach Leaf Curl" is primarily a fungal disease (*Taphrina deformans*), but viral infections can also cause leaf curling symptoms.

Here's a comprehensive approach to manage viral diseases in Peach:

1.  **Use of Certified Virus-Free Planting Material:**
    *   Always procure nursery plants, rootstocks, and scion wood from certified sources known to be free from viral infections. This is the most critical preventive measure.

2.  **Roguing of Infected Plants:**
    *   Regularly inspect your orchard for plants showing symptoms like mosaic patterns, leaf curling, yellowing, vein clearing, stunting, or fruit deformities.
    *   Promptly remove and destroy (burn or bury deep) any infected trees to prevent the spread of the virus to healthy plants.

3.  **Vector Control:**
    *   Many peach viruses are transmitted by insect vectors such as aphids (e.g., for Plum Pox Virus) or mites (e.g., for Peach Mosaic Virus). Controlling these vectors is crucial.
    *   **For Aphid Control:**
        *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: 0.5-0.7 ml/L of water.
        *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: 0.2-0.3 g/L of water.
        *   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP: 0.2-0.3 g/L of water.
        *   **Flonicamid** 50% WG: 0.3 g/L of water.
        *   **Spirotetramat** 150 OD: 0.75 ml/L of water.
    *   **For Mite Control (e.g., Eriophyid mites transmitting PMV):**
        *   **Spiromesifen** 22.9% SC: 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Fenpyroximate** 5% SC: 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Propargite** 57% EC: 1.0-1.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Abamectin** 1.9% EC: 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Sulphur** 80% WP: 2.0-3.0 g/L of water (also helps with fungal diseases).
    *   Apply insecticides/acaricides as per label instructions, especially during periods of high vector activity.

4.  **Weed Management:**
    *   Control weeds in and around the orchard, as many weeds can act as alternate hosts for viruses and their insect vectors.

5.  **Sanitation of Tools:**
    *   Viruses like Peach Latent Mosaic Viroid (PLMVd) can be transmitted mechanically through pruning tools.
    *   Disinfect pruning shears, knives, and other tools with a 10% bleach solution or 70% alcohol solution between trees, especially when working with potentially infected plants.

6.  **Resistant Varieties:**
    *   If available and suitable for your region, choose peach varieties known to have resistance or tolerance to specific viral diseases prevalent in Haryana. Consult with HAU experts for recommended varieties.

By implementing these integrated management practices, you can significantly reduce the incidence and spread of viral diseases in your peach orchard.
