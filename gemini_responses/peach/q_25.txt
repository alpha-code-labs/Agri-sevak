As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for irrigation management in peach (Prunus persica) orchards in Haryana. Effective irrigation is crucial for optimal growth, yield, and fruit quality, especially given our region's climate.

**General Principles for Peach Irrigation:**
*   **Critical Stages:** Peach trees have high water requirements during key physiological stages: bloom to pit hardening, rapid fruit enlargement, and post-harvest for bud differentiation.
*   **Soil Moisture Monitoring:** Regularly assess soil moisture using methods like the "feel and appearance" method, tensiometers, or soil moisture sensors to determine precise irrigation timing and quantity.
*   **Avoid Water Stress:** Both under-irrigation (leading to fruit drop, reduced size, poor quality) and over-irrigation (leading to root rot, nutrient leaching, reduced aeration) must be strictly avoided.

**1. First Irrigation:**
*   **Timing:** For established peach trees, the first critical irrigation typically occurs **after fruit set**, usually 2-3 weeks post-bloom, when the young fruitlets begin to develop. For newly planted trees, irrigation is crucial immediately after planting and regularly thereafter until establishment.
*   **Purpose:** This irrigation supports the initial rapid cell division in the developing fruit, promotes healthy shoot growth, and helps the tree recover from the energy expenditure of flowering.
*   **Quantity:** Apply sufficient water to wet the root zone thoroughly, typically to a depth of 60-90 cm, depending on soil type. For a mature tree, this might translate to approximately 60-80 litres per tree, adjusted based on soil moisture status and prevailing weather conditions.

**2. Second Irrigation (and Subsequent Irrigations):**
*   **Timing:** The second irrigation usually follows 2-3 weeks after the first, coinciding with the **pit hardening stage** and the beginning of the rapid fruit enlargement phase. Subsequent irrigations are crucial throughout the fruit development period until harvest.
*   **Purpose:** These irrigations are vital for achieving optimal fruit size, juiciness, and overall quality. Water stress during this period can severely reduce fruit size and lead to premature fruit drop.
*   **Frequency:** During peak fruit development (typically May-June in Haryana), irrigation may be required every 7-10 days, or even more frequently in sandy soils or during extreme heat, depending on the evapotranspiration rates and soil moisture.
*   **Pre-Harvest:** Reduce irrigation frequency and quantity 7-10 days before harvest to improve fruit sugar content, firmness, and reduce the incidence of fruit cracking. However, avoid severe water stress during this period.
*   **Post-Harvest:** Continue irrigating the orchard after harvest until leaf drop. This is crucial for replenishing tree reserves, promoting root growth, and ensuring proper bud differentiation for the next season's crop.

**3. Sprinkler Use (and Drip Irrigation):**
*   **Recommendation:** For peach orchards in Haryana, **drip irrigation** or **micro-sprinkler systems** are highly recommended due to their superior water use efficiency and precision. Overhead sprinklers are generally less efficient due to higher evaporation losses and wind drift.
*   **Benefits of Drip/Micro-Sprinklers:**
    *   **Water Conservation:** Significantly reduces water consumption compared to flood irrigation, making it ideal for water-scarce regions.
    *   **Targeted Application:** Delivers water directly to the root zone, minimizing water loss to evaporation and weed growth between rows.
    *   **Uniform Distribution:** Ensures consistent water availability to all trees.
    *   **Fertigation:** Allows for efficient application of water-soluble fertilizers directly to the root zone, improving nutrient uptake.
    *   **Reduced Disease Incidence:** Keeps foliage dry, potentially reducing the incidence of certain foliar diseases.
*   **Management:**
    *   Ensure proper system design and installation to achieve uniform water distribution.
    *   Regularly check emitters/sprinklers for clogging and damage.
    *   Adjust irrigation schedules based on tree age, growth stage, soil type, and prevailing weather conditions (temperature, humidity, wind speed).
