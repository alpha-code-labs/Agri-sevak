Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing these conditions in Peach orchards in Haryana.

Here's how to control the mentioned pests:

### 1. Grasshopper

Grasshoppers are generalist feeders and can cause significant damage to peach foliage, especially on young trees or new growth.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Keep the area around peach trees free of tall weeds and grasses, which serve as breeding grounds and shelter for grasshoppers.
    *   For small infestations, hand-picking and destroying grasshoppers can be effective, especially in the early morning when they are less active.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   For larger infestations, consider spraying with CIBRC approved insecticides:
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5 EC**: Apply at a concentration of 0.5 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Fipronil 5 SC**: Apply at a concentration of 1.5-2 ml per litre of water.

### 2. Painted bug (Bagrada hilaris)

This is not known to affect Peach. Painted bug is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., mustard, cabbage, radish).

### 3. Red cotton bug (Dysdercus cingulatus)

This is not known to affect Peach. Red cotton bug is primarily a pest of cotton and other malvaceous plants.

### 4. Black Ants

Black ants are often secondary pests in peach orchards. They are typically attracted to the honeydew secreted by other primary pests like aphids, mealybugs, or scale insects. They can also protect these honeydew-producing pests from their natural enemies, thus exacerbating the primary pest problem.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Identify and Control Primary Pests:**
    *   The most effective way to manage ants is to identify and control the primary honeydew-producing pests (aphids, mealybugs, scale insects) that attract them. Once these primary pests are controlled, the ants will naturally disappear due to lack of food source.
*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Apply sticky bands around the trunk of the peach tree to prevent ants from climbing up to access honeydew-producing pests.
*   **Chemical Control (if ants are a direct nuisance or farming other pests):**
    *   **Ant Baits:** Use CIBRC approved ant baits containing active ingredients like **Fipronil 0.01% bait**. Place these baits around the base of the tree or along ant trails. Ants will carry the bait back to their colony, effectively controlling the nest.
    *   **Spot Treatment:** For direct control of ant trails or nests near the tree, you can use:
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5 EC**: Apply at a concentration of 0.5 ml per litre of water, directly on ant trails or nests.

Always ensure to read and follow the instructions on the insecticide label for proper dosage, application method, and safety precautions, including pre-harvest intervals.
