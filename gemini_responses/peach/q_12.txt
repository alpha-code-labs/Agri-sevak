As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified strategies for controlling Scale insects and Mealybugs in Peach orchards in Haryana.

Both Scale insects and Mealybugs are sap-sucking pests that can cause significant damage to peach trees, leading to reduced vigour, poor fruit quality, and even branch dieback if left unchecked. An Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural practices, monitoring, and judicious use of CIBRC-approved chemical interventions, is crucial.

### General Management Principles:
*   **Regular Monitoring:** Inspect trees regularly, especially the undersides of leaves, twigs, and fruit, for early detection of pests.
*   **Pruning:** Remove heavily infested branches during dormancy to reduce pest populations. Ensure proper disposal of pruned material.
*   **Ant Control:** Control ants, as they often protect mealybugs and scales for their honeydew.
*   **Thorough Coverage:** Ensure complete spray coverage, especially reaching hidden areas where these pests reside.
*   **Rotate Chemicals:** To prevent resistance development, rotate insecticides with different modes of action.
*   **Follow PHI:** Always observe the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) mentioned on the insecticide label to ensure fruit safety.

### Control of Scale Insects in Peach:

Scale insects are often protected by a waxy or hard shell, making them challenging to control. Timing of application is critical.

1.  **Dormant Stage (Winter):**
    *   Apply a dormant oil spray when trees are leafless to smother overwintering scales and eggs.
        *   **Horticultural Mineral Oil (HMO)**: 20-30 ml/L of water.

2.  **Growing Season (Post-bloom, if infestation persists or new infestation occurs):**
    *   Target the crawler stage (newly hatched nymphs) as they are most vulnerable.
    *   **Buprofezin** 25% SC: 1.25 ml/L of water. (Targets nymphs by inhibiting chitin synthesis)
    *   **Spirotetramat** 150 OD: 0.75 ml/L of water. (Systemic, moves both xylem and phloem, effective against hidden scales)
    *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: 0.2 g/L of water. (Systemic, effective against sucking pests)

### Control of Mealybugs in Peach:

Mealybugs are soft-bodied, covered in a white, waxy secretion, and often found in protected areas.

1.  **Early Detection and Spot Treatment:**
    *   For small infestations, remove manually or spray with a strong jet of water.
    *   **Neem Oil (Azadirachtin)** 1500 ppm: 5 ml/L of water. (Acts as an antifeedant and insect growth regulator, effective against early stages).

2.  **Chemical Control (if infestation is widespread):**
    *   **Buprofezin** 25% SC: 1.25 ml/L of water. (Effective against mealybug nymphs)
    *   **Spirotetramat** 150 OD: 0.75 ml/L of water. (Systemic, effective against mealybugs hidden in crevices)
    *   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP: 0.2 g/L of water. (Systemic, effective against sucking pests)
    *   **Flupyradifurone** 200 SL: 0.5 ml/L of water. (Systemic, effective against sucking pests)

### Important Considerations:
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label for specific dosage, application methods, safety precautions, and Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI).
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and application.
*   Consult with your local HAU extension specialist for specific recommendations tailored to your orchard's conditions and current pest pressure.
