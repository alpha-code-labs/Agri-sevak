Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I understand your concern regarding wilt in peach orchards. "Wilt" is a broad term and can be caused by various factors, including fungal pathogens, bacterial pathogens, or physiological stress (often referred to as Parawilt). Effective control requires accurate identification of the underlying cause and an integrated management approach.

Here's how to control wilt in peach:

**I. General Management Principles (Integrated Approach):**

1.  **Accurate Diagnosis:** The first step is to determine the specific cause of wilting. Observe symptoms (e.g., sudden wilting, gradual yellowing, vascular discoloration), inspect roots, and if possible, get a laboratory diagnosis.
2.  **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy severely infected plants to prevent the spread of pathogens. Disinfect tools after working with infected plants.
3.  **Resistant Rootstocks:** Where available and suitable for your region, planting peach trees grafted on wilt-resistant rootstocks is a highly effective long-term strategy.
4.  **Soil Health Management:** Improve soil drainage, aeration, and organic matter content. Compacted or waterlogged soils stress roots and make plants more susceptible to wilt pathogens.
5.  **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced fertilizers. Excessive nitrogen can promote lush growth that is more susceptible to some diseases, while nutrient deficiencies can weaken the plant.
6.  **Avoid Root Injury:** Be careful during cultivation or other orchard operations to avoid damaging roots, as these injuries can provide entry points for pathogens.

**II. Specific Control Measures:**

**A. Fungal Wilts (e.g., Verticillium Wilt, Fusarium Wilt):**
These are caused by soil-borne fungi that invade the vascular system of the plant.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Soil Solarization:** In areas with high temperatures, covering the soil with clear plastic sheets during hot months can help reduce soil-borne pathogen populations before planting.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting peaches or other susceptible crops (like cotton, brinjal, tomato) in fields previously affected by these wilts for several years.
    *   **Proper Irrigation:** Avoid over-irrigation, which can create anaerobic conditions favorable for some fungi.
    *   **Pruning:** Remove dead or dying branches to improve plant vigor.

*   **Chemical Control (for prevention or early stage management as a drench):**
    *   **For soil drench around affected plants or as a pre-plant root dip:**
        *   **Carbendazim 50% WP:** Apply at 1-2 g/L of water. Drench the soil around the base of the plant, ensuring the solution reaches the root zone. Repeat if necessary, following label instructions.
        *   **Thiophanate-methyl 70% WP:** Apply at 1-1.5 g/L of water as a soil drench.

**B. Bacterial Wilt (e.g., caused by *Ralstonia solanacearum*):**
This is a serious disease with limited chemical control options once established.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Resistant Rootstocks:** This is the most effective long-term solution.
    *   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plants immediately.
    *   **Avoid Contaminated Soil/Water:** Do not use soil or water from infected areas.
    *   **Avoid Root Injury:** Prevent any damage to roots during cultivation.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate with non-host crops for at least 3-5 years.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Effective chemical control for bacterial wilt in established peach trees is very limited. Focus heavily on cultural and preventative measures.

**C. Parawilt:**
Parawilt is often a physiological condition, not caused by a specific pathogen, but rather by sudden environmental stress, often related to water imbalance or root damage. It can manifest as a sudden collapse of the tree.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Consistent Irrigation:** Ensure adequate and consistent water supply, especially during hot, dry periods. Avoid both drought stress and waterlogging.
    *   **Mulching:** Apply organic mulch around the base of the trees to conserve soil moisture, regulate soil temperature, and reduce weed competition.
    *   **Avoid Root Disturbance:** Be extremely careful during any operations near the root zone to prevent damage.
    *   **Improve Soil Organic Matter:** Incorporating well-rotted farmyard manure or compost improves soil structure, water retention, and overall root health.
    *   **Shade Management:** In very young trees or during extreme heat, temporary shading might help reduce stress.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   There are no specific chemical treatments for Parawilt, as it is a physiological response to stress. Management focuses entirely on alleviating the environmental stressors.

For any specific concerns or severe outbreaks, please collect samples and consult with the plant pathology department at HAU, Hisar, for a precise diagnosis and tailored recommendations.
