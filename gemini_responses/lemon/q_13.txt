As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling these pests in Lemon cultivation in Haryana.

### Control of Ber Fly in Lemon

This is not known to affect Lemon. The Ber fly (*Carpomyia vesuviana*) is a highly host-specific pest primarily affecting Ber (*Ziziphus mauritiana*) fruits.

### Control of Fruit Fly in Lemon

Fruit flies, particularly species like *Bactrocera dorsalis* and *Bactrocera zonata*, are significant pests of citrus, including Lemon, in Haryana. Effective management requires an integrated approach:

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Orchard Sanitation:** Regularly collect and destroy all fallen and infested fruits by burying them deep in the soil (at least 60 cm) or immersing them in hot water. This breaks the life cycle of the pest.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** After harvest, deep ploughing around the trees can expose pupae in the soil to predators and adverse weather conditions, reducing the next generation's population.

**2. Mechanical/Physical Methods:**
*   **Pheromone Traps:** Install methyl eugenol-based pheromone traps at a density of 10-15 traps per acre, starting from fruit set. These traps attract and kill male fruit flies, disrupting mating. Replace the lure every 2-3 weeks.
*   **Protein Bait Traps:** Use protein hydrolysate-based bait traps. These attract both male and female fruit flies.

**3. Chemical Control (as part of an IPM strategy, when pest incidence is high):**
*   **Bait Sprays:** This is a highly effective and targeted method. Prepare a bait solution and apply it as spot sprays on the foliage (not on the fruits) of a few branches per tree, preferably in the morning.
    *   Mix 100 g of jaggery or sugar with 2 ml of **Malathion** 50% EC in 1 liter of water. Apply this mixture as spot sprays on 5-6 leaves per tree, covering about 10% of the canopy. Repeat every 7-10 days if needed.
*   **Foliar Sprays (if bait sprays are insufficient and pest pressure is very high):**
    *   **Deltamethrin** 2.8% EC at 0.5-1 ml per liter of water.
    *   **Cypermethrin** 25% EC at 0.5 ml per liter of water.
    *   **Spinosad** 45% SC at 0.16 ml per liter of water (ensure it is approved for fruit fly in citrus in your specific region, as approvals can vary).

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always follow the recommended dosage and waiting period before harvest.
*   Ensure thorough coverage when applying sprays.
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer for the most current and specific recommendations for your area in Haryana.
