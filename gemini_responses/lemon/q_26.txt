As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified information on specialized practices for Lemon cultivation in Haryana:

### Specialized Practices in Lemon Cultivation

**1. Pruning**

Pruning is essential for shaping the tree, maintaining its health, and optimizing fruit production.

*   **Training Pruning (Initial Shaping):**
    *   In young plants, remove shoots below 60-75 cm from the ground level to establish a strong main stem.
    *   Allow 3-5 well-spaced primary branches to form a strong framework.
    *   Remove any crossing or weak branches.
*   **Maintenance Pruning (Annual):**
    *   **Timing:** Best done after the main harvest, typically in late winter (January-February) before the new flush of growth begins.
    *   **Objective:** Remove dead, diseased, damaged, or weak branches.
    *   Thin out overcrowded branches to improve air circulation and light penetration into the canopy, which is crucial for fruit development and disease prevention.
    *   Remove water sprouts (vigorous, upright shoots) and suckers arising from the main branches or trunk.
    *   Light pruning is generally preferred for lemons, as heavy pruning can reduce yield.

**2. Desuckering**

Desuckering involves the removal of unwanted shoots (suckers) that arise from the rootstock or below the graft union.

*   **Importance:** Suckers are vigorous and unproductive, competing with the main scion for water and nutrients, thereby reducing the tree's vigor and fruit yield.
*   **Identification:** Suckers typically have different leaf characteristics (shape, size, thorniness) compared to the scion variety. They often grow rapidly from the base of the trunk or below the graft union.
*   **Method:** Remove suckers as soon as they appear by cutting them cleanly and flush with the trunk or rootstock. Regular monitoring is required, especially in young trees.

**3. Mulching**

Mulching is a highly beneficial practice for lemon orchards in Haryana, especially given the climatic conditions.

*   **Purpose:**
    *   **Moisture Conservation:** Reduces evaporation from the soil surface, conserving precious irrigation water.
    *   **Weed Suppression:** Forms a physical barrier that inhibits weed growth, reducing competition for nutrients and water.
    *   **Soil Temperature Regulation:** Keeps the soil cooler in summer and warmer in winter, protecting roots from extreme temperatures.
    *   **Soil Health Improvement:** Organic mulches decompose over time, adding organic matter and nutrients to the soil, improving soil structure and microbial activity.
    *   **Erosion Control:** Protects the soil surface from the impact of rain and wind.
*   **Materials:**
    *   **Organic Mulches:** Straw, dry leaves, crop residues (e.g., wheat straw, paddy straw), wood chips, compost, farmyard manure.
    *   **Inorganic Mulches:** Black plastic mulch can also be used, particularly in young orchards, for effective weed control and moisture retention.
*   **Application:** Apply a layer of mulch 10-15 cm thick around the base of the tree, extending to the drip line. Ensure to keep a small gap (5-10 cm) around the trunk to prevent collar rot and pest issues.
*   **Timing:** Best applied before the onset of summer or after the monsoon.

**4. Grafting**

Grafting is the primary method for propagating commercial lemon varieties, ensuring genetic purity and combining desirable traits of scion and rootstock.

*   **Purpose:**
    *   To propagate desired lemon varieties that produce high-quality fruit and yield.
    *   To impart desirable characteristics from the rootstock, such as disease resistance (e.g., to gummosis, Phytophthora root rot), drought tolerance, salinity tolerance, nematode resistance, and vigor control.
*   **Common Methods:**
    *   **T-budding (Shield Budding):** This is the most common and successful method for citrus. A single bud from the desired scion variety is inserted under the bark of the rootstock in a 'T' shaped incision.
    *   **Wedge Grafting/Cleft Grafting:** Used for grafting thicker scions onto thicker rootstocks, often for top-working older trees.
*   **Rootstocks for Haryana:**
    *   **Rough Lemon (Jambhiri):** Widely used due to its vigor, drought tolerance, and good compatibility with most lemon varieties.
    *   **Rangpur Lime:** Offers good vigor and tolerance to various soil conditions.
    *   **Karna Khatta:** Another suitable rootstock providing vigor and tolerance.
*   **Timing:** Budding is typically performed when the sap is flowing freely, allowing the bark to lift easily. This usually occurs during spring (February-March) or late summer/early autumn (August-September).
*   **Post-Grafting Care:** Ensure proper wrapping with budding tape to prevent desiccation and infection. Remove the tape once the bud has taken and started to grow.

**5. Pollination**

Understanding the pollination requirements of lemon is crucial for fruit set.

*   **Self-Fertility:** Most commercial lemon varieties (e.g., Eureka, Lisbon, Pant Lemon-1, Assam Lemon) are **self-fertile**. This means they can produce viable pollen and ovules on the same flower and do not require pollen from another variety for fruit set.
*   **Pollinators:** While lemons are self-fertile, the presence of insect pollinators (like honeybees) can sometimes enhance fruit set and yield, especially in varieties that may benefit from cross-pollination or improved pollen transfer. However, it is generally not a limiting factor for lemon production.
*   **Parthenocarpy:** Some lemon varieties can exhibit parthenocarpy, meaning they can produce fruit without fertilization, resulting in seedless or nearly seedless fruit.
*   **Conclusion for Haryana:** For most lemon varieties grown in Haryana, specific measures for cross-pollination are generally not required, as they are inherently self-fertile. Natural wind and insect activity are usually sufficient for adequate fruit set.
