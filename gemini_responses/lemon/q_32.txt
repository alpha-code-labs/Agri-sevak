Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

The symptom of "drying up" in Lemon, affecting branches, leaves, fruits, and flowers, is a general indication of stress or disease and requires careful observation to identify the root cause. As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I advise you to meticulously examine your plants for specific signs before applying any treatment.

Here are the common causes for such symptoms in Lemon, prevalent in Haryana, and their recommended management strategies:

**I. Potential Causes of Drying Up:**

1.  **Abiotic Stresses:**
    *   **Water Stress:** Both severe drought (under-watering) and waterlogging (over-watering leading to root rot) can cause wilting and drying.
    *   **Nutrient Deficiencies/Imbalances:** Lack of essential micronutrients (e.g., Zinc, Boron, Iron) or macronutrients (e.g., Potassium) can lead to poor plant health and drying.
    *   **Salinity/Alkalinity:** High salt content or pH in soil/water can impair water and nutrient uptake, causing leaf scorch and drying.
    *   **Temperature Extremes:** Severe heat stress or frost damage can lead to drying of affected parts.

2.  **Fungal Diseases:**
    *   **Dieback (e.g., *Colletotrichum gloeosporioides*, *Diplodia natalensis*):** Characterized by drying of twigs and branches, usually starting from the tip and progressing downwards. Often associated with wounds or stress.
    *   **Gummosis/Foot Rot (*Phytophthora* species):** Affects the collar region and roots, leading to bark cracking, gum exudation, yellowing, wilting, and eventual drying of branches or the entire plant.
    *   **Wilt (e.g., *Fusarium* species):** Affects the vascular system, causing sudden wilting and drying of leaves and branches.
    *   **Root Rot (various fungi):** Damage to roots impairs water and nutrient uptake, leading to general decline and drying.

3.  **Bacterial Diseases:**
    *   **Citrus Canker (*Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri*):** Causes raised, corky lesions on leaves, twigs, and fruits. Severe infection can lead to defoliation and twig dieback.
    *   **Citrus Greening (Huanglongbing - HLB):** Caused by *Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus*, transmitted by the citrus psyllid. Symptoms include blotchy mottle on leaves, yellowing, stunted growth, premature fruit drop, and eventual decline and drying of branches. This is a very serious disease with no cure for the infected tree.

4.  **Pests:**
    *   **Trunk and Twig Borers (e.g., *Indarbela quadrinotata*):** Larvae bore into the wood, disrupting sap flow, causing drying of the affected branches. Look for boreholes and frass (excreta).
    *   **Nematodes (e.g., Citrus Nematode - *Tylenchulus semipenetrans*):** Damage roots, leading to poor nutrient and water uptake, causing general decline, yellowing, and drying symptoms.
    *   **Mites (e.g., Citrus Red Mite, Broad Mite):** Severe infestations can cause bronzing, defoliation, and overall stress leading to drying.

**II. Diagnostic Steps for Farmers:**

Before applying any treatment, carefully observe your plants for the following:
*   **Pattern of Drying:** Is it random, tip-down, from the base, or affecting specific branches?
*   **Trunk/Branch Examination:** Look for cracks, gumming, boreholes, or discolouration.
*   **Leaf Symptoms:** Check for spots, lesions, yellowing patterns (e.g., blotchy mottle for HLB), or insect presence.
*   **Root Examination:** Gently expose some roots to check for rot, galls (nematodes), or discolouration.
*   **Soil Conditions:** Assess soil moisture, drainage, and any signs of salinity.

**III. General Management Practices (Preventive and Supportive):**

*   **Proper Irrigation:** Ensure adequate, but not excessive, watering. Avoid waterlogging. Use drip irrigation for efficient water use.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Apply recommended doses of macro and micronutrients based on soil testing.
*   **Pruning:** Remove all dead, diseased, or weak branches immediately. Prune during dry weather to minimize disease spread. Disinfect pruning tools with a 1% Sodium Hypochlorite solution after each cut.
*   **Weed Control:** Keep the area around the tree free of weeds to reduce competition for nutrients and water.
*   **Orchard Hygiene:** Remove fallen leaves, fruits, and diseased plant parts from the orchard.
*   **Resistant Rootstocks:** Where possible, use rootstocks resistant to diseases like gummosis and nematodes.

**IV. Specific Management (Once the Cause is Identified):**

Based on your observations, here are the recommended treatments using CIBRC approved chemicals:

1.  **For Fungal Dieback:**
    *   Prune affected branches well below the dried portion. Apply a fungicidal paste to the cut ends.
    *   Spray the tree with:
        *   **Copper Oxychloride** 3 g/L of water
        *   OR **Carbendazim** 1 g/L of water
        *   OR **Propiconazole** 0.5 ml/L of water
    *   Repeat spray after 15-20 days if symptoms persist.

2.  **For Gummosis/Foot Rot (*Phytophthora* species):**
    *   Scrape off the infected bark and apply a paste of:
        *   **Copper Oxychloride** (50 g in 1 litre of water) to the affected trunk area.
    *   Drench the soil around the tree base with:
        *   **Fosetyl-Al** 2.5 g/L of water (5-10 litres per tree depending on size).
    *   Ensure good drainage around the tree base.

3.  **For Trunk and Twig Borers:**
    *   Locate the boreholes. Inject a solution of:
        *   **Chlorpyrifos** 2.5 ml/L of water into the boreholes using a syringe and plug the holes with mud.
    *   For severe infestations, swabbing the trunk and main branches with **Chlorpyrifos** 20 ml/L of water can be done.

4.  **For Nematodes:**
    *   Apply nematicides to the soil around the root zone:
        *   **Carbofuran 3G** at 33 kg/acre (broadcast and incorporate into the soil).
    *   Alternatively, apply organic amendments like Neem cake (2-4 kg/tree) which has nematicidal properties.

5.  **For Citrus Greening (HLB):**
    *   There is no chemical cure for the infected tree.
    *   **Remove and destroy severely infected trees** to prevent spread.
    *   **Control the vector (Citrus Psyllid)** by regular spraying:
        *   **Imidacloprid** 0.3 ml/L of water
        *   OR **Thiamethoxam** 0.2 g/L of water
    *   Rotate insecticides to prevent resistance development.

6.  **For Micronutrient Deficiencies:**
    *   Spray a mixture of micronutrients:
        *   **Zinc Sulphate** (0.5%) + **Ferrous Sulphate** (0.2%) + **Boric Acid** (0.1%) + **Manganese Sulphate** (0.2%) + **Copper Sulphate** (0.1%) + **Molybdenum** (0.01%) + **Urea** (1%) in 100 litres of water.
    *   Apply 2-3 sprays at monthly intervals during the active growth period.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read the label instructions carefully before using any chemical.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during application.
*   Avoid spraying during flowering to protect pollinators.
*   Consult with the HAU extension services or a local agricultural expert if you are unsure about the diagnosis or treatment.

By carefully observing your lemon trees and implementing these scientifically verified practices, you can effectively address the issue of drying up and ensure the health and productivity of your orchard.
