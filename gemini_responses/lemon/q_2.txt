This is not known to affect Lemon.

True rust diseases (caused by fungi belonging to the order Pucciniales), such as Black, Brown, Yellow, White, and Red rusts, are generally not known to be significant pathogens of Lemon or other citrus crops.

It is possible that symptoms resembling rust might be caused by other issues, such as:
*   **Citrus Rust Mite (Phyllocoptruta oleivora):** This mite causes a bronzing or russeting of the fruit and leaves, which can sometimes be mistaken for a fungal rust. This is a common pest in citrus.
*   **Algal Spot (Cephaleuros virescens):** This alga can cause reddish-brown, raised spots on leaves and stems, sometimes colloquially referred to as "red rust."

However, the specific fungal rust diseases mentioned in your question are not known to affect Lemon.
