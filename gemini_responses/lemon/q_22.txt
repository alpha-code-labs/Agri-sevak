As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified cultivation practices for Lemon in Haryana:

*   **Propagation Method (instead of Sowing method/pattern):**
    *   Commercial lemon cultivation in Haryana primarily relies on **vegetative propagation** rather than direct seed sowing. This ensures genetic uniformity, early fruiting, and desired horticultural traits.
    *   The most common and recommended method is **budding** (T-budding or shield budding) onto a suitable rootstock.
    *   Recommended rootstocks for Haryana conditions include Rough Lemon (Jatti Khatti), Rangpur Lime, Karna Khatta, or Troyer Citrange/Carrizo Citrange, chosen based on soil type, salinity tolerance, and disease resistance.
    *   Always procure healthy, disease-free, and true-to-type budded saplings from certified nurseries.

*   **Planting Pattern:**
    *   The **Square System** is generally recommended for planting lemon orchards. This pattern facilitates inter-cultivation operations, irrigation, and uniform light penetration.
    *   Pits of 1 meter x 1 meter x 1 meter size should be dug during May-June, allowing them to be exposed to sunlight for 15-20 days.
    *   Refill these pits with a mixture of topsoil and 20-25 kg of well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) before planting.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   Plant the budded sapling at the same depth as it was in the nursery bag or pot.
    *   Crucially, ensure that the **bud union (graft union)** remains well above the ground level (at least 15-20 cm). This practice prevents scion rooting and significantly reduces the risk of collar rot disease.
    *   After planting, gently firm the soil around the root ball and provide immediate light irrigation.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   The recommended spacing for lemon in Haryana varies slightly depending on the variety, rootstock, and soil fertility, but a common and effective practice is:
        *   **5 meters x 5 meters** (plant to plant and row to row).
        *   This spacing accommodates approximately **400 plants per hectare**.
    *   For high-density planting systems, closer spacing like 4.5 m x 4.5 m or 4 m x 4 m can be adopted, but these systems require specific training, pruning, and management regimes.

*   **Planting Material Requirement (instead of Seed dose):**
    *   As lemon is propagated vegetatively using budded saplings, there is no "seed dose" in the traditional sense for establishing a commercial orchard.
    *   Based on the recommended spacing of 5 meters x 5 meters, approximately **400 budded saplings per hectare** would be required.
