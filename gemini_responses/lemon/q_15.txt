As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Lemon orchards in Haryana:

**1. Grasshopper:**
Grasshoppers can cause significant defoliation, especially on young shoots, flowers, and developing fruits.
*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Maintain field sanitation by removing weeds and debris that can serve as breeding grounds.
    *   Deep ploughing during the off-season can expose and destroy grasshopper eggs laid in the soil.
*   **Chemical Control (Spot treatment for localized infestations):**
    *   **Malathion** 50% EC at 1.0-1.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 2.5 ml/L of water.

**2. Painted bug (Bagrada hilaris):**
This is not known to affect Lemon. Painted bug is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops like mustard, cabbage, and radish.

**3. Red cotton bug (Dysdercus cingulatus):**
This is not known to affect Lemon. Red cotton bug is primarily a pest of cotton and other malvaceous plants, feeding on developing seeds.

**4. Black ants:**
Black ants are often indirect pests, protecting honeydew-producing insects like aphids, mealybugs, and scales from their natural enemies. They can also cause direct damage by nesting at the base of trees or in the soil, potentially affecting roots.
*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Keep the orchard floor clean and free of weeds.
    *   Prune lower branches to prevent them from touching the ground, which can provide an easy access route for ants.
*   **Physical Control:**
    *   Apply sticky bands (e.g., grease bands or commercially available sticky traps) around the tree trunk at about 30-45 cm height to prevent ants from climbing up the tree.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **For ants protecting honeydew pests:**
        *   Apply a barrier spray around the base of the tree and on the trunk with **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 2.5 ml/L of water or **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **For ant nests in the soil:**
        *   Drench the ant nests directly with a solution of **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Ant baits:**
        *   Use commercially available ant baits containing active ingredients like **Fipronil** or **Hydramethylnon** placed near ant trails or nests. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions for placement and dosage.
