Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide you with the ideal transplantation guidelines for Lemon cultivation in Haryana, based on scientific recommendations.

Here are the details for ideal transplantation:

### Ideal Transplantation Time for Lemon

The most suitable periods for transplanting lemon saplings in Haryana are:

*   **Monsoon Season:** July to September. This period benefits from natural rainfall and moderate temperatures, which helps in better establishment of the saplings and reduces transplant shock.
*   **Late Winter/Early Spring:** February to March. Planting during this time allows the saplings to establish their root system before the onset of intense summer heat.

### Ideal Transplantation Distance for Lemon

The recommended spacing for lemon plants depends on the variety, rootstock, and desired orchard management practices. For standard commercial cultivation in Haryana, the following spacing is generally advised:

*   **Row to Row:** 5 meters (m)
*   **Plant to Plant:** 5 meters (m)

This spacing allows for adequate sunlight penetration, air circulation, and ease of orchard operations like pruning, spraying, and harvesting.

### Ideal Transplantation Process for Lemon

A meticulous transplantation process is crucial for the successful establishment and long-term health of lemon plants.

1.  **Pit Preparation:**
    *   Dig pits of 60 cm x 60 cm x 60 cm size at the marked locations (as per the recommended spacing).
    *   Allow the pits to remain open for 15-20 days to expose the soil to sunlight and air, which helps in killing soil-borne pests and diseases.
    *   Before planting, fill each pit with a mixture of:
        *   Topsoil (from the pit)
        *   15-20 kg of well-decomposed Farmyard Manure (FYM) or compost.
        *   500 g of Single Super Phosphate (SSP) (if soil test indicates phosphorus deficiency).
        *   100 g of **Chlorpyrifos** dust (2% or 1.5%) mixed with the soil to protect against termites, if termite infestation is a known issue in the area.
        *   Mix these components thoroughly and create a mound in the center of the pit.

2.  **Sapling Selection:**
    *   Obtain healthy, vigorous, 1-2 year old budded or grafted saplings from a certified nursery.
    *   Ensure the saplings are free from pests, diseases, and physical damage.

3.  **Planting the Sapling:**
    *   Carefully remove the sapling from its polybag or container without disturbing the root ball. If the roots are pot-bound, gently loosen them.
    *   Place the sapling in the center of the prepared pit, ensuring that the graft union (the point where the scion was joined to the rootstock) remains 15-20 cm above the ground level. This is critical to prevent scion rooting and disease entry.
    *   Backfill the pit with the remaining prepared soil mixture, gently firming the soil around the root ball to remove air pockets.
    *   Create a small basin or ring around the plant for efficient irrigation.

4.  **Post-Transplantation Care:**
    *   **Immediate Watering:** Water the newly planted sapling immediately and thoroughly to settle the soil around the roots.
    *   **Staking:** Provide a sturdy stake (e.g., bamboo stick) to support the young sapling, especially in windy areas, to prevent it from swaying and damaging the root system.
    *   **Mulching:** Apply a layer of organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves, sugarcane trash) around the base of the plant (keeping it away from the stem) to conserve soil moisture, regulate soil temperature, and suppress weed growth.
    *   **Protection:** Protect young saplings from direct scorching sun during summer and frost during winter, if necessary, using temporary shade nets or covers.
    *   **Pest and Disease Monitoring:** Regularly inspect the young plants for any signs of pests or diseases and take appropriate action as per HAU recommendations.
