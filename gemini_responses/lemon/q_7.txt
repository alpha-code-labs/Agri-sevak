As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Dieback, Twig Blight, and Tikka disease in Lemon cultivation in Haryana.

### Control of Dieback and Twig Blight in Lemon

Dieback and Twig Blight are common and often interconnected problems in citrus, including Lemon. They are typically symptoms of underlying stress factors combined with fungal infections.

**Causes and Contributing Factors:**
*   **Nutritional Deficiencies:** Lack of essential micronutrients like Zinc, Copper, Manganese, and Iron.
*   **Water Stress:** Both drought conditions and waterlogging can predispose trees.
*   **Root Damage:** Due to poor drainage, nematodes, or mechanical injury.
*   **Fungal Pathogens:** Primarily *Colletotrichum gloeosporioides* (causing anthracnose/twig blight) and *Diplodia natalensis* (causing stem-end rot/dieback).
*   **Insect Pests:** Pests that cause wounds can create entry points for pathogens.
*   **Environmental Stress:** High temperatures, salinity, or frost damage.

**Integrated Control Measures:**

**1. Cultural and Horticultural Practices:**
*   **Nutrient Management:** Conduct regular soil and leaf analysis to identify deficiencies. Apply balanced fertilizers, ensuring adequate supply of macro and micronutrients.
    *   Foliar spray of **Zinc Sulphate** (0.5%) + **Copper Sulphate** (0.2%) + **Lime** (0.5%) can correct micronutrient deficiencies and provide some fungicidal effect.
*   **Water Management:** Provide optimal irrigation. Avoid both prolonged drought and waterlogging conditions. Ensure good drainage in the orchard.
*   **Pruning:** Regularly remove all dead, diseased, and weak twigs/branches. Prune during dry weather to minimize the spread of pathogens. Disinfect pruning tools with a **Sodium Hypochlorite** solution (1%) between cuts to prevent disease transmission.
*   **Orchard Sanitation:** Remove and destroy fallen leaves, fruits, and pruned material to reduce inoculum sources.
*   **Pest Control:** Manage insect pests that cause wounds, as these can serve as entry points for fungal pathogens.

**2. Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
Fungicides should be used judiciously, often as a preventive measure or at the first sign of disease, in conjunction with cultural practices.

*   **Preventive Sprays (before monsoon and after fruit set):**
    *   Spray with **Copper Oxychloride 50% WP** at 3 g/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, spray with **Mancozeb 75% WP** at 2.5 g/L of water.
*   **Curative Sprays (if fungal infection is established):**
    *   Spray with **Carbendazim 50% WP** at 1 g/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, use a combination product like **Carbendazim 12% + Mancozeb 63% WP** at 2 g/L of water.
    *   For severe infections, systemic fungicides such as **Propiconazole 25% EC** at 0.5 ml/L of water or **Azoxystrobin 23% SC** at 0.5-1 ml/L of water can be effective.
*   **Trunk Paint:** For cankers or lesions on the main stem, prepare a paste of **Copper Oxychloride 50% WP** (50 g) in 100 ml of water and apply it to the affected areas.

### Tikka Disease

This is not known to affect Lemon. Tikka disease is a common fungal disease primarily affecting groundnut (peanut) caused by *Cercospora arachidicola* and *Cercosporidium personatum*.
