As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an integrated pest management (IPM) approach for controlling sucking pests (Aphids, Leafhopper, Whitefly, Thrips, and Psylla) in Lemon. This approach combines cultural, biological, and chemical methods to ensure sustainable and effective control.

**1. Monitoring and Scouting:**
Regularly inspect your lemon trees, especially new flushes, tender shoots, and the undersides of leaves, for the presence of these pests. Early detection is crucial for effective management.

**2. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   **Pruning:** Remove water sprouts and diseased/infested branches to reduce breeding sites and improve air circulation.
*   **Weed Management:** Keep the orchard floor free of weeds, as many weeds can serve as alternate hosts for these pests.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure balanced fertilization. Excessive nitrogen can lead to lush, tender growth that is highly attractive to sucking pests.
*   **Water Management:** Provide adequate irrigation to maintain plant vigor, as stressed plants are more susceptible to pest attacks.
*   **Physical Removal:** For small infestations, especially of aphids and whiteflies on young plants, a strong jet of water can dislodge them.

**3. Biological Control:**
Encourage natural enemies such as ladybird beetles, lacewings, hoverfly larvae, and parasitic wasps (e.g., *Encarsia* species for whiteflies, *Tamarixia radiata* for citrus psylla). Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

**4. Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved Insecticides for Haryana):**
When pest populations reach economic threshold levels, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves.

Here are some CIBRC-approved technical chemical names and their recommended dosages for foliar application:

*   **For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Psylla:**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** 0.5 - 0.75 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** 0.3 - 0.5 g per litre of water.
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** 0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water.
    *   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:** 0.75 - 1.0 ml per litre of water (highly effective against whiteflies, aphids, and mealybugs with systemic action).

*   **For Whiteflies (especially nymphs) and Mealybugs:**
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** 1.25 - 1.5 ml per litre of water (acts as an insect growth regulator, targeting nymphs).

*   **For Thrips and general sucking pests:**
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** 0.5 - 1.0 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Fipronil 5% SC:** 1.0 - 1.5 ml per litre of water.

*   **Broad-spectrum (use judiciously to conserve natural enemies):**
    *   **Dimethoate 30% EC:** 1.0 - 1.5 ml per litre of water.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Rotation:** Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in pest populations.
*   **Spray Coverage:** Ensure thorough coverage of the plant, especially the undersides of leaves where many sucking pests reside.
*   **Timing:** Apply insecticides during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   **Safety:** Always read and follow the instructions on the insecticide label, including dosage, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and safety precautions. Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).
*   **Citrus Psylla (Diaphorina citri):** This pest is a vector for Huanglongbing (HLB) or citrus greening disease, which is devastating to citrus. Therefore, its control is critical. Systemic insecticides like **Imidacloprid**, **Thiamethoxam**, and **Spirotetramat** are particularly effective against it.

For specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and current pest pressure, it is always advisable to consult with the experts at HAU, Hisar, or your local agricultural extension office.
