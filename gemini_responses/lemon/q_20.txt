Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the critical role of micronutrients in achieving optimal yield and quality in Lemon cultivation. Before applying any corrective measures, it is highly recommended to conduct a soil test and, if possible, a leaf tissue analysis to accurately diagnose the specific deficiency and its severity. Visual symptoms can be indicative, but laboratory analysis provides precise guidance.

Here's how to address common micronutrient deficiencies in Lemon:

### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Small, narrow leaves (little leaf), rosetting of terminal leaves, interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, reduced fruit size, and premature fruit drop.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Apply 0.5% solution of **Zinc Sulphate heptahydrate** (5 g/L water) or 0.3% solution of **Zinc Sulphate monohydrate** (3 g/L water) along with 0.25% (2.5 g/L water) of unslaked lime to neutralize acidity. Spray 2-3 times at 15-day intervals, especially during new flush emergence.
    *   **Soil Application:** For severe deficiencies, apply 10-25 kg of **Zinc Sulphate heptahydrate** per acre, broadcasted evenly around the tree canopy and incorporated into the soil, once every 2-3 years, based on soil test recommendations.

### 2. Iron (Fe) / Ferrous Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Pronounced interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, with veins remaining distinctly green. In severe cases, entire leaves may turn yellow or almost white, leading to stunted growth and reduced fruit set.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Apply 0.5% solution of **Ferrous Sulphate** (5 g/L water) along with 0.25% (2.5 g/L water) of unslaked lime. Alternatively, use 0.1-0.2% solution of **Fe-EDTA** (1-2 g/L water). Spray 2-3 times at 10-15 day intervals, targeting new flushes.
    *   **Soil Application:** In alkaline soils, foliar sprays are often more effective. For soil application, use **Fe-EDTA** at 50-100 g per tree, mixed with irrigation water or applied in the root zone, especially for young trees. For mature trees, higher doses may be required based on soil test.

### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Dieback of young shoots, gumming on the fruit surface, fruit cracking, hard and misshapen fruit with thick rind, internal gum pockets, and reduced seed development. Leaves may be thick and brittle.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Apply 0.1-0.2% solution of **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate) (1-2 g/L water) or **Boric Acid** (1-2 g/L water). Spray once or twice during flowering and fruit set stages.
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 4-8 kg of **Borax** per acre, broadcasted evenly around the tree canopy and incorporated into the soil, once every 2-3 years, based on soil test.

### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Dieback of growing points, young leaves distorted or stunted, marginal necrosis on young leaves, and poor root development. While blossom end rot is common in other fruits, in citrus, severe Ca deficiency can lead to reduced fruit quality and storage life.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Apply 0.5-1% solution of **Calcium Nitrate** (5-10 g/L water) or **Calcium Chloride** (5-10 g/L water). Spray during fruit development stages, 2-3 times at 15-day intervals.
    *   **Soil Application:** If soil pH is low, apply **Gypsum** (Calcium Sulphate) at 200-500 kg/acre or **Agricultural Lime** (Calcium Carbonate) as per soil test recommendations to improve soil calcium levels and pH.

### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, often starting from the leaf tip and margins, progressing inwards to form an inverted 'V' shape, leaving a green triangle at the base of the leaf. Leaves may become brittle and drop prematurely.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Apply 0.5-1% solution of **Magnesium Sulphate** (5-10 g/L water). Spray 2-3 times during the growing season, especially after fruit set.
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 20-40 kg of **Magnesium Sulphate** per acre, broadcasted evenly around the tree canopy and incorporated into the soil, once a year. If soil pH is low, **Dolomitic Lime** (Calcium Magnesium Carbonate) can be used as per soil test.

### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on young to mature leaves, often appearing as a mottled or speckled pattern, similar to iron deficiency but generally less severe. Veins remain green. Reduced fruit size and quality.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Apply 0.5% solution of **Manganese Sulphate** (5 g/L water) along with 0.25% (2.5 g/L water) of unslaked lime. Spray 2-3 times at 15-day intervals, targeting new flushes.
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 10-20 kg of **Manganese Sulphate** per acre, broadcasted evenly around the tree canopy and incorporated into the soil, once every 2-3 years, based on soil test.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Timing:** Foliar sprays are most effective when applied to young, actively growing leaves.
*   **pH:** Soil pH significantly affects micronutrient availability. Maintaining an optimal soil pH (6.0-7.0 for Lemon) is crucial.
*   **Water Quality:** Ensure good quality water for spraying.
*   **Adjuvants:** Adding a non-ionic spreader-sticker to foliar sprays can improve coverage and absorption.
*   **Integrated Approach:** Combine soil application for long-term correction with foliar sprays for quick relief of symptoms.
*   **Over-application:** Avoid over-application of micronutrients, as excesses can be toxic to plants. Always follow recommended dosages and conduct soil/leaf analysis.
