As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling weeds in Lemon orchards in Haryana. Effective weed management in lemon requires an integrated approach combining cultural, mechanical, and judicious chemical methods.

**Integrated Weed Management (IWM) Principles for Lemon:**

1.  **Regular Monitoring:** Regularly inspect the orchard for weed emergence and identify the weed species to select the most appropriate control method.
2.  **Timely Intervention:** Control weeds when they are young and actively growing for maximum efficacy, especially before they set seeds.
3.  **Preventive Measures:** Prevent the introduction of new weed seeds through farm machinery, irrigation water, or contaminated manure.

**A. Cultural and Mechanical Methods:**

These methods are crucial for sustainable weed management and should be the first line of defense.

*   **Manual Weeding/Hoeing:**
    *   Highly effective for controlling all types of weeds, especially in the tree basin where chemical application can be risky.
    *   Perform regularly, particularly during the monsoon season when weed growth is vigorous.
    *   Remove weeds before they flower and set seeds to reduce the weed seed bank in the soil.
*   **Mulching:**
    *   Apply organic mulches (e.g., straw, dry leaves, wood chips, sugarcane trash) 10-15 cm thick around the tree basin, keeping a small gap from the trunk.
    *   Mulching suppresses weed germination and growth, conserves soil moisture, moderates soil temperature, and improves soil health.
*   **Inter-row Cultivation:**
    *   Shallow cultivation (tillage) in the inter-row spaces can control young weeds.
    *   Avoid deep tillage near the tree canopy to prevent damage to the feeder roots.
*   **Cover Cropping (in inter-rows):**
    *   In young orchards, growing short-duration, non-competitive cover crops (e.g., legumes like cowpea, sunhemp) in the inter-row spaces can suppress weed growth, improve soil fertility, and prevent soil erosion. Ensure these crops do not compete with the lemon trees for resources.

**B. Chemical Control (Herbicides):**

Herbicides should be used judiciously as a supplementary tool, especially for widespread infestations or when manual labor is scarce. Always ensure directed spray to avoid contact with lemon foliage, green bark, or exposed roots.

**1. For General Broadleaf and Narrowleaf Weeds (including Bathu, Congress grass, Phalaris minor):**

*   **Post-Emergence Herbicides (for existing weeds):**
    *   **Glyphosate** (non-selective, systemic):
        *   Dosage: 1.0 - 1.5 kg a.i./acre (or 2.0 - 3.0 kg of 41% SL formulation per acre) in 200-300 L of water.
        *   Application: Apply as a directed spray to actively growing weeds (4-6 inches tall), ensuring no contact with lemon plant parts.
    *   **Paraquat dichloride** (non-selective, contact):
        *   Dosage: 0.5 - 1.0 kg a.i./acre (or 2.5 - 5.0 L of 24% SL formulation per acre) in 200-300 L of water.
        *   Application: Apply as a directed spray to actively growing weeds, ensuring no contact with lemon plant parts. Provides quick knockdown.
    *   **Glufosinate ammonium** (non-selective, contact):
        *   Dosage: 0.4 - 0.6 kg a.i./acre (or 2.0 - 3.0 L of 200 g/L SL formulation per acre) in 200-300 L of water.
        *   Application: Apply as a directed spray to actively growing weeds, ensuring no contact with lemon plant parts.

*   **Pre-Emergence Herbicides (for preventing weed germination):**
    *   **Diuron** (broad-spectrum, residual):
        *   Dosage: 1.6 - 3.2 kg a.i./acre (or 2.0 - 4.0 kg of 80% WP formulation per acre) in 200-300 L of water.
        *   Application: Apply to moist, weed-free soil after weeding or before weed emergence. Avoid application to very light soils or where tree roots are exposed.
    *   **Oxyfluorfen** (broad-spectrum, residual):
        *   Dosage: 0.2 - 0.4 kg a.i./acre (or 1.0 - 2.0 L of 23.5% EC formulation per acre) in 200-300 L of water.
        *   Application: Apply to moist, weed-free soil after weeding or before weed emergence.
    *   **Pendimethalin** (for grasses and some broadleaf weeds, residual):
        *   Dosage: 0.75 - 1.0 kg a.i./acre (or 3.0 - 4.0 L of 30% EC formulation per acre) in 200-300 L of water.
        *   Application: Apply to moist, weed-free soil after weeding or before weed emergence.

**2. For Amarbail (Cuscuta spp.):**

Amarbail is a parasitic weed that can severely damage lemon plants.

*   **Manual Removal:** This is the most effective and recommended method.
    *   Carefully remove all infested parts of the lemon plant, including the Cuscuta strands, before it flowers and sets seeds.
    *   Ensure complete removal as even small fragments can regenerate.
    *   Destroy the removed plant material by burning to prevent further spread.
*   **Pre-emergence Control:**
    *   **Pendimethalin** can offer some pre-emergence control of Cuscuta seeds in the soil if applied before germination.
        *   Dosage: 0.75 - 1.0 kg a.i./acre (or 3.0 - 4.0 L of 30% EC formulation per acre) in 200-300 L of water.
        *   Application: Apply to moist, weed-free soil where Cuscuta seeds are expected to germinate.

**3. For Orobanche (Orobanche spp.):**

This is not known to affect Lemon. Orobanche species are root parasites primarily affecting herbaceous dicotyledonous plants (e.g., mustard, tobacco, tomato, brinjal), and citrus is not a typical host.

**Important Precautions for Herbicide Application:**

*   **Safety Gear:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including gloves, mask, protective clothing, and eye protection during mixing and spraying.
*   **Directed Spray:** Use a protective hood or shield on the spray nozzle to prevent drift onto lemon foliage, flowers, fruits, or young bark.
*   **Calibration:** Ensure the sprayer is properly calibrated to apply the correct dosage.
*   **Water Quality:** Use clean water for mixing herbicides.
*   **Weather Conditions:** Apply herbicides on calm days to minimize drift. Avoid spraying during windy conditions or when rain is expected shortly after application.
*   **Storage:** Store herbicides in their original containers, in a cool, dry, locked place, away from food, feed, and out of reach of children and animals.
*   **Disposal:** Dispose of empty containers and leftover spray solution safely and responsibly as per local regulations.
*   **Consultation:** For specific local conditions or severe infestations, consult with HAU experts or your local agricultural extension officer.
