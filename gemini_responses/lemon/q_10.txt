Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing pests in Lemon orchards in Haryana.

Here's how to control the pests you've mentioned:

### 1. Borers in Lemon

Borers, particularly stem borers, can cause significant damage to Lemon trees by tunneling into the trunk and branches, leading to weakening and even death of the affected parts.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Regularly inspect trees for signs of borer activity (e.g., sawdust-like frass, gum exudation, boreholes).
    *   Prune and destroy severely infested branches to prevent further spread.
    *   Maintain tree health through proper nutrition and irrigation to enhance their natural resistance.
*   **Mechanical Control:**
    *   For visible boreholes, use a thin, flexible wire to probe and kill the larvae inside.
    *   Inject a small amount of kerosene or petrol into the boreholes and seal them with mud or wax (use with caution as it can sometimes harm the tree if overused).
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **For Stem Borers:**
        *   **Chlorpyrifos**: Apply as a drench or swab on the affected trunk and branches at a concentration of 2.5 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Imidacloprid**: Inject into boreholes or apply as a soil drench around the base of the tree at 0.5-1 ml per litre of water for systemic action.
        *   **Fipronil**: Can be used as a foliar spray for young larvae or as a soil drench for systemic action at 1.5-2 ml per litre of water.

### 2. Caterpillars in Lemon

Various caterpillar species can infest Lemon trees, feeding on leaves, flowers, and young fruits. Common defoliating caterpillars include the citrus swallowtail butterfly larvae.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Regularly monitor trees for caterpillar presence.
    *   Hand-pick and destroy caterpillars from young trees or small infestations.
*   **Biological Control:**
    *   Encourage natural enemies like parasitic wasps and predatory birds.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole**: Spray at 0.3 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Emamectin benzoate**: Spray at 0.2 g per litre of water.
    *   **Indoxacarb**: Spray at 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin**: Spray at 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Spinosad**: Spray at 0.25-0.3 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)**: A biological insecticide, spray at 1-2 g or ml per litre of water (depending on formulation).

### 3. Diamondback moth in Lemon

This is not known to affect Lemon. Diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower, mustard).

### 4. Leaf folder in Lemon

Leaf folders are lepidopteran larvae that fold or roll leaves and feed from within, causing defoliation and affecting photosynthesis.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Remove and destroy folded leaves containing larvae.
    *   Maintain orchard hygiene.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole**: Spray at 0.3 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Emamectin benzoate**: Spray at 0.2 g per litre of water.
    *   **Indoxacarb**: Spray at 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin**: Spray at 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Spinosad**: Spray at 0.25-0.3 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)**: A biological insecticide, spray at 1-2 g or ml per litre of water (depending on formulation).

**General Recommendations:**

*   Always read the label of the pesticide carefully before use for specific instructions, safety precautions, and pre-harvest intervals (PHI).
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.
*   Apply pesticides during the cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   Ensure thorough spray coverage for effective pest control.
*   For precise recommendations tailored to your specific farm conditions, it is always advisable to consult with local agricultural extension officers or HAU experts.
