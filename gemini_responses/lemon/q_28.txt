As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified strategies to protect Lemon trees from environmental stresses prevalent in Haryana:

### Protection from Extreme Cold and Frost

Extreme cold and frost can severely damage lemon trees, especially young plants.

*   **Irrigation:** Apply a light irrigation to the orchard a day or two before a predicted frost event. Moist soil retains heat better than dry soil and releases it slowly, raising the ambient temperature slightly.
*   **Covering Young Plants:** For young lemon trees (up to 3-4 years old), cover them with hessian cloth, straw, or plastic sheets during cold nights. Ensure the covers do not directly touch the foliage and are removed during the day to allow for sunlight and air circulation.
*   **Windbreaks:** Plant shelterbelts (e.g., *Casuarina*, *Eucalyptus*) on the north-western side of the orchard to protect from cold, dry winds.
*   **Smudging:** In severe frost conditions, creating smoke by burning organic matter (like crop residue or trash) on the upwind side of the orchard can help prevent radiation heat loss from the trees. This creates a smoke blanket that traps heat.
*   **Foliar Sprays:**
    *   Spray with **Potassium Nitrate** at a concentration of 10 g/L water, 2-3 days before a predicted frost. This can help improve the tree's cold hardiness.
    *   Alternatively, spray with **Monoammonium Phosphate** (MAP) at 5 g/L water to enhance cold tolerance.

### Protection from Heat/Loo (Hot Winds) and Intense Sunlight

High temperatures, hot dry winds (Loo), and intense sunlight can cause scorching, wilting, and reduced fruit set.

*   **Adequate Irrigation:** Maintain consistent and adequate soil moisture, especially during hot periods. Drip irrigation is highly recommended for efficient water use, delivering water directly to the root zone.
*   **Mulching:** Apply a thick layer (10-15 cm) of organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves, sugarcane trash, paddy straw) around the base of the trees. Mulch helps conserve soil moisture, reduces soil temperature, and suppresses weed growth.
*   **Windbreaks:** Establish windbreaks on the western and southern sides of the orchard using tall, fast-growing trees to protect lemon trees from hot, dry "Loo" winds.
*   **Shade Nets:** For young lemon trees, temporary shade nets (e.g., 30-50% shade factor) can be erected during the peak summer months to protect them from intense direct sunlight and reduce heat stress.
*   **White Washing Trunks:** Paint the main trunk and lower scaffold branches with a lime wash (calcium carbonate solution). This reflects sunlight, reduces bark temperature, and prevents sunscald.
*   **Foliar Sprays:**
    *   Spray with **Kaolin clay** (a reflective particle film) at a concentration of 50-75 g/L water. This forms a white coating on the leaves, reflecting sunlight and significantly reducing leaf temperature. Repeat the application every 15-20 days or after heavy rainfall.
    *   Spray with **Potassium Nitrate** at 10 g/L water. This can help improve the tree's water use efficiency and mitigate the effects of heat stress.
