As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I must emphasize that there is no direct chemical cure for viral diseases once a plant is infected. The primary focus for managing viral diseases in Lemon is prevention, control of vectors, and removal of infected plant material.

Regarding the specific conditions mentioned:

*   **Stripe virus:** This is not known to affect Lemon as a distinct, commonly recognized viral disease. While some viral infections might cause stripe-like symptoms, "Stripe virus" itself is not a specific named disease of Lemon.

For other viral diseases like Leaf curl (often a symptom of various issues, including viral), Mosaic, Yellow vein clearing, Tristeza, and Stunt virus (Citrus Stunt Viroid), the control strategies are primarily preventive and management-focused:

**General Control Measures for Viral Diseases in Lemon:**

1.  **Use of Certified, Virus-Free Planting Material:** This is the most critical step. Always procure budwood and rootstock from certified nurseries that guarantee virus-free material. HAU recommends using certified nurseries for all citrus plantings.
2.  **Vector Control:** Many citrus viruses, especially Citrus Tristeza Virus (CTV), are transmitted by insect vectors like aphids. Controlling these vectors is crucial to prevent the spread of the disease.
    *   **Aphid Control:**
        *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: 0.3-0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: 0.2-0.3 g/L of water.
        *   **Dimethoate** 30% EC: 1.0-1.5 ml/L of water.
        *   Apply these insecticides as foliar sprays, especially during periods of new flush growth when aphid populations are high.
3.  **Roguing and Removal of Infected Plants:** Immediately remove and destroy (burn or bury deep) any plants showing severe symptoms of viral infection. This prevents the virus from spreading to healthy plants.
4.  **Sanitation:**
    *   Disinfect pruning tools with a 10% bleach solution or 70% alcohol between cuts, especially when working on multiple trees, to prevent mechanical transmission of viruses or viroids.
    *   Avoid working in infected areas before moving to healthy ones.
5.  **Weed Management:** Control weeds in and around the orchard, as they can harbor insect vectors and sometimes even serve as alternative hosts for viruses.
6.  **Nutrient Management:** Ensure proper nutrition to maintain plant vigor, which can help plants tolerate stress better, although it does not confer resistance to viral infection.
7.  **Resistant Rootstocks/Varieties:** Where available and suitable for Haryana's conditions, planting varieties grafted on tolerant or resistant rootstocks can be a long-term strategy. For Tristeza, specific tolerant rootstocks are available.
8.  **Cross-Protection (for Tristeza):** In some regions, mild strains of CTV are deliberately introduced to protect trees from more severe strains. This is a specialized technique and should only be implemented under expert guidance.

By strictly adhering to these integrated management practices, the incidence and spread of viral diseases in your Lemon orchard can be significantly minimized.
