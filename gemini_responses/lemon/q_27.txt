As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the suitable climate, soil type, and drainage requirements for Lemon cultivation in Haryana:

### Suitable Climate for Lemon

Lemon (Citrus limon) thrives in subtropical climates, which are characteristic of much of Haryana.

*   **Temperature:**
    *   **Optimal Range:** Lemons prefer a temperature range of 15°C to 30°C for optimal growth and fruit development.
    *   **Heat Tolerance:** They can tolerate high temperatures up to 45°C, provided there is adequate soil moisture.
    *   **Cold Tolerance:** Young trees are very sensitive to frost. Mature trees can tolerate mild frost for short durations, but prolonged exposure to temperatures below 0°C can cause significant damage to leaves, twigs, and fruit. Protection against frost is crucial in areas of Haryana prone to severe winter chills.
*   **Sunlight:** Lemons require abundant sunlight, ideally 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily, for good fruit set and quality.
*   **Humidity:** Moderate humidity is generally preferred. Very high humidity can increase the incidence of fungal diseases, while very low humidity combined with high temperatures can lead to fruit drop and reduced fruit size.

### Suitable Soil Type for Lemon

The choice of soil is critical for the successful cultivation of lemons.

*   **Texture:** Lemons perform best in well-drained, deep, and fertile loamy or sandy loam soils. Heavy clay soils with poor drainage should be avoided.
*   **pH:** An ideal soil pH range for lemons is slightly acidic to neutral, specifically between 6.0 and 7.5. Soils outside this range can lead to nutrient deficiencies or toxicities.
*   **Organic Matter:** Soils rich in organic matter are highly beneficial as they improve soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability.
*   **Salinity:** Lemons are moderately sensitive to soil salinity. High levels of soluble salts in the soil or irrigation water can negatively impact growth and yield. Soil testing is recommended to assess salinity levels, especially in areas of Haryana known for saline soils.

### Drainage Requirement for Lemon

Excellent drainage is paramount for lemon trees.

*   **Waterlogging:** Lemons are extremely sensitive to waterlogging. Stagnant water around the root zone, even for short periods, can lead to root rot (e.g., *Phytophthora* species), nutrient deficiencies, and eventually tree decline or death.
*   **Internal Drainage:** The soil must have good internal drainage, allowing excess water to percolate away quickly. This means avoiding sites with hardpans or impervious layers close to the surface.
*   **Surface Drainage:** Proper surface drainage is also essential to prevent water accumulation around the tree base during heavy rainfall or irrigation. Planting on raised beds can be an effective strategy in areas with less than ideal drainage.
