Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling Scab, Canker, Gummosis, and Lichen in Lemon trees in Haryana.

It's crucial to implement an integrated disease management approach, combining cultural practices with timely and appropriate chemical applications.

### 1. Citrus Scab (caused by *Elsinoë fawcettii*)

**Symptoms:** Characterized by raised, corky, wart-like lesions on leaves, twigs, and fruit, often causing distortion and reduced fruit quality.

**Control Measures:**
*   **Cultural:** Prune and destroy infected twigs and leaves. Avoid overhead irrigation, which can spread spores.
*   **Chemical:** Apply fungicides during periods of new growth (new flushes) and at fruit set to protect susceptible tissues.
    *   **Copper Oxychloride:** Spray at 2.5-3.0 g/L water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin:** Spray at 0.5-1.0 ml/L water.
    *   **Difenoconazole:** Spray at 0.5 ml/L water.

### 2. Citrus Canker (caused by *Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri*)

**Symptoms:** Distinctive raised, corky lesions with a water-soaked margin and a characteristic yellow halo on leaves, stems, and fruit. This is a highly contagious bacterial disease.

**Control Measures:**
*   **Cultural:**
    *   Plant disease-free nursery stock from certified sources.
    *   Prune and destroy infected branches immediately. Disinfect pruning tools with a 10% bleach solution or 70% alcohol between cuts to prevent spread.
    *   Establish windbreaks (e.g., tall trees like Casuarina or Eucalyptus) around the orchard to reduce the spread of bacteria by wind-driven rain.
    *   Avoid working in orchards when foliage is wet, as this can facilitate bacterial spread.
*   **Chemical:** Regular protective sprays are essential, especially during periods of new growth and after rainfall, which are conducive to disease development.
    *   **Copper Oxychloride:** Spray at 2.5-3.0 g/L water.
    *   **Copper Hydroxide:** Spray at 2.0-2.5 g/L water.

### 3. Gummosis (Phytophthora Gummosis / Foot Rot, caused by *Phytophthora* species)

**Symptoms:** Oozing of gum from the trunk or main branches, often near the soil line. The bark may become discolored, cracked, and eventually die, leading to girdling of the tree and decline.

**Control Measures:**
*   **Cultural:**
    *   Ensure proper drainage to prevent waterlogging around the tree base, as *Phytophthora* thrives in wet conditions.
    *   Avoid injury to the trunk and root flare during cultivation or weeding.
    *   Plant trees with the bud union well above the soil line (at least 15-30 cm) to keep susceptible rootstock tissue away from soil pathogens.
    *   Remove soil from around the base of the trunk to expose the root flare for drying if symptoms appear.
    *   Scrape off infected bark from cankers, extending slightly into healthy tissue, and then apply a fungicidal paste.
*   **Chemical:**
    *   **Potassium Phosphonate:** Foliar spray at 2.5-5.0 ml/L water, or drench around the base of the tree at 5-10 ml/L water (apply 5-10 L solution per tree depending on size).
    *   **Fosetyl-aluminium:** Foliar spray at 2.5-3.0 g/L water.
    *   **Copper Oxychloride:** For trunk paint, mix 50 g of **Copper Oxychloride** with 100 g of lime in 1 litre of water and apply to the scraped trunk area or as a protective paint on the lower trunk.

### 4. Lichen

**Symptoms:** Crusty, leafy, or bushy growths on the bark of branches and trunks. Lichens are symbiotic organisms (a fungus and an alga) and are generally harmless to the tree itself, as they are not parasitic. Their presence often indicates good air quality and can be a sign of reduced tree vigor or high humidity. They do not directly cause disease but can sometimes harbor pests or block light to the bark.

**Control Measures:**
*   **Cultural:**
    *   Improve tree vigor through proper fertilization, irrigation, and pest management. A healthy, vigorous tree is less likely to have extensive lichen growth.
    *   Prune to improve air circulation and light penetration within the canopy, which can reduce humidity and discourage lichen growth.
    *   If aesthetically undesirable or if they are excessively thick, they can be gently scrubbed off with a stiff brush during dry weather.
*   **Chemical:** While not typically necessary, if control is desired, copper-based sprays can help reduce lichen populations.
    *   **Copper Oxychloride:** Spray at 2.5-3.0 g/L water during dormant periods or as a trunk wash.

Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the product label for safe and effective application, including personal protective equipment and pre-harvest intervals. For specific recommendations tailored to your farm and local conditions, it is advisable to consult with your local agricultural extension officer.
