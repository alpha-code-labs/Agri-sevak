As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following doses for organic manures in Lemon cultivation, based on scientific research and best practices for Haryana's conditions:

*   **Farmyard Manure (FYM):**
    *   **Young trees (1-3 years after planting):** Apply 10-15 kg of well-decomposed FYM per plant per year.
    *   **Bearing trees (4 years and above):** Apply 20-50 kg of well-decomposed FYM per plant per year, depending on the tree's age, size, and vigor.
    *   **Application:** FYM should be applied annually, preferably during October-November or February-March. Spread it evenly in the tree basin, avoiding direct contact with the trunk, and lightly incorporate it into the soil.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   **Young trees (1-3 years after planting):** Apply 5-7 kg of vermicompost per plant per year.
    *   **Bearing trees (4 years and above):** Apply 10-15 kg of vermicompost per plant per year.
    *   **Application:** Vermicompost can be used as a partial or full substitute for FYM. Due to its higher nutrient concentration and microbial activity, a lesser quantity is generally required compared to FYM. Apply it similarly to FYM, incorporating it into the soil around the tree.

*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract):**
    *   **Role:** Sagarika is a biostimulant derived from seaweed extract, rich in plant growth regulators, micronutrients, and amino acids. It is not a bulk manure but enhances nutrient uptake, promotes root development, improves stress tolerance, and boosts fruit quality and yield.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Mix 2-4 ml of Sagarika per litre of water. Apply as a foliar spray at critical growth stages such as pre-flowering, fruit set, and fruit development. Repeat 2-3 times during the cropping season at 20-30 day intervals.
    *   **Soil Drench/Drip Application:** For soil application, use 1-2 litres per acre, diluted in sufficient water, during active growth periods. For individual trees, 10-20 ml per plant, diluted in water, can be applied as a drench around the root zone.
