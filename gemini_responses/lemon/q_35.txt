As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding lemon maturity, harvesting, and cutting processes for Haryana.

### Maturity Signs for Lemon

Lemon is a non-climacteric fruit, meaning it does not ripen significantly after being harvested. Therefore, it is crucial to harvest at the correct stage of maturity. Key indicators include:

*   **Colour Change:** The most reliable indicator. Fruits change from a dark green to a light green, then yellowish-green, and finally a bright yellow. For fresh market consumption, lemons are often harvested when they are yellowish-green to full yellow.
*   **Size:** Fruits attain the characteristic size and shape for the specific variety being grown.
*   **Firmness:** The fruit should feel firm and plump to the touch. Avoid harvesting soft or shriveled fruits.
*   **Juice Content:** While not easily assessed in the field, mature lemons will have a high juice content. Experienced growers often develop a feel for this.
*   **Skin Texture:** The skin should appear smooth and glossy, free from blemishes.

### Harvesting Time for Lemon

Lemon trees in Haryana can produce multiple flushes of flowers and fruits throughout the year, leading to an extended harvesting period. The main harvesting times often coincide with the maturity of fruits from specific flowering flushes:

*   **Spring Flush (Ambe Bahar):** Fruits mature from May to August.
*   **Monsoon Flush (Mrig Bahar):** Fruits mature from October to January.
*   **Autumn Flush (Hasta Bahar):** Fruits mature from February to April.

Harvesting is typically done selectively, picking only the mature fruits as they reach the desired size and colour, rather than a single bulk harvest. This allows for continuous production and supply to the market.

### Cutting Process for Lemon

Proper harvesting technique is essential to prevent damage to the fruit and the tree, ensuring better post-harvest quality and shelf life.

*   **Tools:** Always use sharp, clean harvesting shears or secateurs. This ensures a clean cut and minimizes damage to the fruit and the pedicel (stem).
*   **Method:** Cut the fruit from the branch, leaving a small piece of the stem (pedicel) and the calyx attached to the fruit. A stem length of approximately 0.5 to 1 cm is ideal. This practice helps prevent stem-end rot, which can significantly reduce shelf life.
*   **Avoid Pulling/Twisting:** Never pull or twist the fruit off the branch, as this can damage the fruit's skin, create entry points for pathogens, or injure the fruiting spur on the tree.
*   **Gentle Handling:** Handle the harvested lemons gently to avoid bruising, punctures, or abrasions. Place them carefully into padded baskets or crates rather than dropping them.
*   **Timing:** Harvest during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late afternoon) to reduce field heat and maintain fruit quality.
