Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding dropping in Lemon. It's important to clarify that "Tinda/Boll dropping" refers to issues in crops like cotton or gourds (Tinda), and is not applicable to Lemon. In Lemon, we primarily deal with flower drop and fruit drop, which are common physiological issues.

Controlling flower and fruit drop in Lemon requires an integrated approach, addressing various physiological, nutritional, and environmental factors.

Here's a scientifically verified approach for Haryana conditions:

**1. Cultural and Environmental Management:**

*   **Consistent Irrigation:** Both water stress (drought) and waterlogging can lead to severe flower and fruit drop. Maintain consistent soil moisture, especially during flowering and fruit development stages. Irrigate deeply but infrequently, allowing the topsoil to dry slightly between irrigations.
*   **Mulching:** Apply organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves, sugarcane trash) around the base of the trees. This helps conserve soil moisture, regulate soil temperature, and suppress weeds, reducing competition for nutrients and water.
*   **Weed Control:** Keep the area around the trees free of weeds to minimize competition for water and nutrients.
*   **Avoid Sudden Stress:** Protect trees from sudden temperature fluctuations, strong winds, and heat stress, especially during critical reproductive stages.
*   **Proper Pruning:** Remove dead, diseased, or overcrowded branches to improve air circulation and light penetration, which can indirectly reduce stress on the tree.

**2. Nutritional Management:**

Balanced nutrition is crucial for healthy fruit set and retention. Conduct a soil test to identify specific deficiencies.

*   **Zinc (Zn):** Zinc deficiency is common in Haryana soils and severely impacts flower and fruit retention.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Apply **Zinc Sulphate** (0.5% - 1% solution) at 5-10 g/L of water, along with 0.25% (2.5 g/L) unslaked lime to prevent leaf burn. Spray at pre-flowering and post-fruit set stages.
*   **Boron (B):** Boron is essential for pollen viability and fruit development.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Apply **Boric Acid** (0.1% - 0.2% solution) at 1-2 g/L of water, or **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (0.1% - 0.15% solution) at 1-1.5 g/L of water, during pre-flowering and early fruit set.
*   **Potassium (K):** Adequate potassium improves fruit quality, size, and stress tolerance, indirectly reducing drop.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Apply **Potassium Nitrate** (1% solution) at 10 g/L of water, or **Mono Potassium Phosphate** (1% solution) at 10 g/L of water, during fruit development stages.
*   **Phosphorus (P):** Essential for energy transfer and overall plant vigor. Ensure adequate soil application based on soil test recommendations.

**3. Hormonal Management (Plant Growth Regulators):**

Plant growth regulators (PGRs) can be effectively used to reduce flower and fruit drop, especially when physiological factors are the primary cause.

*   **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA):** This synthetic auxin is highly effective in preventing premature fruit drop by strengthening the abscission layer.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Apply **Naphthalene Acetic Acid** (NAA) at a concentration of 10-20 ppm (parts per million). For a typical 4.5% SL formulation, this translates to approximately **0.2 - 0.4 ml/L** of water.
    *   **Timing:** Spray once at the full bloom stage (when most flowers have opened) and repeat 2-3 weeks later, or at the pea-size fruit stage. Avoid spraying during peak heat.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Soil Testing:** Always start with a comprehensive soil test to accurately determine nutrient deficiencies and pH, which guides precise fertilizer application. Contact HAU's soil testing lab for recommendations.
*   **Integrated Pest and Disease Management:** Severe infestations of pests (e.g., mites, thrips, mealybugs) or diseases can weaken the tree and lead to dropping. Monitor regularly and apply appropriate CIBRC-approved pesticides/fungicides if necessary, following label instructions.
*   **Variety Specifics:** Some lemon varieties are naturally more prone to dropping than others.
*   **Application Technique:** Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage when applying foliar sprays. Spray early in the morning or late in the evening to avoid high temperatures and maximize absorption.

By implementing these scientifically sound practices, you can significantly reduce flower and fruit drop in your lemon orchard and improve overall yield and quality.
