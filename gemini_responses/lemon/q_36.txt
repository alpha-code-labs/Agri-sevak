As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for improving yield, fruit quality, and storage life of Lemon in Haryana.

### **1. Improving Yield**

To maximize lemon yield, focus on optimal nutrient management, efficient water use, timely pest and disease control, and appropriate horticultural practices.

*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Balanced NPK:** Based on soil test reports, apply Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K). For mature bearing trees (5+ years), a general recommendation is 200-300 g N, 100-150 g P2O5, and 150-250 g K2O per tree per year, split into 2-3 applications (e.g., pre-flowering, fruit set, and fruit development).
    *   **Micronutrients:** Deficiencies of Zinc, Boron, Iron, and Manganese are common and severely impact flowering and fruit set.
        *   Foliar spray of **Zinc Sulphate** (0.5%, i.e., 5 g/L) + **Borax** (0.1%, i.e., 1 g/L) + **Ferrous Sulphate** (0.2%, i.e., 2 g/L) + **Manganese Sulphate** (0.2%, i.e., 2 g/L) during pre-flowering and fruit set stages. Repeat as per leaf analysis.
*   **Water Management:**
    *   **Irrigation:** Critical during flowering, fruit set, and fruit development. Drip irrigation is highly recommended for efficient water use. Maintain soil moisture at 60-70% field capacity. Avoid both water stress and waterlogging.
*   **Pruning:**
    *   **Annual Light Pruning:** Remove dead, diseased, criss-crossing, and unproductive branches. This improves light penetration and air circulation, promoting better flowering and fruit development. Skirt pruning (removing low-hanging branches) is also beneficial.
*   **Pest and Disease Management:** Timely control of major pests and diseases is crucial to prevent yield losses.
    *   **Citrus Psylla & Leaf Miner:** Spray at new flush emergence with **Imidacloprid** (0.3 ml/L) or **Thiamethoxam** (0.25 g/L).
    *   **Aphids & Mealybugs:** Spray with **Imidacloprid** (0.3 ml/L) or **Dimethoate** (1.5 ml/L).
    *   **Citrus Canker:** Prune and destroy infected twigs. Spray with **Copper Oxychloride** (3 g/L) at regular intervals, especially during new flush and after rainfall.
    *   **Gummosis:** Scrape off affected bark and apply a paste of **Copper Oxychloride** (100 g in 1 L water) to the affected trunk area.
*   **Growth Regulators:**
    *   **To improve fruit set:** Foliar spray of **Gibberellic Acid (GA3)** (10-20 ppm, i.e., 10-20 mg/L) at full bloom.
    *   **To reduce pre-harvest fruit drop:** Foliar spray of **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA)** (10-20 ppm, i.e., 10-20 mg/L) when fruits are at pea size.

### **2. Improving Fruit Quality**

High-quality fruits are characterized by good size, uniform color, high juice content, and freedom from blemishes.

*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Potassium:** Adequate K is vital for fruit size, juice content, and sugar-acid balance. Ensure sufficient K application as per soil test. Foliar spray of **Potassium Nitrate** (1%, i.e., 10 g/L) during fruit development can enhance quality.
    *   **Calcium:** Important for cell wall integrity, fruit firmness, and reducing physiological disorders. Foliar spray of **Calcium Nitrate** (0.5-1%, i.e., 5-10 g/L) during fruit growth.
    *   **Micronutrients:** Repeat foliar sprays of **Zinc Sulphate** (0.5%) and **Borax** (0.1%) during fruit development to ensure proper fruit growth and development.
*   **Water Management:** Consistent and adequate irrigation is crucial. Irregular watering can lead to fruit splitting, reduced juice content, and poor fruit development.
*   **Pest and Disease Management:**
    *   **Fruit Fly:** Install pheromone traps. Use bait sprays with **Malathion** (2 ml/L) mixed with jaggery. For severe infestations, spray **Spinosad** (0.5 ml/L).
    *   **Mites:** Spray with **Fenpropathrin** (0.5 ml/L) or **Spiromesifen** (0.5 ml/L) to prevent scarring and bronzing of fruits.
    *   **Canker/Scab:** Timely control as mentioned above to prevent blemishes and deformities on the fruit surface.
*   **Timely Harvesting:** Harvest fruits at the optimal maturity stage when they attain characteristic size, color, and juice content. Over-mature fruits can become soft and lose quality, while immature fruits lack flavor and juice.

### **3. Improving Storage Life**

Extending the storage life of lemons involves careful pre-harvest practices, proper harvesting, and post-harvest treatments.

*   **Pre-harvest Treatments:**
    *   **Calcium Sprays:** Foliar spray of **Calcium Nitrate** (1%, i.e., 10 g/L) 2-3 weeks before harvest can improve fruit firmness and reduce post-harvest decay.
    *   **Fungicide Sprays:** To reduce latent fungal infections that cause post-harvest rot, spray with **Carbendazim** (1 g/L) or **Mancozeb** (2 g/L) 10-15 days before harvest.
*   **Harvesting:**
    *   **Careful Handling:** Harvest fruits carefully using clippers, leaving a small piece of stem (button). Avoid pulling fruits, which can cause stem-end injury.
    *   **Avoid Damage:** Handle fruits gently to prevent bruises, cuts, and abrasions, which serve as entry points for pathogens.
    *   **Timing:** Harvest during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize field heat.
*   **Post-harvest Treatments:**
    *   **Washing:** Wash fruits with clean water to remove dirt, debris, and field heat.
    *   **Fungicidal Dip:** Dip fruits in a solution of **Carbendazim** (0.5 g/L) or **Thiophanate Methyl** (0.5 g/L) for 2-3 minutes to control post-harvest decay-causing fungi (e.g., *Penicillium* spp.).
    *   **Waxing:** Apply a thin, food-grade wax coating (e.g., carnauba wax) to reduce moisture loss, improve appearance, and provide an additional barrier against pathogens.
*   **Storage Conditions:**
    *   **Temperature and Humidity:** Store fruits at an optimal temperature of 10-13°C with 90-95% relative humidity. This slows down respiration and ripening, extending shelf life.
    *   **Ventilation:** Ensure good air circulation in the storage area to prevent accumulation of ethylene and other gases.
