As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling soil pests like termites and root-knot nematodes in lemon trees in Haryana:

**1. Control of Termites (White Ants):**
Termites can cause significant damage by feeding on the roots and collar region of lemon trees, leading to wilting and eventual death.

*   **Chemical Control (Soil Drenching):**
    *   Apply a soil drench around the base of the affected lemon trees.
    *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC**: Mix 2.5-5 ml of **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** per litre of water. For established trees, use 50-100 ml of the product diluted in 10-20 litres of water per tree, ensuring the solution penetrates the root zone. Repeat if necessary, especially during dry periods when termite activity is high.

**2. Control of Nematodes (Root-knot Nematodes - *Meloidogyne* spp.):**
Root-knot nematodes cause galls on the roots, impairing nutrient and water uptake, leading to stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, and reduced fruit yield.

*   **Chemical Control (Soil Application/Drenching):**
    *   **Fluopyram 34.48% SC**: Apply as a soil drench at a rate of 1.5-2 ml of **Fluopyram 34.48% SC** per litre of water. For individual trees, use 150-200 ml of the product diluted in sufficient water (e.g., 10-20 litres) and drench around the root zone.
    *   **Ethoprophos 10% G**: Alternatively, for granular application, incorporate **Ethoprophos 10% G** into the soil around the root zone at a rate of 20-40 g per tree. Ensure it is mixed well into the topsoil and then irrigate immediately. For larger areas, the recommended dose is typically 10-20 kg/acre.

**General Recommendations and Precautions:**

*   **Integrated Pest Management (IPM):** Always consider IPM practices, including maintaining good soil health, proper irrigation, and removing plant debris, to reduce pest incidence.
*   **Soil Health:** Improve soil organic matter content through farmyard manure or compost, as healthy soil can suppress nematode populations.
*   **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your lemon trees for signs of pest damage to allow for timely intervention.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, and protective clothing when handling and applying pesticides.
*   **Follow Label Instructions:** Strictly adhere to the dosage, application method, and safety precautions mentioned on the product label.
*   **Environmental Considerations:** Avoid applying chemicals near water bodies to prevent contamination.

This advice is based on current scientific understanding and CIBRC approved chemicals relevant to agricultural practices in Haryana.
