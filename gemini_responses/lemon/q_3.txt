As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide scientifically verified advice for controlling various rot types in Lemon, focusing on practices suitable for Haryana.

It is important to understand that many of these rot types, especially those affecting the root and lower stem, are often caused by the same group of pathogens, primarily *Phytophthora* species, and thus share similar control strategies.

**General Cultural Practices (Crucial for all Rot Types):**

1.  **Drainage:** Ensure excellent soil drainage. Lemon trees are highly susceptible to waterlogging, which creates anaerobic conditions favorable for rot pathogens. Plant on raised beds or mounds in heavy soils.
2.  **Irrigation Management:** Avoid direct wetting of the trunk base during irrigation. Use drip irrigation or basin irrigation, keeping water away from the collar region. Do not over-irrigate.
3.  **Weed Control:** Keep the area around the tree base free of weeds to improve air circulation and reduce humidity.
4.  **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy all infected plant parts (leaves, twigs, fruits, severely rotted bark) to reduce inoculum sources.
5.  **Avoid Injury:** Prevent mechanical injuries to the trunk, roots, and branches during cultivation, harvesting, or other orchard operations, as these wounds serve as entry points for pathogens.
6.  **Nutrition:** Maintain balanced nutrition to enhance tree vigor and natural resistance.

**Specific Control Measures for Rot Types:**

**1. Root Rot, Stem Rot, Foot Rot, Collar Rot, Crown Rot, and Neck Rot:**
These are often caused by *Phytophthora* species (e.g., *Phytophthora nicotianae*, *P. citrophthora*) and are collectively referred to as gummosis or foot rot complex. Neck rot in citrus is typically an extension of collar/foot rot affecting the graft union or lower trunk.

*   **Cultural:**
    *   Expose the crown and upper root system by carefully removing soil from around the trunk base (skirting) to allow drying and aeration.
    *   Scrape off infected bark and discolored wood from lesions on the trunk. Paint the wound with a paste of **Copper oxychloride** (50 g in 100 ml water).
*   **Chemical (Soil Drench/Foliar Spray):**
    *   **Fosetyl-aluminium 80% WP:** Apply as a soil drench at 2.5-3.0 kg/acre or 2.5-3.0 g/L of water, ensuring the solution penetrates the root zone. Can also be used as a foliar spray at 2.5 g/L for systemic protection.
    *   **Metalaxyl-M 31.8% ES (or Metalaxyl-M + Mancozeb combination):** Apply as a soil drench at 1.0-1.5 ml/L of water around the base of the tree, ensuring good soil penetration.
    *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride 72.2% SL:** Apply as a soil drench at 2.0-3.0 ml/L of water around the base of the tree.
    *   **Copper oxychloride 50% WP:** As a preventive measure, drench the soil around the tree base with 3.0-4.0 g/L of water, especially before monsoon or during periods of high humidity.

**2. Black Rot and Fruit Rot:**
Fruit rots can be caused by various pathogens, including *Phytophthora* species (brown rot), *Alternaria alternata* (black rot/navel end rot), *Penicillium* species (green/blue mold), and others.

*   **Cultural:**
    *   Harvest fruits carefully to avoid injury.
    *   Remove all fallen and mummified fruits from the orchard floor to reduce inoculum.
    *   Prune lower branches to prevent fruits from touching the ground.
*   **Chemical (Foliar Spray):**
    *   **Copper oxychloride 50% WP:** Spray at 2.5-3.0 g/L of water, especially during fruit development and before monsoon, to protect against *Phytophthora* fruit rot and some bacterial issues.
    *   **Mancozeb 75% WP:** Spray at 2.0-2.5 g/L of water for broad-spectrum protection against various fungal fruit spots and rots.
    *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:** For *Alternaria* black rot and other fungal fruit diseases, spray at 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water.

**3. Seed Rot and Seedling Rot:**
These primarily occur in nurseries and are caused by damping-off pathogens like *Pythium*, *Phytophthora*, and *Rhizoctonia*.

*   **Cultural:**
    *   Use sterilized potting mix or soil for seedbeds.
    *   Ensure good drainage in seed trays/beds.
    *   Avoid overwatering.
*   **Chemical (Seed Treatment/Soil Drench):**
    *   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds before sowing with **Metalaxyl-M 31.8% ES** at 1.0-2.0 ml/kg of seed, or **Thiram 75% WS** at 2.0-3.0 g/kg of seed (ensure specific approval for citrus seed treatment).
    *   **Soil Drench (for seedlings):** Drench the nursery beds or seedling trays with **Propamocarb hydrochloride 72.2% SL** at 2.0-3.0 ml/L of water or **Metalaxyl-M 31.8% ES** at 1.0-1.5 ml/L of water immediately after sowing or at the first sign of disease.
    *   **Biological Control:** Incorporate **Trichoderma viride 1% WP** (2.5-5.0 kg/acre or 5-10 g/kg of potting mix) into the soil or potting media, or use as a seed treatment (5-10 g/kg of seed).

Always follow the specific instructions and safety precautions mentioned on the product labels for dosage, application method, and pre-harvest intervals. Regular monitoring of your orchard is key to early detection and effective management of these diseases.
