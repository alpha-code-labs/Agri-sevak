As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling physical damage in Lemon cultivation in Haryana:

### 1. Fruit Bursting (Cracking)

**Causes:** Fruit bursting is primarily caused by sudden fluctuations in soil moisture (e.g., a prolonged dry spell followed by heavy rain or irrigation), high humidity, rapid fruit growth, and deficiencies of essential nutrients like calcium and boron.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Consistent Irrigation:** Maintain uniform soil moisture throughout the fruit development period. Implement drip irrigation to ensure a steady water supply and avoid extremes of wet and dry conditions.
*   **Mulching:** Apply organic mulch (e.g., straw, crop residues) around the tree base to conserve soil moisture, regulate soil temperature, and reduce evaporation.
*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Calcium:** Apply **Calcium Nitrate** at 10-15 kg/acre through soil application or 5-7 g/L as a foliar spray during fruit development stages. Calcium strengthens cell walls, improving fruit skin elasticity.
    *   **Boron:** Apply **Borax (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate)** at 4-5 kg/acre through soil application or 1-1.5 g/L as a foliar spray. Boron aids in calcium uptake and cell wall formation.
*   **Shade:** In areas with intense sunlight and high temperatures, providing partial shade during peak summer can reduce stress on developing fruits.

### 2. Leaf Burning/Melting

**Causes:** This condition is typically a result of environmental stress, including high temperatures, intense solar radiation (sunburn), water stress (both drought and waterlogging), hot dry winds, and sometimes chemical phytotoxicity or nutrient imbalances (e.g., salinity).

**Control Measures:**

*   **Adequate and Consistent Irrigation:** Ensure the trees receive sufficient water, especially during hot and dry periods. Avoid both drought stress and waterlogging.
*   **Shade Management:** For young plants or during extreme summer heat, provide partial shade using shade nets (e.g., 30-50% shade) to protect foliage from direct, intense sunlight.
*   **Windbreaks:** Plant windbreak trees (e.g., *Casuarina*, *Eucalyptus*) around the orchard perimeter to protect lemon trees from hot, desiccating winds.
*   **Mulching:** Apply organic mulch to the soil surface to help regulate soil temperature and reduce moisture loss, thereby mitigating heat stress.
*   **Nutrient Balance:** Ensure a balanced nutrient supply. Avoid excessive application of nitrogen, which can make foliage more susceptible to burn. Adequate **Potassium Sulphate** (20-30 kg/acre) can improve drought and heat tolerance.
*   **Salinity Management:** If soil salinity is a concern, adopt practices like proper drainage, use of gypsum, and selection of salt-tolerant rootstocks.
*   **Proper Chemical Application:** Always follow recommended dosages and application timings for pesticides and fertilizers. Avoid spraying during high temperatures or strong sunlight to prevent phytotoxicity.

### 3. Hardness in Fruit

**Causes:** "Hardness" in lemon fruit can manifest as a thick rind or, more commonly, as dry, granular pulp (granulation). This is often linked to delayed harvesting, high temperatures during fruit development, water stress, and nutrient imbalances, particularly deficiencies in potassium and boron, or excessive nitrogen.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Optimal Harvesting:** Harvest fruits at their physiological maturity. Delayed harvesting significantly increases the risk of granulation and rind thickening.
*   **Consistent Irrigation:** Maintain uniform soil moisture throughout the fruit development period. Water stress can lead to smaller, harder fruits and increased granulation.
*   **Balanced Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Potassium:** Ensure adequate supply of potassium, which is crucial for fruit size, juice content, and overall quality. Apply **Potassium Sulphate** at 20-30 kg/acre or **Potassium Nitrate** at 10-15 kg/acre through soil, or 5-10 g/L as foliar spray during fruit development.
    *   **Boron:** Deficiency can contribute to thick rind and dry pulp. Apply **Borax (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate)** at 4-5 kg/acre through soil or 1-1.5 g/L as a foliar spray.
    *   **Nitrogen:** Avoid excessive nitrogen application, which can promote vegetative growth at the expense of fruit quality and lead to thicker rinds.
*   **Pruning and Fruit Thinning:** Implement proper pruning practices to maintain tree vigor and light penetration. If fruit set is excessively high, consider thinning to reduce competition and improve the quality of remaining fruits.
*   **Shade:** Protecting developing fruits from extreme heat can help reduce the incidence of granulation.
