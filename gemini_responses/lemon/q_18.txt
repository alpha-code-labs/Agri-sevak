As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified doses for Growth Regulators/Hormones in Lemon cultivation in Haryana:

It is crucial to use these chemicals precisely as recommended, as incorrect dosages can lead to adverse effects on the plant and fruit. Always ensure thorough coverage during foliar sprays.

### Recommended Doses for Lemon

*   **Ethephon** (Technical name for Ethrel)
    *   **Purpose:** Primarily used for degreening and uniform ripening of lemon fruits. It can also be used for flower thinning in case of excessive fruit set to improve fruit size, though this is less common for lemon compared to other citrus.
    *   **Dose:** For degreening/ripening, apply **0.6 - 1.3 ml of Ethephon 39% SL per litre of water** (equivalent to 250-500 ppm).
    *   **Timing:** Apply 7-10 days before the anticipated harvest for degreening, or when fruits have attained physiological maturity but still show some green colour. For flower thinning, apply at full bloom, but this requires careful consideration and is generally not a primary recommendation for lemon in Haryana.

*   **2,4-D** (2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid)
    *   **Purpose:** To prevent pre-harvest fruit drop and to increase fruit size.
    *   **Dose:** Apply **1.25 - 2.5 g of 2,4-D Sodium salt 80% WP per 100 litres of water** (equivalent to 10-20 ppm).
    *   **Timing:** Apply when fruits are about 1/3 to 1/2 of their final size, typically 4-6 weeks after fruit set. A second application can be made 2-3 months later if fruit drop is still a concern. Avoid spraying during flowering.

*   **Boron** (Applied as Boric acid)
    *   **Purpose:** Boron is an essential micronutrient vital for pollen viability, fruit set, and overall fruit development. Deficiency can lead to poor fruit set, thick rind, gumming, and misshapen fruits.
    *   **Dose:** For foliar application, dissolve **1 - 2 g of Boric acid per litre of water** (0.1% - 0.2% solution).
    *   **Timing:** Apply as a foliar spray before flowering (at bud break) and again after fruit set. In case of severe deficiency symptoms, an additional spray can be given during fruit development. Soil application can also be done based on soil test reports, typically 100-200 g of Boric acid per mature tree per year, split into two applications.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read the product label carefully before use.
*   Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during application.
*   The effectiveness of these applications can be influenced by local soil conditions, climate, and specific lemon variety.
*   It is advisable to consult with local agricultural extension specialists or HAU experts for tailored advice based on your specific orchard conditions.
