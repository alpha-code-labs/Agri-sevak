As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following fertilizer doses for Lemon cultivation in Haryana. Please note that these are general recommendations for healthy, bearing trees (typically 5-10 years old) and should ideally be adjusted based on a comprehensive soil test report from a recognized laboratory. Soil testing is crucial for precise nutrient management.

**General Fertilizer Recommendations for Bearing Lemon Trees (5-10 years old) per tree per year:**

**1. Granular Fertilizers (Soil Application):**

*   **Urea:** 1.2 - 1.4 kg
*   **Single Super Phosphate (SSP):** 1.5 - 1.6 kg
*   **Muriate of Potash (MOP):** 650 - 700 g
*   **Sulphur:** The recommended dose of **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** provides approximately 170-180 g of Sulphur per tree, which is generally sufficient. If a soil test indicates a specific Sulphur deficiency, an additional 80-100 g of **Bentonite Sulphur (90% S)** can be applied per tree.

**Application Schedule for Granular Fertilizers:**

*   **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** and any additional **Sulphur** should be applied once a year, preferably in February-March, by broadcasting around the tree canopy and lightly incorporating into the soil.
*   **Urea** and **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** should be split into two or three equal doses to ensure continuous nutrient availability and minimize losses.
    *   **First Dose:** February-March (pre-flowering/fruit set stage).
    *   **Second Dose:** June-July (fruit development stage).
    *   **(Optional) Third Dose:** September-October (post-harvest/vegetative flush).

**2. Nano Fertilizers (Foliar Application):**

Nano fertilizers are designed for foliar application and act as supplements to granular fertilizers, providing quick nutrient uptake.

*   **Nano-Urea (4% N):** 2-4 ml per litre of water. Apply 2-3 sprays during active vegetative growth and fruit development stages.
*   **Nano-DAP (8% N, 16% P2O5):** 2-4 ml per litre of water. Apply 2 sprays, one at the pre-flowering stage and another at the fruit development stage.

**3. NPK Complex Fertilizers:**

*   While individual fertilizers allow for more precise nutrient management, **NPK complex fertilizers** (e.g., 19:19:19, 10:26:26) can be used as a supplementary source or for specific growth stages. The dose will depend on the specific NPK ratio and the overall nutrient requirement. For instance, **NPK (19:19:19)** can be applied at 500-700 g per tree per year, split into two applications, to provide a balanced dose of N, P, K. However, this would require adjusting the doses of other straight fertilizers to avoid over-application of any nutrient.

**Recommendations for Young/Non-Bearing Lemon Trees (1-4 years old):**

For young trees, the fertilizer doses should be gradually increased with age. As a general guideline:
*   **1-year-old tree:** Approximately 1/4th of the mature tree dose.
*   **2-year-old tree:** Approximately 1/2 of the mature tree dose.
*   **3-4-year-old tree:** Approximately 3/4th of the mature tree dose.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Soil Testing:** Always prioritize soil testing to get precise recommendations tailored to your specific field conditions.
*   **Organic Manures:** Supplementing with 20-30 kg of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost per tree per year is highly beneficial for improving soil health, water retention, and nutrient availability.
*   **Micronutrients:** Lemon trees often require micronutrients like Zinc, Manganese, Iron, Copper, and Boron. These are typically applied as foliar sprays based on deficiency symptoms or soil/leaf analysis. Consult with HAU experts for specific micronutrient recommendations.
*   **Watering:** Ensure adequate and timely irrigation, especially after fertilizer application, to facilitate nutrient dissolution and uptake.
