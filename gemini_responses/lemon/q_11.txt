Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing pests in your lemon orchard in Haryana.

Effective pest management relies on an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, mechanical, biological, and chemical methods.

### Control of Beetles and Weevils in Lemon

**1. Beetles (e.g., Citrus Trunk Borer, Stem Borers):**
Beetles, particularly their larval stages, can cause significant damage by boring into the trunk, branches, or roots. The Citrus Trunk Borer (e.g., *Anoplophora chinensis*) is a serious pest.

*   **Symptoms:** Wilting of branches, presence of frass (excreta) near boreholes, gummosis, and ultimately branch dieback or tree death.
*   **Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
    *   Regularly inspect trees for boreholes and frass.
    *   Prune and destroy severely infested branches.
    *   Use a wire or hook to physically extract larvae from boreholes.
    *   Inject a suitable insecticide into the boreholes and plug them with mud or cotton.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **For Stem/Trunk Borers:**
        *   **Chlorpyrifos** (20% EC) at 20 ml per litre of water for swabbing the trunk and main branches, or injecting into boreholes.
        *   **Imidacloprid** (17.8% SL) at 1-2 ml per litre of water, injected into boreholes.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** (5% EC) at 1 ml per litre of water, can be used for general foliar spray if adult beetles are feeding on leaves.

**2. Weevils (e.g., Leaf Notcher Weevils, Citrus Root Weevils):**
Weevils can damage lemon trees both as adults and larvae. Adults typically feed on leaves, causing characteristic notching, while larvae of some species (e.g., root weevils) feed on roots.

*   **Symptoms:** Notched or serrated leaf margins (adult feeding), stunted growth, yellowing leaves, and decline in tree vigour (larval root feeding).
*   **Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
    *   Maintain good orchard sanitation by removing weeds and debris that can harbour weevils.
    *   Shake branches in the early morning to dislodge adult weevils onto a sheet, then collect and destroy them.
    *   Apply sticky bands around tree trunks to prevent flightless weevils from climbing.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **For Adult Weevils (Foliar Spray):**
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** (5% EC) at 0.5-1.0 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Cypermethrin** (10% EC) at 1.0-1.5 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Chlorpyrifos** (20% EC) at 2.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **For Root Weevil Larvae (Soil Drench):**
        *   **Chlorpyrifos** (20% EC) at 4-5 ml per litre of water, applied as a drench around the base of affected trees.
        *   **Imidacloprid** (17.8% SL) at 1-2 ml per litre of water, applied as a soil drench.

### Sawflies

This is not known to affect Lemon. Sawflies are generally not reported as pests of citrus in Haryana or other major citrus-growing regions.

### Important Considerations:

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully, including dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Apply pesticides during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   Consult with your local HAU extension specialist for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and the latest approved pesticides.
