Wild animals can cause significant damage to Groundnut crops by feeding on the plants and pods. Here are scientifically verified methods to protect Groundnut from wild animals:

*   **Physical Barriers:**
    *   **Barbed Wire Fencing:** Install multi-strand barbed wire fences around the field. A fence height of 1.5 to 2 meters is often recommended to deter larger animals like Nilgai (Blue Bull) and wild boar.
    *   **Chain-link Fencing:** A more robust and durable option, though more expensive, providing effective protection against a wider range of animals.
    *   **Solar-Powered Electric Fencing:** This is a highly effective deterrent. These fences deliver a non-lethal, short-duration shock that discourages animals from entering. Ensure the system is low-voltage, well-maintained, and clearly marked with warning signs to prevent accidental contact by humans or domestic animals. Always check local regulations regarding electric fencing.
    *   **Bio-fencing:** Planting thorny bushes such as *Acacia nilotica* (Babul) or other local thorny species along the field boundaries can create a living barrier over time, making it difficult for animals to pass through.

*   **Acoustic and Visual Deterrents:**
    *   **Scarecrows:** Traditional scarecrows can be effective initially, but their effectiveness diminishes quickly as animals habituate. Frequent changes in their appearance or location are necessary.
    *   **Noise Makers:** Using devices like gas guns, drums, or other sound-producing mechanisms at irregular intervals can scare away animals. However, continuous noise can lead to habituation.
    *   **Reflective Tapes/CDs:** Hanging shiny objects that reflect sunlight can create visual disturbances that deter some animals.
    *   **Human Patrolling/Watchmen:** Direct human presence, especially during vulnerable periods (dawn, dusk, and night), is one of the most effective deterrents.
    *   **Guard Dogs:** Trained guard dogs can effectively deter animals through their presence and barking.

*   **Repellents:**
    *   **Natural Repellents:** Applying strong-smelling substances around the field boundaries can act as a deterrent. Examples include solutions made from **Neem oil**, **Castor oil**, or chili powder. Their effectiveness is often limited and requires frequent reapplication, especially after rain.

*   **Cultural and Community Approaches:**
    *   **Clearing Field Boundaries:** Remove bushes, weeds, and other vegetation around the field that can provide cover or hiding spots for wild animals.
    *   **Community-Based Protection:** Collaborate with neighboring farmers for collective fencing, patrolling, or synchronized sowing and harvesting. This can reduce the attractiveness of individual fields and make protection efforts more efficient.
