This is not known to affect Groundnut.

Fruit flies (Tephritidae) are primarily pests of fruit and some vegetable crops, while Ber fly (*Carpomyia vesuviana*) is a specific pest of Ber (*Ziziphus mauritiana*). Neither of these pests are known to cause significant damage or infestation in Groundnut (peanut) crops. Groundnut pods develop underground, making them largely inaccessible to these types of flies.
