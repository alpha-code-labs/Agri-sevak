As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in Groundnut in Haryana:

### Diamondback Moth

This is not known to affect Groundnut. Diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops like cabbage, cauliflower, and mustard.

### Borers, Caterpillars, and Leaf Folder

Borers (e.g., stem borer, pod borer), various caterpillar species (e.g., tobacco caterpillar, gram pod borer, red hairy caterpillar), and the groundnut leaf folder are all lepidopteran pests. Their control strategies often overlap. Effective management requires regular scouting to identify the pest incidence and apply insecticides at the appropriate time, typically when larvae are young.

Here are CIBRC-approved chemical control options for these pests in Groundnut:

*   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** Apply at 60 ml per acre.
*   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG:** Apply at 88-100 g per acre.
*   **Flubendiamide 20% WG:** Apply at 50 g per acre.
*   **Indoxacarb 14.5% SC:** Apply at 200 ml per acre.
*   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** Apply at 200-250 ml per acre.
*   **Novaluron 10% EC:** Apply at 300 ml per acre (particularly effective against Spodoptera litura).
*   **Spinosad 45% SC:** Apply at 60-75 ml per acre.
*   **Thiodicarb 75% WP:** Apply at 200-250 g per acre.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Timing:** Apply insecticides when pest incidence reaches economic threshold levels, typically when young larvae are observed, as they are more susceptible.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough spray coverage of the foliage, including the undersides of leaves, for optimal efficacy.
*   **Rotation:** Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
*   **Integrated Pest Management (IPM):** Always integrate chemical control with cultural practices (e.g., timely sowing, field sanitation), biological control (e.g., conservation of natural enemies), and mechanical methods (e.g., hand-picking large caterpillars) for sustainable pest management.
