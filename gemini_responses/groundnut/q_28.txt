Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the challenges posed by environmental stresses to groundnut cultivation in our region. Groundnut (Arachis hypogaea) is a sensitive crop, and protecting it from extreme weather conditions is crucial for ensuring good yields.

Here's scientifically verified advice to protect your groundnut crop from extreme cold, frost, heat (Loo), and intense sunlight:

### General Management Practices for Stress Tolerance:

1.  **Variety Selection:** Choose groundnut varieties that are known to be relatively tolerant to temperature fluctuations and drought, if available and suitable for your region.
2.  **Optimal Sowing Time:** Adhere strictly to the recommended sowing window for groundnut in Haryana. This ensures that critical growth stages (flowering, pegging, pod development) do not coincide with the most severe periods of cold or heat stress.
3.  **Soil Health:** Maintain good soil health by incorporating organic matter (farmyard manure, compost). Healthy soil improves water retention, nutrient availability, and overall plant resilience to stress.

### Protection from Extreme Cold and Frost:

Groundnut is highly susceptible to cold and frost, especially during its early vegetative and pod development stages.

*   **Light Irrigation:** Apply a light irrigation to the field before the expected frost event. Water has a higher specific heat capacity and releases latent heat slowly, which can raise the soil and ambient air temperature around the plants by a few degrees, offering protection.
*   **Mulching:** Apply a thick layer (5-10 cm) of organic mulch such as straw, dry leaves, or crop residues around the base of the plants. This insulates the soil, retains warmth, and protects the root zone from freezing temperatures.
*   **Smudging/Smoking:** In smaller fields, creating smoke by burning organic materials (e.g., crop residues, dry leaves) on the upwind side of the field can create a warm air blanket, preventing frost from settling on the plants. This is a traditional method that can be effective.
*   **Foliar Application of Potassium:** Adequate potassium nutrition helps plants maintain cell turgor and improves their ability to withstand cold stress.
    *   Consider a foliar spray of **Potassium nitrate** at 1-2% concentration (10-20 g/L water) during the vegetative stage if cold stress is anticipated.

### Protection from Heat (Loo) and Intense Sunlight:

Groundnut can tolerate moderate heat, but extreme temperatures (above 38-40°C) combined with hot, dry winds (Loo) and intense sunlight, especially during flowering and pegging, can lead to flower drop, poor pod formation, and reduced yields.

*   **Frequent Light Irrigation:** Maintain optimal soil moisture through frequent, light irrigations, particularly during flowering and pod development stages. This helps in evaporative cooling of the plant canopy and prevents wilting. Avoid water stress at all costs during these critical periods.
*   **Mulching:** Apply organic mulch to the soil surface. This significantly reduces soil temperature, conserves soil moisture by reducing evaporation, and suppresses weed growth, all of which benefit the crop under heat stress.
*   **Windbreaks:** Planting shelterbelts or tall crops (e.g., castor, pearl millet) around the groundnut field can reduce the velocity of hot, dry winds (Loo), thereby minimizing their damaging effects and reducing transpirational losses.
*   **Foliar Sprays:**
    *   **Potassium nitrate:** A foliar spray of **Potassium nitrate** at 1-2% concentration (10-20 g/L water) can help improve the plant's heat tolerance, reduce flower abortion, and enhance pod filling. Apply during the pre-flowering and flowering stages.
    *   **Kaolin clay:** Spraying a 5-6% solution of **Kaolin clay** (50-60 g/L water) can form a reflective white film on the leaves. This film reflects sunlight, reduces leaf temperature, and minimizes sunburn and heat stress. Apply during peak heat periods, ensuring good coverage.

By implementing these practices, you can significantly mitigate the adverse effects of environmental stresses on your groundnut crop and secure a healthier, more productive harvest.
