As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Groundnut (Arachis hypogaea) in Haryana.

It is crucial to adopt an Integrated Disease Management (IDM) approach, combining cultural practices with judicious chemical applications.

### Fungal Diseases Known to Affect Groundnut in Haryana

**1. Alternaria, Anthracnose, Blight, and Brown Spot (General Foliar Diseases)**
These terms often refer to various leaf spot and blight diseases, including those caused by *Alternaria* species, *Colletotrichum* species (Anthracnose), and the more common Early Leaf Spot (*Cercospora arachidicola*) and Late Leaf Spot (*Cercosporidium personatum*). The control measures for these are generally similar.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Use disease-free, certified seeds.
    *   Practice crop rotation with non-host crops for at least 2-3 years.
    *   Maintain proper plant spacing to ensure good air circulation.
    *   Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest.
    *   Select resistant or tolerant varieties if available for your region.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    Initiate spraying at the first appearance of symptoms, typically around 30-45 days after sowing, or as a prophylactic measure if disease pressure is historically high. Repeat sprays at 10-15 day intervals, depending on disease severity and weather conditions. Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.

    *   **Protective Fungicides:**
        *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP): 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L of water)
        *   **Chlorothalonil** (75% WP): 1.0-1.25 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L of water)

    *   **Systemic Fungicides (Curative and Protective):**
        *   **Propiconazole** (25% EC): 200-250 ml/acre (or 0.5 ml/L of water)
        *   **Tebuconazole** (25% WG): 250-300 ml/acre (or 0.5-0.6 ml/L of water)
        *   **Hexaconazole** (5% EC): 200-250 ml/acre (or 0.5 ml/L of water)
        *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC): 200 ml/acre (or 0.5 ml/L of water)

    *   **Combination Fungicides (Broad-spectrum):**
        *   **Azoxystrobin + Difenoconazole** (11% + 18.2% SC): 200 ml/acre (or 0.5 ml/L of water)
        *   **Tebuconazole + Trifloxystrobin** (50% + 25% WG): 150-200 g/acre (or 0.3-0.4 g/L of water)

**2. Powdery Mildew**
Powdery mildew, caused by *Erysiphe* or *Oidium* species, can occur in groundnut, especially during dry periods followed by high humidity.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Maintain good field sanitation.
    *   Ensure adequate plant spacing.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    Apply fungicides at the first sign of white, powdery patches on leaves and stems.

    *   **Sulphur (Wettable Powder)** (80% WP): 2.0-2.5 kg/acre (or 3-5 g/L of water)
    *   **Hexaconazole** (5% EC): 200-250 ml/acre (or 0.5 ml/L of water)
    *   **Propiconazole** (25% EC): 200-250 ml/acre (or 0.5 ml/L of water)

### Fungal Diseases Not Known to Affect Groundnut

*   **Blast:** This is not known to affect Groundnut. Blast disease primarily affects cereal crops like rice and wheat.
*   **Downy Mildew:** This is not known to affect Groundnut. Downy mildew diseases are caused by oomycetes and are specific to certain plant families.
*   **Grey Mildew:** This is not known to affect Groundnut as a primary field disease. While "grey mildew" can sometimes be used interchangeably with powdery mildew, or refer to *Botrytis cinerea* (grey mold), *Botrytis* is not a common or significant field disease of groundnut in Haryana.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the fungicide label for correct dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
*   Ensure proper spray coverage for effective disease control.
*   Consult your local HAU agricultural extension specialist for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and the prevailing disease situation.
