As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified recommendations for the use of Ethrel, 2,4-D, and Boron in Groundnut (Arachis hypogaea) in Haryana:

### 1. **Ethephon** (Commonly known by trade name Ethrel)

**Role in Groundnut:** Ethephon is a plant growth regulator that releases ethylene, influencing various physiological processes. In groundnut, it can be used to manage excessive vegetative growth, promote flowering, pegging, and improve pod development and filling.

**Recommended Dose and Application:**
*   **Foliar Spray:** 0.6 - 1.3 ml of **Ethephon** (39% SL formulation) per liter of water (equivalent to 250-500 ppm).
*   **Timing:** Apply at the peak flowering stage or early pod development stage, typically 40-60 days after sowing, depending on the variety and crop vigor. Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.

### 2. **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid** (Commonly known as 2,4-D)

**Role in Groundnut:** **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid** is primarily a selective herbicide used for controlling broadleaf weeds. While auxins (like 2,4-D) can act as growth regulators at extremely low concentrations, its use as a *growth regulator* in Groundnut is **not recommended** due to its potent herbicidal action and a very narrow margin of safety for the crop. Even slight overdosing can cause severe phytotoxicity, leading to crop damage and yield loss.

**Recommendation:**
*   **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid** is not recommended as a growth regulator for Groundnut. Its primary and recommended use in agriculture is as a herbicide.

### 3. **Boron**

**Role in Groundnut:** Boron is an essential micronutrient, not a hormone, but it plays a critical role in various physiological processes that regulate growth and development in Groundnut. It is crucial for pollen germination, fertilization, peg elongation, cell wall formation, and carbohydrate transport. Boron deficiency can lead to "hollow heart" or "internal black spot" in kernels, poor pod filling, and reduced yield.

**Recommended Dose and Application:**

*   **Soil Application (for Boron deficient soils):**
    *   Apply 1-2 kg of **Sodium tetraborate decahydrate** (Borax, containing approximately 11.3% Boron) per acre, either pre-sowing or at the time of sowing. This should be mixed thoroughly with soil or other fertilizers.

*   **Foliar Application:**
    *   **Option 1 (using Borax):** 2 g of **Sodium tetraborate decahydrate** per liter of water (0.2% solution).
    *   **Option 2 (using Solubor):** 1 g of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (Solubor, containing approximately 20.5% Boron) per liter of water (0.1% solution).
    *   **Timing:** Apply two foliar sprays. The first spray should be at the initiation of flowering (around 30-40 days after sowing), and the second spray at the pegging stage (around 50-60 days after sowing). Ensure good coverage of the foliage.

Always ensure proper calibration of spray equipment and follow label instructions for all chemical applications. It is advisable to conduct a soil test to determine Boron deficiency before applying soil-based Boron fertilizers.
