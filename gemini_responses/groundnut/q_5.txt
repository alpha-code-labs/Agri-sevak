As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm the following regarding the conditions you've mentioned for Groundnut cultivation in Haryana:

*   **Scab:** This is not known to affect Groundnut.
*   **Canker:** This is not known to affect Groundnut.
*   **Gummosis:** This is not known to affect Groundnut.
*   **Lichen:** This is not known to affect Groundnut. Lichens are symbiotic organisms that typically grow on inert surfaces like rocks, tree bark, or dead wood, and are not parasitic to living groundnut plants. They are not considered a disease or pest of groundnut.
