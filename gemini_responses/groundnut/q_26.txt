As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified information regarding specialized practices in Groundnut (Arachis hypogaea) cultivation relevant to Haryana:

*   **Pruning:**
    This practice is not standard for Groundnut. Groundnut is a low-growing, herbaceous annual plant. Pruning is generally not practiced as it can remove potential flowering and pegging sites, thereby reducing the overall yield. The plant naturally develops its canopy, and intervention through pruning is not beneficial.

*   **Desuckering:**
    This practice is not applicable to Groundnut. Desuckering is typically performed on crops that produce vegetative suckers from the base (e.g., banana, sugarcane). Groundnut does not produce suckers in this manner, and therefore, desuckering is not a relevant cultural practice.

*   **Mulching:**
    Mulching is a beneficial practice in Groundnut cultivation, particularly in Haryana's climatic conditions.
    *   **Purpose:** It helps in conserving soil moisture, suppressing weed growth, regulating soil temperature, and reducing soil erosion.
    *   **Materials:** Common mulching materials include crop residues (e.g., wheat straw, rice straw) or plastic mulches (black or transparent).
    *   **Benefits:**
        *   **Moisture Conservation:** Reduces evaporation from the soil surface, which is crucial for rainfed groundnut or during dry spells in irrigated areas.
        *   **Weed Suppression:** Acts as a physical barrier, preventing weed seed germination and growth, thereby reducing competition for nutrients and water.
        *   **Soil Temperature Regulation:** Moderates soil temperature, which can be favorable for peg penetration and subsequent pod development.
        *   **Pod Quality:** Keeps the developing pods clean and reduces direct contact with soil, potentially lowering the incidence of soil-borne diseases and improving pod appearance.
    *   **Application:** Mulch is typically applied after sowing or after initial weeding, covering the soil surface between the rows.

*   **Grafting:**
    This practice is not standard for Groundnut. Groundnut is an annual herbaceous plant primarily propagated by seeds. Grafting is not a practical or common method for its propagation or cultivation.

*   **Pollination:**
    Specialized pollination practices are not required for Groundnut. Groundnut flowers are predominantly self-pollinating (autogamous). The flowers are often cleistogamous, meaning pollination and fertilization occur before the flower even opens. Therefore, external agents like insects or wind are generally not necessary for successful pollination and subsequent pod formation.
