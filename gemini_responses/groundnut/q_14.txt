As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling soil pests like Termites and Root-knot Nematodes in Groundnut (Arachis hypogaea) in Haryana.

Both Termites and Root-knot Nematodes are significant soil pests that can cause considerable yield losses in Groundnut. An integrated pest management (IPM) approach, combining cultural practices with judicious chemical control, is most effective.

### General Management Principles:
*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate groundnut with non-host crops (e.g., cereals like wheat, maize) to reduce pest populations in the soil.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove crop residues and weeds that can harbor pests.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** Exposes soil pests to predators and harsh environmental conditions.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available and suitable for Haryana conditions, consider using groundnut varieties with resistance or tolerance to these pests.

### Control of Termites (Odontotermes obesus, Microtermes obesi, etc.)

Termites damage groundnut by feeding on roots, hypocotyls, and pods, leading to wilting, poor pod formation, and reduced yield.

**Chemical Control:**

*   **Seed Treatment:**
    *   Treat seeds before sowing with **Fipronil** 5% FS at 2-3 ml per kg of seed. This provides early protection against termites and other soil insects.
*   **Soil Application (at sowing or during early crop growth):**
    *   Apply **Fipronil** 0.3% GR at 10-15 kg per acre by broadcasting and incorporating into the soil at the time of sowing or within 20-30 days after sowing.
    *   Alternatively, apply **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 2-2.5 L per acre mixed with irrigation water or as a drench around the plant base.

### Control of Nematodes (Root-knot Nematodes - Meloidogyne spp.)

Root-knot nematodes (primarily *Meloidogyne arenaria* and *M. javanica*) infect groundnut roots, causing characteristic galls or knots. This impairs water and nutrient uptake, leading to stunted growth, yellowing, reduced pod development, and significant yield losses.

**Chemical Control:**

*   **Soil Application (at sowing):**
    *   Apply **Phorate** 10% GR at 4-6 kg per acre by broadcasting and incorporating into the soil at the time of sowing. This provides systemic protection against nematodes and other soil-borne pests.

**Important Note:**
Always read and strictly follow the instructions, precautions, and safety guidelines provided on the label of the chemical product. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application. Consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and the latest approved practices.
