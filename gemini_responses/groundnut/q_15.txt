As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in Groundnut (Arachis hypogaea) in Haryana:

**1. Grasshopper Control in Groundnut:**

Grasshoppers can cause significant defoliation, especially in young groundnut plants. Integrated pest management strategies are recommended:

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   **Deep Ploughing:** After harvest, deep ploughing helps expose grasshopper egg pods to predators and adverse weather conditions, reducing the next generation's population.
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep fields and surrounding areas free of weeds, which can serve as alternative hosts for grasshoppers.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   For effective control of nymphs and adults, especially during early stages of infestation, consider the following CIBRC approved insecticides:
        *   **Malathion** 50% EC: Apply 1.0 - 1.25 L/acre mixed in 500 L of water.
        *   **Quinalphos** 25% EC: Apply 1.0 L/acre mixed in 500 L of water.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: Apply 200 - 250 ml/acre mixed in 200-400 L of water.
        *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: Apply 1.0 L/acre mixed in 500 L of water.

**2. Painted Bug (Bagrada hilaris):**

This is not known to affect Groundnut as a primary pest causing economic damage. Its primary hosts are cruciferous crops like mustard, cabbage, and radish.

**3. Red Cotton Bug (Dysdercus cingulatus):**

This is not known to affect Groundnut. It is primarily a pest of cotton and other malvaceous plants, feeding on developing seeds.

**4. Black Ants:**

This is not known to affect Groundnut as a primary pest causing economic damage to the crop itself. While ants might be present in fields, they are generally not considered a direct threat to groundnut plants. If they are observed to be "farming" other pests like aphids or mealybugs (which can affect groundnut), controlling the primary pest will typically mitigate the ant issue.
