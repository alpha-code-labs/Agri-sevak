As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified strategies for controlling Scale insects and Mealybugs in Groundnut (मूंगफली) in Haryana. Both these pests are sap-suckers and can significantly reduce yield if not managed effectively.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Approach:**

1.  **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect groundnut plants, especially the undersides of leaves, stems, and leaf axils, for the presence of scale insects (often appearing as small, immobile bumps) and mealybugs (white, cottony masses).
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the field free of weeds, as many weeds can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation to break the pest cycle.
    *   **Removal of Infested Plants:** In case of localized infestations, remove and destroy severely infested plant parts or whole plants to prevent further spread.
3.  **Biological Control:** Encourage natural enemies such as ladybird beetles, lacewings, and parasitic wasps, which prey on or parasitize scale insects and mealybugs. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

**Chemical Control (as a last resort, when infestation levels are high):**

When chemical intervention is necessary, ensure proper application techniques and adhere to recommended dosages. Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application.

**For Scale Insects and Mealybugs:**

*   **Foliar Spray:**
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: 125 ml per acre (mixed in 200-300 litres of water).
    *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: 50 g per acre (mixed in 200-300 litres of water).
    *   **Dimethoate** 30% EC: 660 ml per acre (mixed in 200-300 litres of water).
    *   **Buprofezin** 25% SC: 320-400 ml per acre (especially effective against nymphs and for its insect growth regulator action).
    *   **Spirotetramat** 150 OD: 120-150 ml per acre (systemic, effective against all stages).

*   **Soil Drench (especially for root mealybugs or severe localized infestations):**
    *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: 2.5 litres per acre (mixed in sufficient water and drenched around the base of the plants). This can be effective against root-feeding mealybugs.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Timing:** Apply insecticides when pests are in their vulnerable stages (e.g., crawler stage for scales, early nymphal stages for mealybugs).
*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough coverage of the plant, especially the undersides of leaves and stem junctions, where these pests often hide.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always observe the recommended Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) for any pesticide used to ensure the produce is safe for consumption.

Always consult with your local agricultural extension officer for the most current recommendations and to confirm the suitability of specific products for your farm conditions.
