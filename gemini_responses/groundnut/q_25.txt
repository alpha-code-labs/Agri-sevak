Groundnut (Arachis hypogaea) requires careful irrigation management, especially during critical growth stages, to ensure optimal yield and quality. The specific needs can vary based on soil type, weather conditions, and whether it's a Kharif (monsoon) or Zaid (summer) crop.

Here is full information about irrigation management for Groundnut:

**I. First Irrigation:**

*   **Pre-sowing Irrigation (Palewa):** If the soil is dry at the time of sowing, a pre-sowing irrigation (palewa) is highly recommended to ensure good germination and uniform stand establishment.
*   **Post-sowing Irrigation:** If sowing is done in dry soil without pre-sowing irrigation, a light irrigation immediately after sowing is crucial for proper germination.
*   **First Irrigation after Establishment:** For Kharif groundnut, if there are no significant rains, the first irrigation is typically given around **20-25 days after sowing (DAS)**. This coincides with the early vegetative to pre-flowering stage, which is important for robust plant growth before the onset of flowering. For Zaid (summer) groundnut, which is entirely irrigated, this timing is even more critical.

**II. Second and Subsequent Irrigations:**

Groundnut has several critical water-sensitive stages where timely irrigation is paramount. Water stress during these periods can significantly reduce yield.

*   **Critical Stages for Irrigation:**
    *   **Flowering (25-45 DAS):** This is the most critical stage. Water stress during flowering can lead to flower abortion and reduced peg formation.
    *   **Pegging (45-60 DAS):** Pegs need to penetrate moist soil to form pods. Dry soil at this stage severely hampers pod development.
    *   **Pod Development and Filling (60-90 DAS):** Adequate moisture is essential for proper pod enlargement and kernel filling.
*   **Irrigation Frequency:**
    *   During dry spells, especially from flowering to pod development, irrigations are generally required every **10-15 days**.
    *   Monitor soil moisture regularly. Irrigation should be applied when 50-60% of the available soil moisture is depleted.
*   **Irrigation Depth:** Apply light and frequent irrigations (typically **40-50 mm** or 4-5 cm per irrigation) rather than heavy, infrequent ones. This helps maintain optimal soil moisture without causing waterlogging, which can be detrimental to peg penetration and pod development.
*   **Maturity Stage:** Stop irrigation approximately **10-15 days before harvest**. This allows the pods to mature properly, facilitates drying of the crop, and makes harvesting easier. Continuing irrigation too close to harvest can lead to rotting of pods and difficulty in harvesting.

**III. Sprinkler Use in Groundnut:**

Sprinkler irrigation is highly beneficial for groundnut cultivation, especially in regions like Haryana, where water conservation is crucial and sandy soils are prevalent.

*   **Advantages of Sprinkler Irrigation:**
    *   **Water Saving:** Sprinklers can save **30-40%** of water compared to traditional flood irrigation methods, making them highly efficient.
    *   **Uniform Water Distribution:** Ensures even application of water across the field, leading to uniform crop growth and yield.
    *   **Prevents Waterlogging:** Avoids excessive water accumulation, which is crucial for groundnut as waterlogging can hinder peg penetration into the soil and promote diseases.
    *   **Reduces Soil Crusting:** Helps prevent the formation of a hard crust on the soil surface, which can impede pegging and emergence.
    *   **Suitable for Undulating Terrain and Sandy Soils:** Efficiently irrigates fields with uneven topography and light soils where water percolation is high.
    *   **Fertigation:** Allows for the application of water-soluble fertilizers along with irrigation water, improving nutrient use efficiency.
*   **Application:**
    *   Micro-sprinklers or mini-sprinklers are often preferred for groundnut.
    *   Apply water at a low intensity to match the soil's infiltration rate, preventing runoff and ensuring maximum absorption.
    *   Sprinkler irrigation is particularly advantageous during the critical flowering and pegging stages, as it maintains optimal soil moisture without causing compaction or waterlogging.
