As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I emphasize that addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies in Groundnut (Arachis hypogaea) effectively begins with a comprehensive soil test. A soil test report provides precise information on nutrient availability, allowing for tailored and efficient fertilizer recommendations, preventing both under- and over-application.

Groundnut is a legume and can fix atmospheric nitrogen, which influences its nitrogen requirements.

Here's how to address Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium deficiencies in Groundnut:

### General Recommendations for Balanced Fertilization (Based on Soil Test)

For optimal growth and yield, a balanced application of macro-nutrients is crucial. Based on soil test results, the general recommendation for Groundnut in Haryana is typically:
*   **Nitrogen (N):** 15-20 kg/acre (as a starter dose)
*   **Phosphorus (P2O5):** 40-60 kg/acre
*   **Potassium (K2O):** 20-40 kg/acre

These nutrients are best applied at the time of sowing or within the first few weeks of planting.

### Addressing Specific Macro-nutrient Deficiencies

#### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   General yellowing of older leaves (chlorosis), starting from the tips and margins.
*   Stunted plant growth and reduced vigor.
*   Poor branching and fewer pods.

**Corrective Measures:**
Groundnut, being a legume, fixes atmospheric nitrogen. Therefore, its nitrogen requirement is lower, and excessive nitrogen can inhibit nodulation. However, a starter dose is beneficial for early growth before nodulation is fully established. If severe deficiency symptoms appear despite good nodulation, or if nodulation is poor, corrective measures can be taken:

*   **Foliar Application:**
    *   Spray 1-2% solution of **Urea** (10-20 g of **Urea** per litre of water).
    *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, preferably in the morning or late afternoon.

#### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   Stunted plant growth with dark green or purplish discoloration of leaves.
*   Poor root development and reduced nodulation.
*   Delayed flowering and maturity.
*   Small, poorly filled pods.

**Corrective Measures:**
Phosphorus is relatively immobile in the soil, so basal application at sowing is most critical. Correcting severe P deficiency through foliar application alone is challenging but can provide a temporary boost.

*   **Basal Application (Preventive & Corrective for early stages):**
    *   Apply **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** at 250-375 kg/acre or **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** at 85-130 kg/acre at the time of sowing, based on soil test recommendations.
*   **Foliar Application (for temporary relief):**
    *   Spray 2% solution of **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (20 g of **DAP** per litre of water).
    *   Apply 1-2 sprays during the vegetative to early flowering stage, if symptoms are observed.

#### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   Yellowing and scorching/browning of leaf margins, particularly on older leaves.
*   Weak stems and increased lodging.
*   Poor pod filling, resulting in shriveled kernels.
*   Increased susceptibility to diseases.

**Corrective Measures:**
Potassium is crucial for water regulation, disease resistance, and pod filling.

*   **Basal Application (Preventive & Corrective for early stages):**
    *   Apply **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** at 35-65 kg/acre at the time of sowing or within 30 days of planting, based on soil test recommendations.
*   **Foliar Application:**
    *   Spray 1-2% solution of **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** (10-20 g of **MOP** per litre of water).
    *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, starting from the flowering to pod development stage.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Soil Testing:** Always prioritize soil testing to determine the exact nutrient status and avoid unnecessary applications.
*   **Timing:** Apply basal fertilizers at sowing. Foliar sprays are most effective when applied during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late afternoon) to prevent leaf scorching and maximize absorption.
*   **Water Quality:** Ensure good quality water for foliar sprays.
*   **Compatibility:** If mixing with other pesticides or nutrients, always check for compatibility.
*   **Organic Matter:** Incorporating organic matter (farmyard manure, compost) improves soil health and nutrient retention, reducing the reliance on synthetic fertilizers.
