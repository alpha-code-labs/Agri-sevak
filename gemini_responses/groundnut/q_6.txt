Controlling viral diseases in Groundnut (Moongfali) is crucial for a healthy crop and good yield. Unlike fungal or bacterial diseases, viral diseases cannot be cured once a plant is infected. Therefore, management strategies primarily focus on preventing infection and controlling the vectors (insects) that transmit these viruses.

The viral diseases you mentioned – Leaf curl, Mosaic, Yellow vein clearing, Stripe, and Stunt virus – are indeed known to affect Groundnut in our region and can cause significant losses.

**General Control Strategies for Viral Diseases in Groundnut:**

1.  **Resistant Varieties:** The most effective long-term solution is to cultivate groundnut varieties that are resistant or tolerant to specific viral diseases prevalent in your area. Consult with HAU experts or local Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) for recommended varieties suitable for Haryana.
2.  **Vector Management:** Since most of these viruses are transmitted by insect vectors like aphids (for Mosaic, Stripe, Stunt) and whiteflies (for Leaf curl, Yellow vein clearing), controlling these insects is paramount.
    *   **Seed Treatment:** Treating seeds with systemic insecticides provides early protection against sucking pests.
        *   **Imidacloprid** 70% WS at 5-7 g/kg seed.
        *   **Thiamethoxam** 70% WS at 3-4 g/kg seed.
    *   **Foliar Sprays:** Regular monitoring for vector populations and timely application of insecticides is essential, especially during early crop stages (20-45 days after sowing).
        *   For Aphids and Whiteflies:
            *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL at 0.5 ml/L of water.
            *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG at 0.2 g/L of water.
            *   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP at 0.2 g/L of water.
            *   **Dimethoate** 30% EC at 2 ml/L of water (primarily for aphids).
            *   **Buprofezin** 25% SC at 1.25 ml/L of water (effective against whitefly nymphs).
            *   **Diafenthiuron** 50% WP at 1.25 g/L of water (effective against whiteflies).
3.  **Roguing:** Regularly inspect your field and promptly remove and destroy any plants showing symptoms of viral infection. This prevents the spread of the virus to healthy plants.
4.  **Weed Management:** Many weeds can act as alternate hosts for both the viruses and their insect vectors. Keep your groundnut fields and surrounding areas free of weeds.
5.  **Timely Sowing:** Adhering to the recommended sowing time for groundnut in Haryana can help plants escape peak vector populations or critical infection periods.
6.  **Nutrient Management:** Ensure balanced fertilization to promote vigorous plant growth, which can help plants tolerate stress better. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can sometimes favor aphid multiplication.
7.  **Barrier Crops:** Planting non-host crops like maize or sorghum around groundnut fields can act as a physical barrier, reducing the initial entry of insect vectors into the main crop.

**Regarding Tristeza:**

*   **This is not known to affect Groundnut.** Citrus Tristeza Virus (CTV) primarily affects citrus species and is not a concern for groundnut cultivation.

By adopting an integrated approach combining resistant varieties, effective vector management, and good cultural practices, you can significantly reduce the incidence and impact of viral diseases in your groundnut crop. For specific recommendations tailored to your farm, please consult with the scientists at HAU or your nearest Krishi Vigyan Kendra.
