As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for managing growth issues in Groundnut (Arachis hypogaea) in Haryana:

### Management of Growth Issues in Groundnut

**1. Slow Growth:**
Slow growth in groundnut is often indicative of underlying issues related to nutrient availability, soil health, or environmental stress.

*   **Causes:** Nutrient deficiencies (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, Zinc, Iron, Boron), water stress (deficit or excess), soil compaction, low soil organic matter, suboptimal soil pH, or early pest/disease incidence.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Soil Testing:** Conduct a comprehensive soil test to identify specific nutrient deficiencies and soil pH issues. This is the most crucial first step.
    *   **Balanced Fertilization:** Based on soil test results, apply recommended doses of macro and micronutrients.
        *   For general growth promotion, ensure adequate **Urea** (for Nitrogen), **Diammonium phosphate** (for Phosphorus and Nitrogen), and **Muriate of Potash** (for Potassium) as per HAU recommendations for groundnut.
        *   For micronutrient deficiencies:
            *   **Zinc:** Apply **Zinc sulfate** (21% Zn) at 10-15 kg/acre as basal, or foliar spray 0.5% solution (5 g/L water) at 30-45 days after sowing (DAS).
            *   **Iron:** Foliar spray of **Ferrous sulfate** (19% Fe) at 0.5% concentration (5 g/L water) with a sticker, 2-3 sprays at 7-10 day intervals, especially in high pH soils.
            *   **Boron:** Foliar spray of **Borax** (10.5% B) at 0.2% concentration (2 g/L water) at flowering stage.
    *   **Water Management:** Provide adequate and timely irrigation, avoiding both waterlogging and severe drought stress.
    *   **Soil Health Improvement:** Incorporate organic matter (e.g., well-decomposed farmyard manure at 5-10 tonnes/acre) to improve soil structure, water holding capacity, and nutrient availability.
    *   **Soil pH Correction:** If soil pH is too high (alkaline), apply **Gypsum** (Calcium sulfate dihydrate) at recommended rates. If too low (acidic), apply **Agricultural lime** (Calcium carbonate).

**2. Yellow Growth (Chlorosis):**
Yellowing of groundnut leaves (chlorosis) is a common symptom of nutrient deficiencies or water stress.

*   **Causes:** Primarily deficiencies of Nitrogen, Iron, Zinc, or Sulfur. Waterlogging can also induce yellowing due to impaired root function.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Nitrogen Deficiency (general yellowing, older leaves first):** Apply **Urea** as a top dressing (e.g., 20-30 kg/acre) or foliar spray (2% solution, 20 g/L water) if symptoms appear early.
    *   **Iron Deficiency (interveinal chlorosis, younger leaves first, often in high pH soils):** Foliar spray of **Ferrous sulfate** (19% Fe) at 0.5% concentration (5 g/L water) with a sticker, 2-3 sprays at 7-10 day intervals.
    *   **Zinc Deficiency (stunted growth, small leaves, interveinal chlorosis):** Foliar spray of **Zinc sulfate** (21% Zn) at 0.5% concentration (5 g/L water) with a sticker, 2 sprays at 10-15 day intervals. Alternatively, soil application of **Zinc sulfate** at 10-15 kg/acre as basal.
    *   **Sulfur Deficiency (general yellowing of younger leaves):** Apply **Gypsum** (Calcium sulfate dihydrate) at 200-250 kg/acre as basal or at flowering/pegging stage. Alternatively, **Elemental sulfur** at 20-40 kg/acre can be applied. Foliar spray of **Ammonium sulfate** (2% solution, 20 g/L water) can also provide sulfur.
    *   **Waterlogging:** Ensure proper field drainage to prevent water accumulation, which can lead to root damage and nutrient uptake issues.

**3. Excessive Height:**
Excessive vegetative growth and height in groundnut can lead to lodging, making harvesting difficult and potentially reducing yield.

*   **Causes:** Over-application of nitrogen fertilizers, dense planting, specific varietal characteristics, or high rainfall/humidity leading to lush vegetative growth.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Balanced Nitrogen Fertilization:** Groundnut is a legume and fixes atmospheric nitrogen. Avoid excessive application of nitrogen fertilizers, as this promotes vegetative growth at the expense of pod development. Follow soil test-based recommendations strictly.
    *   **Optimal Plant Spacing:** Maintain recommended plant spacing (e.g., 30 cm row to row, 10-15 cm plant to plant) to ensure proper light penetration and air circulation, reducing competition for light and preventing etiolation.
    *   **Variety Selection:** Choose semi-spreading or bunch type varieties that are inherently less prone to excessive height and lodging.
    *   **Water Management:** Avoid excessive irrigation, especially during the vegetative phase, which can promote lush growth. Irrigate judiciously based on crop water requirements and soil moisture status.

**4. Excessive Flowering:**
Groundnut is an indeterminate crop, meaning it flowers over an extended period. "Excessive flowering" is generally not a problem unless it is accompanied by poor pod development, indicating issues with pollination, fertilization, or nutrient partitioning.

*   **Causes:** While profuse flowering is desirable, if it doesn't translate into good pod set, it could be due to deficiencies in critical nutrients for reproductive growth, poor pollination, or environmental stress.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Boron Deficiency:** Boron is crucial for pollen viability, fertilization, and pod development. If pod set is poor despite good flowering, boron deficiency might be a cause.
        *   Foliar spray of **Borax** (10.5% B) at 0.2% concentration (2 g/L water) or **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (20.5% B) at 0.1% concentration (1 g/L water) at the peak flowering stage.
        *   Soil application of **Borax** at 5-10 kg/acre as basal in boron deficient soils.
    *   **Calcium Deficiency:** Calcium is critical for pod development and kernel filling, especially in the pegging zone.
        *   Apply **Gypsum** (Calcium sulfate dihydrate) at 200-250 kg/acre at the time of flowering/pegging (around 45-60 DAS), ensuring it reaches the root and pegging zone.
    *   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure overall balanced nutrition, especially Phosphorus and Potassium, which are vital for reproductive growth and pod filling.
    *   **Water Management:** Maintain adequate soil moisture during flowering and pegging stages to support pod development and nutrient uptake.
    *   **Pest Management:** Monitor and manage flower thrips or other pests that might damage flowers and interfere with pollination, if observed.
