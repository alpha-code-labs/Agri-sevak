Mites, including Red spider mite (*Tetranychus urticae*, *T. cinnabarinus*) and Rust mite (often referring to Broad mite, *Polyphagotarsonemus latus*), are significant pests of Groundnut in Haryana, especially during dry and warm periods. Effective control requires an integrated approach.

**Symptoms of Mite Infestation:**
*   **Red Spider Mite:** Yellowish-white speckles on the upper leaf surface, often concentrated along the midrib and veins. Underside of leaves may show fine webbing and tiny reddish mites. Leaves turn bronze or reddish-brown and may drop prematurely.
*   **Rust Mite (Broad Mite):** Leaves become distorted, crinkled, and leathery. The underside of leaves may show a bronzed or rusty appearance. Growth can be stunted, and flowers/pods may be affected.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Mites in Groundnut:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the field and surrounding areas free of weeds, as many weeds serve as alternate hosts for mites.
    *   **Proper Irrigation:** Avoid water stress, as it can exacerbate mite infestations. Maintain adequate soil moisture.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can sometimes favor mite multiplication.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate groundnut with non-host crops to break the pest cycle.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Conserve natural enemies such as predatory mites (*Amblyseius* spp.), ladybird beetles, and lacewings, which feed on pest mites. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

3.  **Chemical Control (Acaricides):**
    When mite populations reach damaging levels, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always ensure thorough coverage, especially on the underside of leaves where mites reside. Rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

    The following CIBRC approved acaricides are recommended for mite control in Groundnut:

    *   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** Apply at 125 ml per acre.
    *   **Propargite 57% EC:** Apply at 500 ml per acre.
    *   **Fenpyroximate 5% SC:** Apply at 200-300 ml per acre.
    *   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP:** Apply at 1.5 - 2.0 kg per acre. (Note: Sulphur should not be applied when temperatures are very high, i.e., above 35°C, as it can cause phytotoxicity).
    *   **Abamectin 1.9% EC:** Apply at 100-150 ml per acre.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Spray Volume:** Use sufficient water (typically 200-250 litres per acre for groundnut) to ensure complete coverage of the foliage, especially the undersides of leaves.
*   **Timing:** Apply acaricides at the first sign of infestation to prevent rapid population build-up and significant crop damage.
*   **Safety:** Always read and follow the instructions on the product label, including dosage, pre-harvest interval, and safety precautions. Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying.
