As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies in Groundnut in Haryana:

**1. Beetles (specifically White Grubs):**
White grubs (larvae of various scarab beetles like *Holotrichia consanguinea*, *Lachnosterna serrata*) are a major and destructive pest of groundnut in Haryana. They feed on roots and developing pods, leading to wilting, yellowing, and eventual death of plants.

**Control Measures for White Grubs:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Deep ploughing during summer exposes grubs and pupae to predators and sun, reducing their population.
    *   Collection and destruction of adult beetles (which emerge with the first monsoon rains) by shaking host trees (e.g., neem, ber, babul) in the evening and collecting them in kerosene water.
    *   Timely sowing of groundnut.
    *   Crop rotation with non-host crops.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Seed Treatment (highly recommended for preventive control):**
        *   Treat seeds with **Fipronil** 5 FS @ 2.0-2.5 ml/kg seed.
        *   Alternatively, treat seeds with **Imidacloprid** 600 FS @ 2.0-2.5 ml/kg seed.
    *   **Soil Application (at sowing or early stage, if infestation is anticipated or observed):**
        *   Apply **Fipronil** 0.3% GR @ 20-25 kg/acre by broadcasting and mixing into the soil before sowing or at the time of sowing.
        *   Alternatively, drench the soil around the root zone with **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC @ 4 L/acre mixed in sufficient water.

**2. Weevils:**
Weevils are generally not considered major economic pests of groundnut in Haryana. While some species might occasionally be observed, they typically do not cause significant damage requiring specific control measures. If specific weevil species cause localized damage, their control would depend on identification and severity.

**3. Sawflies:**
This is not known to affect Groundnut.
