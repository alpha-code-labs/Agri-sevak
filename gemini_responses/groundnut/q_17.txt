As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following doses of organic manures for Groundnut cultivation in Haryana, based on scientific verification and best agricultural practices:

Organic manures play a crucial role in improving soil health, fertility, water retention capacity, and microbial activity, leading to better nutrient availability and overall crop growth in Groundnut.

*   **Farmyard Manure (FYM):**
    *   **Recommended Dose:** 10-15 tonnes per hectare (approximately 4000-6000 kg/acre).
    *   **Application:** Incorporate well-decomposed FYM thoroughly into the soil 2-3 weeks before sowing. This allows for proper decomposition and nutrient release.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   **Recommended Dose:** 2.5-5 tonnes per hectare (approximately 1000-2000 kg/acre).
    *   **Application:** Apply and incorporate into the soil before sowing, or as a top dressing during early growth stages. Vermicompost is richer in nutrients than FYM, hence a lower dose is effective.

*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract based product):**
    Sagarika is a plant growth stimulant/nutrient provider, not a bulk organic manure like FYM or Vermicompost. It is available in liquid and granular forms.
    *   **Sagarika (Liquid):**
        *   **Recommended Dose:** 250-500 ml per acre.
        *   **Application:** Dilute the recommended dose in 150-200 litres of water and apply as a foliar spray.
            *   First spray: 30-40 days after sowing.
            *   Second spray: 60-70 days after sowing (during the pod development stage).
    *   **Sagarika (Granular):**
        *   **Recommended Dose:** 8-10 kg per acre.
        *   **Application:** Apply as a basal dose at the time of sowing or within 30 days of sowing, mixed with fertilizers or sand, and incorporate into the soil.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always conduct a soil test to determine the specific nutrient deficiencies and soil health status of your field. This will help in fine-tuning the exact doses of organic and inorganic fertilizers.
*   Ensure the FYM and Vermicompost are well-decomposed to avoid issues with pests, diseases, and nutrient immobilization.
