As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling rust diseases in Groundnut.

Firstly, it is important to clarify the specific rust diseases that affect Groundnut:

*   **Groundnut Rust** is primarily caused by the fungus *Puccinia arachidis*. This is the main rust disease of concern in groundnut cultivation. The pustules typically appear reddish-brown.
*   **Black rust, Brown rust, Yellow rust, and White rust** are not known to affect Groundnut. These are specific rust diseases that primarily affect other crops like cereals (wheat, barley) or crucifers.
*   **Red rust** is likely a colloquial term referring to the common Groundnut Rust (*Puccinia arachidis*) due to the reddish-brown colour of its pustules.

Therefore, the control measures will focus on Groundnut Rust (*Puccinia arachidis*). An Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is recommended for effective and sustainable control:

### Control Measures for Groundnut Rust (*Puccinia arachidis*)

**1. Cultural Practices:**

*   **Resistant Varieties:** The most economical and effective method is to use rust-resistant or tolerant groundnut varieties recommended by HAU for Haryana. Consult your local agricultural extension for the latest recommendations.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops (e.g., cereals, cotton) for at least 2-3 years to reduce the inoculum load in the soil.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected crop debris after harvest. This helps in reducing the primary inoculum for the next season.
*   **Optimum Plant Spacing:** Maintain recommended plant spacing to ensure good air circulation within the canopy, which helps in reducing humidity and fungal spread.
*   **Balanced Fertilization:** Avoid excessive nitrogen application, as it can promote lush vegetative growth, making plants more susceptible to rust. Ensure adequate potassium and phosphorus.
*   **Early Sowing:** Where feasible, early sowing can help the crop escape severe late-season rust infection.

**2. Chemical Control (Fungicides):**

Fungicide application should be done preventively or at the very first appearance of rust symptoms, typically 40-50 days after sowing, depending on weather conditions and variety susceptibility. Repeat applications may be necessary at 10-15 day intervals, especially during humid weather. Always ensure thorough spray coverage.

Here are some CIBRC approved technical chemical names for controlling Groundnut Rust in India, along with their recommended dosages (use 200-400 litres of water per acre for spraying):

*   **Propiconazole** 25% EC: 250 ml per acre
*   **Tebuconazole** 25.9% EC: 250 ml per acre
*   **Difenoconazole** 25% EC: 100 ml per acre
*   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC: 200 ml per acre
*   **Mancozeb** 75% WP: 800 g per acre (primarily a protectant, effective when applied preventively)
*   **Azoxystrobin 18.2% + Difenoconazole 11.4% SC**: 200 ml per acre
*   **Tebuconazole 50% + Trifloxystrobin 25% WG**: 160 g per acre

**Important Considerations for Chemical Application:**

*   **Alternation:** To prevent the development of fungicide resistance, it is crucial to alternate fungicides with different modes of action. For example, do not use the same fungicide or fungicides from the same chemical group repeatedly.
*   **Timing:** Early detection and timely application are key for effective control.
*   **Safety:** Always read and follow the instructions on the fungicide label, including safety precautions, dosage, and pre-harvest interval (PHI). Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).
