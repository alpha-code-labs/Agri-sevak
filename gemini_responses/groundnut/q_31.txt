As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide guidance on the conditions you've described in Groundnut. It's important to note that these are primarily physiological disorders or symptoms of environmental stress rather than direct "physical damage" in the sense of mechanical injury.

Here's how to manage these conditions:

### 1. Fruit Bursting (Pod Splitting)

Fruit bursting, or pod splitting, is a physiological disorder in groundnut often associated with sudden changes in soil moisture and calcium deficiency.

*   **Consistent Soil Moisture:** Maintain uniform soil moisture, especially during pod development and maturation. Avoid long dry spells followed by heavy irrigation, as this sudden influx of water can cause pods to swell rapidly and burst.
*   **Calcium Management:** Calcium is crucial for pod development and strength. Groundnut pods absorb calcium directly from the soil in the pegging zone.
    *   Apply **Gypsum** (Calcium sulfate dihydrate) at a rate of 200-250 kg/acre at the time of flowering (40-50 days after sowing). Ensure it is incorporated into the soil in the pegging zone.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure overall balanced fertilization based on soil test recommendations.
*   **Variety Selection:** Some varieties may be more susceptible to pod splitting. Consult HAU recommendations for suitable varieties for Haryana that are less prone to this issue.

### 2. Leaf Burning/Melting

Leaf burning or melting in groundnut can be a symptom of various stresses, including environmental factors, nutrient imbalances, or chemical phytotoxicity.

*   **Environmental Stress Management:**
    *   **Water Stress:** Ensure adequate and timely irrigation, especially during critical growth stages. Both drought and waterlogging can cause leaf scorching.
    *   **Heat Stress:** High temperatures combined with low humidity can lead to leaf burn. Ensure proper plant spacing to allow for air circulation.
    *   **Salinity/Alkalinity:** If the soil has high salt content or is alkaline, it can cause leaf margin burn. Conduct a soil test. If salinity is an issue, apply **Gypsum** (Calcium sulfate dihydrate) as per soil test recommendations to improve soil structure and leach salts.
*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Boron Toxicity:** Excess boron can cause leaf tip and margin burn. Ensure boron application is only done if a deficiency is confirmed by soil testing, and at recommended rates.
    *   **Potassium Deficiency:** Severe potassium deficiency can also lead to scorching of leaf margins. Apply potassium fertilizers if soil tests indicate a deficiency.
*   **Chemical Phytotoxicity:**
    *   **Correct Application:** Always use recommended dosages of herbicides, insecticides, and fungicides. Incorrect concentrations, improper mixing, or application during high temperatures can cause severe leaf burn.
    *   **Equipment Calibration:** Ensure spray equipment is properly calibrated to avoid over-application.
    *   **Adjuvants:** Use appropriate adjuvants as recommended, as some can increase the risk of phytotoxicity.

### 3. Hardness in Fruit (Poor Kernel Filling / Hard, Underdeveloped Kernels)

"Hardness in fruit" is not a typical term for a groundnut problem. However, if it refers to kernels that are hard, shriveled, or underdeveloped rather than plump and mature, it indicates poor kernel filling.

*   **Adequate Water Supply:** Consistent and sufficient water supply during the pod development and kernel filling stages is critical. Water stress during these periods is a major cause of poor kernel development.
*   **Calcium Availability:** As mentioned for fruit bursting, calcium is vital for kernel development. Insufficient calcium in the pegging zone leads to "pops" (empty pods) or poorly filled, shriveled, and hard kernels.
    *   Apply **Gypsum** (Calcium sulfate dihydrate) at a rate of 200-250 kg/acre at flowering (40-50 days after sowing) in the pegging zone.
*   **Timely Harvest:** Harvesting too early will result in immature, underdeveloped, and potentially hard kernels. Harvest when the majority of pods are mature (indicated by darkening of the inner pod wall and full kernel development).
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure all essential nutrients are available in adequate amounts. Conduct regular soil tests to identify and correct any deficiencies.

For precise recommendations tailored to your specific field conditions, it is always advisable to conduct a soil test and consult with the experts at HAU, Hisar.
