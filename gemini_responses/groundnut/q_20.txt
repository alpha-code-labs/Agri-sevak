As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I advise that addressing micronutrient deficiencies in Groundnut (Arachis hypogaea) is crucial for optimal yield and quality. Accurate diagnosis through soil testing and visual symptom identification is the first step.

Here's how to address the specified micronutrient deficiencies in Groundnut:

### General Recommendations:
*   **Soil Testing:** Always conduct a comprehensive soil test before applying any micronutrients to determine specific deficiencies and avoid over-application.
*   **Foliar Application:** For quick correction of deficiencies, foliar sprays are generally more effective for micronutrients. Apply sprays in the morning or late afternoon.
*   **Water Volume:** Ensure adequate water volume for thorough coverage during foliar sprays (e.g., 200-250 L/acre).

### Specific Micronutrient Deficiencies and Management:

#### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency
*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, small leaves (little leaf).
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application (Preventive):** Apply 25 kg/acre of **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (21% Zn) at the time of sowing.
    *   **Foliar Application (Curative):** Spray a 0.5% solution (5 g/L) of **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (21% Zn) at 30-45 days after sowing (DAS). Repeat after 15 days if symptoms persist.

#### 2. Iron (Fe) / Ferrous Deficiency
*   **Symptoms:** Severe interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, eventually turning almost white.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray a 0.5-1.0% solution (5-10 g/L) of **Ferrous sulphate** (19% Fe) at 30-45 DAS. Repeat after 10-15 days if symptoms persist. For severe cases or high pH soils, a 0.1% solution (1 g/L) of **Fe-EDTA** (12% Fe) can be used.

#### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency
*   **Symptoms:** "Hollow heart" in kernels, poor pod development, stunted growth, thickened and brittle leaves, cracked stems.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application (Preventive):** If soil test indicates low Boron, apply 2-4 kg/acre of **Borax** (10.5-11.3% B) at sowing.
    *   **Foliar Application (Curative):** Spray a 0.1-0.2% solution (1-2 g/L) of **Borax** (10.5-11.3% B) or **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (20% B) at the flowering and early pod development stages.

#### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency
*   **Symptoms:** "Pop" pods (empty pods), shriveled kernels, poor seed filling, dark plumule, stunted root growth. Calcium is critical for pod development and kernel filling, absorbed directly by the developing pods.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application (Critical for Pod Filling):** Apply 200-250 kg/acre of **Gypsum** (Calcium sulphate dihydrate, 23% Ca, 18% S) at the pegging stage (around 45-60 DAS). Apply it directly in the pegging zone. This is the most effective method for addressing pod-filling issues.
    *   **Foliar Application (General Plant Health):** While less effective for pod filling, if general Ca deficiency symptoms are observed on leaves, a 0.5% solution (5 g/L) of **Calcium nitrate** (18.8% Ca) can be applied.

#### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency
*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, starting from the leaf margins and progressing inwards, leaves may become brittle and reddish-purple.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application (Preventive):** If soil test indicates low Magnesium, apply 10-20 kg/acre of **Magnesium sulphate** (9.6% Mg) at sowing.
    *   **Foliar Application (Curative):** Spray a 1-2% solution (10-20 g/L) of **Magnesium sulphate** (9.6% Mg) at 30-45 DAS. Repeat after 15 days if symptoms persist.

#### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency
*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, similar to iron but often with a finer network of green veins, sometimes with necrotic spots.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray a 0.5% solution (5 g/L) of **Manganese sulphate** (30.5% Mn) at 30-45 DAS. Repeat after 10-15 days if symptoms persist.
