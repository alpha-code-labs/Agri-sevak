As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following cultivation practices for Groundnut in Haryana:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   Groundnut should preferably be sown in rows using a seed drill or by dibbling. Row sowing facilitates inter-cultivation, weeding, and other field operations.
    *   Ensure uniform distribution of seeds for optimal plant stand.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   The ideal planting depth for groundnut is 5-7 cm.
    *   Sowing too shallow can lead to poor germination due to moisture stress and bird damage, while sowing too deep can delay emergence and reduce the plant stand.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   **For Bunch/Erect varieties:** A spacing of 30 cm between rows and 10 cm between plants (30 cm x 10 cm) is recommended.
    *   **For Spreading/Semi-spreading varieties:** A wider spacing of 45 cm between rows and 15 cm between plants (45 cm x 15 cm) is generally advised to allow for proper canopy development.

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   The seed dose depends on the variety, seed size, and desired plant population.
    *   **For Bunch/Erect varieties:** A seed rate of 100-120 kg/acre is typically recommended to achieve the desired plant density.
    *   **For Spreading/Semi-spreading varieties:** A seed rate of 80-100 kg/acre is usually sufficient due to wider spacing.
    *   Always use healthy, well-filled seeds with high germination percentage. Adjust the seed rate slightly if germination percentage is lower than standard.
