Namaste, Kisan Bhaiyon! As a Senior Agronomist from Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I am pleased to provide you with scientifically verified advice regarding the maturity signs, harvesting time, and cutting process for Groundnut (मूंगफली) in Haryana.

### Maturity Signs for Groundnut

Accurate assessment of maturity is crucial for maximizing yield and quality. Look for the following indicators:

*   **Leaf Senescence:** The lower leaves of the plant will start turning yellow and shedding. Eventually, the entire plant will show signs of yellowing and drying, indicating the end of its vegetative growth cycle.
*   **Inner Pericarp Colour Change:** This is the most reliable indicator. Carefully dig up a few plants from different parts of your field. Break open 10-15 pods from these plants. The inner lining of the pod (pericarp) will change colour from white/cream to dark brown or black. Harvest is optimal when 70-80% of the pods show this darkening.
*   **Kernel Development:** The kernels inside the pods should be firm, plump, and have the characteristic colour and size for the specific groundnut variety you have planted. Immature kernels will be shriveled and soft.
*   **Peg Brittleness:** The pegs (the stalks that grow from the flower into the soil to form pods) become brittle and easily detach from the main stem when the pods are mature.
*   **Days After Sowing:** While variety-dependent, most groundnut varieties mature between 90 to 140 days after sowing. This serves as a general guide, but the physical signs mentioned above are more accurate.

### Harvesting Time for Groundnut

The timing of harvest significantly impacts both yield and quality.

*   **Optimal Stage:** Harvest when 70-80% of the pods have reached physiological maturity, as indicated by the inner pericarp colour change.
*   **Avoid Premature Harvesting:** Harvesting too early will result in a high percentage of immature, shriveled kernels, leading to reduced yield, lower oil content, and poor market value.
*   **Avoid Delayed Harvesting:** Delaying harvest can lead to significant yield losses. Mature pods may detach from the pegs and remain in the soil, making retrieval difficult. It also increases the risk of pods sprouting in the field due to moisture, and makes them more susceptible to pest damage (e.g., rodents) and fungal infections (e.g., Aflatoxin contamination).
*   **Soil Moisture Condition:** Harvesting is easiest and most efficient when the soil is moist but not waterlogged. If the soil is very dry and hard, a light irrigation 1-2 days before harvesting can help loosen the soil, making it easier to pull out plants and reducing pod breakage.

### Cutting Process (Harvesting Method) for Groundnut

The method of harvesting depends on the scale of cultivation and availability of machinery.

*   **Manual Harvesting:**
    *   **Loosening the Soil:** For small to medium-sized fields, the soil around the groundnut plants is first loosened. This can be done using a spade, hoe, or a country plough (desi hal) to make it easier to pull out the plants.
    *   **Pulling the Plants:** Once the soil is loosened, the entire groundnut plant is carefully pulled out by hand. Ensure that maximum pods are retrieved with the plant.
    *   **Shaking Off Soil:** Gently shake the pulled plants to remove excess soil clinging to the roots and pods.
    *   **Field Drying (Inversion Method):** The plants are often inverted (pods facing upwards, roots facing downwards) and left in the field for 2-3 days. This initial field drying helps in further maturation of some pods, reduces moisture content, and prevents fungal growth.
    *   **Pod Separation:** After field drying, the pods are separated from the plants either by hand or using a small groundnut thresher.

*   **Mechanical Harvesting:**
    *   **Groundnut Digger/Harvester:** For larger cultivation areas, tractor-mounted groundnut diggers or harvesters are highly efficient. These machines dig the plants, lift them, shake off the soil, and either windrow them (arrange them in rows) or invert them for field drying.
    *   **Reduced Labour:** Mechanical harvesting significantly reduces the labour requirement and time, making it a cost-effective option for large-scale farmers.
    *   **Threshing:** After the plants have dried sufficiently in the field, a groundnut thresher is used to separate the pods from the plant material.

Always ensure proper drying of the pods after harvesting to achieve a safe moisture content (typically 8-10%) before storage, to prevent spoilage and maintain quality.
