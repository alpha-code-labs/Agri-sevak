As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling sucking pests in Groundnut (Arachis hypogaea) in Haryana.

**Regarding Psylla:**
This is not known to affect Groundnut (Arachis hypogaea) as a significant pest. Psylla species are primarily pests of specific tree crops like citrus, pear, and some ornamentals.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Aphids, Leafhopper, Whitefly, and Thrips in Groundnut:**

These sucking pests can cause significant damage by directly feeding on plant sap, leading to wilting, stunted growth, and reduced yield. They can also transmit viral diseases. An integrated approach is crucial for effective management.

**1. Monitoring and Early Detection:**
*   Regularly scout fields, especially the undersides of leaves and tender shoots, from the early stages of crop growth.
*   Look for characteristic symptoms like curling leaves, honeydew secretion (for aphids/whiteflies), sooty mold development, and the presence of the insects themselves.
*   Yellow sticky traps can be used to monitor whitefly and thrips populations.

**2. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Timely Sowing:** Adhere to recommended sowing dates for your region in Haryana to avoid peak pest populations.
*   **Resistant/Tolerant Varieties:** Where available and suitable for Haryana conditions, choose varieties known to possess resistance or tolerance to these pests or the viruses they transmit.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush, succulent growth that is more attractive to sucking pests. Maintain balanced nutrition.
*   **Weed Management:** Keep fields free of weeds, as many weeds can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation to break the pest cycle.

**3. Biological Control:**
*   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Protect and encourage natural predators like ladybird beetles, lacewings, syrphid fly larvae, and parasitic wasps (e.g., *Aphidius* species for aphids). Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.
*   **Biopesticides:** Consider using neem-based formulations (e.g., Azadirachtin 1500 ppm @ 5 ml/L water) in the early stages of infestation, which act as antifeedants and growth regulators.

**4. Chemical Control:**
Chemical intervention should be considered when pest populations exceed economic threshold levels. Always ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves. Use adequate water volume (typically 200-300 liters per acre for groundnut) for effective spray coverage.

*   **For Aphids, Leafhopper, Whitefly, and Thrips:**
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL @ 125 ml/acre
    *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG @ 50 g/acre
    *   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP @ 80-100 g/acre
    *   **Fipronil** 5% SC @ 600-800 ml/acre (particularly effective against thrips and leafhoppers)
    *   **Dimethoate** 30% EC @ 660 ml/acre

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.
*   **Safety:** Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label, including dosage, application method, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and safety precautions. Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application.
