"Dropping" in groundnut refers to the premature shedding of flowers and developing pods (often termed "fruit drop" or "pod drop"). The term "Tinda/Boll dropping" is not applicable to groundnut, as groundnuts produce pods, not bolls or tinda. This shedding can significantly reduce yield.

**Primary Causes of Flower and Pod Drop in Groundnut:**

*   **Physiological Stress:**
    *   **Water Stress:** Both drought and waterlogging, especially during critical flowering and pod development stages (40-80 days after sowing).
    *   **High Temperatures:** Temperatures above 35°C can negatively impact pollen viability and pod set.
    *   **Low Light Intensity:** Can reduce photosynthetic efficiency.
*   **Nutrient Deficiencies:**
    *   **Boron:** Essential for pollen germination, fertilization, and pod development.
    *   **Calcium:** Crucial for peg penetration, pod development, and kernel filling. Deficiency leads to empty or poorly filled pods.
    *   **Potassium and Phosphorus:** Imbalance or deficiency can also contribute.
*   **Hormonal Imbalance:** Imbalance of endogenous plant hormones.

**Control Measures:**

To effectively manage flower and pod drop in groundnut, an integrated approach combining good agronomic practices, nutrient management, and judicious use of plant growth regulators is recommended.

**1. Agronomic and Cultural Practices:**
*   **Optimal Water Management:** Ensure adequate and timely irrigation, especially during flowering and pod formation stages. Avoid both water scarcity and waterlogging.
*   **Appropriate Sowing Time:** Sow groundnut at the recommended time for your region to avoid extreme temperatures during critical growth stages.
*   **Weed Control:** Keep the field free of weeds to reduce competition for water, nutrients, and light.

**2. Nutrient Management:**
*   **Calcium Application:**
    *   Apply **Gypsum** (Calcium Sulfate) at 500 kg/acre at the time of peak flowering (around 40-50 days after sowing). This is crucial for peg penetration and pod development in the soil.
*   **Boron Application:**
    *   If Boron deficiency is suspected or prevalent in the soil, apply **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate) at 4-5 kg/acre as a soil application before sowing.
    *   Alternatively, a foliar spray of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** at 1-1.5 g/L of water can be given at the pre-flowering and peak flowering stages.
*   **Balanced Fertilization:** Ensure adequate application of Phosphorus and Potassium as per soil test recommendations.

**3. Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs):**
*   **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA):**
    *   Spray **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA)** at a concentration of 20-40 mg/L (20-40 ppm) at the initiation of flowering and again 15 days later. This helps in reducing flower and pod drop and promoting better pod retention.
    *   *Dosage Example:* For a 20 ppm solution, use 20 mg of NAA per liter of water. If using a commercial formulation, follow label instructions for the desired ppm.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always conduct a soil test to determine specific nutrient deficiencies.
*   Ensure proper spray coverage for foliar applications.
*   Follow label instructions for all chemical applications regarding dosage, timing, and safety precautions.
