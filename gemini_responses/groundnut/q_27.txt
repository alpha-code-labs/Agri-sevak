As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the suitable climate, soil type, and drainage requirements for Groundnut (Arachis hypogaea) cultivation in Haryana:

### Climate Requirements for Groundnut

Groundnut is a tropical and subtropical legume that thrives in warm climates.

*   **Temperature:**
    *   **Optimal Growth:** Requires a long, warm growing season with an average daily temperature between 25°C and 30°C.
    *   **Flowering and Pod Development:** Temperatures below 18°C or above 35°C can adversely affect flowering, pegging, and pod development, leading to reduced yields.
    *   **Frost:** Groundnut is highly susceptible to frost and cannot tolerate it at any stage of growth.
*   **Rainfall:**
    *   **Total Requirement:** Needs about 500-700 mm of well-distributed rainfall during its growing period.
    *   **Distribution:** Critical stages for water requirement are flowering, pegging, and pod development. Drought stress during these periods can significantly reduce yield.
    *   **Sunshine:** Requires abundant sunshine for optimal growth and pod formation.

### Soil Type Requirements for Groundnut

Groundnut performs best in light-textured soils.

*   **Texture:**
    *   **Ideal:** Well-drained sandy loam, loamy sand, or light sandy soils are most suitable.
    *   **Avoid:** Heavy clay soils are generally unsuitable as they impede peg penetration into the soil, making pod development difficult and harvesting challenging.
*   **pH:**
    *   **Optimal Range:** A soil pH between 6.0 and 7.5 is considered ideal.
    *   **Tolerance:** Can tolerate a slightly acidic to neutral pH.
*   **Organic Matter:** Soils with moderate organic matter content are beneficial.
*   **Nutrient Status:** Requires soils with adequate calcium, phosphorus, and potassium. Calcium is particularly crucial for pod development and kernel filling.

### Drainage Requirements for Groundnut

Excellent drainage is paramount for successful groundnut cultivation.

*   **Importance:**
    *   **Peg Penetration:** Good drainage ensures a loose soil structure, allowing the pegs (gynophores) to easily penetrate the soil for pod development.
    *   **Root Health:** Prevents waterlogging, which can lead to root rot and other soil-borne diseases.
    *   **Aeration:** Ensures adequate soil aeration, which is essential for root respiration and the activity of nitrogen-fixing bacteria in root nodules.
    *   **Harvesting:** Facilitates easier harvesting, especially in mechanical harvesting, as pods can be cleanly separated from the soil.
*   **Impact of Poor Drainage:** Waterlogging, even for short periods, can severely damage the crop, leading to yellowing of leaves, stunted growth, poor pod formation, and increased susceptibility to diseases. Therefore, fields with a tendency for water stagnation should be avoided or improved with proper drainage systems.
