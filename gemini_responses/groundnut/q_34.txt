As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding herbicide injury in groundnut. While herbicides are essential for effective weed management, their misuse can lead to significant crop damage. Here's scientifically verified advice to reduce the harmful effects of weedicides/herbicides in groundnut:

1.  **Correct Herbicide Selection:**
    *   **Choose Registered Herbicides:** Always select herbicides specifically registered and recommended for groundnut cultivation in Haryana. These have undergone rigorous testing for crop safety.
    *   **Understand Selectivity:** Opt for selective herbicides that target weeds while minimizing harm to groundnut.
    *   **Consider Weed Spectrum:** Match the herbicide to the dominant weed species in your field (e.g., narrow-leaf, broad-leaf, or both) to ensure efficacy and avoid unnecessary applications of broad-spectrum chemicals.

2.  **Accurate Dosage and Calibration:**
    *   **Strictly Follow Recommendations:** Adhere precisely to the recommended dose rate (g/L, ml/L, kg/acre) provided on the label or by agricultural extension services. Overdosing is a primary cause of phytotoxicity.
    *   **Calibrate Sprayer Regularly:** Ensure your sprayer is accurately calibrated to deliver the correct volume of spray solution per unit area. Incorrect calibration leads to either under-dosing (ineffective) or over-dosing (crop injury).
    *   **Measure Accurately:** Use proper measuring cups or scales to ensure the correct quantity of herbicide is mixed.

3.  **Optimal Application Timing:**
    *   **Pre-emergence Herbicides:** Apply immediately after sowing or within the specified window (e.g., 0-3 days after sowing) before crop and weed emergence. Delay can reduce efficacy and increase crop risk.
    *   **Post-emergence Herbicides:** Apply at the recommended crop growth stage (e.g., 2-4 leaf stage of groundnut) and weed growth stage (e.g., 2-4 leaf stage of weeds). Applying too early or too late can increase crop injury or reduce weed control.

4.  **Proper Application Technique:**
    *   **Adequate Water Volume:** Use the recommended water volume (L/acre) for uniform coverage. Insufficient water can lead to concentrated spray droplets and uneven distribution.
    *   **Appropriate Nozzles:** Use flat fan nozzles for broadcast applications to ensure uniform spray pattern and droplet size. Avoid cone nozzles for herbicides unless specifically recommended.
    *   **Maintain Boom Height:** Keep the spray boom at the recommended height to minimize drift and ensure even coverage.
    *   **Avoid Spray Drift:** Do not spray during windy conditions (wind speed > 10 km/h) to prevent herbicide drift onto non-target groundnut plants or adjacent crops.
    *   **Uniform Coverage:** Ensure the entire field receives uniform application without skips or overlaps.

5.  **Crop Health and Environmental Conditions:**
    *   **Avoid Stressed Crops:** Do not apply herbicides to groundnut plants that are already stressed due to drought, waterlogging, nutrient deficiency, disease, or insect damage. Stressed plants are more susceptible to herbicide injury.
    *   **Soil Moisture:** For pre-emergence herbicides, adequate soil moisture is crucial for activation and proper distribution. For post-emergence, ensure the crop is not under severe moisture stress.
    *   **Temperature and Humidity:** Avoid spraying during extreme temperatures (very high or very low) or when humidity is very low, as these conditions can increase crop sensitivity or reduce herbicide efficacy.
    *   **Rainfall:** Ensure a rain-free period of at least 4-6 hours after post-emergence application for proper herbicide absorption. For pre-emergence, avoid heavy rainfall immediately after application that could leach the herbicide into the root zone.

6.  **Sprayer Cleanliness:**
    *   **Thorough Cleaning:** Always clean the sprayer thoroughly with water and a cleaning agent after using one type of herbicide, especially if switching to a different crop or herbicide. Residues from previous applications (e.g., 2,4-D, glyphosate) can severely damage groundnut.

7.  **Post-Application Management (if injury occurs):**
    *   **Light Irrigation:** If injury is observed from soil-applied herbicides, a light irrigation can sometimes help dilute the herbicide concentration in the root zone.
    *   **Nutrient Support:** Provide foliar application of nutrients (e.g., 2% urea solution, micronutrient mixtures) to help the crop recover from stress and promote new growth.
    *   **Avoid Further Stress:** Protect the injured crop from other biotic (pests, diseases) and abiotic stresses during its recovery phase.

By strictly adhering to these scientific principles, farmers can significantly reduce the risk of herbicide injury and ensure healthy groundnut yields. Always consult with HAU extension specialists for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions.
