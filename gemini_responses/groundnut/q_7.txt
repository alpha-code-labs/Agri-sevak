As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling diseases in Groundnut in Haryana:

### Control of Dieback and Twig Blight in Groundnut

*   This is not known to affect Groundnut. Dieback and Twig blight are terms generally associated with woody plants and are not recognized primary diseases of groundnut, which is an herbaceous crop. Symptoms resembling dieback might occur due to severe root rot, stem rot, or nutrient deficiencies, but they are not referred to as distinct "Dieback" or "Twig blight" diseases in groundnut pathology.

### Control of Tikka Disease (Early and Late Leaf Spot) in Groundnut

Tikka disease, caused by *Cercospora arachidicola* (Early Leaf Spot) and *Phaeoisariopsis personata* (Late Leaf Spot), is a major disease of groundnut in Haryana. Effective management involves a combination of cultural practices and timely fungicidal applications.

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available and suitable for local conditions, cultivate varieties known to have resistance or tolerance to Tikka disease.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops (e.g., cereals) for at least 2-3 years to reduce inoculum build-up in the soil.
*   **Field Sanitation:** After harvest, collect and destroy or deeply plough infected plant debris to reduce the primary source of inoculum for the next season.
*   **Timely Sowing:** Adhere to recommended sowing dates to avoid periods highly conducive for disease development.

**2. Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
Fungicidal sprays are highly effective in managing Tikka disease. Initiate sprays at the first appearance of symptoms, typically around 30-45 days after sowing, and repeat at 10-15 day intervals depending on disease severity and weather conditions. Usually, 2-3 sprays are sufficient.

Recommended CIBRC approved fungicides and their dosages:

*   **Mancozeb** 75% WP: Apply at 2.0 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L of water). This is a contact fungicide effective as a protectant.
*   **Chlorothalonil** 75% WP: Apply at 1.0 kg/acre (or 2.0 g/L of water). This is a broad-spectrum contact fungicide.
*   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: Apply at 250-500 g/acre (or 0.5-1.0 g/L of water). This is a systemic fungicide.
*   **Propiconazole** 25% EC: Apply at 200-250 ml/acre (or 0.4-0.5 ml/L of water). This is a systemic triazole fungicide.
*   **Hexaconazole** 5% EC: Apply at 200-250 ml/acre (or 0.4-0.5 ml/L of water). This is another systemic triazole fungicide.
*   **Difenoconazole** 25% EC: Apply at 100-150 ml/acre (or 0.2-0.3 ml/L of water). This is a systemic triazole fungicide.
*   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC: Apply at 200 ml/acre (or 0.4 ml/L of water). This is a systemic strobilurin fungicide.

**Recommendation for Spray Schedule:**
For effective control and to prevent fungicide resistance, it is advisable to rotate or combine fungicides:
*   **First spray (30-45 DAS):** Use a contact fungicide like **Mancozeb** or **Chlorothalonil**.
*   **Second spray (10-15 days after first):** Use a systemic fungicide like **Propiconazole**, **Hexaconazole**, **Difenoconazole**, **Carbendazim**, or **Azoxystrobin**.
*   **Third spray (10-15 days after second, if needed):** Rotate with a different systemic fungicide or use a combination product (if available and approved) containing both contact and systemic components.

Always ensure thorough coverage of the foliage during spraying. Consult with your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and the latest approved chemical list.
