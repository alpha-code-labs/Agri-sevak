Dear farmer,

Regarding your query about Groundnut cultivation:

Transplantation is generally **not recommended** for Groundnut (Arachis hypogaea). Groundnut develops a strong taproot system, and transplanting can cause significant damage to these roots, leading to poor establishment, stunted growth, and ultimately, a substantial reduction in yield. Therefore, direct sowing is the universally recommended and most effective method for Groundnut cultivation.

Here is the ideal direct sowing information for Groundnut in Haryana:

**1. Ideal Sowing Time (Direct Sowing):**
*   **Kharif Season:** The optimal time for sowing Groundnut in Haryana is from **mid-June to mid-July**, coinciding with the onset of the monsoon rains. Early sowing with irrigation can also be done in the first week of June.

**2. Ideal Sowing Distance (Direct Sowing):**
The spacing depends on the growth habit of the variety:
*   **Bunch Type Varieties:**
    *   Row to Row: **30 cm**
    *   Plant to Plant: **10 cm**
*   **Spreading/Semi-Spreading Type Varieties:**
    *   Row to Row: **45 cm**
    *   Plant to Plant: **15 cm**

**3. Ideal Sowing Process (Direct Sowing):**

*   **Land Preparation:**
    *   Plough the field 1-2 times to achieve a fine tilth.
    *   Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost at 8-10 tonnes/acre during the last ploughing.
    *   Ensure proper leveling for uniform germination and irrigation.

*   **Seed Selection:**
    *   Use high-quality, certified seeds of recommended varieties for Haryana.
    *   Ensure seeds are free from damage and disease.

*   **Seed Rate:**
    *   For bunch type varieties: **100-120 kg/acre**
    *   For spreading/semi-spreading type varieties: **80-100 kg/acre**

*   **Seed Treatment (Crucial for disease and pest management):**
    *   **Fungicidal Treatment:** Treat seeds with a combination fungicide to protect against seed-borne and soil-borne diseases like collar rot and root rot.
        *   **Carbendazim** 1 g/kg seed + **Mancozeb** 2 g/kg seed
        *   Alternatively, **Thiram** 3 g/kg seed or **Captan** 2.5 g/kg seed.
    *   **Insecticidal Treatment:** To protect against early sucking pests and termites.
        *   **Imidacloprid** 1.5 ml/kg seed
        *   Alternatively, **Fipronil** 5 ml/kg seed.
    *   **Bio-fertilizer Treatment:** After chemical treatments, treat seeds with specific bio-fertilizers for enhanced nutrient uptake.
        *   **Rhizobium culture** 200 g/10-15 kg seed (for nitrogen fixation)
        *   **PSB (Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria) culture** 200 g/10-15 kg seed (for phosphorus availability)
        *   Allow seeds to dry in shade for 30 minutes after bio-fertilizer treatment before sowing.

*   **Sowing Depth:**
    *   Sow seeds at a uniform depth of **5-7 cm**. Deeper sowing can delay emergence, while shallower sowing can lead to poor germination and bird damage.

*   **Sowing Method:**
    *   Use a seed drill for uniform spacing and depth, which is crucial for optimal plant stand and yield.
    *   Ensure adequate soil moisture at the time of sowing for good germination.
