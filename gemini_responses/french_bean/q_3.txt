As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I understand your concern regarding the comprehensive control of various rot types in French Bean. Rots are complex diseases, primarily caused by a range of fungal pathogens, often exacerbated by environmental conditions. Effective management requires an integrated approach combining cultural practices, biological methods, and judicious use of CIBRC-approved chemical fungicides.

First, regarding "Black Rot": The bacterial disease known as Black Rot (*Xanthomonas campestris* pv. *campestris*) is primarily a disease of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower) and **this is not known to affect French Bean**. However, some fungal diseases can cause dark lesions that might be colloquially referred to as "black rot" on pods or stems. The following recommendations will cover the major fungal rot pathogens affecting French Bean.

Here's a comprehensive strategy to control various rot types (Root, Stem, Foot, Collar, Crown, Neck, Fruit, Seed, and Seedling rot) in French Bean:

**I. General Cultural Practices (Foundation of Rot Management):**

These practices are crucial for preventing the onset and spread of all rot types:

*   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting French Bean or other susceptible legumes in the same field for at least 2-3 years. Rotate with non-host crops like cereals (wheat, maize).
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris from previous crops. This reduces the inoculum load in the soil.
*   **Soil Drainage:** Ensure good soil drainage to prevent waterlogging, which creates anaerobic conditions favorable for many rot pathogens, especially *Pythium* spp. Raised beds can be beneficial in heavy soils.
*   **Optimum Planting Density:** Avoid overcrowding, which can increase humidity around the plants and facilitate disease spread.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced fertilizers. Excessive nitrogen can lead to lush, soft growth more susceptible to certain rots.
*   **Use Certified Disease-Free Seeds:** This is fundamental to prevent seed-borne pathogens.
*   **Proper Irrigation:** Avoid overhead irrigation late in the day, which keeps foliage wet for extended periods. Drip irrigation is preferred.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** Can help bury infected debris and reduce surface inoculum.
*   **Solarization:** In small areas, soil solarization during hot summer months can reduce soil-borne pathogen populations.

**II. Specific Control Measures (Biological and Chemical):**

These measures target the pathogens causing seed, seedling, root, stem, collar, crown, foot, neck, and fruit rots.

**A. Seed Treatment (for Seed Rot, Seedling Rot, Damping-off, and early Root/Stem Rots):**

Seed treatment is the most critical step for protecting young seedlings from soil-borne pathogens.

*   **Biological Seed Treatment:**
    *   **Trichoderma viride** (10-15 g/kg seed) or **Pseudomonas fluorescens** (10 g/kg seed). Mix the bio-agent with a small amount of water to make a slurry and coat the seeds evenly. Allow to dry in shade before sowing.
*   **Chemical Seed Treatment:**
    *   For broad-spectrum protection against *Rhizoctonia*, *Fusarium*, and *Pythium*:
        *   **Carbendazim** (1 g/kg seed) + **Thiram** (2 g/kg seed)
        *   **Carbendazim** (1 g/kg seed) + **Mancozeb** (2 g/kg seed)
        *   **Fludioxonil** (2.5 g/kg seed) + **Metalaxyl-M** (1.25 g/kg seed) (as a combination product)
    *   Specifically for Oomycete pathogens (*Pythium* spp. causing damping-off and root rot):
        *   **Metalaxyl-M** (1-2 g/kg seed)

**B. Soil Application / Drench (for Root, Stem, Collar, Foot, Crown, Neck Rots):**

These applications target pathogens in the soil around the plant base.

*   **Biological Soil Application:**
    *   **Trichoderma viride** (2.5 kg/acre) or **Pseudomonas fluorescens** (2.5 kg/acre) mixed with 50-100 kg of farmyard manure (FYM) or compost. Keep the mixture moist for 7-10 days in shade before broadcasting and incorporating into the soil at the time of planting or as a drench around the plant base.
*   **Chemical Soil Drench/Application:**
    *   For general root and stem rots (*Rhizoctonia*, *Fusarium*):
        *   **Carbendazim** (1-2 g/L water) as a drench around the plant base (50-100 ml per plant).
        *   **Validamycin** (2-3 ml/L water) as a drench for *Rhizoctonia* and *Sclerotium* rots.
    *   For *Pythium* related rots (wet rot conditions):
        *   **Propamocarb Hydrochloride** (2-3 ml/L water) as a drench.

**C. Foliar Application (for Fruit Rot, and late-stage Stem/Collar Rots if they spread upwards):**

These are applied if the disease manifests on aerial parts, especially pods.

*   For diseases like White Mold (*Sclerotinia sclerotiorum*) or Anthracnose (*Colletotrichum lindemuthianum*) which can cause pod/fruit rot:
    *   **Carbendazim** (0.5-1 g/L water)
    *   **Mancozeb** (2-2.5 g/L water)
    *   **Azoxystrobin** (0.5-1 ml/L water)
    *   **Pyraclostrobin** (0.5-1 ml/L water)
    *   **Boscalid** + **Pyraclostrobin** (as a combination product, 1-1.5 g/L water)
    *   **Propiconazole** (0.5-1 ml/L water)

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Timing:** Apply fungicides preventively or at the very first sign of disease for best efficacy.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in pathogens.
*   **Safety:** Always read and follow the label instructions for dosage, application method, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and safety precautions.
*   **Integrated Approach:** Remember that chemical control is most effective when integrated with strong cultural and biological management practices.

By implementing these scientifically verified strategies, you can effectively manage and control various rot diseases in your French Bean crop.
