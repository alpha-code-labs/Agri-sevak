As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an integrated weed management approach for French Bean, combining cultural practices with the judicious use of scientifically verified herbicides.

For effective control of broadleaf weeds (like Bathu, Congress grass), narrowleaf weeds (like Phalaris minor), and parasitic weeds (Amarbail), consider the following strategies:

**1. General Weed Control (Broadleaf and Narrowleaf Weeds):**

*   **Pre-emergence Application (within 0-3 days after sowing):**
    *   Apply **Pendimethalin** 30% EC at 1.0 kg active ingredient (a.i.) per acre (equivalent to 3.3 L of product per acre) in 200-300 L of water. This provides good control of many annual grasses and broadleaf weeds by forming a chemical barrier in the soil.
    *   Alternatively, **Fluchloralin** 45% EC at 0.9 kg a.i. per acre (equivalent to 2.0 L of product per acre) as a pre-plant incorporation (PPI) herbicide. It should be mixed into the soil to a depth of 2-5 cm before sowing.

*   **Post-emergence Application (for Narrowleaf Weeds/Grasses like Phalaris minor, 15-25 days after sowing):**
    *   If grass weeds are a major problem, apply **Quizalofop-ethyl** 5% EC at 0.25 kg a.i. per acre (equivalent to 500 ml of product per acre) in 200-300 L of water.
    *   Alternatively, **Fluazifop-P-butyl** 13.4% EC at 0.25 kg a.i. per acre (equivalent to 1.8 L of product per acre) in 200-300 L of water.
    *   These graminicides are highly effective against narrowleaf weeds (grasses) without causing harm to the French Bean crop.

**2. Specific Weed Control:**

*   **Amarbail (Cuscuta spp.):**
    *   Pre-emergence application of **Pendimethalin** (as mentioned above) can offer some suppression of germinating Cuscuta seeds.
    *   Once Amarbail has emerged and attached to the French Bean plants, chemical control becomes very difficult without harming the crop. The most effective method is manual removal of infested plants or plant parts as soon as it is noticed, before it spreads. Ensure to remove the parasitic weed completely from the field. Prevention through using clean seed and avoiding contaminated irrigation water is crucial.

*   **Bathu (Chenopodium album) and Congress grass (Parthenium hysterophorus):**
    *   These are common broadleaf weeds. The pre-emergence application of **Pendimethalin** will provide significant control.
    *   For post-emergence control of these broadleaf weeds, selective chemical options in French Bean are limited and can be phytotoxic. Manual weeding at early stages (15-30 days after sowing) is highly recommended for effective control of these weeds if they escape pre-emergence treatment.

*   **Orobanche (Broomrape):**
    *   This is not known to affect French Bean.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always ensure uniform spray coverage.
*   Use the recommended water volume for effective herbicide action.
*   Read the product label carefully before use for specific instructions, safety precautions, and re-entry intervals.
*   Timely weeding, especially during the critical period of crop-weed competition (usually the first 30-45 days after sowing), is crucial for maximizing French Bean yield.
*   Consider crop rotation and clean cultivation practices to minimize weed pressure in subsequent seasons.
