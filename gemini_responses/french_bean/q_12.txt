Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling Scale insects and Mealybugs in French Bean in Haryana. Both these pests can cause significant damage if not managed properly.

**Understanding the Pests:**

*   **Scale Insects:** These are small, immobile insects that attach themselves to stems, leaves, and pods, feeding on plant sap. They are often covered by a waxy or cottony protective layer, making them difficult to control. Young scales (crawlers) are mobile and the most vulnerable stage.
*   **Mealybugs:** These are soft-bodied, oval-shaped insects covered with a white, powdery, waxy secretion. They also feed on plant sap, leading to stunted growth, yellowing, and wilting. They excrete honeydew, which promotes the growth of sooty mold.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategy:**

An IPM approach combines various methods for sustainable and effective pest control.

1.  **Monitoring and Scouting:**
    *   Regularly inspect your French Bean plants, especially the undersides of leaves, stems, and growing points, for early signs of infestation. Early detection is crucial for effective management.

2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy severely infested plant parts or entire plants to prevent further spread.
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the field free of weeds, as they can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
    *   **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to improve air circulation, which can reduce pest build-up.
    *   **Balanced Nutrition:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, as it can promote lush, soft growth that is more attractive to sucking pests.

3.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Natural enemies like parasitic wasps (e.g., *Anagyrus lopezi* for mealybugs) and predatory beetles (e.g., ladybird beetles) can help keep populations in check. Protect these beneficial insects by minimizing the use of broad-spectrum insecticides.

4.  **Chemical Control (As a last resort, when infestation levels are high):**
    When chemical intervention is necessary, choose CIBRC-approved insecticides and ensure proper application techniques for maximum efficacy and safety. Focus on systemic insecticides for better penetration through the waxy layers of these pests.

    **For Scale Insects and Mealybugs:**

    *   **Early Stage Infestation (Crawlers/Nymphs):**
        *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at 1.0-1.25 Litres per hectare (or 400-500 ml per acre) mixed in 500-600 Litres of water. This is an insect growth regulator, effective against nymphs.
        *   **Malathion 50% EC:** Apply at 1.0-1.5 Litres per hectare (or 400-600 ml per acre) mixed in 500-600 Litres of water. This is a contact insecticide, effective against the mobile crawler stage of scales and early mealybug nymphs.

    *   **Established Infestation (Adults/Severe Infestation):**
        *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at 125-150 ml per acre mixed in 200-300 Litres of water. This is a systemic insecticide, effective against sucking pests.
        *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at 50-100 grams per acre mixed in 200-300 Litres of water. This is another systemic insecticide.
        *   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:** Apply at 200-250 ml per acre mixed in 200-300 Litres of water. This is a systemic insecticide with translaminar action, effective against various sucking pests including scales and mealybugs.
        *   **Flupyradifurone 17.09% SL:** Apply at 200 ml per acre mixed in 200-300 Litres of water. This is a newer systemic insecticide effective against a broad range of sucking pests.

**Important Considerations for Chemical Application:**

*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and stems, as these pests often hide there. For mealybugs, the waxy coating makes good coverage critical.
*   **Timing:** Apply insecticides when pests are most vulnerable (e.g., crawler stage for scales, early nymphal stages for mealybugs).
*   **Alternation:** Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.
*   **Safety:** Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label, including dosage, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and safety precautions. Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).

By adopting this comprehensive IPM approach, you can effectively manage Scale insects and Mealybugs in your French Bean crop and ensure healthy yields.
