Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the critical role micronutrients play in ensuring healthy growth and optimal yield of French Bean. Addressing these deficiencies promptly and correctly is vital.

Before applying any micronutrient, it is highly recommended to conduct a soil test to accurately determine the specific deficiencies and their severity in your field. This will help in precise application and avoid unnecessary expenses or potential toxicities.

Here's how to address the common micronutrient deficiencies in French Bean:

### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Stunted growth, small leaves (often called 'little leaf'), interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, and sometimes bronzing of older leaves. Poor pod development can also occur.

**Recommendations:**
*   **Soil Application (for severe deficiency or preventive measure):**
    *   Apply **Zinc sulfate heptahydrate** at 10-25 kg/acre, broadcast and incorporated into the soil before sowing or as a top dressing.
*   **Foliar Application (for quick correction or mild deficiency):**
    *   Spray **Zinc EDTA** at 0.5-1.0 g/L of water, or **Zinc sulfate heptahydrate** at 2-3 g/L of water.
    *   Apply at the early vegetative stage or when symptoms first appear. Repeat after 10-15 days if necessary.

### 2. Iron/Ferrous (Fe) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Pronounced interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, with veins remaining distinctly green. In severe cases, the entire leaf may turn yellow or even white.

**Recommendations:**
*   **Foliar Application (most effective for quick correction):**
    *   Spray **Ferrous EDTA** at 0.5-1.0 g/L of water, or **Ferrous sulfate** at 2-3 g/L of water.
    *   Apply when symptoms appear, preferably in the morning or late afternoon. Repeat after 7-10 days if symptoms persist.
*   **Soil Application (less common for French Bean, mainly for highly alkaline soils):**
    *   Apply **Ferrous sulfate** at 10-20 kg/acre, but foliar application is generally more efficient for iron.

### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Stunted growth, death of growing points (terminal buds), thickened and brittle leaves, poor flower and pod set, and sometimes cracking of stems or pods.

**Recommendations:**
*   **Soil Application (for preventive measure in known deficient soils):**
    *   Apply **Borax (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate)** at 2-4 kg/acre, or **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (Solubor) at 1-2 kg/acre, broadcast and incorporated into the soil before sowing.
*   **Foliar Application (for quick correction):**
    *   Spray **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (Solubor) at 1.0-1.5 g/L of water, or **Borax (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate)** at 2 g/L of water.
    *   Apply at the pre-flowering stage and again at early pod development. Be cautious as Boron can be toxic in excess.

### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Stunted growth, distorted or curled new leaves, death of growing points, and weak stems. While blossom end rot is common in other crops, in French Bean, it primarily affects the growing tips and overall plant vigor.

**Recommendations:**
*   **Soil Application (for general soil health and Ca supply):**
    *   Apply **Gypsum (Calcium sulfate dihydrate)** at 200-500 kg/acre, especially in sodic or calcium-deficient soils, well before sowing.
*   **Foliar Application (for quick correction):**
    *   Spray **Calcium nitrate** at 2-4 g/L of water, or **Calcium chloride** at 1-2 g/L of water.
    *   Apply during active vegetative growth and pre-flowering stages.

### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on older leaves, with veins remaining green. In severe cases, leaves may develop a reddish-purple tint or necrotic spots.

**Recommendations:**
*   **Soil Application (for severe deficiency):**
    *   Apply **Magnesium sulfate heptahydrate** at 10-20 kg/acre, broadcast and incorporated into the soil.
*   **Foliar Application (for quick correction):**
    *   Spray **Magnesium sulfate heptahydrate** at 2-5 g/L of water.
    *   Apply when symptoms appear, repeat after 10-15 days if necessary.

### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, often appearing as a fine network of green veins against a pale yellow background. Small necrotic spots may develop in severe cases.

**Recommendations:**
*   **Foliar Application (most effective for quick correction):**
    *   Spray **Manganese sulfate** at 1-2 g/L of water.
    *   Apply when symptoms appear, preferably in the morning or late afternoon. Repeat after 7-10 days if symptoms persist.
*   **Soil Application (less common for French Bean, mainly for highly alkaline soils):**
    *   Apply **Manganese sulfate** at 5-10 kg/acre, but foliar application is generally more efficient.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always use clean water for spraying.
*   Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage during foliar application.
*   Avoid spraying during hot midday sun to prevent leaf scorching.
*   Consult your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your soil type and crop stage.

By following these scientifically verified recommendations, you can effectively manage micronutrient deficiencies in your French Bean crop and achieve better yields.
