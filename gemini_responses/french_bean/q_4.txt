As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Wilt (including Parawilt) in French Bean in Haryana.

Wilt in French Bean can be caused by several pathogens, primarily fungi like *Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. phaseoli* (Fusarium Wilt), *Sclerotium rolfsii* (Collar Rot/Stem Rot leading to wilt), and *Rhizoctonia solani* (Root Rot leading to wilt), as well as bacteria like *Ralstonia solanacearum* (Bacterial Wilt).

Regarding "Parawilt," it is important to note that "Parawilt" is not a distinct, recognized disease of French Bean in the same way it is for crops like cotton. In French Bean, sudden wilting often falls under the umbrella of the aforementioned fungal or bacterial wilts, or can be a symptom of severe root damage, abiotic stress (e.g., waterlogging followed by drought), or a complex of factors. Therefore, the control measures for common wilts will largely address conditions that might be colloquially referred to as "Parawilt."

Here are the recommended control measures:

### I. Cultural and Agronomic Practices (Foundation of Integrated Pest Management)

1.  **Crop Rotation:** Practice a long-term crop rotation (at least 3-4 years) with non-host crops such as cereals (wheat, maize) to reduce the build-up of soil-borne pathogens.
2.  **Resistant Varieties:** Where available and suitable for Haryana conditions, select French Bean varieties known to possess resistance or tolerance to Fusarium wilt or bacterial wilt. Consult local HAU extension services for specific recommendations.
3.  **Soil Health and Drainage:**
    *   Improve soil drainage to prevent waterlogging, which stresses plants and favors root rot pathogens.
    *   Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost to enhance soil structure and microbial activity.
4.  **Sanitation:**
    *   Promptly remove and destroy infected plant debris from the field to reduce inoculum sources.
    *   Clean and disinfect farm tools and equipment after working in infected areas.
5.  **Sowing Time:** Adjust sowing time to avoid periods highly conducive to disease development, such as very high temperatures and humidity, if possible.
6.  **Irrigation Management:**
    *   Avoid excessive irrigation, especially during the early growth stages.
    *   Use drip irrigation to deliver water directly to the root zone, minimizing leaf wetness and reducing soil splash, which can spread pathogens.
7.  **Nutrient Management:** Ensure balanced fertilization. Avoid excessive nitrogen application, which can sometimes make plants more susceptible to diseases.

### II. Biological Control

1.  **Seed Treatment:**
    *   **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum** (bio-fungicides) @ 5-10 g/kg seed.
    *   **Pseudomonas fluorescens** (bio-bactericide/fungicide) @ 10 g/kg seed.
2.  **Soil Application:**
    *   **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum** @ 2.5 kg/acre, mixed with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost, and applied to the soil before sowing or transplanting.
    *   **Pseudomonas fluorescens** @ 2.5 kg/acre, mixed with 50-100 kg of FYM and applied to the soil.

### III. Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved Technical Chemical Names)

**A. Seed Treatment (Crucial for preventing early infection from soil-borne pathogens):**

1.  For fungal wilts (Fusarium, Sclerotium, Rhizoctonia):
    *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP @ 2 g/kg seed.
    *   **Thiram** 75% WS @ 2.5-3 g/kg seed.
    *   **Carboxin** 37.5% + **Thiram** 37.5% WS @ 2.5 g/kg seed.
    *   **Tebuconazole** 2% DS @ 1.25 g/kg seed.

2.  For bacterial wilt (less effective with chemical seed treatment alone, but can help reduce initial inoculum if present on seed surface):
    *   Hot water treatment (50-52°C for 30 minutes) can be effective for seed-borne bacteria, but requires precise temperature control.

**B. Soil Drench/Application (For existing infections or high-risk areas):**

1.  For fungal wilts (Fusarium, Sclerotium, Rhizoctonia):
    *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP @ 1-2 g/L water, drench around the base of affected plants.
    *   **Propiconazole** 25% EC @ 1 ml/L water, drench around the base of affected plants.
    *   **Hexaconazole** 5% SC @ 2 ml/L water, drench around the base of affected plants.
    *   **Validamycin** 3% L @ 2-3 ml/L water, drench around the base of affected plants (particularly effective against *Rhizoctonia* and *Sclerotium*).

2.  For bacterial wilt (*Ralstonia solanacearum*):
    *   Chemical control is generally less effective once bacterial wilt is established in the soil. Focus heavily on cultural practices and resistant varieties.
    *   In early stages, some copper-based bactericides might offer limited suppression. **Copper Oxychloride** 50% WP @ 2-3 g/L water as a soil drench might be considered, but its efficacy against established *Ralstonia* in the soil is often low.

Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions when using any chemical pesticides. It is advisable to consult with local agricultural extension officers for the most current and specific recommendations for your region within Haryana.
