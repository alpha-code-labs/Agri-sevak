Mites, including Red Spider Mite (*Tetranychus urticae*) and Rust Mite (*Polyphagotarsonemus latus*), are common and damaging pests of French Bean in Haryana. Effective control requires an integrated approach.

**1. Identification:**
*   **Red Spider Mite:** These are tiny, reddish-brown mites found primarily on the underside of leaves. Infested leaves show yellow stippling, bronzing, and in severe cases, fine webbing.
*   **Rust Mite (Broad Mite):** These mites are microscopic and difficult to see with the naked eye. They feed on young, tender leaves and growing points, causing bronzing, curling, distortion, and hardening of leaves, often resembling viral symptoms.

**2. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infested plant debris after harvest to reduce overwintering populations.
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the field and surrounding areas free of weeds, as many weeds act as alternate hosts for mites.
    *   **Proper Irrigation:** Avoid water stress, as dry conditions favor mite multiplication. Overhead irrigation can sometimes help dislodge mites.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush, succulent growth preferred by mites.

*   **Biological Control:**
    *   Conserve natural enemies such as predatory mites (*Amblyseius* species), ladybird beetles, and lacewings, which prey on pest mites. Avoid using broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

*   **Chemical Control (Acaricides):**
    *   Chemical intervention should be considered when mite populations reach damaging levels. Always rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Ensure thorough coverage, especially on the underside of leaves.
    *   Recommended CIBRC-approved acaricides for French Bean in Haryana:
        *   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** Apply at 0.5 ml per litre of water (approximately 125 ml per acre).
        *   **Fenpyroximate 5% SC:** Apply at 1.0 ml per litre of water (approximately 200-300 ml per acre).
        *   **Propargite 57% EC:** Apply at 2.0-2.5 ml per litre of water (approximately 1.0-1.5 litres per acre).
        *   **Abamectin 1.9% EC:** Apply at 0.5 ml per litre of water (approximately 150-200 ml per acre).
        *   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP:** Apply at 2.5-3.0 g per litre of water (approximately 2.0-2.5 kg per acre). This is particularly effective against rust mites and also helps in managing powdery mildew.
        *   **Fenazaquin 10% EC:** Apply at 1.0 ml per litre of water (approximately 500 ml per acre).

    *   **Application Guidelines:**
        *   Use sufficient water volume (e.g., 200-250 litres per acre) to ensure complete and uniform coverage of the foliage, especially the undersides of leaves.
        *   Repeat the application after 10-15 days if the infestation persists, ensuring to use an acaricide with a different mode of action to prevent resistance.
        *   Always read the product label carefully for specific dosage, safety precautions, and Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) before application.
        *   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying operations.
