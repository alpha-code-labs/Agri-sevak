As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling these pests in French Bean in Haryana:

### Ber Fly (*Carpomyia vesuviana*)

This is not known to affect French Bean. The Ber fly is a highly specific pest primarily affecting Ber (*Ziziphus mauritiana*) fruits.

### Fruit Fly (*Bactrocera* spp.) in French Bean

Fruit flies, particularly species like *Bactrocera cucurbitae* (Melon Fruit Fly) and *Bactrocera dorsalis* (Oriental Fruit Fly), can infest French Bean pods, which are botanically fruits. The damage is caused by the maggots feeding inside the developing pods, leading to rotting, malformation, and premature dropping, rendering the pods unfit for consumption.

Effective management requires an integrated approach:

#### 1. Cultural Control Measures:

*   **Field Sanitation:** Regularly collect and destroy all infested, fallen, or damaged pods. This helps break the life cycle of the pest by removing breeding sites.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** After harvest, deep ploughing can expose pupae in the soil to predators and harsh weather conditions, reducing the next generation's population.
*   **Timely Harvest:** Harvest pods as soon as they reach maturity to prevent them from becoming overly attractive to egg-laying females.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting French Bean or other susceptible cucurbit/solanaceous crops in the same area consecutively.

#### 2. Mechanical Control Measures:

*   **Pheromone Traps:** Install specific fruit fly pheromone traps (e.g., Methyl Eugenol traps for *B. dorsalis* or Cue-lure traps for *B. cucurbitae*) at a density of 4-5 traps per acre. These traps attract and kill male fruit flies, reducing the breeding population. Replace lures every 2-3 weeks.

#### 3. Chemical Control Measures (as a last resort and with strict adherence to safety):

When infestation levels are high, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always ensure thorough coverage and adhere to the recommended pre-harvest interval (PHI).

*   **Bait Sprays:** This is a highly effective and targeted method for fruit flies. Mix an insecticide with a protein source.
    *   Mix 100 g of jaggery (gur) or 100 ml of protein hydrolysate with 10 ml of **Malathion 50% EC** in 1 litre of water. Apply this mixture as small droplets (spot sprays) on leaves at 10-15 spots per acre, preferably in the morning. This attracts adult fruit flies, which feed on the bait and die. Repeat every 7-10 days if needed.
*   **Foliar Sprays:** For direct control of adult flies and to prevent egg-laying.
    *   **Malathion 50% EC**: Apply at 1.0 - 1.5 L per acre in 200-400 litres of water.
    *   **Spinosad 45% SC**: Apply at 60 - 75 ml per acre in 200-400 litres of water.
    *   **Dimethoate 30% EC**: Apply at 600 - 800 ml per acre in 200-400 litres of water.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and application.
*   Observe the specified Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) for each chemical to ensure the safety of the produce.
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer for the most current recommendations specific to your region and crop stage.
