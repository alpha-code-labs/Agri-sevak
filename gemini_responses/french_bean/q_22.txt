As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), here are the recommended cultivation practices for French Bean in Haryana:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   French Bean is typically sown directly in the field.
    *   For optimal plant growth, ease of intercultural operations (like weeding and pest management), and better yield, sowing in rows is highly recommended over broadcasting.
    *   Seeds should be placed individually at the recommended spacing.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   The ideal planting depth for French Bean seeds is 2.5 to 5 cm.
    *   Ensure uniform depth across the field for consistent germination and emergence.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   Spacing recommendations vary slightly depending on the growth habit (bush type vs. pole type) and specific variety. For the common bush type French Beans cultivated in Haryana:
        *   **Row to Row:** 30 to 45 cm
        *   **Plant to Plant:** 10 to 15 cm

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   The recommended seed dose for French Bean (bush type) is generally 75 to 100 kg per acre.
    *   This quantity can vary slightly based on the specific variety's seed size, germination percentage, and the desired plant population density. Always use certified seeds with a high germination rate.
