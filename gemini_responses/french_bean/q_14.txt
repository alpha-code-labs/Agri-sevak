Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding soil pests in French Bean. Both termites and root-knot nematodes can cause significant damage, impacting yield and plant health. Here is scientifically verified advice for their control:

### Control of Termites in French Bean

Termites are polyphagous pests that can damage roots and stems, leading to wilting and plant death, especially in young plants.

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove all crop residues, stubble, and woody debris from the field before sowing, as these can serve as food sources and breeding sites for termites.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** Ploughing the field deeply during summer exposes termite colonies to sunlight and predators, reducing their population.
*   **Irrigation:** Adequate irrigation can deter termites, as they prefer dry conditions. Avoid water stress in plants.
*   **Organic Matter:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost. Undecomposed organic matter can attract termites.

**2. Chemical Control:**
For effective chemical control, especially if termite incidence is high:
*   **Soil Drenching:**
    *   Apply **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** at a rate of 2.5 - 4.0 litres per acre, mixed in sufficient water (e.g., 400-600 litres) and drenched around the plant base or applied uniformly to the soil before sowing and incorporated. This provides a protective barrier.

### Control of Nematodes (Root-knot Nematodes) in French Bean

Root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.) are a major threat to French Bean, causing characteristic galls or knots on roots, leading to stunted growth, yellowing, and reduced yield.

**1. Cultural and Biological Control:**
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops like cereals (wheat, maize, sorghum) for at least 2-3 years. Avoid continuous cultivation of susceptible crops like tomato, brinjal, okra, or other legumes.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available and suitable for Haryana conditions, choose French Bean varieties known to have resistance or tolerance to root-knot nematodes. Consult with local HAU extension scientists for specific recommendations.
*   **Summer Ploughing:** Deep ploughing during hot summer months exposes nematode eggs and larvae to desiccating sunlight, reducing their population.
*   **Solarization:** Covering moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets during peak summer for 4-6 weeks can significantly reduce nematode populations in the topsoil layer.
*   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM), compost, or oil cakes (e.g., neem cake at 200-400 kg/acre) into the soil. These improve soil health, enhance beneficial microbial activity, and can have nematicidal properties.
*   **Biological Nematicides:** Application of bio-agents like *Purpureocillium lilacinum* (formerly *Paecilomyces lilacinus*) or *Trichoderma viride* can help suppress nematode populations by parasitizing eggs or competing with nematodes. Apply as soil application or seed treatment.

**2. Chemical Control:**
For severe infestations, chemical nematicides can be used:
*   **Granular Application at Sowing/Transplanting:**
    *   Apply **Phorate 10% GR** at a rate of 10-15 kg per acre, broadcast uniformly and incorporated into the soil before sowing or transplanting.
    *   Alternatively, apply **Carbofuran 3% GR** at a rate of 20-30 kg per acre, broadcast uniformly and incorporated into the soil before sowing or transplanting.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label for dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) while handling chemicals.
*   Integrate various control methods (cultural, biological, and chemical) for sustainable and effective pest management.
*   Consult your local Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or HAU extension specialist for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions.
