Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the challenges posed by sucking pests in French Bean cultivation. Effective management is crucial for healthy yields. Here is a scientifically verified approach to control Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips in French Bean.

### Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Sucking Pests in French Bean

A holistic approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods is most effective.

1.  **Monitoring and Early Detection:**
    *   Regularly inspect your French Bean plants, especially the undersides of leaves and tender shoots, for the presence of pests.
    *   Use yellow sticky traps (10-12 traps per acre) to monitor whiteflies and leafhoppers.

2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available and suitable for Haryana conditions, choose French Bean varieties known for resistance or tolerance to sucking pests.
    *   **Timely Sowing:** Adhere to recommended sowing times to avoid peak pest periods.
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the field and surrounding areas free of weeds, as they can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
    *   **Proper Nutrition and Irrigation:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush growth attractive to sucking pests. Maintain optimal irrigation.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation to break the pest cycle.

3.  **Biological Control:**
    *   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Many natural enemies like ladybird beetles, lacewings, syrphid flies, and parasitic wasps (e.g., *Encarsia formosa* for whiteflies) prey on or parasitize sucking pests. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.
    *   **Biopesticides:** Consider using neem-based formulations (e.g., Azadirachtin 1500 ppm @ 5 ml/L of water) at early stages of infestation, especially for aphids and whiteflies.

4.  **Chemical Control (When necessary):**
    When pest populations exceed economic thresholds and other methods are insufficient, judicious use of CIBRC-approved insecticides is recommended. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

    **For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips:**

    *   **Early Stage Infestation / Low to Moderate Population:**
        *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: 100-125 ml per acre (mixed in 200-300 litres of water).
        *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: 50-100 g per acre (mixed in 200-300 litres of water).
        *   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP: 100-125 g per acre (mixed in 200-300 litres of water).

    *   **Moderate to High Population / Established Infestation:**
        *   **Fipronil** 5% SC: 400-600 ml per acre (especially effective against thrips, also controls aphids and leafhoppers, mixed in 200-300 litres of water).
        *   **Dimethoate** 30% EC: 500-600 ml per acre (a broad-spectrum option for aphids, leafhoppers, thrips, and whiteflies, mixed in 200-300 litres of water).
        *   **Buprofezin** 25% SC: 500-600 ml per acre (highly effective against whitefly nymphs, mixed in 200-300 litres of water).

    **Important Considerations for Chemical Application:**
    *   **Timing:** Apply insecticides preferably in the morning or late afternoon to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
    *   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough coverage of the plant, especially the undersides of leaves where pests often reside.
    *   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and application. Follow the instructions on the product label strictly regarding dosage, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and safety precautions.
    *   **Resistance Management:** Do not use the same chemical repeatedly. Rotate insecticides with different modes of action.

### Regarding Psylla:

This is not known to affect French Bean.
