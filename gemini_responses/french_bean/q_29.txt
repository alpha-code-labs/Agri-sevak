As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I must clarify the terminology first.

The term "Tinda/Boll dropping" is not applicable to French Bean. French Bean produces pods, not tinda or bolls. However, flower drop and pod (fruit) drop are common physiological issues in French Bean.

Flower and pod dropping in French Bean is primarily a physiological response to various stresses rather than a single disease or pest. It indicates that the plant is unable to support all its reproductive structures. Effective control involves identifying and mitigating these underlying stresses.

Here's how to control flower and pod dropping in French Bean:

**I. Cultural Practices and Environmental Management (Primary Focus):**

*   **Optimal Sowing Time:**
    *   Ensure timely sowing to avoid extreme temperatures during flowering and pod development. French beans are sensitive to temperatures above 30-32°C and below 10°C.
*   **Water Management:**
    *   Maintain consistent soil moisture, especially from flowering to pod filling stages.
    *   Avoid both drought stress (insufficient water) and waterlogging (excessive water), as both can lead to flower and pod drop.
    *   Irrigate deeply but infrequently, allowing the topsoil to dry slightly between irrigations.
    *   Use mulching (e.g., straw, crop residues) to conserve soil moisture, regulate soil temperature, and suppress weeds.
*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Conduct soil testing to determine nutrient status and apply fertilizers accordingly.
    *   Avoid excessive nitrogen application, which can promote vegetative growth at the expense of flowering and fruiting, leading to flower drop.
    *   Ensure adequate supply of phosphorus and potassium, which are crucial for flowering and pod development.
    *   Address micronutrient deficiencies, particularly Boron and Molybdenum, which are vital for pollen viability and pod setting.
        *   Foliar spray of **Borax** (10.5% Boron) at 1-2 g/L of water if Boron deficiency is suspected.
        *   Foliar spray of **Sodium Molybdate** (39.5% Molybdenum) at 0.5 g/L of water if Molybdenum deficiency is suspected.
*   **Plant Spacing:**
    *   Maintain optimal plant spacing to ensure good light penetration, air circulation, and reduce competition for water and nutrients.
*   **Weed Control:**
    *   Keep the field free of weeds, which compete with French bean plants for water, nutrients, and light.

**II. Pest and Disease Control (If identified as a cause):**

If flower or pod drop is due to pest or disease damage, specific control measures are required:

*   **Sucking Pests (Thrips, Mites, Aphids):** These pests can damage flowers and young pods, leading to their abscission.
    *   Monitor regularly. If infestation is severe:
        *   For Thrips/Aphids: Spray **Imidacloprid** (17.8% SL) at 0.5 ml/L or **Thiamethoxam** (25% WG) at 0.2 g/L.
        *   For Mites: Spray **Spiromesifen** (22.9% SC) at 0.5 ml/L or **Fenpyroximate** (5% SC) at 1 ml/L.
*   **Pod Borers:** Larvae feeding on young pods can cause them to drop.
    *   Monitor for larvae and damage. If present:
        *   Spray **Chlorantraniliprole** (18.5% SC) at 0.3 ml/L or **Emamectin Benzoate** (5% SG) at 0.4 g/L.
*   **Fungal Diseases (e.g., Anthracnose, Powdery Mildew):** Severe infections affecting flowers or young pods can cause them to drop.
    *   If symptoms are observed:
        *   Spray **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC) at 0.5 ml/L or **Carbendazim** (50% WP) at 1 g/L.

**III. Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs) (Use with caution and only after addressing other factors):**

In some cases, to mitigate flower/pod drop due to physiological stress, application of certain plant growth regulators can be considered.

*   **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA):**
    *   Apply **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA)** (e.g., 4.5% SL formulation) at a very low concentration of 5-10 ppm (parts per million). This typically translates to approximately 0.1-0.2 ml of 4.5% SL per litre of water.
    *   Apply at the pre-flowering or early flowering stage.
    *   **Caution:** Use the correct, very low concentration as higher doses can cause adverse effects like phytotoxicity or malformation. Always follow manufacturer's instructions and conduct a small-scale trial first.

By implementing these integrated management strategies, farmers can significantly reduce flower and pod dropping and improve the yield of French Bean.
