As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in French Bean in Haryana:

It is crucial to integrate cultural practices with chemical control for effective and sustainable disease management. Always consult your local agricultural extension office for the most precise and up-to-date recommendations for your specific field conditions and approved products.

### General Cultural Practices for Fungal Disease Management in French Bean:

*   **Use Certified Disease-Free Seeds:** This is the first and most critical step to prevent many seed-borne diseases.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate French Bean with non-leguminous crops for at least 2-3 years to break disease cycles.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Promptly remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest to reduce inoculum for the next season.
*   **Proper Plant Spacing:** Ensure adequate spacing between plants to improve air circulation, which reduces humidity and fungal growth.
*   **Irrigation Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day, to minimize leaf wetness duration. Drip irrigation is preferred.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available and suitable for Haryana conditions, choose French Bean varieties with known resistance to common fungal diseases.

### Specific Disease Control Measures:

#### 1. Alternaria (Leaf Spot)

*   **Cultural Practices:** As above, focusing on sanitation and crop rotation.
*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
    *   **Mancozeb** @ 2-2.5 g/L of water
    *   **Chlorothalonil** @ 1.5-2 g/L of water
    *   **Azoxystrobin** @ 0.5-1 ml/L of water

#### 2. Anthracnose

*   **Cultural Practices:** Use certified disease-free seeds, crop rotation, and sanitation are paramount. Avoid working in fields when plants are wet to prevent disease spread.
*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
    *   **Carbendazim** @ 0.5-1 g/L of water
    *   **Mancozeb** @ 2-2.5 g/L of water
    *   **Azoxystrobin** @ 0.5-1 ml/L of water
    *   **Thiophanate Methyl** @ 0.5-1 g/L of water

#### 3. Blast

*   This is not known to affect French Bean.

#### 4. Blight (Fungal Blights like Ascochyta Blight, Sclerotinia White Mold)

*   **Cultural Practices:** Use disease-free seeds, crop rotation, proper plant spacing, and good field sanitation. Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization which can lead to dense canopy.
*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
    *   **Mancozeb** @ 2-2.5 g/L of water
    *   **Chlorothalonil** @ 1.5-2 g/L of water
    *   **Carbendazim** @ 0.5-1 g/L of water
    *   **Thiophanate Methyl** @ 0.5-1 g/L of water (particularly effective against Sclerotinia)
    *   **Azoxystrobin** @ 0.5-1 ml/L of water

#### 5. Brown Spot (Cercospora Leaf Spot)

*   **Cultural Practices:** As above, focusing on sanitation and crop rotation.
*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
    *   **Mancozeb** @ 2-2.5 g/L of water
    *   **Chlorothalonil** @ 1.5-2 g/L of water
    *   **Carbendazim** @ 0.5-1 g/L of water
    *   **Azoxystrobin** @ 0.5-1 ml/L of water

#### 6. Downy Mildew

*   **Cultural Practices:** Ensure good air circulation, avoid overhead irrigation, and remove infected plant parts.
*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
    *   **Mancozeb** @ 2-2.5 g/L of water (as a protectant)
    *   **Metalaxyl + Mancozeb** (combination product) @ 2-2.5 g/L of water
    *   **Propamocarb Hydrochloride** @ 2-2.5 ml/L of water
    *   **Dimethomorph** @ 0.5-1 g/L of water (often in combination products)

#### 7. Powdery Mildew

*   **Cultural Practices:** Use resistant varieties (if available), ensure good air circulation, and remove infected plant debris.
*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
    *   **Wettable Sulphur** @ 2-3 g/L of water
    *   **Azoxystrobin** @ 0.5-1 ml/L of water
    *   **Myclobutanil** @ 0.4-0.5 g/L of water
    *   **Hexaconazole** @ 0.5-1 ml/L of water
    *   **Propiconazole** @ 0.5-1 ml/L of water

#### 8. Grey Mildew

*   This is not known to affect French Bean.
