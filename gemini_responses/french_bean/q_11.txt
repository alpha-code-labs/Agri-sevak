As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies in French Bean in Haryana.

It is crucial to adopt an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, mechanical, biological, and judicious chemical methods for sustainable pest control.

### Control of Beetles in French Bean

Various beetle species, such as flea beetles and blister beetles, can cause significant damage to French Bean by feeding on leaves, stems, and pods.

**Symptoms:**
*   Flea beetles cause small, round holes (shot-hole damage) on leaves.
*   Blister beetles defoliate plants, consuming leaves and flowers.

**Control Measures:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Maintain field sanitation by removing weeds and crop residues that can harbor pests.
    *   Practice crop rotation to break the pest life cycle.
    *   Timely sowing can help plants establish before peak pest activity.

2.  **Chemical Control (if necessary, based on economic threshold levels):**
    *   For general beetle control, especially chewing beetles:
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC**: Apply at 1.0 ml per liter of water (200 ml per acre).
        *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC**: Apply at 0.3 ml per liter of water (60 ml per acre).
        *   **Malathion 50% EC**: Apply at 2.0 ml per liter of water (400 ml per acre).

### Control of Weevils in French Bean

While the bean weevil (*Acanthoscelides obtectus*) is primarily a storage pest, initial infestations can occur in the field. Other field weevils can also cause damage.

**Symptoms:**
*   Field weevils can cause characteristic notching on the edges of leaves.
*   Damage to pods and seeds can occur in the field, leading to storage infestation.

**Control Measures:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Harvest the crop promptly to reduce the window for field infestation by storage weevils.
    *   Ensure good field sanitation.
    *   For storage, proper drying and airtight storage are critical.

2.  **Chemical Control (for field infestation):**
    *   For field control of adult weevils:
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC**: Apply at 1.0 ml per liter of water (200 ml per acre).
        *   **Malathion 50% EC**: Apply at 2.0 ml per liter of water (400 ml per acre).

### Control of Sawflies in French Bean

This is not known to affect French Bean. Sawflies are not considered a significant or common pest of French Bean in Haryana or generally.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the label instructions for any pesticide product.
*   Ensure proper safety gear (gloves, mask, protective clothing) is used during application.
*   Observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) specified on the pesticide label to ensure the safety of the produce.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and current pest pressure.
