Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU), Hisar, I am providing scientifically verified advice for the control of pests in French Bean cultivation in Haryana.

Here's how to manage the mentioned pests:

### Borers (e.g., Pod Borer) and Caterpillars (Defoliators)

Borers, particularly pod borers like *Helicoverpa armigera* and *Maruca vitrata*, and various defoliating caterpillars can cause significant damage to French Bean. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is crucial for effective control.

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy affected plant parts and weeds that can harbor pests.
*   **Monitoring:** Regularly scout your field for eggs and young larvae.
*   **Hand Picking:** For small infestations, hand-pick and destroy visible caterpillars and larvae.
*   **Pheromone Traps:** Install pheromone traps (e.g., for *Helicoverpa armigera*) at 5 traps per acre to monitor pest activity and mass trap male moths.

**2. Biological Control:**
*   Encourage natural enemies like parasitic wasps (e.g., *Trichogramma* spp.) and predatory insects.
*   Apply bio-pesticides like **Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)** formulations at early larval stages (as per product label, typically 1-2 kg/acre or 1-2 g/L of water).

**3. Chemical Control (if infestation is severe and crosses Economic Threshold Level):**
Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development. Apply chemicals during the early morning or late evening hours.

*   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** 60 ml/acre
*   **Emamectin Benzoate 5% SG:** 80-100 g/acre
*   **Flubendiamide 20% WG:** 50 g/acre
*   **Indoxacarb 14.5% SC:** 200 ml/acre
*   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** 100-120 ml/acre
*   **Spinosad 45% SC:** 60-75 ml/acre

### Diamondback Moth

This is not known to affect French Bean. Diamondback moth (*Plutella xylostella*) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops like cabbage, cauliflower, and mustard.

### Leaf folder

This is not known to affect French Bean as a specific, significant pest. While generalist caterpillars might occasionally cause some leaf damage or folding, a dedicated "leaf folder" pest for French Bean is not commonly recognized in our region. For general caterpillar damage, please refer to the control measures listed under "Borers and Caterpillars" above.

Always read the label instructions carefully before using any pesticide and follow safety precautions. For specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions, please consult with your local agricultural extension officer.
