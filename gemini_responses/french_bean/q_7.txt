As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm the following regarding the diseases mentioned for French Bean:

*   **Dieback:** This is not known to affect French Bean as a specific, named disease. Symptoms resembling dieback can occur due to various other diseases or environmental stresses, but "Dieback" itself is not a primary disease of French Bean.
*   **Twig blight:** This is not known to affect French Bean as a specific, named disease. Similar to dieback, symptoms of blight can affect stems and leaves, but "Twig blight" is not a recognized primary disease of French Bean.
*   **Tikka disease:** This is not known to affect French Bean. Tikka disease (Cercospora leaf spot) is a prominent disease of groundnut (peanut) and is not found on French Bean.
