As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium) in French Bean in Haryana.

**General Principle:**
The most accurate way to determine nutrient deficiencies and precise application rates is through **soil testing**. It is highly recommended to get your soil tested by a reputable lab (like HAU's soil testing lab) before planting to understand the specific nutrient status of your field. The recommendations below are general guidelines for typical conditions in Haryana.

### Addressing Macro-nutrient Deficiencies in French Bean:

#### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   General yellowing of older leaves (chlorosis), starting from the tips and margins.
*   Stunted growth and reduced vigor.
*   Poor pod development and yield.

**Management:**
*   **Recommended Dose (General):** 20-30 kg Nitrogen per acre.
*   **Application:** Apply Nitrogen in split doses.
    *   **Basal Application:** 10-15 kg Nitrogen per acre at the time of sowing.
    *   **Top Dressing:** The remaining 10-15 kg Nitrogen per acre 25-30 days after sowing, preferably before flowering.
*   **Chemicals:**
    *   **Urea** (46% N):
        *   For 10 kg N/acre: Apply approximately 22 kg **Urea** per acre.
        *   For 15 kg N/acre: Apply approximately 33 kg **Urea** per acre.
    *   **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5): If used for Phosphorus, it will also contribute Nitrogen. Adjust Urea application accordingly.

#### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   Stunted growth and poor root development.
*   Leaves may appear dark green, sometimes with a purplish tinge on the underside, especially on older leaves.
*   Delayed maturity and poor flowering/pod set.

**Management:**
*   **Recommended Dose (General):** 40-60 kg P2O5 per acre.
*   **Application:** Phosphorus is relatively immobile in the soil, so it should be applied as a **basal dose** at the time of sowing, preferably drilled or placed near the seed zone for better uptake.
*   **Chemicals:**
    *   **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5):
        *   For 40 kg P2O5/acre: Apply approximately 87 kg **Diammonium Phosphate** per acre. (This will also provide about 15.6 kg N/acre, so adjust Urea application).
        *   For 60 kg P2O5/acre: Apply approximately 130 kg **Diammonium Phosphate** per acre. (This will also provide about 23.4 kg N/acre).
    *   **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5):
        *   For 40 kg P2O5/acre: Apply approximately 250 kg **Single Super Phosphate** per acre.
        *   For 60 kg P2O5/acre: Apply approximately 375 kg **Single Super Phosphate** per acre.

#### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   Yellowing and browning (scorching) of leaf margins, especially on older leaves.
*   Weak stems and lodging.
*   Poor disease resistance and reduced pod quality/size.

**Management:**
*   **Recommended Dose (General):** 30-40 kg K2O per acre (if soil test indicates deficiency).
*   **Application:** Apply as a **basal dose** at the time of sowing. In sandy soils or areas with high rainfall, a split application (half basal, half at 25-30 DAS) can be beneficial.
*   **Chemicals:**
    *   **Muriate of Potash (Potassium Chloride)** (60% K2O):
        *   For 30 kg K2O/acre: Apply approximately 50 kg **Muriate of Potash** per acre.
        *   For 40 kg K2O/acre: Apply approximately 67 kg **Muriate of Potash** per acre.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Soil Testing is Paramount:** The above are general recommendations. A soil test report will provide precise nutrient levels and allow for tailored fertilizer recommendations, preventing over-application and nutrient imbalances.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management (INM):** Supplement chemical fertilizers with organic manures (Farm Yard Manure, compost) to improve soil health, nutrient availability, and water retention.
*   **Irrigation:** Ensure proper irrigation practices, as water stress can exacerbate nutrient deficiency symptoms and reduce nutrient uptake efficiency.
*   **Foliar Application (for quick correction):** In cases of severe deficiency observed during the growing season, foliar sprays can provide a quick, temporary boost.
    *   For N: 1-2% **Urea** solution (10-20 g/L water).
    *   For P: 0.5-1% **Monoammonium Phosphate** (MAP) or **Diammonium Phosphate** (DAP) solution (5-10 g/L water).
    *   For K: 0.5-1% **Potassium Sulphate** solution (5-10 g/L water).
    *   Always spray in the evening or early morning to avoid leaf scorching and ensure good absorption. Repeat after 7-10 days if needed.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively address macro-nutrient deficiencies and ensure healthy growth and optimal yield in your French Bean crop.
