As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned conditions in French Bean in Haryana:

### Control of Pests in French Bean

**1. Grasshopper**
Grasshoppers are polyphagous pests that can cause significant damage to French Bean by feeding on leaves, stems, and pods.

*   **Cultural/Mechanical Control:**
    *   Regular weeding to remove host plants.
    *   For small infestations, hand-picking and destroying grasshoppers can be effective, especially in the morning.
*   **Chemical Control (Apply when infestation is significant):**
    *   **Malathion** 50% EC: Apply 1.0-1.5 L per acre mixed in 200-400 L of water as a foliar spray.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: Apply 100-120 ml per acre mixed in 200-400 L of water as a foliar spray.
    *   **Cypermethrin** 25% EC: Apply 200-240 ml per acre mixed in 200-400 L of water as a foliar spray.

**2. Painted bug**
This is not known to affect French Bean. Painted bugs (e.g., *Bagrada hilaris*) are primarily pests of cruciferous crops like mustard, cabbage, and cauliflower.

**3. Red cotton bug**
This is not known to affect French Bean. Red cotton bugs (*Dysdercus cingulatus*) are primarily pests of cotton and other malvaceous plants.

**4. Black ants**
Black ants are generally not direct pests that feed on French Bean plants. However, they can be a nuisance, protect other sucking pests like aphids (by feeding on their honeydew), or disturb seedlings by nesting activity. If they are causing a problem:

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Maintain field hygiene and remove any food sources that might attract ants.
    *   If ants are associated with aphids or mealybugs, focus on controlling the primary sucking pests, and the ants will naturally disperse.
*   **Chemical Control (If ants are directly problematic, e.g., disturbing roots or protecting other pests):**
    *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: Apply 2.0-2.5 L per acre as a drench around the base of affected plants or directly into ant nests, mixed in appropriate water volume.
    *   **Fipronil** 0.3% GR: Apply 5-10 kg per acre by broadcasting around the plants or in ant trails/nests, followed by light irrigation.
    *   **Fipronil** 5% SC: Apply 200-300 ml per acre as a spray or drench, mixed in 200-400 L of water.

**General Advisory:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully, including dosage, application method, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Consider Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approaches, which combine cultural, biological, and chemical methods for sustainable pest control.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions.
