As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice on irrigation management for French Bean (Rajma) in Haryana. French bean is sensitive to both water stress and waterlogging, making precise irrigation crucial for optimal yield.

Here is the full information regarding irrigation management for French Bean:

**General Principles for French Bean Irrigation:**

*   French bean has a moderate water requirement.
*   The most critical stages for irrigation are flowering and pod development. Water stress during these periods can significantly reduce yield.
*   Soil type plays a vital role: sandy soils require more frequent, lighter irrigations, while heavier clay soils need less frequent, heavier irrigations.
*   Climatic conditions (temperature, humidity, wind speed) also influence the frequency and amount of water needed.

**First Irrigation:**

*   The first irrigation is crucial for establishing a healthy stand and promoting vigorous early growth.
*   **Timing:** It is typically given around **20-25 days after sowing (DAS)**, or when the plants have developed 2-3 true leaves.
*   **Purpose:** This irrigation helps in nutrient uptake and supports the initial vegetative growth phase.
*   **Method:** It should be a light irrigation to avoid crust formation, which can hinder seedling emergence or damage young, tender plants. Ensure uniform wetting of the root zone.

**Second Irrigation:**

*   The second irrigation is timed to support the plant as it transitions into its reproductive phase.
*   **Timing:** This irrigation is generally applied around **40-45 DAS**, coinciding with the pre-flowering or early flowering stage.
*   **Purpose:** This is a highly critical stage. Adequate moisture at this point ensures proper flower initiation, reduces flower drop, and sets the stage for good pod development. Water stress during flowering can severely impact yield.

**Subsequent Irrigations:**

*   After the second irrigation, subsequent irrigations should be managed to maintain optimal soil moisture throughout the flowering and pod development stages.
*   **Frequency:** Depending on soil type and prevailing weather conditions, irrigations may be required every **7-10 days** during peak demand (flowering to pod filling).
*   **Key Stages:** Ensure the crop does not experience water stress during pod formation and filling, as this directly affects pod size and seed weight.
*   **Maturity:** Reduce irrigation frequency and amount as the pods mature and approach harvesting to prevent disease development and facilitate harvesting operations. Avoid waterlogging at all stages.

**Sprinkler Use (including Drip Irrigation):**

Sprinkler irrigation, particularly micro-sprinklers or drip irrigation, is highly recommended for French Bean cultivation in Haryana due to its efficiency and benefits:

*   **Water Use Efficiency:** Sprinkler and drip systems can save **30-50%** of water compared to traditional flood irrigation methods, which is crucial in water-scarce regions.
*   **Uniform Water Distribution:** These systems ensure uniform application of water across the field, leading to consistent plant growth and yield.
*   **Reduced Nutrient Leaching:** Water is applied directly to the root zone, minimizing deep percolation and nutrient loss.
*   **Fertigation Capability:** Fertilizers can be applied efficiently along with irrigation water (fertigation), ensuring nutrients are available to the plants when needed.
*   **Weed Control:** Drip irrigation keeps the inter-row spaces dry, thereby reducing weed growth.
*   **Disease Management:** While overhead sprinklers can sometimes increase humidity and risk of foliar diseases if applied late in the day, micro-sprinklers and drip systems apply water directly to the soil, keeping foliage dry and reducing disease incidence. If using overhead sprinklers, irrigate in the morning to allow foliage to dry quickly.
*   **Soil Health:** Prevents soil erosion and maintains better soil structure compared to flood irrigation.

**Recommendation:** For optimal water management and yield in French Bean, especially in Haryana's diverse climatic conditions, adopting micro-sprinkler or drip irrigation systems is highly advisable. Monitor soil moisture levels using tensiometers or soil moisture sensors to apply water precisely when and where it is needed, based on crop evapotranspiration.
