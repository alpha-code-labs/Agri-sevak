As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned conditions in French Bean (common bean) in Haryana:

### Control of Scab in French Bean

French Bean Scab, caused by the fungus *Elsinoë phaseoli*, can lead to significant yield losses. Symptoms include small, reddish-brown, sunken spots on pods, leaves, and stems.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Use certified disease-free seeds.
    *   Practice crop rotation with non-host crops for at least 2-3 years.
    *   Ensure good field sanitation by removing and destroying infected plant debris after harvest.
    *   Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day, to reduce leaf wetness periods.
    *   Maintain adequate plant spacing to improve air circulation.
*   **Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
    *   For preventive control or at the first sign of symptoms, spray with:
        *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP at 2.5 g/L of water.
        *   Alternatively, **Chlorothalonil** 75% WP at 2.0 g/L of water.
    *   Repeat sprays at 10-14 day intervals, depending on disease severity and weather conditions.

### Control of Canker in French Bean

The term "canker" in French Bean typically refers to sunken lesions on stems and pods caused by specific diseases, primarily bacterial blights and anthracnose.

**Control Measures:**

1.  **For Bacterial Blight (e.g., Common Bacterial Blight caused by *Xanthomonas campestris pv. phaseoli*), which causes canker-like lesions:**
    *   **Cultural Practices:**
        *   Use certified disease-free seeds, as the bacteria are seed-borne.
        *   Avoid working in fields when foliage is wet, as this can spread bacteria.
        *   Practice strict field sanitation and crop rotation.
    *   **Chemical Control (Bactericides/Fungicides with bactericidal action):**
        *   Spray with a combination of antibiotics: **Streptomycin sulphate 9% + Tetracycline hydrochloride 1% SP** at 6 g per 10 litres of water.
        *   Alternatively, **Copper oxychloride** 50% WP at 2.5-3.0 g/L of water can help suppress bacterial spread.
        *   Apply at the onset of symptoms and repeat as necessary, typically at 7-10 day intervals.

2.  **For Anthracnose (caused by *Colletotrichum lindemuthianum*), which also causes sunken, canker-like lesions on pods and stems:**
    *   **Cultural Practices:**
        *   Use certified disease-free seeds.
        *   Practice crop rotation and remove infected plant debris.
        *   Ensure good air circulation within the canopy.
    *   **Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
        *   Spray with:
            *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 0.5 g/L of water.
            *   Alternatively, **Mancozeb** 75% WP at 2.5 g/L of water.
            *   A combination product like **Carbendazim 12% + Mancozeb 63% WP** at 1.0-1.5 g/L of water can also be effective.
        *   Initiate sprays at the first sign of disease and continue at 10-14 day intervals, especially during humid conditions.

### Gummosis in French Bean

This is not known to affect French Bean. Gummosis is primarily a symptom of disease or stress in woody plants, such as fruit trees, where gum exudes from the bark.

### Lichen in French Bean

This is not known to affect French Bean. Lichens are symbiotic organisms (fungus and alga) that typically grow on inert surfaces like rocks, tree bark, or soil, and are not parasitic to herbaceous plants like French Bean. Their presence on plants usually indicates poor plant vigor or a very humid environment, but they do not directly harm the plant.
