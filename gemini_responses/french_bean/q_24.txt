As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, I must first clarify that French Bean (Rajma) is generally **recommended for direct sowing** rather than transplantation. This is primarily due to its sensitive root system, which can suffer from transplant shock, leading to stunted growth and reduced yields. However, if transplantation is deemed necessary, for instance, to get an early start or for specific protected cultivation systems, the following guidelines should be adhered to with utmost care to minimize stress.

### Ideal Transplantation Time, Distance, and Process for French Bean

**1. Transplantation Time (for Haryana):**
French beans are warm-season crops, sensitive to frost and extreme heat.
*   **Spring-Summer Crop:**
    *   **February to March:** This window allows the crop to establish before the intense summer heat and avoids winter frosts.
*   **Monsoon/Autumn Crop:**
    *   **July to August:** Planting during the monsoon ensures adequate moisture for germination and early growth, with harvesting before the onset of cooler temperatures.
    *   **September:** For a late autumn crop, though yields might be affected by early winter chills.

**2. Transplantation Distance:**
The spacing depends on the growth habit (bush type is more common for French beans).
*   **Bush Type French Bean:**
    *   **Row-to-Row:** 45-60 cm
    *   **Plant-to-Plant:** 10-15 cm

**3. Transplantation Process (with precautions):**
If transplantation is chosen, extreme care is crucial to minimize root disturbance.

*   **Nursery Raising:**
    *   **Container Choice:** Sow seeds in individual biodegradable pots (e.g., peat pots, paper pots, or coco-peat blocks) or root trainers. This is critical to avoid root disturbance during transplanting. Avoid open nursery beds.
    *   **Media:** Use a well-drained, sterile potting mix.
    *   **Sowing:** Sow 1-2 seeds per pot at a depth of 2-3 cm.
    *   **Watering:** Keep the nursery moist but not waterlogged.

*   **Seedling Age:**
    *   Transplant very young seedlings, ideally when they have developed **2-3 true leaves**, typically 2-3 weeks after sowing. Older seedlings are more prone to transplant shock.

*   **Hardening Off:**
    *   Gradually expose seedlings to outdoor conditions (reduced watering, increased sunlight) for 3-5 days before transplanting to acclimate them to the field environment.

*   **Field Preparation:**
    *   Prepare the field thoroughly with good tilth.
    *   Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure or compost.
    *   Ensure adequate moisture in the field before transplanting.

*   **Transplanting Technique:**
    *   **Timing:** Transplant in the late afternoon or early evening to allow seedlings to recover overnight without direct harsh sunlight.
    *   **Handling:** Carefully place the entire biodegradable pot (or the root ball from root trainers) into the prepared planting hole. Ensure the top of the root ball is level with the soil surface.
    *   **Planting Depth:** Plant at the same depth as they were in the nursery. Avoid burying the stem too deep or exposing the roots.
    *   **Firming:** Gently firm the soil around the base of each seedling to ensure good root-to-soil contact and remove air pockets.

*   **Post-Transplantation Care:**
    *   **Immediate Watering:** Water immediately and thoroughly after transplanting to settle the soil and reduce transplant shock.
    *   **Shading (Optional):** In very hot or sunny conditions, temporary shading for the first few days can help seedlings establish.
    *   **Monitoring:** Regularly monitor seedlings for signs of stress (wilting, yellowing) and provide appropriate care.
