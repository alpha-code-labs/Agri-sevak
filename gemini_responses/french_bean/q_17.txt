Organic manures are crucial for improving soil health, fertility, and microbial activity, which are vital for healthy French Bean cultivation in Haryana. Here are the recommended doses:

*   **Farmyard Manure (FYM):**
    *   **Dose:** 10-15 tonnes per acre.
    *   **Application:** Incorporate well into the soil during land preparation, at least 2-3 weeks before sowing French Bean seeds. This allows for proper decomposition and nutrient release.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 tonnes per acre.
    *   **Application:** Can be applied during land preparation and incorporated into the soil, similar to FYM. Alternatively, it can be applied as a top dressing around the plants at critical growth stages (e.g., 20-30 days after sowing) and lightly incorporated.

*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract based bio-stimulant):**
    *   **Dose (Foliar Spray):** 2-3 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Dose (Soil Application/Drench):** 1-2 litres per acre, mixed with sufficient water.
    *   **Application:**
        *   **Foliar Spray:** Apply as a foliar spray at critical growth stages:
            *   First spray: 20-25 days after sowing (vegetative growth stage).
            *   Second spray: At flowering initiation.
            *   Third spray: At pod development stage.
        *   **Soil Application:** Can be applied as a drench around the root zone or through drip irrigation at similar critical growth stages.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always ensure the FYM is well-decomposed (at least 3-6 months old) to avoid nutrient immobilization and pest issues.
*   The exact doses can be fine-tuned based on soil test reports, which provide specific information on your soil's nutrient status and organic carbon content. HAU recommends regular soil testing for optimal nutrient management.
