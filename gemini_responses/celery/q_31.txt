As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling physical damage in Celery:

1.  **Fruit bursting:**
    This is not known to affect Celery. Celery is a stalk vegetable, not a fruit.

2.  **Leaf burning/melting:**
    Leaf burning (sunscald) and melting (due to heat stress, high humidity, or tip burn) can affect celery. Control measures primarily involve cultural practices:
    *   **Shade Management:** During periods of intense sunlight and high temperatures in Haryana, consider using shade nets (e.g., 30-50% shade) over the crop. This reduces direct solar radiation and lowers canopy temperature, preventing scorching.
    *   **Consistent Irrigation:** Maintain adequate and consistent soil moisture. Water stress, especially during hot periods, makes plants more susceptible to leaf burn. Drip irrigation is highly recommended to deliver water directly to the root zone efficiently.
    *   **Proper Spacing:** Ensure optimal plant spacing to allow for good air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce humidity and heat buildup around the leaves, minimizing the risk of melting.
    *   **Nutrient Balance:** Ensure balanced nutrition, particularly adequate calcium, to prevent tip burn, which can manifest as browning or burning of leaf margins.
        *   If calcium deficiency is suspected, a foliar application can be considered:
            *   **Calcium nitrate** (1-2 g/L water, applied as a foliar spray).

3.  **Hardness in fruit:**
    This is not known to affect Celery. Celery is a stalk vegetable, not a fruit. (Note: If you are referring to "fibrousness" or "hardness" in celery stalks, this is a quality issue primarily managed by selecting appropriate varieties, ensuring consistent water supply, and harvesting at the correct maturity stage.)
