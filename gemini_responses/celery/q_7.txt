As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm the following regarding the diseases mentioned for Celery cultivation in Haryana:

*   **Dieback:** This is not known to affect Celery. Dieback is a general term for the progressive death of twigs and branches, typically associated with woody plants. Celery is an herbaceous plant and does not develop twigs or branches in this manner.
*   **Twig blight:** This is not known to affect Celery. Celery is an herbaceous plant and does not possess "twigs."
*   **Tikka disease:** This is not known to affect Celery. Tikka disease is a specific leaf spot disease primarily affecting groundnut (peanut), caused by *Cercospora arachidicola* and *Phaeoisariopsis personata*. It does not affect Celery.

For effective disease management in Celery, it is crucial to correctly identify the specific diseases affecting the crop. Common diseases in Celery include Early Blight (*Cercospora apii*), Late Blight (*Septoria apiicola*), and Bacterial Blight (*Pseudomonas cichorii*). If you are observing symptoms that you believe might be related to these conditions, please provide more specific details or images for accurate diagnosis and recommended control measures.
