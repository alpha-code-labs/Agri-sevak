As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following fertilizer schedule for Celery cultivation in Haryana. Please note that these are general recommendations, and a soil test is always the most accurate way to determine specific nutrient requirements for your field. Celery is a heavy feeder, especially of Nitrogen and Potassium.

**General NPK Target for Celery:**
For optimal yield and quality, aim for approximately:
*   Nitrogen (N): 120-150 kg/acre
*   Phosphorus (P2O5): 60-80 kg/acre
*   Potassium (K2O): 120-150 kg/acre
*   Sulphur (S): 20-30 kg/acre

**Recommended Fertilizer Doses:**

**1. Basal Application (at transplanting):**
Apply these fertilizers and mix them well into the soil before transplanting celery seedlings.

*   **DAP (Di-Ammonium Phosphate):** 150 kg/acre
    *   *(Provides approximately 27 kg N and 69 kg P2O5)*
*   **Potash (Muriate of Potash - MOP):** 100 kg/acre
    *   *(Provides approximately 60 kg K2O)*
*   **Sulphur (Bentonite Sulphur 90%):** 20 kg/acre
    *   *(Provides approximately 18 kg S)*

    *Alternatively for Phosphorus and Sulphur:*
    *   If **DAP** is not used, or to supplement P and S:
        *   **SSP (Single Super Phosphate):** 400-500 kg/acre
            *   *(Provides approximately 64-80 kg P2O5 and 44-55 kg S)*
            *   *Note: If using SSP, adjust **DAP** and **Sulphur** quantities accordingly to avoid over-application.*

*   **NPK (Complex Granular Fertilizer, e.g., 12:32:16):**
    *   If you prefer to use a complex NPK fertilizer as basal: 200-250 kg/acre
    *   *(This will provide a portion of N, P, and K. You will need to adjust subsequent **Urea** and **Potash** top dressings to meet the remaining nutrient requirements based on the NPK ratio used.)*

**2. Top Dressing:**
These applications should be done by broadcasting the fertilizer near the plant base and lightly incorporating it into the soil, followed by irrigation.

*   **First Top Dressing (30-45 days after transplanting):**
    *   **Urea:** 150 kg/acre
        *   *(Provides approximately 69 kg N)*
    *   **Potash (Muriate of Potash - MOP):** 75 kg/acre
        *   *(Provides approximately 45 kg K2O)*

*   **Second Top Dressing (60-75 days after transplanting, if needed for longer duration varieties or to boost growth):**
    *   **Urea:** 100 kg/acre
        *   *(Provides approximately 46 kg N)*
    *   **Potash (Muriate of Potash - MOP):** 75 kg/acre
        *   *(Provides approximately 45 kg K2O)*

**3. Foliar Application (for supplemental nutrition):**
These nano-fertilizers and water-soluble NPK can be sprayed on the foliage for quick nutrient uptake, especially during critical growth stages or nutrient deficiency.

*   **Nano-Urea:** 2-4 ml/L of water
    *   Apply at 30-45 days after transplanting and again at 60-75 days after transplanting, or as needed based on plant vigor.
*   **Nano-DAP:** 2-4 ml/L of water
    *   Apply during early vegetative growth (e.g., 20-30 days after transplanting) and again during rapid growth phase.
*   **NPK (Water Soluble, e.g., 19:19:19 or 20:20:20):** 5 g/L of water
    *   Apply at 30-45 days after transplanting and again at 60-75 days after transplanting, or as a general booster.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Soil Testing:** Always conduct a soil test before planting to get precise recommendations tailored to your field's nutrient status.
*   **Irrigation:** Ensure adequate irrigation after fertilizer application, especially for basal and top-dressed granular fertilizers, to facilitate nutrient dissolution and uptake.
*   **Organic Matter:** Incorporating farmyard manure (FYM) or compost (20-25 tonnes/acre) during land preparation significantly improves soil health and nutrient availability, reducing the need for synthetic fertilizers.
