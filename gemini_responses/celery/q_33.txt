As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an integrated approach for weed management in celery, combining cultural practices with judicious use of CIBRC-approved herbicides. Celery is a cool-season crop, and effective weed control is vital, especially during its early growth stages, as it is a poor competitor against weeds.

All the weeds you mentioned (Broadleaf, Narrowleaf, Amarbail, Bathu, Congress grass, Orobanche, and Phalaris minor) are known to affect celery cultivation and can significantly reduce yield if not managed properly.

**Integrated Weed Management Strategy:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Field Preparation:** Thorough ploughing and harrowing before planting help in uprooting and burying weed seeds.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate celery with crops that have different weed flora or allow for different weed control methods.
    *   **Certified Seeds:** Use clean, certified celery seeds free from weed seeds.
    *   **Timely Sowing:** Sowing at the optimal time allows celery to establish quickly and compete better with weeds.
    *   **Inter-cultivation/Manual Weeding:** This is highly effective, especially in the early stages. Perform 2-3 manual weedings at 20-30 and 40-50 days after transplanting/sowing.
    *   **Mulching:** Organic mulches (straw, dry leaves) can suppress weed growth, conserve moisture, and regulate soil temperature.
    *   **Solarization:** For severe weed problems, especially parasitic weeds like Orobanche, soil solarization during the hot summer months before planting can be effective in reducing the weed seed bank.

2.  **Chemical Control (Use CIBRC approved technical chemicals only):**

    **A. Pre-emergence Herbicides (Apply within 3 days of transplanting or before celery emergence if direct-seeded):**
    These herbicides form a chemical barrier in the soil, preventing weed seeds from germinating.
    *   For general broadleaf and narrowleaf annual weeds:
        *   **Pendimethalin** @ 1.0 kg/acre in 200-300 L of water.
        *   **Oxyfluorfen** @ 0.2-0.3 kg/acre in 200-300 L of water.

    **B. Post-emergence Herbicides (Apply when weeds are young and actively growing, typically 2-4 leaf stage):**
    These are primarily for narrowleaf (grassy) weeds. Celery is a broadleaf crop, so grass-specific herbicides are generally safe.
    *   For narrowleaf weeds like **Phalaris minor** and other annual grasses:
        *   **Fluazifop-P-butyl** @ 0.25-0.5 L/acre in 200-300 L of water.
        *   **Quizalofop-ethyl** @ 0.25-0.5 L/acre in 200-300 L of water.
        *   **Sethoxydim** @ 0.5-1.0 L/acre in 200-300 L of water.

    **C. Specific Considerations for Parasitic Weeds:**

    *   **Amarbail (Cuscuta spp.):**
        *   Prevention is key. Use clean seeds and avoid bringing contaminated soil/plant material into the field.
        *   Pre-emergence application of **Pendimethalin** can offer some suppression.
        *   Manual removal of *Amarbail* strands immediately upon appearance, before they attach to celery, is critical. Remove affected celery plants if infestation is severe to prevent spread.
        *   Deep ploughing after harvest can bury *Cuscuta* seeds.

    *   **Orobanche (Broomrape):**
        *   This is a highly challenging parasitic weed.
        *   **Prevention:** Avoid planting celery in fields with a history of *Orobanche* infestation.
        *   **Manual Removal:** Carefully remove *Orobanche* spikes before they flower and set seeds. This is labor-intensive but crucial to reduce the seed bank.
        *   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate with non-host crops (e.g., cereals like wheat, maize) for several years.
        *   **Soil Solarization:** Effective in reducing *Orobanche* seed bank in the soil.

**Important Precautions:**
*   Always read and follow the label instructions for any herbicide.
*   Use the correct dosage and spray volume.
*   Ensure uniform spray coverage.
*   Avoid spraying during windy conditions to prevent drift.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).
*   Consult with local agricultural extension specialists for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and current CIBRC guidelines.
