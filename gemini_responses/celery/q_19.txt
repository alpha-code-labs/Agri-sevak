Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm that Macro-nutrient deficiencies (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium) are common issues that can significantly impact Celery yield and quality. Addressing these deficiencies effectively requires a scientific approach, ideally starting with a soil test to determine the exact nutrient status of your field.

Here's how to address these deficiencies in Celery:

**1. General Approach and Soil Testing:**
Before applying any fertilizers, it is highly recommended to conduct a soil test through a reputable lab (like HAU's soil testing lab). This will provide precise information on the existing nutrient levels and soil pH, allowing for tailored recommendations and preventing over-application, which can be detrimental and uneconomical.

**2. Addressing Nitrogen (N) Deficiency:**
Nitrogen deficiency in celery typically manifests as a general yellowing or pale green color of older leaves, stunted growth, and reduced vigor.

*   **Recommended Fertilizers and Application:**
    *   **Basal Application (at planting):** Apply a portion of Nitrogen along with Phosphorus and Potassium.
    *   **Top-dressing:** Nitrogen is highly mobile and prone to leaching, so it's best applied in split doses during the growth cycle.
    *   For general recommendations without a soil test, a total of 100-150 kg Nitrogen per acre is often suggested for celery, split into 2-3 applications.
    *   **Sources:**
        *   **Urea:** Apply 100-150 kg **Urea** per acre in split doses. For example, 30-50 kg **Urea** at planting, followed by 30-50 kg **Urea** at 3-4 weeks after transplanting, and another 30-50 kg **Urea** at 6-8 weeks after transplanting.
        *   **Calcium Ammonium Nitrate (CAN):** Can be used as an alternative, providing both nitrogen and calcium. Apply 150-225 kg **Calcium Ammonium Nitrate** per acre in split doses.
    *   **Foliar Application (for quick relief in severe cases):**
        *   Dissolve 10-20 g of **Urea** per liter of water and spray on foliage, preferably in the morning or late afternoon. Repeat every 7-10 days if needed.

**3. Addressing Phosphorus (P) Deficiency:**
Phosphorus deficiency in celery often leads to stunted growth, dark green or purplish discoloration of older leaves (especially on the undersides), and poor root development.

*   **Recommended Fertilizers and Application:**
    *   Phosphorus is relatively immobile in the soil, so it should be applied as a basal dose and thoroughly incorporated into the soil before planting.
    *   For general recommendations without a soil test, a total of 40-60 kg P2O5 per acre is often suggested.
    *   **Sources:**
        *   **Single Super Phosphate (SSP):** Apply 250-375 kg **Single Super Phosphate** per acre as a basal application, mixed well into the soil.
        *   **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP):** Apply 85-130 kg **Diammonium Phosphate** per acre as a basal application, mixed well into the soil. (Note: DAP also contains Nitrogen, so adjust Urea application accordingly).

**4. Addressing Potassium (K) Deficiency:**
Potassium deficiency in celery typically causes yellowing and browning (scorching) of leaf margins, especially on older leaves. Stalks may become weak, and the plant's overall resistance to stress and diseases can decrease.

*   **Recommended Fertilizers and Application:**
    *   Potassium can be applied as a basal dose and also as a top-dressing, similar to Nitrogen, especially on sandy soils prone to leaching.
    *   For general recommendations without a soil test, a total of 80-120 kg K2O per acre is often suggested.
    *   **Sources:**
        *   **Muriate of Potash (Potassium Chloride):** Apply 130-200 kg **Muriate of Potash** per acre. This can be split, with half applied basally and the remaining half as a top-dressing at 4-6 weeks after transplanting.
        *   **Sulphate of Potash (Potassium Sulphate):** Apply 160-240 kg **Sulphate of Potash** per acre. This is preferred in areas where chloride sensitivity is a concern, though celery is generally tolerant.
    *   **Foliar Application (for quick relief in severe cases):**
        *   Dissolve 5-10 g of **Potassium Sulphate** per liter of water and spray on foliage. Repeat every 7-10 days if needed.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Integrated Nutrient Management (INM):** Always combine chemical fertilizers with organic manures like Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost (10-15 tonnes per acre) to improve soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability over the long term.
*   **Irrigation:** Ensure proper irrigation practices. Both waterlogging and drought stress can hinder nutrient uptake.
*   **Soil pH:** Celery prefers a slightly acidic to neutral soil pH (6.0-7.0). Extreme pH values can lock up nutrients, making them unavailable to the plant even if present in the soil.
*   **Timing:** Apply fertilizers at appropriate growth stages to maximize uptake and efficiency.
