As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the use of growth regulators/hormones and micronutrients in celery cultivation in Haryana:

*   **Ethephon** (commonly known by brand names like Ethrel)
    **Ethephon** is generally not recommended as a growth regulator for beneficial purposes in celery cultivation in Haryana. Its primary effects, such as promoting ripening or senescence, are usually undesirable for the marketable part of celery (petioles). Therefore, specific recommendations for its use as a growth promoter in celery are not available from HAU.

*   **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid** (commonly known as 2,4-D)
    **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid** is a synthetic auxin primarily known and used as a broadleaf herbicide. Its application to celery, which is a broadleaf crop, is highly detrimental and can cause severe phytotoxicity, deformities, or even plant death. Therefore, its use as a growth regulator in celery is strictly not recommended by HAU.

*   **Boron**
    Boron is an essential micronutrient for celery, crucial for cell wall formation, sugar transport, and overall plant health. It is not classified as a growth regulator or hormone in the same manner as ethephon or 2,4-D. Deficiency can lead to "cracked stem" disorder and reduced yield. Recommendations for Boron application are typically based on soil test results.

    If a Boron deficiency is indicated or suspected:
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Apply **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (e.g., Solubor) at a concentration of 0.5-1 g/L of water.
        *   Alternatively, apply **Sodium tetraborate decahydrate** (e.g., Borax) at a concentration of 1-2 g/L of water.
        *   Spray 2-3 times during the growing season, starting 3-4 weeks after transplanting, at 15-20 day intervals.
    *   **Soil Application (Pre-planting or at planting):**
        *   Apply **Sodium tetraborate decahydrate** (e.g., Borax) at a rate of 1-2 kg/acre, mixed thoroughly with the soil, especially in areas known for Boron deficiency. This should be done based on soil test recommendations to avoid toxicity, as Boron has a narrow range between deficiency and toxicity.
