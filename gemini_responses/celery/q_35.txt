Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, I can provide you with the scientifically verified information regarding the maturity signs, harvesting time, and cutting process for Celery (Apium graveolens) suitable for cultivation in Haryana.

### Maturity Signs for Celery

Celery is ready for harvest when it exhibits the following characteristics:

*   **Stalk Development:** The stalks are firm, crisp, and well-developed, typically reaching a height of 15-25 cm (6-10 inches) or more, depending on the variety and market preference.
*   **Compactness:** The plant forms a compact, upright bunch of stalks.
*   **Color:** The outer stalks are a healthy, vibrant green. For blanched varieties, the inner stalks should be pale green to creamy white.
*   **Absence of Bolting:** There should be no signs of a flower stalk emerging from the center of the plant, which indicates bolting and can make the stalks tough and bitter.
*   **Absence of Yellowing:** The outer leaves and stalks should not show significant yellowing or signs of senescence.

### Harvesting Time for Celery

*   **Duration:** Celery is typically ready for harvest 90-120 days after transplanting, depending on the specific variety, prevailing climatic conditions, and cultural practices.
*   **Optimal Conditions:** Harvest when the stalks are tender, crisp, and have achieved the desired size and color.
*   **Time of Day:** The best time to harvest celery is in the early morning hours when temperatures are cool, and the stalks are turgid (full of water). This helps maintain crispness and extends shelf life.

### Cutting Process for Celery

There are two primary methods for harvesting celery:

1.  **Whole Plant Harvest:**
    *   **Method:** Use a sharp, clean knife. Cut the entire plant at its base, just below the soil line. Ensure the cut is clean and smooth to minimize damage.
    *   **Benefit:** This method yields the entire head of celery, keeping all stalks intact.
    *   **Post-Harvest:** Immediately after cutting, remove any damaged, yellowed, or diseased outer leaves.

2.  **Cut-and-Come-Again (Outer Stalk Harvest):**
    *   **Method:** For a continuous supply, select the largest, outermost stalks. Using a sharp knife, cut these individual stalks at their base, close to the main stem, leaving the inner stalks and the heart of the plant to continue growing.
    *   **Benefit:** This allows for multiple harvests from a single plant over an extended period.
    *   **Consideration:** This method is more labor-intensive but can be beneficial for home gardens or niche markets.

**General Advice:**
*   Always use clean and sharp tools to prevent injury to the plant and reduce the risk of disease transmission.
*   Handle harvested celery carefully to avoid bruising, which can lead to spoilage.
*   After harvesting, celery should be cooled rapidly and stored under high humidity to maintain its crispness and quality.
