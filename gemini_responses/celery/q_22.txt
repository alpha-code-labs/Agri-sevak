As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), here are the recommended cultivation practices for Celery (Apium graveolens) in Haryana:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   Celery is primarily grown by **transplanting seedlings**. Direct sowing is generally not recommended due to the small seed size, slow germination, and the delicate nature of young seedlings, which makes them highly susceptible to environmental stresses and weed competition.
    *   **Nursery Raising:** Seeds should be sown in well-prepared nursery beds or trays. The nursery medium should have a fine tilth and be enriched with well-decomposed farmyard manure.
    *   **Transplanting:** Seedlings are typically ready for transplanting when they are 8-10 weeks old, have developed 4-5 true leaves, and are approximately 10-15 cm tall.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   **For Nursery Sowing:** Celery seeds are very small and require light for germination. They should be surface-sown or covered very lightly with a thin layer (approximately 0.5 cm) of fine soil or sand.
    *   **For Transplanting:** Seedlings should be planted at the same depth they were growing in the nursery. Avoid planting too deep, as this can lead to stem rot.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   For optimal growth and blanching, a spacing of **30 cm between rows** and **15-20 cm between plants** within a row is generally recommended. This allows for adequate air circulation and light penetration.

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   An average seed dose of **150-200 grams per acre** is sufficient to raise enough seedlings for one acre of land. This accounts for potential germination losses and ensures a healthy stand.
