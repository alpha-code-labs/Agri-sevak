As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm the following regarding the rust diseases you've mentioned in Celery:

*   **Black Rust (Stem Rust):** This is not known to affect Celery.
*   **Brown Rust (Leaf Rust):** This is not known to affect Celery.
*   **Yellow Rust (Stripe Rust):** This is not known to affect Celery.
*   **White Rust:** This is not known to affect Celery.
*   **Red Rust:** This is not known to affect Celery.

The specific rust diseases you have listed are primarily known to affect cereal crops or other plant families, or are not true rust fungi (Basidiomycota). Therefore, control measures for these specific rusts are not applicable to Celery.
