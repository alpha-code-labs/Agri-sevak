As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm the following regarding your query about Celery pests:

*   **Ber fly (*Carpomyia vesuviana*)**: This is not known to affect Celery. The Ber fly is a highly host-specific pest primarily attacking Ber (*Ziziphus mauritiana*) and related *Ziziphus* species.

*   **Fruit fly (e.g., *Bactrocera* species)**: This is not known to affect Celery. Major fruit fly species that cause significant economic damage to fruits and some fruiting vegetables (like cucurbits) are not known to infest Celery plants.
