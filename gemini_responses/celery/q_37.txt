Celery, like any cultivated crop, can be susceptible to damage from various wild animals prevalent in Haryana, including nilgai (blue bull), wild boar, monkeys, and rodents. Protecting your celery crop requires a multi-pronged and consistent approach.

Here are scientifically verified methods to protect Celery from wild animals:

*   **Physical Barriers:**
    *   **Fencing:**
        *   **Barbed Wire Fencing:** Install multiple strands (e.g., 5-7 strands) of barbed wire at varying heights, starting close to the ground and extending upwards to at least 1.5-2 meters. This can deter larger animals like nilgai and wild boar. Ensure posts are sturdy and well-maintained.
        *   **Mesh Fencing:** For protection against smaller animals such as rodents and monkeys, a strong mesh fence (e.g., chain-link or woven wire) with a small aperture size (e.g., 2.5-5 cm) can be installed. For comprehensive protection, this can be combined with barbed wire on top. Ensure the fence is buried slightly into the ground to prevent animals from digging underneath.
        *   **Electric Fencing:** A highly effective deterrent for most wild animals. It delivers a non-lethal shock that discourages animals from entering. Installation must adhere to safety standards and local regulations. Regular checks for shorts, proper grounding, and vegetation clearance around the fence are crucial for its effectiveness.

*   **Habitat Management:**
    *   **Weed and Bush Clearance:** Regularly clear weeds, bushes, and other dense vegetation from around the celery field and its periphery. This reduces hiding places and nesting sites for wild animals, making the area less attractive for shelter and foraging.
    *   **Sanitation:** Promptly remove any crop residues, fallen produce, or food waste from the field and its surroundings. Such organic matter can attract animals, especially rodents and wild boar.

*   **Scare Tactics and Deterrents:**
    *   **Human Presence:** Regular human activity in and around the field, especially during vulnerable periods (e.g., dawn, dusk, and night), can deter many animals.
    *   **Guard Dogs:** Trained guard dogs can be highly effective in patrolling the perimeter and scaring away wild animals. They provide a constant deterrent through their presence, barking, and scent.
    *   **Noise Makers:** Devices that produce loud noises (e.g., gas cannons, firecrackers, or even traditional drums) can temporarily scare animals. However, animals often habituate to constant noise, so varying the type, timing, and location of noise is important for sustained effectiveness.
    *   **Visual Deterrents:** Scarecrows, reflective tapes, or old CDs hung in the field can create movement and glints of light that may deter birds and some smaller animals. Their effectiveness is often short-lived due to habituation.

*   **Community-Based Approaches:**
    *   **Cooperative Protection:** Collaborate with neighboring farmers to implement protection measures across a larger contiguous area. This is often more effective than individual efforts, especially for highly mobile animals like nilgai and wild boar, as it creates a larger protected zone.
    *   **Reporting:** Report persistent wild animal damage to the local Forest Department or agricultural authorities. This can help in developing broader management strategies and potentially obtaining support for collective protection measures.

Regarding chemical repellents, there are currently no CIBRC-approved technical chemical names specifically recommended for deterring wild animals from celery crops in Haryana. Therefore, physical barriers and management practices remain the primary and most effective strategies.
