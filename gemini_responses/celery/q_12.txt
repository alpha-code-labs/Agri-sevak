Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding Scale insects and Mealybugs in Celery. These sucking pests can cause significant damage by feeding on plant sap, leading to stunted growth, yellowing, wilting, and even sooty mold development due to honeydew excretion. Effective management requires an integrated approach.

Here's how you can control Scale insects and Mealybugs in your Celery crop:

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategy:**

1.  **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your celery plants, especially the undersides of leaves, leaf axils, and stems, for the presence of these pests. Early detection is crucial for effective control.
2.  **Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
    *   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy heavily infested leaves or plant parts to reduce pest populations.
    *   **Water Spray:** For minor infestations, a strong jet of water can dislodge mealybugs and scale crawlers from the plants.
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the field free of weeds, as they can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation to break the pest life cycle.
    *   **Sanitation:** Remove crop residues after harvest to prevent pest carryover.

3.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Encourage natural enemies like ladybird beetles, lacewings, and parasitic wasps, which prey on or parasitize scale insects and mealybugs. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

4.  **Chemical Control (Use only when necessary and with caution):**
    When infestations are severe and cultural/biological methods are insufficient, chemical control may be required. Always ensure thorough spray coverage, especially targeting the undersides of leaves and protected areas where these pests hide. Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

    *   **For Scale Insects and Mealybugs:**
        *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at 1.25 - 1.5 ml per litre of water. This is an Insect Growth Regulator (IGR) effective against nymphs and crawlers.
        *   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:** Apply at 0.5 - 0.75 ml per litre of water. This is a systemic insecticide that moves both upwards and downwards in the plant, providing excellent control.
        *   **Flupyradifurone 200 SL:** Apply at 0.8 - 1.0 ml per litre of water. This is a systemic insecticide effective against a wide range of sucking pests.
        *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply at 0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water. This is a systemic insecticide effective against sucking pests.
        *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at 0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water. This is a systemic insecticide effective against sucking pests.
        *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at 0.5 - 1.0 ml per litre of water. This is a systemic insecticide widely used for sucking pest control.
        *   **Azadirachtin 1500 ppm:** Apply at 2.5 - 5 ml per litre of water. This botanical insecticide is effective against early stages and can be used for organic farming or as part of an IPM strategy.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always check the label for the recommended pre-harvest interval (PHI) for the chosen chemical to ensure the safety of your produce.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) like gloves, masks, and protective clothing while handling and spraying chemicals.
*   **Calibration:** Ensure your sprayer is properly calibrated to apply the correct dosage.
*   **Adjuvants:** Consider using a spreading agent (sticker/spreader) with your spray solution to improve coverage and penetration, especially for waxy pests like scales and mealybugs.
*   **Repeat Application:** Depending on the severity of the infestation and the life cycle of the pests, repeat applications may be necessary, following label instructions.
