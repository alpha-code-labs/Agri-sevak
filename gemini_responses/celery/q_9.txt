Mites, specifically Red spider mite (Tetranychus urticae) and Rust mite (Aculops pelekassi), are indeed known to affect Celery, causing significant damage if not managed effectively. As a Senior Agronomist, I recommend an integrated approach for their control.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies:**

1.  **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect celery plants, especially the undersides of leaves, for the presence of mites, their eggs, or characteristic damage (stippling, bronzing, webbing for spider mites; bronzing, russeting, distortion for rust mites). Early detection is crucial.
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Maintain good field hygiene by removing weeds, which can act as alternate hosts for mites.
    *   Ensure proper irrigation, as water stress and dusty conditions can favor mite outbreaks.
    *   Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush growth that is more attractive to mites.
3.  **Biological Control:** Encourage natural enemies like predatory mites (e.g., Amblyseius spp.), lacewings, and ladybugs by minimizing the use of broad-spectrum insecticides.

**Chemical Control (as per CIBRC approved technical chemicals for Haryana):**

When mite populations reach damaging levels, chemical intervention may be necessary. Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where mites often reside. Rotate different classes of miticides to prevent the development of resistance.

Here are some CIBRC approved technical chemical options:

*   **Abamectin 1.8% EC:** Apply at a rate of **0.3-0.5 ml/L** of water. This is effective against both spider mites and some eriophyid mites (like rust mites).
*   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** Apply at a rate of **0.4-0.5 ml/L** of water. This miticide provides excellent control of spider mites and has ovicidal (egg-killing) activity.
*   **Propargite 57% EC:** Apply at a rate of **1.5-2.0 ml/L** of water. This is a broad-spectrum miticide effective against a wide range of mite species.
*   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP:** Apply at a rate of **2.0-3.0 g/L** of water. Sulphur is a contact miticide effective against both spider mites and rust mites, particularly useful in early stages of infestation and in cooler weather. Avoid application during very hot conditions (above 30°C) as it can cause phytotoxicity.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the label instructions of the specific product you are using, including dosage, application method, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and safety precautions.
*   Ensure proper personal protective equipment (PPE) is used during mixing and application.
*   Consult your local agricultural extension office or HAU experts for the most current recommendations and specific product availability in your region of Haryana.
