As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified information regarding specialized practices for celery cultivation in Haryana:

### Specialized Practices in Celery

1.  **Pruning:**
    Specialized pruning practices, as understood for woody plants or some fruiting vegetables, are generally not applied to celery. However, for maintaining plant health and improving the quality of the edible petioles, it is a common practice to remove any yellowing, diseased, or damaged outer leaves. This helps in diverting the plant's energy towards the healthy inner stalks, improves air circulation, and can reduce the risk of fungal diseases.

2.  **Desuckering:**
    Celery plants do not produce suckers in the manner of many other crops. Therefore, desuckering is not a practice known to affect celery cultivation.

3.  **Mulching:**
    Mulching is a highly beneficial practice for celery cultivation in Haryana, especially given our climatic conditions. It helps in:
    *   **Moisture Retention:** Reduces evaporation from the soil surface, conserving water and reducing irrigation frequency.
    *   **Weed Suppression:** Forms a physical barrier that inhibits weed growth, reducing competition for nutrients and water.
    *   **Soil Temperature Regulation:** Keeps the soil cooler during hot periods and can provide some insulation during cooler periods.
    *   **Blanching:** For certain varieties, applying mulch (or earthing up) around the base of the stalks can help blanch them, making them more tender and less fibrous, and improving their flavour and appearance.

    **Recommended Mulch Materials and Application:**
    *   **Organic Mulches:** Straw, dried leaves, wood chips, or sugarcane trash are excellent choices. Apply a layer of 5-10 cm thickness around the base of the plants, ensuring it does not touch the crown directly to prevent rot.
    *   **Plastic Mulches:** Black or white plastic mulches can also be used. Black plastic is effective for weed control and warming the soil in cooler periods, while white plastic can help keep the soil cooler in hot conditions. Ensure proper irrigation systems (like drip irrigation) are in place under plastic mulches.

4.  **Grafting:**
    Grafting is not a practice known to affect celery. Celery is typically propagated from seeds or by crown division.

5.  **Pollination:**
    For commercial celery production aimed at harvesting stalks (petioles), pollination is not a specialized practice of concern, as the edible part is vegetative. Celery is a biennial plant grown as an annual for its stalks. If seed production were the objective (allowing the plant to bolt and flower in its second year), celery flowers are primarily self-pollinating, but insects (like bees) can aid in cross-pollination.
