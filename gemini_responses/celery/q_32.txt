Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding "drying up" in Celery, which can manifest as drying branches, leaves, fruits, and flowers. This is a common symptom that can be caused by various factors, including environmental stress, nutrient deficiencies, diseases, and pests. A precise diagnosis is crucial for effective management.

Here's a breakdown of potential causes and scientifically verified approaches to address them in Celery cultivation in Haryana:

**I. Initial Assessment and Cultural Practices (First Steps for Diagnosis and Prevention):**

1.  **Check Irrigation:**
    *   **Under-watering:** Celery is a water-intensive crop. Insufficient moisture, especially during hot periods, can lead to wilting and drying. Ensure consistent and adequate irrigation.
    *   **Over-watering/Waterlogging:** Excess water can lead to root rot, which impairs water and nutrient uptake, causing symptoms similar to drought stress (wilting and drying). Ensure good drainage in your fields.
    *   **Recommendation:** Maintain consistent soil moisture. Check soil at 5-10 cm depth; if dry, irrigate. Avoid waterlogging.

2.  **Soil Health and Nutrition:**
    *   **Nutrient Deficiencies:** Deficiencies of essential nutrients like Potassium (K), Calcium (Ca), or Boron (B) can cause marginal leaf scorch, tip burn, or overall plant decline leading to drying.
        *   **Potassium:** Yellowing and drying of leaf margins, starting from older leaves.
        *   **Calcium:** "Black heart" (browning of young heart leaves) or tip burn, which can lead to secondary infections and drying.
        *   **Boron:** Stunted growth, brittle petioles, and internal browning.
    *   **Recommendation:** Conduct a soil test to identify specific deficiencies. Apply balanced fertilizers based on soil test recommendations. For Calcium deficiency, foliar sprays of calcium nitrate (e.g., 5 g/L) can be beneficial. For Boron, foliar sprays of borax (e.g., 2 g/L) can be applied.

3.  **Environmental Stress:**
    *   **High Temperatures and Low Humidity:** Can cause excessive transpiration, leading to wilting and drying, especially if water supply is insufficient.
    *   **Wind Burn:** Strong winds can desiccate plants.
    *   **Recommendation:** Provide adequate irrigation during hot, dry, and windy periods. Consider windbreaks if severe.

**II. Disease Management:**

Several diseases can cause drying symptoms in Celery:

1.  **Fusarium Wilt/Yellows (*Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. apii*):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Yellowing of outer leaves, often on one side of the plant, followed by wilting and drying. Vascular discoloration (browning) can be observed in the petioles and crown.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Use resistant varieties.
        *   Practice long crop rotations (at least 4-5 years) with non-host crops.
        *   Ensure good field sanitation.
        *   **Chemical Control (as drench or seed treatment):**
            *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 1-2 kg/acre as a soil drench or 2 g/kg seed for seed treatment.
            *   **Propiconazole** 25% EC at 1 ml/L as a soil drench.

2.  **Early Blight (*Cercospora apii*) and Late Blight (*Septoria apiicola*):**
    *   **Symptoms:**
        *   **Early Blight:** Small, circular, yellowish-brown spots with a distinct halo, often on older leaves. Spots enlarge, coalesce, and can cause leaves to yellow and dry up.
        *   **Late Blight:** Small, angular, water-soaked spots that turn brown/black, often with tiny black dots (pycnidia) visible within the spots. Severe infection leads to leaf yellowing, browning, and drying.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Use disease-free seeds.
        *   Ensure proper plant spacing for good air circulation.
        *   Remove and destroy infected plant debris.
        *   **Chemical Control (Foliar Sprays):**
            *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP at 2.5 g/L of water.
            *   **Chlorothalonil** 75% WP at 2 g/L of water.
            *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC at 0.5-1 ml/L of water.
            *   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent resistance.

3.  **Sclerotinia Rot (White Mold/Pink Rot) (*Sclerotinia sclerotiorum*):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Water-soaked lesions at the base of petioles or crown, often covered with white, cottony fungal growth. Infected tissues become soft and watery, leading to wilting and collapse of the entire plant, which then dries up. Black, hard sclerotia may be visible.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Deep plowing to bury sclerotia.
        *   Crop rotation with non-host crops (e.g., cereals).
        *   Ensure good air circulation and avoid excessive humidity.
        *   **Chemical Control (as drench or foliar spray targeting the base):**
            *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 1-2 kg/acre as a soil drench or 2 g/L as a spray.
            *   **Propiconazole** 25% EC at 1 ml/L as a soil drench or spray.

4.  **Bacterial Blights (*Pseudomonas syringae pv. apii*, *Xanthomonas campestris pv. apii*):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Small, angular, water-soaked spots on leaves that turn brown/black. Spots may coalesce, leading to large necrotic areas and drying of leaves.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Use disease-free seeds.
        *   Avoid overhead irrigation, which can spread bacteria.
        *   Remove and destroy infected plants.
        *   **Chemical Control (Foliar Sprays):**
            *   **Copper oxychloride** 50% WP at 2.5-3 g/L of water.

**III. Pest Management:**

1.  **Nematodes (Root-Knot Nematodes - *Meloidogyne* spp.):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Nematodes attack roots, causing galls (swellings) that impair water and nutrient uptake. This leads to stunted growth, yellowing, wilting, and drying of the foliage, especially during stress periods.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Crop rotation with non-host crops (e.g., marigolds, cereals).
        *   Soil solarization during hot summer months can reduce nematode populations.
        *   Use nematode-resistant varieties if available.
        *   **Chemical Control (Soil Application/Drench):**
            *   **Fluopyram** 17.7% SC at 625 ml/acre as a soil drench or drip application.

2.  **Sucking Pests (Aphids, Leafhoppers, Spider Mites):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Severe infestations can cause direct feeding damage, leading to yellowing, curling, stunting, and eventually drying of leaves. Spider mites cause stippling and fine webbing, leading to bronzing and drying.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Regular monitoring of plants.
        *   Use yellow sticky traps for monitoring and mass trapping.
        *   Encourage natural enemies (e.g., ladybugs, lacewings).
        *   **Chemical Control (Foliar Sprays):**
            *   For Aphids/Leafhoppers: **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL at 0.5 ml/L of water or **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG at 0.2 g/L of water.
            *   For Spider Mites: **Fenpyroximate** 5% EC at 1 ml/L of water.

**Important Note:**
It is highly recommended to bring a sample of the affected Celery plants to the Department of Vegetable Science or Plant Pathology at HAU, Hisar, or your nearest Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) for an accurate diagnosis. This will ensure the most effective and targeted management strategy for your specific field conditions.
