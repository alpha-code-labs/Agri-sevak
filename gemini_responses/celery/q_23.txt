As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified seed and soil treatment processes for Celery cultivation in Haryana to manage common diseases and pests:

### Seed Treatment Process for Celery

Seed treatment is crucial for protecting young Celery seedlings from seed-borne diseases like Septoria Blight (*Septoria apiicola*), Fusarium Yellows (*Fusarium oxysporum* f. sp. *apii*), and early-stage damping-off caused by pathogens like *Pythium* spp. and *Rhizoctonia solani*.

**Process:**

1.  **Preparation:** Ensure seeds are clean and dry.
2.  **Application:** Mix the recommended fungicide thoroughly with the Celery seeds. The goal is to achieve a uniform coating on all seed surfaces. This can be done in a seed treating drum, a plastic bag, or a suitable container by shaking vigorously.
3.  **Drying (if wet treatment):** If a wet slurry treatment is used, allow the seeds to air dry in the shade before sowing to prevent clumping and ensure proper flow during planting.
4.  **Sowing:** Sow the treated seeds immediately or store them in a cool, dry place for a short period.

**Recommended Chemicals and Dosages:**

*   For broad-spectrum protection against seed-borne fungi and damping-off:
    *   **Carbendazim 50% WP:** 2-3 g per kg of Celery seed.
    *   **Thiram 75% WS:** 2.5-3 g per kg of Celery seed.
    *   *(These can be used individually or in combination for enhanced protection, depending on specific disease history.)*

### Soil Treatment Process for Celery

Soil treatment aims to control soil-borne diseases such as damping-off, Fusarium wilt, Sclerotinia rot (*Sclerotinia sclerotiorum*), and nematodes that can severely impact Celery growth and yield.

**Process:**

**1. For Nursery Beds (Pre-sowing/Post-sowing Drench):**
    *   **Purpose:** To protect seedlings from damping-off and early soil-borne fungal infections.
    *   **Application:** Prepare the fungicide solution as per the recommended dosage. Drench the nursery beds thoroughly immediately after sowing or transplanting, ensuring the solution penetrates the root zone. Repeat if necessary, especially during periods conducive to disease development.

**Recommended Chemicals and Dosages for Nursery Drench:**

*   For control of *Fusarium* wilt and *Sclerotinia* rot:
    *   **Carbendazim 50% WP:** 1-2 g per litre of water.
*   For specific control of Oomycete pathogens like *Pythium* causing damping-off:
    *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride 72.2% SL:** 2-3 ml per litre of water.
    *   *(These can be used alternately or in combination if both types of pathogens are a concern.)*

**2. For Main Field (Pre-planting Soil Application):**
    *   **Purpose:** To reduce the population of soil-borne pests like nematodes and certain soil-borne fungi before transplanting Celery seedlings.
    *   **Application:** Broadcast the granular nematicide/insecticide evenly over the prepared field soil. Immediately incorporate it into the top 10-15 cm of soil using a rotavator or cultivator. This ensures the chemical is in the root zone and reduces volatilization.

**Recommended Chemicals and Dosages for Main Field Application:**

*   For control of nematodes and certain soil insects:
    *   **Fipronil 0.3% GR:** 10-15 kg per acre, incorporated into the soil before transplanting.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label for safe handling, application, and pre-harvest intervals.
*   Ensure proper safety gear (gloves, mask, protective clothing) is used during chemical application.
*   Rotate crops and maintain good field sanitation practices to minimize disease and pest build-up.
