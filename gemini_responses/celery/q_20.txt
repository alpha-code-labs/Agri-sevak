Namaste, Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU), Hisar, I understand the critical importance of balanced nutrition for optimal crop yield and quality. Micronutrient deficiencies can significantly impact celery production. The first and most crucial step in addressing any deficiency is a comprehensive **soil test** to accurately identify the specific nutrient lacking and its severity. This allows for precise and efficient application of corrective measures.

Here's how to address the specified micronutrient deficiencies in celery, based on scientifically verified practices suitable for Haryana's conditions:

### General Recommendations:
*   Always conduct a soil test to confirm the deficiency before applying any micronutrient.
*   Foliar applications are generally more effective for quick correction, especially for iron and manganese, as they bypass soil fixation issues.
*   Ensure good spray coverage for foliar applications.
*   Avoid over-application, as excessive micronutrients can be toxic to plants.

### Specific Micronutrient Deficiencies and Their Management:

1.  **Zinc (Zn) Deficiency:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, small and narrow leaves, interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, sometimes a "rosetting" appearance.
    *   **Correction:**
        *   **Soil Application (Pre-planting or at planting):**
            *   Apply **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (21% Zn) at 10-25 kg/acre.
            *   Alternatively, apply **Zinc sulphate monohydrate** (33% Zn) at 5-10 kg/acre.
        *   **Foliar Application (During active growth):**
            *   Spray a 0.5% solution of **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (5 g/L of water).
            *   Alternatively, spray a 0.1% solution of **Zinc EDTA** (1 g/L of water).
            *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, especially during early vegetative growth.

2.  **Iron (Fe) Deficiency (Ferrous Deficiency):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Pronounced interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, with veins remaining distinctly green. In severe cases, entire leaves may turn yellow or white.
    *   **Correction:**
        *   **Foliar Application (Most effective):**
            *   Spray a 0.5-1% solution of **Ferrous sulphate** (5-10 g/L of water).
            *   Alternatively, spray a 0.1-0.2% solution of **Iron EDTA** (1-2 g/L of water).
            *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 7-10 day intervals, focusing on young foliage.
        *   **Soil Application (Less effective in high pH soils):**
            *   If soil pH is suitable (below 7.0), **Ferrous sulphate** can be applied at 10-20 kg/acre. **Iron EDTA** is more effective in high pH soils at 2-5 kg/acre.

3.  **Boron (B) Deficiency:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, cracked stems (often referred to as "brown heart"), hollow petioles, brittle leaves, and internal browning of the stem base. Critical for celery quality.
    *   **Correction:**
        *   **Soil Application (Pre-planting):**
            *   Apply **Borax** (sodium tetraborate decahydrate) at 4-8 kg/acre.
            *   Alternatively, apply **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** at 2-4 kg/acre.
        *   **Foliar Application (During vegetative growth):**
            *   Spray a 0.1-0.2% solution of **Borax** (1-2 g/L of water).
            *   Alternatively, spray a 0.1% solution of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (1 g/L of water).
            *   Apply 1-2 sprays during the active growth phase, especially before the main stalk development.

4.  **Calcium (Ca) Deficiency:**
    *   **Symptoms:** "Tip burn" (browning and necrosis of young leaf tips and margins), stunted growth, poor storage quality, and susceptibility to diseases.
    *   **Correction:**
        *   **Foliar Application (Preventive and corrective):**
            *   Spray a 0.5-1% solution of **Calcium chloride** (5-10 g/L of water).
            *   Alternatively, spray a 0.5-1% solution of **Calcium nitrate** (5-10 g/L of water).
            *   Start spraying before symptoms appear, especially during rapid growth and head formation, applying 2-3 sprays at 7-10 day intervals.
        *   **Soil Application:**
            *   If soil test indicates low calcium, apply **Gypsum** (calcium sulphate dihydrate) at 200-500 kg/acre or **Calcium nitrate** at 50-100 kg/acre, depending on soil type and severity.

5.  **Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, with veins remaining green. Leaves may become brittle and develop reddish-purple tints in severe cases.
    *   **Correction:**
        *   **Foliar Application (Most effective for quick correction):**
            *   Spray a 0.5-1% solution of **Magnesium sulphate** (5-10 g/L of water).
            *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals.
        *   **Soil Application:**
            *   If severe deficiency, apply **Magnesium sulphate** at 10-20 kg/acre. If soil pH is low, dolomitic lime can also be considered.

6.  **Manganese (Mn) Deficiency:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, often with small necrotic (dead) spots, giving a mottled appearance. Growth may be stunted.
    *   **Correction:**
        *   **Foliar Application (Most effective):**
            *   Spray a 0.5% solution of **Manganese sulphate** (5 g/L of water).
            *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 7-10 day intervals, focusing on young leaves.
        *   **Soil Application (Less effective in high pH soils):**
            *   If soil pH is suitable, **Manganese sulphate** can be applied at 5-10 kg/acre.

**Important Note:** Always consult your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts with your soil test report for tailored recommendations specific to your farm's conditions.
