Celery (Apium graveolens) is a cool-season crop that can be successfully cultivated in Haryana with proper management. Here is the ideal transplantation information:

### Ideal Transplantation Time

For Haryana, the ideal time for transplanting celery seedlings is during the **late autumn to early winter** period. This allows the crop to establish and grow during the cooler months, avoiding the extreme heat of summer and the severe frost of peak winter.

*   **Nursery Sowing:** September to October
*   **Transplantation:** October to November

This timing ensures that the crop matures before the onset of very high temperatures, which can lead to bolting (premature flowering) and bitter stalks.

### Ideal Transplantation Distance

Proper spacing is crucial for good air circulation, light penetration, and optimal plant development, leading to better yield and quality.

*   **Row-to-Row Spacing:** 45-60 cm
*   **Plant-to-Plant Spacing:** 15-20 cm

This spacing allows for adequate growth of individual plants and facilitates inter-cultivation operations.

### Ideal Transplantation Process

The transplantation process involves several critical steps to ensure high survival rates and vigorous growth of celery seedlings.

1.  **Seedling Preparation:**
    *   Celery seeds are very small and slow to germinate. They are typically sown in a nursery bed or trays 8-10 weeks before the intended transplanting date.
    *   Ensure seedlings are healthy, sturdy, and have developed 4-6 true leaves, reaching a height of approximately 10-15 cm, before transplanting.
    *   **Hardening Off:** Gradually expose seedlings to outdoor conditions (reduced water, increased sunlight, cooler temperatures) for 7-10 days prior to transplanting. This helps them adapt to the field environment and reduces transplant shock.

2.  **Field Preparation:**
    *   Select a well-drained field with fertile, loamy soil. Celery prefers a soil pH between 6.0 and 7.0.
    *   Prepare the land thoroughly by ploughing and harrowing to achieve a fine tilth.
    *   Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost (20-25 tonnes/acre) during land preparation to enrich the soil.
    *   Form raised beds if soil drainage is an issue, or prepare flat beds according to the chosen spacing.

3.  **Transplanting:**
    *   Transplant seedlings preferably in the late afternoon or on a cloudy day to minimize transplant shock from direct sunlight.
    *   Carefully remove seedlings from the nursery bed or trays, ensuring minimal damage to the root system.
    *   Dig small holes at the recommended spacing (45-60 cm between rows and 15-20 cm between plants).
    *   Place each seedling in a hole, ensuring the root ball is covered with soil up to the base of the first true leaves. Avoid burying the crown too deeply, as this can lead to rot.
    *   Gently firm the soil around the base of each plant to ensure good root-to-soil contact.

4.  **Post-Transplantation Care:**
    *   **Immediate Watering:** Water the transplanted seedlings immediately after planting. This helps settle the soil around the roots and reduces stress.
    *   **Shading (Optional):** In case of intense sun immediately after transplanting, providing temporary shade for a few days can help seedlings establish better.
    *   **Irrigation:** Maintain consistent soil moisture. Celery requires continuous moisture, especially during its growth period. Avoid waterlogging, but do not let the soil dry out completely.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Apply appropriate fertilizers as per soil test recommendations. Celery is a heavy feeder, particularly of nitrogen and potassium.
    *   **Weed Control:** Keep the field free of weeds, especially during the early stages, as weeds compete for nutrients and water.
    *   **Blanching (Optional):** For blanched celery, begin earthing up (mounding soil around the stalks) or wrapping stalks with paper/cardboard 2-3 weeks before harvest. This excludes light and produces tender, pale stalks.
