Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the recommended doses for organic manures in Celery cultivation, which are crucial for enhancing soil health and crop productivity in Haryana.

Here are the recommended doses for Celery:

*   **Well-decomposed Farmyard Manure (FYM):** Apply 15-20 tonnes per acre. This should be thoroughly incorporated into the soil during land preparation, at least 2-3 weeks before transplanting or sowing. FYM improves soil structure, water retention, and provides a slow release of nutrients.

*   **Vermicompost:** Apply 3-5 tonnes per acre. Vermicompost can be incorporated into the soil during land preparation or applied as a top dressing around the plants during early growth stages. It is a rich source of macro and micronutrients, beneficial microbes, and plant growth hormones.

*   **Sagarika:** This is a seaweed extract-based biostimulant that promotes overall plant growth and nutrient uptake.
    *   **Sagarika (Granular):** Apply 8-10 kg per acre at the time of transplanting or sowing, or as a top dressing during early vegetative growth.
    *   **Sagarika (Liquid):** For foliar application, mix 2-3 ml per litre of water and spray at critical growth stages (e.g., 20-30 days after transplanting, and again 15-20 days later). For soil drenching, use 1-2 litres per acre mixed with irrigation water.

These organic manure applications, combined with balanced chemical fertilizer use based on soil test reports, will ensure optimal growth and yield for Celery in Haryana.
