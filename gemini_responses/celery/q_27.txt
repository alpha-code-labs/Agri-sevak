Celery (Apium graveolens) requires specific environmental conditions for optimal growth. Here are the suitable climate, soil type, and drainage requirements:

*   **Climate:**
    *   Celery is a cool-season crop that thrives in moderate temperatures.
    *   It prefers a long, cool growing season without extreme heat or severe frost.
    *   Ideal daytime temperatures range from 15°C to 21°C.
    *   Temperatures consistently above 25°C can lead to bolting (premature flowering), bitterness, and stringiness of the stalks.
    *   Temperatures below 10°C for extended periods can also induce bolting.
    *   It requires consistent moisture and humidity.

*   **Soil Type:**
    *   Celery performs best in highly fertile, deep, and well-drained soils.
    *   Loamy soils, particularly sandy loams or silt loams, rich in organic matter, are ideal.
    *   The soil should have excellent water-holding capacity while allowing for good aeration.
    *   A soil pH range of 6.0 to 7.0 is generally preferred for optimal nutrient availability.

*   **Drainage Requirement:**
    *   Good drainage is crucial for celery cultivation to prevent waterlogging, which can lead to root rot and other fungal diseases.
    *   While celery requires consistent moisture, it cannot tolerate standing water.
    *   The soil should be well-drained but also capable of retaining adequate moisture, often achieved by incorporating a significant amount of organic matter.
