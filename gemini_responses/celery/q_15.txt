As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Celery in Haryana:

### Control of Pests in Celery

#### 1. Grasshopper
Grasshoppers are generalist feeders and can cause damage to celery by feeding on leaves and tender stems.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Regular weeding around the field can reduce breeding sites.
    *   For small infestations, hand-picking and destroying grasshoppers can be effective.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Spray with **Malathion 50% EC** at 1.0 - 1.25 L per acre.
    *   Alternatively, spray with **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC** at 100 - 125 ml per acre.
    *   Alternatively, spray with **Cypermethrin 25% EC** at 200 - 240 ml per acre.
    *   Alternatively, spray with **Deltamethrin 2.8% EC** at 200 - 250 ml per acre.

#### 2. Painted bug
This is not known to affect Celery. Painted bug (Bagrada hilaris) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., mustard, cabbage, cauliflower).

#### 3. Red cotton bug
This is not known to affect Celery. Red cotton bug (Dysdercus cingulatus) is primarily a pest of cotton and other malvaceous plants.

#### 4. Black ants
Black ants are generally not primary pests of celery, but they can cause damage by feeding on seeds, seedlings, or by nesting around roots. They can also be attracted to honeydew secreted by other sap-sucking pests (like aphids), which they protect.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Maintain good field sanitation and remove weeds.
    *   If ants are farming other pests (e.g., aphids), control the primary pest to deter ants.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   If ants are directly damaging plants or their nests are problematic, drench the base of the affected plants or directly treat the ant nests with **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** at 2.0 L per acre, mixed in sufficient water for drenching.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) for any pesticide applied to ensure food safety.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension services for the most current and specific recommendations for your region.
