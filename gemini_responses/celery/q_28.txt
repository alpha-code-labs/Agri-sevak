As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I advise on the following scientifically verified practices to protect Celery from environmental stresses in Haryana:

Celery (Apium graveolens) is a cool-season crop that thrives in moderate temperatures (15-21°C). Extreme fluctuations in temperature and light intensity can severely impact its growth, quality, and yield.

### 1. Protection from Extreme Cold and Frost

Celery is susceptible to frost damage and prolonged cold can induce bolting (premature flowering).

*   **Timely Planting:** Adjust planting schedules to ensure the crop avoids the peak of extreme cold and frost periods, typically ensuring plants are well-established before late December and harvested before late February in Haryana.
*   **Protective Covers:**
    *   **Low Tunnels/Row Covers:** Erect low tunnels using transparent polyethylene sheets (25-50 micron thickness) or non-woven agro-textile fabric over the crop. This creates a warmer microclimate, protects from direct frost, and reduces chilling injury. Ensure proper ventilation during warmer daytime hours to prevent excessive humidity and disease development.
    *   **Mulching:** Apply a 5-7 cm layer of organic mulch (e.g., wheat straw, paddy straw, dry leaves) around the base of plants. This insulates the soil, maintains root zone temperature, and prevents frost heave.
*   **Irrigation:** Provide light irrigation a day or two before a predicted frost event. Moist soil retains heat better than dry soil, releasing it slowly overnight and raising ambient temperatures slightly. Avoid waterlogging.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure adequate potassium (K) supply, as it plays a crucial role in improving plant cold hardiness and cell wall strength.
*   **Foliar Sprays (Cryoprotectants/Stress Mitigators):**
    *   **Potassium silicate:** Apply as a foliar spray at 1-2 g/L water. It helps in strengthening cell walls and improving tolerance to cold stress.
    *   **Glycine betaine:** Apply as a foliar spray at 1-2 g/L water. It acts as an osmoprotectant, helping cells maintain turgor and function under cold stress.
    *   **Salicylic acid:** Apply as a foliar spray at 0.5-1 mM concentration (approximately 0.07-0.14 g/L water). It induces systemic acquired resistance and enhances cold tolerance.

### 2. Protection from Heat/Loo and Intense Sunlight

High temperatures (above 25°C) and intense sunlight can cause bitterness, stunted growth, wilting, and scorching of celery leaves.

*   **Timely Planting:** Avoid planting celery during periods when it will mature under extreme heat (typically April-June in Haryana). Adjust planting to ensure harvest before the onset of severe summer heat.
*   **Shade Management:**
    *   **Shade Nets:** Install 30-50% green or black shade nets over the crop during periods of intense sunlight and high temperatures. This significantly reduces leaf temperature and light intensity, preventing scorching and bitterness, and promoting tender growth.
*   **Irrigation:**
    *   **Consistent Moisture:** Celery requires consistent soil moisture. Use drip irrigation to provide frequent, shallow watering, maintaining uniform soil moisture without wetting foliage excessively. This helps in evaporative cooling of the soil.
    *   **Avoid Mid-day Overhead Irrigation:** While it can temporarily cool, it increases humidity around plants, potentially promoting fungal diseases. If used, ensure good air circulation.
*   **Mulching:** Apply a 5-7 cm layer of organic mulch (e.g., wheat straw, paddy straw) to keep the soil cool, conserve moisture, and suppress weeds.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Maintain a balanced nutrient supply. Avoid excessive nitrogen during hot periods, as it can lead to lush, succulent growth more susceptible to heat stress.
*   **Foliar Sprays (Anti-stress Agents):**
    *   **Potassium silicate:** Apply as a foliar spray at 1-2 g/L water. It helps in reducing transpiration, strengthening cell walls, and improving heat tolerance.
    *   **Glycine betaine:** Apply as a foliar spray at 1-2 g/L water. It acts as an osmoprotectant, helping plants cope with water deficit and heat stress.
    *   **Amino acid formulations:** Apply as per manufacturer's recommendations (typically 1-2 ml/L water). These provide readily available building blocks for protein synthesis, aiding in stress recovery and overall plant vigor.

### General Considerations

*   **Variety Selection:** Choose celery varieties known for their tolerance to specific environmental conditions if available for your region.
*   **Soil Health:** Ensure healthy, well-drained soil with good organic matter content. This improves the plant's overall resilience to various environmental stresses.
