Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing fungal diseases in Celery in Haryana.

Effective control of fungal diseases in Celery requires an integrated approach combining cultural practices with timely and appropriate chemical interventions.

Here's how to control the specified fungal diseases:

### General Cultural Practices for Disease Management in Celery:

*   **Use Disease-Free Seeds:** Always source seeds from reputable suppliers to prevent seed-borne diseases.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting celery or other susceptible crops (like carrots, parsley) in the same field for at least 2-3 years.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest. Keep the field free of weeds, which can harbor pathogens.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to improve air circulation, which reduces humidity and fungal growth.
*   **Irrigation Management:** Use drip irrigation or furrow irrigation instead of overhead irrigation to minimize leaf wetness, especially during evening hours. If overhead irrigation is necessary, do it in the morning to allow foliage to dry quickly.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced fertilizers. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can lead to lush, susceptible growth.

### Specific Control Measures for Fungal Diseases in Celery:

#### 1. Alternaria (Early Blight - *Alternaria apii*)

This disease causes small, circular, yellowish spots that enlarge, turn brown, and often develop concentric rings.

*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
    *   **Mancozeb** at 2-2.5 kg/acre (or 2-2.5 g/L of water).
    *   **Chlorothalonil** at 1.5-2 kg/acre (or 1.5-2 g/L of water).
    *   **Azoxystrobin** at 200-300 ml/acre (or 0.5-1 ml/L of water).
    *   **Difenoconazole** at 100-150 ml/acre (or 0.2-0.3 ml/L of water).

#### 2. Anthracnose (*Colletotrichum acutatum*)

Symptoms include water-soaked lesions on leaves, petioles, and stems, which turn brown or black. It can also cause damping-off in seedlings.

*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
    *   **Mancozeb** at 2-2.5 kg/acre (or 2-2.5 g/L of water).
    *   **Chlorothalonil** at 1.5-2 kg/acre (or 1.5-2 g/L of water).
    *   **Azoxystrobin** at 200-300 ml/acre (or 0.5-1 ml/L of water).

#### 3. Blast

This is not known to affect Celery.

#### 4. Blight (General, including Late Blight - *Septoria apiicola*)

Late Blight causes small, circular, yellowish spots on leaves, petioles, and stems, which turn brown/black. Tiny black dots (pycnidia) are often visible within the lesions.

*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
    *   **Mancozeb** at 2-2.5 kg/acre (or 2-2.5 g/L of water).
    *   **Chlorothalonil** at 1.5-2 kg/acre (or 1.5-2 g/L of water).
    *   **Azoxystrobin** at 200-300 ml/acre (or 0.5-1 ml/L of water).
    *   **Propiconazole** at 200-250 ml/acre (or 0.4-0.5 ml/L of water).

#### 5. Brown Spot (Cercospora Leaf Spot - *Cercospora apii*)

This disease manifests as small, circular, yellowish-brown spots, often with a purplish border, which enlarge and coalesce.

*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
    *   **Mancozeb** at 2-2.5 kg/acre (or 2-2.5 g/L of water).
    *   **Chlorothalonil** at 1.5-2 kg/acre (or 1.5-2 g/L of water).
    *   **Difenoconazole** at 100-150 ml/acre (or 0.2-0.3 ml/L of water).
    *   **Pyraclostrobin** at 200-300 ml/acre (or 0.5-1 ml/L of water).

#### 6. Downy Mildew (*Plasmopara apii* or *Peronospora apii*)

Symptoms include yellowish spots on the upper leaf surface, with purplish-grey fuzzy growth on the underside, especially under humid conditions.

*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
    *   **Dimethomorph + Mancozeb** at 1-1.5 kg/acre (or 2-3 g/L of water).
    *   **Cymoxanil + Mancozeb** at 1-1.25 kg/acre (or 2-2.5 g/L of water).
    *   **Fluopicolide + Propamocarb hydrochloride** at 1-1.25 L/acre (or 2-2.5 ml/L of water).

#### 7. Powdery Mildew (*Erysiphe* spp.)

This disease appears as white, powdery patches on leaves, stems, and petioles.

*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
    *   **Sulphur (Wettable Powder)** at 2-3 kg/acre (or 4-6 g/L of water).
    *   **Myclobutanil** at 200-250 ml/acre (or 0.4-0.5 ml/L of water).
    *   **Penconazole** at 150-200 ml/acre (or 0.3-0.4 ml/L of water).
    *   **Azoxystrobin** at 200-300 ml/acre (or 0.5-1 ml/L of water).

#### 8. Grey Mildew (Grey Mold - *Botrytis cinerea*)

This causes water-soaked lesions that turn brown and are covered with a fuzzy grey mold, particularly under high humidity. It can affect petioles, leaves, and cause damping-off.

*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
    *   **Carbendazim** at 250-500 g/acre (or 0.5-1 g/L of water).
    *   **Thiophanate-methyl** at 500-750 g/acre (or 1-1.5 g/L of water).
    *   **Boscalid + Pyraclostrobin** at 300-400 g/acre (or 0.6-0.8 g/L of water).

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Rotation of Fungicides:** To prevent the development of fungicide resistance, rotate fungicides with different modes of action.
*   **Timing of Application:** Apply fungicides preventively or at the first sign of disease symptoms.
*   **Adherence to Label Instructions:** Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the fungicide label regarding dosage, application method, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and safety precautions.
*   **Local Consultation:** For the most precise and up-to-date recommendations tailored to your specific field conditions and current disease pressure, please consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts.

By implementing these practices, you can effectively manage fungal diseases and ensure a healthy celery crop.
