As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for managing the mentioned conditions in Celery in Haryana:

### Scab (Celery Scab)

Celery Scab, caused by the fungus *Sphaceloma apii*, is a known disease affecting celery.

**Symptoms:**
Initial symptoms include small, circular, yellowish spots on leaves, petioles, and stems. These spots later become raised, corky, and dark brown, often leading to distortion of affected tissues and stunting of the plant.

**Control Measures:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Disease-Free Planting Material:** Always use certified disease-free seeds or healthy transplants.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Practice a crop rotation of at least 3 years with non-host crops to reduce pathogen inoculum in the soil.
    *   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris immediately after harvest to prevent the carry-over of the pathogen.
    *   **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to improve air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce humidity and fungal growth.
    *   **Irrigation Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation late in the day, as prolonged leaf wetness can promote disease development. Drip irrigation is preferred.

2.  **Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
    *   For effective management, especially during periods conducive to disease development, the following CIBRC approved fungicides can be used:
        *   **Mancozeb:** Apply at a rate of 2.0-2.5 kg per acre (or 2.0-2.5 g/L of water for spray solution).
        *   **Chlorothalonil:** Apply at a rate of 1.0-1.5 kg per acre (or 1.0-1.5 g/L of water for spray solution).
        *   **Copper Oxychloride:** Apply at a rate of 2.5-3.0 kg per acre (or 2.5-3.0 g/L of water for spray solution).
    *   Initiate sprays upon the first appearance of symptoms and repeat at 7-10 day intervals, depending on disease severity and weather conditions. Always follow label instructions for application rates and pre-harvest intervals.

### Canker

This is not known to affect Celery as a distinct disease.

### Gummosis

This is not known to affect Celery. Gummosis is primarily a symptom observed in woody plants (trees and shrubs) where gum exudes from the bark, typically in response to stress, injury, or disease. Celery is an herbaceous plant and does not exhibit gummosis.

### Lichen

This is not known to affect Celery. Lichens are symbiotic organisms (fungus and alga/cyanobacterium) that grow on surfaces such as tree bark, rocks, or soil. They are non-parasitic and do not cause disease or damage to living celery plants. Therefore, no control measures are required for lichens on celery.
