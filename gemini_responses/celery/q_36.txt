As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide scientifically verified advice to enhance the yield, stalk quality, and storage life of celery (Apium graveolens) in Haryana. Please note that celery is a vegetable, and its edible part is the leaf stalk (petiole), not a fruit. Therefore, I will address "stalk quality" instead of "fruit quality."

### 1. Improving Yield for Celery

To maximize celery yield, focus on optimal growing conditions and nutrient management:

*   **Variety Selection:** Choose high-yielding, disease-resistant varieties adapted to Haryana's agro-climatic conditions. Consult HAU recommendations for specific varieties suitable for your region.
*   **Soil Management:** Celery thrives in well-drained, fertile loamy soils with a pH of 6.0-7.0. Incorporate 20-25 tonnes/acre of well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost during land preparation to improve soil structure and fertility.
*   **Nutrient Management:** A balanced nutrient supply is crucial for vigorous growth and high yield.
    *   **Nitrogen (N):** Essential for lush vegetative growth. Apply 40-50 kg N/acre in split doses.
        *   **Urea** (46% N): Approximately 87-109 kg/acre in splits.
    *   **Phosphorus (P):** Promotes strong root development. Apply 20-25 kg P2O5/acre as a basal dose.
        *   **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5): Approximately 43-54 kg/acre.
    *   **Potassium (K):** Crucial for overall plant health, water regulation, and stress tolerance, directly impacting yield and quality. Apply 40-50 kg K2O/acre as a basal dose or in splits.
        *   **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** (60% K2O): Approximately 67-83 kg/acre.
    *   **Micronutrients:** Celery is sensitive to certain micronutrient deficiencies.
        *   **Boron:** Deficiency causes cracked stems and brown heart, reducing yield. Apply 4-5 kg **Borax** (10.5% B) per acre as a soil application or a foliar spray of 0.2% **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (20% B) at 2-3 g/L water.
        *   **Calcium:** Prevents black heart. Ensure adequate soil calcium or apply **Calcium Nitrate** (15.5% N, 19% Ca) at 5-10 kg/acre as a soil drench or foliar spray at 5 g/L.
*   **Irrigation:** Maintain consistent soil moisture, especially during critical growth stages. Celery is a shallow-rooted crop and highly sensitive to water stress. Drip irrigation is highly recommended for efficient water use.
*   **Weed Control:** Timely weeding is crucial as celery is a poor competitor. Manual weeding or appropriate pre-emergent herbicides can be used.
    *   **Pendimethalin** (30% EC) at 1.0-1.3 L/acre as a pre-emergent spray.
*   **Planting Density:** Optimal spacing (e.g., 15-20 cm between plants and 45-60 cm between rows) ensures adequate light and nutrient availability, leading to better yield.

### 2. Improving Stalk Quality for Celery

Stalk quality refers to crispness, color, flavor, and absence of defects.

*   **Nutrient Balance:** As mentioned above, adequate Potassium, Calcium, and Boron are critical for stalk quality, preventing disorders like pithiness (hollow stems), black heart, and cracked stems.
*   **Water Management:** Consistent and adequate irrigation prevents pithiness and maintains crispness. Avoid sudden fluctuations in soil moisture, which can lead to cracking or bitterness.
*   **Blanching:** For certain varieties, blanching (covering the stalks to exclude light) for 2-3 weeks before harvest can improve tenderness, reduce bitterness, and produce lighter-colored stalks. This can be achieved by earthing up the plants or using paper collars.
*   **Pest and Disease Management:** Timely control of pests (e.g., aphids, leaf miners) and diseases (e.g., early blight, late blight) prevents physical damage and physiological stress that degrade stalk quality. Consult HAU for specific integrated pest and disease management (IPDM) strategies.
*   **Harvesting at Optimal Maturity:** Harvest when stalks are firm, crisp, and of desirable size, but before they become over-mature or pithy. Over-mature celery can become fibrous and bitter.

### 3. Improving Storage Life for Celery

Extending the storage life of celery requires careful post-harvest handling and environmental control.

*   **Harvesting:**
    *   Harvest in the early morning when field temperatures are cool to minimize respiration and moisture loss.
    *   Handle carefully to avoid bruising or mechanical damage, which accelerates spoilage.
    *   Cut the entire plant just below the soil line, leaving the root crown intact.
*   **Pre-cooling:** Rapidly remove field heat immediately after harvest. This is the most critical step for extending shelf life. Hydro-cooling (spraying with cold water) or forced-air cooling are effective methods.
*   **Trimming and Cleaning:** Remove outer damaged or discolored leaves and excess root material. Wash thoroughly with clean, potable water, possibly containing a sanitizing agent.
    *   **Sodium hypochlorite** (bleach) solution at 50-100 ppm active chlorine can be used for washing to reduce microbial load.
*   **Storage Conditions:**
    *   **Temperature:** Store celery at 0-1°C (32-34°F).
    *   **Relative Humidity:** Maintain very high relative humidity (95-98%) to prevent desiccation and wilting, which are major causes of quality loss.
*   **Packaging:**
    *   Package in perforated plastic bags or crates lined with plastic film to maintain high humidity around the stalks while allowing some gas exchange.
    *   Modified Atmosphere Packaging (MAP) can further extend shelf life by reducing respiration rates.
*   **Ethylene Management:** Celery is highly sensitive to ethylene gas, which can cause yellowing and deterioration. Store celery separately from ethylene-producing fruits (e.g., apples, bananas, tomatoes) to avoid premature senescence.
