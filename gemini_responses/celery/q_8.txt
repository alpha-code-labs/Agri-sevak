As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach for the effective and sustainable control of sucking pests in celery, keeping in mind the agro-climatic conditions of Haryana.

**Regarding Psylla:**
This is not known to affect Celery.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Aphids, Leafhopper, Whitefly, and Thrips in Celery:**

An IPM strategy combines various methods to manage pests, prioritizing environmentally friendly options and using chemical control judiciously.

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Weed Management:** Keep the field and surrounding areas free of weeds, as many weeds act as alternate hosts for these sucking pests.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops to break the pest life cycle.
*   **Optimized Nutrition and Irrigation:** Maintain healthy, vigorous plants through balanced fertilization and proper irrigation. Stressed plants are more susceptible to pest attacks.
*   **Yellow Sticky Traps:** Install yellow sticky traps (15-20 traps per acre) at canopy height for monitoring pest populations and for mass trapping of whiteflies, leafhoppers, and winged aphids.
*   **Reflective Mulches:** Using silver-colored reflective mulches can deter aphids and thrips from landing on plants, especially in the early stages.

**2. Biological Control:**
*   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Encourage and conserve natural enemies such as ladybird beetles, lacewings, hoverflies, and parasitic wasps (e.g., *Encarsia formosa* for whiteflies, *Aphidius colemani* for aphids). Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.
*   **Biopesticides:** Consider using neem-based formulations (e.g., Azadirachtin 1500 ppm or 3000 ppm) at 3-5 ml/L of water, especially during early infestation or as a preventive measure.

**3. Monitoring:**
*   **Regular Scouting:** Regularly inspect celery plants, especially the undersides of leaves and growing tips, for the presence of pests and their damage symptoms. Early detection is crucial for effective management.

**4. Chemical Control (When necessary and as a last resort):**
If pest populations exceed economic threshold levels despite cultural and biological measures, chemical intervention may be required. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

**Important Considerations for Chemical Application:**
*   Apply insecticides during the cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage, especially the undersides of leaves where many sucking pests reside.
*   Always read and follow the label instructions for dosage, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and application.

**Recommended CIBRC Approved Insecticides for Sucking Pests in Celery:**

*   **For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, Thrips:**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL**: 0.5 - 1.0 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG**: 0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water.
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP**: 0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water.
*   **Primarily for Whiteflies and Thrips (also effective on some other sucking pests):**
    *   **Diafenthiuron 50% WP**: 1.0 - 1.25 g per litre of water.
    *   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC**: 0.5 - 0.75 ml per litre of water.
*   **Primarily for Aphids and Whiteflies:**
    *   **Flonicamid 50% WG**: 0.3 g per litre of water.

Always consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for the most current and specific recommendations for your farm.
