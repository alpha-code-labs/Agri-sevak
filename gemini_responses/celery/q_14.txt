As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling soil pests like termites and root-knot nematodes in celery, keeping in mind the conditions in Haryana.

Both termites and root-knot nematodes are significant soil pests that can affect a wide range of vegetable crops, including celery, by damaging roots and hindering nutrient uptake, leading to stunted growth and reduced yield.

Here's an integrated approach for their control:

### General Cultural Practices for Soil Health and Pest Management:

1.  **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting celery or other susceptible host crops (like tomato, brinjal, potato, okra) in the same field year after year. Rotate with non-host crops like cereals (wheat, maize) or marigolds (which have nematicidal properties).
2.  **Solarization:** During the hot summer months (May-June), after ploughing the field, cover it with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks. This raises soil temperature, killing many soil-borne pests, pathogens, and weed seeds.
3.  **Organic Matter:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost (20-25 tonnes/acre) into the soil. This improves soil structure, water retention, and promotes beneficial microbial activity, which can suppress pest populations.
4.  **Deep Ploughing:** Expose soil pests to sunlight and predators by deep ploughing during summer.
5.  **Resistant Varieties:** If available and suitable for Haryana, choose celery varieties known to have some resistance or tolerance to nematodes.

### Specific Control Measures for Termites:

Termites primarily attack the roots and base of the stem, leading to wilting and plant death.

1.  **Pre-planting Soil Treatment:**
    *   Apply **Fipronil** 0.3% GR at 10-15 kg/acre and incorporate it into the soil before planting.
    *   Alternatively, drench the soil with **Fipronil** 5% SC at 400-600 ml/acre mixed in sufficient water (e.g., 200-400 litres) before transplanting or at the time of sowing.

2.  **Post-planting Treatment (if infestation is observed):**
    *   Drench the base of the plants with **Fipronil** 5% SC at 1.0-1.5 ml/L of water. Ensure the solution reaches the root zone.

### Specific Control Measures for Nematodes (Root-knot):

Root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.) cause characteristic galls or knots on the roots, impairing water and nutrient absorption.

1.  **Biological Control (Pre-planting/At Planting):**
    *   **Purpureocillium lilacinum** (formerly *Paecilomyces lilacinus*) or **Trichoderma viride**: Mix 2-4 kg/acre of these bio-nematicides/bio-fungicides with 100 kg of well-decomposed FYM or compost. Apply this mixture to the soil 7-10 days before planting and incorporate it.
    *   For seedling treatment, dip the roots of celery seedlings in a solution of **Purpureocillium lilacinum** or **Trichoderma viride** (10 g/L of water) for 20-30 minutes before transplanting.

2.  **Chemical Control (Pre-planting/At Planting):**
    *   **Fluensulfone** 2% GR: Apply 10-15 kg/acre and incorporate into the soil before planting.
    *   Alternatively, drench the soil with **Fluensulfone** 50% SC at 1-1.5 L/acre mixed in sufficient water (e.g., 200-400 litres) before transplanting or at the time of sowing.
    *   Another option is **Oxamyl** 24% SL: Apply 1-2 L/acre as a soil drench at planting or shortly after.

3.  **Post-planting Treatment (if infestation is observed):**
    *   Drench the root zone of affected plants with **Oxamyl** 24% SL at 1-2 ml/L of water. Repeat if necessary, following label instructions for re-application intervals.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label for dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest intervals.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) while handling chemicals.
*   Integrated Pest Management (IPM) combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods is the most sustainable and effective approach.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions.
