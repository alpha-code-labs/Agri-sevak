As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding the potential harmful effects of weedicides/herbicides on Celery. Celery (Apium graveolens) is known to be sensitive to many herbicides.

It is important to note that specific herbicide recommendations for Celery in India are limited or non-existent due to it being a minor crop. Therefore, the primary focus should be on preventative measures and non-chemical weed control methods to avoid any phytotoxicity.

Here's how to reduce the harmful effects of weedicides/herbicides in Celery:

1.  **Prioritize Non-Chemical Weed Control:**
    *   **Manual Weeding:** This is the safest and most recommended method for Celery, especially during its early growth stages.
    *   **Mulching:** Applying organic mulch (e.g., straw, crop residues) can suppress weed growth, conserve moisture, and regulate soil temperature.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Implementing a well-planned crop rotation can help manage weed populations over time, reducing reliance on herbicides.

2.  **If Herbicide Use is Unavoidable or There's a Risk of Exposure (e.g., drift from adjacent fields):**
    *   **Strict Herbicide Selection:**
        *   Only use herbicides that are **specifically registered and recommended for Celery** by the Central Insecticides Board & Registration Committee (CIBRC). If no such herbicides are registered, avoid chemical application directly on the crop.
        *   Avoid broad-spectrum herbicides that are not selective for Celery.
    *   **Accurate Dosage and Calibration:**
        *   Always follow the manufacturer's recommended dosage precisely. Over-application is a major cause of phytotoxicity.
        *   Regularly calibrate your sprayer to ensure it delivers the correct volume of spray solution per unit area. For example, if the recommended rate is 500 ml/acre, ensure your sprayer applies this amount accurately.
    *   **Timely Application:**
        *   Apply herbicides at the correct growth stage of the weeds for maximum efficacy and minimal impact on Celery.
        *   Avoid applying herbicides when Celery plants are stressed (e.g., due to drought, waterlogging, extreme temperatures, or nutrient deficiency), as stressed plants are more susceptible to herbicide damage.
    *   **Favorable Environmental Conditions:**
        *   **Wind Speed:** Avoid spraying during windy conditions (wind speed exceeding 8-10 km/hour) to prevent spray drift onto non-target Celery plants.
        *   **Temperature and Humidity:** High temperatures and humidity can increase herbicide uptake and potential for damage. Consult product labels for optimal application conditions.
        *   **Rainfall:** Ensure no rainfall is expected shortly after application, which could wash off foliar herbicides or cause runoff.
    *   **Effective Spray Drift Management:**
        *   Use **drift-reducing nozzles** (e.g., air-induction nozzles) that produce larger droplets.
        *   Maintain a **lower boom height** during application to minimize the distance droplets travel in the air.
        *   Establish **adequate buffer zones** between the treated area and Celery fields, especially when applying herbicides to adjacent crops.
    *   **Thorough Equipment Cleaning:**
        *   Always clean spray tanks, hoses, and nozzles thoroughly after each use, especially when switching between different herbicides or crops. Residues from previous applications can cause severe damage to sensitive crops like Celery.
    *   **Awareness of Soil Residues:**
        *   Be aware of the herbicide history of the field. Some herbicides applied to previous crops can persist in the soil and harm subsequent sensitive crops like Celery. Consult soil test reports if available.
    *   **Water Quality:**
        *   Use clean water for mixing herbicides. Hard water or water with high pH can sometimes reduce herbicide efficacy or increase the risk of phytotoxicity.

3.  **Mitigation Measures (if damage occurs or is suspected):**
    *   **Light Irrigation:** If foliar damage is observed shortly after application, a light overhead irrigation might help wash off some herbicide residues from the leaves. For soil-applied herbicides, light irrigation can sometimes help dilute the concentration in the root zone.
    *   **Nutrient Support:** Ensure the Celery plants receive adequate nutrients to help them recover from stress. A balanced fertilizer application can support plant vigor and aid in recovery.

By strictly adhering to these practices, you can significantly reduce the risk of harmful effects from weedicides/herbicides on your Celery crop.
