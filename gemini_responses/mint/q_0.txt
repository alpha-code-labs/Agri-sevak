As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Mint cultivation in Haryana. Effective management relies on an integrated approach combining cultural practices with judicious use of CIBRC-approved fungicides.

**General Cultural Practices for Fungal Disease Prevention:**

*   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris promptly to reduce inoculum.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting mint in the same field year after year, especially if disease issues were present.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to improve air circulation and reduce humidity within the canopy, which discourages fungal growth.
*   **Irrigation Management:** Water plants at the base in the morning to allow foliage to dry quickly. Avoid overhead irrigation late in the day or evening.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Maintain balanced nutrition. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can lead to lush, susceptible growth.
*   **Use Healthy Planting Material:** Always start with disease-free suckers or cuttings.

**Specific Control Measures for Fungal Diseases in Mint:**

Here are the recommended control measures for the fungal diseases you've listed:

1.  **Alternaria Leaf Spot (Caused by *Alternaria alternata*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Small, dark, circular spots on leaves, often with concentric rings, leading to defoliation.
    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   **Mancozeb 75% WP:** Apply at 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5-3 g/L of water).
        *   **Chlorothalonil 75% WP:** Apply at 1.5-2 kg/acre (or 2-2.5 g/L of water).
        *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:** Apply at 200 ml/acre (or 0.5-1 ml/L of water).

2.  **Anthracnose (Caused by *Colletotrichum gloeosporioides*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Irregular, sunken lesions on leaves and stems, often with dark borders, leading to blight and dieback.
    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   **Carbendazim 50% WP:** Apply at 250-500 g/acre (or 0.5-1 g/L of water).
        *   **Thiophanate-methyl 70% WP:** Apply at 250-500 g/acre (or 0.5-1 g/L of water).
        *   **Pyraclostrobin 20% WG:** Apply at 150-200 g/acre (or 0.3-0.4 g/L of water).

3.  **Blast**
    *   This is not known to affect Mint. Blast disease is primarily associated with cereals like rice.

4.  **Blight (e.g., Rhizoctonia Blight, Phytophthora Blight)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Rapid browning and death of plant parts, often starting from the soil line (Rhizoctonia) or causing water-soaked lesions that expand quickly (Phytophthora).
    *   **Chemical Control (for Rhizoctonia Blight):**
        *   **Pencycuron 25% WP:** Apply at 500 g/acre (or 1-1.5 g/L of water) as a foliar spray or soil drench.
        *   **Validamycin 3% L:** Apply at 1-1.5 L/acre (or 2-3 ml/L of water) as a soil drench.
    *   **Chemical Control (for Phytophthora Blight/Root Rot):**
        *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride 72.2% SL:** Apply at 1-1.5 L/acre (or 2-3 ml/L of water) as a drench or foliar spray.
        *   **Metalaxyl-M 4% + Mancozeb 64% WP:** Apply at 1-1.25 kg/acre (or 2-2.5 g/L of water).

5.  **Brown Spot (Often a symptom of other leaf spot diseases like Alternaria or Cercospora)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Various brown spots on leaves, which can vary in size and shape depending on the causal agent.
    *   **Chemical Control:** Management is similar to Alternaria and Anthracnose.
        *   **Mancozeb 75% WP:** Apply at 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5-3 g/L of water).
        *   **Chlorothalonil 75% WP:** Apply at 1.5-2 kg/acre (or 2-2.5 g/L of water).
        *   **Carbendazim 50% WP:** Apply at 250-500 g/acre (or 0.5-1 g/L of water).

6.  **Downy Mildew (Caused by *Peronospora lamii* f. sp. *menthae*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Yellowish spots on the upper leaf surface, with a fuzzy, purplish-grey growth on the underside of leaves, leading to leaf distortion and defoliation.
    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   **Mancozeb 75% WP:** Apply at 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5-3 g/L of water).
        *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride 72.2% SL:** Apply at 1-1.5 L/acre (or 2-3 ml/L of water).
        *   **Dimethomorph 50% WP:** Apply at 200-300 g/acre (or 0.5-0.6 g/L of water).
        *   **Metalaxyl-M 4% + Mancozeb 64% WP:** Apply at 1-1.25 kg/acre (or 2-2.5 g/L of water).

7.  **Powdery Mildew (Caused by *Golovinomyces cichoracearum*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** White, powdery patches on leaves, stems, and flowers, leading to stunted growth and reduced yield.
    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   **Sulphur 80% WP:** Apply at 2-2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5-3 g/L of water).
        *   **Hexaconazole 5% EC:** Apply at 200-300 ml/acre (or 0.5-1 ml/L of water).
        *   **Myclobutanil 10% WP:** Apply at 100-150 g/acre (or 0.2-0.3 g/L of water).
        *   **Penconazole 10% EC:** Apply at 100-150 ml/acre (or 0.2-0.3 ml/L of water).

8.  **Grey Mildew (Assuming this refers to Grey Mold, *Botrytis cinerea*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Soft, watery rot on leaves, stems, and flowers, often covered with a fuzzy, greyish-brown mold, especially under high humidity.
    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   **Carbendazim 50% WP:** Apply at 250-500 g/acre (or 0.5-1 g/L of water).
        *   **Thiophanate-methyl 70% WP:** Apply at 250-500 g/acre (or 0.5-1 g/L of water).
        *   **Pyraclostrobin 20% WG:** Apply at 150-200 g/acre (or 0.3-0.4 g/L of water).

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Read the Label:** Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the fungicide label for dosage, application method, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and safety precautions.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of fungicide resistance.
*   **Timing of Application:** Apply fungicides preventively or at the first sign of disease for best efficacy.
*   **Consult Local Experts:** For specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and current disease pressure, always consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts.
