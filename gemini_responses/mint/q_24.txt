As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified practices for mint transplantation in Haryana:

### Ideal Transplantation Time for Mint

The optimal time for mint transplantation in Haryana is crucial for successful establishment and vigorous growth, allowing for multiple harvests.

*   **Spring Planting:** The most ideal period is **February to March**. This allows the plants to establish well before the onset of intense summer heat and provides a long growing season for multiple harvests.
*   **Post-Monsoon Planting:** Another suitable window is **September to October**. This allows plants to establish before the cooler winter months and provides a good start for the following spring.

### Ideal Transplantation Distance for Mint

Proper spacing ensures adequate light, air circulation, and nutrient availability, leading to healthier plants and higher yields.

*   **Row-to-Row Distance:** Maintain a distance of **45-60 cm** between rows.
*   **Plant-to-Plant Distance:** Plant rhizomes or suckers at a distance of **15-30 cm** within the rows. For commercial cultivation, a spacing of 45 cm x 15 cm or 60 cm x 30 cm is commonly adopted.

### Ideal Transplantation Process for Mint

A systematic approach to transplantation ensures high survival rates and robust plant development.

1.  **Field Preparation:**
    *   **Ploughing:** Plough the field 2-3 times to a fine tilth, followed by planking to achieve a level surface.
    *   **Soil Enrichment:** Incorporate well-rotted Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost at a rate of **10-15 tonnes per acre** during the last ploughing. This improves soil structure, water retention, and nutrient content.
    *   **Bed Formation:** For better drainage and management, especially in areas prone to waterlogging, raised beds of appropriate width can be prepared.

2.  **Selection of Planting Material:**
    *   **Rhizomes/Suckers:** The most common and effective method is using healthy, disease-free rhizomes (underground stems) or suckers (new shoots arising from roots) from established, vigorous mint plants.
    *   **Cuttings:** Stem cuttings can also be used, but rhizomes generally establish faster and more reliably.
    *   **Rhizome Preparation:** Cut rhizomes into pieces of **5-10 cm** length, ensuring each piece has at least 2-3 nodes (buds).

3.  **Planting Method:**
    *   **Furrow Planting:** Create shallow furrows of **5-7 cm** depth at the recommended row-to-row distance.
    *   **Placement:** Place the prepared rhizome pieces horizontally in these furrows, maintaining the specified plant-to-plant distance. Ensure the buds are facing upwards or sideways.
    *   **Covering:** Lightly cover the rhizomes with soil, ensuring they are buried at a depth of approximately **3-5 cm**.
    *   **Watering:** Immediately after planting, provide a light irrigation to settle the soil around the rhizomes and initiate sprouting.

4.  **Post-Transplantation Care:**
    *   **Irrigation:** Maintain consistent soil moisture, especially during the establishment phase. Avoid waterlogging.
    *   **Weeding:** Regular weeding is crucial in the initial weeks to prevent competition from weeds, which can significantly hinder mint establishment and growth.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Based on soil test reports, apply recommended doses of fertilizers. A general starter dose of Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium (NPK) can be applied if soil testing is not immediately available.
