As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the use of growth regulators/hormones in Mint for Haryana:

1.  **Ethephon (Technical name for Ethrel):**
    *   **Ethephon** is a plant growth regulator used in various crops for purposes like fruit ripening, flower induction, or shoot growth regulation.
    *   However, for Mint (Mentha arvensis), **Ethephon** is **not a standard recommended growth regulator** for general yield enhancement or routine application in Haryana's package of practices. While research may explore its effects on specific physiological processes, it is not advised for general use as a growth regulator in Mint by HAU.

2.  **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D):**
    *   **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid** is primarily a selective herbicide used to control broadleaf weeds in various crops.
    *   It is **not recommended for use as a growth regulator in Mint**. Applying **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid** to Mint, even at very low concentrations, can cause severe phytotoxicity, damage the crop, and is not part of any recommended practice for Mint cultivation.

3.  **Boron (as a Micronutrient):**
    *   Boron is an essential micronutrient vital for various plant functions, including cell wall formation, sugar transport, and pollen tube growth. It is not a hormone but plays a crucial role in healthy plant development.
    *   If Boron deficiency is suspected based on soil tests or visual symptoms (e.g., stunted growth, deformed leaves, poor flowering), or as a prophylactic measure in deficient soils, its application is recommended.
    *   **Recommended Dose (Foliar Application):**
        *   Apply **Borax (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate)** (10.5-11.0% Boron) at **1.5-2.0 g/L** of water.
        *   Alternatively, apply **Boric acid** (17.0% Boron) at **1.0-1.5 g/L** of water.
        *   Spray 200-250 litres of solution per acre, ensuring thorough coverage, preferably during cooler parts of the day. Repeat if deficiency persists or as advised by soil test reports.
