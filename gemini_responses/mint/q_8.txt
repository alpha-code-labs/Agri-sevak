As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling sucking pests in Mint (Mentha) in Haryana.

First, let's address the pests you've listed: Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips are common sucking pests that can affect Mint. However, **Psylla is not known to be a significant or primary pest of Mint.** Psyllids are generally highly host-specific, and Mint is not a typical host plant for economically important psyllid species.

Effective management of sucking pests in Mint involves an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies:**

1.  **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your mint crop (especially the undersides of leaves and new shoots) for the presence of pests. Early detection is key to effective control.
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the field free of weeds, as they can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
    *   **Balanced Nutrition:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush, soft growth that is more attractive to sucking pests.
    *   **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing for good air circulation, which can reduce pest build-up.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy severely infested plant parts or crop residues.
3.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Encourage natural enemies like ladybird beetles, lacewings, and parasitic wasps, which prey on aphids and whiteflies. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.
    *   Consider using biopesticides like entomopathogenic fungi (*Beauveria bassiana* or *Lecanicillium lecanii*) in the early stages of infestation, especially for aphids and whiteflies. Apply as per manufacturer's recommendations.

**Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved Technical Chemicals):**

When pest populations reach economic threshold levels and other methods are insufficient, chemical control may be necessary. Always ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where many sucking pests reside. Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

The following CIBRC approved technical chemicals are effective against these pests and are commonly recommended for use in aromatic/medicinal crops, including mint, in India:

*   **For Aphids, Leafhoppers, and Whiteflies:**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** 0.5 - 0.75 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** 0.2 - 0.3 g per litre of water.
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** 0.2 - 0.3 g per litre of water.
    *   **Flonicamid 50% WG:** 0.3 g per litre of water (highly effective against aphids and whiteflies).

*   **For Whiteflies and Thrips (and some mites):**
    *   **Diafenthiuron 50% WP:** 1.0 - 1.2 g per litre of water.
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** 1.25 - 1.5 ml per litre of water (primarily targets whitefly nymphs and hoppers).

*   **For a broader spectrum (including Aphids, Leafhoppers, Thrips):**
    *   **Dimethoate 30% EC:** 1.0 - 1.5 ml per litre of water.

*   **For early stages and IPM compatible approach:**
    *   **Azadirachtin 1500 ppm (or higher concentration):** 3 - 5 ml per litre of water. This acts as an antifeedant, repellent, and insect growth regulator.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always check the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) mentioned on the insecticide label. Mint is often harvested frequently, so choosing chemicals with a short PHI or using them well in advance of harvest is crucial to avoid residues.
*   **Water Volume:** Use sufficient water (typically 400-600 litres per acre, depending on crop canopy) to ensure thorough wetting of the foliage.
*   **Application Timing:** Apply insecticides during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) like gloves, masks, and protective clothing while handling and spraying chemicals. Follow all safety instructions on the product label.
