Greetings, farmer. As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with the recommended cultivation practices for Mint, based on scientific research and local conditions in Haryana.

**Recommended Cultivation Practices for Mint:**

*   **Propagation Method:**
    *   Mint is primarily propagated vegetatively for commercial cultivation, as seed propagation is not common due to poor germination and genetic variability. The most recommended methods are:
        *   **Root Suckers/Stolons:** These are young shoots arising from the base of the mother plant.
        *   **Rhizomes:** Underground stems that produce new shoots and roots.
        *   **Stem Cuttings:** Can also be used, especially for rapid multiplication.

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   **Furrow Planting:** This is the most common and recommended method for planting suckers or rhizomes.
        *   Prepare shallow furrows in well-prepared fields.
        *   Place the root suckers or rhizome pieces end-to-end or at specified spacing within these furrows.
        *   Cover lightly with soil.
    *   **Broadcasting (less common for commercial scale):** Chopped rhizomes can be broadcasted and then lightly harrowed, but furrow planting allows for better management and uniform stand establishment.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   For root suckers or rhizome pieces, plant them at a depth of **4-6 cm** below the soil surface.
    *   For stem cuttings, plant them such that at least two nodes are buried in the soil, typically around **5-7 cm** deep.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   **Row-to-Row:** Maintain a distance of **45-60 cm** between rows.
    *   **Plant-to-Plant:**
        *   When planting suckers or rhizome pieces, they are often placed end-to-end or at a close spacing of **10-15 cm** within the furrow to ensure a dense stand.
        *   For stem cuttings, a spacing of **15-20 cm** within the row is suitable.

*   **Propagule Dose (Equivalent to Seed Dose):**
    *   Since mint is propagated vegetatively, we refer to the quantity of planting material required.
    *   **For Root Suckers/Rhizomes:** Approximately **400-600 kg of healthy suckers or rhizome pieces per acre** are required. This typically translates to about 10,000-12,000 individual suckers/rhizome pieces per acre, depending on their size.
    *   **For Stem Cuttings:** Approximately **20,000-25,000 stem cuttings per acre** are needed.
