As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend the following scientifically verified practices to protect Mint (Mentha arvensis/spicata) from environmental stresses in Haryana:

**I. Protection from Extreme Cold and Frost**

Mint is relatively hardy, but severe frost can damage young shoots and leaves.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Irrigation:** Apply a light irrigation to the field in the late afternoon or early evening before an anticipated frost. Water has a higher specific heat capacity than air and soil, releasing heat slowly overnight, which can raise the ambient temperature around the plants by a few degrees Celsius, preventing frost formation on leaf surfaces.
    *   **Mulching:** Apply a layer of organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves, sugarcane trash, paddy straw) 5-10 cm thick around the base of the plants. This insulates the soil, protecting the root zone from freezing temperatures and reducing heat loss from the soil.
    *   **Row Covers/Low Tunnels:** For small-scale cultivation, cover plants with agro-textile (non-woven fabric) or clear plastic sheets supported by hoops to create low tunnels. Ensure covers do not touch the foliage. Remove covers during the day if temperatures rise significantly to allow for air circulation and sunlight.
    *   **Site Selection:** Plant mint in areas that are naturally sheltered from cold winds or near structures that can radiate heat. Avoid low-lying areas where cold air tends to settle.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure balanced nutrition, especially adequate potassium, which improves plant cell wall strength and overall stress tolerance.

*   **Chemical Interventions:**
    *   There are no CIBRC-approved technical chemical names specifically registered for direct protection of Mint from extreme cold or frost. Most effective strategies are cultural.

**II. Protection from Heat (Loo) and Intense Sunlight**

Mint thrives in moderate sunlight but can suffer from scorching and wilting under the intense heat and "Loo" winds of Haryana's summer.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Shade Nets:** Install green or black shade nets (typically 30-50% shade intensity) over the mint cultivation area during the peak summer months (April to June). This significantly reduces leaf temperature, prevents scorching, and lowers water evaporation from the plants and soil.
    *   **Frequent Light Irrigation:** During hot periods, provide frequent, light irrigations to keep the soil consistently moist. This helps cool the soil and plants through evaporative cooling. Avoid waterlogging, which can lead to root rot. Irrigate in the early morning or late evening to minimize water loss due to evaporation.
    *   **Mulching:** Maintain a thick layer of organic mulch (5-10 cm) around the plants. This is crucial for conserving soil moisture, reducing soil temperature, and suppressing weed growth, all of which help the plants cope with heat stress.
    *   **Planting Density:** Slightly increase planting density to allow plants to provide some self-shading to the soil and lower leaves.
    *   **Windbreaks:** If possible, plant taller crops or erect temporary windbreaks on the windward side to reduce the desiccating effect of hot "Loo" winds.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure adequate and balanced nutrient supply to maintain plant vigor, which enhances resilience to stress.

*   **Chemical Interventions:**
    *   There are no CIBRC-approved technical chemical names specifically registered for direct protection of Mint from heat stress or intense sunlight. Most effective strategies are cultural.
