As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified approaches to address micronutrient deficiencies in Mint. It is crucial to conduct a soil test to confirm specific deficiencies and their severity before applying any amendments.

**General Recommendations:**
*   **Soil Testing:** Always begin with a comprehensive soil test to accurately diagnose deficiencies and determine the required quantities of nutrients.
*   **Foliar Application:** For quick correction of micronutrient deficiencies, foliar sprays are generally more effective as they bypass soil interactions and allow direct absorption by leaves.
*   **Timing:** Apply foliar sprays during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to prevent scorching and improve absorption.
*   **Water Quality:** Use clean water for spray solutions.
*   **Adjuvants:** Consider adding a non-ionic spreading agent (surfactant) to foliar sprays to improve coverage and absorption.

Here's how to address specific micronutrient deficiencies:

### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Stunted growth, small leaves (often called 'little leaf'), interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, and sometimes bronzing of older leaves.

**Correction:**
*   **Foliar Application:**
    *   Spray 0.5% solution of **Zinc sulfate heptahydrate** (5 g/L of water) or 0.1% solution of **Zinc EDTA** (1 g/L of water).
    *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, starting when symptoms appear.
*   **Soil Application (if severe and soil test confirms):**
    *   Apply 25 kg/acre of **Zinc sulfate heptahydrate** at the time of planting or as a top dressing. This is generally done once every 2-3 years based on soil test recommendations.

### 2. Iron (Fe) / Ferrous Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Pronounced interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, with veins remaining distinctly green. In severe cases, leaves may turn almost white.

**Correction:**
*   **Foliar Application:**
    *   Spray 0.5% solution of **Ferrous sulfate heptahydrate** (5 g/L of water) or 0.1% solution of **Ferrous EDTA** (1 g/L of water).
    *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 7-10 day intervals until symptoms disappear. Foliar application is highly effective for iron deficiency, especially in alkaline soils common in Haryana.
*   **Soil Application (less effective in high pH soils):**
    *   If soil application is chosen, apply 10-20 kg/acre of **Ferrous sulfate heptahydrate** or 5-10 kg/acre of **Ferrous EDTA**.

### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Stunted growth, death of growing points (apical buds), thickened and brittle young leaves, and sometimes distorted leaf shape.

**Correction:**
*   **Foliar Application:**
    *   Spray 0.1-0.2% solution of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (1-2 g/L of water) or **Boric acid** (1-2 g/L of water).
    *   Apply 1-2 sprays during the active growth phase.
*   **Soil Application (use with caution to avoid toxicity):**
    *   Apply 2-4 kg/acre of **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate) or 1-2 kg/acre of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** at planting, based on soil test recommendations. Boron toxicity can occur easily, so precise application is critical.

### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Death of growing points, young leaves distorted, curled, or scorched at the margins (tip burn), and poor root development.

**Correction:**
*   **Foliar Application:**
    *   Spray 0.5-1.0% solution of **Calcium nitrate** (5-10 g/L of water) or **Calcium chloride** (5-10 g/L of water).
    *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals.
*   **Soil Application (preferred for long-term correction as Calcium is a macronutrient):**
    *   Apply **Calcium nitrate** (25-50 kg/acre) as a fertilizer.
    *   For soil amendment and pH correction, apply **Gypsum** (Calcium sulfate dihydrate) at 250-500 kg/acre for sodic soils, or **Calcium carbonate** (limestone) if soil pH is low.

### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, with veins remaining green. Leaves may become brittle and curl upwards.

**Correction:**
*   **Foliar Application:**
    *   Spray 1-2% solution of **Magnesium sulfate heptahydrate** (10-20 g/L of water).
    *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals.
*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply 10-20 kg/acre of **Magnesium sulfate heptahydrate** at planting or as a top dressing.
    *   If soil pH is low, **Dolomite** (Calcium magnesium carbonate) can be applied as per soil test recommendations.

### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, often accompanied by small necrotic (dead) spots. Stunted growth. Symptoms can resemble iron deficiency but typically appear on younger leaves first.

**Correction:**
*   **Foliar Application:**
    *   Spray 0.2-0.5% solution of **Manganese sulfate monohydrate** (2-5 g/L of water) or 0.1% solution of **Manganese EDTA** (1 g/L of water).
    *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals.
*   **Soil Application (less effective in high pH soils):**
    *   Apply 10-20 kg/acre of **Manganese sulfate monohydrate** at planting.

Always consult your local agricultural extension office or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's soil conditions and mint variety.
