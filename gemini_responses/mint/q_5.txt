As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm the following regarding the conditions you've mentioned for Mint (Mentha spp.):

*   **Scab:** This is not known to affect Mint.
*   **Canker:** This is not known to affect Mint.
*   **Gummosis:** This is not known to affect Mint.
*   **Lichen:** This is not known to affect Mint. Lichens are symbiotic organisms that typically grow on bark, rocks, or soil and are not parasitic to herbaceous plants like mint. They do not cause disease or damage to mint plants.
