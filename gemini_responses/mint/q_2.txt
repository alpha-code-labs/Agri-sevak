As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I will address your question regarding rust diseases in Mint.

First, let's clarify which of the mentioned rust diseases are known to affect Mint:

*   **Black Rust (Stem Rust - *Puccinia graminis*):** This is not known to affect Mint. It primarily affects cereals and grasses.
*   **Brown Rust (Leaf Rust - *Puccinia recondita* / *triticina*):** This is not known to affect Mint. It primarily affects cereals, especially wheat.
*   **Yellow Rust (Stripe Rust - *Puccinia striiformis*):** This is not known to affect Mint. It primarily affects cereals like wheat and barley.
*   **White Rust (*Albugo candida*):** This is not known to affect Mint. It is an oomycete disease primarily affecting cruciferous crops.
*   **Red Rust:** This term can be ambiguous. If it refers to the general reddish-brown appearance of rust pustules, then it is covered under Mint Rust. However, if it refers to specific pathogens like *Cephaleuros virescens* (algal leaf spot), then this is not known to affect Mint.

The primary and most common rust disease affecting Mint is **Mint Rust**, caused by the fungus ***Puccinia menthae***. This disease typically manifests as orange-brown pustules on the undersides of leaves and stems, which can later turn darker.

**Control Measures for Mint Rust (*Puccinia menthae*) in Haryana:**

Effective management of Mint Rust requires an integrated approach combining cultural practices and judicious use of CIBRC-approved fungicides.

**1. Cultural and Agronomic Practices:**

*   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy all infected plant debris, especially after harvest. This helps reduce the inoculum for the next season.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting mint in the same field year after year. A rotation with non-host crops for at least 2-3 years can significantly reduce soil-borne spores.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available and suitable for local conditions, choose mint varieties known to have resistance or tolerance to rust.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing (e.g., 30-45 cm between rows and 15-20 cm between plants) to improve air circulation within the canopy, which helps in drying leaf surfaces and reducing humidity, thereby inhibiting fungal spore germination.
*   **Irrigation Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day, as prolonged leaf wetness promotes rust development. Drip irrigation is preferred. If overhead irrigation is unavoidable, do it in the morning to allow leaves to dry quickly.
*   **Weed Control:** Keep the field free of weeds, as they can act as alternate hosts or create a humid microclimate conducive to disease development.
*   **Solarization:** In areas with severe soil-borne inoculum, soil solarization during the hot summer months can help reduce fungal spores in the soil before planting.

**2. Chemical Control (Fungicides):**

Fungicides should be applied preventatively or at the very first sign of disease symptoms. Always follow label instructions for dosage, application method, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).

*   **Propiconazole:** Apply **Propiconazole** 25% EC at a rate of 1 ml/L of water (or 200 ml per acre in 200 L of water). Repeat applications at 10-15 day intervals if disease pressure persists.
*   **Azoxystrobin:** Apply **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC at a rate of 0.5-1 ml/L of water (or 100-200 ml per acre in 200 L of water). This broad-spectrum fungicide is effective against rusts.
*   **Mancozeb:** For preventative control or early stages, **Mancozeb** 75% WP can be used at a rate of 2.5 g/L of water (or 500 g per acre in 200 L of water). It acts as a contact fungicide.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Alternation of Fungicides:** To prevent the development of fungicide resistance, it is crucial to alternate fungicides with different modes of action.
*   **Timing of Application:** Early detection and timely application are key to effective rust management.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always observe the specified pre-harvest interval for any fungicide used, especially for mint which is often harvested for culinary or medicinal purposes.

By implementing these measures, mint growers in Haryana can effectively manage Mint Rust and ensure healthy crop production.
