Here is the suitable climate, soil type, and drainage requirement for Mint cultivation:

**Climate:**
*   Mint thrives in a wide range of climates, from temperate to subtropical.
*   It prefers a mild climate with temperatures between 20-30°C for optimal growth.
*   While it requires good sunlight (at least 4-6 hours daily), it can tolerate partial shade, especially during the hot afternoon hours in Haryana's summer.
*   It is sensitive to severe frost, which can damage the foliage and rhizomes.
*   High temperatures combined with low humidity can stress the plants, requiring more frequent irrigation.

**Soil Type:**
*   Mint is adaptable but performs best in fertile, well-drained loamy to sandy-loam soils.
*   The soil should be rich in organic matter to support vigorous growth.
*   An ideal soil pH range is slightly acidic to neutral, between 6.0 and 7.0.
*   Heavy clay soils should be amended with organic matter (like well-rotted farmyard manure or compost) to improve structure and drainage.

**Drainage Requirement:**
*   Excellent drainage is crucial for mint cultivation.
*   While mint requires consistent moisture, it is highly susceptible to root rot in waterlogged conditions.
*   The soil must allow excess water to drain away quickly.
*   In areas with heavy soils or high rainfall, cultivation on raised beds can significantly improve drainage and prevent waterlogging.
