As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach for controlling Red Spider Mite (*Tetranychus urticae*) and Rust Mite (*Eriophyes menthae*) in Mint cultivation in Haryana. Both these mites are known to affect Mint and can cause significant damage if not managed properly.

**Understanding the Pests:**

*   **Red Spider Mite:** These tiny, reddish-brown mites are usually found on the undersides of leaves. They feed by piercing plant cells and sucking out sap, leading to characteristic stippling (tiny yellow or white spots) on the leaves. In severe infestations, fine webbing may be visible, and leaves can turn bronze and drop prematurely.
*   **Rust Mite:** These are microscopic, wedge-shaped mites that are difficult to see with the naked eye. Their feeding causes bronzing, russeting, curling, and distortion of leaves, especially new growth. Damage can often be mistaken for nutrient deficiencies or viral diseases.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies:**

1.  **Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
    *   **Regular Scouting:** Frequently inspect mint plants, especially the undersides of leaves, for early signs of mite infestation. Early detection is key to effective control.
    *   **Proper Irrigation:** Mites thrive in hot, dry, and dusty conditions. Overhead irrigation can help dislodge mites and increase humidity, making the environment less favorable for them. Ensure adequate soil moisture.
    *   **Field Hygiene:** Remove and destroy heavily infested plant parts or entire plants to reduce mite populations. Keep the area around mint beds free of weeds, which can host mites.
    *   **Pruning:** Prune heavily infested branches or leaves to reduce mite load.
    *   **Water Spray:** For small-scale infestations, a strong jet of water can physically dislodge mites from the plants.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Encourage natural enemies such as predatory mites (*Amblyseius* species, *Phytoseiulus persimilis*), ladybugs, lacewings, and minute pirate bugs. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

3.  **Chemical Control (Acaricides):**
    When cultural and biological methods are insufficient, CIBRC-approved acaricides can be used. Always rotate different classes of acaricides to prevent resistance development. Ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves.

    *   **For Red Spider Mite and Rust Mite:**
        *   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP:** Apply 2.0 - 3.0 kg per acre (or 2.0 - 3.0 g per litre of water). Sulphur is effective against both types of mites, especially rust mites, and also helps control powdery mildew.
        *   **Abamectin 1.9% EC:** Apply 150 - 200 ml per acre (or 0.75 - 1.0 ml per litre of water). Abamectin has translaminar action, providing good control of spider mites and some eriophyid mites.

    *   **Primarily for Red Spider Mite:**
        *   **Spiromesifen 240 SC:** Apply 80 - 100 ml per acre (or 0.4 - 0.5 ml per litre of water). Spiromesifen is a lipid biosynthesis inhibitor, highly effective against all stages of spider mites.
        *   **Propargite 57% EC:** Apply 1.0 - 1.25 litres per acre (or 5.0 - 6.25 ml per litre of water). Propargite is a contact acaricide effective against motile stages of spider mites.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always observe the recommended Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) for the chosen chemical. Mint is an edible crop, and residues must be below permissible limits at harvest. Check the product label for specific PHI.
*   **Spray Volume:** Ensure adequate spray volume (typically 200-400 litres per acre) for thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where mites reside.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying. Follow all instructions and safety precautions mentioned on the product label.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent mites from developing resistance. Do not use the same chemical repeatedly.

By implementing these strategies, mint growers in Haryana can effectively manage mite infestations and ensure healthy, productive crops.
