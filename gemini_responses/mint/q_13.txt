As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm the following regarding your query:

*   **Fruit fly:** This is not known to affect Mint. Fruit flies (Tephritidae family) primarily infest developing fruits of various horticultural crops like mango, guava, citrus, and cucurbits, not aromatic herbs like mint.
*   **Ber fly:** This is not known to affect Mint. Ber fly (Carpomyia vesuviana) is a specific pest of Ber (Ziziphus mauritiana) fruits.
