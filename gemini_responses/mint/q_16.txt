As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following fertilizer schedule for Mint cultivation in Haryana. These recommendations are based on general soil conditions in the region and assume good agricultural practices, including adequate irrigation. For precise recommendations, a soil test is highly advised.

Mint is a heavy feeder, especially for Nitrogen, and also requires significant amounts of Phosphorus, Potassium, and Sulphur for optimal growth, yield, and essential oil quality.

**General Nutrient Requirement (per acre per year for 3-4 cuttings):**
*   Nitrogen (N): 80-120 kg
*   Phosphorus (P2O5): 40-60 kg
*   Potassium (K2O): 40-60 kg
*   Sulphur (S): 20-30 kg

**Recommended Fertilizer Doses:**

**1. Basal Application (at planting or at the time of sprouting of rhizomes):**

*   **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)**: 100-110 kg per acre
    *   *Provides 18-20 kg N and 46-50 kg P2O5.*
*   **Muriate of Potash (MOP)**: 30-40 kg per acre
    *   *Provides 18-24 kg K2O.*
*   **Urea**: 60-70 kg per acre
    *   *Provides 27-32 kg N.*
*   **Bentonite Sulphur (90%)**: 25-30 kg per acre
    *   *Provides 22.5-27 kg S. This is crucial for oil synthesis and yield. If Single Super Phosphate (SSP) is used, separate Sulphur application might be reduced or not needed.*

**2. Top Dressing (after each cutting, typically 3-4 cuttings per year):**

*   **Urea**: 40-50 kg per acre
    *   *Apply after each cutting to support vigorous regrowth. Total N from top-dressing will be 120-200 kg N depending on number of cuttings.*
*   **Muriate of Potash (MOP)**: 15-20 kg per acre
    *   *Apply after each cutting to support plant health and nutrient balance. Total K2O from top-dressing will be 45-80 kg K2O depending on number of cuttings.*

**3. Alternative for Phosphorus and Sulphur:**

*   **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)**: If **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)** is not used, apply **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** at 300-350 kg per acre as a basal dose.
    *   *This will provide 43.5-50.75 kg P2O5 and 33-38.5 kg S, covering the Phosphorus and Sulphur requirements.*
    *   *In this case, the basal **Urea** dose would need to be adjusted upwards to compensate for the lower N content in SSP compared to DAP.*

**4. Complex NPK Fertilizers:**

*   **NPK (e.g., 12:32:16 or 10:26:26)**: If using a complex NPK fertilizer, apply 150-200 kg per acre as a basal dose.
    *   *This will provide a balanced start, but additional **Urea** and **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** will still be required as top-dressing after each cutting to meet the full nutrient demand.*

**5. Nano Fertilizers (Foliar Application - Supplementary):**

*   **Nano-Urea** (liquid): For supplementary nitrogen, especially during active growth phases or after cuttings, apply **Nano-Urea** at 2-4 ml/L of water.
    *   *Typically, 250-500 ml per acre per spray. Apply 2-3 sprays per cutting cycle, starting 15-20 days after cutting.*
*   **Nano-DAP** (liquid): For supplementary phosphorus and nitrogen, particularly during early growth or to boost plant vigor, apply **Nano-DAP** at 2-4 ml/L of water.
    *   *Typically, 250-500 ml per acre per spray. Apply 1-2 sprays during the initial growth phase or after cuttings.*

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Soil Testing:** The most accurate fertilizer recommendations are derived from a recent soil test report. Farmers are strongly encouraged to get their soil tested from HAU or other accredited laboratories.
*   **Organic Matter:** Incorporating 10-15 tonnes of well-decomposed Farmyard Manure (FYM) or compost per acre annually significantly improves soil health, nutrient availability, and water retention, potentially reducing the need for chemical fertilizers.
*   **Irrigation:** Ensure timely and adequate irrigation, as water availability is crucial for efficient nutrient uptake by the plants.
*   **Application Method:** Granular fertilizers should be broadcast evenly and incorporated into the soil, or applied in bands near the root zone. Foliar sprays should be applied during cooler parts of the day.
