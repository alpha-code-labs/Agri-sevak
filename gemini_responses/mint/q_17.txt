As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following doses of organic manures for mint cultivation in Haryana to ensure optimal growth and soil health:

1.  **Farmyard Manure (FYM):**
    *   Apply well-decomposed FYM at the time of land preparation, incorporating it thoroughly into the soil.
    *   **Recommended Dose:** 10-15 tonnes per acre (25-37.5 tonnes per hectare).

2.  **Vermicompost:**
    *   Vermicompost can be used as a supplement or partial replacement for FYM, especially for its higher nutrient content and microbial activity.
    *   **Recommended Dose:** 2-4 tonnes per acre (5-10 tonnes per hectare), applied at the time of land preparation or as a top dressing.

3.  **Sagarika (IFFCO):**
    *   Sagarika is a seaweed extract-based bio-stimulant that enhances nutrient uptake, plant growth, and stress tolerance. It is typically applied as a foliar spray or soil drench.
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   **Recommended Dose:** 2.5-5 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Application Timing:**
            *   First spray: 20-25 days after planting/sprouting.
            *   Second spray: 15-20 days after the first spray.
            *   Subsequent sprays can be given at similar intervals, especially after each harvest, to promote regrowth.
    *   **Soil Drench/Drip Application:**
        *   **Recommended Dose:** 1-2 litres per acre, mixed with irrigation water.
        *   **Application Timing:** At planting and subsequent applications during active growth phases.
