As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an integrated approach for effective weed management in Mint, combining cultural, mechanical, and chemical methods. This strategy is crucial for maximizing yield and quality of mint oil.

**I. General Weed Management Practices:**

1.  **Field Preparation:**
    *   Thorough ploughing and harrowing before planting mint suckers to remove existing weeds and their propagules.
    *   **Stale Seedbed Technique:** After initial land preparation, irrigate the field to encourage weed germination. Once weeds emerge (typically within 7-10 days), destroy them by light harrowing or by applying a non-selective herbicide like **Glyphosate** or **Paraquat dichloride** 7-10 days before planting mint. This significantly reduces the initial weed load.

2.  **Cultural and Mechanical Methods:**
    *   **Clean Planting Material:** Use only healthy, weed-free suckers/stolons for planting.
    *   **Intercultivation:** Regular inter-row cultivation (e.g., using a hand hoe or power weeder) is highly effective, especially in the early stages of crop growth and after each harvest. This disrupts weed growth and aerates the soil.
    *   **Hand Weeding:** Essential for removing weeds within the rows and for controlling specific problematic weeds that escape other methods. Perform hand weeding 20-30 days after planting and after each harvest.
    *   **Mulching:** Applying organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves) between rows can suppress weed growth, conserve moisture, and improve soil health.

**II. Chemical Weed Control (Herbicides):**

Herbicides should be used judiciously and strictly according to recommendations, ensuring proper application techniques and safety measures. Always use CIBRC approved technical chemical names.

**A. Pre-emergence Herbicides (Applied within 3 days of planting mint suckers):**
These herbicides form a chemical barrier on the soil surface, preventing weed germination. Ensure adequate soil moisture at the time of application.

*   For broadleaf and narrowleaf (grass) weeds:
    *   **Pendimethalin** 30% EC: Apply 1.3 - 1.7 litres per acre.
    *   **Oxyfluorfen** 23.5% EC: Apply 250 - 350 ml per acre.

**B. Post-emergence Herbicides (Applied after weed emergence):**
These are primarily for controlling grassy weeds, as selective broadleaf herbicides for mint are limited and can cause phytotoxicity.

*   For narrowleaf (grass) weeds (e.g., Phalaris minor, other annual grasses): Apply when grasses are at the 2-4 leaf stage.
    *   **Quizalofop-ethyl** 5% EC: Apply 400 - 600 ml per acre.
    *   **Fenoxaprop-p-ethyl** 9.3% EC: Apply 170 - 220 ml per acre.
    *   **Fluazifop-p-butyl** 25% EC: Apply 200 - 400 ml per acre.

*   For stale seedbed technique (before planting mint):
    *   **Glyphosate** 41% SL: Apply 1.0 - 1.5 litres per acre.
    *   **Paraquat dichloride** 24% SL: Apply 0.8 - 1.7 litres per acre.

**III. Control of Specific Weeds:**

*   **Broadleaf Weeds (e.g., Bathu, Congress grass):**
    *   **Bathu (Chenopodium album):** Effectively controlled by pre-emergence application of **Pendimethalin** or **Oxyfluorfen**. Hand weeding is also very effective against Bathu.
    *   **Congress grass (Parthenium hysterophorus):** Pre-emergence application of **Pendimethalin** can offer some control. Manual removal (wearing gloves to prevent allergic reactions) is highly recommended, especially before flowering to prevent seed dispersal.

*   **Narrowleaf Weeds (e.g., Phalaris minor):**
    *   **Phalaris minor:** Controlled by pre-emergence application of **Pendimethalin**. Post-emergence, graminicides like **Quizalofop-ethyl**, **Fenoxaprop-p-ethyl**, or **Fluazifop-p-butyl** are highly effective when applied at the recommended stage.

*   **Amarbail (Cuscuta spp. - Dodder):**
    *   Prevention is paramount. Use only clean, certified planting material and avoid using farmyard manure contaminated with Cuscuta seeds.
    *   If observed, immediately remove affected mint plants along with the Cuscuta strands and destroy them by burning to prevent spread.
    *   Spot application of non-selective herbicides like **Paraquat dichloride** or **Glyphosate** (with a shield to protect mint plants) can be used on isolated patches before the parasite spreads extensively. Pre-emergence application of **Pendimethalin** may offer some suppression of Cuscuta germination.

*   **Orobanche:**
    *   This is not known to affect Mint.

**IV. Important Precautions:**

*   Always read and follow the label instructions for any herbicide.
*   Use the correct dosage and apply herbicides uniformly with appropriate spray volume (typically 200-300 litres of water per acre for herbicides).
*   Apply herbicides on a calm day to avoid drift to non-target plants.
*   Wear protective clothing (gloves, mask, goggles) during handling and application.
*   Observe the recommended pre-harvest interval (PHI) for any herbicide used to ensure the safety of the harvested mint product.
*   Rotate herbicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of herbicide resistance in weeds.

By implementing these integrated weed management strategies, mint growers in Haryana can effectively control weeds and ensure a healthy, productive crop.
