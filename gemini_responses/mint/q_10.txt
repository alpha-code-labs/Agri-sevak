As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Mint (Mentha spp.) in Haryana:

### Pest Management in Mint

**1. Borers:**
This is not known to be a major or common pest affecting Mint.

**2. Caterpillars (General Defoliators):**
Various species of caterpillars can infest mint, feeding on leaves and causing defoliation. Early detection and intervention are crucial.

**Control Measures:**
*   **Cultural Practices:** Regular field monitoring, removal of weeds that can host pests, and proper sanitation.
*   **Biological Control:** Encourage natural enemies like parasitic wasps and predatory bugs.
*   **Chemical Control (for severe infestations):** Apply insecticides when caterpillars are in their early larval stages for best efficacy. Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.

    *   **Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) (e.g., 8% WP formulation):** 2-3 g/L of water. (Apply during early morning or late evening for best results, as UV light degrades Bt.)
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** 0.3 ml/L of water.
    *   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG:** 0.4-0.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Flubendiamide 20% WG:** 0.25-0.3 g/L of water.
    *   **Spinosad 45% SC:** 0.3-0.4 ml/L of water.

**3. Diamondback Moth (DBM):**
This is not known to affect Mint. Diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops.

**4. Leaf Folder:**
Leaf folders are lepidopteran larvae that fold mint leaves and feed from within, causing damage and reducing photosynthetic area.

**Control Measures:**
*   **Cultural Practices:** Field sanitation and removal of affected leaves can help reduce populations.
*   **Biological Control:** Natural enemies can help suppress populations.
*   **Chemical Control (for severe infestations):** Apply insecticides when larvae are young and before they are fully protected within the leaf folds.

    *   **Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) (e.g., 8% WP formulation):** 2-3 g/L of water.
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** 0.3 ml/L of water.
    *   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG:** 0.4-0.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Flubendiamide 20% WG:** 0.25-0.3 g/L of water.
    *   **Spinosad 45% SC:** 0.3-0.4 ml/L of water.

**General Recommendations for Mint:**
*   **Integrated Pest Management (IPM):** Always prioritize an IPM approach, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods.
*   **Residue Management:** Mint is an aromatic and medicinal crop. Always observe the recommended pre-harvest interval (PHI) for any chemical applied to minimize residues. Consult the product label for specific PHI.
*   **Spray Volume:** Ensure adequate spray volume (typically 200-250 L/acre) for thorough coverage of the foliage.
*   **Rotation of Chemicals:** To prevent the development of resistance, rotate insecticides with different modes of action.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) while handling and applying pesticides. Read and follow all instructions on the product label.
