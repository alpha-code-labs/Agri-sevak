As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified processes for Mint cultivation in Haryana.

It is important to note that Mint (Mentha spp.) is primarily propagated vegetatively using stolons, suckers, or runners, rather than seeds, for commercial cultivation. However, if seeds are used for specific purposes, a seed treatment can be applied.

### Seed Treatment (If Mint Seeds are Used)

If mint seeds are used, treatment is recommended to protect against seed-borne and soil-borne fungal pathogens causing damping-off and seedling blight.

*   **Fungicidal Treatment:**
    *   Treat seeds with **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 2 grams per kilogram of seed.
    *   Alternatively, treat with **Thiram** 75% WS at 2.5 grams per kilogram of seed.
*   **Bio-fungicidal Treatment:**
    *   Treat seeds with **Trichoderma viride** 1% WP at 4 grams per kilogram of seed.

### Planting Material Treatment (For Stolons/Suckers - The Common Method)

For the common practice of vegetative propagation, treating the stolons/suckers before planting is crucial to prevent the introduction and spread of soil-borne diseases.

*   **Fungicidal Dip:**
    *   Dip the stolons/suckers in a solution of **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 1 gram per litre of water for 15-20 minutes. Allow them to air dry slightly before planting.
*   **Bio-fungicidal Dip:**
    *   Alternatively, dip the stolons/suckers in a solution of **Trichoderma viride** 1% WP at 5 grams per litre of water for 30 minutes.

### Soil Treatment Process for Mint

Proper soil treatment is essential to manage soil-borne pathogens, nematodes, and improve overall soil health before planting mint.

1.  **Land Preparation:**
    *   Plough the field thoroughly to achieve a fine tilth.
    *   Incorporate 10-15 tonnes per acre of well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost into the soil during the last ploughing. This improves soil structure, fertility, and microbial activity.

2.  **Bio-control Agents for Soil-borne Diseases:**
    *   To suppress soil-borne fungal diseases such as *Rhizoctonia* and *Fusarium* wilt, apply **Trichoderma viride** 1% WP at 2.5 kg per acre. Mix the bio-fungicide with 50-100 kg of FYM or compost and broadcast evenly over the field before the last ploughing or planting.
    *   For additional protection against soil-borne pathogens, **Pseudomonas fluorescens** 1% WP can also be applied at 2.5 kg per acre, mixed with FYM/compost, and incorporated into the soil.

3.  **Nematode Management (If Nematodes are a Known Problem):**
    *   If nematode infestation is identified as a problem, apply the bio-nematicide **Purpureocillium lilacinum** (often sold as *Paecilomyces lilacinus*) 1% WP at 2.5 kg per acre. Mix it with 50-100 kg of FYM or compost and incorporate thoroughly into the soil before planting.

4.  **Soil Solarization (Optional):**
    *   In areas with a history of severe soil-borne diseases and high weed pressure, soil solarization can be an effective non-chemical method.
    *   Moisten the prepared soil and cover it tightly with transparent polyethylene sheets (100-150 micron thickness) for 4-6 weeks during the hot summer months (May-June). This process raises soil temperature, helping to reduce the population of pathogens, nematodes, and weed seeds.
