As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in Mint:

### Grasshopper in Mint

Grasshoppers are general feeders and can cause significant defoliation in mint by chewing on leaves and stems.

**Control Measures:**

1.  **Cultural Control:**
    *   Regularly inspect your mint plants for grasshopper activity.
    *   Hand-pick grasshoppers in the early morning when they are less active, especially for small infestations.
    *   Keep the area around your mint patch free of weeds and tall grasses, which can serve as breeding grounds and shelter for grasshoppers.

2.  **Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved):**
    *   For moderate to severe infestations, chemical control may be necessary. Always follow label instructions carefully, especially regarding pre-harvest intervals (PHI) for edible crops like mint.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: Apply at a rate of 0.5 ml per liter of water (or 200 ml per acre).
    *   **Malathion** 50% EC: Apply at a rate of 2 ml per liter of water.
    *   **Azadirachtin** (Neem oil) 1500 ppm: Apply at a rate of 5 ml per liter of water. This is a botanical insecticide with repellent and anti-feedant properties, suitable for organic approaches.

### Painted Bug in Mint

This is not known to affect Mint. Painted bugs primarily infest cruciferous crops like mustard, cabbage, and radish.

### Red Cotton Bug in Mint

This is not known to affect Mint. Red cotton bugs are primarily pests of cotton, okra, and other malvaceous plants.

### Black Ants in Mint

This is not known to directly damage Mint plants by feeding. Black ants are generally considered nuisance pests or may be present to feed on honeydew excreted by other sap-sucking insects (like aphids or mealybugs) that might be on the mint. If you observe ants, it is advisable to check for other primary pests.
