As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide scientifically verified advice for controlling various rot types in Mint (Mentha spp.) relevant to Haryana's agricultural conditions.

Rot diseases in Mint, including Root, Stem, Foot, Collar, Crown, Neck, Seed, and Seedling rot, are primarily caused by a complex of fungal pathogens such as *Rhizoctonia solani*, *Pythium* spp., *Fusarium* spp., and *Sclerotinia sclerotiorum*. These pathogens thrive in moist, poorly drained conditions and can cause significant yield losses.

**Integrated Disease Management (IDM) for Rot Control in Mint:**

A holistic approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods is most effective.

**1. Cultural and Agronomic Practices (Preventive Measures):**

*   **Healthy Planting Material:** Always use disease-free stolons/runners or seeds from reputable sources. Inspect planting material for any signs of discoloration or decay.
*   **Soil Preparation and Drainage:** Ensure well-drained soil. Amend heavy clay soils with organic matter to improve drainage and aeration. Raised beds can be beneficial in areas prone to waterlogging.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Maintain adequate plant spacing to ensure good air circulation, which helps reduce humidity around the plants and inhibits fungal growth.
*   **Irrigation Management:** Avoid overwatering. Water early in the day to allow foliage to dry before evening. Use drip irrigation where feasible to minimize wetting of leaves and stems.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate mint with non-host crops (e.g., cereals, maize) for at least 2-3 years to reduce pathogen build-up in the soil.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Promptly remove and destroy infected plants and plant debris to prevent the spread of pathogens.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced fertilization. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can lead to lush, tender growth more susceptible to disease.

**2. Biological Control:**

*   **Bio-fungicides:** Application of beneficial microorganisms like *Trichoderma viride* or *Pseudomonas fluorescens* as seed treatment or soil application can help suppress soil-borne pathogens.
    *   For seed/stolon treatment: 5-10 g of *Trichoderma viride* or *Pseudomonas fluorescens* formulation per kg of seed/planting material.
    *   For soil application: 2.5-5 kg of *Trichoderma viride* or *Pseudomonas fluorescens* formulation mixed with 50-100 kg of farmyard manure (FYM) per acre, applied before planting or as a drench.

**3. Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved Technical Chemical Names):**

Chemical interventions should be used judiciously and as part of an IDM strategy. Always follow label instructions for dosage and safety.

*   **For Planting Material Treatment (Seeds/Stolons/Runners):**
    *   Treat seeds or stolons before planting to protect against seed/seedling rot and early-stage root/collar rot.
    *   **Carbendazim**: 2-3 g per kg of seed/planting material.
    *   **Thiram**: 2-3 g per kg of seed/planting material.
    *   **Metalaxyl-M**: 1-2 g per kg of seed/planting material (especially effective against *Pythium*).

*   **For Soil Drench/Drip Application (for Root, Stem, Foot, Collar, Crown, Neck, Seedling Rot):**
    *   Apply as a drench around the base of plants or through drip irrigation, especially at the first sign of disease or in fields with a history of rot.
    *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride**: 2-3 ml per litre of water (drench 1-2 litres of solution per square meter).
    *   **Metalaxyl-M**: 1-1.5 g per litre of water.
    *   **Carbendazim**: 1-2 g per litre of water.
    *   **Thiophenate methyl**: 1-1.5 g per litre of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin**: 0.5-1 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Propiconazole**: 0.5-1 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Tebuconazole**: 0.5-1 ml per litre of water.

*   **For Foliar Spray (if rot symptoms extend to aerial parts like lower stems and leaves):**
    *   **Azoxystrobin**: 0.5-1 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Propiconazole**: 0.5-1 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Tebuconazole**: 0.5-1 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Carbendazim**: 1-1.5 g per litre of water.
    *   **Thiophenate methyl**: 1-1.5 g per litre of water.

**Specific Rot Types:**

*   **Fruit Rot:** This is not known to affect Mint, as mint is primarily cultivated for its leaves and essential oil, not its fruit.
*   **Black Rot:** While *Rhizoctonia* can cause dark, blackish lesions on mint stems and roots, "Black Rot" as a specific disease name is not commonly applied to Mint in the same way it is for other crops (e.g., Brassicas). The general rot management strategies outlined above will effectively address symptoms of blackening caused by common rot pathogens.

Always consult with local agricultural extension services or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and the prevailing disease pressure.
