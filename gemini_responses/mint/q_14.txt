Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the challenges posed by soil pests in mint cultivation. Both termites and root-knot nematodes can significantly impact mint yield and quality. Here's a scientifically verified approach for their control in Haryana:

It is crucial to adopt an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods for sustainable and effective control.

### Control of Termites in Mint

Termites can damage the root system and underground stems, leading to wilting and plant death.

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove all crop residues, stubble, and woody debris from the field before planting, as these can serve as food sources for termites.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** Expose termite colonies to sunlight and predators by deep ploughing the field during summer.
*   **Proper Irrigation:** Avoid water stress, as stressed plants are more susceptible to termite attack.

**2. Chemical Control (Pre-plant or Post-plant application):**
For severe infestations, chemical treatment can be effective. Ensure even distribution in the soil.

*   **Pre-plant Soil Treatment:**
    *   Apply **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** at 2-2.5 litres per acre mixed in 400-500 litres of water, and drench the soil thoroughly before planting.
*   **Post-plant Soil Application (if infestation occurs after planting):**
    *   Apply **Fipronil 0.3% GR** at 6.6-10 kg per acre by broadcasting evenly and incorporating into the soil, followed by light irrigation.
    *   Alternatively, drench the soil around affected plants with **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** at 2.5 ml per litre of water.

### Control of Root-Knot Nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.) in Mint

Root-knot nematodes cause galls or knots on the roots, impairing nutrient and water uptake, leading to stunted growth, yellowing, and reduced yield.

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate mint with non-host crops like cereals (wheat, maize) for at least 2-3 years to reduce nematode populations in the soil.
*   **Summer Solarization:** Cover the moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks during the hot summer months (May-June) to raise soil temperatures and kill nematodes.
*   **Use of Healthy Planting Material:** Always use nematode-free suckers or cuttings for planting.
*   **Organic Matter Addition:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost at 10-15 tonnes per acre, which improves soil health and promotes beneficial microorganisms that can suppress nematodes.

**2. Biological Control:**
Biological agents are highly recommended for nematode management, especially in edible crops like mint, as they are environmentally friendly and safe.

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Purpureocillium lilacinum** (formerly *Paecilomyces lilacinus*) 1% WP or 1% GR at 2.5-5 kg per acre. Mix with 100 kg of FYM or compost and apply uniformly to the soil before planting or around existing plants, followed by light irrigation. This fungus parasitizes nematode eggs and juveniles.

**3. Chemical Control (for severe infestations):**
Chemical nematicides should be used judiciously and strictly as per label instructions.

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Fluensulfone 2% GR** at 10-20 kg per acre by broadcasting evenly and incorporating into the soil before planting or as a side-dress application, followed by irrigation.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label for dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) while handling chemicals.
*   Consult your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and the latest CIBRC guidelines.
*   Maintain a proper harvest interval (PHI) if applying chemicals to ensure no harmful residues remain in the harvested mint.
