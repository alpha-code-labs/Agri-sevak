Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling Scale insects and Mealybugs in Mint. Both these pests can significantly damage mint plants by sucking sap, leading to stunted growth, yellowing leaves, and a sticky residue (honeydew) which can further lead to sooty mold development.

Here's how you can manage them:

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Control (First Line of Defense):**

*   **Regular Inspection:** Frequently check your mint plants, especially the undersides of leaves and stem joints, for early signs of pests.
*   **Pruning:** Immediately prune and destroy heavily infested leaves, stems, or entire plants to prevent the spread of pests.
*   **Strong Water Spray:** For minor infestations, a strong jet of water can dislodge scale insects and mealybugs from the plant. Repeat this every few days.
*   **Manual Removal:** For small infestations, you can manually remove mealybugs with a cotton swab dipped in rubbing alcohol (though be cautious not to damage the plant tissue).
*   **Improve Air Circulation:** Ensure good air circulation around your mint plants by proper spacing to reduce humidity, which can favor pest development.

**2. Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved Technical Chemicals):**

When cultural methods are insufficient, chemical control may be necessary. Always read the product label carefully for specific instructions, safety precautions, and pre-harvest intervals (PHI).

*   **For early stages/mild infestations (Bio-pesticide):**
    *   **Azadirachtin** (e.g., 1500 ppm EC formulation): Mix 5 ml per litre of water and spray thoroughly, ensuring coverage on both sides of the leaves and stems. Repeat every 7-10 days as needed.

*   **For moderate to severe infestations:**
    *   **Malathion** (e.g., 50% EC formulation): Mix 1.5-2 ml per litre of water. Spray thoroughly, covering all infested parts. Ensure a pre-harvest interval (PHI) of at least 7 days before harvesting mint for consumption.
    *   **Buprofezin** (e.g., 25% SC formulation): Mix 1.25 ml per litre of water. This is an insect growth regulator that primarily affects nymphs and eggs, preventing them from developing into adults. It is effective against both scales and mealybugs.
    *   **Spirotetramat** (e.g., 150 OD formulation): Mix 0.75-1 ml per litre of water. This is a systemic insecticide that moves within the plant, providing good control of sucking pests. Ensure proper coverage.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Thorough Coverage:** Ensure the spray solution thoroughly covers all parts of the plant, especially the undersides of leaves and stem crevices where these pests often hide.
*   **Repeat Applications:** Multiple applications at recommended intervals (e.g., 7-10 days) may be necessary to break the pest life cycle, especially for scale insects and mealybugs which have overlapping generations.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always strictly observe the Pre-Harvest Interval mentioned on the pesticide label. This is the minimum time that must pass between the last pesticide application and harvesting the crop to ensure the produce is safe for consumption.
*   **Safety:** Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (gloves, mask, eye protection) while handling and spraying pesticides. Keep children and pets away from treated areas.
*   **Integrated Pest Management (IPM):** Combine cultural, mechanical, and chemical methods for sustainable and effective pest control. Encourage natural enemies of these pests if possible.
