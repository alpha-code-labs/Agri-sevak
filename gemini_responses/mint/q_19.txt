Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the critical role of balanced nutrition for optimal growth and yield in mint cultivation. Macro-nutrient deficiencies can significantly impact your crop.

The most effective first step to address any nutrient deficiency is a comprehensive **soil test**. This will accurately determine the existing nutrient levels in your soil and allow for precise, targeted fertilization, preventing both deficiencies and over-application.

Here's how to address common macro-nutrient deficiencies in mint:

### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   General yellowing (chlorosis) of older leaves, starting from the tips and margins.
*   Stunted growth and reduced leaf size.
*   Pale green appearance of the entire plant.

**Correction:**

*   **Foliar Application (for quick, temporary relief in mild cases):**
    *   Dissolve **Urea** (46% N) at a concentration of 0.5-1.0% (5-10 g/L of water).
    *   Spray early in the morning or late in the evening to avoid scorching. Repeat after 7-10 days if needed.
    *   Alternatively, use a water-soluble NPK fertilizer like **NPK 19:19:19** at 5 g/L.

*   **Soil Application (primary method for sustained correction):**
    *   Apply **Urea** (46% N) at 20-30 kg/acre as a top dressing. This should be split into 2-3 applications during the growing season, especially after each harvest.
    *   Alternatively, **Calcium Ammonium Nitrate (CAN)** (25% N) can be used at 35-50 kg/acre, also in split doses.
    *   If phosphorus is also deficient, **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5) can be applied at 25-35 kg/acre as a basal dose or early in the season.

### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   Dark green or purplish discoloration of older leaves, especially on the underside.
*   Stunted growth, poor root development.
*   Delayed maturity and reduced tillering.
*   Leaves may appear stiff and upright.

**Correction:**

*   **Soil Application (Phosphorus is less mobile in soil, so foliar application is less effective):**
    *   Apply **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5) at 150-200 kg/acre as a basal dose before planting or early in the growing season.
    *   Alternatively, **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5) can be applied at 50-70 kg/acre as a basal dose. This will also supply some nitrogen.
    *   Ensure the fertilizer is incorporated into the soil near the root zone for better availability.

### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   Yellowing and browning (scorching) of leaf margins and tips, especially on older leaves.
*   Weak stems, leading to lodging.
*   Reduced disease resistance and overall plant vigor.
*   Poor essential oil quality and quantity.

**Correction:**

*   **Soil Application (primary method):**
    *   Apply **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** / **Potassium Chloride** (60% K2O) at 30-50 kg/acre as a basal dose or in split applications during the growing season.
    *   Alternatively, **Sulphate of Potash (SOP)** / **Potassium Sulphate** (50% K2O) can be used at 35-60 kg/acre, especially if sulfur is also deficient or if chloride sensitivity is a concern (though mint is generally not highly sensitive).

### General Recommendations for Nutrient Management in Mint:

*   **Soil Testing is Paramount:** Always start with a soil test to get precise recommendations for your specific field conditions. Contact your nearest Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or HAU extension center for soil testing services.
*   **Balanced Fertilization:** While addressing deficiencies, ensure a balanced supply of all essential nutrients. Over-application of one nutrient can induce deficiencies of others.
*   **Organic Matter:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost (10-15 tonnes/acre) into the soil. Organic matter improves soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability.
*   **Split Applications:** For highly mobile nutrients like Nitrogen and Potassium, applying them in split doses throughout the growing season (especially after each harvest) ensures continuous availability to the plant and minimizes losses due to leaching.
*   **Proper Irrigation:** Adequate and timely irrigation is crucial for nutrient uptake by the roots. Water stress can hinder nutrient absorption even if nutrients are present in the soil.

By following these scientifically verified practices, you can effectively manage macro-nutrient deficiencies and ensure healthy, productive mint cultivation in Haryana.
