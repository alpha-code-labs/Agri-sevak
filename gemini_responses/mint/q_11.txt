Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU), Hisar, I understand the challenges you face in protecting your mint crop from various pests. Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies can cause significant damage if not managed effectively. Here's a scientifically verified approach for their control in Haryana:

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategy for Mint Pests:**

A holistic approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods is crucial for sustainable pest management in mint.

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Regularly remove weeds from and around the mint fields, as they can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
*   **Crop Rotation:** While mint is often perennial, if grown as an annual, rotate with non-host crops to break the pest life cycle, especially for soil-dwelling weevil larvae.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** After harvest or during fallow periods, deep ploughing can expose soil-dwelling larvae and pupae of beetles and weevils to predators and adverse weather conditions.
*   **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your mint plants for early signs of pest infestation (e.g., chewed leaves, presence of adults or larvae). Early detection allows for timely intervention.

**2. Biological Control:**
*   **Natural Enemies:** Encourage beneficial insects like ladybugs, lacewings, and parasitic wasps, which prey on or parasitize pest larvae and adults. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides when natural enemy populations are high.
*   **Entomopathogenic Nematodes (EPNs):** For soil-dwelling larvae of root weevils and some beetles, application of specific EPNs like *Heterorhabditis bacteriophora* or *Steinernema carpocapsae* to the soil can be highly effective. Apply these nematodes when soil moisture is adequate and temperature is suitable for their activity.

**3. Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved Technical Chemicals):**
When pest populations reach economic threshold levels, judicious use of CIBRC-approved insecticides is necessary. Always follow label instructions for dosage, application method, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).

**A. For Beetles (e.g., Flea Beetles, Leaf Beetles):**
Adult beetles feed on leaves, causing shot-hole damage or defoliation. Larvae of some species may feed on roots.
*   **Foliar Spray:**
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** 0.5 ml per litre of water (or 200 ml per acre in 400 litres of water).
    *   **Spinosad 45% SC:** 0.25 ml per litre of water (or 100 ml per acre in 400 litres of water).
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** 0.5 ml per litre of water (or 200 ml per acre in 400 litres of water), particularly effective against flea beetles.

**B. For Weevils (e.g., Mint Root Weevil, Strawberry Root Weevil):**
Adult weevils notch leaf margins, while their larvae are serious pests, feeding on roots and causing plant wilting and death.
*   **For Adult Weevils (Foliar Spray):**
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** 0.5 ml per litre of water (or 200 ml per acre in 400 litres of water).
    *   **Spinosad 45% SC:** 0.25 ml per litre of water (or 100 ml per acre in 400 litres of water).
*   **For Larval Weevils (Soil Drench/Application):**
    *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC:** 2.5 litres per acre mixed in sufficient water for drenching around the root zone. Apply when larvae are active in the soil. Ensure adequate soil moisture for effectiveness.
    *   *Alternatively, consider the biological control option of Entomopathogenic Nematodes mentioned above for root weevil larvae.*

**C. For Sawflies (e.g., Mint Sawfly):**
Sawfly larvae resemble caterpillars and feed on mint leaves, causing defoliation.
*   **Foliar Spray:**
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** 0.5 ml per litre of water (or 200 ml per acre in 400 litres of water).
    *   **Spinosad 45% SC:** 0.25 ml per litre of water (or 100 ml per acre in 400 litres of water).

**General Precautions for Chemical Application:**
*   **Safety First:** Always wear protective clothing (gloves, mask, goggles) during mixing and spraying.
*   **Timing:** Spray during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough coverage of the plant foliage, especially the undersides of leaves where pests often hide.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Strictly observe the specified pre-harvest interval for each chemical to avoid residues in the harvested mint. This is crucial, especially for mint used for culinary purposes or essential oil extraction.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pest resistance.
