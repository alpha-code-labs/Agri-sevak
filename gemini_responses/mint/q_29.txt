This is not known to affect Mint as a significant yield-limiting problem requiring specific control measures.

Mint (Mentha spp.) is primarily cultivated for its leaves and essential oil. While mint plants do produce flowers, "flower drop" is not typically considered a major issue affecting the economic yield (leaves) of the crop. Furthermore, the terms "fruit drop," "Tinda dropping," and "boll dropping" are not applicable to mint cultivation, as mint does not produce fruits or bolls in the horticultural sense that would be subject to dropping and impact commercial yield.

If a mint plant appears unhealthy or is shedding flowers prematurely, it is usually a symptom of general plant stress due to factors such as:
*   **Nutrient deficiencies:** Especially phosphorus or potassium.
*   **Water stress:** Both overwatering and underwatering.
*   **Extreme temperatures:** Heat stress or cold stress.
*   **Pest infestations:** Sucking pests can weaken the plant.
*   **Disease:** Fungal or bacterial infections affecting overall plant health.
*   **Poor light conditions.**

Addressing these underlying stress factors through good agricultural practices is key to maintaining healthy mint plants.
