Green Gram (Moong Dal) is predominantly a direct-seeded crop, and **transplantation is generally not recommended or practiced for its commercial cultivation.** This is primarily due to its sensitive taproot system, which is highly susceptible to transplant shock, leading to poor establishment, delayed maturity, and significant yield reduction.

Therefore, instead of transplantation, the following are the ideal practices for **direct seeding** Green Gram in Haryana:

*   **Ideal Sowing Time:**
    *   **Kharif Season:** First fortnight of July (typically July 1st to July 15th), coinciding with the onset of monsoon.
    *   **Spring/Summer Season:** Mid-March to Mid-April, after the harvest of Rabi crops like wheat.

*   **Ideal Sowing Distance:**
    *   **Row-to-Row Distance:** 30 cm (for Kharif) to 45 cm (for Spring/Summer, to allow better light penetration and air circulation in warmer conditions).
    *   **Plant-to-Plant Distance:** 10 cm.
    *   *Note:* These distances are achieved by maintaining an appropriate seed rate (typically 15-20 kg/acre for Kharif and 20-25 kg/acre for Spring/Summer) and thinning if necessary.

*   **Ideal Sowing Process (Direct Seeding):**
    *   **Land Preparation:**
        *   One deep ploughing followed by 2-3 harrowing operations to achieve a fine, firm, and well-levelled seedbed.
        *   Ensure good drainage, especially for the Kharif season.
    *   **Seed Treatment:**
        *   Treat seeds with a fungicide like **Carbendazim** (1 g/kg seed) + **Thiram** (2 g/kg seed) or **Captan** (2.5 g/kg seed) to protect against seed-borne diseases and damping-off.
        *   Subsequently, treat with a suitable rhizobium inoculant (e.g., *Rhizobium phaseoli*) at 5-10 g/kg seed, along with PSB (Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria) inoculant, just before sowing. This enhances nitrogen fixation and phosphorus availability.
    *   **Sowing Depth:**
        *   Sow seeds at a depth of 3-5 cm. Deeper sowing can delay emergence, while shallower sowing can expose seeds to birds and moisture stress.
    *   **Method of Sowing:**
        *   Sow using a seed drill or by dibbling, ensuring uniform distribution and proper depth.
        *   Maintain the recommended row and plant spacing.

By adhering to these direct seeding practices, farmers can ensure optimal establishment, growth, and yield of Green Gram in Haryana.
