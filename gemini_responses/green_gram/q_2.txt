As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling rust diseases in Green Gram (Mungbean) in Haryana.

Firstly, it is important to clarify the specific rust diseases mentioned:
*   The primary rust disease affecting Green Gram is caused by *Uromyces appendiculatus*.
*   **Black Rust, Brown Rust, and Yellow Rust** are specific rust diseases primarily affecting cereal crops like wheat and barley, caused by different *Puccinia* species. These are not known to affect Green Gram.
*   **White Rust** is caused by *Albugo* species and primarily affects cruciferous crops and some other plant families, but not Green Gram.
*   **Red Rust** is an algal disease caused by *Cephaleuros virescens*, affecting perennial crops like tea, coffee, and guava, but not Green Gram.

Therefore, the control measures below are specifically for the **Rust disease caused by *Uromyces appendiculatus*** in Green Gram.

**Control Measures for Rust (*Uromyces appendiculatus*) in Green Gram:**

An Integrated Disease Management (IDM) approach is recommended for effective control:

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Plant rust-resistant or tolerant varieties suitable for Haryana. Consult with HAU or local agricultural extension for the latest recommended varieties (e.g., MH 421, MH 1142, SML 668, PDM 139, Pusa Vishal, etc., depending on specific regional suitability and availability).
*   **Timely Sowing:** Sow the crop at the recommended time to avoid periods highly conducive for rust development.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest to reduce inoculum for the next season.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops to break the disease cycle.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure balanced fertilization, as excessive nitrogen can sometimes make plants more susceptible.

**2. Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
Fungicides should be applied at the first appearance of symptoms or when environmental conditions are highly favorable for disease development (e.g., high humidity, moderate temperatures). Repeat application may be necessary after 10-15 days, depending on disease severity and weather conditions. Always ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.

The following CIBRC approved technical chemical names are recommended:

*   **Propiconazole 25% EC:**
    *   Dosage: 250 ml per acre in 200-250 litres of water.
*   **Difenoconazole 25% EC:**
    *   Dosage: 100 ml per acre in 200-250 litres of water.
*   **Tebuconazole 250 EC:**
    *   Dosage: 250 ml per acre in 200-250 litres of water.
*   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:**
    *   Dosage: 200 ml per acre in 200-250 litres of water.
*   **Mancozeb 75% WP:** (Contact fungicide, effective as a preventive spray or at early stages)
    *   Dosage: 600-800 g per acre in 200-250 litres of water.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the fungicide label carefully, including safety precautions and pre-harvest intervals (PHI).
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of fungicide resistance.
*   Consult your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and the prevailing disease situation.
