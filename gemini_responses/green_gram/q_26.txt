As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide the following information regarding specialized practices in Green Gram (Mung Bean) cultivation, keeping in mind the conditions in Haryana:

*   **Pruning:** This is not known to be a specialized practice for Green Gram. Green Gram is an annual crop with a growth habit that does not typically benefit from pruning. Removing plant parts would generally reduce the photosynthetic area and potential yield.

*   **Desuckering:** This is not known to be a specialized practice for Green Gram. Green Gram plants do not produce suckers in a manner that requires removal for improved yield or plant health.

*   **Mulching:** Mulching is a beneficial practice for Green Gram, especially in the agro-climatic conditions of Haryana.
    *   **Moisture Conservation:** Helps in retaining soil moisture, crucial during dry spells and for efficient water use.
    *   **Weed Suppression:** Reduces weed growth, thereby minimizing competition for nutrients and water.
    *   **Soil Temperature Regulation:** Moderates soil temperature, protecting roots from extreme heat or cold.
    *   **Soil Health Improvement:** Organic mulches (e.g., crop residues, straw) decompose over time, adding organic matter and improving soil structure.
    *   **Application:** Mulch can be applied after sowing or after initial plant establishment.

*   **Grafting:** This is not known to be a specialized practice for Green Gram. Green Gram is an annual crop propagated by seed, and grafting is not a technique used in its cultivation.

*   **Pollination:** This is not known to be a specialized practice for Green Gram. Green Gram is predominantly a self-pollinated crop. Its flowers are structured to facilitate self-pollination, and external agents like insects are not typically required for successful fruit set and seed development in commercial production.
