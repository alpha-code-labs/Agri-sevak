Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU), Hisar, I recommend the following scientifically verified strategies for effective weed control in Green Gram (Moong bean) in Haryana. Integrated weed management, combining cultural practices with judicious use of CIBRC-approved herbicides, is crucial for maximizing yields.

**General Weed Management Principles:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Timely Sowing:** Sowing at the optimal time helps the crop establish quickly and compete better with weeds.
    *   **Clean Seed:** Use certified, weed-free seed to prevent the introduction of new weed species, especially parasitic ones like Amarbail.
    *   **Proper Seedbed Preparation:** A well-prepared, fine seedbed promotes uniform crop emergence and reduces initial weed pressure.
    *   **Inter-cultivation/Hand Weeding:** One or two hand weedings at 20-25 and 40-45 days after sowing (DAS) are highly effective, especially for managing weeds that escape chemical control. Mechanical inter-cultivation can also be done between rows.

2.  **Chemical Control (Herbicides):**
    *   Always ensure proper soil moisture at the time of herbicide application for optimal efficacy.
    *   Use recommended spray volume (typically 200-300 litres of water per acre) with a flat fan nozzle for uniform coverage.

**Specific Recommendations for Weeds in Green Gram:**

*   **Orobanche:** This is not known to affect Green Gram.

*   **Broadleaf Weeds (including Bathu, Congress grass) and Narrow Leaf Weeds (Grassy Weeds, including Phalaris minor):**

    *   **Pre-Emergence Application (within 0-3 days after sowing):**
        *   Apply **Pendimethalin** 30% EC at 1.0 kg active ingredient (a.i.) per acre (equivalent to 3.3 litres of product per acre) mixed in 200-300 litres of water. This provides effective control of most annual broadleaf and narrow leaf weeds.
        *   Alternatively, **Pendimethalin** 30% G (Granules) can be broadcast at 1.0 kg a.i. per acre (equivalent to 3.3 kg of product per acre) immediately after sowing, followed by light irrigation if soil moisture is insufficient.

    *   **Post-Emergence Application (15-20 days after sowing, when weeds are at 2-4 leaf stage):**
        *   For control of both broadleaf and narrow leaf weeds:
            *   Apply **Imazethapyr** 10% SL at 75-100 g a.i. per acre (equivalent to 300-400 ml of product per acre) mixed in 200-300 litres of water.
        *   For specific control of narrow leaf (grassy) weeds:
            *   Apply **Quizalofop-ethyl** 10% EC at 50 g a.i. per acre (equivalent to 500 ml of product per acre) mixed in 200-300 litres of water.
            *   Alternatively, apply **Fenoxaprop-p-ethyl** 9% EC at 45 g a.i. per acre (equivalent to 500 ml of product per acre) mixed in 200-300 litres of water.
        *   For specific control of broadleaf weeds:
            *   Apply **Bentazon** 48% SL at 1.0 kg a.i. per acre (equivalent to 2.0 litres of product per acre) mixed in 200-300 litres of water.

*   **Amarbail (Cuscuta spp.):**
    *   **Prevention is paramount:** Use only certified, Amarbail-free seeds. Avoid using farmyard manure or irrigation water contaminated with Amarbail seeds.
    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   **Pre-emergence application of Pendimethalin** (as mentioned above) can offer some suppression of Amarbail germination.
        *   Once Amarbail infestation is observed, manual removal (hand pulling) before it flowers and sets seed is the most effective method to prevent its spread.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the herbicide label carefully.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application.
*   Avoid herbicide drift to non-target crops.
*   Rotate herbicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of herbicide resistance.
