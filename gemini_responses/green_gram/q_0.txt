As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Green Gram (Moong bean) in Haryana. Effective management relies on an integrated approach combining cultural practices and judicious use of CIBRC-approved fungicides.

**General Cultural Practices for Fungal Disease Management in Green Gram:**

*   **Use Certified, Disease-Free Seeds:** Always source seeds from reliable suppliers to prevent seed-borne diseases.
*   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds with recommended fungicides to protect against early seedling diseases.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid continuous cultivation of Green Gram or other susceptible pulse crops in the same field. Rotate with non-host crops like cereals.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest to reduce inoculum for the next season.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Maintain optimal plant spacing to ensure good air circulation, which reduces humidity and fungal growth.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced fertilizers. Excessive nitrogen can make plants more susceptible to some fungal diseases.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available and suitable for your region, choose Green Gram varieties known for resistance to common fungal diseases.
*   **Timely Sowing:** Sow crops at the recommended time to avoid periods of high disease pressure.

        *   Foliar spray of **Mancozeb** 75% WP at 2.5-3.0 g/L of water (or 2.0-2.5 kg/acre).
        *   Foliar spray of **Chlorothalonil** 75% WP at 2.0-2.5 g/L of water (or 1.5-2.0 kg/acre).
        *   Foliar spray of **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC at 0.5 ml/L of water (or 200 ml/acre).

**2. Anthracnose**
This disease is known to affect Green Gram.
*   **Symptoms:** Dark, sunken lesions on leaves, stems, and pods, often with a reddish-brown margin.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Cultural:** Use disease-free seeds, crop rotation, and sanitation.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   Seed treatment with **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 2-3 g/kg of seed.
        *   Foliar spray of **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 0.5-1.0 g/L of water (or 250-500 g/acre).
        *   Foliar spray of **Thiophanate Methyl** 70% WP at 1.0-1.5 g/L of water (or 500-700 g/acre).
        *   Foliar spray of **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC at 0.5 ml/L of water (or 200 ml/acre).
        *   Foliar spray of **Mancozeb** 75% WP at 2.5-3.0 g/L of water (or 2.0-2.5 kg/acre).

**3. Blast**
This is not known to affect Green Gram as a primary or common disease. Blast is predominantly a disease of rice.

**4. Blight (e.g., Leaf Blight, Web Blight)**
Various blights are known to affect Green Gram.
*   **Symptoms:** Water-soaked lesions, browning, wilting, and defoliation, often leading to significant yield loss.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Cultural:** Crop rotation, proper plant spacing, good drainage, and use of resistant varieties if available.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   Foliar spray of **Mancozeb** 75% WP at 2.5-3.0 g/L of water (or 2.0-2.5 kg/acre).
        *   Foliar spray of **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 0.5-1.0 g/L of water (or 250-500 g/acre).
        *   Foliar spray of **Propiconazole** 25% EC at 0.5 ml/L of water (or 200-250 ml/acre).
        *   Foliar spray of **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC at 0.5 ml/L of water (or 200 ml/acre).

**5. Brown Spot**
This disease is known to affect Green Gram (often caused by *Cercospora* or *Alternaria* species).
*   **Symptoms:** Circular to irregular brown spots on leaves, sometimes with a yellow halo.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Cultural:** Crop rotation, use of resistant varieties.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   Foliar spray of **Mancozeb** 75% WP at 2.5-3.0 g/L of water (or 2.0-2.5 kg/acre).
        *   Foliar spray of **Chlorothalonil** 75% WP at 2.0-2.5 g/L of water (or 1.5-2.0 kg/acre).
        *   Foliar spray of **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 0.5-1.0 g/L of water (or 250-500 g/acre).

**6. Downy Mildew**

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the label instructions for any chemical product, including dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in fungal pathogens.
*   Monitor your fields regularly for early signs of disease to enable timely intervention.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and current disease prevalence in Haryana.
