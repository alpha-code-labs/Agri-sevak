As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I am pleased to provide scientifically verified advice to enhance the yield, fruit quality, and storage life of Green Gram (Moong Dal) in Haryana.

### **I. Improving Yield**

To maximize Green Gram yield, an integrated approach focusing on genetic potential, optimal cultural practices, and effective pest and disease management is crucial.

1.  **Variety Selection:**
    *   Choose high-yielding, short-duration, and disease-resistant varieties recommended for Haryana, such as MH 421, MH 318, MH 1142, SML 668, or Pusa Vishal. These varieties are adapted to the local agro-climatic conditions.

2.  **Sowing Management:**
    *   **Timely Sowing:** Kharif Green Gram should be sown during the first fortnight of July. Spring/Summer Green Gram can be sown from mid-February to mid-March.
    *   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds with a fungicide and insecticide to protect against early seedling diseases and pests.
        *   Fungicide: **Carbendazim** 1 g/kg seed + **Thiram** 2 g/kg seed, or **Carboxin** 37.5% + **Thiram** 37.5% WS @ 3 g/kg seed.
        *   Insecticide: **Imidacloprid** 600 FS @ 5-7 ml/kg seed.
    *   **Rhizobium Inoculation:** Inoculate seeds with **Rhizobium** culture @ 200 g/10-15 kg seed, especially if Green Gram is being grown for the first time or after a long gap in the field. This enhances nitrogen fixation.
    *   **Spacing:** Maintain a row-to-row distance of 30 cm and plant-to-plant distance of 10 cm.
    *   **Seed Rate:** Use 15-20 kg/acre for Kharif and 8-10 kg/acre for Spring/Summer Green Gram.

3.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Basal Fertilization:** Apply fertilizers based on soil test reports. In the absence of a soil test, a general recommendation is:
        *   Nitrogen (N): 8-10 kg/acre (e.g., 18-22 kg Urea/acre) as a starter dose.
        *   Phosphorus (P2O5): 16-24 kg/acre (e.g., 100-150 kg Single Super Phosphate/acre). Phosphorus is critical for root development and nodulation.
        *   Potassium (K2O): 8 kg/acre (e.g., 13 kg Muriate of Potash/acre) if soil test indicates deficiency.
    *   **Micronutrients:**
        *   Zinc (Zn): If deficiency is observed or suspected, apply **Zinc Sulphate** @ 10 kg/acre as basal or foliar spray of 0.5% **Zinc Sulphate** solution (5 g/L water) at 30-40 days after sowing.
        *   Boron (B): For improved flowering and pod setting, spray 0.2% **Borax** solution (2 g/L water) at pre-flowering stage.
        *   Molybdenum (Mo): Essential for nitrogen fixation. Apply **Ammonium Molybdate** @ 100 g/acre mixed with basal fertilizers or as a foliar spray @ 0.05% (0.5 g/L water) at 20-30 days after sowing.

4.  **Water Management:**
    *   Green Gram is relatively drought-tolerant, but critical irrigation at flowering and pod development stages can significantly boost yield. Avoid waterlogging.

5.  **Weed Management:**
    *   Weeds compete heavily with Green Gram, especially during the first 30-45 days.
    *   **Pre-emergence:** Apply **Pendimethalin** 30% EC @ 1.0-1.3 L/acre in 200-300 L water within 2-3 days of sowing.
    *   **Post-emergence:** For broad-leaf weeds, apply **Imazethapyr** 10% SL @ 400 ml/acre in 200 L water at 15-20 days after sowing. For grassy weeds, apply **Quizalofop-ethyl** 5% EC @ 400 ml/acre in 200 L water at 15-20 days after sowing.

6.  **Pest Management:**
    *   **Sucking Pests (Aphids, Jassids, Whiteflies):** These can cause direct damage and transmit viral diseases like Yellow Mosaic Virus (YMV).
        *   Spray **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL @ 125 ml/acre or **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG @ 50 g/acre in 200 L water at the initial stage of infestation. Repeat if necessary.
    *   **Pod Borers (Helicoverpa armigera, Maruca vitrata):**
        *   At flowering/pod initiation, if infestation is observed, spray **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC @ 60 ml/acre or **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG @ 80-100 g/acre in 200 L water.

7.  **Disease Management:**
    *   **Yellow Mosaic Virus (YMV):** This is a major viral disease transmitted by whiteflies.
        *   Use resistant varieties.
        *   Control whitefly vectors as mentioned under sucking pests.
        *   Remove and destroy infected plants immediately.
    *   **Powdery Mildew:** White powdery patches on leaves.
        *   Spray **Sulphur** 80% WP @ 1.0 kg/acre or **Myclobutanil** 10% WP @ 100 g/acre in 200 L water at the appearance of symptoms.
    *   **Cercospora Leaf Spot:** Small, circular spots with reddish-brown margins.
        *   Spray **Mancozeb** 75% WP @ 500 g/acre or **Carbendazim** 50% WP @ 200 g/acre in 200 L water at the appearance of symptoms.

8.  **Plant Growth Regulators:**
    *   To reduce flower drop and improve pod setting, spray **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA)** @ 20 ppm (20 mg/L water) at the pre-flowering stage (around 30-35 days after sowing).

### **II. Improving Fruit Quality (Grain Quality)**

High-quality Green Gram grains are plump, uniform in size, free from damage, and have good colour.

1.  **Balanced Nutrition:**
    *   Adequate supply of Phosphorus, Potassium, and micronutrients like Boron and Molybdenum (as mentioned above) is crucial for proper grain filling and development, leading to bolder and healthier grains.
    *   Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can lead to lush vegetative growth at the expense of pod development.

2.  **Effective Pest and Disease Control:**
    *   Healthy plants, free from pest and disease damage, produce superior quality grains. Pests like pod borers directly damage grains, while diseases can reduce photosynthetic efficiency, leading to shrivelled grains.

3.  **Timely Harvesting:**
    *   Harvest when 80-85% of the pods have matured and turned yellow to blackish. Over-ripening can lead to shattering and loss, while premature harvesting results in shrivelled, immature grains.
    *   Harvesting in stages might be necessary for varieties with indeterminate growth habits.

### **III. Improving Storage Life**

Proper post-harvest handling and storage are critical to prevent losses and maintain quality.

1.  **Proper Drying:**
    *   This is the most crucial step. Dry the harvested pods/grains thoroughly to reduce moisture content to 8-10%. High moisture content promotes fungal growth and insect infestation.
    *   Spread grains thinly on a clean, dry surface in the sun or use mechanical dryers.

2.  **Cleaning and Grading:**
    *   Clean the grains thoroughly to remove dirt, chaff, stones, and damaged grains. Grading can further improve market value.

3.  **Storage Conditions:**
    *   Store Green Gram in clean, dry, well-ventilated, and cool conditions.
    *   Use airtight containers (metal bins, plastic drums) or clean jute bags lined with plastic sheets to prevent moisture re-absorption and pest entry.
    *   Ensure the storage area is free from rodents and birds.

4.  **Post-Harvest Pest Management:**
    *   **Sanitation:** Clean the storage premises thoroughly before storing new produce. Remove all old grain residues.
    *   **Preventive Treatment:**
        *   For large-scale storage in godowns, spray the inner walls and floor with **Malathion** 50% EC @ 10 ml/L water, 2-3 weeks before storing grains.
        *   For small-scale storage, mix inert dusts like diatomaceous earth with grains, if available and approved.
    *   **Fumigation (for infested grains/storage):**
        *   If infestation is detected, fumigate with **Aluminium Phosphide** tablets @ 1-2 tablets (3 g each) per tonne of grain, for 5-7 days in an airtight storage structure. This should only be done by trained personnel with proper safety precautions.

By diligently following these recommendations, farmers in Haryana can significantly improve the yield, quality, and storage life of their Green Gram crop, leading to better economic returns.
