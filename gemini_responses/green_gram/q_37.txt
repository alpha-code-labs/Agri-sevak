Protecting your Green Gram (Moong) crop from wild animals is a significant challenge, especially with increasing wildlife populations in agricultural areas of Haryana. As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend a multi-pronged approach focusing on physical barriers, active deterrence, and community-based strategies, as there are no specific CIBRC-approved chemical repellents widely effective against large wild animals in open fields.

Here are the scientifically verified methods to protect your Green Gram crop from wild animals:

1.  **Physical Barriers:**
    *   **Barbed Wire Fencing:** This is one of the most common and effective methods. A multi-strand barbed wire fence (5-7 strands) around the field can deter animals like Nilgai (Blue Bull) and wild boar to a considerable extent. Ensure the fence is well-maintained and repaired regularly.
    *   **Thorn Fencing:** Utilizing thorny bushes (e.g., *Prosopis juliflora* branches, local thorny shrubs) as a dense fence can also be effective, especially as a low-cost alternative or supplement to barbed wire.
    *   **Trenching:** For areas severely affected by wild boar, digging a deep and wide trench (e.g., 1 meter deep and 1 meter wide) around the field can prevent them from entering. The excavated soil should be piled on the field side to increase the barrier height.
    *   **Electric Fencing (with caution):** While highly effective, electric fences require significant investment, regular maintenance, and strict adherence to safety regulations to prevent harm to humans and non-target animals. Consult with local authorities and experts before considering this option.

2.  **Active Deterrence:**
    *   **Manual Guarding:** Employing human guards, especially during critical periods like pod development and maturity, is a traditional and often effective method. This can be done individually or collectively by farmers.
    *   **Sound Devices:** Using crackers, drums, or gas guns at regular intervals can scare away animals. However, animals can habituate to these sounds over time, so varying the timing and type of sound is crucial.
    *   **Visual Deterrents:** Scarecrows, reflective ribbons, or shiny objects can provide temporary deterrence. Their effectiveness diminishes as animals become accustomed to them.
    *   **Light and Fire:** Using bright lights or small fires (under strict supervision to prevent fire hazards) during the night can deter nocturnal animals like wild boar.

3.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Timely Harvesting:** Harvest your Green Gram crop as soon as it matures to minimize the period of attraction for wild animals.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Keep the field surroundings clean by removing weeds and debris that might provide shelter or alternative food sources for animals.

4.  **Community-Based Approaches:**
    *   **Collective Action:** Encourage farmers in a village or cluster of villages to adopt synchronized planting and harvesting schedules. This reduces the period when crops are available and makes collective guarding more feasible and cost-effective.
    *   **Shared Resources:** Pooling resources for fencing, guarding, or other deterrent measures can significantly reduce the individual burden on farmers.

**Regarding Chemical Repellents:**
It is important to note that there are currently no CIBRC-approved chemical repellents specifically recommended and widely effective for deterring large wild animals (like Nilgai, wild boar, or monkeys) from open agricultural fields in India. Most effective strategies rely on physical barriers and active deterrence.

By implementing a combination of these methods, you can significantly reduce the damage caused by wild animals to your Green Gram crop. For further specific guidance, please consult with the agricultural extension officers at HAU or your local Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK).
