As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Green Gram (Moong bean) in Haryana.

**1. Borers (e.g., Pod Borers like *Helicoverpa armigera*, *Maruca vitrata*) and Caterpillars (e.g., defoliators like *Spodoptera litura*):**
These pests can cause significant damage by feeding on leaves, flowers, and pods. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approaches are recommended, including regular field monitoring, use of pheromone traps, and biological control agents where feasible. For chemical control, when pest populations exceed economic threshold levels, the following CIBRC approved insecticides can be used:

*   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC: 60 ml per acre
*   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG: 80-100 g per acre
*   **Flubendiamide** 20% WG: 50 g per acre
*   **Indoxacarb** 14.5% SC: 200 ml per acre
*   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: 200 ml per acre
*   **Quinalphos** 25% EC: 600 ml per acre

**2. Diamondback moth (*Plutella xylostella*):**
This is not known to affect Green Gram. Diamondback moth is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower, mustard).

**3. Leaf folder:**
Leaf folders can cause damage by folding leaves and feeding from within, affecting photosynthetic activity. When infestation is significant, the following CIBRC approved insecticides can be used:

*   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC: 60 ml per acre
*   **Flubendiamide** 20% WG: 50 g per acre
*   **Indoxacarb** 14.5% SC: 200 ml per acre
*   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: 200 ml per acre
*   **Quinalphos** 25% EC: 600 ml per acre

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the label instructions of the insecticide carefully before use.
*   Ensure proper spray coverage for effective control.
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
*   Consult your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations based on current pest incidence and local conditions.
