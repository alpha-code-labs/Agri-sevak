As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), here are the recommended cultivation practices for Green Gram (Mung bean) in Haryana:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   **Line Sowing:** This is highly recommended for Green Gram. It facilitates inter-cultivation operations like weeding, spraying, and harvesting, leading to better crop management and yield. Broadcasting is not advised.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   **3-5 cm:** Seeds should be sown at a depth of 3 to 5 cm. Sowing too deep can lead to poor emergence, while shallow sowing can expose seeds to bird damage and moisture stress.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   **Row-to-Row:** 30 cm
    *   **Plant-to-Plant:** 10 cm
    *   This spacing allows for optimal light penetration, air circulation, and nutrient uptake, reducing competition among plants.

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   **15-20 kg/acre:** For Kharif (monsoon) season Green Gram.
    *   **20-25 kg/acre:** For Spring/Summer season Green Gram (if cultivated).
    *   Ensure the seeds are treated with recommended fungicides and insecticides before sowing for protection against early-season pests and diseases.
