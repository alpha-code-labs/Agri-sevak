Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist from Haryana Agricultural University (HAU), Hisar, I understand the challenges posed by environmental stresses on your Green Gram (Moong) crop. Protecting your crop from extreme cold, frost, heat (Loo), and intense sunlight is crucial for a good yield. Here is scientifically verified advice:

### 1. Protection from Extreme Cold and Frost

Green Gram is a warm-season crop and is highly susceptible to cold and frost, especially during its early growth and flowering stages.

*   **Optimal Sowing Time:** For spring/summer Green Gram, ensure timely sowing (mid-February to early March) to allow the crop to establish before any potential late winter chills and to complete its reproductive phase before severe summer heat.
*   **Irrigation:** If a frost event is predicted, apply a light irrigation to the field in the evening. The water releases latent heat as it cools, raising the soil temperature and increasing humidity around the plants, which can offer some protection.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure adequate supply of **Potassium (K)**. Potassium plays a vital role in improving the plant's tolerance to cold stress.
*   **Foliar Sprays (for mild cold stress):**
    *   A foliar spray of 0.5% **Urea** (5 g of Urea per litre of water) can provide a quick nutrient boost and help the plants withstand mild cold stress.
    *   A spray of 1% **Potassium Nitrate** (10 g of Potassium Nitrate per litre of water) can also enhance cold tolerance and overall plant vigour.

### 2. Protection from Heat (Loo) and Intense Sunlight

High temperatures, especially when accompanied by hot, dry winds (Loo) and intense sunlight during flowering and pod development, can severely impact Green Gram yield by causing flower drop and poor pod setting.

*   **Optimal Sowing Time:** For spring/summer Green Gram, complete sowing by early March. This ensures that the critical flowering and pod development stages occur before the onset of severe heat in May and June.
*   **Irrigation:** This is the most critical factor. Maintain optimal soil moisture, especially during flowering and pod development. Apply light and frequent irrigations during hot periods to cool the plant canopy and prevent water stress. Avoid waterlogging.
*   **Mulching:** Apply a layer of organic mulch (like crop residues) or use plastic mulch. This helps conserve soil moisture, reduces soil temperature fluctuations, and suppresses weeds.
*   **Foliar Sprays:**
    *   **Kaolin Clay:** Spray a 3-5% solution (30-50 g of Kaolin clay per litre of water) during peak heat periods. Kaolin forms a reflective film on the leaves, reducing leaf temperature and protecting against sun scorch.
    *   **Potassium Nitrate:** Spray a 1-2% solution (10-20 g of Potassium Nitrate per litre of water) at the flowering and pod development stages. This improves water use efficiency and enhances heat tolerance.
    *   **Glycine Betaine:** Spray a 0.5-1% solution (5-10 g of Glycine Betaine per litre of water) during periods of anticipated or ongoing heat stress. It acts as an osmoprotectant, helping plants cope with stress.
    *   **Salicylic Acid:** A foliar spray of 100-200 ppm solution (0.1-0.2 g of Salicylic Acid per litre of water) can induce systemic acquired tolerance in plants, helping them withstand various stresses, including heat.
    *   **Urea:** A 0.5-1% solution (5-10 g of Urea per litre of water) can be sprayed as a foliar feed to maintain plant vigour and nutrient status under stress conditions.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure balanced nutrition, with particular emphasis on **Potassium (K)**, which plays a crucial role in osmoregulation and maintaining turgor under heat stress.
*   **Variety Selection:** Consult HAU recommendations for heat-tolerant Green Gram varieties suitable for spring/summer cultivation in Haryana.

By adopting these practices, you can significantly mitigate the adverse effects of environmental stresses on your Green Gram crop and secure a better harvest.
