Mites, including Red Spider Mite (Tetranychus urticae) and Rust Mite (various species, though *Aceria cajani* is more common in pigeonpea, related mites can affect green gram), can cause significant damage to Green Gram (Moong bean) by sucking sap from leaves, leading to yellowing, bronzing, leaf distortion, and reduced yield. Effective management requires a combination of cultural practices and judicious use of acaricides.

Here's how to control mites in Green Gram:

**1. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Approach:**

*   **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect the underside of leaves for mite presence, webbing (for red spider mites), or bronzing/rusting symptoms.
*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Maintain proper field sanitation and weed control, as many weeds can act as alternate hosts for mites.
    *   Ensure adequate irrigation, as water stress can exacerbate mite infestations.
    *   Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can promote lush growth favored by mites.
*   **Biological Control:** Conserve natural enemies like predatory mites (e.g., *Amblyseius* species), lacewings, and ladybird beetles, which prey on mites. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

**2. Chemical Control (Acaricides):**

When mite populations reach damaging levels, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always ensure thorough coverage, especially on the underside of leaves where mites reside. Rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

Apply any of the following CIBRC approved technical chemicals as a foliar spray:

*   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** Apply at a rate of 0.5 ml per litre of water (approximately 125 ml per acre, using 250-300 litres of water).
*   **Propargite 57% EC:** Apply at a rate of 1.5 ml per litre of water (approximately 375-450 ml per acre, using 250-300 litres of water).
*   **Fenpyroximate 5% SC:** Apply at a rate of 1.0 ml per litre of water (approximately 250-300 ml per acre, using 250-300 litres of water).
*   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP:** Apply at a rate of 2.5 grams per litre of water (approximately 625-750 grams per acre, using 250-300 litres of water). This is particularly effective against rust mites and also helps in managing powdery mildew.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Spray Volume:** Ensure adequate spray volume (typically 250-300 litres per acre) for thorough coverage of the foliage, especially the undersides of leaves.
*   **Timing:** Spray early in the morning or late in the evening to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) while handling and applying chemicals. Follow the instructions and safety precautions mentioned on the product label.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Observe the specified pre-harvest interval for each chemical to ensure the produce is safe for consumption.
