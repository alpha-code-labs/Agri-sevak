As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified seed and soil treatment processes for Green Gram (Moong bean) cultivation in Haryana, to ensure healthy crop establishment and mitigate early pest and disease challenges.

### Recommended Seed Treatment Process for Green Gram

Seed treatment is crucial for protecting germinating seeds and young seedlings from seed-borne and early soil-borne diseases, as well as initial insect pest attacks. It also enhances nutrient availability.

**Order of Application:** Always apply fungicides first, followed by insecticides, and finally bio-agents (bio-fungicides and bio-fertilizers). This sequence prevents harm to the beneficial microbes.

1.  **Fungicidal Treatment (for protection against root rot, collar rot, damping-off):**
    *   Treat seeds with **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 1.5 g/kg seed.
    *   **OR** Treat seeds with **Thiram** 75% WS at 2.5 g/kg seed.
    *   **OR** For broader spectrum, use a combination product of **Carbendazim** 12% + **Mancozeb** 63% WP at 2.5 g/kg seed.

2.  **Insecticidal Treatment (for protection against early sucking pests and some soil insects):**
    *   After fungicidal treatment, apply **Imidacloprid** 600 FS at 5-7 ml/kg seed.
    *   **OR** Apply **Thiamethoxam** 30% FS at 3-4 ml/kg seed.

3.  **Bio-agent Treatment (for nitrogen fixation, phosphorus solubilization, and enhanced disease suppression):**
    *   After fungicidal and insecticidal treatments, apply *Rhizobium* culture specific for pulses at 200-250 g for 10-15 kg of seed.
    *   Concurrently, apply PSB (Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria) culture at 200-250 g for 10-15 kg of seed.
    *   For additional biological disease suppression, apply **Trichoderma viride** (or *Trichoderma harzianum*) culture at 4-5 g/kg seed (or 250 g for 10-15 kg of seed).
    *   Mix the seeds thoroughly with the bio-agents, ensuring an even coating. Dry the treated seeds in shade for 30 minutes before sowing.

### Recommended Soil Treatment Process for Green Gram

Soil treatment targets soil-borne pests and diseases that can affect the crop throughout its growth cycle, and improves soil health.

1.  **For Termite and White Grub Management:**
    *   Apply **Fipronil** 0.3% GR at 10-15 kg/acre at the time of sowing by broadcasting and incorporating into the soil, or by applying in furrows.
    *   **OR** Apply **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 2.0-2.5 L/acre. This can be mixed with 50-100 kg of sand and broadcasted before the last ploughing, or applied as a drench in the root zone.

2.  **For Soil-borne Disease Management (e.g., Root Rot, Wilt):**
    *   Apply **Trichoderma viride** (or *Trichoderma harzianum*) culture at 2.5 kg/acre.
    *   Mix the **Trichoderma** culture with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost. Moisten the mixture and keep it under shade for 7-10 days to allow the fungus to multiply.
    *   Broadcast this enriched FYM/compost mixture evenly over the field and incorporate it into the soil before sowing.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (gloves, mask) while handling chemicals.
*   Read and follow the instructions and safety precautions on the product labels.
*   Integrated Pest and Disease Management (IPDM) approaches, combining cultural practices, resistant varieties, biological control, and judicious chemical use, are always recommended for sustainable agriculture.
*   Ensure proper soil moisture for effective action of both chemical and biological treatments.

This comprehensive approach will provide a strong foundation for a healthy and productive Green Gram crop.
