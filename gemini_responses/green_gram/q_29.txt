Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU), Hisar, I understand your concern regarding flower and pod dropping in Green Gram (Moong bean). This is a common physiological issue that can significantly reduce yield.

Firstly, it's important to clarify that "Tinda" is a type of gourd and is not related to Green Gram. For Green Gram, the correct terms are "flower drop" and "pod drop" (instead of "fruit drop" or "boll dropping").

Flower and pod dropping in Green Gram is primarily a physiological disorder, often exacerbated by environmental stresses, nutrient deficiencies, or hormonal imbalances.

**Causes of Flower and Pod Drop in Green Gram:**

1.  **Environmental Stress:**
    *   **High Temperatures:** Temperatures above 40°C during flowering can lead to pollen sterility and flower abortion.
    *   **Water Stress:** Both drought (lack of moisture) and waterlogging (excess moisture) can cause flowers and young pods to drop.
    *   **Humidity:** Very low or very high humidity can affect pollen viability and fertilization.
2.  **Nutrient Deficiencies:**
    *   **Boron:** Critical for pollen germination, pollen tube growth, and fruit set. Deficiency leads to poor fertilization and flower drop.
    *   **Zinc:** Essential for enzyme activity and hormone production, impacting overall plant vigor and reproductive development.
    *   **Molybdenum:** Important for nitrogen metabolism and nodule function, indirectly affecting plant health.
3.  **Hormonal Imbalance:** An imbalance between auxins (which promote fruit retention) and abscisic acid (which promotes abscission) can lead to dropping.
4.  **Pest and Disease Damage:** While not the primary cause of physiological dropping, severe infestations of flower thrips, pod borers, or certain diseases can also lead to flower and pod damage and subsequent drop.

**Control Measures for Flower and Pod Drop in Green Gram:**

An integrated approach combining good agronomic practices and targeted chemical interventions is most effective.

**A. Agronomic Practices:**

1.  **Optimal Irrigation:**
    *   Ensure adequate soil moisture, especially during the critical flowering and pod development stages. Avoid both water stress and waterlogging.
    *   Light irrigation during flowering can help mitigate high-temperature stress.
2.  **Balanced Nutrition:**
    *   Apply recommended doses of NPK fertilizers.
    *   Ensure proper availability of micronutrients, especially Boron and Zinc, through soil application or foliar sprays.
3.  **Weed Management:** Keep the field free of weeds, as they compete for water, nutrients, and light, adding to plant stress.
4.  **Appropriate Sowing Time:** Sow the crop at the recommended time for your region to avoid extreme temperatures during critical growth stages.
5.  **Pest and Disease Management:** Implement timely control measures for major pests and diseases to prevent indirect damage to flowers and pods.

**B. Chemical Interventions (CIBRC Approved):**

These interventions aim to correct nutrient deficiencies or regulate plant hormones to reduce dropping.

1.  **For Boron Deficiency:**
    *   Foliar spray of **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (e.g., Solubor) at 1-2 g/L of water (0.1-0.2% solution) at the pre-flowering stage.
    *   Alternatively, **Borax** can be used at 2-3 g/L of water.
2.  **Plant Growth Regulator (PGR) for Flower/Pod Retention:**
    *   Foliar spray of **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA)** at a concentration of 10-20 ppm (parts per million) during the flowering stage and again at early pod formation.
        *   *Example for a common 4.5% SL formulation:* Mix 0.2-0.4 ml of **Naphthalene Acetic Acid** (4.5% SL) per liter of water.
3.  **Multi-Micronutrient Sprays:**
    *   If general micronutrient deficiencies are suspected, apply a CIBRC approved multi-micronutrient formulation containing Zinc, Boron, Molybdenum, Iron, Manganese, and Copper.
    *   Dosage will vary by product, typically 2-5 g/L or ml/L of water, applied at pre-flowering and early pod development stages.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read the label of the chemical product carefully for specific instructions, dosage, and safety precautions.
*   Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage during spraying.
*   Apply sprays during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to maximize absorption and minimize phytotoxicity.

By implementing these measures, you can significantly reduce flower and pod dropping and improve the yield of your Green Gram crop.
