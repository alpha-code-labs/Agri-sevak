As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the maturity signs, harvesting time, and cutting process for Green Gram (Moong bean) in Haryana:

### Maturity Signs for Green Gram:

*   **Pod Colour Change:** The most prominent sign is when the pods change colour from green to black or dark brown, indicating physiological maturity.
*   **Pod Drying:** The pods become dry and brittle.
*   **Seed Hardness:** Seeds inside the pods become hard and attain their characteristic colour (typically greenish-yellow to olive green, depending on the variety).
*   **Leaf Senescence:** Leaves start to turn yellow and may begin to shed, though some varieties might retain green leaves even at maturity.
*   **Plant Drying:** The overall plant begins to dry out.
*   **Moisture Content:** For optimal harvesting, the seed moisture content should ideally be around 18-20%.

### Harvesting Time for Green Gram:

*   **Days After Sowing:** Green Gram typically matures in 60-90 days after sowing, depending on the specific variety (early vs. late maturing) and prevailing weather conditions.
*   **Pod Maturity Percentage:** Harvesting should commence when 80-90% of the pods on the plant have matured and dried.
*   **Preventing Shattering:** It is crucial to harvest before the pods become excessively dry and prone to shattering, which can lead to significant yield losses.
*   **Multiple Pickings:** For indeterminate varieties where pods mature at different times, 2-3 pickings may be necessary. The first picking targets the fully mature pods, and subsequent pickings are done as more pods mature. For synchronous maturing varieties, a single harvest is often sufficient.
*   **Weather Conditions:** Harvest during dry weather to prevent spoilage and facilitate drying.

### Cutting Process for Green Gram:

*   **Manual Harvesting:**
    *   For small-scale farming or when multiple pickings are practiced, plants are either pulled out by hand or cut close to the ground using sickles.
    *   If multiple pickings are done, mature pods are hand-picked first, and then the remaining plants are cut once most pods have matured.
*   **Mechanical Harvesting:**
    *   For large areas and synchronous maturing varieties, combine harvesters can be employed.
    *   The combine settings (e.g., cylinder speed, concave clearance, fan speed) must be carefully adjusted to minimize seed damage and shattering.
    *   The cutting height should be set appropriately to ensure maximum recovery of pods.
*   **Post-Harvest Handling:**
    *   After cutting/pulling, the harvested plants or pods are typically spread in a clean, dry area for sun-drying for a few days to further reduce moisture content.
    *   **Threshing:** Once adequately dried, the plants are threshed to separate the seeds from the pods. This can be done manually by beating the dried plants with sticks or mechanically using a thresher.
    *   **Winnowing:** After threshing, the seeds are winnowed to remove chaff, dust, and other light impurities.
    *   **Cleaning and Grading:** Further cleaning and grading may be done to obtain high-quality seeds.
    *   **Final Drying for Storage:** For safe storage, the seed moisture content should be brought down to 10-12% to prevent pest infestation and fungal growth.
