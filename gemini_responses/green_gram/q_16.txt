As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified fertilizer doses for Green Gram (Moong bean) cultivation in Haryana. Green Gram, being a leguminous crop, has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, thus requiring a lower external nitrogen input compared to non-leguminous crops. However, a starter dose of nitrogen, along with adequate phosphorus, potassium, and sulphur, is crucial for optimal growth and yield.

**General Nutrient Recommendation for Green Gram (per acre):**
*   **Nitrogen (N):** 15-20 kg
*   **Phosphorus (P2O5):** 40-50 kg
*   **Potassium (K2O):** 20 kg (Apply based on soil test report, or as a general recommendation if soil test is unavailable)
*   **Sulphur (S):** 10-20 kg

**Recommended Fertilizer Doses:**

**I. Basal Application (at the time of sowing):**

Choose one of the following options for Nitrogen and Phosphorus, and add Potassium and Sulphur as needed.

**Option 1 (DAP-based for N & P):**
*   **Diammonium Phosphate**: 100 kg per acre
    *   *This provides approximately 18 kg N and 46 kg P2O5 per acre, meeting the primary N and P requirements.*
*   **Muriate of Potash**: 34 kg per acre
    *   *Apply if soil test indicates K deficiency, or as a general recommendation. This provides approximately 20 kg K2O.*
*   **Bentonite Sulphur (90%)**: 10-20 kg per acre
    *   *Apply if Sulphur is not adequately supplied by other fertilizers or if soil test indicates deficiency.*
    *   *Alternatively, **Gypsum**: 75-150 kg per acre (provides Sulphur and Calcium).*

**Option 2 (SSP + Urea-based for N & P):**
*   **Single Super Phosphate**: 288 kg per acre
    *   *This provides approximately 46 kg P2O5 and 32 kg S per acre, meeting the P and S requirements.*
*   **Urea**: 39 kg per acre
    *   *This provides approximately 18 kg N per acre.*
*   **Muriate of Potash**: 34 kg per acre
    *   *Apply if soil test indicates K deficiency, or as a general recommendation. This provides approximately 20 kg K2O.*

**II. Foliar Application (as supplements):**

These nano-fertilizers are designed for foliar application to supplement nutrient uptake, especially during critical growth stages. They are not a complete replacement for basal granular fertilizers.

*   **Nano Urea Liquid**:
    *   **First spray:** 2-4 ml per litre of water at 30-35 days after sowing (DAS), during the active vegetative growth stage.
    *   **Second spray:** 2-4 ml per litre of water at the pre-flowering stage (around 45-50 DAS).
*   **Nano DAP Liquid**:
    *   **First spray:** 2-4 ml per litre of water at the pre-flowering stage (around 45-50 DAS).
    *   **Second spray:** 2-4 ml per litre of water at the pod development stage (around 60-65 DAS).

**Regarding NPK Fertilizers:**
NPK refers to mixed fertilizers containing Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium in varying ratios (e.g., 12:32:16, 10:26:26). While these can be used, for Green Gram, it is often more precise to apply the required N, P, K, and S through individual or combination fertilizers like DAP, SSP, Urea, and MOP, as detailed above, to match the specific nutrient needs of the crop and soil. If using a specific NPK grade, the dose should be calculated to meet the recommended N, P2O5, and K2O requirements.

**Important Note:**
These recommendations are general guidelines. For precise fertilizer application, it is always advisable to conduct a soil test. A soil test report will provide accurate information on the nutrient status of your field and help in tailoring the fertilizer dose, leading to optimized nutrient use efficiency and higher yields.
