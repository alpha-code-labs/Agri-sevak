Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I understand your concern regarding viral diseases in Green Gram (Moong bean). It's important to note that direct chemical treatments (viricides) for viral diseases do not exist. Therefore, control strategies focus on prevention, managing the vectors that transmit these viruses, and using resistant varieties.

Let's address the specific conditions you mentioned:

*   **Mungbean Yellow Mosaic Virus (MYMV):** This is the most prevalent and economically significant viral disease in Green Gram in Haryana, causing symptoms like yellow vein clearing, mosaic patterns, leaf curling, and severe stunting. It is transmitted by whiteflies (*Bemisia tabaci*).
*   **Leaf curl, Mosaic, Yellow vein clearing, and Stunt virus:** These are often symptoms associated with MYMV or other less common legume viruses. The control measures for MYMV will largely cover these general viral symptoms.
*   **Stripe virus:** This is not a commonly recognized major viral disease of Green Gram in Haryana.
*   **Tristeza virus:** This is not known to affect Green Gram. It is primarily a disease of citrus.

Here are the scientifically verified control measures for managing viral diseases, particularly Mungbean Yellow Mosaic Virus (MYMV), in Green Gram:

### Integrated Management for Viral Diseases (especially MYMV)

1.  **Use of Resistant/Tolerant Varieties:**
    *   This is the most effective and economical method. Always choose varieties that are resistant or tolerant to MYMV.
    *   Consult HAU for the latest recommended MYMV resistant/tolerant varieties suitable for cultivation in Haryana. Examples of varieties known for some level of MYMV tolerance include MH 421, MH 1142, MH 2-15, SML 668, and PDM 139.

2.  **Vector Control (Whitefly Management):**
    Since whiteflies are the primary vectors for MYMV, controlling their population is crucial.

    *   **Seed Treatment:**
        *   Treat seeds with systemic insecticides before sowing to provide early protection against whiteflies.
            *   **Imidacloprid** 70 WS @ 5-7 g/kg seed.
    *   **Foliar Sprays (when whitefly population is observed):**
        *   Monitor your field regularly for whitefly incidence. If whitefly populations are building up (more than 2-3 whiteflies per leaf), apply appropriate insecticides.
            *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8 SL @ 125 ml/acre (in 200-250 L water).
            *   **Thiamethoxam** 25 WG @ 100 g/acre (in 200-250 L water).
            *   **Acetamiprid** 20 SP @ 80 g/acre (in 200-250 L water).
            *   **Buprofezin** 25 SC @ 500 ml/acre (in 200-250 L water) – effective against nymphs.
            *   **Flonicamid** 50 WG @ 60 g/acre (in 200-250 L water).
        *   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development in whiteflies.

3.  **Cultural Practices:**

    *   **Timely Sowing:** Sow Green Gram at the recommended time for your region (e.g., first fortnight of July for Kharif in Haryana). This helps plants establish and often allows them to escape peak whitefly populations or develop tolerance before severe infection.
    *   **Roguing:** Regularly inspect your field, especially in the early stages of crop growth. Uproot and destroy (bury or burn away from the field) any plants showing symptoms of viral infection (yellowing, curling, stunting) to reduce the source of inoculum.
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep your field and surrounding areas free of weeds, as many weeds can act as alternate hosts for viruses and whiteflies.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid continuous cultivation of Green Gram or other susceptible legume crops in the same field. Rotate with non-host crops like cereals.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy all crop residues after harvest.
    *   **Use of Yellow Sticky Traps:** Install yellow sticky traps (10-12 traps/acre) to monitor whitefly populations. These can also help in mass trapping, especially at field borders.

4.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Ensure balanced fertilization to promote vigorous and healthy plant growth, which can enhance the plant's natural resilience to stress and diseases. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can sometimes favor vector multiplication.

By adopting an integrated approach combining resistant varieties, timely vector control, and good cultural practices, you can effectively manage viral diseases in your Green Gram crop. For specific recommendations on varieties and pest management, always consult with the experts at Haryana Agricultural University.
