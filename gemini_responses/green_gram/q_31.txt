As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide guidance on managing these physical damage issues in Green Gram (Moong bean). These are primarily physiological disorders or symptoms of environmental stress rather than diseases or pests.

Here's how to control them:

### 1. Fruit Bursting (Pod Splitting)

This is a physiological disorder often linked to sudden changes in moisture availability and nutrient imbalances.

*   **Causes:**
    *   **Fluctuating Soil Moisture:** A dry spell followed by heavy rain or irrigation can cause rapid water uptake, leading to internal pressure and pod splitting.
    *   **Nutrient Deficiencies:** Boron and Calcium deficiencies can weaken pod walls.
    *   **Varietal Susceptibility:** Some varieties are more prone to splitting.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Irrigation Management:** Maintain consistent soil moisture, especially during pod development and maturation. Avoid extremes of drought followed by sudden heavy irrigation. Provide light, frequent irrigation if dry conditions persist.
    *   **Nutrient Management:**
        *   Conduct soil testing to identify nutrient deficiencies.
        *   If Boron deficiency is indicated, apply **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate) at 10-15 kg/acre as a soil application before sowing, or a foliar spray of 0.2% **Borax** solution (2 g/L water) during flowering and pod development stages.
        *   If Calcium deficiency is suspected, ensure adequate soil calcium. Foliar application of **Calcium nitrate** at 0.5% (5 g/L water) can be considered during pod development.
    *   **Variety Selection:** Choose varieties known for resistance to pod shattering/splitting.

### 2. Leaf Burning/Melting

These symptoms indicate severe environmental stress or chemical damage.

*   **Causes:**
    *   **High Temperature/Heat Stress:** Prolonged exposure to high temperatures, especially during hot winds (loo), can cause leaf scorching and burning.
    *   **Water Stress (Drought):** Insufficient soil moisture leads to wilting and eventual burning of leaf margins.
    *   **Waterlogging:** Excess water can damage roots, impairing water and nutrient uptake, leading to symptoms resembling drought stress or "melting" due to tissue collapse.
    *   **Nutrient Toxicity/Salinity:** High concentrations of certain nutrients or salts in the soil can cause leaf burn.
    *   **Herbicide Phytotoxicity:** Incorrect herbicide application (dose, timing, drift) can cause severe leaf damage.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Irrigation Management:**
        *   Provide timely and adequate irrigation, especially during critical growth stages (flowering and pod filling).
        *   Ensure good drainage in the field to prevent waterlogging.
    *   **Soil Health:**
        *   Conduct soil testing to check for salinity or nutrient imbalances.
        *   Improve soil organic matter content to enhance water retention and nutrient buffering.
    *   **Herbicide Application:**
        *   Strictly follow recommended doses and application methods for all agrochemicals.
        *   Avoid spraying herbicides during high temperatures or windy conditions to prevent drift and phytotoxicity.
    *   **Variety Selection:** Opt for heat-tolerant and drought-resistant varieties suitable for Haryana's climate.

### 3. Hardness in Fruit (Pods/Seeds)

This refers to the development of hard pods or seeds, which can affect market quality and cooking time.

*   **Causes:**
    *   **Premature Harvesting:** Harvesting pods before they reach physiological maturity can result in underdeveloped, hard seeds.
    *   **Environmental Stress during Pod Filling:** High temperatures and drought stress during the critical pod filling stage can lead to poor seed development and hardness.
    *   **Nutrient Deficiencies:** Imbalances or deficiencies of essential nutrients, particularly Phosphorus and Potassium, can affect seed quality.
    *   **Varietal Characteristics:** Some varieties naturally produce harder seeds.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Optimal Harvesting Time:** Harvest green gram at the correct physiological maturity stage, typically when 80-85% of the pods have matured and dried, but before significant shattering occurs.
    *   **Irrigation Management:** Ensure adequate and consistent moisture availability during the pod development and seed filling stages. Avoid water stress during this period.
    *   **Nutrient Management:**
        *   Based on soil test recommendations, ensure balanced fertilization.
        *   Adequate supply of Phosphorus (e.g., through **Di-ammonium phosphate** or **Single Super Phosphate**) and Potassium (e.g., through **Potassium chloride** / Muriate of Potash) is crucial for proper seed development and quality.
    *   **Variety Selection:** Choose varieties known for good seed quality, tenderness, and desirable cooking characteristics.
