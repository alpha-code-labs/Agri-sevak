As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I advise on the following scientifically verified irrigation management practices for Green Gram (Moong Dal) in Haryana:

Green Gram is a relatively drought-tolerant crop, but timely and judicious irrigation is crucial for maximizing yield, especially during critical growth stages. Over-irrigation, particularly during flowering, can be detrimental.

*   **General Water Requirement:** Green Gram typically requires 2-3 irrigations depending on soil type, rainfall, and prevailing weather conditions in Haryana. The total water requirement ranges from 200-300 mm.

*   **First Irrigation:**
    *   **Timing:** The first irrigation is critical and should generally be applied around **20-25 days after sowing (DAS)**. This coincides with the branching or early vegetative growth stage.
    *   **Purpose:** It helps in proper root development, nutrient uptake, and establishment of a healthy plant stand, especially in areas with insufficient soil moisture at sowing or if there has been no significant rainfall.
    *   **Consideration:** If adequate soil moisture is present from pre-sowing irrigation or recent rainfall, the first irrigation can be delayed slightly.

*   **Second Irrigation (and Subsequent Irrigations):**
    *   **Timing:** The second irrigation is most crucial at the **flowering and early pod development stage**, typically around **40-45 DAS** or approximately 15-20 days after the first irrigation.
    *   **Purpose:** Water stress during flowering and pod formation can severely reduce yield by causing flower drop and poor pod filling. This irrigation ensures optimal conditions for these critical reproductive stages.
    *   **Additional Irrigations:** In prolonged dry spells, especially during the pod filling stage, a third light irrigation might be beneficial around **60-65 DAS**. However, care must be taken to avoid waterlogging.
    *   **Caution:** Avoid irrigation during peak flowering if possible, as it can sometimes lead to flower shedding. However, if the soil is severely dry, a light irrigation is necessary. Always check soil moisture before applying water.

*   **Sprinkler Use:**
    *   **Efficiency:** Sprinkler irrigation is highly recommended for Green Gram cultivation in Haryana, especially in light-textured soils (sandy loam) and areas facing water scarcity. It significantly improves water use efficiency compared to flood irrigation.
    *   **Advantages:**
        *   **Uniform Water Distribution:** Ensures even application of water across the field, leading to uniform crop growth.
        *   **Reduced Water Loss:** Minimizes losses due to deep percolation and surface runoff.
        *   **Controlled Application:** Allows for precise application of water, preventing over-irrigation and waterlogging, which Green Gram is sensitive to.
        *   **Suitable for Undulating Terrain:** Can be effectively used on uneven land where flood irrigation is difficult.
    *   **Application:** When using sprinklers, apply lighter and more frequent irrigations rather than heavy, infrequent ones. This maintains optimal soil moisture without causing stress.
    *   **Fertigation:** Sprinkler systems can also be used for fertigation (applying water-soluble fertilizers along with irrigation water), enhancing nutrient use efficiency.

**Key Takeaway:** The goal is to maintain adequate soil moisture, particularly during flowering and pod development, while strictly avoiding waterlogging at any stage. Regular monitoring of soil moisture and weather conditions is essential for effective irrigation scheduling.
