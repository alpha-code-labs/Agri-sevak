Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding Scale insects and Mealybugs in Green Gram (Moong bean). Both these sap-sucking pests can cause significant damage if not managed effectively. They extract plant sap, leading to yellowing, wilting, stunted growth, and reduced yield. They also excrete honeydew, which promotes the growth of sooty mold, further hindering photosynthesis.

Here's a scientifically verified approach for their control:

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategy:**

1.  **Regular Monitoring:**
    *   Regularly inspect your Green Gram fields, especially the undersides of leaves, stems, and growing points, for the presence of these pests. Early detection is crucial for effective management.

2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the field free of weeds, as many weeds can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
    *   **Proper Spacing:** Maintain optimal plant spacing to ensure good air circulation, which can reduce pest build-up.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure balanced fertilization. Over-application of nitrogen can sometimes make plants more susceptible to sucking pests.
    *   **Removal of Infested Plants/Parts:** In cases of localized infestation, carefully remove and destroy heavily infested plant parts or individual plants to prevent further spread.

3.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Conserve natural enemies such as ladybird beetles, lacewings, and parasitic wasps (e.g., *Anagyrus* spp. for mealybugs). Avoid indiscriminate use of broad-spectrum insecticides that can harm these beneficial insects.

4.  **Chemical Control (If infestation is severe and crosses economic threshold levels):**
    When cultural and biological methods are insufficient, and the pest population is high, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always use CIBRC approved chemicals and follow recommended dosages. Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and stems where these pests often reside.

    **Recommended Insecticides for Scale Insects and Mealybugs in Green Gram:**

    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at 125-150 ml per acre.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at 50-100 g per acre.
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply at 50-100 g per acre.
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at 500-600 ml per acre. This is an Insect Growth Regulator (IGR) and is particularly effective against nymphs of scales and mealybugs.
    *   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:** Apply at 200-250 ml per acre.
    *   **Dimethoate 30% EC:** Apply at 300-400 ml per acre.

    **Important Considerations for Chemical Application:**
    *   **Spray Volume:** Use sufficient water (typically 200-300 litres per acre) to ensure thorough coverage of the plant canopy.
    *   **Timing:** Spray during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
    *   **Safety:** Always wear protective clothing (gloves, mask, goggles) while handling and spraying pesticides. Read the label carefully for specific instructions and pre-harvest intervals.
    *   **Rotation:** Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.

By adopting these integrated approaches, you can effectively manage Scale insects and Mealybugs in your Green Gram crop and ensure a healthy yield. For any further clarification, please contact your nearest Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or HAU extension specialist.
