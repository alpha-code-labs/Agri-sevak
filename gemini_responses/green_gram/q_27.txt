As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the suitable climate, soil type, and drainage requirements for Green Gram (Moong Dal) in Haryana:

**Climate:**
Green Gram is a warm-season legume crop that thrives in tropical and subtropical climates.
*   **Temperature:** It requires a warm and dry climate. The optimum temperature range for its growth and development is generally between 25°C and 35°C. High temperatures during flowering can sometimes lead to flower drop, but it is relatively heat-tolerant. It is highly sensitive to frost.
*   **Rainfall:** While it can be grown in areas receiving 600-900 mm of well-distributed rainfall during the growing season (Kharif), in Haryana, it is often cultivated as a summer (Zaid) or spring crop with irrigation, or as a monsoon (Kharif) crop. Excessive rainfall or prolonged cloudy weather, especially during flowering and pod development, can be detrimental.
*   **Sunshine:** Abundant sunshine is crucial for healthy growth, photosynthesis, and good pod formation.

**Soil Type:**
Green Gram can adapt to a wide range of soil types, but for optimal yield, specific conditions are preferred.
*   **Texture:** Well-drained loamy to sandy-loam soils are considered ideal. These soils provide a good balance of water retention and aeration.
*   **pH:** A soil pH range of 6.0 to 7.5 (slightly acidic to neutral) is most suitable.
*   **Organic Matter:** Soils rich in organic matter are beneficial as they improve soil structure, water holding capacity, and nutrient availability.
*   **Avoid:** Heavy clayey soils, highly saline, or alkaline soils are generally not suitable as they impede root development and nutrient uptake.

**Drainage Requirement:**
Green Gram is highly sensitive to waterlogging, making good drainage a critical factor for its successful cultivation.
*   **Waterlogging:** The crop cannot tolerate standing water, even for short durations. Waterlogging leads to poor aeration in the root zone, causing root rot, nutrient deficiencies, and ultimately significant yield losses or crop failure.
*   **Field Preparation:** Fields should be well-leveled to prevent water accumulation in depressions. Proper land preparation, including deep ploughing and harrowing, helps improve soil structure and drainage.
*   **Soil Structure:** Soils with good internal drainage are essential. If the soil has a tendency to become waterlogged, improving its structure through the incorporation of organic matter (e.g., farmyard manure, compost) can enhance drainage.
*   **Irrigation Management:** In irrigated conditions, care must be taken to apply water judiciously, avoiding over-irrigation to prevent temporary waterlogging.
