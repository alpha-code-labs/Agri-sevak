Addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium) in Green Gram (Moong bean) is crucial for optimal growth and yield. It is always recommended to conduct a soil test to determine the precise nutrient status of your field before applying fertilizers.

Here's how to address these deficiencies:

### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

Green Gram is a legume and can fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. Therefore, its external nitrogen requirement is relatively low, primarily for early establishment before effective nodulation.

*   **Symptoms:** General yellowing of older leaves, stunted growth, reduced vigor.
*   **Addressing:**
    *   **Basal Application (Starter Dose):** To support early plant growth before nitrogen fixation becomes fully active.
        *   Apply 15-20 kg Nitrogen per acre at the time of sowing. This can be achieved by applying approximately 33-44 kg **Urea** per acre.
    *   **Foliar Application (if deficiency persists or nodulation is poor):**
        *   If symptoms appear despite good nodulation, or if nodulation is poor, spray a 2% **Urea** solution (20 g **Urea** per litre of water) at 30-45 days after sowing. Use 200-250 litres of water per acre. Repeat if necessary after 10-15 days.
    *   **Important:** Ensure proper seed inoculation with recommended Rhizobium strains to maximize biological nitrogen fixation.

### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

Phosphorus is vital for root development, energy transfer, flowering, and pod formation.

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, dark green or purplish discoloration of older leaves, delayed maturity, poor flowering and pod set.
*   **Addressing:**
    *   **Basal Application:** Phosphorus is best applied at sowing as it is less mobile in the soil.
        *   Apply 40-60 kg P2O5 per acre. This can be achieved by applying:
            *   250-375 kg **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** per acre.
            *   Or 87-130 kg **Di-Ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** per acre.
        *   Drill the fertilizer 5-7 cm below the seed at the time of sowing for better availability.
    *   **Foliar Application (for immediate correction or supplementary boost):**
        *   Spray a 0.5-1% **Monoammonium Phosphate (MAP)** solution (5-10 g **Monoammonium Phosphate** per litre of water) or a 0.5% **Di-Ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** solution (5 g **Di-Ammonium Phosphate** per litre of water) at the pre-flowering or early flowering stage. Use 200-250 litres of water per acre.

### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency

Potassium plays a crucial role in water regulation, nutrient transport, enzyme activation, disease resistance, and overall plant vigor, including pod filling.

*   **Symptoms:** Yellowing and scorching/browning of leaf margins (starting from older leaves), weak stems, poor pod development, reduced seed size.
*   **Addressing:**
    *   **Basal Application:**
        *   Apply 20-30 kg K2O per acre at the time of sowing. This can be achieved by applying:
            *   33-50 kg **Muriate of Potash (Potassium Chloride)** per acre.
            *   Or 40-60 kg **Sulphate of Potash (Potassium Sulphate)** per acre.
    *   **Foliar Application (for immediate correction):**
        *   Spray a 1% **Muriate of Potash (Potassium Chloride)** solution (10 g **Muriate of Potash** per litre of water) or a 1% **Sulphate of Potash (Potassium Sulphate)** solution (10 g **Sulphate of Potash** per litre of water) at the pre-flowering or pod development stage. Use 200-250 litres of water per acre.

**General Recommendations:**

*   **Soil Testing:** Always prioritize soil testing to get precise recommendations for your specific field conditions.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management:** Combine chemical fertilizers with organic manures (e.g., Farm Yard Manure, compost) to improve soil health and nutrient availability.
*   **Water Management:** Ensure adequate and timely irrigation, as water stress can hinder nutrient uptake and exacerbate deficiency symptoms.
