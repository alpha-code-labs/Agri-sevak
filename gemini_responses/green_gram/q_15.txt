As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the specified pests in Green Gram (Moong bean) in Haryana:

### Control Measures for Pests in Green Gram

**1. Grasshopper**
Grasshoppers can cause significant defoliation in Green Gram. Integrated pest management strategies should be employed, including cultural practices like field sanitation and deep ploughing to expose eggs. For chemical control, consider the following CIBRC approved insecticides:

*   **Malathion** 50% EC: Apply 1.25 L per acre in 250-300 L of water.
*   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: Apply 100 ml per acre in 200-250 L of water.

Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage during application, preferably in the morning or late afternoon.

**2. Painted Bug (Bagrada hilaris)**
Painted bugs are sucking pests that can affect Green Gram, especially during early growth stages. They feed on sap, leading to wilting and reduced plant vigour.

*   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: Apply 50-70 ml per acre in 200-250 L of water.
*   **Dimethoate** 30% EC: Apply 250 ml per acre in 200-250 L of water.

Apply these insecticides when pest incidence reaches economic threshold levels, ensuring good coverage, particularly on the undersides of leaves.

**3. Red Cotton Bug**
This is not known to affect Green Gram as a significant pest. Its primary host is cotton and other malvaceous plants.

**4. Black Ants**
This is not known to affect Green Gram as a direct pest. Black ants are generally scavengers or tend to other sucking pests (like aphids or mealybugs) for honeydew. If ants are observed, it is advisable to check for the presence of other primary sucking pests.

**General Recommendations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the insecticide label carefully.
*   Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Calibrate spray equipment to ensure correct dosage and uniform coverage.
*   Observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) specified for each chemical to ensure food safety.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension officers for specific recommendations based on current pest pressure and local conditions.
