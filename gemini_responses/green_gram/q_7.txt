As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I must provide scientifically verified advice specific to Green Gram (Moong bean) in Haryana.

*   **Dieback:** This is not known to affect Green Gram.
*   **Twig blight:** This is not known to affect Green Gram.
*   **Tikka disease:** This is not known to affect Green Gram. Tikka disease is a common disease of groundnut (peanut), not Green Gram. Green Gram can be affected by Cercospora leaf spot, which is a different disease.
