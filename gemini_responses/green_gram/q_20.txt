As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified approaches to address micro-nutrient deficiencies in Green Gram (Moong bean) in Haryana. It is crucial to conduct a soil test to accurately diagnose specific deficiencies before applying any micronutrients.

**General Recommendations:**

*   **Soil Testing:** Always begin with a comprehensive soil test to identify specific micronutrient deficiencies and their severity. This helps in precise application and avoids over-application, which can be detrimental.
*   **Foliar Application:** For quick correction of deficiencies, especially during critical growth stages, foliar sprays are generally more effective than soil application for most micronutrients.
*   **Timing:** Apply micronutrients at critical growth stages such as vegetative growth, pre-flowering, and pod development for optimal results.

Here's how to address specific micronutrient deficiencies:

### 1. Zinc (Zn)

*   **Deficiency Symptoms:** Stunted growth, interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, bronzing of older leaves, small leaves (little leaf).
*   **Recommendations:**
    *   **Soil Application (if severe deficiency identified by soil test):** Apply 20-25 kg/acre of **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (21% Zn) or 10-12.5 kg/acre of **Zinc sulphate monohydrate** (33% Zn) at the time of sowing.
    *   **Foliar Spray (for quick correction):** Spray a 0.5% solution of **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (5 g/L water) or a 0.1% solution of **Zinc EDTA** (1 g/L water). Apply two sprays: one at the pre-flowering stage and another 10-15 days later.

### 2. Iron (Fe) / Ferrous

*   **Deficiency Symptoms:** Severe interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, eventually turning almost white. Common in calcareous and high pH soils.
*   **Recommendations:**
    *   **Foliar Spray (most effective):** Spray a 0.5-1% solution of **Ferrous sulphate heptahydrate** (5-10 g/L water) or a 0.1% solution of **Ferrous EDTA** (1 g/L water). Repeat 2-3 times at 7-10 day intervals until symptoms disappear. Soil application is generally not recommended due to rapid fixation in alkaline soils.

### 3. Boron (B)

*   **Deficiency Symptoms:** Stunted growth, death of growing points (terminal buds), malformed or brittle young leaves, poor pod set, hollow stems.
*   **Recommendations:**
    *   **Soil Application (if severe deficiency identified by soil test):** Apply 4-6 kg/acre of **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate, 10.5% B) or 2-3 kg/acre of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (Solubor, 20% B) at the time of sowing. *Caution: Boron can be toxic if over-applied; adhere strictly to recommended rates.*
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Spray a 0.1-0.2% solution of **Borax** (1-2 g/L water) or **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (1-2 g/L water) at the pre-flowering stage.

### 4. Calcium (Ca)

*   **Deficiency Symptoms:** Stunted growth, death of terminal buds, young leaves distorted or hooked, poor root development.
*   **Recommendations:**
    *   **Soil Application:** If soil pH is low, liming with **Calcium carbonate** can address Ca deficiency. In sodic soils common in Haryana, application of **Gypsum** (Calcium sulphate) at recommended rates (as per soil test) can supply calcium and improve soil structure.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Spray a 0.5-1% solution of **Calcium nitrate** (5-10 g/L water) or **Calcium chloride** (5-10 g/L water). Apply during flowering and pod development stages.

### 5. Magnesium (Mg)

*   **Deficiency Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, starting from leaf margins and progressing inwards, leaves may become brittle.
*   **Recommendations:**
    *   **Soil Application (if severe deficiency identified by soil test):** Apply 10-20 kg/acre of **Magnesium sulphate** (Epsom salt, 9.6% Mg) at the time of sowing.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Spray a 0.5-1% solution of **Magnesium sulphate** (5-10 g/L water). Apply 1-2 times during vegetative growth and pre-flowering.

### 6. Manganese (Mn)

*   **Deficiency Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, similar to iron but often with small necrotic spots, leaves may appear mottled.
*   **Recommendations:**
    *   **Soil Application (if severe deficiency identified by soil test):** Apply 10-15 kg/acre of **Manganese sulphate** (28-30% Mn) at the time of sowing, especially in high pH soils.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Spray a 0.25-0.5% solution of **Manganese sulphate** (2.5-5 g/L water). Apply 1-2 times during vegetative growth and pre-flowering.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always use clean water for preparing spray solutions.
*   Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage during spraying.
*   Do not mix different micronutrient solutions or with other pesticides without checking their compatibility.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for specific guidance tailored to your field conditions.
