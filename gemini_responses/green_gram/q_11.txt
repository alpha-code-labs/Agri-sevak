Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies in Green Gram (Moong Dal) in Haryana.

### Control of Beetles and Weevils in Green Gram

Beetles (such as flea beetles, blister beetles, and some leaf beetles) and weevils (like stem weevils) can cause significant damage to Green Gram by defoliating plants, feeding on flowers, or boring into stems and pods. Effective control measures are crucial for protecting your crop.

For the control of beetles and weevils, consider the following CIBRC approved insecticides:

*   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC**: Apply at a rate of **200-250 ml per acre** mixed in 200-250 litres of water. This is effective against various chewing pests including beetles.
*   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC**: Apply at a rate of **60 ml per acre** mixed in 200-250 litres of water. This provides broad-spectrum control against many chewing insects.
*   **Quinalphos 25% EC**: Apply at a rate of **600 ml per acre** mixed in 200-250 litres of water. This is a broad-spectrum insecticide effective against a range of insect pests.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always ensure thorough coverage of the plant foliage during spraying.
*   Follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions mentioned on the product label.
*   Observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) for each chemical to ensure the safety of the produce.

### Control of Sawflies in Green Gram

This is not known to affect Green Gram. Sawflies are generally not considered a significant pest of Green Gram in Haryana or other parts of India.
