As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm that Black smut, False smut, Kernel smut, and Loose smut are primarily diseases of cereal crops (like rice, wheat, maize, sorghum, pearl millet) and are **not known to affect Green Gram (Vigna radiata)**.

Green Gram is susceptible to other fungal and viral diseases such as powdery mildew, Cercospora leaf spot, anthracnose, rust, damping-off, root rot, and Mungbean Yellow Mosaic Virus (MYMV), but not the specific smut diseases you have mentioned.
