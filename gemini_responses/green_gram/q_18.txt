As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding Growth Regulators/Hormones for Green Gram in Haryana:

1.  **Ethrel (Ethephon):**
    *   While **Ethephon** is a plant growth regulator, its application for general growth regulation or yield enhancement in Green Gram is not a standard, widely recommended practice by agricultural universities in Haryana. Its use can be complex and may lead to adverse effects like flower drop or reduced yield if not applied precisely for a specific, well-researched purpose and dose. Therefore, a general recommendation for its use in Green Gram is not provided.

2.  **2,4-D:**
    *   **2,4-D** is a selective herbicide primarily used to control broadleaf weeds. Green Gram is a broadleaf crop. Applying **2,4-D** to Green Gram will cause severe phytotoxicity and kill the crop. Therefore, **2,4-D** is not recommended as a growth regulator for Green Gram.

3.  **Boron:**
    *   **Boron** is an essential micronutrient crucial for various physiological processes in Green Gram, including flowering, pollen viability, fertilization, pod setting, and seed development. Its deficiency can significantly impact yield.
    *   **Recommended Dose:**
        *   **Foliar Spray:** Apply **Disodium tetraborate decahydrate** (Borax) at a concentration of 0.2% (2 grams per litre of water).
        *   **Timing:** Spray at the pre-flowering or early flowering stage.
        *   **Method:** Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.
