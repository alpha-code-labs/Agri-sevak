As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following doses of organic manures and bio-stimulants for Green Gram cultivation in Haryana:

*   **Farm Yard Manure (FYM):**
    *   Apply 5-10 tonnes per acre.
    *   It should be incorporated into the soil during land preparation, approximately 2-3 weeks before sowing, to allow for proper decomposition and nutrient release.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   Apply 2-4 tonnes per acre.
    *   Vermicompost can be applied during land preparation or at the time of sowing, mixed well with the soil. It is a richer source of nutrients compared to FYM.

*   **Sagarika:**
    *   It is important to note that Sagarika (a seaweed extract-based product) is a bio-stimulant, not a bulk organic manure like FYM or Vermicompost. It enhances nutrient uptake, promotes root development, and improves overall plant vigour.
    *   **Foliar Spray:**
        *   Mix 2.5-5 ml of Sagarika per litre of water.
        *   Typically, 2-3 sprays are recommended:
            *   First spray: 20-25 days after sowing (vegetative stage).
            *   Second spray: At the pre-flowering/flowering stage.
            *   Third spray (optional): At the pod development stage.
    *   **Soil Application (Drench/Fertigation):**
        *   1-2 litres per acre, mixed with irrigation water or applied as a drench, especially during early growth stages.
