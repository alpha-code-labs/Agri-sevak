As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm the following regarding your query:

*   **Fruit fly:** This is not known to affect Green Gram as a significant pest. Fruit flies primarily infest fleshy fruits like cucurbits, mango, guava, etc. The primary pod-damaging pests in Green Gram are usually pod borers.
*   **Ber fly (*Carpomyia vesuviana*):** This is not known to affect Green Gram. The Ber fly is a highly specific pest of Ber (*Ziziphus mauritiana*) fruits and does not infest Green Gram.
