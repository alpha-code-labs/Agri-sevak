Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist from Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding soil pests in Green Gram (Moong bean). Termites and Root-knot nematodes are significant threats that can severely impact yield. Here is scientifically verified advice for their control:

### 1. Control of Termites (Deemak) in Green Gram

Termites can cause significant damage by feeding on roots and stems, leading to wilting and plant death.

**A. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   **Deep Summer Ploughing:** Exposes termites to sunlight and predators, disrupting their colonies.
*   **Removal of Crop Residues:** Clear fields of stubble and woody debris that can serve as food sources for termites.
*   **Destruction of Termite Mounds:** Locate and destroy termite mounds in and around the field.

**B. Chemical Control (Pre-sowing/At Sowing):**
For effective control, soil application of insecticides is recommended before or at the time of sowing.
*   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Mix 2.5 Litres of **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** with 50-100 kg of sand or dry soil and broadcast evenly over one acre. Incorporate it into the soil before sowing.
    *   **Drenching (if infestation is observed later):** Mix 4 ml of **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** per Litre of water and drench around the base of affected plants.
*   **Fipronil 0.3% GR:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 10-15 kg of **Fipronil 0.3% GR** per acre at the time of sowing by broadcasting or in furrows.

### 2. Control of Nematodes (Root-knot Nematodes - Gaath Kripmi) in Green Gram

Root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.) cause characteristic galls or knots on roots, leading to stunted growth, yellowing, and reduced nutrient uptake.

**A. Cultural Control:**
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice rotation with non-host crops like cereals (e.g., wheat, maize, sorghum) for at least 2-3 years. Avoid continuous cultivation of susceptible crops.
*   **Summer Ploughing:** Deep ploughing during hot summer months exposes nematode eggs and larvae to desiccating heat and sunlight, reducing their population.
*   **Use of Resistant Varieties:** If available and suitable for your region, choose Green Gram varieties known for nematode resistance.
*   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporate well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost into the soil.
    *   **Neem Cake:** Apply 200-400 kg of **Neem Cake** per acre and incorporate it into the soil 2-3 weeks before sowing. Neem cake releases compounds that are toxic to nematodes and also promotes beneficial soil microbes.

**B. Biological Control:**
*   **Purpureocillium lilacinum (formerly Paecilomyces lilacinus):**
    *   **Soil Application:** Mix 2.5 kg of **Purpureocillium lilacinum** (bio-nematicide formulation) with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed FYM or compost. Apply this mixture per acre and incorporate it into the soil before sowing.

**C. Chemical Control (Use only if severe infestation and cultural/biological methods are insufficient):**
*   **Fluensulfone 2% GR:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 10-15 kg of **Fluensulfone 2% GR** per acre by broadcasting and incorporating it into the soil before sowing or at the time of sowing. This is a modern nematicide with good efficacy.
*   **Carbosulfan 25% EC/SE:**
    *   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds with **Carbosulfan 25% EC/SE** at the rate of 20-30 ml per kg of seed before sowing. This provides early protection.
    *   **Soil Drenching (if needed post-emergence):** Mix 1 Litre of **Carbosulfan 25% EC/SE** in 200-400 Litres of water and drench around the root zone of plants in one acre.

**Important General Advice:**
*   Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the product label for dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) while handling any chemical.
*   Consult your local agricultural extension officer or KVK scientist for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and the latest approved practices.
*   Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods, is the most sustainable and effective strategy for long-term pest control.

I hope this advice helps you in managing soil pests effectively in your Green Gram crop.
Jai Kisan!
