As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for managing growth issues in Green Gram (Moong bean) in Haryana:

### 1. Slow Growth

Slow growth in Green Gram is often indicative of nutrient deficiencies, water stress, or poor soil health.

*   **Soil Testing:** Conduct a comprehensive soil test to identify specific nutrient deficiencies and soil pH. This is the most crucial first step.
*   **Nutrient Management (General Recommendations, adjust based on soil test):**
    *   **Basal Application:** At sowing, apply 15-20 kg Nitrogen (N), 40-60 kg Phosphorus (P2O5), and 20 kg Potassium (K2O) per acre.
    *   **Zinc Deficiency:** If soil test indicates deficiency, apply 25 kg **Zinc Sulphate heptahydrate** per acre as basal. Alternatively, a foliar spray of 0.5% **Zinc Sulphate heptahydrate** (5 g/L water) can be given at 30-40 days after sowing (DAS).
    *   **Sulphur Deficiency:** Apply 20 kg **Sulphur** (elemental) per acre at sowing, especially in light-textured soils.
*   **Water Management:** Ensure adequate and timely irrigation, especially during critical growth stages. Avoid both water stress and waterlogging.
*   **Soil Health:** Incorporate 5-10 tonnes of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost per acre during field preparation to improve soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability.

### 2. Yellow Growth (Chlorosis)

Yellowing of Green Gram leaves (chlorosis) is primarily caused by nutrient deficiencies, waterlogging, or sometimes viral diseases.

*   **Identify Specific Deficiency:** Observe the pattern of yellowing (e.g., general yellowing of older leaves for Nitrogen, interveinal yellowing of younger leaves for Iron or Manganese).
*   **Iron Deficiency:** Common in alkaline and calcareous soils of Haryana. Spray 0.5% **Ferrous Sulphate heptahydrate** (5 g/L water) 2-3 times at weekly intervals on young, affected leaves.
*   **Zinc Deficiency:** Spray 0.5% **Zinc Sulphate heptahydrate** (5 g/L water) at 30-40 DAS.
*   **Nitrogen Deficiency:** While Green Gram fixes its own nitrogen, severe deficiency can occur if nodulation is poor. A light foliar spray of 1% Urea (10 g/L water) can be given, but use sparingly to avoid inhibiting nodulation.
*   **Sulphur Deficiency:** If deficiency appears later in the season, a foliar spray of 0.2% **Potassium Sulphate** (2 g/L water) can be applied.
*   **Waterlogging:** Ensure proper field drainage. If waterlogging is temporary, plants may recover once excess water recedes.

### 3. Excessive Height

Excessive height can lead to lodging (falling over) and reduced yield.

*   **Optimal Plant Density:** Maintain recommended spacing (e.g., 30 cm row-to-row and 10 cm plant-to-plant) to prevent competition for light, which can cause plants to stretch.
*   **Nitrogen Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen application, especially after the initial starter dose, as Green Gram is a legume and fixes atmospheric nitrogen. High nitrogen promotes vegetative growth over reproductive growth.
*   **Variety Selection:** Choose semi-dwarf or lodging-resistant varieties suitable for cultivation in Haryana.
*   **Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs):**
    *   To reduce excessive vegetative growth and promote branching and reproductive growth, apply **Chlormequat chloride** 50% SL at 200-300 ml per acre (diluted in 200-300 L water) at the pre-flowering stage (around 30-35 DAS).

### 4. Excessive Flowering

Excessive flowering is generally a desirable trait in Green Gram, indicating good yield potential. However, if it is accompanied by poor pod set or significant flower drop, the issue lies in flower retention and pod development rather than the number of flowers itself.

*   **Boron Deficiency:** Boron is critical for pollen viability, fertilization, and pod setting. If deficiency is suspected or common in your area, spray 0.1% **Borax** (1 g/L water) or **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (0.5 g/L water) at the pre-flowering and early pod development stages.
*   **Potassium Management:** Ensure adequate potassium supply (20 kg K2O/acre basal) as it plays a vital role in flower and pod development and overall plant stress tolerance.
*   **Water Management:** Maintain consistent soil moisture during the flowering and pod development stages. Water stress during these periods can lead to flower abortion and poor pod filling.
*   **Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs):**
    *   To prevent flower drop and improve pod retention, spray **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA)** 4.5% SL at 20-30 ml per acre (diluted in 200-300 L water) at the peak flowering stage. This helps in reducing abscission of flowers and young pods.
