As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling sucking pests in Green Gram (Moong bean) in Haryana.

**Regarding Psylla:**
This is not known to affect Green Gram. Psylla (psyllids) are generally not considered a significant pest of Green Gram.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Sucking Pests (Aphids, Leafhopper, Whitefly, Thrips):**

Effective management of sucking pests in Green Gram requires an integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods.

1.  **Monitoring and Early Detection:**
    *   Regularly scout fields, especially the undersides of leaves and tender shoots, to detect pest incidence early.
    *   Use yellow sticky traps (10-12 traps/acre) to monitor whitefly and leafhopper populations.

2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available and suitable for your region, choose Green Gram varieties known to have tolerance or resistance to major sucking pests or associated viral diseases (e.g., Yellow Mosaic Virus transmitted by whiteflies).
    *   **Timely Sowing:** Sow Green Gram at the recommended time to avoid peak pest periods.
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep fields free of weeds, as many weeds can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
    *   **Balanced Fertilization:** Avoid excessive nitrogenous fertilizers, which can lead to lush growth, making plants more attractive to sucking pests.

3.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Conserve natural enemies such as ladybird beetles, lacewings, hoverflies, and parasitic wasps (e.g., *Encarsia formosa* for whiteflies), which prey on or parasitize aphids, whiteflies, and other sucking pests. Avoid indiscriminate use of broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

4.  **Mechanical Control:**
    *   For small infestations, especially in early stages, physically remove and destroy heavily infested leaves or plants.
    *   Yellow sticky traps can also help in mass trapping of whiteflies and leafhoppers, reducing their population.

**Chemical Control (When pest population crosses Economic Threshold Level - ETL):**

When pest populations are high and causing significant damage, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always use CIBRC approved technical chemical names and follow recommended dosages. Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves. Use 200-250 litres of water per acre for effective spraying.

*   **For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips:**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** 125 ml/acre
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** 50 g/acre
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** 100 g/acre
    *   **Dimethoate 30% EC:** 330 ml/acre

*   **Specifically for Whiteflies and Thrips (with different mode of action for resistance management):**
    *   **Diafenthiuron 50% WP:** 250 g/acre

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Rotate Insecticides:** To prevent the development of insecticide resistance, rotate insecticides with different modes of action.
*   **Safety Precautions:** Always wear protective clothing (gloves, mask, goggles) while handling and spraying pesticides. Follow the instructions on the product label carefully, including pre-harvest intervals (PHI).
*   **Consult Local Experts:** For specific recommendations tailored to your local conditions and current pest outbreaks, always consult with agricultural extension officers or scientists at HAU, Hisar.
