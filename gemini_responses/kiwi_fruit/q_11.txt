As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in Kiwi Fruit in Haryana.

### Control of Beetles and Weevils in Kiwi Fruit

Beetles and Weevils, particularly root weevils (e.g., *Otiorhynchus* species) and Fuller rose beetle (*Pantomorus cervinus*), can affect Kiwi Fruit by damaging roots, leaves, and sometimes fruit. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is recommended, combining cultural, mechanical, and chemical methods.

**Cultural and Mechanical Methods:**
*   **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect plants, especially young ones, for signs of feeding damage (notches on leaves, wilting, or defoliation).
*   **Sanitation:** Remove plant debris and weeds around the plants where pests might shelter or overwinter.
*   **Hand-picking:** For small infestations, adult beetles and weevils can be hand-picked, especially at night when many weevils are active, and dropped into soapy water.
*   **Barriers:** Apply sticky barriers or bands around the trunks of young plants to prevent flightless weevils from climbing up to feed on foliage.
*   **Soil management:** Maintain good soil health and moisture to promote strong root growth, making plants more resilient to root damage.

**Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved Technical Chemicals):**
For significant infestations, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always follow label instructions for dosage, timing, and pre-harvest intervals (PHI).

*   **For Root Weevil Larvae (Soil Application):**
    *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: Apply as a soil drench at 2.5 - 3.0 ml/L of water, targeting the root zone. This is effective against larvae feeding on roots.
    *   **Fipronil** 5% SC: Apply as a soil drench at 1.5 - 2.0 ml/L of water, targeting the root zone.

*   **For Adult Beetles and Weevils (Foliar Application):**
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: Spray at 0.5 - 1.0 ml/L of water. This provides quick knockdown and residual action against adults feeding on foliage.
    *   **Cypermethrin** 25% EC: Spray at 0.5 - 0.75 ml/L of water. Effective against a broad range of chewing pests.
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: Spray at 0.5 - 0.75 ml/L of water. While primarily for sucking pests, it can have systemic action against some chewing insects, especially if they feed on treated foliage.

### Control of Sawflies in Kiwi Fruit

This is not known to affect Kiwi Fruit. Sawflies are generally not considered pests of Kiwi Fruit (*Actinidia deliciosa* or *Actinidia chinensis*).
