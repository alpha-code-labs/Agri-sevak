As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling physical damage in Kiwi Fruit, keeping in mind the specific conditions and resources relevant to Haryana.

### Control of Physical Damage in Kiwi Fruit

**1. Fruit Bursting (Cracking)**

Fruit bursting is primarily a physiological disorder caused by rapid changes in water availability, leading to internal pressure exceeding the skin's elasticity.

*   **Causes:**
    *   Irregular water supply (e.g., heavy irrigation after a dry spell).
    *   Sudden temperature fluctuations.
    *   Nutrient imbalances, particularly calcium deficiency.
    *   Varietal susceptibility.

*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Consistent Irrigation:** Maintain uniform soil moisture throughout the fruit development period. Use drip irrigation to deliver water precisely and consistently, avoiding sudden large fluctuations.
    *   **Mulching:** Apply organic mulch (e.g., straw, crop residues) around the base of the plants to conserve soil moisture, moderate soil temperature, and reduce evaporation.
    *   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure adequate and balanced nutrient supply. Calcium plays a crucial role in cell wall integrity.
        *   Foliar application of **Calcium nitrate** at 0.5% (5 g/L) or **Calcium chloride** at 0.3% (3 g/L) can be done during fruit development, typically 2-3 applications starting from fruit set at 10-15 day intervals.
    *   **Shade Management:** In areas with intense sunlight and high temperatures, consider using shade nets (e.g., 30-50% shade) to reduce heat stress and moderate canopy temperature, which can indirectly help in maintaining fruit turgor.
    *   **Variety Selection:** If possible, choose varieties known to be less susceptible to cracking.

**2. Leaf Burning/Melting**

Leaf burning or melting is typically a symptom of environmental stress, chemical phytotoxicity, or severe nutrient issues.

*   **Causes:**
    *   **Sunburn/Heat Stress:** Intense sunlight and high temperatures, especially when combined with water stress.
    *   **Water Stress:** Both drought (lack of water) and waterlogging (excess water leading to root damage) can cause leaf scorching.
    *   **Chemical Phytotoxicity:** Incorrect application of pesticides, herbicides, or fertilizers (e.g., high concentration, application during hot periods, or incompatible mixtures).
    *   **Wind Burn:** Strong, dry winds can desiccate leaves.

*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Shade Management:** This is crucial in Haryana's hot climate. Install shade nets (e.g., 50% shade) over the kiwi orchard, especially during the summer months, to reduce direct sun exposure and lower leaf temperatures.
    *   **Adequate and Consistent Irrigation:** Ensure plants receive sufficient water, particularly during hot and dry periods, to prevent water stress. Check soil moisture regularly.
    *   **Windbreaks:** Plant suitable windbreak trees or erect artificial windbreaks around the orchard to protect plants from strong, desiccating winds.
    *   **Proper Chemical Application:**
        *   Always follow label instructions for all agrochemicals regarding dosage, timing, and application conditions.
        *   Avoid spraying during the hottest part of the day or when temperatures are very high, as this increases the risk of phytotoxicity.
        *   Ensure spray equipment is calibrated correctly to avoid over-application.
    *   **Balanced Nutrition:** Maintain a healthy and balanced nutrient status in the plants, as well-nourished plants are generally more resilient to stress.

**3. Hardness in Fruit (Failure to Soften / Abnormal Firmness)**

Kiwi fruit is climacteric, meaning it ripens after harvest. Abnormal hardness or failure to soften properly is usually related to harvest maturity and post-harvest handling.

*   **Causes:**
    *   **Premature Harvesting:** Harvesting fruits before they reach physiological maturity (insufficient soluble solids content/Brix).
    *   **Improper Storage Conditions:** Too low temperatures (chilling injury) can inhibit ripening, or lack of exposure to ethylene.
    *   **Nutrient Imbalances:** While less common, certain nutrient deficiencies (e.g., boron) can sometimes affect fruit development and texture.

*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Optimal Harvest Maturity:** This is the most critical factor. Harvest kiwi fruit when they have reached the appropriate physiological maturity, typically indicated by a minimum soluble solids content (Brix) of 6.2-6.5%. Harvesting too early will result in fruits that do not ripen properly or achieve desired sweetness and texture.
    *   **Proper Post-Harvest Handling and Ripening:**
        *   **Temperature Management:** Store harvested fruits at appropriate temperatures. For long-term storage, temperatures near 0-1°C are ideal. For ripening, fruits should be held at 18-20°C.
        *   **Ethylene Treatment:** To initiate and accelerate ripening, expose fruits to **ethylene** gas. A common commercial practice is to treat fruits with 100 ppm **ethylene** for 24-48 hours at 20°C.
        *   **Co-storage with Ethylene-Producing Fruits:** Storing kiwi fruit with other ripening climacteric fruits like apples or bananas (which naturally produce ethylene) can also help induce ripening.
    *   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure the plants receive a balanced supply of all essential nutrients, including micronutrients like boron.
        *   If boron deficiency is suspected (e.g., based on soil/tissue analysis), apply **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (e.g., 1-2 kg/acre as soil application or 0.1% foliar spray).
