As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Scale insects and Mealybugs in Kiwi Fruit, applicable to conditions in Haryana.

Scale insects and Mealybugs are sap-sucking pests that can significantly damage Kiwi Fruit plants by weakening them, leading to stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, reduced fruit quality, and yield loss. They also excrete honeydew, which promotes the growth of sooty mold, further hindering photosynthesis. An Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is recommended for effective and sustainable control.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategy:**

1.  **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect plants, especially the undersides of leaves, stems, and fruit, for early signs of infestation. Early detection is crucial for effective control.

2.  **Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
    *   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy heavily infested branches, twigs, or leaves. This reduces the pest population and improves air circulation.
    *   **Sanitation:** Keep the orchard clean by removing plant debris, which can harbor pests.
    *   **Physical Removal:** For small infestations, use a strong jet of water to dislodge pests or manually remove them using a soft brush.
    *   **Plant Vigor:** Ensure proper irrigation and balanced nutrition to maintain healthy, vigorous plants, which are more resilient to pest attacks.

3.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Encourage natural enemies such as ladybird beetles (e.g., *Cryptolaemus montrouzieri* for mealybugs) and parasitic wasps (e.g., *Anagyrus lopezi* for mealybugs, various encyrtids for scales). These beneficial insects can significantly reduce pest populations. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these natural enemies.

4.  **Chemical Control (as a last resort or for severe infestations):**
    When cultural and biological methods are insufficient, judicious use of CIBRC-approved insecticides may be necessary. Always follow label instructions for dosage, timing, and safety precautions.

    **For both Scale Insects and Mealybugs, the following CIBRC-approved technical chemicals can be used:**

    *   **Horticultural Mineral Oil:**
        *   **Application:** Apply during the dormant season (for scales) or as a foliar spray during the growing season (with caution, especially in hot weather). It works by suffocating the pests.
        *   **Dosage:** 10-20 ml/L of water for dormant spray; 5-10 ml/L of water for foliar spray during the growing season.

    *   **Imidacloprid:**
        *   **Application:** A systemic insecticide effective against sucking pests.
        *   **Dosage:** 0.3-0.5 ml/L of water (for 17.8% SL formulation) or 0.1-0.2 g/L of water (for 70% WG formulation).

    *   **Thiamethoxam:**
        *   **Application:** Another systemic insecticide effective against a wide range of sucking pests.
        *   **Dosage:** 0.2-0.3 g/L of water (for 25% WG formulation).

    *   **Acetamiprid:**
        *   **Application:** A systemic and contact insecticide effective against sucking pests.
        *   **Dosage:** 0.2-0.4 g/L of water (for 20% SP formulation).

    *   **Buprofezin:**
        *   **Application:** An insect growth regulator (IGR) that interferes with molting, primarily effective against nymphs and pupae of scales and mealybugs.
        *   **Dosage:** 1.25 ml/L of water (for 25% SC formulation).

    *   **Spirotetramat:**
        *   **Application:** A systemic insecticide with translaminar movement, effective against various sucking pests including scales and mealybugs.
        *   **Dosage:** 0.5-0.75 ml/L of water (for 150 OD formulation).

    *   **Flupyradifurone:**
        *   **Application:** A systemic insecticide from the butenolide group, highly effective against sucking pests.
        *   **Dosage:** 0.5-0.75 ml/L of water (for 17.09% SL formulation).

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Timing of Application:** For scale insects, targeting the crawler stage (newly hatched nymphs) is most effective as they are more vulnerable before developing their protective waxy covering. For mealybugs, repeated applications might be needed due to their overlapping generations.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always observe the specified pre-harvest interval for any chemical applied to ensure fruit safety.
*   **Safety:** Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and application.

For specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and the severity of infestation, it is always advisable to consult with HAU experts or local agricultural extension officers.
