As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend a systematic approach to address micronutrient deficiencies in Kiwi Fruit (Actinidia deliciosa). It is crucial to first conduct a comprehensive soil and leaf tissue analysis to accurately diagnose specific deficiencies and their severity. This will ensure targeted and efficient nutrient management.

Here's how to address the specified micronutrient deficiencies:

### General Recommendation:
Always conduct soil and leaf tissue analysis to confirm deficiencies before applying any micronutrients. Over-application can lead to toxicity.

### Specific Micronutrient Deficiencies in Kiwi Fruit:

#### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency:
Symptoms often include small, narrow leaves (little leaf), shortened internodes, and interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves.

*   **Soil Application (for confirmed deficiency based on soil test):**
    *   Apply **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (33% Zn) at 10-25 kg/acre, mixed with farmyard manure, before planting or as a broadcast application in established orchards.
    *   Alternatively, apply **Zinc EDTA** (12% Zn) at 1-2 kg/acre.
*   **Foliar Application (for quick correction or mild deficiency):**
    *   Spray **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** at 0.5% concentration (5 g/L of water) along with 0.25% (2.5 g/L) of unslaked lime to prevent leaf scorching. Apply 2-3 sprays at 15-day intervals, starting at new flush.
    *   Alternatively, spray **Zinc EDTA** at 0.5-1 g/L of water.

#### 2. Iron (Fe) / Ferrous Deficiency:
Common in alkaline soils (prevalent in Haryana), symptoms include distinct interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on young leaves, with veins remaining green. In severe cases, leaves may turn almost white.

*   **Soil Application (less effective in high pH soils, but can be tried):**
    *   Apply **Ferrous sulphate** (19% Fe) at 25-50 kg/acre.
    *   For better efficacy in alkaline soils, use chelated forms: **Iron EDTA** (12% Fe) or **Iron DTPA** (11% Fe) at 2-5 kg/acre, or **Iron EDDHA** (6% Fe) at 1-2 kg/acre, especially in highly calcareous soils.
*   **Foliar Application (most effective for quick correction in alkaline soils):**
    *   Spray **Ferrous sulphate** at 0.5-1% concentration (5-10 g/L of water) along with 0.25% (2.5 g/L) of unslaked lime. Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals.
    *   Alternatively, spray **Iron EDTA** or **Iron DTPA** at 0.5-1 g/L of water.

#### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency:
Symptoms include stunted growth, dieback of growing points, poor fruit set, malformed or cracked fruits, and internal corking.

*   **Soil Application (use with caution, as boron toxicity is easy):**
    *   Apply **Sodium tetraborate decahydrate** (Borax, 10.5-11.3% B) at 5-10 kg/acre, based on soil test recommendations.
*   **Foliar Application (preferred method for boron):**
    *   Spray **Sodium tetraborate decahydrate** (Borax) at 0.1-0.2% concentration (1-2 g/L of water).
    *   Alternatively, use **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (20% B) at 0.5-1 g/L of water.
    *   Apply before flowering and again after fruit set.

#### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency:
While not as common as other micronutrients, calcium deficiency can affect fruit quality, firmness, and storage life. Symptoms can include tip burn on young leaves and poor root development.

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   If soil pH is low, apply **Calcium carbonate** (agricultural lime) as per soil test.
    *   If soil pH is high, apply **Gypsum** (Calcium sulphate dihydrate) at 200-500 kg/acre as a soil amendment, which also provides sulphur.
*   **Foliar Application (most effective for fruit quality):**
    *   Spray **Calcium nitrate** (19% Ca) at 0.5-1% concentration (5-10 g/L of water).
    *   Alternatively, spray **Calcium chloride** (27% Ca) at 0.5% concentration (5 g/L of water).
    *   Begin applications during fruit development and repeat 2-3 times at 10-15 day intervals.

#### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency:
Symptoms typically appear on older leaves as interveinal chlorosis, where the areas between the veins turn yellow while the veins remain green. In severe cases, leaves may develop reddish or purplish tints.

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Magnesium sulphate** (9.6% Mg) at 10-25 kg/acre, based on soil test.
*   **Foliar Application (for quick correction):**
    *   Spray **Magnesium sulphate** at 0.5-1% concentration (5-10 g/L of water). Apply 2-3 sprays at 15-day intervals.

#### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency:
Symptoms are similar to iron deficiency but often appear on younger leaves, showing interveinal chlorosis with a finer network of green veins. In severe cases, small necrotic spots may develop.

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Manganese sulphate** (28-30% Mn) at 10-20 kg/acre.
    *   Alternatively, apply **Manganese EDTA** (12% Mn) at 1-2 kg/acre.
*   **Foliar Application (effective for quick correction):**
    *   Spray **Manganese sulphate** at 0.5% concentration (5 g/L of water) along with 0.25% (2.5 g/L) of unslaked lime. Apply 2-3 sprays at 15-day intervals.
    *   Alternatively, spray **Manganese EDTA** at 0.5-1 g/L of water.

### Important Considerations:
*   **Timing:** Foliar applications are best done in the early morning or late afternoon to avoid scorching and maximize absorption.
*   **pH of Spray Solution:** For some micronutrients (e.g., Zinc sulphate, Ferrous sulphate, Manganese sulphate), adding a small amount of unslaked lime is crucial to adjust the pH and prevent phytotoxicity.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management:** Combine micronutrient applications with balanced macronutrient fertilization and good cultural practices for optimal plant health and yield.
*   **Water Quality:** Ensure the water used for spraying is clean and has an appropriate pH.
