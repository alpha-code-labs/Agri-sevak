Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing sucking pests in Kiwi Fruit.

Firstly, regarding Psylla, this pest is not commonly known to be a major or widespread pest of Kiwi Fruit (Actinidia deliciosa/chinensis). Therefore, specific control measures for Psylla on Kiwi Fruit are generally not required. However, the integrated management strategies for other sucking pests would likely provide incidental control if they were to appear.

For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips, an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is recommended for effective and sustainable control.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Sucking Pests in Kiwi Fruit:**

1.  **Monitoring:**
    *   Regularly inspect young shoots, leaves (especially undersides), and flowers for the presence of pests. Use yellow sticky traps to monitor whitefly and thrips populations.

2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the orchard floor free of weeds, as many weeds can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
    *   **Pruning:** Ensure proper pruning to improve air circulation and light penetration, which can reduce pest harborage. Remove and destroy severely infested plant parts.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, as it can lead to lush, succulent growth that is more attractive to sucking pests.

3.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Encourage natural enemies such as ladybird beetles, lacewings, hoverflies, and parasitic wasps. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that can harm these beneficial insects.

4.  **Chemical Control (Use only CIBRC approved technical chemicals):**
    *   Chemical intervention should be considered when pest populations reach economic threshold levels and cultural/biological methods are insufficient. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.
    *   **For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips:**
        *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at a rate of 0.5 - 0.75 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at a rate of 0.2 - 0.3 g per litre of water.
        *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply at a rate of 0.2 - 0.3 g per litre of water.
        *   **Flonicamid 50% WG:** Apply at a rate of 0.3 - 0.4 g per litre of water. (Particularly effective against aphids and whiteflies).
        *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at a rate of 1.0 - 1.25 ml per litre of water. (Effective against whiteflies and leafhoppers, acts as an insect growth regulator).
        *   **Fipronil 5% SC:** Apply at a rate of 1.0 - 1.5 ml per litre of water. (Effective against thrips and some other sucking pests).
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** Apply at a rate of 0.5 - 0.75 ml per litre of water. (Broad-spectrum, use judiciously to conserve natural enemies).
        *   **Azadirachtin (e.g., 1500 ppm EC):** Apply at a rate of 2.5 - 5.0 ml per litre of water. (An organic option with repellent, anti-feedant, and insect growth regulator properties).

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Timing of Application:** Apply insecticides during the early morning or late evening to minimize drift and maximize efficacy, especially when beneficial insects are less active.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where many sucking pests reside.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always observe the specified Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) for each chemical to ensure the safety of the fruit for consumption.
*   **Safety Precautions:** Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, and protective clothing while handling and applying pesticides.
