As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I must first highlight that commercial cultivation of Kiwi Fruit (Actinidia deliciosa) in the plains of Haryana is generally not recommended due to its specific climatic requirements. Kiwi fruit thrives in subtropical to temperate climates, requiring 600-800 chilling hours (temperatures below 7°C) during winter for proper bud break and fruit set, and is sensitive to high summer temperatures (above 35°C). These conditions are typically met in higher altitude regions of India, such as Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and parts of Jammu & Kashmir. However, if specific microclimates or protected cultivation systems are considered, the following practices are recommended:

**Propagation Method:**
It is important to note that commercial kiwi orchards are primarily established using vegetatively propagated plants (rooted cuttings, grafts, or budded plants) rather than seeds. Seeds are generally used for raising rootstock or for breeding purposes, as they produce variable offspring, take much longer to bear fruit, and the sex of the plant cannot be determined until flowering.

**Recommended Cultivation Practices for Kiwi Fruit (assuming suitable conditions and vegetative propagation for orchard establishment):**

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern (for nursery raising of seeds, if applicable):**
    *   If seeds are used for raising rootstock, they are typically sown in well-prepared nursery beds or trays filled with a sterile, well-draining potting mix.
    *   Seeds can be sown thinly in rows (e.g., 10-15 cm apart) or broadcast evenly, then lightly covered.
    *   For orchard establishment, nursery-raised, vegetatively propagated plants are planted directly into the prepared field. The planting pattern is typically square or rectangular to facilitate orchard operations and training systems.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   **For seeds in nursery:** Seeds should be sown shallowly, typically at a depth of 0.5 to 1 cm.
    *   **For nursery-raised plants (grafts/cuttings) in the field:** The plant should be set at the same depth it was growing in the nursery bag or pot. Ensure the graft union (if present) remains well above the soil line to prevent scion rooting. The root collar should be at ground level.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   Spacing depends on the cultivar, soil fertility, and the training system adopted (e.g., T-bar, pergola, or single leader system).
    *   A common spacing for commercial orchards is **4-6 meters between rows** and **4-5 meters between plants within a row**.
    *   Kiwi fruit is dioecious (separate male and female plants). It is crucial to plant male pollinator plants in the orchard. A general recommendation is to plant **1 male plant for every 5-8 female plants** within the orchard, ensuring good pollen distribution.

*   **Seed Dose (or Planting Material Dose for Orchard):**
    *   As commercial orchards are not established from direct field sowing of seeds, the term "seed dose" is not directly applicable in kg/acre for kiwi fruit.
    *   **For nursery raising of seeds (if used for rootstock):** The quantity would be based on the number of seedlings required, typically expressed as grams of seeds per square meter of nursery bed or number of seeds per tray.
    *   **For orchard establishment (planting material dose):** Based on the recommended spacing, the number of plants required per acre can be calculated. For example, with a spacing of 5 meters x 4 meters (20 square meters per plant):
        *   Number of plants per acre = 4046.86 square meters / 20 square meters/plant = approximately **202 plants per acre**.
        *   This calculation includes both male and female plants based on the desired ratio.
