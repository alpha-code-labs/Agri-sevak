As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding seed and soil treatment processes for Kiwi Fruit in Haryana:

**Seed Treatment for Kiwi Fruit:**

Commercial cultivation of Kiwi Fruit (Actinidia deliciosa) primarily relies on vegetative propagation methods such as cuttings or grafting, rather than planting seeds. Seeds are generally used for breeding purposes or rootstock development, not for establishing commercial orchards.

Therefore, specific seed treatment protocols for commercial Kiwi Fruit establishment are **not a standard practice**. The issues typically addressed by seed treatments (e.g., seed-borne diseases, damping-off) are not relevant for the vegetative planting material used in commercial orchards.

**Soil Treatment Process for Kiwi Fruit:**

Effective soil treatment is crucial for establishing a healthy and productive Kiwi Fruit orchard, especially given its perennial nature. The focus is on pre-plant soil preparation and management of potential soil-borne issues.

1.  **Pre-Plant Soil Testing and Preparation:**
    *   **Soil Analysis:** Conduct a comprehensive soil test well in advance of planting. This is critical to determine soil pH, nutrient status, and the presence of any problematic elements or pathogens. Kiwi Fruit prefers well-drained, fertile soil with a pH range of 5.5 to 6.5.
    *   **pH Correction:** Based on soil test results, amend the soil to achieve the optimal pH. If the soil is too alkaline, incorporate organic matter, elemental sulphur, or gypsum. If too acidic, add agricultural lime.
    *   **Organic Matter Enrichment:** Incorporate large quantities of well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost (20-30 tonnes per acre) into the soil during land preparation. This improves soil structure, water retention, nutrient availability, and overall soil health.

2.  **Nematode Management (if detected):**
    *   If soil tests indicate the presence of plant-parasitic nematodes (e.g., root-knot nematodes) at damaging levels, a pre-plant nematicide application may be considered.
    *   **Chemical Treatment (if necessary):**
        *   Apply **Carbofuran 3% G** at a rate of 10-15 kg per acre, uniformly broadcast and incorporated into the soil to a depth of 15-20 cm, at least 2-3 weeks before planting. Ensure proper safety measures during application.

3.  **Soil-borne Disease Management and Soil Health Enhancement:**
    *   **Drainage:** Ensure excellent soil drainage, as Kiwi Fruit is highly susceptible to root rot diseases in waterlogged conditions. Improve drainage through raised beds or subsoiling if necessary.
    *   **Biological Control Agents:** To enhance soil health and suppress soil-borne fungal pathogens, incorporate beneficial microbial agents into the soil before planting.
        *   Mix **Trichoderma viride** (2-4 kg per acre) with 100 kg of well-decomposed farmyard manure or compost. Apply this mixture uniformly to the soil and incorporate it before planting.
        *   Similarly, **Pseudomonas fluorescens** (2-4 kg per acre) can be mixed with 100 kg of FYM/compost and applied to the soil. These bio-agents help in suppressing various soil-borne diseases and promoting plant growth.

These recommendations aim to provide a strong foundation for successful Kiwi Fruit cultivation in Haryana, focusing on sustainable practices and targeted interventions where necessary.
