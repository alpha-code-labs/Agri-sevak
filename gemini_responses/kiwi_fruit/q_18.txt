As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified recommendations for the use of growth regulators and micronutrients in Kiwi Fruit cultivation, keeping in mind the specific context of Haryana and CIBRC approved chemicals.

Please note that the specific recommendations can vary based on cultivar, local climatic conditions, and soil analysis. Always conduct a small-scale trial before widespread application.

### Recommended Doses of Growth Regulators/Hormones and Micronutrients in Kiwi Fruit:

**1. Ethephon (Ethrel)**

**Ethephon** is an ethylene-releasing compound primarily used for promoting uniform ripening in climacteric fruits like Kiwi. It is typically applied post-harvest.

*   **Purpose:** To promote uniform ripening of harvested Kiwi fruit.
*   **Dose:** For post-harvest ripening, a dip treatment or spray application is recommended.
    *   **Concentration:** 500-1000 mg/L (ppm) of **Ethephon** (e.g., 1.25 - 2.5 ml of 40% Ethephon formulation per litre of water).
    *   **Application:** Dip harvested fruits for 1-2 minutes or spray thoroughly, then store under appropriate conditions.
*   **Timing:** Post-harvest, when fruits have reached physiological maturity but are still firm.

**2. 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D)**

Regarding **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid**, while it is a synthetic auxin, its primary agricultural use is as a herbicide. Its application as a plant growth regulator for beneficial effects in Kiwi fruit development (such as fruit set or preventing pre-harvest drop) is **not a standard or recommended practice** in commercial Kiwi cultivation. There are no established recommendations for its use as a growth regulator in Kiwi fruit due to potential phytotoxicity and lack of clear, consistent benefits compared to other available growth regulators or micronutrients.

**This is not known to be a recommended growth regulator for beneficial effects in Kiwi Fruit.**

**3. Boron**

Boron is a crucial micronutrient essential for pollen germination, pollen tube growth, fruit set, and overall fruit development in Kiwi. Deficiency can lead to poor fruit set and deformed fruits.

*   **Purpose:** To ensure adequate fruit set, pollen viability, and fruit development.
*   **Forms:** Boron is commonly applied as **Boric acid** or **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (e.g., Solubor).
*   **Dose (Foliar Application):**
    *   **Concentration:** 0.1% - 0.2% Boron solution.
        *   Using **Boric acid** (approx. 17% Boron): 600-1200 mg of **Boric acid** per litre of water.
        *   Using **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (approx. 20% Boron): 500-1000 mg of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** per litre of water.
    *   **Application:** Spray to run-off, ensuring thorough coverage of foliage and flowers.
*   **Timing:**
    *   **Pre-bloom:** One spray 1-2 weeks before flowering to enhance pollen viability.
    *   **Post-bloom:** Another spray after fruit set, typically 2-3 weeks after petal fall, to support fruit development.
*   **Soil Application (if severe deficiency is confirmed by soil test):**
    *   **Dose:** 1-2 kg of **Borax** (11% Boron) or 0.5-1 kg of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** per acre, applied annually or biennially, based on soil test recommendations.
    *   **Application:** Broadcast evenly around the base of the plants and lightly incorporate into the soil.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the manufacturer's instructions on the product label.
*   Ensure proper calibration of spray equipment for accurate application.
*   Avoid spraying during hot periods of the day to prevent phytotoxicity and ensure better absorption.
*   For Boron, excessive application can be toxic, so soil and leaf analysis are recommended to determine actual needs.
