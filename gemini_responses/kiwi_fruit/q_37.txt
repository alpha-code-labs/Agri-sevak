Protecting Kiwi Fruit from wild animals is crucial for successful cultivation in Haryana. Various wild animals, including Nilgai (Blue Bull), Wild Boar, Monkeys, and rodents, can cause significant damage to the plants and fruits. Here are scientifically verified methods to mitigate this issue:

*   **Perimeter Fencing:**
    *   **Robust Fencing:** Install a strong perimeter fence around the entire orchard. For deterring larger animals like Nilgai and Monkeys, a fence height of at least 2.5 to 3 meters is recommended.
    *   **Wild Boar Protection:** To prevent wild boar from burrowing under, the fence should be buried at least 30-50 cm deep into the ground and made of sturdy material like woven wire mesh or chain-link.
    *   **Electric Fencing:** If legally permissible and installed with appropriate safety measures, a multi-strand electric fence can be highly effective against a range of wild animals.

*   **Netting:**
    *   **Overhead Netting:** For protection against Monkeys and birds, especially during the fruiting stage, install anti-bird or anti-monkey nets over the entire trellis system. Ensure the mesh size is small enough to deter the target animals without hindering pollination.
    *   **Individual Plant Netting:** For young plants or particularly vulnerable sections, individual netting can be used.

*   **Tree Guards:**
    *   **Young Plant Protection:** For newly planted kiwi vines, use plastic or wire mesh tree guards around the base of the stem. This protects against rodents, porcupines, and smaller herbivores that might gnaw on the bark or young shoots.

*   **Habitat Management and Sanitation:**
    *   **Weed Control:** Keep the area around the orchard clean and free of weeds, tall grasses, and dense undergrowth. This reduces hiding spots for wild animals and makes the area less attractive.
    *   **Fallen Fruit Removal:** Regularly remove any fallen or damaged fruit from the orchard floor. Accumulation of fruit can attract animals like wild boar and rodents.
    *   **Buffer Zones:** Maintain a clear buffer zone around the orchard, free of dense vegetation, to make it less appealing for animals to approach.

*   **Auditory and Visual Deterrents:**
    *   **Scarecrows and Reflective Devices:** While their effectiveness can be limited as animals tend to habituate, scarecrows, reflective tapes, or shiny objects can provide temporary deterrence, especially when moved frequently.
    *   **Sound Devices:** Devices emitting loud noises or distress calls can be used, but their long-term effectiveness is often low due to habituation.

*   **Guard Dogs:**
    *   **Trained Dogs:** Employing trained guard dogs can be an effective traditional method to deter many wild animals, especially those that are nocturnal.

*   **Community-Based Approaches:**
    *   **Coordinated Efforts:** Collaborate with neighboring farmers to implement synchronized protection measures, as isolated efforts may simply shift the problem to adjacent fields.

Please note that chemical repellents are generally not recommended for wild animal deterrence on fruit crops due to concerns about efficacy, safety, and regulatory approvals for such specific applications on edible produce. Physical barriers and habitat management are the most reliable and sustainable methods.
