As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified recommendations for the application of organic manures in Kiwi Fruit cultivation. Please note that these are general guidelines, and actual doses may vary based on soil test reports, plant age, and specific cultivar requirements.

Here are the recommended doses for Organic Manures in Kiwi Fruit:

*   **Farm Yard Manure (FYM)**:
    *   For young, non-bearing plants (1-3 years old): 10-20 kg per plant per year.
    *   For bearing plants (4 years and older): 25-50 kg per plant per year.
    *   Application: Apply annually, preferably during late autumn or early winter, by incorporating it into the soil around the plant's root zone.

*   **Vermicompost**:
    *   For young, non-bearing plants (1-3 years old): 2-5 kg per plant per year.
    *   For bearing plants (4 years and older): 5-10 kg per plant per year.
    *   Application: Apply annually, similar to FYM, incorporating it into the soil. Vermicompost can also be split into two applications (e.g., pre-flowering and post-fruit set) for better nutrient availability.

*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract based product)**:
    *   Sagarika is a plant growth promoter and bio-stimulant, typically used as a supplement rather than a bulk manure.
    *   Foliar Spray: 2.5-5 ml per litre of water.
    *   Soil Drench/Drip Application: 1-2 litres per acre, diluted in sufficient water.
    *   Application: Apply at critical growth stages such as pre-flowering, fruit set, and fruit development. Multiple applications (2-3 times) during the growing season are generally recommended.
