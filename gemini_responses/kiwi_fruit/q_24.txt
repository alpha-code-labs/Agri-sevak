As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for the ideal transplantation of Kiwi Fruit in Haryana:

Kiwi fruit (Actinidia deliciosa) is a temperate fruit, and its successful cultivation in Haryana requires careful consideration of the local climate, particularly the high summer temperatures and potential for insufficient chilling hours for some varieties. However, with proper management and selection of suitable varieties, it can be grown.

### Ideal Transplantation Time

*   **Late January to February:** This period is ideal as it allows the dormant saplings to establish their root system before the onset of intense summer heat and after the severe winter cold has passed. Planting during dormancy minimizes transplant shock and provides a longer period for establishment before active growth begins.

### Ideal Transplantation Distance

The spacing depends on the training system used (e.g., T-bar, pergola, or single leader). For general cultivation in Haryana, a robust training system is recommended to manage the vine and provide shade during peak summer.

*   **Row to Row:** 4.0 to 5.0 meters
*   **Plant to Plant:** 3.0 to 4.0 meters
    *   A common recommended spacing is **4 meters x 4 meters** (plant to plant x row to row) or **4 meters x 5 meters**. This spacing ensures adequate sunlight penetration, air circulation, and space for vine development and management.

### Ideal Transplantation Process

1.  **Pit Preparation (15-30 days prior):**
    *   Dig pits of **60 cm x 60 cm x 60 cm** at the marked distances.
    *   Allow the pits to weather for 15-30 days under direct sunlight. This helps in sterilizing the soil and improving its structure.
    *   Mix the excavated topsoil with **15-20 kg** of well-decomposed Farmyard Manure (FYM) or compost per pit. If the soil is heavy clay, adding some sand can improve drainage.

2.  **Planting the Sapling:**
    *   Carefully remove the kiwi sapling from its container, ensuring the root ball remains intact. Avoid disturbing the roots as much as possible.
    *   Place the sapling in the center of the prepared pit.
    *   Ensure the top of the root ball is level with or slightly above the surrounding ground level to prevent waterlogging around the stem. If the plant is grafted, ensure the graft union is well above the soil line.
    *   Backfill the pit with the prepared soil mixture, gently firming the soil around the roots to remove any air pockets.

3.  **Initial Watering:**
    *   Immediately after planting, water the sapling thoroughly until the soil is well-settled. This helps in establishing good contact between the roots and the soil.

4.  **Support and Training:**
    *   Provide a sturdy stake or support immediately after planting, as kiwi is a vigorous vine and requires support for upright growth and future training.
    *   Begin training the young vine towards its permanent support system (e.g., trellis wires) as it grows.

5.  **Mulching:**
    *   Apply a layer of organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves, wood chips) around the base of the plant, keeping it a few centimeters away from the stem. This helps conserve soil moisture, regulate soil temperature, and suppress weed growth, which is crucial in Haryana's climate.

6.  **Protection:**
    *   Protect young plants from strong winds and direct scorching sun during the initial establishment phase, especially as summer approaches. Temporary shading can be beneficial.
