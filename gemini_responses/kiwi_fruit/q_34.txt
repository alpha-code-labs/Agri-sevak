Kiwi fruit vines are highly sensitive to herbicides, and improper application can lead to severe damage, reduced yield, or even plant mortality. The key to reducing harmful effects lies in prevention through meticulous application and integrating alternative weed management strategies.

Here's how to reduce the harmful effects of weedicides/herbicides in Kiwi Fruit:

*   **Understanding Kiwi Fruit Sensitivity:**
    *   Kiwi vines, especially young plants and those with green bark, are very susceptible to herbicide contact.
    *   Their shallow root system can also be affected by certain soil-active herbicides if not chosen or applied carefully.
    *   Symptoms of herbicide damage can include leaf yellowing, scorching, distortion, stunted growth, and dieback.

*   **Prioritize Non-Chemical Weed Management:**
    *   **Mulching:** Apply a thick layer (10-15 cm) of organic mulch (e.g., straw, wood chips, rice husk) around the base of the vines. This effectively suppresses weeds, conserves soil moisture, and regulates soil temperature, significantly reducing the need for herbicides.
    *   **Manual Weeding:** For weeds growing very close to the vine trunk or in young plantations, manual weeding is the safest and most recommended method.
    *   **Inter-row Cultivation:** In wider row spacing, shallow mechanical cultivation can manage weeds in the inter-row areas. Ensure cultivation is shallow to avoid damaging the Kiwi's root system.
    *   **Cover Cropping:** Planting non-competitive cover crops (e.g., certain legumes) in the alleys between rows can suppress weeds, improve soil health, and reduce erosion, thereby minimizing herbicide use in those areas.

*   **Strategic Herbicide Selection (If Absolutely Necessary):**
    *   Choose herbicides that are specifically registered for use in orchards and have a low risk of translocation or soil residual activity that could harm Kiwi.
    *   Consult with HAU experts or extension services for specific product recommendations suitable for your region and Kiwi cultivation.

*   **Precision Application Techniques (Most Critical for Harm Reduction):**
    *   **Shielded Sprayers:** Always use shielded sprayers or spray guards to physically prevent herbicide spray from contacting the Kiwi vines. This is the single most important measure.
    *   **Nozzle Selection:** Use low-pressure, large-droplet nozzles (e.g., flood jet, flat fan, or air-induction nozzles) to minimize the production of fine spray particles that are prone to drift.
    *   **Avoid Windy Conditions:** Never apply herbicides when wind speeds exceed 8-10 km/h. Even a slight breeze can carry herbicide droplets onto sensitive Kiwi foliage.
    *   **Correct Dosage and Calibration:** Strictly adhere to the recommended dosage for the target weeds. Overdosing increases the risk of crop injury. Calibrate your sprayer regularly to ensure accurate application rates.
    *   **Timing of Application:** Apply herbicides when weeds are young and actively growing, as they are most susceptible. Avoid application during periods of crop stress (e.g., drought, extreme heat) or when the Kiwi vines are actively flushing new growth.
    *   **Avoid Direct Contact:** Ensure no herbicide spray comes into contact with the trunk (especially green bark), leaves, flowers, or developing fruit of the Kiwi vine. Remove any basal suckers before application, as they are highly vulnerable.
    *   **Water Quality:** Use clean water for mixing herbicides. Hard water can sometimes reduce herbicide efficacy.
    *   **Dedicated Sprayer:** Ideally, use a sprayer dedicated solely for herbicides to avoid contamination with other agrochemicals. If not possible, thoroughly clean the sprayer after each use.

*   **Post-Application Monitoring and Mitigation (If Damage Occurs):**
    *   **Immediate Irrigation:** If accidental spray drift or direct contact occurs, immediately irrigate the affected area heavily. This can help dilute soil-applied herbicides or wash off foliar residues (if it's a contact herbicide and done very quickly).
    *   **Foliar Nutrient Application:** In case of mild damage, a foliar spray of a balanced nutrient solution can help the plant recover by boosting its vigor. Consider applying:
        *   **Urea** (0.5-1% solution, i.e., 5-10 g/L of water)
        *   **Zinc sulphate** (0.25% solution, i.e., 2.5 g/L of water)
        *   **Ferrous sulphate** (0.25% solution, i.e., 2.5 g/L of water)
        *   Apply these sprays in the morning or late afternoon.
    *   **Pruning:** Remove severely damaged leaves or shoots to encourage new, healthy growth from unaffected parts of the vine.

By adopting these practices, you can significantly reduce the risk of herbicide damage to your Kiwi fruit orchard and maintain healthy, productive vines.
