As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified information on specialized practices for Kiwi Fruit cultivation, keeping in mind the context of Haryana.

### Specialized Practices in Kiwi Fruit Cultivation

Kiwi fruit (Actinidia deliciosa) cultivation requires specific management practices to ensure optimal growth, yield, and fruit quality.

#### 1. Pruning

Pruning is critical for managing vine vigor, improving fruit size and quality, and maintaining productivity. It is typically divided into dormant (winter) and summer (green) pruning.

*   **Dormant Pruning (Winter Pruning):**
    *   Performed during the dormant season (late winter, before bud break).
    *   **Objective:** To remove old, unproductive wood, select new fruiting canes, and maintain the desired vine structure (e.g., T-bar or pergola system).
    *   **Procedure:**
        *   Remove all canes that fruited in the previous season, as Kiwi fruit bears on one-year-old wood.
        *   Select new, vigorous, well-placed canes (approximately 8-12 buds long) to replace the old ones. These will be the fruiting canes for the upcoming season.
        *   Remove weak, diseased, or crossing branches.
        *   Maintain a balance between vegetative and reproductive growth.
        *   For male plants, prune after flowering to ensure sufficient pollen production, removing spent flower shoots and maintaining a compact structure.

*   **Summer Pruning (Green Pruning):**
    *   Performed during the growing season (spring and summer).
    *   **Objective:** To manage excessive vegetative growth, improve light penetration into the canopy, enhance fruit development, and facilitate pest and disease management.
    *   **Procedure:**
        *   Remove unwanted suckers and water sprouts.
        *   Thin out crowded shoots to ensure adequate air circulation and light exposure for developing fruits.
        *   Cut back vigorous lateral shoots to 4-6 leaves beyond the last fruit, or to 2-3 leaves if they are non-fruiting laterals.
        *   This helps direct the plant's energy towards fruit development rather than excessive leaf growth.

#### 2. Desuckering

Desuckering involves the removal of unwanted shoots (suckers) that emerge from the base of the plant or from the rootstock below the graft union.

*   **Objective:** To prevent competition for nutrients and water, maintain the desired plant structure, and ensure the vigor of the main vine or scion.
*   **Procedure:**
    *   Regularly inspect the base of the plant and the main trunk during the growing season.
    *   Remove any shoots originating from below the ground or from the rootstock as soon as they appear.
    *   These suckers are often vigorous and can divert significant resources from the main fruiting canes.

#### 3. Mulching

Mulching involves applying a layer of organic or inorganic material on the soil surface around the base of the Kiwi fruit vines.

*   **Objective:**
    *   **Moisture Conservation:** Reduces evaporation from the soil surface, crucial in Haryana's climate.
    *   **Weed Suppression:** Inhibits weed growth, reducing competition for water and nutrients.
    *   **Soil Temperature Moderation:** Keeps the soil cooler in summer and warmer in winter, protecting roots.
    *   **Soil Health Improvement:** Organic mulches decompose, adding organic matter and nutrients to the soil.
    *   **Erosion Control:** Protects the soil from wind and water erosion.
*   **Materials:**
    *   **Organic Mulches:** Straw, wood chips, sugarcane trash, paddy husk, or well-rotted farmyard manure. Apply a layer of 10-15 cm thickness.
    *   **Inorganic Mulches:** Black plastic mulch can be used, particularly for weed control and soil warming in cooler periods, but care must be taken to avoid excessive heat buildup in hot summers.
*   **Application:** Apply mulch around the base of the vines, keeping a small gap from the main stem to prevent collar rot. Replenish organic mulches as they decompose.

#### 4. Grafting

Grafting is a horticultural technique used to join two plant parts (scion and rootstock) so they grow as one plant.

*   **Objective:**
    *   **Propagation of Desirable Cultivars:** To multiply specific female (fruiting) and male (pollinator) varieties that cannot be reliably propagated from seeds.
    *   **Rootstock Benefits:** To utilize rootstocks that are tolerant to specific soil conditions (e.g., nematodes, certain soil-borne diseases) or to influence vigor.
    *   **Faster Fruiting:** Grafted plants generally come into bearing earlier than seedling plants.
*   **Methods:**
    *   **Whip-and-Tongue Grafting:** Commonly used for dormant scions onto dormant rootstocks.
    *   **Cleft Grafting:** Suitable for joining a smaller scion onto a larger rootstock.
    *   **Budding (e.g., T-budding):** Can also be used during the active growing season.
*   **Rootstocks:** Typically, seedling rootstocks of *Actinidia deliciosa* or *Actinidia chinensis* are used.
*   **Timing:** Grafting is usually performed during the dormant season (late winter/early spring) when the rootstock is dormant but sap flow is about to begin.
*   **Procedure:** Ensure good cambial contact between the scion and rootstock, secure the graft union with grafting tape, and apply grafting wax or sealant to prevent desiccation.

#### 5. Pollination

Kiwi fruit plants are dioecious, meaning male and female flowers are borne on separate plants. Effective pollination is essential for fruit set and development.

*   **Requirement:** Both male (pollinator) and female (fruiting) plants must be present in the orchard.
*   **Pollinators:**
    *   **Bees:** Honeybees are the primary and most efficient pollinators for Kiwi fruit.
    *   **Wind:** Plays a minor role in pollen dispersal but is generally insufficient for commercial fruit set.
*   **Planting Ratio and Placement:**
    *   A common recommendation is to plant **1 male plant for every 5-8 female plants**.
    *   Male plants should be strategically distributed throughout the orchard to ensure good pollen availability to all female plants. Planting male plants in every third row and every third position within that row is a common practice.
*   **Ensuring Effective Pollination:**
    *   **Synchronized Flowering:** Select male and female varieties that have overlapping flowering periods.
    *   **Bee Activity:** Introduce beehives into the orchard during the flowering period (typically 3-5 hives per acre) to maximize pollination.
    *   **Male Flower Vigor:** Ensure male plants are healthy and produce abundant, viable pollen. Pruning of male plants should be done after flowering to avoid reducing pollen load.
    *   **Avoid Pesticides:** Do not spray insecticides during the flowering period to protect pollinator populations.

These specialized practices, when implemented correctly, are fundamental to establishing a productive and sustainable Kiwi fruit orchard in regions like Haryana.
