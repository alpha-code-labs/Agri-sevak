Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm that Red spider mites (Tetranychus urticae) and Rust mites (e.g., Aculops lycopersici, though specific species on Kiwi might vary) are known pests that can affect Kiwi Fruit, particularly under warm and dry conditions which can prevail in parts of Haryana. Effective management is crucial to prevent yield and quality losses.

Here's a scientifically verified approach to control mites in Kiwi Fruit:

**I. General Management Practices:**

1.  **Regular Monitoring:** Inspect your Kiwi plants regularly, especially the undersides of leaves, for early signs of mites (fine webbing, bronzing/stippling of leaves, tiny moving specks). Early detection allows for timely intervention.
2.  **Water Management:** Ensure adequate irrigation. Water stress can make plants more susceptible to mite infestations. Overhead irrigation or strong water sprays can physically dislodge mites and increase humidity, which is unfavorable for spider mites.
3.  **Weed Control:** Remove weeds around the orchard as they can act as alternate hosts for mites.
4.  **Pruning:** Proper pruning improves air circulation, which can help reduce mite populations.

**II. Chemical Control (Acaricides):**

When mite populations reach damaging levels, chemical intervention with CIBRC approved acaricides is necessary. Always rotate different classes of acaricides to prevent the development of resistance. Ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where mites reside.

Here are some recommended CIBRC approved technical chemicals:

*   **Spiromesifen:** Apply **Spiromesifen** at a concentration of 0.5 ml per litre of water. This is effective against various mite stages, including eggs and nymphs.
*   **Fenpyroximate:** Use **Fenpyroximate** at a concentration of 0.5 ml per litre of water. It provides quick knockdown and residual control.
*   **Propargite:** Apply **Propargite** at a concentration of 1.0-1.5 ml per litre of water. It is effective against a wide range of mites.
*   **Wettable Sulphur:** For rust mites and early infestations of spider mites, **Wettable Sulphur** (90% WP) can be highly effective. Apply at a concentration of 2.0-3.0 grams per litre of water. Avoid application during very hot weather (above 30°C) as it can cause phytotoxicity.
*   **Abamectin:** Use **Abamectin** at a concentration of 0.4-0.5 ml per litre of water. It is a translaminar acaricide, meaning it penetrates the leaf tissue, providing good control.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Rotation:** Never use the same acaricide repeatedly. Rotate between different chemical groups (modes of action) to prevent mites from developing resistance.
*   **Timing:** Apply acaricides when mite populations are building up, before they cause significant damage. Repeat applications may be necessary based on infestation levels and product recommendations.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always observe the specified Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) mentioned on the product label to ensure the fruit is safe for consumption and market.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, and protective clothing while mixing and spraying chemicals. Follow all instructions and safety precautions mentioned on the product label.
