As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling soil pests like termites and nematodes (specifically root-knot nematodes) in Kiwi Fruit cultivation in Haryana. Both these pests are known to affect Kiwi Fruit plants.

### Control of Termites in Kiwi Fruit

Termites can cause significant damage, especially to young plants, by feeding on the roots and stem base, leading to wilting and eventual death.

**1. Cultural and Preventive Measures:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove all dead wood, stumps, and crop residues from the orchard area, as these serve as breeding grounds for termites.
*   **Proper Irrigation:** Maintain adequate soil moisture, as termites prefer dry conditions. However, avoid waterlogging.
*   **Organic Matter:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost, as healthy soil with good organic matter content can support natural enemies of termites.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** Before planting, deep ploughing can expose termite colonies to predators and sunlight.

**2. Chemical Control (Soil Application):**
For established infestations or as a preventive measure in high-risk areas, chemical treatment can be effective.
*   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC:** Apply as a soil drench around the base of the affected plants. Mix **2.5-5 ml** per litre of water and drench the soil thoroughly around the root zone.
*   **Fipronil 5% SC:** Can be used as a soil drench. Mix **1-2 ml** per litre of water and apply around the plant base.
*   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply as a soil drench for systemic protection. Mix **0.5-1 ml** per litre of water and drench the soil around the plant.

### Control of Nematodes (Root-Knot Nematodes) in Kiwi Fruit

Root-knot nematodes (*Meloidogyne* species) are a major concern, causing galls on roots, leading to stunted growth, nutrient deficiency symptoms, and reduced yield.

**1. Cultural and Preventive Measures:**
*   **Use Healthy Planting Material:** Always use nematode-free saplings from certified nurseries.
*   **Soil Solarization:** For nursery beds or small planting areas, cover moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets during hot summer months (4-6 weeks) to kill nematodes.
*   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporate large quantities of well-decomposed FYM, neem cake (**200-400 kg/acre**), or other organic matter. This improves soil health and promotes natural enemies of nematodes.
*   **Crop Rotation:** While difficult in perennial orchards, in new planting areas, avoid planting susceptible crops before Kiwi.
*   **Resistant Rootstocks:** If available and suitable for Kiwi in your region, consider using nematode-resistant rootstocks.

**2. Biological Control:**
*   **Purpureocillium lilacinum (1% WP or 1% GR):** This bio-nematicide can be highly effective. Apply **2.5-5 kg/acre** (WP) mixed with 100-200 kg of FYM or compost, or use **10-20 kg/acre** (GR) as a soil application around the root zone. Ensure adequate soil moisture for its activity.

**3. Chemical Control (Soil Application):**
For severe infestations, chemical nematicides can be used.
*   **Fluensulfone 2% GR:** Apply **20-30 kg/acre** by broadcasting and incorporating into the soil before planting, or as a side-dressing for established plants.
*   **Cadusafos 10% GR:** Apply **10-15 kg/acre** by broadcasting and incorporating into the soil, or as a side-dressing around the plants.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the label instructions for any chemical product.
*   Apply chemicals during appropriate weather conditions and ensure worker safety by using personal protective equipment.
*   Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods, is recommended for sustainable pest control.
*   Consult your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions.
