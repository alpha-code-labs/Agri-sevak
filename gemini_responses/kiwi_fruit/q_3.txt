As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I must first provide context regarding Kiwi fruit cultivation in Haryana.

Kiwi fruit (Actinidia deliciosa) is a temperate crop that requires specific climatic conditions, including sufficient chilling hours (typically 600-800 hours below 7°C) and well-drained, slightly acidic soils. These conditions are generally not met in most parts of Haryana for commercial cultivation. While some experimental or niche cultivation might occur in cooler pockets or under protected environments, it is not a widely recommended or commercially significant crop in the state. Therefore, specific disease prevalence and management protocols for Kiwi fruit rots in Haryana are not extensively documented or recommended by HAU.

However, if Kiwi fruit cultivation is undertaken, general principles of disease management, including for various rot types, would apply. The following advice is based on scientific understanding of Kiwi fruit diseases globally, adapted with CIBRC-approved chemicals available in India. It is crucial to understand that the efficacy and specific disease pressure might vary significantly in Haryana's unique conditions.

**General Principles for Rot Management in Kiwi Fruit:**

Effective control of rot diseases relies heavily on integrated management, combining cultural practices with judicious use of fungicides when necessary.

**I. Cultural and Horticultural Practices (Preventive Measures):**

These practices are fundamental for preventing the onset and spread of all types of rot:

*   **Site Selection and Soil Management:**
    *   Choose well-drained sites. Avoid heavy, waterlogged soils, which are primary contributors to root, collar, and crown rots.
    *   Improve soil drainage by incorporating adequate organic matter or establishing raised beds.
    *   Maintain optimal soil pH (5.5-6.5) for Kiwi growth.
*   **Use Healthy Planting Material:**
    *   Always procure healthy, disease-free saplings or seeds from reputable nurseries. Inspect roots and stems for any lesions or discoloration before planting.
*   **Water Management:**
    *   Avoid overwatering. Implement efficient irrigation systems like drip irrigation to deliver water directly to the root zone, minimizing wetting of the stem base and foliage.
    *   Ensure proper drainage after irrigation or rainfall to prevent water stagnation.
*   **Pruning and Canopy Management:**
    *   Prune regularly to ensure good air circulation within the canopy, which reduces humidity and discourages fungal growth (e.g., fruit rot, black rot).
    *   Remove all diseased, dead, or damaged plant parts promptly and destroy them away from the orchard.
    *   Sanitize pruning tools with a disinfectant (e.g., 10% bleach solution) between plants to prevent disease transmission.
*   **Weed Control:**
    *   Keep the area around the plants free of weeds, as they can compete for nutrients, harbor pathogens, and impede air circulation.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:**
    *   Provide balanced fertilization. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can promote lush, succulent growth that is more susceptible to certain rots.
*   **Orchard Sanitation:**
    *   Regularly remove fallen fruit, leaves, and other plant debris from the orchard floor, as these can serve as sources of inoculum for various rot pathogens.
*   **Crop Rotation (for nursery/seedling production):**
    *   If propagating Kiwi from seed or in a nursery, practice crop rotation to reduce the buildup of soil-borne pathogens.

**II. Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved Technical Names):**

Fungicides should be used as a supplementary measure to cultural practices, especially when disease pressure is high or as a preventive application in susceptible stages. Always follow label instructions for dosage, application method, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).

**A. For Root Rot, Stem Rot, Foot Rot, Collar Rot, Crown Rot, and Neck Rot (primarily caused by *Phytophthora*, *Pythium*, *Fusarium*, *Rhizoctonia* species):**

These rots are often soil-borne and affect the plant at or below the soil line.

*   **Soil Drench/Drip Application:**
    *   **Metalaxyl-M 35% ES:** Apply 1.0-1.5 ml/L of water as a soil drench around the base of affected plants.
    *   **Fosetyl-aluminium 80% WP:** Apply 2.5-3.0 g/L of water as a soil drench. This is a systemic fungicide.
    *   **Propamocarb Hydrochloride 72.2% SL:** Apply 2.0-3.0 ml/L of water as a soil drench.
    *   **Copper Oxychloride 50% WP:** Apply 2.0-3.0 g/L of water as a drench or paint a paste on affected stem parts (collar/foot rot).

**B. For Fruit Rot and Black Rot (e.g., *Botrytis cinerea*, *Sclerotinia sclerotiorum*, *Botryosphaeria* spp., *Alternaria* spp., *Penicillium* spp.):**

These rots typically affect the aerial parts of the plant, especially fruits.

*   **Foliar Spray Applications:**
    *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:** Apply 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water as a foliar spray, particularly during flowering and fruit development stages.
    *   **Pyraclostrobin 20% WG:** Apply 0.75-1.0 g/L of water as a foliar spray.
    *   **Difenoconazole 25% EC:** Apply 0.5 ml/L of water as a foliar spray.
    *   **Carbendazim 50% WP:** Apply 1.0 g/L of water as a foliar spray. (Note: Be mindful of potential resistance development with repeated use).
    *   **Mancozeb 75% WP:** Apply 2.0-2.5 g/L of water as a protective foliar spray.
    *   **Fludioxonil 2.5% + Cyprodinil 37.5% WG:** Apply 0.6-0.8 g/L of water as a foliar spray, highly effective against *Botrytis* and *Sclerotinia*.

**C. For Seed Rot and Seedling Rot (Damping-off):**

These rots affect seeds before germination or young seedlings.

*   **Seed Treatment:**
    *   **Thiram 75% WS:** Treat seeds at 2.0-3.0 g/kg of seed.
    *   **Carbendazim 50% WP:** Treat seeds at 1.0-2.0 g/kg of seed.
    *   **Metalaxyl-M 31.8% ES:** Treat seeds at 3.0-4.0 ml/kg of seed.
*   **Soil Drench (for nursery beds/seedlings):**
    *   **Propamocarb Hydrochloride 72.2% SL:** Apply 2.0-3.0 ml/L of water as a drench to nursery beds or around young seedlings.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always strictly adhere to the pre-harvest interval specified on the fungicide label to ensure fruit safety.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of fungicide resistance in pathogen populations.
*   **Local Consultation:** Given the non-traditional nature of Kiwi cultivation in Haryana, it is highly recommended to consult with local agricultural experts or HAU specialists if you are considering or undertaking Kiwi cultivation, for the most relevant and up-to-date advice specific to your microclimate and soil conditions.
