As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified management strategies for growth issues in Kiwi Fruit, keeping in mind the specific conditions of Haryana.

It is crucial to first accurately diagnose the underlying cause of the growth issue through soil testing and leaf analysis. This will ensure targeted and effective management.

### Management of Growth Issues in Kiwi Fruit:

#### 1. Slow Growth

Slow growth can be indicative of nutrient deficiencies, poor soil conditions, water stress, or pest/disease issues.

*   **Diagnosis:**
    *   Conduct a comprehensive soil test to assess pH, organic matter content, and macro/micronutrient levels.
    *   Perform leaf tissue analysis to confirm specific nutrient deficiencies.
    *   Inspect roots for signs of nematode damage or root rot.
*   **Soil Management:**
    *   **Improve Drainage:** If waterlogging is an issue, improve soil drainage by incorporating organic matter or creating raised beds.
    *   **Address Compaction:** Loosen compacted soil by incorporating well-rotted farmyard manure (FYM) or compost (10-15 kg/plant annually).
    *   **pH Correction:** Kiwi prefers slightly acidic to neutral soil (pH 5.5-7.0).
        *   If pH is high: Apply **Elemental Sulphur** (250-500 kg/acre, depending on soil type and initial pH, incorporated well before planting or carefully around established plants).
        *   If pH is low: Apply agricultural lime as per soil test recommendations.
*   **Nutrient Management (based on soil/leaf analysis):**
    *   **Nitrogen (N):** Apply **Urea** (46% N) at 100-150 g/plant/year, split into 2-3 applications during the growing season.
    *   **Phosphorus (P):** Apply **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5) at 150-200 g/plant/year, applied once or twice.
    *   **Potassium (K):** Apply **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** (60% K2O) at 150-200 g/plant/year, split into 2 applications.
    *   **Micronutrients (Foliar spray for quick correction if deficiency confirmed):**
        *   Zinc (Zn): Spray **Zinc Sulphate** (21% Zn) at 0.5% (5 g/L) solution.
        *   Iron (Fe): Spray **Ferrous Sulphate** (19% Fe) at 0.5% (5 g/L) solution.
        *   Manganese (Mn): Spray **Manganese Sulphate** (30.5% Mn) at 0.5% (5 g/L) solution.
        *   Boron (B): Spray **Borax** (10.5% B) at 0.1% (1 g/L) solution.
*   **Water Management:** Ensure consistent soil moisture. Avoid both water deficit and waterlogging. Drip irrigation is highly recommended.

#### 2. Yellow Growth (Chlorosis)

Yellowing of leaves (chlorosis) is often due to nutrient deficiencies, particularly micronutrients, or high soil pH.

*   **Diagnosis:**
    *   Leaf tissue analysis is crucial to identify the specific deficient nutrient (e.g., Iron, Zinc, Manganese, Nitrogen, Magnesium).
    *   Check soil pH, as high pH can lock up micronutrients.
*   **Soil pH Correction:**
    *   If high pH is the cause, incorporate organic matter and apply **Elemental Sulphur** as mentioned under "Slow Growth".
*   **Nutrient Management (Foliar sprays for rapid correction):**
    *   **Iron (Fe) Deficiency (interveinal chlorosis on young leaves):** Spray **Ferrous Sulphate** (19% Fe) at 0.5% (5 g/L) solution with a wetting agent. Repeat every 10-15 days until recovery.
    *   **Zinc (Zn) Deficiency (small, yellow leaves, rosetting):** Spray **Zinc Sulphate** (21% Zn) at 0.5% (5 g/L) solution.
    *   **Manganese (Mn) Deficiency (interveinal chlorosis on young leaves):** Spray **Manganese Sulphate** (30.5% Mn) at 0.5% (5 g/L) solution.
    *   **Nitrogen (N) Deficiency (general yellowing of older leaves):** Apply **Urea** (46% N) as a soil application or foliar spray at 1-2% (10-20 g/L) solution for quick uptake.
    *   **Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency (interveinal chlorosis on older leaves):** Spray **Magnesium Sulphate** (9.6% Mg) at 0.5-1% (5-10 g/L) solution.
*   **Drainage:** Ensure good soil drainage to prevent root damage and nutrient uptake issues.

#### 3. Excessive Height

Excessive height and vigorous vegetative growth often come at the expense of fruit production and can make management difficult.

*   **Pruning:** This is the primary method for managing vine vigor and height.
    *   **Winter Pruning (dormant season):** Remove dead, diseased, weak, and crossing branches. Head back vigorous leaders to maintain the desired height and shape of the canopy. Remove excess vegetative growth to open up the canopy for better light penetration and air circulation.
    *   **Summer Pruning (during growing season):** Pinch back or prune vigorous shoots to encourage lateral branching and fruit bud formation. This helps manage canopy density and directs energy towards fruit development rather than excessive height.
*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Reduce Nitrogen:** If excessive vegetative growth is observed, reduce the application of nitrogen fertilizers (**Urea**).
    *   **Balanced NPK:** Ensure a balanced supply of Phosphorus and Potassium relative to Nitrogen, as these nutrients promote flowering and fruiting over vegetative growth.
*   **Training System:** Ensure the vines are properly trained on a strong trellis system (T-bar or pergola) to manage their spread horizontally rather than vertically.

#### 4. Excessive Flowering

Excessive flowering is generally a desirable trait for fruit crops like Kiwi. However, if it leads to an overly heavy fruit load that results in small fruit size or poor quality due to competition, the management strategy is **fruit thinning**, not flower thinning.

*   **Fruit Thinning:**
    *   **Manual Thinning:** After fruit set, typically 3-4 weeks after flowering, manually remove excess fruits.
    *   **Target:** Aim for 4-6 well-spaced fruits per fruiting shoot. This practice ensures that the remaining fruits grow larger and achieve better quality.
*   **Pollination:** Ensure adequate pollination by having the correct ratio of male to female plants (typically 1 male plant for every 5-8 female plants) and promoting pollinator activity (e.g., honeybees).
*   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure adequate nutrition, especially Potassium and Phosphorus, to support the development of a large fruit load. If excessive flowering is followed by poor fruit set or fruit drop, it might indicate nutrient stress or inadequate pollination.

**Important Note:** Always consult with local agricultural experts or HAU specialists for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and the specific Kiwi variety you are cultivating.
