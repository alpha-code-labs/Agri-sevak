Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I understand the importance of effective weed management for optimal growth and yield in Kiwi Fruit orchards. Weeds compete for water, nutrients, and light, especially critical during the establishment phase of the vines. An integrated approach combining cultural, mechanical, and chemical methods is recommended.

Here's a scientifically verified approach to control the specified weeds in Kiwi Fruit:

**General Weed Management Principles for Kiwi Orchards:**

*   **Mulching:** Apply organic mulches (e.g., straw, wood chips, dried leaves) around the base of the vines. This suppresses weed growth, conserves soil moisture, and moderates soil temperature.
*   **Manual Weeding:** Especially crucial for young plants and for removing stubborn weeds like Amarbail.
*   **Inter-row Cultivation:** Shallow cultivation between rows can control weeds, but avoid deep tillage that might damage shallow roots of Kiwi vines.
*   **Herbicide Application:** Use herbicides judiciously and with extreme care to prevent drift onto the Kiwi vines, especially non-selective ones. Always use a protective shield while spraying.

**Specific Weed Control Recommendations:**

1.  **Broadleaf Weeds (e.g., Bathu, Congress grass):**
    *   **Pre-emergence (before weed emergence):**
        *   Apply **Pendimethalin 30% EC** at 3.3 litres per acre or **Pendimethalin 38.7% CS** at 2.6 litres per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water, within 3 days of planting or after light irrigation in established orchards.
        *   Alternatively, **Oxyfluorfen 23.5% EC** can be applied at 0.85-1.7 litres per acre in 200-300 litres of water as a pre-emergence spray.
    *   **Post-emergence (after weed emergence, for inter-row weeds):**
        *   For general broadleaf and narrowleaf weed control in inter-row spaces, use **Glyphosate 41% SL** at 2.5-3.75 litres per acre (or 10-15 ml per litre of water for spot application) mixed in 200-400 litres of water. Apply carefully, avoiding contact with Kiwi vines.
        *   Alternatively, **Paraquat dichloride 24% SL** can be used at 2.0-4.0 litres per acre (or 8-16 ml per litre of water for spot application) mixed in 200-400 litres of water. This is a contact herbicide, effective on young weeds, but requires extreme caution to prevent drift onto Kiwi vines.

2.  **Narrowleaf Weeds (Grasses, e.g., Phalaris minor):**
    *   **Pre-emergence:**
        *   **Pendimethalin** (as mentioned above) provides good control of germinating grasses.
    *   **Post-emergence (selective grass control):**
        *   For selective control of grasses without harming broadleaf crops like Kiwi (when applied carefully), you can use:
            *   **Quizalofop-ethyl 5% EC** at 1.0-2.0 litres per acre in 200-300 litres of water.
            *   **Fluazifop-P-butyl 13.4% EC** at 0.9-1.8 litres per acre in 200-300 litres of water.
            *   **Sethoxydim 18% EC** at 1.1-1.6 litres per acre in 200-300 litres of water.
        *   These selective graminicides should be applied when grasses are actively growing and at a young stage.

3.  **Amarbail (Cuscuta spp. - Dodder):**
    *   Amarbail is a parasitic weed and is very challenging to control once it has attached to the host.
    *   **Prevention is key:**
        *   Use clean planting material and ensure the orchard area is free from Amarbail before planting.
        *   Regularly inspect the orchard and immediately remove any Amarbail strands manually before they spread or produce seeds.
        *   Destroy infested weeds or host plants outside the orchard perimeter.
    *   **Chemical Control (limited efficacy):**
        *   Pre-emergence application of **Pendimethalin** (as mentioned above) may help reduce the germination of Amarbail seeds.
        *   For established Amarbail, spot application of **Glyphosate 41% SL** (10-15 ml per litre of water) or **Paraquat dichloride 24% SL** (8-16 ml per litre of water) can be used, but extreme care must be taken to avoid contact with the Kiwi vines, as these are non-selective and will damage the crop. Manual removal remains the most effective method.

4.  **Orobanche (Broomrape):**
    *   This is not known to affect Kiwi Fruit.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the herbicide label carefully, including dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest intervals.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Calibrate your sprayer regularly to ensure accurate application rates.
*   Avoid spraying herbicides on windy days to minimize drift.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension officers for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and the latest CIBRC approvals.
