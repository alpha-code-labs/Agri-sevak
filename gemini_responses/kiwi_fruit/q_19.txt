As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm that macro-nutrient deficiencies (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium) are common issues that can significantly impact the growth, yield, and quality of Kiwi Fruit (Actinidia deliciosa). Addressing these deficiencies requires a scientific approach based on soil testing and plant symptomology.

Here's how to address these macro-nutrient deficiencies in Kiwi Fruit:

**General Principles:**
*   **Soil Testing:** The most crucial step is to conduct a comprehensive soil test before planting and periodically thereafter (every 2-3 years). This provides precise information on existing nutrient levels and pH, allowing for tailored fertilizer recommendations.
*   **Visual Diagnosis:** Observe the plants for characteristic deficiency symptoms, but always confirm with soil and/or leaf tissue analysis.
*   **Balanced Fertilization:** Aim for a balanced nutrient supply rather than over-applying a single nutrient, which can lead to other imbalances.

### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   General yellowing (chlorosis) of older leaves, starting from the tips and margins, progressing inwards.
*   Stunted growth, reduced shoot length, and smaller leaves.
*   Poor fruit set and reduced fruit size.

**Correction Measures:**
*   **Soil Application (Basal/Top-dressing):**
    *   Apply **Urea** (46% N) at 100-200 kg/acre, split into 2-3 applications during the growing season (e.g., pre-bloom, post-fruit set).
    *   Alternatively, **Ammonium Sulfate** (20.5% N) at 200-400 kg/acre, split into multiple applications. This is also beneficial if sulfur is deficient.
    *   For young plants or in alkaline soils, **Calcium Nitrate** (15.5% N) at 50-100 kg/acre can be used, providing calcium simultaneously.
*   **Foliar Application (for quick correction):**
    *   Spray 1-2% solution of **Urea** (10-20 g/L of water) during active growth, avoiding flowering period to prevent scorching. Repeat every 10-15 days until symptoms subside.
    *   Ensure good coverage of foliage.

### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   Dark green or purplish discoloration of older leaves, especially on the underside.
*   Stunted growth, poor root development, and delayed maturity.
*   Reduced flowering and fruit set.
*   Leaves may appear stiff and brittle.

**Correction Measures:**
*   **Soil Application (Basal):** Phosphorus is relatively immobile in soil, so it's best applied before planting or as a basal dose.
    *   Apply **Single Superphosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5) at 300-600 kg/acre. SSP also provides sulfur and calcium.
    *   Alternatively, **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5) at 100-200 kg/acre. If using DAP, adjust nitrogen application accordingly.
    *   Incorporate the fertilizer into the root zone for better availability.
*   **Foliar Application (for quick correction, less effective for P):**
    *   While soil application is preferred, a foliar spray of **Monoammonium Phosphate (MAP)** (12% N, 61% P2O5) at 5-10 g/L of water can be used for temporary relief, especially during critical growth stages like flowering.

### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   Yellowing and browning (scorching or necrosis) of leaf margins and tips, typically on older leaves.
*   Leaves may appear crinkled or curled.
*   Poor fruit development, reduced fruit size, poor color, and lower sugar content.
*   Increased susceptibility to diseases and environmental stress.

**Correction Measures:**
*   **Soil Application (Basal/Top-dressing):**
    *   Apply **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** (60% K2O) at 100-200 kg/acre, split into 2-3 applications during the growing season.
    *   Alternatively, **Sulfate of Potash (SOP)** (50% K2O, 17% S) at 120-240 kg/acre. SOP is preferred in soils where chloride sensitivity is a concern or sulfur is also deficient.
*   **Foliar Application (for quick correction):**
    *   Spray 1-2% solution of **Sulfate of Potash** (10-20 g/L of water) during active growth, especially before flowering and during fruit development. Repeat every 10-15 days.

**Important Considerations for Haryana:**
*   **Soil pH:** Kiwi fruit prefers slightly acidic to neutral soils (pH 5.5-7.0). High pH soils common in parts of Haryana can reduce the availability of phosphorus and some micronutrients. Adjusting pH with organic matter or sulfur may be necessary.
*   **Organic Matter:** Incorporating well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost (20-30 kg/plant annually) significantly improves soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability, reducing the reliance on synthetic fertilizers.
*   **Water Management:** Efficient irrigation is crucial for nutrient uptake. Both water stress and waterlogging can hinder nutrient absorption.

Always consult with local agricultural extension services or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's soil test results and local conditions.
