As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Kiwi Fruit, keeping in mind the conditions in Haryana:

**1. Borers:**
Borers, such as stem borers or bark-eating caterpillars (e.g., *Indarbela* species), can occasionally affect a wide range of fruit trees, including kiwi, particularly young or stressed plants.
*   **Cultural Control:** Regularly inspect plants for bore holes or frass (excrement). Prune and destroy affected branches if the infestation is localized.
*   **Chemical Control (Spot Treatment/Swabbing):**
    *   For visible bore holes, inject a solution of **Chlorpyriphos** 20% EC at 2.5 ml per litre of water into the holes using a syringe, then plug with mud.
    *   Alternatively, swab the affected trunk/branches with a solution of **Chlorpyriphos** 20% EC at 2.5 ml per litre of water.

**2. Caterpillars (Leaf-eating):**
Various species of leaf-eating caterpillars can infest kiwi plants, causing defoliation.
*   **Cultural Control:** Hand-picking of caterpillars can be effective in small orchards. Encourage natural enemies like parasitic wasps and predatory birds.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC at 0.3 ml per litre of water (or 60 ml per acre).
    *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG at 0.2-0.4 g per litre of water (or 80-100 g per acre).
    *   **Indoxacarb** 14.5% SC at 0.5 ml per litre of water (or 200 ml per acre).
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 0.5-1 ml per litre of water (or 200-250 ml per acre).

**3. Diamondback Moth:**
This is not known to affect Kiwi Fruit. Diamondback moth (*Plutella xylostella*) is a specific pest of cruciferous crops (Brassicaceae family) and does not infest kiwi.

**4. Leaf folder:**
Leaf folders can cause damage by folding leaves and feeding within the protected fold, leading to reduced photosynthetic area.
*   **Cultural Control:** Remove and destroy folded leaves containing larvae to reduce pest population.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC at 0.3 ml per litre of water (or 60 ml per acre).
    *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG at 0.2-0.4 g per litre of water (or 80-100 g per acre).
    *   **Indoxacarb** 14.5% SC at 0.5 ml per litre of water (or 200 ml per acre).
    *   **Quinalphos** 25% EC at 2 ml per litre of water.

**General Advice:**
*   Always ensure thorough coverage of the plant during spraying.
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pest resistance.
*   Strictly observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) for each chemical to ensure fruit safety.
*   For specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions, it is advisable to consult with local agricultural extension services.
