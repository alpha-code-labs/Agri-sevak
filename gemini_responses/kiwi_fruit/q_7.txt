As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Dieback, Twig blight, and Tikka disease in Kiwi Fruit, keeping in mind the context of Haryana, India, and CIBRC approved chemicals.

### Control of Dieback and Twig Blight in Kiwi Fruit

Dieback and Twig blight are common fungal diseases that can affect Kiwi Fruit, often caused by various pathogens such as *Botryosphaeria* species, *Phomopsis* species, or *Botrytis cinerea*. These diseases typically manifest as browning and death of twigs, branches, or even entire sections of the plant.

**1. Cultural and Management Practices:**
*   **Pruning:** Regularly inspect plants and promptly prune out all affected twigs and branches. Make cuts well into healthy wood, ensuring no diseased tissue remains.
*   **Sanitation:** Collect and destroy all pruned diseased material by burning or deep burial to prevent the spread of spores.
*   **Wound Protection:** After pruning, especially for larger cuts, apply a fungicidal paste (e.g., Bordeaux paste or a paste made with a recommended fungicide) to protect the wounds from pathogen entry.
*   **Plant Vigor:** Ensure proper plant nutrition and irrigation to maintain plant vigor, as stressed plants are more susceptible to diseases. Avoid waterlogging.
*   **Air Circulation:** Maintain good air circulation within the canopy through proper training and pruning to reduce humidity, which favors fungal growth.

**2. Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
For effective control, a combination of cultural practices and timely application of CIBRC approved fungicides is recommended. Apply fungicides preventively during susceptible stages or at the first sign of disease.

*   **For Dieback and Twig Blight:**
    *   Spray with **Copper oxychloride 50% WP** at a concentration of 2.5-3.0 g/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, spray with **Mancozeb 75% WP** at a concentration of 2.0-2.5 g/L of water.
    *   For systemic action, especially if the disease is progressing, consider spraying with **Carbendazim 50% WP** at a concentration of 0.5-1.0 g/L of water.
    *   Repeat applications at 10-15 day intervals, depending on disease severity and weather conditions, rotating fungicides to prevent resistance development.

### Tikka Disease in Kiwi Fruit

This is not known to affect Kiwi Fruit. Tikka disease is a specific common name primarily associated with leaf spot diseases of Groundnut (Peanut), caused by *Cercospora arachidicola* and *Phaeoisariopsis personata*. These pathogens do not infect Kiwi Fruit.
