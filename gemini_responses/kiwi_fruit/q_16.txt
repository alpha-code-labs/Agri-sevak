As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified fertilizer doses for Kiwi Fruit cultivation in Haryana. It is crucial to understand that these are general recommendations, and a **soil test report** is the most accurate basis for determining precise fertilizer requirements for your specific orchard.

**General Principles of Fertilization for Kiwi Fruit:**
1.  **Soil Testing:** Always conduct a soil test before planting and every 2-3 years thereafter to determine nutrient status and pH.
2.  **Split Application:** Fertilizers, especially Nitrogen and Potassium, should be applied in split doses to ensure continuous nutrient availability and minimize losses.
3.  **Timing:** Apply fertilizers when the plant is actively growing and requires nutrients the most.
4.  **Method:** Fertilizers should be broadcast evenly around the base of the plant within the drip line and lightly incorporated into the soil, followed by irrigation. Foliar applications are supplementary.

**1. Fertilizer Recommendations for Non-Bearing Kiwi Plants (1-2 years old):**
The aim during this stage is to promote vigorous vegetative growth and establish a strong root system.

*   **Year 1 (per plant):**
    *   Nitrogen (N): 50-75 g
    *   Phosphorus (P2O5): 25-30 g
    *   Potassium (K2O): 30-40 g
    *   Sulphur (S): 5-10 g
    *   **Application:** Apply N and K in 3-4 split doses from March to August. Apply P and S as a single basal dose in March.

*   **Year 2 (per plant):**
    *   Nitrogen (N): 75-100 g
    *   Phosphorus (P2O5): 30-40 g
    *   Potassium (K2O): 40-50 g
    *   Sulphur (S): 10-15 g
    *   **Application:** Apply N and K in 3-4 split doses from March to August. Apply P and S as a single basal dose in March.

**2. Fertilizer Recommendations for Bearing Kiwi Plants (3 years and older):**
The nutrient requirements increase significantly for fruit production. Doses are typically given per acre.

*   **Nutrient Targets (per acre):**
    *   Nitrogen (N): 100-150 kg
    *   Phosphorus (P2O5): 50-75 kg
    *   Potassium (K2O): 120-180 kg
    *   Sulphur (S): 20-30 kg
    *   **Application:**
        *   **Nitrogen:** Apply 50% at bud break (March), 25% after fruit set (May-June), and 25% after harvest (October-November).
        *   **Phosphorus & Sulphur:** Apply 100% as a basal dose in March.
        *   **Potassium:** Apply 50% at bud break (March) and 50% during fruit development (June-July).

**Recommended Doses of Specific Fertilizers:**

Based on the nutrient targets for **Bearing Plants (per acre)**, here are the approximate doses of commonly available fertilizers:

*   **Urea** (46% N):
    *   To meet the N requirement (after accounting for N from DAP): 200-300 kg/acre.
    *   *Example:* If 150 kg N is required and 25 kg N comes from DAP, then 125 kg N needs to be supplied by Urea. (125 kg N / 0.46) = 272 kg **Urea**/acre.

*   **DAP** (Di-Ammonium Phosphate, 18% N, 46% P2O5):
    *   To meet the P2O5 requirement: 110-165 kg/acre.
    *   *Note:* This will also supply 20-30 kg N/acre. Adjust **Urea** dose accordingly.

*   **SSP** (Single Super Phosphate, 16% P2O5, 11% S):
    *   If using SSP instead of DAP for Phosphorus: 310-470 kg/acre.
    *   *Note:* This will also supply 34-52 kg S/acre, significantly contributing to the Sulphur requirement.

*   **Muriate of Potash (Potash)** (60% K2O):
    *   To meet the K2O requirement: 200-300 kg/acre.

*   **Sulphur** (Elemental Sulphur, 90% S):
    *   If not adequately supplied by SSP: 22-33 kg/acre.
    *   *Note:* If using SSP, the additional **Sulphur** requirement will be minimal or none.

*   **NPK** (Complex Fertilizers, e.g., 10:26:26, 12:32:16, 15:15:15):
    *   While specific NPK ratios can be used, it is often challenging to precisely meet the high K and N requirements of Kiwi fruit with a single NPK blend.
    *   If using a balanced **NPK** fertilizer (e.g., 15:15:15), it can be applied as a basal dose at 300-500 kg/acre, and then supplemented with additional **Urea** and **Muriate of Potash** to meet the remaining N and K requirements.

*   **Nano-Urea** (Liquid, 4% N):
    *   **Application:** Foliar spray at 2-4 ml/L of water.
    *   **Timing:** 2-3 sprays during active vegetative growth and fruit development stages (e.g., 30-45 days after bud break, and again during fruit enlargement).
    *   *Note:* **Nano-Urea** is a supplementary source of Nitrogen and does not replace basal soil application of conventional Urea.

*   **Nano-DAP** (Liquid, 8% N, 16% P2O5):
    *   **Application:** Foliar spray at 2-4 ml/L of water.
    *   **Timing:** 2 sprays, one at pre-flowering stage and another at fruit set stage.
    *   *Note:* **Nano-DAP** is a supplementary source of N and P and does not replace basal soil application of conventional DAP or SSP.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Micronutrients:** Kiwi fruit also requires micronutrients like Boron, Zinc, Manganese, and Iron. If soil tests indicate deficiencies, apply appropriate micronutrient formulations as per recommendations.
*   **Organic Matter:** Incorporating farmyard manure (FYM) or compost (20-30 tonnes/acre annually for bearing plants) significantly improves soil health, nutrient retention, and microbial activity, enhancing fertilizer efficiency.
*   **Irrigation:** Ensure adequate and timely irrigation, especially after fertilizer application, to facilitate nutrient uptake.

Always consult with HAU experts or your local agricultural extension officer for tailored advice based on your specific farm conditions and soil test results.
