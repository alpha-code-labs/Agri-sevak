As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I must provide scientifically verified advice specific to crop-pest interactions. Based on current entomological and horticultural knowledge regarding Kiwi Fruit (Actinidia deliciosa) cultivation:

*   **Grasshopper:** This is not known to affect Kiwi Fruit as a significant pest requiring specific control measures.
*   **Painted Bug (Bagrada hilaris):** This is not known to affect Kiwi Fruit. It is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops.
*   **Red Cotton Bug (Dysdercus cingulatus):** This is not known to affect Kiwi Fruit. It is primarily a pest of cotton and other malvaceous plants.
*   **Black Ants:** This is not known to affect Kiwi Fruit as a direct primary pest causing significant damage to the plant or fruit. Ants are often associated with other sap-sucking insects (e.g., aphids, mealybugs) for their honeydew, which *can* affect Kiwi Fruit, but black ants themselves are not a direct pest of concern for Kiwi Fruit.
