Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding the "Drying up" symptoms in Kiwi Fruit (drying branches, leaves, fruits, and flowers). This is a general symptom that can be indicative of various underlying issues, both abiotic (environmental) and biotic (pests and diseases). A precise diagnosis is crucial before implementing any management strategy.

Here's a systematic approach to address this problem:

**I. Initial Assessment and Diagnosis:**

Before applying any treatment, it is essential to identify the root cause. Observe the following:

*   **Pattern of Drying:** Is it affecting the entire plant, specific branches, only young growth, or older parts? Is it sudden or gradual?
*   **Location:** Is it starting from the tips, margins, or base of the plant?
*   **Associated Symptoms:** Look for any spots, lesions, cankers, exudates (gumming), discolouration, or presence of pests on leaves, stems, or roots.
*   **Root Health:** Carefully inspect the roots for any signs of rot, discolouration, or damage.
*   **Environmental Factors:** Consider recent weather patterns (extreme heat, cold, strong winds), irrigation practices (under or over-watering), soil conditions (drainage, salinity), and fertilization history.

**II. Potential Causes and Management Strategies:**

Based on common issues in fruit crops and specific knowledge about Kiwi, here are the potential causes and recommended actions:

**A. Abiotic Factors (Environmental/Physiological Stress):**

1.  **Water Stress:**
    *   **Under-watering:** Insufficient moisture can lead to wilting and drying, especially during hot, dry periods.
    *   **Over-watering/Poor Drainage:** Waterlogging deprives roots of oxygen, leading to root suffocation and rot, which manifests as wilting and drying of aerial parts.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Ensure consistent and adequate irrigation, especially during fruit development and hot weather. Kiwi requires regular moisture.
        *   Improve soil drainage by incorporating organic matter or creating raised beds if the soil is heavy clay.
        *   Check soil moisture regularly before irrigating.

2.  **Nutrient Deficiencies/Imbalances:**
    *   Deficiencies of certain nutrients (e.g., Potassium, Calcium, Boron) can cause marginal leaf scorch, dieback, or poor fruit development leading to drying.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Conduct a soil test and leaf tissue analysis to identify specific deficiencies.
        *   Apply balanced fertilizers based on test results. Foliar sprays can provide quick relief for some micronutrient deficiencies.

3.  **Heat Stress/Sunburn:**
    *   Extreme high temperatures, especially combined with low humidity, can cause leaf scorch and drying of exposed branches and fruits.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Provide adequate shade during peak summer hours, especially for young plants.
        *   Maintain good canopy cover to protect fruits and branches.
        *   Ensure sufficient irrigation to help plants cope with heat.

4.  **Frost Damage:**
    *   Kiwi is sensitive to frost, which can damage young shoots, leaves, and flowers, leading to blackening and drying.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Implement frost protection measures during cold spells (e.g., overhead irrigation, covering young plants, smudging).
        *   Site selection is crucial to avoid frost pockets.

5.  **Wind Burn:**
    *   Strong, dry winds can desiccate leaves and shoots, causing them to dry out.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Establish windbreaks around the orchard.
        *   Ensure adequate irrigation to help plants withstand wind stress.

6.  **Salinity:**
    *   High salt concentration in soil or irrigation water can cause osmotic stress, leading to leaf tip burn and overall drying.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Use good quality irrigation water.
        *   Improve drainage to leach salts from the root zone.
        *   Apply gypsum (Calcium sulphate) if soil sodicity is an issue.

**B. Biotic Factors (Pests and Diseases):**

1.  **Fungal Root Rots (e.g., *Phytophthora* spp., *Fusarium* spp.):**
    *   These pathogens attack the roots, impairing water and nutrient uptake, leading to wilting, yellowing, and eventual drying of the entire plant or specific branches. Often associated with poor drainage.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Improve drainage.
        *   Remove severely affected plants.
        *   For early stages, apply fungicides as a drench:
            *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride** @ 2-3 ml/L of water (as soil drench).
            *   **Fosetyl-aluminium** @ 2.5 g/L of water (as soil drench or foliar spray).
            *   **Metalaxyl-M** @ 1 g/L of water (as soil drench).

2.  **Cankers and Dieback (e.g., *Botryosphaeria* spp., *Phomopsis* spp.):**
    *   These fungal diseases cause sunken lesions (cankers) on branches and stems, leading to girdling and dieback of the affected parts, which then dry up.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Prune out affected branches well below the canker into healthy wood. Sterilize pruning tools between cuts.
        *   Apply a protective fungicidal paste or spray after pruning:
            *   **Copper oxychloride** @ 3 g/L of water (as spray, or mixed with water to form a paste for cankers).

3.  **Bacterial Blight/Canker (*Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae* - PSA):**
    *   This is a serious bacterial disease of Kiwi, causing cankers, shoot dieback, leaf spots, and wilting/drying of branches. Look for reddish-brown exudates from cankers.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Prune out infected parts during dry weather.
        *   Apply preventive copper-based sprays, especially before and after pruning, and during periods conducive to infection.
            *   **Copper oxychloride** @ 3 g/L of water.
        *   In severe cases, **Streptomycin sulphate** (if approved for Kiwi and effective against the specific strain) may be considered, but its use should be judicious to prevent resistance.

4.  **Pest Infestations (e.g., Mites, Scale Insects, Mealybugs):**
    *   Severe infestations of sap-sucking pests can weaken the plant significantly, leading to desiccation, yellowing, and drying of leaves and shoots.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Monitor plants regularly for pest presence.
        *   For mites:
            *   **Spiromesifen** @ 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   For scale insects and mealybugs:
            *   **Buprofezin** @ 1.25 ml/L of water.
            *   **Imidacloprid** @ 0.3 ml/L of water.

**III. General Recommendations:**

*   **Orchard Hygiene:** Remove and destroy all dried and diseased plant parts to reduce inoculum.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure the plant receives adequate and balanced nutrients to maintain vigor and resistance.
*   **Proper Pruning:** Prune correctly to maintain good air circulation and light penetration, reducing humidity and disease incidence.
*   **Stress Reduction:** Minimize all forms of stress (water, nutrient, temperature) to keep plants healthy and resilient.

**IV. Crucial Advice:**

Given the complexity of diagnosing "Drying up" symptoms, I strongly recommend collecting samples (affected branches, leaves, roots) and contacting the plant pathology or horticulture department at HAU, Hisar, or your nearest Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) for a definitive diagnosis and specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions. A field visit by an expert would be most beneficial.
