As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I advise that addressing micronutrient deficiencies in Bengal Gram (Chickpea) is crucial for optimal yield and plant health, especially given the soil conditions prevalent in Haryana.

**General Recommendations:**

1.  **Soil Testing:** The most critical first step is to conduct a comprehensive soil test. This will accurately identify which micronutrients are deficient and to what extent, allowing for precise and economical application.
2.  **Foliar vs. Soil Application:** For micronutrients, foliar application is often preferred for quick correction of visible symptoms, as it ensures direct uptake by leaves. Soil application is suitable for prophylactic measures or for persistent deficiencies identified through soil tests.
3.  **Timing:** Apply micronutrients at critical growth stages (e.g., branching, pre-flowering, pod development) or upon the appearance of deficiency symptoms.
4.  **Water Quality & Spreader:** Always use good quality water for spraying. Adding a non-ionic spreader/sticker (adjuvant) at recommended rates (e.g., 0.5-1.0 ml/L) improves spray coverage and absorption.

Here's how to address specific micronutrient deficiencies in Bengal Gram:

---

### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

Zinc deficiency is a common issue in Bengal Gram in Haryana, particularly in alkaline and calcareous soils.

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, small and narrow leaves, interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, and sometimes bronzing of older leaves.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Soil Application (Prophylactic/Severe Deficiency):**
        *   Apply **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** (21% Zn) at 25 kg/acre, or **Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate** (33% Zn) at 15 kg/acre, broadcast and incorporated into the soil before sowing.
    *   **Foliar Application (Corrective):**
        *   Spray a 0.5% solution of **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** (5 g/L of water) or a 0.25% solution of **Chelated Zinc (Zinc EDTA)** (2.5 g/L of water).
        *   Apply at the branching stage and again at the pre-flowering stage if symptoms persist.

### 2. Iron (Fe) / Ferrous Deficiency

Iron chlorosis is a significant problem for Bengal Gram, especially in the high pH (alkaline) and calcareous soils of Haryana, which reduce iron availability.

*   **Symptoms:** Prominent yellowing of young leaves (interveinal chlorosis), with veins remaining green. In severe cases, leaves can turn completely white or bleached, leading to necrosis.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Foliar Application (Highly Recommended for Correction):**
        *   Spray a 0.5-1.0% solution of **Ferrous Sulphate Heptahydrate** (5-10 g/L of water) or a 0.25% solution of **Chelated Iron (Ferrous EDTA)** (2.5 g/L of water).
        *   Start spraying upon the appearance of symptoms and repeat at 10-15 day intervals, 2-3 times, until the plants recover.
    *   **Soil Application (Less Effective in Alkaline Soils for Immediate Correction):**
        *   In severely deficient areas, **Ferrous Sulphate Heptahydrate** can be applied at 25-50 kg/acre before sowing, but foliar sprays are generally more effective for immediate relief in alkaline conditions.

### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

Boron deficiency can affect Bengal Gram, impacting flowering and pod development, though it is less common than Zinc or Iron deficiency in Haryana.

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, short internodes, thickening and brittleness of leaves, poor flowering, reduced pod set, and sometimes hollow stems.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Soil Application (Prophylactic in Known Deficient Areas):**
        *   Apply **Borax (Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate)** at 2-4 kg/acre or **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** at 1-2 kg/acre, broadcast and incorporated before sowing.
    *   **Foliar Application (Corrective):**
        *   Spray a 0.1-0.2% solution of **Borax** (1-2 g/L of water) or a 0.1% solution of **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (1 g/L of water).
        *   Apply at the pre-flowering stage and again at the early pod development stage.

### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

Calcium deficiency is not widely prevalent in Bengal Gram in Haryana due to the generally calcareous nature of the soils. However, it can occur in specific soil types or under certain conditions.

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, chlorosis of young leaves, necrosis of growing points, and poor root development.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Soil Application (If Soil Test Confirms):**
        *   If soil test indicates severe deficiency, especially in acidic soils, **Gypsum (Calcium Sulphate Dihydrate)** can be applied at 200-400 kg/acre. This is also beneficial for reclaiming sodic soils.
    *   **Foliar Application (Corrective):**
        *   Spray a 0.5-1.0% solution of **Calcium Nitrate** (5-10 g/L of water) or **Calcium Chloride** (5-10 g/L of water) at critical growth stages if symptoms appear.

### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

Magnesium deficiency can affect Bengal Gram, particularly in sandy soils or where there is an imbalance with other nutrients like potassium.

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis of older leaves, where the veins remain green while the tissue between them turns yellow. Leaves may become brittle and sometimes develop a reddish-purple tint.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Soil Application (Prophylactic/Severe Deficiency):**
        *   Apply **Magnesium Sulphate Heptahydrate** at 10-20 kg/acre at the time of sowing in known deficient soils.
    *   **Foliar Application (Corrective):**
        *   Spray a 0.5-1.0% solution of **Magnesium Sulphate Heptahydrate** (5-10 g/L of water).
        *   Apply upon symptom appearance and repeat at 15-day intervals, 2-3 times, if necessary.

### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

Manganese deficiency can affect Bengal Gram, especially in alkaline soils with high organic matter content, which can reduce manganese availability.

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis of young leaves, often appearing as a "netting" pattern. Stunted growth may also be observed.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Foliar Application (Highly Recommended for Correction):**
        *   Spray a 0.5% solution of **Manganese Sulphate Monohydrate** (5 g/L of water).
        *   Apply upon symptom appearance and repeat at 10-15 day intervals, 2-3 times, until the plants recover.
    *   **Soil Application (Less Effective in Alkaline Soils):**
        *   In severely deficient areas, **Manganese Sulphate Monohydrate** can be applied at 10-20 kg/acre before sowing, but foliar application is generally more efficient for immediate correction in alkaline conditions.
