As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling various rot types in Bengal Gram (Chickpea) relevant to Haryana conditions.

Bengal Gram is susceptible to several soil-borne fungal diseases that manifest as various forms of rot, particularly during the seedling and vegetative stages. These diseases can lead to significant yield losses if not managed effectively.

Let's address the specific rot types you've mentioned:

*   **Root Rot, Stem Rot, Foot Rot, Collar Rot, Crown Rot, Neck Rot, Seed Rot, and Seedling Rot:** These are common and often interconnected diseases in Bengal Gram, primarily caused by soil-borne fungi such as *Rhizoctonia bataticola* (Macrophomina phaseolina), *Fusarium solani*, *Sclerotium rolfsii*, *Sclerotinia sclerotiorum*, and *Pythium* species. They cause rotting of seeds before emergence, damping-off of seedlings, and rotting of roots, collars, stems, and crowns of older plants, leading to wilting and plant death.

*   **Black Rot:** This is not known to affect Bengal Gram as a distinct disease entity. Discoloration might occur as a symptom of other rots or secondary infections, but "Black Rot" is not a primary disease name for chickpea.

*   **Fruit Rot:** This is not known to affect Bengal Gram. Bengal Gram produces pods, and while pod diseases can occur, "Fruit Rot" is not a standard term for chickpea diseases.

**Integrated Disease Management (IDM) for Rots in Bengal Gram:**

Effective control of these rot diseases requires an integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods.

**1. Cultural Practices:**

*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice a 2-3 year crop rotation with non-host crops like cereals (wheat, barley) to reduce the inoculum load in the soil.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris from the field to prevent pathogen carryover.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** Deep summer ploughing exposes fungal sclerotia and other inoculum to solar radiation, reducing their viability.
*   **Timely Sowing:** Sow Bengal Gram at the optimum time (typically mid-October to mid-November in Haryana) to avoid periods of high temperature and moisture stress that favor disease development.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure balanced fertilizer application. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can make plants more susceptible.
*   **Improved Drainage:** Ensure good field drainage to prevent waterlogging, which creates anaerobic conditions favorable for some root rot pathogens.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available, select and sow disease-resistant or tolerant varieties recommended for Haryana. Consult HAU for the latest recommendations.

**2. Biological Control:**

*   **Seed Treatment with Bio-agents:**
    *   Treat seeds with *Trichoderma viride* or *Trichoderma harzianum* at a rate of **4-5 g/kg seed**. This helps in suppressing soil-borne pathogens.
*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Mix *Trichoderma viride* or *Trichoderma harzianum* (2.5 kg) with 50 kg of farmyard manure (FYM) or compost, keep it moist for 7-10 days, and then broadcast it uniformly in one acre of field before sowing.

**3. Chemical Control:**

**A. Seed Treatment (Crucial for Seed, Seedling, and early-stage Root/Collar Rots):**

Seed treatment is the most effective and economical method to protect seeds and young seedlings from rot pathogens.

*   **Combination Fungicides:**
    *   **Carboxin** 37.5% + **Thiram** 37.5% DS: Apply at **2.5 g/kg seed**.
    *   **Fludioxonil** 2.5% + **Metalaxyl-M** 1.0% FS: Apply at **10 ml/kg seed**.
*   **Individual Fungicides (can be used in combination):**
    *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: Apply at **1-2 g/kg seed**.
    *   **Thiram** 75% WS: Apply at **2-3 g/kg seed**. (Often used in combination with Carbendazim for broader spectrum control).
    *   **Metalaxyl-M** 31.8% ES: Apply at **3-4 ml/kg seed** (specifically effective against oomycetes like *Pythium*).

**B. Soil Application / Drenching (for localized outbreaks or severe conditions):**

*   **For Root/Collar Rot:**
    *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: Drench the soil around the affected plants with a solution of **1-2 g/L water**. For broader field application, mix **500 g/acre** with 50 kg of sand and broadcast evenly before irrigation.
    *   **Validamycin** 3% L: Drench the soil around affected plants with a solution of **2-3 ml/L water**.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the fungicide label for safe and effective use.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and the prevailing disease pressure.
