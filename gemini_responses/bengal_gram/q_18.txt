As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding Growth Regulators/Hormones for Bengal Gram (Chickpea) in Haryana:

*   **Ethephon**:
    This growth regulator is not typically recommended for yield enhancement or flower retention in Bengal Gram in Haryana. While it can influence plant growth, its application for increasing Bengal Gram yield is not a standard, recommended practice by HAU.

*   **2,4-D**:
    This chemical is primarily a selective herbicide and is not recommended as a growth regulator for beneficial purposes (e.g., increasing yield or flower retention) in Bengal Gram. Its application as a growth regulator can be phytotoxic and is not a standard practice.

*   **Boron (as a micronutrient)**:
    Boron is an essential micronutrient for Bengal Gram, crucial for flowering, pollen viability, pod setting, and seed development. Its application is recommended, especially in soils with known or suspected boron deficiency.
    *   **Recommended Chemical**: **Disodium tetraborate decahydrate** (commonly known as Borax).
    *   **Dose**: Foliar spray of 0.2% solution.
        *   Mix **2 g** of **Disodium tetraborate decahydrate** per liter of water.
        *   For an acre, typically use **400-500 g** of **Disodium tetraborate decahydrate** dissolved in **200-250 L** of water.
    *   **Timing**: Apply at the pre-flowering stage or early pod initiation stage. A second spray can be given 15-20 days after the first, if deficiency symptoms persist or if conditions warrant.
