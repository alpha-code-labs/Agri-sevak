As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following integrated weed management strategies for Bengal Gram (Chickpea) in Haryana, combining cultural practices with scientifically verified chemical control methods.

Effective weed control is crucial for maximizing Bengal Gram yields, as weeds compete for nutrients, water, and sunlight, especially during the critical initial 30-60 days after sowing.

**I. Cultural and Mechanical Weed Control (Foundation of Weed Management):**

1.  **Timely Sowing:** Sowing Bengal Gram at the optimal time (typically mid-October to mid-November in Haryana) allows the crop to establish well and compete better with weeds.
2.  **Clean Seed:** Use certified, weed-free seed to prevent the introduction of new weed species, especially parasitic weeds like Amarbail (Cuscuta).
3.  **Proper Seedbed Preparation:** A well-prepared, fine seedbed promotes uniform crop emergence, giving the crop a head start over weeds.
4.  **Crop Rotation:** Rotate Bengal Gram with non-leguminous crops (e.g., wheat, pearl millet) to break the life cycle of specific weeds.
5.  **Inter-cultivation/Hoeing:** One or two manual weedings or hoeings at 25-30 and 45-50 days after sowing (DAS) are highly effective, especially for broadleaf weeds like Bathu and Congress grass, and for removing Amarbail before it establishes. This is particularly important if herbicide application is missed or ineffective.

**II. Chemical Weed Control (Herbicides):**

Herbicides should be used judiciously and strictly according to recommended doses and timings. Always ensure uniform spray coverage with the correct nozzle (flat fan nozzle) and adequate water volume (200-300 litres per acre).

**A. Pre-emergence Herbicides (Applied after sowing but before crop and weed emergence):**

These herbicides form a chemical barrier on the soil surface, preventing weed germination. They are effective against a wide range of broadleaf and narrowleaf weeds.

*   **For Broadleaf Weeds (e.g., Bathu, Congress grass) and Narrowleaf Weeds (e.g., Phalaris minor):**
    *   Apply **Pendimethalin** 30% EC at 1.0 kg active ingredient per acre (equivalent to 3.3 litres of product per acre) or **Pendimethalin** 38.7% CS at 1.0 kg active ingredient per acre (equivalent to 1.0 litre of product per acre) within 3 days of sowing.
    *   Mix the recommended quantity in 200-300 litres of water and spray uniformly on the soil surface.
*   **For Amarbail (Cuscuta spp.):**
    *   **Pendimethalin** applied pre-emergence also provides significant suppression of Amarbail germination.

**B. Post-emergence Herbicides (Applied after crop and weed emergence):**

These herbicides are applied when weeds are actively growing, typically at the 2-4 leaf stage.

*   **For Broadleaf Weeds (e.g., Bathu, Congress grass) and some Narrowleaf Weeds, and Parasitic Weeds (e.g., Amarbail, Orobanche):**
    *   Apply **Imazethapyr** 10% SL at 75-100 g active ingredient per acre (equivalent to 300-400 ml of product per acre) at 20-30 days after sowing (DAS), when weeds are at the 2-4 leaf stage.
    *   **Imazethapyr** is particularly effective against a broad spectrum of broadleaf weeds and also provides control of Amarbail and suppression of Orobanche. For Orobanche, early application is crucial to target the parasite before it causes significant damage to the crop.
*   **For Narrowleaf Weeds (Grasses like Phalaris minor):**
    *   If grass weeds are a predominant problem, specific graminicides can be used at 20-30 DAS when grasses are at the 2-4 leaf stage:
        *   **Quizalofop-ethyl** 10% EC at 50 g active ingredient per acre (equivalent to 500 ml of product per acre).
        *   **Fenoxaprop-p-ethyl** 10% EC at 50 g active ingredient per acre (equivalent to 500 ml of product per acre).
        *   **Fluazifop-p-butyl** 25% EC at 250 g active ingredient per acre (equivalent to 1.0 litre of product per acre).
    *   These herbicides are highly effective against Phalaris minor and other grassy weeds without harming the Bengal Gram crop.

**Specific Considerations for Challenging Weeds:**

*   **Amarbail (Cuscuta spp.):**
    *   Prevention is paramount: use clean seed, avoid contaminated farmyard manure.
    *   Manual removal of initial patches before seed set is highly recommended.
    *   **Pendimethalin** (pre-emergence) and **Imazethapyr** (post-emergence) offer chemical control.
*   **Orobanche (Broomrape spp.):**
    *   While *Orobanche* is more commonly a severe problem in crops like mustard and lentil, some species can affect Bengal Gram.
    *   **Imazethapyr** (post-emergence) is the most effective chemical option for *Orobanche* control in Bengal Gram. Timely application is critical to target the parasite before it causes significant damage.
    *   Crop rotation with non-host crops (e.g., cereals) is an important long-term strategy.
*   **Congress grass (Parthenium hysterophorus):**
    *   Manual removal is very effective, especially before flowering.
    *   **Imazethapyr** (post-emergence) will provide control of young Parthenium plants.

**Important Advisory:**

*   Always read and follow the label instructions of the herbicide product carefully.
*   Use appropriate safety gear (gloves, mask, protective clothing) during handling and spraying.
*   Calibrate your sprayer to ensure accurate application rates.
*   Avoid spraying on windy days to prevent drift.
*   Consult your local Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or agricultural extension officer for the most precise and up-to-date recommendations specific to your field conditions and prevailing weed flora.
