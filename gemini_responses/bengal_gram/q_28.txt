Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the challenges posed by environmental stresses on Bengal Gram (Chickpea) cultivation in Haryana. Protecting your crop from extreme cold, frost, heat (Loo), and intense sunlight is crucial for ensuring a good yield. Here is scientifically verified advice to mitigate these stresses:

### 1. Protection from Extreme Cold and Frost:

Bengal Gram is particularly susceptible to frost damage, especially during its flowering and pod development stages.

*   **Timely Irrigation:** Apply a light irrigation (approximately 2.5-3.0 cm) in the evening before a predicted frost event. The water absorbs heat during the day and releases it slowly during the night, raising the ambient temperature around the plants and preventing the temperature from dropping below freezing point at the plant surface.
*   **Potassium Application:** Ensure adequate potassium nutrition, as it enhances cold tolerance.
    *   A foliar spray of **Potassium Nitrate** (1.0-2.0% solution, i.e., 10-20 g/L water) can be applied 10-15 days before the expected frost, and repeated if the cold wave persists.
*   **Sulfur Application:** Basal application of elemental **Sulfur** at 20 kg/acre can improve the plant's resilience to cold.
*   **Foliar Sprays for Tolerance:**
    *   **Thiourea:** Spraying **Thiourea** at 500 g/acre dissolved in 200 L water (2.5 g/L) during the vegetative stage and again at flowering can significantly enhance frost tolerance.
    *   **Salicylic Acid:** Foliar application of **Salicylic Acid** at 100 ppm (0.1 g/L) can also help in inducing cold tolerance.

### 2. Protection from Heat (Loo) and Intense Sunlight:

High temperatures, especially when accompanied by hot winds (Loo) and intense sunlight during flowering and pod filling, can lead to flower drop, poor pod set, and reduced grain filling in Bengal Gram.

*   **Timely Irrigation:** Provide light and timely irrigations, especially during the critical flowering and pod development stages, to maintain optimal soil moisture and help in reducing the canopy temperature. Avoid any water stress during these periods.
*   **Mulching:** Apply organic mulch (e.g., wheat straw, paddy straw) at 4-5 tonnes/acre between the rows. Mulching helps conserve soil moisture, reduces soil temperature, and suppresses weed growth, thereby reducing competition for water and nutrients.
*   **Foliar Sprays for Stress Mitigation:**
    *   **Potassium Nitrate:** Spray **Potassium Nitrate** (1.0-2.0% solution, i.e., 10-20 g/L water) at the pre-flowering and pod development stages. This helps in improving heat tolerance, water use efficiency, and pod setting.
    *   **Thiourea:** Foliar spray of **Thiourea** at 500 g/acre dissolved in 200 L water (2.5 g/L) during the vegetative and flowering stages can effectively mitigate heat stress.
    *   **Glycine Betaine:** Application of **Glycine Betaine** at 1000 ppm (1 g/L) as a foliar spray during peak heat stress periods acts as an osmoprotectant, helping the plant maintain cellular turgor and function.
    *   **Salicylic Acid:** Foliar application of **Salicylic Acid** at 100 ppm (0.1 g/L) can enhance the plant's natural defense mechanisms against heat and intense light stress.
    *   **Potassium Chloride:** A 0.5% solution of **Potassium Chloride** (5 g/L) can also be sprayed to improve water use efficiency and heat tolerance.

By adopting these practices, you can significantly reduce the adverse impact of environmental stresses on your Bengal Gram crop and secure a healthier, more productive harvest. Always ensure proper spray coverage for optimal results.
