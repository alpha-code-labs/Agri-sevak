Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I would like to provide scientifically verified advice regarding the control of viral diseases in Bengal Gram (Chickpea).

It is crucial to understand that direct chemical control for viral diseases is generally not possible once a plant is infected. The primary strategies focus on prevention, managing the vectors that transmit these viruses, and using resistant varieties.

Let's address the specific conditions you've mentioned:

*   **Tristeza:** This is primarily a viral disease affecting citrus crops. **This is not known to affect Bengal Gram.**
*   **Stripe:** "Stripe virus" is not a recognized specific viral disease of Bengal Gram. While some viruses might cause stripe-like symptoms, it's not a distinct pathogen for this crop. **This is not known to affect Bengal Gram as a specific viral disease.**

For the other viral diseases – **Leaf curl, Mosaic, Yellow vein clearing, and Stunt virus** – which are known to affect Bengal Gram (e.g., Chickpea stunt virus, various mosaic viruses, and other viruses causing yellowing or curling symptoms), the management strategies are as follows:

### Control Measures for Viral Diseases (Leaf curl, Mosaic, Yellow vein clearing, Stunt virus) in Bengal Gram:

1.  **Use of Resistant/Tolerant Varieties:**
    *   The most effective and sustainable method is to cultivate varieties that are known to be resistant or tolerant to common viral diseases prevalent in your region. Consult with HAU or local agricultural extension for recommended varieties suitable for Haryana.

2.  **Vector Management (Insect Control):**
    *   Viral diseases are primarily transmitted by insect vectors such as aphids, leafhoppers, and whiteflies. Controlling these vectors is critical to prevent the spread of the virus.
    *   **Seed Treatment:**
        *   Treating seeds with systemic insecticides provides early protection against sucking pests that transmit viruses.
        *   **Imidacloprid** 600 FS at 5-7 ml/kg seed
        *   **Thiamethoxam** 70 WS at 3-5 g/kg seed
    *   **Foliar Spray (if vector population is high):**
        *   Monitor fields regularly for the presence of sucking pests. If vector populations are building up, apply appropriate insecticides.
        *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8 SL at 0.25-0.5 ml/L of water
        *   **Thiamethoxam** 25 WG at 0.2-0.4 g/L of water
        *   **Acetamiprid** 20 SP at 0.2-0.4 g/L of water

3.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Timely Sowing:** Sowing at the recommended time can help plants escape peak vector populations or critical infection periods.
    *   **Roguing:** Regularly inspect your field and promptly remove and destroy (bury or burn) any plants showing symptoms of viral infection. This prevents the virus from spreading to healthy plants.
    *   **Weed Management:** Many weeds can act as alternate hosts for both the viruses and their insect vectors. Keep your fields and surrounding areas free of weeds.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops to break the disease cycle.
    *   **Field Hygiene:** Ensure proper field sanitation. Remove crop residues after harvest.

By adopting these integrated management practices, you can significantly reduce the incidence and spread of viral diseases in your Bengal Gram crop. For specific recommendations tailored to your local conditions, please contact your nearest Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or HAU extension specialist.
