As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I understand your concern regarding the potential harmful effects of weedicides/herbicides on Bengal Gram (Chickpea). While herbicides are crucial for effective weed management, their improper use can lead to crop injury and yield loss. Here's scientifically verified advice to minimize these harmful effects in Bengal Gram:

### Strategies to Reduce Harmful Effects of Weedicides/Herbicides in Bengal Gram

1.  **Correct Herbicide Selection:**
    *   Always choose herbicides specifically registered and recommended for Bengal Gram in Haryana. Using off-label herbicides can cause severe crop damage.
    *   **Pre-emergence Herbicides (applied before crop and weed emergence):** These are generally safer for the crop as they act on germinating weeds.
        *   **Pendimethalin** (30% EC): Effective against a wide range of annual grasses and broadleaf weeds.
        *   **Fluchloralin** (45% EC): Another option for pre-plant incorporation or pre-emergence application.
    *   **Post-emergence Herbicides (applied after crop and weed emergence):** These require more careful application to avoid crop injury.
        *   **Quizalofop-ethyl** (5% EC): Specifically for controlling grassy weeds.
        *   **Imazethapyr** (10% SL): Effective against both broadleaf and some grassy weeds. *Note: **Imazethapyr** can sometimes cause temporary yellowing or stunting in Bengal Gram, especially under stress conditions, but the crop usually recovers.*

2.  **Accurate Dosage:**
    *   Strictly adhere to the recommended dose mentioned on the herbicide label or by agricultural experts. Overdosing is a primary cause of phytotoxicity (crop injury).
    *   **Recommended Doses (Product Quantity per Acre):**
        *   **Pendimethalin** (30% EC): 1.0 - 1.3 Litres
        *   **Fluchloralin** (45% EC): 0.8 - 1.0 Litres
        *   **Quizalofop-ethyl** (5% EC): 1.0 Litre
        *   **Imazethapyr** (10% SL): 750 ml

3.  **Timely Application:**
    *   **Pre-emergence Herbicides:** Apply within 0-3 days after sowing, before the emergence of both the crop and weeds. Ensure adequate soil moisture for activation.
    *   **Post-emergence Herbicides:** Apply when weeds are young (2-4 leaf stage) and actively growing, typically 20-30 days after sowing for Bengal Gram. Applying too late reduces efficacy and may require higher doses, increasing the risk of crop damage. Applying too early might not cover all weed flushes.

4.  **Proper Application Technique:**
    *   **Sprayer Calibration:** Ensure your sprayer is correctly calibrated to deliver the recommended volume of spray solution uniformly across the field.
    *   **Nozzle Selection:** Use appropriate nozzles (e.g., flat-fan nozzles) for uniform coverage and to minimize drift.
    *   **Water Volume:** Use adequate water volume (e.g., 200-300 Litres per acre) for thorough coverage, especially for post-emergence herbicides. Insufficient water can lead to poor coverage and reduced efficacy, while excessive water can cause runoff.
    *   **Uniform Coverage:** Ensure even spray distribution. Avoid overlapping or missing strips, which can lead to either overdosing or inadequate weed control.

5.  **Favorable Environmental Conditions:**
    *   **Temperature:** Avoid spraying during extreme temperatures (very hot, above 35°C, or very cold, below 10°C). Ideal temperatures for most herbicide applications are between 15-25°C.
    *   **Moisture:** Ensure adequate soil moisture before and after application, especially for pre-emergence herbicides to activate them. Avoid applying post-emergence herbicides to drought-stressed crops, as they are more susceptible to injury.
    *   **Wind:** Do not spray during high winds (above 10 km/h) to prevent herbicide drift onto non-target crops or sensitive areas.
    *   **Rain:** Avoid spraying post-emergence herbicides if rain is expected within 4-6 hours after application, as it can wash off the herbicide, reducing efficacy and potentially causing runoff.

6.  **Crop Health:**
    *   Apply herbicides only to healthy, vigorously growing crops. Crops under stress (due to drought, waterlogging, nutrient deficiency, disease, or insect damage) are significantly more susceptible to herbicide injury. Address any stress factors before herbicide application.

7.  **Sprayer Cleaning:**
    *   Thoroughly clean the sprayer, tank, hoses, and nozzles with appropriate cleaning agents after each use, especially when switching between different herbicides or crops. Residues from previous applications can cause severe damage to the current crop.

8.  **Use of Adjuvants:**
    *   Use recommended adjuvants (e.g., non-ionic surfactants) only if specified on the herbicide label for Bengal Gram. While adjuvants can improve herbicide efficacy, some can also increase herbicide uptake and potentially enhance phytotoxicity if not used correctly or with sensitive crops.

9.  **Managing Potential Post-Emergence Phytotoxicity (e.g., with Imazethapyr):**
    *   As mentioned, **Imazethapyr** can cause temporary yellowing or stunting. To minimize this:
        *   Ensure the crop is not under any water or nutrient stress at the time of application.
        *   Consider applying at the lower end of the recommended dose if conditions are marginal or the crop is slightly stressed.
        *   Provide adequate nutrition and light irrigation (if needed and feasible) after application to help the crop recover quickly.

By strictly following these guidelines, you can effectively manage weeds in Bengal Gram while significantly reducing the risk of herbicide-induced crop damage. Always consult your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions.
