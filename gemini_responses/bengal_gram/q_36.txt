As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified practices to improve yield, fruit quality (referring to the pods and seeds), and storage life for Bengal Gram (Chickpea) in Haryana:

### Improving Yield

1.  **Variety Selection:**
    *   Choose high-yielding, disease-resistant varieties specifically recommended for Haryana, such as HC-1, HC-5, GNG-1581, GNG-1958, or other improved varieties developed by HAU.
2.  **Optimal Sowing Time:**
    *   Sow between mid-October and mid-November for optimal growth and yield in Haryana.
3.  **Seed Treatment:**
    *   **Rhizobium Inoculation:** Treat seeds with a specific *Rhizobium* culture (e.g., *Cicer* strain) at 500 g per 10-15 kg seed to enhance nitrogen fixation.
    *   **Fungicidal Treatment:** To protect against seed-borne diseases like wilt and root rot.
        *   **Carbendazim** 12% + **Mancozeb** 63% WP at 2.5 g/kg seed.
        *   **Thiram** at 2.5 g/kg seed.
    *   **Insecticidal Treatment:** For early season pest protection.
        *   **Imidacloprid** 600 FS at 5 ml/kg seed.
4.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Phosphorus:** Apply 40-60 kg P2O5/acre (e.g., through DAP or SSP) at the time of sowing.
    *   **Nitrogen:** Apply 10-20 kg N/acre as a starter dose (e.g., through DAP or Urea) at sowing.
    *   **Zinc:** If soil is deficient, apply **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** at 10 kg/acre at sowing or foliar spray of **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** 0.5% (5 g/L) at the branching stage.
    *   **Boron:** If soil is deficient, foliar spray of **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (Borax) 0.2% (2 g/L) at the pre-flowering stage.
5.  **Water Management:**
    *   Provide 1-2 light irrigations, if needed, at critical stages:
        *   Branching (45-60 days after sowing).
        *   Pod development (75-90 days after sowing). Avoid waterlogging.
6.  **Weed Management:**
    *   **Pre-emergence:** Apply **Pendimethalin** 30% EC at 1.0-1.25 kg a.i./acre (3.3-4.1 L/acre) within 3 days of sowing.
    *   **Post-emergence (if needed, for broadleaf weeds):** Apply **Imazethapyr** 10% SL at 75-100 g a.i./acre (750-1000 ml/acre) at 20-30 days after sowing.
7.  **Pest Management (Pod Borer - *Helicoverpa armigera*):**
    *   Monitor with pheromone traps.
    *   If the economic threshold is reached (e.g., 1-2 larvae/meter row length or 5-10% pod damage), apply:
        *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC at 60 ml/acre.
        *   **Emamectin Benzoate** 5% SG at 88 g/acre.
        *   **Flubendiamide** 20% WG at 100 g/acre.
8.  **Disease Management (Wilt, Ascochyta Blight):**
    *   Use resistant varieties and treated seeds (as mentioned above).
    *   For Ascochyta blight (if observed), apply foliar spray:
        *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP at 500 g/acre.
        *   **Chlorothalonil** 75% WP at 500 g/acre.

### Improving Fruit Quality (Pods and Seeds)

1.  **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure adequate supply of macro and micronutrients, especially Phosphorus and Zinc, for proper seed development, plumpness, and uniform size.
2.  **Optimal Water Management:** Avoid moisture stress during the pod filling stage to ensure good seed size, weight, and appearance.
3.  **Effective Pest and Disease Control:** Timely management of pod borer and diseases like Ascochyta blight prevents damage to pods and seeds, ensuring uniform, blemish-free produce with good luster.
4.  **Timely Harvesting:** Harvest when 80-90% of the pods have matured and dried. Delayed harvesting can lead to shattering, loss of luster, and increased chances of pest infestation in the field.
5.  **Gentle Post-Harvest Handling:** Handle pods and seeds gently during threshing and cleaning to prevent physical damage, which can reduce market quality.

### Improving Storage Life

1.  **Proper Drying:**
    *   Dry Bengal Gram seeds to a safe moisture content of 8-10% before storage. Higher moisture content promotes fungal growth (including aflatoxins) and insect activity, leading to spoilage.
2.  **Thorough Cleaning:**
    *   Clean the seeds thoroughly to remove dirt, chaff, broken grains, and other foreign matter, which can harbor pests and pathogens.
3.  **Sanitized Storage Structure:**
    *   Store in clean, dry, well-ventilated, and rodent-proof structures. For small-scale storage, use airtight containers or bags.
    *   Before storing, clean the godown/storage area thoroughly. Spray godown walls and floor with **Malathion** 50% EC at 10 ml/L water.
4.  **Pest Management in Storage (Pulse Beetle - *Callosobruchus maculatus*):**
    *   **Fumigation:** For large-scale storage, fumigation with **Aluminium Phosphide** tablets (1-2 tablets of 3 g each per tonne of grain) can be done by trained personnel in airtight conditions. Ensure strict safety precautions and a proper aeration period before consumption.
    *   **Physical Methods:** For small-scale storage, mixing inert materials like sand or ash, or using neem leaves, can deter pests. Airtight storage is crucial.
5.  **Regular Inspection:**
    *   Periodically inspect stored grains for signs of insect infestation, mold growth, or moisture ingress. Take corrective actions promptly.
6.  **Aeration:**
    *   Ensure good air circulation in the storage area to prevent localized hot spots and moisture accumulation, which can lead to spoilage.
