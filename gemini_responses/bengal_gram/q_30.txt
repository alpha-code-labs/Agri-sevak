Dear Farmer,

Managing growth issues in Bengal Gram (Chickpea) requires a careful understanding of the underlying causes, which can range from nutrient deficiencies to environmental stresses. It is always recommended to conduct a soil test to accurately diagnose nutrient imbalances before applying any fertilizers. Here's how you can manage the specific growth issues you've mentioned:

### 1. Slow Growth

**Possible Causes:** Nutrient deficiencies (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, Zinc), water stress, soil compaction, low temperatures, early pest/disease incidence.

**Management:**
*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Based on soil test, apply recommended doses of primary nutrients. If a soil test is unavailable, and the crop is showing general slow growth:
        *   For Nitrogen deficiency (general pale green/yellowing, older leaves): Foliar spray of **Urea** at 1-2% concentration (10-20 g/L of water).
        *   For Phosphorus deficiency (purplish tinge, stunted growth): Ensure adequate basal application of **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** or **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)**. For standing crops, foliar application of phosphorus is not very effective for significant uptake.
        *   For Potassium deficiency (scorching on leaf margins): Foliar spray of **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** at 1% concentration (10 g/L of water).
        *   For Zinc deficiency (interveinal chlorosis, stunted growth): Foliar spray of **Zinc Sulphate** (0.5% solution, 5 g/L) along with 0.25% **Calcium Hydroxide** (2.5 g/L) to neutralize acidity.
*   **Water Management:** Ensure optimal soil moisture. Provide light irrigation if the soil is dry, but strictly avoid waterlogging.
*   **Soil Health:** Improve soil structure through organic matter addition (e.g., farmyard manure before sowing) and avoid compaction.
*   **Pest/Disease Monitoring:** Regularly scout for early signs of pests or diseases that might be hindering growth and take appropriate control measures.

### 2. Yellow Growth (Chlorosis)

**Possible Causes:** Nitrogen deficiency, Iron deficiency, Zinc deficiency, Sulfur deficiency, waterlogging, high soil pH, nematode damage.

**Management:**
*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Nitrogen Deficiency:** Foliar spray of **Urea** at 1-2% concentration (10-20 g/L of water).
    *   **Iron Deficiency (interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, common in high pH soils):** Foliar spray of **Ferrous Sulphate** at 0.5% concentration (5 g/L of water) along with 0.25% **Calcium Hydroxide** (2.5 g/L). Repeat after 7-10 days if needed.
    *   **Zinc Deficiency:** Foliar spray of **Zinc Sulphate** (0.5% solution, 5 g/L) along with 0.25% **Calcium Hydroxide** (2.5 g/L).
    *   **Sulfur Deficiency (general yellowing of younger leaves):** Soil application of **Elemental Sulphur** at 20 kg/acre before sowing, or foliar spray of **Potassium Sulphate** (1% solution, 10 g/L) if deficiency is observed in standing crop.
*   **Water Management:** Ensure proper drainage to prevent waterlogging, which can induce nutrient deficiencies.
*   **Soil pH:** If high pH is a persistent issue, consider soil amendments like **Gypsum** (for sodic soils) or organic matter.

### 3. Excessive Height

**Possible Causes:** High nitrogen availability, dense planting, certain varieties, low light conditions. Excessive height can lead to lodging, especially during strong winds or heavy rains.

**Management:**
*   **Nitrogen Management:** Avoid excessive application of nitrogen fertilizers, especially after the initial vegetative growth phase. Bengal Gram is a legume and fixes its own nitrogen.
*   **Planting Density:** Maintain optimal plant spacing as per HAU recommendations for your specific variety to ensure adequate light penetration and air circulation.
*   **Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs):** To manage excessive height and reduce lodging risk, a CIBRC approved plant growth regulator can be used.
    *   Apply **Chlormequat Chloride** at 100-200 ml per acre, diluted in 200-300 litres of water, as a foliar spray during the early flowering stage (around 45-60 days after sowing). Always follow the manufacturer's instructions for precise dosage and timing.

### 4. Excessive Flowering (and poor pod set)

**Possible Causes:** While abundant flowering is generally desirable, if it's not converting into pods effectively, it could be due to nutrient imbalances (especially Boron), water stress (too much or too little), high temperatures during flowering, or pest damage to flowers.

**Management:**
*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Boron Deficiency:** Boron is crucial for pollen viability and pod set. If deficiency is suspected (e.g., poor pod set despite good flowering), apply **Borax** (Disodium Tetraborate Decahydrate) at 0.1-0.2% concentration (1-2 g/L of water) as a foliar spray at pre-flowering or early flowering stage.
*   **Water Management:** Ensure consistent and adequate soil moisture during the flowering and pod development stages. Avoid both severe drought stress and waterlogging.
*   **Temperature Management:** High temperatures (>30-32°C) during flowering can lead to flower drop. While direct control is difficult, ensuring good plant health and timely sowing to avoid peak heat can help.
*   **Pest Management:** Regularly scout for pests like pod borers (Helicoverpa armigera) that can damage flowers and young pods, leading to poor pod set. Implement integrated pest management strategies if pests are detected.

Always consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and variety.
