This is not known to affect Bengal Gram.

Smut diseases (Black, False, Kernel, and Loose smut) are primarily diseases of cereal crops (e.g., wheat, barley, sorghum, maize, rice) and are not recognized as significant pathogens of Bengal Gram (chickpea, *Cicer arietinum*). Bengal Gram is susceptible to other fungal diseases such as Ascochyta blight, Fusarium wilt, Rust, Botrytis grey mould, and Sclerotinia stem rot, which require different management strategies.
