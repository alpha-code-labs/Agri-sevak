Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I am pleased to provide you with the scientifically verified information regarding the maturity signs, harvesting time, and cutting process for Bengal Gram (Chana) in Haryana.

### Maturity Signs for Bengal Gram

Observing these signs will help you determine the optimal time for harvesting:

*   **Leaf Senescence:** The lower leaves of the plant will start turning yellow and gradually dry up, eventually shedding.
*   **Pod Colour Change:** The pods, which are initially green, will change their colour to yellowish-brown or straw colour.
*   **Seed Hardness:** The seeds inside the pods will become hard and firm. When you shake a mature pod, you should hear the seeds rattling inside.
*   **Plant Drying:** The entire plant will show signs of drying, with stems and branches becoming brittle.
*   **Moisture Content:** The ideal moisture content of the seeds at harvest for safe storage is typically around 10-12%. For manual harvesting, it can be slightly higher (15-20%) before further drying.

### Harvesting Time for Bengal Gram

*   **Optimal Stage:** Harvesting should ideally be done when 80-90% of the pods have matured and dried on the plant, and the plants have shed most of their leaves.
*   **Timing in Haryana:** Bengal Gram is a Rabi crop. Depending on the sowing time and variety, harvesting in Haryana typically occurs from late February to March.
*   **Avoid Premature Harvesting:** Harvesting too early can result in immature, shriveled grains, leading to lower yield and poor quality.
*   **Avoid Delayed Harvesting:** Delaying harvest too much after maturity can lead to significant shattering losses, especially if the crop is exposed to strong winds or dry conditions, and can also increase the risk of pest infestation in the field.

### Cutting Process for Bengal Gram

The cutting process can be done either manually or mechanically:

*   **Manual Harvesting:**
    *   **Cutting:** The plants are cut close to the ground level using sickles. This ensures that maximum pods are collected.
    *   **Bundling:** The harvested plants are then gathered into small bundles.
    *   **Field Curing:** These bundles are typically left in the field for 2-3 days to allow for further drying and uniform moisture reduction across all pods and seeds. This process is crucial for proper threshing and storage.
    *   **Transportation:** After adequate field curing, the bundles are transported to the threshing yard.

*   **Mechanical Harvesting (Combine Harvester):**
    *   **Direct Combining:** For large areas, combine harvesters can be used. This is most effective when the crop is uniformly dry, and the seed moisture content is around 10-12%.
    *   **Machine Settings:** It is crucial to adjust the combine harvester settings (e.g., cylinder speed, concave clearance, fan speed) according to the crop conditions to minimize grain damage and shattering losses.
    *   **Efficiency:** Mechanical harvesting significantly reduces labour requirements and speeds up the harvesting process, but requires careful management of crop moisture content.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure a timely and efficient harvest of your Bengal Gram crop, leading to maximum yield and quality.
