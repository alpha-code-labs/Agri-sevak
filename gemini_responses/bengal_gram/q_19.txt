As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I strongly recommend conducting a comprehensive soil test before applying any fertilizers. This is the most scientifically sound approach to determine the exact nutrient status of your field and avoid over or under-application, which can be detrimental to crop health and soil fertility.

Bengal Gram (Chickpea) is a legume and has specific nutrient requirements.

### General Principles for Bengal Gram Nutrition:

1.  **Nitrogen Fixation:** Bengal Gram forms a symbiotic relationship with *Rhizobium* bacteria in its root nodules, which fix atmospheric nitrogen. This significantly reduces its external nitrogen requirement compared to non-leguminous crops.
2.  **Phosphorus Importance:** Phosphorus is crucial for root development, nodule formation, flowering, and pod development in Bengal Gram.
3.  **Potassium Importance:** Potassium contributes to overall plant vigor, water regulation, disease resistance, and efficient nutrient transport.

### Addressing Macro-nutrient Deficiencies in Bengal Gram:

#### 1. Addressing Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Yellowing of older leaves, stunted growth, poor nodulation.
*   **HAU Recommendation:** While Bengal Gram fixes its own nitrogen, a small starter dose of nitrogen is often beneficial to support early plant growth before effective nodulation begins. Excessive nitrogen can inhibit nodule formation.
*   **Corrective Measures (Basal Application - based on soil test):**
    *   Typically, 15-20 kg N per acre is recommended as a starter dose. This is often supplied through **Diammonium Phosphate** or **Monoammonium Phosphate** which also provide phosphorus.
    *   If a soil test indicates very low N and P is sufficient (rare for legumes), a small amount of **Urea** can be applied at sowing.
        *   Apply 30-45 kg of **Urea** per acre (to provide 15-20 kg N/acre) at the time of sowing, if not supplied through other complex fertilizers.
*   **Corrective Measures (Foliar Application - if deficiency observed during growth and nodulation is poor):**
    *   Spray 1-2% solution of **Urea** (10-20 g of **Urea** per litre of water) at 15-day intervals, if severe deficiency symptoms appear and nodulation is confirmed to be poor. Ensure good coverage.

#### 2. Addressing Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, dark green or purplish discoloration of leaves, poor root development, delayed maturity, reduced podding.
*   **HAU Recommendation:** Phosphorus is the most critical macro-nutrient for Bengal Gram.
*   **Corrective Measures (Basal Application - based on soil test):**
    *   Apply 40-60 kg P2O5 per acre at the time of sowing.
    *   To achieve this, you can use:
        *   **Diammonium Phosphate** (DAP): Apply 87-130 kg of **Diammonium Phosphate** per acre (provides 40-60 kg P2O5 and 15-23 kg N). This is a common choice as it provides both N and P.
        *   **Single Super Phosphate** (SSP): Apply 250-375 kg of **Single Super Phosphate** per acre (provides 40-60 kg P2O5). If using SSP, ensure adequate N is supplied separately.
        *   **Monoammonium Phosphate** (MAP): Apply 77-115 kg of **Monoammonium Phosphate** per acre (provides 40-60 kg P2O5 and 8-12 kg N).
*   **Corrective Measures (Foliar Application - if deficiency observed during growth):**
    *   Spray 1-2% solution of **Monoammonium Phosphate** (10-20 g of **Monoammonium Phosphate** per litre of water) at flowering or early podding stage, if deficiency symptoms are visible.

#### 3. Addressing Potassium (K) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Yellowing and browning of leaf margins (scorching), particularly on older leaves; weak stems; reduced disease resistance.
*   **HAU Recommendation:** Potassium requirements for Bengal Gram are generally lower than for N and P, but it is essential for overall plant health, especially in soils with low K status.
*   **Corrective Measures (Basal Application - based on soil test):**
    *   If soil test indicates low potassium, apply 20 kg K2O per acre at the time of sowing.
    *   To achieve this, you can use:
        *   **Muriate of Potash** (Potassium Chloride): Apply 33 kg of **Muriate of Potash** per acre (provides 20 kg K2O).
        *   **Sulphate of Potash** (Potassium Sulphate): Apply 40 kg of **Sulphate of Potash** per acre (provides 20 kg K2O).
*   **Corrective Measures (Foliar Application - if deficiency observed during growth):**
    *   Spray 1-2% solution of **Sulphate of Potash** (10-20 g of **Sulphate of Potash** per litre of water) if deficiency symptoms appear during the vegetative or reproductive stages.

### Application Method and Timing:

*   **Basal Application:** All recommended basal doses of fertilizers (N, P, K) should be applied at the time of sowing. They should be drilled or broadcast and incorporated into the soil before or at sowing, preferably in bands near the seed row for better nutrient availability.
*   **Foliar Application:** For foliar sprays, ensure even coverage of the foliage. Apply during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late afternoon) to prevent scorching and improve absorption.

### Important Note:

Always prioritize soil testing. The dosages provided are general recommendations for Haryana conditions. A specific soil test report will allow for precise and efficient nutrient management, leading to better yields and sustainable agriculture. Also, ensure proper *Rhizobium* inoculation of seeds before sowing to maximize nitrogen fixation.
