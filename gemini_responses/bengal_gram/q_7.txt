As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I must provide scientifically accurate information specific to Bengal Gram (Chickpea).

Regarding the diseases you've mentioned:

*   **Dieback:** This is not known to affect Bengal Gram as a specific disease entity. Symptoms of drying back of shoots can occur due to various stresses or other fungal diseases like Ascochyta blight, but "Dieback" itself is not a recognized disease name for Bengal Gram.
*   **Twig blight:** This is not known to affect Bengal Gram. Twig blight typically affects woody plants and shrubs, whereas Bengal Gram is an herbaceous crop.
*   **Tikka disease:** This is not known to affect Bengal Gram. Tikka disease is a well-known foliar disease primarily affecting Groundnut (Peanut).
