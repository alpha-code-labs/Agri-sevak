As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I advise on the following scientifically verified irrigation management practices for Bengal Gram (Chickpea) in Haryana:

Bengal Gram is a crop that is highly sensitive to over-irrigation, which can lead to excessive vegetative growth, reduced pod formation, and increased susceptibility to diseases. Therefore, judicious water management is crucial.

*   **First Irrigation:**
    *   The first irrigation is the most critical and should be applied at the **pre-flowering or branching stage**, typically around **45-60 days after sowing (DAS)**.
    *   This timing ensures adequate moisture for robust vegetative growth and prepares the plant for flowering without causing flower drop.
    *   Factors like soil type (lighter soils may require earlier irrigation) and winter rainfall should be considered.
    *   **Crucial Caution:** Avoid irrigation during the peak flowering stage, as it can lead to significant flower shedding and reduced yield.

*   **Second Irrigation:**
    *   A second irrigation is **generally not required** for Bengal Gram, especially if the first irrigation was timely and effective, and the crop has received some winter rainfall.
    *   If there is a prolonged dry spell, high temperatures during the pod development phase, or if the crop is grown on very light-textured soils, a light second irrigation might be beneficial.
    *   If absolutely necessary, apply it at the **pod development/filling stage**, usually around **80-90 DAS**.
    *   **Crucial Caution:** Ensure this irrigation is light to avoid waterlogging, which can be detrimental to root health and overall yield.

*   **Sprinkler Use:**
    *   **Sprinkler irrigation is highly recommended** for Bengal Gram cultivation. It offers significant advantages over traditional flood irrigation methods.
    *   **Water Use Efficiency:** Sprinklers ensure uniform water distribution and significantly improve water use efficiency, conserving precious water resources.
    *   **Prevents Waterlogging:** It minimizes the risk of waterlogging, which is particularly harmful to Bengal Gram as it can lead to root rot diseases and poor aeration in the root zone.
    *   **Optimal Soil Moisture:** Sprinklers allow for the application of light and controlled amounts of water, maintaining optimal soil moisture levels without over-saturating the root zone.
    *   **Application:** When using sprinklers, aim for a light irrigation of **25-30 mm depth** per application to replenish the soil moisture effectively without causing runoff or deep percolation.
