As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm that Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies are generally not considered major field pests of Bengal Gram (Chickpea) in Haryana. The primary insect pest affecting Bengal Gram in the field is the Gram Pod Borer (Helicoverpa armigera), which is a lepidopteran larva (caterpillar), not belonging to these categories.

Therefore, specific control measures for Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies in Bengal Gram fields are typically not required.

This is not known to significantly affect Bengal Gram in the field.
