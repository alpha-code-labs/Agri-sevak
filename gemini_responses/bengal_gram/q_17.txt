As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following doses of organic manures and bio-stimulants for Bengal Gram (Chickpea) cultivation in Haryana to improve soil health and crop productivity:

*   **Farm Yard Manure (FYM):**
    *   **Dose:** 5-10 tonnes per acre (or 50-100 quintals per acre).
    *   **Application:** Incorporate thoroughly into the soil during land preparation, at least 2-3 weeks before sowing. This improves soil structure, water holding capacity, and provides a slow release of essential nutrients.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 tonnes per acre.
    *   **Application:** Apply during land preparation and mix well with the soil before sowing. Vermicompost is richer in nutrients and beneficial microorganisms compared to FYM, contributing to enhanced soil fertility.

*   **Sagarika (Bio-stimulant):**
    *   Sagarika is a seaweed extract-based bio-stimulant that promotes plant growth, root development, and nutrient uptake, rather than being a bulk organic manure.
    *   **For Soil Application (Granular form, e.g., Sagarika G):**
        *   **Dose:** 8-10 kg per acre.
        *   **Application:** Apply at the time of sowing, either broadcast and incorporated into the soil or mixed with basal fertilizers.
    *   **For Foliar Application (Liquid form, e.g., Sagarika Z/XX):**
        *   **Dose:** 250-500 ml per acre, diluted in 150-200 litres of water.
        *   **Application:** Two sprays are generally recommended:
            *   First spray: At the vegetative/branching stage (around 30-40 days after sowing).
            *   Second spray: At the pre-flowering/pod initiation stage (around 60-70 days after sowing).
