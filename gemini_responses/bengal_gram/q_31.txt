As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned conditions in Bengal Gram (Chickpea) in Haryana:

### Control of Physical Damage in Bengal Gram

#### 1. Fruit Bursting (Pod Bursting)

*   **Affects Bengal Gram:** Yes, pod shattering or bursting is a known issue in Bengal Gram, particularly at maturity, leading to significant yield losses. It is primarily influenced by genetic factors, environmental conditions (such as alternating wet and dry spells, strong winds), and delayed harvesting.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Genetic Selection:** Cultivate varieties that are known for their resistance to pod shattering. Consult HAU recommendations for suitable varieties in Haryana.
    *   **Timely Harvesting:** Harvest the crop at physiological maturity when the pods are dry but before excessive shattering occurs. Delaying harvest can significantly increase losses.
    *   **Optimal Moisture Management:** Ensure consistent and adequate soil moisture during the pod development stage to prevent stress that can lead to brittle pods.
*   **Chemical Control:** There are no CIBRC-approved technical chemicals specifically recommended or effective for preventing fruit bursting in Bengal Gram in the field.

#### 2. Leaf Burning/Melting

*   **Affects Bengal Gram:** Yes, symptoms of leaf burning, scorching, or necrosis can occur in Bengal Gram due to various factors. "Melting" typically refers to severe and rapid tissue breakdown.
*   **Nature of the Problem:** This is a symptom, not a specific disease or pest. The underlying cause must be accurately diagnosed for effective control. Potential causes include:
    *   **Environmental Stress:** High temperatures, drought stress, frost damage, or severe waterlogging.
    *   **Nutrient Imbalances:** Deficiencies (e.g., potassium, magnesium) or toxicities (e.g., boron toxicity, salinity).
    *   **Disease:** Certain fungal or bacterial diseases (e.g., Ascochyta blight, rust) can cause leaf lesions, necrosis, or blight that might appear as burning.
    *   **Chemical Phytotoxicity:** Incorrect application of herbicides, insecticides, or fungicides, or spray drift.
*   **Control Measures (Dependent on Diagnosis):**
    *   **Accurate Diagnosis:** It is crucial to identify the specific cause through careful field observation, soil and plant tissue analysis, or consultation with an agricultural expert.
    *   **Environmental Stress Management:**
        *   **Irrigation:** Provide timely and adequate irrigation during dry periods to mitigate drought stress.
        *   **Drainage:** Ensure proper field drainage to prevent waterlogging, especially in heavy soils.
        *   **Crop Residue:** Maintaining adequate crop residue can help moderate soil temperature and moisture.
    *   **Nutrient Management:**
        *   If due to **Boron deficiency**: Foliar spray of **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate) at 1.5-2.0 g/L of water.
        *   If due to **Zinc deficiency**: Foliar spray of **Zinc Sulphate** (Zinc sulphate heptahydrate) at 2.5-5.0 g/L of water.
        *   If due to other specific nutrient deficiencies, apply the respective nutrient as per soil test recommendations.
    *   **Disease Management (if a fungal disease is the cause):**
        *   For diseases like Ascochyta blight, which can cause leaf necrosis and blight:
            *   Foliar spray of **Mancozeb** (2.0-2.5 g/L of water) or **Chlorothalonil** (2.0 g/L of water).
            *   Repeat sprays at 10-15 day intervals if disease pressure persists and weather conditions are conducive.
    *   **Chemical Application Practices:** Always follow recommended dosages and application methods for all agrochemicals to avoid phytotoxicity. Avoid spraying during high temperatures or strong winds.

#### 3. Hardness in Fruit (Hardness in Pods/Seeds)

*   **Affects Bengal Gram:** Yes, the "hard-to-cook" (HTC) phenomenon is a significant post-harvest quality issue in Bengal Gram seeds, making them difficult to cook without prolonged soaking or pressure cooking. This is primarily influenced by genetic factors, storage conditions (high temperature and humidity), and seed coat properties.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Genetic Selection:** Cultivate varieties known to have softer seed coats or less susceptibility to the HTC phenomenon.
    *   **Proper Drying:** Ensure seeds are dried to a safe moisture content (typically 9-10%) immediately after harvest to prevent quality deterioration during storage.
    *   **Optimal Storage Conditions:** Store seeds in cool, dry, and well-ventilated conditions to minimize the development of hardness. Avoid high temperatures and humidity during storage.
    *   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure balanced nutrient availability during crop growth, as some nutrient imbalances can indirectly affect seed quality.
*   **Chemical Control:** There are no CIBRC-approved technical chemicals specifically recommended or effective for preventing hardness in Bengal Gram seeds in the field. This is predominantly a post-harvest quality and genetic issue.
