As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Bengal Gram (Chickpea) in Haryana:

1.  **Grasshopper**
    Grasshoppers are polyphagous pests that can cause significant defoliation in Bengal Gram, especially during early crop stages.

    *   **Cultural Control:**
        *   Deep ploughing during summer exposes grasshopper eggs to predators and harsh weather, reducing their population.
        *   Hand-picking and destroying nymphs and adults in small areas during early infestation.
        *   Installation of bird perches in the field to encourage predatory birds.

    *   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray/Dusting):**
        Apply insecticides when infestation is observed, especially on young plants. Ensure thorough coverage.
        *   **Malathion** 5% Dust @ 20-25 kg/acre.
        *   **Quinalphos** 25% EC @ 1.0 L/acre mixed in 200-400 L of water.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC @ 200 ml/acre mixed in 200-400 L of water.

2.  **Painted bug (Bagrada hilaris)**
    The Painted Bug (Bagrada hilaris) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., mustard, cabbage, cauliflower). This is not known to be a significant pest affecting Bengal Gram.

3.  **Red cotton bug (Dysdercus cingulatus)**
    The Red Cotton Bug (Dysdercus cingulatus) is a major pest of cotton and other malvaceous plants, feeding on developing seeds. This is not known to affect Bengal Gram.

4.  **Black ants**
    Black ants are generally not considered direct pests of Bengal Gram. While they may be present in the field, often associated with honeydew-producing pests like aphids (which are pests of Bengal Gram), they do not typically cause direct damage to the crop itself. This is not known to affect Bengal Gram as a direct pest.
