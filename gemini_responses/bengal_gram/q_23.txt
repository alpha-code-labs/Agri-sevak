As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified seed and soil treatment processes for Bengal Gram (Chickpea) to ensure healthy crop establishment and mitigate early-season challenges.

**Seed Treatment Process for Bengal Gram:**

Seed treatment is crucial for protecting seeds and young seedlings from seed-borne and early soil-borne diseases, as well as initial insect pest attacks, and for enhancing nutrient availability.

1.  **Fungicidal Treatment (Mandatory):**
    *   To protect against seed-borne diseases like wilt (Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. ciceri), damping-off, and seed rot.
    *   Apply **Carbendazim** 50% WP @ 1-2 g/kg seed.
    *   *Alternatively, you may use:* **Thiram** 75% WS @ 2.5-3 g/kg seed.

2.  **Insecticidal Treatment (If early sucking pest incidence is anticipated):**
    *   To protect against early-season sucking pests.
    *   Apply **Imidacloprid** 70% WS @ 5-7 g/kg seed.
    *   *Alternatively, you may use:* **Thiamethoxam** 30% FS @ 10 ml/kg seed.

3.  **Bio-fungicidal Treatment:**
    *   To enhance protection against soil-borne fungal diseases like wilt and root rot.
    *   Apply **Trichoderma viride** (or **Trichoderma harzianum**) @ 4-5 g/kg seed.

4.  **Bio-fertilizer Treatment:**
    *   Essential for nitrogen fixation and phosphate solubilization, promoting better nutrient uptake.
    *   Apply **Rhizobium** culture @ 10 g/kg seed.
    *   Apply **PSB (Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria)** culture @ 10 g/kg seed.

**Order of Application for Seed Treatment:**
It is critical to apply treatments in the correct sequence to avoid harming beneficial microbes.
1.  First, apply the Fungicide. Allow the seeds to dry slightly.
2.  Next, apply the Insecticide (if used). Allow the seeds to dry slightly.
3.  Then, apply the Bio-fungicide (**Trichoderma**). Allow the seeds to dry slightly.
4.  Finally, apply the Bio-fertilizers (**Rhizobium** and **PSB**).
Mix the seeds thoroughly after each application to ensure uniform coating. Sow the treated seeds as soon as possible.

**Soil Treatment Process for Bengal Gram:**

Soil treatment focuses on managing soil-borne diseases, nematodes, and weeds, contributing to a healthy growing environment.

1.  **For Soil-borne Disease Management:**
    *   To suppress soil-borne fungal pathogens causing wilt and root rot.
    *   Apply **Trichoderma viride** (or **Trichoderma harzianum**) @ 2.5 kg/acre. Mix it thoroughly with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost and broadcast uniformly over the field before the last ploughing or at the time of sowing.

2.  **For Nematode Management (If there is a history of nematode problems):**
    *   To reduce nematode populations in the soil.
    *   Incorporate **Neem cake** @ 100-200 kg/acre into the soil 2-3 weeks before sowing. This acts as an organic nematicide and also provides nutrients.

3.  **For Weed Management (Pre-emergence Herbicide):**
    *   To control weeds effectively from the initial stages of crop growth.
    *   Apply **Pendimethalin** 30% EC @ 1.0-1.3 L/acre, sprayed uniformly in 200-300 L of water within 0-3 days after sowing. Ensure adequate soil moisture at the time of application.
    *   *Alternatively, you may use:* **Fluchloralin** 45% EC @ 0.8-1.0 L/acre, incorporated into the soil before sowing (pre-plant incorporation).

These integrated seed and soil treatment practices will provide a strong foundation for a healthy and productive Bengal Gram crop in Haryana. Always ensure proper calibration of equipment and follow safety guidelines while handling chemicals.
