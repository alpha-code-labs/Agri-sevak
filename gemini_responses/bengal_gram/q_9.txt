Namaste! Mites, including Red spider mite (Tetranychus urticae) and Rust mite, are indeed significant pests of Bengal Gram (Chickpea) in Haryana, especially during dry and warm periods. Their feeding can cause considerable damage, leading to reduced photosynthesis, defoliation, and ultimately, yield loss.

Here's a scientifically verified approach to control mites in Bengal Gram:

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategy for Mite Control:**

A holistic approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods is most effective for sustainable mite management.

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the field and surrounding areas free of weeds, as many weeds serve as alternate hosts for mites.
    *   **Proper Irrigation:** Mites thrive in dry, dusty conditions. Adequate and timely irrigation can help reduce mite populations. Avoid water stress in the crop.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate Bengal Gram with non-host crops to break the pest cycle.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy crop residues after harvest to eliminate overwintering sites for mites.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Several predatory mites (e.g., Amblyseius spp.), lacewings, and ladybird beetles feed on pest mites. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.
    *   **Augmentative Release:** In some cases, mass-reared predatory mites can be released, though this is more common in protected cultivation. For field crops, focus on conserving existing populations.

3.  **Chemical Control (Acaricides):**
    When mite populations reach economic threshold levels (e.g., visible webbing, significant leaf damage, or high mite counts per leaf), chemical intervention may be necessary. Always rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

    Here are some CIBRC-approved technical chemical names for mite control in Bengal Gram, along with their recommended dosages:

    *   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:**
        *   Dose: 0.5 ml per litre of water (or 250 ml per acre in 500 litres of water).
        *   Mode of Action: Lipid biosynthesis inhibitor, effective against all life stages of mites.

    *   **Propargite 57% EC:**
        *   Dose: 2.5 ml per litre of water (or 1250 ml per acre in 500 litres of water).
        *   Mode of Action: Non-systemic acaricide with contact and stomach action, effective against motile stages.

    *   **Abamectin 1.8% EC:**
        *   Dose: 0.5 ml per litre of water (or 250 ml per acre in 500 litres of water).
        *   Mode of Action: Nerve poison, effective against mites and leaf miners.

    *   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP:**
        *   Dose: 4-5 g per litre of water (or 2.0-2.5 kg per acre in 500 litres of water).
        *   Mode of Action: Contact and fumigant action, also helps control powdery mildew. Effective against eggs and nymphs.

    *   **Fenpyroximate 5% SC:**
        *   Dose: 0.75 ml per litre of water (or 375 ml per acre in 500 litres of water).
        *   Mode of Action: Mitochondrial electron transport inhibitor, effective against all life stages.

**Application Guidelines:**

*   **Thorough Coverage:** Mites are often found on the undersides of leaves. Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the lower leaf surfaces, for effective control.
*   **Spray Volume:** Use adequate water volume (typically 400-500 litres per acre for field crops) to ensure good coverage.
*   **Timing:** Apply acaricides when mite populations are building up, before severe damage occurs. Repeat application if necessary, following label instructions and respecting the pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   **Safety Precautions:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, mask, and protective clothing while handling and spraying chemicals. Follow all instructions on the product label.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Observe the specified pre-harvest interval for each chemical to ensure the produce is safe for consumption.

**Monitoring:**
Regularly scout your Bengal Gram fields, especially during dry spells, to detect mite infestations early. Look for characteristic symptoms like yellowing, bronzing, stippling on leaves, and fine webbing on the undersides of leaves or between plant parts. Early detection allows for timely and effective intervention.

By adopting these practices, you can effectively manage mite populations in your Bengal Gram crop and safeguard your yield. For specific local recommendations or further clarification, please consult with the agricultural extension office or scientists at HAU, Hisar.
