As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), here are the recommended cultivation practices for Bengal Gram (Chickpea) in Haryana:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   **Line Sowing:** This is the most recommended method. Sowing in lines facilitates inter-cultivation operations (weeding, hoeing), spraying, and harvesting.
    *   **Direction:** Sowing in an East-West direction is often preferred as it allows better light interception for the plants.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   **Optimal Depth:** 5-8 cm.
    *   **Rationale:** Deeper sowing can delay emergence and reduce plant stand, while shallower sowing can lead to poor germination due to moisture stress, especially in dry conditions. Ensure good soil moisture at the time of sowing.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   **Row-to-Row Spacing:**
        *   **Desi Varieties:** 30-45 cm (depending on variety and soil fertility).
        *   **Kabuli Varieties:** 45-60 cm (due to their more spreading growth habit).
    *   **Plant-to-Plant Spacing:**
        *   **Desi Varieties:** 10 cm.
        *   **Kabuli Varieties:** 15-20 cm.
    *   **Rationale:** Appropriate spacing ensures optimal light penetration, air circulation, and nutrient uptake, leading to better plant growth and yield.

*   **Seed Dose (Seed Rate):**
    *   The seed dose varies significantly based on the variety (desi vs. kabuli), seed size, and desired plant population.
    *   **Desi Varieties (Small to Medium Seed Size):** 75-100 kg/acre.
    *   **Kabuli Varieties (Large Seed Size):** 100-120 kg/acre.
    *   **Bold Seeded Desi Varieties:** 90-110 kg/acre.
    *   **Factors to Consider:**
        *   **Germination Percentage:** Adjust seed rate upwards if germination percentage is low.
        *   **Sowing Time:** Slightly higher seed rate may be used for late sowing to compensate for reduced tillering.
        *   **Soil Fertility:** In highly fertile soils, a slightly lower seed rate might be sufficient.
    *   **Seed Treatment:** Always treat seeds with recommended fungicides and insecticides before sowing to protect against early seedling diseases and pests.
