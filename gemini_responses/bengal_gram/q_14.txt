As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an integrated approach for managing soil pests like termites and nematodes in Bengal Gram (Chickpea) to ensure sustainable and effective control.

### Integrated Management of Soil Pests in Bengal Gram

**I. Termite Control (e.g., *Odontotermes obesus*, *Microtermes obesi*)**

Termites can cause significant damage by feeding on germinating seeds, roots, and the stem base, leading to wilting and plant death.

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Deep Summer Ploughing:** Exposes termite colonies to high temperatures and predators, disrupting their habitat.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove all crop residues, stubble, and woody debris from the field, as these can serve as food sources for termites.
    *   **Avoid Undecomposed Organic Matter:** Do not apply undecomposed farmyard manure (FYM) directly before sowing, as it can attract termites. Ensure FYM is well-rotted.

2.  **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Seed Treatment (Preventive):** This is the most effective and economical method for early protection.
        *   Treat seeds with **Fipronil 5% FS** @ 6-8 ml per kg of seed.
        *   Alternatively, use **Imidacloprid 600 FS** @ 5-7 ml per kg of seed, which also provides protection against early sucking pests.
    *   **Soil Application/Drenching (Curative, if infestation is observed after germination):**
        *   In case of severe infestation, drench the soil around the plant base with **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** @ 4 L per acre, mixed in 200-400 L of water. This can be applied through irrigation or as a targeted drench.

**II. Nematode Control (Root-knot Nematodes, e.g., *Meloidogyne javanica*, *Meloidogyne incognita*)**

Root-knot nematodes cause characteristic galls on roots, impairing nutrient and water uptake, leading to stunted growth, yellowing, and significant yield reduction.

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Implement a strict crop rotation schedule with non-host crops such as cereals (wheat, barley, maize, sorghum) for at least 2-3 years. Avoid continuous cultivation of susceptible crops.
    *   **Summer Ploughing:** Deep ploughing during the hot summer months exposes nematode eggs and larvae to direct sunlight and desiccation, reducing their population.
    *   **Use of Resistant Varieties:** If locally adapted and high-yielding nematode-resistant Bengal Gram varieties are available and recommended for Haryana, prioritize their cultivation.
    *   **Solarization:** For small plots, covering the soil with transparent polyethylene sheets during peak summer for 4-6 weeks can significantly reduce nematode populations by increasing soil temperature.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   **Seed Treatment/Soil Application:**
        *   Treat seeds with bio-nematicides like **Purpureocillium lilacinum** (formerly *Paecilomyces lilacinus*) @ 5-10 g per kg of seed.
        *   Alternatively, apply **Purpureocillium lilacinum** or **Trichoderma harzianum** @ 2.5 kg per acre, mixed with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed farmyard manure or compost, and broadcast uniformly before sowing or at the time of sowing.

3.  **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Soil Application (Pre-sowing or at sowing):**
        *   Apply **Carbofuran 3% G** @ 10-15 kg per acre, broadcast and incorporated into the soil before sowing, or applied in furrows at the time of sowing.
        *   Alternatively, apply **Phorate 10% G** @ 4 kg per acre, broadcast and incorporated into the soil before sowing, or applied in furrows at the time of sowing. (Note: Phorate is a highly toxic chemical and should be handled with extreme caution and appropriate protective gear).

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label for safe and effective use, including dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Ensure proper calibration of equipment for accurate application rates.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension officers or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and pest pressure.
