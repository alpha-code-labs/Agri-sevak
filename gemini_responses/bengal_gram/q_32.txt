Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

The "drying up" of Bengal Gram (chickpea) plants, manifesting as drying branches, leaves, fruits, and flowers, is a serious concern that can significantly reduce yield. This symptom is often a manifestation of various underlying issues, primarily fungal diseases, insect pests, and abiotic stresses. As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I advise a comprehensive and integrated approach based on scientific principles.

Here are the primary causes and their management strategies:

### 1. Fungal Diseases

These are the most common and devastating causes of drying up in Bengal Gram.

*   **Fusarium Wilt (Caused by *Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. ciceri*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Sudden wilting and drying of individual plants or patches, often without yellowing. The vascular tissue (stem cross-section) shows dark brown discoloration.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Resistant Varieties:** This is the most effective long-term solution. Cultivate wilt-resistant varieties recommended for Haryana, such as HC-1, GNG-1581, HAU-202, Gaurav, or Haryana Chana-1.
        *   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds before sowing to protect against early infection.
            *   **Carbendazim** 1 g/kg seed + **Thiram** 2 g/kg seed.
            *   Alternatively, **Thiophanate Methyl** 2 g/kg seed + **Thiram** 2 g/kg seed.
            *   For organic approach, use *Trichoderma viride* @ 4-5 g/kg seed.
        *   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid continuous cultivation of Bengal Gram in the same field. Rotate with non-host crops like wheat, sorghum, or pearl millet for at least 3-4 years.
        *   **Deep Ploughing:** Exposes fungal inoculum to sunlight, reducing its viability.
        *   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure proper soil fertility to enhance plant vigour.

*   **Ascochyta Blight (Caused by *Ascochyta rabiei*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Circular spots with dark margins and light centres on leaves, stems, and pods. Severe infection leads to girdling of stems, causing drying of branches or the entire plant above the lesion.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Resistant Varieties:** Use resistant varieties like GNG-1581 or HC-1.
        *   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds with fungicides to eliminate seed-borne inoculum.
            *   **Carbendazim** 1 g/kg seed.
            *   Alternatively, **Thiophanate Methyl** 2 g/kg seed.
        *   **Foliar Spray (if disease appears):**
            *   **Chlorothalonil** @ 2 g/L of water.
            *   Alternatively, **Mancozeb** @ 2.5 g/L of water.
            *   Spray at the appearance of symptoms and repeat after 10-15 days if necessary.

*   **Botrytis Grey Mould (Caused by *Botrytis cinerea*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Greyish-brown, water-soaked lesions on flowers, pods, and stems, often covered with a greyish fungal growth. Infected parts rot and dry up, leading to flower and pod drop.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Wider Spacing:** Maintain optimum plant spacing (e.g., 30 cm row to row, 10 cm plant to plant) to improve air circulation and reduce humidity within the canopy.
        *   **Foliar Spray (if disease appears):**
            *   **Carbendazim** @ 1 g/L of water.
            *   Alternatively, **Thiophanate Methyl** @ 1 g/L of water.
            *   Spray at flowering stage if conditions are humid and favourable for disease development.

*   **Root Rot (Caused by *Rhizoctonia solani* or *Sclerotium rolfsii*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Wilting and drying of plants, often with rotting at the collar region (soil line) and roots.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Seed Treatment:**
            *   **Carbendazim** 1 g/kg seed + **Thiram** 2 g/kg seed.
            *   Alternatively, *Trichoderma viride* @ 4-5 g/kg seed.
        *   **Good Drainage:** Ensure proper field drainage to avoid waterlogging, which favours root rot development.

### 2. Insect Pests

*   **Termites (e.g., *Odontotermes obesus*, *Microtermes obesi*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Plants show wilting and drying, often in patches. Upon examination, roots and the base of the stem are found to be damaged or hollowed out by termites.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Pre-sowing Soil Treatment:**
            *   Apply **Fipronil** 0.3% GR @ 6-8 kg/acre during field preparation and mix well into the soil.
            *   Alternatively, drench the soil with **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC @ 2 L/acre mixed in sufficient water.
        *   **Seed Treatment:**
            *   Treat seeds with **Imidacloprid** 70% WS @ 5-7 ml/kg seed.

### 3. Abiotic Stresses

*   **Water Stress (Drought)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Leaves curl, turn yellow, and eventually dry up. Plants may wilt and die prematurely, especially during critical growth stages (flowering and pod development).
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Timely Irrigation:** Provide light irrigation at critical stages, especially during branching, flowering, and pod development, if rainfall is insufficient.
        *   **Mulching:** Apply organic mulch (e.g., straw, crop residues) to conserve soil moisture and reduce evaporation.
        *   **Drought-Tolerant Varieties:** Cultivate varieties known for drought tolerance.

*   **Nutrient Deficiencies**
    *   **Symptoms:** General poor growth, yellowing, and premature drying of leaves. Severe deficiencies can lead to overall plant decline.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Soil Testing:** Conduct regular soil tests to identify specific nutrient deficiencies.
        *   **Balanced Fertilization:** Apply recommended doses of macro and micronutrients based on soil test results. Ensure adequate phosphorus and potassium.

*   **Heat Stress**
    *   **Symptoms:** High temperatures, especially during flowering and pod development, can lead to flower drop, poor pod setting, and premature drying of plants.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Timely Sowing:** Sow Bengal Gram at the optimal time (usually October-November in Haryana) to ensure that the reproductive stages occur during cooler periods, avoiding peak summer heat.
        *   **Heat-Tolerant Varieties:** Choose varieties known to perform better under slightly higher temperatures.

### General Recommendations for Integrated Management:

*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest to reduce inoculum for the next season.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Always prioritize the use of disease-resistant varieties.
*   **Timely Sowing:** Adhere to the recommended sowing window to avoid environmental stresses and reduce disease incidence.
*   **Proper Drainage:** Ensure good drainage in the field to prevent waterlogging, which can exacerbate root diseases.
*   **Regular Field Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your field for early signs of disease or pest infestation to allow for timely intervention.

By adopting these integrated management practices, you can effectively address the "drying up" problem in Bengal Gram and ensure a healthy and productive crop. For specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions, please consult with the agricultural experts at HAU.
