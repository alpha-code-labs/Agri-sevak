As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling sucking pests in Bengal Gram (Chickpea) in Haryana:

Firstly, regarding Psylla:
This is not known to affect Bengal Gram.

For the control of Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips in Bengal Gram, an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is recommended, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods.

**I. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Timely Sowing:** Sow Bengal Gram at the recommended time to avoid peak pest periods. Early-sown crops often escape severe infestations.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove weeds from the field and surrounding areas, as they can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, as it can lead to lush vegetative growth, making plants more susceptible to sucking pests.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available and recommended by HAU, choose varieties known for tolerance or resistance to sucking pests.

**II. Biological Control:**
*   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Protect and encourage natural predators like ladybird beetles, lacewings, syrphid fly larvae, and parasitoids (e.g., *Aphidius colemani* for aphids), which naturally keep pest populations in check. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides unless absolutely necessary.
*   **Biopesticides:** In early stages of infestation or as part of a preventive strategy, consider using entomopathogenic fungi like *Beauveria bassiana* or *Verticillium lecanii* (as per label recommendations).

**III. Chemical Control:**
Chemical intervention should be considered when pest populations exceed economic threshold levels (ETL). Always ensure thorough spray coverage. Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

**A. Seed Treatment (for early protection against sucking pests):**
*   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** 5-7 ml per kg of seed.
*   **Thiamethoxam 25% FS:** 3-5 g per kg of seed.

**B. Foliar Spray (when pests appear and reach ETL):**
Apply insecticides with sufficient water volume (typically 200-300 litres per acre, depending on crop canopy) for effective coverage.

*   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** 125 ml per acre.
*   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** 50-100 g per acre.
*   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** 50-100 g per acre.
*   **Flonicamid 50% WG:** 60 g per acre (highly effective against aphids and whiteflies).
*   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** 500-600 ml per acre (primarily for whitefly nymphs).
*   **Fipronil 5% SC:** 400-600 ml per acre (effective against thrips and other sucking pests).
*   **Dimethoate 30% EC:** 330-660 ml per acre.
*   **Oxydemeton-methyl 25% EC:** 400 ml per acre.
*   **Thiomethoxam 12.6% + Lambda-cyhalothrin 9.5% ZC:** 125 ml per acre (pre-mix for broad-spectrum control).

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the insecticide label carefully, including dosage, timing, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Monitor fields regularly to assess pest populations and the effectiveness of control measures.
*   Consult with your local HAU extension specialist for the most current recommendations specific to your region and prevailing pest situation.
