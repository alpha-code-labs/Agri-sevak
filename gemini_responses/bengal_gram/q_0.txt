As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Bengal Gram (Chickpea) in Haryana.

Effective management of fungal diseases in Bengal Gram requires an integrated approach combining cultural practices with timely and appropriate chemical interventions.

**General Cultural Practices for Fungal Disease Management:**

*   **Resistant Varieties:** Always choose disease-resistant or tolerant varieties recommended for Haryana.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice a 2-3 year crop rotation with non-host crops to reduce inoculum build-up in the soil.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected crop debris after harvest to reduce primary inoculum for the next season.
*   **Optimum Sowing Time:** Sow at the recommended time to avoid periods conducive to disease development.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Maintain recommended plant spacing to ensure good air circulation, which reduces humidity and fungal growth.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can make plants more susceptible to certain fungal diseases.
*   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds with recommended fungicides before sowing to protect against seed-borne and early-season soil-borne pathogens.

**Specific Control Measures for Fungal Diseases in Bengal Gram:**

1.  **Alternaria Blight (Caused by *Alternaria alternata* or *A. ciceri*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Small, circular to irregular, dark brown spots on leaves, stems, and pods, often with concentric rings.
    *   **Control:**
        *   Foliar spray at the appearance of symptoms and repeat at 10-15 day intervals if the disease persists.
        *   **Mancozeb 75% WP** at 2.0-2.5 kg/acre (dissolved in 500-600 L of water).
        *   **Chlorothalonil 75% WP** at 1.0-1.25 kg/acre (dissolved in 500-600 L of water).
        *   **Propiconazole 25% EC** at 200-250 ml/acre (dissolved in 500-600 L of water).

2.  **Anthracnose (Caused by *Colletotrichum truncatum*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Dark brown to black lesions with purplish margins on leaves, stems, and pods. Sunken lesions on pods can lead to seed infection.
    *   **Control:**
        *   Seed treatment is crucial: **Carbendazim 50% WP** at 2.0 g/kg seed.
        *   Foliar spray at the appearance of symptoms and repeat at 10-15 day intervals.
        *   **Carbendazim 50% WP** at 500 g/acre (dissolved in 500-600 L of water).
        *   **Mancozeb 75% WP** at 2.0-2.5 kg/acre (dissolved in 500-600 L of water).
        *   **Tebuconazole 25.9% EC** at 250-300 ml/acre (dissolved in 500-600 L of water).

3.  **Blast**
    *   This is not known to affect Bengal Gram.

4.  **Blight (Focus on Ascochyta Blight, caused by *Ascochyta rabiei*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Circular, water-soaked lesions on leaves, stems, and pods, often with dark margins and tiny black dots (pycnidia) in the center. Can cause severe defoliation and stem breakage.
    *   **Control:**
        *   Use resistant varieties.
        *   Seed treatment is highly recommended: **Carbendazim 50% WP** at 2.0 g/kg seed or **Mancozeb 75% WP** at 2.5 g/kg seed.
        *   Foliar spray at the first sign of disease, especially during cool, wet weather, and repeat at 10-15 day intervals.
        *   **Chlorothalonil 75% WP** at 1.0-1.25 kg/acre (dissolved in 500-600 L of water).
        *   **Mancozeb 75% WP** at 2.0-2.5 kg/acre (dissolved in 500-600 L of water).
        *   **Propiconazole 25% EC** at 200-250 ml/acre (dissolved in 500-600 L of water).

5.  **Brown spot**
    *   This is not known to affect Bengal Gram as a distinct primary disease. Symptoms resembling brown spots might be caused by other pathogens like Alternaria, which are addressed separately.

6.  **Downy mildew**
    *   This is not known to affect Bengal Gram.

7.  **Powdery Mildew (Caused by *Leveillula taurica*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** White, powdery patches on the upper and lower surfaces of leaves, stems, and pods.
    *   **Control:**
        *   Foliar spray upon appearance of white powdery patches.
        *   **Sulphur 80% WP** at 2.0-2.5 kg/acre (dissolved in 500-600 L of water).
        *   **Propiconazole 25% EC** at 200-250 ml/acre (dissolved in 500-600 L of water).
        *   **Tebuconazole 25.9% EC** at 250-300 ml/acre (dissolved in 500-600 L of water).

8.  **Grey mildew (Interpreted as Botrytis Grey Mould, caused by *Botrytis cinerea*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Water-soaked lesions on leaves and stems, turning greyish-brown, often with a fluffy grey fungal growth in humid conditions. Can cause severe damage to flowers and pods.
    *   **Control:**
        *   Use wider row spacing and avoid dense planting to improve air circulation.
        *   Foliar spray at flowering and pod development stages, especially during prolonged cloudy and humid weather.
        *   **Carbendazim 50% WP** at 500 g/acre (dissolved in 500-600 L of water).
        *   **Thiophanate Methyl 70% WP** at 500 g/acre (dissolved in 500-600 L of water).
        *   **Propiconazole 25% EC** at 200-250 ml/acre (dissolved in 500-600 L of water).

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the fungicide label for correct dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in pathogens.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and the prevailing disease situation.
