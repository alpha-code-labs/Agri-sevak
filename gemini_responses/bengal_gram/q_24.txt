As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I must clarify that **transplantation is generally not recommended or ideal for Bengal Gram (Chickpea)**. Bengal Gram is a pulse crop that establishes best when direct-sown. Transplantation can cause significant root disturbance, leading to poor establishment, reduced growth, and ultimately lower yields.

Therefore, the following advice pertains to the ideal **direct sowing** practices for Bengal Gram in Haryana:

### Ideal Sowing Time

*   **Optimal Sowing Window:** Mid-October to Mid-November.
    *   **Early Sowing (Mid-October):** Recommended for irrigated conditions and longer-duration varieties. It allows the crop to utilize residual moisture and complete its vegetative growth before the onset of severe winter.
    *   **Timely Sowing (Late October - Early November):** Ideal for most varieties under rainfed or limited irrigation conditions.
    *   **Late Sowing (Mid-November onwards):** Should be avoided as it exposes the crop to higher temperatures during the critical pod-filling stage, leading to forced maturity and significant yield reduction.

### Ideal Sowing Distance

*   **Row-to-Row Distance:**
    *   **30 cm:** For compact, erect varieties and under irrigated conditions.
    *   **45 cm:** For spreading varieties and under rainfed conditions to allow better light penetration and air circulation.
*   **Plant-to-Plant Distance:**
    *   **10-15 cm:** Achieved by maintaining an appropriate seed rate and using a seed drill.
*   **Sowing Depth:**
    *   **5-10 cm:** Crucial for proper germination and establishment. Deeper sowing can delay emergence, while shallower sowing can lead to poor root development and susceptibility to moisture stress.

### Ideal Sowing Process

1.  **Field Preparation:**
    *   One deep ploughing followed by 2-3 harrowing/cultivations to achieve a fine, firm, and well-levelled seedbed. This ensures good seed-to-soil contact and uniform germination.
    *   Remove all crop residues and weeds.
2.  **Seed Treatment:**
    *   **Fungicide Treatment:** Treat seeds with a suitable fungicide to protect against seed-borne and soil-borne diseases like wilt and root rot.
    *   **Insecticide Treatment:** If necessary, treat seeds with an insecticide to protect against early seedling pests.
    *   **Rhizobium Inoculation:** In areas where Bengal Gram has not been grown recently or for the first time, inoculate seeds with a specific *Rhizobium* culture. This enhances nitrogen fixation. Ensure fungicide/insecticide treatment is done first, followed by Rhizobium inoculation just before sowing.
3.  **Fertilizer Application:**
    *   Apply recommended basal doses of Phosphorus (P) and Nitrogen (N) at the time of sowing. For Haryana conditions, typically 20 kg N and 60 kg P2O5 per acre are recommended. Zinc (Zn) deficiency is common, so 10 kg Zinc Sulphate per acre can also be applied.
4.  **Sowing Method:**
    *   Use a **seed drill** for uniform sowing depth and spacing. This is critical for achieving the desired plant population and maximizing yield.
    *   Ensure proper moisture in the seedbed for optimal germination. If the soil is dry, a pre-sowing irrigation (palewa) might be necessary.

By following these direct sowing practices, farmers can ensure healthy crop establishment and achieve optimal yields of Bengal Gram in Haryana.
