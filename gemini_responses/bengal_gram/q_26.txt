As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following information regarding specialized practices in Bengal Gram (Chickpea) cultivation, based on scientific verification and relevance to Haryana's agricultural context:

### Specialized Practices in Bengal Gram

**1. Pruning (Nipping/Topping)**
In Bengal Gram, traditional pruning as practiced in horticultural crops is not a standard procedure. However, a practice known as "nipping" or "topping" is sometimes employed, particularly in indeterminate or semi-determinate varieties. This involves removing the apical growing tip of the plant.

*   **Purpose:** Nipping encourages the development of lateral branches, leading to more flowers and pods, thereby potentially increasing yield. It can also help in managing plant height, preventing lodging (falling over), and improving light penetration within the plant canopy.
*   **Timing:** It is typically done at the vegetative stage, around 30-45 days after sowing, when the plants have attained sufficient growth (e.g., 15-20 cm height or 4-5 branches).
*   **Method:** This can be done manually by pinching off the growing tip or, in larger areas, by allowing controlled grazing with sheep (though this requires careful management to avoid overgrazing).

**2. Desuckering**
This is not known to affect Bengal Gram. Bengal Gram plants do not produce suckers.

**3. Mulching**
Mulching can be a beneficial practice in Bengal Gram cultivation, especially in regions like Haryana where moisture conservation and weed management are crucial.

*   **Purpose:**
    *   **Moisture Conservation:** Reduces evaporation from the soil surface, conserving soil moisture, which is vital for rainfed or limited irrigation conditions. This is particularly important during critical growth stages.
    *   **Weed Suppression:** Acts as a physical barrier, suppressing weed growth and reducing competition for nutrients, water, and light.
    *   **Soil Temperature Regulation:** Helps in moderating soil temperature, protecting roots from extreme heat or cold fluctuations.
    *   **Soil Health Improvement:** Organic mulches decompose over time, adding organic matter to the soil and improving soil structure and fertility.
*   **Materials:** Common mulching materials include crop residues (e.g., wheat straw, paddy straw), dry leaves, or plastic mulches.
*   **Application:** Mulch should be applied after sowing, preferably after germination and initial weeding, ensuring it does not smother young seedlings. A layer of 5-10 cm thickness is generally effective for organic mulches.

**4. Grafting**
This is not known to affect Bengal Gram. Bengal Gram is a seed-propagated annual crop, and grafting is not a standard or practical horticultural practice for its cultivation.

**5. Pollination**
This is not known to affect Bengal Gram. Bengal Gram (Cicer arietinum) is predominantly a self-pollinated crop. The flowers are often cleistogamous (self-pollinating before opening) or chasmogamous (opening but still primarily self-pollinating). While insects may visit the flowers, their role in cross-pollination is generally considered negligible for commercial production. Therefore, specialized practices for managing pollination are not required.
