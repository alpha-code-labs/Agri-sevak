As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the maturity signs, harvesting time, and cutting process for Ash Gourd (Petha) in Haryana:

### Maturity Signs for Ash Gourd (Petha)

For optimal quality, especially for processing into Petha (candy) or for long-term storage, ash gourds should be harvested at full maturity. Key maturity signs include:

*   **Waxy Bloom Development:** The most prominent sign is the development of a thick, white, powdery, waxy coating (pruina) on the fruit surface. Immature fruits are typically green and hairy, while mature fruits are covered in this distinctive white bloom.
*   **Color Change:** The initial green color of the fruit often lightens or becomes duller underneath the waxy bloom as it matures.
*   **Hardness of Rind:** The rind (skin) of the fruit becomes hard and tough. You should not be able to easily puncture it with your thumbnail.
*   **Sound Test:** When tapped gently, a mature ash gourd will produce a dull, hollow sound, similar to a ripe watermelon.
*   **Drying of Tendrils/Stem:** The tendrils near the fruit stem may begin to dry and shrivel. The fruit stem (peduncle) itself will become hard and woody.
*   **Size and Weight:** The fruit will reach its characteristic varietal size and feel heavy for its size.

### Harvesting Time for Ash Gourd (Petha)

The harvesting time depends on the intended use:

*   **For Immature Vegetable Use:** If harvesting for use as a tender vegetable (e.g., for curries), fruits can be harvested earlier, typically when they are 15-20 cm long and still tender, usually around 45-60 days after sowing.
*   **For Mature Fruit (Petha, Storage):** For processing into Petha or for long-term storage, fruits should be harvested at full maturity. This typically occurs **90-120 days after sowing**, depending on the variety and prevailing environmental conditions. Ensure all maturity signs mentioned above are present.
*   **Optimal Conditions:** Harvest should ideally be done on a dry, sunny day to minimize the risk of fungal infections on the cut surface.

### Cutting Process for Ash Gourd (Petha)

The correct cutting process is crucial for maintaining fruit quality and extending storage life:

*   **Tools:** Use a sharp, clean knife or secateurs.
*   **Method:** Carefully cut the fruit from the vine, ensuring that a **short stem (peduncle) of approximately 5-10 cm** is left attached to the fruit. Do not pull or twist the fruit off the vine, as this can damage the fruit or the vine.
*   **Importance of Stem:** Leaving a portion of the stem attached acts as a natural seal, preventing moisture loss and the entry of pathogens, which significantly improves the fruit's post-harvest life and reduces spoilage.
*   **Handling:** Handle the harvested fruits gently to avoid bruising, scratching, or damaging the waxy bloom. Any damage can compromise the fruit's storage potential.
*   **Post-Harvest:** After cutting, place the fruits carefully in a shaded, well-ventilated area. Avoid piling them immediately, especially if they are still warm from the sun. Allow them to cool down before stacking for storage.
