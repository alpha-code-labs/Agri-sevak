Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I confirm that Scale insects and Mealybugs are significant sap-sucking pests that can affect Ash Gourd (Petha) cultivation in Haryana. Effective management requires an integrated approach.

Here's how to control Scale insects and Mealybugs in Ash Gourd:

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Approach:**

1.  **Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
    *   **Regular Monitoring:** Frequently inspect plants, especially the undersides of leaves, stems, and fruit, for early signs of infestation.
    *   **Pruning Infested Parts:** For localized infestations, carefully prune and destroy heavily infested leaves, stems, or fruits to prevent spread.
    *   **High-Pressure Water Spray:** For small infestations, a strong jet of water can dislodge pests from the plant surface. Repeat as necessary.
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the field free of weeds, as they can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
    *   **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to improve air circulation and reduce humidity, which can discourage pest build-up.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Protect beneficial insects like ladybird beetles, lacewings, and parasitic wasps, which are natural predators and parasitoids of scale insects and mealybugs. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficials.
    *   **Neem-based Formulations:** Apply formulations containing **Azadirachtin** (e.g., Neem oil 1500 ppm or 3000 ppm) at the rate of **5 ml/L** of water. This acts as an antifeedant and insect growth regulator, particularly effective against nymphs and early instars.

3.  **Chemical Control (Use only CIBRC approved technical chemicals):**
    For severe infestations, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always rotate chemicals with different modes of action to prevent resistance development. Ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and stems where these pests often hide.

    *   **For Scale Insects and Mealybugs:**
        *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at **1.25 ml/L** of water (or 500 ml per acre). This is an insect growth regulator, effective against nymphs.
        *   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:** Apply at **0.75 ml/L** of water (or 300 ml per acre). This is a systemic insecticide that moves both upwards and downwards in the plant, providing excellent control of hidden pests.
        *   **Flupyradifurone 200 SL:** Apply at **0.5 ml/L** of water (or 200 ml per acre). This is a systemic insecticide effective against sap-sucking pests.
        *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply at **0.2 g/L** of water (or 80 g per acre). This is a systemic neonicotinoid insecticide.
        *   **Dimethoate 30% EC:** Apply at **1.5-2 ml/L** of water (or 600-800 ml per acre). This is a systemic and contact organophosphate insecticide.

**General Precautions:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and application.
*   Observe the specified pre-harvest interval (PHI) for each chemical to ensure the safety of the produce.
*   Apply insecticides preferably in the evening or early morning to minimize harm to pollinators and beneficial insects.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions.
