As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm the following regarding the diseases you mentioned for Ash Gourd (Petha):

*   **Dieback:** This is not known to affect Ash Gourd (Petha).
*   **Twig blight:** This is not known to affect Ash Gourd (Petha).
*   **Tikka disease:** This is not known to affect Ash Gourd (Petha). (Tikka disease is a common disease of groundnut, not cucurbits like Ash Gourd).

If you are observing symptoms like wilting, drying of vines, or leaf spots on your Ash Gourd plants, it is possible that these are due to other common cucurbit diseases such as powdery mildew, downy mildew, anthracnose, or gummy stem blight, or even nutrient deficiencies or water stress. For accurate diagnosis and control measures, it is recommended to bring a sample to the plant pathology department at HAU or consult with your local agricultural extension officer.
