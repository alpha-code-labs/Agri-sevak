As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in Ash Gourd (Petha) in Haryana:

It is crucial to adopt an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, mechanical, biological, and judicious chemical methods for sustainable pest control.

### 1. Borers (Fruit Borers and Stem Borers)

Borers, such as the cucurbit fruit borer (*Diaphania indica*) and various stem borers, can cause significant damage to Ash Gourd.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural and Mechanical:**
    *   Regularly inspect plants for signs of infestation (e.g., boreholes, wilting stems, damaged fruits).
    *   Collect and destroy infested fruits and plant parts to break the pest life cycle.
    *   Practice field sanitation by removing crop residues after harvest.
    *   Use pheromone traps for monitoring adult moth populations.
*   **Chemical Control (Apply only when necessary, following label instructions):**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC: 0.3 ml per litre of water (or 60 ml per acre).
    *   **Flubendiamide** 20% WG: 0.5 g per litre of water (or 100 g per acre).
    *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG: 0.4 g per litre of water (or 80-100 g per acre).
    *   **Indoxacarb** 14.5% SC: 0.5 ml per litre of water (or 200 ml per acre).

### 2. Caterpillars (Leaf-feeding Caterpillars)

Various lepidopteran caterpillars can feed on the leaves of Ash Gourd, causing defoliation.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural and Mechanical:**
    *   Regularly scout for caterpillars and egg masses. Hand-pick and destroy them in early stages of infestation.
    *   Encourage natural enemies like parasitic wasps and predatory birds.
*   **Chemical Control (Apply only when necessary, following label instructions):**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC: 0.3 ml per litre of water (or 60 ml per acre).
    *   **Flubendiamide** 20% WG: 0.5 g per litre of water (or 100 g per acre).
    *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG: 0.4 g per litre of water (or 80-100 g per acre).
    *   **Indoxacarb** 14.5% SC: 0.5 ml per litre of water (or 200 ml per acre).
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: 1 ml per litre of water (or 200 ml per acre) – use judiciously due to broad-spectrum nature.
    *   **Novaluron** 10% EC: 1.5 ml per litre of water (or 300 ml per acre) – an insect growth regulator.

### 3. Diamondback Moth (*Plutella xylostella*)

This is not known to affect Ash Gourd (Petha). Diamondback moth is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops like cabbage, cauliflower, and mustard.

### 4. Leaf Folder

Leaf folders, such as the cucurbit leaf folder (*Diaphania indica*), can roll or fold leaves and feed from within, hindering photosynthesis.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural and Mechanical:**
    *   Regularly inspect plants and manually remove and destroy folded leaves containing larvae.
    *   Maintain field hygiene.
*   **Chemical Control (Apply only when necessary, following label instructions):**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC: 0.3 ml per litre of water (or 60 ml per acre).
    *   **Flubendiamide** 20% WG: 0.5 g per litre of water (or 100 g per acre).
    *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG: 0.4 g per litre of water (or 80-100 g per acre).
    *   **Indoxacarb** 14.5% SC: 0.5 ml per litre of water (or 200 ml per acre).

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the pesticide label, including dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Rotate different classes of insecticides to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.
*   Consult your local agricultural extension officer for the most current and specific recommendations for your region and crop stage.
