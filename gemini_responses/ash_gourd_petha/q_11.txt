As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in Ash Gourd (Petha) in Haryana:

**Weevils:**
This is not known to affect Ash Gourd (Petha) as a significant pest in Haryana.

**Sawflies:**
This is not known to affect Ash Gourd (Petha).

**Beetles (e.g., Red Pumpkin Beetle, Leaf Beetles):**
Beetles, particularly the Red Pumpkin Beetle (Aulacophora foveicollis), are common and significant pests of Ash Gourd, especially during the seedling and early vegetative stages. They feed on leaves, flowers, and young fruits, causing considerable damage.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Beetles:**

1.  **Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Keep the field free of weeds and crop residues, which can harbor pests.
    *   **Early Sowing:** Sowing the crop early can help escape the peak incidence of beetles.
    *   **Hand-picking:** In small areas, adult beetles can be hand-picked, especially during the cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening), and destroyed.
    *   **Physical Barriers:** Covering young seedlings with fine nets or cloth can protect them from initial beetle attack.
    *   **Ash/Neem Cake Application:** Dusting young plants with wood ash or neem cake powder can act as a deterrent.

2.  **Chemical Control:**
    If the beetle population is high and causing economic damage, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always ensure thorough coverage of the plant foliage.

    *   **Malathion** 50% EC at a rate of 1.0 - 1.5 litres per acre (or 2-3 ml per litre of water).
    *   **Carbaryl** 50% WP at a rate of 1.0 - 1.2 kg per acre (or 2-2.5 g per litre of water).
    *   **Cypermethrin** 25% EC at a rate of 200-250 ml per acre (or 0.4-0.5 ml per litre of water).
    *   **Fipronil** 5% SC at a rate of 400-600 ml per acre (or 0.8-1.2 ml per litre of water).

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label, including dosage, application method, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer for the most current and specific recommendations for your region and situation.
