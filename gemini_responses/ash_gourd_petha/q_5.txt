As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide scientifically verified advice for controlling these conditions in Ash Gourd (Petha) in Haryana.

It's important to note that an integrated approach combining cultural practices, sanitation, and judicious use of CIBRC-approved chemicals is most effective for disease management.

**1. Scab (Caused by *Cladosporium cucumerinum*)**
This fungal disease can affect Ash Gourd, causing sunken spots on fruits, leaves, and stems.
*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Use disease-free seeds.
    *   Practice crop rotation with non-cucurbit crops for at least 2-3 years.
    *   Ensure good air circulation by proper plant spacing and pruning of excess foliage.
    *   Remove and destroy infected plant debris promptly to reduce inoculum.
*   **Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
    *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2.5 kg/acre or 2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Chlorothalonil** (75% WP) at 2 kg/acre or 2 g/L of water.
    *   **Carbendazim** (50% WP) at 0.5 kg/acre or 0.5 g/L of water.
    *   Apply at the first sign of symptoms and repeat as per label instructions, typically at 7-10 day intervals, rotating fungicides with different modes of action.

**2. Canker and Gummosis (Often associated with Gummy Stem Blight, caused by *Didymella bryoniae* or *Stagonosporopsis cucurbitacearum*)**
Canker refers to sunken lesions on stems, often accompanied by gum exudation (gummosis). Gummosis is a symptom where sticky sap or gum oozes from the plant, which can be caused by various factors including fungal diseases like gummy stem blight, insect damage, or physiological stress. In Ash Gourd, these symptoms are frequently linked to Gummy Stem Blight.
*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Use resistant varieties if available.
    *   Practice crop rotation with non-cucurbit crops.
    *   Ensure proper field sanitation, removing and destroying infected plant parts immediately.
    *   Avoid overhead irrigation, which can spread spores, and irrigate in the morning to allow foliage to dry quickly.
    *   Maintain optimal plant nutrition to enhance plant vigor and resistance.
*   **Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
    *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2.5 kg/acre or 2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Chlorothalonil** (75% WP) at 2 kg/acre or 2 g/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC) at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Difenoconazole** (25% EC) at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Copper Oxychloride** (50% WP) at 2.5 kg/acre or 2.5 g/L of water (can also help manage bacterial issues if present).
    *   Apply preventively or at the first sign of symptoms, rotating fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

**3. Lichen**
This is not known to affect Ash Gourd (Petha). Lichens are symbiotic organisms that typically grow on stable surfaces like tree bark or rocks and are generally non-parasitic. They do not cause disease or significant harm to annual crops like Ash Gourd.
