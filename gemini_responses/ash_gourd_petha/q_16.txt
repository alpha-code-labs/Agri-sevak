As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following fertilizer doses for Ash Gourd (Petha) cultivation in Haryana. It is always advisable to conduct a soil test to determine the precise nutrient requirements for your specific field conditions.

**General NPK Recommendation for Ash Gourd (Petha):**
Based on typical soil conditions in Haryana, a general recommendation for Ash Gourd is:
*   Nitrogen (N): 80-100 kg/acre
*   Phosphorus (P2O5): 60 kg/acre
*   Potassium (K2O): 60 kg/acre
*   Sulphur (S): 20 kg/acre (if not supplied by other fertilizers)

The following breakdown provides the recommended doses for the specific fertilizers you mentioned:

**Recommended Fertilizer Doses for Ash Gourd (Petha) per Acre:**

1.  **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP):**
    *   **Recommended Dose:** Approximately **130-135 kg/acre**.
    *   **Application:** Apply the entire quantity as a basal dose at the time of field preparation or planting. This provides approximately 23.5 kg N and 60 kg P2O5.

2.  **Muriate of Potash (MOP) / Potash:**
    *   **Recommended Dose:** Approximately **100 kg/acre**.
    *   **Application:** Apply half of the quantity (50 kg/acre) as a basal dose at planting. Apply the remaining half (50 kg/acre) at the time of flowering or early fruit set. This provides 60 kg K2O.

3.  **Urea:**
    *   **Recommended Dose:** Approximately **120-125 kg/acre**.
    *   **Application:** This quantity is calculated to supplement the Nitrogen provided by DAP. Apply in 2-3 split doses:
        *   First split: 1/3rd of the dose (approx. 40-42 kg/acre) at planting.
        *   Second split: 1/3rd of the dose (approx. 40-42 kg/acre) at the time of flowering.
        *   Third split: 1/3rd of the dose (approx. 40-42 kg/acre) at the time of fruit setting.

4.  **Elemental Sulphur (90%):**
    *   **Recommended Dose:** Approximately **20-25 kg/acre**.
    *   **Application:** Apply as a basal dose at the time of field preparation or planting, especially if your soil test indicates sulphur deficiency or if Single Super Phosphate (SSP) is not used.

**Alternative and Supplementary Fertilizers:**

*   **Single Super Phosphate (SSP):**
    *   **Recommended Dose:** If **SSP** is used instead of DAP for Phosphorus, apply approximately **375 kg/acre**.
    *   **Application:** Apply the entire quantity as a basal dose. This provides 60 kg P2O5 and approximately 41 kg Sulphur. If SSP is used, the Urea dose would need to be increased to approximately **170-175 kg/acre** (as SSP provides no Nitrogen), and additional elemental sulphur might not be required.

*   **Nano-Urea (Liquid):**
    *   **Recommended Dose:** As a foliar supplement, apply **2-4 ml/L** of water.
    *   **Application:** Apply 2-3 foliar sprays during the vegetative growth and reproductive stages (e.g., at 30-40 days after planting, and again at flowering/fruit set). This can help reduce the requirement for conventional Urea by 25-50%.

*   **Nano-DAP (Liquid):**
    *   **Recommended Dose:** As a foliar supplement, apply **2-4 ml/L** of water.
    *   **Application:** Apply 1-2 foliar sprays during the vegetative and pre-flowering stages to supplement Phosphorus and Nitrogen.

*   **NPK (Complex Fertilizers):**
    *   **Soil Application:** If using a complex NPK fertilizer like **NPK (12:32:16)** as a basal dose, approximately **185-190 kg/acre** can be applied to meet the Phosphorus requirement. Adjust **Urea** and **Muriate of Potash** doses accordingly to balance the remaining N and K requirements.
    *   **Foliar Application:** For general nutrient supplementation, especially during critical growth stages, **NPK (19:19:19)** or similar water-soluble NPK formulations can be sprayed at a concentration of **5 g/L** of water.
