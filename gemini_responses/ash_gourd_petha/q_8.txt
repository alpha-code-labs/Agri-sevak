As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach for controlling sucking pests in Ash Gourd (Petha), combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Sucking Pests in Ash Gourd:**

**1. Cultural Control Measures:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy crop residues and weeds that can harbor pests.
*   **Timely Sowing:** Sow crops at the recommended time to avoid peak pest incidence periods.
*   **Use of Yellow Sticky Traps:** Install yellow sticky traps (10-15 traps per acre) to monitor and trap adult whiteflies, aphids, and leafhoppers.
*   **Mulching:** Use silver-colored plastic mulch to repel aphids and whiteflies, especially in the early stages of crop growth.
*   **Water Management:** Avoid water stress, as stressed plants are more susceptible to pest attacks.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Maintain balanced fertilization. Excessive nitrogen can lead to lush growth, making plants more attractive to sucking pests.

**2. Biological Control Measures:**
*   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Protect and encourage natural predators like ladybird beetles, lacewings, hoverfly larvae, and parasitic wasps (e.g., *Encarsia formosa* for whiteflies) by minimizing broad-spectrum insecticide use.
*   **Biopesticides:**
    *   **Beauveria bassiana** (fungal formulation): Apply at 2.5 kg/acre or 5 g/L of water, especially during high humidity, for control of whiteflies, aphids, and thrips.
    *   **Verticillium lecanii** (fungal formulation): Apply at 2.5 kg/acre or 5 g/L of water, effective against aphids and whiteflies.
    *   **Neem-based formulations (Azadirachtin 1500 ppm or 3000 ppm):** Apply at 2-5 ml/L of water. These act as antifeedants and growth disruptors, effective against nymphs and adults of various sucking pests.

**3. Chemical Control Measures (Use only when pest incidence crosses Economic Threshold Level):**
When chemical intervention is necessary, rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development. Always ensure thorough spray coverage.

*   **For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips:**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water (or 125-250 ml/acre).
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at 0.2-0.4 g/L of water (or 100-200 g/acre).
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply at 0.2-0.4 g/L of water (or 100-200 g/acre).
    *   **Fipronil 5% SC:** Apply at 1.5-2.0 ml/L of water (or 300-400 ml/acre).
    *   **Diafenthiuron 50% WP:** Apply at 1.0-1.2 g/L of water (or 500-600 g/acre).
    *   **Flonicamid 50% WG:** Apply at 0.3-0.4 g/L of water (or 150-200 g/acre), specifically effective against aphids and whiteflies.
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at 1.0-1.2 ml/L of water (or 400-500 ml/acre), primarily effective against whitefly nymphs as an insect growth regulator.
    *   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** Apply at 0.5-0.7 ml/L of water (or 200-280 ml/acre), effective against whiteflies and mites.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label, including dosage, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Ensure proper spray equipment calibration and coverage.
*   Spray during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.

**Regarding Psylla:**
This is not known to affect Ash Gourd (Petha).
