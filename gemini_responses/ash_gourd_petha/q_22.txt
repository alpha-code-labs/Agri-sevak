    *   Ash Gourd is primarily grown by direct seeding.

    *   Seeds should be sown at a depth of 2-3 cm.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   **For ground trailing:**
        *   Row-to-row: 2.5 - 3.5 meters
        *   Plant-to-plant: 1.0 - 1.5 meters
    *   **For training on trellises/pandals:**
        *   Row-to-row: 2.0 - 2.5 meters
        *   Plant-to-plant: 0.6 - 1.0 meters
    *   **For pit method:** Sow 3-4 seeds per pit at the recommended pit spacing (e.g., 2.5-3.5 m x 1.0-1.5 m), and thin to 2 healthy plants after germination.
