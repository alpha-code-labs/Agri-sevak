As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), here are the scientifically verified recommendations for the use of growth regulators and boron in Ash Gourd (Petha) for Haryana conditions:

*   **Ethephon** (Technical name for Ethrel)
    *   **Purpose:** To increase the number of female flowers, which leads to higher fruit set and ultimately increased yield.
    *   **Dose:** Apply **Ethephon** (39% SL formulation) at 0.5-0.75 ml per litre of water (equivalent to 200-300 ppm active ingredient).
    *   **Timing:** Spray at the 2-4 true leaf stage of the plant. A second spray can be given 7-10 days after the first, if needed, depending on the plant's response and flowering pattern.
    *   **Note:** Ensure thorough and uniform coverage of the foliage for best results.

*   **2,4-D**
    *   **Recommendation:** **2,4-D** is primarily a synthetic auxin widely used as a herbicide. It is **not recommended** for use as a growth regulator in Ash Gourd (Petha) due to its high risk of phytotoxicity and potential for severe crop damage even at very low concentrations. Its application for growth regulation in cucurbits is not a standard or safe practice.

*   **Boron** (as **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate**)
    *   **Purpose:** Boron is an essential micronutrient critical for pollen germination, fertilization, fruit set, and overall fruit development. Its deficiency can lead to poor fruit set, malformed fruits, and reduced yield.
    *   **Dose:** Apply **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (20.5% Boron) at 0.5-1.0 gram per litre of water (0.05-0.1% solution).
    *   **Timing:** Foliar spray at the pre-flowering stage and again at the early fruit set stage.
    *   **Note:** Ensure even coverage of the plant canopy. If soil tests indicate severe boron deficiency, a soil application of 1-2 kg of borax (sodium tetraborate decahydrate) per acre can be considered, but foliar application is generally more efficient for quick correction in cucurbits.
