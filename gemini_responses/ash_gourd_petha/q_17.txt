As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU), Hisar, here are the recommended doses for Organic Manure (FYM, Vermicompost, and Sagarika) for Ash Gourd (Petha) cultivation in Haryana:

It is crucial to incorporate organic manures thoroughly into the soil during land preparation to enhance soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability.

*   **Farm Yard Manure (FYM):**
    *   Apply **15-20 tonnes per acre** of well-decomposed FYM at least 2-3 weeks before sowing or transplanting. Ensure the FYM is fully decomposed to avoid pest issues and nutrient immobilization.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   Apply **4-5 tonnes per acre** during land preparation. Vermicompost can be used as a standalone organic amendment or to supplement FYM. If used in conjunction with FYM, the FYM dose can be slightly reduced (e.g., 10-12 tonnes FYM + 2-3 tonnes Vermicompost).

*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract-based Biostimulant):**
    *   Sagarika is a biostimulant and not a bulk organic manure. It is applied in smaller quantities to promote plant growth and nutrient uptake.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Mix **2-3 ml per litre of water** and spray at critical growth stages:
        *   First spray: 20-25 days after sowing/transplanting (vegetative growth stage).
        *   Second spray: At pre-flowering stage.
        *   Third spray: At fruit development stage.
    *   **Soil Application/Drench/Drip:** Apply **1-2 litres per acre** mixed with irrigation water or as a drench, typically at early growth stages and repeated as per product guidelines or crop need.

These recommendations are general guidelines. For precise nutrient management, a soil test is highly recommended to determine specific deficiencies and tailor the organic manure application accordingly.
