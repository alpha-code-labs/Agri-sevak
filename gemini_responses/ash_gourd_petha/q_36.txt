As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified practices to improve yield, fruit quality, and storage life for Ash Gourd (Petha) in Haryana:

### I. Improving Yield

1.  **Variety Selection:** Choose high-yielding, locally adapted varieties recommended by HAU or ICAR for Haryana's agro-climatic conditions.
2.  **Soil Preparation:**
    *   Ensure well-drained, fertile loamy soils with a pH range of 6.0-7.0.
    *   Incorporate 10-15 tonnes of well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) per acre during land preparation to improve soil structure and fertility.
3.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Nitrogen (N):** Apply 40-50 kg N per acre. Apply 1/3rd at planting, 1/3rd at vining, and 1/3rd at fruit set. Common source: **Urea**.
    *   **Phosphorus (P):** Apply 20-25 kg P2O5 per acre as a basal dose. Common sources: **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** or **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)**.
    *   **Potassium (K):** Apply 20-25 kg K2O per acre. Apply 1/2 as basal and 1/2 at fruit set. Common source: **Muriate of Potash (MOP)**.
    *   **Micronutrients:** Based on soil test reports, apply foliar sprays of micronutrient mixtures containing Boron, Zinc, and Manganese if deficiencies are observed.
4.  **Water Management:**
    *   Provide consistent irrigation, especially during critical stages like flowering and fruit development.
    *   Avoid waterlogging, which can lead to root diseases. Drip irrigation is highly efficient and recommended.
5.  **Planting Density:** Maintain optimal spacing, typically 2.5-3.0 meters between rows and 1.0-1.5 meters between plants within a row, to ensure adequate light and air circulation.
6.  **Pollination:** Ensure adequate pollinator activity (primarily bees). Consider placing beehives near the field to enhance fruit set.
7.  **Training and Pruning:**
    *   Train vines on trellises or pandals for better light interception, air circulation, and easier harvesting, which can significantly increase yield and quality.
    *   Remove diseased, damaged, or unproductive branches to redirect energy to fruit development.
8.  **Weed Control:** Implement timely manual weeding or inter-cultivation to minimize weed competition, especially during the early growth stages of the crop.

### II. Improving Fruit Quality

1.  **Balanced Nutrition:**
    *   Adequate **Potassium** (from **Muriate of Potash (MOP)**) is crucial for fruit size, sweetness, and firmness. Ensure the second dose is applied at fruit set.
    *   **Calcium** (e.g., through **Calcium Nitrate**) can improve fruit firmness and reduce physiological disorders like blossom end rot. Apply 2-3 foliar sprays of 0.5% **Calcium Nitrate** solution during fruit development.
    *   **Boron** (e.g., through **Borax** or **Solubor**) is essential for proper fruit set and development, preventing misshapen fruits. A foliar spray of 0.1% **Boron** during flowering can be beneficial.
2.  **Consistent Moisture:** Avoid extreme fluctuations in soil moisture, which can lead to fruit cracking, uneven ripening, or misshapen fruits. Maintain uniform soil moisture.
3.  **Timely Harvesting:** Harvest fruits at their physiological maturity when they have attained full size, characteristic color, and a prominent waxy coating. Immature fruits will have poor quality, taste, and storage potential.
4.  **Pest and Disease Management:** Implement Integrated Pest and Disease Management (IPM) strategies to prevent damage from fruit borers, sucking pests, and fungal diseases that can compromise fruit appearance and internal quality.

### III. Improving Storage Life

1.  **Harvesting at Full Maturity:** This is the most critical factor for extending storage life. Harvest fruits when they are fully mature, indicated by a thick, hard rind and a prominent white waxy bloom. Immature fruits shrivel quickly and are prone to spoilage.
2.  **Careful Handling:** Handle fruits gently during harvesting, sorting, and transport to prevent cuts, bruises, and abrasions. Physical damage serves as entry points for pathogens and accelerates spoilage.
3.  **Pre-cooling (if feasible):** If resources permit, rapidly cool fruits immediately after harvest to remove field heat. This slows down respiration and metabolic processes, extending shelf life.
4.  **Curing:** Ash Gourd generally does not require specific curing like some other cucurbits due to its naturally thick rind. However, ensuring the fruits are dry and free from surface moisture before storage is important.
5.  **Optimal Storage Conditions:**
    *   Store fruits in a cool, dry, well-ventilated place.
    *   The optimal storage temperature is around 10-15°C.
    *   Relative humidity should be maintained at 70-75%.
    *   Avoid direct sunlight and extreme temperature fluctuations.
6.  **Sanitation:** Keep the storage area clean and free from debris. Regularly inspect stored fruits and promptly remove any damaged, diseased, or rotting ones to prevent the spread of spoilage to healthy fruits.
7.  **Stacking:** Stack fruits in a single layer or in well-ventilated crates to ensure good air circulation and prevent pressure damage, which can lead to bruising and rot.
