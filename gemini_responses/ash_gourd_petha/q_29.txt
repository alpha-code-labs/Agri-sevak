Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding dropping in Ash Gourd (Petha). While 'Tinda dropping' and 'Boll dropping' are not terms specifically associated with Ash Gourd (Petha) – as Tinda is a different crop (*Praecitrullus fistulosus*) and bolls are characteristic of cotton – the issue of flower and fruit drop is a common concern in Ash Gourd cultivation. This can significantly reduce yield.

Flower and fruit drop in Ash Gourd is often a physiological response to various stresses or imbalances. Here's a scientifically verified approach to control it:

### I. Agronomic Management (Preventive & Cultural Practices)

1.  **Optimal Water Management:**
    *   Maintain consistent soil moisture, especially during flowering and fruit development.
    *   Avoid both waterlogging and severe drought stress, as both can lead to dropping.
    *   Irrigate deeply but less frequently, allowing the topsoil to dry slightly between irrigations.

2.  **Balanced Nutrition:**
    *   Ensure a balanced supply of macro and micronutrients. Excessive nitrogen can promote vegetative growth at the expense of reproductive growth, leading to flower drop.
    *   Phosphorus and Potassium are crucial for flowering and fruiting.

3.  **Pollination Enhancement:**
    *   Ash Gourd is monoecious (separate male and female flowers on the same plant) and requires insect pollination, primarily by bees.
    *   Encourage pollinator activity by avoiding insecticide sprays during peak flowering hours (morning).
    *   Consider placing bee hives near the field if natural pollinator populations are low.
    *   In cases of poor natural pollination, hand pollination can be done by transferring pollen from male flowers to female flowers in the morning.

4.  **Temperature Management:**
    *   Extreme temperatures (very high or very low) during flowering can lead to pollen sterility and flower drop. Ash Gourd thrives in temperatures between 25-35°C.
    *   Provide light shade during extreme summer heat if feasible for small plots.

5.  **Pest and Disease Control:**
    *   Keep the crop healthy by managing pests and diseases effectively. A stressed plant is more prone to dropping.

### II. Nutritional Management (Micronutrients)

Deficiencies of certain micronutrients, particularly Boron and Calcium, can contribute to flower and fruit drop.

*   **Boron:** Essential for pollen germination, pollen tube growth, and fruit set.
    *   Apply **Boron** (as Borax or Solubor) as a foliar spray at 1-2 g/L of water at the pre-flowering and early fruit set stages.
*   **Calcium:** Important for cell wall integrity and fruit development.
    *   Apply **Calcium Nitrate** as a foliar spray at 5 g/L of water during fruit development.

### III. Chemical Interventions (Plant Growth Regulators - PGRs)

Plant Growth Regulators can be effective in reducing flower and fruit drop by influencing hormonal balance.

*   **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA):**
    *   **Naphthalene Acetic Acid** is a synthetic auxin widely used to prevent flower and fruit drop.
    *   Apply **Naphthalene Acetic Acid** at a concentration of 10-20 ppm (0.01-0.02 g/L of water) as a foliar spray.
    *   The first spray should be given at the pre-flowering stage, and a second spray can be given 10-15 days later, targeting early fruit set.
    *   Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and recommended dosage for your specific product.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always use CIBRC approved products and follow the recommended dosages strictly.
*   Spray during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to maximize absorption and minimize phytotoxicity.
*   An integrated approach combining good agronomic practices, balanced nutrition, and judicious use of PGRs will yield the best results.

For specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions, it is always advisable to consult with local agricultural extension officers or HAU experts.
