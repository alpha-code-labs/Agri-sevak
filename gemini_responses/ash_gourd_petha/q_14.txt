As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling soil pests like termites and root-knot nematodes in Ash Gourd (Petha) cultivation in Haryana. Both termites and root-knot nematodes are significant pests that can severely impact Ash Gourd yield and plant health.

It is crucial to adopt an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods for effective and sustainable control.

### 1. Termite Control (Odontotermes obesus, Microtermes obesi, etc.)

Termites can cause significant damage by feeding on roots and the base of the stem, leading to wilting, stunted growth, and even plant death, especially in young Ash Gourd plants.

**A. Cultural and Mechanical Methods:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove all crop residues, stubble, and woody debris from the field before planting, as these can serve as food sources and breeding sites for termites.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** Ploughing the field deeply during summer exposes termite colonies to sunlight and predators, disrupting their nests.
*   **Avoid Organic Matter Accumulation:** Do not leave large quantities of undecomposed organic matter on the soil surface, which can attract termites.
*   **Proper Irrigation:** Maintain adequate soil moisture, as termites generally prefer drier conditions. However, avoid waterlogging.

**B. Chemical Control (Pre-planting/At planting):**
For severe infestations, chemical control may be necessary. Always follow label instructions and safety precautions.

*   **Soil Application (Pre-planting/At planting):**
    *   **Fipronil 0.3% GR:** Apply 10-15 kg/acre by broadcasting and incorporating into the soil before planting or at the time of sowing/transplanting.
    *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC:** Mix 2-2.5 litres/acre in sufficient water and apply as a drench around the root zone of plants or incorporate into the soil before planting.

### 2. Nematode (Root-knot) Control (Meloidogyne spp.)

Root-knot nematodes are a major threat to Ash Gourd, causing characteristic galls or knots on the roots. This impairs water and nutrient uptake, leading to stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, wilting, reduced fruit size, and significant yield losses.

**A. Cultural and Mechanical Methods:**
*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate Ash Gourd with non-host crops like cereals (e.g., maize, sorghum, wheat) for at least 2-3 years. Avoid continuous cultivation of susceptible crops.
*   **Summer Ploughing/Solarization:** Deep ploughing during hot summer months exposes nematode eggs and larvae to lethal temperatures. Soil solarization (covering moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks during peak summer) can effectively reduce nematode populations in the topsoil.
*   **Use of Healthy Seedlings:** Ensure that seedlings used for transplanting are free from nematode infestation.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest to prevent nematode carry-over.

**B. Biological Control:**
*   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost at 10-15 tonnes/acre.
*   **Neem Cake:** Apply Neem cake at 200-400 kg/acre and incorporate it into the soil 2-3 weeks before planting. Neem cake releases compounds that are toxic to nematodes and also promotes beneficial soil microbes.
*   **Bio-nematicides:**
    *   **Purpureocillium lilacinum (formerly Paecilomyces lilacinus):** Apply as a soil drench or mix with FYM/compost at 2.5-5 kg/acre. This fungus parasitizes nematode eggs and females.
    *   **Trichoderma harzianum/viride:** While primarily a fungicide, it can also help improve soil health and suppress some soil-borne pathogens, indirectly benefiting plants against nematode stress. Apply at 2.5-5 kg/acre mixed with FYM.

**C. Chemical Control (Pre-planting/At planting):**
Chemical nematicides should be used judiciously and as part of an IPM strategy, especially when nematode populations are high (confirmed by soil testing).

*   **Soil Application (Pre-planting/At planting):**
    *   **Carbofuran 3% CG:** Apply 10-15 kg/acre by broadcasting and incorporating into the soil before planting or in furrows at the time of sowing/transplanting.
    *   **Phorate 10% GR:** Apply 4-6 kg/acre by broadcasting and incorporating into the soil before planting or in furrows at the time of sowing/transplanting. (Note: Phorate is highly toxic; handle with extreme care and strictly follow safety guidelines).
    *   **Fluensulfone 2% GR:** Apply 10-15 kg/acre by broadcasting and incorporating into the soil before planting or at the time of sowing/transplanting.

**General Recommendations:**
*   **Soil Testing:** It is highly recommended to get your soil tested for nematode populations before planting, especially if you have a history of nematode problems. This helps in making informed decisions regarding control measures.
*   **Integrated Approach:** Always combine cultural, biological, and chemical methods for sustainable and effective pest management.
*   **Safety Precautions:** When using any chemical pesticide, always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) and strictly follow the instructions and safety guidelines provided on the product label.
*   **Consult Local Experts:** For specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions, always consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts.
