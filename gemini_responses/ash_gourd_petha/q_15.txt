Dear farmer,

Based on scientific recommendations for Ash Gourd (Petha) cultivation in Haryana, here is the advice for managing the mentioned pests:

**1. Grasshopper:**
Grasshoppers can cause significant damage by feeding on leaves, especially in young Ash Gourd plants.
*   **Cultural/Mechanical Control:**
    *   Regular field monitoring and hand-picking of grasshoppers, particularly during early morning or late evening, can be effective for small infestations.
    *   Maintain field sanitation to remove weeds that can serve as alternate hosts.
*   **Chemical Control (if infestation is severe):**
    *   Spray with **Malathion** 50% EC at 1.0-1.5 ml/L of water.
    *   Spray with **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   Spray with **Cypermethrin** 25% EC at 0.5 ml/L of water.

**2. Painted bug:**
This is not known to affect Ash Gourd (Petha). Painted bug (Bagrada hilaris) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops like mustard, cabbage, and cauliflower.

**3. Red cotton bug:**
This is not known to affect Ash Gourd (Petha). Red cotton bug (Dysdercus cingulatus) is primarily a pest of cotton and other malvaceous plants.

**4. Black ants:**
While black ants are generally not direct pests that feed on Ash Gourd plants, they can sometimes cause indirect damage by protecting other sap-sucking pests (like aphids or mealybugs) for their honeydew, or by disturbing roots through extensive nesting. If they are causing a nuisance or indirect damage:
*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Identify and control any primary sap-sucking pests that ants might be tending.
    *   Maintain good field sanitation and remove any food sources that attract ants.
*   **Chemical Control (if severe nuisance or direct damage to seedlings/roots):**
    *   Drench around ant nests with **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 2.5 ml/L of water.
    *   Apply bait formulations containing **Fipronil** (e.g., 0.01% bait) around the affected areas, following manufacturer's instructions for dosage.

Always ensure proper safety measures, wear protective gear, and follow the instructions on the pesticide label before application. It is also advisable to consult with your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions.
