As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following for Ash Gourd (Petha) transplantation in Haryana:

### Ideal Transplantation Time

Ash Gourd is a warm-season crop. For optimal growth and yield in Haryana, the ideal transplantation times are:

*   **Spring-Summer Crop:** February - March
*   **Monsoon/Autumn Crop:** June - July

Transplanting should be done when the seedlings are 3-4 weeks old and have developed 2-4 true leaves. Ensure the risk of frost has passed for the spring-summer crop.

### Ideal Transplantation Distance

Ash Gourd is a vigorous vine that requires ample space for proper growth and fruit development. The recommended spacing for ground sprawling cultivation is:

*   **Row to Row:** 2.5 - 3.5 meters
*   **Plant to Plant:** 1.0 - 1.5 meters

This spacing allows for good air circulation, sunlight penetration, and ease of cultural operations.

### Ideal Transplantation Process

1.  **Nursery Raising:**
    *   Sow 1-2 seeds per cell in pro-trays or in well-prepared nursery beds.
    *   Use a sterile, well-draining potting mix.
    *   Ensure adequate moisture and warmth for germination.
    *   Seedlings are ready for transplanting when they are 3-4 weeks old and have 2-4 true leaves.

2.  **Field Preparation:**
    *   Prepare the main field thoroughly by deep ploughing and harrowing to achieve a fine tilth.
    *   Incorporate 20-25 tonnes/acre of well-rotted Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost during land preparation.
    *   Form ridges and furrows or prepare raised beds according to the recommended spacing.

3.  **Hardening Off:**
    *   About 7-10 days before transplanting, gradually expose the seedlings to outdoor conditions (reduced watering, increased sunlight) to acclimatize them and reduce transplant shock.

4.  **Transplanting:**
    *   Transplant seedlings in the late afternoon or on a cloudy day to minimize stress from direct sun.
    *   Dig pits/holes at the recommended spacing on the ridges or beds.
    *   Carefully remove seedlings from the nursery trays/beds, ensuring the root ball remains intact.
    *   Place the seedling in the pit, ensuring the soil level around the stem is the same as it was in the nursery.
    *   Gently firm the soil around the base of the plant to ensure good root-to-soil contact.
    *   Immediately irrigate the field after transplanting to settle the soil around the roots.

5.  **Post-Transplant Care:**
    *   Maintain adequate soil moisture, especially during the initial establishment phase.
    *   Monitor for any signs of pest or disease infestation and take appropriate measures.
