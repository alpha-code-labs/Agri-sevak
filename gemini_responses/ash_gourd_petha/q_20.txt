Namaste, Kisan bhaiyon! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I understand the importance of balanced nutrition for optimal Ash Gourd (Petha) yield and quality. Micronutrient deficiencies can significantly impact crop health.

Before applying any micronutrients, it is highly recommended to conduct a soil test to accurately diagnose the specific deficiencies and their severity. This will help in precise application and avoid unnecessary expenses or potential toxicities.

Here's how to address the common micronutrient deficiencies in Ash Gourd (Petha):

### General Recommendations for Micronutrient Application:

*   **Foliar Application:** Often preferred for quick correction of deficiencies, especially for mobile nutrients or when soil conditions limit uptake. Apply during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to prevent leaf scorching and improve absorption. Ensure good spray coverage.
*   **Soil Application:** Suitable for long-term correction, especially for less mobile nutrients or when severe deficiency is confirmed by soil test. Incorporate into the soil before planting or as a side-dressing.

### Specific Micronutrient Deficiencies and Their Management:

#### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, small leaves (often called 'little leaf'), interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, and sometimes bronzing of older leaves.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray with **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (21% Zn) at 2.5-5 g/L of water.
        *   Alternatively, spray with **Zinc EDTA** (12% Zn) at 0.5-1 g/L of water.
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, starting from 30-40 days after sowing or transplanting.
    *   **Soil Application (if severe deficiency confirmed by soil test):**
        *   Apply **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** at 10-25 kg/acre as a basal application or side-dressed. This application is generally effective for 2-3 years.

#### 2. Iron (Fe) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Prominent interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on the youngest leaves, with veins remaining green. In severe cases, the entire leaf may turn yellow or even white.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray with **Ferrous sulphate** (19% Fe) at 5 g/L of water.
        *   Alternatively, spray with **Ferrous EDTA** (12% Fe) at 1-2 g/L of water.
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 7-10 day intervals, targeting the affected young foliage.

#### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, death of growing points (terminal buds), thickening and cracking of stems and fruit rinds, hollow stems, poor fruit set, and deformed fruits.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray with **Borax** (10.5% B) at 1-2 g/L of water.
        *   Alternatively, spray with **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (20% B) at 0.5-1 g/L of water.
        *   Apply 1-2 sprays, one at the vegetative stage and another at the flowering/fruit initiation stage.
    *   **Soil Application (if severe deficiency confirmed by soil test):**
        *   Apply **Borax** at 2-4 kg/acre as a basal application. *Caution: Boron can be toxic if over-applied, so precise application based on soil test is crucial.*

#### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Blossom end rot in fruits (a common issue in cucurbits like Ash Gourd), death of growing points, stunted root growth, and marginal necrosis (browning) of young leaves.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray with **Calcium chloride** at 5 g/L of water.
        *   Alternatively, spray with **Calcium nitrate** at 5-10 g/L of water.
        *   Start spraying at fruit set and repeat every 7-10 days, especially during periods of rapid fruit development or stress.
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   Apply **Gypsum** (Calcium sulphate) at 200-400 kg/acre or **Calcium nitrate** at 25-50 kg/acre as a basal application, particularly in acidic soils or soils with known calcium deficiency.

#### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, with veins remaining green. In severe cases, the affected areas may turn purplish or reddish-brown.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray with **Magnesium sulphate** at 5 g/L of water.
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, targeting the affected older foliage.
    *   **Soil Application (if severe deficiency confirmed by soil test):**
        *   Apply **Magnesium sulphate** at 10-20 kg/acre as a basal application.

#### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, often appearing as a fine network of green veins against a lighter background. Small necrotic (dead) spots may develop in severe cases.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray with **Manganese sulphate** at 2.5-5 g/L of water.
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, targeting the affected young foliage.
    *   **Soil Application (less common for correction in alkaline soils):**
        *   Apply **Manganese sulphate** at 5-10 kg/acre as a basal application, if soil test indicates severe deficiency and soil pH is not excessively high.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always ensure proper soil moisture before and after soil applications of micronutrients.
*   For foliar sprays, adding a good quality non-ionic spreader/sticker can improve efficacy.
*   Avoid mixing different micronutrient formulations or other pesticides without first checking for compatibility.
*   Monitor your crop regularly for any signs of deficiency or toxicity.
