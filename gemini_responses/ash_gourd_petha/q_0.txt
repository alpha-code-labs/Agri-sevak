As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Ash Gourd (Petha) in Haryana.

**General Cultural Practices for Fungal Disease Management in Ash Gourd:**

Implementing good cultural practices is the first line of defense against most fungal diseases:

*   **Use Disease-Free Seeds:** Always source seeds from reputable suppliers to ensure they are free from seed-borne pathogens.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting ash gourd or other cucurbits in the same field for at least 2-3 years. Rotate with non-host crops like cereals or pulses.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Promptly remove and destroy infected plant debris, leaves, and fruits to reduce inoculum sources.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to improve air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce humidity and fungal growth.
*   **Irrigation Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day. Drip irrigation is preferred. If overhead irrigation is used, do it in the morning to allow foliage to dry quickly.
*   **Balanced Fertilization:** Avoid excessive nitrogen application, which can lead to lush, susceptible growth. Follow soil test recommendations for balanced nutrient application.
*   **Weed Control:** Keep the field free of weeds, as they can act as alternate hosts for pathogens and impede air circulation.

**Specific Control Measures for Fungal Diseases:**

Here are the control measures for the mentioned diseases, focusing on CIBRC approved technical chemical names:

### 1. Alternaria Leaf Spot (Caused by *Alternaria cucumerina*)

This disease causes small, circular, dark brown spots on leaves, which enlarge and may develop concentric rings.

*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
    *   **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Chlorothalonil** at 2 g/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Tebuconazole** at 1 ml/L of water.

### 2. Anthracnose (Caused by *Colletotrichum orbiculare*)

Symptoms include dark, sunken lesions on leaves, stems, and fruits, often with a pinkish spore mass in humid conditions.

*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
    *   **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Carbendazim** at 1 g/L of water.
    *   **Chlorothalonil** at 2 g/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5 ml/L of water.

### 3. Blast

This is not known to affect Ash Gourd (Petha). Blast disease is primarily associated with cereal crops like rice.

### 4. Blight (General, often referring to Gummy Stem Blight caused by *Didymella bryoniae* in cucurbits)

Gummy Stem Blight causes leaf spots, stem cankers with gummy exudates, and fruit rot.

*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
    *   **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Chlorothalonil** at 2 g/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Tebuconazole** at 1 ml/L of water.
    *   **Propineb** at 2.5 g/L of water.

### 5. Brown Spot

This is not known to affect Ash Gourd (Petha) as a distinct, major disease. Symptoms resembling brown spots might be due to other diseases like Alternaria or Anthracnose.

### 6. Downy Mildew (Caused by *Pseudoperonospora cubensis*)

Characterized by angular, yellowish spots on the upper leaf surface, with a purplish-grey, fuzzy growth on the underside, especially in humid conditions.

*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
    *   **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water (as a protective spray).
    *   **Propineb** at 2.5 g/L of water (as a protective spray).
    *   **Dimethomorph** at 1 ml/L of water.
    *   **Fenamidone + Mancozeb** (pre-mix formulation) at 3 g/L of water.
    *   **Cymoxanil + Mancozeb** (pre-mix formulation) at 2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5 ml/L of water.

### 7. Powdery Mildew (Caused by *Podosphaera xanthii* or *Erysiphe cichoracearum*)

Appears as white, powdery patches on the upper and lower surfaces of leaves and stems, leading to premature defoliation.

*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
    *   **Sulphur** (Wettable Sulphur) at 2 g/L of water.
    *   **Dinocarb** at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Myclobutanil** at 0.4 ml/L of water.
    *   **Penconazole** at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Tebuconazole** at 1 ml/L of water.

### 8. Grey Mildew

This is not known to affect Ash Gourd (Petha).

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Rotation of Fungicides:** To prevent the development of fungicide resistance, it is crucial to rotate fungicides with different modes of action.
*   **Timing of Application:** Apply fungicides preventively or at the very first sign of disease symptoms for best efficacy.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough coverage of all plant parts, especially the undersides of leaves.
*   **Safety:** Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the fungicide label regarding dosage, application method, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and safety precautions.
*   **Consult Local Experts:** For specific recommendations tailored to your local conditions and current disease pressure, always consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts.
