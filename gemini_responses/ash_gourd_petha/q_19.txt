Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU), Hisar, I can provide you with scientifically verified advice to address macro-nutrient deficiencies in Ash Gourd (Petha) in Haryana.

The first and most crucial step before applying any fertilizers is to conduct a **soil test**. This will accurately determine the existing nutrient levels in your soil and help tailor the recommendations precisely, preventing over-application or further imbalances.

However, based on common deficiencies observed and general recommendations for Ash Gourd, here's how to address Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium deficiencies:

### General Recommendations for Ash Gourd (Petha)

For optimal growth, Ash Gourd typically requires a balanced supply of macronutrients. The general recommended dose for Ash Gourd in Haryana, in the absence of a soil test, is approximately 80-100 kg Nitrogen (N), 50-60 kg Phosphorus (P2O5), and 60-80 kg Potassium (K2O) per acre.

### Addressing Macro-nutrient Deficiencies

#### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Yellowing of older leaves (starting from the tips and moving inwards), stunted growth, reduced vine length, smaller and fewer fruits, and overall pale green appearance of the plant.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Basal Application:** Apply 1/3 to 1/2 of the total recommended Nitrogen as a basal dose at the time of planting.
    *   **Top-dressing:** The remaining Nitrogen should be applied in 1-2 split doses.
        *   First split: 30-45 days after sowing.
        *   Second split: At the flowering and early fruit development stage.
    *   **For existing deficiency:**
        *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Urea** (46% N) at 20-30 kg/acre as a top-dressing, ensuring it is incorporated into the soil and followed by light irrigation.
        *   **Foliar Spray:** For a quick boost, spray a 1-2% solution of **Urea** (10-20 g of **Urea** per litre of water) on the foliage. Repeat after 7-10 days if necessary.

#### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Dark green or purplish discoloration of older leaves, stunted root development, delayed maturity, poor flowering, and reduced fruit set. Leaves may appear stiff.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Basal Application:** Phosphorus is relatively immobile in the soil, so it is most effective when applied as a basal dose at the time of planting. Apply the entire recommended dose of Phosphorus at this stage.
    *   **For existing deficiency:**
        *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5) at 25-30 kg/acre or **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5) at 75-90 kg/acre as a side-dressing, incorporating it into the soil near the root zone, followed by irrigation.
        *   **Foliar Spray:** While soil application is generally more effective for Phosphorus, a foliar spray of **Monoammonium Phosphate (MAP)** (12% N, 61% P2O5) at 0.5-1% solution (5-10 g/L water) can provide a temporary relief.

#### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Yellowing and browning/scorching of leaf margins (especially older leaves), starting from the tips and progressing inwards. Leaves may appear crinkled. Weak stems, poor fruit development, reduced fruit size, and increased susceptibility to diseases.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Basal and Split Application:** Potassium can be applied as a basal dose (e.g., 50% of the total recommended dose) at planting, with the remaining 50% applied as a top-dressing at the flowering and fruit development stage.
    *   **For existing deficiency:**
        *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** (Potassium Chloride, 60% K2O) at 20-30 kg/acre as a side-dressing, incorporated into the soil, followed by irrigation.
        *   **Foliar Spray:** Spray a 1-2% solution of **Muriate of Potash** or **Sulphate of Potash (SOP)** (Potassium Sulphate, 50% K2O) (10-20 g of fertilizer per litre of water) on the foliage. Repeat after 7-10 days if symptoms persist.

### Important Considerations:

*   **Soil Testing is Key:** Always prioritize soil testing for precise recommendations.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure a balanced application of all macro and micronutrients to prevent induced deficiencies.
*   **Organic Matter:** Incorporating well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost (10-15 tonnes/acre) significantly improves soil health, nutrient availability, and water retention capacity.
*   **Irrigation:** Adequate and timely irrigation is crucial for nutrient uptake by the plants.
*   **Application Timing:** Apply fertilizers when the soil is moist, preferably in the morning or late afternoon, to minimize nutrient loss and plant stress.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively manage macronutrient deficiencies and ensure healthy growth and good yield in your Ash Gourd crop.
