As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend a comprehensive approach to weed management in Ash Gourd (Petha), combining cultural, mechanical, and judicious chemical methods. Effective weed control, especially during the critical initial 30-45 days after sowing, is vital for optimal yield.

**I. Cultural and Mechanical Methods (Highly Recommended for Ash Gourd):**

1.  **Thorough Land Preparation:** Proper ploughing and harrowing before sowing help reduce the initial weed seed bank.
2.  **Hand Weeding:** This is the most effective and safest method for Ash Gourd. Perform 2-3 hand weedings, particularly during the critical period of 30-45 days after sowing, to remove all types of weeds.
3.  **Inter-cultivation:** Light inter-cultivation can be done between rows before the vines spread, taking care not to damage the crop roots.
4.  **Mulching:** Applying organic mulches (e.g., straw, dry leaves) or using plastic mulch can significantly suppress weed growth, conserve soil moisture, and regulate soil temperature.

**II. Chemical Control (Herbicides):**

**A. For Broadleaf and Narrowleaf Weeds (General Control):**

*   **Pre-emergence Application (within 3 days of sowing/transplanting):**
    *   Apply **Pendimethalin** 30% EC at 1.0 kg active ingredient per acre (approximately 3.3 L of product) in 200-300 L of water as a uniform spray on moist soil. This provides control of many annual broadleaf and narrowleaf weeds.
    *   Alternatively, **Fluchloralin** 45% EC can be applied as a pre-plant incorporation (PPI) at 0.75-1.0 kg active ingredient per acre (approximately 1.6-2.2 L of product) before sowing, followed by light incorporation into the soil.

**B. For Narrowleaf Weeds (Grasses) only (Post-emergence):**

*   If grass weeds emerge after crop establishment, selective post-emergence herbicides can be used. Apply when grasses are at the 2-4 leaf stage and Ash Gourd is well established (e.g., 20-30 days after sowing).
    *   **Quizalofop-ethyl** 5% EC at 200-250 ml per acre in 200-300 L of water.
    *   **Fluazifop-P-butyl** 13.4% EC at 500-750 ml per acre in 200-300 L of water.
    *   **Fenoxaprop-P-ethyl** 9.3% EC at 250-300 ml per acre in 200-300 L of water.
*   *Note:* These herbicides are specific for grasses and will not control broadleaf weeds.

**C. For Specific Weeds:**

*   **Amarbail (*Cuscuta* spp.):**
    *   Prevention is paramount. Use certified, clean seeds and avoid planting in fields with a history of Amarbail infestation.
    *   Once Amarbail appears, manual removal of infested plants or plant parts is the most effective method to prevent its spread.
    *   Pre-emergence application of **Pendimethalin** (as mentioned above) can offer some suppression of Amarbail germination.
*   **Bathu (*Chenopodium album*) and Congress grass (*Parthenium hysterophorus*):**
    *   These are broadleaf weeds. Pre-emergence application of **Pendimethalin** or **Fluchloralin** will provide initial control.
    *   For established weeds, manual removal is the safest and most effective method in Ash Gourd, as selective post-emergence broadleaf herbicides are generally not safe for cucurbits.
    *   For severe infestations in inter-row spaces, a shielded application of non-selective herbicides can be done with extreme caution, ensuring no spray drift falls on the Ash Gourd plants.
        *   **Glyphosate** 41% SL at 1.0-1.5 L per acre.
        *   **Paraquat dichloride** 24% SL at 0.5-1.0 L per acre.
*   **Orobanche (*Broomrape*):**
    *   This is not known to affect Ash Gourd (Petha).
*   **Phalaris minor (*Little seed canary grass*):**
    *   This is primarily a weed of winter crops like wheat and is less common in Ash Gourd's typical warm-season cultivation. If present, it is a narrowleaf weed and can be controlled by the pre-emergence herbicides mentioned (e.g., **Pendimethalin**) or post-emergence grass-specific herbicides (e.g., **Quizalofop-ethyl**, **Fluazifop-P-butyl**, **Fenoxaprop-P-ethyl**) as detailed above.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and strictly follow the label instructions of the herbicide product.
*   Ensure proper calibration of spray equipment for uniform application.
*   Apply herbicides on moist soil for better efficacy.
*   Avoid spraying during windy conditions to prevent drift onto the crop.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension specialists for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions.
