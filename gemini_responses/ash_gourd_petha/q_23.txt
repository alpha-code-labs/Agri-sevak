As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified seed and soil treatment processes for Ash Gourd (Petha) cultivation in Haryana:

### Seed Treatment Process for Ash Gourd (Petha)

Seed treatment is crucial for protecting young seedlings from seed-borne and soil-borne diseases and early insect pests, ensuring better germination and stand establishment.

1.  **Fungicidal Treatment (Mandatory):**
    *   To protect against seed-borne and soil-borne fungal diseases like damping-off, seedling blight, and early fungal infections.
    *   Apply **Carbendazim 50% WP** at 2 grams per kilogram of seed.
    *   Alternatively, use **Thiram 75% WS** at 2.5 grams per kilogram of seed.
    *   For a broader spectrum of fungal control, a combination product of **Carbendazim 12% + Mancozeb 63% WP** can be used at 2.5 grams per kilogram of seed.
    *   *Method:* Mix the recommended quantity of fungicide thoroughly with the seeds in a plastic bag or container until all seeds are uniformly coated. Allow to dry slightly before sowing.

2.  **Insecticidal Treatment (Recommended for early pest protection):**
    *   To protect seedlings from early sucking pests like aphids, jassids, and whiteflies for the initial 2-3 weeks after germination.
    *   Apply **Imidacloprid 70% WS** at 5-7 grams per kilogram of seed.
    *   Alternatively, use **Thiamethoxam 30% FS** at 4-5 ml per kilogram of seed.
    *   *Method:* If using both fungicide and insecticide, apply the fungicide first, allow it to dry, and then apply the insecticide. Mix thoroughly to ensure uniform coating.

### Soil Treatment Process for Ash Gourd (Petha)

Soil treatment focuses on improving soil health, managing soil-borne diseases, and controlling nematodes, leading to a healthier root system and robust plant growth.

1.  **Organic Matter Enrichment:**
    *   Incorporate well-decomposed **Farmyard Manure (FYM)** at 10-15 tonnes per acre or **vermicompost** at 2-3 tonnes per acre during the final land preparation. This enhances soil structure, water retention, and microbial activity.

2.  **Biological Control (Highly Recommended):**
    *   **For Soil-borne Fungal Diseases (Damping-off, Root Rot, Wilt):**
        *   Apply **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum** at 2.5 kg per acre.
        *   *Method:* Mix the bio-fungicide with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed FYM or sand. Broadcast this mixture evenly over the field before the final ploughing, or apply it in the planting furrows/pits.
    *   **For Nematode Management (if a known problem):**
        *   Apply **Paecilomyces lilacinus** (or *Purpureocillium lilacinum*) at 2.5 kg per acre.
        *   *Method:* Mix the bio-nematicide with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed FYM or sand and apply it similarly to Trichoderma.

3.  **Chemical Treatment (Optional, for severe soil-borne disease history):**
    *   If there is a history of severe soil-borne diseases, a targeted chemical application can be considered.
    *   **For Damping-off and Root Rot:** A drench with **Propamocarb hydrochloride 72.2% SL** at 2-3 ml per litre of water can be applied around the seed/seedling at the time of sowing or immediately after emergence. This should be used judiciously and preferably in conjunction with biological methods.
