As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding the various rot types affecting Ash Gourd (Petha). These rots can significantly impact yield and plant health. Effective management requires an integrated approach combining cultural practices and judicious use of CIBRC-approved chemicals.

All the rot types you mentioned (Root, Stem, Foot, Collar, Crown, Neck, Black, Fruit, Seed, and Seedling rot) are known to affect Ash Gourd (Petha) and other cucurbits, primarily caused by various fungal and oomycete pathogens.

Here's a comprehensive strategy for their control:

**I. General Management Strategies (Cultural and Preventive)**

These practices are crucial for preventing the onset and spread of rot diseases:

*   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting Ash Gourd or other cucurbits in the same field for at least 2-3 years. Rotate with non-host crops like cereals (wheat, maize) or pulses.
*   **Field Sanitation:**
    *   Remove and destroy all infected plant debris, weeds, and volunteer plants from the field.
    *   Ensure proper disposal of diseased fruits to prevent pathogen spread.
*   **Soil Management:**
    *   **Improve Drainage:** Rots are often exacerbated by waterlogged conditions. Ensure good soil drainage by selecting well-drained fields or preparing raised beds.
    *   **Soil Solarization:** In summer, cover the soil with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks to reduce soil-borne pathogen inoculum.
*   **Seed Selection:**
    *   Use only healthy, certified, disease-free seeds from reputable sources.
    *   Consider resistant or tolerant varieties if available for specific rot diseases.
*   **Planting Practices:**
    *   **Optimum Spacing:** Maintain adequate plant spacing to ensure good air circulation, which reduces humidity around the plants and discourages fungal growth.
    *   **Raised Beds:** Planting on raised beds helps prevent water accumulation around the root zone and collar region.
*   **Water Management:**
    *   Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day, which keeps foliage wet for prolonged periods. Drip irrigation is preferred.
    *   Irrigate in the morning to allow foliage to dry quickly.
    *   Avoid over-irrigation and waterlogging.
*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Provide balanced nutrition. Excessive nitrogen can lead to lush, soft growth more susceptible to disease.
    *   Ensure adequate potassium and calcium, which contribute to plant vigor and disease resistance.
*   **Weed Control:** Keep the field free of weeds, as they can act as alternate hosts for pathogens and impede air circulation.

**II. Specific Chemical Management Strategies**

Chemical control should be integrated with cultural practices. Always follow label instructions for dosage and safety precautions.

**A. Seed Treatment (for Seed Rot and Seedling Rot/Damping-off)**

Treating seeds before sowing is critical to protect against seed-borne and soil-borne pathogens causing seed rot and damping-off.

*   **Fungicidal Seed Treatment:**
    *   **Thiram**: 2-3 g per kg of seed.
    *   **Carbendazim**: 1-2 g per kg of seed.
    *   **Metalaxyl**: 6 g per kg of seed (especially effective against oomycetes like *Pythium* and *Phytophthora*).
    *   **Captan**: 2-3 g per kg of seed.
*   **Biological Seed Treatment:**
    *   **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum**: 4-5 g per kg of seed. This bio-fungicide helps suppress soil-borne pathogens.

**B. Soil Drench / Foliar Spray (for Root, Stem, Foot, Collar, Crown, Neck, Black, and Fruit Rots)**

These applications are for managing rots in established plants. The choice of chemical depends on the suspected pathogen and the type of rot.

*   **For Oomycete Rots (e.g., *Pythium*, *Phytophthora* causing Root, Collar, Foot, Stem, and Fruit Rots):**
    *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride**: Drench the soil around the plant base with 2-3 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Metalaxyl** + **Mancozeb**: Spray or drench with 2-2.5 g per litre of water.
    *   **Fosetyl-aluminium**: Spray or drench with 2-3 g per litre of water.
*   **For Other Fungal Rots (e.g., *Fusarium*, *Sclerotium*, *Rhizoctonia*, *Didymella* causing Stem, Collar, Fruit, and Black Rots):**
    *   **Carbendazim**: Spray or drench with 1-1.5 g per litre of water.
    *   **Thiophanate-methyl**: Spray or drench with 1-1.5 g per litre of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin**: Spray with 0.5-1 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Pyraclostrobin** + **Metiram**: Spray with 2-2.5 g per litre of water.
    *   **Copper oxychloride**: Spray or drench with 2-3 g per litre of water. This also has some efficacy against bacterial rots.
*   **Biological Soil Application/Drench:**
    *   **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum**: Mix 5 kg per acre with 100 kg of Farm Yard Manure (FYM) and apply to the soil, or drench with 5 g per litre of water around the plant base. This helps in continuous suppression of soil-borne pathogens.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Early Detection:** Regularly scout your fields for early signs of disease. Early intervention is key to effective control.
*   **Alternation of Chemicals:** To prevent the development of fungicide resistance, rotate fungicides with different modes of action.
*   **Adherence to Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always observe the specified pre-harvest interval for any chemical applied to ensure the safety of the produce.

By implementing these integrated strategies, you can effectively manage and minimize the impact of various rot diseases in your Ash Gourd (Petha) crop.
