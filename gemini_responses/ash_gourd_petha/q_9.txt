Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling mites (Red spider mite and Rust mite) in Ash Gourd (Petha). Both Red spider mites (*Tetranychus urticae*) and Rust mites (Eriophyid mites) are known pests of cucurbits, including Ash Gourd, and can cause significant damage if not managed effectively.

Effective control involves an integrated approach combining cultural practices, regular monitoring, and judicious use of CIBRC-approved acaricides.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies:**

1.  **Regular Monitoring:** Regularly inspect the underside of leaves for the presence of mites, their eggs, and webbing (for red spider mites). Early detection is crucial for effective control.
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Weed Management:** Remove weeds from and around the field, as they can serve as alternate hosts for mites.
    *   **Proper Irrigation:** Maintain adequate soil moisture. Water-stressed plants are more susceptible to mite infestations. Overhead irrigation can sometimes help dislodge mites, but ensure it doesn't promote fungal diseases.
    *   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy heavily infested leaves or plant parts if the infestation is localized and minor.
3.  **Biological Control:** Encourage natural enemies such as predatory mites (*Amblyseius* species), lacewings, and ladybird beetles. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that can harm these beneficial insects.
4.  **Chemical Control (Acaricides):**
    When mite populations reach damaging levels, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always ensure thorough coverage, especially on the underside of the leaves where mites reside. Rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

Here are some CIBRC-approved technical chemical names and their recommended dosages for mite control in Ash Gourd:

*   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** Apply at 0.5 - 0.75 ml per litre of water.
*   **Propargite 57% EC:** Apply at 1.5 - 2.0 ml per litre of water.
*   **Fenpyroximate 5% SC:** Apply at 1.0 - 1.5 ml per litre of water.
*   **Abamectin 1.9% EC:** Apply at 0.4 - 0.5 ml per litre of water.
*   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP:** Apply at 2.0 - 3.0 g per litre of water. This is particularly effective against rust mites and also helps with powdery mildew.
    *   **Caution:** Do not spray sulphur when temperatures are very high (above 35°C) as it can cause phytotoxicity (leaf burn).
*   **Fenazaquin 10% SC:** Apply at 1.0 - 1.25 ml per litre of water.
*   **Pyridaben 10% WP:** Apply at 1.0 - 1.5 g per litre of water.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label, including the recommended dosage, application method, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and application.
*   Apply sprays during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   Ensure good spray coverage, targeting the undersides of leaves where mites are most prevalent.

By implementing these strategies, you can effectively manage mite populations and protect your Ash Gourd crop.
