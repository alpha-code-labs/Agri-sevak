As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend a systematic approach to address micronutrient deficiencies in Litchi orchards in Haryana. The first and most crucial step is always to conduct a comprehensive soil and leaf tissue analysis to accurately diagnose the specific deficiencies and their severity. This will help in tailoring the most effective and economical management strategy.

Here's how to address common micronutrient deficiencies in Litchi:

### General Recommendations:

*   **Soil and Leaf Tissue Analysis:** Before any application, confirm deficiencies through laboratory testing. This prevents unnecessary applications and potential toxicities.
*   **Foliar Application:** Often preferred for quick correction of micronutrient deficiencies in fruit trees, especially for elements like Zinc, Iron, Boron, and Manganese, as absorption through leaves is rapid.
*   **Soil Application:** Suitable for long-term correction, especially for Calcium and Magnesium, or when deficiencies are severe and persistent.
*   **Timing:** Foliar sprays are best applied during periods of active growth, such as new flush emergence, pre-flowering, and post-fruit set. Avoid spraying during extreme heat or rain.
*   **Water Quality:** Use clean water for preparing spray solutions.
*   **Compatibility:** Always check the compatibility of different chemicals if mixing multiple sprays.

### Specific Micronutrient Deficiencies and Their Management:

#### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Small, narrow leaves (often called 'little leaf'), interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins), reduced shoot growth, and rosetting of leaves.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray with **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (21% Zn) at 0.2-0.5% solution (2-5 g/L water).
        *   Alternatively, use **Zinc EDTA** at 0.1% solution (1 g/L water).
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 15-20 day intervals during active growth flushes.
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   Apply **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** at 10-20 kg/acre, once a year, either broadcast or band applied around the tree basin.

#### 2. Iron (Fe) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Prominent interveinal chlorosis, starting from younger leaves, which may turn almost white in severe cases, while veins remain green.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray with **Ferrous sulphate** (19% Fe) at 0.1-0.2% solution (1-2 g/L water).
        *   Alternatively, use **Iron EDTA** at 0.05-0.1% solution (0.5-1 g/L water), especially effective in alkaline soils.
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals until symptoms disappear.
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   Apply **Ferrous sulphate** at 5-10 kg/acre or **Iron EDTA** at 1-2 kg/acre, particularly beneficial in alkaline soils where iron availability is low.

#### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Dieback of growing points, cracking of fruits, corky tissue development, poor fruit set, and internal browning of fruits.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray with **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (e.g., Solubor) at 0.1-0.2% solution (1-2 g/L water).
        *   Alternatively, use **Sodium tetraborate decahydrate** (Borax) at 0.1-0.2% solution (1-2 g/L water).
        *   Apply one spray before flowering and another at fruit set.
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   Apply **Sodium tetraborate decahydrate** (Borax) at 1-2 kg/acre, once a year.
        *   **Caution:** Boron can be toxic if over-applied. Always adhere to recommended dosages and confirm deficiency through soil testing.

#### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, weak cell walls, poor fruit quality, fruit cracking, and sometimes internal breakdown of fruit tissue. While blossom end rot is less common in Litchi than in other fruits, calcium is vital for fruit development.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray with **Calcium nitrate** at 0.5-1.0% solution (5-10 g/L water).
        *   Alternatively, use **Calcium chloride** at 0.5-1.0% solution (5-10 g/L water).
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays during the fruit development stage.
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   Apply **Gypsum (Calcium sulphate)** at 200-500 kg/acre, depending on soil test results and soil pH. This also helps in improving soil structure.
        *   If soil pH is low, **Calcium carbonate** (agricultural lime) can be applied to raise pH and supply calcium.

#### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis, typically starting from older leaves, often with a characteristic purplish or reddish discoloration in severe cases.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray with **Magnesium sulphate** (Epsom salt) at 0.5-1.0% solution (5-10 g/L water).
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays during active growth periods.
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   Apply **Magnesium sulphate** at 10-20 kg/acre.
        *   If soil pH needs adjustment and magnesium is deficient, **Dolomite (Calcium magnesium carbonate)** can be used.

#### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis, similar to iron deficiency but often with a finer network of green veins, sometimes accompanied by small necrotic spots.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray with **Manganese sulphate** at 0.1-0.2% solution (1-2 g/L water).
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 15-20 day intervals during active growth.
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   Apply **Manganese sulphate** at 5-10 kg/acre.

By following these scientifically verified recommendations and adhering to proper diagnostic procedures, Litchi growers in Haryana can effectively manage micronutrient deficiencies and ensure healthy tree growth and optimal fruit production.
