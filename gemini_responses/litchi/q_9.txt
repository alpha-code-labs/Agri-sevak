As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an integrated pest management (IPM) approach for the effective control of Red Spider Mite and Rust Mite in Litchi orchards in Haryana. This approach combines cultural practices, regular monitoring, and judicious use of CIBRC-approved acaricides.

**1. Identification:**

*   **Red Spider Mite (Tetranychus spp.):** These are tiny, often reddish or yellowish mites visible on the underside of leaves. Infestation leads to yellowing, bronzing, stippling, and in severe cases, fine webbing on leaves and shoots, eventually causing defoliation.
*   **Rust Mite (Eriophyes litchii, Phyllocoptruta litchii):** These are microscopic mites, not visible to the naked eye. Their presence is indicated by characteristic "erineum" patches – velvety, reddish-brown or yellowish growths – on the underside of leaves, young shoots, flowers, and fruits. This can lead to leaf distortion, flower drop, and fruit malformation.

**2. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Pruning:** Regularly prune infested branches and maintain an open canopy to improve air circulation, which can reduce mite populations.
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the orchard floor free of weeds, as many weeds can serve as alternate hosts for mites.
    *   **Water Management:** Ensure proper irrigation. Water-stressed plants are more susceptible to mite infestations. Overhead irrigation can sometimes help dislodge mites.
*   **Biological Control:**
    *   Naturally occurring predatory mites (e.g., *Amblyseius* spp.) and insects (e.g., lacewings) can help suppress mite populations. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

**3. Chemical Control (Acaricides):**

When mite populations reach damaging levels, apply CIBRC-approved acaricides. It is crucial to rotate different classes of acaricides to prevent the development of resistance. Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage, especially the undersides of leaves where mites often reside.

*   **Recommended Acaricides for Red Spider Mite and Rust Mite:**
    *   **Spiromesifen** 22.9% SC: 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Propargite** 57% EC: 1.5-2.0 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Fenpyroximate** 5% SC: 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Abamectin** 1.9% EC: 0.4 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Pyridaben** 10% WP: 1.0 g per litre of water.
    *   **Wettable Sulphur** 80% WP: 2.0-3.0 g per litre of water (particularly effective against rust mites and also has fungicidal properties).

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Rotation:** Always rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development. Do not use the same chemical repeatedly.
*   **Timing:** Apply acaricides at the first sign of infestation. Early morning or late evening sprays are recommended to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure complete and thorough coverage of the plant, especially the undersides of leaves and new flushes.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and application. Follow the instructions on the product label regarding dosage, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
