Namaste! The "drying up" of branches, leaves, fruits, and flowers in Litchi is a common and concerning symptom that can be caused by a variety of factors, both abiotic (environmental) and biotic (diseases and pests). As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I advise a systematic approach to identify the root cause before applying any treatment.

**I. Diagnosis: Observe Carefully**

Before any intervention, it is crucial to observe the specific patterns and associated symptoms:

*   **Pattern of Drying:** Is it affecting entire branches, individual leaves, specific fruits, or the whole tree? Is it sudden or gradual?
*   **Location:** Is it starting from the tips, margins, or base of the plant parts?
*   **Associated Symptoms:** Look for spots, lesions, cankers, gumming, insect holes, webbing, discolouration of bark, or root damage.
*   **Environmental Conditions:** Consider recent weather patterns (drought, heavy rains, heatwave, cold snap), soil moisture, and nutrient application history.

**II. Potential Causes and Management Strategies**

Based on common issues observed in Litchi cultivation in Haryana, here are the likely causes and recommended management strategies:

**A. Abiotic Factors (Environmental/Nutritional Stress)**

These are often the primary culprits for general drying symptoms.

1.  **Water Stress (Deficiency or Excess):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Leaves wilt, turn brown, and dry; branches die back; fruit shrivels and drops. Both severe drought and waterlogging can cause similar symptoms due to impaired water uptake.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Ensure consistent and adequate irrigation, especially during flowering and fruit development. Litchi requires moist, but not waterlogged, soil.
        *   Improve drainage in areas prone to waterlogging.
        *   Apply mulch (straw, dry leaves, black plastic) around the tree base to conserve soil moisture and regulate soil temperature.

2.  **Nutrient Deficiencies:**
    *   **Boron Deficiency:** Common in Litchi, leading to fruit cracking, browning, and drying, as well as stunted growth and dieback of young shoots.
        *   **Management:**
            *   Foliar spray of **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate) at 1-1.5 g/L of water, or **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** at 0.5-1 g/L of water, applied before flowering and again at fruit set.
    *   **Potassium Deficiency:** Can cause marginal scorching and drying of older leaves.
        *   **Management:**
            *   Apply **Potassium sulphate** (SOP) at 200-500 g per tree, depending on age, or **Muriate of Potash** (MOP) at 150-400 g per tree, split into two doses (pre-monsoon and post-monsoon).
    *   **General Nutrient Imbalance:** Overall lack of balanced nutrition can weaken the tree, making it susceptible to stress.
        *   **Management:**
            *   Conduct soil and leaf analysis to determine specific nutrient needs.
            *   Apply a balanced fertilizer schedule as per HAU recommendations for Litchi.

3.  **Temperature Stress:**
    *   **Heat Stress/Sunburn:** Intense summer heat can scorch leaves and fruits, leading to drying.
        *   **Management:**
            *   Ensure adequate irrigation.
            *   Consider shading young trees during peak summer.
            *   Apply white wash (lime solution) to the trunk to reflect heat.
    *   **Cold/Frost Damage:** Young trees are particularly susceptible to frost, causing drying of shoots and leaves.
        *   **Management:**
            *   Protect young trees with covers or windbreaks during winter.
            *   Light irrigation before a predicted frost can help.

**B. Biotic Factors (Diseases and Pests)**

If abiotic factors are ruled out, or if specific lesions/insect damage are observed, biotic factors are likely.

1.  **Fungal Diseases:**
    *   **Anthracnose (Dieback) (Caused by *Colletotrichum gloeosporioides*):** This is a very common and serious disease in Litchi, causing drying of twigs, leaves, flowers, and fruits.
        *   **Symptoms:** Dark brown to black spots on leaves, flowers, and young fruits; twig dieback starting from the tip; flower blight; fruit rot (often post-harvest, but can occur on tree).
        *   **Management:**
            *   Prune and destroy all affected branches, leaves, and fruits. Ensure clean pruning cuts.
            *   Apply fungicides preventively during flushing, flowering, and fruit development stages.
            *   **Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved):**
                *   **Carbendazim** at 1 g/L of water.
                *   **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water.
                *   **Propiconazole** at 0.5 ml/L of water.
                *   **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5 ml/L of water.
                *   **Copper oxychloride** at 3 g/L of water (as a protective spray).
            *   Rotate fungicides to prevent resistance development.

    *   **Phytophthora Root/Collar Rot (Caused by *Phytophthora* species):** If entire branches or the whole tree shows wilting and drying, starting from the lower leaves.
        *   **Symptoms:** Yellowing, wilting, and drying of leaves; cankers on the collar region or roots; root decay.
        *   **Management:**
            *   Improve soil drainage. Avoid waterlogging.
            *   Avoid injury to the collar region during cultivation.
            *   **Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved):**
                *   Drench the soil around the tree with **Fosetyl-aluminium** at 2.5 g/L of water, or **Propamocarb hydrochloride** at 2 ml/L of water.
                *   Alternatively, use a combination product like **Metalaxyl + Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water as a drench.

2.  **Insect Pests:**
    *   **Stem Borers (e.g., *Zeuzera coffeae*):** Larvae bore into branches, disrupting nutrient and water flow, leading to sudden drying and dieback of affected branches.
        *   **Symptoms:** Presence of boreholes on branches, frass (excrement) outside the holes, sudden drying of a branch while the rest of the tree is healthy.
        *   **Management:**
            *   Prune and destroy infested branches if the damage is localized.
            *   Insert a wire into the borehole to kill the larva.
            *   Inject a solution of **Chlorpyrifos** at 2 ml/L of water into the boreholes and seal them with mud.
            *   For severe infestations, drenching the trunk with **Imidacloprid** at 0.5 ml/L of water can provide systemic protection.

    *   **Mites (e.g., Litchi Mite, Red Spider Mite):** Severe infestations can cause bronzing, curling, and drying of leaves, especially on the undersurface.
        *   **Symptoms:** Stippling, bronzing, or silvery sheen on leaves; fine webbing (for red spider mites); distorted or dried leaves.
        *   **Management:**
            *   **Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved Acaricides):**
                *   **Spiromesifen** at 0.5 ml/L of water.
                *   **Fenpyroximate** at 0.5 ml/L of water.
                *   **Propargite** at 1 ml/L of water.

**III. General Cultural Practices for Prevention**

*   **Orchard Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy fallen leaves, fruits, and diseased plant parts.
*   **Pruning:** Prune dead, diseased, or weak branches during the dormant season to improve air circulation and reduce disease inoculum.
*   **Balanced Fertilization:** Ensure the tree receives adequate and balanced nutrients to maintain vigor and resistance.
*   **Regular Monitoring:** Inspect trees regularly for early signs of stress, disease, or pest infestation.

**Important Note:** Always read the label instructions of any chemical product carefully before use and follow recommended safety precautions, dosage, and pre-harvest intervals. For precise diagnosis and tailored advice, it is always best to consult with local agricultural extension officers or HAU experts, especially if the symptoms persist or worsen.
