Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling soil pests like termites and nematodes in Litchi orchards in Haryana.

Both termites and nematodes (specifically root-knot nematodes) are significant soil pests that can cause considerable damage to Litchi trees, especially young saplings. Effective management requires an integrated approach combining cultural practices and judicious use of CIBRC approved chemicals.

### 1. Control of Termites in Litchi

Termites (Odontotermes obesus, Microtermes obesi, etc.) can damage Litchi trees by feeding on the bark and wood, especially below ground level, leading to weakening, poor growth, and even death of young trees.

**Cultural and Preventive Measures:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove all dead wood, stumps, and debris from the orchard area before planting, as these can serve as breeding sites for termites.
*   **Proper Irrigation:** Avoid waterlogging, as moist conditions can sometimes attract termites.
*   **Organic Matter:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost, as fresh organic matter can sometimes attract termites.

**Chemical Control:**

**A. Pre-planting Treatment (for new orchards):**
*   Before planting, treat the soil in the pits (60x60x60 cm) with an insecticide.
*   Drench each pit with 5-10 litres of water mixed with **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 2.5 ml/L of water.
*   Alternatively, mix **Fipronil** 0.3% GR at 20-30 g per pit thoroughly with the soil before filling.

**B. Post-planting Treatment (for existing trees):**
*   If termite mounds are observed in or around the orchard, destroy them and drench the area with an insecticide.
*   For individual trees showing termite damage (e.g., mud channels on the trunk, hollowed-out wood), drench the soil around the base of the tree (in a 30-45 cm radius) with:
    *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 2.5 ml/L of water. Apply 5-10 litres of solution per tree depending on its size.
    *   Alternatively, use **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL at 0.5 ml/L of water, drenching the soil around the tree base.

### 2. Control of Nematodes (Root-knot) in Litchi

Root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.) are microscopic roundworms that infect the roots of Litchi trees, causing characteristic galls or knots. This damage impairs the roots' ability to absorb water and nutrients, leading to stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, reduced fruit yield, and in severe cases, tree decline.

**Cultural and Preventive Measures:**
*   **Healthy Planting Material:** Always use healthy, nematode-free saplings from a reputable nursery.
*   **Soil Solarization:** In fallow land, especially before planting new orchards, cover the moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks during hot summer months to kill nematodes and other soil-borne pathogens.
*   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporate large quantities of well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM), neem cake (200-400 g/tree), or other organic matter into the soil. This improves soil health and promotes beneficial microorganisms that can suppress nematode populations.
*   **Crop Rotation:** If possible in intercropping systems, avoid susceptible crops and grow nematode-resistant cover crops.

**Chemical Control:**

For established trees, chemical nematicides can be applied to manage severe infestations.
*   Apply **Carbofuran** 3% G at 50-100 g per tree (depending on tree age and size) by broadcasting it evenly around the tree base within the drip line and lightly incorporating it into the soil, followed by irrigation.
*   Alternatively, **Phorate** 10% G can be applied at 25-50 g per tree, following the same method.

**Biological Control:**
*   Application of bio-nematicides like *Purpureocillium lilacinum* (formerly *Paecilomyces lilacinus*) or *Trichoderma harzianum* can be effective. Mix 2.5 kg of the bio-agent with 50 kg of well-decomposed FYM and apply it around the base of the tree, followed by light irrigation. Repeat application every 6-12 months.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully, including dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension officers or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions.
*   Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods, is always recommended for sustainable pest control.

I hope this detailed advice helps you in managing soil pests in your Litchi orchard effectively.
