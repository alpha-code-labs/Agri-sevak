As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the challenges posed by sucking pests in Litchi cultivation in Haryana. Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, Thrips, and Psylla are indeed significant pests of Litchi, causing damage to new flushes, flowers, and developing fruits, leading to reduced yield and quality.

Effective management requires an integrated approach, combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical control methods.

**General Management Principles:**

*   **Regular Monitoring:** Frequently inspect new flushes, flowers, and young fruits for the presence of pests. Early detection is crucial for timely intervention.
*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Prune infested twigs and leaves during the off-season to reduce pest inoculum.
    *   Maintain orchard hygiene by removing weeds, which can act as alternate hosts.
    *   Ensure proper tree nutrition and irrigation to promote plant vigour, making them more resilient.
*   **Biological Control:** Conserve natural enemies like ladybird beetles, lacewings, and parasitic wasps, which prey on or parasitize these sucking pests. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm beneficial insects.
*   **Chemical Control:** Apply insecticides only when pest populations reach economic threshold levels. Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

**Chemical Control Recommendations (CIBRC Approved Technical Chemicals for Litchi in Haryana):**

When pest incidence is high and other methods are insufficient, the following CIBRC approved technical chemicals can be used. Always ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the underside of leaves and new growth.

*   For general sucking pests (Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, Thrips, Psylla):
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at 0.5 - 0.75 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at 0.2 - 0.3 g per litre of water.
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply at 0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water.
    *   **Flonicamid 50% WG:** Apply at 0.3 g per litre of water.

*   Specifically for Whiteflies and Leafhoppers, and also effective against Thrips:
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at 1.25 - 1.5 ml per litre of water. (Effective against nymphs and hoppers).
    *   **Diafenthiuron 50% WP:** Apply at 1.0 - 1.2 g per litre of water.

*   For Thrips and Leafhoppers:
    *   **Fipronil 5% SC:** Apply at 1.5 - 2.0 ml per litre of water.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Timing:** Apply insecticides preferably during the early stages of pest infestation, targeting new flushes and pre-flowering stages. Avoid spraying during full bloom to protect pollinators.
*   **Rotation:** Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pest resistance.
*   **Safety:** Always read and follow the instructions on the product label, including dosage, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and safety precautions (wearing protective gear).
*   **Water Volume:** Ensure adequate water volume for thorough coverage, typically 1000-1500 litres per hectare depending on tree size and canopy density.

For specific guidance tailored to your orchard's conditions, it is always advisable to consult with HAU extension specialists.
