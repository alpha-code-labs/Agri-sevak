As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding rust diseases in Litchi for Haryana.

*   **Black Rust (*Puccinia graminis*)**: This is not known to affect Litchi. It primarily affects cereal crops like wheat.
*   **Brown Rust (*Puccinia triticina*)**: This is not known to affect Litchi. It primarily affects cereal crops like wheat.
*   **Yellow Rust (*Puccinia striiformis*)**: This is not known to affect Litchi. It primarily affects cereal crops like wheat.
*   **White Rust (*Albugo candida*)**: This is not known to affect Litchi. It primarily affects cruciferous vegetables.

**Red Rust (*Cephaleuros virescens*)**

Red rust, caused by the parasitic alga *Cephaleuros virescens*, is a known issue in Litchi and other fruit trees. It is not a true fungal rust but an algal disease.

**Symptoms:**
It appears as reddish-brown, velvety, circular patches on the upper surface of leaves, and sometimes on twigs and fruits. Severe infestations can lead to defoliation, twig dieback, and reduced fruit quality.

**Control Measures:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Orchard Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy infected leaves and twigs to reduce inoculum.
    *   **Pruning:** Ensure proper canopy management through regular pruning to improve air circulation and light penetration, which helps in drying leaf surfaces and reducing humidity.
    *   **Weed Control:** Keep the orchard floor free of weeds to reduce humidity.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Maintain optimal plant health through balanced fertilization. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can promote lush, susceptible growth.
    *   **Spacing:** Ensure adequate spacing between trees to prevent overcrowding and improve air movement.

2.  **Chemical Control:**
    *   Apply fungicides containing copper, which are effective against algal diseases.
    *   Spray during periods of high humidity or when symptoms first appear, especially after monsoon rains.
    *   **Copper Oxychloride**: Apply at a concentration of 2.5-3.0 grams per litre of water. Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.
    *   Repeat application if necessary, typically at 15-20 day intervals, depending on disease severity and weather conditions.
