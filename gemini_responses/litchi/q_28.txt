As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I advise Litchi growers in Haryana to adopt the following scientifically verified practices to protect their orchards from environmental stresses:

### A. Protection from Extreme Cold and Frost

Extreme cold and frost can cause significant damage, especially to young plants and new flushes, leading to dieback and reduced productivity.

*   **For Young Plants (up to 3-4 years old):**
    *   **Physical Covers:** Provide individual covers using straw, hessian cloth, or plastic sheets over a support structure to create a mini-greenhouse effect. Ensure covers are removed during warm periods to allow air circulation.
    *   **Light Irrigation:** Apply light irrigation to the basin of young plants in the evening before an expected frost. This helps to release latent heat from the soil, slightly raising the ambient temperature.
    *   **Mulching:** Apply a thick layer (10-15 cm) of organic mulch (straw, dry leaves, sugarcane trash) around the base of young trees to insulate the soil and protect roots from freezing.

*   **For Mature Trees:**
    *   **Pre-Frost Irrigation:** Apply light irrigation to the entire orchard 1-2 days before an anticipated frost event. Wet soil absorbs more solar radiation during the day and releases heat slowly at night, slightly raising the ambient temperature.
    *   **Smudge Fires:** In severe frost conditions, creating small, controlled smudge fires (using agricultural waste like straw, dry leaves, or cow dung cakes) on the upwind side of the orchard can generate smoke and warm air, preventing temperature drops at ground level. Ensure proper safety measures.
    *   **Windbreaks/Shelterbelts:** Maintain or plant evergreen trees (e.g., Jamun, Mango, Eucalyptus) as windbreaks on the northern and western sides of the orchard to reduce the impact of cold winds.
    *   **Trunk Protection:** White wash the main trunk and lower scaffold branches with a lime solution. This reflects sunlight during the day, preventing excessive heating, and reduces temperature fluctuations that can lead to bark splitting.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure balanced nutrition, particularly adequate **Potassium** (K) levels, as it enhances the plant's ability to withstand cold stress.
    *   **Foliar Sprays:**
        *   Apply a foliar spray of **Potassium nitrate** at 10-15 g/L of water, 7-10 days before the expected cold wave. This helps in improving the plant's physiological tolerance to cold.

### B. Protection from Heat/Loo and Intense Sunlight

High temperatures, hot dry winds (Loo), and intense sunlight, especially during flowering and fruit development, can cause flower drop, fruit sunburn, and reduced fruit quality.

*   **Irrigation:**
    *   **Regular and Adequate Irrigation:** Maintain consistent soil moisture, especially during hot periods and fruit development stages. Drip irrigation is highly efficient, delivering water directly to the root zone and minimizing evaporative losses. Adjust irrigation frequency based on soil type and weather conditions.
    *   **Evaporative Cooling:** In extreme heat, overhead irrigation for short durations during the hottest part of the day can provide evaporative cooling to the canopy, but this should be done carefully to avoid fungal issues.

*   **Mulching:** Apply a thick layer (10-15 cm) of organic mulch (straw, dry leaves, sugarcane trash) around the base of trees. Mulch helps to:
    *   Reduce soil temperature.
    *   Conserve soil moisture by reducing evaporation.
    *   Suppress weed growth.

*   **Shade Nets:**
    *   **For Young Plants:** Provide temporary shade using green agro-shade nets (30-50% shade) during peak summer months to protect young saplings from scorching sun.
    *   **For Mature Trees:** In areas prone to severe heat waves, installing temporary shade nets over the orchard during critical periods (e.g., fruit development) can significantly reduce canopy temperature and prevent fruit sunburn.

*   **Windbreaks/Shelterbelts:** Maintain or plant evergreen trees as windbreaks on the western and southern sides of the orchard to protect from hot, dry "Loo" winds.

*   **Trunk and Branch Protection:** White wash the main trunk and exposed scaffold branches with a lime solution. This reflects intense sunlight, reduces bark temperature, and prevents sunscald.

*   **Foliar Sprays:**
    *   **Kaolin clay:** Apply a foliar spray of **Kaolin clay** (particle film technology) at 50-70 g/L of water. This forms a white, reflective layer on leaves and fruits, reducing canopy temperature by several degrees and preventing sunburn. Reapply after heavy rains or every 15-20 days during peak heat.
    *   **Potassium nitrate:** Apply a foliar spray of **Potassium nitrate** at 10-15 g/L of water during periods of high heat stress. Potassium helps in osmoregulation and improves the plant's tolerance to heat and drought.
    *   **Glycine betaine:** Apply a foliar spray of **Glycine betaine** at 1-2 g/L of water. This acts as an osmoprotectant, helping plant cells maintain turgor and function under heat and drought stress.

By implementing these scientifically verified practices, Litchi growers in Haryana can significantly mitigate the adverse effects of environmental stresses, ensuring healthier trees and better fruit yields.
