Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding Wilt and Parawilt in Litchi. This is a significant challenge for Litchi growers in our region.

Wilt in Litchi is a complex issue, often caused by a combination of factors including soil-borne fungal pathogens (like *Fusarium oxysporum*, *Rhizoctonia solani*, *Phytophthora* species), bacterial infections, nematode infestations, and physiological stresses. Parawilt, specifically, is often attributed to sudden environmental changes, such as erratic soil moisture, high temperatures, or root damage, which can then predispose the plant to opportunistic pathogens.

Effective management requires an integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical strategies.

### Integrated Management Strategies for Wilt and Parawilt in Litchi:

**I. Cultural and Horticultural Practices:**

1.  **Soil Management:**
    *   **Improve Drainage:** Litchi trees are highly sensitive to waterlogging. Ensure good soil drainage by incorporating organic matter (farmyard manure, compost) and, if necessary, planting on raised beds in heavy soils.
    *   **Soil Aeration:** Avoid soil compaction around the root zone. Light cultivation or mulching can help maintain soil structure.
    *   **Soil pH:** Maintain an optimal soil pH of 6.0-7.0. Conduct regular soil tests and amend as necessary.

2.  **Water Management:**
    *   **Regulated Irrigation:** Provide consistent and adequate irrigation, especially during critical growth stages and dry periods. Avoid both water scarcity and over-irrigation, which can stress roots and promote pathogen growth.
    *   **Mulching:** Apply a thick layer of organic mulch (straw, dry leaves, sugarcane trash) around the tree base. This helps conserve soil moisture, regulate soil temperature, suppress weeds, and improve soil health, thereby reducing stress on the roots.

3.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Balanced Fertilization:** Ensure a balanced supply of macro and micronutrients based on soil test reports. Nutrient deficiencies or excesses can weaken the tree and make it more susceptible to wilt.
    *   **Organic Matter:** Regularly incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure or compost to enhance soil fertility and microbial activity.

4.  **Sanitation and Pruning:**
    *   **Remove Affected Parts:** Promptly prune and destroy any wilted or diseased branches, leaves, or fruits to prevent the spread of pathogens.
    *   **Tool Sterilization:** Sterilize pruning tools with a 10% bleach solution or alcohol after each cut, especially when working on diseased trees.

5.  **Healthy Planting Material:**
    *   Always use healthy, disease-free saplings from reputable nurseries. Inspect roots for any signs of damage or disease before planting.

**II. Biological Control:**

1.  **Beneficial Microbes:**
    *   **Trichoderma viride / Trichoderma harzianum:** Apply *Trichoderma* formulations as a soil drench or mix with farmyard manure and incorporate into the soil around the root zone. This antagonistic fungus helps suppress soil-borne pathogens.
        *   **Dosage:** 2.5 kg per acre (mixed with 50-100 kg FYM/compost) or 5-10 g/L water for drenching.
    *   **Pseudomonas fluorescens:** Similar to *Trichoderma*, *Pseudomonas fluorescens* can be applied as a soil drench to promote plant growth and suppress pathogens.
        *   **Dosage:** 2.5 kg per acre (mixed with 50-100 kg FYM/compost) or 5-10 g/L water for drenching.

**III. Chemical Control:**

*   **Fungicides (for soil-borne fungal wilts):**
    *   **Soil Drenching:** In cases of confirmed fungal wilt, soil drenching with CIBRC approved fungicides is recommended.
        *   **Carbendazim:** Drench the soil around the affected tree with a solution of **Carbendazim** at 1-2 g/L water. Repeat after 15-20 days if necessary.
        *   **Copper Oxychloride:** For general soil sanitation and *Phytophthora* related wilts, drench the soil with **Copper Oxychloride** at 2-3 g/L water.
        *   **Metalaxyl + Mancozeb:** If *Phytophthora* is strongly suspected, a combination product containing **Metalaxyl + Mancozeb** can be used as a soil drench at 2-2.5 g/L water.

*   **Nematicides (if nematodes are a contributing factor):**
    *   If root-knot nematodes are identified as a significant problem through soil testing, they can predispose trees to wilt.
    *   **Biological Nematicides:** Consider using biological nematicides like *Paecilomyces lilacinus* or *Purpureocillium lilacinum* as soil applications to manage nematode populations.
        *   **Dosage:** 2.5 kg per acre (mixed with 50-100 kg FYM/compost) or 5-10 g/L water for drenching.
    *   **Chemical Nematicides:** For severe infestations, consult with HAU experts for specific CIBRC approved chemical nematicide recommendations suitable for Litchi in Haryana, as their use requires careful consideration and specific approvals.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Early Detection:** Monitor your Litchi trees regularly for any signs of wilting. Early detection and intervention are crucial for successful management.
*   **Diagnosis:** If the cause of wilt is unclear, it is advisable to get a proper diagnosis from a plant pathology lab (e.g., at HAU, Hisar) to identify the specific pathogen or underlying issue. This will help in selecting the most appropriate control measures.

By implementing these integrated strategies, you can significantly reduce the incidence and severity of Wilt and Parawilt in your Litchi orchard.
