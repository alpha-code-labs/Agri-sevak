Dear Farmer,

Scale insects and Mealybugs are significant sap-sucking pests of Litchi, causing considerable damage by weakening the plant, reducing fruit quality, and promoting sooty mold growth. Effective management requires an integrated approach.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Pruning:** Regularly prune and destroy infested twigs, branches, and leaves, especially after harvest or during dormant periods. This reduces pest populations and improves spray penetration.
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the orchard free of weeds, as they can serve as alternate hosts for these pests.
    *   **Ant Control:** Control ants, as they protect mealybugs and scales for their honeydew secretions. Apply sticky bands on tree trunks or use ant baits.
    *   **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect trees, especially the undersides of leaves, branch crotches, and fruit clusters, for early detection of pests.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Conserve natural enemies such as ladybird beetles, lacewings, and parasitic wasps, which prey on or parasitize scale insects and mealybugs. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

**Chemical Control (When pest populations are high and cultural/biological methods are insufficient):**

For effective control, ensure thorough spray coverage, targeting the undersides of leaves, branches, and fruit clusters where these pests often hide. It is advisable to rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

*   **For Scale Insects and Mealybugs:**
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at a concentration of 2.5 ml per litre of water. This is an insect growth regulator that interferes with molting.
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at a concentration of 0.5 ml per litre of water. This is a systemic insecticide effective against sucking pests.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at a concentration of 0.2 g per litre of water. Another systemic insecticide effective against a wide range of sucking pests.
    *   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:** Apply at a concentration of 0.75 ml per litre of water. This is a systemic insecticide with translaminar movement, effective against scales and mealybugs.
    *   **Horticultural Mineral Oil (HMO) / White Oil:** Apply at a concentration of 10-20 ml per litre of water. This works by suffocating the insects and can be particularly effective against younger stages and for smothering scales. It is often recommended during dormant periods or post-harvest.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Timing:** Apply insecticides when pest populations are young and more vulnerable. Avoid spraying during flowering to protect pollinators. If spraying during fruit development, observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) specified on the product label.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure complete coverage of the plant, especially the undersides of leaves and bark crevices where pests hide.
*   **Safety:** Always read and follow the instructions on the product label regarding dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI). Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during application.

By combining these strategies, you can effectively manage scale insects and mealybugs in your Litchi orchard.
