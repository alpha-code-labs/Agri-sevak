As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for the control of pests in Litchi, adhering to CIBRC approved technical chemical names and metric units.

**Control of Borers, Caterpillars, Diamondback moth, and Leaf folder in Litchi:**

**1. Borers (e.g., Shoot Borer, Fruit Borer, Bark Borer):**
Borers are significant pests in Litchi, affecting shoots, fruits, and bark.

*   **Shoot Borer (Chlumetia transversa):**
    *   Symptoms: Wilting of young shoots, presence of boreholes, and frass.
    *   Control:
        *   Prune and destroy affected shoots during early infestation to reduce pest population.
        *   Chemical control during new flush emergence:
            *   Spray with **Chlorantraniliprole** at 0.3 ml/L of water.
            *   Alternatively, spray with **Emamectin benzoate** at 0.2 g/L of water.
            *   Alternatively, spray with **Lambda-cyhalothrin** at 0.5 ml/L of water.

*   **Fruit Borer (Conogethes punctiferalis):**
    *   Symptoms: Entry holes on fruits, internal feeding, leading to premature fruit drop and fruit decay.
    *   Control:
        *   Collect and destroy infested fruits regularly to break the pest cycle.
        *   Chemical control during fruit development (from pea to marble size stage):
            *   Spray with **Chlorantraniliprole** at 0.3 ml/L of water.
            *   Alternatively, spray with **Emamectin benzoate** at 0.2 g/L of water.
            *   Alternatively, spray with **Lambda-cyhalothrin** at 0.5 ml/L of water.

*   **Bark Borer (Indarbela quadrinotata):**
    *   Symptoms: Irregular tunnels on the bark covered with silken webs and frass (excreta), mainly on the main trunk and older branches.
    *   Control:
        *   Clean the affected bark by removing webs and frass.
        *   Inject a solution of **Chlorpyrifos** at 2.5 ml/L of water into the boreholes using a syringe and then plug the holes with mud or cotton. This should ideally be done during non-fruiting periods.

**2. Caterpillars (General Defoliators):**
Various caterpillar species can cause defoliation, especially on young leaves and new flushes.

*   Control:
    *   In small orchards, hand-picking and destroying caterpillars can be effective.
    *   Chemical control when infestation is significant:
        *   Spray with **Emamectin benzoate** at 0.2 g/L of water.
        *   Alternatively, spray with **Chlorantraniliprole** at 0.3 ml/L of water.
        *   Alternatively, spray with **Flubendiamide** at 0.2 ml/L of water.

**3. Diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella):**
*   This is not known to affect Litchi. Diamondback moth is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower, mustard).

**4. Leaf folder (e.g., Platypepla aprobola, Dudua aprobola):**
Leaf folders are common pests, particularly on new flushes, where larvae fold leaves and feed inside, hindering leaf expansion and photosynthesis.

*   Control:
    *   Prune and destroy infested leaves during early stages of infestation to reduce pest population.
    *   Chemical control during new flush emergence:
        *   Spray with **Chlorantraniliprole** at 0.3 ml/L of water.
        *   Alternatively, spray with **Emamectin benzoate** at 0.2 g/L of water.
        *   Alternatively, spray with **Lambda-cyhalothrin** at 0.5 ml/L of water.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the pesticide label, including dosage, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance in pest populations.
*   Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approaches, combining cultural, mechanical, and biological methods with judicious chemical use, are highly recommended for sustainable pest control.
*   For the most current and specific recommendations tailored to your local conditions and crop stage, please consult your nearest agricultural extension office or HAU Krishi Vigyan Kendra.
