As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified recommendations for the use of growth regulators and micronutrients in Litchi cultivation in Haryana:

### **1. Ethephon (formerly known by trade name Ethrel)**

*   **Purpose:** To promote uniform fruit ripening and de-greening of Litchi fruits.
*   **Recommended Dose:**
    *   Foliar spray of **Ethephon** at 100-200 ppm (parts per million).
    *   For a common commercial formulation of **Ethephon** 39% SL (Soluble Liquid), this translates to approximately **0.25 - 0.5 mL** of the product per liter of water.
*   **Timing:** Apply as a foliar spray 7-10 days before the anticipated harvest, when fruits have attained full size and just begin to show a change in skin color from green to pinkish.
*   **Note:** Ensure thorough coverage of the fruit clusters.

### **2. 2,4-D (2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid)**

*   **Recommendation:** **2,4-D** is primarily known as a herbicide and is **not a standard or widely recommended plant growth regulator for Litchi in Haryana** for purposes like fruit set or fruit drop control. Its use at growth regulator concentrations can be risky due to potential phytotoxicity if not precisely applied.
*   **Alternative for Fruit Drop Control:** For controlling pre-harvest fruit drop in Litchi, **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA)** is generally recommended at very low concentrations (e.g., 10-20 ppm) as a foliar spray after fruit set.

### **3. Boron**

*   **Purpose:** Boron is a crucial micronutrient for Litchi, essential for pollen germination, fruit set, fruit development, and preventing fruit cracking.
*   **Recommended Dose:**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Apply **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate) at a concentration of 0.2% - 0.4%.
        *   This means **2 - 4 grams of Borax** per liter of water.
    *   **Soil Application:** For mature trees, **100 - 200 grams of Borax** can be applied per tree, mixed with soil, based on soil test recommendations and tree age.
*   **Timing:**
    *   The first foliar spray should be applied before flowering (at the bud differentiation stage).
    *   A second spray can be given after fruit set, particularly if fruit cracking is a known issue in your orchard.
*   **Note:** Ensure even distribution for foliar sprays. Soil application should be done carefully, avoiding direct contact with the trunk. Always conduct a soil test to determine the exact Boron requirement.
