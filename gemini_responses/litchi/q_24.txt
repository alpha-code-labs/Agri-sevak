As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, here is the scientifically verified advice for Litchi transplantation in Haryana:

### Ideal Transplantation Time, Distance, and Process for Litchi

**1. Ideal Transplantation Time:**
The most suitable time for transplanting Litchi plants in Haryana is during the monsoon season.

*   **July - August:** This period offers optimal conditions with high humidity and sufficient rainfall, which are crucial for the successful establishment of young plants.
*   **Alternatively, February - March:** If assured irrigation facilities are available, transplantation can also be done in late winter/early spring, allowing plants to establish before the intense summer heat. However, monsoon planting is generally preferred for better survival rates.

**2. Transplantation Distance:**
The recommended spacing for Litchi plants depends on the variety and the desired orchard management system.

*   **Standard Spacing:** For most Litchi varieties, a spacing of **8 meters x 8 meters** to **10 meters x 10 meters** is ideal. This allows for proper canopy development and air circulation as the trees mature.
*   **High-Density Planting (HDP):** For specific varieties amenable to pruning and high-density systems, a spacing of **6 meters x 6 meters** can be adopted. This requires regular and systematic pruning to manage tree size and maintain productivity.

**3. Transplantation Process:**
A meticulous approach during transplantation ensures better establishment and growth of Litchi plants.

*   **Pit Preparation (1-2 months in advance):**
    *   Dig pits of **1 meter x 1 meter x 1 meter** size at the marked spacing.
    *   Allow the pits to remain open for 15-30 days to expose the soil to sunlight and air, which helps in pest and disease control.
    *   Fill each pit with a mixture of:
        *   Topsoil (from the pit)
        *   20-25 kg well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost
        *   1 kg Neem cake (for pest deterrence and nutrient supply)
        *   1 kg Single Super Phosphate (SSP) (if soil test indicates phosphorus deficiency)
        *   Mix thoroughly and mound the soil slightly above ground level to allow for settling.

*   **Selection of Planting Material:**
    *   Use healthy, vigorous, and disease-free air layers (gootee) or grafted plants obtained from a reputable nursery.
    *   Ensure the plants are 1-2 years old and have a well-developed root system.

*   **Planting:**
    *   Carefully remove the plant from its container or polythene bag without disturbing the root ball.
    *   Place the plant in the center of the prepared pit, ensuring that the root collar (the point where the stem meets the roots) is at ground level.
    *   Backfill the pit with the remaining prepared soil mixture, gently firming the soil around the root ball to remove any air pockets.

*   **Initial Care:**
    *   **Watering:** Immediately after planting, water the plant thoroughly until the soil is saturated. Continue regular watering, especially during dry spells, to maintain adequate soil moisture.
    *   **Staking:** Provide a sturdy stake to support the young plant and protect it from strong winds.
    *   **Mulching:** Apply a layer of organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves, sugarcane trash) around the base of the plant (keeping it away from the stem) to conserve soil moisture, regulate soil temperature, and suppress weeds.
    *   **Shading:** Protect young plants from direct harsh sunlight, especially during the initial establishment phase, by providing temporary shade.
