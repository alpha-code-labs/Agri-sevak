Greetings from Haryana Agricultural University, Hisar. Here is the scientifically verified advice for managing the conditions you've mentioned in Litchi orchards in Haryana:

### 1. Scab (Litchi Scab)

*   **Symptoms:** Appears as small, raised, corky spots on leaves, twigs, and fruits. Severe infection can lead to fruit distortion and cracking, reducing market value.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Cultural:** Prune and destroy infected plant parts to reduce the source of inoculum. Ensure proper air circulation within the canopy by judicious pruning.
    *   **Chemical (Fungicides):** Apply sprays at critical stages such as new flush emergence, pre-bloom, post-bloom, and during fruit development, especially if humid conditions prevail.
        *   For preventive control:
            *   Spray **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water.
            *   Alternatively, **Copper oxychloride** at 3 g/L of water.
        *   For systemic action and curative control:
            *   Spray **Carbendazim** at 1 g/L of water.
            *   Alternatively, **Propiconazole** at 0.5 ml/L of water.

### 2. Canker

*   This is not known to affect Litchi as a primary, distinct disease in the way it affects other fruit crops like citrus or stone fruits. While various factors can lead to bark lesions or dieback, a specific "Litchi Canker" pathogen is not commonly reported as a major disease.

### 3. Gummosis

*   **Symptoms:** Exudation of a sticky, amber-colored gum from the bark, often accompanied by bark cracking, discoloration, and sometimes dieback of branches. It can be caused by fungal pathogens (e.g., *Phytophthora* spp., *Botryodiplodia theobromae*), mechanical injuries, or physiological stress.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Cultural:**
        *   Improve soil drainage to prevent waterlogging, which can predispose trees to root and collar rot.
        *   Avoid mechanical injuries to the trunk and branches during cultivation or harvesting.
        *   Maintain tree vigor through proper nutrition and irrigation.
        *   Scrape off the affected bark gently until healthy tissue is exposed.
    *   **Chemical (Fungicides):**
        *   After scraping, apply a paste of **Copper oxychloride** (50 g in 100 ml of water) to the affected area.
        *   For systemic control, especially if *Phytophthora* is suspected, drench the soil around the tree base with **Fosetyl-aluminium** at 2.5 g/L of water, or spray the trunk and lower branches.
        *   Alternatively, spray the affected areas with **Propiconazole** at 0.5 ml/L of water.

### 4. Lichen

*   **Nature:** Lichens are symbiotic organisms (a fungus and an alga) that grow on the bark of trees. They are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surface of the tree and are generally not parasitic or harmful to the Litchi tree itself. Their presence often indicates high humidity, poor air circulation within the canopy, or reduced tree vigor.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Cultural:**
        *   Improve air circulation within the canopy by judicious pruning of dense branches.
        *   Ensure proper tree nutrition and irrigation to enhance overall tree health and vigor.
        *   Gently scrub the bark with a stiff brush to remove lichens, especially during the dry season.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   If their presence is extensive and aesthetically undesirable, a mild spray of **Copper oxychloride** at 3 g/L of water can help reduce their growth. However, this is generally not necessary as they are harmless to the tree.
