As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling dropping in Litchi:

Firstly, regarding "Tinda/Boll dropping":
This is not known to affect Litchi. Tinda is a type of gourd, and bolls are characteristic of cotton plants. Litchi produces fruits, not tinda or bolls.

Now, addressing Flower drop and Fruit drop in Litchi:

Flower and fruit drop in Litchi can be attributed to various physiological, nutritional, pest, and disease factors. An integrated approach is crucial for effective management.

**I. Physiological and Nutritional Management:**

1.  **Hormonal Balance:**
    *   **Naphthalene acetic acid (NAA):** Apply a foliar spray of **Naphthalene acetic acid** (4.5% SL) at 10-20 ppm (10-20 ml per 100 litres of water) at two stages:
        *   First spray: Just after fruit set (when fruits are pea-sized).
        *   Second spray: 15-20 days after the first spray.
        This helps in reducing premature fruit drop.

2.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Boron:** Boron deficiency is a major cause of flower and fruit drop, as it affects pollen viability and fruit set.
        *   Apply a foliar spray of **Borax** (10.5% Boron) at 1-2 g/L of water (100-200 g per 100 litres of water) before flowering and again at fruit set.
    *   **Zinc:** Zinc is essential for hormone synthesis and overall plant vigour.
        *   Apply a foliar spray of **Zinc sulphate** (21% Zinc) at 5 g/L of water (500 g per 100 litres of water) before flowering or during vegetative flush.
    *   **Potassium:** Adequate potassium is vital for fruit development and retention. Ensure balanced fertilization with potassium as per soil test recommendations.

3.  **Water Management:**
    *   Maintain consistent soil moisture, especially during flowering and fruit development stages. Both water stress and waterlogging can lead to significant drop. Provide light and frequent irrigation during these critical periods.

4.  **Orchard Management:**
    *   **Pruning:** Light pruning after harvest helps in maintaining tree vigour and promoting healthy new flushes.
    *   **Canopy Management:** Ensure proper sunlight penetration and air circulation within the canopy.
    *   **Pollination:** Encourage bee activity by avoiding insecticide sprays during peak flowering and by placing bee hives in the orchard.

**II. Pest Management:**

Certain pests can directly or indirectly cause flower and fruit drop by damaging the reproductive structures.

1.  **Litchi Fruit Borer (Conopomorpha sinensis):** Larvae bore into developing fruits, causing them to drop prematurely.
    *   Spray with **Chlorantraniliprole** (18.5% SC) at 0.3 ml/L of water or **Emamectin benzoate** (5% SG) at 0.2 g/L of water, starting from fruit set and repeating as per pest incidence and label recommendations.

2.  **Mites and Thrips:** These sucking pests can damage flowers and young fruits, leading to their shedding.
    *   For mites, spray **Spiromesifen** (22.9% SC) at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   For thrips, spray **Imidacloprid** (17.8% SL) at 0.5 ml/L of water. Apply at flowering or early fruit set if pest incidence is observed.

**III. Disease Management:**

Diseases like Anthracnose can cause blight of flowers and young fruits, leading to drop.

1.  **Anthracnose (Colletotrichum gloeosporioides):**
    *   Apply a protective fungicidal spray of **Carbendazim** (50% WP) at 1 g/L of water or **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2.5 g/L of water, starting from pre-bloom stage and continuing through flowering and early fruit set, especially during humid conditions.

**General Recommendations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label for dosage, timing, and safety precautions.
*   Ensure proper spray coverage for effective results.
*   Rotate chemicals with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.
*   Conduct regular orchard monitoring to identify problems early.
