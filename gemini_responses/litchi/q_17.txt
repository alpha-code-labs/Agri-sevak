As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following doses of organic manures for Litchi cultivation in Haryana to ensure optimal tree health and productivity:

Organic manures are crucial for improving soil structure, water retention, microbial activity, and nutrient availability, which are all vital for healthy Litchi growth and fruit development.

### Recommended Doses of Organic Manures for Litchi:

**1. Farm Yard Manure (FYM):**
FYM should be well-decomposed and applied annually.
*   **Young Trees (1-3 years):** 10-15 kg per tree per year
*   **Bearing Trees (4-10 years):** 20-30 kg per tree per year
*   **Mature Bearing Trees (>10 years):** 40-50 kg per tree per year

**2. Vermicompost:**
Vermicompost is richer in nutrients than FYM and can be applied at a slightly lower rate.
*   **Young Trees (1-3 years):** 5-7 kg per tree per year
*   **Bearing Trees (4-10 years):** 10-15 kg per tree per year
*   **Mature Bearing Trees (>10 years):** 20-25 kg per tree per year

**3. Sagarika (Seaweed Extract based product):**
Sagarika is a plant growth stimulant and nutrient supplement, not a bulk organic manure like FYM or vermicompost. It is typically applied as a foliar spray or soil drench.
*   **Foliar Spray:**
    *   **Dose:** 2.5-3.0 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Timing:** Apply at critical growth stages such as pre-flowering, fruit set, and fruit development. Typically 2-3 sprays per season are beneficial.
*   **Soil Application (Drench):**
    *   **Dose:** 50-100 ml per tree, diluted in sufficient water, applied around the root zone.
    *   **Timing:** Can be applied during active growth periods, especially after fruit harvest or during vegetative flush.

**General Application Guidelines for FYM and Vermicompost:**
*   Apply organic manures during the post-harvest period (June-July) or before the onset of monsoon.
*   Spread the manure evenly in a ring around the tree canopy, keeping it away from the main trunk (at least 30-45 cm).
*   Lightly incorporate the manure into the topsoil (5-10 cm deep) and then irrigate.
