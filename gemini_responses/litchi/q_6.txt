As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for managing viral diseases in Litchi in Haryana.

It is important to understand that viral diseases generally do not have a direct chemical cure once a plant is infected. Management strategies primarily focus on prevention, vector control, and removal of infected plant material.

Let's address each condition:

1.  **Leaf Curl (Litchi Leaf Curl Virus - LLCV):**
    Litchi Leaf Curl Virus (LLCV) is a significant viral disease affecting Litchi in India, including Haryana. It is transmitted by whiteflies. Symptoms include curling, thickening, and brittleness of leaves, stunted growth, and reduced fruit production.

    **Control Measures:**
    *   **Use Healthy Planting Material:** Always procure planting material (grafts, air layers) from certified, virus-free nurseries.
    *   **Rogueing:** Immediately remove and destroy (burn or bury deep) all infected plants or severely infected branches to prevent the spread of the virus.
    *   **Vector Control (Whiteflies):** Since whiteflies transmit the virus, managing their population is crucial. Apply insecticides targeting whiteflies, especially during periods of new flush growth when whitefly populations are high.
        *   **Buprofezin** 25% SC: 1.25 ml per liter of water.
        *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: 0.5 ml per liter of water.
        *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: 0.2 g per liter of water.
        *   **Spiromesifen** 22.9% SC: 0.6 ml per liter of water.
        *   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP: 0.2 g per liter of water.
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the orchard free of weeds, as they can harbor whiteflies and serve as alternate hosts for viruses.
    *   **Nutritional Management:** Ensure balanced fertilization and proper irrigation to maintain plant vigor, which can help plants tolerate stress better.

2.  **Mosaic, Yellow Vein Clearing, and Stunt Virus:**
    While specific "Litchi Mosaic Virus," "Litchi Yellow Vein Clearing Virus," or "Litchi Stunt Virus" are not as widely documented as LLCV in Haryana, these terms often describe symptoms that can be caused by various viral infections, including LLCV (which can cause stunting). The general principles for managing such viral symptoms in Litchi are similar to those for Leaf Curl:
    *   **Use Healthy Planting Material:** Essential to start with virus-free plants.
    *   **Rogueing:** Remove and destroy any plants showing severe mosaic, yellow vein clearing, or stunting symptoms suspected to be of viral origin.
    *   **Vector Control:** If a specific vector (like whiteflies, aphids, or mealybugs) is identified or suspected to be associated with these symptoms, apply appropriate insecticides. For general sucking pest control:
        *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: 0.5 ml per liter of water.
        *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: 0.2 g per liter of water.
        *   **Flonicamid** 50% WG: 0.3 g per liter of water.
    *   **Orchard Hygiene:** Maintain good sanitation to reduce potential sources of infection and vector habitats.

3.  **Stripe:**
    This is not known to affect Litchi. Stripe viruses are typically associated with cereal crops.

4.  **Tristeza:**
    This is not known to affect Litchi. Tristeza is a major viral disease primarily affecting citrus crops.

**General Recommendations for Viral Disease Management in Litchi:**

*   **Prevention is Key:** Since there is no cure for viral diseases, preventing their entry and spread is paramount.
*   **Regular Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your Litchi plants for any unusual symptoms, especially on new flushes. Early detection allows for timely intervention.
*   **Consult Experts:** If you observe unusual or severe symptoms, it is advisable to consult with agricultural experts from HAU or the Department of Agriculture for accurate diagnosis and specific recommendations.
