Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice to address macro-nutrient deficiencies in Litchi orchards in Haryana.

It is crucial to conduct a soil test and, if possible, a leaf tissue analysis to accurately diagnose the specific nutrient deficiencies and their severity. The recommendations below are general guidelines for mature bearing Litchi trees and should be adjusted based on your specific soil test results and the age of your trees.

**General Recommendations for Macronutrient Management:**

*   **Soil Testing:** Always begin with a comprehensive soil test to determine the existing nutrient levels and pH. This will help in precise fertilizer application.
*   **Organic Matter:** Incorporating well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost (20-30 kg per tree annually) significantly improves soil health, nutrient retention, and microbial activity, enhancing nutrient availability.
*   **Split Applications:** For soil-applied Nitrogen and Potassium, it is advisable to split the annual dose into 2-3 applications to ensure continuous nutrient availability and minimize losses.

### Addressing Nitrogen (N) Deficiency in Litchi

**Symptoms:**
*   General yellowing (chlorosis) of older leaves, which may progress to younger leaves in severe cases.
*   Stunted growth of shoots and reduced canopy development.
*   Poor flowering and fruit set, leading to reduced yields.

**Correction:**

1.  **Soil Application (for mature bearing trees, 500-1000 g N per tree per year):**
    *   Apply **Urea** (46% N) at 1.1 to 2.2 kg per tree per year.
    *   Alternatively, apply **Calcium Ammonium Nitrate** (25% N) at 2.0 to 4.0 kg per tree per year, especially beneficial if calcium is also required or in acidic soils.
    *   Alternatively, apply **Ammonium Sulphate** (20.5% N) at 2.4 to 4.9 kg per tree per year, which also supplies sulfur and can help in alkaline soils.
    *   **Timing:** Split the annual dose into 2-3 applications:
        *   First application: Before flowering (January-February).
        *   Second application: After fruit set (April-May).
        *   Third application (optional): During fruit development (June-July).

2.  **Foliar Application (for quick relief):**
    *   Spray **Urea** at a concentration of 1-2% (10-20 g/L of water).
    *   **Timing:** Apply during periods of active growth or when deficiency symptoms are observed. Avoid spraying during peak flowering.
    *   Ensure complete coverage of the foliage.

### Addressing Phosphorus (P) Deficiency in Litchi

**Symptoms:**
*   Dark green or purplish discoloration of older leaves.
*   Stunted growth, poor root development, and reduced vigor.
*   Delayed flowering, poor fruit set, and reduced fruit size and quality.

**Correction:**

1.  **Soil Application (for mature bearing trees, 200-400 g P2O5 per tree per year):**
    *   Apply **Single Super Phosphate** (16% P2O5) at 1.25 to 2.5 kg per tree per year. This also provides sulfur and calcium.
    *   Alternatively, apply **Di-Ammonium Phosphate** (18% N, 46% P2O5) at 435 to 870 g per tree per year. This will also contribute to the nitrogen requirement.
    *   Alternatively, apply **Triple Super Phosphate** (46% P2O5) at 435 to 870 g per tree per year.
    *   **Timing:** Apply the full annual dose once, preferably before flowering (January-February) or during the monsoon season (July-August), by broadcasting around the tree basin and incorporating into the soil.

2.  **Foliar Application (for quick relief):**
    *   Spray **Monoammonium Phosphate** (12% N, 61% P2O5) at a concentration of 0.5-1% (5-10 g/L of water).
    *   Alternatively, spray **Potassium Dihydrogen Phosphate** (52% P2O5, 34% K2O) at a concentration of 0.5-1% (5-10 g/L of water), which also supplies potassium.
    *   **Timing:** Apply during periods of active growth or when deficiency symptoms are observed.

### Addressing Potassium (K) Deficiency in Litchi

**Symptoms:**
*   Scorching or browning (necrosis) of leaf margins, particularly on older leaves, often starting from the tip and moving inwards.
*   Weak branches, poor fruit development, and reduced fruit size.
*   Poor fruit quality (taste, color, shelf life) and increased susceptibility to diseases.

**Correction:**

1.  **Soil Application (for mature bearing trees, 500-1000 g K2O per tree per year):**
    *   Apply **Potassium Chloride** (Muriate of Potash, 60% K2O) at 830 g to 1.67 kg per tree per year. This is the most common and economical source.
    *   Alternatively, apply **Potassium Sulphate** (Sulphate of Potash, 50% K2O, 18% S) at 1.0 to 2.0 kg per tree per year, especially if sulfur is also needed or if chloride sensitivity is a concern.
    *   **Timing:** Split the annual dose into 2-3 applications:
        *   First application: Before flowering (January-February).
        *   Second application: During fruit development (May-June).
        *   Third application (optional): After harvest (July-August) to build up reserves.

2.  **Foliar Application (for quick relief):**
    *   Spray **Potassium Nitrate** (13% N, 45% K2O) at a concentration of 1-2% (10-20 g/L of water). This also provides nitrogen.
    *   Alternatively, spray **Potassium Sulphate** (50% K2O) at a concentration of 1-2% (10-20 g/L of water).
    *   Alternatively, spray **Potassium Dihydrogen Phosphate** (52% P2O5, 34% K2O) at a concentration of 0.5-1% (5-10 g/L of water), which also supplies phosphorus.
    *   **Timing:** Apply during fruit development stages to improve fruit quality or when deficiency symptoms are observed.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Irrigation:** Ensure adequate and consistent irrigation, especially after fertilizer application, to help dissolve and move nutrients into the root zone.
*   **Soil pH:** Litchi prefers slightly acidic to neutral soils (pH 6.0-7.0). Extreme pH can lock up nutrients, making them unavailable to the plant even if present in the soil.
*   **Method of Application:** For soil application, spread fertilizers evenly in the tree basin, avoiding direct contact with the trunk, and lightly incorporate them into the soil.
*   **Monitoring:** Regularly monitor your trees for symptom improvement or recurrence, and adjust your fertilization program accordingly.

By following these guidelines and adapting them to your specific orchard conditions, you can effectively manage macronutrient deficiencies in your Litchi trees for healthy growth and optimal fruit production.
