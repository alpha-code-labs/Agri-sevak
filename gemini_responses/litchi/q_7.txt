Namaste,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing diseases in Litchi cultivation in Haryana.

Here's how to control Dieback, Twig blight, and address your query regarding Tikka disease:

### Dieback and Twig Blight in Litchi

Dieback and Twig blight are common fungal diseases in Litchi, often caused by fungi like *Colletotrichum gloeosporioides* (anamorph of *Glomerella cingulata*) or *Lasiodiplodia theobromae*. These diseases can significantly impact tree health and yield if not managed properly.

**Symptoms:**
*   **Dieback:** Characterized by the drying and death of twigs and branches, starting from the tip and progressing downwards. Leaves on affected branches turn brown, curl, and eventually fall off. Cankers may form on branches.
*   **Twig Blight:** Similar to dieback, it involves the rapid browning and death of young shoots and twigs. Lesions may appear on the bark, leading to girdling and death of the affected part.

**Management Strategies:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Pruning:** Regularly inspect trees and prune out all affected twigs and branches well below the diseased portion (at least 15-20 cm into healthy wood). Ensure pruning tools are sterilized with a 1% sodium hypochlorite solution or methylated spirit between cuts to prevent disease spread.
    *   **Sanitation:** Collect and destroy all pruned material by burning to eliminate inoculum sources.
    *   **Orchard Hygiene:** Maintain good orchard hygiene by removing fallen leaves and debris.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure balanced nutrition to enhance tree vigor and resistance. Avoid water stress.

2.  **Chemical Control:**
    *   Apply fungicides as a protective measure, especially during periods of new flush growth and after pruning.
    *   **Post-harvest Pruning & New Flush:**
        *   Spray with **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 0.5-1.0 g/L of water.
        *   Alternatively, use **Propiconazole** 25% EC at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **During Active Growth (if symptoms appear):**
        *   Spray with **Mancozeb** 75% WP at 2.0-2.5 g/L of water.
        *   Alternatively, use **Copper oxychloride** 50% WP at 2.5-3.0 g/L of water.
    *   **Rotation:** Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. For instance, alternate between a systemic fungicide like Carbendazim/Propiconazole and a contact fungicide like Mancozeb/Copper oxychloride.
    *   Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage and branches during spraying.

### Tikka Disease in Litchi

This is not known to affect Litchi. Tikka disease (also known as early and late leaf spot) is a prominent disease of groundnut (peanut) caused by *Cercospora arachidicola* and *Cercosporidium personatum*, respectively. It does not affect Litchi trees.
