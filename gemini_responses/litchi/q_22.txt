As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, I recommend the following cultivation practices for Litchi in Haryana:

Litchi is primarily propagated vegetatively (through air layering or grafting) for commercial cultivation, as plants grown from seeds do not breed true to type and take a much longer time to bear fruit. Therefore, the terms "sowing method" and "seed dose" are not applicable in the traditional sense for commercial Litchi orchards. Instead, we focus on the planting of vegetatively propagated saplings.

Here are the recommended practices:

*   **Planting Method/Pattern:**
    *   Litchi saplings (air layers or grafted plants) are planted in a square system, which facilitates inter-cultural operations.
    *   Pits of 1 meter x 1 meter x 1 meter size should be dug at the recommended spacing during May-June.
    *   These pits should be left open for 15-20 days to expose them to sunlight and air, which helps in pest and disease control.
    *   Before planting, fill each pit with a mixture of topsoil, 20-25 kg of well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM), 1 kg of neem cake, and 500 g of single super phosphate.
    *   Planting is best done during the monsoon season (July-September) or in spring (February-March) when the weather is conducive for establishment.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   The Litchi sapling should be planted at the same depth as it was in the nursery bag or pot.
    *   Ensure that the root ball is completely covered with soil, and the graft union (if it's a grafted plant) remains well above the soil surface.
    *   After planting, gently firm the soil around the base of the plant and water immediately.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   For standard planting, a spacing of **8 meters x 8 meters** is generally recommended. This allows for good canopy development and ease of orchard management.
    *   This spacing accommodates approximately **156 plants per hectare**.
    *   In areas with good soil fertility and irrigation, or for specific varieties, a spacing of **10 meters x 10 meters** can also be adopted, accommodating **100 plants per hectare**.
    *   High-density planting (e.g., 6 meters x 6 meters) can be considered with specific varieties and intensive pruning strategies, but requires more advanced management. For general recommendations in Haryana, 8m x 8m is a good standard.

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   This is not known to affect Litchi. As mentioned, Litchi is commercially propagated vegetatively, not by seeds. Therefore, there is no "seed dose" for establishing a commercial Litchi orchard. The number of plants per unit area is determined by the chosen spacing.
