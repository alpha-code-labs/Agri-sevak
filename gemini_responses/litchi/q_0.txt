Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding fungal diseases in Litchi. Effective management is crucial for a healthy crop and good yield. Here is scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned fungal diseases in Litchi, keeping in mind the conditions in Haryana.

**General Cultural Practices for Fungal Disease Management in Litchi:**

Before discussing specific diseases, it's important to implement good cultural practices that reduce the overall disease pressure:

*   **Orchard Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy fallen leaves, twigs, and mummified fruits, as these can harbor fungal spores. Prune out dead or diseased branches promptly.
*   **Proper Pruning:** Ensure adequate air circulation within the canopy by judicious pruning. This helps reduce humidity, which is favorable for fungal growth.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced fertilizers. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can lead to lush, soft growth more susceptible to fungal infections.
*   **Weed Management:** Keep the orchard floor free of weeds, which can increase humidity and act as alternative hosts for pathogens.
*   **Irrigation Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day, as wet foliage for extended periods promotes fungal development. Drip irrigation is preferred.
*   **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your trees for early signs of disease to enable timely intervention.

**Specific Fungal Diseases and Their Control in Litchi:**

Here's how to manage the fungal diseases you've listed:

**1. Alternaria Leaf Spot and Fruit Rot (Caused by *Alternaria alternata*)**
This disease causes dark brown to black spots on leaves, often with concentric rings. It can also lead to fruit rot, especially during post-harvest.

*   **Control Measures:**
    *   Regularly prune and destroy infected plant parts.
    *   Apply protective fungicides during periods of high humidity and rainfall, especially during flowering and fruit development.
    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   Spray with **Mancozeb** 75% WP at 2.5 grams per litre of water.
        *   Alternatively, use **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC at 0.5-1 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Difenoconazole** 25% EC at 0.5 ml per litre of water can also be effective.

**2. Anthracnose (Caused by *Colletotrichum gloeosporioides* / *C. litchii*)**
Anthracnose is a major disease affecting leaves, flowers, and fruits. It causes irregular dark brown spots on leaves, flower blight (browning and drying of flowers), and dark, sunken lesions on fruits, leading to premature fruit drop and post-harvest rot.

*   **Control Measures:**
    *   Sanitation is key: remove and destroy infected plant parts, especially mummified fruits.
    *   Prune to improve air circulation.
    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   Apply systemic fungicides during flowering and fruit set.
        *   Spray with **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 1 gram per litre of water.
        *   Alternatively, use **Propiconazole** 25% EC at 0.5 ml per litre of water.
        *   A combination of **Carbendazim** 12% + **Mancozeb** 63% WP at 2 grams per litre of water is also highly effective.
        *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC at 0.5-1 ml per litre of water can also be used.

**3. Blast**
This is not known to affect Litchi.

**4. Blight (Flower Blight, Twig Blight, Fruit Blight)**
Blight symptoms in Litchi are often associated with Anthracnose (*Colletotrichum*) or other fungal pathogens like *Pestalotiopsis*. It causes rapid browning and death of flowers, young twigs, or fruit tissues.

*   **Control Measures:**
    *   The control measures are similar to those for Anthracnose.
    *   Prune out blighted twigs and branches immediately.
    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   Spray with **Mancozeb** 75% WP at 2.5 grams per litre of water.
        *   For systemic action, use **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 1 gram per litre of water.
        *   **Copper Oxychloride** 50% WP at 3 grams per litre of water can also be used as a protective spray.

**5. Brown Spot (Caused by *Pestalotiopsis* spp. or *Alternaria* spp.)**
Brown spot typically appears as irregular brown spots on leaves, which can enlarge and coalesce.

*   **Control Measures:**
    *   Maintain good orchard hygiene.
    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   Apply fungicides similar to those used for Alternaria and Anthracnose.
        *   Spray with **Mancozeb** 75% WP at 2.5 grams per litre of water.
        *   **Propiconazole** 25% EC at 0.5 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC at 0.5-1 ml per litre of water.

**6. Downy Mildew (Caused by *Peronophythora litchii*)**
This is a very serious disease, especially on flowers and young fruits, causing significant yield loss. It appears as water-soaked lesions that turn purplish-brown, often with a white, downy growth on the underside of leaves or infected parts during humid conditions.

*   **Control Measures:**
    *   This disease thrives in cool, wet conditions. Monitor closely during such periods.
    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   Apply systemic fungicides specifically effective against oomycetes.
        *   Spray with **Metalaxyl** 8% + **Mancozeb** 64% WP at 2.5 grams per litre of water.
        *   Alternatively, use **Propamocarb hydrochloride** 72.2% SL at 2.5 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Fenamidone** 10% + **Mancozeb** 50% WG at 2 grams per litre of water is also effective.

**7. Powdery Mildew (Caused by *Oidium litchii*)**
Powdery mildew appears as white, powdery patches on young leaves, flowers, and fruits. Infected flowers may fail to set fruit, and infected fruits may become malformed or drop prematurely.

*   **Control Measures:**
    *   Prune to improve air circulation.
    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   Apply fungicides at the first sign of the disease, especially during flowering.
        *   Spray with **Wettable Sulphur** 80% WP at 2-3 grams per litre of water.
        *   Alternatively, use **Hexaconazole** 5% EC at 1 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Myclobutanil** 10% WP at 0.5 gram per litre of water is also highly effective.
        *   **Penconazole** 10% EC at 0.5 ml per litre of water.

**8. Grey Mildew**
This is not known to affect Litchi.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Spray Schedule:** For effective control, initiate sprays preventively before disease onset or at the very first appearance of symptoms. Repeat sprays at 10-15 day intervals, especially during critical growth stages (flowering, fruit set, and fruit development) and periods favorable for disease development (high humidity, rainfall).
*   **Alternation of Fungicides:** To prevent the development of fungicide resistance, it is crucial to alternate fungicides with different modes of action.
*   **Adjuvants:** Always use a good quality spreader/sticker (adjuvant) with your fungicide sprays to ensure better coverage and adherence to the plant surface.
*   **Safety:** Always read and follow the instructions on the fungicide label regarding dosage, application, and safety precautions. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying.

By adopting an integrated approach combining cultural practices and timely chemical interventions, you can effectively manage fungal diseases in your Litchi orchard. For any specific concerns or severe outbreaks, please consult with your local agricultural extension officer.
