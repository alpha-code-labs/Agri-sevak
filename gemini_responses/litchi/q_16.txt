Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following fertilizer schedule for Litchi cultivation in Haryana. Please note that these are general recommendations, and a soil test is always the most accurate way to determine the precise nutrient requirements for your specific orchard.

**General Principles for Litchi Fertilization:**
Litchi is a heavy feeder, especially of Nitrogen (N) and Potassium (K), with Phosphorus (P) also being crucial for root development and flowering. The fertilizer dose varies significantly with the age and bearing status of the tree.

### Recommended Fertilizer Doses for Litchi

**1. For Young (Non-Bearing) Litchi Trees (1-3 years old):**
The aim is to promote vigorous vegetative growth. Apply fertilizers in two equal splits, one in July-August and another in October-November.

*   **Year 1 (per tree per year):**
    *   **Urea**: 200 g
    *   **DAP**: 100 g
    *   **Potash** (Muriate of Potash): 80 g
    *   **Sulphur** (Bentonite Sulphur 90%): 50 g (optional, if not using SSP)

*   **Year 2 (per tree per year):**
    *   **Urea**: 400 g
    *   **DAP**: 200 g
    *   **Potash** (Muriate of Potash): 160 g
    *   **Sulphur** (Bentonite Sulphur 90%): 100 g (optional, if not using SSP)

*   **Year 3 (per tree per year):**
    *   **Urea**: 600 g
    *   **DAP**: 300 g
    *   **Potash** (Muriate of Potash): 240 g
    *   **Sulphur** (Bentonite Sulphur 90%): 150 g (optional, if not using SSP)

**2. For Mature (Bearing) Litchi Trees (4 years and above):**
The doses are for a well-established, productive tree. Adjust based on tree size, yield, and soil test results. Apply **DAP**, **Potash**, and **Sulphur** in two equal splits:
    1.  After fruit harvest (July-August).
    2.  Before flowering (October-November).
Apply **Urea** in 3-4 splits:
    1.  After fruit harvest.
    2.  Before flowering.
    3.  During fruit development (March-April).
    4.  (Optional) During peak vegetative flush.

*   **Per tree per year (for a tree yielding 50-100 kg fruit):**
    *   **Urea**: 1.0 - 1.5 kg
    *   **DAP**: 0.75 - 1.0 kg
    *   **Potash** (Muriate of Potash): 1.0 - 1.5 kg
    *   **Sulphur** (Bentonite Sulphur 90%): 200 - 300 g (annually or biennially, if not using SSP)

*   **Alternative for Phosphorus and Sulphur:**
    *   If using **SSP** (Single Super Phosphate) instead of **DAP**, the dose would be higher due to lower P2O5 content (16% in SSP vs. 46% in DAP).
    *   For a mature tree, approximately 2.0 - 2.5 kg of **SSP** can replace the **DAP** requirement, which also provides Sulphur (11% S in SSP). If using **SSP**, adjust **Urea** dose upwards as **SSP** contains no Nitrogen.

*   **NPK Complex Fertilizers:**
    *   **NPK** complex fertilizers (e.g., 10:26:26, 12:32:16, 19:19:19) can be used to provide balanced nutrition.
    *   For mature trees, 1.0 - 2.0 kg of a suitable **NPK** complex fertilizer can be applied per tree per year, adjusting the doses of individual **Urea**, **DAP**, and **Potash** accordingly to meet the total NPK requirement. For example, 1 kg of 10:26:26 provides 100g N, 260g P2O5, and 260g K2O.

**3. Nano Fertilizers (Foliar Application):**
Nano fertilizers are highly efficient and are applied as foliar sprays, supplementing the soil-applied fertilizers. They can help reduce the requirement for conventional fertilizers by 25-50%.

*   **Nano-Urea (Liquid):**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Application:** Apply 2-3 sprays during critical growth stages:
        1.  During active vegetative growth (after harvest).
        2.  Before flowering (October-November).
        3.  During fruit development (March-April).

*   **Nano-DAP (Liquid):**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Application:** Apply 2 sprays during critical stages:
        1.  Before flowering (October-November).
        2.  At fruit set stage.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Soil Testing:** Always conduct a soil test every 2-3 years to get precise recommendations tailored to your soil's nutrient status.
*   **Method of Application:** Fertilizers should be broadcast evenly in the tree basin, 30-60 cm away from the trunk, extending up to the drip line. Incorporate them into the soil by light digging and then irrigate immediately.
*   **Water Management:** Adequate irrigation is crucial for nutrient uptake. Ensure proper moisture levels, especially after fertilizer application.
*   **Micronutrients:** Litchi also requires micronutrients like Zinc, Boron, Copper, Manganese, and Iron. If deficiencies are observed or indicated by soil tests, apply appropriate micronutrient formulations as foliar sprays or soil applications. Boron deficiency is common in Litchi and can lead to fruit cracking. Apply Borax (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate) at 100-200 g per mature tree or foliar spray of Boric acid (1.5-2 g/L) before flowering and at fruit set.

By following these scientifically verified recommendations, you can ensure healthy growth and optimal fruit production in your Litchi orchard.
