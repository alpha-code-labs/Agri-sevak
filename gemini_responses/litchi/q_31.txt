As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling physical damage in Litchi cultivation in Haryana:

It is important to understand that these physical damages are often a result of environmental stress, nutrient imbalances, and improper cultural practices. An integrated approach combining cultural, nutritional, and protective measures is most effective.

### 1. Fruit Bursting (Fruit Cracking)

**Causes:**
Fruit bursting is primarily caused by sudden fluctuations in soil moisture (e.g., heavy rain or irrigation after a dry spell), high temperatures, low humidity, and deficiencies of certain micronutrients like Boron and Calcium. Varietal susceptibility also plays a significant role.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Consistent Soil Moisture:** Maintain uniform soil moisture, especially during fruit development and ripening. Avoid extremes of drought followed by heavy irrigation.
*   **Mulching:** Apply organic mulch (straw, dry leaves, sugarcane trash) around the tree base to conserve soil moisture, regulate soil temperature, and reduce evaporation.
*   **Shade Management:** Provide partial shade during peak summer months using shade nets (30-50% shade) to reduce direct sun exposure and maintain humidity around the fruits.
*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Boron:** Boron improves cell wall elasticity. Apply foliar sprays of:
        *   **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** at 1.5-2.0 g/L water, or
        *   **Sodium tetraborate decahydrate** (Borax) at 3-4 g/L water.
        Apply at fruit set and repeat 15-20 days later.
    *   **Calcium:** Calcium strengthens cell walls. Apply foliar sprays of:
        *   **Calcium nitrate** at 5-7 g/L water, or
        *   **Calcium chloride** at 3-5 g/L water.
        Apply during the fruit development stage (pea to marble size).
*   **Varietal Selection:** Choose less susceptible varieties if possible, though most commercial varieties can experience cracking under adverse conditions.

### 2. Leaf Burning/Melting (Sunburn/Heat Stress)

**Causes:**
This condition is typically caused by high temperatures, intense solar radiation, low humidity, and water stress, especially during the hot summer months in Haryana. Young leaves and fruits are particularly vulnerable.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Adequate Irrigation:** Ensure consistent and sufficient irrigation, particularly during hot and dry periods, to prevent water stress.
*   **Shade Provision:**
    *   Use overhead shade nets (30-50% shade) during the peak summer months to protect the canopy from direct, intense sunlight.
    *   Maintain a dense, healthy canopy through proper pruning to provide natural shade to inner leaves and developing fruits.
*   **Mulching:** Apply organic mulch to the tree basin to keep the soil cool and conserve moisture.
*   **Foliar Sprays:**
    *   **Kaolin clay:** Spraying a solution of **Kaolin clay** at 50-70 g/L water can create a reflective film on leaves, reducing leaf temperature and sunburn.
    *   **Potassium nitrate:** Foliar application of **Potassium nitrate** at 5-10 g/L water can help improve the plant's tolerance to heat and drought stress.
*   **Windbreaks:** Plant windbreak trees around the orchard perimeter to reduce hot, dry winds that exacerbate heat stress and desiccation.

### 3. Hardness in Fruit (Poor Fruit Development/Quality)

**Causes:**
Hardness in Litchi fruit, often indicating poor development or quality, can be attributed to several factors including nutrient deficiencies (especially Potassium and Phosphorus), inadequate water supply, extreme temperatures during fruit development, excessive fruit load, or premature harvesting.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure a balanced supply of macro and micronutrients based on soil test recommendations.
    *   **Potassium:** Potassium is crucial for fruit development, sugar accumulation, and overall fruit quality. Apply foliar sprays of:
        *   **Potassium sulphate** at 10-15 g/L water, or
        *   **Potassium nitrate** at 10-15 g/L water.
        Apply during the fruit development and ripening stages.
    *   **Phosphorus:** Phosphorus is essential for energy transfer and fruit maturation. Apply foliar sprays of:
        *   **Monoammonium phosphate** at 5-10 g/L water, or
        *   **Monopotassium phosphate** at 5-10 g/L water.
        Apply during early fruit development.
*   **Consistent Water Management:** Maintain optimal soil moisture throughout the fruit development period. Both water stress and waterlogging can negatively impact fruit quality.
*   **Fruit Thinning:** If the fruit load is excessively high, judicious fruit thinning can reduce competition among fruits, leading to better development and quality of the remaining fruits.
*   **Canopy Management:** Proper pruning to allow adequate light penetration and air circulation within the canopy can improve fruit development and ripening.
*   **Timely Harvesting:** Harvest fruits at their optimal maturity stage. Premature harvesting can result in hard, sour, and poorly developed fruits.

For precise nutrient recommendations, it is always advisable to conduct a soil test and, if possible, a leaf tissue analysis for your orchard.
