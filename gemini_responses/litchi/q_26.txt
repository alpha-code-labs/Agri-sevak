As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified information on specialized practices for Litchi cultivation in Haryana:

### Specialized Practices in Litchi Cultivation

**1. Pruning**
Pruning is essential for shaping the tree, promoting new growth, maintaining tree health, and ensuring optimal fruit production.

*   **Formative Pruning:** In young trees (1-3 years), prune to establish a strong framework of 3-4 well-spaced main branches. Remove any weak, crossing, or inward-growing shoots.
*   **Maintenance Pruning:**
    *   **Timing:** Immediately after fruit harvest (typically May-June in Haryana). This allows new vegetative flushes to mature before the next flowering season.
    *   **Method:** Lightly prune the fruited panicles by cutting back 15-20 cm of the shoot along with the harvested fruit stalk. Ensure that some leaves remain on the branch to support new growth. Remove dead, diseased, weak, or overcrowded branches.
*   **Rejuvenation Pruning:** For old, unproductive trees, more severe pruning can be undertaken to stimulate new vigorous growth, though this is a specialized practice and should be done carefully.

**2. Desuckering**
Desuckering involves the removal of unwanted shoots (suckers) that arise from the rootstock or the base of the scion.

*   **Objective:** Suckers compete with the main plant for nutrients and water, reducing its vigor and productivity. They are often unproductive and can alter the desired tree structure.
*   **Timing:** Regularly, as soon as suckers are observed.
*   **Method:** Physically remove suckers by hand or with sharp secateurs, cutting them as close to their point of origin as possible.

**3. Mulching**
Mulching is the practice of covering the soil surface around the tree with a layer of material.

*   **Objective:**
    *   Conserves soil moisture by reducing evaporation.
    *   Suppresses weed growth, reducing competition for nutrients and water.
    *   Regulates soil temperature, keeping it cooler in summer and warmer in winter.
    *   Improves soil structure and fertility (with organic mulches).
    *   Reduces soil erosion.
*   **Materials:** Organic mulches such as paddy straw, wheat straw, sugarcane trash, dry leaves, or well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) are highly recommended. Black plastic mulch can also be used.
*   **Application:** Apply a uniform layer of 10-15 cm thickness around the tree base, extending to the drip line. Ensure a small gap (5-10 cm) is left around the tree trunk to prevent collar rot and pest infestation.
*   **Timing:** Best applied before the onset of summer or the monsoon season. Replenish the mulch layer as it decomposes or thins out.

**4. Grafting**
While air layering (gootee) is the most common commercial propagation method for Litchi, grafting can also be employed, particularly for specific purposes like top-working or propagating difficult-to-root varieties.

*   **Common Grafting Methods:**
    *   **Approach Grafting (Inarching):** This method is often successful for Litchi. Both scion and rootstock remain attached to their parent plants until a successful union is formed.
    *   **Veneer Grafting:** Can be performed on seedling rootstocks.
*   **Rooting Hormones (for Air Layering, if applicable):** For enhancing root development in air layering, plant growth regulators can be used.
    *   **Indole-3-butyric acid (IBA)**
    *   **Naphthalene acetic acid (NAA)**
*   **Timing:** The monsoon season (July-August) is generally favorable for grafting and air layering due to high humidity, which promotes better success rates.

**5. Pollination**
Effective pollination is crucial for good fruit set and yield in Litchi.

*   **Flower Biology:** Litchi trees produce three types of flowers: male flowers (M1), functionally female hermaphrodite flowers (M2), and later male flowers (M3). The M2 flowers are critical for fruit set.
*   **Pollinators:** Litchi is primarily insect-pollinated. Honeybees are the most important and efficient pollinators.
*   **Practices to Enhance Pollination:**
    *   **Bee Hives:** Introduce 3-4 bee hives per acre (or per hectare, depending on tree density) into the orchard during the flowering period to ensure adequate cross-pollination.
    *   **Pesticide Management:** Avoid spraying insecticides during the flowering period to protect pollinator populations. If spraying is necessary, use bee-friendly pesticides and apply them in the late evening or early morning when bees are less active.
    *   **Variety Selection:** While many Litchi varieties are considered self-fertile, planting a mix of varieties can sometimes improve cross-pollination and fruit set, especially if there are issues with self-incompatibility in a specific cultivar.
*   **Environmental Factors:** Adverse weather conditions such as heavy rain, strong winds, or extreme temperatures during flowering can negatively impact bee activity and pollen viability, leading to poor fruit set.
