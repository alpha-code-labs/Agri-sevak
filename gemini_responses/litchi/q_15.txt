As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in Litchi orchards in Haryana:

Here's how to manage the mentioned pests:

### Grasshopper

Grasshoppers can cause damage by feeding on young leaves, shoots, and sometimes developing fruits.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Maintain good orchard hygiene by removing weeds, which can serve as breeding grounds for grasshoppers.
    *   Deep ploughing during off-season can expose and destroy eggs laid in the soil.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   For severe infestations, especially on young trees or new flushes, chemical intervention may be necessary. Apply insecticides during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening).
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC**: 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Malathion 50% EC**: 2 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Azadirachtin 1500 ppm**: 5 ml per litre of water (for early instar nymphs or as part of an organic management strategy).

### Painted Bug (Bagrada hilaris)

This is not known to affect Litchi. Painted bugs are primarily pests of cruciferous crops (e.g., mustard, cabbage, cauliflower) and are not typically found causing damage to Litchi trees.

### Red Cotton Bug (Dysdercus cingulatus)

This is not known to affect Litchi. Red cotton bugs are primarily pests of cotton and other malvaceous plants, feeding on seeds. They are not typically found causing damage to Litchi trees.

### Black Ants

Black ants in Litchi orchards are often secondary pests, attracted to the honeydew secreted by sap-sucking insects like aphids, mealybugs, and scales. They protect these pests from natural enemies, exacerbating the sap-sucker problem. They can also directly damage flowers or young fruits in search of nectar or sugary exudates.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Identify and control the primary sap-sucking pests (aphids, mealybugs, scales) if present, as this will reduce the ants' food source (honeydew).
    *   Maintain good orchard sanitation.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Trunk Banding:** To prevent ants from climbing the tree, apply a sticky band or an insecticide band around the tree trunk.
        *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC**: Mix 2.5 ml per litre of water and apply as a band around the base of the trunk, ensuring it does not come into direct contact with the fruit or edible parts of the plant.
    *   **Targeted Spray:** For ants directly on the tree or around the base.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC**: 0.5 ml per litre of water, applied to ant trails on the trunk and branches, avoiding direct spray on flowers or fruits if possible.
    *   **Baiting:** Ant baits can be effective for controlling colonies, but ensure they are placed safely away from non-target organisms.
        *   **Fipronil 0.0143% Gel Bait**: Apply small dabs of gel bait near ant trails or entry points.

Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully, including dosage, application method, and pre-harvest interval (PHI). For specific recommendations tailored to your farm, it is advisable to consult with the local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts.
