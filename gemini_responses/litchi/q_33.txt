As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling weeds in Litchi orchards in Haryana:

Effective weed management in Litchi orchards requires an integrated approach combining cultural, mechanical, and chemical methods. It is crucial to identify the weeds correctly and apply control measures at the appropriate time to minimize competition with the Litchi trees and ensure their healthy growth.

**Regarding Orobanche (Broomrape):**
This is not known to affect Litchi. Orobanche species are obligate root parasites primarily affecting dicotyledonous field crops like mustard, brinjal, tomato, and tobacco, and are not typically a concern for Litchi trees.

**General Weed Control Strategy (for Broadleaf, Narrowleaf, Bathu, Congress grass, and Phalaris minor):**

These weeds can be managed using a combination of pre-emergent and post-emergent herbicides, along with cultural practices.

**1. Pre-emergent Herbicides (for preventing weed germination):**
Apply these herbicides to moist soil before weed seeds germinate. Ensure uniform coverage.

*   **For Broadleaf and Narrowleaf Weeds:**
    *   **Diuron** 80% WP at 1.6 - 2.0 kg/acre in 200-300 L of water. (Suitable for mature orchards, avoid contact with young tree roots).
    *   **Oxyfluorfen** 23.5% EC at 400-800 ml/acre in 200-300 L of water.
    *   **Pendimethalin** 30% EC at 1.0 - 1.3 L/acre in 200-300 L of water. (Effective against grasses and some broadleaf weeds).

**2. Post-emergent Herbicides (for controlling existing weeds):**
These should be applied when weeds are young and actively growing. Always use a directed spray to avoid contact with Litchi foliage, trunk, or exposed roots, especially with non-selective herbicides.

*   **Non-selective Herbicides (for both broadleaf and narrowleaf weeds, including Bathu, Congress grass, and Phalaris minor):**
    *   **Glyphosate** 41% SL at 1.0 - 1.5 L/acre in 200-300 L of water. (Add a non-ionic surfactant for improved efficacy).
    *   **Paraquat dichloride** 24% SL at 600 - 800 ml/acre in 200-300 L of water. (Contact herbicide, provides quick knockdown).

*   **Selective Herbicides (specifically for Narrowleaf Weeds/Grasses like Phalaris minor):**
    *   **Quizalofop ethyl** 5% EC at 400 - 500 ml/acre in 200-300 L of water.
    *   **Fluazifop-P-butyl** 13.4% EC at 500 - 750 ml/acre in 200-300 L of water.

**Control of Amarbail (Cuscuta spp.):**

Amarbail is a parasitic weed that can severely affect Litchi trees. Its control requires diligent and timely action.

*   **Manual Removal:** This is the most effective and recommended method. Regularly inspect Litchi trees and surrounding vegetation. As soon as Amarbail strands are detected, carefully remove them by hand, ensuring no fragments are left behind. Dispose of the removed material by burning or burying it away from the orchard to prevent re-infestation.
*   **Pruning:** If Amarbail has heavily infested a specific branch, it may be necessary to prune the affected branch to completely remove the parasite.
*   **Pre-emergent:**
    *   **Pendimethalin** 30% EC at 1.0 - 1.3 L/acre in 200-300 L of water, applied to the soil surface, can help reduce the germination of Amarbail seeds from the soil seed bank.
*   **Post-emergent (for ground-level Amarbail or heavily infested non-crop areas near Litchi):**
    *   **Glyphosate** 41% SL at 1.0 - 1.5 L/acre in 200-300 L of water, can be used as a very careful, directed spray to Amarbail growing on the ground or on non-crop hosts. Extreme caution must be exercised to ensure absolutely no spray drift or contact with Litchi trees, as Glyphosate is non-selective and will damage the Litchi. This method is generally not recommended for Amarbail directly on Litchi trees due to the high risk of damage.

**Important Considerations for Herbicide Application:**

*   **Timing:** Apply pre-emergent herbicides to moist soil before weed germination. Apply post-emergent herbicides when weeds are young (2-4 leaf stage) and actively growing for optimal results.
*   **Directed Spray:** Always use a protective shield or hood when applying post-emergent non-selective herbicides (like Glyphosate or Paraquat dichloride) to prevent drift onto Litchi foliage, bark, or young shoots.
*   **Water Volume:** Ensure adequate water volume for thorough coverage of the target weeds.
*   **Sprayer Calibration:** Calibrate your sprayer regularly to ensure accurate application rates and avoid under or over-dosing.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) as recommended on the herbicide label.
*   **Young Trees:** Exercise extreme caution with herbicides around young Litchi trees (less than 3-4 years old). Manual weeding or mulching is often preferred in the initial years to avoid any potential herbicide damage.
*   **Integrated Weed Management:** Combine chemical control with cultural practices such as mulching (using organic materials like straw, wood chips, or black plastic mulch), inter-row cultivation (if feasible and not damaging to tree roots), and regular manual weeding to achieve sustainable and effective weed management in your Litchi orchard.
