As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for improving Litchi yield, fruit quality, and storage life in Haryana.

It is crucial to adopt an integrated approach, combining good horticultural practices with judicious use of specific inputs.

### I. Improving Yield

To maximize Litchi yield, focus on optimal plant health, flowering, and fruit set:

1.  **Variety Selection:** Choose high-yielding varieties well-suited to Haryana's climate, such as 'Dehradun', 'Calcutta (Late)', 'Shahi', and 'China'.
2.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Ensure balanced NPK fertilization based on soil test reports.
    *   **Micronutrients:** Boron and Zinc are critical for flowering and fruit set.
        *   Foliar spray of **borax** (1-2 g/L) or **disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (0.5-1 g/L) before flowering and at pea-size fruit stage.
        *   Foliar spray of **zinc sulphate** (5 g/L) before flowering.
3.  **Water Management:** Provide consistent irrigation, especially during flowering and fruit development stages. Avoid water stress, which can lead to flower and fruit drop.
4.  **Pollination:** Litchi relies heavily on insect pollination.
    *   Place bee hives in the orchard during flowering.
    *   Avoid spraying insecticides during the flowering period to protect pollinators.
5.  **Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs):**
    *   To enhance fruit set and reduce fruit drop: Foliar spray of **naphthalene acetic acid (NAA)** at 10-20 ppm (0.01-0.02 g/L) when fruits are at pea size.
6.  **Pruning:** Regular pruning after harvest helps maintain tree vigor, canopy structure, and promotes new growth for subsequent flowering.

### II. Enhancing Fruit Quality (Size, Colour, Sweetness, Texture)

For superior fruit quality, focus on nutrient balance, water availability, and protection:

1.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Potassium:** Essential for sugar accumulation, fruit size, and color development. Apply **potassium nitrate** (10-20 g/L) as a foliar spray during fruit development.
    *   **Calcium:** Improves fruit firmness, reduces cracking, and enhances shelf life. Foliar spray of **calcium nitrate** (5-10 g/L) during fruit development.
    *   **Boron:** Prevents fruit cracking and improves overall fruit quality. (Refer to yield section for application details).
2.  **Water Management:** Maintain consistent soil moisture throughout fruit development. Erratic watering can lead to fruit cracking and poor quality.
3.  **Fruit Thinning:** If fruit set is excessively heavy, manual thinning of some fruit clusters can lead to larger, better-quality remaining fruits.
4.  **Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs):**
    *   To improve fruit size: Foliar spray of **gibberellic acid (GA3)** at 25-50 ppm (0.025-0.05 g/L) at the pea-size fruit stage.
    *   For enhanced color development (use with caution): Foliar spray of **ethephon** at 100-200 ppm (0.1-0.2 ml/L of 40% SL formulation) 7-10 days before anticipated harvest. Overuse can lead to premature fruit drop.
5.  **Protection from Sunburn and Cracking:**
    *   Ensure adequate soil moisture.
    *   Consider using shade nets during peak summer heat in areas prone to sunburn.

### III. Extending Storage Life

To prolong the freshness and marketability of Litchi, focus on pre-harvest treatments, careful harvesting, and post-harvest handling:

1.  **Pre-harvest Treatments:**
    *   **Calcium:** Foliar sprays of **calcium chloride** or **calcium nitrate** (5-10 g/L) 2-3 weeks before harvest can significantly improve fruit firmness and reduce post-harvest decay and browning.
    *   **Boron:** As mentioned, contributes to fruit integrity and reduces cracking, indirectly aiding storage.
2.  **Optimal Harvesting:**
    *   Harvest fruits at physiological maturity (when they achieve full characteristic color and flavor).
    *   Harvest early in the morning or late in the evening to avoid heat stress.
    *   Handle fruits gently to prevent bruising, which accelerates spoilage.
    *   Harvest with a small portion of the stem attached to reduce moisture loss and decay.
3.  **Post-harvest Treatments:**
    *   **Fungicide Dip:** Immediately after harvest, dip fruits in a solution of **carbendazim** (1 g/L) or **thiophanate-methyl** (1 g/L) for 2-3 minutes to control post-harvest rots.
    *   **Plant Growth Regulators:** Dipping fruits in a solution of **gibberellic acid (GA3)** (25-50 ppm or 0.025-0.05 g/L) can help maintain freshness and reduce browning.
    *   **Rapid Cooling (Pre-cooling):** Immediately cool harvested fruits to 2-4°C to remove field heat and slow down metabolic processes.
    *   **Packaging:** Pack fruits in perforated plastic bags or punnets to maintain high humidity (90-95% RH) and prevent moisture loss.
    *   **Storage Conditions:** Store fruits at 2-4°C with 90-95% relative humidity for optimal shelf life.

**Important Note:** Always consult with local agricultural extension specialists or HAU experts for precise dosages and timings of chemical applications, as these can vary based on specific Litchi variety, soil type, and prevailing climatic conditions in your area. Adhere strictly to the instructions on product labels.
