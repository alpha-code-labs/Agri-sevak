As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I will provide scientifically verified advice for managing these pests in Pigeon pea (Arhar) in Haryana.

Effective pest management in Pigeon pea requires an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical control methods.

### Control of Borers and Caterpillars (e.g., Gram Pod Borer - *Helicoverpa armigera*, Spotted Pod Borer - *Maruca vitrata*, Plume Moth - *Exelastis atomosa*, and other defoliating caterpillars)

These are major lepidopteran pests of Pigeon pea, often causing significant yield losses.

**1. Cultural Control Measures:**
*   **Early Sowing:** Sowing early maturing varieties in the first fortnight of June can help escape peak pest incidence.
*   **Resistant/Tolerant Varieties:** Utilize varieties recommended by HAU that show tolerance or resistance to pod borers.
*   **Intercropping:** Intercropping with sorghum, maize, or pearl millet can act as a barrier or trap crop, reducing pest incidence.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove crop residues and weeds that can harbor pests.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** After harvest, deep ploughing helps expose pupae to predators and harsh weather conditions.
*   **Bird Perches:** Install bird perches (T-shaped stakes) in the field to encourage predatory birds to feed on larvae.
*   **Pheromone Traps:** Install pheromone traps at 5 traps/acre for monitoring adult moth activity. If catches are consistently high (more than 8-10 moths/trap/night for 2-3 consecutive nights), it indicates a need for intervention.

**2. Biological Control Measures:**
*   **Bio-pesticides:** Apply Neem Seed Kernel Extract (NSKE) 5% at the initial stage of pest incidence.
*   **Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt):** Use Bt formulations (e.g., *Bacillus thuringiensis* var. *kurstaki*) at recommended dosages, especially against early instar larvae.
*   **Parasitoids:** Release *Trichogramma chilonis* or *Trichogramma brasiliensis* egg parasitoids at 50,000-1,00,000 eggs/acre, 3-4 times at weekly intervals, starting from flowering.
*   **Nuclear Polyhedrosis Virus (NPV):** Apply *Helicoverpa armigera* NPV (HaNPV) at 250-500 LE (Larval Equivalents)/acre, preferably in the evening, mixed with a sticker/spreader.

**3. Chemical Control Measures:**
When pest incidence crosses the Economic Threshold Level (ETL) (e.g., 1-2 larvae/plant or 10-15% pod damage), chemical intervention may be necessary. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

*   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC** at 200 ml/acre
*   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG** at 220 g/acre
*   **Indoxacarb 14.5% SC** at 500 ml/acre
*   **Flubendiamide 39.35% SC** at 100 ml/acre
*   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC** at 200 ml/acre
*   **Profenofos 50% EC** at 1.0 L/acre
*   **Spinosad 45% SC** at 60-75 ml/acre

Ensure thorough coverage of the crop, especially the flowering and podding parts, using appropriate spray volume (e.g., 200-250 litres of water per acre).

### Diamondback Moth (*Plutella xylostella*)

This is not known to affect Pigeon pea. Diamondback moth is a specific pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower, mustard).

### Leaf Folder (*Grapholita critica* and other species)

Leaf folders in Pigeon pea are also lepidopteran pests, and their management often overlaps with that of borers and other caterpillars.

**1. Cultural Control Measures:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infested leaves and plant debris.
*   **Monitoring:** Regularly scout fields for folded leaves and larvae.

**2. Chemical Control Measures:**
The insecticides recommended for borers and caterpillars are generally effective against leaf folders as well, given they belong to the same insect order (Lepidoptera).

*   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC** at 200 ml/acre
*   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG** at 220 g/acre
*   **Indoxacarb 14.5% SC** at 500 ml/acre
*   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC** at 200 ml/acre

**Important Considerations for Chemical Application:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying.
*   Spray during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   Avoid spraying during peak bee activity to protect pollinators.
*   Maintain a pre-harvest interval (PHI) as specified on the label before harvesting.
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.
