As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend the following doses for organic manures and bio-stimulants in Pigeon pea cultivation in Haryana, keeping in mind the goal of improving soil health and crop productivity:

*   **Farm Yard Manure (FYM):**
    *   Apply **8-10 tonnes per acre** at least 2-3 weeks before sowing, incorporating it thoroughly into the soil. This helps in improving soil structure, water retention, and provides a slow release of essential nutrients.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   Apply **2-4 tonnes per acre** before sowing, incorporating it into the soil. Vermicompost is richer in nutrients and microbial activity compared to FYM, making it a highly effective organic amendment.

*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract based Bio-stimulant):**
    *   Sagarika is a seaweed extract-based bio-stimulant, not a bulk organic manure like FYM or vermicompost. It is typically applied as a foliar spray or through soil drenching to enhance plant growth and stress tolerance.
        *   **Foliar Spray:** Mix **250-500 ml per acre** in 150-200 litres of water and spray at critical growth stages (e.g., vegetative growth, pre-flowering, and pod development).
        *   **Soil Application/Drench:** For soil application, **1-2 litres per acre** can be applied, usually mixed with irrigation water or as a drench around the root zone.
