Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the challenges posed by environmental stresses on our valuable crops like Pigeon pea (Arhar/Tur). Protecting your crop from extreme weather conditions is crucial for ensuring a good yield. Here is scientifically verified advice to mitigate the impact of extreme cold, frost, heat (Loo), and intense sunlight on Pigeon pea in Haryana:

### A. Protection from Extreme Cold and Frost

Pigeon pea is sensitive to frost, especially during its flowering and pod development stages, which typically coincide with the winter months in Haryana.

1.  **Timely Irrigation:**
    *   Apply a light irrigation to the field in the evening, especially if frost is predicted. Water has a higher specific heat capacity and releases latent heat slowly, which can raise the temperature of the air layer immediately above the soil surface by 1-2°C, protecting the crop.

2.  **Nutrient Management (Potassium):**
    *   Ensure adequate potassium nutrition. Potassium helps in increasing the cell sap concentration, making the plants more tolerant to cold stress.
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Potassium Chloride** (Muriate of Potash) at 20-30 kg/acre as a basal dose or top dressing if not already done.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** In anticipation of cold waves, spray 0.5-1.0% solution of **Potassium Nitrate** (5-10 g/L water) on the foliage. This can be repeated after 10-15 days if cold conditions persist.

3.  **Smudging (Smoke Generation):**
    *   In small fields or during severe frost warnings, burning farm waste (dry leaves, crop residues) on the upwind side of the field during late night and early morning hours (2 AM to 6 AM) can create a smoke cover. This smoke layer traps heat and prevents its escape, raising the ambient temperature around the plants. This method is labor-intensive and less practical for large areas.

4.  **Variety Selection:**
    *   Whenever possible, choose short-duration varieties of Pigeon pea that mature before the onset of severe winter and frost conditions in your region.

### B. Protection from Heat (Loo) and Intense Sunlight

Pigeon pea is generally heat-tolerant, but extreme heat, especially during flowering and podding, can lead to flower drop, poor pod set, and reduced grain filling. Intense sunlight can exacerbate water stress.

1.  **Timely and Adequate Irrigation:**
    *   Provide critical irrigations during the flowering and pod development stages. Water stress combined with high temperatures is highly detrimental. Irrigation helps in cooling the plant canopy and maintaining turgor.

2.  **Mulching:**
    *   Apply a layer of organic mulch (e.g., wheat straw, paddy straw, or other crop residues) 5-7 cm thick between rows. Mulching helps in reducing soil temperature, conserving soil moisture by minimizing evaporation, and suppressing weeds.

3.  **Foliar Sprays for Heat Stress Mitigation:**
    *   **Potassium Nitrate:** Spray a 0.5-1.0% solution of **Potassium Nitrate** (5-10 g/L water) during periods of high temperature, especially at the pre-flowering and pod development stages. This helps in improving heat tolerance and reducing flower abortion.
    *   **Salicylic Acid:** Foliar application of **Salicylic Acid** at 100-200 ppm (0.1-0.2 g/L water) can induce systemic acquired tolerance to heat stress in plants.
    *   **Glycine Betaine:** Spraying **Glycine Betaine** at 1000-2000 ppm (1-2 g/L water) acts as an osmoprotectant, helping plant cells maintain their physiological functions under heat and drought stress.
    *   **Kaolin Clay:** A 3-5% suspension of **Kaolin Clay** (30-50 g/L water) can be sprayed on the foliage. Kaolin acts as a reflective anti-transpirant, reducing leaf temperature and water loss by reflecting sunlight. Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.

By adopting these scientifically proven practices, you can significantly reduce the adverse impact of environmental stresses on your Pigeon pea crop and secure a better harvest.
