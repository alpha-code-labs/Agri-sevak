Mites, including Red spider mite (Tetranychus urticae) and Rust mite (Eriophyes cajani), can cause significant damage to Pigeon pea (Arhar) crops in Haryana, leading to yield losses. As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend the following scientifically verified control measures:

**Symptoms and Damage:**
*   **Red Spider Mite:** These tiny mites feed on the underside of leaves, causing yellowing, bronzing, and stippling. In severe infestations, leaves may turn reddish-brown, dry up, and fall off. Fine webbing can be observed on the leaves and stems.
*   **Rust Mite:** These microscopic mites are difficult to see with the naked eye. They feed on young leaves and growing points, causing distortion, curling, and thickening of leaves. Infested plants may appear stunted, and flower and pod formation can be severely affected.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy crop residues and weeds that can harbor mites.
    *   **Water Management:** Ensure proper irrigation, as water stress can make plants more susceptible to mite infestations. Overhead irrigation can sometimes help wash off mites.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Maintain balanced fertilization. Excessive nitrogen can sometimes promote mite build-up.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Naturally occurring predatory mites (e.g., Amblyseius spp.) and insects (e.g., ladybird beetles, lacewings) can help keep mite populations in check. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial organisms.

3.  **Chemical Control (Acaricides):**
    When mite populations reach economic threshold levels, chemical intervention becomes necessary. Always ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the underside of leaves where mites reside. Rotate different classes of acaricides to prevent the development of resistance.

    The following CIBRC-approved technical chemicals are recommended:

    *   **For Red Spider Mite and Rust Mite:**
        *   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP:** Apply at a rate of **2.0 - 2.5 kg/acre** (mixed in 200-400 L of water). Sulphur is particularly effective against rust mites and also provides good control of red spider mites.
        *   **Propargite 57% EC:** Apply at a rate of **1.0 - 1.25 L/acre** (mixed in 200-400 L of water).
        *   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** Apply at a rate of **120 - 160 ml/acre** (mixed in 200-400 L of water).
        *   **Fenpyroximate 5% SC:** Apply at a rate of **300 - 400 ml/acre** (mixed in 200-400 L of water).
        *   **Abamectin 1.9% EC:** Apply at a rate of **200 - 250 ml/acre** (mixed in 200-400 L of water).

    **Important Considerations for Chemical Application:**
    *   **Timing:** Apply acaricides at the first sign of infestation to prevent rapid population build-up.
    *   **Coverage:** Ensure complete and uniform coverage of the foliage, especially the undersides of leaves, as mites are often found there. Use a high-volume sprayer.
    *   **Water Volume:** Use an adequate volume of water (typically 200-400 L/acre depending on crop canopy) to ensure good coverage.
    *   **Rotation:** To prevent the development of resistance, rotate acaricides with different modes of action. Do not use the same chemical repeatedly.
    *   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, and protective clothing while handling and spraying chemicals. Follow the instructions and safety precautions mentioned on the product label.
    *   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Observe the specified pre-harvest interval for each chemical to ensure the safety of the produce.
