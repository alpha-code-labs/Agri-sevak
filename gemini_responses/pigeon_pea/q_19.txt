As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I advise on addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies in Pigeon pea (*Cajanus cajan*) based on scientific principles and practices suitable for Haryana.

**Crucial First Step: Soil Testing**
Before applying any fertilizers, it is paramount to conduct a comprehensive soil test. This will accurately diagnose the specific nutrient deficiencies in your field and allow for precise, cost-effective, and environmentally sound fertilizer recommendations. The following recommendations are general guidelines; actual doses should be adjusted based on soil test reports.

### Addressing Macro-nutrient Deficiencies in Pigeon Pea

#### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** General yellowing of older leaves, stunted growth, reduced branching, and overall pale green appearance of the plant.
*   **Management:** Pigeon pea is a legume and fixes atmospheric nitrogen, but a starter dose of nitrogen is beneficial for early establishment before nodulation is fully effective.
    *   **Basal Application (at sowing):**
        *   Apply 15-20 kg Nitrogen per acre.
        *   This can be achieved by applying 32-43 kg of **Urea** (46% N) per acre.
    *   **Foliar Application (if deficiency appears post-sowing):**
        *   For mild to moderate deficiency, spray a 2% solution of **Urea** (20 g of **Urea** per litre of water).
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 15-day intervals, preferably in the morning or late afternoon.

#### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, dark green to purplish discoloration of older leaves (especially on the underside), delayed maturity, poor root development, and reduced pod formation.
*   **Management:** Phosphorus is crucial for root development, flowering, and pod filling. It is less mobile in the soil, so basal application is most effective.
    *   **Basal Application (at sowing):**
        *   Apply 40-60 kg P2O5 per acre.
        *   This can be achieved by applying:
            *   87-130 kg of **Di-ammonium phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5) per acre, OR
            *   250-375 kg of **Single superphosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5) per acre.
    *   **Foliar Application (less effective for P, but can be tried for mild deficiency):**
        *   Spray a 1-2% solution of **Monoammonium phosphate (MAP)** (10-20 g of **Monoammonium phosphate (MAP)** per litre of water).
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 15-day intervals.

#### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Yellowing and browning/scorching of leaf margins (especially on older leaves), weak stems, lodging, poor disease resistance, and shrivelled seeds.
*   **Management:** Potassium is vital for water regulation, nutrient transport, and overall plant vigour.
    *   **Basal Application (at sowing):**
        *   Apply 20 kg K2O per acre.
        *   This can be achieved by applying 33 kg of **Muriate of potash (MOP)** (60% K2O) per acre.
    *   **Foliar Application (if deficiency appears post-sowing):**
        *   Spray a 1-2% solution of **Muriate of potash (MOP)** (10-20 g of **Muriate of potash (MOP)** per litre of water).
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 15-day intervals.

**Integrated Nutrient Management (INM):**
For sustainable and healthy Pigeon pea cultivation, always integrate chemical fertilizers with organic sources like Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost (5-10 tonnes per acre) and bio-fertilizers (Rhizobium and PSB inoculants). This approach improves soil health, nutrient availability, and reduces reliance on chemical inputs.

Always ensure proper irrigation and weed management, as these factors also significantly influence nutrient uptake and plant health.
