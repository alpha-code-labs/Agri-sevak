Dear Farmer,

The issue of flower and pod dropping (often referred to as boll dropping in some contexts, though 'boll' is more common for cotton) is a significant concern in Pigeon pea (Arhar/Tur) cultivation, leading to substantial yield losses. As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can confirm that this phenomenon is well-known and can be managed effectively with proper interventions.

**Causes of Flower and Pod Dropping in Pigeon pea:**

Dropping can be attributed to a combination of physiological, environmental, nutritional, and sometimes pest-related factors:

1.  **Physiological Factors:** Pigeon pea naturally sheds a high percentage (up to 60-80%) of its flowers and young pods as a self-regulatory mechanism to balance the plant's reproductive load with its resource availability.
2.  **Environmental Stress:**
    *   **High Temperatures:** Especially during flowering and pod development.
    *   **Water Stress:** Both drought (insufficient moisture) and waterlogging (excess moisture) can induce dropping.
    *   **Humidity:** Very low or very high humidity can affect pollen viability and fertilization.
    *   **Cloudy Weather/Low Light Intensity:** Reduces photosynthesis, leading to resource scarcity for developing pods.
3.  **Nutritional Deficiencies:** Lack of essential micronutrients like Boron and Zinc.
4.  **Pest and Disease Infestations:** Severe infestations of pod borers (e.g., *Helicoverpa armigera*), pod fly, or certain diseases can damage flowers and young pods, leading to their premature abscission.

**Control Measures for Dropping in Pigeon pea:**

To minimize flower and pod dropping and maximize your yield, consider the following integrated approach:

**I. Agronomic Management:**

*   **Select Suitable Varieties:** Choose high-yielding, stress-tolerant varieties recommended for Haryana conditions by HAU.
*   **Optimum Sowing Time:** Adhere to the recommended sowing window to ensure flowering and pod development occur under favorable climatic conditions, avoiding extreme temperatures.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Maintain optimal plant spacing to reduce inter-plant competition for light, water, and nutrients.
*   **Irrigation Management:**
    *   Provide light irrigation at critical stages, especially during flowering and pod development, if there is a dry spell. Avoid waterlogging.
    *   Ensure good drainage in your fields.
*   **Weed Control:** Keep fields free of weeds, which compete with pigeon pea plants for nutrients and water.

**II. Nutritional Management:**

*   **Balanced Fertilization:** Ensure adequate supply of macro and micronutrients based on soil test reports.
*   **Foliar Application of Micronutrients:**
    *   **Boron:** If Boron deficiency is suspected or confirmed, spray **Borax** (10.5% Boron) at 1-2 g/L of water or **Solubor** (20% Boron) at 0.5-1 g/L of water at the pre-flowering and early pod development stages.
    *   **Zinc:** If Zinc deficiency is suspected, spray **Zinc Sulphate** (21% or 33%) at 5 g/L of water at the pre-flowering stage.

**III. Hormonal Management (Plant Growth Regulators - PGRs):**

*   **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA):** This PGR is highly effective in reducing flower and pod drop by preventing abscission layer formation.
    *   **Application:** Spray **Naphthalene Acetic Acid** (NAA 4.5% SL formulation) at a concentration of 10-20 ppm (parts per million). This typically translates to 0.2-0.4 ml of the 4.5% SL formulation per liter of water.
    *   **Timing:** Apply the first spray at the initiation of flowering and a second spray about 15-20 days later, especially if dropping is severe. Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.

**IV. Pest and Disease Management:**

*   **Integrated Pest Management (IPM):** Implement IPM strategies to manage major pests like pod borers and pod fly. Severe infestations can cause direct damage to flowers and pods, leading to their shedding. Consult HAU recommendations for specific pest control measures if pest damage is a primary cause of dropping.

By adopting these scientifically verified practices, you can significantly reduce flower and pod dropping in your pigeon pea crop and achieve better yields. For specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions, please consult with the agricultural extension specialists at HAU, Hisar.
