As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling sucking pests in Pigeon pea (Arhar) in Haryana.

Regarding Psylla: This is not known to affect Pigeon pea.

For Aphids, Leafhoppers (Jassids), Whiteflies, and Thrips, an integrated pest management (IPM) approach is recommended, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies:**

*   **Monitoring:** Regularly scout fields, especially the undersides of leaves and tender shoots, to detect pest infestations early.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available and suitable for the region, choose varieties known to have some level of resistance or tolerance to sucking pests.
*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Maintain optimum plant spacing to ensure good air circulation.
    *   Manage weeds effectively, as they can act as alternate hosts for pests.
    *   Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush growth attractive to sucking pests.
*   **Biological Control:** Conserve natural enemies such as ladybird beetles, lacewings, hoverfly larvae, and parasitic wasps, which prey on or parasitize aphids and whiteflies. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.
*   **Yellow Sticky Traps:** Install yellow sticky traps (10-15 traps per acre) to monitor and mass-trap adult whiteflies and leafhoppers.

**Chemical Control (Apply only when pest populations exceed economic threshold levels):**

When chemical intervention is necessary, use CIBRC approved insecticides at recommended dosages. Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

Here are some CIBRC approved technical chemical names and their recommended dosages for sucking pests in Pigeon pea:

*   **For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips:**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** 125-150 ml per acre (diluted in 200-300 litres of water).
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** 50-100 g per acre (diluted in 200-300 litres of water).
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** 50-100 g per acre (diluted in 200-300 litres of water).
    *   **Flonicamid 50% WG:** 60 g per acre (diluted in 200-300 litres of water).
    *   **Dimethoate 30% EC:** 300-400 ml per acre (diluted in 200-300 litres of water).

*   **Specifically for Whiteflies (Nymphs and Adults) and Leafhoppers:**
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** 500-600 ml per acre (diluted in 200-300 litres of water). This is an Insect Growth Regulator (IGR) effective against nymphs.
    *   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** 160-200 ml per acre (diluted in 200-300 litres of water). Effective against whiteflies and mites.

*   **For Thrips, Aphids, and Leafhoppers:**
    *   **Fipronil 5% SC:** 400-600 ml per acre (diluted in 200-300 litres of water).
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** 100-125 ml per acre (diluted in 200-300 litres of water). (Note: This is a broad-spectrum insecticide and should be used judiciously to conserve natural enemies).

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the insecticide label carefully, including dosage, application method, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and safety precautions.
*   Ensure proper safety gear (gloves, mask, protective clothing) is used during handling and spraying of chemicals.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and current pest situation.
*   Regularly monitor the crop after application to assess the efficacy of the treatment and to detect any resurgence or secondary pest outbreaks.
