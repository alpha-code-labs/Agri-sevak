As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for managing growth issues in Pigeon pea (Arhar) in Haryana:

It is crucial to conduct a soil test before applying any fertilizers or amendments to accurately diagnose nutrient deficiencies and avoid imbalances.

### 1. Slow Growth

Slow growth in Pigeon pea can be attributed to various factors including nutrient deficiencies, water stress, soil compaction, or early pest/disease pressure.

*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Nitrogen (N):** Pigeon pea is a legume and fixes atmospheric nitrogen, but an initial starter dose is beneficial. If growth is slow and leaves are pale green, a top-dressing might be needed.
        *   Apply **Urea** at 20-30 kg/acre as a top-dressing if nitrogen deficiency is suspected and confirmed by soil test.
    *   **Phosphorus (P):** Essential for root development and overall growth.
        *   Ensure adequate basal application of **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (50 kg/acre) or **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (125 kg/acre) at sowing.
    *   **Potassium (K):** Important for water regulation and disease resistance.
        *   Apply **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** at 20 kg/acre at sowing if soil test indicates deficiency.
    *   **Micronutrients:** Deficiencies in Zinc (Zn), Iron (Fe), or Boron (B) can also stunt growth.
        *   For Zinc deficiency: Apply **Zinc sulfate** (21%) at 10 kg/acre as basal or foliar spray of **Zinc sulfate** (0.5%) at 5 g/L water.
        *   For Iron deficiency (interveinal chlorosis on young leaves): Foliar spray of **Ferrous sulfate** (0.5%) at 5 g/L water.
        *   For Boron deficiency: Foliar spray of **Borax** (0.2%) at 2 g/L water.
*   **Water Management:** Ensure adequate soil moisture, especially during critical growth stages. Avoid both waterlogging and severe drought stress.
*   **Soil Health:** Improve soil structure and organic matter content by incorporating farmyard manure (FYM) or compost.
*   **Weed Control:** Timely weed removal is essential to reduce competition for nutrients and water.

### 2. Yellow Growth (Chlorosis)

Yellowing of leaves (chlorosis) indicates a nutrient deficiency or water stress. The pattern of yellowing (old vs. young leaves, interveinal vs. general) helps in diagnosis.

*   **Nitrogen Deficiency:** General yellowing, starting from older leaves.
    *   Apply **Urea** at 20-30 kg/acre as a top-dressing.
*   **Iron Deficiency:** Interveinal yellowing on younger leaves, veins remain green. Common in high pH (alkaline) soils.
    *   Foliar spray of **Ferrous sulfate** (0.5%) at 5 g/L water, repeated at 7-10 day intervals if needed.
*   **Zinc Deficiency:** Stunted growth, small leaves, interveinal chlorosis, often purplish tinge.
    *   Foliar spray of **Zinc sulfate** (0.5%) at 5 g/L water.
*   **Sulfur Deficiency:** General yellowing of younger leaves.
    *   Apply **Gypsum** at 200 kg/acre as basal or foliar spray of **Elemental Sulfur** (0.2%) at 2 g/L water.
*   **Waterlogging:** Can cause root damage and nutrient uptake issues, leading to yellowing. Improve drainage if waterlogging is a problem.

### 3. Excessive Height

Excessive height can lead to lodging (falling over), especially during strong winds or heavy rains, resulting in significant yield loss.

*   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive application of nitrogen, which promotes vegetative growth and height.
*   **Planting Density:** Optimize plant spacing to ensure adequate light penetration and air circulation, which can help in sturdier growth.
*   **Variety Selection:** Choose semi-dwarf or lodging-resistant varieties suitable for your region.
*   **Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs):**
    *   To reduce internode length and promote sturdier stems, a foliar application of **Chlormequat chloride** can be considered.
    *   Apply **Chlormequat chloride** (50% SL) at 200-300 ml/acre in 200 litres of water at the pre-flowering stage (around 45-60 days after sowing). Always follow label instructions and local recommendations.

### 4. Excessive Flowering

While abundant flowering is generally desirable, if it leads to poor pod set, flower drop, or resource drain resulting in smaller pods/seeds, it can be an issue. This is often due to stress or nutrient imbalances.

*   **Nutrient Balance:** Ensure balanced nutrition, especially adequate Phosphorus, Potassium, Boron, and Molybdenum, which are crucial for flowering and pod development.
    *   For Boron deficiency (leading to poor pod set): Foliar spray of **Borax** (0.2%) at 2 g/L water.
    *   For Molybdenum deficiency (important for nitrogen fixation and pod filling): Foliar spray of **Ammonium Molybdate** (0.05%) at 0.5 g/L water.
*   **Water Management:** Maintain optimal soil moisture during flowering and pod development stages. Water stress (either deficit or excess) can lead to flower drop.
*   **Stress Management:** Protect plants from extreme temperatures, strong winds, and pest/disease attacks during the critical flowering period.
*   **No direct chemical intervention is typically recommended to *reduce* flowering in Pigeon pea, as the goal is usually to maximize pod set from the flowers produced.** If excessive flowering leads to flower drop, the focus should be on supporting the plant to retain more flowers and pods.
    *   In cases of severe flower drop due to stress, some farmers use **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA)** (4.5% SL) at 20-40 ppm (4-8 ml/10 litres of water) at the peak flowering stage to reduce flower shedding and improve pod retention. However, this is for *preventing drop*, not *reducing* initial flowering.

Always consult with local agricultural extension officers or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and the latest approved practices.
