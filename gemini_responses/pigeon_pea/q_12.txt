Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU), Hisar, I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing Scale insects and Mealybugs in Pigeon pea (Arhar/Tur) in Haryana. Both these pests are significant sap-suckers and can cause considerable damage if not managed effectively.

Here's a comprehensive approach:

### Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategy

A combination of cultural, biological, and chemical methods is most effective for sustainable control.

**1. Cultural Control:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Regularly remove weeds from and around the field, as they can harbor these pests.
*   **Pruning:** Inspect plants regularly. If localized infestations are observed, prune and destroy the infested plant parts (stems, branches, leaves) to prevent further spread.
*   **Avoid Excessive Nitrogen:** High nitrogen fertilization can lead to lush, succulent growth that is more attractive to sucking pests. Maintain balanced nutrient application.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to improve air circulation and reduce humidity, which can discourage pest proliferation.

**2. Biological Control:**
*   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Many natural enemies, such as ladybird beetles (coccinellids), lacewings, and parasitic wasps (e.g., *Anagyrus* spp. for mealybugs, various encyrtids for scales), prey on or parasitize scale insects and mealybugs. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.
*   **Biopesticides:** Consider using entomopathogenic fungi like *Beauveria bassiana* or *Verticillium lecanii* (now *Lecanicillium lecanii*) during early stages of infestation or as part of a rotational spray, especially under humid conditions. Follow manufacturer's recommendations for dosage.

**3. Chemical Control:**
When infestations are severe and cultural/biological methods are insufficient, chemical intervention may be necessary. Systemic insecticides are often effective against these pests as they penetrate the plant tissues and are ingested by the sap-sucking insects, even those protected by waxy coverings.

**For both Scale Insects and Mealybugs, consider the following CIBRC-approved insecticides:**

*   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at a rate of **125-250 ml/acre** (or 0.25-0.5 ml/L of water). This is a systemic neonicotinoid effective against a wide range of sucking pests.
*   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at a rate of **50-100 g/acre** (or 0.2-0.4 g/L of water). Another systemic neonicotinoid with good efficacy against sucking pests.
*   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at a rate of **500-800 ml/acre** (or 1.0-1.6 ml/L of water). This is an insect growth regulator, particularly effective against nymphs of scales and mealybugs by inhibiting chitin synthesis.
*   **Dimethoate 30% EC:** Apply at a rate of **330-660 ml/acre** (or 0.6-1.2 ml/L of water). A systemic and contact organophosphate insecticide.
*   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:** Apply at a rate of **200-250 ml/acre** (or 0.4-0.5 ml/L of water). This is a novel systemic insecticide with excellent efficacy against scales and mealybugs, offering long-lasting control.

**Important Considerations for Chemical Application:**
*   **Thorough Coverage:** Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially targeting the undersides of leaves, stems, and areas where pests congregate, as mealybugs and scales often hide in crevices. For scales, systemic action is key.
*   **Timing:** Apply insecticides when pests are in their early nymphal stages, as they are more vulnerable.
*   **Water Volume:** Use sufficient water volume (e.g., 200-400 L/acre depending on crop stage and sprayer type) to ensure good coverage.
*   **Safety Precautions:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) like gloves, masks, and protective clothing while handling and applying pesticides. Follow all instructions on the product label.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance in pest populations. Do not rely solely on one chemical group.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Observe the specified pre-harvest interval for each insecticide to ensure the safety of the harvested produce.

By implementing these strategies, you can effectively manage scale insects and mealybugs in your Pigeon pea crop and minimize yield losses. For any further specific queries, please feel free to consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts.
