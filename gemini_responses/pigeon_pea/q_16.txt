As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following fertilizer doses for Pigeon pea (Arhar/Tur) in Haryana. These recommendations are based on scientific research and aim to optimize yield while maintaining soil health. It is always advisable to conduct a soil test to determine the precise nutrient status of your field and adjust these recommendations accordingly.

**General Nutrient Recommendations for Pigeon pea (per acre):**
*   Nitrogen (N): 20 kg
*   Phosphorus (P2O5): 40-60 kg
*   Potassium (K2O): 20 kg (apply only if soil test indicates deficiency)
*   Sulphur (S): 20 kg (apply only if soil test indicates deficiency)

**Fertilizer Doses (per acre):**

**1. Basal Application (at the time of sowing):**

*   **Option A (DAP-based):**
    *   **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)**: 87-130 kg
        *   *This provides 15.6-23.4 kg Nitrogen and 40-60 kg Phosphorus (P2O5).*
    *   **Urea**: If 87 kg **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)** is used, apply an additional 10 kg **Urea** to meet the full Nitrogen requirement. If 130 kg **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)** is used, no additional basal **Urea** is typically needed.
    *   **Muriate of Potash (MOP)**: 33-34 kg (if soil test indicates Potassium deficiency)
    *   **Bentonite Sulphur (90% S)**: 22-23 kg (if soil test indicates Sulphur deficiency and not using Single Super Phosphate)

*   **Option B (SSP-based):**
    *   **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)**: 250-375 kg
        *   *This provides 40-60 kg Phosphorus (P2O5) and 27.5-41.25 kg Sulphur, covering the Sulphur requirement.*
    *   **Urea**: 44 kg
        *   *This provides 20 kg Nitrogen.*
    *   **Muriate of Potash (MOP)**: 33-34 kg (if soil test indicates Potassium deficiency)

*   **Option C (Complex NPK-based):**
    *   **NPK (12:32:16)**: 125 kg
        *   *This provides 15 kg Nitrogen, 40 kg Phosphorus (P2O5), and 20 kg Potassium (K2O).*
    *   **Urea**: 11 kg (to supplement Nitrogen to 20 kg/acre)
    *   **Bentonite Sulphur (90% S)**: 22-23 kg (if soil test indicates Sulphur deficiency)

**2. Foliar Application (as supplementary nutrition):**

*   **Nano-Urea (Liquid)**: 2-4 ml per litre of water.
    *   *Apply two sprays: first at the branching stage and second at the pre-flowering stage.*
*   **Nano-DAP (Liquid)**: 2-4 ml per litre of water.
    *   *Apply two sprays: first at the branching stage and second at the pre-flowering stage.*

**Important Note:**
*   The above recommendations are general guidelines. For precise fertilizer application, a recent soil test report is crucial.
*   Ensure proper placement of basal fertilizers, preferably drilled 5-7 cm deep at the time of sowing.
*   Legumes like Pigeon pea benefit from Rhizobium inoculation, which enhances nitrogen fixation and reduces the need for higher nitrogen fertilizer doses.
