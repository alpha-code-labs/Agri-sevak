As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling soil pests like Termites and Root-knot Nematodes in Pigeon pea (Arhar/Tur) in Haryana.

It is crucial to adopt an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods for sustainable and effective control.

### Control of Termites (Deemak) in Pigeon pea

Termites are a significant soil pest that can cause considerable damage by feeding on roots, stem bases, and sometimes pods, leading to wilting and plant death.

**1. Cultural Control Measures:**
*   **Deep Ploughing:** Ploughing fields deeply during summer exposes termite colonies to heat and predators, reducing their population.
*   **Removal of Stubble and Debris:** Clear crop residues, weeds, and other organic debris from the field, as these can serve as food sources and breeding sites for termites.
*   **Proper Irrigation:** Maintain adequate soil moisture, as termites prefer dry conditions. However, avoid waterlogging.
*   **Farmyard Manure (FYM):** Ensure well-decomposed FYM is used, as undecomposed organic matter can attract termites.

**2. Chemical Control Measures (CIBRC Approved):**
For severe infestations, chemical control can be employed.

*   **Pre-sowing Soil Treatment:**
    *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC:** Apply as a pre-sowing soil incorporation.
        *   *Dosage:* 2.0 - 2.5 L per acre mixed in 200-400 L of water and sprayed evenly on the soil surface, then incorporated into the soil before sowing.
*   **Seed Treatment (for early protection):**
    *   **Imidacloprid 600 FS:** Treat seeds before sowing.
        *   *Dosage:* 5-7 ml per kg of seed. This provides early protection against termites and sucking pests.
*   **Post-emergence Soil Application/Drenching:**
    *   **Fipronil 0.3% GR:** Apply granules in the soil at the time of sowing or during early crop growth.
        *   *Dosage:* 6-8 kg per acre.
    *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC:** For drenching around the base of affected plants.
        *   *Dosage:* 2.5 - 4.0 L per acre mixed in 400-500 L of water. Drench the soil around the plant base, especially where termite activity is observed.

### Control of Nematodes (Root-knot Nematodes - *Meloidogyne* spp.) in Pigeon pea

Root-knot nematodes are microscopic roundworms that infect plant roots, causing characteristic galls or knots. These galls impair the plant's ability to absorb water and nutrients, leading to stunted growth, yellowing, wilting, and significant yield reduction. Pigeon pea is susceptible to root-knot nematodes.

**1. Cultural Control Measures:**
*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate pigeon pea with non-host crops like cereals (e.g., wheat, maize, sorghum) for at least 2-3 years. This helps reduce nematode populations in the soil.
*   **Summer Ploughing:** Deep ploughing during hot summer months exposes nematode eggs and larvae to direct sunlight, desiccating and killing them.
*   **Use of Resistant Varieties:** If available and recommended by HAU, cultivate nematode-resistant pigeon pea varieties.
*   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or neem cake into the soil. Neem cake has nematicidal properties and enhances soil health.
    *   *Dosage for Neem Cake:* 100-200 kg per acre, applied at the time of field preparation.
*   **Solarization:** Covering moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets during peak summer can raise soil temperatures sufficiently to kill nematodes.

**2. Chemical Control Measures (CIBRC Approved):**
For fields with a history of severe nematode infestation, chemical nematicides can be used as a preventive measure at sowing.

*   **Carbofuran 3% G:** Apply granules in the soil at the time of sowing.
    *   *Dosage:* 10-13 kg per acre, applied in furrows at sowing and mixed with soil.
*   **Phorate 10% G:** Apply granules in the soil at the time of sowing.
    *   *Dosage:* 4 kg per acre, applied in furrows at sowing and mixed with soil.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully, including dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Consult your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and current pest pressure.
*   Prioritize cultural and biological methods as part of an IPM strategy to minimize reliance on chemical pesticides.
