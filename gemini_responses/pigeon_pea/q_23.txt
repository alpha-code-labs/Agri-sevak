Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon, as a Senior Agronomist from Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I am here to provide you with scientifically verified recommendations for seed and soil treatment processes for Pigeon pea (Arhar/Tur) cultivation in Haryana. These practices are crucial for ensuring healthy crop establishment and managing early-season pests and diseases.

### Recommended Seed Treatment Process for Pigeon pea

Seed treatment is the first line of defense against many seed-borne and soil-borne diseases, and early-season insect pests. It also enhances nutrient availability.

1.  **Fungicidal Treatment (for Seed-borne and Soil-borne Diseases like Wilt, Damping-off):**
    *   Treat seeds with a broad-spectrum fungicide to protect against fungal pathogens.
    *   **Recommendation:**
        *   **Carbendazim** 12% + **Mancozeb** 63% WP @ 2.5 grams per kg of seed.
        *   *Alternatively,* **Thiram** 75% WS @ 2.5-3 grams per kg of seed.
        *   *For specific management of wilt,* **Carbendazim** 50% WP @ 2 grams per kg of seed.
    *   **Method:** Mix the fungicide thoroughly with the seeds using a seed treatment drum or by spreading them on a clean surface and mixing with hands (wearing gloves).

2.  **Insecticidal Treatment (for Early Season Sucking Pests and Termites):**
    *   This protects seedlings from early insect attacks, which can severely impact stand establishment.
    *   **Recommendation:**
        *   **Imidacloprid** 70% WS @ 5 grams per kg of seed.
        *   *Alternatively,* **Thiamethoxam** 30% FS @ 10 ml per kg of seed.
    *   **Method:** Apply the insecticide after the fungicidal treatment. Ensure uniform coating.

3.  **Bio-fertilizer Treatment (for Nutrient Mobilization and Nitrogen Fixation):**
    *   Bio-fertilizers are essential for enhancing nutrient uptake and promoting plant growth.
    *   **Recommendation:**
        *   **Rhizobium** culture (Pigeon pea specific strain) @ 10-20 grams per kg of seed.
        *   **PSB (Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria)** culture @ 10-20 grams per kg of seed.
        *   *Optionally,* **Trichoderma viride** (a bio-fungicide) @ 4 grams per kg of seed, which also helps in managing soil-borne diseases.
    *   **Method:** This is the last step. After the chemical treatments, allow the seeds to dry slightly in the shade. Then, mix the bio-fertilizers with the seeds. Use a jaggery solution (gur) or rice starch as a sticker to ensure better adhesion of the bio-fertilizers to the seeds.
    *   **Important Note:** Always apply bio-fertilizers *after* chemical treatments and ensure the chemically treated seeds are dry to prevent harm to the beneficial microbes. Sow the treated seeds within 24 hours for best results.

### Recommended Soil Treatment Process for Pigeon pea

Soil treatment focuses on managing soil-borne diseases and pests, and improving soil fertility.

1.  **Bio-control Agent Application (for Soil-borne Diseases like Wilt and Root Rot):**
    *   Incorporating beneficial microbes into the soil can suppress pathogenic fungi.
    *   **Recommendation:**
        *   **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum** @ 2.5 kg per acre.
    *   **Method:** Mix the recommended quantity of **Trichoderma** formulation with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost. Keep the mixture moist and covered for 7-10 days in a cool, shaded place to allow the fungus to multiply. Broadcast this enriched FYM uniformly in the field during the last ploughing or at the time of sowing.

2.  **Bio-fertilizer Application (for Enhanced Nutrient Availability):**
    *   If not adequately covered by seed treatment, or as a supplementary measure, soil application of bio-fertilizers is beneficial.
    *   **Recommendation:**
        *   **Rhizobium** culture (Pigeon pea specific strain) @ 2-4 kg per acre.
        *   **PSB (Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria)** culture @ 2-4 kg per acre.
    *   **Method:** Mix the bio-fertilizers with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed FYM or compost and apply uniformly in the field before sowing or at the time of sowing.

3.  **Insecticidal Application (for Termite Management):**
    *   Termites can cause significant damage to pigeon pea, especially in sandy soils common in parts of Haryana.
    *   **Recommendation:**
        *   **Fipronil** 0.3% GR @ 6-8 kg per acre.
    *   **Method:** Broadcast the granules uniformly over the field and incorporate them into the soil during the last ploughing, just before sowing. This provides protection to the germinating seeds and young seedlings from termite attack.
