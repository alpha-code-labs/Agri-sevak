As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned conditions in Pigeon pea (Arhar/Toor) in Haryana:

### Control of Scab, Canker, Gummosis, and Lichen in Pigeon pea

**1. Scab:**
This is not known to affect Pigeon pea as a distinct, economically significant disease. Scab is typically associated with other crops and pathogens.

**2. Canker:**
In Pigeon pea, stem cankers are primarily associated with diseases like Phytophthora Blight (caused by *Phytophthora cajani*). This disease can cause dark brown lesions or cankers on the stem, leading to wilting and plant death, especially under waterlogged conditions.

**Control Measures for Canker (Phytophthora Blight):**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Resistant Varieties:** Plant resistant or tolerant varieties recommended for Haryana. Consult HAU for the latest recommendations on Phytophthora Blight resistant varieties suitable for your region.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris from the field to reduce inoculum.
    *   **Drainage:** Ensure proper field drainage to avoid waterlogging, as the pathogen thrives in wet conditions.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops.
    *   **Timely Sowing:** Sow at the recommended time to avoid peak disease periods.
    *   **Proper Spacing:** Maintain optimal plant spacing to ensure good air circulation.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Seed Treatment:**
        *   Treat seeds with **Metalaxyl** 35 WS @ 6 g/kg seed to protect seedlings from early infection.
    *   **Foliar Spray/Soil Drench (if disease appears):**
        *   For standing crops, if symptoms appear, apply a foliar spray or soil drench with systemic fungicides.
        *   **Metalaxyl-M 3.3% + Mancozeb 64% WP** @ 2.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Fosetyl-aluminium 80 WP** @ 2.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride 72.2 SL** @ 2.5 ml/L of water.
        *   Ensure thorough coverage of the plant, especially the stem base, if drenching. Repeat application after 10-15 days if necessary, following label instructions.

**3. Gummosis:**
This is not known to affect Pigeon pea as a primary disease or condition. Gummosis is typically a symptom seen in woody perennial plants (like fruit trees) where gum exudes from the bark, often due to stress, injury, or specific pathogens. While Pigeon pea plants might exude sap under severe stress or insect damage, it is not referred to as "Gummosis" in the context of a specific disease for this crop.

**4. Lichen:**
This is not known to affect Pigeon pea as a disease or pest. Lichens are symbiotic organisms (fungus and alga) that grow on surfaces like tree bark, rocks, or soil. They are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surface of plants without parasitizing them. They do not draw nutrients from the plant and are generally harmless to the Pigeon pea crop. Their presence usually indicates good air quality.
