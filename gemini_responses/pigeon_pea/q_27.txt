As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the suitable climate, soil type, and drainage requirements for Pigeon pea (Arhar/Tur) cultivation in Haryana:

### Climate Requirements:

Pigeon pea is a hardy, warm-season legume well-adapted to semi-arid tropical and subtropical regions.

*   **Temperature:**
    *   **Optimal:** 20-30°C during the growing season.
    *   **Minimum:** Growth is severely affected below 10°C.
    *   **Maximum:** Can tolerate temperatures up to 40°C, but prolonged high temperatures (above 35°C) during flowering can lead to flower drop.
    *   **Frost:** Highly susceptible to frost, which can cause significant damage or complete crop loss. Therefore, planting should be timed to avoid frost periods, especially during flowering and pod development.
*   **Rainfall:**
    *   **Annual Requirement:** 600-1000 mm, well-distributed during the growing season.
    *   **Tolerance:** It is drought-tolerant once established, making it suitable for rainfed conditions in Haryana. However, critical stages like flowering and pod filling benefit significantly from adequate moisture.
    *   **Excess Rainfall:** Prolonged heavy rainfall, especially during flowering, can lead to flower drop and reduced pod setting.
*   **Photoperiod:** Most traditional varieties are short-day sensitive, meaning they flower when day length shortens. However, modern improved varieties, including some suitable for Haryana, are often photo-insensitive or less sensitive, allowing for wider planting windows.

### Soil Type Requirements:

Pigeon pea can grow on a wide range of soils but performs best on certain types.

*   **Texture:**
    *   **Preferred:** Well-drained sandy loams, loamy soils, and medium black soils.
    *   **Tolerance:** Can tolerate light sandy soils and heavy clay soils to some extent, provided drainage is adequate.
*   **pH:**
    *   **Optimal:** Slightly acidic to neutral, with an ideal range of 6.0 to 7.5.
    *   **Tolerance:** Can tolerate a pH range of 5.0 to 8.0, but yields may be reduced at the extremes.
*   **Fertility:**
    *   **Requirement:** Moderate fertility. Being a legume, it fixes atmospheric nitrogen, reducing the need for external nitrogen fertilizers. However, it responds well to phosphorus and potassium application.
    *   **Salinity/Alkalinity:** Moderately tolerant to salinity and alkalinity compared to many other crops, but severe conditions will reduce yield.

### Drainage Requirements:

Good drainage is crucial for successful Pigeon pea cultivation.

*   **Waterlogging:** Pigeon pea is highly sensitive to waterlogging. Standing water, even for short periods (24-48 hours), can severely damage the root system, leading to yellowing, wilting, and even plant death due to oxygen deprivation and increased susceptibility to root rot diseases.
*   **Soil Structure:** Soils with good structure that allow for rapid infiltration and percolation of water are ideal.
*   **Field Preparation:** Proper land leveling and provision for surface drainage are essential, especially in areas prone to heavy rainfall or where irrigation is applied. Raised beds can be beneficial in areas with poor drainage.
