As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified recommendations for the use of Growth Regulators/Hormones in Pigeon pea (Arhar) in Haryana:

Here are the recommendations for the specified growth regulators and micronutrients:

*   **Ethephon** (commonly known by the trade name Ethrel)
    *   **Purpose:** To reduce flower drop and improve pod setting, thereby enhancing the overall yield of Pigeon pea.
    *   **Recommended Dose:** Apply a foliar spray of **Ethephon** (40% SL formulation) at a concentration of 100-200 ppm. This translates to **0.25-0.5 ml/L** of water.
    *   **Timing:** The spray should be applied at the peak flowering stage of the crop.
    *   **Application Rate:** For an acre, typically 200-250 litres of water are used for spraying. Therefore, approximately **50-125 ml** of **Ethephon** (40% SL) per acre.

*   **2,4-D**
    *   **Recommendation:** **2,4-D** is primarily a selective herbicide widely used for broadleaf weed control in various cereal crops. While it is an auxin (a type of plant hormone), its use as a growth regulator for yield enhancement or specific physiological effects in Pigeon pea is not a standard, recommended practice by Haryana Agricultural University (HAU). Applying it at doses that might act as a growth regulator carries a significant risk of phytotoxicity and herbicidal effects on the crop, which can severely damage or kill the Pigeon pea plants.
    *   **Conclusion:** Therefore, the application of **2,4-D** as a growth regulator in Pigeon pea is not recommended.

*   **Boron**
    *   **Purpose:** Boron is an essential micronutrient critical for pollen germination, fertilization, and overall pod development in Pigeon pea. Its deficiency can lead to poor flower retention, reduced pod setting, and ultimately lower yields.
    *   **Recommended Dose:** Apply Boron as a foliar spray. You can use either **Disodium tetraborate decahydrate** (commonly known as Borax) or **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (commonly known as Solubor).
        *   If using **Disodium tetraborate decahydrate** (containing approximately 11% Boron): Spray a 0.1-0.2% solution, which means **1-2 g/L** of water.
        *   If using **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (containing approximately 20% Boron): Spray a 0.05-0.1% solution, which means **0.5-1 g/L** of water.
    *   **Timing:** The first spray should be applied at the pre-flowering or early flowering stage. If Boron deficiency symptoms persist or if soil tests indicate low Boron levels, a second spray can be applied 15-20 days after the first.
    *   **Application Rate:** For an acre, typically 200-250 litres of water are used for spraying. Therefore, approximately **200-500 g** of **Disodium tetraborate decahydrate** or **100-250 g** of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** per acre.
