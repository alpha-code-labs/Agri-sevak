As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified information regarding specialized practices in Pigeon pea (Arhar/Toor) cultivation relevant to Haryana:

### Specialized Practices in Pigeon pea

**1. Pruning:**
*   **Terminal Pinching/Topping:** While not traditional "pruning" in the sense of woody perennials, terminal pinching or topping is sometimes practiced in indeterminate pigeon pea varieties, especially when grown at wider spacing.
*   **Purpose:** This involves removing the apical bud (growing tip) at an early stage (e.g., 30-45 days after sowing). This encourages lateral branching, leading to a bushier plant architecture with more flowering sites and potentially higher podding and yield.
*   **Consideration:** The effectiveness can vary with variety, planting density, and environmental conditions. It is not a universally adopted practice for all pigeon pea cultivation in Haryana but can be considered for specific management strategies.

**2. Desuckering:**
*   This is not known to affect Pigeon pea. Pigeon pea does not produce suckers from its base in a manner that requires desuckering as a cultural practice for yield or plant health.

**3. Mulching:**
*   **Benefits:** Mulching is a highly beneficial practice for pigeon pea, particularly in rainfed areas of Haryana, where moisture conservation is crucial.
    *   **Moisture Conservation:** Reduces evaporation from the soil surface, conserving valuable soil moisture.
    *   **Weed Suppression:** Acts as a physical barrier, suppressing weed growth and reducing competition for nutrients and water.
    *   **Soil Temperature Regulation:** Helps moderate soil temperature, protecting roots from extreme heat or cold.
    *   **Soil Health Improvement:** Organic mulches decompose over time, adding organic matter and improving soil structure and fertility.
*   **Materials:** Crop residues such as wheat straw, paddy straw, or even dried pigeon pea stalks from the previous season can be used as mulch.
*   **Application:** Mulch should be applied after sowing or after initial weeding, ensuring it does not interfere with seedling emergence.

**4. Grafting:**
*   This is not known to affect Pigeon pea. Grafting is not a standard or practical horticultural practice for commercial pigeon pea cultivation. Pigeon pea is a herbaceous legume, and grafting is typically employed for woody plants or specific vegetable crops to combine desirable rootstock and scion characteristics (e.g., disease resistance, vigor).

**5. Pollination:**
*   **Primary Mechanism:** Pigeon pea is predominantly a self-pollinated (autogamous) crop. The flowers are structured to facilitate self-pollination before or at the time of anthesis (flower opening).
*   **Cross-Pollination:** However, a significant percentage of cross-pollination can occur, ranging from 5% to 30% or even higher, depending on the variety and the presence of insect pollinators.
*   **Pollinators:** Bees are the primary insect vectors for cross-pollination in pigeon pea. Species like *Apis dorsata* (giant honey bee), *Apis florea* (dwarf honey bee), and *Apis mellifera* (European honey bee) are commonly observed visiting pigeon pea flowers.
*   **Implication:** While self-pollination ensures pod set, insect-mediated cross-pollination contributes to genetic diversity within populations and can sometimes enhance podding. No specific human intervention for pollination is required in commercial pigeon pea cultivation.
