Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with the ideal guidelines for transplanting Pigeon pea (Arhar/Tur) in Haryana. While pigeon pea is traditionally a direct-sown crop, transplanting can be a viable option, especially for early establishment, gap filling, or when direct sowing is delayed.

Here are the recommendations:

### Ideal Transplantation Time

*   **Nursery Sowing:** Sow seeds in the nursery during the last week of June to the first week of July.
*   **Transplanting to Main Field:** Seedlings are typically ready for transplanting when they are 3-4 weeks old. Therefore, the ideal time for transplanting to the main field is from the **last week of July to the second week of August**. This timing allows the crop to establish well with the ongoing monsoon rains.

### Ideal Transplantation Distance

The spacing depends on the duration of the variety and the fertility of your soil.

*   **For Early Duration Varieties (e.g., UPAS 120, Pusa 991, Pusa 992):**
    *   **Row-to-Row:** 45-60 cm
    *   **Plant-to-Plant:** 10-15 cm
*   **For Medium to Late Duration Varieties (e.g., Bahar, Pusa Arhar 16):**
    *   **Row-to-Row:** 75-90 cm
    *   **Plant-to-Plant:** 15-20 cm

Aim for a plant population of approximately 55,000 to 75,000 plants per acre for optimal yield.

### Ideal Transplantation Process

1.  **Nursery Bed Preparation:**
    *   Prepare raised nursery beds (1 meter wide, convenient length, 15-20 cm high) in a well-drained area.
    *   Mix well-decomposed Farmyard Manure (FYM) or compost (2-3 kg per square meter) thoroughly with the soil.
    *   Ensure the soil is fine and free of clods.
2.  **Seed Sowing in Nursery:**
    *   Sow pigeon pea seeds 1-2 cm deep in rows, with rows spaced 10-15 cm apart. Maintain a seed-to-seed distance of 5-7 cm within the row.
    *   Cover the seeds with a thin layer of soil and provide light irrigation immediately.
    *   Protect the nursery from heavy rainfall or intense direct sunlight if necessary during the initial germination phase.
3.  **Seedling Age and Hardening:**
    *   Seedlings will be ready for transplanting when they are 3-4 weeks old, have developed 3-4 true leaves, and are about 15-20 cm tall.
    *   To prepare seedlings for the shock of transplanting, reduce irrigation in the nursery 5-7 days before transplanting. This process, known as 'hardening,' makes the seedlings more robust.
4.  **Main Field Preparation:**
    *   Prepare the main field thoroughly by ploughing 2-3 times, followed by planking to achieve a fine tilth.
    *   Incorporate 4-6 tonnes of well-decomposed FYM or compost per acre during field preparation.
    *   Create furrows and ridges or mark out the desired spacing on flat beds according to the recommended distances.
5.  **Transplanting Operation:**
    *   Transplant seedlings preferably in the late afternoon or on a cloudy day to minimize transplanting shock.
    *   Carefully uproot the seedlings from the nursery, ensuring minimal damage to the root system.
    *   Plant one seedling per hill at the recommended spacing (row-to-row and plant-to-plant).
    *   Ensure the root collar (the junction of the stem and root) is at the soil surface level.
    *   Gently press the soil around the base of each transplanted seedling to ensure good root-to-soil contact.
6.  **Post-Transplanting Care:**
    *   Provide light irrigation immediately after transplanting to help the seedlings establish quickly.
    *   Monitor the field for any gaps and undertake gap filling within 7-10 days if necessary.
    *   Manage weeds effectively during the initial establishment phase.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure a healthy start and good establishment for your pigeon pea crop through transplantation.
