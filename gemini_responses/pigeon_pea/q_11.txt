As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies in Pigeon pea (Arhar/Tur) in Haryana.

### Control of Beetles and Weevils in Pigeon pea

Beetles and Weevils can cause significant damage to Pigeon pea, primarily by feeding on flowers, developing pods, and seeds. The most common problematic species include Blister beetles (flower feeders) and the Pigeon pea pod weevil (Apion clavipes).

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Approach:**

1.  **Monitoring:** Regularly scout fields, especially during flowering and pod development stages, to detect pest presence and assess infestation levels.
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Timely sowing of recommended varieties.
    *   Field sanitation to remove crop residues that might harbor pests.
3.  **Mechanical Control:** For small infestations of Blister beetles, hand-picking and destroying them can be effective, especially in the early morning or late evening when they are less active.
4.  **Chemical Control:** If pest populations exceed economic threshold levels, chemical intervention may be necessary. Apply insecticides during the flowering and early pod formation stages, ensuring thorough coverage.

**Recommended CIBRC Approved Insecticides for Beetles and Weevils:**

*   **For Blister Beetles (flower feeders) and Pigeon pea Pod Weevil:**
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC**: Apply at 150-200 ml per acre (or 0.75-1.0 ml/L of water).
    *   **Indoxacarb 14.5% SC**: Apply at 200 ml per acre (or 1.0 ml/L of water).
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC**: Apply at 60 ml per acre (or 0.3 ml/L of water).
    *   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG**: Apply at 80-100 g per acre (or 0.4-0.5 g/L of water).
    *   **Quinalphos 25% EC**: Apply at 600 ml per acre (or 3.0 ml/L of water).

**Important Considerations for Chemical Application:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the insecticide label carefully.
*   Use appropriate safety gear (gloves, mask, protective clothing) during mixing and spraying.
*   Ensure proper calibration of spray equipment for uniform coverage.
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
*   Observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) specified on the label before harvesting.

### Control of Sawflies in Pigeon pea

This is not known to affect Pigeon pea. Sawflies are generally not considered significant pests of Pigeon pea in Haryana or other major growing regions. Therefore, specific control measures for sawflies in Pigeon pea are not typically required.
