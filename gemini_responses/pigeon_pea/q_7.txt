As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), here is the scientifically verified advice for controlling Dieback, Twig blight, and Tikka disease in Pigeon pea in Haryana:

### Control of Dieback in Pigeon pea

Dieback in Pigeon pea can be caused by various factors, including fungal pathogens like *Phytophthora* species or *Fusarium* species, and environmental stresses. Effective management involves integrated approaches.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Select and plant resistant or tolerant varieties suitable for the Haryana region.
    *   Ensure proper field drainage to prevent waterlogging, which can predispose plants to root and stem diseases.
    *   Maintain balanced soil fertility to promote vigorous plant growth and enhance natural resistance.
    *   Remove and destroy infected plant debris and pruned twigs to reduce inoculum sources.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   For dieback suspected to be caused by *Phytophthora* species (often associated with wet conditions), apply a systemic fungicide:
        *   **Metalaxyl 8% + Mancozeb 64% WP** at 2.5 kg per acre, mixed in 500-600 litres of water, as a foliar spray.
    *   For dieback caused by *Fusarium* or other general fungal pathogens, apply a systemic fungicide:
        *   **Carbendazim 50% WP** at 500 g per acre, mixed in 500-600 litres of water, as a foliar spray.
        *   Alternatively, **Thiophanate-methyl 70% WP** at 500 g per acre can be used.
    *   Initiate spraying at the first sign of symptoms and repeat after 10-15 days if disease pressure persists.

### Control of Twig Blight in Pigeon pea

Twig blight in Pigeon pea is primarily caused by *Phytophthora cajani*.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Utilize resistant or tolerant Pigeon pea varieties recommended for Haryana.
    *   Practice good field sanitation by regularly removing and destroying infected twigs and plant debris to minimize disease spread.
    *   Ensure adequate plant spacing to improve air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce humidity and fungal growth.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Apply a combination of systemic and contact fungicides, which is highly effective against *Phytophthora* species:
        *   **Metalaxyl 8% + Mancozeb 64% WP** at 2.5 kg per acre, mixed in 500-600 litres of water, as a foliar spray.
    *   Begin spraying when the first symptoms appear, typically during the monsoon season or periods of high humidity, and repeat after 10-15 days if necessary, depending on disease severity and weather conditions.

### Control of Tikka disease in Pigeon pea

This is not known to affect Pigeon pea. Tikka disease (Early Leaf Spot and Late Leaf Spot) is a prominent disease primarily affecting Groundnut (Peanut), caused by *Cercospora arachidicola* and *Phaeoisariopsis personata*, respectively.
