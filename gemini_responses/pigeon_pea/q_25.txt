Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I advise you on the optimal irrigation management for Pigeon pea (Arhar/Tur) in Haryana. While Pigeon pea is known for its drought tolerance, strategic irrigation at critical growth stages can significantly enhance yield, especially during dry spells or erratic monsoon patterns. Over-irrigation, however, must be strictly avoided as it can lead to waterlogging and adverse effects on the crop.

Here is the detailed information:

### General Principles of Irrigation for Pigeon pea

Pigeon pea is primarily a rainfed crop in many parts of Haryana. However, supplemental irrigation is crucial for stabilizing and increasing yields, particularly when monsoon rains are insufficient or unevenly distributed. The key is to provide light irrigations only when necessary, based on soil moisture status and crop demand.

### First Irrigation

The timing of the first irrigation is critical and depends heavily on the rainfall received and the prevailing soil moisture conditions after sowing.

*   **Timing:**
    *   If there is a prolonged dry spell (20-25 days) after sowing, or if the monsoon is delayed/deficient, a light irrigation should be considered.
    *   The most critical stage for the first supplemental irrigation is during the **branching and early flowering stage**, which typically occurs around **45-60 days after sowing (DAS)**. Water stress during this period can severely impact flower initiation and podding.
*   **Quantity:** Apply a light irrigation (approximately 40-50 mm depth) to moisten the root zone without causing waterlogging.

### Second Irrigation

The need for a second irrigation arises if dry conditions persist after the first irrigation, especially during the crucial pod development phase.

*   **Timing:**
    *   If the crop experiences water stress after the first irrigation, particularly during the **pod development and grain filling stage**, a second light irrigation is highly beneficial.
    *   This stage usually falls between **90-120 DAS**, or approximately **30-45 days after the first irrigation**, depending on the variety and weather conditions. Water stress during pod filling directly reduces grain size and yield.
*   **Quantity:** Similar to the first irrigation, apply a light irrigation (approximately 40-50 mm depth).

### Sprinkler Use in Pigeon pea

Sprinkler irrigation is an excellent method for applying water efficiently to Pigeon pea, especially in regions with limited water availability or undulating terrain.

*   **Advantages of Sprinkler Irrigation:**
    *   **High Water Use Efficiency:** Sprinklers deliver water uniformly and precisely, significantly reducing water losses due to runoff, deep percolation, and evaporation compared to flood irrigation. This is crucial for water-scarce Haryana.
    *   **Uniform Water Distribution:** Ensures that all plants receive an adequate and consistent amount of water, promoting uniform growth and yield.
    *   **Suitable for Undulating Terrain:** Can be effectively used on uneven fields where flood irrigation is difficult or leads to uneven water distribution.
    *   **Prevents Waterlogging:** Allows for controlled application of water, minimizing the risk of over-irrigation and subsequent waterlogging, which is detrimental to Pigeon pea.
    *   **Soil Conservation:** Reduces soil erosion by applying water gently, mimicking rainfall.
    *   **Flexibility:** Can be easily adapted to different crop stages and water requirements.

*   **Suitability for Pigeon pea:**
    *   Sprinkler irrigation is highly recommended for Pigeon pea, particularly for applying the light, critical irrigations at branching/flowering and pod development stages.
    *   It helps in maintaining optimal soil moisture without saturating the soil, which is ideal for Pigeon pea's root system.
    *   While the initial investment might be higher, the long-term benefits in terms of water saving, increased yield, and improved crop health make it a viable and sustainable option for Pigeon pea cultivation in Haryana.

**In summary,** monitor your crop and soil moisture closely. Provide supplemental irrigation only when the crop shows signs of stress at critical growth stages (branching/flowering and pod development). Sprinkler irrigation is a highly efficient method to achieve this, ensuring optimal water use and higher yields.
