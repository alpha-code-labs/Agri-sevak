Protecting Pigeon pea (Arhar) from wild animals is a significant challenge for farmers in Haryana. While there are no CIBRC approved chemical repellents specifically for large wild animals affecting crops like Pigeon pea, a combination of physical, cultural, and traditional methods can be employed for effective management:

*   **Physical Barriers:**
    *   **Fencing:** Erecting sturdy fences such as barbed wire, chain-link, or stone walls around the field perimeter can deter larger animals like Nilgai and Wild Boar.
    *   **Electric Fencing:** Installing low-cost, solar-powered electric fences can be highly effective. Proper installation, earthing, and safety measures (e.g., warning signs) are crucial to prevent harm to animals and humans.
    *   **Bio-fencing:** Planting thorny and unpalatable bushes like *Prosopis juliflora*, *Carissa carandas* (Karonda), or *Opuntia* species (Cactus) as a live fence around the field can create a natural barrier.

*   **Non-Chemical Repellents and Deterrents:**
    *   **Auditory and Visual Deterrents:**
        *   **Scarecrows:** Traditional scarecrows, especially those with moving parts, reflective materials (e.g., old CDs, metallic strips), or bright colours, can deter birds and some animals.
        *   **Sound Devices:** Using firecrackers, gas guns (where permitted and safe), or other noise-making devices at critical times (e.g., dawn, dusk, or during peak feeding hours) can scare away animals.
        *   **Human Presence:** Employing guards or increasing human activity in and around the fields during vulnerable crop stages (pod formation to maturity) is often the most effective deterrent.
    *   **Olfactory Repellents:**
        *   **Chilli-Garlic Spray:** A mixture of crushed chilies and garlic, diluted in water, can be sprayed on the crop. The pungent smell and taste may deter some animals. This method requires frequent reapplication, especially after rain.
        *   **Cow Dung and Urine Slurry:** Spraying a fermented mixture of cow dung and urine can create an unpleasant smell that deters some animals from entering the field.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Synchronized Sowing:** Encouraging community-level synchronized sowing and harvesting can reduce the pressure on individual fields by providing a larger area for animals to forage, thus diluting damage.
    *   **Habitat Management:** Clearing weeds, bushes, and other potential hiding spots around the field perimeter can reduce the cover for wild animals, making them less likely to approach the crop.

**Important Note on Chemicals:**
As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I must emphasize that there are currently no CIBRC approved technical chemical names for repellents specifically targeting large wild animals (like Nilgai, Wild Boar, Monkeys) for crop protection in India. Therefore, the focus remains on integrated non-chemical management strategies.
