As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Pigeon pea (Arhar) in Haryana:

### Control of Grasshopper in Pigeon pea

Grasshoppers can be a significant pest, especially during the seedling and vegetative stages of Pigeon pea, causing defoliation.

**1. Cultural Control:**
*   **Deep Ploughing:** After harvest, deep ploughing of fields helps expose grasshopper eggs laid in the soil to predators and adverse weather conditions, reducing the next generation's population.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Keep field bunds and surrounding areas free of weeds, as these can serve as alternative hosts and breeding sites for grasshoppers.
*   **Timely Sowing:** Sowing the crop at the recommended time ensures vigorous growth, making the plants more tolerant to early-stage pest attacks.

**2. Chemical Control (if infestation is severe):**
*   For effective control, especially during outbreaks or high populations at the seedling stage:
    *   **Dusting:** Apply **Malathion 5% Dust** at 20-25 kg/acre.
    *   **Spraying:**
        *   **Malathion 50% EC** at 1.0-1.25 L/acre mixed in 200-250 L of water.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC** at 100-125 ml/acre mixed in 200-250 L of water. This insecticide is also effective against other chewing pests and pod borers.
        *   **Quinalphos 25% EC** at 1.0-1.25 L/acre mixed in 200-250 L of water.

### Control of Red cotton bug (Dysdercus cingulatus) in Pigeon pea

This is not known to affect Pigeon pea as a significant pest. The Red cotton bug (Dysdercus cingulatus) is primarily a pest of cotton and other malvaceous plants, feeding on developing seeds.

### Control of Black ants in Pigeon pea

This is not known to affect Pigeon pea as a direct pest causing economic damage to the crop itself. Black ants are generally not considered direct pests of Pigeon pea. They might be present in the field for various reasons, such as scavenging or tending to other sap-sucking insects (like aphids or mealybugs) for their honeydew. If ants are observed tending to other pests, the primary focus should be on controlling the sap-sucking insects, which will indirectly reduce the ant population. Direct control measures for ants on Pigeon pea are usually not warranted for crop protection.
