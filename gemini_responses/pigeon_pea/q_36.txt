### **I. Improving Yield of Pigeon pea**

1.  **Variety Selection:**
    *   Choose high-yielding, early to medium duration, and disease-resistant varieties suitable for Haryana's agro-climatic conditions. Consult your local Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or HAU for the latest recommended varieties.
    *   Look for varieties resistant to major diseases like Wilt and Sterility Mosaic Disease (SMD).

2.  **Sowing Management:**
    *   **Timely Sowing:** Optimal sowing time is crucial. For Kharif pigeon pea, sow during the last week of June to the first fortnight of July, coinciding with the onset of monsoon.
    *   **Spacing:** Maintain proper plant spacing. Typically, 60-75 cm row-to-row and 15-20 cm plant-to-plant spacing is recommended for optimum plant population and light penetration.
    *   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds before sowing to protect against soil-borne diseases and improve germination.
        *   Treat with **Carbendazim** (1 g/kg seed) + **Thiram** (2 g/kg seed) or **Carboxin** (2 g/kg seed) for fungal diseases.
        *   Inoculate with **Rhizobium** culture (10 g/kg seed) and Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria (PSB) culture (10 g/kg seed) for improved nitrogen fixation and phosphorus availability.

3.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Balanced Fertilization:**
        *   Apply 15-20 kg Nitrogen (N), 40-60 kg Phosphorus (P2O5), and 20 kg Potassium (K2O) per acre as basal dose.
        *   For N, use a starter dose as legumes fix their own N.
    *   **Micronutrients:** Pigeon pea often responds well to micronutrients.
        *   Apply Zinc Sulphate (25 kg/acre) as basal if soil is deficient.
        *   Foliar spray of 0.5% Zinc Sulphate and 0.1% Borax at flowering and pod development stages can be beneficial.
        *   Molybdenum is crucial for nitrogen fixation; apply Sodium Molybdate (0.5 kg/acre) as basal or 0.05% foliar spray.

4.  **Water Management:**
    *   Pigeon pea is largely rainfed, but critical irrigation at flowering and pod development stages can significantly boost yield, especially during dry spells.
    *   Avoid waterlogging, as it can lead to root rot.

5.  **Weed Management:**
    *   Weeds compete heavily with pigeon pea, especially during the first 45-60 days after sowing.
    *   **Manual Weeding:** Two manual weedings at 20-25 and 40-45 days after sowing are highly effective.
    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   Pre-emergence application of **Pendimethalin** (1.0 kg a.i./acre) within 2-3 days of sowing.
        *   Post-emergence application of **Imazethapyr** (75 g a.i./acre) at 20-25 days after sowing for broad-spectrum weed control.

6.  **Pest and Disease Management (Integrated Pest Management - IPM):**
    *   **Major Pests:** Pod borer (Helicoverpa armigera), Pod fly (Melanagromyza obtusa).
        *   Install pheromone traps (4-5 traps/acre) for monitoring pod borer.
        *   For pod borer, spray with **Chlorantraniliprole** (60 ml/acre) or **Emamectin benzoate** (80-100 g/acre) or **Flubendiamide** (80 ml/acre) at flowering and pod formation stages. Repeat if necessary.
        *   For pod fly, spray with **Dimethoate** (400 ml/acre) or **Thiomethoxam** (80 g/acre) at pod initiation.
    *   **Major Diseases:** Wilt (Fusarium udum), Sterility Mosaic Disease (SMD).
        *   **Wilt:** Use resistant varieties. Seed treatment (as mentioned above). Crop rotation.
        *   **Sterility Mosaic Disease (SMD):** This is a viral disease spread by eriophyid mites. Use resistant varieties. Control mites by spraying **Spiromesifen** (200 ml/acre) or **Propargite** (500 ml/acre) if mite infestation is observed.

### **II. Improving Fruit Quality of Pigeon pea**

1.  **Balanced Nutrition:**
    *   Adequate supply of Phosphorus and Potassium, along with micronutrients like Zinc and Boron, is crucial for better seed size, plumpness, and protein content.
    *   Foliar application of 2% DAP (Di-ammonium Phosphate) solution at flowering and pod development stages can enhance pod filling and grain quality.

2.  **Effective Pest and Disease Control:**
    *   Healthy plants free from pest and disease damage produce superior quality pods and grains. Timely management of pod borers, pod flies, and diseases like wilt and SMD prevents shriveled, discolored, or damaged grains.

3.  **Timely Harvesting:**
    *   Harvest the crop when 80-90% of the pods have matured and dried on the plant.
    *   Premature harvesting leads to shriveled, immature grains, while delayed harvesting can result in shattering losses, pest infestation, and quality deterioration due to adverse weather.

### **III. Improving Storage Life of Pigeon pea**

1.  **Proper Drying:**
    *   This is the most critical step. Dry the harvested pods/grains thoroughly to a safe moisture content of 9-10% before storage.
    *   Inadequate drying leads to mold growth, insect infestation, and rapid deterioration of grain quality.
    *   Spread grains thinly on a clean, dry surface in direct sunlight or use mechanical dryers.

2.  **Cleaning and Grading:**
    *   Clean the grains thoroughly to remove all foreign matter, chaff, broken grains, and insect-damaged grains.
    *   Grading for uniform size and quality can also improve market value and storage efficiency.

3.  **Safe Storage Structures:**
    *   Store grains in clean, dry, well-ventilated, rodent-proof, and insect-proof structures (e.g., metal bins, Pusa bins, or improved traditional structures).
    *   Ensure the storage area is free from cracks and crevices that can harbor pests.
    *   Disinfest empty storage structures and gunny bags before filling. Spray empty godowns/sacks with **Malathion** (50% EC at 10 ml/L water).

4.  **Storage Pest Management:**
    *   **Prophylactic Treatment:** Mix a safe insecticide dust like **Malathion** (5% dust at 250 g/100 kg grain) with the grains if long-term storage is planned, ensuring even mixing.
    *   **Fumigation:** For large-scale storage or severe infestation, fumigation can be done by trained personnel using **Aluminium phosphide** tablets (1-2 tablets of 3g per tonne of grain) in airtight conditions for 5-7 days. This should only be done by certified professionals due to its highly toxic nature.
    *   **Regular Inspection:** Periodically inspect stored grains for signs of insect infestation, mold growth, or moisture accumulation. Take corrective measures promptly.
