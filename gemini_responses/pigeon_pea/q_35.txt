As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the maturity signs, harvesting time, and cutting process for Pigeon pea (Arhar/Tur) in Haryana:

### Maturity Signs for Pigeon pea

The physiological maturity of Pigeon pea is indicated by several key signs:

*   **Pod Color Change:** The most prominent sign is the change in pod color from green to a dull yellow, straw, or brownish color, depending on the variety.
*   **Leaf Senescence:** Leaves start yellowing, drying, and eventually shedding from the plant. A significant portion of the foliage will have dropped.
*   **Seed Hardness:** The seeds inside the pods become hard and firm. When a pod is shaken, the seeds will rattle.
*   **Plant Dryness:** The entire plant begins to dry out, and the stem may also show signs of drying and hardening.
*   **Moisture Content:** At physiological maturity, the seed moisture content typically ranges from 18-20%. For optimal harvesting and storage, it should be further dried to 10-12%.

### Harvesting Time for Pigeon pea

*   **Optimal Stage:** Harvesting should commence when approximately 75-80% of the pods on the plant have matured and dried, exhibiting the signs mentioned above.
*   **Timing:** Harvesting too early can result in a high percentage of immature grains, leading to lower yield and poor quality. Delaying harvest, especially in varieties prone to shattering or during windy conditions, can lead to significant grain losses due to pod dehiscence.
*   **Variety Duration:** The actual harvesting period will depend on the variety's duration. Early-maturing varieties are typically ready in 120-150 days, medium-duration varieties in 150-180 days, and late-duration varieties in 180-250 days after sowing. Farmers should monitor their specific variety's development.

### Cutting Process for Pigeon pea

The cutting process can be done manually or mechanically, followed by proper drying and threshing.

*   **Manual Harvesting:**
    *   **Method:** Plants are cut close to the ground, typically 5-10 cm above the soil surface, using a sickle. Cutting close to the ground can also facilitate ratooning (regrowth for a second flush of pods) if the variety and conditions are suitable, though this is less common for commercial grain production in Haryana.
    *   **Handling:** The harvested plants are then tied into small bundles.
*   **Mechanical Harvesting:**
    *   **Method:** For large areas and varieties with erect growth habits and uniform maturity, combine harvesters can be employed. However, pigeon pea's indeterminate growth and uneven maturity in many varieties can pose challenges for conventional combines, often requiring specialized pulse harvesters or modified combine headers.
*   **Post-Harvest Drying:**
    *   After cutting, the bundles of plants are stacked in the field or on a clean threshing floor for sun-drying. This drying period typically lasts for 5-7 days, or until the pods are completely dry and brittle, and the seed moisture content reaches 10-12% for safe storage.
*   **Threshing and Winnowing:**
    *   Once adequately dried, the bundles are threshed either manually (by beating with sticks) or using a mechanical thresher to separate the grains from the pods and stalks.
    *   The threshed material is then winnowed to separate the clean grain from the chaff and other debris.
