As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding rust diseases in Pigeon pea for Haryana, India:

Regarding the specific rust diseases you mentioned:

*   **Black Rust:** This is not known to affect Pigeon pea.
*   **Brown Rust:** This is not known to affect Pigeon pea.
*   **Yellow Rust:** This is not known to affect Pigeon pea.
*   **White Rust:** This is not known to affect Pigeon pea.
*   **Red Rust:** This is not known to affect Pigeon pea.

The primary rust disease affecting Pigeon pea (arhar) is caused by *Uredo cajani* (also known as *Phakopsora cajani*), commonly referred to as Pigeon pea Rust. This disease can cause significant yield losses under favorable conditions.

Here's how to control Pigeon pea Rust (*Uredo cajani*):

**1. Cultural Practices:**

*   **Resistant Varieties:** Plant rust-resistant or tolerant varieties recommended for your region. Consult HAU for the latest recommendations suitable for Haryana.
*   **Timely Sowing:** Adhere to recommended sowing dates to help plants escape peak disease periods.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest to reduce inoculum for the next season.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops to break the disease cycle.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure balanced fertilizer application, as excessive nitrogen can sometimes make plants more susceptible.

**2. Chemical Control (Fungicides):**

Fungicides should be applied at the first appearance of symptoms or when weather conditions (high humidity, moderate temperatures) are favorable for disease development. Repeat applications may be necessary depending on disease severity and weather conditions. Always ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.

CIBRC approved technical chemical names for rust control in Pigeon pea include:

*   **Propiconazole 25% EC**: Apply at a rate of 500 ml per acre, mixed in 200-300 liters of water.
*   **Mancozeb 75% WP**: Apply at a rate of 800 g per acre, mixed in 200-300 liters of water.
*   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC**: Apply at a rate of 200 ml per acre, mixed in 200-300 liters of water.

Always read and follow the instructions on the fungicide label for safe and effective use, including pre-harvest intervals.
