As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I advise that addressing micronutrient deficiencies in Pigeon pea (Arhar) is crucial for optimal growth and yield. The first and most critical step is always to conduct a comprehensive soil test to accurately diagnose the specific deficiencies and their severity. Visual symptoms can be indicative, but soil analysis provides a precise basis for corrective action.

Here's how to address the specified micronutrient deficiencies in Pigeon pea:

### General Recommendations:
*   **Soil Testing:** Always begin with soil testing to confirm the deficiency and determine the appropriate dosage.
*   **Foliar Application:** Often preferred for quick correction of deficiencies, especially for mobile nutrients or when soil conditions (e.g., high pH) limit nutrient availability. Apply sprays during cooler parts of the day (morning or late afternoon).
*   **Soil Application:** Suitable for long-term correction and for immobile nutrients.
*   **Water Quality:** Use clean water for foliar sprays.
*   **Spreading Agent:** Always add a non-ionic spreading agent (sticker) at recommended rates to foliar sprays for better coverage and absorption.

### Specific Micronutrient Deficiencies:

#### 1. Zinc (Zn)
Zinc deficiency is widespread in Indian soils, including Haryana, and significantly impacts Pigeon pea.
*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, small leaves (little leaf symptom), interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, bronzing of older leaves, delayed maturity.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Soil Application (at sowing):**
        *   Apply **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (21% Zn) at 25 kg/acre.
        *   Alternatively, apply **Zinc sulphate monohydrate** (33% Zn) at 10-12 kg/acre.
    *   **Foliar Spray (when symptoms appear, usually 30-45 days after sowing, repeat at 15-day intervals):**
        *   Spray 0.5% solution of **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (5 g/L water) mixed with 0.25% unslaked lime (2.5 g/L water) to prevent phytotoxicity.
        *   Alternatively, spray 0.1% solution of **Zinc EDTA** (1 g/L water).
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays depending on the severity.

#### 2. Iron (Fe) / Ferrous
Iron deficiency is common in calcareous and alkaline soils prevalent in Haryana, where high pH reduces iron availability.
*   **Symptoms:** Prominent interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins, while veins remain green) on younger leaves, leading to severe yellowing or whitening in extreme cases.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Foliar Spray (most effective due to soil fixation; apply when symptoms appear, repeat at 10-15 day intervals):**
        *   Spray 0.5-1.0% solution of **Ferrous sulphate** (5-10 g/L water) mixed with 0.25% unslaked lime (2.5 g/L water).
        *   Alternatively, spray 0.1% solution of **Iron EDTA** (1 g/L water).
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays.
    *   **Soil Application:** Generally less effective in high pH soils but can be considered in acidic soils if present, using **Ferrous sulphate** at 20-40 kg/acre.

#### 3. Boron (B)
Boron deficiency can severely affect flowering, pollination, and pod development in Pigeon pea.
*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, thickening and brittleness of young leaves, poor flower and pod set, malformed or empty pods, cracking of pods, and sometimes hollow stems.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Soil Application (at sowing):**
        *   Apply **Borax** (10.5% B) at 4-6 kg/acre.
        *   Alternatively, apply **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (20% B) at 2-3 kg/acre.
    *   **Foliar Spray (at pre-flowering and pod development stages):**
        *   Spray 0.1-0.2% solution of **Borax** (1-2 g/L water).
        *   Alternatively, spray 0.1% solution of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (1 g/L water).
        *   Apply 1-2 sprays.

#### 4. Calcium (Ca)
Calcium deficiency is less common in Pigeon pea in Haryana's soils, which are often rich in calcium. However, it can occur in highly acidic or very sandy soils.
*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, necrosis (death) of young leaves and growing points, poor root development, and sometimes blossom end rot-like symptoms on pods.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Soil Application (if severe acidity is the cause):**
        *   Apply **Gypsum** (for Ca and S, beneficial for sodic soils) at 200-400 kg/acre, or **Calcium chloride** at 10-20 kg/acre.
        *   Alternatively, **Calcium nitrate** can be used.
    *   **Foliar Spray (if symptoms appear):**
        *   Spray 0.5% solution of **Calcium chloride** (5 g/L water).
        *   Alternatively, spray 0.5% solution of **Calcium nitrate** (5 g/L water).

#### 5. Magnesium (Mg)
Magnesium deficiency can occur in sandy soils or soils with an imbalance of other cations (e.g., high potassium).
*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves (yellowing between veins, veins remain green), sometimes with a purplish or reddish discoloration.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Soil Application (at sowing):**
        *   Apply **Magnesium sulphate** (Epsom salt) at 10-20 kg/acre.
    *   **Foliar Spray (when symptoms appear):**
        *   Spray 0.5-1.0% solution of **Magnesium sulphate** (5-10 g/L water).
        *   Apply 1-2 sprays.

#### 6. Manganese (Mn)
Manganese deficiency can occur in alkaline soils, similar to iron, but is generally less common than iron or zinc deficiency in Pigeon pea.
*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, often with small necrotic (dead) spots appearing within the yellowed areas. Growth may be stunted.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Foliar Spray (most effective in alkaline soils; apply when symptoms appear, repeat at 10-15 day intervals):**
        *   Spray 0.5% solution of **Manganese sulphate** (5 g/L water) mixed with 0.25% unslaked lime (2.5 g/L water).
        *   Alternatively, spray 0.1% solution of **Manganese EDTA** (1 g/L water).
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays.
    *   **Soil Application:** **Manganese sulphate** at 10-15 kg/acre can be applied, but its effectiveness is limited in high pH soils.

By following these scientifically verified recommendations, farmers can effectively manage micronutrient deficiencies in Pigeon pea, leading to healthier crops and improved yields. Always consult with local agricultural extension services for specific advice tailored to your farm's conditions.
