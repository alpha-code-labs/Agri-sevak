Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU), Hisar, I understand your concern regarding the potential harmful effects of weedicides/herbicides on Pigeon pea (Arhar/Tur) crops. While herbicides are crucial for effective weed management and maximizing yields, improper use can lead to phytotoxicity and crop damage.

Here are scientifically verified strategies to reduce the harmful effects of weedicides/herbicides in Pigeon pea:

*   **Select the Right Herbicide:**
    *   Always choose herbicides that are specifically approved and recommended for Pigeon pea cultivation in India by CIBRC (Central Insecticides Board & Registration Committee).
    *   **Pre-emergence Herbicides:** For control of germinating weeds, **Pendimethalin** (30% EC at 3.3 L/acre or 38.7% CS at 2.6 L/acre) is commonly recommended. Apply within 1-3 days after sowing on moist soil.
    *   **Post-emergence Herbicides:**
        *   For broadleaf weeds and some grasses: **Imazethapyr** (10% SL at 1.0 L/acre) can be used. Apply when weeds are at 2-4 leaf stage (typically 20-25 days after sowing). Note that temporary yellowing or stunting of the crop may occur, but plants usually recover.
        *   For grassy weeds only: **Quizalofop-ethyl** (5% EC at 1.0 L/acre) or **Fenoxaprop-p-ethyl** (9% EC at 0.5 L/acre) are effective. Apply when grassy weeds are at 2-4 leaf stage.

*   **Adhere to Recommended Dosage:**
    *   Strictly follow the recommended dose mentioned on the herbicide label. Overdosing is a primary cause of phytotoxicity.
    *   Underdosing can lead to poor weed control, necessitating repeat applications or higher doses later, which can also stress the crop.

*   **Timely Application:**
    *   **Pre-emergence herbicides** must be applied within the specified window (usually 1-3 days after sowing) before weed emergence.
    *   **Post-emergence herbicides** are most effective and safest for the crop when applied at the correct weed growth stage (e.g., 2-4 leaf stage of weeds) and the recommended crop stage. Applying too early or too late can increase crop injury or reduce efficacy.

*   **Proper Application Technique:**
    *   **Calibration:** Ensure your spray equipment is properly calibrated to deliver the correct volume of spray solution per unit area.
    *   **Uniform Coverage:** Use appropriate nozzles (e.g., flat fan nozzles) to ensure uniform spray coverage. Avoid overlapping or missing areas.
    *   **Water Volume:** Use the recommended water volume (typically 300-500 L/acre for ground application) to ensure proper coverage and herbicide activation.
    *   **Avoid Drift:** Apply herbicides on calm days to prevent drift to non-target crops or sensitive areas.

*   **Optimal Soil Moisture and Environmental Conditions:**
    *   **Soil Moisture:** For pre-emergence herbicides, adequate soil moisture is crucial for their activation and efficacy. For post-emergence herbicides, avoid application during drought stress or waterlogged conditions, as stressed plants are more susceptible to herbicide injury.
    *   **Temperature:** Avoid applying herbicides during extreme high or low temperatures, as these conditions can increase crop sensitivity and herbicide phytotoxicity.

*   **Maintain Crop Vigor:**
    *   Healthy and vigorous Pigeon pea plants are more tolerant to herbicide stress. Ensure good seedbed preparation, optimal sowing depth, balanced nutrient management, and timely irrigation to promote strong crop growth.

*   **Use of Adjuvants (if recommended):**
    *   Some post-emergence herbicides may require the addition of specific non-ionic surfactants or adjuvants. Use only those recommended on the herbicide label, as incorrect adjuvants can sometimes increase phytotoxicity.

*   **Post-Application Management for Recovery:**
    *   If mild herbicide injury occurs, ensure the crop receives adequate moisture and nutrients. A light irrigation can sometimes help dilute the herbicide concentration in the root zone or aid recovery.
    *   Foliar application of a balanced nutrient solution (e.g., urea 2% or micronutrient mixture) can sometimes help plants recover from stress, but consult with an agronomist before applying.

By meticulously following these guidelines, you can effectively manage weeds in your Pigeon pea crop while minimizing any harmful effects of herbicides, ensuring a healthy and productive yield. Always consult your local agricultural extension officer for the most current and specific recommendations for your region.
