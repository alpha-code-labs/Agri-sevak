As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), here are the recommended cultivation practices for Pigeon pea (Arhar/Tur) in Haryana:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   **Line Sowing:** This is the most recommended method. It facilitates better intercultural operations such as weeding, spraying, and harvesting, and ensures uniform plant stand. Sowing can be done using a seed drill or by manual dibbling.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   **3-5 cm:** The seeds should be sown at a depth of 3 to 5 cm. This ensures proper moisture availability for germination and allows for good seedling emergence.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   **Row-to-Row:** 60-75 cm
    *   **Plant-to-Plant:** 15-20 cm
    *   *Note:* For early duration varieties, a spacing of 60 cm (row-to-row) x 15 cm (plant-to-plant) is often preferred. For medium to late duration varieties, 75 cm (row-to-row) x 20 cm (plant-to-plant) is generally recommended to allow for better branching and growth.

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   **12-15 kg/acre:** For sole cropping, a seed rate of 12-15 kg per acre is recommended to achieve the optimal plant population. Adjustments may be needed based on seed size and germination percentage.
