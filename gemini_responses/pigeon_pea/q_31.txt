As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I will provide scientifically verified advice for controlling these physical damages in Pigeon pea (Arhar/Tur) in Haryana.

### 1. Fruit Bursting (Pod Splitting)

This is a physiological disorder known to affect Pigeon pea, leading to significant yield losses. It is primarily caused by:
*   **Sudden fluctuations in soil moisture:** A dry spell followed by heavy rainfall or irrigation can cause rapid water uptake, leading to internal pressure and pod splitting.
*   **Boron deficiency:** Boron plays a crucial role in cell wall integrity and elasticity.
*   **High temperatures:** Can exacerbate the condition.
*   **Genetic predisposition:** Some varieties are more susceptible.

**Control Measures:**
*   **Water Management:**
    *   Maintain consistent soil moisture, especially during the pod development and filling stages.
    *   Provide light and frequent irrigations during dry spells to prevent extreme moisture fluctuations.
*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Conduct soil testing to assess boron levels.
    *   If boron deficiency is indicated or suspected, apply **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate) at 10-15 kg/acre as a soil application before sowing, or foliar spray **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (20% Boron) at 1-2 g/L of water at flowering and pod development stages. Repeat if necessary.
*   **Variety Selection:**
    *   Choose varieties known to be less prone to pod splitting. Consult HAU recommendations for suitable varieties in Haryana.
*   **Timely Harvesting:**
    *   Harvest the crop at physiological maturity to prevent over-drying of pods in the field, which makes them more susceptible to splitting upon rehydration or handling.

### 2. Leaf Burning/Melting

This is a symptom that can arise from various non-pathogenic factors affecting Pigeon pea. "Melting" is less common, but severe burning can lead to tissue collapse.

**Common Causes:**
*   **Heat Stress/Sun Scorch:** High temperatures, especially combined with water stress, can cause leaf tissue damage.
*   **Chemical Phytotoxicity:** Improper application (overdose, wrong timing, spraying during high temperatures) of herbicides, insecticides, or fungicides can lead to leaf burn.
*   **Waterlogging:** Prolonged waterlogging can damage roots, leading to wilting and subsequent "burning" or collapse of leaves due to impaired water uptake.
*   **Nutrient Imbalance/Toxicity:** Less common for widespread burning, but specific nutrient toxicities can cause marginal necrosis.

**Control Measures:**
*   **Water Management:**
    *   Ensure adequate and timely irrigation, especially during hot and dry periods, to mitigate heat and water stress.
    *   Ensure proper drainage to prevent waterlogging, particularly in heavy soils.
*   **Careful Chemical Application:**
    *   Always follow label instructions precisely for all agrochemicals regarding dosage, timing, and application methods.
    *   Avoid spraying during peak sunlight hours or when temperatures are very high (above 30-32°C) to minimize the risk of phytotoxicity.
    *   Use recommended nozzles and spray volumes for uniform coverage.
*   **Soil Health:**
    *   Improve soil organic matter content and structure to enhance water retention and drainage.
*   **Variety Selection:**
    *   Consider heat-tolerant varieties if heat stress is a recurring issue in your area.

### 3. Hardness in Fruit (Hard-to-Cook Phenomenon / Hard Seed)

This is a significant post-harvest quality issue in Pigeon pea, affecting its cooking quality and market value. It is a physiological change in the seed that makes it resistant to softening during cooking.

**Causes:**
*   **Storage Conditions:** High temperature and high humidity during storage are the primary accelerators of the hard-to-cook (HTC) phenomenon.
*   **Genetic Factors:** Some pigeon pea varieties are inherently more susceptible to developing hard seeds.
*   **Maturity at Harvest:** Harvesting immature or over-mature pods can sometimes contribute.
*   **Drying Conditions:** Improper or very rapid drying can also play a role.

**Control Measures:**
*   **Variety Selection:**
    *   Choose pigeon pea varieties known for good cooking quality and less susceptibility to the hard-to-cook phenomenon. Consult HAU recommendations for suitable varieties.
*   **Optimal Harvesting:**
    *   Harvest the crop at physiological maturity when most pods have dried but before they become overly brittle.
*   **Proper Drying:**
    *   Dry the harvested pods/seeds thoroughly and uniformly to a safe moisture content (typically 10-12%) immediately after harvest. Avoid very rapid drying at high temperatures.
*   **Appropriate Storage:**
    *   Store the dried pigeon pea seeds in cool, dry, and well-ventilated conditions.
    *   Use moisture-proof containers or bags to prevent re-absorption of moisture.
    *   Avoid storing seeds in areas exposed to direct sunlight or high ambient temperatures.
