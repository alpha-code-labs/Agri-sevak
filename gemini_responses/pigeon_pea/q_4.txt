Wilt (caused by *Fusarium udum*) and Parawilt (caused by *Phytophthora drechsleri* f. sp. *cajani*) are significant diseases affecting Pigeon pea (Arhar) in Haryana, leading to substantial yield losses. Effective management requires an integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods.

Here's how to control Wilt and Parawilt in Pigeon pea:

**I. General Management Principles (Applicable to both Wilt and Parawilt):**

*   **Resistant Varieties:** The most effective and economical control measure. Consult HAU for recommended wilt and parawilt resistant/tolerant varieties suitable for your region in Haryana.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid continuous cultivation of Pigeon pea in the same field. Rotate with non-host crops like cereals (wheat, maize, sorghum) for at least 3-4 years to reduce pathogen inoculum in the soil.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris from the field to prevent the build-up and spread of pathogens.
*   **Soil Health Management:** Improve soil drainage, especially in fields prone to waterlogging, as waterlogging exacerbates Parawilt. Incorporate organic matter (FYM, compost) to enhance soil microbial activity, which can suppress pathogens.
*   **Timely Sowing:** Adhere to recommended sowing dates to ensure plants are vigorous and less susceptible to early infections.

**II. Specific Control Measures for Wilt (*Fusarium udum*):**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   As above, resistant varieties and crop rotation are key.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds with bio-control agents before sowing.
        *   **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum** @ 4-5 g/kg seed.
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum** @ 2.5 kg/acre, mixed with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost, and applied to the soil before sowing or at the time of sowing.

3.  **Chemical Control (Seed Treatment):**
    *   Treat seeds with fungicides before sowing.
        *   **Carbendazim 50% WP** @ 2 g/kg seed.
        *   **Thiophanate Methyl 70% WP** @ 2 g/kg seed.
        *   A combination of **Carbendazim 12% + Mancozeb 63% WP** @ 2.5 g/kg seed can also be effective.

**III. Specific Control Measures for Parawilt (*Phytophthora drechsleri* f. sp. *cajani*):**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Resistant Varieties:** Utilize varieties with resistance or tolerance to Parawilt.
    *   **Improved Drainage:** Ensure good field drainage to prevent water stagnation, which is highly conducive to Parawilt development. Avoid planting in low-lying areas prone to waterlogging.
    *   **Raised Beds:** In areas with heavy soils and poor drainage, planting on raised beds can help reduce disease incidence.

2.  **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Seed Treatment:**
        *   **Metalaxyl-M 35% WS** @ 6 g/kg seed.
        *   **Metalaxyl-M 4% + Mancozeb 64% WP** @ 2.5 g/kg seed.
    *   **Soil Drenching (if disease appears in patches):**
        *   **Metalaxyl-M 4% + Mancozeb 64% WP** @ 2.5 g/L water, drench around the base of affected plants (approximately 200-250 ml solution per plant).
        *   **Propamocarb Hydrochloride 72.2% SL** @ 2.5 ml/L water, drench around the base of affected plants.
        *   **Copper Oxychloride 50% WP** @ 3 g/L water, drench around the base of affected plants.

**Integrated Approach:**
For sustainable and effective control, it is crucial to adopt an integrated disease management (IDM) strategy, combining resistant varieties, good cultural practices, biological control, and judicious use of CIBRC-approved chemical fungicides as needed. Always consult with local agricultural extension services or HAU experts for the most current recommendations specific to your farm and prevailing conditions.
