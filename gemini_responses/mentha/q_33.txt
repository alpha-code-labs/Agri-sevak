As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an integrated approach for weed management in Mentha (Mint) to ensure effective control and maintain crop health and yield. This involves a combination of cultural practices and judicious use of CIBRC-approved herbicides.

Here's a detailed plan for controlling the specified weeds in Mentha:

**I. General Weed Management Principles:**

*   **Clean Planting Material:** Ensure stolons/suckers used for planting are free from weed seeds or vegetative propagules.
*   **Field Preparation:** Thorough ploughing and harrowing can reduce initial weed load.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate Mentha with non-host crops to break weed cycles, especially for parasitic weeds if they were an issue in previous crops (though Orobanche is not a host for Mentha).
*   **Timely Irrigation and Fertilization:** Promote vigorous Mentha growth to outcompete weeds.
*   **Manual Weeding:** Essential, especially for broadleaf weeds where selective post-emergence chemical options are limited, and for parasitic weeds like Amarbail.

**II. Herbicide Recommendations:**

**A. Pre-Emergence Herbicides (for Broadleaf and Narrowleaf Weeds):**
These herbicides are applied to the soil surface before weed emergence (and ideally before Mentha sprouts fully or immediately after planting).

1.  **For Broadleaf Weeds (including Bathu, Congress grass) and Narrowleaf Weeds (including Phalaris minor):**
    *   **Pendimethalin 30% EC:** Apply 1.0 - 1.3 Litres per acre in 200-300 Litres of water.
        *   **Timing:** Apply within 3 days of planting Mentha stolons or immediately after the first irrigation following planting, before weed emergence. Ensure good soil moisture for activation.
    *   **Oxyfluorfen 23.5% EC:** Apply 200 - 400 ml per acre in 200-300 Litres of water.
        *   **Timing:** Apply as a pre-emergence spray within 3 days of planting or before Mentha sprouts. It can also provide early post-emergence control for very young weeds (2-3 leaf stage).

**B. Post-Emergence Herbicides (for Narrowleaf Weeds/Grasses):**
These herbicides are selective for grasses and can be applied when Mentha is established and grasses are actively growing.

1.  **For Narrowleaf Weeds (including Phalaris minor):**
    *   **Quizalofop-ethyl 5% EC:** Apply 400 - 500 ml per acre in 200-300 Litres of water.
        *   **Timing:** Apply when grasses are at the 2-4 leaf stage and actively growing.
    *   **Fenoxaprop-p-ethyl 9% EC:** Apply 250 - 350 ml per acre in 200-300 Litres of water.
        *   **Timing:** Apply when grasses are at the 2-4 leaf stage and actively growing.
    *   **Fluazifop-p-butyl 25% EC:** Apply 200 - 300 ml per acre in 200-300 Litres of water.
        *   **Timing:** Apply when grasses are at the 2-4 leaf stage and actively growing.

**III. Control of Specific Weeds:**

*   **Broadleaf Weeds (Bathu, Congress grass):**
    *   These are primarily controlled by pre-emergence application of **Pendimethalin** or **Oxyfluorfen**.
    *   For established broadleaf weeds, selective post-emergence chemical options are very limited in Mentha without causing crop injury. **Manual weeding** is the most effective and recommended method for post-emergence broadleaf weed control.

*   **Narrowleaf Weeds (Phalaris minor):**
    *   Effectively controlled by pre-emergence **Pendimethalin**.
    *   For post-emergence control, use grass-specific herbicides like **Quizalofop-ethyl**, **Fenoxaprop-p-ethyl**, or **Fluazifop-p-butyl** as detailed above.

*   **Amarbail (Cuscuta spp.):**
    *   This is a parasitic weed. Chemical control in Mentha is extremely challenging and often not selective.
    *   **Prevention is key:** Use clean planting material and avoid planting in fields with a history of Amarbail infestation.
    *   **Pre-emergence:** **Pendimethalin** can offer some suppression of Amarbail seed germination if applied before its emergence.
    *   **Post-emergence:** The most effective method is **manual removal** of infested Mentha plants or cutting the Amarbail before it produces seeds. Remove and destroy the parasitic weed away from the field.

*   **Orobanche (Broomrape):**
    *   **This is not known to affect Mentha.** Orobanche species are parasitic weeds that typically infest crops like tomato, potato, tobacco, mustard, and legumes. Mentha (Mint) is not a known host for Orobanche.

**IV. General Precautions for Herbicide Application:**

*   Always read and follow the label instructions of the specific herbicide product.
*   Use the recommended dosage and water volume.
*   Ensure uniform spray coverage.
*   Use appropriate spray nozzles (e.g., flat fan nozzles for herbicides).
*   Avoid spraying on windy days to prevent drift to non-target crops.
*   Wear personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application.
*   Do not mix different herbicides without prior knowledge of compatibility and crop safety.
*   Observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) for each herbicide.

For any specific field conditions or persistent weed problems, it is always advisable to consult with the experts at HAU, Hisar, or your local agricultural extension office.
