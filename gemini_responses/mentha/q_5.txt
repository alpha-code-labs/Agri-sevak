As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm the following regarding the conditions mentioned for Mentha cultivation in Haryana:

1.  **Scab in Mentha:**
    This is not known to affect Mentha.

2.  **Canker in Mentha:**
    This is not known to affect Mentha.

3.  **Gummosis in Mentha:**
    This is not known to affect Mentha. Gummosis is typically a condition observed in woody perennial plants, particularly fruit trees, and Mentha is a herbaceous plant.

4.  **Lichen in Mentha:**
    This is not known to affect Mentha. Lichens are symbiotic organisms that grow on surfaces like tree bark, rocks, or soil. They are generally non-parasitic and do not cause harm to herbaceous plants like Mentha. They are unlikely to establish on Mentha stems in a cultivated field setting.
