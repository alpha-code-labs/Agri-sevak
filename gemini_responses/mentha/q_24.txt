Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with the scientifically verified recommendations for Mentha transplantation in Haryana.

Here is the ideal transplantation time, distance, and process for Mentha:

### Ideal Transplantation Time

For optimal growth and yield in Haryana's climate, the ideal time for Mentha transplantation is:
*   **Mid-February to Mid-March:** This period allows the plants to establish well before the intense summer heat and ensures robust growth for multiple harvests throughout the season.

### Ideal Transplantation Distance

Maintaining proper spacing is crucial for good aeration, light penetration, and ease of inter-cultural operations, leading to better yield and quality of Mentha oil. The recommended spacing for Mentha (especially for varieties grown for oil extraction) is:
*   **Row-to-row distance:** 45-60 cm
*   **Plant-to-plant distance (sucker-to-sucker within the row):** 15-30 cm

### Transplantation Process

The transplantation process for Mentha, primarily using suckers, involves the following steps:

1.  **Field Preparation:**
    *   **Ploughing:** Plough the field thoroughly to a depth of 15-20 cm, followed by 2-3 harrowings to achieve a fine, friable tilth.
    *   **Levelling:** Level the field properly to ensure uniform irrigation and drainage.
    *   **Manure Application:** Incorporate 10-15 tonnes/acre of well-decomposed Farmyard Manure (FYM) or compost into the soil during the last ploughing. This enriches the soil and improves its structure.

2.  **Propagation Material Preparation:**
    *   **Sucker Selection:** Mentha is predominantly propagated vegetatively using healthy, disease-free suckers (underground stolons) or rooted cuttings. Obtain suckers from a healthy, established crop.
    *   **Sucker Cutting:** Cut the suckers into pieces, each 10-15 cm long, ensuring that each piece has at least 2-3 viable nodes.

3.  **Planting Method:**
    *   **Furrow Creation:** Make shallow furrows (3-5 cm deep) in the prepared field at the recommended row-to-row spacing (45-60 cm).
    *   **Sucker Placement:** Place the prepared suckers end-to-end or at the specified plant-to-plant distance (15-30 cm) within these furrows.
    *   **Covering:** Gently cover the suckers with 3-5 cm of soil and lightly press to ensure good soil-sucker contact.

4.  **Initial Irrigation:**
    *   **Immediate Watering:** Provide a light irrigation immediately after planting. This is critical for the establishment of the suckers and to settle the soil around them.
    *   **Moisture Management:** Maintain adequate soil moisture, especially during the initial 2-3 weeks, to facilitate sprouting and root development. Avoid waterlogging.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure a successful establishment and healthy growth of your Mentha crop in Haryana.
