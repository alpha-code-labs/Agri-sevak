Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, I can provide the recommended doses for organic manures in Mentha cultivation, keeping in mind the conditions in Haryana.

It's important to incorporate organic manures during land preparation to enrich the soil and provide a steady supply of nutrients throughout the crop cycle.

Here are the recommendations:

*   **Farm Yard Manure (FYM):**
    *   **Dose:** 10-15 tonnes per acre
    *   **Application:** Apply well-decomposed FYM uniformly across the field during the final ploughing or harrowing, at least 2-3 weeks before planting Mentha suckers or rooted cuttings. This allows for proper mixing with the soil and initial decomposition.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   **Dose:** 4-5 tonnes per acre
    *   **Application:** Vermicompost can be used as a substitute for FYM or as a supplement. If used as a substitute, apply it during land preparation, similar to FYM. If used as a supplement, a lower dose (e.g., 2-3 tonnes/acre) can be applied along with FYM, or it can be top-dressed in smaller quantities during early growth stages.

*   **Sagarika (IFFCO):**
    *   Sagarika is a seaweed extract-based bio-stimulant, not a bulk organic manure like FYM or vermicompost. It enhances nutrient uptake, promotes root growth, and improves overall plant vigour.
    *   **Foliar Spray:**
        *   **Dose:** 2.5-3.0 ml per litre of water
        *   **Application:** Apply as a foliar spray during active vegetative growth (e.g., 30-45 days after planting) and repeat if necessary before the first harvest, or after the first cut to promote regrowth. Ensure complete coverage of the foliage.
    *   **Soil Drench/Drip Application:**
        *   **Dose:** 1.0-1.5 litres per acre
        *   **Application:** Can be applied through drip irrigation or as a soil drench during critical growth stages to stimulate root development and nutrient absorption.

**Important Note:** While these are general recommendations, conducting a soil test is always advisable to determine the specific nutrient status of your field and tailor the manure application rates for optimal results.
