As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding Growth Regulators/Hormones for Mentha cultivation in Haryana:

It is crucial to understand the specific role of each compound, as their application rates and effects vary significantly. Always consult the product label for specific instructions and safety precautions.

*   **Ethephon** (commonly sold as Ethrel)
    *   **Role in Mentha:** **Ethephon** is a plant growth regulator that releases ethylene, influencing various physiological processes. In Mentha, it can be used for specific objectives such as promoting branching, increasing biomass, or delaying flowering to extend the vegetative phase, which can potentially lead to higher essential oil yields. However, its application requires careful consideration of timing and concentration to avoid adverse effects.
    *   **Recommended Dose (Foliar Spray):** For specific growth regulation purposes, a foliar spray of **Ethephon** at a concentration of 250-500 ppm (parts per million) is generally suggested.
        *   For a typical commercial formulation containing 39% **Ethephon** (390 g/L), this translates to approximately **0.6 - 1.3 ml/L** of water.
        *   Apply during the active vegetative growth phase, typically 30-45 days after planting or after the first harvest, depending on the desired effect and crop stage. Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.

*   **2,4-D**
    *   **Role in Mentha:** **2,4-D** (2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) is primarily a selective systemic herbicide widely used for controlling broadleaf weeds. While it is a synthetic auxin and can act as a plant growth regulator at extremely low concentrations in specific applications (e.g., tissue culture), its use as a growth regulator in field-grown Mentha is **not recommended**.
    *   **Recommendation:** Applying **2,4-D** at typical field rates for growth regulation would severely damage or kill Mentha plants, as Mentha itself is a broadleaf crop susceptible to this herbicide. Therefore, **2,4-D** should only be used as a herbicide for weed control in non-Mentha crops, strictly avoiding any drift onto Mentha fields.

*   **Boron**
    *   **Role in Mentha:** **Boron** is an essential micronutrient vital for cell wall formation, sugar transport, flowering, pollen viability, and overall plant development. While not a "hormone" in the classical sense, its adequate supply is critical for healthy growth and yield. Boron deficiency can lead to stunted growth, poor flowering, and reduced essential oil content.
    *   **Recommended Dose (Foliar Spray):** For correcting Boron deficiency or as a prophylactic measure, a foliar spray is often effective.
        *   Use **Disodium tetraborate decahydrate** (Borax, containing approximately 10.5-11.3% elemental Boron) at a concentration of **1-2 g/L** of water (0.1-0.2% solution).
        *   Alternatively, **Boric acid** (containing approximately 17% elemental Boron) can be used at a concentration of **0.6-1.2 g/L** of water.
        *   Apply during the active growth phase, especially if deficiency symptoms are observed or if soil tests indicate low Boron levels.
    *   **Recommended Dose (Soil Application):** If soil tests indicate severe Boron deficiency, soil application can be considered.
        *   Apply **Disodium tetraborate decahydrate** (Borax) at a rate of **5-10 kg/acre**, mixed with other fertilizers, before planting or as a top dressing. This should be done strictly based on soil test recommendations to avoid Boron toxicity, which can also be detrimental to the crop.

Always ensure proper calibration of spray equipment and uniform application. For any specific concerns or severe deficiency symptoms, it is advisable to conduct a soil test and consult with HAU experts for tailored recommendations.
