As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling sucking pests in Mentha in Haryana:

**Regarding Psylla:**
This is not known to affect Mentha. Psyllids are generally host-specific, and Mentha is not a common host for any significant psyllid pest.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Aphids, Leafhopper, Whitefly, and Thrips in Mentha:**

Effective management of these sucking pests requires an integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods.

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Regular Monitoring:** Frequently inspect your Mentha crop, especially the undersides of leaves and new shoots, to detect pest infestations early. Early detection allows for timely intervention.
*   **Weed Management:** Keep the field free of weeds, as many weeds can serve as alternate hosts for these pests.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush, succulent growth that is highly attractive to sucking pests.
*   **Water Management:** Ensure proper irrigation to avoid water stress, which can make plants more susceptible to pest attack.
*   **Removal of Infested Parts:** If infestations are localized, prune and destroy heavily infested leaves or shoots to reduce pest populations.
*   **Yellow Sticky Traps:** Install yellow sticky traps (15-20 traps per acre) at canopy height to monitor and trap adult whiteflies, leafhoppers, and winged aphids.

**2. Biological Control:**
*   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Protect and encourage beneficial insects such as ladybird beetles, lacewings, hoverfly larvae, and parasitic wasps (e.g., *Aphidius* species for aphids). These natural enemies can significantly suppress pest populations. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm them.
*   **Biopesticides:** In the early stages of infestation, consider using biopesticides based on entomopathogenic fungi like *Beauveria bassiana* or *Verticillium lecanii* (now *Lecanicillium lecanii*), which can be effective against whiteflies, thrips, and aphids.

**3. Chemical Control (Use as a last resort, when pest populations exceed economic thresholds):**
When chemical intervention is necessary, always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance. Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where many of these pests reside. Always strictly observe the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) for Mentha, given its use.

Here are some CIBRC approved technical chemical names effective against these sucking pests:

*   **For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips:**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at 0.5 - 0.75 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at 0.2 - 0.3 g per litre of water.
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply at 0.2 - 0.3 g per litre of water.
    *   **Fipronil 5% SC:** Apply at 1.5 - 2.0 ml per litre of water (particularly effective against thrips and leafhoppers).
    *   **Flonicamid 50% WG:** Apply at 0.3 g per litre of water (highly specific for aphids and whiteflies).
    *   **Diafenthiuron 50% WP:** Apply at 1.0 g per litre of water (effective against whiteflies, thrips, and mites).
    *   **Azadirachtin 1500 ppm:** Apply at 2.5 - 5.0 ml per litre of water (effective as a repellent and growth disruptor, suitable for early infestations and organic farming).

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and strictly follow the label instructions of the specific product you are using, including dosage, application method, safety precautions, and Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI).
*   Apply pesticides during the cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift, reduce evaporation, and maximize efficacy.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer or experts at HAU, Hisar, for the most current and specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and the current pest situation.
