**Regarding "Fruit bursting" and "Hardness in fruit":**
These conditions are not known to affect Mentha (Mint) as it is primarily cultivated for its leaves and essential oil, not for its small, non-commercial fruits (nutlets).

**Regarding "Leaf burning/melting":**
Leaf burning or melting in Mentha is typically a symptom of environmental stress or improper agricultural practices, rather than a disease or pest. It can significantly reduce yield and oil quality.

**Causes of Leaf Burning/Melting:**

*   **Sunscald and Heat Stress:** Intense direct sunlight, especially during peak summer temperatures in Haryana, can cause scorching and burning of leaves, particularly if plants are water-stressed.
*   **Water Stress:** Both insufficient water (drought stress) and excessive water (waterlogging leading to root damage) can impair the plant's ability to regulate temperature and lead to leaf damage.
*   **Chemical Phytotoxicity:** Incorrect application of pesticides (herbicides, insecticides, fungicides) or fertilizers, including wrong dosage, application during high temperatures, or incompatible tank mixes, can cause chemical burns.
*   **Nutrient Imbalance/Toxicity:** Over-application of certain nutrients, particularly nitrogen, can make plants more susceptible to burning.
*   **Wind Burn:** Strong, hot, dry winds can desiccate leaves, leading to a burnt appearance.

**Control Measures for Leaf Burning/Melting:**

**A. Cultural and Agronomic Practices:**

*   **Irrigation Management:**
    *   Maintain consistent soil moisture. Avoid both drought and waterlogging.
    *   Irrigate during the cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize evaporation and reduce the risk of sunscald on wet foliage.
    *   Ensure proper drainage in the field.
*   **Shade Management (during extreme heat):**
    *   In periods of exceptionally high temperatures (e.g., above 40°C) and intense solar radiation, providing temporary partial shade (e.g., 25-30% shade net) can protect young plants or sensitive varieties. However, Mentha generally requires full sun for optimal oil production.
*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Conduct regular soil testing to determine nutrient requirements.
    *   Apply fertilizers based on recommendations. Avoid excessive application of nitrogen, which can lead to lush, tender growth more susceptible to burning.
    *   Ensure balanced nutrition, including micronutrients.
*   **Proper Pesticide and Fertilizer Application:**
    *   Always read and strictly follow label instructions for all agrochemicals regarding dosage, application timing, and safety precautions.
    *   Avoid spraying during peak sunlight hours or when temperatures are very high (typically above 30-32°C), as this increases the risk of phytotoxicity.
    *   Ensure spray equipment is properly calibrated for uniform application.
    *   Check for compatibility before tank-mixing different chemicals.
*   **Weed Control:**
    *   Effectively manage weeds to reduce competition for water and nutrients, thereby reducing plant stress.
*   **Mulching:**
    *   Applying organic mulch (e.g., straw, crop residues) can help regulate soil temperature, conserve soil moisture, and reduce weed growth, contributing to overall plant health and stress tolerance.

**B. Chemical Measures (for Stress Mitigation and Resilience):**

While there are no direct chemical "cures" for already burnt leaves, certain CIBRC-approved technical chemicals can be used as foliar applications to enhance plant resilience against environmental stresses that lead to burning.

*   **Potassium Nitrate:**
    *   Foliar application of **Potassium nitrate** (0.5-1% solution, i.e., 5-10 g/L water or 0.5-1 kg/100 L water) can improve plant tolerance to heat and drought stress by regulating water balance and enhancing physiological processes. Apply during cooler parts of the day.
*   **Potassium Silicate:**
    *   Foliar application of **Potassium silicate** (0.5-1 ml/L or as per product label) can strengthen cell walls, improve cuticle integrity, and enhance tolerance to heat, drought, and UV radiation, thereby reducing the severity of leaf burning.
