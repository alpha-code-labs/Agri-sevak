As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in Mentha in Haryana:

**Borers:**
This is not known to affect Mentha.

**Caterpillars (including cutworms, armyworms, loopers):**
Caterpillars are common defoliators in Mentha. Effective control measures include:
*   **Biological Control:** Application of *Bacillus thuringiensis* (Bt) formulations. This is a safe and effective biological insecticide for caterpillars. Follow manufacturer's recommended dosage, typically around 1-2 kg/acre or 1-2 g/L of water.
*   **Chemical Control (CIBRC approved):**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC at 60 ml/acre.
    *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG at 88 g/acre.
    *   **Indoxacarb** 14.5% SC at 200 ml/acre.
    *   **Flubendiamide** 20% WG at 50 g/acre.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 200-250 ml/acre (Use with caution, considering its broad-spectrum nature and potential impact on beneficial insects. Always observe the pre-harvest interval strictly).

**Diamondback moth (DBM):**
This is not known to affect Mentha. Diamondback moth (*Plutella xylostella*) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower, mustard).

**Leaf folder:**
Leaf folders can cause significant damage by webbing leaves together and feeding inside. Control measures are similar to those for general caterpillars:
*   **Biological Control:** Application of *Bacillus thuringiensis* (Bt) formulations. Follow manufacturer's recommended dosage, typically around 1-2 kg/acre or 1-2 g/L of water.
*   **Chemical Control (CIBRC approved):**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC at 60 ml/acre.
    *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG at 88 g/acre.
    *   **Indoxacarb** 14.5% SC at 200 ml/acre.
    *   **Flubendiamide** 20% WG at 50 g/acre.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 200-250 ml/acre (Use with caution, considering its broad-spectrum nature and potential impact on beneficial insects. Always observe the pre-harvest interval strictly).

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the label instructions for any pesticide product, including dosage, application method, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
*   Regularly scout your fields to detect pest infestations early and apply control measures promptly.
*   Promote natural enemies of pests by minimizing the use of broad-spectrum insecticides.
