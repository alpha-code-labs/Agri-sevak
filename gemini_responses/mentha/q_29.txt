This is not known to affect Mentha.

Mentha (mint) is primarily cultivated for its leaves and essential oil, not for its flowers or fruits. Therefore, "flower drop," "fruit drop," or "boll dropping" are not recognized issues that impact the economic yield of Mentha. The plant's reproductive parts are not the harvested commodity.
