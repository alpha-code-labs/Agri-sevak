Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

The symptom of "Drying up" in Mentha (drying branches, leaves, and flowers) is a general indication of stress, which can be caused by a variety of factors, both abiotic (environmental/cultural) and biotic (diseases/pests). As Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I advise a systematic approach to identify the root cause for effective management.

**I. Abiotic Factors (Environmental and Cultural Stresses):**

These are often the most common causes of widespread drying in Mentha.

1.  **Water Stress:**
    *   **Water Deficit (Under-irrigation):** Insufficient water supply leads to wilting and eventual drying of leaves and branches, especially during hot, dry periods.
    *   **Waterlogging (Over-irrigation):** Excess water in the root zone deprives roots of oxygen, leading to root damage, which mimics drought stress as the plant cannot absorb water effectively. This often leads to yellowing, wilting, and drying.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Ensure proper irrigation scheduling based on soil type, weather conditions, and crop stage. Mentha requires consistent moisture but dislikes waterlogging.
        *   Improve field drainage to prevent water accumulation.

2.  **Nutrient Deficiencies:**
    *   Severe deficiencies of certain nutrients, particularly Potassium (K), can lead to marginal scorching and drying of older leaves. Boron (B) deficiency can affect new growth.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Conduct regular soil testing to determine nutrient status.
        *   Apply balanced fertilizers as per soil test recommendations.

3.  **Heat Stress / Sun Scorch:**
    *   During periods of extreme high temperatures and intense sunlight, especially combined with hot, dry winds (loo), Mentha leaves can suffer from scorching and drying.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Ensure adequate soil moisture during hot periods.
        *   Consider light irrigation during cooler parts of the day to reduce canopy temperature.

4.  **Salinity / Alkalinity:**
    *   High salt concentration in the soil or irrigation water can impede water uptake by roots, leading to symptoms similar to drought stress, including leaf tip burn and general drying.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Get your soil and irrigation water tested for salinity/alkalinity.
        *   Adopt appropriate soil amendments (e.g., gypsum for sodic soils) and leaching practices if recommended.

5.  **Herbicide Drift / Phytotoxicity:**
    *   Accidental exposure to herbicides used in adjacent fields or incorrect application of herbicides in Mentha can cause severe phytotoxicity, leading to yellowing, necrosis, and drying of plant parts.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Exercise extreme caution when applying herbicides in nearby fields to prevent drift.
        *   Always use recommended herbicides at correct dosages for Mentha.

**II. Biotic Factors (Diseases and Pests):**

If abiotic factors are ruled out, consider biotic causes.

1.  **Fungal Root Rot and Wilt Diseases:**
    *   **Causative Agents:** *Rhizoctonia solani*, *Fusarium oxysporum*, and *Pythium* species are common soil-borne fungi that attack Mentha roots and lower stems.
    *   **Symptoms:** Initial yellowing and wilting of leaves, stunting, followed by drying of entire branches or the whole plant. The roots may appear discolored, rotted, or sparse. In wilt diseases, vascular discoloration (browning) may be observed when the stem is cut open.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural:** Use healthy, disease-free planting material. Practice crop rotation with non-host crops. Improve soil drainage. Avoid excessive irrigation.
        *   **Biological:** Apply bio-control agents like *Trichoderma viride* or *Trichoderma harzianum* as a soil application (2.5 kg/acre mixed with 50 kg farmyard manure) or for rhizome treatment.
        *   **Chemical (CIBRC Approved):**
            *   For *Rhizoctonia* and *Fusarium*: Drench the soil around affected plants with a solution of **Carbendazim** (0.5-1 g/L of water) or **Thiophanate Methyl** (0.5-1 g/L of water).
            *   For *Pythium*: Drench the soil around affected plants with **Propamocarb Hydrochloride** (2-3 ml/L of water).

2.  **Nematodes (Root-Knot Nematodes - *Meloidogyne* spp.):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Nematodes damage the root system, impairing water and nutrient uptake. This leads to stunted growth, yellowing, wilting, and eventual drying of the plant, mimicking nutrient deficiency or drought stress. Galls (swellings) on the roots are a characteristic symptom.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops (e.g., cereals). Use solarization during fallow periods.
        *   **Biological:** Apply *Paecilomyces lilacinus* (2.5 kg/acre mixed with 50 kg farmyard manure) as a soil application.
        *   **Chemical (CIBRC Approved):**
            *   Apply **Fluensulfone** granules (10-15 kg/acre) as a pre-plant or at-planting soil application, ensuring proper incorporation.

3.  **Insect Pests:**
    *   While less likely to cause widespread "drying up" of the entire plant, severe infestations of certain pests can lead to localized drying:
        *   **Sucking Pests (Aphids, Thrips, Mites):** Heavy feeding can cause leaves to curl, distort, and eventually dry out, especially new growth.
        *   **Stem Borers:** Larvae boring into stems can disrupt water and nutrient flow, leading to wilting and drying of individual branches above the point of damage.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Regularly monitor your crop for pest presence.
        *   For severe sucking pest infestations, apply **Imidacloprid** (0.2-0.3 ml/L of water) or **Thiamethoxam** (0.2 g/L of water).
        *   For stem borers, if identified, apply **Chlorantraniliprole** (0.3-0.4 ml/L of water).

**III. General Recommendations:**

*   **Field Inspection:** Regularly inspect your Mentha crop for any early signs of stress or disease.
*   **Accurate Diagnosis:** Since "drying up" is a symptom, not a specific disease, accurate diagnosis is crucial. If you are unable to identify the cause, please collect affected plant samples (including roots and surrounding soil) and bring them to the Plant Pathology or Entomology Department at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU), Hisar, for laboratory analysis. Our experts will provide precise recommendations.

By systematically investigating these potential causes, you can effectively address the "drying up" problem in your Mentha crop.
