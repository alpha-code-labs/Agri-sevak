As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), based on current scientific understanding and pest profiles for Mentha in Haryana, Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies are generally not considered significant or common pests that cause economic damage to Mentha crops in the region.

Therefore, specific control measures for these particular pest groups are typically not required.

This is not known to affect Mentha.
