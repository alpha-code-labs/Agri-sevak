As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified fertilizer doses for Mentha cultivation in Haryana. It is always advisable to conduct a soil test to determine specific nutrient deficiencies and tailor the fertilizer application accordingly.

Mentha is a nutrient-intensive crop, especially requiring high amounts of Nitrogen and Potassium, along with adequate Phosphorus and Sulphur for optimal yield and essential oil quality.

**General Nutrient Requirements for Mentha (Mentha arvensis - Japanese Mint):**
*   **Nitrogen (N):** 80-120 kg/acre
*   **Phosphorus (P2O5):** 30-40 kg/acre
*   **Potassium (K2O):** 40-60 kg/acre
*   **Sulphur (S):** 10-20 kg/acre

Based on these requirements, here is a recommended fertilizer schedule:

---

**Recommended Fertilizer Schedule (for a target of 100 kg N, 40 kg P2O5, 50 kg K2O, and 15 kg S per acre):**

**1. Basal Application (at planting of suckers or sprouting of ratoon crop):**
Apply the following fertilizers and thoroughly mix them into the soil before planting or at the time of ratoon crop sprouting.
*   **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP):** 90 kg/acre (Provides ~16.2 kg N and ~41.4 kg P2O5)
*   **Muriate of Potash (MOP):** 85 kg/acre (Provides ~51 kg K2O)
*   **Urea:** 60 kg/acre (Provides ~27.6 kg N)
*   **Elemental Sulphur (90%):** 17 kg/acre (Provides ~15.3 kg S)

**2. Top-dressing (after the first cut, approximately 70-90 days after planting):**
*   **Urea:** 60 kg/acre (Provides ~27.6 kg N)
    *   Apply this dose after the first harvest and ensure light irrigation if the soil is dry.

**3. Second Top-dressing (after the second cut, if applicable, or 30-40 days after the first top-dressing):**
*   **Urea:** 60 kg/acre (Provides ~27.6 kg N)
    *   Apply this dose after the second harvest (if taken) or to support prolonged growth for the second cut.

**Summary of Total Fertilizers Applied (per acre):**
*   **Urea:** 180 kg
*   **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP):** 90 kg
*   **Muriate of Potash (MOP):** 85 kg
*   **Elemental Sulphur (90%):** 17 kg

This schedule provides approximately: 99 kg N, 41.4 kg P2O5, 51 kg K2O, and 15.3 kg S per acre.

**Recommendations for Nano-Urea, Nano-DAP, and NPK (Compound Fertilizers):**

*   **Nano-Urea:**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml/L of water.
    *   **Application:** Foliar spray. It can be used as a supplementary source of Nitrogen, especially during critical growth stages (e.g., 15-20 days after planting/sprouting, and 10-15 days after each cut) to boost growth and improve nutrient use efficiency. It is not a complete replacement for conventional Urea.
    *   **Frequency:** 2-3 sprays per crop cycle, depending on crop vigor and nutrient demand. For a typical spray volume of 200 L/acre, this translates to 400-800 ml of Nano-Urea per acre per spray.

*   **Nano-DAP:**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml/L of water.
    *   **Application:** Foliar spray. It can be used to supplement Phosphorus and Nitrogen, particularly during early vegetative growth or when soil P availability is a concern.
    *   **Frequency:** 1-2 sprays per crop cycle, especially during the initial growth phase (20-30 days after planting/sprouting). For a typical spray volume of 200 L/acre, this translates to 400-800 ml of Nano-DAP per acre per spray.

*   **NPK (Compound Fertilizers):**
    *   If you prefer using compound NPK fertilizers, they can be applied as a basal dose. A common grade like **NPK (12:32:16)** can be used.
    *   **Dose:** To meet the Phosphorus requirement (40 kg P2O5/acre), you would need approximately 125 kg of **NPK (12:32:16)** per acre.
    *   **Adjustments:** If using NPK (12:32:16) at 125 kg/acre, it would provide ~15 kg N, ~40 kg P2O5, and ~20 kg K2O. You would then need to supplement with:
        *   Additional **Muriate of Potash (MOP):** 50 kg/acre (to reach 50 kg K2O total).
        *   Additional **Urea:** Approximately 185 kg/acre (to reach 100 kg N total, split into basal and top-dressings).
        *   **Elemental Sulphur (90%):** 17 kg/acre.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Soil Testing:** Always recommended for precise nutrient management.
*   **Irrigation:** Ensure adequate moisture in the soil after fertilizer application, especially for top-dressing, to facilitate nutrient uptake.
*   **Organic Matter:** Incorporating farmyard manure (FYM) or compost (10-15 tonnes/acre) significantly improves soil health and nutrient availability, reducing reliance on chemical fertilizers.
*   **Micronutrients:** While not explicitly asked, Mentha can benefit from micronutrient application (e.g., Zinc, Boron, Iron) if soil tests indicate deficiencies.
