Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice on addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium) in Mentha (mint) cultivation in Haryana.

The most crucial first step for precise nutrient management is **soil testing**. This will accurately determine the existing nutrient levels in your field and allow for tailored recommendations, preventing over- or under-application.

However, based on common deficiency symptoms, here's how to address them:

### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** General yellowing (chlorosis) of older leaves, stunted growth, thin stems, and reduced leaf size.

**Recommendations:**

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Urea** (46% N) at a rate of 20-30 kg/acre, split into 2-3 applications during the growing season (e.g., after planting/ratooning and subsequent cuts).
*   **Foliar Application (for quick correction):**
    *   Spray a 1-2% solution of **Urea** (10-20 g/L of water) on the foliage. Apply in the evening or early morning to avoid leaf scorch. Repeat after 7-10 days if symptoms persist.

### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Dark green or purplish discoloration of older leaves, stunted root development, delayed maturity, and reduced tillering.

**Recommendations:**

*   **Soil Application (Pre-planting or at planting):**
    *   Apply **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5) at a rate of 40-50 kg/acre.
    *   Alternatively, apply **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5) at a rate of 120-150 kg/acre.
    *   Phosphorus is less mobile in the soil, so it's best incorporated into the soil before or at planting.

### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Yellowing and browning (scorching) of leaf margins, especially on older leaves, weak stems, reduced disease resistance, and poor essential oil quality.

**Recommendations:**

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** (Potassium Chloride, 60% K2O) at a rate of 20-30 kg/acre, split into 1-2 applications during the growing season.
*   **Foliar Application (for quick correction):**
    *   Spray a 1-2% solution of **Potassium Sulphate** (SOP, 50% K2O) (10-20 g/L of water) on the foliage. Apply in the evening or early morning. Repeat after 7-10 days if symptoms persist.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Always aim for balanced nutrition. Over-application of one nutrient can induce deficiencies of others.
*   **Organic Matter:** Incorporating farmyard manure (FYM) or compost can significantly improve soil health, nutrient availability, and water retention.
*   **Irrigation:** Ensure proper irrigation practices, as water stress can exacerbate nutrient deficiency symptoms.
*   **Timing:** Apply fertilizers at appropriate growth stages for maximum uptake and efficiency.

For precise recommendations tailored to your specific field conditions, please bring a soil sample to the HAU Regional Research Station or Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) in your district for analysis.
