Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding soil pests in Mentha cultivation. Termites and root-knot nematodes can significantly impact Mentha yield and quality. Here's a scientifically verified approach for their control:

**General Principles for Soil Pest Management in Mentha:**

1.  **Integrated Pest Management (IPM):** Always prioritize a combination of cultural, biological, and chemical methods for sustainable pest control.
2.  **Soil Testing:** Before planting, conduct a soil test to assess pest load (especially nematodes) and soil health.
3.  **Field Sanitation:** Remove crop residues and weeds that can harbor pests.
4.  **Crop Rotation:** Rotate Mentha with non-host crops (e.g., cereals) to break the pest life cycle, especially for nematodes.

### 1. Control of Termites (Dimag) in Mentha

Termites can damage Mentha roots and underground stems, leading to wilting and plant death. Effective control often involves pre-planting soil treatment.

*   **Pre-planting Soil Treatment:**
    *   Apply **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** at a rate of 2.5 - 4.0 L per acre. Mix the required quantity with 200-400 L of water and drench the soil thoroughly before planting or incorporate it into the soil during the final land preparation.
    *   Alternatively, you can use **Fipronil 0.3% GR** at a rate of 7.5 - 10 kg per acre. Broadcast evenly and incorporate into the soil during the final land preparation. This also offers some control against other soil pests.

*   **Post-planting (if infestation observed):**
    *   Drench the affected areas around the plant base with a solution of **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** at 2.5 ml per liter of water. Ensure the solution reaches the root zone.

### 2. Control of Nematodes (Root-knot Nematodes - *Meloidogyne* spp.) in Mentha

Root-knot nematodes cause galls or knots on the roots, impairing nutrient and water uptake, leading to stunted growth, yellowing, and reduced yield.

*   **Cultural Practices (Highly Recommended):**
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate Mentha with non-host crops like wheat, maize, or sorghum for at least 2-3 years. Avoid continuous cultivation of susceptible crops.
    *   **Summer Ploughing:** Deep ploughing during hot summer months exposes nematode eggs and larvae to the sun, reducing their population.
    *   **Solarization:** Cover the moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks during peak summer to heat the soil and kill nematodes.
    *   **Organic Matter Addition:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost into the soil. This improves soil health and promotes beneficial microorganisms that can suppress nematodes.

*   **Chemical Control (if severe infestation and cultural methods are insufficient):**
    *   **Pre-planting/At Planting Application:**
        *   Apply **Fipronil 0.3% GR** at a rate of 7.5 - 10 kg per acre. Broadcast evenly and incorporate into the soil during the final land preparation or at the time of planting. This provides broad-spectrum soil pest control, including some nematode suppression.
    *   **Post-planting Drenching:**
        *   For targeted control, especially if symptoms appear after planting, drench the soil around the root zone with **Carbosulfan 25% EC** at a rate of 2.0 - 3.0 ml per liter of water. Apply sufficient solution to ensure it reaches the root zone.

**Important Safety Precautions:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, mask, and protective clothing during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Do not eat, drink, or smoke while applying pesticides.
*   Wash hands and exposed skin thoroughly with soap and water after handling pesticides.
*   Store pesticides in a safe, locked place away from children and livestock.
*   Dispose of empty containers safely as per local regulations.
