As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Mentha, keeping in mind CIBRC approved chemicals and practices suitable for Haryana.

It is important to adopt an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, which includes regular field scouting, cultural practices, and judicious use of chemicals only when necessary.

Here's how to control the specified conditions:

### 1. Grasshopper

Grasshoppers are general feeders and can cause damage to Mentha by chewing on leaves and young shoots.

**Cultural Control:**
*   **Deep Ploughing:** After harvest, deep ploughing helps expose grasshopper eggs to predators and adverse weather conditions, reducing the next generation's population.
*   **Weed Management:** Keep the field and surrounding areas free of weeds, as they can serve as alternative food sources and breeding grounds for grasshoppers.

**Chemical Control (for severe infestations):**
*   **Malathion** 50% EC: Apply 1.0 - 1.5 L per acre mixed in 200-400 L of water as a foliar spray.
*   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: Apply 100-120 ml per acre mixed in 200-400 L of water as a foliar spray.
*   **Quinalphos** 25% EC: Apply 500-600 ml per acre mixed in 200-400 L of water as a foliar spray.

### 2. Painted Bug (Bagrada hilaris)

This is not known to affect Mentha. Painted bugs are primarily pests of cruciferous crops (e.g., mustard, cabbage, radish).

### 3. Red Cotton Bug (Dysdercus cingulatus)

This is not known to affect Mentha. Red cotton bugs are primarily pests of cotton and other malvaceous plants, feeding on seeds.

### 4. Black Ants

Black ants are generally not direct pests of Mentha, but they can be a nuisance, protect honeydew-producing pests (like aphids or mealybugs) from natural enemies, or their nesting activity might sometimes disturb roots.

**Cultural Control:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Keep the field clean and free of debris, which can serve as nesting sites for ants.
*   **Control Honeydew-Producing Pests:** If ants are present due to the presence of aphids or mealybugs, focus on controlling these primary pests.

**Chemical Control (If ants are causing significant issues, e.g., protecting other pests or extensive nesting):**
*   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: Apply 2.0 - 2.5 L per acre as a soil drench around ant nests or affected areas.
*   **Fipronil** 0.3% GR: Apply 6.0 - 8.0 kg per acre, broadcast or applied near ant trails/nests.
*   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: Apply 125-150 ml per acre as a soil drench or spot application near nests.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully, including dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) for any applied pesticide to ensure the safety of the harvested Mentha produce.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension officers for the most current and specific recommendations for your region and crop stage.
