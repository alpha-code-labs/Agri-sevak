As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Mentha (Mint) in Haryana.

**General Management Practices for Fungal Diseases in Mentha:**

Before resorting to chemical control, it is crucial to implement good cultural practices:
*   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris to reduce inoculum.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops to break disease cycles.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to improve air circulation and reduce humidity within the canopy.
*   **Irrigation Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day, to minimize leaf wetness periods. Drip irrigation is preferred.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced fertilizers. Excessive nitrogen can make plants more susceptible to some fungal diseases.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available, choose Mentha varieties known for disease resistance.

Here's the specific advice for each disease mentioned:

1.  **Alternaria (Leaf Spot)**
    *   This disease is known to affect Mentha.
    *   **Control:**
        *   **Mancozeb 75% WP:** Apply at 2.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:** Apply at 0.5-1 ml/L of water.

2.  **Anthracnose**
    *   This disease is known to affect Mentha.
    *   **Control:**
        *   **Carbendazim 50% WP:** Apply at 0.5-1 g/L of water.
        *   **Mancozeb 75% WP:** Apply at 2.5 g/L of water.

3.  **Blast**
    *   This is not known to affect Mentha as a specific disease name.

4.  **Blight (e.g., Rhizoctonia Blight, Phytophthora Blight)**
    *   This disease is known to affect Mentha.
    *   **Control:**
        *   For general blight (e.g., *Rhizoctonia*):
            *   **Carbendazim 50% WP:** Apply at 0.5-1 g/L of water.
            *   **Mancozeb 75% WP:** Apply at 2.5 g/L of water.
        *   For oomycete-related blights (e.g., *Phytophthora*):
            *   **Metalaxyl 8% + Mancozeb 64% WP:** Apply at 2.5 g/L of water.
            *   **Dimethomorph 50% WP:** Apply at 0.5-1 g/L of water.

5.  **Brown Spot**
    *   This disease is known to affect Mentha.
    *   **Control:**
        *   **Mancozeb 75% WP:** Apply at 2.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Carbendazim 50% WP:** Apply at 0.5-1 g/L of water.

6.  **Downy Mildew**
    *   This disease is known to affect Mentha.
    *   **Control:**
        *   **Metalaxyl 8% + Mancozeb 64% WP:** Apply at 2.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Dimethomorph 50% WP:** Apply at 0.5-1 g/L of water.
        *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:** Apply at 0.5-1 ml/L of water.

7.  **Powdery Mildew**
    *   This disease is known to affect Mentha.
    *   **Control:**
        *   **Sulphur 80% WP:** Apply at 2-3 g/L of water.
        *   **Propiconazole 25% EC:** Apply at 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:** Apply at 0.5-1 ml/L of water.

8.  **Grey Mildew**
    *   This is not known to affect Mentha as a specific disease name. (Note: If "Grey Mould" caused by *Botrytis cinerea* is intended, please specify).

**Important Considerations for Chemical Application:**

*   **Rotation of Fungicides:** To prevent the development of fungicide resistance, it is crucial to rotate fungicides with different modes of action. Do not use the same chemical repeatedly.
*   **Timing:** Apply fungicides preventively or at the very first signs of disease for best efficacy.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough coverage of all plant parts, especially the undersides of leaves.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always observe the recommended pre-harvest interval (PHI) for each chemical to ensure the safety of the harvested produce.
*   **Safety Precautions:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and application of chemicals.
*   **Consult Local Experts:** For precise recommendations tailored to your specific field conditions and current disease pressure, always consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts.
