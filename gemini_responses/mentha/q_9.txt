Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling mites in Mentha. Both Red spider mite (Tetranychus urticae) and Rust mite (Aculops menthae or similar eriophyid mites) are known to affect Mentha and can cause significant damage if not managed properly.

Here's a comprehensive approach to control mites in Mentha:

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Mites in Mentha:**

1.  **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your Mentha crop, especially the undersides of leaves, for the presence of mites, their eggs, and webbing (for spider mites). Early detection is crucial for effective control.
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Irrigation:** Mites thrive in hot, dry conditions. Ensure adequate irrigation to reduce water stress on plants, which can make them more susceptible. Overhead irrigation can also help dislodge some mites.
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the field free of weeds, as many weeds can act as alternate hosts for mites.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Maintain balanced nutrition. Excessive nitrogen can sometimes lead to lush growth that is more attractive to certain pests.

**Chemical Control (Acaricides):**

When mite populations reach damaging levels, chemical control becomes necessary. Always rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where mites primarily reside.

Here are some CIBRC approved acaricides effective against both Red spider mites and Rust mites:

*   **Spiromesifen** (e.g., 240 SC formulation):
    *   Dosage: 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   Mode of Action: Lipid biosynthesis inhibitor, effective against eggs, nymphs, and adults.

*   **Fenpyroximate** (e.g., 5 SC formulation):
    *   Dosage: 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   Mode of Action: Mitochondrial electron transport inhibitor, acts by contact and stomach action, effective against all stages.

*   **Propargite** (e.g., 57 EC formulation):
    *   Dosage: 1.0 - 1.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   Mode of Action: Non-systemic, contact action, effective against motile stages (nymphs and adults).

*   **Abamectin** (e.g., 1.9 EC formulation):
    *   Dosage: 0.3 - 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   Mode of Action: GABA and glutamate-gated chloride channel activator, translaminar activity, effective against motile stages.

*   **Wettable Sulphur** (e.g., 80 WP formulation):
    *   Dosage: 2.0 - 3.0 grams per litre of water.
    *   Mode of Action: Multi-site contact and fumigant action. Highly effective against rust mites and also provides good control of spider mites and powdery mildew.

**Important Application Guidelines:**

*   **Spray Coverage:** Mites are often found on the undersides of leaves. Use a high-volume sprayer with a fine nozzle to ensure complete coverage of the plant canopy, especially the lower leaf surfaces.
*   **Water Quality:** Use clean water for spraying.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always observe the recommended pre-harvest interval (PHI) for the chosen chemical, especially since Mentha leaves are harvested for oil extraction or direct use. This information is usually provided on the product label.
*   **Resistance Management:** To prevent mites from developing resistance to acaricides, it is crucial to rotate chemicals with different modes of action. Do not use the same chemical repeatedly.
*   **Safety Precautions:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, and protective clothing while handling and spraying pesticides. Follow all instructions and safety guidelines mentioned on the product label.

By combining these cultural practices with judicious and rotational use of CIBRC approved acaricides, you can effectively manage mite populations in your Mentha crop.
