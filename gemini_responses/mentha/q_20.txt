Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I understand the critical role of micronutrients in Mentha cultivation for optimal yield and quality. Addressing these deficiencies effectively requires a scientific approach, starting with proper diagnosis.

**Crucial First Step:**
Before applying any micronutrient, it is highly recommended to conduct a **soil test** and, if possible, a **plant tissue analysis**. This will accurately identify the specific deficiencies and their severity, preventing unnecessary applications and potential toxicities.

Here's how to address the common micronutrient deficiencies in Mentha, using CIBRC approved chemicals and metric units:

### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, small and narrow leaves (little leaf), interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, reduced tillering.
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.5% solution of **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** (5 g/L of water) or 0.1-0.2% solution of **Zinc EDTA** (1-2 g/L of water). Apply 2-3 times at 15-day intervals, starting from 30-45 days after planting/sprouting.
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 10-25 kg/acre of **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** at the time of planting, based on soil test recommendations.

### 2. Iron (Fe) / Ferrous Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Prominent interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on young leaves, while veins remain green. In severe cases, leaves may turn completely yellow or white.
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.5-1.0% solution of **Ferrous Sulphate Heptahydrate** (5-10 g/L of water) or 0.1-0.2% solution of **Iron EDTA** (1-2 g/L of water). Apply 2-3 times at 10-15 day intervals, especially during periods of active growth.
    *   **Soil Application:** For severe cases in alkaline soils, apply 25-50 kg/acre of **Ferrous Sulphate Heptahydrate** before planting, but foliar application is generally more effective for quick correction.

### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, death of growing points, distorted or thickened young leaves, brittle stems, poor root development.
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.1-0.2% solution of **Borax (Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate)** (1-2 g/L of water) or 0.1% solution of **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (1 g/L of water). Apply once or twice during the active growth phase.
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 2-4 kg/acre of **Borax (Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate)** before planting, based on soil test results.

### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Affects new growth, leading to distorted, stunted, or necrotic young leaves, tip burn, weak stems, and poor root development.
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.5-1.0% solution of **Calcium Nitrate** (5-10 g/L of water) or 0.2-0.4% solution of **Calcium Chloride** (2-4 g/L of water). Apply during periods of rapid growth.
    *   **Soil Application:** For general calcium maintenance and soil amendment, apply **Gypsum (Calcium Sulphate)** at 200-500 kg/acre, especially beneficial in sodic soils prevalent in parts of Haryana. This should be done before planting.

### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on older leaves, with veins remaining green. In severe cases, leaves may develop reddish or purplish tints and premature defoliation.
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.5-1.0% solution of **Magnesium Sulphate Heptahydrate** (5-10 g/L of water). Apply 2-3 times at 15-day intervals, targeting older leaves.
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 10-25 kg/acre of **Magnesium Sulphate Heptahydrate** before planting or as a side-dressing, based on soil test.

### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, often with a finer network of green veins compared to iron deficiency. In severe cases, small necrotic spots may appear.
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.5-1.0% solution of **Manganese Sulphate Monohydrate** (5-10 g/L of water). Apply 2-3 times at 15-day intervals during active growth.
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 5-10 kg/acre of **Manganese Sulphate Monohydrate** before planting, but foliar application is generally more efficient for quick correction.

### General Recommendations and Precautions:

*   **Timing of Foliar Sprays:** Apply foliar sprays during the cooler parts of the day (early morning or late afternoon) to maximize absorption and prevent leaf scorch.
*   **Water Quality:** Use clean water for preparing spray solutions.
*   **Adjuvants:** Consider adding a non-ionic spreader/sticker to foliar sprays to improve coverage and absorption.
*   **Compatibility:** Do not mix different micronutrient solutions or micronutrients with other pesticides/fertilizers without checking for compatibility.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management:** Micronutrient application should be part of a holistic nutrient management plan, including balanced application of macronutrients (N, P, K) and organic matter.
*   **HAU Consultation:** For precise recommendations tailored to your specific field conditions, always consult with HAU experts or your local agricultural extension officer with your soil test report.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively manage micronutrient deficiencies in Mentha and ensure healthy, productive crops.
