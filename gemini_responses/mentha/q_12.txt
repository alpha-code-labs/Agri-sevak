Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling Scale insects and Mealybugs in Mentha. These sap-sucking pests can significantly reduce plant vigour and yield if not managed effectively.

An Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is crucial for sustainable control.

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**

*   **Regular Scouting:** Frequently inspect your Mentha plants, especially the undersides of leaves and stem joints, for early signs of these pests.
*   **Pruning:** For localized infestations, prune and destroy heavily infested plant parts to prevent spread.
*   **Water Spray:** A strong jet of water can dislodge mealybugs and some scales, especially on young plants or for light infestations.
*   **Field Hygiene:** Remove weeds and plant debris, which can harbour pests.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, as it can promote lush, succulent growth that is more attractive to sap-sucking pests.

**2. Biological Control:**

*   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Encourage beneficial insects like ladybird beetles, lacewings, and parasitic wasps, which are natural predators and parasitoids of scale insects and mealybugs. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficials.

**3. Chemical Control (Use only CIBRC approved technical chemicals):**

When infestations are severe and cultural/biological methods are insufficient, chemical intervention may be necessary. Ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and stem crevices where these pests hide. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) for Mentha.

*   **For Mealybugs and Scale Insects:**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at a rate of 0.5 - 0.75 ml per litre of water. This is a systemic insecticide that provides good control.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at a rate of 0.2 - 0.3 g per litre of water. Another systemic option effective against sap-sucking pests.
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at a rate of 1.25 - 1.5 ml per litre of water. This is an insect growth regulator, particularly effective against the nymphal stages of mealybugs and scale insects by disrupting their moulting process.
    *   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:** Apply at a rate of 0.75 - 1.0 ml per litre of water. This is a dual-systemic insecticide, moving both upwards and downwards in the plant, providing excellent control of hidden pests.
    *   **Azadirachtin (e.g., 1500 ppm formulation):** Apply at a rate of 3-5 ml per litre of water. This botanical insecticide acts as an anti-feedant and growth disruptor, suitable for early infestations or as part of an organic management strategy.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Spray Adjuvant:** Adding a good quality spreading agent (sticker/spreader) to the spray solution can improve coverage, especially for mealybugs with their waxy coating.
*   **Repeat Application:** A single application may not be sufficient, especially for scale insects which have multiple life stages. Repeat applications at recommended intervals may be necessary, monitoring the pest population closely.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) while handling and spraying chemicals. Store chemicals safely away from children and livestock.

By combining these strategies, you can effectively manage Scale insects and Mealybugs in your Mentha crop. For any further specific queries, please feel free to consult with the Department of Entomology at HAU, Hisar.
