As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified seed and soil treatment processes for Mentha cultivation in Haryana.

It is important to note that commercial Mentha cultivation in Haryana primarily relies on vegetative propagation using suckers/stolons/runners, rather than true seeds. Therefore, the primary focus will be on planting material treatment and soil treatment.

### 1. Planting Material Treatment (for Suckers/Stolons/Runners - Most Common)

This treatment aims to protect the planting material from soil-borne diseases and nematodes during establishment.

*   **Fungicidal Dip:**
    *   Prepare a solution by mixing **Carbendazim** 12% SC @ 1 ml/L or **Carbendazim** 50% WP @ 1 g/L along with **Mancozeb** 75% WP @ 2 g/L of water.
    *   Dip the Mentha suckers/stolons in this solution for 15-30 minutes before planting.
*   **Bio-fungicidal Dip:**
    *   Alternatively, or in addition to chemical treatment, prepare a slurry of **Trichoderma viride** (1-2% WP) @ 5-10 g/L of water.
    *   Dip the suckers/stolons in this slurry for 15-30 minutes before planting. This promotes early root development and provides protection against soil-borne pathogens.

### 2. Seed Treatment (If True Seeds are Used - Less Common Commercially)

If true Mentha seeds are used for propagation, the following treatments are recommended to protect against seed-borne and early soil-borne diseases (e.g., damping-off, seedling blight).

*   **Fungicidal Treatment:**
    *   Treat seeds with **Carbendazim** 50% WP @ 2-3 g/kg of seed, or **Thiram** 75% WS @ 2-3 g/kg of seed.
    *   Mix the chemical thoroughly with the seeds just before sowing.
*   **Bio-fungicidal Treatment:**
    *   Treat seeds with **Trichoderma viride** (1-2% WP) @ 5-10 g/kg of seed.
    *   Mix the bio-agent thoroughly with the seeds, preferably after chemical treatment (if both are used), or as a standalone treatment.

### 3. Soil Treatment (Pre-planting)

Soil treatment is crucial for managing soil-borne diseases, nematodes, and soil insect pests, ensuring a healthy environment for Mentha growth.

*   **For Soil-borne Diseases (e.g., Wilt, Root Rot):**
    *   **Bio-agent Application:**
        *   Mix **Trichoderma viride** (1-2% WP) @ 2-4 kg/acre with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost.
        *   Keep the mixture under shade for 7-10 days, ensuring adequate moisture, then broadcast evenly over the field and incorporate into the soil 7-10 days before planting.
        *   Similarly, **Pseudomonas fluorescens** (1% WP) @ 2-4 kg/acre can be applied with FYM/compost.
    *   **Fungicidal Drench (if disease history is severe):**
        *   After planting, if symptoms of soil-borne diseases appear, drench the soil around the plants with **Carbendazim** 50% WP @ 1-2 g/L of water, or **Propiconazole** 25% EC @ 1 ml/L of water. Ensure adequate moisture in the soil before drenching.
*   **For Nematodes (if present):**
    *   **Granular Application:**
        *   Apply **Fipronil** 0.3% GR @ 10-15 kg/acre at the time of planting or before, by broadcasting and incorporating into the soil. This also helps in managing some soil insects.
*   **For Soil Insect Pests (e.g., Termites, Cutworms):**
    *   **Granular Application:**
        *   Apply **Fipronil** 0.3% GR @ 10-15 kg/acre or **Cartap Hydrochloride** 4% GR @ 10 kg/acre at the time of planting, by broadcasting and incorporating into the soil.
    *   **Drench Application:**
        *   If termites or cutworms are a known problem, drench the soil with **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC @ 2-4 L/acre mixed with irrigation water or applied as a drench before planting.

Always ensure proper safety measures, wear protective gear, and follow the instructions on the product labels for dosage and application. Regular monitoring of the crop for pest and disease incidence is crucial for timely intervention.
