As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following cultivation practices for Mentha, based on scientific research and local conditions in Haryana:

**Recommended Cultivation Practices for Mentha:**

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   Mentha is primarily propagated vegetatively using suckers/stolons (underground stems) or rooted cuttings, as seed propagation is not commercially viable due to genetic variability.
    *   The most common method involves planting suckers/stolons in furrows.
    *   The field should be well-prepared with fine tilth. Furrows are opened at the recommended spacing.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   Suckers/stolons should be planted shallowly, typically at a depth of 4-5 cm below the soil surface. Ensure they are adequately covered with soil.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   **Row-to-Row:** 45-60 cm. A spacing of 60 cm is often preferred for ease of inter-cultivation and mechanical operations.
    *   **Plant-to-Plant:** When planting individual suckers/stolons, a spacing of 10-15 cm within the row is ideal. Alternatively, stolons can be placed end-to-end continuously in the furrow for a dense stand.

*   **Planting Material Dose (Stolon Dose):**
    *   For establishing a new Mentha field, approximately 400-500 kg of healthy, disease-free suckers/stolons are required per acre (equivalent to 10-12.5 quintals per hectare). This ensures a good plant stand and optimal yield.
