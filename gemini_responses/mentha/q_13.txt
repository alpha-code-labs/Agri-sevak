As a Senior Agronomist, I can confirm that **Fruit fly** and **Ber fly** are not known to affect Mentha (mint).

*   **Fruit flies** (Tephritidae family) primarily infest fruits of various horticultural crops. Mentha is grown for its leaves and essential oil, not for its fruit, and is not a host for economically significant fruit fly damage.
*   **Ber fly** (*Carpomyia vesuviana*) is a highly specific pest that exclusively infests the fruits of Ber (*Ziziphus mauritiana*). It does not infest Mentha.
