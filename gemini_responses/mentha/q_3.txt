Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the critical importance of managing rot diseases in Mentha (mint) cultivation for our farmers in Haryana. Rot diseases can significantly impact yield and quality.

Let's address your query regarding the control of various rot types in Mentha:

Firstly, regarding **Fruit Rot**: This is not known to affect Mentha, as Mentha is primarily cultivated for its leaves and essential oil, not for its fruit.

For the other rot types – **Root Rot, Stem Rot, Foot Rot, Collar Rot, Crown Rot, Neck Rot, Black Rot, Seed Rot, and Seedling Rot** – these are common issues in Mentha and are often caused by a complex of soil-borne fungal pathogens such as *Rhizoctonia solani*, *Pythium* spp., *Phytophthora* spp., and *Fusarium* spp. Effective control requires an integrated approach.

Here's a comprehensive strategy:

**I. Integrated Management Strategy for Rot Diseases in Mentha:**

**A. Cultural and Agronomic Practices (Prevention is Key):**

1.  **Use Healthy Planting Material:** Always use disease-free stolons/suckers for propagation. If using seeds, ensure they are certified and treated.
2.  **Crop Rotation:** Avoid continuous cultivation of Mentha or other susceptible crops in the same field. Rotate with non-host crops like cereals (wheat, maize) for at least 2-3 years.
3.  **Soil Drainage:** Ensure excellent field drainage. Prepare raised beds in areas prone to waterlogging, as excessive moisture favors the development of most rot pathogens.
4.  **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced fertilizers. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can lead to lush, soft growth more susceptible to disease.
5.  **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris from the field to reduce inoculum sources.
6.  **Proper Spacing:** Maintain optimal plant spacing to ensure good air circulation, which helps in reducing humidity around the plant base.
7.  **Deep Ploughing/Solarization:** Deep ploughing during summer can expose soil-borne pathogens to sunlight, reducing their population. Soil solarization (covering moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets during hot months) can also be effective in reducing pathogen load.

**B. Biological Control:**

1.  **Trichoderma Application:** Apply bio-fungicides containing *Trichoderma viride* or *Trichoderma harzianum* to the soil.
    *   **Soil Application:** Mix 2.5 kg of *Trichoderma viride* formulation (1x10^8 CFU/g) with 50 kg of farmyard manure (FYM) or compost, and apply per acre before planting or as a drench around established plants.
    *   **Stolon/Seed Treatment:** Treat stolons or seeds with *Trichoderma viride* @ 10 g/kg of planting material before sowing/planting.

**C. Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved Fungicides):**

Chemical control should be used judiciously and as part of an integrated approach, especially when disease pressure is high or for preventive measures.

1.  **For Stolon/Seed Treatment (Preventive for Seed Rot and Seedling Rot):**
    *   **Carbendazim** @ 1-2 g/kg of stolons/seeds.
    *   **Thiophenate methyl** @ 1-2 g/kg of stolons/seeds.
    *   **Metalaxyl** (as a component of a combination product, e.g., Metalaxyl + Mancozeb) @ 2-2.5 g/kg of stolons/seeds.

2.  **For Soil Drench/Field Application (For Root, Stem, Collar, Crown, Foot, Neck, Black Rot):**
    *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride** @ 2-3 ml/L of water, applied as a drench around the base of the plants (200-250 ml solution per plant, depending on plant size and disease severity).
    *   **Metalaxyl** (often in combination with Mancozeb) @ 2-2.5 g/L of water, applied as a soil drench. This is particularly effective against Oomycete pathogens like *Pythium* and *Phytophthora*.
    *   **Carbendazim** @ 1-2 g/L of water, applied as a soil drench. Effective against *Rhizoctonia* and *Fusarium*.
    *   **Thiophenate methyl** @ 1-1.5 g/L of water, applied as a soil drench. Similar efficacy to Carbendazim.
    *   **Validamycin** @ 2-3 ml/L of water, applied as a soil drench, specifically effective against *Rhizoctonia solani*.
    *   **Azoxystrobin** @ 0.5-1 ml/L of water, applied as a soil drench. This is a broad-spectrum fungicide effective against a range of fungal pathogens.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Diagnosis:** Accurate diagnosis of the specific pathogen causing the rot is crucial for selecting the most effective chemical control.
*   **Timing:** Apply fungicides preventively or at the very early stages of disease development for best results.
*   **Rotation of Chemicals:** To prevent the development of fungicide resistance, rotate fungicides with different modes of action.
*   **Safety:** Always follow the manufacturer's instructions, wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), and observe pre-harvest intervals (PHI).

By implementing these integrated strategies, our Mentha farmers in Haryana can effectively manage and control various rot diseases, ensuring healthy crops and good yields. For specific field conditions and further guidance, please consult with the plant pathology experts at HAU, Hisar.
