As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following for the ideal transplantation of BAJRA NAPIER HYBRID in Haryana:

**1. Ideal Transplantation Time:**
The most suitable times for transplanting Bajra Napier Hybrid in Haryana are:
*   **Monsoon Season:** July to August, when sufficient moisture is available and temperatures are conducive for establishment.
*   **Spring Season:** February to March, provided adequate irrigation facilities are available for initial establishment.

**2. Ideal Transplantation Distance:**
For optimal fodder yield and plant vigor, the recommended spacing is:
*   **Row to Row:** 60 cm
*   **Plant to Plant:** 60 cm

This spacing allows for good tillering, adequate light penetration, and ease of intercultural operations.

**3. Ideal Transplantation Process:**

*   **Land Preparation:**
    *   Plough the field thoroughly to a depth of 20-25 cm, followed by 2-3 harrowings to achieve a fine tilth.
    *   Level the field to ensure uniform irrigation and drainage.
    *   Incorporate 10-15 tonnes per acre of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost during the last ploughing.

*   **Preparation of Planting Material:**
    *   **Rooted Slips:** These are the most preferred planting material. Obtain rooted slips from the base of 2-3 month old healthy, mature clumps. Each slip should have 2-3 tillers and a good root system.
    *   **Stem Cuttings:** Alternatively, use stem cuttings from healthy, mature plants. Each cutting should be 20-30 cm long with 2-3 nodes.

*   **Planting Method:**
    *   Mark the field at the recommended spacing (60 cm x 60 cm).
    *   Dig small pits or make furrows at the marked spots.
    *   **For Rooted Slips:** Plant the slips upright in the pits/furrows, ensuring the crown is at soil level and roots are well covered.
    *   **For Stem Cuttings:** Plant the cuttings at an angle, burying two-thirds of the cutting in the soil, leaving at least one node above the ground.
    *   Ensure firm soil compaction around the planted material to establish good soil-to-root contact and remove air pockets.

*   **Initial Irrigation:**
    *   Immediately after planting, provide light irrigation to help in the establishment of the slips/cuttings. This is crucial for survival and early growth.

*   **Basal Fertilizer Application (General Recommendation):**
    *   Apply a basal dose of fertilizers at the time of planting or just before, based on soil test recommendations. A general recommendation for establishment is:
        *   Nitrogen (N): 20-25 kg per acre (e.g., through Urea)
        *   Phosphorus (P): 20-25 kg per acre (e.g., through Diammonium Phosphate or Single Superphosphate)
        *   Potassium (K): 10-15 kg per acre (e.g., through Muriate of Potash)

*   **Weed Management:**
    *   Keep the field free from weeds, especially during the initial establishment phase, as weeds compete for nutrients and moisture. Manual weeding or appropriate herbicide application (if necessary and approved) can be done.
