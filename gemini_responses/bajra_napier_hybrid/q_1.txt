As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding smut diseases in Bajra Napier Hybrid:

*   **Black Smut:** This is not known to affect BAJRA NAPIER HYBRID.
*   **False Smut:** This is not known to affect BAJRA NAPIER HYBRID.
*   **Kernel Smut:** This is not known to affect BAJRA NAPIER HYBRID.
*   **Loose Smut:** This is not known to affect BAJRA NAPIER HYBRID.

Bajra Napier Hybrid is primarily cultivated for fodder and is typically harvested before flowering. Smut diseases primarily affect the reproductive parts (heads/grains) of the plant. Therefore, these diseases are generally not considered economically significant for Bajra Napier Hybrid fodder production, and specific chemical control measures are not typically recommended or applied.
