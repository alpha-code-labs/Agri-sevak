As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified seed and soil treatment processes for BAJRA NAPIER HYBRID, keeping in mind the common challenges faced in Haryana:

### Seed Treatment Process

Seed treatment is crucial for protecting young seedlings from seed-borne and early soil-borne diseases, improving germination, and enhancing early plant vigor.

*   **Objective:** Protection against Downy Mildew, Smuts, and other seed-borne fungal pathogens, and promotion of early growth.

*   **Recommended Treatments:**
    *   **Fungicidal Treatment (Essential for Downy Mildew Management):**
        *   Treat seeds with **Metalaxyl** 35% WS @ 6 grams per kilogram of seed. This is highly effective against Downy Mildew (Sclerospora graminicola), a major disease of pearl millet and its hybrids.
        *   Alternatively, or in addition for broader spectrum protection against other seed-borne fungi and smuts, treat with **Carbendazim** 50% WP @ 2 grams per kilogram of seed OR **Thiram** 75% WS @ 2.5 grams per kilogram of seed.
    *   **Bio-fungicidal Treatment:**
        *   After chemical treatment (or as a standalone organic option), treat seeds with **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum** @ 5-10 grams per kilogram of seed. This helps in suppressing various soil-borne fungal pathogens and promotes root development.
    *   **Bio-fertilizer Treatment:**
        *   Treat seeds with **Azotobacter** and **PSB (Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria)** @ 20 grams per kilogram of seed each. These bio-fertilizers help in nitrogen fixation and phosphorus solubilization, enhancing nutrient availability to the young plants.

### Soil Treatment Process

Soil treatment aims to manage soil-borne pests and diseases, improve soil health, and enhance nutrient availability for sustained growth of BAJRA NAPIER HYBRID.

*   **Objective:** Management of soil-borne insect pests (e.g., white grubs, termites), nematodes, root rot diseases, and improvement of soil fertility.

*   **Recommended Treatments:**
    *   **For Soil-borne Insect Pests (White Grubs, Termites - if prevalent):**
        *   Apply **Fipronil** 0.3% GR @ 10-15 kilograms per acre at the time of sowing/planting, incorporating it into the soil.
        *   Alternatively, **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC @ 2-4 litres per acre can be applied as a drench or mixed with irrigation water before planting.
    *   **For Soil-borne Diseases (Root Rots) and Nematodes:**
        *   Apply **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum** @ 2.5 kilograms per acre, mixed thoroughly with 50-100 kilograms of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost, and broadcasted evenly before planting.
        *   Incorporate **Neem cake** @ 200-400 kilograms per acre into the soil before planting. Neem cake acts as an organic amendment, provides nutrients, and possesses nematicidal and insecticidal properties.
    *   **Bio-fertilizer Application (for general soil health and nutrient availability):**
        *   Apply **Azotobacter** and **PSB (Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria)** @ 2.5 kilograms per acre each, mixed with 50-100 kilograms of FYM or compost, and broadcasted before planting. These enhance nitrogen fixation and phosphorus availability in the root zone.

**Note:** Always ensure proper soil moisture for effective seed and soil treatment applications. Integrated Pest and Nutrient Management (IPNM) practices, including regular soil testing and crop rotation, are highly recommended for sustainable production of BAJRA NAPIER HYBRID.
