As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I advise on addressing micronutrient deficiencies in Bajra Napier Hybrid. It is crucial to conduct a comprehensive soil test to accurately diagnose deficiencies and determine the precise nutrient requirements for your specific field conditions. Visual symptoms can be indicative, but soil testing provides scientific validation.

Here's how to address common micronutrient deficiencies:

### General Recommendations:
*   **Soil Testing:** Always begin with a soil test to confirm the deficiency and determine the extent.
*   **Foliar Application:** Often preferred for quick correction of micronutrient deficiencies, especially during active growth stages, as it allows for direct absorption by leaves.
*   **Timing:** Apply foliar sprays during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to maximize absorption and minimize leaf scorching. Ensure good spray coverage.

### Specific Micronutrient Deficiencies and Their Management:

#### 1. Zinc (Zn)
*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, often with white bands on either side of the midrib, especially on the lower half of the leaf.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   **Zinc sulfate heptahydrate** (21% Zn) @ 0.5% solution (5 g/L water).
        *   **Zinc EDTA** (12% Zn) @ 0.1% solution (1 g/L water).
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals during the active growth phase.
    *   **Soil Application (for severe or persistent deficiency):**
        *   **Zinc sulfate heptahydrate** (21% Zn) @ 25 kg/acre, applied as a basal dose once every 2-3 years based on soil test recommendations.

#### 2. Iron (Fe) / Ferrous
*   **Symptoms:** Severe interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, which can progress to almost white leaves in severe cases. Growth is often stunted.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   **Ferrous sulfate heptahydrate** (19% Fe) @ 0.5% solution (5 g/L water).
        *   **Iron EDTA** (12% Fe) @ 0.1% solution (1 g/L water).
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 7-10 day intervals until symptoms disappear.

#### 3. Boron (B)
*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, thickening and brittleness of young leaves, death of growing points, and sometimes poor development of new shoots.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (20% B) @ 0.1% solution (1 g/L water).
        *   **Borax** (10.5-11.3% B) @ 0.2% solution (2 g/L water).
        *   Apply 1-2 sprays during the active growth period.
    *   **Soil Application (for severe deficiency, use with caution as Boron can be toxic in excess):**
        *   **Borax** (10.5-11.3% B) @ 2-4 kg/acre, once every 3-4 years, based on soil test.

#### 4. Calcium (Ca)
*   **Symptoms:** Death of growing points, distorted and curled new leaves, water-soaked appearance of young tissues, and poor root development.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   **Calcium chloride** (27% Ca) @ 0.5% solution (5 g/L water).
        *   **Calcium nitrate** (19% Ca) @ 0.5% solution (5 g/L water).
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals during active growth.
    *   **Soil Application (if soil pH is low or severe deficiency):**
        *   **Gypsum** (Calcium sulfate dihydrate) or **Calcium carbonate** as per soil test recommendations to improve soil calcium levels and pH if needed.

#### 5. Magnesium (Mg)
*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, starting from the leaf margins and progressing inwards, often giving a "Christmas tree" pattern. Leaves may become brittle.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   **Magnesium sulfate heptahydrate** (9.6% Mg) @ 0.5-1% solution (5-10 g/L water).
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals.
    *   **Soil Application (for severe deficiency or long-term management):**
        *   **Magnesium sulfate heptahydrate** @ 10-20 kg/acre, applied as a basal dose.
        *   If soil pH is low, **Dolomite** (Calcium magnesium carbonate) can be used as per soil test.

#### 6. Manganese (Mn)
*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, similar to iron deficiency but often accompanied by small necrotic (dead) spots. Growth can be stunted.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   **Manganese sulfate monohydrate** (30.5% Mn) @ 0.2-0.5% solution (2-5 g/L water).
        *   **Manganese EDTA** (12% Mn) @ 0.1% solution (1 g/L water).
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals during active growth.
    *   **Soil Application (less efficient in alkaline soils):**
        *   **Manganese sulfate monohydrate** @ 5-10 kg/acre, applied as a basal dose.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always use clean water for spraying.
*   Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage for foliar applications.
*   Avoid applying chemicals in strong sunlight or when rain is expected shortly after.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for precise recommendations tailored to your specific field conditions and soil test results.
