As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I must clarify that "Drying up" as a specific named disease, pest, or condition is **not known to affect BAJRA NAPIER HYBRID**.

However, the symptoms you describe (drying branches, leaves, and potentially flowers) indicate general plant stress or an underlying issue that needs to be diagnosed. For a fodder crop like Bajra Napier Hybrid, "drying up" of fruits is not a typical concern as it is primarily grown for its vegetative biomass.

To address these symptoms, a thorough field inspection is crucial to identify the exact cause. Here are the common reasons for such symptoms in Bajra Napier Hybrid and their management strategies:

**I. Abiotic Stresses (Non-living factors):**

1.  **Water Stress (Drought or Waterlogging):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Leaves turn yellow, wilt, and eventually dry up. In severe drought, entire plants may dry. Waterlogging can also cause root damage leading to similar symptoms.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Drought:** Ensure timely and adequate irrigation, especially during critical growth stages. Bajra Napier Hybrid is relatively drought-tolerant, but prolonged dry spells will cause stress.
        *   **Waterlogging:** Improve drainage in the field. Avoid planting in low-lying areas prone to water accumulation.

2.  **Nutrient Deficiencies:**
    *   **Symptoms:** General yellowing, stunted growth, and premature drying of older leaves (e.g., nitrogen deficiency) or specific discoloration patterns.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Conduct soil testing to determine nutrient status.
        *   Apply balanced fertilizers as per HAU recommendations for fodder crops. For Bajra Napier Hybrid, typical recommendations include:
            *   Nitrogen: 100-120 kg/acre (in splits).
            *   Phosphorus: 40-60 kg/acre.
            *   Potash: 40 kg/acre.
        *   Foliar application of micronutrients if specific deficiencies are identified.

3.  **Heat Stress/Sun Scorch:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Leaves may show scorching, browning, and drying, especially on exposed parts during intense summer heat.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Ensure adequate soil moisture to help plants cope with high temperatures.
        *   Maintain optimal plant density to provide some self-shading.

4.  **Soil Salinity/Alkalinity:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, marginal leaf burn, and premature drying, as high salts impair water uptake.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Conduct soil analysis for pH and electrical conductivity (EC).
        *   Apply gypsum for alkaline soils.
        *   Leaching with good quality water (if available and drainage is good).
        *   Use salt-tolerant varieties if the problem is severe.

**II. Biotic Stresses (Living organisms):**

1.  **Root Rot / Collar Rot (Fungal Diseases):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Plants wilt suddenly, turn yellow, and dry up. The base of the stem (collar region) or roots may show discoloration, rotting, or lesions.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural Practices:** Improve drainage, avoid mechanical injury to roots/stems, and practice crop rotation.
        *   **Chemical Control (Preventive/Early Stage):**
            *   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds with **Carbendazim** (50% WP) at 2 g/kg seed or **Thiram** (75% WS) at 2.5 g/kg seed.
            *   **Soil Drench:** In affected patches, drench the soil around the plant with **Carbendazim** (50% WP) at 1 g/L water.

2.  **Stem Borers (e.g., Chilo partellus):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Young plants show "dead heart" (central shoot dries up). Older plants may have boreholes on stems, and affected tillers or parts of the stem may dry up.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural Practices:** Remove and destroy affected plants/stubble. Practice timely sowing.
        *   **Chemical Control (if infestation is severe and crop stage permits):**
            *   Apply granular insecticides in the leaf whorl:
                *   **Fipronil** (0.3% GR) at 6-8 kg/acre.
                *   **Cartap Hydrochloride** (4% GR) at 7.5 kg/acre.
            *   *Note: For fodder crops, always consider the harvest interval and residue limits before applying chemicals.*

**Recommendation:**

It is strongly advised to bring a sample of the affected plant to the Plant Pathology or Entomology department at HAU, Hisar, or your nearest Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) for accurate diagnosis. This will ensure the most effective and targeted management strategy.
