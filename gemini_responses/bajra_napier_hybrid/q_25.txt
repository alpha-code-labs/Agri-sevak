As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for irrigation management in Bajra Napier Hybrid (BNH) in Haryana:

Bajra Napier Hybrid is a high-yielding perennial fodder crop that requires adequate moisture for optimal growth and multiple cuts throughout its productive life. Efficient irrigation management is crucial for maximizing fodder yield and water use efficiency, especially in the climatic conditions of Haryana.

### **Irrigation Management for Bajra Napier Hybrid**

**1. First Irrigation:**
The first irrigation is critical for the successful establishment of Bajra Napier Hybrid.
*   **Timing:**
    *   **Immediately after planting:** Whether planting rooted slips, stem cuttings, or seedlings, a light and uniform irrigation should be applied immediately after planting. This ensures good soil-to-root contact and helps in the initial establishment of the plant.
    *   **Within 24 hours:** If planting is done in dry soil, irrigation must be provided within 24 hours to prevent desiccation of the planting material.
*   **Quantity:** Apply sufficient water to thoroughly wet the root zone (top 10-15 cm of soil) without causing waterlogging or runoff. Approximately 30-40 mm of water is generally adequate for the first irrigation, depending on soil type.

**2. Second and Subsequent Irrigations:**
The timing and frequency of subsequent irrigations depend on soil type, prevailing weather conditions, and the crop's growth stage.
*   **Second Irrigation:**
    *   **Timing:** Typically, the second irrigation is required 7-10 days after the first irrigation, especially in sandy loam soils common in Haryana. In heavier soils, it might be delayed slightly, while in very sandy soils, it might be needed sooner.
    *   **Assessment:** Always check soil moisture before irrigating. If the soil feels dry at a depth of 5-10 cm, irrigation is needed.
*   **Subsequent Irrigations:**
    *   **Frequency:** During the peak growth periods (summer months, March to October), Bajra Napier Hybrid requires frequent irrigation, generally every 10-15 days. During cooler months or if there is sufficient rainfall, the frequency can be reduced.
    *   **Critical Stages:** Irrigation is particularly important after each cut to promote rapid and vigorous regrowth.
    *   **Quantity:** Each irrigation should aim to replenish the soil moisture in the active root zone. Typically, 50-70 mm (5-7 cm) of water per irrigation is recommended, depending on the soil type and evapotranspiration rates.
    *   **Indicators:** Visual wilting of leaves in the morning hours is a clear sign of water stress, indicating an immediate need for irrigation.

**3. Sprinkler Use:**
Sprinkler irrigation is highly recommended for Bajra Napier Hybrid in Haryana due to its numerous advantages, especially in water-scarce regions.
*   **Advantages:**
    *   **High Water Use Efficiency:** Sprinklers significantly reduce water losses due to deep percolation and surface runoff compared to flood irrigation, leading to more efficient water utilization.
    *   **Uniform Water Distribution:** Provides a more uniform application of water across the field, ensuring consistent moisture availability to all plants and promoting even growth.
    *   **Suitable for Undulating Terrain:** Can be effectively used on uneven or sloping lands where flood irrigation is difficult or impractical.
    *   **Soil Conservation:** Reduces soil erosion by applying water gently, preventing the formation of crusts and maintaining soil structure.
    *   **Fertigation Capability:** Allows for the application of water-soluble fertilizers along with irrigation water (fertigation), improving nutrient use efficiency and reducing labor.
    *   **Adaptability to Soil Types:** Particularly beneficial for sandy soils with high infiltration rates, preventing excessive water loss.
*   **Recommendations for BNH with Sprinklers:**
    *   **System Type:** Portable or semi-permanent sprinkler systems are suitable. Micro-sprinklers or mini-sprinklers can also be considered for precise application.
    *   **Scheduling:** Irrigation scheduling should be based on crop evapotranspiration (ETc) and soil moisture monitoring. A common practice is to irrigate when 30-40% of the available soil moisture in the root zone has been depleted.
    *   **Application Rate:** Ensure the sprinkler application rate matches the infiltration rate of your soil to prevent runoff.
    *   **Timing:** Irrigate during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize evaporative losses from the spray.

By adopting these irrigation management practices, especially incorporating efficient methods like sprinklers, farmers can achieve higher fodder yields from Bajra Napier Hybrid while conserving precious water resources in Haryana.
