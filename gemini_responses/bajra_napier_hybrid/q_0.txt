As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Bajra Napier Hybrid in Haryana:

Effective management of fungal diseases in Bajra Napier Hybrid requires an integrated approach combining cultural practices with timely and appropriate chemical interventions.

**General Cultural Practices for Disease Management:**

*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available, choose disease-resistant or tolerant Bajra Napier Hybrid varieties.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate with non-host crops to break disease cycles.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris to reduce inoculum sources.
*   **Optimum Plant Spacing:** Ensure adequate spacing for good air circulation, which reduces humidity and fungal growth.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can make plants more susceptible to certain diseases. Ensure adequate potassium and phosphorus.
*   **Weed Control:** Manage weeds, as they can act as alternate hosts for pathogens.
*   **Irrigation Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation late in the day, which can prolong leaf wetness. Irrigate in the morning to allow foliage to dry quickly.

**Specific Control Measures for Fungal Diseases:**

1.  **Alternaria Leaf Spot:**
    This disease is known to affect Bajra Napier Hybrid. Symptoms include small, dark, circular to irregular spots on leaves, which may enlarge and coalesce.
    *   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
        *   **Mancozeb** 2.0-2.5 g/L of water (or 2.0-2.5 kg/acre)
        *   **Propiconazole** 1.0 ml/L of water (or 200-300 ml/acre)
        *   **Azoxystrobin** 0.5 ml/L of water (or 100-150 ml/acre)

2.  **Anthracnose:**
    This disease is known to affect Bajra Napier Hybrid. It causes water-soaked lesions that turn brown to black, often with a purplish margin, on leaves, stems, and sometimes heads.
    *   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
        *   **Carbendazim** 0.5 g/L of water (or 100-150 g/acre)
        *   **Propiconazole** 1.0 ml/L of water (or 200-300 ml/acre)
        *   **Azoxystrobin** 0.5 ml/L of water (or 100-150 ml/acre)

3.  **Blast:**
    This disease is known to affect Bajra Napier Hybrid. It causes spindle-shaped lesions with grey centers and dark brown margins on leaves, often leading to significant yield loss.
    *   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
        *   **Propiconazole** 1.0 ml/L of water (or 200-300 ml/acre)
        *   **Azoxystrobin** 0.5 ml/L of water (or 100-150 ml/acre)
        *   **Tricyclazole** 0.6 g/L of water (or 120-180 g/acre)

4.  **Blight (General Leaf Blight):**
    Various blight diseases are known to affect Bajra Napier Hybrid, causing large, irregular necrotic lesions on leaves, leading to defoliation.
    *   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
        *   **Mancozeb** 2.0-2.5 g/L of water (or 2.0-2.5 kg/acre)
        *   **Propiconazole** 1.0 ml/L of water (or 200-300 ml/acre)
        *   **Azoxystrobin** 0.5 ml/L of water (or 100-150 ml/acre)

5.  **Brown Spot:**
    This disease is known to affect Bajra Napier Hybrid. It typically causes small, circular to oval brown spots on leaves, which can enlarge and coalesce under severe conditions.
    *   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
        *   **Mancozeb** 2.0-2.5 g/L of water (or 2.0-2.5 kg/acre)
        *   **Propiconazole** 1.0 ml/L of water (or 200-300 ml/acre)
        *   **Azoxystrobin** 0.5 ml/L of water (or 100-150 ml/acre)

6.  **Downy Mildew:**
    This is a major disease known to affect Bajra Napier Hybrid. Symptoms include chlorotic streaks on leaves, often with a downy growth on the underside, leading to shredding of leaves and malformation of inflorescences.
    *   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
        *   **Metalaxyl + Mancozeb** (combination product) 2.0-2.5 g/L of water (or 2.0-2.5 kg/acre)
        *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride** 2.5 ml/L of water (or 500-750 ml/acre)
    *   **Seed Treatment (Preventive):**
        *   **Metalaxyl** 6 g/kg of seed (for initial protection against systemic infection)

7.  **Powdery Mildew:**
    This disease is known to affect Bajra Napier Hybrid, though less common as a major issue compared to downy mildew. It appears as white, powdery patches on the surface of leaves and stems.
    *   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
        *   **Sulphur** (Wettable Powder) 2.0-3.0 g/L of water (or 2.0-3.0 kg/acre)
        *   **Propiconazole** 1.0 ml/L of water (or 200-300 ml/acre)
        *   **Azoxystrobin** 0.5 ml/L of water (or 100-150 ml/acre)

8.  **Grey Mildew:**
    This is not known to affect BAJRA NAPIER HYBRID.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label for correct dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage during spraying.
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension specialists or HAU experts for precise diagnosis and the most current recommendations tailored to your specific field conditions and prevailing disease pressure.
