As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in BAJRA NAPIER HYBRID in Haryana:

*   **Diamondback moth:** This is not known to affect BAJRA NAPIER HYBRID.

For Borers, Caterpillars, and Leaf folder, which are primarily lepidopteran pests, the following CIBRC-approved insecticides can be effectively used:

**General Control Measures for Borers, Caterpillars, and Leaf folder:**

When pest incidence is observed, especially in the early stages of crop growth (up to 45-60 days), timely application is crucial. Focus on targeting the whorl and young leaves where these pests are often found.

*   **For Borers (e.g., Stem borers) and early-stage Caterpillars:**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** Apply at 60 ml per acre, mixed in 200-250 litres of water.
    *   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG:** Apply at 80-100 g per acre, mixed in 200-250 litres of water.
    *   **Fipronil 0.3% GR:** For stem borers, apply 6-8 kg per acre by broadcasting granules into the whorl of the plants. This is particularly effective for early infestation.

*   **For Caterpillars (general) and Leaf folder:**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** Apply at 60 ml per acre, mixed in 200-250 litres of water.
    *   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG:** Apply at 80-100 g per acre, mixed in 200-250 litres of water.
    *   **Flubendiamide 20% WG:** Apply at 50 g per acre, mixed in 200-250 litres of water.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the label instructions of the specific product you are using.
*   Ensure proper spray coverage, especially targeting the whorl and undersides of leaves where pests hide.
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
*   Monitor your crop regularly for pest incidence to ensure timely intervention.
