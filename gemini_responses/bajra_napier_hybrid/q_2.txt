As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling rust diseases in Bajra Napier Hybrid in Haryana:

Regarding the specific rust types mentioned:

*   **Black Rust (Stem Rust):** This is not known to affect BAJRA NAPIER HYBRID.
*   **Yellow Rust (Stripe Rust):** This is not known to affect BAJRA NAPIER HYBRID.
*   **White Rust:** This is not known to affect BAJRA NAPIER HYBRID.
*   **Red Rust:** This is not a standard classification for rust diseases specifically affecting BAJRA NAPIER HYBRID. The primary rust affecting this crop is commonly referred to as Brown Rust.

The most significant rust disease affecting Bajra (Pearl Millet) and consequently Bajra Napier Hybrid is **Brown Rust**, caused by *Puccinia substriata var. indica*.

Here's how to control Brown Rust in BAJRA NAPIER HYBRID:

**1. Cultural Practices:**

*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available, choose hybrid varieties known for their resistance or tolerance to rust. Consult with HAU or local agricultural extension for recommended varieties suitable for your region.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops to break the disease cycle.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest to reduce inoculum for the next season.
*   **Optimal Plant Spacing:** Ensure proper plant spacing to improve air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce humidity and fungal growth.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced fertilization. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can make plants more susceptible to rust.

**2. Chemical Control (Fungicides):**

Fungicides should be applied at the first appearance of rust symptoms (small, reddish-brown pustules, mainly on the lower leaves) and repeated if necessary, especially during humid weather conditions. Always ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.

*   **Propiconazole 25% EC:**
    *   Apply at a rate of 200-250 ml per acre, mixed in 200-250 litres of water (i.e., 1 ml/L).
*   **Tebuconazole 25.9% EC:**
    *   Apply at a rate of 200-250 ml per acre, mixed in 200-250 litres of water (i.e., 1 ml/L).

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the fungicide label for correct dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer for the most current recommendations and to confirm the specific rust species if symptoms are unusual.
*   Ensure proper safety gear (gloves, mask, protective clothing) is used during fungicide application.
