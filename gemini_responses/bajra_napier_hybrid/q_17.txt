As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following doses of organic manures for Bajra Napier Hybrid, keeping in mind the high biomass production potential of this fodder crop and the need for sustainable soil health:

It is important to incorporate these organic manures thoroughly into the soil during land preparation for optimal benefits. Regular soil testing is recommended to fine-tune nutrient management practices.

*   **Farm Yard Manure (FYM):**
    *   **Dose:** 10,000 - 15,000 kg per acre (10-15 tonnes per acre).
    *   **Application:** Apply well-decomposed FYM at the time of land preparation and thoroughly incorporate it into the soil before planting/sowing.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   **Dose:** 2,000 - 3,000 kg per acre (2-3 tonnes per acre).
    *   **Application:** Apply at the time of land preparation and incorporate into the soil, or as a top dressing after establishment and subsequent cuttings.

*   **Sagarika (seaweed extract based product):**
    *   **Dose (Foliar Spray):** 2.5 - 5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Dose (Soil Application/Drench):** 1 - 2 litres per acre.
    *   **Application:**
        *   For foliar spray, apply 2-3 times during the growth cycle. The first application can be done around 20-30 days after planting/cutting, followed by subsequent applications at intervals of 30-45 days.
        *   For soil application, it can be applied with irrigation water or as a drench around the root zone.
