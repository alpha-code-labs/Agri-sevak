As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following cultivation practices for Bajra Napier Hybrid, which is primarily propagated vegetatively for fodder production:

*   **Sowing method/pattern:**
    *   Bajra Napier Hybrid is predominantly propagated through vegetative means, using stem cuttings or root slips, rather than seeds, to maintain hybrid vigor and ensure uniform growth.
    *   **Planting Method:** Plant stem cuttings or root slips directly in the field.
    *   **Pattern:** Row planting is recommended for efficient intercultivation, weeding, and harvesting.

*   **Planting depth:**
    *   **For Stem Cuttings:** Plant cuttings (typically 2-3 nodes long) at an angle, ensuring at least two-thirds of the cutting is buried in the soil, with one node exposed above the soil surface.
    *   **For Root Slips:** Plant root slips upright, ensuring the crown (base of the plant from which shoots emerge) is at or just below the soil surface.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   Maintain a spacing of **60 cm** between rows and **45 cm** between plants within a row. This spacing allows for optimal plant growth, tillering, and ease of management for multiple cuts.

*   **Seed dose:**
    *   Traditional "seed dose" is not applicable as Bajra Napier Hybrid is primarily propagated vegetatively.
    *   **Planting Material Requirement:** Approximately **15,000 to 20,000 stem cuttings or root slips** are required per acre to achieve the recommended spacing. Ensure healthy, disease-free planting material for best results.
