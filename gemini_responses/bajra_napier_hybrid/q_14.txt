As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified strategies for controlling soil pests like termites and nematodes (root-knot) in BAJRA NAPIER HYBRID in Haryana:

### Control of Termites

Termites can cause significant damage to the root system of Bajra Napier Hybrid, leading to stunted growth and reduced fodder yield.

**Cultural Practices:**
*   **Deep Ploughing:** Ploughing the field deeply during summer exposes termite colonies to sunlight and predators, disrupting their activity.
*   **Removal of Stubble:** Ensure complete removal of crop residues and stubble from the previous crop, as these can serve as food sources for termites.
*   **Proper Irrigation:** Avoid water stress, as termites are often more problematic in dry conditions.

**Chemical Control (Pre-planting/At-planting):**
For effective control, soil application of CIBRC approved insecticides before or at the time of planting is recommended.
*   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: Apply 2.0-2.5 litres per acre mixed with 200-400 litres of water as a drench in the soil or incorporate into the soil during final land preparation.
*   **Fipronil** 0.3% GR: Apply 6-8 kg per acre by broadcasting and incorporating into the soil before planting.

### Control of Nematodes (Root-knot)

Root-knot nematodes can infest the roots of Bajra Napier Hybrid, causing galls, nutrient deficiency symptoms, and reduced fodder production.

**Cultural Practices:**
*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate Bajra Napier Hybrid with non-host crops like marigold (Tagetes spp.) or certain varieties of mustard, which can act as trap crops or bio-fumigants.
*   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporate well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or vermicompost at a rate of 5-10 tonnes per acre. This enhances soil health, promotes beneficial microorganisms, and can suppress nematode populations.
*   **Summer Ploughing:** Deep ploughing during the hot summer months exposes nematode eggs and larvae to high temperatures and desiccation, reducing their numbers.
*   **Solarization:** In small plots, soil solarization (covering moist soil with clear polyethylene sheets during hot months) can effectively reduce nematode populations.

**Biological Control:**
*   **Purpureocillium lilacinum** (bio-nematicide): Apply 2.5 kg per acre mixed with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed FYM or compost. Broadcast this mixture evenly over the field and incorporate it into the soil before planting or at the time of planting. This fungus parasitizes nematode eggs and females.

**Chemical Control:**
For fodder crops like Bajra Napier Hybrid, chemical nematicides are generally avoided due to potential residue concerns and the continuous harvesting nature of the crop. Biological and cultural methods are preferred for sustainable nematode management. If nematode infestation is severe and other methods are insufficient, consult with HAU experts for specific recommendations, considering the pre-harvest interval and safety for livestock.
