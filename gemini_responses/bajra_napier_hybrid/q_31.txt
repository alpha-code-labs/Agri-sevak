Bajra Napier Hybrid is primarily cultivated as a fodder crop for its vegetative biomass (leaves and stems), not for fruit production. Therefore, the conditions of "Fruit bursting" and "Hardness in fruit" are not applicable to this crop.

Regarding "Leaf burning/melting": While leaves can exhibit symptoms of stress such as scorching due to extreme heat, water stress, or nutrient deficiencies, the specific conditions described as "Fruit bursting, Leaf burning/melting, and Hardness in fruit" are not known to affect BAJRA NAPIER HYBRID in the manner implied by the question.
