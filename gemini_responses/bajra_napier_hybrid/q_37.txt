Protecting Bajra Napier Hybrid from wild animals is a significant challenge for farmers in Haryana. Wild animals such as Nilgai (Blue Bull), wild boars, and monkeys can cause substantial damage to fodder crops. Since there are no CIBRC approved technical chemical repellents specifically for deterring wild animals from crops, the primary methods focus on physical barriers, deterrents, and vigilance.

Here are the recommended methods:

*   **Physical Fencing:**
    *   **Barbed Wire Fencing:** A multi-strand barbed wire fence (at least 5-7 strands) can be effective against larger animals like Nilgai and wild boars, especially if combined with a trench.
    *   **Electric Fencing:** This is one of the most effective methods. A low-cost, solar-powered electric fence can deter most wild animals. It is crucial to ensure proper installation, clear warning signs, and adherence to safety regulations to prevent harm to humans and non-target animals. Regular maintenance is required.
    *   **Chain-link Fencing:** While more expensive, a sturdy chain-link fence can provide a robust physical barrier against a wider range of animals.

*   **Trenching:**
    *   Digging a deep and wide trench (e.g., 1.5 meters deep and 1 meter wide) around the field can prevent wild boars and other ground-dwelling animals from entering. The soil from the trench can be piled up on the field side to increase the barrier height.

*   **Auditory and Visual Deterrents:**
    *   **Scarecrows:** Traditional scarecrows can be used, but their effectiveness diminishes over time as animals become accustomed to them. Frequent changes in their appearance and location are necessary.
    *   **Reflective Objects:** Hanging old CDs, aluminum foil strips, or reflective tapes can create flashes of light that may deter some animals, especially birds and monkeys.
    *   **Noise Makers:** Using gas guns (with proper permits and safety), firecrackers (used cautiously and legally), or traditional drums and other noise-making devices can scare away animals, particularly during critical periods like crop establishment or early growth.

*   **Human Vigilance and Guard Animals:**
    *   **Regular Patrolling:** Human presence in and around the fields, especially during dawn, dusk, and night, can be a strong deterrent.
    *   **Guard Dogs:** Trained guard dogs can be effective in deterring wild animals from approaching the fields.

*   **Community-Based Approaches:**
    *   **Collective Protection:** Farmers in a village or cluster of fields can collaborate to implement protection measures and share the responsibility of guarding, which is often more effective than individual efforts.

It is important to note that the effectiveness of these methods can vary depending on the type of wild animal, their population density, and the specific local conditions. A combination of methods often yields the best results.
