As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified fertilizer doses for Bajra Napier Hybrid in Haryana. These recommendations are general and should ideally be fine-tuned based on a soil test report for your specific field.

Bajra Napier Hybrid is a high-yielding perennial fodder crop that requires significant nutrient inputs for vigorous growth and multiple cuts throughout its productive life.

**I. Basal Application (at the time of planting):**

For optimal establishment and initial growth, the following nutrient levels are recommended:
*   **Nitrogen (N):** 25-30 kg N per acre
*   **Phosphorus (P2O5):** 20-25 kg P2O5 per acre
*   **Potassium (K2O):** 15-20 kg K2O per acre (Apply if soil test indicates low to medium potassium levels)
*   **Sulphur (S):** 8-10 kg S per acre (Apply if soil test indicates deficiency)

To achieve these nutrient levels, you can use the following combinations of fertilizers:

*   **Option 1 (Using DAP, Urea, Potash, and Sulphur):**
    *   **DAP (Di-ammonium Phosphate):** 45-55 kg/acre (This provides approximately 8-10 kg N and 20-25 kg P2O5)
    *   **Urea:** 35-50 kg/acre (To supplement the remaining N requirement)
    *   **Muriate of Potash (MOP):** 25-35 kg/acre (If K is required)
    *   **Bentonite Sulphur (90% S):** 10-12 kg/acre (If S is required)

*   **Option 2 (Using SSP, Urea, and Potash):**
    *   **Single Super Phosphate (SSP):** 125-150 kg/acre (This provides approximately 20-24 kg P2O5 and 13-16 kg S)
    *   **Urea:** 55-65 kg/acre (For the full N requirement)
    *   **Muriate of Potash (MOP):** 25-35 kg/acre (If K is required)
    *   *Note: If **SSP** is used, a separate Sulphur application might not be necessary as **SSP** provides sufficient S.*

*   **Option 3 (Using NPK Complex Fertilizers):**
    *   **NPK (e.g., 12:32:16 grade):** 65-80 kg/acre. (This will provide approximately 8-10 kg N, 20-25 kg P2O5, and 10-13 kg K2O).
    *   **Urea:** 35-45 kg/acre (To supplement the remaining N requirement)
    *   **Muriate of Potash (MOP):** 10-15 kg/acre (To supplement the remaining K requirement, if needed)
    *   **Bentonite Sulphur (90% S):** 10-12 kg/acre (If S is required)
    *   *Note: **NPK** complex fertilizers simplify application but may require additional single fertilizers to precisely meet nutrient targets.*

**II. Top Dressing Application (After each cut):**

Bajra Napier Hybrid responds very well to nitrogen application after each harvest to promote rapid regrowth.
*   **Nitrogen (N):** 20-25 kg N per acre after every cut.
    *   **Urea:** 45-55 kg/acre

**III. Foliar Application (as supplementary or corrective measures):**

Foliar applications can be used to supplement nutrient uptake, especially during critical growth stages or under stress conditions.

*   **Nano-Urea (Liquid, 4% N):**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml/L of water.
    *   **Application:** Spray 250-500 ml of **Nano-Urea** per acre, diluted in 100-150 litres of water. Apply at critical growth stages or 7-10 days after each cut, especially during periods of high growth or stress. Two sprays per cut cycle can be beneficial.

*   **Nano-DAP (Liquid, 8% N, 16% P2O5):**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml/L of water.
    *   **Application:** Spray 250-500 ml of **Nano-DAP** per acre, diluted in 100-150 litres of water. Apply at critical growth stages (e.g., tillering, early vegetative growth) or when P deficiency is suspected.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Soil Testing:** Always conduct a soil test before planting to determine the exact nutrient status of your field. This will help in fine-tuning the fertilizer recommendations and avoiding over or under-application.
*   **Water Availability:** Ensure adequate moisture in the soil at the time of fertilizer application, especially for basal and top-dressed granular fertilizers, to facilitate nutrient uptake.
*   **Number of Cuts:** The total annual fertilizer requirement will depend on the number of cuts taken. Adjust top-dressing applications accordingly.
*   **Organic Manures:** Integration of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost (10-15 tonnes/acre annually) can significantly improve soil health and reduce the reliance on chemical fertilizers.
