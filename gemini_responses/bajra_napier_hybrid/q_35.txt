As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), here is the scientifically verified advice for the maturity signs, harvesting time, and cutting process for BAJRA NAPIER HYBRID in Haryana:

**Maturity Signs for Fodder Harvest:**

*   **Height:** The primary indicator for fodder harvest is the plant reaching an optimal height, typically between 1.0 to 1.5 meters.
*   **Vegetative Stage:** The crop should be harvested at a lush vegetative stage, ideally before or at the very early stages of flowering. Harvesting at this stage ensures maximum palatability, digestibility, and crude protein content.
*   **Leafiness:** The plant should have a good proportion of green leaves, indicating high nutritional value. As the plant matures beyond this stage, stem lignification increases, reducing fodder quality.

**Harvesting Time:**

*   **First Cut:** The first cut is generally ready 50-60 days after planting or sowing, once the plants have established well and reached the optimal height.
*   **Subsequent Cuts:** Subsequent cuts can be taken every 30-40 days during the active growing season (kharif and early rabi), depending on the growth rate, soil fertility, and irrigation availability. In cooler months, the growth rate slows down, and the interval between cuts may increase.
*   **Frequency:** Bajra Napier Hybrid is a multi-cut fodder crop, capable of providing 5-7 cuts per year under good management practices in Haryana's climate.

**Cutting Process:**

*   **Cutting Height:** Cut the plants close to the ground, leaving a stubble height of approximately 10-15 cm from the soil surface. This encourages vigorous regrowth and ensures maximum biomass harvest.
*   **Method:** Use sharp implements such as sickles or mechanical fodder harvesters to ensure clean cuts. Clean cuts minimize damage to the plant's crown, promoting healthier and faster regrowth.
*   **Direction:** While not strictly critical, cutting uniformly across the field helps in managing subsequent harvests.
*   **Post-Harvest Care:** After each cut, it is beneficial to apply irrigation and a top-dressing of nitrogen fertilizer to support rapid regrowth and maintain high fodder yields.
