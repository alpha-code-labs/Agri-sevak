Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm that Scale insects and Mealybugs can indeed affect Bajra Napier Hybrid, leading to significant yield losses if not managed properly. These sap-sucking pests weaken the plant, causing yellowing, stunted growth, and reduced fodder quality.

Here's a scientifically verified approach for their control:

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategy:**

1.  **Monitoring and Early Detection:** Regularly inspect your Bajra Napier Hybrid plants, especially the undersides of leaves and stem nodes, for the presence of scale insects (which appear as small, immobile bumps) or mealybugs (which are soft-bodied, white, cottony masses). Early detection allows for more effective and less intensive control measures.
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy heavily infested plant parts (leaves, stems) to reduce pest populations.
    *   **Sanitation:** Keep the field free of weeds and plant debris, which can harbor pests.
    *   **Proper Nutrition:** Ensure balanced fertilization. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can promote lush, soft growth that is more attractive to sap-sucking pests.
    *   **Water Management:** Maintain optimal soil moisture to reduce plant stress, making plants more resilient.
3.  **Biological Control:** Encourage natural enemies such as ladybird beetles, lacewings, and parasitic wasps, which prey on or parasitize scale insects and mealybugs. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that can harm these beneficial insects.

**Chemical Control (When necessary and as a last resort):**

If the infestation is severe and cultural/biological methods are insufficient, chemical control may be required. Always ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and stem crevices where these pests hide.

Please use the following CIBRC approved technical chemical names and dosages:

*   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at a rate of **0.5 ml per litre of water** (or **100-125 ml per acre**). This is a systemic insecticide effective against sap-sucking pests.
*   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at a rate of **0.2-0.3 g per litre of water** (or **50-100 g per acre**). This is another systemic insecticide that provides good control.
*   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at a rate of **1.25-1.5 ml per litre of water** (or **500-600 ml per acre**). This is an insect growth regulator that specifically targets the nymphal stages of mealybugs and scale insects, disrupting their molting process.
*   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:** Apply at a rate of **0.75-1 ml per litre of water** (or **200-250 ml per acre**). This is a systemic insecticide with excellent translaminar and phloem-systemic movement, providing good control of hidden pests.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Application:** Ensure thorough spray coverage, targeting the infested plant parts. For scale insects and mealybugs, repeat applications might be necessary at 10-15 day intervals, depending on the severity of the infestation and the life cycle of the pest.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, and protective clothing while handling and applying pesticides. Follow the instructions on the product label carefully.
*   **Harvest Interval:** Be mindful of the pre-harvest interval (PHI) for any chemical applied, especially if the fodder is intended for animal consumption soon after application.
