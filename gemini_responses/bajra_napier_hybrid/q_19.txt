As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified approaches to address macro-nutrient deficiencies (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium) in Bajra Napier Hybrid in Haryana.

**Crucial First Step:**
Before applying any fertilizers, it is highly recommended to conduct a **soil test** from a reputable laboratory (e.g., HAU, Hisar) to accurately determine the existing nutrient levels in your field. This will provide precise recommendations tailored to your specific soil conditions and prevent over-application or under-application of nutrients. Visual symptoms can be indicative, but a soil test confirms the deficiency and its severity.

**Addressing Macro-nutrient Deficiencies in Bajra Napier Hybrid:**

### **1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency**

Nitrogen is vital for vigorous vegetative growth, chlorophyll production, and overall plant health.
*   **Symptoms:** General yellowing of older leaves, stunted growth, reduced tillering, and pale green foliage.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Basal Application (at sowing/planting):**
        *   Apply 20-30 kg N per acre using:
            *   **Urea** (46% N): Approximately 43-65 kg per acre.
            *   **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5): Approximately 111-167 kg per acre (this will also supply Phosphorus).
            *   **Calcium Ammonium Nitrate (CAN)** (25% N): Approximately 80-120 kg per acre.
    *   **Top-dressing (after each cut or 20-30 days after sowing/previous application):**
        *   Apply 20-30 kg N per acre after each cut to maintain continuous growth.
        *   Use **Urea**: Approximately 43-65 kg per acre.
        *   **Ammonium Sulphate** (20.5% N): Approximately 97-146 kg per acre.
    *   **Foliar Application (for quick recovery in severe cases):**
        *   Dissolve 20 g of **Urea** per liter of water (2% solution) and spray on foliage. Repeat after 7-10 days if needed. Ensure good coverage.

### **2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency**

Phosphorus is essential for root development, energy transfer, and overall plant vigor.
*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, dark green or purplish discoloration of older leaves, poor root development, and delayed maturity.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Basal Application (at sowing/planting):** Phosphorus is relatively immobile in the soil, so basal application is most effective.
        *   Apply 40-60 kg P2O5 per acre using:
            *   **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (46% P2O5, 18% N): Approximately 87-130 kg per acre.
            *   **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5): Approximately 250-375 kg per acre.
    *   **Note:** Ensure proper incorporation into the soil during field preparation for maximum availability.

### **3. Potassium (K) Deficiency**

Potassium plays a crucial role in water regulation, disease resistance, stalk strength, and nutrient transport.
*   **Symptoms:** Yellowing and browning/scorching of leaf margins (especially older leaves), weak stems leading to lodging, reduced disease resistance, and poor overall plant health.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Basal Application (at sowing/planting) or Top-dressing:**
        *   Apply 40-60 kg K2O per acre using:
            *   **Muriate of Potash (MOP) / Potassium Chloride** (60% K2O): Approximately 67-100 kg per acre.
            *   **Sulphate of Potash (SOP) / Potassium Sulphate** (50% K2O): Approximately 80-120 kg per acre.
    *   **Note:** Potassium can be applied basally or split into two applications, one at sowing and another after the first cut, especially in sandy soils or areas with high rainfall.

**General Recommendations for Sustainable Nutrient Management:**

*   **Organic Matter:** Incorporate well-decomposed Farmyard Manure (FYM) or compost at 10-15 tonnes per acre during field preparation. This improves soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability.
*   **Irrigation:** Ensure adequate and timely irrigation, as water stress can hinder nutrient uptake even if nutrients are present in the soil.
*   **pH Management:** Maintain soil pH in the optimal range (6.0-7.5) for nutrient availability.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management (INM):** Combine chemical fertilizers with organic manures and bio-fertilizers for long-term soil health and productivity.

Always consult with local agricultural extension services or HAU experts for the most current and specific recommendations for your farm.
