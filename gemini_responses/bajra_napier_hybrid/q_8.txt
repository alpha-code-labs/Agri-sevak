As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm that sucking pests such as Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips are common concerns for fodder crops, including Bajra Napier Hybrid. While Psylla is less commonly associated with grasses, broad-spectrum insecticides targeting other sucking pests would generally provide control if it were to occur.

Effective management of sucking pests in Bajra Napier Hybrid involves an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural practices, biological control, and judicious use of chemical control when necessary.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies:**

1.  **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect plants for early signs of pest infestation. Pay attention to the underside of leaves and new growth.
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Maintain proper plant spacing to ensure good air circulation.
    *   Ensure balanced fertilization; excessive nitrogen can lead to lush growth, making plants more attractive to sucking pests.
    *   Remove weeds, which can act as alternate hosts for pests.
3.  **Biological Control:** Encourage natural enemies like ladybird beetles, lacewings, and parasitic wasps, which prey on aphids and other soft-bodied insects. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

**Chemical Control (when pest populations reach economic threshold):**

When chemical intervention is required, select CIBRC-approved insecticides and strictly follow label instructions for dosage, application method, and safety precautions. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

Here are some CIBRC-approved technical chemical names for controlling sucking pests in fodder crops, along with their general application rates:

*   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply 125-150 ml per acre, diluted in 200-300 litres of water. This is a systemic insecticide effective against aphids, leafhoppers, and whiteflies.
*   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply 50-100 grams per acre, diluted in 200-300 litres of water. Another systemic insecticide with good efficacy against a range of sucking pests including aphids, leafhoppers, and whiteflies.
*   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply 50-100 grams per acre, diluted in 200-300 litres of water. Effective against aphids, whiteflies, and thrips.
*   **Fipronil 5% SC:** Apply 400-600 ml per acre, diluted in 200-300 litres of water. Provides good control of thrips and leafhoppers.
*   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply 300-400 ml per acre, diluted in 200-300 litres of water. This is an insect growth regulator primarily effective against whiteflies and hoppers by disrupting their molting process.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Timing of Application:** Apply insecticides during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the underside of leaves where many sucking pests reside.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** For fodder crops, always be mindful of the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) specified on the insecticide label to ensure the safety of the fodder for livestock consumption.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent pests from developing resistance.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and application.

For precise recommendations tailored to your specific field conditions and current pest pressure, it is always advisable to consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts.
