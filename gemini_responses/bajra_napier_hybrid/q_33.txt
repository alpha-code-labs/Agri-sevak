As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an integrated approach for weed management in Bajra Napier Hybrid, combining cultural, mechanical, and judicious chemical methods.

First, addressing specific weeds:

*   **Orobanche:** This is not known to affect BAJRA NAPIER HYBRID, as Orobanche species are root parasites primarily of dicotyledonous plants, and Bajra Napier Hybrid is a monocot.

For other weeds like Broadleaf weeds (Bathu, Congress grass), Narrowleaf weeds (Phalaris minor), and Amarbail, consider the following:

**I. Cultural and Mechanical Weed Control (Highly Recommended for Perennial Fodder Crops):**

1.  **Thorough Land Preparation:** Ensure the field is free of perennial weeds and their propagules before planting.
2.  **Clean Planting Material:** Use disease-free and weed-free slips or seeds for planting.
3.  **Timely Inter-cultivation/Weeding:** Manual weeding or mechanical inter-cultivation (if row spacing allows) is highly effective, especially in the initial stages and after each cutting. This is crucial for controlling Amarbail and other weeds.
4.  **High Planting Density:** A dense stand of Bajra Napier Hybrid can suppress weed growth.
5.  **Crop Rotation:** While Bajra Napier Hybrid is perennial, rotating the field with other crops before establishing BNH can help reduce the weed seed bank.
6.  **Mulching:** Applying organic mulch can suppress weed emergence.

**II. Chemical Weed Control (Use with Caution and as per CIBRC Guidelines):**

Herbicides for fodder crops are limited due to residue concerns. Always ensure the chosen herbicide is registered for use in fodder crops and follow label instructions strictly.

**A. Pre-Emergence Herbicides (Applied before weed emergence, typically at planting or after cutting):**

These are effective against germinating broadleaf and narrowleaf weeds, including Phalaris minor.

*   **Pendimethalin (30% EC):** Apply 3.3 - 4.0 Litres per acre in 200-300 Litres of water within 0-3 days of planting Bajra Napier Hybrid slips or after a fresh cutting. This provides control of many annual broadleaf and narrowleaf weeds.
*   **Atrazine (50% WP):** Apply 1.0 - 1.5 kg per acre in 200-300 Litres of water as a pre-emergence application. Effective against many broadleaf and some grassy weeds.

**B. Post-Emergence Herbicides (Applied after weeds have emerged):**

These are primarily for broadleaf weeds. Selective control of grassy weeds (like Phalaris minor) in a grass crop like Bajra Napier Hybrid is very challenging with post-emergence herbicides without harming the crop.

*   **For Broadleaf Weeds (Bathu, Congress grass, etc.):**
    *   **2,4-D Amine Salt (58% SL):** Apply 1.0 - 1.5 Litres per acre in 200-300 Litres of water when broadleaf weeds are young (2-4 leaf stage). Ensure the Bajra Napier Hybrid is well-established and not under stress. Avoid spraying during flowering of BNH.
    *   **2,4-D Sodium Salt (80% WP):** Apply 0.8 - 1.0 kg per acre in 200-300 Litres of water when broadleaf weeds are young.

*   **For Amarbail (Cuscuta spp.):**
    *   Chemical control of Amarbail in established Bajra Napier Hybrid is extremely difficult and often impractical without harming the crop.
    *   **Prevention is key:** Use Amarbail-free planting material.
    *   **Manual Removal:** Immediately remove and destroy Amarbail patches as soon as they are noticed to prevent spread. This is the most effective method.
    *   **Spot Application (Extreme Caution):** In severe, localized patches, a very careful spot application of a non-selective herbicide like **Glyphosate (41% SL)** at 10-15 ml/L of water can be used, but this will also kill the Bajra Napier Hybrid in the treated area. This should only be considered for small, isolated patches and as a last resort, ensuring no drift to healthy plants.

**Important Precautions:**

*   Always read and strictly follow the label instructions of the herbicide.
*   Use the correct dosage and water volume.
*   Ensure proper spray coverage.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application.
*   Avoid spraying during windy conditions to prevent drift.
*   Observe the recommended waiting period (harvest interval) before feeding the fodder to livestock, especially for post-emergence applications. For most fodder crops, chemical use is minimized due to this.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension specialists for the most current and specific recommendations for your field conditions.
