This is not known to affect BAJRA NAPIER HYBRID.

Bajra Napier Hybrid is primarily cultivated as a fodder crop for its vegetative biomass (leaves and stems). The economic yield is derived from multiple cuts of the green fodder, not from its reproductive structures (flowers, fruits, or seeds). Therefore, flower drop, fruit drop, or boll dropping are not recognized as significant issues or conditions requiring control measures in Bajra Napier Hybrid cultivation.
