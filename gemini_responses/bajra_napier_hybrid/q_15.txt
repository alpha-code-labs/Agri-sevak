As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in BAJRA NAPIER HYBRID in Haryana:

**1. Grasshopper:**
Grasshoppers can cause significant defoliation, especially in young Bajra Napier Hybrid plants.
*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Deep ploughing during summer can expose and destroy grasshopper eggs laid in the soil.
    *   Maintain field sanitation to reduce breeding sites.
*   **Chemical Control (if infestation is severe):**
    *   **Malathion** 50% EC at 1.25 litres per acre, mixed in 250-400 litres of water, can be sprayed. Ensure proper coverage of the foliage.

**2. Painted bug:**
This is not known to affect BAJRA NAPIER HYBRID. Painted bug (Bagrada hilaris) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops like mustard, cabbage, and cauliflower.

**3. Red cotton bug:**
This is not known to affect BAJRA NAPIER HYBRID. Red cotton bug (Dysdercus cingulatus) is primarily a pest of cotton and other malvaceous plants.

**4. Black ants:**
This is not known to affect BAJRA NAPIER HYBRID as a direct pest causing significant damage to the plant itself. While ants may be present in fields, they typically do not feed on Bajra Napier Hybrid plants. If ants are observed, they are often associated with other sucking pests like aphids (feeding on honeydew), in which case the primary focus should be on controlling the sucking pest.
