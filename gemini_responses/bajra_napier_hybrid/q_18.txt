As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the use of growth regulators/hormones for BAJRA NAPIER HYBRID in Haryana:

1.  **Ethephon** (often marketed as Ethrel):
    *   **Ethephon** is a plant growth regulator that releases ethylene. Its use for enhancing the general growth or biomass production of BAJRA NAPIER HYBRID is not a standard recommendation in Haryana. Specific applications might exist for other purposes in different crops, but for BAJRA NAPIER HYBRID as a fodder crop, it is not commonly advised as a growth promoter.

2.  **2,4-D**:
    *   **2,4-D** is a synthetic auxin primarily used as a selective herbicide for broadleaf weeds. It is not known to be recommended or used as a growth regulator for enhancing the growth of BAJRA NAPIER HYBRID. Applying 2,4-D to BAJRA NAPIER HYBRID would likely cause severe phytotoxicity and damage the crop, as it is a monocot crop.

3.  **Boron**:
    *   **Boron** is an essential micronutrient, not a growth regulator in the conventional sense, but vital for plant health and various physiological processes. Its application is recommended only when a deficiency is identified through soil testing or visual symptoms (e.g., stunted growth, poor tillering, brittle leaves).
    *   **Borax (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate)** or **Boric Acid**:
        *   Foliar spray: 1 g of **Borax** (or 0.6 g of **Boric Acid**) per litre of water. Apply 200-250 litres of solution per acre (equivalent to 200-250 g **Borax** or 120-150 g **Boric Acid** per acre) at the tillering or early vegetative stage, if deficiency is observed.
        *   Soil application (if severe deficiency is indicated by soil test): 2-4 kg of **Borax** per acre, mixed with basal fertilizers at the time of sowing.
