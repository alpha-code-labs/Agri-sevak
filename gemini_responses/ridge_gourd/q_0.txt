As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified strategies for controlling fungal diseases in Ridge Gourd in Haryana:

It is crucial to implement an Integrated Disease Management (IDM) approach, combining cultural practices with judicious use of CIBRC-approved fungicides.

### General Cultural Practices for Fungal Disease Management:

*   **Disease-Free Seeds:** Always use certified disease-free seeds or treat seeds with recommended fungicides.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-cucurbit crops for at least 2-3 years to break disease cycles.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy infected plant debris from the field to reduce inoculum sources.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Maintain adequate plant spacing to ensure good air circulation, which helps reduce humidity and fungal growth.
*   **Irrigation Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day, to minimize leaf wetness duration. Drip irrigation is preferred.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced fertilization. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can promote lush, susceptible growth.
*   **Regular Monitoring:** Scout fields regularly for early detection of disease symptoms to allow for timely intervention.

### Specific Disease Control Measures:

#### 1. Alternaria Leaf Spot/Blight (*Alternaria cucumerina*)

This disease causes small, circular, water-soaked spots that enlarge and become angular, often with concentric rings (target spots).

*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
    *   **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Chlorothalonil** at 2 g/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Tebuconazole** at 0.75 ml/L of water.

#### 2. Anthracnose (*Colletotrichum orbiculare*)

Symptoms include circular, dark, sunken lesions on leaves, stems, and fruits. On fruits, lesions can be deep and cause rot.

*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
    *   **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Chlorothalonil** at 2 g/L of water.
    *   **Carbendazim** at 1 g/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5 ml/L of water.

#### 3. Blast

This is not known to affect Ridge Gourd.

#### 4. Blight (General)

This is a broad term. If specific blight symptoms occur, they are often covered by the control measures for Alternaria or Downy Mildew.

#### 5. Brown Spot

This is not known to affect Ridge Gourd.

#### 6. Downy Mildew (*Pseudoperonospora cubensis*)

Characterized by angular, yellowish spots on the upper leaf surface, often delimited by veins. A purplish-grey, fuzzy growth may be visible on the underside of the leaves, especially in humid conditions.

*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
    *   **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water (preventive).
    *   **Chlorothalonil** at 2 g/L of water (preventive).
    *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride** at 2 ml/L of water.
    *   **Dimethomorph** at 1 g/L of water.
    *   Combination products like **Cymoxanil + Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water.
    *   Combination products like **Fenamidone + Propamocarb hydrochloride** at 2 ml/L of water.
    *   Combination products like **Fluopicolide + Propamocarb hydrochloride** at 0.5 ml/L of water.

#### 7. Powdery Mildew (*Podosphaera xanthii* or *Erysiphe cichoracearum*)

Appears as white, powdery patches on the upper and lower surfaces of leaves, stems, and sometimes fruits. Severely infected leaves may turn yellow and die.

*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
    *   **Sulphur (Wettable powder)** at 2-3 g/L of water (avoid spraying in very hot weather).
    *   **Myclobutanil** at 0.4 ml/L of water.
    *   **Penconazole** at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Tebuconazole** at 0.75 ml/L of water.
    *   **Difenoconazole** at 0.5 ml/L of water.

#### 8. Grey Mildew

This is not known to affect Ridge Gourd.

**Important Note:** Always read and follow the instructions on the fungicide label for correct dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI). Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
