As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified approaches to address macro-nutrient deficiencies in Ridge Gourd. It is crucial to emphasize that **soil testing is the most accurate method** to determine the specific nutrient status of your field and tailor fertilizer recommendations accordingly. The following are general guidelines for addressing visible deficiency symptoms.

### General Recommendations:
*   Always conduct a soil test before planting and periodically during the crop cycle to precisely identify deficiencies and determine the exact nutrient requirements.
*   Apply fertilizers uniformly and ensure proper irrigation after application for better nutrient uptake.

### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   General yellowing (chlorosis) of older leaves, starting from the tips and progressing inwards.
*   Stunted plant growth with thin, spindly stems.
*   Reduced fruit set and smaller fruits.

**Correction:**
*   **Basal Application (if not applied adequately):**
    *   Apply **Urea** at 40-50 kg/acre.
*   **Top Dressing (for existing plants showing symptoms):**
    *   Apply **Urea** at 20-30 kg/acre, split into 2-3 applications at 15-20 day intervals, starting 20-25 days after sowing/transplanting.
*   **Foliar Spray (for quick recovery):**
    *   Spray a 1-2% solution of **Urea** (10-20 g/L of water). Repeat after 7-10 days if symptoms persist. Ensure complete coverage of foliage.

### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   Dark green or purplish discoloration of leaves, especially on the undersides and margins of older leaves.
*   Stunted growth, poor root development, and delayed maturity.
*   Reduced flowering and fruit development.

**Correction:**
*   **Basal Application (Phosphorus is less mobile in soil, so basal application is most effective):**
    *   Apply **Single Superphosphate** at 250-300 kg/acre.
    *   Alternatively, apply **Diammonium Phosphate** at 100-130 kg/acre.
*   **Note:** For established plants showing severe deficiency, a small amount of **Diammonium Phosphate** can be band-placed near the root zone, followed by irrigation. Foliar application of phosphorus is generally less effective for correcting severe deficiencies but can provide a temporary boost.

### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   Yellowing and browning/scorching of leaf margins (necrosis), particularly on older leaves.
*   Weak stems, poor fruit quality, and reduced shelf life.
*   Increased susceptibility to diseases and environmental stresses.

**Correction:**
*   **Basal Application (if not applied adequately):**
    *   Apply **Potassium Chloride** (Muriate of Potash) at 60-80 kg/acre.
*   **Top Dressing (for existing plants showing symptoms):**
    *   Apply **Potassium Chloride** (Muriate of Potash) at 30-40 kg/acre, split into 1-2 applications during the vegetative and flowering stages.
*   **Foliar Spray (for quick recovery):**
    *   Spray a 0.5-1% solution of **Potassium Sulphate** (5-10 g/L of water) or **Potassium Nitrate** (5-10 g/L of water). Repeat after 7-10 days if symptoms persist.

Always ensure proper irrigation after applying granular fertilizers to facilitate nutrient dissolution and uptake by the plants. For best results, integrate these chemical corrections with good agricultural practices, including organic matter addition and proper water management.
