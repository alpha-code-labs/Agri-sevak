Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

The symptom of "drying up" (drying branches, leaves, fruits, and flowers) in Ridge Gourd is a general indication of underlying stress, which can be biotic (diseases, pests) or abiotic (environmental). It is crucial to observe the specific patterns and associated symptoms to accurately diagnose the problem.

**Key Observations to Make:**

1.  **Pattern of Drying:** Is it sudden or gradual? Does it affect the whole plant, or specific branches/leaves?
2.  **Stem Base:** Check the stem at the soil line for any lesions, discoloration, or rotting.
3.  **Roots:** Gently dig around the plant to inspect the roots. Are they healthy (white, firm) or discolored, mushy, or sparse?
4.  **Vascular Tissue:** Cut a cross-section of the affected stem. Is there any brown or black discoloration inside the stem (vascular browning)?
5.  **Milky Ooze:** If you cut an affected stem and squeeze it, does a milky white ooze come out? (Indicates bacterial wilt).
6.  **Pest Presence:** Look for any borers, holes, or frass (insect excrement) on the stem or branches.
7.  **Watering History:** Have there been periods of drought or excessive rainfall/waterlogging?
8.  **Recent Applications:** Have any herbicides or strong chemicals been applied recently?

Based on these observations, here are the most common causes and their management strategies for Ridge Gourd in Haryana:

### 1. Fungal Wilts (e.g., Fusarium Wilt)

**Symptoms:**
*   Gradual yellowing and wilting of leaves, often starting from one side of the plant or one branch.
*   Leaves may turn brown and dry, but remain attached to the stem.
*   Vascular tissues inside the stem (when cut) show brown discoloration.
*   Plants eventually collapse and die.

**Management:**
*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Use resistant varieties if available.
    *   Practice crop rotation with non-cucurbit crops for at least 3-4 years.
    *   Ensure good field sanitation; remove and destroy infected plant debris.
    *   Improve soil drainage to prevent waterlogging.
    *   Soil solarization during summer can reduce pathogen inoculum.
*   **Chemical Management (Soil Drenching):**
    *   Drench the soil around the affected plants with:
        *   **Carbendazim 50% WP** at 1-2 g/L of water.
        *   **Thiophanate Methyl 70% WP** at 1-2 g/L of water.
    *   Apply 200-300 ml of the solution per plant, depending on plant size. Repeat after 10-15 days if necessary.

### 2. Bacterial Wilt

**Symptoms:**
*   Sudden wilting of entire plants or individual branches, often without prior yellowing.
*   Leaves may remain green initially but quickly dry up.
*   A characteristic milky white, sticky ooze can be observed when a freshly cut stem is pressed (bacterial streaming test).
*   Vascular discoloration may also be present.

**Management:**
*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Remove and destroy infected plants immediately to prevent spread.
    *   Control cucumber beetles, which are vectors for bacterial wilt.
    *   Practice crop rotation.
    *   Avoid planting in fields with a history of bacterial wilt.
*   **Chemical Management (Soil Drenching/Spray):**
    *   Drench the soil around the plants with a combination of:
        *   **Streptomycin Sulphate 9% + Tetracycline Hydrochloride 1% SP** at 0.5-1 g/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, a foliar spray can be given, but drenching is more effective for systemic diseases.
    *   **Copper Oxychloride 50% WP** at 2-3 g/L of water can also be used as a soil drench or foliar spray.

### 3. Root Rot Complex (e.g., Pythium, Phytophthora, Rhizoctonia)

**Symptoms:**
*   Stunted growth, yellowing, and wilting of leaves, leading to drying.
*   Roots appear discolored (brown/black), soft, and mushy.
*   The plant may easily pull out of the soil due to damaged roots.
*   Often associated with poor drainage and waterlogged conditions.

**Management:**
*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Ensure excellent soil drainage; avoid waterlogging at all costs.
    *   Plant on raised beds in areas prone to waterlogging.
    *   Use well-decomposed farmyard manure to improve soil structure.
    *   Practice crop rotation.
*   **Chemical Management (Soil Drenching):**
    *   Drench the soil around the plants with:
        *   **Propamocarb Hydrochloride 72.2% SL** at 2-3 ml/L of water.
        *   **Metalaxyl 35% WS** (seed treatment or drench) or **Metalaxyl 8% + Mancozeb 64% WP** at 2-2.5 g/L of water.
    *   Apply 200-300 ml of the solution per plant.

### 4. Stem Borers

**Symptoms:**
*   Wilting and drying of individual branches or the entire plant if the main stem is affected.
*   Presence of boreholes on the stem, often with frass (sawdust-like excrement) near the entry point.
*   Tunnels visible inside the stem when cut open.

**Management:**
*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Regularly inspect plants for boreholes and frass.
    *   Remove and destroy affected stems or plants to prevent further spread.
    *   Maintain field sanitation.
*   **Chemical Management (Foliar Spray/Spot Application):**
    *   Spray with a systemic insecticide:
        *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC** at 0.3 ml/L of water.
        *   **Emamectin Benzoate 5% SG** at 0.5 g/L of water.
    *   Direct the spray towards the stem and affected areas.

### 5. Physiological Stress (Water Stress, Heat Stress)

**Symptoms:**
*   **Water Stress (Drought):** Leaves wilt during the day, may recover at night initially. Severe stress leads to permanent wilting, scorching, and drying of leaves, flowers, and fruits.
*   **Waterlogging:** Roots suffocate and rot, leading to wilting, yellowing, and drying of the entire plant, mimicking drought symptoms.
*   **Heat Stress:** Leaves may scorch, wilt, and dry out, especially during peak afternoon hours. Flowers and young fruits may abort or dry up.

**Management:**
*   **Water Stress (Drought):**
    *   Provide adequate and timely irrigation, especially during flowering and fruiting stages.
    *   Use drip irrigation for efficient water use.
    *   Apply mulch (straw, dry leaves) around the plants to conserve soil moisture.
*   **Waterlogging:**
    *   Ensure proper drainage in the field.
    *   Avoid over-irrigation.
    *   Plant on raised beds in low-lying areas.
*   **Heat Stress:**
    *   Provide partial shade during extreme summer months using shade nets (e.g., 30-50% shade).
    *   Ensure consistent soil moisture to help plants cope with heat.
    *   Plant heat-tolerant varieties if available.

It is important to correctly identify the cause before applying any treatment. If you are unsure, please bring a sample of the affected plant to the Department of Plant Pathology or Entomology at HAU, Hisar, for accurate diagnosis and specific recommendations.
