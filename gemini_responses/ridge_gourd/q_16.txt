As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following fertilizer schedule for Ridge Gourd cultivation in Haryana, based on scientific principles and best practices. It is always advisable to conduct a soil test to determine precise nutrient requirements, but these are general recommendations.

**Recommended Fertilizer Doses for Ridge Gourd (per acre):**

**I. Basal Application (at the time of planting/sowing):**

*   **DAP:** 130 kg/acre
    *   *(Provides Phosphorus and a portion of Nitrogen)*
*   **Potash** (Muriate of Potash, 60% K2O): 50 kg/acre
    *   *(Provides half of the total Potassium requirement)*
*   **Urea:** 20-25 kg/acre
    *   *(Provides initial Nitrogen for early growth)*
*   **Sulphur** (elemental, 90%): 20-25 kg/acre
    *   *(Essential for oil synthesis and overall plant health, especially if not using SSP)*

**II. Top Dressing Applications:**

**A. First Top Dressing (30-35 days after planting):**

*   **Urea:** 50-55 kg/acre
    *   *(For vigorous vegetative growth)*
*   **Potash** (Muriate of Potash, 60% K2O): 50 kg/acre
    *   *(Provides the remaining half of the total Potassium requirement)*

**B. Second Top Dressing (45-50 days after planting, at flowering/fruiting initiation):**

*   **Urea:** 40-45 kg/acre
    *   *(Supports flowering and initial fruit development)*

**III. Nano-Fertilizers (Foliar Application):**

Nano-fertilizers offer efficient nutrient delivery and can supplement conventional fertilizer applications.

*   **Nano-Urea:**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml/L of water.
    *   **Application:** Apply 2-3 foliar sprays. The first spray can be given 30-35 days after planting, and subsequent sprays at 15-20 day intervals, especially during vegetative growth and early flowering.
*   **Nano-DAP:**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml/L of water.
    *   **Application:** Apply 1-2 foliar sprays. The first spray can be given at the pre-flowering stage, and the second during early fruit development.

**IV. NPK Complex Fertilizers:**

While the above schedule uses individual fertilizers, **NPK** complex fertilizers can also be used.

*   **For Basal Application (as an alternative to DAP, Urea, Potash combination):**
    *   **NPK 12:32:16:** Approximately 180-200 kg/acre can be applied as basal, adjusting subsequent Urea and Potash applications accordingly.
*   **For Foliar Application:**
    *   **NPK 19:19:19** (or similar balanced NPK):
        *   **Dose:** 5 g/L of water.
        *   **Application:** Can be sprayed during active vegetative growth or early flowering stages to provide a balanced nutrient boost.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Soil Testing:** Always recommended for precise fertilizer recommendations tailored to your specific field conditions.
*   **Organic Matter:** Incorporating well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost (20-25 tonnes/acre) significantly improves soil health and nutrient availability, reducing the need for chemical fertilizers.
*   **Irrigation:** Ensure adequate moisture in the soil before and after fertilizer application for efficient nutrient uptake.
