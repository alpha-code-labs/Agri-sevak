As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified seed and soil treatment processes for Ridge Gourd cultivation in Haryana:

### Recommended Seed Treatment for Ridge Gourd

Seed treatment is crucial for protecting young seedlings from soil-borne diseases and early insect pests, ensuring better germination and vigorous initial growth.

*   **Fungicidal Treatment (for protection against damping-off, seed rot, and early blight):**
    *   Option 1: Treat seeds with **Carbendazim 50% WP** at 2 grams per kilogram of seed.
    *   Option 2: Treat seeds with **Thiram 75% WS** at 2.5-3 grams per kilogram of seed.
    *   Option 3 (for specific protection against downy mildew and damping-off): Treat seeds with **Metalaxyl-M 35% WS** at 6 grams per kilogram of seed.
    *   *Method:* Mix the fungicide thoroughly with the seeds until they are uniformly coated.

*   **Insecticidal Treatment (for protection against early sucking pests like aphids, whiteflies, and thrips):**
    *   Option 1: Treat seeds with **Imidacloprid 70% WS** at 5-7 grams per kilogram of seed.
    *   Option 2: Treat seeds with **Thiamethoxam 30% FS** at 4-6 ml per kilogram of seed.
    *   *Method:* Apply the insecticide after the fungicidal treatment, ensuring uniform coating. Allow seeds to dry in shade before sowing.

*   **Bio-agent Treatment (for enhanced disease resistance and nutrient availability):**
    *   **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum (1% WP)**: Treat seeds at 4-5 grams per kilogram of seed. This helps in suppressing soil-borne fungal diseases.
    *   **PSB (Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria) / KMB (Potash Mobilizing Bacteria)**: Treat seeds at 10-20 grams per kilogram of seed. These promote nutrient uptake.
    *   *Method:* Apply bio-agents as the final step, after chemical treatments and drying. Mix the bio-agent with a small amount of jaggery solution (gur) to make a slurry, coat the seeds, and dry them in shade before sowing.

### Recommended Soil Treatment for Ridge Gourd

Soil treatment aims to manage soil-borne pathogens, nematodes, and improve overall soil health and fertility.

*   **Bio-agent Application (for disease suppression and soil health):**
    *   **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum (1% WP)**: Apply 2.5 kilograms per acre. Mix the bio-agent thoroughly with 50-100 kilograms of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost. Keep the mixture moist for 7-10 days in a shaded area before broadcasting it evenly over the field and incorporating it into the soil during the final land preparation, at least 7-10 days before planting. This helps in managing damping-off, root rot, and wilt diseases.
    *   **Pseudomonas fluorescens (1% WP)**: Apply 2.5 kilograms per acre, mixed with 50-100 kilograms of FYM/compost, following the same method as for Trichoderma. This promotes plant growth and suppresses various soil-borne pathogens.
    *   **Paecilomyces lilacinus** or **Purpureocillium lilacinum (1% WP)**: If nematode problems are known, apply 2.5 kilograms per acre, mixed with 50-100 kilograms of FYM/compost, following the same method. This bio-nematicide helps in managing plant-parasitic nematodes.

*   **Chemical Nematicide/Insecticide (if severe soil pest/nematode issues are identified):**
    *   **Fipronil 0.3% GR**: Apply 10-15 kilograms per acre. This granular formulation can be applied at the time of planting or sowing by broadcasting and incorporating it into the soil. It helps in managing soil insects and offers some suppression of nematodes.
    *   *Note:* Chemical nematicides should be used judiciously and only when bio-agent approaches are insufficient or in cases of severe infestation, following proper safety guidelines.
