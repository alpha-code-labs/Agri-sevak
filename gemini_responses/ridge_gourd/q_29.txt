Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding dropping in Ridge Gourd. Flower and fruit drop are common physiological issues in cucurbits, including Ridge Gourd, and can significantly impact yield.

Regarding "Tinda/Boll dropping," please note that Tinda (Indian Round Gourd) is a different crop, and "boll" refers to the fruit of cotton. However, if you are referring to the dropping of immature fruits in Ridge Gourd, the advice for fruit drop will be applicable.

Dropping in Ridge Gourd is often a symptom of underlying stress or imbalance. Here's a scientifically verified approach to control it:

**Causes of Dropping:**

The primary reasons for flower and fruit drop in Ridge Gourd include:
*   **Environmental Stress:** High or low temperatures, sudden temperature fluctuations, water stress (drought or waterlogging), high humidity, or very low humidity.
*   **Nutritional Deficiencies:** Lack of essential micronutrients like Boron, Calcium, and Zinc, or an imbalance of macronutrients.
*   **Poor Pollination:** Insufficient pollinator activity (e.g., bees), adverse weather during flowering, or lack of viable pollen.
*   **Hormonal Imbalance:** Imbalance of plant growth regulators (PGRs) within the plant.
*   **Pest and Disease:** Severe infestations or infections can weaken the plant, leading to dropping.
*   **Overbearing:** The plant may naturally shed excess flowers or fruits if it cannot support their development.

**Control Measures:**

Effective control involves a combination of good agronomic practices and targeted chemical interventions.

**A. Agronomic Practices (Preventive & Supportive):**

1.  **Optimal Water Management:**
    *   Ensure consistent soil moisture. Both water stress (drought) and waterlogging can cause dropping.
    *   Irrigate regularly, especially during flowering and fruiting stages, to maintain adequate moisture without waterlogging.
2.  **Balanced Nutrition:**
    *   Conduct soil testing to determine nutrient status.
    *   Apply balanced fertilizers as per HAU recommendations for Ridge Gourd.
    *   Ensure adequate supply of Phosphorus and Potassium.
    *   Pay special attention to micronutrients, particularly Boron and Calcium.
3.  **Enhance Pollination:**
    *   Encourage pollinator activity by avoiding insecticide sprays during peak flowering hours.
    *   Consider placing bee hives near the field.
    *   In small-scale cultivation or under adverse conditions, hand pollination can be done in the early morning.
4.  **Temperature Management:**
    *   Provide light shade during extreme high temperatures if feasible, especially for young plants.
    *   Mulching can help regulate soil temperature and conserve moisture.
5.  **Pest and Disease Control:**
    *   Regularly monitor for pests and diseases. A healthy plant is less prone to dropping.
    *   Implement integrated pest and disease management strategies.

**B. Chemical Interventions (Specific & Targeted):**

These interventions should be used as supplementary measures after addressing the primary agronomic factors. Always ensure proper spray coverage and follow label instructions.

1.  **Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs):**
    *   **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA):**
        *   **Dosage:** 10-20 mg/L of water (10-20 ppm).
        *   **Application:** Spray at the pre-flowering stage and again at the fruit-setting stage to prevent flower and fruit drop.
    *   **Gibberellic Acid (GA3):**
        *   **Dosage:** 10-25 mg/L of water (10-25 ppm).
        *   **Application:** Spray at the early flowering stage to promote fruit set and reduce dropping, especially under stress conditions.

2.  **Micronutrients:**
    *   **Boron:**
        *   **Dosage:** Foliar spray of **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (20% Boron) at 0.5-1 g/L of water, or **Borax** (10.5% Boron) at 1-1.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Application:** Spray at the pre-flowering stage and repeat after 15-20 days if deficiency symptoms persist or conditions are conducive to deficiency. Boron is crucial for pollen viability and fruit set.
    *   **Calcium:**
        *   **Dosage:** Foliar spray of **Calcium Nitrate** (18.8% Calcium) at 3-5 g/L of water.
        *   **Application:** Apply during flowering and early fruit development stages, especially if symptoms of calcium deficiency (like blossom end rot) are observed or anticipated. Calcium is vital for cell wall integrity and fruit development.
    *   **Chelated Micronutrient Mix:**
        *   **Dosage:** As per product label, typically 1-2 g/L of water.
        *   **Application:** A general spray of a good quality chelated micronutrient mixture can address multiple minor deficiencies that might contribute to plant stress and dropping.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Timing is crucial:** Apply sprays at the recommended stages for maximum effectiveness.
*   **Proper Dosage:** Always adhere to the recommended dosages. Overdosing PGRs or micronutrients can be detrimental.
*   **Spray Coverage:** Ensure thorough wetting of the foliage for effective absorption.
*   **Consult HAU Experts:** For specific field conditions or persistent problems, it is always advisable to consult with HAU agronomists for tailored advice.

By implementing these scientifically verified practices, you can significantly reduce flower and fruit dropping in your Ridge Gourd crop and achieve better yields.
