Mites, including Red Spider Mite (Tetranychus urticae) and various Rust Mites (Eriophyidae family), are significant pests of Ridge Gourd in Haryana, especially during hot and dry weather. They can cause considerable damage by sucking sap from leaves, leading to reduced photosynthesis, stunted growth, and decreased yield.

**Symptoms of Mite Infestation:**

*   **Red Spider Mite:** Fine webbing on the underside of leaves, yellowing or bronzing of leaves, tiny red or yellowish mites visible with a hand lens, and eventual leaf drop.
*   **Rust Mite:** Bronzing or russeting of leaves, especially on the underside, and sometimes distortion of young leaves and fruits. Mites are microscopic and not easily visible without magnification.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Mites in Ridge Gourd:**

An integrated approach combining cultural, mechanical, and chemical methods is recommended for effective and sustainable mite control.

1.  **Cultural and Mechanical Practices:**
    *   **Regular Monitoring:** Inspect plants frequently, especially the underside of leaves, for early signs of mite infestation.
    *   **Water Sprays:** Strong jets of water can dislodge mites from the plant surface, especially on the underside of leaves. This can be effective for light infestations.
    *   **Weed Management:** Remove weeds around the field as they can act as alternate hosts for mites.
    *   **Pruning:** Remove severely infested leaves or plant parts and destroy them to reduce mite populations.
    *   **Proper Irrigation:** Ensure adequate irrigation to avoid water stress, which can make plants more susceptible to mite attacks.

2.  **Chemical Control (Acaricides/Miticides):**
    When mite populations are high and cultural methods are insufficient, chemical control becomes necessary. Always rotate chemicals with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Apply sprays thoroughly, ensuring coverage on the underside of leaves where mites primarily reside.

    The following CIBRC approved technical chemicals are recommended:

    *   **For Red Spider Mite and Rust Mite:**
        *   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** Apply at **0.5 - 0.75 ml/L** of water (or **125 - 180 ml/acre**). This is effective against all life stages (eggs, nymphs, and adults).
        *   **Propargite 57% EC:** Apply at **2.0 - 2.5 ml/L** of water (or **1.0 - 1.25 L/acre**). This is effective against nymphs and adults.
        *   **Abamectin 1.9% EC:** Apply at **0.5 - 0.75 ml/L** of water (or **150 - 200 ml/acre**). This has translaminar action, reaching mites on the underside of leaves, and is effective against both mites and leaf miners.
        *   **Fenpyroximate 5% SC:** Apply at **1.0 - 1.5 ml/L** of water (or **300 - 400 ml/acre**). This is effective against eggs, nymphs, and adults.
        *   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP:** Apply at **2.5 - 3.0 g/L** of water (or **1.0 - 1.5 kg/acre**). This is a contact miticide, effective against early stages of mites and also helps control powdery mildew. Avoid spraying when temperatures are very high (above 35°C) as it can cause phytotoxicity.

    **Important Considerations:**
    *   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label, including dosage, mixing instructions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
    *   Ensure thorough coverage of the plant, especially the underside of leaves.
    *   Rotate different classes of miticides to prevent resistance development.
    *   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying.
