As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in Ridge Gourd in Haryana:

### Control of Grasshopper in Ridge Gourd

Grasshoppers are polyphagous pests that can cause significant damage to Ridge Gourd by feeding on leaves, stems, and sometimes young fruits, leading to defoliation and reduced yield.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Maintain field sanitation by regularly removing weeds from the field and surrounding areas, as weeds serve as alternate hosts and breeding grounds for grasshoppers.
    *   Deep ploughing after harvest can expose grasshopper eggs to predators and adverse weather conditions.
*   **Chemical Control (Apply when pest incidence is observed):**
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Fipronil** 5% SC at 1.5-2 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Malathion** 50% EC at 2 ml per litre of water.

### Control of Painted Bug in Ridge Gourd

This is not known to affect Ridge Gourd. The Painted bug (primarily *Bagrada hilaris*) is a significant pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., mustard, cabbage, cauliflower) and is not a primary pest of cucurbits like Ridge Gourd.

### Control of Red Cotton Bug in Ridge Gourd

This is not known to affect Ridge Gourd. The Red cotton bug (*Dysdercus cingulatus*) is primarily a pest of cotton and other malvaceous plants and is not a primary pest of cucurbits like Ridge Gourd.

### Control of Black Ants in Ridge Gourd

Black ants are generally not direct pests of Ridge Gourd. Their presence on plants is often an indication of other sap-sucking pests like aphids, mealybugs, or scale insects, as ants feed on the honeydew secreted by these pests. Ants also protect these sap-sucking pests from their natural enemies.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Indirect Control:** The most effective way to manage ants on Ridge Gourd is to control the primary sap-sucking pests that they are tending to. Once the sap-sucking pests are eliminated, the ants will naturally disappear due to the lack of honeydew.
    *   For sap-sucking pests, consider insecticides like **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL at 0.5 ml per litre of water or **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG at 0.2 g per litre of water.
*   **Direct Control (If ants are nesting and causing root disturbance or are a significant nuisance):**
    *   For ant nests around the base of the plants, a drench application can be considered:
        *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 2.5 ml per litre of water, applied as a drench around the base of the affected plants.
    *   For ants actively crawling on the plant surface, a general insecticide spray can deter them:
        *   **Fipronil** 5% SC at 1.5-2 ml per litre of water.

Always ensure proper safety measures, including wearing protective gear, when handling and applying pesticides. Follow the instructions on the product label for dosage, application method, and pre-harvest interval.
