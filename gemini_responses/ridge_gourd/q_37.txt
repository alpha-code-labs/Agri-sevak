Protecting Ridge Gourd from wild animals is a significant challenge for farmers in Haryana. A multi-pronged approach combining physical barriers, traditional repellents, and vigilant monitoring is often most effective. Chemical repellents specifically approved by CIBRC for repelling large wild animals from field crops are generally not available or widely recommended due to limited efficacy and practical challenges. Therefore, the focus is primarily on non-chemical methods:

*   **Physical Barriers:**
    *   **Fencing:**
        *   **Barbed Wire Fencing:** A common and relatively inexpensive method. Multiple strands (5-7) at different heights can deter animals like nilgai and wild boar.
        *   **Electric Fencing:** Highly effective against larger animals like wild boar and nilgai. It delivers a non-lethal shock, deterring them from entering. Ensure proper installation and safety measures as per local regulations.
        *   **Net Fencing:** For smaller animals like monkeys or birds, a strong nylon or wire mesh net can be used, especially around the crop area.
    *   **Trenching:** Digging a trench around the field (e.g., 1 meter deep and 0.5 meter wide) can deter wild boars from burrowing under fences.

*   **Traditional and Non-Chemical Repellents:**
    *   **Scarecrows and Reflective Devices:** Placing scarecrows, old clothes, or reflective tapes/CDs can deter birds and sometimes monkeys. Their effectiveness is often temporary as animals habituate.
    *   **Sound Devices:** Using crackers, drums, or other noise-making devices at irregular intervals can scare away animals, especially during vulnerable periods (e.g., fruiting).
    *   **Strong Odour Repellents:**
        *   **Human Hair:** Spreading human hair around the field can deter some animals due to the unfamiliar scent.
        *   **Fermented Mixtures:** A mixture of cow dung, cow urine, and fermented buttermilk or other strong-smelling substances can be sprayed or placed around the field boundaries.
        *   **Neem-based preparations:** While primarily used for pest management, the strong smell of neem cake spread around the field or diluted neem oil (e.g., 5 ml/L water) sprayed on boundary plants can sometimes offer a mild deterrent effect against certain animals.

*   **Vigilance and Monitoring:**
    *   **Regular Patrolling:** Farmers or farm laborers patrolling the fields, especially during dawn, dusk, and night, can effectively deter animals.
    *   **Community Approach:** Coordinated efforts with neighboring farmers to patrol and implement deterrents can be more effective than individual efforts.

*   **Other Strategies:**
    *   **Guard Dogs:** Trained guard dogs can be very effective in deterring wild animals.
    *   **Habitat Management:** Clearing bushes and weeds around the field boundaries reduces hiding places for animals.
