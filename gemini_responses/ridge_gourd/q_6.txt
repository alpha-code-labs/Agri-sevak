As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I must emphasize that viral diseases in plants are not curable once the plant is infected. Therefore, the primary focus for control is on prevention, managing the vectors that transmit these viruses, and adopting good cultural practices.

Here's how to control the mentioned conditions in Ridge Gourd:

### Viral Diseases Affecting Ridge Gourd (Leaf Curl, Mosaic, Yellow Vein Clearing)

These viral diseases are significant concerns for Ridge Gourd cultivation in Haryana. They are primarily transmitted by insect vectors like whiteflies and aphids.

**1. Leaf Curl Virus (e.g., Tomato Leaf Curl New Delhi Virus - ToLCNDV):**
*   **Symptoms:** Upward or downward curling of leaves, puckering, vein thickening, stunted plant growth, and reduced fruit size and yield.
*   **Vector:** Whiteflies (Bemisia tabaci).

**2. Mosaic Virus (e.g., Cucumber Mosaic Virus - CMV, Zucchini Yellow Mosaic Virus - ZYMV, Watermelon Mosaic Virus - WMV):**
*   **Symptoms:** Mottling, blistering, and distortion of leaves, stunted growth, and malformed fruits with mosaic patterns.
*   **Vector:** Aphids (various species).

**3. Yellow Vein Clearing Virus:**
*   **Symptoms:** Yellowing of veins, which can spread to interveinal areas, leading to overall yellowing and reduced photosynthetic activity.
*   **Vector:** Primarily whiteflies.

**Control Measures for Leaf Curl, Mosaic, and Yellow Vein Clearing Viruses:**

*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available, choose Ridge Gourd varieties known to have resistance or tolerance to these viruses. Consult with local HAU experts or KVKs for suitable varieties.
*   **Vector Management (Crucial for Prevention):**
    *   **Whitefly Control (for Leaf Curl and Yellow Vein Clearing):**
        *   **Cultural Practices:**
            *   Install yellow sticky traps (15-20 traps per acre) to monitor and trap adult whiteflies.
            *   Remove and destroy infected plants immediately to prevent further spread (roguing).
            *   Maintain field sanitation by removing weeds, which can act as alternate hosts for viruses and vectors.
            *   Use insect-proof nets in nurseries for raising healthy seedlings.
            *   Apply mulches (e.g., silver-colored plastic mulch) to repel whiteflies.
        *   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
            *   **Imidacloprid** (17.8% SL) at 0.5-1 ml/L water.
            *   **Thiamethoxam** (25% WG) at 0.2-0.4 g/L water.
            *   **Acetamiprid** (20% SP) at 0.2-0.4 g/L water.
            *   **Buprofezin** (25% SC) at 1.25-1.5 ml/L water (targets nymphs).
            *   **Spiromesifen** (22.9% SC) at 0.5-0.75 ml/L water (targets nymphs and adults).
            *   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.
    *   **Aphid Control (for Mosaic Viruses):**
        *   **Cultural Practices:**
            *   Install yellow sticky traps (15-20 traps per acre).
            *   Remove and destroy infected plants immediately.
            *   Maintain field sanitation by removing weeds.
        *   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
            *   **Imidacloprid** (17.8% SL) at 0.5-1 ml/L water.
            *   **Thiamethoxam** (25% WG) at 0.2-0.4 g/L water.
            *   **Acetamiprid** (20% SP) at 0.2-0.4 g/L water.
            *   **Flonicamid** (50% WG) at 0.3 g/L water.
            *   **Pymetrozine** (50% WG) at 0.3 g/L water.
            *   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action.
*   **Seed Treatment:** While most cucurbit viruses are not seed-borne, some can be. Use certified, virus-free seeds.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting Ridge Gourd or other cucurbits in the same field consecutively. Rotate with non-host crops.
*   **Sanitation:** Clean tools and equipment regularly to prevent mechanical transmission of viruses.

### Other Listed Conditions:

*   **Stripe virus:** This is not known to affect Ridge Gourd as a distinct viral entity. Stripe-like symptoms, if observed, are usually associated with other mosaic or viral infections.
*   **Tristeza virus:** This is not known to affect Ridge Gourd. Citrus Tristeza Virus (CTV) primarily affects citrus species.
*   **Stunt virus:** This is not known to affect Ridge Gourd as a distinct viral entity. Stunting is a common symptom caused by various viral infections (e.g., Leaf Curl, Mosaic viruses) and other abiotic stresses. The control measures for Leaf Curl and Mosaic viruses will help mitigate stunting caused by these pathogens.

Always consult the product label for specific dosage recommendations and safety precautions before applying any chemical.
