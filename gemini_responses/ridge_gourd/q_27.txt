As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the suitable climate, soil type, and drainage requirements for Ridge Gourd (Luffa acutangula) in Haryana:

*   **Climate:**
    *   Ridge Gourd is a warm-season crop that thrives in hot and humid conditions.
    *   It requires a long, warm growing season.
    *   The optimal temperature range for vigorous growth and good fruit set is generally between 25°C and 35°C.
    *   Temperatures below 15°C can hinder growth and fruit development, while frost is detrimental to the crop.
    *   High humidity is also beneficial for its growth.

*   **Soil Type:**
    *   Ridge Gourd can be grown on a wide range of soils, but it performs best in fertile, well-drained soils.
    *   Ideal soil types include sandy loam to clay loam soils.
    *   The soil should be rich in organic matter to support healthy plant growth and fruit production.
    *   A soil pH range of 6.0 to 7.0 is considered optimal for Ridge Gourd cultivation.

*   **Drainage Requirement:**
    *   Excellent drainage is crucial for Ridge Gourd cultivation.
    *   The crop is highly sensitive to waterlogging, which can lead to root rot and significant yield losses.
    *   Soils with good internal drainage are essential to prevent water accumulation around the root zone, especially during periods of heavy rainfall or irrigation.
    *   Raised beds are often recommended in areas prone to waterlogging to ensure adequate drainage.
