As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling soil pests like termites and nematodes (root-knot) in Ridge Gourd in Haryana. An integrated pest management (IPM) approach, combining cultural practices with judicious chemical use, is always recommended for sustainable control.

### Control of Termites in Ridge Gourd

Termites (e.g., *Odontotermes obesus*, *Microtermes obesi*) can cause significant damage by feeding on roots and stems, leading to wilting and plant death.

**Cultural and Preventive Measures:**
*   **Deep Ploughing:** Plough the field deeply during summer to expose termite queens and nests to sunlight and predators.
*   **Remove Crop Residues:** Clear the field of all crop residues, stubble, and woody debris, which can serve as food sources for termites.
*   **Well-Decomposed FYM:** Use only well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost, as undecomposed organic matter can attract termites.
*   **Proper Irrigation:** Maintain adequate soil moisture, as termites generally prefer dry soil conditions.
*   **Avoid Waterlogging:** Ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging, which can stress plants and make them more susceptible.

**Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved):**
For severe infestations, chemical control can be applied as a pre-sowing treatment or at the time of planting.
*   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC:** Apply as a soil drench at the rate of **2.5 litres per acre** mixed in 400-500 litres of water, either before sowing or at the time of planting.
*   **Fipronil 0.3% GR:** Apply as a soil application at the rate of **6.6-10 kg per acre** at the time of sowing or planting.

### Control of Nematodes (Root-Knot Nematodes) in Ridge Gourd

Root-knot nematodes (*Meloidogyne* species) are microscopic worms that infect plant roots, causing characteristic galls or knots. This impairs water and nutrient uptake, leading to stunted growth, yellowing, and reduced yield.

**Cultural and Preventive Measures:**
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops such as cereals (wheat, maize, sorghum) for at least 2-3 years. Avoid continuous cultivation of susceptible vegetables.
*   **Summer Solarization:** During the hot summer months, plough the field and cover it with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks. This raises soil temperature, killing nematodes and other soil-borne pathogens.
*   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporate organic matter like neem cake (**200-400 kg per acre**) or well-decomposed FYM into the soil. These improve soil health and promote beneficial microorganisms that antagonize nematodes.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** If available, choose Ridge Gourd varieties known to have resistance or tolerance to root-knot nematodes.
*   **Field Hygiene:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris to prevent the build-up of nematode populations.

**Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved):**
Chemical nematicides can be applied as a pre-sowing treatment or at the time of planting.
*   **Carbofuran 3% GR:** Apply as a soil application at the rate of **13.3 kg per acre** at the time of sowing or transplanting.
*   **Phorate 10% GR:** Apply as a soil application at the rate of **4 kg per acre** at the time of sowing or transplanting.
*   **Fluensulfone 2% GR:** Apply as a soil application at the rate of **10 kg per acre** at the time of sowing or transplanting.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully, including dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) for any applied chemical to ensure the safety of the produce.
*   An integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods is most effective for long-term pest management.
