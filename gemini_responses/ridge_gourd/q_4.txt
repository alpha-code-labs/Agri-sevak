Wilt, including Parawilt, can be a significant challenge in Ridge Gourd cultivation, leading to substantial yield losses. As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend an integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods for effective management.

**Understanding Wilt and Parawilt:**

*   **Wilt:** Primarily caused by soil-borne fungi (e.g., *Fusarium oxysporum*) or bacteria (e.g., *Ralstonia solanacearum*). These pathogens infect the roots and block the water-conducting tissues, leading to wilting and eventual plant death.
*   **Parawilt:** This term often refers to a sudden wilting of plants that may not be directly caused by a specific vascular pathogen. It can be due to physiological stress (e.g., sudden temperature fluctuations, waterlogging followed by drought, nutrient imbalances), root damage, or sometimes severe root rot caused by other soil-borne pathogens like *Pythium* or *Phytophthora*.

**Control Measures for Wilt (Fungal and Bacterial) and Parawilt in Ridge Gourd:**

**1. Cultural Practices (Most Crucial for Prevention):**

*   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting Ridge Gourd or other cucurbits in the same field for at least 3-4 years. Rotate with non-host crops like cereals (wheat, maize) or pulses.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available, choose Ridge Gourd varieties known for their resistance or tolerance to wilt diseases. Consult local HAU recommendations for suitable varieties.
*   **Soil Solarization:** During the hot summer months (May-June), plough the field, irrigate it, and cover it with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks. This raises soil temperature, killing many soil-borne pathogens, including wilt-causing fungi and bacteria.
*   **Proper Drainage:** Ensure good field drainage to prevent waterlogging, which stresses roots and favors the development of root rot pathogens that can mimic wilt.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced fertilizers based on soil test reports. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can make plants more susceptible.
*   **Avoid Root Injury:** Be careful during intercultural operations (weeding, earthing up) to prevent damage to the roots, as wounds serve as entry points for pathogens.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plants immediately to prevent the spread of pathogens. Do not compost infected plant material.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** Deep summer ploughing exposes soil-borne pathogens to the sun, reducing their population.

**2. Biological Control:**

*   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds before sowing with bio-control agents.
    *   **Trichoderma viride:** 4-6 g/kg seed.
    *   **Pseudomonas fluorescens:** 10 g/kg seed.
*   **Soil Application/Drench:**
    *   Mix **Trichoderma viride** (2.5 kg/acre) or **Pseudomonas fluorescens** (2.5 kg/acre) with 50-100 kg of farmyard manure (FYM) or vermicompost. Keep it moist for 7-10 days in a shaded area, then broadcast evenly in the field before planting or apply as a soil drench around the root zone of established plants.

**3. Chemical Control (Use Judiciously):**

*   **Seed Treatment (for Fungal Wilt Prevention):**
    *   **Carbendazim** 12% + **Mancozeb** 63% WP: 2-3 g/kg seed.
    *   **Thiram** 75% WS: 2.5-3 g/kg seed.
*   **Soil Drench (for Fungal Wilt):**
    *   At the first sign of wilting, drench the soil around the base of the affected plants with:
        *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: 1 g/L of water (apply 200-250 ml solution per plant).
        *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride** 72.2% SL: 2.5 ml/L of water (effective against oomycete-related root rots that can cause wilting).
*   **For Bacterial Wilt (if confirmed):**
    *   **Streptomycin sulphate** 9% + **Tetracycline hydrochloride** 1% SP: 0.6 g/L of water as a soil drench. This is generally less effective once the disease is established, so prevention is key.

**Specific Considerations for Parawilt:**

If Parawilt is suspected to be physiological or due to root stress rather than a specific pathogen, focus on:
*   Ensuring optimal soil moisture (avoiding both waterlogging and severe drought).
*   Providing balanced nutrients.
*   Minimizing root disturbance.
*   If root rot is suspected to be the cause of parawilt, fungicides like **Propamocarb hydrochloride** or **Copper oxychloride** (2 g/L water as a drench) can be considered, especially if oomycete pathogens are involved.

Always follow the instructions on the chemical labels for dosage and safety precautions. For specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions, please consult with the experts at HAU, Hisar.
