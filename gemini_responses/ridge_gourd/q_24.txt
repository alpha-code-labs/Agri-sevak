As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with the ideal practices for Ridge Gourd transplantation in Haryana.

### Ideal Transplantation Time for Ridge Gourd in Haryana

Ridge Gourd is a warm-season crop and can be successfully grown in two main seasons in Haryana:

*   **Spring-Summer Crop:** Transplant seedlings raised in **February-March**. This timing allows for harvesting during the hot summer months. Ensure the risk of frost has completely passed.
*   **Rainy Season (Kharif) Crop:** Transplant seedlings raised in **June-July**. This timing allows for harvesting during the autumn and early winter. Care should be taken to manage waterlogging during heavy monsoon rains.

### Ideal Transplantation Distance for Ridge Gourd

Proper spacing is crucial for optimal growth, air circulation, sunlight penetration, and ease of harvesting, especially when training the vines on a support system.

*   **Row-to-Row Distance:** 2.0 - 3.0 meters
*   **Plant-to-Plant Distance:** 0.6 - 1.0 meter

This spacing is recommended for training the Ridge Gourd vines on a trellis or pandal system, which is highly advisable for better fruit quality, higher yields, and reduced incidence of soil-borne diseases.

### Ideal Transplantation Process for Ridge Gourd

Follow these steps for successful transplantation of Ridge Gourd seedlings:

1.  **Nursery Raising:**
    *   Sow Ridge Gourd seeds in nursery beds or pro-trays approximately 3-4 weeks before the intended transplanting date.
    *   Ensure seedlings have developed 2-4 true leaves and are robust and healthy before they are ready for transplanting.
2.  **Field Preparation:**
    *   Prepare the main field by thorough ploughing and harrowing to achieve a fine, loose soil tilth.
    *   Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost at a rate of 20-25 tonnes/acre during land preparation to enrich the soil fertility.
    *   Form ridges and furrows or raised beds according to your chosen irrigation method and the plan for your support system.
3.  **Hardening Off:**
    *   Gradually expose the seedlings to outdoor conditions (e.g., reduced watering, increased sunlight exposure) for 5-7 days prior to transplanting. This process, known as hardening off, helps the seedlings adapt to the harsher field environment and reduces transplant shock.
4.  **Watering Nursery:**
    *   Thoroughly water the nursery beds or pro-trays a few hours before transplanting. This makes it easier to extract seedlings with an intact root ball, minimizing root damage.
5.  **Transplanting:**
    *   Transplant seedlings preferably in the late afternoon or evening, or on a cloudy day, to minimize stress from direct sunlight and heat.
    *   Carefully remove seedlings from the nursery, ensuring minimal disturbance to their root system.
    *   Plant one seedling per spot at the recommended spacing.
    *   Ensure the entire root ball is covered with soil, and gently firm the soil around the base of each plant.
6.  **Immediate Irrigation:**
    *   Immediately after transplanting, provide light irrigation to help settle the soil around the roots and further reduce transplant shock.
7.  **Support System Installation:**
    *   Install a trellis, pandal, or other suitable support system within 1-2 weeks after transplanting. Ridge Gourd is a vigorous climber, and providing timely support is essential for optimal growth, proper fruit development, and ease of harvesting.
