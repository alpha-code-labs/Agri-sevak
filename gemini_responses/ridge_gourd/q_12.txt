As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an integrated pest management (IPM) approach for effective control of Scale insects and Mealybugs in Ridge Gourd. These sap-sucking pests can cause significant damage, leading to stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, and the development of sooty mold due to honeydew secretion.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Approach:**

1.  **Regular Scouting:** Regularly inspect your Ridge Gourd plants, especially the undersides of leaves, stem joints, and fruit calyx, for early signs of scale insects and mealybugs. Early detection is crucial for effective management.

2.  **Field Sanitation:**
    *   Remove and destroy any heavily infested plant parts (leaves, stems, fruits).
    *   Keep the field free of weeds, as they can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
    *   Remove crop residues after harvest.

3.  **Mechanical Control:**
    *   For small infestations, a strong jet of water can dislodge mealybugs and young scales from the plants.
    *   Manually remove and crush visible colonies of mealybugs or scales using gloved hands.

4.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Encourage natural enemies such as ladybird beetles, lacewings, and parasitic wasps, which prey on or parasitize scale insects and mealybugs. Avoid using broad-spectrum insecticides that can harm these beneficial insects.

5.  **Chemical Control:**
    When pest populations are high and other methods are insufficient, chemical control may be necessary. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and in crevices where these pests hide.

    **Recommended CIBRC Approved Insecticides:**

    *   **For early infestations or as a soft option:**
        *   **Horticultural mineral oil:** Apply at 10-20 ml/L of water. Ensure thorough coverage. Avoid spraying during very hot conditions (above 30°C) to prevent phytotoxicity.

    *   **For moderate to severe infestations:**
        *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at 1.25-1.5 ml/L of water (or 500-600 ml/acre). This is an insect growth regulator, highly effective against the nymphal stages of both scales and mealybugs.
        *   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:** Apply at 0.75-1 ml/L of water (or 200-250 ml/acre). This is a systemic insecticide that moves both upwards and downwards in the plant, providing excellent control of hidden pests.
        *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at 0.5-1 ml/L of water (or 100-125 ml/acre). A systemic insecticide effective against a wide range of sucking pests.
        *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at 0.2-0.4 g/L of water (or 50-100 g/acre). Another systemic option, effective against sucking pests.
        *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply at 0.2-0.4 g/L of water (or 100-125 g/acre). A systemic insecticide that provides good control of sucking pests.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and strictly follow the label instructions of the specific product for correct dosage, application method, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and safety precautions.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during the handling and application of any chemical.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension specialist for the most current recommendations and specific pest outbreaks in your area of Haryana.
