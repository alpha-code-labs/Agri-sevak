As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified recommendations for the use of growth regulators and micronutrients in Ridge Gourd in Haryana:

*   **Ethephon** (formerly known by the brand name Ethrel):
    *   **Purpose**: To promote female flower production, leading to higher fruit set and yield.
    *   **Recommended Dose**: 100-250 ppm (parts per million) or **0.1-0.25 g/L** of water.
    *   **Application Timing**: Spray at the 2-4 true leaf stage of the plant. A second spray can be given after 7-10 days if needed.

*   **2,4-D**:
    *   **Recommendation**: **2,4-D** is primarily a selective herbicide. While it has auxin-like properties at extremely low concentrations, its use as a growth regulator in Ridge Gourd is generally **not recommended** due to a very narrow safety margin. Application at effective concentrations for growth regulation often leads to severe phytotoxicity, malformation of leaves and fruits, and reduced yield. Therefore, its use for this purpose is discouraged.

*   **Boron**:
    *   **Purpose**: Boron is an essential micronutrient crucial for pollen germination, fruit set, and overall plant development. Foliar application can correct deficiencies and improve yield.
    *   **Recommended Dose**: 100-200 ppm of Boron. This can be achieved by dissolving **1-2 g/L** of Borax (11% Boron) or **0.6-1.2 g/L** of Solubor (17.5% Boron) in water.
    *   **Application Timing**: Spray before flowering (at the bud initiation stage) and again at the early fruit setting stage. Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.
