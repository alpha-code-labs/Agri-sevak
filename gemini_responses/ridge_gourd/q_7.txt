As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling diseases in Ridge Gourd in Haryana:

### Control of Dieback and Twig Blight in Ridge Gourd

Dieback and Twig Blight are often symptoms of various fungal diseases such as Anthracnose (*Colletotrichum lagenarium*), Gummy Stem Blight (*Didymella bryoniae*), or other stem blights that affect cucurbits. Effective management requires an integrated approach combining cultural practices and timely chemical interventions.

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Seed Selection:** Always use healthy, certified, disease-free seeds or seedlings.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-cucurbit crops for at least 2-3 years to break the disease cycle.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy infected plant debris (leaves, stems, fruits) from the field to reduce the source of inoculum.
*   **Plant Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to improve air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce humidity and fungal growth.
*   **Irrigation Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day, as prolonged leaf wetness promotes fungal development. Drip irrigation is preferred.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Maintain balanced plant nutrition. Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush, susceptible growth.

**2. Chemical Control:**
For effective control, it is recommended to initiate fungicide sprays preventively or at the very first sign of symptoms. It is crucial to alternate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of fungicide resistance.

*   **For prevention and early stages (Contact/Protectant Fungicides):**
    *   **Mancozeb**: Apply at a concentration of 2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Chlorothalonil**: Apply at a concentration of 2 g/L of water.
    *   **Copper Oxychloride**: Apply at a concentration of 3 g/L of water.

*   **For established infections (Systemic Fungicides):**
    *   **Carbendazim**: Apply at a concentration of 1 g/L of water.
    *   **Propiconazole**: Apply at a concentration of 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin**: Apply at a concentration of 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Tebuconazole**: Apply at a concentration of 0.75 ml/L of water.
    *   **Thiophanate-methyl**: Apply at a concentration of 1 g/L of water.
    *   **Combination products (for broader spectrum and resistance management):**
        *   **Azoxystrobin + Difenoconazole**: Apply at a concentration of 0.5 ml/L of water.

Ensure thorough coverage of the plant foliage and stems during spraying. Consult the product label for specific dosage and pre-harvest interval (PHI) recommendations.

### Control of Tikka Disease in Ridge Gourd

This is not known to affect Ridge Gourd. Tikka disease is primarily a disease of groundnut (peanut).
