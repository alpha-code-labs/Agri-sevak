Addressing micronutrient deficiencies is crucial for healthy growth and optimal yield in Ridge Gourd. As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I strongly recommend soil testing as the first step to accurately diagnose specific deficiencies in your field. This allows for targeted and efficient nutrient management.

Here's how to address the common micronutrient deficiencies in Ridge Gourd:

### General Recommendation:
Always conduct a soil test to confirm deficiencies before applying any micronutrients. Visual symptoms can sometimes be misleading.

### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Stunted growth, small leaves, interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, often leading to a "little leaf" appearance.

**Correction:**
*   **Soil Application (Preventive/Corrective):**
    *   Apply **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (21% Zn) @ 10-15 kg/acre at the time of sowing or transplanting.
*   **Foliar Spray (Corrective):**
    *   Spray **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (21% Zn) @ 5 g/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, spray **Chelated Zinc** (12% Zn-EDTA) @ 1 g/L of water.
    *   Repeat spray after 10-15 days if symptoms persist.

### 2. Iron (Fe) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Severe interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, which turn pale yellow or almost white, while veins remain green. Common in alkaline soils.

**Correction:**
*   **Foliar Spray (Most Effective):**
    *   Spray **Ferrous sulphate heptahydrate** (19% Fe) @ 5 g/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, spray **Chelated Iron** (12% Fe-EDTA) @ 1 g/L of water.
    *   Repeat spray after 7-10 days until symptoms disappear. Soil application of iron is generally not effective in alkaline soils due to rapid fixation.

### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Stunted growth, thickening and brittleness of leaves, poor flowering and fruit set, cracking or malformation of fruits, and sometimes internal browning.

**Correction:**
*   **Soil Application (Preventive/Corrective):**
    *   Apply **Borax** (10.5% B) @ 2-4 kg/acre, or **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (20% B) @ 1-2 kg/acre, mixed with fertilizers at sowing.
*   **Foliar Spray (Corrective):**
    *   Spray **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (20% B) @ 1-1.5 g/L of water at the pre-flowering stage and again at fruit set.

### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Stunted growth, curling and distortion of young leaves, marginal necrosis (browning of leaf edges), and sometimes blossom end rot in fruits (though less common in Ridge Gourd compared to other cucurbits or solanaceous crops).

**Correction:**
*   **Soil Application (Preventive/Corrective):**
    *   If soil test indicates low calcium, apply **Gypsum** (calcium sulphate) @ 200-400 kg/acre (especially beneficial in sodic/alkaline soils).
    *   Alternatively, apply **Calcium nitrate** @ 10-15 kg/acre as a basal dose or through fertigation.
*   **Foliar Spray (Corrective):**
    *   Spray **Calcium chloride** @ 5 g/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, spray **Calcium nitrate** @ 5 g/L of water.
    *   Apply during fruit development stages.

### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, starting from the margins and progressing inwards, with veins remaining green. Leaves may become brittle and develop reddish-brown spots in severe cases.

**Correction:**
*   **Soil Application (Preventive/Corrective):**
    *   Apply **Magnesium sulphate heptahydrate** (Epsom salt, 9.6% Mg) @ 10-15 kg/acre as a basal dose.
*   **Foliar Spray (Corrective):**
    *   Spray **Magnesium sulphate heptahydrate** (9.6% Mg) @ 5 g/L of water.
    *   Repeat spray after 10-15 days if symptoms persist.

### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on young to middle-aged leaves, often appearing as a fine network of green veins against a pale yellow background. In severe cases, small necrotic spots may develop.

**Correction:**
*   **Foliar Spray (Most Effective):**
    *   Spray **Manganese sulphate monohydrate** (30.5% Mn) @ 3-4 g/L of water.
    *   Repeat spray after 10-15 days if symptoms persist. Soil application is generally not recommended in alkaline soils due to rapid oxidation.

### Important Considerations:
*   **Timing:** Foliar sprays are most effective when applied in the morning or late afternoon to avoid scorching and maximize absorption.
*   **Water Quality:** Use clean water for spraying.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management:** Combine these corrective measures with balanced NPK fertilization and organic matter application for long-term soil health.
