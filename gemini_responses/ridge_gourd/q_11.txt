Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in Ridge Gourd in Haryana.

Let's address your concerns regarding Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies:

### Control of Beetles in Ridge Gourd

Beetles, particularly the Red Pumpkin Beetle (Aulacophora foveicollis) and sometimes Epilachna beetles (Henosepilachna vigintioctopunctata), are common pests of Ridge Gourd. They cause significant damage by feeding on leaves, flowers, and young fruits. Red Pumpkin Beetles are especially damaging to young seedlings, often leading to plant mortality.

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   **Early Sowing:** Sow Ridge Gourd early to allow plants to establish before the peak beetle population emerges.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Keep the field free of weeds and plant debris, which can harbor pests.
*   **Hand-picking:** In small plots, adult beetles can be hand-picked, especially in the early morning, and destroyed.
*   **Ash/Neem Cake:** Applying wood ash or neem cake around the base of young seedlings can deter beetles.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation to break the pest cycle.

**2. Chemical Control:**
For effective control of adult beetles, especially during early stages of crop growth, consider the following CIBRC approved technical chemicals:

*   **Fipronil** 5% SC: Apply at a rate of 1.5-2.0 ml per litre of water.
*   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: Apply at a rate of 0.75-1.0 ml per litre of water.
*   **Malathion** 50% EC: Apply at a rate of 2.0 ml per litre of water.
*   **Carbaryl** 50% WP: Apply at a rate of 2.0-3.0 g per litre of water.

**Important Considerations for Chemical Application:**
*   Always ensure thorough coverage of the plant foliage.
*   Apply insecticides preferably in the evening to minimize harm to pollinators.
*   Observe the recommended pre-harvest interval (PHI) for each chemical to ensure the safety of the produce.

### Control of Weevils in Ridge Gourd

Specific weevil pests are not commonly known to cause significant economic damage to Ridge Gourd in Haryana.

### Control of Sawflies in Ridge Gourd

This is not known to affect Ridge Gourd.

Always prioritize integrated pest management (IPM) approaches, combining cultural, mechanical, and biological methods with judicious use of chemicals when necessary. For any specific concerns or severe infestations, it is advisable to consult with local agricultural extension officers or HAU experts.
