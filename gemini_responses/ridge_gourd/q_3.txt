As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding the various rot types affecting Ridge Gourd. These conditions, including Root, Stem, Foot, Collar, Crown, Neck, Black, Fruit, Seed, and Seedling rot, are indeed significant challenges in cucurbit cultivation, including Ridge Gourd, and are primarily caused by a range of fungal and oomycete pathogens. Effective management requires an integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods.

Here's a comprehensive strategy to control these rot types in Ridge Gourd:

**I. Integrated Disease Management (IDM) Principles:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting Ridge Gourd or other cucurbits in the same field for at least 2-3 years. Rotate with non-host crops like cereals (wheat, maize) or pulses.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris, weeds, and volunteer plants that can harbor pathogens.
    *   **Soil Solarization:** In summer, cover the prepared field with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks to raise soil temperature and kill soil-borne pathogens.
    *   **Proper Drainage:** Ensure good field drainage to prevent waterlogging, which favors many rot-causing pathogens (e.g., *Pythium*, *Phytophthora*). Raised beds can be beneficial.
    *   **Optimum Plant Spacing:** Maintain recommended plant spacing to ensure good air circulation, reducing humidity around plants.
    *   **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced fertilizers. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can lead to lush, susceptible growth.
    *   **Irrigation Management:** Use drip irrigation to avoid wetting foliage and stems, reducing disease spread. If using flood irrigation, do so in the morning to allow plants to dry quickly.
    *   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available, choose Ridge Gourd varieties known for resistance or tolerance to common rot diseases.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Incorporate beneficial microbial antagonists into the soil.
        *   **Trichoderma viride** 1% WP: Apply 5 kg/acre mixed with 100 kg of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or vermicompost, 15-20 days before planting. This helps suppress soil-borne pathogens like *Rhizoctonia*, *Fusarium*, and *Sclerotium*.
        *   **Pseudomonas fluorescens** 1% WP: Apply 5 kg/acre mixed with 100 kg FYM, similar to *Trichoderma*.

**II. Chemical Control Measures:**

**A. Seed Treatment (for Seed Rot and Seedling Rot/Damping-off):**
Treating seeds before sowing is crucial to protect against seed-borne and early soil-borne pathogens.

*   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: 2 g/kg seed
*   **Thiram** 75% WS: 2.5 g/kg seed
*   **Captan** 50% WP: 2.5 g/kg seed
*   **Metalaxyl** 35% WS: 6 g/kg seed (specifically for oomycete pathogens like *Pythium* and *Phytophthora*)
*   **Trichoderma viride** 1% WP: 4-5 g/kg seed (apply after chemical treatment, or as a standalone biological treatment)

**B. Soil Drenching (for Root Rot, Stem Rot, Foot Rot, Collar Rot, Crown Rot, Neck Rot):**
Apply fungicides as a drench around the base of the plants, especially at the first sign of symptoms or as a prophylactic measure in disease-prone areas.

*   For Oomycete-related rots (*Pythium*, *Phytophthora*):
    *   **Metalaxyl** 8% + **Mancozeb** 64% WP: 2.5 g/L water. Drench 1-2 L solution per plant, depending on plant size.
    *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride** 72.2% SL: 2-3 ml/L water. Drench 1-2 L solution per plant.
    *   **Fosetyl-aluminium** 80% WP: 2.5 g/L water. Drench 1-2 L solution per plant.
*   For other fungal rots (*Rhizoctonia*, *Fusarium*, *Sclerotium*):
    *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: 1 g/L water. Drench 0.5-1 L solution per plant.
    *   **Thiophanate-methyl** 70% WP: 1 g/L water. Drench 0.5-1 L solution per plant.

**C. Foliar/Fruit Sprays (for Black Rot, Fruit Rot, Stem Rot affecting aerial parts):**
Regular foliar sprays are necessary to protect leaves, stems, and fruits from diseases like Black Rot (*Didymella bryoniae*) and other fruit rots.

*   **Mancozeb** 75% WP: 2.5 g/L water.
*   **Chlorothalonil** 75% WP: 2 g/L water.
*   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC: 0.5-1 ml/L water.
*   **Tebuconazole** 25.9% EC: 0.75 ml/L water.
*   **Carbendazim** 12% + **Mancozeb** 63% WP: 2 g/L water.
*   **Propiconazole** 25% EC: 1 ml/L water.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Alternation of Fungicides:** To prevent the development of fungicide resistance, always alternate fungicides with different modes of action.
*   **Timing of Application:** Apply fungicides preventively during periods conducive to disease development (e.g., high humidity, prolonged leaf wetness) or at the very first sign of symptoms.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always observe the recommended Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) for each chemical to ensure food safety.
*   **Safety Precautions:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and application of chemicals.

By implementing these integrated strategies, you can effectively manage and control the various rot diseases in your Ridge Gourd crop, ensuring healthy growth and good yields. For specific local recommendations or severe outbreaks, please consult with the plant pathology experts at HAU, Hisar.
