As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), here are the recommended cultivation practices for Ridge Gourd in Haryana:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   Ridge Gourd is typically sown directly in the field.
    *   Seeds can be sown in pits on either side of ridges or on raised beds, especially beneficial during the monsoon season to prevent waterlogging.
    *   For commercial cultivation, training on a trellis or pandal system is highly recommended for better yield and fruit quality.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   Sow seeds at a depth of 2-3 cm.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   **For Pandal/Trellis System:**
        *   Row to Row: 2.0 - 2.5 meters
        *   Plant to Plant: 0.6 - 1.0 meter
    *   **For Ground Trailing (less common for commercial production):**
        *   Row to Row: 2.5 - 3.0 meters
        *   Plant to Plant: 1.0 - 1.5 meters
    *   Generally, 2-3 seeds are sown per pit, and after germination, thinned to 1-2 healthy seedlings per pit.

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   The recommended seed dose is 3.0 - 4.0 kg/acre.
