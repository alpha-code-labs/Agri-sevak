As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I will provide scientifically verified advice for controlling Scab, Canker, Gummosis, and Lichen in Ridge Gourd, keeping in mind the specific conditions and approved practices for Haryana, India.

### Control of Diseases and Conditions in Ridge Gourd

**1. Scab (Ridge Gourd)**

Scab in cucurbits, including Ridge Gourd, is primarily caused by the fungus *Cladosporium cucumerinum*.

*   **Symptoms:** Small, water-soaked spots appear on leaves, stems, and fruits. On fruits, these spots enlarge, become sunken, and develop a dark, olive-green, velvety growth, often exuding a gummy substance.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Cultural Practices:**
        *   Use disease-free seeds.
        *   Practice crop rotation with non-cucurbit crops for at least 2-3 years.
        *   Remove and destroy infected plant debris.
        *   Ensure proper plant spacing for good air circulation.
    *   **Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
        *   **Chlorothalonil**: Apply at 2 g/L of water.
        *   **Mancozeb**: Apply at 2.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Azoxystrobin**: Apply at 0.5 ml/L of water.

**2. Canker and Gummosis (Ridge Gourd)**

In Ridge Gourd and other cucurbits, symptoms described as "canker" (localized necrotic lesions) and "gummosis" (exudation of gum) are most commonly associated with **Gummy Stem Blight**, caused by the fungus *Didymella bryoniae* (anamorph: *Stagonosporopsis cucurbitacearum*).

*   **Symptoms:**
    *   **Canker-like lesions:** Water-soaked spots appear on stems, leaves, and fruits. On stems, these lesions often girdle the stem, leading to wilting and collapse of the plant.
    *   **Gummosis:** Amber-colored gummy exudates are often visible on the stem lesions, especially during humid conditions, giving the disease its name.
    *   Leaf spots are typically circular, brown, and may have a yellow halo.
    *   Fruit lesions are dark, sunken, and can also exude gum.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Cultural Practices:**
        *   Use certified disease-free seeds or treat seeds with hot water (50°C for 20-30 minutes) or fungicides.
        *   Implement a strict 2-3 year crop rotation with non-cucurbit crops.
        *   Remove and destroy all infected plant residues immediately after harvest.
        *   Avoid overhead irrigation, which can spread spores. Drip irrigation is preferred.
        *   Ensure good field sanitation and air circulation within the crop canopy.
    *   **Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
        *   **Chlorothalonil**: Apply at 2 g/L of water.
        *   **Mancozeb**: Apply at 2.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Azoxystrobin**: Apply at 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Tebuconazole**: Apply at 1 ml/L of water.
        *   **Copper oxychloride**: Apply at 3 g/L of water, especially useful as a protectant or if bacterial involvement is suspected.

**3. Lichen (Ridge Gourd)**

This is not known to affect Ridge Gourd as a disease or pest. Lichens are symbiotic organisms (fungus and alga) that grow on surfaces like tree bark, rocks, or sometimes on the stems of perennial plants. They are generally non-parasitic and do not draw nutrients from the plant. They are very rarely found on annual herbaceous plants like Ridge Gourd, and even if present, they do not cause harm or disease to the plant. Therefore, no control measures are necessary.
