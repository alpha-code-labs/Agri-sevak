As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm the following regarding rust diseases in Ridge Gourd:

This is not known to affect Ridge Gourd.

The rust diseases you mentioned (Black, Brown, Yellow, White, and Red rust) are primarily associated with other crop families (e.g., cereals for Black, Brown, Yellow rusts; crucifers for White rust; perennial woody plants for Red rust). Ridge Gourd (Luffa acutangula) is a cucurbit, and these specific rusts are not recognized as significant pathogens for this crop. Ridge Gourd is more commonly affected by diseases such as powdery mildew, downy mildew, anthracnose, and gummy stem blight.
