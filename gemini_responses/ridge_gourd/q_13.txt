As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), here is the scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in Ridge Gourd:

### Control of Fruit Fly in Ridge Gourd

Fruit fly (primarily *Bactrocera cucurbitae*) is a significant pest of Ridge Gourd in Haryana, causing considerable damage to developing fruits. Effective control involves an integrated approach:

1.  **Cultural and Mechanical Methods:**
    *   Regularly collect and destroy all fallen, damaged, and infested fruits by burying them deep in the soil or burning them. This helps to break the pest's life cycle.
    *   Deep ploughing of the field after harvest can expose and kill pupae present in the soil.
    *   Avoid planting susceptible cucurbit crops in succession in the same field.

2.  **Pheromone Traps:**
    *   Install **Methyl Eugenol traps** at a rate of 10-12 traps per acre (25-30 traps per hectare) to attract and kill male fruit flies.
    *   Replace the lures every 2-3 weeks for continuous effectiveness.

3.  **Bait Sprays:**
    *   Prepare a bait spray by mixing 100 g of jaggery (gur) or sugar with 10 ml of **Malathion 50% EC** in 10 liters of water.
    *   Spray this mixture on small patches of foliage (not directly on fruits) in the field, preferably in the morning. Repeat every 7-10 days, especially during the fruit development stage.

4.  **Chemical Sprays (if infestation is high):**
    *   **Spinosad 45% SC** at 0.25 ml per liter of water.
    *   **Cyantraniliprole 10.26% OD** at 1.8 ml per liter of water.
    *   **Deltamethrin 2.8% EC** at 1 ml per liter of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC** at 0.5 ml per liter of water.
    *   Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage and developing fruits.
    *   Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
    *   Strictly observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) mentioned on the product label before harvesting.
