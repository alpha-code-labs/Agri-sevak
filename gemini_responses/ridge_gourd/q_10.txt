As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach for effective and sustainable control of pests in Ridge Gourd. This involves a combination of cultural, biological, and chemical methods.

### Control of Borers, Caterpillars, and Leaf folder in Ridge Gourd

These pests often overlap in their management strategies, as many caterpillars can act as leaf folders or even bore into fruits. The Pumpkin Caterpillar (*Diaphania indica*) is a common example that exhibits both leaf-folding and fruit-boring behavior in cucurbits. Melon Fruit Fly (*Bactrocera cucurbitae*) is a major borer pest.

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Methods:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Regularly collect and destroy fallen, damaged, or infested fruits and leaves to break the pest life cycle.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** After harvest, deep ploughing helps expose pupae in the soil to natural enemies and adverse weather conditions.
*   **Pheromone Traps:** Install pheromone traps (e.g., cue lure traps for melon fruit fly) at 4-5 traps per acre for monitoring and mass trapping of male fruit flies.
*   **Fruit Bagging:** For high-value crops, individual fruits can be covered with paper or cloth bags to prevent borer infestation.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid continuous cultivation of cucurbit crops in the same field.

**2. Biological Methods:**
*   **Biopesticides:** Spray formulations of **Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)** @ 1-2 kg per acre or 1-2 g per litre of water, especially effective against young caterpillars and leaf folders.
*   **Parasitoids:** Release egg parasitoids like *Trichogramma chilonis* @ 50,000-1,00,000 eggs per acre, making 3-4 releases at weekly intervals, particularly during the egg-laying period of moths.

**3. Chemical Methods (Use only when pest population crosses Economic Threshold Level - ETL):**
It is crucial to rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Always observe the recommended pre-harvest interval (PHI).

*   **For Borers (Fruit Borers) & Caterpillars & Leaf folder:**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** 60 ml per acre (in 200-400 litres of water).
    *   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG:** 88-100 g per acre (in 200-400 litres of water).
    *   **Flubendiamide 20% WG:** 50 g per acre (in 200-400 litres of water).
    *   **Spinosad 45% SC:** 64-73 ml per acre (in 200-400 litres of water).
    *   **Indoxacarb 14.5% SC:** 200 ml per acre (in 200-400 litres of water).
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** 100-120 ml per acre (in 200-400 litres of water).
    *   **Cyantraniliprole 10.26% OD:** 180 ml per acre (in 200-400 litres of water).

### Diamondback Moth (DBM)

This is not known to affect Ridge Gourd. Diamondback moth (*Plutella xylostella*) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower, mustard).
