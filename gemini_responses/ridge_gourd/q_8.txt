As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified strategies for controlling sucking pests (Aphids, Leafhopper, Whitefly, and Thrips) in Ridge Gourd in Haryana.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies:**

Before resorting to chemical control, it is crucial to implement integrated pest management practices:

*   **Regular Monitoring:** Frequently inspect plants, especially the undersides of leaves and growing tips, for the presence of pests. Early detection is key.
*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Maintain field sanitation by removing weeds, which can act as alternate hosts for pests.
    *   Ensure proper plant spacing and balanced nutrition (avoid excessive nitrogen, which can make plants more attractive to sucking pests).
    *   Use yellow sticky traps (10-15 traps per acre) for monitoring and mass trapping of whiteflies, leafhoppers, and winged aphids.
*   **Biological Control:** Encourage natural enemies like ladybird beetles, lacewings, and parasitic wasps, which prey on aphids and whiteflies. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides if natural enemy populations are high.
*   **Physical Barriers:** For small areas, use insect-proof nets to protect young plants.

**Chemical Control (if necessary):**

If pest populations reach economic threshold levels, chemical intervention may be required. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Use only CIBRC approved technical chemical names.

**For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips:**

Choose one of the following insecticides based on the predominant pest and rotate with others for resistance management:

*   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at 0.5 ml/L of water (or 100-125 ml/acre). Effective against aphids, leafhoppers, and whiteflies.
*   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at 0.4 g/L of water (or 80-100 g/acre). Effective against aphids, leafhoppers, whiteflies, and thrips.
*   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply at 0.4 g/L of water (or 80-100 g/acre). Effective against aphids, whiteflies, and thrips.
*   **Fipronil 5% SC:** Apply at 1.5-2.0 ml/L of water (or 400-600 ml/acre). Effective against thrips, aphids, and leafhoppers.
*   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** Apply at 1.0-1.5 ml/L of water (or 200-300 ml/acre). Particularly effective against whiteflies (nymphs and adults) and mites.
*   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at 2.0-2.5 ml/L of water (or 400-500 ml/acre). Primarily an insect growth regulator, highly effective against whitefly nymphs and hoppers.

**Regarding Psylla:**

This is not known to affect Ridge Gourd.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Spray Volume:** Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage, especially the undersides of leaves, using an appropriate spray volume (typically 200-250 L of water per acre for field crops).
*   **Timing:** Apply insecticides during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always observe the specified pre-harvest interval for each chemical to ensure the safety of the produce.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying. Read and follow all instructions on the product label.
*   **Resistance Management:** Do not use the same insecticide repeatedly. Rotate chemicals with different modes of action to prevent pests from developing resistance.

For precise recommendations tailored to your specific field conditions and current pest pressure, it is always advisable to consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts.
