Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide guidance on managing plant health.

Regarding "Fruit drop" and "Tinda/Boll dropping", these conditions are not known to affect Chrysanthemum, as it is a flowering ornamental plant and does not produce fruits or bolls in the horticultural sense.

However, "Flower drop" or premature flower senescence can occur in Chrysanthemum due to various physiological and environmental factors. Here's how to manage it:

**Causes of Flower Drop in Chrysanthemum:**

*   **Environmental Stress:** High temperatures, sudden temperature fluctuations, water stress (both deficit and excess), low light intensity, and poor air circulation.
*   **Nutritional Deficiencies:** Imbalance or deficiency of essential nutrients, particularly Boron and Calcium.
*   **Pest Infestations:** Sucking pests like thrips and aphids can damage developing buds and flowers, leading to their premature drop.
*   **Disease Pressure:** Certain fungal infections affecting the pedicel or flower base can cause dropping.
*   **Ethylene Production:** Natural senescence or stress-induced ethylene can accelerate flower drop.

**Control Measures for Flower Drop in Chrysanthemum:**

1.  **Optimise Environmental Conditions:**
    *   **Temperature:** Maintain day temperatures between 20-25°C and night temperatures between 15-20°C. Provide shade during extreme summer heat.
    *   **Water Management:** Ensure consistent and adequate watering. Avoid both waterlogging (which leads to root rot and stress) and severe drought stress. Water early in the morning.
    *   **Light:** Provide sufficient light intensity (6-8 hours of direct sunlight or equivalent).
    *   **Air Circulation:** Ensure good air movement around plants to prevent humidity build-up and reduce stress.

2.  **Balanced Nutrition:**
    *   Apply a balanced NPK fertilizer as per soil test recommendations.
    *   **Micronutrients:** If deficiencies are suspected, especially Boron or Calcium, consider foliar applications:
        *   For Boron deficiency: Foliar spray of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** at 1-2 g/L water.
        *   For Calcium deficiency: Foliar spray of **Calcium nitrate** at 5 g/L water.

3.  **Pest Management:**
    *   Regularly inspect plants for pests like thrips and aphids, especially on buds and young flowers.
    *   If infestation is observed, use CIBRC approved insecticides:
        *   For Thrips: Spray **Imidacloprid** (17.8% SL) at 0.5 ml/L water or **Fipronil** (5% SC) at 1.5-2 ml/L water.
        *   For Aphids: Spray **Imidacloprid** (17.8% SL) at 0.5 ml/L water or **Acetamiprid** (20% SP) at 0.2 g/L water.

4.  **Disease Management:**
    *   Maintain good sanitation in the growing area.
    *   If fungal diseases (e.g., Botrytis blight) are suspected to be affecting flower parts, use CIBRC approved fungicides:
        *   Spray **Carbendazim** (50% WP) at 1 g/L water or **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2 g/L water.

By implementing these integrated management practices, you can significantly reduce flower drop and ensure healthy Chrysanthemum blooms.
