As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling soil pests like termites and root-knot nematodes in Chrysanthemum cultivation in Haryana. Both these pests are known to cause significant damage to Chrysanthemum.

### **1. Control of Termites (e.g., *Odontotermes obesus*, *Microtermes obesi*)**

Termites are subterranean pests that feed on the roots and the base of the stem, leading to wilting, stunted growth, and eventually plant death.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Pre-planting Soil Treatment:**
    *   Before planting, apply one of the following insecticides to the soil and incorporate it well. This creates a protective barrier.
        *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC**: Apply 2.5 litres per acre, mixed with 400-500 litres of water, as a drench to the soil.
        *   **Fipronil 5% SC**: Apply 500 ml per acre, mixed with 400-500 litres of water, as a drench to the soil.
*   **Post-planting (for existing infestation):**
    *   If termites are observed in established Chrysanthemum beds, drench the soil around the base of the affected plants with one of the following:
        *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC**: Mix 2.5 ml per litre of water and drench the soil around the plant base.
        *   **Fipronil 5% SC**: Mix 1 ml per litre of water and drench the soil around the plant base.

### **2. Control of Root-Knot Nematodes (*Meloidogyne* spp.)**

Root-knot nematodes are microscopic roundworms that infect plant roots, causing characteristic galls or knots. This impairs water and nutrient uptake, leading to stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, reduced flowering, and overall poor plant vigour. Chrysanthemum is highly susceptible to root-knot nematodes.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Pre-planting Soil Treatment:**
    *   It is crucial to treat the soil before planting, especially if nematodes have been a problem in the past.
        *   **Fluopyram 400 SC**: Apply 150-200 ml per acre, mixed with 400-500 litres of water, as a soil drench before planting or at the time of transplanting.
        *   **Carbofuran 3% G**: Apply 10-15 kg per acre, uniformly broadcast and incorporated into the soil at least 2-3 weeks before planting. Ensure proper soil moisture for activation.
*   **Post-planting (for existing infestation):**
    *   For established plants showing symptoms of nematode damage:
        *   **Fluopyram 400 SC**: Apply 0.3-0.4 ml per litre of water as a soil drench around the root zone of affected plants. Repeat if necessary, following label instructions.
        *   **Carbofuran 3% G**: Apply 10-15 grams per square meter around the base of the plants and lightly incorporate into the soil, followed by irrigation.

### **General Recommendations:**

*   **Integrated Pest Management (IPM):** Always combine chemical control with cultural practices such as using nematode-free planting material, crop rotation with non-host plants (if feasible), solarization of soil during hot summer months, and incorporating organic matter (e.g., neem cake) which can have nematicidal properties.
*   **Soil Health:** Maintain good soil health through proper drainage and organic matter addition, which can enhance beneficial microbial activity that suppresses pests.
*   **Safety Precautions:** Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully. Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, and protective clothing during handling and application of chemicals.
*   **Consultation:** For severe or persistent problems, it is advisable to get a soil test done to confirm the pest presence and population density, and consult with HAU experts for tailored advice.
