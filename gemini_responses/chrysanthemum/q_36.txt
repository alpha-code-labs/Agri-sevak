As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide scientifically verified advice for improving Chrysanthemum cultivation in Haryana.

Firstly, it is important to clarify that Chrysanthemum is primarily cultivated for its ornamental flowers, not for fruits. Therefore, the term "fruit quality" is not applicable in the context of Chrysanthemum cultivation. I will address your query by focusing on improving flower yield, flower quality, and post-harvest storage life of the cut flowers.

### Improving Yield (Flower Production)

To maximize the number and size of flowers, consider the following practices:

*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Ensure a balanced application of Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K) fertilizers based on soil test reports.
    *   Foliar application of micronutrients can significantly boost flower production:
        *   **Zinc sulfate heptahydrate**: Apply a 0.5% solution (5 g/L) as a foliar spray during the vegetative growth phase.
        *   **Borax (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate)**: Apply a 0.2% solution (2 g/L) as a foliar spray to support flower bud development.
*   **Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs):**
    *   To promote lateral branching and increase the number of flower-bearing shoots:
        *   **Benzyladenine**: Apply 50-100 mg/L (0.05-0.1 g/L) as a foliar spray during the early vegetative growth stage.
    *   For specific varieties, low concentrations of **Gibberellic acid** (10-25 mg/L) can be used to promote stem elongation and potentially larger flowers, but high doses can reduce flower count. Use with caution and based on specific varietal response.
*   **Pest and Disease Management:** Timely and effective control of pests and diseases is crucial. Healthy plants are more vigorous and produce a higher yield of quality flowers.
*   **Cultural Practices:** Optimal plant spacing, timely pinching (removal of apical bud to promote branching), disbudding (removal of side buds to promote a single large flower), adequate irrigation, and precise light management (short-day conditions for flowering) are essential.

### Improving Flower Quality

High-quality flowers are characterized by vibrant color, good size, strong stems, and uniform development.

*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Adequate Potassium (K) is vital for enhancing flower size, color intensity, and overall quality. Ensure sufficient application of **Muriate of Potash** as per soil test recommendations.
    *   Foliar spray of **Borax (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate)** (0.2%) can improve flower development, reduce malformations, and enhance pollen viability.
*   **Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs):**
    *   To improve flower compactness, stem strength, and color intensity:
        *   **Daminozide**: Apply 1000-2000 mg/L (1-2 g/L) as a foliar spray during early bud development.
        *   **Paclobutrazol**: Apply 50-100 mg/L (0.05-0.1 g/L) as a soil drench or foliar spray. This can lead to more compact plants with stronger stems and often larger, more intensely colored flowers.
*   **Environmental Control:** Maintain optimal temperature, humidity, and light conditions throughout the growing period to prevent stress, which can negatively impact flower quality.
*   **Pest and Disease Control:** Prevent any damage to developing flowers by implementing a robust pest and disease management program.

### Improving Storage Life (Post-Harvest)

Extending the vase life of cut Chrysanthemum flowers is crucial for marketability.

*   **Harvesting Stage:** Harvest flowers at the correct stage of maturity. For spray types, harvest when 2-3 rows of ray florets are open. For standard types, harvest when flowers are fully open but still firm.
*   **Pre-cooling:** Immediately after harvest, place cut stems in cool water (preferably with a pre-treatment solution) in a cool environment (4-7°C) to rapidly remove field heat and reduce respiration.
*   **Hydration/Pulsing Solutions:**
    *   Immediately after harvest, pulse flowers for 12-24 hours in a solution containing:
        *   **Sucrose**: 2-5% (20-50 g/L) as an energy source.
        *   **8-Hydroxyquinoline sulfate (8-HQS)** or **Citric acid**: 200-300 mg/L (0.2-0.3 g/L) as a bactericide and acidifier to improve water uptake and prevent vascular blockage.
        *   Alternatively, **Aluminium sulfate**: 200-300 mg/L (0.2-0.3 g/L) can be used as an effective bactericide.
*   **Holding Solutions:** After pulsing, transfer flowers to a fresh holding solution for storage or display. A typical holding solution includes:
    *   **Sucrose**: 1-2% (10-20 g/L).
    *   **Citric acid**: 50-100 mg/L (0.05-0.1 g/L) to maintain solution pH and inhibit bacterial growth.
*   **Ethylene Management:** Chrysanthemums are moderately sensitive to ethylene. Avoid storing cut flowers near ripening fruits or vegetables, or in areas with poor ventilation, as these can release ethylene gas, leading to premature senescence.
*   **Storage Conditions:** Store cut flowers in a cool room (2-5°C) with high humidity (90-95%) in clean buckets containing fresh holding solution. Ensure the storage area is free from ethylene sources.

By implementing these scientifically verified practices, growers in Haryana can significantly improve the yield, quality, and post-harvest life of their Chrysanthemum flowers. Always conduct small-scale trials before widespread application of new treatments.
