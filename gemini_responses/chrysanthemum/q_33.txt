As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an integrated approach to weed management in Chrysanthemum, combining cultural practices with judicious use of CIBRC-approved herbicides. Effective weed control, especially during the initial growth stages, is crucial for healthy plant development and optimal flower yield.

### Integrated Weed Management (IWM) Principles:

1.  **Manual Weeding:** This remains the most effective and safest method for Chrysanthemum, especially for broadleaf weeds and parasitic weeds like Amarbail. Perform weeding regularly, particularly in the early stages (first 4-6 weeks after planting).
2.  **Mulching:** Applying organic mulch (e.g., straw, dried leaves) can suppress weed growth, conserve soil moisture, and regulate soil temperature.
3.  **Proper Spacing:** Maintain recommended plant spacing to allow Chrysanthemum plants to grow vigorously and shade out weeds.
4.  **Clean Planting Material:** Ensure that planting material (cuttings, rooted plants) is free from weed seeds or parasitic weed propagules.

### Specific Weed Control Strategies:

#### 1. For Broadleaf Weeds (including Bathu, Congress grass) and Narrowleaf Weeds (including Phalaris minor):

**A. Pre-emergent Herbicides (Applied before weed emergence):**
These herbicides form a chemical barrier in the soil, preventing weed seeds from germinating. Apply immediately after planting Chrysanthemum cuttings/rooted plants, before weed emergence, to moist soil.

*   **Pendimethalin** (30% EC): Apply at 1.0 - 1.3 litres per acre in 200-300 litres of water.
*   **Oxyfluorfen** (23.5% EC): Apply at 1.0 - 1.5 litres per acre in 200-300 litres of water. Use with caution, as higher doses or improper application can cause phytotoxicity.

**B. Post-emergent Herbicides (Applied after weed emergence):**

*   **For Narrowleaf Weeds (Grasses, including Phalaris minor):**
    These herbicides are selective and generally safe for Chrysanthemum (a broadleaf crop). Apply when grasses are 2-4 leaf stage and actively growing.

    *   **Quizalofop-ethyl** (5% EC): Apply at 400 - 500 ml per acre in 200-300 litres of water.
    *   **Fenoxaprop-p-ethyl** (6.7% EC): Apply at 250 - 300 ml per acre in 200-300 litres of water.
    *   **Clethodim** (24% EC): Apply at 400 - 800 ml per acre in 200-300 litres of water.

*   **For Broadleaf Weeds (including Bathu, Congress grass):**
    **Caution:** Most selective post-emergent broadleaf herbicides are highly phytotoxic to Chrysanthemum. Therefore, **manual removal** is the most recommended and safest method for controlling broadleaf weeds once Chrysanthemum plants are established. Avoid using general broadleaf herbicides like 2,4-D or metribuzin directly on Chrysanthemum.

#### 2. For Amarbail (Cuscuta spp.):

Amarbail is a parasitic weed that can severely damage Chrysanthemum. Control is challenging once it establishes.

*   **Manual Removal:** Immediately remove and destroy any Amarbail strands observed on Chrysanthemum plants or in the surrounding area. This is the most effective method.
*   **Pre-emergent Control:** Pre-emergent herbicides like **Pendimethalin** (as mentioned above) can offer some suppression of Amarbail seed germination if applied before its emergence.
*   **Avoid Contamination:** Ensure that irrigation water, farm machinery, and planting material are free from Amarbail seeds.

#### 3. For Orobanche:

This is not known to affect Chrysanthemum. Orobanche (Broomrape) is primarily a parasitic weed of field crops like mustard, tobacco, tomato, and other dicotyledonous plants, but it is not a reported pest of Chrysanthemum.

### General Precautions for Herbicide Application:

*   Always read and follow the label instructions of the herbicide carefully.
*   Use the correct dosage and water volume.
*   Ensure uniform spray coverage.
*   Apply herbicides during calm weather to avoid drift onto non-target plants.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application.
*   Clean spray equipment thoroughly after use.
*   Store herbicides safely, away from children, food, and feed.
