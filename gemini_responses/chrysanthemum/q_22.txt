As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following cultivation practices for Chrysanthemum in Haryana:

Chrysanthemum is primarily propagated vegetatively through rooted cuttings for commercial cultivation to ensure genetic purity and desired flower characteristics. Seed propagation is mainly used for breeding new varieties.

*   **Sowing method/pattern (for rooted cuttings):**
    *   **Rooting of Cuttings:** Healthy semi-hardwood cuttings (8-10 cm long) are taken from disease-free mother plants. The basal leaves are removed, and the cuttings are treated with a rooting hormone such as **Indole Butyric Acid (IBA)** at 1000-2000 ppm. These treated cuttings are then planted in a rooting medium (e.g., sand, vermiculite, coco-peat, or a mixture) under mist conditions or high humidity.
    *   **Planting Pattern:** Once rooted (typically 2-3 weeks), these cuttings are transplanted into well-prepared beds or pots. They are usually planted in a square or rectangular pattern in beds to facilitate cultural operations.

*   **Planting depth (for rooted cuttings):**
    *   Rooted cuttings should be planted deep enough to cover the entire root ball and the base of the stem, ensuring good contact with the soil. A planting depth of approximately 2-3 cm is generally recommended. Care should be taken not to plant too deep, which can lead to stem rot, or too shallow, which can cause the plant to fall over.

*   **Spacing (for rooted cuttings):**
    *   Spacing depends on the variety (standard/single stem or spray type), the training system, and the desired flower size and yield.
        *   **Standard/Single Stem Varieties:** For large, single flowers, a wider spacing is adopted. Typically, 30-45 cm between rows and 20-30 cm between plants within a row.
        *   **Spray/Multi-stem Varieties:** For multiple smaller flowers per stem, a slightly closer spacing can be used. Approximately 20-30 cm between rows and 15-20 cm between plants within a row.
        *   **Overall Density:** This translates to an average plant density of 6-10 plants per square meter for field cultivation.

*   **Seed dose:**
    *   For commercial cultivation of Chrysanthemum, seeds are generally **not used**. Propagation is almost exclusively done through rooted cuttings to maintain varietal purity and ensure uniform flowering. Therefore, there is no recommended "seed dose" for commercial production.
    *   Instead, the requirement is for **rooted cuttings**. The number of cuttings needed will depend on the desired plant density and the area to be cultivated (e.g., 60,000 to 100,000 rooted cuttings per hectare).
