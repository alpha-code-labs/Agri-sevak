As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in Chrysanthemum:

### Control Measures for Pests in Chrysanthemum

**1. Grasshopper:**
Grasshoppers are generalist feeders and can cause significant damage to Chrysanthemum leaves and flowers by chewing.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Regularly inspect plants for grasshopper presence.
    *   Hand-pick and destroy grasshoppers in small infestations.
    *   Keep the area around Chrysanthemum beds free of weeds, as weeds provide shelter and alternative food sources for grasshoppers.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   For larger infestations, apply contact insecticides during the early morning or late evening when grasshoppers are less active.
    *   **Malathion** 50% EC: 1.5 - 2 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: 0.5 - 1 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Quinalphos** 25% EC: 2 ml per litre of water.

**2. Painted bug (Bagrada hilaris):**
This is not known to affect Chrysanthemum. Painted bug is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., mustard, cabbage, cauliflower).

**3. Red cotton bug (Dysdercus cingulatus):**
This is not known to affect Chrysanthemum. Red cotton bug is primarily a pest of cotton and other malvaceous plants, feeding on developing seeds.

**4. Black ants:**
Black ants themselves generally do not directly damage Chrysanthemum plants by feeding. However, they are often associated with sap-sucking pests like aphids, mealybugs, and scale insects. Ants "farm" these pests for the honeydew they excrete, and in return, protect them from natural enemies, thereby exacerbating the sap-sucking pest problem.

*   **Indirect Control (Most Important):**
    *   The primary strategy for managing ants in Chrysanthemum is to control the sap-sucking pests (aphids, mealybugs, scale insects) that the ants are tending. Once the primary pest is eliminated, the ants will typically move away.
    *   For sap-sucking pests, consider:
        *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: 0.5 ml per litre of water (systemic action, effective against sap-suckers).
        *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: 0.25 g per litre of water.
*   **Direct Control (If ants are a nuisance or persist):**
    *   **Cultural Control:**
        *   Maintain good sanitation around the plants, removing any debris or food sources that might attract ants.
        *   Locate and destroy ant nests if possible.
    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   Spray around the base of the plants and along ant trails.
        *   **Fipronil** 5% SC: 1 - 1.5 ml per litre of water (for spraying trails and nests).
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: 0.5 - 1 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Malathion** 50% EC: 1.5 - 2 ml per litre of water.
        *   For soil-dwelling ants, **Fipronil** 0.3% GR can be applied around the base of plants or directly to nests at 5-10 kg per acre.

Always ensure to read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label for safe and effective application, including dosage, timing, and pre-harvest intervals. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment during application.
