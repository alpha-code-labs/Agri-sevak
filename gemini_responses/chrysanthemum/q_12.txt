Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling Scale insects and Mealybugs in Chrysanthemum. Both these pests are common and can cause significant damage if not managed effectively.

Here's a comprehensive approach:

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategy:**

1.  **Monitoring and Early Detection:** Regularly inspect your Chrysanthemum plants, especially the undersides of leaves, leaf axils, and stems, for the presence of these pests. Early detection is crucial for effective control.
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy heavily infested leaves, stems, or entire plants to reduce pest populations.
    *   **Sanitation:** Keep the growing area free of weeds and plant debris, which can harbor pests.
    *   **Water Spray:** For minor infestations, a strong jet of water can dislodge mealybugs and scale crawlers.
3.  **Biological Control:** Encourage natural enemies such as ladybird beetles (coccinellids) and parasitic wasps, which prey on or parasitize scale insects and mealybugs. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that can harm these beneficial insects.
4.  **Mechanical Removal:** For small infestations, mealybugs can be dabbed with an alcohol-soaked cotton swab, and scales can be gently scraped off.

**Chemical Control (When necessary, follow safety precautions):**

When cultural and biological methods are insufficient, chemical control may be required. Always ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and in crevices where these pests hide. Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

Here are some CIBRC approved technical chemical names effective against Scale insects and Mealybugs:

*   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at a concentration of 0.5 - 1.0 ml per litre of water. This is a systemic insecticide effective against sucking pests.
*   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Use at a concentration of 0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water. Another systemic insecticide with good efficacy against sucking pests.
*   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at a concentration of 1.25 - 1.5 ml per litre of water. This is an insect growth regulator (IGR) that interferes with the molting process, particularly effective against nymphs of scales and mealybugs.
*   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:** Use at a concentration of 0.75 - 1.0 ml per litre of water. This is a systemic insecticide with two-way movement in the plant, providing excellent control of scales and mealybugs.
*   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply at a concentration of 0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water. This is a systemic insecticide effective against a wide range of sucking pests.
*   **Horticultural Mineral Oil (HMO) / White Oil:** Apply at a concentration of 10 - 20 ml per litre of water. This acts by suffocating the pests, especially effective against eggs, crawlers, and soft-bodied stages. It can be used alone or in combination with other insecticides (check compatibility).

**Important Considerations for Chemical Application:**

*   **Timing:** Apply insecticides when pest populations are low or when crawlers (mobile young scales) are active, as they are more vulnerable.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure complete and thorough coverage of the plant, including the undersides of leaves and stem crevices.
*   **Rotation:** To prevent resistance, rotate between insecticides with different modes of action (e.g., use an IGR like Buprofezin, then a neonicotinoid like Imidacloprid/Thiamethoxam, then Spirotetramat).
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, mask, and protective clothing while handling and spraying pesticides. Follow the instructions on the product label carefully.
*   **Adjuvants:** Consider adding a spreading/sticking agent (surfactant) to the spray solution to improve coverage and efficacy, especially for waxy pests like mealybugs and scales.

By implementing these strategies, you can effectively manage Scale insects and Mealybugs in your Chrysanthemum crop.
