As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for managing growth issues in Chrysanthemum in Haryana:

It is important to first identify the specific cause of the growth issue, as management strategies vary. Regular monitoring of plants, soil conditions, and environmental factors is crucial.

### 1. Slow Growth

Slow growth in Chrysanthemum can be attributed to several factors including nutrient deficiencies, water stress, poor soil conditions, inadequate light, or pest/disease pressure.

*   **Soil and Nutrition:**
    *   Ensure well-drained, fertile soil with a pH between 6.0 and 7.0. Incorporate organic matter like well-rotted farmyard manure (FYM) or compost (5-10 kg/square meter) before planting.
    *   **Balanced Fertilization:** Apply a balanced NPK fertilizer. For initial growth, a basal application of **Diammonium Phosphate** (DAP) at 50-75 kg/acre and **Muriate of Potash** (MOP) at 40-60 kg/acre can be beneficial, depending on soil test results.
    *   **Regular Feeding:** During active growth, provide liquid feeds with a balanced NPK formulation (e.g., 19:19:19 or 20:20:20) at 2-3 g/L water every 10-15 days.
    *   **Micronutrients:** If general slow growth persists and nutrient deficiency is suspected, a foliar spray of a complete micronutrient mixture containing **Iron (Fe), Manganese (Mn), Zinc (Zn), Boron (B)** at 1-2 g/L water can be applied.
*   **Water Management:** Maintain consistent soil moisture. Avoid both waterlogging (which can lead to root rot) and drought stress. Water deeply when the topsoil feels dry to touch.
*   **Light:** Ensure Chrysanthemums receive at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily. Insufficient light can lead to weak, leggy growth.
*   **Pest and Disease Check:** Inspect plants for signs of pests (e.g., aphids, thrips, mites) or diseases (e.g., root rot, wilt) that can hinder growth. Address these promptly with appropriate CIBRC-approved pesticides/fungicides if identified.

### 2. Yellow Growth (Chlorosis)

Yellowing of leaves (chlorosis) is often a sign of nutrient deficiency, particularly iron, nitrogen, or magnesium, or can be caused by waterlogging.

*   **Iron Deficiency:** Common in alkaline soils of Haryana. New leaves show interveinal yellowing while veins remain green.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Apply **Ferrous Sulphate** at 0.5-1.0 g/L water or **Iron EDTA** at 0.5 g/L water as a foliar spray. Repeat after 7-10 days if symptoms persist.
    *   **Soil Application:** For severe cases in alkaline soils, **Ferrous Sulphate** can be applied to the soil at 5-10 kg/acre, mixed with organic matter.
*   **Nitrogen Deficiency:** Older leaves turn uniformly yellow, and growth is stunted.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Apply **Urea** at 2-5 g/L water or **Calcium Nitrate** at 2-5 g/L water.
    *   **Soil Application:** Increase nitrogen-containing fertilizers as per soil test recommendations.
*   **Magnesium Deficiency:** Older leaves show interveinal yellowing, often starting from the margins.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Apply **Magnesium Sulphate** at 2-5 g/L water.
*   **Waterlogging:** Yellowing can also occur due to poor drainage leading to root damage. Ensure good drainage and avoid overwatering.

### 3. Excessive Height

Excessive height can result in weak stems, lodging, and reduced aesthetic appeal.

*   **Pinching/Pruning:** This is the most effective cultural practice.
    *   **Soft Pinching:** Remove the top 1-2 cm of the growing tip when plants are 15-20 cm tall to encourage lateral branching and a bushier habit. Repeat as needed until flower bud formation.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Reduce high nitrogen fertilization, which promotes vegetative growth. Ensure a balanced NPK ratio.
*   **Light:** Provide adequate light. Insufficient light can lead to etiolation (stretching of stems).
*   **Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs):** For commercial cultivation, CIBRC-approved PGRs can be used to control height.
    *   **Chlormequat Chloride:** Apply as a foliar spray at 1000-2000 ppm (e.g., 1-2 ml/L of 50% SL formulation) when plants have reached the desired height for treatment. Repeat applications may be necessary depending on growth rate and desired height.
    *   **Daminozide:** Apply as a foliar spray at 1000-2500 ppm (e.g., 1-2.5 g/L of 85% SP formulation) when plants are actively growing.

### 4. Excessive Flowering (or Premature/Poor Quality Flowers due to too many)

While flowering is desired, "excessive flowering" can sometimes imply too many small, poor-quality flowers, or premature flowering at the expense of plant vigor.

*   **Disbudding:** For larger, higher-quality blooms, especially in standard (single-flower) types, remove the small side buds (laterals) that develop below the main terminal bud. For spray (multiple-flower) types, remove the central terminal bud to encourage the development of surrounding lateral buds into a spray. This redirects energy to fewer, larger flowers.
*   **Nutrient Balance:** Ensure adequate Phosphorus (P) and Potassium (K) during the flowering stage, as these nutrients are crucial for flower development. Reduce high nitrogen levels once flowering begins.
*   **Environmental Control:** Ensure optimal light and temperature conditions. Chrysanthemums are short-day plants, meaning they initiate flowering when day length shortens. Unseasonal stress or light conditions can sometimes trigger premature or abnormal flowering.
*   **Pest and Disease Check:** Stress from pests or diseases can sometimes lead to premature flowering as a survival mechanism. Address any identified issues promptly.

Always follow label instructions for all chemical applications, including dosage and safety precautions. For specific recommendations tailored to your farm, a soil test is highly recommended.
