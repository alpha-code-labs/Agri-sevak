Protecting your Chrysanthemum crop from wild animals is a significant challenge, especially in areas prone to damage from Nilgai (Blue Bull), wild boar, monkeys, and stray cattle. As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend a comprehensive approach primarily focusing on physical barriers and deterrents, as specific CIBRC-approved chemical repellents for direct application to Chrysanthemum plants against large wild animals are generally not available or recommended.

Here are the scientifically verified methods to protect your Chrysanthemum from wild animals:

1.  **Physical Fencing:**
    *   **Barbed Wire Fencing:** Erect a robust barbed wire fence of at least 2.0-2.5 meters in height. This is effective against larger animals like Nilgai and stray cattle. Ensure the wires are taut and the fence is regularly inspected for breaches.
    *   **Chain-Link Fencing:** While more expensive, a chain-link fence of 2.0-2.5 meters height offers superior protection. For wild boar, it is crucial to extend the fence at least 30-45 cm below ground level or reinforce the base with concrete to prevent digging.
    *   **Electric Fencing:** A well-installed and maintained electric fence can be highly effective. It delivers a non-lethal shock that deters animals. However, it requires careful adherence to safety regulations and local government permissions.
    *   **Bio-fencing:** Planting thorny species like *Prosopis juliflora* (Kikar), *Acacia nilotica* (Babul), or *Carissa carandas* (Karonda) around the field can create a dense, living barrier over time, making it difficult for animals to enter.

2.  **Netting:**
    *   For smaller, high-value Chrysanthemum plots, strong nylon or plastic netting can be used to create a complete enclosure. This is particularly effective against monkeys and birds. Ensure the mesh size is small enough to prevent entry.

3.  **Scare Devices and Deterrents:**
    *   **Scarecrows:** Install scarecrows and periodically change their location or appearance to prevent animals from habituating to their presence.
    *   **Sound Devices:** Utilize devices that emit loud noises, such as gas guns or firecrackers, at irregular intervals. However, animals can become accustomed to these over time, reducing their effectiveness.
    *   **Reflective Tapes/CDs:** Hanging reflective tapes or old CDs can create visual deterrents due to light reflection, which may deter birds and some smaller mammals.

4.  **Habitat Management:**
    *   **Clearance of Surrounding Vegetation:** Remove dense weeds, bushes, and other vegetation around your Chrysanthemum cultivation area. Such areas often provide cover and shelter for wild animals.
    *   **Waste Management:** Ensure that no food waste or other attractive materials are left near the fields, as these can draw animals towards your crop.

5.  **Community-Based Approaches:**
    *   Wild animal damage is often a regional problem. Collaborate with neighboring farmers and the local agricultural department to implement synchronized deterrent strategies or explore community-level fencing projects for greater effectiveness.

6.  **Chemical Repellents (CIBRC Approval Note):**
    *   It is important to note that there are currently no widely recommended or CIBRC-approved technical chemical names specifically for direct application to Chrysanthemum plants as repellents against large wild animals (such as Nilgai, wild boar, or monkeys) in India. Most registered chemical repellents are for specific pests like rodents (rodenticides) or for treating seeds against birds. Therefore, the primary focus should remain on physical barriers and cultural practices.

By implementing a combination of these methods, you can significantly reduce the damage caused by wild animals to your Chrysanthemum crop. For further specific guidance, please consult with the agricultural extension officers at HAU.
