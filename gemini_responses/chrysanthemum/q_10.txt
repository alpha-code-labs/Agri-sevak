As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified strategies for managing borers, caterpillars, and leaf folders in Chrysanthemum in Haryana. Please note the specific advice for Diamondback moth.

**1. Borers (e.g., Stem Borers):**
Borers can cause significant damage by tunneling into stems, leading to wilting, stunted growth, and even plant death.
*   **Cultural Practices:** Regularly inspect plants for signs of borer entry holes or wilting. Remove and destroy affected plant parts immediately to prevent further spread. Maintain good field sanitation.
*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC at 0.3 ml/L of water.
    *   **Flubendiamide** 20% WG at 0.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG at 0.2 g/L of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 1.0 ml/L of water (effective for early stages or as a quick knockdown).

**2. Caterpillars (e.g., Tobacco Caterpillar, American Bollworm):**
Various caterpillar species feed on leaves, buds, and flowers, causing defoliation, damage to developing flowers, and reduced aesthetic value.
*   **Cultural Practices:** Regular monitoring for egg masses and young larvae on the underside of leaves. Hand-picking can be effective for small infestations.
*   **Biological Control:**
    *   **Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki** (Bt) (e.g., 5% WP) at 1.0-2.0 g/L of water, particularly effective against young larvae.
*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC at 0.3 ml/L of water.
    *   **Flubendiamide** 20% WG at 0.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG at 0.2 g/L of water.
    *   **Indoxacarb** 14.5% SC at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Novaluron** 10% EC at 1.0 ml/L of water (effective against younger instars by disrupting molting).

**3. Diamondback Moth:**
This is not known to affect Chrysanthemum. The Diamondback moth (*Plutella xylostella*) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower, mustard).

**4. Leaf Folder:**
Leaf folders roll or fold leaves and feed from within the protective fold, reducing the photosynthetic area and overall plant vigor.
*   **Cultural Practices:** Regularly inspect plants for folded leaves. Remove and destroy any folded leaves containing larvae to break their life cycle.
*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC at 0.3 ml/L of water.
    *   **Flubendiamide** 20% WG at 0.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG at 0.2 g/L of water.
    *   **Indoxacarb** 14.5% SC at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Quinalphos** 25% EC at 2.0 ml/L of water.

**Important Considerations for all Pest Management:**
*   **Integrated Pest Management (IPM):** Always adopt an integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods for sustainable pest control.
*   **Monitoring:** Regular and thorough scouting of your Chrysanthemum crop is crucial for early detection of pests, allowing for timely and effective intervention.
*   **Resistance Management:** To prevent the development of pesticide resistance, rotate insecticides with different modes of action. Avoid repeated use of the same chemical group.
*   **Timing of Application:** Apply insecticides during the cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to maximize efficacy, minimize drift, and protect beneficial insects.
*   **Safety Precautions:** Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the pesticide label, including recommended dosage, application method, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and the use of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).
