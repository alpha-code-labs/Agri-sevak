As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified recommendations for the use of growth regulators and micronutrients in Chrysanthemum cultivation in Haryana:

### Recommended Doses for Chrysanthemum

#### 1. Ethephon (commonly known by brand name Ethrel)

*   **Purpose:** To promote lateral branching, reduce plant height, and sometimes for flower regulation (e.g., delaying flowering or promoting uniform flowering).
*   **Recommended Dose:**
    *   For promoting lateral branching and reducing plant height: Apply **Ethephon** (39% SL formulation) at a concentration of **0.75 - 1.5 ml/L** of water (equivalent to approximately 300-600 ppm active ingredient).
*   **Timing:**
    *   Apply as a foliar spray 1-2 weeks after pinching, when new shoots are emerging. A second application may be given 2-3 weeks later if needed, depending on the desired plant architecture.
*   **Caution:** Always ensure even coverage. Avoid spraying during hot periods of the day.

#### 2. 2,4-D

*   **This is not recommended for use as a growth regulator in Chrysanthemum.**
*   **Explanation:** While 2,4-D is a synthetic auxin, its primary and most common use is as a selective herbicide. Even at very low concentrations, there is a high risk of phytotoxicity (plant damage) to Chrysanthemum, leading to distorted growth, leaf malformations, or even plant death. Its application as a growth regulator in ornamental crops like Chrysanthemum is not a standard or safe practice for commercial growers.

#### 3. Boron

*   **Purpose:** Boron is an essential micronutrient crucial for cell wall formation, sugar transport, pollen germination, and overall flower development and quality. It is not a hormone or growth regulator but is vital for plant physiological processes.
*   **Recommended Dose (Foliar Application):**
    *   Apply **Disodium tetraborate decahydrate** (Borax, 10.5-11.3% Boron) or **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (Solubor, 20% Boron) at a concentration of **1.0 - 2.0 g/L** of water (0.1-0.2% solution).
*   **Timing:**
    *   Apply as a foliar spray during the vegetative growth phase and again at the bud initiation stage to ensure adequate supply for flowering.
*   **Caution:** Boron deficiency can lead to poor flowering and distorted growth, but excess boron can be toxic. It is crucial to ensure proper diagnosis of deficiency before application. Avoid over-application. Soil testing can help determine existing boron levels.

**General Advice:**
*   Always read the product label carefully before use.
*   Perform a small-scale trial before applying to the entire crop, especially with growth regulators.
*   Ensure proper spray coverage and use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).
*   Consult with local agricultural extension services for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions.
