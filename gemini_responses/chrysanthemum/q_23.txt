As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified seed and soil treatment processes for Chrysanthemum cultivation in Haryana:

Chrysanthemum is primarily propagated through cuttings. However, if seeds are used (e.g., for breeding new varieties), seed treatment is crucial. Soil treatment is essential for managing soil-borne diseases and pests, regardless of propagation method.

### Seed Treatment for Chrysanthemum

If propagating Chrysanthemum from seeds, treatment is vital to protect against seed-borne pathogens causing damping-off and early seedling diseases.

1.  **Fungicidal Seed Treatment:**
    *   Mix **Carbendazim** 12% + **Mancozeb** 63% WP at 2-3 g per kg of seeds.
    *   Alternatively, use **Thiram** 75% WS at 2.5-3 g per kg of seeds.
    *   For specific protection against oomycetes (e.g., *Pythium*, *Phytophthora*), **Metalaxyl** 35% WS can be used at 1-2 g per kg of seeds.

2.  **Biological Seed Treatment:**
    *   Treat seeds with *Trichoderma viride* (biofungicide) at 5-10 g per kg of seeds.
    *   Alternatively, use *Pseudomonas fluorescens* (biofungicide) at 10 g per kg of seeds.
    *   These biological treatments can be applied after chemical treatment (ensure seeds are dry) or as a standalone treatment.

### Soil Treatment for Chrysanthemum

Soil treatment is critical to manage soil-borne diseases (e.g., wilt, root rot) and nematodes, which can significantly impact Chrysanthemum health and yield.

#### A. Pre-planting Soil Treatment (Nursery beds / Field preparation)

1.  **Cultural and Biological Methods:**
    *   **Solarization:** Cover the soil with transparent polyethylene sheets (100-150 micron thickness) for 4-6 weeks during hot summer months (May-June). This helps reduce populations of pathogens, nematodes, and weeds.
    *   **Biological Enrichment:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) enriched with bio-agents into the soil at least 15-20 days before planting.
        *   Mix *Trichoderma viride* (2.5 kg) and *Pseudomonas fluorescens* (2.5 kg) with 500 kg of well-decomposed FYM. Apply this enriched FYM at a rate of 500 kg per acre.
        *   Alternatively, drench the nursery beds/planting area with a suspension of *Trichoderma viride* (5 g/L water) or *Pseudomonas fluorescens* (5 g/L water) at the time of bed preparation.

2.  **Chemical Treatment (if severe disease history or high pathogen load):**
    *   **For Root Rot/Damping-off:**
        *   Drench the soil with **Propamocarb hydrochloride** 72.2% SL at 2-3 ml/L water.
        *   Or, **Metalaxyl** 8% + **Mancozeb** 64% WP at 2-2.5 g/L water.
    *   **For Wilt (Fusarium/Verticillium):**
        *   Drench the soil with **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 1-2 g/L water.
        *   Or, **Thiophanate methyl** 70% WP at 1-1.5 g/L water.
    *   **For Nematodes (Root-knot nematodes):**
        *   For effective and environmentally sound nematode management, biological options are preferred. Incorporate *Paecilomyces lilacinus* (bio-nematicide) at 5-10 kg per acre, mixed with FYM, into the soil before planting. Chemical nematicides are highly regulated and their use should be strictly based on soil test results and expert consultation.

#### B. Post-planting Soil Drench (if disease symptoms appear)

*   If early signs of root rot or wilt appear after planting, drench the base of the plants with the appropriate fungicide:
    *   For root rot: **Propamocarb hydrochloride** 72.2% SL at 2-3 ml/L water.
    *   For wilt: **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 1-2 g/L water.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always conduct a soil test to understand the specific nutrient status and potential pathogen/nematode presence in your field.
*   Follow label instructions for all chemical products regarding dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Integrated Pest and Disease Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods, is highly recommended for sustainable Chrysanthemum cultivation.
*   Consult with local HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions.
