As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified practices for Chrysanthemum transplantation in Haryana:

### Ideal Transplantation Time for Chrysanthemum

The ideal time for transplanting rooted Chrysanthemum cuttings or young plants into the main field in Haryana is:

*   **July to August:** This period allows the plants to establish well before the onset of cooler temperatures and shorter days in autumn, which are crucial for flower initiation and development. Transplanting during this time ensures robust vegetative growth, leading to better flowering later in the season (typically October to December).

### Ideal Transplantation Distance for Chrysanthemum

The spacing depends on the variety (standard/disbudded vs. spray type) and the desired plant architecture. For general field cultivation in Haryana:

*   **Between Plants:** 30 cm
*   **Between Rows:** 30-45 cm
*   A common recommended spacing is **30 cm x 30 cm** or **45 cm x 30 cm**. This spacing allows for adequate air circulation, light penetration, and ease of cultural operations like pinching, staking, and pest/disease management.

### Ideal Transplantation Process for Chrysanthemum

A meticulous transplantation process ensures high survival rates and vigorous plant growth:

1.  **Field Preparation:**
    *   **Ploughing:** Plough the field thoroughly to a depth of 20-30 cm, followed by 2-3 harrowings to achieve a fine, friable soil tilth.
    *   **Organic Matter:** Incorporate 20-25 tonnes/acre of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost during the last ploughing.
    *   **Bed Formation:** Prepare raised beds (15-20 cm high, 90-120 cm wide) or flat beds, depending on soil type and drainage. Raised beds are particularly beneficial in areas prone to waterlogging.
    *   **Basal Fertilization:** Based on soil test recommendations, apply basal doses of fertilizers. A general recommendation might include **Diammonium phosphate** (DAP) and **Muriate of Potash** (MOP) to provide phosphorus and potassium, respectively, before transplanting.

2.  **Selection of Planting Material:**
    *   Use healthy, well-rooted cuttings or young plants (typically 4-6 weeks old) obtained from a reputable nursery.
    *   Ensure the plants are free from any visible signs of pests, diseases, or nutrient deficiencies.

3.  **Transplanting Operation:**
    *   **Timing:** Transplant preferably in the late afternoon or on a cloudy day to minimize transplant shock due to heat and direct sunlight.
    *   **Hole Preparation:** Make small holes at the recommended spacing using a dibbler or hand trowel.
    *   **Planting:** Carefully remove the rooted cutting or young plant from its nursery container/tray, ensuring the root ball remains intact. Place the plant in the prepared hole, ensuring the root collar (where the stem meets the roots) is at the same level as the surrounding soil. Avoid planting too deep or too shallow.
    *   **Firming:** Gently firm the soil around the base of each plant to ensure good root-to-soil contact and remove air pockets.

4.  **Post-Transplantation Care:**
    *   **Immediate Irrigation:** Water the plants immediately after transplanting. This helps settle the soil around the roots and reduces transplant stress.
    *   **Shading (Optional):** If transplanting during particularly hot or sunny periods, providing temporary shade for the first 3-5 days can significantly improve establishment.
    *   **Pinching:** Depending on the desired plant shape and number of flowers, pinching (removing the growing tip) is usually done 2-3 weeks after transplanting to encourage lateral branching and a bushy habit.
    *   **Pest and Disease Monitoring:** Regularly inspect the newly transplanted plants for any signs of pests or diseases and take appropriate control measures promptly.
