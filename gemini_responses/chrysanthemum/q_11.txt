Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies in Chrysanthemum, suitable for conditions in Haryana. These pests are indeed known to affect Chrysanthemum, causing damage to foliage, flowers, and sometimes roots.

Effective management involves an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural practices with judicious use of CIBRC-approved chemical interventions when necessary.

### Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies:

1.  **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your Chrysanthemum plants for signs of pest activity (chewed leaves, holes, larvae, adult insects). Early detection is key.
2.  **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy any infested plant parts, fallen leaves, and weeds around the plants, as these can harbor pests.
3.  **Physical Removal:** For small infestations, hand-picking adult beetles, weevils, and sawfly larvae can be effective.
4.  **Water Sprays:** A strong jet of water can dislodge some adult pests and larvae from the plants.

### Chemical Control Measures:

When pest populations are high and causing significant damage, chemical control may be necessary. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Apply chemicals during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) and ensure thorough coverage.

#### For Beetles and Weevils (Chewing Pests):

These pests primarily cause damage by chewing on leaves, flowers, and sometimes stems.

*   **Systemic Insecticides (effective against internal feeders and for longer protection):**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL**: Apply at 0.5 - 1 ml per liter of water.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG**: Apply at 0.2 - 0.4 g per liter of water.
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP**: Apply at 0.2 - 0.4 g per liter of water.
*   **Contact Insecticides (for quick knockdown of adult pests):**
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC**: Apply at 0.5 - 1 ml per liter of water.
    *   **Cypermethrin 25% EC**: Apply at 0.5 - 1 ml per liter of water.
    *   **Fipronil 5% SC**: Apply at 1 - 1.5 ml per liter of water.
*   **Botanical Insecticides (for early stages or as a preventive measure):**
    *   **Azadirachtin (Neem oil based formulations 1500 ppm)**: Apply at 3 - 5 ml per liter of water.

#### For Sawflies (Larvae often feed externally or as leaf miners):

Sawfly larvae can cause significant defoliation or create tunnels within leaves (leaf miners).

*   **For external feeding Sawfly larvae:**
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC**: Apply at 0.5 - 1 ml per liter of water.
    *   **Cypermethrin 25% EC**: Apply at 0.5 - 1 ml per liter of water.
    *   **Fipronil 5% SC**: Apply at 1 - 1.5 ml per liter of water.
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL**: Apply at 0.5 - 1 ml per liter of water.
*   **For Sawfly Leaf Miners (if present):**
    *   **Cyromazine 75% WP**: Apply at 0.5 g per liter of water. (This is an Insect Growth Regulator specifically effective against leaf miners).
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL**: Apply at 0.5 - 1 ml per liter of water. (Systemic action helps reach larvae inside leaves).
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG**: Apply at 0.2 - 0.4 g per liter of water.

### Important Considerations:

*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (gloves, mask, eye protection) while handling and applying pesticides.
*   **Read Labels:** Carefully read and follow the instructions, dosage rates, and safety precautions mentioned on the product label.
*   **Rotation:** To prevent pesticide resistance, rotate insecticides with different modes of action. Do not use the same chemical repeatedly.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** If you intend to use Chrysanthemum flowers for any purpose, be mindful of the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) specified on the pesticide label.
