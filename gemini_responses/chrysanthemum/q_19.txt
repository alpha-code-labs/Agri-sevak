Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide you with scientifically verified advice on addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies in Chrysanthemum, keeping in mind the conditions in Haryana.

Before any fertilizer application, it is **crucial to conduct a soil test** to accurately determine the existing nutrient levels and pH of your soil. This will help in precise application, preventing over-fertilization and nutrient imbalances.

Here's how to address Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium deficiencies in Chrysanthemum:

### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   General yellowing (chlorosis) of older leaves, starting from the tips and margins.
*   Stunted growth and reduced plant vigor.
*   Pale green foliage overall.
*   Smaller flowers and reduced flower production.

**Correction:**

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Urea** (46% N) at 20-30 kg/acre in split doses during the vegetative growth phase.
    *   Alternatively, **Calcium Ammonium Nitrate (CAN)** (25% N) can be applied at 40-60 kg/acre in split doses.
    *   **Ammonium Sulphate** (20.5% N) can be used at 45-70 kg/acre, especially if sulfur is also deficient.
    *   Ensure proper irrigation after application to facilitate nutrient uptake.

*   **Foliar Application (for quick recovery in severe cases):**
    *   Spray a 0.5-1% solution of **Urea** (5-10 g of **Urea** per litre of water) during the vegetative stage. Apply in the evening or early morning to avoid leaf burn. Repeat after 7-10 days if necessary.

### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   Stunted growth and poor root development.
*   Leaves may turn dark green, purplish, or reddish, especially on the undersides of older leaves.
*   Delayed flowering and poor flower quality.
*   Reduced number of flowers.

**Correction:**

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Phosphorus is best applied as a basal dose before planting or at the time of planting, as it is less mobile in the soil.
    *   Apply **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5) at 100-125 kg/acre.
    *   Alternatively, **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (46% P2O5, 18% N) can be applied at 35-45 kg/acre. Adjust Nitrogen application accordingly if using **DAP**.
    *   Incorporate the fertilizer well into the soil.

*   **Foliar Application (less effective for P, but can be used as a supplement):**
    *   Spray a 0.5-1% solution of **Monoammonium Phosphate (MAP)** (12% N, 61% P2O5) or **Potassium Dihydrogen Phosphate (MKP)** (0% N, 52% P2O5, 34% K2O) (5-10 g per litre of water).

### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   Yellowing and browning (scorching) of leaf margins, especially on older leaves.
*   Weak stems, leading to lodging.
*   Reduced flower size, poor color, and shorter vase life.
*   Increased susceptibility to diseases and stress.

**Correction:**

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Muriate of Potash (Potassium Chloride)** (60% K2O) at 25-35 kg/acre, typically in split doses – one at planting and another during the budding stage.
    *   Alternatively, **Sulphate of Potash (Potassium Sulphate)** (50% K2O, 17.5% S) can be used at 30-40 kg/acre, which also provides sulfur.

*   **Foliar Application (for quick recovery or supplementary feeding):**
    *   Spray a 0.5-1% solution of **Potassium Nitrate** (13% N, 45% K2O) or **Potassium Sulphate** (5-10 g per litre of water) during the budding and flowering stages.

**General Recommendations:**

*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Always aim for a balanced nutrient supply. Over-application of one nutrient can induce deficiencies of others.
*   **Organic Matter:** Incorporating well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost significantly improves soil health, nutrient retention, and availability.
*   **Water Management:** Ensure adequate and consistent irrigation, as water stress can hinder nutrient uptake even if nutrients are present in the soil.
*   **Timing:** Apply fertilizers at appropriate growth stages for maximum efficacy.

Please remember that these are general recommendations. For precise and optimal nutrient management, a recent soil test report is indispensable.
