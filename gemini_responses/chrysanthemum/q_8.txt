Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling sucking pests in Chrysanthemum, keeping in mind the conditions in Haryana.

First, regarding Psylla, please note:
*   **Psylla is not known to affect Chrysanthemum.**

For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips, an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is highly recommended for sustainable and effective control.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategy:**

1.  **Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
    *   **Regular Monitoring:** Inspect plants frequently, especially the undersides of leaves and new shoots, to detect pests early.
    *   **Weed Management:** Remove weeds from around the chrysanthemum beds as they can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
    *   **Proper Spacing and Nutrition:** Ensure adequate plant spacing for good air circulation and provide balanced nutrition to avoid stressed plants, which are more susceptible to pest attacks.
    *   **Water Sprays:** For mild aphid infestations, a strong jet of water can dislodge them from plants.
    *   **Yellow Sticky Traps:** Install yellow sticky traps (10-15 traps per acre) at canopy height to monitor and mass-trap adult whiteflies, leafhoppers, and thrips.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Protect and encourage natural predators like ladybird beetles, lacewings, hoverfly larvae, and parasitic wasps, which feed on aphids, whiteflies, and thrips. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.
    *   **Biopesticides:** Consider using entomopathogenic fungi like *Beauveria bassiana* or *Verticillium lecanii* (as per label recommendations) for whiteflies and thrips, especially in early stages or as part of a rotation.

3.  **Chemical Control (When necessary, using CIBRC approved chemicals):**
    When pest populations exceed economic threshold levels, chemical intervention may be required. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Apply sprays thoroughly, ensuring coverage on the undersides of leaves where many of these pests reside.

    Here are some CIBRC approved technical chemical names and their recommended dosages for controlling these sucking pests in Chrysanthemum:

    *   **For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips (Broad Spectrum):**
        *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** 0.5 - 0.75 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** 0.2 - 0.3 g per litre of water.
        *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** 0.25 - 0.4 g per litre of water.

    *   **For Whiteflies (especially nymphs) and Leafhoppers:**
        *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** 1.25 - 1.5 ml per litre of water. (Insect Growth Regulator, effective on nymphs).
        *   **Diafenthiuron 50% WP:** 1.0 - 1.25 g per litre of water. (Also effective against thrips and mites).

    *   **For Thrips and Leafhoppers:**
        *   **Fipronil 5% SC:** 1.0 - 1.5 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Spinosad 45% SC:** 0.25 - 0.3 ml per litre of water. (Naturalyte insecticide, highly effective against thrips).

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Rotation:** Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action (different IRAC groups) to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.
*   **Timing of Application:** Spray during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy, and to protect pollinators.
*   **Safety:** Always read the product label carefully before use. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, and protective clothing during mixing and spraying.
*   **Water Quality:** Use clean water for spraying. Adjust pH if necessary, as some insecticides degrade in alkaline water.

By adopting this comprehensive IPM approach, you can effectively manage sucking pests in your Chrysanthemum crop. For specific local recommendations or severe outbreaks, please consult with the plant protection experts at HAU, Hisar.
