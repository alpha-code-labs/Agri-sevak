Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend the following scientifically verified fertilizer schedule for Chrysanthemum cultivation in Haryana. Please note that these are general recommendations, and a soil test is always the most accurate way to determine precise nutrient requirements for your specific field.

**General NPK Recommendation for Chrysanthemum (per acre):**
For optimal yield and quality, Chrysanthemum typically requires:
*   **Nitrogen (N):** 120-150 kg/acre
*   **Phosphorus (P2O5):** 60-80 kg/acre
*   **Potassium (K2O):** 60-80 kg/acre
*   **Sulphur (S):** 10-15 kg/acre

Based on these requirements, here is a recommended fertilizer application schedule:

---

### **1. Basal Application (at the time of planting, per acre):**

Apply the following fertilizers and thoroughly mix them into the soil before planting the Chrysanthemum saplings:

*   **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)**: 150 kg/acre (This provides approximately 27 kg N and 69 kg P2O5)
*   **Muriate of Potash**: 60 kg/acre (This provides approximately 36 kg K2O)
*   **Elemental Sulphur**: 10 kg/acre

    *Alternatively, if **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** is preferred for Phosphorus and Sulphur:*
    *   **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)**: 450 kg/acre (This provides approximately 72 kg P2O5 and 49.5 kg S)
    *   **Urea**: 50 kg/acre (This provides approximately 23 kg N)
    *   **Muriate of Potash**: 60 kg/acre (This provides approximately 36 kg K2O)

---

### **2. Top Dressing (per acre):**

The remaining Nitrogen and Potassium should be applied in split doses during the growth period for efficient nutrient uptake.

*   **First Top Dressing (30-40 days after planting):**
    *   **Urea**: 70 kg/acre (This provides approximately 32.2 kg N)
    *   **Muriate of Potash**: 25 kg/acre (This provides approximately 15 kg K2O)

*   **Second Top Dressing (60-70 days after planting, before bud formation):**
    *   **Urea**: 70 kg/acre (This provides approximately 32.2 kg N)
    *   **Muriate of Potash**: 25 kg/acre (This provides approximately 15 kg K2O)

*   **Third Top Dressing (90-100 days after planting, at early flowering stage):**
    *   **Urea**: 70 kg/acre (This provides approximately 32.2 kg N)

### **3. Nano Fertilizers (Foliar Application):**

Nano fertilizers offer high nutrient use efficiency and can supplement soil-applied fertilizers, especially during critical growth stages or in case of nutrient stress.

*   **Nano-Urea**:
    *   **Dose**: 2-4 ml/L of water.
    *   **Application**: Spray 2-3 times during the vegetative growth phase (e.g., 45-60 days after planting) and pre-flowering stage, at an interval of 15-20 days. Ensure complete coverage of foliage.

*   **Nano-DAP**:
    *   **Dose**: 2-4 ml/L of water.
    *   **Application**: Spray 1-2 times during the early vegetative growth and pre-flowering stages, at an interval of 15-20 days.

### **4. NPK Complex Fertilizers:**

NPK complex fertilizers provide multiple nutrients in a single granule or solution.

*   **Granular NPK (e.g., 12:32:16, 10:26:26):**
    *   These can be used as a part of the basal application or top dressing, replacing a portion of **Urea**, **DAP**, and **Muriate of Potash**. For example, if using 100 kg of **NPK (12:32:16)** as basal, adjust the quantities of **DAP** and **Muriate of Potash** accordingly.
    *   **Dose**: Typically 100-150 kg/acre as basal or split top dressing, depending on the specific NPK ratio and soil test recommendations.

*   **Water Soluble NPK (for foliar application or fertigation):**
    *   **Dose**: 5-10 g/L of water.
    *   **Application**:
        *   **19:19:19 (or similar balanced NPK)**: During vegetative growth, 1-2 sprays.
        *   **0:52:34 (Mono Potassium Phosphate)**: During bud initiation and flowering, 1-2 sprays to promote flowering and fruit setting.
        *   **13:0:45 (Potassium Nitrate)**: During flowering and flower development for improved quality and shelf life, 1-2 sprays.

### **Important Considerations:**

1.  **Soil Testing:** Always conduct a soil test before planting to get precise recommendations for your specific field conditions. This will help in optimizing fertilizer use and preventing nutrient imbalances.
2.  **Irrigation:** Ensure adequate and timely irrigation, especially after fertilizer application, to facilitate nutrient dissolution and uptake by plants.
3.  **Micronutrients:** Chrysanthemum also requires micronutrients like Zinc, Boron, Iron, Manganese, and Copper. If deficiencies are observed or indicated by soil test, apply appropriate micronutrient mixtures as foliar sprays (e.g., Zinc Sulphate 0.5%, Borax 0.2%).
4.  **Organic Manures:** Supplementing chemical fertilizers with well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost (10-15 tonnes/acre) significantly improves soil health, water retention, and nutrient availability.

By following these recommendations, you can ensure healthy growth and good yield from your Chrysanthemum crop.
