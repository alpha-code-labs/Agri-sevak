As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm that **Black smut, False smut, Kernel smut, and Loose smut are not known to affect Chrysanthemum.**

These smut diseases are primarily pathogens of cereal crops (like wheat, barley, rice, maize, sorghum) and some grasses. Chrysanthemum, being an ornamental flowering plant, is susceptible to other fungal diseases such as rusts (e.g., White Rust caused by *Puccinia horiana*), powdery mildew, and various leaf spots, but not the smut diseases you have listed.
