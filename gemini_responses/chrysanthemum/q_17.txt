Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I am pleased to provide you with the recommended doses of organic manures for Chrysanthemum cultivation in Haryana. These recommendations are based on scientific principles to ensure optimal plant health and yield.

It is always advisable to conduct a soil test to get precise recommendations tailored to your specific field conditions. However, general guidelines are as follows:

*   **Farmyard Manure (FYM):**
    *   For field cultivation: Apply 15-20 tonnes per acre during land preparation, at least 2-3 weeks before planting. Ensure the FYM is well-decomposed to avoid nutrient lock-up and weed issues.
    *   For potted plants: Mix 20-25% well-decomposed FYM with soil, sand, and other potting media components to create a rich and porous growing medium.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   For field cultivation: Apply 4-5 tonnes per acre during land preparation or as a top dressing around the plants, split into 2-3 applications during the growing season (e.g., at planting, vegetative growth, and bud initiation).
    *   For potted plants: Mix 10-15% vermicompost with the potting media. It can also be applied as a top dressing (200-300 g per pot) every 4-6 weeks during the active growth phase.

*   **Sagarika (IFFCO):**
    *   **Sagarika** is a seaweed extract-based bio-stimulant, not a bulk organic manure, but it significantly enhances plant growth, nutrient uptake, and stress tolerance when used in conjunction with other manures and fertilizers.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Mix **Sagarika** at a concentration of 2-3 ml per litre of water. Spray thoroughly to cover the foliage.
        *   First spray: 20-30 days after planting/transplanting.
        *   Second spray: At bud initiation stage.
        *   Third spray: During peak flowering.
    *   **Soil Drench/Drip Application:** Apply 1-2 litres of **Sagarika** per acre, diluted in sufficient water, during critical growth stages (e.g., vegetative growth, pre-flowering).

These organic amendments will significantly improve soil structure, water retention, nutrient availability, and microbial activity, leading to healthier Chrysanthemum plants and vibrant blooms.
