Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I understand the critical role of micronutrients in the healthy growth and flowering of Chrysanthemum. Addressing these deficiencies requires a scientific approach, starting with accurate diagnosis.

**General Approach to Micronutrient Deficiencies:**

1.  **Diagnosis is Key:** Before applying any micronutrient, it is crucial to confirm the deficiency through visual symptoms, soil testing, and/or plant tissue analysis. Blind application can lead to toxicity or nutrient imbalances.
2.  **Soil pH Management:** Many micronutrient deficiencies (especially Iron, Zinc, Manganese) are exacerbated by high soil pH, which is common in many parts of Haryana. Maintaining an optimal soil pH (typically 6.0-7.0 for Chrysanthemum) improves nutrient availability.
3.  **Organic Matter:** Regular incorporation of well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost improves soil structure, water retention, and provides a slow-release source of various micronutrients.

**Addressing Specific Micronutrient Deficiencies in Chrysanthemum:**

Here's how to address the common micronutrient deficiencies, using CIBRC approved chemicals and metric units:

### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, small and narrow leaves (often called "little leaf"), interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, and sometimes a rosetted appearance.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application (for quick correction):**
        *   Spray with **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** (21% Zn) at 2-5 g/L of water.
        *   Alternatively, use **Zinc EDTA** (12% Zn) at 0.5-1 g/L of water.
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, especially during active growth.
    *   **Soil Application (for severe deficiency or prevention):**
        *   Apply **Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate** (33% Zn) at 10-25 kg/acre, mixed with soil before planting or as a top dressing.

### 2. Iron (Fe) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Pronounced interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, with veins remaining distinctly green. In severe cases, the entire leaf may turn yellow or even white, leading to necrosis.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application (for quick correction, especially in alkaline soils):**
        *   Spray with **Ferrous Sulphate Heptahydrate** (19% Fe) at 2-5 g/L of water, along with 1 g/L of citric acid to improve absorption.
        *   Alternatively, use **Iron EDTA** (12% Fe) at 1-2 g/L of water.
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 7-10 day intervals until symptoms disappear.
    *   **Soil Application (for long-term correction in alkaline soils, chelates are preferred):**
        *   Apply **Iron EDTA** (12% Fe) at 5-10 kg/acre, mixed into the soil.

### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, death of growing points (apical meristems), thickening and brittleness of young leaves, cracking of stems and petioles, poor flower formation, and distorted flowers.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application (most effective):**
        *   Spray with **Borax** (Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate, 10.5% B) at 1-2 g/L of water.
        *   Alternatively, use **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (20% B, e.g., Solubor) at 0.5-1 g/L of water.
        *   Apply 1-2 sprays during vegetative growth and before flowering.
    *   **Soil Application (use with caution, as boron can be toxic if over-applied):**
        *   Apply **Borax** at 5-10 kg/acre, mixed thoroughly with the soil before planting.

### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Necrosis (death) of young leaves and growing points, stunted root growth, weak stems, and sometimes marginal leaf burn on young leaves.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application (for quick relief):**
        *   Spray with **Calcium Nitrate** (15.5% N, 19% Ca) at 5-10 g/L of water.
        *   Alternatively, use **Calcium Chloride** (27% Ca) at 2-4 g/L of water.
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 7-10 day intervals during periods of rapid growth.
    *   **Soil Application (for long-term correction and pH adjustment):**
        *   Apply **Gypsum** (Calcium Sulphate, 23% Ca) at 200-500 kg/acre, especially in sodic soils.
        *   Apply **Agricultural Lime** (Calcium Carbonate) if soil pH is low and calcium is needed.

### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, with veins remaining green. The affected leaves may become brittle, develop purplish or reddish tints, and eventually drop prematurely.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application (for quick correction):**
        *   Spray with **Magnesium Sulphate** (Epsom salt, 9.6% Mg) at 5-10 g/L of water.
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals.
    *   **Soil Application (for severe deficiency or prevention):**
        *   Apply **Magnesium Sulphate** at 10-25 kg/acre, mixed with soil before planting or as a top dressing.

### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, similar to iron deficiency but often with a finer network of green veins. In severe cases, small necrotic spots may appear on the yellowed areas.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application (most effective):**
        *   Spray with **Manganese Sulphate Monohydrate** (30.5% Mn) at 2-5 g/L of water.
        *   Alternatively, use **Manganese EDTA** (12% Mn) at 0.5-1 g/L of water.
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals.
    *   **Soil Application (for severe deficiency):**
        *   Apply **Manganese Sulphate Monohydrate** at 10-20 kg/acre, mixed with soil.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Water Quality:** Ensure the water used for spraying is clean and has an appropriate pH.
*   **Timing of Application:** Foliar sprays are best applied in the early morning or late afternoon to avoid scorching and maximize absorption.
*   **Adjuvants:** Adding a non-ionic spreader-sticker to foliar sprays can improve coverage and absorption.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management:** Always combine micronutrient applications with a balanced primary and secondary nutrient program for overall plant health.
