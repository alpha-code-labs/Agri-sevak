As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I advise on the control of various rot types in Chrysanthemum, based on scientifically verified practices suitable for Haryana's conditions.

It is crucial to understand that many "rot" types are symptoms caused by a range of fungal or oomycete pathogens, often exacerbated by environmental factors. An Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural practices with judicious chemical application, is most effective.

### Rots Affecting Chrysanthemum (Root, Stem, Foot, Collar, Crown, Neck, and Seedling Rot)

These rot types are often caused by a complex of soil-borne pathogens, primarily *Pythium* spp., *Phytophthora* spp., *Rhizoctonia solani*, and *Fusarium* spp. They manifest as wilting, yellowing, stunted growth, and eventual collapse of the plant, with characteristic discoloration and softening of tissues at the affected parts. Seedling rot (damping-off) affects young plants before or after emergence.

**A. Cultural and Preventive Measures (Foundation of Control):**

1.  **Sanitation:**
    *   Use sterilized growing media (soil, coco-peat, etc.) for propagation and potting.
    *   Clean and disinfect all tools, pots, trays, and benches before use.
    *   Remove and destroy infected plant material promptly to prevent pathogen spread.
2.  **Water Management:**
    *   Avoid overwatering, especially in heavy soils or during cool, cloudy weather.
    *   Ensure excellent drainage in pots and beds to prevent waterlogging, which favors rot pathogens.
    *   Water early in the day to allow foliage to dry before nightfall.
3.  **Planting Material:**
    *   Always use healthy, disease-free cuttings or seedlings from reputable sources.
    *   Avoid planting too deep, as this can encourage stem/collar rot.
4.  **Environmental Control:**
    *   Ensure adequate air circulation around plants by proper spacing to reduce humidity.
    *   Maintain optimal soil pH (typically 6.0-7.0) and balanced nutrition to promote plant vigor.
5.  **Crop Rotation:**
    *   If growing in beds, practice crop rotation with non-host plants to reduce pathogen build-up in the soil.

**B. Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved Technical Chemicals):**

Chemical control should be used as a supplement to good cultural practices, especially when disease pressure is high or for preventive treatment of susceptible stages (e.g., seedlings, cuttings). Always follow label instructions for dosage and safety.

**For Root, Stem, Foot, Collar, Crown, Neck, and Seedling Rots (Damping-off):**

*   **For Oomycete Pathogens (*Pythium*, *Phytophthora*):**
    *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride** (e.g., 2-3 ml/L water as a drench at planting or as a curative treatment).
    *   **Fosetyl-aluminium** (e.g., 2-3 g/L water as a foliar spray or drench).
    *   **Metalaxyl-M** (e.g., 0.5-1 g/L water as a drench, often combined with a contact fungicide).

*   **For Fungal Pathogens (*Rhizoctonia*, *Fusarium*):**
    *   **Carbendazim** (e.g., 1-2 g/L water as a drench or for dipping cuttings).
    *   **Thiophanate methyl** (e.g., 1-1.5 g/L water as a drench or for dipping cuttings).
    *   **Azoxystrobin** (e.g., 0.5-1 ml/L water as a drench or foliar spray, broad-spectrum).

*   **Broad-Spectrum/Combination Approaches:**
    *   A combination of fungicides targeting different pathogen groups can be effective, e.g., **Metalaxyl-M** + **Mancozeb** (e.g., 0.5 g/L **Metalaxyl-M** + 2 g/L **Mancozeb** as a drench).
    *   For cutting dips or seedling drench, a mixture of **Carbendazim** and **Mancozeb** (e.g., 1 g/L each) can provide broad-spectrum protection.

### Specific Rot Types Not Known to Affect Chrysanthemum:

*   **Black Rot:** This is not known to affect Chrysanthemum as a specific disease entity. While various rots can cause blackening of tissues, "Black Rot" as a distinct disease (e.g., *Xanthomonas* in crucifers) does not occur in Chrysanthemum.
*   **Fruit Rot:** This is not known to affect Chrysanthemum, as it is an ornamental plant not grown for its fruit.
*   **Seed Rot:** This is not a primary concern for Chrysanthemum as it is predominantly propagated by cuttings. For seed-propagated plants, it is addressed under seedling rot/damping-off, where the same pathogens and control measures apply.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
*   Read and strictly follow the instructions on the fungicide label regarding dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest intervals (though less critical for ornamentals, good practice).
*   For severe or persistent problems, consider sending a sample to a plant diagnostic lab (like HAU's Plant Pathology Department) for accurate pathogen identification, which can guide more targeted control.
