Namaste,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I will provide scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned conditions in Chrysanthemum, keeping in mind the specific context of Haryana, India, and adhering to the strict guidelines.

### Control Measures for Chrysanthemum

**1. Scab (Caused by *Elsinoë chrysanthemi*)**

Chrysanthemum scab is a fungal disease that can cause significant damage to leaves, stems, and flowers.

**Cultural Control:**
*   Use disease-free planting material.
*   Ensure good air circulation around plants by proper spacing.
*   Remove and destroy infected plant parts immediately to prevent further spread.
*   Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day, to reduce leaf wetness.
*   Sanitize tools and equipment regularly.

**Chemical Control:**
Apply fungicides preventively or at the first sign of symptoms. Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.
*   **Mancozeb 75% WP**: Apply at a rate of 2.5 g per litre of water.
*   **Chlorothalonil 75% WP**: Apply at a rate of 2 g per litre of water.
*   **Copper Oxychloride 50% WP**: Apply at a rate of 3 g per litre of water.

**2. Canker (Stem Rot/Blight)**

In Chrysanthemum, "canker" typically refers to stem rot or blight symptoms caused by various fungal pathogens (e.g., *Fusarium*, *Rhizoctonia*, *Sclerotinia*) that lead to lesions, girdling, and wilting of stems.

**Cultural Control:**
*   Use sterile potting mix and disease-free cuttings.
*   Ensure proper drainage in pots and beds to avoid waterlogging.
*   Avoid injuring stems during cultural operations, as wounds can be entry points for pathogens.
*   Maintain good field sanitation by removing plant debris.
*   Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush, susceptible growth.

**Chemical Control:**
For effective control, fungicides can be applied as foliar sprays or soil drench, depending on the pathogen and disease severity.
*   **Carbendazim 50% WP**: For stem rot, apply as a soil drench at a rate of 1-2 g per litre of water around the base of the plant. For foliar blight, spray at 0.5-1 g per litre of water.
*   **Propiconazole 25% EC**: Apply as a foliar spray at a rate of 0.5 ml per litre of water, or as a drench for certain stem rots.
*   **Mancozeb 75% WP**: Can be used as a foliar spray at 2.5 g per litre of water for general blight control.

**3. Gummosis**

This is not known to affect Chrysanthemum. Gummosis is a physiological condition typically observed in woody plants (trees and shrubs) where gum exudes from the bark, often in response to stress, injury, or disease. Chrysanthemum is an herbaceous plant and does not exhibit gummosis.

**4. Lichen**

This is not known to affect Chrysanthemum. Lichens are symbiotic organisms (fungus and alga) that grow on surfaces like tree bark, rocks, or soil. They are generally harmless epiphytes and do not parasitize or cause disease in the host plant. Their presence on Chrysanthemum plants or pots usually indicates high humidity and good air quality, rather than a pest or disease problem requiring control measures for the plant itself.
