As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified strategies to protect Chrysanthemum from environmental stresses in Haryana:

**1. Protection from Extreme Cold and Frost:**
Haryana winters can experience temperatures below freezing, leading to frost damage.
*   **Covering:** During anticipated frost nights, cover Chrysanthemum plants with straw, dry grass, jute bags, or non-woven fabric. For larger areas, low tunnels made of clear polythene sheets can be highly effective. Ensure these covers are removed during the day to allow sunlight and air circulation, preventing excessive humidity and fungal issues.
*   **Irrigation:** A light irrigation in the evening before a predicted frost can help raise the soil temperature and release latent heat, providing some protection. Ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging.
*   **Site Selection:** Avoid planting Chrysanthemum in low-lying areas where cold air tends to settle and frost is more severe.
*   **Windbreaks:** Establish natural windbreaks (e.g., hedges) or artificial barriers on the northern and western sides of the cultivation area to reduce the impact of cold, dry winds.
*   **Foliar Application (Stress Tolerance):**
    *   Foliar application of **Potassium silicate** at 2-3 g/L water can help strengthen cell walls and improve the plant's natural tolerance to cold stress. Apply before the onset of severe cold periods.

**2. Protection from Heat (Loo) and Intense Sunlight:**
Summers in Haryana are characterized by high temperatures and hot, dry winds (Loo), along with intense solar radiation, which can cause scorching and wilting.
*   **Shade Management:**
    *   **Shade Nets:** Install 30-50% shade nets over the Chrysanthemum cultivation area, especially during the peak summer months (April to June). This significantly reduces ambient temperature and direct solar radiation, preventing leaf burn and heat stress.
    *   **Mulching:** Apply a 5-10 cm layer of organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves, sugarcane trash) around the base of plants. This helps to keep the soil cool, conserve moisture, and suppress weeds.
*   **Irrigation:**
    *   **Frequent Light Irrigation:** Provide frequent, light irrigation during hot periods to keep the soil moist and increase humidity around the plants. Avoid overhead irrigation during the hottest part of the day to prevent water droplets from acting as lenses and causing leaf scorch. Drip irrigation is highly recommended for efficient water use.
*   **Windbreaks:** Plant taller crops or erect artificial barriers on the western and southern sides to reduce the direct impact of hot, dry winds (Loo).
*   **Foliar Application (Heat Stress):**
    *   Spraying a 5% solution of **Kaolin clay** (50 g/L water) can create a reflective film on leaves, reducing leaf temperature and sunburn.
    *   Foliar application of **Potassium silicate** at 2-3 g/L water can enhance heat tolerance by improving cell wall integrity and reducing water loss through transpiration.
