As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Chrysanthemum in Haryana. An integrated approach combining cultural practices and judicious use of CIBRC-approved fungicides is crucial for effective management.

**General Cultural Practices for Fungal Disease Management:**

1.  **Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy infected leaves, stems, and flowers. Clear plant debris from around the plants.
2.  **Air Circulation:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to promote air movement, which helps dry foliage and reduces humidity, thereby discouraging fungal growth.
3.  **Watering:** Water plants at the base in the morning to allow foliage to dry completely before evening. Avoid overhead irrigation, especially during cool, humid weather.
4.  **Nutrition:** Provide balanced nutrition. Over-fertilization with nitrogen can lead to lush, soft growth that is more susceptible to fungal infections.
5.  **Weed Control:** Keep the area around Chrysanthemum plants free of weeds, as they can harbor pests and diseases and impede air circulation.

**Specific Fungal Diseases and Control Measures:**

Here are the control measures for the fungal diseases you've mentioned that are known to affect Chrysanthemum:

*   **Alternaria Leaf Spot (*Alternaria chrysanthemi*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Small, dark brown to black spots, often with concentric rings, primarily on older leaves. Severe infection can lead to defoliation.
    *   **Control:**
        *   Spray with **Mancozeb** at 2.0-2.5 g/L water.
        *   Alternatively, use **Chlorothalonil** at 2.0 g/L water.
        *   For systemic action, **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5-1.0 ml/L water can be effective.

*   **Anthracnose (*Colletotrichum gloeosporioides*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Irregular, sunken, dark brown lesions on leaves, stems, and sometimes flowers. In humid conditions, pinkish spore masses may be visible.
    *   **Control:**
        *   Apply **Carbendazim** at 0.5-1.0 g/L water.
        *   **Mancozeb** at 2.0-2.5 g/L water is also effective.
        *   **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5-1.0 ml/L water can provide good control.

*   **Blast:**
    *   This is not known to affect Chrysanthemum as a specific disease name. The term "blast" is commonly associated with diseases like rice blast. If you are observing rapid necrosis or blighting of flowers or shoots, it might be due to other pathogens like *Botrytis* (Grey Mould) or other blights, which are addressed below.

*   **Blight (e.g., *Botrytis cinerea* (Grey Mould Blight), *Ascochyta* Blight, *Septoria* Blight)**
    *   **Symptoms:**
        *   **Botrytis Blight (Grey Mould):** Water-soaked spots on petals, leaves, and stems, which turn brown and are often covered with a fuzzy grey mold in humid conditions. Can cause flower bud rot and stem cankers.
        *   **Other Blights/Leaf Spots:** Various fungi cause irregular spots, lesions, and blighting of foliage and stems.
    *   **Control:**
        *   For *Botrytis* (Grey Mould):
            *   Spray with **Carbendazim** at 0.5-1.0 g/L water.
            *   **Thiophanate Methyl** at 0.7-1.0 g/L water.
            *   **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5-1.0 ml/L water.
        *   For general blights and leaf spots:
            *   **Mancozeb** at 2.0-2.5 g/L water.
            *   **Chlorothalonil** at 2.0 g/L water.
            *   **Propiconazole** at 0.5 ml/L water.

*   **Brown Spot:**
    *   This is a general symptom that can be caused by various fungi, including *Alternaria* and *Septoria*. The control measures for Alternaria Leaf Spot and general Blights/Leaf Spots will be applicable here.

*   **Downy Mildew (*Plasmopara obducens*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Yellowish, angular spots on the upper surface of leaves, often delimited by veins. On the underside, a purplish-grey, fuzzy growth may be visible, especially in humid conditions. Can lead to leaf distortion and defoliation.
    *   **Control:**
        *   Apply a combination product containing **Metalaxyl + Mancozeb** at 2.0-2.5 g/L water.
        *   **Propineb** at 2.0-2.5 g/L water.
        *   A combination of **Cymoxanil + Mancozeb** (follow label recommendations, typically 2.5-3.0 g/L water).
        *   **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5-1.0 ml/L water also has some efficacy against downy mildews.

*   **Powdery Mildew (*Oidium chrysanthemi* or *Podosphaera xanthii*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** White, powdery patches on the surface of leaves, stems, and flower buds. Infected leaves may become distorted, yellow, and eventually drop.
    *   **Control:**
        *   Spray with **Wettable Sulphur** at 2.0-3.0 g/L water (avoid application during very hot weather).
        *   **Myclobutanil** at 0.4-0.5 g/L water.
        *   **Penconazole** at 0.5 ml/L water.
        *   **Hexaconazole** at 0.5-1.0 ml/L water.
        *   **Tebuconazole** at 0.75-1.0 ml/L water.
        *   **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5-1.0 ml/L water.

*   **Grey Mildew:**
    *   This is not known to affect Chrysanthemum as a standard scientific disease name. It is likely a colloquial term that might refer to Powdery Mildew (due to the greyish appearance of some powdery mildew colonies) or more commonly, Grey Mould (*Botrytis cinerea*), which causes a fuzzy grey growth on infected plant parts. Please refer to the control measures for Powdery Mildew and Blight (specifically *Botrytis* Blight) above.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Rotation of Fungicides:** To prevent the development of fungicide resistance, it is crucial to rotate fungicides with different modes of action. Do not use the same fungicide repeatedly.
*   **Timing of Application:** Apply fungicides preventively or at the very first sign of disease symptoms.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough coverage of all plant parts, including the undersides of leaves, for effective control.
*   **Safety:** Always read and follow the instructions on the fungicide label regarding dosage, application, pre-harvest interval, and safety precautions. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).
