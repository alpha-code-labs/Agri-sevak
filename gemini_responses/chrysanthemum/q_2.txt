Dear Grower,

Rust diseases are a significant concern in Chrysanthemum cultivation in Haryana, and effective management is crucial for healthy plant growth and flower production. While various rust types are mentioned, the most common and damaging rust on Chrysanthemum is White Rust (*Puccinia horiana*) and sometimes Brown Rust (*Puccinia chrysanthemi*). The control measures outlined below are effective against these and other rust pathogens that may affect Chrysanthemum.

**Symptoms of Rust Diseases:**
Rust diseases typically manifest as small, raised pustules on the underside of leaves, which can be white, yellow, orange, brown, or black depending on the specific rust fungus. On the upper surface, corresponding yellow or brown spots may appear. Severe infections lead to leaf yellowing, wilting, premature defoliation, and reduced flower quality.

**Integrated Management Strategy:**

A combination of cultural practices and timely chemical intervention is recommended for effective control.

**1. Cultural and Preventive Measures:**
*   **Sanitation:** Regularly inspect plants and promptly remove and destroy infected leaves and plant debris. Do not compost infected material.
*   **Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to promote good air circulation, which helps in drying leaf surfaces and reducing humidity around the plants.
*   **Watering:** Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day. Water plants at the base to keep foliage dry, as prolonged leaf wetness favors rust development.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** If available, choose Chrysanthemum varieties known to have resistance or tolerance to rust diseases.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush, succulent growth that is more susceptible to disease. Maintain a balanced nutrient program.
*   **Weed Control:** Keep the growing area free of weeds, as they can act as alternative hosts for some pathogens.

**2. Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
For effective control, apply fungicides preventively or at the first sign of disease. Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

*   **For Systemic Control (Curative and Protective):**
    *   **Difenoconazole** 25% EC: Apply at 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Propiconazole** 25% EC: Apply at 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Tebuconazole** 25.9% EC: Apply at 0.75 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC: Apply at 0.5 ml per litre of water.

*   **For Contact/Protective Control (Preventive):**
    *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP: Apply at 2.5 g per litre of water.
    *   **Chlorothalonil** 75% WP: Apply at 2 g per litre of water.

**Application Guidelines:**
*   Start spraying preventively during periods conducive to rust development (e.g., high humidity, moderate temperatures) or at the very first appearance of symptoms.
*   Ensure thorough coverage of all plant parts, especially the undersides of leaves where rust pustules typically form.
*   Repeat applications at 7-14 day intervals, depending on disease severity and environmental conditions, strictly following the product label instructions.
*   Always rotate between fungicides with different active ingredients (e.g., a triazole followed by a strobilurin, then a contact fungicide) to manage resistance effectively.

By implementing these integrated management strategies, you can effectively control rust diseases in your Chrysanthemum crop and ensure healthy, vibrant blooms.
