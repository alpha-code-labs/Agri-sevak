As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the critical importance of protecting Poplar (Populus deltoides) plantations from environmental stresses, especially given the climatic extremes experienced in Haryana. Poplar is a fast-growing and economically significant tree for our region, but its productivity can be severely impacted by adverse weather conditions.

Here is scientifically verified advice to protect Poplar from extreme cold, frost, heat (Loo), and intense sunlight:

**General Management Principles:**
Before addressing specific stresses, it's crucial to emphasize that healthy, well-nourished trees are more resilient. Ensure proper site selection, balanced nutrition (especially adequate Potassium for stress tolerance), and timely irrigation.

**1. Protection from Extreme Cold and Frost:**
Young Poplar plants are particularly vulnerable to frost damage, which can lead to dieback of shoots and even plant mortality.

*   **Site Selection:** Avoid planting Poplar in low-lying areas or frost pockets where cold air tends to settle.
*   **Planting Time:** Plant Poplar saplings at the optimal time (typically January-February in Haryana) to allow them to establish a strong root system before the onset of severe winter conditions in subsequent years.
*   **Mulching:** Apply a thick layer (10-15 cm) of organic mulch (e.g., paddy straw, sugarcane trash, dry leaves) around the base of young trees. This insulates the soil, protects the root zone from freezing, and helps retain soil moisture.
*   **Irrigation:** Ensure the soil is adequately moist before a predicted frost event. Moist soil retains heat better than dry soil, releasing it slowly overnight and helping to keep the air temperature around the plants slightly higher.
*   **Windbreaks:** Establish shelterbelts or windbreaks around the plantation to reduce the impact of cold, dry winds, which can exacerbate frost damage through desiccation.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure balanced fertilization. Adequate **Potassium** (K) improves cell wall strength and overall cold hardiness. Avoid late-season nitrogen application, which can promote tender, succulent growth more susceptible to frost.

**2. Protection from Heat (Loo) and Intense Sunlight:**
The hot, dry winds (Loo) and intense summer sun in Haryana can cause severe stress, leading to leaf scorch, wilting, reduced growth, and sunscald on bark.

*   **Irrigation:** This is the most critical measure. During periods of high heat and Loo, ensure regular and deep irrigation. Poplar trees have high water requirements. Maintaining optimal soil moisture helps the trees cope with transpiration losses and keeps their tissues turgid.
*   **Mulching:** Continue mulching around the base of trees. It helps conserve soil moisture, reduces soil temperature, and suppresses weed competition for water.
*   **Windbreaks:** Planting shelterbelts of hardy, tall trees (e.g., Eucalyptus, Kikar) around the Poplar plantation can significantly reduce the velocity and desiccating effect of hot Loo winds.
*   **Bark Protection (for young trees):** Young Poplar trees, especially those with thin bark, are susceptible to sunscald on their trunks.
    *   Apply a whitewash solution to the lower trunk using **Calcium carbonate** (lime). This reflects sunlight, reduces bark temperature, and prevents sunscald. Mix 1 kg of **Calcium carbonate** with 10 litres of water, adding a small amount of adhesive (e.g., gum arabic) for better adherence.
*   **Foliar Sprays for Heat Stress Mitigation:**
    *   **Kaolin clay:** Spraying a 2-5% solution of **Kaolin clay** on foliage creates a reflective particle film. This reduces leaf temperature by reflecting solar radiation, thereby lowering transpiration rates and mitigating heat stress. Apply at a rate of 20-50 g/L of water, ensuring good coverage. Repeat every 10-15 days during peak heat.
    *   **Potassium silicate:** Foliar application of **Potassium silicate** (e.g., 0.5-1% solution) can enhance the plant's tolerance to heat and drought stress by strengthening cell walls and reducing water loss through stomata. Apply at a rate of 5-10 ml/L of water.

By implementing these scientifically sound practices, Poplar growers in Haryana can significantly reduce the impact of environmental stresses, ensuring healthier trees and better yields.
