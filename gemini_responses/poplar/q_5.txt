As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Scab, Canker, Gummosis, and Lichen in Poplar in Haryana.

### Control Measures for Poplar Diseases and Conditions

It is crucial to adopt an integrated approach combining cultural practices with judicious chemical applications for effective management. Always consult the latest recommendations from HAU or your local agricultural extension office and strictly follow the instructions on chemical labels.

#### 1. Scab (Poplar Scab - Caused by *Venturia populina* or *Venturia macularis*)

**Symptoms:** Dark, olive-green to black spots on young leaves, petioles, and shoots, leading to leaf distortion, premature defoliation, and shoot dieback.

**Cultural Practices:**
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where possible, plant Poplar varieties known to have resistance to scab prevalent in your area.
*   **Sanitation:** Collect and destroy fallen infected leaves and twigs, especially before winter, to reduce inoculum for the next season.
*   **Pruning:** Prune out infected shoots during dry periods to remove sources of infection and improve air circulation within the canopy.
*   **Spacing:** Ensure adequate spacing between trees to promote good air circulation and reduce humidity, which favors fungal growth.

**Chemical Control:**
Fungicide applications are most effective when applied preventively at bud break and during periods conducive to disease development (cool, wet weather).
*   **Propiconazole** 25% EC: Apply at 0.5-1 ml/L of water.
*   **Mancozeb** 75% WP: Apply at 2-2.5 g/L of water.
*   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: Apply at 1-1.5 g/L of water.

#### 2. Canker (Caused by various fungi like *Cytospora*, *Dothiorella*, *Septoria*, *Botryosphaeria*, and bacteria)

**Symptoms:** Sunken, discolored lesions on the bark of branches and trunks, often with cracked edges. These cankers can girdle branches or the main stem, leading to dieback. Gummosis can sometimes be a symptom associated with cankers.

**Cultural Practices:**
*   **Avoid Injury:** Prevent mechanical injuries to the bark from machinery, tools, or animals, as wounds serve as entry points for pathogens.
*   **Pruning:** Promptly prune out infected branches well below the visible canker, making clean cuts. Sterilize pruning tools with a 10% bleach solution or rubbing alcohol between cuts to prevent spreading the disease.
*   **Tree Vigor:** Maintain tree health and vigor through proper irrigation, balanced fertilization, and pest management to enhance natural resistance.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Select Poplar clones known for their resistance to common canker diseases in the region.

**Chemical Control:**
Chemical control is generally less effective for established cankers. Focus is on prevention and protecting pruning wounds.
*   **Copper Oxychloride** 50% WP: Apply at 2.5-3 g/L of water as a protective spray, especially after pruning or on fresh wounds.
*   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: Apply at 1-1.5 g/L of water as a spray or as a wound dressing mixed with a suitable sticker.
*   **Thiophanate Methyl** 70% WP: Apply at 0.5-1 g/L of water as a protective spray.

#### 3. Gummosis

**Symptoms:** Exudation of a sticky, gummy sap from the bark of the trunk or branches. Gummosis is a symptom, not a primary disease itself, indicating underlying stress or injury.

**Causes:** Gummosis in Poplar can be triggered by various factors including:
*   **Mechanical Injury:** Wounds from pruning, machinery, or environmental factors.
*   **Insect Borers:** Activity of wood-boring insects.
*   **Disease:** Often associated with canker diseases (as mentioned above) or root rot.
*   **Environmental Stress:** Drought, waterlogging, nutrient deficiencies, or extreme temperatures.

**Cultural Practices:**
*   **Identify and Address Cause:** The most critical step is to identify the underlying cause of gummosis.
    *   If due to mechanical injury, protect the tree from further damage.
    *   If insect borers are present, implement appropriate insect control measures.
    *   If associated with canker, follow the control measures for Canker.
    *   Ensure proper irrigation and drainage to avoid water stress.
    *   Provide balanced nutrition based on soil testing.
*   **Pruning:** Remove any dead or severely affected branches, sterilizing tools.

**Chemical Control:**
There is no direct chemical control for gummosis itself. Treatment focuses on managing the underlying cause:
*   If gummosis is a symptom of a fungal canker, apply fungicides as recommended under "Canker" section.
*   If insect borers are identified as the cause, specific insecticides approved for Poplar borers would be required, but this falls outside the scope of disease/condition control.

#### 4. Lichen

**Symptoms:** Crusty, leafy, or bushy growths of various colors (grey, green, yellow, orange) on the bark of the trunk and branches.

**Nature:** Lichens are symbiotic organisms composed of a fungus and an alga. They are epiphytes, meaning they grow on the surface of trees for support and do not parasitize the tree or draw nutrients from it. They are generally harmless to the Poplar tree. Their presence often indicates good air quality and can sometimes be more prevalent on older, slower-growing trees or trees in shaded, humid conditions.

**Cultural Practices:**
*   **No Control Needed:** Generally, no control measures are required for lichens as they do not harm the tree.
*   **Tree Vigor:** Maintaining good tree vigor through proper cultural practices (nutrition, water, pest control) can sometimes reduce their prevalence, as they tend to thrive on undisturbed bark.
*   **Aesthetic Removal (Optional):** If removal is desired for aesthetic reasons, gentle scrubbing with a stiff brush and water can dislodge them, but they will likely return.

**Chemical Control:**
*   This is not known to affect Poplar in a detrimental way that requires chemical intervention. Chemical control for lichens on trees is generally not recommended as it can potentially harm the tree or is ineffective.
