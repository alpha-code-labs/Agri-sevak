As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned conditions in Poplar plantations in Haryana:

### Grasshopper Control in Poplar

Grasshoppers can cause significant defoliation, especially on young Poplar saplings and nursery plants.

*   **Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
    *   Regular monitoring of Poplar nurseries and plantations, particularly during the monsoon and post-monsoon seasons when grasshopper populations are high.
    *   Hand-picking and destroying grasshoppers in small, localized infestations.
    *   Maintaining weed-free conditions around the Poplar trees, as weeds can serve as alternate hosts and breeding grounds for grasshoppers.
*   **Chemical Control (if infestation is severe and causing economic damage):**
    *   Spray with **Malathion** 50% EC at a concentration of 1.0-1.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   Alternatively, spray with **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at a concentration of 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   For localized outbreaks in nursery beds, dusting with **Malathion** 5% Dust at a rate of 20-25 kg per acre can be considered.

### Painted Bug Control in Poplar

This is not known to affect Poplar. Painted bug (Bagrada hilaris) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops like mustard, cabbage, and radish.

### Red Cotton Bug Control in Poplar

This is not known to affect Poplar. Red cotton bug (Dysdercus cingulatus) is a major pest of cotton and other malvaceous plants, feeding on developing seeds.

### Black Ants Control in Poplar

Black ants are generally not direct pests that cause significant damage to Poplar trees by feeding on them. Their presence often indicates other underlying issues or they might be a nuisance.

*   **Identify the Root Cause:**
    *   **Presence of Sap-Sucking Pests:** Black ants are often found tending to sap-sucking insects like aphids, scale insects, or mealybugs on Poplar trees, as they feed on the honeydew secreted by these pests. In such cases, the primary focus should be on controlling the sap-sucking pests.
    *   **Nesting in Damaged Wood:** Ants might be nesting in decaying or damaged wood of the Poplar tree, which could indicate a prior fungal infection or wood borer activity.
*   **Direct Control (if ants are a nuisance, interfering with nursery operations, or protecting young grafts/saplings):**
    *   Apply a drench around the base of the tree or spray directly on ant trails and nests with **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at a concentration of 2.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   Alternatively, use ant baits containing **Fipronil**. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for application rates, which are typically provided in grams per bait station or per unit area.
    *   For general surface treatment around the base of trees to deter ants, **Cypermethrin** 25% EC can be sprayed at a concentration of 0.5 ml per litre of water.
