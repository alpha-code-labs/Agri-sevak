As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I must clarify the nature of Poplar cultivation before addressing your query.

Poplar (Populus spp.) is primarily cultivated for its timber, which is used in plywood, matchwood, paper, and packaging industries. It is not grown for edible fruit. Therefore, the concepts of "fruit quality" and "storage life" as they apply to horticultural crops are not relevant to Poplar cultivation. Poplar produces catkins (flowers) and then small capsules containing seeds, but these are not harvested or consumed.

However, we can certainly discuss strategies to improve the **yield** of Poplar timber, which is the primary economic output.

To improve Poplar timber yield in Haryana, consider the following scientifically verified practices:

1.  **Selection of High-Yielding Clones:**
    *   Choose improved, fast-growing clones that are well-adapted to the agro-climatic conditions of Haryana and resistant to common pests and diseases.
    *   Recommended clones for Haryana include *Populus deltoides* clones such as G-48, W-29, S7C15, Kranti, Tarun, and Udai. These clones have demonstrated superior growth rates and timber volume.

2.  **Optimal Planting Density and Spacing:**
    *   Proper spacing is crucial for maximizing timber volume and quality. Common spacings in Haryana are:
        *   **5m x 4m** (500 plants/acre) or **5m x 5m** (400 plants/acre) for pure plantations.
        *   **6m x 2m** (333 plants/acre) or **8m x 2m** (250 plants/acre) when intercropping with agricultural crops like wheat, sugarcane, or fodder crops.
    *   Closer spacing initially can lead to higher early yields but may require thinning later to maintain growth and timber quality.

3.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Basal Application:** Incorporate 8-10 kg of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost per pit at the time of planting.
    *   **Chemical Fertilizers:** Apply fertilizers based on soil test recommendations. A general recommendation for young plants (1-3 years) is:
        *   **Nitrogen (N):** 80-120 g per plant per year, applied in two split doses (March and July). Use **Urea** (46% N).
        *   **Phosphorus (P2O5):** 40-60 g per plant per year, applied once a year (March). Use **Single Super Phosphate** (16% P2O5).
        *   **Potassium (K2O):** 40-60 g per plant per year, applied once a year (March). Use **Muriate of Potash** (60% K2O).
    *   For older trees (4 years onwards), increase the dosage proportionally.
    *   **Micronutrients:** If soil tests indicate deficiencies, apply micronutrient mixtures containing Zinc, Iron, Manganese, and Boron as foliar sprays or soil application.

4.  **Water Management (Irrigation):**
    *   Poplar is a water-loving species. Regular irrigation is critical, especially during the establishment phase and dry periods.
    *   Irrigate immediately after planting.
    *   During the first year, irrigate every 7-10 days in summer and 15-20 days in winter.
    *   For established trees, irrigate every 15-20 days in summer and monthly in winter, depending on soil moisture and rainfall.
    *   Drip irrigation can be highly efficient, especially in water-scarce areas.

5.  **Weed Management:**
    *   Weeds compete with young Poplar plants for water, nutrients, and sunlight, significantly reducing growth.
    *   **Manual Weeding:** Regular weeding and hoeing around the plants, especially during the first 2-3 years.
    *   **Mechanical Cultivation:** Inter-row cultivation can control weeds in wider spacings.
    *   **Herbicides:**
        *   **Pre-emergent:** Apply **Pendimethalin** @ 1.0-1.5 kg a.i./acre (2.5-3.75 L of 30% EC formulation) within 2-3 days of planting on moist soil.
        *   **Post-emergent (non-selective):** For established weeds, use **Glyphosate** @ 1.0-1.5 kg a.i./acre (2.0-3.0 L of 41% SL formulation) as a directed spray, avoiding contact with Poplar foliage.

6.  **Pest and Disease Management:**
    *   Regular monitoring for pests (e.g., defoliators, stem borers) and diseases (e.g., rust, leaf spots).
    *   Adopt integrated pest and disease management (IPM) strategies.
    *   For specific outbreaks, consult HAU experts for precise recommendations and CIBRC-approved chemical controls.

7.  **Pruning:**
    *   Timely pruning of lower branches is essential to produce a clear, knot-free bole, which fetches a better price and improves timber quality.
    *   Start pruning from the second year, removing 1/3rd of the total height of the tree each year. Avoid excessive pruning at once.

By implementing these practices diligently, Poplar growers in Haryana can significantly enhance their timber yield and economic returns.
