Mites, including Red spider mites (e.g., *Tetranychus urticae*) and Rust mites (e.g., *Aceria spp.*), are significant pests of Poplar (*Populus spp.*) in Haryana, especially during hot and dry periods. They can cause considerable damage, leading to reduced photosynthetic efficiency, defoliation, and stunted growth.

Here's a scientifically verified approach for their control:

**Symptoms of Mite Infestation:**
*   **Red Spider Mites:** Fine stippling (tiny yellow or white spots) on the upper leaf surface, bronzing or yellowing of leaves, premature leaf drop. In severe cases, fine webbing may be visible on the undersides of leaves and between leaves.
*   **Rust Mites:** Russeting, bronzing, or a "dusty" appearance on leaves, often accompanied by leaf curling or distortion. These mites are microscopic and not easily visible without magnification.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Approach:**

1.  **Monitoring:**
    *   Regularly inspect Poplar trees, especially the undersides of leaves, for early signs of mite infestation. A hand lens can be useful for detecting mites and their eggs.
    *   Pay close attention during dry and warm weather, which favors mite multiplication.

2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Maintain Tree Health:** Ensure proper irrigation and nutrient management to keep trees vigorous, as stressed trees are more susceptible to mite attacks.
    *   **Water Sprays:** For small-scale infestations or young trees, a strong stream of water can dislodge mites from the leaves, particularly from the undersides.
    *   **Weed Control:** Remove weeds around Poplar trees, as many weeds can serve as alternate hosts for mites.

3.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Conserve natural enemies such as predatory mites (*Amblyseius spp.*), lady beetles, lacewings, and minute pirate bugs, which feed on pest mites. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that can harm these beneficial insects.

4.  **Chemical Control (Acaricides):**
    When mite populations are high and causing significant damage, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where mites reside. Rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

    **CIBRC Approved Acaricides for Poplar Mites:**

    *   **Spiromesifen** (240 SC): Apply at 0.5-1 ml per litre of water. Effective against all stages of spider mites.
    *   **Fenpyroximate** (5 SC): Apply at 0.5-1 ml per litre of water. Provides quick knockdown and good residual activity against spider mites.
    *   **Propargite** (57 EC): Apply at 1.5-2 ml per litre of water. A specific acaricide effective against a wide range of spider mites.
    *   **Hexythiazox** (5.45 EC): Apply at 0.5 ml per litre of water. Primarily an ovicide and larvicide, effective against mite eggs and nymphs, providing long-term control. Use in rotation.
    *   **Fenazaquin** (10 EC): Apply at 1-1.5 ml per litre of water. Acts by contact and stomach action, effective against all developmental stages of mites.
    *   **Abamectin** (1.9 EC): Apply at 0.5 ml per litre of water. A translaminar acaricide that provides good control of spider mites.
    *   **Wettable Sulphur** (80 WP): Apply at 2-3 grams per litre of water. Effective against both spider mites and rust mites, especially in early stages of infestation. It also has fungicidal properties.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Timing:** Apply acaricides when mite populations are building up, before they reach damaging levels.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure complete coverage of the foliage, particularly the undersides of leaves, for effective control.
*   **Resistance Management:** Always rotate different classes of acaricides to prevent mites from developing resistance to a particular chemical.
*   **Safety:** Always read and follow the instructions on the product label, including recommended dosage, safety precautions, and pre-harvest intervals. Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during application.
