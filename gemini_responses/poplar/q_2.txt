As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide scientifically verified advice for managing rust diseases in Poplar, specifically relevant to conditions in Haryana.

It is crucial to first clarify the specific rust diseases that affect Poplar, as the terms "Black, Brown, Yellow, White, and Red rust" are often used for diseases on other crops.

1.  **Black, Brown, and Yellow rusts**: These are primarily diseases of cereal crops (e.g., wheat) caused by *Puccinia* species and are **not known to significantly affect Poplar**.
2.  **White rust**: This disease is caused by *Albugo* species and primarily affects cruciferous plants (e.g., mustard, radish); it is **not known to affect Poplar**.
3.  **Red rust**: While *Melampsora* rust, the primary rust of Poplar, can exhibit orange-yellow to reddish-brown pustules, the term 'Red rust' is not a standard classification for Poplar rust disease.

The most significant and common rust disease affecting Poplar in Haryana and globally is **Poplar Rust**, primarily caused by various species of the fungus *Melampsora* (e.g., *Melampsora larici-populina*, *M. allii-populina*, *M. medusae*). Our recommendations will focus on the control of *Melampsora* rust.

**Symptoms of *Melampsora* Rust on Poplar:**

*   Small, bright orange-yellow pustules (uredinia) appear predominantly on the underside of leaves, often in late monsoon or post-monsoon periods.
*   These pustules release powdery spores that can spread rapidly.
*   As the season progresses, these pustules may turn reddish-brown to black (telia), especially on older leaves.
*   Severe infection leads to premature defoliation, reduced growth, and can weaken young trees, making them susceptible to other stresses.

**Integrated Management Strategy for *Melampsora* Rust in Poplar:**

An integrated approach combining cultural practices and judicious chemical application is most effective.

**A. Cultural and Preventive Measures:**

1.  **Resistant Varieties**: The most sustainable and effective long-term solution is to plant rust-resistant Poplar clones. HAU recommends specific clones suitable for Haryana that show good resistance to prevalent rust strains. Consult with HAU's forestry or agroforestry department for the latest recommendations on resistant varieties.
2.  **Nursery Hygiene**: Ensure planting material is disease-free. Inspect cuttings and saplings for any signs of rust before planting.
3.  **Proper Spacing**: Maintain adequate spacing between trees to ensure good air circulation, which helps reduce leaf wetness and humidity, thereby inhibiting fungal development.
4.  **Nutrient Management**: Ensure balanced fertilization. Over-fertilization with nitrogen can sometimes lead to lush, succulent growth that may be more susceptible to disease.
5.  **Weed Control**: Keep the area around Poplar trees free of weeds, as some weeds can act as alternate hosts for rust fungi or impede air circulation.
6.  **Sanitation**: Collect and destroy fallen infected leaves, especially before the onset of winter, to reduce the inoculum for the next season.

**B. Chemical Control (Fungicides):**

Chemical control is generally recommended when rust incidence is high, especially in nurseries or young plantations, or on susceptible clones. Apply fungicides preventively at the first sign of disease or when conditions are favorable for rust development (high humidity, moderate temperatures).

**Always ensure thorough coverage of the foliage, especially the underside of leaves.**

1.  **Systemic Fungicides (for curative and protective action):**
    *   **Propiconazole**: Apply at 0.5-1.0 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Difenoconazole**: Apply at 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin**: Apply at 0.5-1.0 ml per litre of water.

2.  **Contact Fungicides (for protective action):**
    *   **Mancozeb**: Apply at 2.0-2.5 g per litre of water.

**Application Guidelines:**

*   Initiate spraying at the first appearance of rust symptoms or when weather conditions are conducive for disease development (e.g., during the monsoon season).
*   Repeat applications at 10-15 day intervals, depending on disease severity and weather conditions.
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action (e.g., Triazoles like Propiconazole/Difenoconazole with Strobilurins like Azoxystrobin or Dithiocarbamates like Mancozeb) to prevent the development of fungicide resistance.
*   For large plantations, consider using power sprayers or mist blowers for efficient coverage.

**Important Note:** Always read and follow the instructions on the fungicide label for specific dosage, safety precautions, and pre-harvest intervals. Consult with local agricultural extension officers or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and the Poplar clones you are growing.
