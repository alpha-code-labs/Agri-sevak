Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies are significant pests of Poplar in Haryana, causing damage ranging from defoliation to stem boring. Effective management requires an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, mechanical, biological, and chemical methods.

**General Management Strategies (Integrated Pest Management - IPM):**

*   **Regular Monitoring:** Regularly inspect Poplar plantations, especially young trees, for signs of pest activity (e.g., chewed leaves, frass, exit holes, wilting shoots). Early detection is crucial for effective control.
*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Use healthy, pest-free planting material from reputable nurseries.
    *   Maintain optimal tree health through proper nutrition and irrigation to enhance natural resistance.
    *   Remove and destroy severely infested branches or trees to reduce pest reservoirs.
    *   Practice good sanitation by removing fallen leaves and debris, which can harbor pests.
*   **Mechanical Control:**
    *   For early infestations of defoliating pests (e.g., leaf beetle larvae, sawfly larvae), hand-picking can be effective on young trees.
    *   Prune and destroy infested branches showing signs of borer activity (e.g., wilting, frass, exit holes).
*   **Biological Control:** Encourage natural enemies like parasitic wasps and predatory beetles, which can help keep pest populations in check. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

**Chemical Control (Use only when pest populations reach economic thresholds and other methods are insufficient):**

**A. For Defoliating Beetles (e.g., Poplar Leaf Beetles) and Sawflies (larvae and adults):**
These pests primarily feed on leaves. Apply foliar sprays when significant defoliation is observed, targeting larvae and adults.

*   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** Apply at a rate of **0.5 - 1.0 ml per litre of water**.
*   **Cypermethrin 25% EC:** Apply at a rate of **0.5 ml per litre of water**.
*   **Emamectin Benzoate 5% SG:** Apply at a rate of **0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water**, particularly effective against larval stages.
*   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at a rate of **0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water**.

**B. For Borer Beetles (e.g., Poplar Borers) and Weevils (larvae inside wood):**
These pests bore into stems and branches. Control often involves systemic insecticides or direct application to borer holes.

*   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:**
    *   **Soil Drench:** Apply **1-2 ml per litre of water**, drenching the soil around the base of the tree, especially for young trees.
    *   **Trunk Injection:** For older trees, consult with an expert for precise trunk injection techniques and dosages (typically **1-2 ml per tree**, diluted, depending on tree girth).
*   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC:**
    *   **Spot Treatment/Painting:** For active borer holes, inject **2-3 ml** of undiluted or slightly diluted (1:1 with water) chemical into the hole using a syringe, then plug the hole with mud.
    *   **Basal Drench:** Apply **2-2.5 ml per litre of water** as a drench around the base of infested trees.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Timing:** Apply insecticides at the most vulnerable stage of the pest (e.g., young larvae for defoliators, before borers enter deep into the wood).
*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough coverage of foliage for defoliators and targeted application for borers.
*   **Safety:** Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the pesticide label, including safety precautions, dosage, and pre-harvest intervals. Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, and protective clothing.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.
*   **Environmental Impact:** Be mindful of non-target organisms and the environment. Avoid spraying during flowering periods to protect pollinators.
