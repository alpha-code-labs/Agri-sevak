Protecting Poplar plantations from wild animals is crucial for successful establishment and growth, especially in areas bordering forests or with significant wildlife populations in Haryana. The primary damage observed includes browsing of young shoots, debarking, and uprooting of saplings by animals such as Nilgai (Blue Bull), Wild Boar, Porcupines, and Rabbits. An integrated approach combining physical barriers and repellents is most effective.

Here are the recommended methods:

1.  **Physical Barriers:**
    *   **Perimeter Fencing:** For larger plantations, a robust perimeter fence is the most effective deterrent. This can include:
        *   **Barbed Wire Fencing:** Multiple strands (5-7) at appropriate heights (up to 1.5-2 meters) can deter larger animals like Nilgai.
        *   **Woven Wire Mesh Fencing:** A mesh fence (e.g., 1.2-1.5 meters high with smaller mesh size at the bottom) is effective against smaller animals like rabbits and wild boar, especially when combined with a barbed wire top.
        *   **Electric Fencing:** A pulsed electric fence can be highly effective but requires careful installation, regular maintenance, and strict adherence to safety regulations.
    *   **Individual Tree Guards:** For smaller plantations or individual trees, installing guards around each sapling provides direct protection.
        *   **Plastic Mesh Guards:** Cylindrical guards made of durable plastic mesh (e.g., 60-90 cm high) protect young stems from browsing and debarking.
        *   **Bamboo/Thorn Guards:** Locally available bamboo stakes or thorny branches can be used to create a protective cage around young saplings.
        *   **Metal Cages:** More durable but also more expensive, suitable for high-value trees.

2.  **Repellents:**
    Chemical repellents can offer temporary protection, especially for young saplings, but require reapplication after rain or over time. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions for specific product formulations.
    *   **Thiram:** This fungicide is also approved as an animal repellent. It can be applied as a paint-on slurry (e.g., 10-20 g of 75% WP formulation per litre of water) to the lower stems of young trees, or as a spray (e.g., 5-10 g of 75% WP formulation per litre of water) on vulnerable parts.
    *   **Azadirachtin:** Neem-based formulations containing **Azadirachtin** (e.g., 1% EC) can act as a repellent due to their bitter taste and anti-feedant properties. Apply as a foliar spray at a rate of 2-5 ml per litre of water on young leaves and shoots.
    *   **Capsaicin:** Formulations containing **Capsaicin** (chilli extract) can deter animals due to their irritating properties. Apply as a spray to vulnerable parts of the tree, strictly following product-specific recommendations for dilution and frequency.
    *   **Putrescent Egg Solids:** Products containing putrescent egg solids are effective as taste and odor repellents for deer and other browsing animals. Apply as per manufacturer's guidelines, typically as a foliar spray.

3.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Planting Mature Saplings:** Using older, taller saplings (e.g., 2-3 meters tall) can reduce vulnerability to browsing, as the tender shoots are out of reach for many animals.
    *   **Site Selection:** Where possible, avoid planting new Poplar plantations in areas known for very high densities of browsing animals, or ensure robust protection measures are in place.
    *   **Regular Monitoring:** Regularly inspect the plantation for signs of animal damage and promptly repair any breaches in fencing or reapply repellents as needed.
