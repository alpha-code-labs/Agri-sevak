As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Poplar in Haryana:

### 1. Borers in Poplar

Poplar trees are susceptible to various borers, including stem borers and root borers, which can cause significant damage, leading to weakening or even death of the tree.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural and Mechanical:**
    *   Regularly inspect trees for signs of borer attack (e.g., frass, exit holes, wilting branches).
    *   Remove and destroy severely infested branches or trees to prevent further spread.
    *   Maintain tree health through proper irrigation and nutrition to enhance natural resistance.
    *   Use healthy, borer-free planting material.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **For Stem Borers (injecting into boreholes or swabbing):**
        *   Prepare a solution of **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 2.5 ml/L of water. Inject this solution into active boreholes using a syringe, then plug the hole with mud. Alternatively, swab the affected stem portion.
        *   For young trees or as a preventive measure, drenching the base of the tree with **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL at 0.5-1 ml/L of water can provide systemic protection.
    *   **For Root Borers (drenching):**
        *   Drench the soil around the base of the infested tree with **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 2.5 ml/L of water, ensuring the solution penetrates the root zone.
        *   Alternatively, use **Fipronil** 5% SC at 1.5-2 ml/L of water for soil drenching.

### 2. Caterpillars and Leaf Folder in Poplar

Poplar trees are commonly affected by various defoliating caterpillars (e.g., *Clostera* species, *Lymantria* species) that feed on leaves, sometimes causing leaf folding or rolling. Severe infestations can lead to significant defoliation and reduced growth.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural and Mechanical:**
    *   Regularly monitor trees for caterpillar presence, especially during periods of active growth.
    *   Hand-pick and destroy caterpillars or egg masses on young trees if the infestation is localized.
    *   Encourage natural enemies like birds, predatory insects, and parasitic wasps.
*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
    *   For effective control of caterpillars, including those causing leaf folding, spray the foliage thoroughly.
    *   **Emamectin Benzoate** 5% SG: 0.2-0.4 g/L of water.
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC: 0.2 ml/L of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Quinalphos** 25% EC: 2 ml/L of water.
    *   For biological control, especially for young larvae, consider using formulations of *Bacillus thuringiensis* (Bt) as per manufacturer's recommendations (typically 1-2 g/L or ml/L of water).

### 3. Diamondback Moth

This is not known to affect Poplar. The Diamondback moth (*Plutella xylostella*) is a major pest primarily of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower, mustard).

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label for safe handling, application, and pre-harvest intervals.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during chemical application.
*   Ensure thorough coverage of the target area for effective control.
*   Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, mechanical, and biological methods with judicious use of chemicals, is recommended for sustainable pest management in Poplar.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension services or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your local conditions and pest pressure.
