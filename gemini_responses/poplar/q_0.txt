As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Poplar in Haryana.

Effective management of fungal diseases in Poplar relies on an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural practices with judicious use of CIBRC-approved fungicides when necessary.

Here's how to control the mentioned fungal diseases in Poplar:

### General Cultural Practices for Fungal Disease Management:

*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available and suitable for local conditions, plant disease-resistant Poplar clones.
*   **Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy fallen infected leaves and pruned branches, especially during autumn and winter, to reduce inoculum for the next season.
*   **Pruning:** Prune infected branches during dry periods to remove diseased tissue and improve air circulation within the canopy.
*   **Spacing:** Maintain adequate spacing between trees to ensure good air circulation, which helps reduce leaf wetness and fungal development.
*   **Nutrition:** Ensure balanced fertilization to promote tree vigor without excessive succulent growth, which can be more susceptible to certain diseases.
*   **Water Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation late in the day, allowing foliage to dry before nightfall.

### Specific Disease Management:

#### 1. Alternaria Leaf Spot/Blight (e.g., *Alternaria alternata*)

*   **Cultural Practices:** As above, focusing on sanitation and improving air circulation.
*   **Chemical Control (Fungicides):** Apply at the first sign of disease, repeating as per label instructions, especially during periods conducive to disease development (warm, humid weather).
    *   **Mancozeb:** 2.5-3.0 g/L of water.
    *   **Chlorothalonil:** 2.0-2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Propiconazole:** 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water.
    *   **Difenoconazole:** 0.2-0.3 ml/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin:** 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water.

#### 2. Anthracnose (e.g., *Drepanopeziza brunnea*, formerly *Marssonina brunnea*)

This is one of the most significant diseases of Poplar in many regions, including parts of India.

*   **Cultural Practices:** Crucial for management. Remove and destroy infected leaves and twigs. Prune to improve air circulation.
*   **Chemical Control (Fungicides):** Begin applications when leaves are half to fully expanded and continue at regular intervals, especially during wet periods.
    *   **Mancozeb:** 2.5-3.0 g/L of water.
    *   **Chlorothalonil:** 2.0-2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Propiconazole:** 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water.
    *   **Difenoconazole:** 0.2-0.3 ml/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin:** 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water.
    *   **Carbendazim:** 0.5-1.0 g/L of water (Note: Rotate with other fungicide groups to prevent resistance development).

#### 3. Blast

This is not known to affect Poplar.

#### 4. Blight (General Leaf Blight, often caused by *Marssonina*, *Septoria*, or *Alternaria*)

Blight is a symptom often associated with severe leaf spot diseases. Management is similar to Anthracnose and Alternaria.

*   **Cultural Practices:** As described above.
*   **Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
    *   **Mancozeb:** 2.5-3.0 g/L of water.
    *   **Chlorothalonil:** 2.0-2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Propiconazole:** 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water.
    *   **Difenoconazole:** 0.2-0.3 ml/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin:** 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water.
    *   **Carbendazim:** 0.5-1.0 g/L of water.

#### 5. Brown Spot (General Leaf Spot, often caused by *Marssonina*, *Septoria*, or *Alternaria*)

Brown spot is a common symptom of various leaf spot diseases in Poplar. Management is similar to Anthracnose and Alternaria.

*   **Cultural Practices:** As described above.
*   **Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
    *   **Mancozeb:** 2.5-3.0 g/L of water.
    *   **Chlorothalonil:** 2.0-2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Propiconazole:** 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water.
    *   **Difenoconazole:** 0.2-0.3 ml/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin:** 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water.
    *   **Carbendazim:** 0.5-1.0 g/L of water.

#### 6. Downy Mildew

This is not known to affect Poplar.

#### 7. Powdery Mildew (e.g., *Erysiphe adunca*, formerly *Uncinula adunca*)

*   **Cultural Practices:** Improve air circulation through proper spacing and pruning.
*   **Chemical Control (Fungicides):** Apply at the first sign of white powdery growth on leaves.
    *   **Sulphur (Wettable Powder):** 3.0-5.0 g/L of water. (Note: Do not apply when temperatures are very high, as it can cause phytotoxicity).
    *   **Myclobutanil:** 0.3-0.4 ml/L of water.
    *   **Penconazole:** 0.2-0.3 ml/L of water.
    *   **Hexaconazole:** 0.4-0.6 ml/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin:** 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water.

#### 8. Grey Mildew

This is not known to affect Poplar.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the fungicide label for dosage, application timing, safety precautions, and pre-harvest intervals.
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of fungicide resistance.
*   For specific local conditions and precise recommendations, it is always advisable to consult with the local agricultural extension office or HAU experts.
