Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding the "drying up" of Poplar trees, which manifests as drying branches, leaves, fruits (catkins), and flowers. This is a general symptom and can be indicative of various underlying issues, both biotic (diseases, pests) and abiotic (environmental stress).

To effectively address this, a thorough diagnosis is crucial. I recommend carefully observing the affected trees for specific signs and symptoms. Here's a comprehensive approach to identify and manage the potential causes in Poplar in Haryana:

**I. Initial Steps for Diagnosis:**

1.  **Observe the Pattern:** Is the drying localized to a few branches, or is it affecting the entire tree? Is it sudden or gradual?
2.  **Examine the Bark:** Look for cracks, cankers (sunken lesions), discoloration, or oozing sap on the trunk and branches.
3.  **Inspect Leaves:** Check for spots, discoloration, wilting, or insect damage.
4.  **Check for Pests:** Look for boreholes, frass (sawdust-like material), or insects on the trunk, branches, and leaves.
5.  **Examine Roots (if possible):** Look for signs of rot, damage, or galls.
6.  **Consider Environmental Factors:** Recent changes in irrigation, extreme weather (drought, frost, heatwave), or soil conditions.

**II. Potential Causes and Management Strategies:**

**A. Abiotic Stresses (Non-Biological Factors):**

1.  **Water Stress (Drought or Waterlogging):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Leaves wilt, turn yellow/brown, and dry up. Branches may die back from the tips.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Drought:** Ensure consistent and adequate irrigation, especially during dry periods and for young trees. Poplars are high water users.
        *   **Waterlogging:** Improve soil drainage. Avoid planting in areas prone to water accumulation. Raised beds can be beneficial in such areas.
2.  **Nutrient Deficiencies:**
    *   **Symptoms:** General decline, poor growth, specific leaf discoloration before drying. Boron deficiency can cause dieback of terminal shoots and branches.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Conduct a soil test to determine specific nutrient deficiencies.
        *   For **Boron deficiency**: Apply **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate) as a foliar spray at 1-2 g/L water, or soil application at 10-20 g per tree, depending on tree size and deficiency severity.
        *   Apply balanced NPK fertilizers as per soil test recommendations.
3.  **Salinity/Alkalinity:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, marginal leaf scorch, premature leaf drop, and eventual branch dieback.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Conduct soil and water quality tests.
        *   If salinity is an issue, apply gypsum (Calcium sulfate dihydrate) as per soil test recommendations to improve soil structure and leach salts.
        *   Use good quality irrigation water.
4.  **Frost Damage:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Young shoots and leaves turn black and dry up, especially after a sudden drop in temperature.
    *   **Management:** Protect young trees during severe frost by covering them or using smoke screens. Avoid late-season fertilization that promotes tender growth.
5.  **Mechanical Injury/Girdling:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Drying of branches or the entire tree above the point of injury (e.g., from farm machinery, rodents, or improper staking).
    *   **Management:** Prevent injuries. Protect tree bases from rodents. Prune damaged branches cleanly.

**B. Biotic Stresses (Diseases and Pests):**

1.  **Canker Diseases (e.g., *Cytospora canker*, *Dothiorella canker*):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Sunken, discolored lesions (cankers) on branches or the main stem. Bark may crack, and sap may ooze. Branches above the canker wilt and dry up.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Prune affected branches well below the canker into healthy wood. Disinfect pruning tools between cuts with a 10% bleach solution.
        *   Apply a protective fungicidal paste or spray to pruning wounds and affected areas.
        *   **Chemicals:**
            *   **Copper Oxychloride** (50% WP): 3 g/L water (as a spray or mixed into a paste).
            *   **Carbendazim** (50% WP): 1 g/L water (as a spray or mixed into a paste).
2.  **Root Rot (e.g., *Fusarium*, *Phytophthora* spp.):**
    *   **Symptoms:** General yellowing, wilting, stunted growth, and eventual drying of the entire tree or major branches. Roots may appear discolored, soft, and decayed.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Improve soil drainage. Avoid overwatering.
        *   Remove severely affected trees.
        *   For early stages, a fungicidal drench around the root zone can be considered.
        *   **Chemicals:**
            *   **Propamocarb Hydrochloride** (72.2% SL): 2.5 ml/L water (drench around the root zone).
            *   **Carbendazim** (50% WP): 1 g/L water (drench around the root zone for *Fusarium* type rots).
3.  **Stem Borers (e.g., *Batocera rufomaculata* - Poplar Stem Borer):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Presence of boreholes on the trunk or branches, sawdust-like frass near the holes, wilting and drying of branches above the point of attack.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Locate boreholes and mechanically remove larvae using a wire.
        *   Inject insecticides into the boreholes and plug them with mud or cotton.
        *   **Chemicals:**
            *   **Chlorpyrifos** (20% EC): 2 ml/L water (inject into boreholes).
            *   **Imidacloprid** (17.8% SL): 0.5 ml/L water (inject into boreholes).

**III. General Cultural Practices for Poplar Health:**

*   **Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy fallen leaves, dead branches, and other plant debris to reduce disease inoculum.
*   **Pruning:** Prune dead, diseased, or crossing branches during the dormant season. Make clean cuts close to the branch collar.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure trees receive adequate and balanced nutrients based on soil testing.
*   **Proper Planting:** Plant trees at the correct depth, avoiding deep planting which can lead to root issues.
*   **Weed Control:** Keep the area around the tree base free of weeds to reduce competition for water and nutrients.
*   **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect trees for any signs of stress, disease, or pest infestation to allow for early intervention.

If you are unable to identify the specific cause, I strongly recommend collecting samples (affected branches, leaves, or bark) and contacting the Department of Forestry or Plant Pathology at HAU, Hisar, for a definitive diagnosis and tailored recommendations.
