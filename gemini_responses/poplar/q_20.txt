Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the critical importance of balanced nutrition for optimal Poplar growth and yield in Haryana's agro-climatic conditions. Micronutrient deficiencies can significantly impact tree health and productivity.

Before any application, it is **crucial to conduct soil and leaf tissue analysis** to accurately diagnose the specific deficiency and its severity. Blind application can lead to imbalances or toxicity.

Here's how to address common micronutrient deficiencies in Poplar:

### General Recommendations for Micronutrient Management:

1.  **Accurate Diagnosis:** Observe visual symptoms, but always confirm with soil and leaf tissue analysis.
2.  **Soil pH Management:** Many micronutrients become less available in alkaline soils, which are common in parts of Haryana. Maintaining an optimal soil pH (typically 6.0-7.0 for Poplar) is key.
3.  **Organic Matter:** Incorporating organic matter (farmyard manure, compost) improves soil structure, water retention, and micronutrient availability.
4.  **Application Method:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Provides quick relief, especially for mobile nutrients or when soil conditions limit uptake. Best applied in the morning or late afternoon.
    *   **Soil Application:** For long-term correction, especially for immobile nutrients or severe deficiencies.

### Specific Micronutrient Deficiencies and Their Management in Poplar:

#### 1. Zinc (Zn)

*   **Symptoms:** Small, narrow, distorted leaves (often called "little leaf"), reduced internode length leading to a rosetted appearance, interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, and stunted growth.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** (21% Zn): 2.5-5 g/L of water.
        *   **Zinc EDTA** (12% Zn): 0.5-1 g/L of water.
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 15-20 day intervals, starting when new flush appears.
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** (21% Zn): 10-25 kg/acre, applied annually or biennially, broadcast or banded near the root zone.
        *   **Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate** (33% Zn): 7-15 kg/acre.

#### 2. Iron (Fe) / Ferrous

*   **Symptoms:** Pronounced interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on young leaves, with veins remaining green. In severe cases, leaves may turn completely yellow or even white, leading to necrosis and dieback.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   **Ferrous Sulphate** (19% Fe): 5-10 g/L of water.
        *   **Iron EDTA** (12% Fe): 0.5-1 g/L of water.
        *   **Iron DTPA** (10% Fe): 0.5-1 g/L of water (effective in slightly alkaline soils).
        *   **Iron EDDHA** (6% Fe): 0.5-1 g/L of water (most effective in highly alkaline soils).
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals.
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   **Ferrous Sulphate** (19% Fe): 20-50 kg/acre, especially if soil pH is acidic to neutral.
        *   **Iron DTPA** or **Iron EDDHA**: 2-5 kg/acre, preferred for alkaline soils.

#### 3. Boron (B)

*   **Symptoms:** Dieback of terminal buds and growing points, leading to bushy growth. Young leaves may be distorted, thick, brittle, and dark green. Stems may show cracking, and internal necrosis can occur.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (20% B): 1-2 g/L of water.
        *   **Borax** (10.5% B): 2-4 g/L of water.
        *   Apply 1-2 sprays during active growth.
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   **Borax** (10.5% B): 5-10 kg/acre.
        *   **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (20% B): 2-4 kg/acre.
        *   Apply cautiously, as Boron can be toxic in excess.

#### 4. Calcium (Ca)

*   **Symptoms:** Dieback of growing points and young shoots. New leaves are often distorted, small, and may show tip burn or marginal necrosis. Root growth is severely impaired.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   **Calcium Nitrate** (19% Ca): 5-10 g/L of water.
        *   **Calcium Chloride** (27% Ca): 2-5 g/L of water.
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays during active growth.
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   **Gypsum** (Calcium Sulphate Dihydrate): 200-500 kg/acre (especially beneficial in sodic soils common in Haryana).
        *   **Calcium Nitrate** (19% Ca): 20-40 kg/acre.
        *   **Calcium Carbonate** (Lime): If soil pH is low and calcium is deficient.

#### 5. Magnesium (Mg)

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, starting from the margins and progressing inwards, with veins remaining green. Leaves may become brittle and develop purplish or reddish tints in severe cases.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   **Magnesium Sulphate** (Epsom Salt, 9.6% Mg): 5-10 g/L of water.
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 15-20 day intervals.
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   **Magnesium Sulphate** (9.6% Mg): 20-50 kg/acre.
        *   **Dolomite** (Calcium Magnesium Carbonate): If soil pH is acidic and both Ca and Mg are deficient.

#### 6. Manganese (Mn)

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, similar to iron deficiency but often with small necrotic spots or speckling. Growth may be stunted.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   **Manganese Sulphate** (30.5% Mn): 2.5-5 g/L of water.
        *   **Manganese EDTA** (12% Mn): 0.5-1 g/L of water.
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays during active growth.
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   **Manganese Sulphate** (30.5% Mn): 10-20 kg/acre.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Water Quality:** Use clean water for foliar sprays. Hard water can reduce the efficacy of some chemicals.
*   **Adjuvants:** Adding a non-ionic spreader/sticker (0.5 ml/L) to foliar sprays can improve leaf coverage and absorption.
*   **Timing:** Avoid spraying during hot midday sun to prevent leaf scorching. Early morning or late afternoon is ideal.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management:** Combine chemical applications with organic matter addition and proper irrigation practices for sustainable Poplar health.
