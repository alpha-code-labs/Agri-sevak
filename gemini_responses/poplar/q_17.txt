Organic manures are crucial for improving soil health, fertility, and water retention, which are vital for the healthy growth of Poplar trees in Haryana. Here are the recommended doses for **Farm Yard Manure (FYM)**, **Vermicompost**, and **Sagarika**:

*   **Farm Yard Manure (FYM)**
    *   **At Planting:** Apply 10-15 kg of well-decomposed **FYM** per pit, thoroughly mixed with the soil before planting the Poplar sapling.
    *   **For Established Trees (Annual Application):** Apply 5-10 kg of well-decomposed **FYM** per tree, spread in a ring around the base of the tree (within the drip line) and lightly incorporated into the soil, preferably before the monsoon or during autumn.

*   **Vermicompost**
    *   **At Planting:** Apply 2-3 kg of **Vermicompost** per pit, mixed with the soil before planting.
    *   **For Established Trees (Annual Application):** Apply 1-2 kg of **Vermicompost** per tree, spread around the base and lightly incorporated into the soil, similar to FYM application.

*   **Sagarika (IFFCO product - Seaweed Extract based Bio-stimulant)**
    *   **Granular Form (Sagarika G):**
        *   **Dose:** Apply 8-10 kg per acre, or 100-200 g per plant, spread around the base of the tree and lightly incorporated into the soil.
        *   **Timing:** Typically applied twice a year – once during the active growth phase (e.g., spring) and again during the monsoon season.
    *   **Liquid Form (Sagarika Z):**
        *   **Foliar Spray:** Mix 2.5-3 ml of **Sagarika Z** per litre of water and spray uniformly on the foliage until runoff.
        *   **Timing:** Apply 2-3 sprays during the active growth period, with an interval of 20-30 days between sprays.
        *   **Soil Drench/Drip Irrigation:** Apply 1-2 litres of **Sagarika Z** per acre through soil drenching or drip irrigation, diluted appropriately.
        *   **Timing:** Can be applied during critical growth stages to enhance nutrient uptake and overall plant vigour.
