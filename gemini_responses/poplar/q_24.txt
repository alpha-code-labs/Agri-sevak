As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for Poplar transplantation in Haryana:

### Ideal Transplantation Time, Distance, and Process for Poplar

**1. Ideal Transplantation Time:**
The ideal time for transplanting Poplar (rooted cuttings or saplings) in Haryana is during its dormant period, which allows the plant to establish roots before the onset of active growth.
*   **Late Winter to Early Spring:** Typically, **January to February** is the most suitable period. This timing ensures that the plants are dormant and minimizes transplant shock, allowing them to benefit from the rising temperatures and available moisture for new growth in spring.

**2. Ideal Transplantation Distance (Spacing):**
The spacing for Poplar depends largely on the cultivation objective (e.g., timber production, agroforestry, boundary planting).
*   **For Timber Production (Monoculture):**
    *   **5 meters x 5 meters (5m x 5m):** This is a common spacing that allows for good crown development and timber quality.
    *   **5 meters x 4 meters (5m x 4m):** Can be used for slightly higher density, potentially requiring thinning later.
*   **For Agroforestry (Intercropping):**
    *   **6 meters x 4 meters (6m x 4m) or 5 meters x 5 meters (5m x 5m):** These wider spacings are preferred to allow sufficient sunlight and space for intercropping agricultural crops (e.g., wheat, mustard, sugarcane) between Poplar rows.
*   **For Boundary Planting/Windbreaks:**
    *   **6 meters x 2 meters (6m x 2m) or 5 meters x 2.5 meters (5m x 2.5m):** This involves planting Poplars in a single row along the field boundary, with plants spaced 2 to 2.5 meters apart within the row, and the row itself 5-6 meters from the actual field edge to minimize shading on adjacent crops.

**3. Transplantation Process:**
A meticulous approach to transplantation ensures high survival rates and healthy growth.
*   **Selection of Planting Material:**
    *   Use healthy, well-rooted cuttings or saplings (often 1-2 years old) obtained from a reputable nursery. The saplings should be free from pests and diseases.
*   **Site Preparation:**
    *   **Land Preparation:** Deep ploughing and harrowing of the field are recommended to ensure good soil aeration and drainage.
    *   **Pit Digging:** Dig pits of appropriate size, typically **60 cm x 60 cm x 60 cm** (length x width x depth), at the marked spacing.
    *   **Pit Filling:** Allow the pits to weather for a few days. Then, refill the pits with a mixture of the excavated topsoil, **10-15 kg** of well-decomposed Farmyard Manure (FYM) or compost, and **50-100 grams** of a suitable insecticide (if soil pests are a known issue, consult CIBRC approved options like **Chlorpyrifos** or **Imidacloprid** for soil application, though not always necessary for general planting). If the soil is heavy clay, adding some sand can improve drainage.
*   **Planting:**
    *   Carefully remove the sapling from its nursery bag or container, ensuring the root ball remains intact. For bare-root saplings, trim any damaged or excessively long roots.
    *   Place the sapling in the center of the prepared pit, ensuring that the root collar (the point where the stem meets the roots) is at ground level, not too deep or too shallow.
    *   Backfill the pit with the remaining soil mixture, gently firming the soil around the roots to remove any air pockets.
    *   Create a small basin or ring around the base of the plant to facilitate water retention and efficient irrigation.
*   **Post-Planting Care:**
    *   **Immediate Irrigation:** Water the newly planted saplings immediately after transplantation to settle the soil around the roots.
    *   **Staking:** If the saplings are tall or the area is prone to strong winds, provide support with a sturdy stake to prevent lodging.
    *   **Protection:** Protect young saplings from grazing animals by installing tree guards or fencing.
    *   **Weeding:** Keep the area around the saplings free of weeds, especially during the initial establishment phase, as weeds compete for water and nutrients.
    *   **Regular Irrigation:** Provide regular irrigation, especially during dry periods, to ensure proper establishment and growth.
