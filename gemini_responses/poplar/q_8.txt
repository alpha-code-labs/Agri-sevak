As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach for the effective and sustainable control of sucking pests (Aphids, Leafhopper, Whitefly, Thrips, and Psylla) in Poplar plantations in Haryana.

These pests are known to affect Poplar and can cause significant damage by sucking sap, leading to stunted growth, leaf curling, yellowing, premature defoliation, and honeydew secretion which promotes sooty mould growth.

### Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategy:

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Regular Monitoring:** Periodically inspect Poplar trees, especially the undersides of leaves and new shoots, for early detection of pest infestations. Early detection allows for timely intervention.
*   **Weed Management:** Keep the area around Poplar trees free of weeds, as many weeds can serve as alternate hosts for these sucking pests.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure balanced fertilization. Excessive nitrogen application can lead to lush, succulent growth that is more attractive and susceptible to sucking pests.
*   **Proper Irrigation:** Maintain optimal soil moisture. Stressed trees are more vulnerable to pest attacks.
*   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy heavily infested branches or leaves during early stages of infestation to reduce pest populations.

**2. Biological Control:**
*   **Conservation of Natural Enemies:** Encourage and conserve natural predators and parasitoids such as ladybird beetles (*Coccinella septempunctata*), lacewings (*Chrysoperla carnea*), hoverfly larvae, and various parasitic wasps. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that can harm these beneficial insects.
*   **Biopesticides:** In cases of moderate infestation, biopesticides can be effective:
    *   **Beauveria bassiana** (e.g., 1 x 10^8 CFU/g formulation at 5 g/L of water)
    *   **Lecanicillium lecanii** (e.g., 1 x 10^8 CFU/g formulation at 5 g/L of water)
    These fungal biopesticides infect and kill a wide range of sucking pests.

**3. Chemical Control (When infestation is severe and other methods are insufficient):**
When pest populations reach economic threshold levels, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage, especially the undersides of leaves.

*   **For general control of Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, Thrips, and Psylla:**
    *   **Imidacloprid** (e.g., 17.8% SL at 0.3-0.5 ml/L of water or 70% WG at 0.1-0.2 g/L of water)
    *   **Thiamethoxam** (e.g., 25% WG at 0.2-0.3 g/L of water)
    *   **Acetamiprid** (e.g., 20% SP at 0.2-0.4 g/L of water)

*   **For specific pest management or resistance rotation:**
    *   **Buprofezin** (e.g., 25% SC at 1.25-1.5 ml/L of water) - particularly effective against nymphs of whiteflies and leafhoppers by inhibiting chitin synthesis.
    *   **Flonicamid** (e.g., 50% WG at 0.3-0.4 g/L of water) - acts as a feeding blocker, effective against aphids and whiteflies.
    *   **Spiromesifen** (e.g., 22.9% SC at 0.6-0.8 ml/L of water) - effective against whiteflies and thrips, acts as a lipid biosynthesis inhibitor.
    *   **Pyriproxyfen** (e.g., 10% EC at 1.0-1.25 ml/L of water) - an insect growth regulator, highly effective against whiteflies by disrupting their life cycle.
    *   **Fipronil** (e.g., 5% SC at 1.0-1.5 ml/L of water) - effective against thrips and some leafhoppers.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** (e.g., 5% EC at 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water) - a broad-spectrum pyrethroid, use judiciously to minimize impact on natural enemies.

*   **Botanical Insecticide:**
    *   **Azadirachtin** (e.g., 1500 ppm EC at 3-5 ml/L of water) - acts as an antifeedant, repellent, and insect growth disruptor, effective against early infestations and as part of an IPM strategy.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always consult the product label for precise dosage, application instructions, safety precautions, and waiting periods before harvest (if applicable, though less critical for timber Poplar).
*   Apply insecticides during the cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   Ensure proper safety gear (gloves, mask, protective clothing) is used during handling and application of chemicals.
*   For large trees, specialized spray equipment may be required to ensure adequate coverage.
*   Regularly consult with local agricultural extension services or HAU experts for the latest recommendations and pest alerts specific to your region.
