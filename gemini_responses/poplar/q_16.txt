As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified fertilizer schedule for Poplar cultivation in Haryana. It is crucial to emphasize that **soil testing is the most critical first step** to determine the precise nutrient status of your land and tailor these recommendations for optimal results. Without soil testing, these are general guidelines.

**General Principles for Poplar Fertilization:**
Poplar is a fast-growing tree and requires significant nutrients, especially Nitrogen, for rapid biomass production. Phosphorus and Potassium are essential for root development, stem strength, and overall tree health. Sulphur is also important for protein synthesis and nutrient uptake.

**Recommended Fertilizer Doses:**

**1. At Planting (First Year):**
*   **Soil Application (in the planting pit):**
    *   **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP):** 50-100 g per plant.
    *   **Single Superphosphate (SSP):** 100-200 g per plant (if DAP is not used or additional P is required).
    *   **Muriate of Potash (MOP) / Potassium Chloride:** 20-30 g per plant (if soil test indicates low K).
*   **Top Dressing (1-2 months after planting):**
    *   **Urea:** 25-50 g per plant, applied in two split doses (e.g., 1 month after planting and then 2 months after planting).

**2. Subsequent Years (Year 2 onwards, increasing with tree age):**
The doses should be gradually increased each year, typically up to the 4th or 5th year, depending on the growth rate and soil test results. The following are annual recommendations per tree, to be split into 2-3 applications (e.g., February-March and June-July).

*   **Nitrogen (N):**
    *   **Urea:** 100-200 g per tree in the 2nd year, increasing by 50-100 g each subsequent year, reaching 300-500 g per tree for mature trees (4-5 years old). Apply in 2-3 split doses.
*   **Phosphorus (P):**
    *   **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP):** 50-100 g per tree per year. Apply once, preferably in February-March.
    *   **Single Superphosphate (SSP):** 150-300 g per tree per year. Apply once, preferably in February-March (can be used as an alternative or supplement to DAP, also providing Sulphur).
*   **Potassium (K):**
    *   **Muriate of Potash (MOP) / Potassium Chloride:** 50-100 g per tree per year. Apply once, preferably in February-March.
*   **Sulphur (S):**
    *   Often supplied by **Single Superphosphate (SSP)**. If not, or if deficiency is noted, apply **Elemental Sulphur** at 10-20 g per tree per year.

**3. Nano-Fertilizers (Foliar Application):**
Nano-fertilizers are highly efficient and are applied as foliar sprays, supplementing conventional soil-applied fertilizers.

*   **Nano-Urea:**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml/L of water (or 250-500 ml per acre, depending on spray volume).
    *   **Application:** Apply as a foliar spray during active growth stages (e.g., 2-3 sprays per year, 30-45 days apart, starting from March-April). This can reduce the requirement for conventional **Urea** by up to 50%.
*   **Nano-DAP:**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml/L of water (or 250-500 ml per acre, depending on spray volume).
    *   **Application:** Apply as a foliar spray, especially during early growth or when Phosphorus deficiency is suspected, or to boost flowering/fruiting (though less relevant for timber Poplar).

**4. NPK Complex Fertilizers:**
*   If soil testing indicates a balanced deficiency of N, P, and K, complex fertilizers like **NPK (e.g., 12:32:16 or 19:19:19)** can be used.
*   **Dose:** 100-200 g per tree per year, split into 2 applications (e.g., February-March and June-July). This would partially replace individual **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)** and **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** applications.

**Application Method and Timing:**

*   **Soil Application:** Fertilizers should be applied in a circular trench (ring method) 30-60 cm away from the trunk, 10-15 cm deep, and then covered with soil. This ensures nutrients are available in the root zone.
*   **Timing:**
    *   **Basal:** At the time of planting.
    *   **Top Dressing:** The first application in February-March (before the main growth flush) and the second in June-July (after the onset of monsoon).
*   **Foliar Application:** For nano-fertilizers, spray evenly on the foliage, preferably in the morning or late afternoon, avoiding hot sunny periods.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Soil Testing:** Reiterate the importance of regular soil testing (every 2-3 years) to adjust fertilizer doses.
*   **Irrigation:** Ensure adequate irrigation after applying soil-based fertilizers for proper dissolution and uptake.
*   **Organic Matter:** Incorporating farmyard manure (FYM) or compost (5-10 kg per tree annually) significantly improves soil health, nutrient retention, and fertilizer efficiency.
*   **Clone Specificity:** Different Poplar clones may have slightly varying nutrient requirements.
*   **Weed Control:** Keep the area around the trees weed-free to minimize nutrient competition.
