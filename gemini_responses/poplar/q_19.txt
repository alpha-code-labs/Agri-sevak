As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies in Poplar (Populus deltoides) in Haryana.

**General Approach:**
The most accurate way to diagnose macro-nutrient deficiencies is through a combination of visual symptom assessment and, critically, soil testing. A comprehensive soil test from a reputable lab (like HAU's own soil testing lab) will provide precise recommendations tailored to your specific field conditions.

**1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency:**

*   **Symptoms:**
    *   General yellowing (chlorosis) of older leaves, starting from the tips and margins, progressing inwards.
    *   Stunted growth, reduced leaf size, and fewer branches.
    *   Premature defoliation of older leaves.
    *   Overall pale green appearance of the tree.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   Apply nitrogenous fertilizers, preferably in split doses during the active growth periods (e.g., post-winter flush and monsoon).
    *   **Recommended Chemical:**
        *   **Urea** (46% N)
    *   **Application Rate:**
        *   For young trees (1-2 years): 50-100 g **Urea** per tree, split into 2 applications.
        *   For mature trees (3+ years): 100-200 g **Urea** per tree, split into 2-3 applications.
        *   Alternatively, 50-100 kg **Urea** per acre per year, depending on soil test results and tree density.
    *   **Method:** Apply around the root zone, ensuring it is incorporated into the soil and followed by irrigation to prevent volatilization losses.

**2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency:**

*   **Symptoms:**
    *   Dark green or purplish discoloration of older leaves, especially on the underside.
    *   Stunted root development, leading to poor anchorage and water/nutrient uptake.
    *   Reduced shoot growth and overall stunted plant development.
    *   Delayed bud break and maturity.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   Phosphorus is less mobile in the soil, so it's best applied as a basal dose or incorporated into the root zone.
    *   **Recommended Chemicals:**
        *   **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5)
        *   **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5)
    *   **Application Rate:**
        *   For young trees at planting: 100-200 g **SSP** per tree or 40-80 g **DAP** per tree, mixed well in the pit soil.
        *   For existing trees: 150-250 kg **SSP** per acre or 50-100 kg **DAP** per acre, applied in a band around the tree base and incorporated.
    *   **Method:** Apply at the time of planting or early in the growing season. Ensure good soil contact and follow with irrigation.

**3. Potassium (K) Deficiency:**

*   **Symptoms:**
    *   Yellowing (chlorosis) and browning (necrosis) of leaf margins and tips, particularly on older leaves, often described as "scorching."
    *   Weak stems and reduced resistance to lodging.
    *   Poor overall tree vigor and increased susceptibility to diseases and pests.
    *   Reduced growth and smaller leaves.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   Apply potassium-rich fertilizers.
    *   **Recommended Chemical:**
        *   **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** / **Potassium Chloride** (60% K2O)
    *   **Application Rate:**
        *   For young trees: 50-100 g **MOP** per tree.
        *   For mature trees: 100-150 g **MOP** per tree.
        *   Alternatively, 40-80 kg **MOP** per acre, depending on soil test results and tree density.
    *   **Method:** Apply around the root zone, preferably in split doses, and ensure it is followed by irrigation.

**Important Considerations for All Macronutrients:**

*   **Soil Testing is Paramount:** These are general guidelines. A soil test report will provide precise nutrient levels and specific recommendations for your farm.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management (INM):** Supplement chemical fertilizers with organic manures like Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost. This improves soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability over the long term.
*   **Timing:** Apply fertilizers when trees are actively growing and can efficiently utilize the nutrients.
*   **Irrigation:** Always irrigate after applying fertilizers to help dissolve the nutrients and move them into the root zone, preventing root burn and ensuring uptake.
*   **Foliar Application:** While soil application is primary for macronutrients, in severe cases or for quick temporary relief, a foliar spray of a balanced NPK fertilizer solution (e.g., 1-2% solution of a water-soluble NPK grade) can be considered, but it's not a long-term solution for severe deficiencies.
