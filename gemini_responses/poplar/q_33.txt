As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I emphasize that effective weed management is crucial for the successful establishment and growth of Poplar plantations, especially during the initial 2-3 years. Weeds compete intensely for water, nutrients, and sunlight, significantly hindering the growth and yield of Poplar.

Here's a scientifically verified approach for controlling the specified weeds in Poplar:

**I. General Weed Management Principles in Poplar:**

1.  **Integrated Weed Management (IWM):** Combine cultural, mechanical, and chemical methods for sustainable and effective control.
2.  **Critical Period of Weed Competition:** The first 6-12 months after planting Poplar saplings are most critical.
3.  **Safety First:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) and follow label instructions for all chemical applications.

**II. Specific Weed Control Strategies:**

**A. Broad Leaf Weeds (General, including Bathu and Congress Grass) & Narrow Leaf Weeds (General):**

These categories include weeds like Bathu (Chenopodium album) and Congress grass (Parthenium hysterophorus), as well as various annual grasses.

*   **Pre-emergence Herbicides (Applied before weed emergence, usually within 3-5 days of planting Poplar saplings or before monsoon rains):**
    *   **Pendimethalin** 30% EC: Apply at 3.3 - 5.0 L/acre in 200-300 L of water. This provides control of many annual broadleaf weeds and grasses.
    *   **Oxyfluorfen** 23.5% EC: Apply at 0.85 - 1.25 L/acre in 200-300 L of water. Effective against a wide range of broadleaf weeds and some grasses.

*   **Post-emergence Herbicides (Applied after weeds have emerged):**
    *   **Non-selective (for general weed control, use as directed/shielded spray only):**
        *   **Glyphosate** 41% SL: Apply at 2.5 - 3.7 L/acre in 200-300 L of water. This is a systemic herbicide.
        *   **Paraquat dichloride** 24% SL: Apply at 2.0 - 4.0 L/acre in 200-300 L of water. This is a contact herbicide with rapid action.
        *   **Crucial Precaution:** When using **Glyphosate** or **Paraquat dichloride**, *extreme care must be taken to prevent any spray drift or contact with Poplar foliage, green bark, or young stems*. Use a spray shield or directed nozzle to target only the weeds. Contact with Poplar can cause severe injury or death.
    *   **Selective for Grasses (for narrow leaf weeds like Phalaris minor, safe for Poplar):**
        *   **Quizalofop-ethyl** 5% EC: Apply at 1.0 - 2.0 L/acre in 200-300 L of water. This herbicide specifically targets grasses and is generally safe for broadleaf plants like Poplar. This is an excellent option if grasses are the predominant weed problem.

**B. Amarbail (Cuscuta spp.):**

Amarbail is a parasitic weed that can severely damage Poplar if left unchecked.

*   **Manual Removal:** This is the most effective method. Regularly inspect Poplar saplings and surrounding areas. Remove any Amarbail strands manually before they attach to the Poplar or other desirable plants. If a Poplar branch is heavily infested, prune the affected part immediately.
*   **Pre-emergence Suppression:** **Pendimethalin** (as mentioned above) can offer some suppression of Amarbail seed germination.
*   **Post-emergence (Directed Spray):** If Amarbail is growing on other weeds *before* attaching to Poplar, a directed spray of **Paraquat dichloride** or **Glyphosate** can be used to kill the infested weeds. Again, *ensure no contact with Poplar*.

**C. Bathu (Chenopodium album):**

This is a common broadleaf weed. Control measures are covered under the "Broad Leaf Weeds" section above.

**D. Congress Grass (Parthenium hysterophorus):**

An invasive broadleaf weed. Control measures are covered under the "Broad Leaf Weeds" section above. Manual removal of young plants is also effective.

**E. Orobanche (Orobanche spp.):**

**This is not known to affect Poplar.** *Orobanche* species are root parasitic weeds that primarily infest herbaceous dicotyledonous crops such as mustard, tobacco, tomato, and sunflower. Poplar is a woody tree and is not a host for *Orobanche*. Therefore, specific control measures for *Orobanche* are not required for Poplar itself.

**F. Phalaris minor:**

This is a common narrow-leaf weed (grass). Control measures are covered under the "Narrow Leaf Weeds" section above, with **Quizalofop-ethyl** being a particularly suitable selective option.

**III. Important Considerations and Precautions:**

*   **Timing of Application:** For pre-emergence herbicides, apply within 3-5 days of planting or before weed emergence. For post-emergence herbicides, apply when weeds are young and actively growing for best results.
*   **Water Volume:** Always use sufficient water volume (200-300 L/acre) to ensure thorough coverage of the target weeds.
*   **Shielded/Directed Spray:** For non-selective post-emergence herbicides (**Glyphosate**, **Paraquat dichloride**), always use a spray shield or directed nozzle to prevent contact with Poplar plants. Young Poplar bark is sensitive to these chemicals.
*   **Soil Moisture:** For optimal efficacy of pre-emergence herbicides, adequate soil moisture is required at the time of application or soon after.
*   **Rotation:** While Poplar is a perennial crop, managing weeds in the inter-row spaces can benefit from crop rotation if intercropping is practiced.
*   **Manual Weeding:** Especially in the first year, manual weeding around the base of Poplar saplings can supplement chemical control and ensure weed-free conditions.

By implementing these scientifically sound practices, you can effectively manage weeds in your Poplar plantations and ensure healthy tree growth.
