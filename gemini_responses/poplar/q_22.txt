As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the recommended cultivation practices for Poplar in Haryana.

It is important to note that Poplar (Populus deltoides clones) for commercial cultivation in Haryana is primarily propagated vegetatively using stem cuttings or rooted saplings/clones, not by seeds. Therefore, the concept of "seed dose" is not applicable.

Here are the recommended cultivation practices:

*   **Propagation Method:**
    *   Poplar is propagated through **dormant stem cuttings** (setts) or **rooted saplings/clones** obtained from certified nurseries.
    *   Cuttings are typically 20-25 cm long and 1-2 cm thick, taken from one-year-old healthy branches.

*   **Planting Method/Pattern:**
    *   **Pit Planting:** Pits of 60 cm x 60 cm x 60 cm are generally dug. These pits are then refilled with a mixture of topsoil and well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) at a ratio of approximately 3:1 or 4:1.
    *   **Timing:** Planting is ideally done during the dormant season, typically from **mid-January to February**, when the trees are leafless.
    *   **Direct Planting of Cuttings:** Cuttings can be directly planted in the prepared pits.
    *   **Planting of Rooted Saplings/Clones:** Rooted saplings (often 1-year-old) are planted in the prepared pits.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   **For Cuttings:** Approximately **2/3rd to 3/4th** of the cutting should be buried in the soil, leaving 2-3 buds above the ground level. This usually means burying about 15-20 cm of the cutting.
    *   **For Rooted Saplings/Clones:** Plant the sapling at the same depth as it was in the nursery bag or bed, ensuring the root collar is at ground level.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   Spacing is crucial and depends on the specific objective (e.g., pure plantation, agroforestry with intercropping) and the duration of intercropping. In Haryana, Poplar is predominantly grown under agroforestry systems.
    *   **Common Spacings for Agroforestry (allowing intercropping):**
        *   **5 m x 4 m:** This spacing accommodates approximately 500 trees per acre (1250 trees/hectare) and allows for intercropping for 3-4 years.
        *   **6 m x 3 m:** This spacing accommodates approximately 555 trees per acre (1388 trees/hectare) and is also suitable for intercropping.
        *   **10 m x 2 m:** This pattern provides wider inter-row spacing for machinery and longer intercropping duration, accommodating approximately 500 trees per acre (1250 trees/hectare).
        *   **10 m x 4 m:** For very wide inter-row spacing and extended intercropping, accommodating approximately 250 trees per acre (625 trees/hectare).
    *   **Pure Plantation (less common in Haryana):** Denser spacings like 4 m x 4 m or 3 m x 3 m might be used, but these limit intercropping opportunities.

Choosing the appropriate spacing is vital for maximizing yield, facilitating intercropping, and ensuring proper tree growth and light penetration.
