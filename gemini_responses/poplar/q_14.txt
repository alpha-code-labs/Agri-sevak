Namaste, Kisan bhaiyon! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the challenges posed by soil pests in Poplar plantations. Termites and nematodes, particularly root-knot nematodes, can significantly impact the health and productivity of your Poplar trees. Here's scientifically verified advice for their control in Haryana:

**General Principles for Soil Pest Management in Poplar:**
*   **Integrated Pest Management (IPM):** Combine cultural, biological, and chemical methods for sustainable control.
*   **Soil Health:** Maintain good soil organic matter and drainage to promote beneficial soil organisms and reduce pest stress.
*   **Nursery Management:** Start with healthy, pest-free planting material. Treat nursery beds if soil pests are a known issue.
*   **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect young plants for signs of damage.

**1. Control of Termites (Isoptera) in Poplar:**
Termites are a major threat, especially to young Poplar saplings, damaging roots and the base of the stem, leading to wilting and plant death.

*   **Pre-planting Treatment:**
    *   Before planting, treat the planting pits or trenches with an insecticide solution.
    *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: Mix 2.5 ml per litre of water and drench the planting pit thoroughly.
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: Mix 0.5-1 ml per litre of water and drench the planting pit thoroughly.

*   **Post-planting Treatment (for existing infestation or preventive):**
    *   Drench the soil around the base of affected or susceptible plants.
    *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: Mix 2.5 ml per litre of water and apply 1-2 litres of solution per plant, depending on its size.
    *   **Fipronil** 5% SC: Mix 1.5-2 ml per litre of water and apply 1-2 litres of solution per plant.
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: Mix 0.5-1 ml per litre of water and apply 1-2 litres of solution per plant.

**2. Control of Nematodes (Root-knot Nematodes - *Meloidogyne* spp.) in Poplar:**
Root-knot nematodes cause galls (swellings) on roots, leading to stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, reduced water and nutrient uptake, and increased susceptibility to other stresses. Chemical control in established Poplar can be challenging, but certain CIBRC-approved nematicides or insecticides with nematicidal properties can be used.

*   **Pre-planting Treatment:**
    *   If nematodes are a known problem in the field, consider soil solarization or deep ploughing during hot months to reduce nematode populations.
    *   For chemical treatment of nursery beds or planting pits:
        *   **Fluopyram** 200 SC: Mix 0.5-1 ml per litre of water and drench the soil in the planting pit.
        *   **Fluensulfone** 200 EW: Mix 1-1.5 ml per litre of water and drench the soil in the planting pit.

*   **Post-planting Treatment (for existing plants):**
    *   Drench the soil around the base of affected plants.
    *   **Fluopyram** 200 SC: Mix 0.5-1 ml per litre of water and apply 1-2 litres of solution per plant.
    *   **Fluensulfone** 200 EW: Mix 1-1.5 ml per litre of water and apply 1-2 litres of solution per plant.
    *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: While primarily an insecticide, it offers some suppression of nematodes. Mix 2.5 ml per litre of water and drench the soil around the plant. This can be a dual-purpose treatment if both termites and nematodes are suspected.

**Important Considerations and Precautions:**
*   **Read the Label:** Always read and strictly follow the instructions, dosage, and safety precautions mentioned on the pesticide label.
*   **Safety Gear:** Use appropriate personal protective equipment (gloves, mask, eye protection) while handling and applying chemicals.
*   **Timing:** Apply chemicals when soil moisture is adequate for better absorption and efficacy. Avoid application during strong winds or heavy rain.
*   **Rotation:** Rotate chemicals with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in pests.
*   **Environmental Impact:** Be mindful of the environmental impact. Avoid contamination of water sources.
*   **Consult Experts:** For severe or persistent problems, consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for specific diagnosis and recommendations.
