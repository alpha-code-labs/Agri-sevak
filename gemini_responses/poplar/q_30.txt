As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I will provide scientifically verified advice for managing growth issues in Poplar (Populus spp.) in Haryana.

### 1. Slow Growth

Slow growth in Poplar can be attributed to various factors including nutrient deficiencies, water stress, soil compaction, weed competition, or pest/disease incidence. A thorough site assessment and soil testing are crucial for accurate diagnosis.

*   **Nutrient Management:** Based on soil test results, apply balanced fertilizers. For general slow growth, ensure adequate Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K).
    *   **Nitrogen:** Apply **Urea** (46% N) at 100-150 kg/acre, split into 2-3 applications during the growing season, especially for young plantations.
    *   **Phosphorus:** Apply **Single Super Phosphate** (SSP, 16% P2O5) at 150-200 kg/acre at planting or as a basal application.
    *   **Potassium:** Apply **Muriate of Potash** (MOP, 60% K2O) at 50-75 kg/acre at planting or as a basal application.
*   **Water Management:** Ensure consistent and adequate irrigation, especially during dry periods and critical growth stages. Avoid both water stress and waterlogging.
*   **Soil Health:** Improve soil structure and organic matter content through practices like adding farmyard manure (FYM) or compost.
*   **Weed Control:** Implement timely weed control measures (manual weeding, mechanical cultivation) to reduce competition for water and nutrients.
*   **Pest and Disease Management:** Identify and manage any specific pests or diseases affecting the trees.

### 2. Yellow Growth (Chlorosis)

Yellowing of leaves (chlorosis) often indicates a nutrient deficiency, particularly micronutrients, or issues with soil pH and drainage.

*   **Nutrient Deficiency Correction:**
    *   **Iron Deficiency:** Characterized by interveinal yellowing of young leaves while veins remain green.
        *   Apply **Ferrous sulfate** at 5-10 kg/acre as a soil application or 0.5-1.0% solution (5-10 g/L) as a foliar spray.
    *   **Zinc Deficiency:** Causes small, narrow, and yellow leaves, often with rosetting.
        *   Apply **Zinc sulfate** at 5-10 kg/acre as a soil application or 0.2-0.5% solution (2-5 g/L) as a foliar spray.
    *   **Manganese Deficiency:** Similar to iron deficiency but often appears on younger leaves first.
        *   Apply **Manganese sulfate** at 5-10 kg/acre as a soil application or 0.2-0.5% solution (2-5 g/L) as a foliar spray.
    *   **Nitrogen Deficiency:** General yellowing of older leaves, stunted growth.
        *   Apply **Urea** as described under "Slow Growth."
*   **Soil pH Management:** Poplars prefer slightly acidic to neutral soils (pH 6.0-7.5). High soil pH can reduce the availability of micronutrients. While difficult to significantly alter pH in established plantations, incorporating organic matter can help buffer soil pH.
*   **Drainage Improvement:** Ensure good soil drainage to prevent waterlogging, which can impair root function and nutrient uptake.

### 3. Excessive Height

Excessive height, especially at the expense of stem girth, can lead to instability and reduced timber quality.

*   **Pruning:** Regular and timely pruning is the primary method to manage height and encourage better stem form and girth development. Remove lower branches progressively.
*   **Spacing:** Ensure optimal planting density. Overly dense plantations can lead to competition for light, resulting in etiolated (tall and thin) growth.
*   **Nutrient Balance:** Avoid excessive nitrogen application, which can promote rapid vertical growth. Maintain a balanced NPK ratio.
*   **Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs):** While PGRs like **Paclobutrazol** are known to reduce internode elongation in some crops, their use for height control in commercial Poplar forestry is generally not a standard or economically viable practice in Haryana due to the scale of operations and potential long-term effects on wood quality. Cultural practices like pruning and proper spacing are preferred.

### 4. Excessive Flowering

Excessive flowering in Poplar is generally not considered a "growth issue" requiring specific chemical intervention in commercial timber production. Poplars are primarily grown for their vegetative growth (wood), and energy diverted to flowering and seed production can reduce timber yield.

*   **Stress Management:** If excessive flowering is observed in young trees, it might be a response to stress (e.g., drought, nutrient deficiency, root damage). Addressing these underlying stresses (as described under "Slow Growth" and "Yellow Growth") is the appropriate management strategy.
*   **Clonal Selection:** For future plantations, selecting clones known for lower flowering intensity or later maturity can be considered, if this is a significant concern.
*   **Chemical Intervention:** There are no CIBRC-approved chemical recommendations for suppressing flowering in Poplar for timber production, as it is not a standard management practice. Using chemicals like **Ethephon**, which can induce defoliation or flower thinning in other crops, would likely be detrimental to the overall health and timber production of Poplar trees.
