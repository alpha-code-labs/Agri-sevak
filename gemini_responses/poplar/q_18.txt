As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the use of growth regulators and Boron in Poplar cultivation in Haryana:

*   **Ethephon** (technical name for Ethrel):
    *   **Use:** **Ethephon** is an ethylene-releasing compound used in Poplar for various purposes, including promoting rooting of cuttings and influencing stem growth.
    *   **Recommended Dose:**
        *   For promoting rooting in Poplar cuttings: Dip cuttings in a solution of **Ethephon** at 100-250 mg/L (0.1-0.25 g/L) for 12-24 hours before planting.
        *   For foliar application to influence growth: A foliar spray of **Ethephon** at 100-200 mg/L (0.1-0.2 g/L) can be applied, typically during active growth, depending on the specific objective. Always ensure thorough coverage.

*   **2,4-D**:
    *   **2,4-D** is primarily a selective herbicide and is **not recommended as a beneficial growth regulator for Poplar** in field conditions. Its application can cause severe phytotoxicity, damage, or even death to Poplar trees.

*   **Boron**:
    *   **Use:** Boron is an essential micronutrient crucial for Poplar growth, cell wall formation, sugar transport, and flowering. Deficiency can lead to stunted growth, dieback, and poor wood quality.
    *   **Recommended Dose:**
        *   **Foliar Application:** For correcting Boron deficiency or as a prophylactic measure, spray a solution of **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate) at 1-2 g/L of water (0.1-0.2% solution). Ensure complete coverage of the foliage. Apply during active growth, typically 1-2 times per growing season based on deficiency symptoms or soil test recommendations.
        *   **Soil Application:** In cases of confirmed Boron deficiency through soil testing, **Borax** can be applied to the soil at a rate of 1-2 kg per acre, broadcast evenly around the base of the trees, preferably before the monsoon or during irrigation. Soil application rates should always be guided by soil test reports to avoid toxicity.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always conduct a small-scale trial before widespread application to observe plant response.
*   Ensure proper safety measures, including wearing protective gear, during handling and application of all chemicals.
*   Follow the specific instructions and precautions mentioned on the product label.
*   Soil and leaf analysis are recommended to accurately diagnose nutrient deficiencies before applying Boron.
