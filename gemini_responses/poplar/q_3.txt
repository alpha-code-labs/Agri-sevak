As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for managing various rot types in Poplar (Populus spp.), specifically for conditions prevalent in Haryana.

It is important to note that many rot diseases are caused by soil-borne fungi or oomycetes, often exacerbated by poor drainage, mechanical injury, or environmental stress. Integrated disease management is crucial for effective control.

**General Management Principles for Rot Diseases in Poplar:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Site Selection:** Choose well-drained soils for nurseries and plantations. Avoid waterlogged areas, as excessive moisture promotes rot development.
    *   **Soil Preparation:** Improve soil structure and drainage through proper tillage and incorporation of organic matter.
    *   **Healthy Planting Material:** Use disease-free cuttings or seedlings from reputable sources. Inspect material thoroughly before planting.
    *   **Proper Planting Depth:** Ensure cuttings/seedlings are planted at the correct depth to avoid stress on the collar region.
    *   **Water Management:** Avoid over-irrigation, especially in nurseries and young plantations. Ensure proper drainage around the base of trees.
    *   **Weed Control:** Manage weeds to reduce competition and improve air circulation around the base of young plants, which can reduce humidity and pathogen spread.
    *   **Avoid Mechanical Injury:** Prevent damage to roots, stems, and collars during cultivation, harvesting, or other operations, as wounds serve as easy entry points for pathogens.
    *   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris, especially in nurseries, to reduce the inoculum source.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure balanced fertilization to promote vigorous growth and enhance the plant's natural resistance to diseases.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Application of beneficial microbial antagonists can help suppress soil-borne pathogens.
        *   **Trichoderma viride:** Apply as a soil drench or mix with organic manure at 2.5 kg/acre.
        *   **Pseudomonas fluorescens:** Apply as a soil drench at 2.5 kg/acre.

**Specific Rot Types and Control Measures:**

**1. Root Rot, Stem Rot, Foot Rot, Collar Rot, Crown Rot, and Neck Rot:**
These rot types often share common soil-borne fungal or oomycete pathogens (e.g., *Phytophthora*, *Fusarium*, *Rhizoctonia*, *Pythium*, *Ganoderma*, *Armillaria*) and are frequently associated with poor drainage and stress.

*   **Preventive Measures (Nursery & Young Plants):**
    *   **Soil Solarization:** In nurseries, solarize soil during hot months to reduce pathogen load.
    *   **Dipping of Cuttings/Seedlings:** Before planting, dip the basal portion of cuttings or roots of seedlings in a fungicide solution.
        *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: 1 g/L of water.
        *   **Metalaxyl** 8% + **Mancozeb** 64% WP: 2 g/L of water (especially effective against *Phytophthora* and *Pythium* species).
    *   **Soil Drench (Nursery & Young Plants):**
        *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: 1-2 g/L of water, drench around the base of affected or susceptible plants.
        *   **Metalaxyl** 8% + **Mancozeb** 64% WP: 2 g/L of water, drench around the base of plants, particularly if *Phytophthora* or *Pythium* is suspected.
        *   **Copper Oxychloride** 50% WP: 2-3 g/L of water, drench around the base of plants.

*   **Curative Measures (Established Trees):**
    *   For established trees showing symptoms of root or collar rot, improve drainage, remove affected bark/wood if possible (pruning tools must be sterilized), and apply a fungicidal drench around the root zone.
    *   **Propiconazole** 25% EC: 1-2 ml/L of water, drench around the base.
    *   **Hexaconazole** 5% SC: 2 ml/L of water, drench around the base.
    *   For *Ganoderma* or *Armillaria* root rots, which are difficult to control once established, focus on sanitation (removing infected stumps/roots) and improving tree vigor. Fungicidal drenches may offer limited success in advanced stages.

**2. Seed Rot:**
This occurs when Poplar seeds fail to germinate due to fungal infection, often in moist, cool soil conditions.

*   **Seed Treatment:**
    *   **Thiram** 75% WS: 2-3 g/kg of seed.
    *   **Captan** 50% WP: 2-3 g/kg of seed.
    *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: 1-2 g/kg of seed.

**3. Seedling Rot (Damping-off):**
Affects young Poplar seedlings in nurseries, causing them to collapse at the soil line (pre- or post-emergence damping-off).

*   **Preventive Measures:**
    *   Use treated seeds (as described for Seed Rot).
    *   Ensure proper spacing and ventilation in nurseries to reduce humidity.
    *   Avoid overwatering; maintain appropriate soil moisture.
    *   **Soil Drench:**
        *   **Metalaxyl** 8% + **Mancozeb** 64% WP: 2 g/L of water, drench the nursery beds immediately after sowing or at the first sign of disease.
        *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: 1 g/L of water, drench the nursery beds.

**Rot Types Not Known to Affect Poplar:**

*   **Black Rot:** This is not known to affect Poplar as a distinct disease entity. While some rot diseases might cause black discoloration, "Black Rot" is not a recognized primary disease of Poplar.
*   **Fruit Rot:** This is not known to affect Poplar, as Poplar does not produce fleshy fruits susceptible to this type of rot.
