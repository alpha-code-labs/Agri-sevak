Regarding your query on controlling physical damage in Poplar:

*   **Fruit bursting and Hardness in fruit:** This is not known to affect Poplar, as Poplar trees do not produce fleshy fruits susceptible to these conditions.

*   **Leaf burning/melting (Leaf Scorch/Necrosis):** This can occur in Poplar due to various abiotic stresses. Control measures primarily involve good cultural practices and environmental management:

    *   **Water Management:**
        *   **Adequate Irrigation:** Ensure consistent and sufficient water supply, especially during dry periods and for young, establishing trees. Deep watering is more effective than shallow, frequent watering.
        *   **Drainage Improvement:** In areas with poor drainage, improve soil structure or consider planting on raised beds to prevent waterlogging, which can lead to root damage and subsequent leaf scorch.
        *   **Mulching:** Apply a 5-10 cm layer of organic mulch (e.g., wood chips, straw) around the base of the tree, keeping it a few centimeters away from the trunk. This helps conserve soil moisture, moderate soil temperature, and reduce weed competition.

    *   **Heat and Sun Stress:**
        *   **Site Selection:** Plant Poplar in suitable locations that consider local climate conditions and provide adequate sunlight without excessive exposure to intense, reflected heat.
        *   **Temporary Shading:** For newly planted saplings, especially in areas with intense summer sun, providing temporary shade can help reduce stress during establishment.
        *   **Maintain Tree Vigor:** Healthy, well-nourished trees are more resilient to environmental stresses.

    *   **Chemical Injury:**
        *   **Careful Application of Agrochemicals:** Strictly follow label instructions for all herbicides, pesticides, and fertilizers.
        *   **Prevent Herbicide Drift:** Use appropriate spray techniques and avoid spraying during windy conditions to prevent drift onto Poplar foliage.
        *   **Correct Fertilizer Use:** Apply fertilizers at recommended rates and methods, avoiding direct contact with foliage unless it is a foliar feed designed for that purpose. Over-application of certain nutrients can also cause leaf burn.

    *   **Nutrient Imbalances:**
        *   **Soil Testing:** Conduct regular soil tests to identify any nutrient deficiencies or toxicities.
        *   **Balanced Fertilization:** Apply fertilizers based on soil test results. For instance, deficiencies in certain micronutrients can make leaves more susceptible to scorch, while excesses (e.g., boron toxicity) can directly cause burning. If a deficiency is identified, applying the specific nutrient as per CIBRC guidelines and soil test recommendations can improve overall tree health and resilience. Examples include:
            *   **Zinc sulphate** (for zinc deficiency)
            *   **Ferrous sulphate** (for iron deficiency)

    It is important to note that for existing physical damage like leaf burning, there are no direct chemical "cures." The focus is on preventing further damage by identifying and addressing the root cause through improved cultural practices and environmental management.
