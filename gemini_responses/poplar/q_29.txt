This is not known to affect Poplar.

Poplar (Populus spp.) is primarily cultivated for its timber, not for its flowers or fruits. The terms "flower drop," "fruit drop," "tinda dropping," and "boll dropping" refer to issues in horticultural or field crops (like vegetables, fruit trees, or cotton) where the retention of these reproductive structures is crucial for yield. These conditions are not relevant problems in Poplar cultivation.
