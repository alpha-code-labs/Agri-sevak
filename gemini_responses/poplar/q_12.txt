Both Scale insects and Mealybugs are significant sucking pests that can affect Poplar (Populus spp.) plantations in Haryana, leading to reduced vigour, yellowing of leaves, stunted growth, and sometimes sooty mold development due to honeydew excretion. Effective management requires an integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods.

**General Management Principles:**

*   **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect trees, especially the undersides of leaves and stems, for early detection of pest infestations.
*   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy heavily infested branches or twigs to reduce pest populations and prevent their spread.
*   **Strong Water Spray:** For mealybugs, a strong jet of water can physically dislodge them from the plant surface, especially on smaller trees.
*   **Biological Control:** Encourage natural enemies like ladybird beetles, lacewings, and parasitic wasps, which are predators or parasitoids of these pests. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm beneficial insects.

**Chemical Control (Using CIBRC approved technical chemical names):**

**For Scale Insects:**
Chemical control is most effective against the crawler stage (young, mobile nymphs) or when the scales are still young and have not developed a thick waxy covering.

*   **Horticultural Mineral Oil (HMO):** Apply a spray of **Horticultural Mineral Oil** at a concentration of **15-20 ml/L** of water during the dormant season or when temperatures are moderate (below 30°C) to smother eggs and young scales. Ensure thorough coverage.
*   **Buprofezin:** For actively feeding nymphs, spray with **Buprofezin 25% SC** at a rate of **1.0-1.25 ml/L** of water. This is an insect growth regulator that disrupts molting.
*   **Systemic Insecticides:** For persistent infestations, especially against crawlers and young scales, consider systemic options:
    *   Spray with **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL** at **0.5-1.0 ml/L** of water.
    *   Alternatively, use **Thiamethoxam 25% WG** at **0.2-0.4 g/L** of water.
    *   **Spirotetramat 150 OD** at **0.75-1.0 ml/L** of water is also effective due to its dual-systemic action.

**For Mealybugs:**
Mealybugs are often easier to control than mature scales due to their less robust waxy coating.

*   **Horticultural Mineral Oil (HMO):** Similar to scales, **Horticultural Mineral Oil** at **15-20 ml/L** of water can be effective by smothering them.
*   **Systemic Insecticides:** These are highly effective as mealybugs are sucking pests.
    *   Spray with **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL** at **0.5-1.0 ml/L** of water.
    *   Alternatively, use **Acetamiprid 20% SP** at **0.2-0.4 g/L** of water.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG** at **0.2-0.4 g/L** of water is also a good option.
*   **Buprofezin:** For nymphal stages, **Buprofezin 25% SC** at **1.0-1.25 ml/L** of water can be used.
*   **Contact Insecticides (for quick knockdown):**
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC** at **0.5-1.0 ml/L** of water can provide quick knockdown, especially when mealybug populations are high. Ensure thorough coverage.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Timing of Application:** For both pests, targeting the crawler/nymphal stages is crucial for effective chemical control. Multiple applications might be necessary, especially for scale insects, following label instructions.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough coverage of all infested plant parts, including the undersides of leaves and crevices on stems.
*   **Rotation of Chemicals:** To prevent the development of resistance, rotate insecticides with different modes of action.
*   **Safety:** Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the pesticide label, including recommended dosage, application methods, pre-harvest intervals, and safety precautions (wearing personal protective equipment - PPE).
*   **Environmental Impact:** Use pesticides judiciously to minimize impact on beneficial insects and the environment.
