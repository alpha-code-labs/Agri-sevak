As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified recommendations for Poplar cultivation in Haryana:

### Seed Treatment Process for Poplar

Poplar (Populus spp.) is primarily propagated vegetatively through cuttings for commercial plantations in Haryana, rather than by seeds. Seed propagation is generally limited to breeding programs or specific research purposes due to the minute size of the seeds, their short viability, and the genetic variability of seedlings.

Therefore, standard "seed treatment" protocols, as applied to crops propagated by true seeds, are **not applicable** for commercial Poplar cultivation.

### Soil Treatment Process for Poplar

Soil treatment for Poplar primarily focuses on managing soil-borne pests and diseases, particularly at the time of planting cuttings or saplings, and in nursery beds. The following treatments are recommended:

1.  **Termite Management (Pre-planting / At Planting):**
    Termites are a significant threat to newly planted Poplar cuttings and young saplings. Pre-plant soil treatment is crucial.
    *   **Option 1 (Chemical):**
        *   **Chlorpyrifos** (20% EC): Mix 2.5 ml per liter of water and drench 1-2 liters of this solution into each planting pit before or immediately after planting the cutting/sapling.
    *   **Option 2 (Chemical):**
        *   **Fipronil** (0.3% GR): Apply 10-15 kg per acre by mixing it thoroughly with the soil in the planting pits or broadcast in the nursery area before planting.

2.  **Nematode Management (If history of nematode problems or in nurseries):**
    Nematodes can cause significant damage to Poplar roots, leading to stunted growth and reduced vigor.
    *   **Option 1 (Chemical):**
        *   **Fluensulfone** (2% GR): Apply 20-30 kg per acre by mixing with the soil in the planting pits or broadcast in the nursery area before planting.
    *   **Option 2 (Biological):**
        *   **Purpureocillium lilacinum** (1% WP): Mix 2.5-5.0 kg with 100 kg of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost and apply per acre, incorporating it into the soil before planting or around existing plants.
    *   **Option 3 (Botanical):**
        *   **Azadirachtin** (1500 ppm EC): Mix 2.5-5.0 ml per liter of water and drench around the base of the saplings/cuttings, especially in nursery beds, to suppress nematode populations.

3.  **Soil-borne Fungal Disease Control (e.g., Damping-off in nurseries, Root Rot):**
    While less common as a general field treatment, specific soil-borne fungal issues, particularly in nurseries, may require intervention.
    *   **Option 1 (Biological - Prophylactic):**
        *   **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum** (1% WP): Mix 2.5-5.0 kg with 100 kg of well-decomposed FYM or compost and apply per acre, incorporating it into the soil before planting or around existing plants. This acts as a biocontrol agent against various soil-borne pathogens.
    *   **Option 2 (Chemical - Curative/Specific):**
        *   **Carbendazim** (50% WP): In cases of identified soil-borne fungal diseases like root rot, mix 1.0-2.0 g per liter of water and drench around the base of affected plants. This should be used judiciously and only when necessary.
