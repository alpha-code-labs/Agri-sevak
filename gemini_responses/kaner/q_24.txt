As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend the following for Kaner (Nerium oleander) transplantation in Haryana:

### Ideal Transplantation Time

The most suitable times for transplanting Kaner in Haryana are:
*   **Monsoon Season:** July to August, as the natural rainfall helps in establishment and reduces transplant shock.
*   **Late Winter/Early Spring:** February to March, allowing the plant to establish before the intense summer heat.

### Transplantation Distance

The ideal spacing depends on the intended use:
*   **For Hedges or Mass Planting:** Plant at a distance of 1.5 to 2 meters between plants.
*   **For Specimen Plants or Standalone Shrubs:** Allow a distance of 2.5 to 3 meters to accommodate its mature size and spread.

### Transplantation Process

1.  **Site Preparation:**
    *   Choose a location with full sun exposure (6+ hours daily).
    *   Dig a planting hole that is twice as wide as the root ball and slightly less deep.
    *   Amend the excavated soil with well-rotted farmyard manure or compost (approximately 1-2 kg per pit) to improve soil structure and fertility.

2.  **Plant Preparation:**
    *   Water the Kaner plant thoroughly a day before transplantation to ensure the root ball is moist.
    *   If the plant is in a pot, gently remove it, trying to keep the root ball intact.
    *   If transplanting from the ground, dig a wide circle around the plant (at least 30-45 cm radius for a medium-sized plant) to extract a substantial root ball. Minimize root disturbance.

3.  **Planting:**
    *   Place the Kaner plant in the center of the prepared hole. Ensure the top of the root ball is level with or slightly above the surrounding ground to prevent waterlogging around the stem.
    *   Backfill the hole with the amended soil, gently firming it around the root ball to remove air pockets.
    *   Create a small soil berm or basin around the plant to help retain water.

4.  **Post-Transplantation Care:**
    *   **Watering:** Immediately after planting, water thoroughly until the soil is saturated. Continue to water regularly, especially during dry periods, until the plant is well-established (typically 2-3 months).
    *   **Pruning:** Prune back about one-third of the foliage, especially any damaged or weak branches, to reduce water loss through transpiration and encourage new growth.
    *   **Support:** For larger plants, provide temporary staking if needed to prevent movement in strong winds until the roots are established.
    *   **Rooting Hormone (Optional):** For stressed plants or those with significant root disturbance, a drench of a solution containing **Indole-3-butyric acid (IBA)** at a concentration of 100-200 mg/L can aid in root development.
    *   **Monitoring:** Observe the plant for signs of stress (wilting, yellowing leaves) and adjust watering accordingly. Avoid heavy fertilization immediately after transplanting; wait until new growth appears.
