As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for managing growth issues in Kaner (Nerium oleander) in Haryana.

Kaner is a hardy ornamental shrub well-suited to the climate of Haryana, but like any plant, it can exhibit various growth issues.

### 1. Slow Growth

**Causes:**
*   **Nutrient Deficiency:** Lack of essential macro (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium) or micronutrients.
*   **Water Stress:** Both insufficient watering and waterlogging can hinder growth.
*   **Poor Soil Conditions:** Compacted soil, poor drainage, or very low organic matter.
*   **Insufficient Sunlight:** Kaner thrives in full sun; low light conditions will lead to leggy, slow growth.
*   **Root Issues:** Root bound in pots, root damage, or disease.
*   **Incorrect pH:** Soil pH outside the optimal range (6.0-7.5) can limit nutrient availability.

**Management:**
*   **Soil Testing:** Conduct a soil test to determine nutrient levels and pH. This is the most crucial first step.
*   **Balanced Fertilization:** Based on soil test results, apply a balanced fertilizer.
    *   For general slow growth, apply a granular NPK fertilizer around the base of the plant, followed by watering.
        *   **Urea**: 15-20 g per medium-sized plant (for Nitrogen).
        *   **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)**: 20-25 g per medium-sized plant (for Nitrogen and Phosphorus).
        *   **Muriate of Potash (MOP)**: 15-20 g per medium-sized plant (for Potassium).
    *   Alternatively, use a complete NPK fertilizer like 19:19:19 or 20:20:20 at 20-30 g per plant every 2-3 months during the growing season.
*   **Proper Watering:** Water deeply and regularly, especially during dry periods, but ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging.
*   **Sunlight:** Ensure the plant receives at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily.
*   **Pruning:** Remove any dead, diseased, or weak branches to redirect energy to healthy growth.
*   **Repotting:** If in a container, check if it's root-bound and repot into a larger container with fresh potting mix.

### 2. Yellow Growth (Chlorosis)

**Causes:**
*   **Iron Deficiency:** Very common in alkaline soils (high pH), which are prevalent in parts of Haryana. High pH makes iron unavailable to the plant.
*   **Nitrogen Deficiency:** Overall yellowing, especially of older leaves.
*   **Magnesium Deficiency:** Yellowing between veins, often starting on older leaves.
*   **Waterlogging:** Can damage roots and impair nutrient uptake, leading to yellowing.
*   **Root Damage/Disease:** Compromised root system affects nutrient absorption.

**Management:**
*   **Soil Testing:** Essential to determine pH and specific nutrient deficiencies.
*   **pH Correction:** If soil pH is too high, incorporate organic matter (compost, well-rotted manure) to gradually lower it.
*   **Micronutrient Application:**
    *   For Iron Chlorosis:
        *   **Ferrous sulphate**: Apply 5 g/L water as a foliar spray (repeat every 15 days until recovery) or 20-30 g per plant as a soil drench around the root zone.
        *   **Iron EDTA** (Chelated Iron): Apply 1-2 g/L water as a foliar spray for quicker absorption, especially in highly alkaline soils.
    *   For general micronutrient deficiency: A foliar spray of a complete micronutrient mixture containing **Zinc sulphate** (2-3 g/L water) and **Borax** (1 g/L water) can be beneficial.
*   **Nitrogen Application:** If nitrogen deficiency is confirmed, apply **Urea** at 5 g/L water as a foliar spray or 15-20 g per plant as a soil application.
*   **Drainage Improvement:** Ensure the soil has good drainage to prevent waterlogging.

### 3. Excessive Height

**Causes:**
*   **Natural Growth Habit:** Kaner can grow quite tall if left unpruned.
*   **Lack of Pruning:** Insufficient or incorrect pruning encourages vertical growth.
*   **High Nitrogen Fertilization:** Excessive nitrogen promotes vegetative growth (leaves and stems) over flowering and can lead to leggy growth.
*   **Seeking Light (Etiolation):** While Kaner needs full sun, if it's partially shaded, it might stretch to reach light.

**Management:**
*   **Regular Pruning:** This is the primary and most effective method.
    *   **Formative Pruning:** Shape the plant when young to encourage bushiness.
    *   **Maintenance Pruning:** Annually, after the main flowering season (or in late winter/early spring before new growth starts), prune back branches to the desired height and shape. Remove about one-third of the plant's height or more if significant reduction is needed. Cut above a node or outward-facing bud.
*   **Balanced Fertilization:** Avoid over-fertilizing with high-nitrogen fertilizers. Use a balanced NPK fertilizer.
*   **Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs):** For specific situations like container plants or very restricted spaces where pruning alone is insufficient, PGRs can be used with caution.
    *   **Paclobutrazol**: Apply at 0.5-1 ml/L water as a soil drench or foliar spray. The exact dosage depends on plant size, desired reduction, and specific product concentration. *Use with extreme caution and follow product label instructions precisely, as overdose can severely stunt growth.* This is generally not recommended for routine home garden use but can be employed in commercial nurseries or specific landscape designs.

### 4. Excessive Flowering

**Causes:**
*   **Healthy, Mature Plant:** Kaner is naturally a prolific bloomer, and abundant flowering is often a sign of a healthy, well-established plant receiving optimal conditions.
*   **Stress (less common for "excessive" but possible):** Sometimes, plants under severe stress (e.g., root damage, nutrient deficiency) may produce a flush of flowers as a survival mechanism to ensure reproduction before decline. However, this is usually accompanied by other signs of poor health.

**Management:**
*   **This is not known to be a problem that requires chemical management to reduce flowering in Kaner.** Excessive flowering is generally a desirable trait for an ornamental plant like Kaner.
*   If the term "excessive" implies that flowering is at the expense of overall plant vigor or vegetative growth, then the focus should be on ensuring balanced plant health:
    *   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure adequate Phosphorus (P) and Potassium (K) for flowering, but also sufficient Nitrogen (N) for healthy vegetative growth.
        *   **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)**: 20-25 g per medium-sized plant.
        *   **Muriate of Potash (MOP)**: 15-20 g per medium-sized plant.
    *   **Pruning:** Deadheading spent flowers can encourage more blooms and maintain a tidy appearance, but it won't significantly reduce the overall *amount* of flowering if the plant is healthy. Pruning for shape and size (as described under "Excessive Height") will naturally reduce the number of potential flower sites temporarily.
    *   **Investigate Underlying Stress:** If "excessive" flowering is accompanied by signs of decline (e.g., yellowing leaves, stunted new growth), investigate for root issues, severe nutrient deficiencies, or pest/disease problems.

Always remember to wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) when handling any chemicals and follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety guidelines. For specific recommendations tailored to your exact location and soil conditions, it is always best to consult with the experts at HAU or your local Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK).
