Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing pests in Kaner (Oleander) plants in Haryana.

Here's how to address the pests you've mentioned:

### Diamondback Moth (DBM)

This is not known to affect Kaner. Diamondback moth (*Plutella xylostella*) is a specific pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower, mustard) and does not infest Kaner.

### Borers

Borers (e.g., stem borers, shoot borers) can cause significant damage to Kaner by tunneling into stems and branches, leading to wilting, dieback, and weakening of the plant.

**Symptoms:**
*   Presence of boreholes on stems or branches.
*   Frass (sawdust-like excreta) protruding from holes.
*   Wilting or yellowing of affected branches.
*   Dieback of entire branches or the plant in severe cases.

**Control Measures:**

1.  **Cultural/Mechanical:**
    *   Regularly inspect plants for signs of borer activity.
    *   Prune and destroy affected branches well below the point of infestation to remove larvae.
    *   For visible boreholes, carefully insert a thin wire into the tunnel to kill the larva.
    *   Apply a paste of soil and cow dung or a systemic insecticide paste over the boreholes to suffocate or kill the larvae.

2.  **Chemical Control (for severe infestations):**
    *   **Targeted Application:** For individual boreholes, inject a solution of systemic insecticide directly into the hole using a syringe, then plug the hole with mud or cotton.
    *   **Foliar Spray/Drench:** For general protection or when borers are widespread, a systemic insecticide can be applied as a foliar spray or soil drench.
        *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** 0.3 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Fipronil 5% SC:** 1.5-2 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** 0.5 ml per litre of water (as a soil drench around the base of the plant for systemic action).

### Caterpillars and Leaf Folder

Various caterpillar species can feed on Kaner leaves, including the Oleander Hawk-moth larvae (*Daphnis nerii*) and other general defoliators. While a specific "leaf folder" pest is not commonly associated with Kaner, caterpillars can sometimes cause leaves to roll or fold as they feed or pupate.

**Symptoms:**
*   Chewed or ragged leaves.
*   Presence of caterpillars on leaves or stems.
*   Frass (excreta) on leaves or around the plant.
*   In some cases, leaves may be rolled or folded and tied with silk.

**Control Measures:**

1.  **Cultural/Mechanical:**
    *   Regularly inspect plants and hand-pick caterpillars, especially in smaller infestations.
    *   Destroy egg masses if found.
    *   Maintain good plant hygiene to reduce hiding places.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Encourage natural predators like birds, parasitic wasps, and predatory bugs.
    *   For organic control, consider spraying formulations of *Bacillus thuringiensis* (Bt), which is effective against young caterpillars. Follow product-specific dosage instructions.

3.  **Chemical Control (for severe infestations):**
    *   **Emamectin Benzoate 5% SG:** 0.5 g per litre of water.
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** 0.3 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Flubendiamide 20% WG:** 0.2 g per litre of water.
    *   **Indoxacarb 14.5% SC:** 0.5 ml per litre of water.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Safety First:** Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label, including dosage, application method, and safety precautions (wearing gloves, mask, etc.).
*   **Timing:** Apply insecticides during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough coverage of the plant, especially the undersides of leaves where pests often hide.
*   **Integrated Pest Management (IPM):** Combine cultural, mechanical, biological, and chemical methods for sustainable and effective pest control.
*   **Rotation of Chemicals:** To prevent the development of pesticide resistance, rotate the use of insecticides with different modes of action.
