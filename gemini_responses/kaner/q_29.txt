This is not known to affect Kaner in the manner described.

Kaner (Nerium oleander) is an ornamental plant that produces flowers and subsequently seed pods (follicles), not edible fruits like those implied by "Fruit drop". "Tinda" refers to a type of gourd, and "Boll" refers to the fruit capsule of cotton; these are specific agricultural produce not associated with Kaner.

While flower drop can occur in Kaner due to various physiological reasons such as environmental stress (e.g., water scarcity, extreme temperatures), nutrient imbalances, or natural senescence, the comprehensive condition of "Dropping (Flower drop, Fruit drop, and Tinda/Boll dropping)" as presented is not applicable to Kaner.
