As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following cultivation practices for Kaner (Nerium oleander) in Haryana:

Kaner is a hardy ornamental shrub well-suited to the agro-climatic conditions of Haryana. While it can be propagated by seeds, vegetative propagation through cuttings is generally preferred for faster establishment, uniformity, and to maintain desired varietal characteristics.

### **1. Propagation by Cuttings (Preferred Method)**

This method is highly recommended for establishing Kaner plants due to its efficiency and consistency.

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   Take semi-hardwood cuttings (15-20 cm long) from healthy, mature shoots. Remove leaves from the lower half.
    *   Cuttings can be rooted in a nursery bed, polybags, or directly planted in the field if conditions are favorable (e.g., during monsoon).
    *   For nursery rooting, use a well-draining medium like sand, vermiculite, or a mixture of sand and garden soil (1:1).
    *   Dipping the basal end of cuttings in a rooting hormone (e.g., Indole-3-butyric acid - IBA) can significantly improve rooting success.
*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   Insert the basal end of the cutting approximately **5-7 cm deep** into the rooting medium or prepared soil, ensuring at least two nodes are buried.
*   **Spacing (for established plants):**
    *   **For Hedges or Dense Plantings:** A spacing of **1.0 - 1.5 meters** between plants is recommended.
    *   **For Individual Specimen Plants:** Allow ample space, typically **2.0 - 3.0 meters** between plants, for optimal growth and development.
*   **Seed Dose:** Not applicable for propagation by cuttings.

### **2. Propagation by Seeds (Alternative Method)**

While possible, seed propagation is less common for commercial or ornamental planting due to slower growth and potential variability in offspring.

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   Seeds can be sown in nursery trays or raised beds.
    *   They can be sown in rows or broadcast thinly over the prepared seedbed.
*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   Sow seeds shallowly, approximately **0.5 - 1 cm deep**, and lightly cover with fine soil or sand.
*   **Spacing (for established plants):**
    *   The spacing for established plants grown from seeds will be similar to those grown from cuttings (refer to the "Spacing" section above).
*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   For Kaner, a specific 'seed dose' in kg/acre is not typically applied as it is an ornamental plant. Instead, sow seeds thinly to ensure adequate space for seedling development, aiming for approximately **10-15 seeds per 10 cm row** or spaced individually in seedling trays.

### **General Cultivation Notes:**

*   **Soil:** Kaner thrives in a wide range of soils but prefers well-drained, fertile loamy soils.
*   **Sunlight:** Requires full sun for best flowering.
*   **Watering:** Once established, Kaner is drought-tolerant but benefits from regular watering during dry periods, especially when young.
*   **Time of Propagation:** Spring (February-March) or monsoon (July-August) are ideal periods for propagation in Haryana.
