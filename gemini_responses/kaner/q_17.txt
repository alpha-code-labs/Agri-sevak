As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following doses for organic manures in Kaner (Nerium oleander) to promote healthy growth and flowering:

It is important to ensure that all organic manures, especially FYM and Vermicompost, are well-decomposed to avoid pest issues and nutrient lock-up. Apply these manures preferably in early spring and again before the monsoon season for best results.

*   **Farmyard Manure (FYM):**
    *   **For established plants in the ground:** Apply 5-10 kg per plant annually, split into two applications.
    *   **For potted plants:** Mix 25-30% well-decomposed FYM with the potting mix at the time of planting or repotting. For established potted plants, top-dress with 1-2 kg annually.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   **For established plants in the ground:** Apply 2-5 kg per plant annually, split into two applications.
    *   **For potted plants:** Mix 15-20% vermicompost with the potting mix. For established potted plants, top-dress with 0.5-1 kg annually.

*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract based product):**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Mix **Sagarika** at a concentration of 2-3 ml per litre of water. Spray thoroughly on the foliage, ensuring good coverage, every 15-20 days during the active growth period.
    *   **Soil Drench:** Mix **Sagarika** at a concentration of 5 ml per litre of water. Apply 1-2 litres of this solution per plant (depending on plant size) around the base, every 3-4 weeks.
