Addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies in Kaner (Nerium oleander) is crucial for its healthy growth and flowering. As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, I strongly recommend conducting a soil test through a reputable laboratory (like HAU's own soil testing lab) to accurately determine the specific nutrient status of your soil. This will provide precise recommendations tailored to your field conditions.

However, based on typical deficiency symptoms, here's how to address Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium deficiencies:

### General Approach:
Always apply fertilizers uniformly and ensure adequate moisture for nutrient uptake. For soil application, incorporate the fertilizer lightly into the soil around the plant's root zone and water thoroughly.

### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency:
**Symptoms:**
*   General yellowing (chlorosis) of older leaves, starting from the tips and margins.
*   Stunted growth and reduced vigor.
*   Smaller leaves and fewer flowers.

**Correction:**
*   **Soil Application:** Apply **Urea** (46% N) at a rate of 10-20 g per mature plant. For larger plantations, apply 50-100 kg/acre. Repeat every 4-6 weeks if symptoms persist, but avoid over-application, which can lead to excessive vegetative growth at the expense of flowering.
*   **Foliar Spray:** For quicker response, spray a 1-2% solution of **Urea** (10-20 g/L water) on the foliage during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening). Repeat every 10-15 days until symptoms improve.

### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency:
**Symptoms:**
*   Dark green or purplish discoloration of older leaves, especially on the undersides.
*   Stunted root development.
*   Delayed flowering and poor flower quality.
*   Overall stunted plant growth.

**Correction:**
*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5) at a rate of 15-30 g per mature plant. For larger plantations, apply 50-100 kg/acre.
    *   Alternatively, apply **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5) at a rate of 50-100 g per mature plant. For larger plantations, apply 150-250 kg/acre.
    *   Phosphorus is less mobile in the soil, so it's best applied near the root zone, ideally at planting or by making small holes around the plant.

### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency:
**Symptoms:**
*   Yellowing and browning (scorching) of leaf margins, especially on older leaves.
*   Weak stems and susceptibility to lodging.
*   Poor flower development and reduced disease resistance.
*   Overall wilting or drooping appearance.

**Correction:**
*   **Soil Application:** Apply **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** (60% K2O) at a rate of 10-20 g per mature plant. For larger plantations, apply 50-80 kg/acre.
*   **Foliar Spray:** For a faster uptake, spray a 0.5-1% solution of **Potassium Sulphate** (5-10 g/L water) on the foliage. Repeat every 10-15 days until symptoms improve.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Soil pH:** Ensure your soil pH is within the optimal range (6.0-7.5) for Kaner, as extreme pH can lock up nutrients, making them unavailable to the plant even if present in the soil.
*   **Organic Matter:** Incorporating well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost regularly improves soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability, contributing to overall plant health.
*   **Observation:** Monitor your plants closely after application and adjust future treatments based on their response.

Always prioritize soil testing for precise and sustainable nutrient management.
