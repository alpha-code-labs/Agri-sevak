As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for managing the mentioned pests on Kaner (Nerium oleander) in Haryana:

Here's how to control the specified pests:

### Grasshopper

Grasshoppers are generalist feeders and can cause damage to Kaner leaves.

*   **Cultural/Mechanical Control:** For small infestations, hand-picking the grasshoppers, especially nymphs, can be effective.
*   **Chemical Control:** In case of severe infestation, consider spraying with:
    *   **Malathion** 50% EC at 1.0-1.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   For an organic approach, especially against younger nymphs, formulations containing **Azadirachtin** (e.g., 1500 ppm) can be used at 3-5 ml per litre of water.

### Painted Bug

This is not known to affect Kaner. Painted bugs (Bagrada hilaris) are primarily pests of cruciferous crops like mustard, cabbage, and radish.

### Red Cotton Bug

This is not known to affect Kaner. Red cotton bugs (Dysdercus cingulatus) are primarily pests of cotton and other plants in the Malvaceae family, feeding on seeds.

### Black Ants

Black ants themselves usually do not directly damage Kaner by feeding on it. Their presence often indicates one of two things:
1.  They are tending to other sap-sucking insects (like aphids, mealybugs, or scale insects) on the Kaner plant to collect honeydew. In this case, controlling the primary sap-sucking pest will naturally reduce ant activity.
2.  They are nesting in the soil around the plant, which can sometimes disturb roots or create unsightly mounds.

*   **Indirect Control:** Inspect the Kaner plant for any sap-sucking pests. If found, control them using appropriate insecticides (e.g., **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL at 0.5 ml/L water or **Acetamiprid** 20% SP at 0.3 g/L water).
*   **Direct Control (for ant nests/trails):**
    *   For drenching ant nests around the base of the plant:
        *   **Fipronil** 5% SC at 1.0-1.5 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 2.0-2.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   For spraying directly on ant trails or visible nests on the plant:
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 0.5 ml per litre of water.

Always ensure thorough coverage when spraying and follow safety precautions as per the product label. It is advisable to spray during cooler parts of the day, preferably in the evening, to minimize impact on beneficial insects.
