As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding seed and soil treatment for Kaner (*Nerium oleander*) in Haryana:

**Seed Treatment for Kaner:**

Kaner is primarily propagated through vegetative cuttings rather than seeds for ornamental purposes. Therefore, there are no standard or routinely recommended seed treatment processes for Kaner in agricultural practices. Seed-borne diseases requiring chemical treatment are not a primary concern for this plant.

**Soil Treatment for Kaner:**

Kaner is a robust and hardy ornamental plant that generally thrives without routine chemical soil treatments. Soil treatment is typically only considered when a specific soil-borne pest (e.g., nematodes) or disease (e.g., *Phytophthora* root rot, *Fusarium* wilt) has been diagnosed and confirmed to be affecting the plants in a particular area.

In the absence of a specific diagnosed problem, general good horticultural practices are recommended to maintain soil health and plant vigor:

*   **Soil Preparation:** Ensure good soil drainage, as Kaner does not tolerate waterlogging.
*   **Organic Matter:** Incorporate well-decomposed organic matter such as farmyard manure (FYM) or compost at the time of planting or as an annual top-dressing. This improves soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability.

If a specific soil-borne problem is identified after proper diagnosis, targeted treatments may be considered. For example:

*   **For Nematodes:** If a severe nematode infestation is confirmed, soil application of bio-nematicides containing beneficial fungi like *Paecilomyces lilacinus* or *Purpureocillium lilacinum* can be considered.
*   **For Fungal Root Rots (e.g., *Phytophthora*):** If diagnosed, drenching with CIBRC-approved fungicides might be recommended. For instance:
    *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride** (e.g., 2-3 ml/L water as a drench)
    *   **Metalaxyl** (e.g., 1-2 g/L water as a drench)

However, these are specific treatments for diagnosed problems, not a general recommended process for Kaner. Routine chemical soil treatment is not a standard practice for Kaner cultivation.
