This is not known to affect Kaner.

Fruit flies (Tephritidae) and Ber fly (Carpomyia vesuviana) are primarily pests of fleshy fruits, such as those of mango, guava, citrus, and ber (Ziziphus mauritiana). Kaner (Nerium oleander) is an ornamental plant that does not produce fleshy fruits, and therefore, it is not a host for these insect pests.
