Wilt, including Fusarium wilt and Verticillium wilt, is a known and significant disease affecting Kaner (Oleander). It is primarily caused by soil-borne fungi such as *Fusarium oxysporum* f. sp. *nerii* and *Verticillium dahliae*.

Here's how to control Wilt in Kaner:

**I. Cultural Practices (Essential for prevention and management):**

1.  **Sanitation:** Immediately remove and destroy any infected plants or plant parts showing wilting symptoms. Do not compost infected material, as this can spread the disease.
2.  **Disease-Free Planting Material:** Always use healthy, certified disease-free saplings or cuttings for propagation.
3.  **Soil Drainage:** Ensure excellent soil drainage. Waterlogging stresses the plants and creates conditions favorable for the growth of wilt-causing fungi.
4.  **Sterilization of Tools:** Sterilize pruning shears and other gardening tools with a 10% bleach solution or rubbing alcohol before and after pruning each plant to prevent the spread of pathogens.
5.  **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced fertilization. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can promote lush, tender growth that may be more susceptible to disease.
6.  **Soil Solarization:** In areas where new Kaner plants are to be established, especially if previous plants suffered from wilt, soil solarization during the hot summer months (covering moist soil with clear plastic sheets for 4-6 weeks) can significantly reduce the pathogen load in the soil.

**II. Biological Control (Eco-friendly approach):**

1.  **Beneficial Microbes:** Apply bio-fungicides containing beneficial microbes to the soil around the root zone. These microbes compete with and suppress the wilt pathogens.
    *   **Trichoderma viride** (2.5 kg per acre, mixed with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed farmyard manure, or 5-10 g/L of water for soil drenching).
    *   **Pseudomonas fluorescens** (2.5 kg per acre, mixed with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed farmyard manure, or 5-10 g/L of water for soil drenching).
    *   Apply these as a soil drench around the base of the plant, preferably in the evening. Repeat applications every 2-3 months during the growing season.

**III. Chemical Control (As a last resort or in severe cases):**

Chemical control for established wilt is challenging as the pathogen is systemic. However, fungicides can be used as a preventive measure or to slow down disease progression in early stages.

1.  **Soil Drench:**
    *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: Apply as a soil drench at a concentration of 1-2 g per litre of water around the base of the affected plant. Ensure the solution penetrates the root zone. Repeat after 15-20 days if symptoms persist or for preventive measures in susceptible plants.
    *   **Thiophanate-methyl** 70% WP: Apply as a soil drench at a concentration of 1-1.5 g per litre of water around the base of the plant.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions when using any chemical or biological product.
*   Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods, is the most effective strategy for long-term wilt management.
*   Early detection and intervention are crucial for successful control of wilt diseases.
