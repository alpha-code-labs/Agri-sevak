Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU), Hisar, I can provide you with scientifically verified advice on addressing micronutrient deficiencies in Kaner (Nerium oleander).

Kaner, like all plants, requires a balanced supply of essential micronutrients for healthy growth and flowering. Deficiencies can lead to various physiological disorders. The most accurate way to diagnose a deficiency is through soil testing and plant tissue analysis. Visual symptoms are indicative but should be confirmed.

Here's how to address the specified micronutrient deficiencies in Kaner:

### General Recommendations Before Treatment:

1.  **Soil Testing:** Always conduct a soil test first. This will accurately identify which specific micronutrients are deficient and to what extent, allowing for precise application rates.
2.  **pH Management:** Soil pH significantly affects micronutrient availability. Kaner prefers slightly acidic to neutral soils (pH 6.0-7.0). In alkaline soils common in Haryana, the availability of Iron, Zinc, and Manganese can be reduced.
3.  **Organic Matter:** Incorporating well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost improves soil structure and nutrient retention, including micronutrients.

### Addressing Specific Micronutrient Deficiencies:

#### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Small, narrow leaves (often called 'little leaf'), reduced internode length leading to rosette-like growth, interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, and stunted plant growth.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Apply a solution of **Zinc sulphate** (33% Zn) at 0.5% concentration (5 grams per litre of water). Repeat after 15-20 days if symptoms persist.
    *   **Soil Application:** For severe deficiencies, apply **Zinc sulphate** (33% Zn) at 50-100 grams per plant, mixed well into the soil around the root zone, once a year.

#### 2. Iron (Fe) / Ferrous Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Pronounced interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, where the leaf tissue turns yellow while the veins remain distinctly green. In severe cases, the entire leaf may turn pale yellow or white, and growth is stunted.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Apply a solution of **Ferrous sulphate** (19% Fe) at 0.5% concentration (5 grams per litre of water). For better absorption, you can add a few drops of a non-ionic spreader. Repeat every 10-15 days until symptoms disappear.
    *   **Soil Application:** In highly alkaline soils, **Iron EDTA** (chelated iron) is more effective. Apply **Iron EDTA** at 10-20 grams per plant, mixed into the soil. Alternatively, **Ferrous sulphate** can be applied at 100-200 grams per plant, but its availability might be limited in high pH soils.

#### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, thickening and distortion of young leaves, cracking or splitting of stems and petioles, death of growing points (apical meristems), and poor flowering.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Apply a solution of **Borax** (10.5% B) or **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (20.5% B) at 0.1-0.2% concentration (1-2 grams per litre of water). Apply during the active growth phase.
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Borax** at 10-20 grams per plant, mixed into the soil around the root zone, once a year. Be cautious with Boron as excess can be toxic.

#### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Dieback of growing points (shoot tips and root tips), distortion and curling of young leaves, marginal necrosis (browning of leaf edges) on new leaves, and overall stunted growth.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Apply a solution of **Calcium nitrate** (18.8% Ca) at 0.5% concentration (5 grams per litre of water). Repeat every 10-15 days as needed.
    *   **Soil Application:** Incorporate **Gypsum** (Calcium sulphate) or **Calcium nitrate** into the soil. For individual plants, apply **Calcium nitrate** at 50-100 grams per plant, mixed into the soil.

#### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, starting from the leaf margins and progressing inwards, often with a reddish or purplish tint. In severe cases, leaves may become brittle and drop prematurely.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Apply a solution of **Magnesium sulphate** (Epsom salt, 9.6% Mg) at 0.5-1.0% concentration (5-10 grams per litre of water). Repeat every 15-20 days until symptoms improve.
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Magnesium sulphate** at 100-200 grams per plant, mixed into the soil around the root zone, once or twice a year.

#### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, similar to iron deficiency but often with a finer network of green veins and sometimes small necrotic (dead) spots appearing on the yellowed tissue. Growth can be stunted.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Apply a solution of **Manganese sulphate** (30.5% Mn) at 0.5% concentration (5 grams per litre of water). Repeat after 15-20 days if symptoms persist.
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Manganese sulphate** at 50-100 grams per plant, mixed into the soil around the root zone, once a year.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always spray in the early morning or late evening to avoid scorching of leaves and ensure better absorption.
*   Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage during foliar application.
*   Do not mix multiple micronutrient fertilizers without confirming compatibility.
*   Regular monitoring of plant health is crucial for timely intervention.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively manage micronutrient deficiencies in your Kaner plants and promote their healthy growth and vibrant flowering.
