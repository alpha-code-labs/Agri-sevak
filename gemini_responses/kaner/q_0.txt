Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing fungal diseases in Kaner (Oleander) in Haryana.

It's important to note that while Kaner can be affected by various fungal diseases, some terms you've mentioned are not commonly recognized as specific diseases of Kaner.

Here's how to control the fungal diseases that are known to affect Kaner:

**General Cultural Practices for Fungal Disease Management in Kaner:**
Before resorting to chemical control, implementing good cultural practices can significantly reduce disease incidence:
*   **Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy all fallen leaves, infected branches, and plant debris from around the Kaner plants. This reduces the source of inoculum.
*   **Pruning:** Prune the plants to improve air circulation within the canopy. This helps in quick drying of foliage, making it less conducive for fungal growth. Use clean, sterilized pruning tools.
*   **Watering:** Avoid overhead irrigation, especially in the evening. Water at the base of the plant in the morning to allow foliage to dry completely during the day.
*   **Spacing:** Ensure adequate spacing between plants to promote good air movement.
*   **Nutrition:** Provide balanced nutrition to keep plants healthy and less susceptible to diseases. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can lead to lush, tender growth more prone to fungal attacks.

**Specific Disease Management:**

**1. Alternaria Leaf Spot, Anthracnose, Blight, and Brown Spot:**
These diseases often manifest as spots, lesions, or blighting on leaves, stems, and sometimes flowers. They are caused by various fungi (e.g., *Alternaria spp.*, *Colletotrichum spp.*, *Phomopsis spp.*) and can lead to defoliation and aesthetic damage.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   For protective and curative action, spray with a broad-spectrum fungicide. Repeat sprays at 10-15 day intervals, especially during humid or rainy periods, or when symptoms appear.
    *   **Mancozeb 75% WP:** 2.5 g per litre of water.
    *   **Carbendazim 50% WP:** 1 g per litre of water.
    *   **Propiconazole 25% EC:** 0.5-1 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:** 0.5-1 ml per litre of water.

**2. Downy Mildew:**
While less common on Kaner compared to powdery mildew, it can occur, appearing as yellowish spots on the upper leaf surface and a downy growth on the underside.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   If symptoms appear, spray with a fungicide specifically effective against oomycetes.
    *   **Mancozeb 75% WP:** 2.5 g per litre of water.
    *   **Propineb 70% WP:** 2.5 g per litre of water.
    *   **Metalaxyl 8% + Mancozeb 64% WP:** 2.5 g per litre of water.

**3. Powdery Mildew:**
This is a common fungal disease on Kaner, characterized by white, powdery patches on leaves, stems, and flower buds. It can distort growth and reduce flowering.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Apply fungicides specifically targeting powdery mildew at the first sign of symptoms.
    *   **Sulphur 80% WP:** 2-3 g per litre of water (ensure good coverage, avoid spraying in very hot conditions).
    *   **Myclobutanil 10% WP:** 0.5 g per litre of water.
    *   **Penconazole 10% EC:** 0.5 ml per litre of water.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the fungicide label for correct dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in fungal populations.
*   For severe infestations, multiple applications may be necessary.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension office or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your exact situation if the problem persists.
