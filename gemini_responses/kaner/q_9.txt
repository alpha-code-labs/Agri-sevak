Mites, including Red Spider Mite (*Tetranychus urticae*) and Rust Mites (Eriophyidae family), are common pests of Kaner (Oleander) and can cause significant damage if not controlled.

Here's how to control them:

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies:**

1.  **Regular Inspection:** Frequently check the undersides of leaves for mites, webbing (for red spider mites), or bronzing/rusting (for rust mites). Early detection is key.
2.  **Water Spray:** For mild infestations, a strong jet of water can dislodge mites from the plant, especially from the undersides of leaves. Repeat every few days.
3.  **Pruning:** Remove and destroy heavily infested leaves or branches to reduce mite populations.
4.  **Maintain Plant Health:** Healthy plants are more resilient to pest attacks. Ensure proper watering, nutrition, and sunlight.

**Chemical Control (Acaricides):**

When infestations are severe or IPM methods are insufficient, chemical control may be necessary. Always ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where mites reside. Rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

Here are some CIBRC approved acaricides effective against mites on Kaner:

*   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** Apply at a rate of **0.5 - 1 ml per litre of water**. This acaricide is effective against all developmental stages of mites.
*   **Propargite 57% EC:** Apply at a rate of **1 - 1.5 ml per litre of water**. This is a broad-spectrum acaricide effective against various mite species.
*   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP:** Apply at a rate of **2 - 3 g per litre of water**. Sulphur is effective against rust mites and also suppresses spider mites. It should be used with caution in very hot weather (above 30-32°C) as it can cause phytotoxicity.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Application Timing:** Spray during cooler parts of the day, preferably early morning or late evening, to avoid rapid evaporation and potential phytotoxicity.
*   **Repeat Applications:** Mites have a short life cycle. A second application after 7-10 days may be necessary to control newly hatched mites.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, mask, and eye protection while handling and spraying chemicals. Follow the instructions on the product label carefully.
