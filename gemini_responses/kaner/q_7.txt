As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Dieback, Twig blight, and Tikka disease in Kaner (Nerium oleander) in Haryana.

### Control of Dieback and Twig Blight in Kaner

Dieback and Twig blight are common fungal diseases affecting Kaner, often caused by various fungi such as *Phomopsis* spp., *Colletotrichum* spp., *Botryosphaeria* spp., or *Diplodia* spp. These conditions lead to the progressive death of branches, starting from the tips.

**Symptoms:**
*   Wilting, yellowing, and browning of leaves on affected twigs.
*   Darkening, shriveling, and eventual death of twigs and branches, often progressing downwards.
*   Cankers or sunken lesions may appear on stems.
*   In severe cases, entire branches or even the plant may succumb.

**Control Measures:**

1.  **Cultural and Mechanical Practices:**
    *   **Pruning:** Immediately prune affected branches well into the healthy wood, at least 15-20 cm below the visible symptoms. Make clean cuts.
    *   **Sanitation:** Collect and destroy all pruned material by burning or deep burial to eliminate inoculum sources. Do not compost infected plant parts.
    *   **Tool Sterilization:** Sterilize pruning tools (e.g., with 70% alcohol or a 10% bleach solution) before and after each cut, and between plants, to prevent disease spread.
    *   **Air Circulation:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to promote good air circulation, which helps reduce humidity around the foliage.
    *   **Water Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day, to minimize leaf wetness periods. Water at the base of the plant.
    *   **Plant Vigor:** Maintain plant health through balanced fertilization and appropriate watering, as stressed plants are more susceptible.

2.  **Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
    *   Apply fungicides preventively during periods conducive to disease development (e.g., high humidity, monsoon season) or therapeutically after pruning.
    *   **For Dieback and Twig Blight:**
        *   Spray with **Copper oxychloride** 50% WP at a concentration of 2.5-3.0 g/L of water.
        *   Alternatively, spray with **Carbendazim** 50% WP at a concentration of 1.0 g/L of water.
        *   Another effective option is **Mancozeb** 75% WP at a concentration of 2.0-2.5 g/L of water.
    *   Ensure thorough coverage of all foliage and stems. Repeat applications at 10-15 day intervals if disease pressure persists or environmental conditions remain favorable for disease development.

### Tikka Disease in Kaner

This is not known to affect Kaner. (Tikka disease is a specific common name primarily associated with leaf spot diseases of groundnut caused by *Cercospora arachidicola* and *Phaeoisariopsis personata*.)
