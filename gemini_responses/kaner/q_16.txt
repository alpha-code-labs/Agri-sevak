As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified fertilizer doses for Kaner (Nerium oleander) in Haryana.

**Important Note:** The most accurate fertilizer recommendation can only be made after a comprehensive soil test. This helps determine the existing nutrient levels in your soil and avoids over-application or deficiency, leading to optimal plant health and resource efficiency. Please contact your nearest Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or HAU extension center for soil testing services.

For established Kaner plants (more than 1 year old) in average Haryana soils, the following general guidelines can be followed. Adjustments should be made based on plant vigor and observed deficiencies.

**General Application Timing:**
*   **First application:** Early spring (February-March) before new growth starts.
*   **Second application:** Post-monsoon (September-October) to support autumn flowering and prepare for winter.

**Recommended Fertilizer Doses for Kaner (per mature plant per year):**

*   **Urea (46% N):**
    *   **Dose:** 50-100 g, split into two applications (25-50 g each).
    *   **Method:** Broadcast evenly around the base of the plant, keeping it away from the main stem, and lightly incorporate into the soil. Water immediately after application.

*   **Nano-Urea (Liquid):**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml/L of water.
    *   **Method:** Apply as a foliar spray. Spray thoroughly on the foliage until runoff. Apply 2-3 sprays during the active growth phase (e.g., 30 and 60 days after spring growth initiation), ensuring good coverage.

*   **DAP (Di-ammonium Phosphate) (18% N, 46% P2O5):**
    *   **Dose:** 60-120 g, split into two applications (30-60 g each).
    *   **Method:** Apply similar to Urea, around the plant base, lightly incorporate, and water.

*   **Nano-DAP (Liquid):**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml/L of water.
    *   **Method:** Apply as a foliar spray. Spray thoroughly on the foliage. Apply 1-2 sprays during the pre-flowering stage or when phosphorus deficiency is suspected.

*   **NPK (Compound Fertilizers, e.g., 19-19-19 or 12-32-16):**
    *   **Granular NPK (e.g., 19-19-19):**
        *   **Dose:** 75-150 g, split into two applications.
        *   **Method:** Apply around the plant base, incorporate, and water.
    *   **Water-soluble NPK (e.g., 19-19-19 for foliar spray):**
        *   **Dose:** 5 g/L of water.
        *   **Method:** Spray on foliage during active growth, 2-3 times at 15-20 day intervals.

*   **SSP (Single Super Phosphate) (16% P2O5, 11% S):**
    *   **Dose:** 180-360 g, applied once a year in early spring.
    *   **Method:** Apply around the plant base, incorporate well into the soil.

*   **Potash (Muriate of Potash - MOP, 60% K2O):**
    *   **Dose:** 50-100 g, split into two applications.
    *   **Method:** Apply around the plant base, incorporate, and water.

*   **Sulphur (Elemental Sulphur 90% WDG):**
    *   **Dose:** 10-20 g, once a year in early spring.
    *   **Method:** Broadcast around the plant base and lightly incorporate. (Note: If SSP is used, additional Sulphur might not be required).

**Additional Important Considerations:**

*   **Young Plants:** For newly planted Kaner, reduce the granular fertilizer doses by half for the first year.
*   **Organic Matter:** Supplementing with well-rotted farmyard manure (FYM) or compost (5-10 kg per plant annually) is highly beneficial for improving soil structure and nutrient retention.
*   **Watering:** Always water the plants thoroughly after applying granular fertilizers to help dissolve the nutrients and prevent root burn.
*   **Observation:** Regularly monitor your plants for signs of nutrient deficiencies or excesses and adjust your fertilization program accordingly.
