Kaner (Nerium oleander) is well-known for its high toxicity to most animals, including wild animals, if ingested. All parts of the plant contain cardiac glycosides, which are highly poisonous. Due to this inherent natural defense mechanism:

*   **Protection from Consumption:** Wild animals generally avoid browsing or consuming Kaner. Therefore, significant damage to Kaner through ingestion by wild animals is not a commonly observed problem in Haryana, and specific protective measures against consumption are typically not required. The plant possesses its own robust natural defense mechanism.

*   **Protection from Physical Damage (e.g., trampling, rubbing):** While consumption is rare, wild animals might occasionally cause physical damage through trampling, rubbing, or rooting near the plant. In such specific and rare instances, general physical deterrents can be considered:
    *   **Physical Barriers:** Installing a sturdy fence around individual plants or the planting area can prevent animals like Nilgai, wild boar, or stray cattle from accessing and physically damaging the plants. The type of fence (e.g., barbed wire, chain-link, electric fence) would depend on the specific animal pressure and local regulations.
    *   **Tree Guards:** For young Kaner plants, individual tree guards made of wire mesh or other durable material can offer protection against rubbing or minor physical contact.

No CIBRC approved chemical repellents are typically recommended for Kaner, as its natural toxicity is the primary and most effective deterrent against animal consumption, and physical damage is best addressed through physical barriers.
