As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned conditions in Kaner (Oleander) in Haryana:

*   **Scab:** This is not known to affect Kaner.
*   **Canker:** Kaner is susceptible to bacterial canker, primarily caused by *Pseudomonas savastanoi* pv. *nerii*.
    *   **Cultural Control:**
        *   Prune and destroy all infected branches and twigs immediately upon noticing symptoms. Make cuts well below the visible canker.
        *   Sanitize pruning tools with a 10% bleach solution or rubbing alcohol between cuts to prevent spread.
        *   Avoid wounding the plant, as wounds serve as entry points for bacteria.
    *   **Chemical Control (as a protective measure or after pruning):**
        *   Apply a copper-based bactericide.
        *   **Copper oxychloride** at 2-3 g/L of water.
        *   **Copper hydroxide** at 2-3 g/L of water.
        *   Ensure thorough coverage of the plant, especially after pruning. Repeat application if conditions are conducive to disease spread.
*   **Gummosis:** This is not known to affect Kaner as a primary disease. Gummosis is typically a symptom of stress, injury, or other underlying diseases like canker or root rot in woody plants. Addressing the primary cause is essential.
*   **Lichen:** This is not known to affect Kaner as a harmful condition. Lichens are symbiotic organisms (fungus and alga) that grow on the bark of trees and shrubs. They are generally harmless epiphytes and do not parasitize the plant, often indicating good air quality and a healthy, slow-growing plant. Control is usually not necessary.
