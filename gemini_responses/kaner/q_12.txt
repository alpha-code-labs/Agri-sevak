As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU), Hisar, I can confirm that Scale insects and Mealybugs are common pests of Kaner (Nerium oleander) in Haryana. Effective control requires an integrated approach.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Scale Insects and Mealybugs in Kaner:**

1.  **Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
    *   **Pruning:** Regularly inspect plants. Prune and destroy heavily infested branches and leaves to reduce pest populations. Dispose of infested material properly to prevent spread.
    *   **Water Jet:** For light infestations, a strong jet of water can dislodge mealybugs and scale crawlers from the plant surfaces. Repeat as needed.
    *   **Manual Removal:** On smaller plants or for localized infestations, mealybugs can be removed manually using a cotton swab dipped in rubbing alcohol.
    *   **Hygiene:** Remove plant debris around the base of the plant to eliminate potential hiding spots for pests.

2.  **Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved):**
    When infestations are severe or cultural methods are insufficient, chemical control may be necessary. Always ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and stems where these pests often hide. Repeat applications may be required due to the protected nature of scale insects and the waxy coating of mealybugs.

    *   **Horticultural Mineral Oil (Paraffinic Oil):**
        *   **Dosage:** 10-20 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Application:** Apply as a thorough foliar spray, ensuring complete coverage. Horticultural oils work by suffocating the insects. They are particularly effective against scale crawlers and mealybugs. Apply during cooler parts of the day to avoid phytotoxicity.
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:**
        *   **Dosage:** 0.5 - 1.0 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Application:** A systemic insecticide that is absorbed by the plant and kills sap-sucking insects as they feed. Apply as a foliar spray.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:**
        *   **Dosage:** 0.3 - 0.5 g per litre of water.
        *   **Application:** Another systemic insecticide effective against sap-sucking pests. Apply as a foliar spray.
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:**
        *   **Dosage:** 1.0 - 1.25 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Application:** An insect growth regulator that interferes with the molting process of nymphs, preventing them from developing into adults. It is particularly effective against scale nymphs and mealybug nymphs.
    *   **Malathion 50% EC:**
        *   **Dosage:** 1.5 - 2.0 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Application:** A contact insecticide that provides quick knockdown. Ensure thorough coverage.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Timing:** For scale insects, the crawler stage (young, mobile scales) is most vulnerable to insecticides. Monitor plants closely to identify this stage.
*   **Rotation:** To prevent the development of pesticide resistance, it is advisable to rotate between different classes of insecticides (e.g., use an oil, then a systemic, then an IGR).
*   **Safety:** Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label, including recommended safety precautions (wearing gloves, mask, etc.).
*   **Environmental Impact:** Consider the impact on beneficial insects. Horticultural oils and insecticidal soaps are generally less harmful to beneficial insects than broad-spectrum insecticides.
