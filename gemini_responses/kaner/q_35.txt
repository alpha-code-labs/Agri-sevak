As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide guidance on Kaner (Nerium oleander), which is primarily grown as an ornamental plant in Haryana. The concepts of "maturity signs" and "harvesting time" are typically applied to agricultural crops for yield, which is not the primary purpose for Kaner. However, I can explain these terms in the context of an ornamental plant and detail the "cutting process" for maintenance and propagation.

### Maturity Signs for Kaner

Kaner is an ornamental shrub or small tree. Unlike agricultural crops that have specific maturity signs indicating readiness for harvest (e.g., fruit ripening, grain filling), Kaner's "maturity" refers to its developmental stage as a well-established, flowering plant.

*   A Kaner plant is considered **mature** when it has developed a strong root system, reached a desirable size and shape, and consistently produces abundant flowers during its natural flowering season (typically from spring through autumn in Haryana).
*   Maturity is more about the plant's overall health, vigor, and ability to flower profusely rather than a specific physiological indicator for a "harvestable" product.

### Harvesting Time for Kaner

Kaner plants themselves are not "harvested" as an agricultural crop.

*   If "harvesting" refers to the collection of **flowers** for ornamental display, religious offerings, or personal use, they are typically picked when they are fully open and fresh. This is usually best done in the morning after any dew has dried.
*   **Deadheading** (removing spent or faded flowers) is a common horticultural practice for Kaner. This is done to maintain the plant's aesthetic appeal, prevent seed formation (which can divert energy from flowering), and encourage the production of new blooms. This is a maintenance activity, not a "harvest."

### Cutting Process for Kaner

The "cutting process" for Kaner primarily refers to **pruning** for maintenance and shaping, or taking **cuttings** for propagation.

#### 1. Pruning (Maintenance and Shaping)

Pruning is essential for maintaining the health, shape, and flowering potential of Kaner.

*   **Purpose:** To remove dead, diseased, or damaged branches, improve air circulation within the plant, control size, encourage bushier growth, and promote more abundant flowering.
*   **Timing:**
    *   **Major Pruning:** The best time for significant pruning is in **late winter or early spring**, just before new growth begins. This allows the plant to recover quickly and produce flowers on new growth.
    *   **Light Pruning/Deadheading:** Can be done throughout the growing season to remove spent flowers and maintain shape.
*   **Method:**
    *   Always use sharp, clean pruning shears or loppers to make clean cuts and prevent disease transmission.
    *   Start by removing any dead, diseased, or broken branches, cutting back to healthy wood.
    *   Remove any branches that are crossing or rubbing against each other.
    *   To encourage a bushier plant, cut back stems to an outward-facing bud or a side branch.
    *   To reduce the overall size of an overgrown plant, you can cut back up to one-third of the plant's total height. For very old or neglected plants, a more severe rejuvenation prune (cutting stems back to about 30-60 cm from the ground) can be performed, but this may result in fewer flowers in the subsequent season.
    *   **Important Caution:** Kaner sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation. Always wear gloves and protective eyewear when pruning, and wash hands thoroughly afterwards. Do not burn pruned material where fumes could be inhaled.

#### 2. Propagation by Cuttings

Kaner is easily propagated from stem cuttings.

*   **Purpose:** To create new Kaner plants from an existing parent plant.
*   **Timing:** Best done in **spring or early summer** when the plant is actively growing.
*   **Method:**
    *   **Select Cuttings:** Choose healthy, semi-hardwood stems (stems that are firm but not fully woody) that are about 15-20 cm long. Avoid very soft new growth or very old, woody stems.
    *   **Prepare Cuttings:** Remove all leaves from the bottom half of the cutting. Make a clean cut just below a node (the point where a leaf or branch emerges).
    *   **Rooting Hormone (Optional but Recommended):** Dip the cut end of the stem into a rooting hormone powder or liquid to encourage faster and more reliable rooting.
    *   **Planting:** Insert the prepared cuttings into a well-draining rooting medium, such as a mix of sand and peat moss, coco-peat, or perlite. Ensure at least one node is buried in the medium.
    *   **Environment:** Keep the rooting medium consistently moist but not waterlogged. Place the cuttings in a warm location with indirect light. High humidity can aid rooting; you can achieve this by covering the pot with a clear plastic bag (supported so it doesn't touch the leaves).
    *   **Rooting:** Roots typically develop in 4-8 weeks. Once a good root system has formed, the new plants can be carefully transplanted into individual pots or directly into the garden.
