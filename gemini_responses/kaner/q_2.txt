Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing rust diseases in Kaner (*Nerium oleander*).

Kaner is susceptible to rust disease, primarily caused by the fungus *Uromyces nerii*. This typically manifests as orange-brown pustules, mainly on the undersides of leaves, which can be categorized under "Brown" or "Red" rust in common parlance. The terms "Black" and "Yellow" rust are generally associated with cereal crops and are not typical for Kaner.

Regarding "White Rust": True white rust, caused by *Albugo* species (an oomycete, not a true fungus), is **not known to affect Kaner**.

Here's how to control rust disease (*Uromyces nerii*) in Kaner:

**Symptoms of Rust on Kaner:**
*   Small, raised, powdery pustules, typically orange-brown in colour, appearing predominantly on the undersides of leaves.
*   In severe cases, these pustules can also appear on stems and petioles.
*   Infected leaves may turn yellow, wilt, and drop prematurely, leading to defoliation and reduced plant vigour.

**Integrated Disease Management (IDM) for Rust in Kaner:**

**1. Cultural and Preventive Measures:**
*   **Sanitation:** Regularly inspect plants. As soon as symptoms are observed, carefully remove and destroy (burn or bury deep) all infected leaves and plant debris to reduce the source of inoculum.
*   **Pruning:** Prune the plants to improve air circulation within the canopy. This helps to dry leaf surfaces quickly, making them less conducive for fungal spore germination.
*   **Watering:** Avoid overhead irrigation, especially in the evening, as prolonged leaf wetness promotes rust development. Water the plants at the base in the morning.
*   **Plant Spacing:** Ensure adequate spacing between plants to facilitate good air movement.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Provide balanced nutrition to the plants. Over-fertilization with nitrogen can lead to lush, soft growth that is more susceptible to diseases.

**2. Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
For effective control, especially in cases of severe infection or during periods conducive to disease development (high humidity, moderate temperatures), chemical intervention may be necessary. Always rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

Apply fungicides as a foliar spray, ensuring thorough coverage of both upper and lower leaf surfaces. Repeat applications at 10-15 day intervals, depending on disease severity and weather conditions.

Here are some CIBRC-approved fungicides effective against rusts:

*   **Propiconazole** (25% EC): 0.5 ml per litre of water.
*   **Hexaconazole** (5% SC): 1 ml per litre of water.
*   **Mancozeb** (75% WP): 2.5 grams per litre of water. (This is a contact fungicide, good for preventive application or in rotation).
*   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC): 0.5 ml per litre of water.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the fungicide label carefully, including dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and application.
*   Avoid spraying during hot midday hours or when rain is expected shortly after application.

By implementing these measures, you can effectively manage rust disease in your Kaner plants.
