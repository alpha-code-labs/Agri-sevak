Termites and root-knot nematodes are common soil pests that can significantly impact the health and vigor of Kaner (Nerium oleander) plants in Haryana. Effective management requires an integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods.

### General Cultural Practices (for both pests):

*   **Soil Health:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost regularly to improve soil structure, water retention, and microbial activity, which can naturally suppress pests.
*   **Sanitation:** Remove any dead or decaying plant material, wood debris, or stumps from the vicinity of Kaner plants, as these can serve as breeding grounds for termites.
*   **Water Management:** Ensure proper drainage to prevent waterlogging, which can stress plants and make them more susceptible to pest attacks.

### Control of Termites:

**Symptoms:** Wilting, yellowing of leaves, stunted growth, hollowed stems or branches, and the presence of characteristic mud channels on the stem base or surrounding soil.

1.  **Biological Control:**
    *   **Metarhizium anisopliae:** Apply commercial formulations of this entomopathogenic fungus. Mix 2.5 kg of the formulation with 50 kg of well-decomposed FYM or compost and apply it around the base of the affected Kaner plants, then irrigate lightly.

2.  **Chemical Control (Soil Drenching):**
    *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC:** Mix 2.5 ml per liter of water and drench the soil thoroughly around the base of the affected Kaner plants. For larger areas, use 2.5 liters per acre.
    *   **Fipronil 5% SC:** Mix 1.5-2 ml per liter of water and drench the soil around the base of the plants.

### Control of Nematodes (Root-knot):

**Symptoms:** Stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, wilting even with adequate moisture, and characteristic galls or knots on the roots (confirm by carefully examining the roots of an affected plant).

1.  **Biological Control:**
    *   **Purpureocillium lilacinum (formerly Paecilomyces lilacinus):** Apply 2.5-5 kg of the commercial formulation per acre, mixed with 50 kg of well-decomposed FYM or compost, and incorporate it into the soil around the plants. Alternatively, drench with a solution of 5-10 g per liter of water.
    *   **Trichoderma viride/harzianum:** While primarily a bio-fungicide, it promotes plant growth and can enhance plant resistance to nematodes. Apply 2.5-5 kg per acre mixed with FYM and incorporate into the soil.

2.  **Chemical Control (Soil Drenching):**
    *   **Fipronil 5% SC:** While primarily an insecticide, it exhibits some efficacy against nematodes. Mix 1.5-2 ml per liter of water and drench the soil around the base of the plants.

### Important Considerations:

*   Always read and strictly follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions provided on the product label.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, and protective clothing when handling any chemical pesticides.
*   Apply chemicals during the cooler parts of the day, preferably in the evening, to minimize evaporation and maximize efficacy.
*   Regularly monitor your Kaner plants for early signs of pest infestation to allow for timely and effective intervention.
