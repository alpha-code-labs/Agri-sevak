As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified recommendations for the use of growth regulators and micronutrients on Kaner (Nerium oleander) in Haryana:

1.  **Ethephon (Ethrel):**
    *   **Purpose:** To promote flowering, induce branching, and improve plant architecture.
    *   **Recommended Dose:** For foliar application, use **Ethephon** (39% SL formulation) at a concentration of **0.5 - 1.0 ml per liter of water**.
    *   **Application:** Spray thoroughly to cover the foliage, preferably in the morning or late afternoon. Repeat application after 15-20 days if needed, but avoid excessive use.

2.  **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D):**
    *   **Recommendation:** This is not known to be recommended or advisable as a growth regulator for general foliar application on Kaner. **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid** is primarily used as a broadleaf herbicide in agriculture. Even at very low concentrations, it can cause severe phytotoxicity, leading to distorted growth, leaf malformations, and potential damage to ornamental plants like Kaner. Therefore, its use as a growth regulator on Kaner is strongly discouraged.

3.  **Boron:**
    *   **Purpose:** Boron is an essential micronutrient vital for cell wall formation, sugar transport, flowering, and overall plant health. Deficiency can lead to poor flowering and stunted growth.
    *   **Recommended Dose:** For foliar application, use a soluble boron product such as **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (containing approximately 20.5% Boron) at a concentration of **1.0 - 2.0 grams per liter of water**.
    *   **Application:** Spray thoroughly to cover the foliage, ensuring even distribution. Apply during periods of active growth or if boron deficiency symptoms are observed. Avoid application during peak sunlight hours.
