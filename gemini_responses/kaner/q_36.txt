Kaner (Nerium oleander) is a highly poisonous ornamental plant. All parts of the plant, including its seeds (which are botanically considered fruits), are toxic and not suitable for human or animal consumption.

Therefore, the concepts of improving 'Yield, Fruit quality, and Storage life' as typically applied to agricultural crops for consumption or commercial purposes are not relevant or applicable to Kaner. Kaner is cultivated for its ornamental value (flowers and foliage), not for its fruit.
