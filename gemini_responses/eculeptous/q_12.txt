Scale insects and Mealybugs are significant pests of Eucalyptus (assuming 'Eculeptous' refers to Eucalyptus) in Haryana, especially on young plants and in nurseries. Effective control requires an integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategy:**

1.  **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect plants, especially the undersides of leaves, stems, and branch crotches, for early detection of pest colonies.
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy heavily infested branches, twigs, or leaves to reduce pest populations.
    *   **Plant Health:** Ensure proper nutrition and irrigation to maintain plant vigor, as stressed plants are more susceptible.
    *   **Sanitation:** Remove weeds and plant debris that can harbor pests.
3.  **Biological Control:**
    *   **Natural Enemies:** Encourage natural predators like ladybird beetles (e.g., *Cryptolaemus montrouzieri* for mealybugs) and parasitic wasps, which can help keep populations in check. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.
    *   **Neem-based Formulations:** Products containing **Azadirachtin** can act as antifeedants and insect growth regulators, disrupting pest development.
4.  **Chemical Control (as per CIBRC approved technical names):**
    *   For effective chemical control, ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and stems where these pests often hide. Repeat applications may be necessary based on pest severity and life cycle.
    *   **Foliar Spray:**
        *   **Buprofezin**: Apply at 1.25 ml per litre of water. This is an Insect Growth Regulator (IGR) effective against nymphs, preventing their molting.
        *   **Imidacloprid**: Apply at 0.5-0.75 ml per litre of water. This is a systemic insecticide that provides good residual control.
        *   **Thiamethoxam**: Apply at 0.25-0.5 g per litre of water. Another systemic insecticide effective against sucking pests.
        *   **Acetamiprid**: Apply at 0.2-0.4 g per litre of water. A systemic neonicotinoid insecticide.
        *   **Dinotefuran**: Apply at 0.5 g per litre of water. A systemic insecticide with quick action.
        *   **Malathion**: Apply at 2 ml per litre of water. A contact insecticide that requires thorough coverage.
        *   **Azadirachtin** (1500 ppm formulation): Apply at 5 ml per litre of water. Effective as a repellent and growth disruptor, especially for early infestations.
    *   **Soil Drench (for systemic control in larger trees):**
        *   **Imidacloprid**: Apply at 1-2 ml per litre of water, drenching the soil around the base of the tree. The dosage depends on the tree size and age. This provides long-lasting systemic protection.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the label instructions for any pesticide product regarding dosage, application method, safety precautions, and re-entry intervals.
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
