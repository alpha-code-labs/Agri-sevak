Regarding your query on weed control in *Eucalyptus* (assuming 'Eculeptous' refers to *Eucalyptus* species), effective weed management is crucial for healthy growth and yield. Here are the scientifically verified recommendations for Haryana, keeping in mind the listed weeds:

**General Weed Management Principles in *Eucalyptus* Plantations:**

1.  **Manual Weeding:** This is particularly effective for young plantations. Regular weeding around the base of saplings helps reduce competition for nutrients, water, and sunlight.
2.  **Mulching:** Applying organic mulch (e.g., crop residues, dry leaves, wood chips) around the base of trees can effectively suppress weed growth, conserve soil moisture, and improve soil health.
3.  **Inter-cultivation:** Shallow cultivation between rows can control weeds, but care must be taken to avoid damaging the tree roots, especially in young plantations.

**Chemical Weed Control:**

**A. Pre-emergent Herbicides (Applied before weed emergence, usually after planting or transplanting):**
These herbicides form a chemical barrier in the soil, preventing weed seeds from germinating. Ensure the soil is moist for optimal efficacy.

*   For broad-spectrum control of germinating broadleaf and narrowleaf weeds:
    *   **Pendimethalin** 30% EC at 1.0-1.5 kg active ingredient per acre (equivalent to 3.3-5.0 L of product) in 200-300 L of water, applied within 3 days of planting.
    *   **Oxyfluorfen** 23.5% EC at 0.2-0.3 kg active ingredient per acre (equivalent to 850-1275 ml of product) in 200-300 L of water, applied within 3 days of planting.

**B. Post-emergent Herbicides (Applied after weeds have emerged):**
These are applied directly to the weeds. Extreme care must be taken to avoid contact with *Eucalyptus* foliage or bark, especially for non-selective herbicides. Use a protective shield while spraying young plants.

*   **For general broadleaf and narrowleaf weeds (including Bathu, Congress grass, Phalaris minor) in inter-row spaces or as a directed spray, avoiding contact with *Eucalyptus*:**
    *   **Glyphosate** 41% SL at 1.0-1.5 kg active ingredient per acre (equivalent to 2.5-3.75 L of product) in 200-300 L of water, when weeds are actively growing.
    *   **Paraquat dichloride** 24% SL at 0.5-1.0 kg active ingredient per acre (equivalent to 2.0-4.0 L of product) in 200-300 L of water, as a contact herbicide for quick knockdown.

*   **For specific broadleaf weeds (like Bathu, Congress grass) in older plantations where drift can be managed:**
    *   **2,4-D ethyl ester** 38% EC at 0.5-1.0 kg active ingredient per acre (equivalent to 1.3-2.6 L of product) in 200-300 L of water, as a directed spray.

*   **For specific narrowleaf weeds (like Phalaris minor):**
    *   **Quizalofop-ethyl** 5% EC at 0.05-0.1 kg active ingredient per acre (equivalent to 1.0-2.0 L of product) in 200-300 L of water, as a directed spray.

**C. Control of Parasitic Weeds:**

*   **Amarbail (Cuscuta spp.):**
    *   **Manual removal:** This is the most effective method. Regularly inspect plants and remove Amarbail strands as soon as they appear, before they produce seeds. Dispose of the removed material away from the field to prevent re-infestation.
    *   **Pre-emergent control:** **Pendimethalin** (as mentioned above) can offer some suppression of germinating *Cuscuta* seeds if applied before their emergence.
    *   **Post-emergent (directed spray):** In severe infestations, a very careful, directed spray of **Glyphosate** (as mentioned above) can be used on the Amarbail strands, ensuring minimal to no contact with the *Eucalyptus* plant. This method is risky and should only be performed by experienced personnel.

*   **Orobanche:**
    *   This is not known to affect *Eucalyptus*. *Orobanche* species are typically root parasites of herbaceous dicotyledonous crops and are not reported to parasitize *Eucalyptus* trees.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and strictly follow the label instructions of the herbicide product carefully.
*   Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Calibrate spray equipment accurately to ensure the correct dosage is applied.
*   Avoid spraying during windy conditions to prevent herbicide drift onto non-target plants or *Eucalyptus* foliage.
*   Consult with local agricultural experts or HAU scientists for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and the age of your *Eucalyptus* plantation.
