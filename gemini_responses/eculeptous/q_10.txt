Based on scientific understanding, it is assumed that 'Eculeptous' refers to Eucalyptus.

Regarding the pests mentioned:

*   **Diamondback moth (*Plutella xylostella*)**: This is not known to affect Eucalyptus. Diamondback moth is a specific and major pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower, mustard).

For the control of Borers, Caterpillars, and Leaf folder in Eucalyptus, the following scientifically verified methods are recommended, using CIBRC approved technical chemicals:

**1. Borers (e.g., Stem Borers):**
Management of borers often involves a combination of cultural practices and chemical interventions, especially for young plantations or high-value trees.
*   **Cultural Practices:** Maintain tree health through proper nutrition and irrigation to enhance natural resistance. Remove and destroy heavily infested branches or trees to reduce pest inoculum.
*   **Chemical Control:** For stem borers, apply systemic insecticides as a drench around the base of the tree or as a swabbing on the trunk.
    *   **Chlorpyriphos** 20% EC at 2.5 ml/L of water for drenching or swabbing.
    *   **Fipronil** 5% SC at 1.5-2.0 ml/L of water as a soil drench.
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL at 0.5-0.7 ml/L of water as a soil drench for systemic action.

**2. Caterpillars and Leaf folder (General Defoliators):**
These lepidopteran pests can cause significant defoliation. Early detection and timely intervention are crucial.
*   **Biological Control:** Encourage natural enemies like parasitic wasps and predatory birds.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG at 0.2-0.4 g/L of water.
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC at 0.15-0.2 ml/L of water.
    *   **Flubendiamide** 20% WG at 0.2-0.3 g/L of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 0.5-0.75 ml/L of water.
    *   **Quinalphos** 25% EC at 2.0 ml/L of water.
    *   **Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki** (Bt) formulations at 1.0-2.0 g/L of water (ensure good coverage, especially on the underside of leaves).

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the label instructions of the pesticide product carefully before use.
*   Ensure proper safety measures, including wearing personal protective equipment (PPE), during pesticide application.
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension specialists for specific recommendations tailored to your exact situation and local pest pressure.
