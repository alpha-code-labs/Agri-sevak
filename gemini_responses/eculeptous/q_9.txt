Mites, including Red spider mite (e.g., *Tetranychus urticae*) and Rust mites (various *Eriophyidae* species), are known pests of Eucalyptus, particularly affecting young plants and those under stress. Effective management involves an integrated approach.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Mites in Eucalyptus:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Water Management:** Ensure adequate irrigation, as water-stressed plants are more susceptible to mite infestations.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Maintain balanced fertilization to promote plant vigour.
    *   **Pruning:** Remove heavily infested leaves or branches to reduce mite populations.
    *   **Weed Control:** Manage weeds around the plants, as they can host mites.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Conserve natural enemies like predatory mites (*Amblyseius* spp.), ladybird beetles, and lacewings, which can help keep mite populations in check. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

3.  **Chemical Control (Acaricides):**
    When mite populations are high and causing significant damage, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where mites often reside. Rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

    The following CIBRC-approved technical chemical names can be used:

    *   **Spiromesifen:** Apply at a concentration of 0.5 - 1.0 ml per litre of water. This acaricide is effective against all life stages of mites.
    *   **Fenpyroximate:** Use at a rate of 0.5 ml per litre of water. It provides good control against eggs, nymphs, and adults.
    *   **Propargite:** Apply at a concentration of 1.5 - 2.0 ml per litre of water. This is a contact acaricide effective against motile stages.
    *   **Abamectin:** Use at a rate of 0.3 - 0.5 ml per litre of water. It has translaminar action, providing good control of mites.

    **Important Considerations:**
    *   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label for specific dosages, application methods, and safety precautions.
    *   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and application.
    *   Avoid spraying during hot periods of the day to prevent phytotoxicity and ensure better efficacy.
    *   Monitor the plants regularly for mite re-infestation and reapply if necessary, adhering to the recommended spray interval.
