As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I am providing scientifically verified advice for the control of fungal diseases.

Assuming 'Eculeptous' is a typographical error for 'Eucalyptus', a common plantation tree in Haryana, the following advice is provided. If 'Eculeptous' refers to a different plant, please clarify, as disease susceptibility would vary significantly.

**General Cultural Practices for Fungal Disease Management in Eucalyptus:**

1.  **Use Disease-Free Planting Material:** Always source seedlings from reputable nurseries that guarantee disease-free stock.
2.  **Proper Spacing:** Maintain adequate spacing between trees to ensure good air circulation, which helps reduce humidity and leaf wetness, thereby discouraging fungal growth.
3.  **Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy infected leaves, twigs, and fallen debris from around the trees. Prune out any diseased branches promptly.
4.  **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure the trees receive balanced nutrients. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can promote lush, susceptible growth.
5.  **Water Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day, to minimize prolonged leaf wetness. Drip irrigation is preferable where feasible.

**Specific Control Measures for Fungal Diseases in Eucalyptus:**

### 1. Alternaria Leaf Spot (Caused by *Alternaria* species)

**Symptoms:** Small, dark, irregular spots on leaves, often with concentric rings, leading to premature defoliation in severe cases.

**Control Measures:**
*   Implement good cultural practices as mentioned above.
*   For chemical control, apply foliar sprays at the first sign of disease:
    *   **Mancozeb 75% WP:** 2-2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Chlorothalonil 75% WP:** 1.5-2 g/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:** 0.5-1 ml/L of water.
    *   **Propiconazole 25% EC:** 0.5-1 ml/L of water.

### 2. Anthracnose (Caused by *Colletotrichum* species)

**Symptoms:** Irregular, sunken lesions on leaves, twigs, and young shoots, often leading to dieback and canker formation.

**Control Measures:**
*   Prune and destroy infected branches.
*   For chemical control, apply foliar sprays:
    *   **Carbendazim 50% WP:** 0.5-1 g/L of water.
    *   **Mancozeb 75% WP:** 2-2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:** 0.5-1 ml/L of water.
    *   **Propiconazole 25% EC:** 0.5-1 ml/L of water.

### 3. Blast

This is not known to affect Eculeptous.

### 4. Blight (e.g., *Cylindrocladium* blight, *Botryosphaeria* blight)

**Symptoms:** Rapid necrosis of leaves, shoots, and young stems, often leading to extensive dieback and cankers. Can cause significant damage, especially in nurseries and young plantations.

**Control Measures:**
*   Remove and destroy all infected plant parts.
*   Ensure good air circulation and avoid overcrowding.
*   For chemical control, apply foliar sprays:
    *   **Carbendazim 50% WP:** 0.5-1 g/L of water.
    *   **Thiophanate methyl 70% WP:** 0.5-1 g/L of water.
    *   **Propiconazole 25% EC:** 0.5-1 ml/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:** 0.5-1 ml/L of water.

### 5. Brown Spot (Caused by various fungi like *Mycosphaerella* species)

**Symptoms:** Brown, circular to irregular spots on leaves, often with a purplish margin, leading to defoliation in severe cases.

**Control Measures:**
*   Implement good cultural practices.
*   For chemical control, apply foliar sprays:
    *   **Mancozeb 75% WP:** 2-2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Chlorothalonil 75% WP:** 1.5-2 g/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:** 0.5-1 ml/L of water.
    *   **Propiconazole 25% EC:** 0.5-1 ml/L of water.

### 6. Downy Mildew

This is not known to affect Eculeptous.

### 7. Powdery Mildew (Caused by *Erysiphe* species)

**Symptoms:** White, powdery patches on the surface of leaves, young shoots, and sometimes flowers, leading to distortion, reduced growth, and premature leaf drop.

**Control Measures:**
*   Ensure good air circulation and avoid overcrowding.
*   For chemical control, apply foliar sprays:
    *   **Sulphur 80% WP:** 2-3 g/L of water.
    *   **Myclobutanil 10% WP:** 0.5-1 g/L of water.
    *   **Hexaconazole 5% EC:** 1-2 ml/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:** 0.5-1 ml/L of water.
    *   **Propiconazole 25% EC:** 0.5-1 ml/L of water.

### 8. Grey Mildew

This is not known to affect Eculeptous.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the fungicide label for specific dosage, application timing, and safety precautions.
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in fungal pathogens.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension services for specific recommendations tailored to your region and current disease pressure.
