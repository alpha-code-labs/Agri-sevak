As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand you are seeking recommendations for organic manure application in *Eucalyptus* (assuming "Eculeptous" is a typographical error for *Eucalyptus*).

For optimal growth and soil health in *Eucalyptus* plantations in Haryana, the following organic manure doses are recommended:

*   **Farm Yard Manure (FYM):**
    *   Apply **10-15 kg** of well-decomposed FYM per plant per year.
    *   This should be incorporated into the soil around the base of the plant, preferably before the monsoon season or during planting. For established trees, application can be done annually or biennially.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   Apply **2-5 kg** of vermicompost per plant per year.
    *   Vermicompost can be applied in split doses, once during planting and then annually, mixed into the soil around the root zone.

*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract based bio-stimulant):**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Mix **2.5-5 ml** of Sagarika per litre of water and spray thoroughly on the foliage.
    *   **Soil Drench/Drip Application:** Apply **1-2 litres** per acre, or **5-10 ml** per plant for young plants, mixed with irrigation water.
    *   Apply 2-3 times during the active growth period, typically at intervals of 20-30 days.

**Important Considerations:**
*   These are general recommendations. For precise nutrient management, it is always advisable to conduct a soil test to determine the specific nutrient status of your field.
*   Ensure the organic manures are well-decomposed to avoid nutrient immobilization and pest issues.
*   The timing of application, especially for FYM and vermicompost, should ideally coincide with the onset of the monsoon or during irrigation to facilitate nutrient uptake.
