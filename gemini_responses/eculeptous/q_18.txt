It appears there might be a slight misspelling, and you are likely referring to *Eucalyptus*. Based on current scientific recommendations for *Eucalyptus* cultivation in Haryana, here is the advice regarding the substances you mentioned:

**For Ethephon (Ethrel):**
**Ethephon** is a plant growth regulator primarily used for promoting ripening, flowering, or abscission in various crops. Its use as a general growth regulator or hormone for enhancing growth or yield in *Eucalyptus* plantations in Haryana is **not a standard or recommended practice**. Therefore, specific dosage recommendations for this purpose are not available or advised for *Eucalyptus* in field conditions.

**For 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D):**
**2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid** is primarily known as a selective herbicide. While it is a synthetic auxin and can act as a growth regulator at extremely low concentrations, its application as a growth regulator for *Eucalyptus* in field conditions is **not a standard or recommended practice** in Haryana. Applying **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid** in field settings for growth regulation in *Eucalyptus* carries a high risk of phytotoxicity and damage, as the effective growth-regulating dose is very close to the herbicidal dose. Therefore, specific dosage recommendations for this purpose are not available or advised for *Eucalyptus* in field conditions.

**For Boron:**
Boron is an essential micronutrient for *Eucalyptus* growth. Deficiency can lead to symptoms such as stunted growth, dieback, and malformed leaves. Boron application is recommended in soils where deficiency is known or suspected.

*   **Foliar Application (for preventing or correcting mild Boron deficiency):**
    *   **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (e.g., Solubor): 1.0 - 1.5 g/L of water.
    *   Apply as a foliar spray, ensuring good coverage, preferably in the morning or late afternoon. Repeat if necessary based on deficiency symptoms and soil test results.

*   **Soil Application (for correcting moderate to severe Boron deficiency, based on soil test recommendations):**
    *   **Borax (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate)**: 5 - 10 kg/acre, applied uniformly around the base of the trees or incorporated into the soil before planting.
    *   The exact dose should be determined based on soil test reports and the severity of the deficiency.

**Important Note:** Always conduct a soil test to determine the nutrient status before applying any micronutrients. Over-application of Boron can be toxic to plants.
