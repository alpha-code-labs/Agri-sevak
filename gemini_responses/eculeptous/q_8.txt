Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide guidance on pest management.

Regarding "Eculeptous," I will assume this refers to **Eucalyptus**, a commonly planted tree species in Haryana.

Let's address the specific sucking pests you mentioned:

*   **Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips:** While some generalist species of these pests might occasionally be observed on Eucalyptus, they are generally not known to cause significant economic damage or warrant specific control measures in Haryana. Therefore, for these specific pests on Eucalyptus, this is not known to affect Eculeptous significantly enough to require intervention.

*   **Psylla (Psyllids):** This is a significant group of sucking pests that can cause considerable damage to Eucalyptus, particularly species like the Red Gum Lerp Psyllid (*Glycaspis brimblecombei*). Psyllids feed on sap, leading to defoliation, reduced growth, and in severe cases, tree mortality. They produce characteristic white, waxy lerps (protective covers) on leaves.

Here's how to control Psyllids in Eucalyptus:

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Psyllids:**

1.  **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect Eucalyptus trees, especially young foliage, for the presence of psyllids, lerps, and sticky honeydew. Early detection is crucial for effective management.

2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Maintain Tree Health:** Ensure trees are well-watered and fertilized appropriately to improve their natural resilience to pest attacks.
    *   **Pruning:** Remove heavily infested branches if practical, especially in smaller plantations or nurseries, to reduce pest populations.
    *   **Species Selection:** Where possible, consider planting Eucalyptus species or provenances that show resistance or tolerance to psyllid infestations.

3.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Natural enemies play a vital role in controlling psyllid populations. Encourage beneficial insects such as parasitic wasps (*Psyllaephagus* species are highly effective specific parasitoids), ladybird beetles, lacewings, and hoverflies, which prey on psyllids. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that can harm these beneficial insects.

4.  **Chemical Control (Only when necessary and as a last resort):**
    If psyllid populations are high and causing significant damage, chemical intervention may be required. Always follow label instructions and safety precautions.

    *   **Foliar Spray:**
        *   **Imidacloprid** (17.8% SL formulation): 0.5 - 1.0 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Thiamethoxam** (25% WG formulation): 0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water.
        *   **Acetamiprid** (20% SP formulation): 0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water.

    *   **Soil Drench/Trunk Injection (for larger trees, consult an expert):**
        Systemic insecticides can be applied as a soil drench around the base of the tree or via trunk injection for long-term control, especially in urban settings or for high-value trees. This method minimizes impact on beneficial insects.
        *   **Imidacloprid** (17.8% SL formulation): Dosage varies significantly with tree size (trunk diameter). Consult specific product recommendations or an expert for precise application rates (e.g., 1-2 ml per cm of trunk diameter, diluted in water).

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Rotation of Chemicals:** To prevent the development of insecticide resistance, rotate the use of insecticides with different modes of action.
*   **Timing of Application:** Apply insecticides when psyllid nymphs are active and vulnerable, typically when new flushes of growth appear.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   **Environmental Impact:** Be mindful of the potential impact on non-target organisms and the environment. Prioritize IPM strategies.

For specific recommendations tailored to your exact location and Eucalyptus species, it is always advisable to consult with the local agricultural extension office or HAU experts.
