As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I must inform you that 'Eculeptous' is not a recognized plant genus or species in agricultural science. Therefore, specific recommendations for improving its yield, fruit quality, and storage life cannot be provided, as these attributes are not known for 'Eculeptous'.
