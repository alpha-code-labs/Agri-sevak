As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I must provide scientifically verified advice.

"Eculeptous" is not a recognized botanical name or common name for any known plant species in agricultural science. Therefore, I cannot provide specific recommendations for its ideal transplantation time, distance, or process.
