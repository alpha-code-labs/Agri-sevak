As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I must provide scientifically verified advice.

Regarding "Eculeptous," this is not a recognized plant species or agricultural crop known to HAU or in scientific literature. Therefore, I cannot provide information on its maturity signs, harvesting time, or cutting process.

This is not known to affect Eculeptous.
