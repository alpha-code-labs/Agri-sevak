Mites, including Red spider mite (Tetranychus urticae) and various Rust mites (Eriophyidae family), are significant pests of Bhindi (Okra) in Haryana, especially during dry and warm weather conditions. They cause damage by sucking sap from the leaves, leading to yellowing, bronzing, leaf distortion, and reduced plant vigour and yield.

Effective control involves an integrated approach:

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Regular Monitoring:** Inspect plants frequently, especially the undersides of leaves, for early signs of mites.
*   **Proper Irrigation:** Maintain adequate soil moisture. Mites thrive in dry, dusty conditions. Overhead irrigation can help dislodge mites and increase humidity, which is unfavourable for them.
*   **Weed Management:** Remove weeds from around the Bhindi field as they can serve as alternate hosts for mites.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy severely infested plant parts or entire plants to reduce the pest population.

**2. Biological Control:**
*   Encourage natural enemies such as predatory mites (e.g., Amblyseius spp.), lacewings, and ladybird beetles, which feed on pest mites. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

**3. Chemical Control (Acaricides/Miticides):**
When mite populations are high and causing economic damage, chemical control may be necessary. Always rotate different classes of chemicals to prevent the development of resistance. Ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where mites reside.

The following CIBRC approved technical chemicals can be used:

*   **Spiromesifen** (22.9% SC): Apply at 0.5 - 0.6 ml per litre of water (or 100 - 125 ml per acre).
*   **Propargite** (57% EC): Apply at 1.5 - 2.0 ml per litre of water (or 300 - 400 ml per acre).
*   **Fenpyroximate** (5% EC): Apply at 1.0 - 1.5 ml per litre of water (or 200 - 300 ml per acre).
*   **Wettable Sulphur** (80% WP): Apply at 2.5 - 3.0 grams per litre of water (or 500 - 600 grams per acre). This is particularly effective against rust mites and also helps control powdery mildew.
*   **Fenazaquin** (10% EC): Apply at 1.0 - 1.5 ml per litre of water (or 200 - 300 ml per acre).

**General Application Guidelines:**
*   Use a spray volume of 200-250 litres of water per acre for thorough coverage.
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label for specific dosage, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying.
