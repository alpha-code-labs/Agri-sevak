As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following fertilizer doses for Bhindi (Okra) in Haryana. Please note that these are general guidelines, and a soil test is always recommended for precise nutrient management.

**Overall Nutrient Requirement (per acre):**
*   Nitrogen (N): 80-100 kg
*   Phosphorus (P2O5): 40-60 kg
*   Potassium (K2O): 40-50 kg
*   Sulphur (S): 10-20 kg

---

**Recommended Fertilizer Schedule:**

**1. Basal Application (at the time of sowing):**
*   **DAP (Diammonium Phosphate):** 100-120 kg/acre
*   **Muriate of Potash (MOP):** 60-80 kg/acre
*   **Urea:** 20-30 kg/acre
*   **Elemental Sulphur (90%):** 10-15 kg/acre (if not using SSP or SOP)

**2. First Top Dressing (30-45 days after sowing):**
*   **Urea:** 60-70 kg/acre

**3. Second Top Dressing (60-75 days after sowing, at flowering/early fruiting stage, if crop vigor is low or yield potential is high):**
*   **Urea:** 40-50 kg/acre

**Nano Fertilizers (as supplementary foliar applications):**

*   **Nano-Urea (Liquid):**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** 2-4 ml/L of water. Apply 2-3 sprays starting from 30-45 days after sowing at 15-20 day intervals. Typically, 250-500 ml per acre per spray mixed in 100-200 L of water.
    *   *Note: Nano-Urea supplements conventional Urea and can reduce its requirement, but does not fully replace basal granular Urea.*

*   **Nano-DAP (Liquid):**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** 2-4 ml/L of water. Apply 2 sprays, one at the pre-flowering stage and another at the pod development stage. Typically, 250-500 ml per acre per spray mixed in 100-200 L of water.
    *   *Note: Nano-DAP supplements conventional DAP and can enhance phosphorus uptake, but does not fully replace basal granular DAP.*

**Alternative/Supplementary Fertilizers:**

*   **NPK (Complex Fertilizers):**
    *   If using complex NPK fertilizers (e.g., 12:32:16, 10:26:26), adjust the doses of **DAP**, **Urea**, and **Muriate of Potash** accordingly. For instance, 150-200 kg/acre of **NPK (12:32:16)** can be applied as a basal dose, followed by **Urea** top dressings as required to meet the total N demand.

*   **SSP (Single Super Phosphate):**
    *   If **DAP** is not used, **SSP** can be applied as a basal dose to meet Phosphorus and Sulphur requirements.
    *   **Basal Application:** 250-375 kg/acre. If using **SSP**, reduce or omit separate **Elemental Sulphur** application.

*   **Potash (Sulphate of Potash - SOP):**
    *   If **Muriate of Potash** is not preferred, **Sulphate of Potash** can be used as a basal dose.
    *   **Basal Application:** 80-100 kg/acre. If using **SOP**, reduce or omit separate **Elemental Sulphur** application.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Soil Testing:** Always conduct a soil test to determine the exact nutrient status of your field and tailor fertilizer recommendations for optimal results and to avoid nutrient imbalances.
*   **Application Method:** Granular fertilizers should be broadcast uniformly and incorporated into the soil before sowing or applied as band placement. Foliar sprays should be done in the morning or late afternoon for best absorption.
*   **Water Management:** Ensure adequate soil moisture for efficient nutrient uptake.
*   **Crop Stage:** Adjust top-dressing timings based on crop growth and visual nutrient deficiency symptoms.
