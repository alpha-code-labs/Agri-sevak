As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I emphasize that accurate diagnosis through soil testing and plant tissue analysis is paramount before applying any micronutrients. Visual symptoms can be misleading. The following recommendations are based on scientific research and are generally applicable for Bhindi (Okra) cultivation in Haryana.

All the listed micronutrient deficiencies (Zinc, Iron/Ferrous, Boron, Calcium, Magnesium, and Manganese) are known to affect Bhindi and can significantly impact its growth, yield, and quality.

Here's how to address these deficiencies:

### General Recommendations for Micronutrient Application:

*   **Soil Application:** Best done before sowing or planting, incorporated into the soil.
*   **Foliar Application:** Effective for quick correction of deficiencies, especially when soil conditions limit nutrient uptake (e.g., high pH). Apply during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to prevent leaf scorching. Ensure thorough coverage of foliage.
*   **Water Quality:** Use clean water for preparing spray solutions.
*   **Adjuvants:** Adding a good quality non-ionic spreader/sticker to foliar sprays can improve efficacy.

### Specific Micronutrient Deficiencies and Their Management:

1.  **Zinc (Zn) Deficiency:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** (21% Zn) at 10-25 kg/acre or **Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate** (33% Zn) at 5-10 kg/acre, once before sowing/planting.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Spray 0.5% solution of **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** (5 g/L of water) along with 0.25% lime (2.5 g/L of water) to neutralize acidity. Apply 2-3 sprays at 15-day intervals, starting 30-45 days after sowing.

2.  **Iron (Fe) / Ferrous Deficiency:**
    *   **Soil Application:** In severe cases, **Ferrous Sulphate** can be applied at 10-20 kg/acre, but its effectiveness in alkaline soils is often limited due to rapid fixation.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Spray 0.5-1.0% solution of **Ferrous Sulphate** (5-10 g/L of water) along with 0.25% lime (2.5 g/L of water). Alternatively, use **Iron EDTA** at 0.1% solution (1 g/L of water). Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, targeting young leaves.

3.  **Boron (B) Deficiency:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Borax** (Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate) at 2-4 kg/acre, once before sowing/planting.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Spray 0.1-0.2% solution of **Borax** (1-2 g/L of water) or 0.1% solution of **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (1 g/L of water). Apply 2 sprays: one at the pre-flowering stage and another during early fruit development.

4.  **Calcium (Ca) Deficiency:**
    *   **Soil Application:** If soil test indicates severe deficiency, **Calcium Nitrate** can be applied at 10-20 kg/acre.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Spray 0.5-1.0% solution of **Calcium Nitrate** (5-10 g/L of water) or 0.5% solution of **Calcium Chloride** (5 g/L of water). Apply 2-3 sprays during the fruit development stage.

5.  **Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Magnesium Sulphate** at 10-20 kg/acre.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Spray 0.5-1.0% solution of **Magnesium Sulphate** (5-10 g/L of water). Apply 2-3 sprays at 15-day intervals, especially targeting older leaves showing symptoms.

6.  **Manganese (Mn) Deficiency:**
    *   **Soil Application:** **Manganese Sulphate** can be applied at 10-15 kg/acre, but foliar application is generally more effective in alkaline soils.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Spray 0.5% solution of **Manganese Sulphate** (5 g/L of water) along with 0.25% lime (2.5 g/L of water). Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, targeting young leaves.

### Important Considerations:

*   **Soil pH Management:** Many micronutrient deficiencies are exacerbated by high soil pH (alkaline conditions prevalent in Haryana). Maintaining optimal soil pH (6.0-7.0) through practices like adding organic matter and judicious use of fertilizers can significantly improve micronutrient availability.
*   **Organic Matter:** Regular incorporation of farmyard manure (FYM) or compost improves soil structure, water retention, and the availability of micronutrients.
*   **Chelated Micronutrients:** For foliar application, chelated forms of micronutrients (e.g., Zinc EDTA, Iron EDTA) are often more efficient and safer for plants, though they might be more expensive.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management:** Always integrate micronutrient application with balanced primary and secondary nutrient fertilization for overall plant health and productivity.
