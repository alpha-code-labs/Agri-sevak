As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the use of growth regulators and hormones in Bhindi (Okra) for Haryana conditions:

1.  **Ethrel (Ethephon):**
    *   **Ethephon** is not a standard growth regulator routinely recommended for general yield enhancement or growth promotion in Bhindi under typical Haryana farming practices. While research has explored its use for specific purposes like sex expression in some crops, it is not a common or recommended practice for farmers to apply **Ethephon** as a growth regulator for Bhindi.

2.  **2,4-D (2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid):**
    *   **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid** is primarily a selective herbicide. Its use as a growth regulator in Bhindi is **not recommended** under any circumstances due to its high phytotoxicity to broadleaf crops like Bhindi, even at very low concentrations. Applying **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid** to Bhindi will likely result in severe crop damage or death.

3.  **Boron:**
    *   Boron is an essential micronutrient crucial for pollen germination, fruit set, and overall plant development in Bhindi. Its deficiency can significantly reduce yield by causing flower drop and poor fruit development.
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   For optimal fruit set and to prevent flower drop, a foliar spray of **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate) is recommended.
        *   **Dose:** 1.0 - 2.0 g of **Borax** per liter of water (0.1% - 0.2% solution).
        *   **Timing:** Apply the first spray at the initiation of flowering and a second spray 10-15 days later during peak flowering and fruit setting. Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.
    *   **Soil Application (if severe deficiency is confirmed by soil test):**
        *   **Dose:** 1.0 - 2.0 kg of **Borax** per acre, mixed with soil at the time of land preparation or sowing. This should be done only if a soil test indicates a clear deficiency.
