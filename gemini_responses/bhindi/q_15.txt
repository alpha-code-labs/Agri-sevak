As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned conditions in Bhindi (Okra) in Haryana:

**1. Grasshopper:**
Grasshoppers are polyphagous pests that can cause significant defoliation in Bhindi by feeding on leaves and tender shoots.
*   **Cultural/Mechanical Control:**
    *   Regular weeding to remove alternate host plants and breeding sites.
    *   Hand-picking of nymphs and adults in early stages, especially in small plots.
    *   Deep ploughing after harvest can expose grasshopper eggs to predators and adverse weather conditions.
*   **Chemical Control (Spray application):**
    *   **Malathion 50% EC:** 2.0 - 3.0 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Quinalphos 25% EC:** 2.0 - 3.0 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** 0.4 - 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Fipronil 5% SC:** 0.8 - 1.2 ml per litre of water.

**2. Painted bug:**
This is not known to affect Bhindi. Painted bug (Bagrada hilaris) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops like mustard, cabbage, and radish, and is not typically found causing significant damage to Bhindi.

**3. Red cotton bug:**
Red cotton bug (Dysdercus cingulatus) can infest Bhindi, particularly during the pod development stage. They feed on developing pods and seeds, leading to reduced yield and quality.
*   **Cultural/Mechanical Control:**
    *   Regular monitoring and hand-picking of bugs and egg masses, especially in early infestation stages.
    *   Removal of alternate host plants, particularly wild malvaceous weeds, from around the Bhindi field.
*   **Chemical Control (Spray application):**
    *   **Malathion 50% EC:** 2.0 - 3.0 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Quinalphos 25% EC:** 2.0 - 3.0 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** 0.4 - 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC:** 2.0 - 2.5 ml per litre of water.

**4. Black ants:**
This is not known to affect Bhindi as a direct pest causing damage to the plant itself. Black ants are often associated with other sucking pests (like aphids, whiteflies, or mealybugs) for their honeydew secretions. They may also be present in the soil. If ants are observed protecting other pests, the primary focus should be on controlling the actual sucking pest, which will indirectly manage the ant population.

**Important Note:** Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully, including dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI). Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
