Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I will provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing these pests in Bhindi (Okra) in Haryana. It is crucial to adopt an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach for sustainable and effective control.

### General Management Practices for Bhindi Pests:

1.  **Field Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy affected plant parts, fallen fruits, and weeds which can harbor pests.
2.  **Resistant Varieties:** Where available, choose Bhindi varieties known to be tolerant or resistant to major pests.
3.  **Timely Sowing:** Adjust sowing time to avoid peak pest incidence periods.
4.  **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush growth attractive to pests.
5.  **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation to break the pest life cycle.
6.  **Monitoring:** Regularly scout your field to detect pest infestations early.

### Specific Pest Control Measures:

#### 1. Borers and Caterpillars (e.g., Bhindi Shoot and Fruit Borer - *Earias vittella, Earias insulana*; Tobacco Caterpillar - *Spodoptera litura*)

These are major lepidopteran pests in Bhindi. The larvae (caterpillars) bore into shoots and fruits, causing significant damage.

*   **Mechanical Control:**
    *   Collect and destroy infested shoots and fruits showing bore holes or wilting. This should be done regularly, especially in the early stages.
*   **Biological Control:**
    *   Utilize natural enemies like parasitoids and predators.
    *   Apply bio-pesticides based on **Bacillus thuringiensis** var. kurstaki (Bt) at 1-2 kg/acre or 2-4 g/L of water, especially effective against young larvae.
*   **Chemical Control (Rotate chemicals to prevent resistance):**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC: 60 ml/acre
    *   **Flubendiamide** 20% WG: 50 g/acre
    *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG: 80-100 g/acre
    *   **Indoxacarb** 14.5% SC: 200 ml/acre
    *   **Spinosad** 45% SC: 64 ml/acre
    *   **Novaluron** 10% EC: 300 ml/acre
    *   **Lufenuron** 5.4% EC: 240 ml/acre
    *   **Profenofos** 50% EC: 500 ml/acre
    *   **Quinalphos** 25% EC: 600 ml/acre
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: 100-120 ml/acre

#### 2. Diamondback Moth (*Plutella xylostella*)

This is not known to affect Bhindi. Diamondback moth is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops like cabbage, cauliflower, and mustard.

#### 3. Leaf Folder (General lepidopteran leaf damage)

While not a primary major pest in Bhindi, some generalist leaf folders or webworms can occasionally cause damage by folding or rolling leaves. The control measures are similar to those for borers and caterpillars.

*   **Mechanical Control:**
    *   Hand-pick and destroy folded leaves containing larvae.
*   **Biological Control:**
    *   Apply bio-pesticides based on **Bacillus thuringiensis** var. kurstaki (Bt) at 1-2 kg/acre or 2-4 g/L of water.
*   **Chemical Control (If infestation is significant):**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC: 60 ml/acre
    *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG: 80-100 g/acre
    *   **Indoxacarb** 14.5% SC: 200 ml/acre
    *   **Profenofos** 50% EC: 500 ml/acre

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always use the recommended quantity of water (typically 200-250 litres per acre for thorough coverage) when spraying.
*   Read the label of the pesticide carefully before use for specific instructions, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying.
*   Avoid spraying during flowering to protect pollinators, or spray in the late evening/early morning.
*   For precise recommendations based on your specific field conditions and pest pressure, please consult your local agricultural extension officer or the Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK).

Jai Kisan!
