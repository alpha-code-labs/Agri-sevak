Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I will provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling these pests in Bhindi (Okra).

Regarding your query:

**Ber fly (*Carpomyia vesuviana*)**
This is not known to affect Bhindi. The Ber fly is a specific pest of Ber (Ziziphus mauritiana) fruit.

**Fruit fly (*Bactrocera cucurbitae* and other species) in Bhindi**
Fruit flies are a significant pest of Bhindi, causing damage by laying eggs in young fruits, leading to rotting and unmarketable produce. An Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is crucial for effective control.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Fruit Fly in Bhindi:**

1.  **Cultural and Mechanical Methods:**
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Regularly collect and destroy all infested, fallen, or damaged fruits by burying them deep in the soil or burning them. This breaks the life cycle of the pest.
    *   **Deep Ploughing:** After harvest, deep ploughing exposes pupae in the soil to predators and harsh weather conditions.
    *   **Timely Sowing:** Adjusting sowing time can sometimes help avoid peak pest incidence.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid continuous cultivation of Bhindi or other cucurbit crops in the same field.

2.  **Monitoring and Mass Trapping:**
    *   **Pheromone Traps:** Install male annihilation traps (e.g., Methyl Eugenol traps for *Bactrocera dorsalis* or Cue-lure traps for *Bactrocera cucurbitae*) at a density of 10-15 traps per acre. These traps help monitor pest populations and can also reduce male populations, thereby reducing mating. Replace the lure every 2-3 weeks.

3.  **Chemical Control (Use only when necessary and as a last resort, following safety guidelines):**
    *   **Bait Sprays:** This is a highly effective method for fruit flies. Mix an insecticide with a protein source (like jaggery or protein hydrolysate) and spray it in small patches on the foliage, not on the entire crop. The flies are attracted to the bait and consume the insecticide.
        *   **Malathion** 50% EC: 20 ml per litre of water + 20 g jaggery or protein hydrolysate. Apply this mixture in small spots on leaves (e.g., 100 ml per spot) at 10-15 spots per acre, preferably in the morning.
        *   **Spinosad** 45% SC: 0.2 ml per litre of water + 20 g jaggery or protein hydrolysate. Apply as above.
    *   **Foliar Sprays (for severe infestations):**
        *   **Malathion** 50% EC: 1.0 - 1.5 litres per acre in 200-400 litres of water.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: 100 - 150 ml per acre in 200-400 litres of water.
        *   **Spinosad** 45% SC: 60 - 75 ml per acre in 200-400 litres of water.
        *   **Cyantraniliprole** 10.26% OD: 180 ml per acre in 200-400 litres of water.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read the label carefully before using any pesticide and follow the manufacturer's instructions.
*   Observe the recommended Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) to ensure the produce is safe for consumption.
*   Spray during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) while handling and spraying chemicals.
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
