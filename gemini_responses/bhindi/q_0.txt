Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I will provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Bhindi (Okra) in Haryana.

Here's how to control the specified fungal diseases:

1.  **Alternaria (Alternaria Leaf Spot)**
    This is a common fungal disease affecting Bhindi.
    *   Spray with:
        *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP at 2.5 g/L of water (or 2.5 kg/acre).
        *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC at 0.5 ml/L of water (or 200 ml/acre).
        *   **Propineb** 70% WP at 2.5 g/L of water (or 2.5 kg/acre).

2.  **Anthracnose**
    Anthracnose is a significant disease in Bhindi, affecting leaves, stems, and pods.
    *   Spray with:
        *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 0.5 g/L of water (or 200 g/acre).
        *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP at 2.5 g/L of water (or 2.5 kg/acre).
        *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC at 0.5 ml/L of water (or 200 ml/acre).

3.  **Blast**
    This is not known to affect Bhindi.

4.  **Blight (Cercospora Leaf Spot)**
    While "Blight" is a general term, in Bhindi, severe leaf spot infections like *Cercospora* leaf spot can cause blight-like symptoms.
    *   Spray with:
        *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 0.5 g/L of water (or 200 g/acre).
        *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP at 2.5 g/L of water (or 2.5 kg/acre).

5.  **Brown Spot**
    This often refers to *Cercospora* leaf spot or other minor leaf spots in Bhindi.
    *   Spray with:
        *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 0.5 g/L of water (or 200 g/acre).
        *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP at 2.5 g/L of water (or 2.5 kg/acre).

6.  **Downy Mildew**
    This is not known to affect Bhindi.

7.  **Powdery Mildew**
    Powdery mildew is a very common and significant disease of Bhindi, appearing as white powdery patches on leaves.

8.  **Grey Mildew**

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the chemical label for safe and effective use.
*   Ensure proper spray coverage for best results.
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
*   For best results, integrate chemical control with cultural practices like field sanitation, use of resistant varieties, and proper spacing.
