As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice on addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium) in Bhindi (Okra) in Haryana.

It is crucial to conduct a soil test before planting to accurately determine the nutrient status of your field and tailor fertilizer recommendations. Visual symptoms can indicate a deficiency, but a soil test provides precise data for optimal management.

### General Recommendations for Macro-nutrient Deficiencies in Bhindi:

#### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** General yellowing (chlorosis) of older leaves, stunted plant growth, pale green foliage, and reduced fruit set.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Soil Application (Basal and Top Dressing):**
        *   Apply 20-30 kg Nitrogen per acre as a basal dose.
        *   Top dress with 20-30 kg Nitrogen per acre in 2-3 splits, starting 3-4 weeks after sowing and subsequent applications at 2-3 week intervals.
        *   Recommended chemicals:
            *   **Urea** (46% N): 45-65 kg/acre (basal or top dressing).
            *   **Calcium Ammonium Nitrate (CAN)** (25% N): 80-120 kg/acre (basal or top dressing).
    *   **Foliar Application (for quick correction of mild deficiency):**
        *   Spray a 1-2% solution of **Urea** (10-20 g/L of water) at weekly intervals until symptoms disappear. Ensure complete coverage of foliage.

#### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, dark green or purplish discoloration of leaves (especially older ones), poor root development, and delayed maturity.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Soil Application (Basal Dose):**
        *   Apply 20-25 kg P2O5 per acre as a basal dose, incorporated into the soil before planting.
        *   Recommended chemicals:
            *   **Di-Ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5): 45-55 kg/acre.
            *   **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5, 11% S): 125-155 kg/acre.
            *   **Monoammonium Phosphate (MAP)** (11% N, 52% P2O5): 38-48 kg/acre.
    *   **Foliar Application (for quick correction of mild deficiency):**
        *   Spray a 0.5-1% solution of **Monoammonium Phosphate (MAP)** (5-10 g/L of water) at weekly intervals.

#### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Yellowing and browning (scorching or necrosis) of leaf margins and tips, especially on older leaves. Plants may show weak stems, poor fruit development, and increased susceptibility to diseases.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Soil Application (Basal Dose):**
        *   Apply 20-25 kg K2O per acre as a basal dose, incorporated into the soil before planting.
        *   Recommended chemicals:
            *   **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** / **Potassium Chloride** (60% K2O): 35-40 kg/acre.
            *   **Sulphate of Potash (SOP)** / **Potassium Sulphate** (50% K2O, 18% S): 40-50 kg/acre.
    *   **Foliar Application (for quick correction of mild deficiency):**
        *   Spray a 0.5-1% solution of **Potassium Sulphate** or **Potassium Nitrate** (5-10 g/L of water) at weekly intervals.

### Important Considerations:

*   **Soil Testing:** Always prioritize soil testing to get precise recommendations for your specific field conditions.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management (INM):** Supplement chemical fertilizers with organic manures like Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost (10-15 tonnes/acre) to improve soil health and nutrient availability.
*   **Water Management:** Ensure adequate and timely irrigation, as proper soil moisture is essential for nutrient uptake by plants.
*   **Application Timing:** Apply fertilizers at appropriate growth stages for maximum efficacy.

Always follow the instructions on the product label for safe and effective use of any chemical.
