Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU), Hisar, I understand your concern regarding flower, fruit, and tinda (boll) dropping in Bhindi (Okra). This is a common physiological issue that can significantly reduce yield. The dropping is primarily due to various environmental stresses and nutritional imbalances rather than a specific disease or pest in most cases.

Here's a scientifically verified approach to control dropping in Bhindi:

**I. Understanding the Causes of Dropping:**

Before implementing control measures, it's crucial to understand the common reasons for dropping:

1.  **Environmental Stress:**
    *   **Temperature Extremes:** High temperatures (above 35-40°C) or sudden fluctuations can lead to pollen sterility and flower abortion.
    *   **Water Stress:** Both drought (insufficient moisture) and waterlogging (excessive moisture) are detrimental, especially during flowering and fruiting.
    *   **Humidity:** Very low or very high humidity can affect pollination and fruit set.
    *   **Strong Winds:** Can cause physical damage and increase transpiration stress.
2.  **Nutritional Deficiencies/Imbalances:**
    *   **Boron Deficiency:** Critical for pollen germination, pollen tube growth, and fruit set.
    *   **Calcium Deficiency:** Essential for cell wall integrity and fruit development.
    *   **Phosphorus and Potassium Deficiency:** Important for overall plant vigour and reproductive processes.
    *   **Excess Nitrogen:** Can promote excessive vegetative growth at the expense of reproductive development, leading to flower drop.
3.  **Poor Pollination:** Inadequate activity of pollinators or non-viable pollen.
4.  **Hormonal Imbalance:** Stress conditions can trigger the production of abscisic acid and ethylene, which promote abscission (dropping).
5.  **High Plant Density:** Competition for light, water, and nutrients among closely spaced plants.

**II. Control Measures:**

A multi-pronged approach combining good agronomic practices, balanced nutrition, and judicious use of plant growth regulators is most effective.

**A. Agronomic and Cultural Practices (Foundation for Control):**

1.  **Optimal Irrigation:** Maintain consistent soil moisture, especially during the critical flowering and fruiting stages. Irrigate regularly, but avoid waterlogging. Use drip irrigation if feasible for efficient water management.
2.  **Proper Plant Spacing:** Adhere to recommended plant spacing (e.g., 45-60 cm between rows and 15-20 cm between plants) to ensure adequate light penetration, air circulation, and reduce competition for resources.
3.  **Weed Management:** Keep the field free of weeds through timely weeding or appropriate herbicides to minimize competition for nutrients and water.
4.  **Mulching:** Apply organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves, crop residues) around the base of plants. This helps conserve soil moisture, moderate soil temperature, and suppress weeds.
5.  **Variety Selection:** Choose heat-tolerant and locally adapted Bhindi varieties recommended by HAU for Haryana conditions.
6.  **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation to improve soil health and reduce the build-up of soil-borne pests and diseases.

**B. Nutrient Management:**

1.  **Soil Testing:** It is paramount to conduct regular soil tests to determine the exact nutrient status of your field. This allows for precise and efficient fertilizer application.
2.  **Balanced Fertilization:**
    *   Ensure adequate supply of Phosphorus and Potassium as per soil test recommendations.
    *   Avoid excessive application of Nitrogen, especially during the flowering stage, as it can lead to lush vegetative growth at the expense of flower and fruit development.
    *   **Micronutrients:** Pay special attention to Boron and Calcium, which are crucial for reproductive success.
        *   If Boron deficiency is suspected or confirmed by soil/tissue analysis, apply **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate) at 10-15 kg/acre as a soil application before sowing, or foliar spray **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** at 1-1.5 g/L of water.
        *   If Calcium deficiency is suspected, a foliar spray of **Calcium nitrate** at 2-3 g/L of water can be beneficial.

**C. Chemical Control (Plant Growth Regulators - PGRs):**

Plant Growth Regulators can help manage hormonal imbalances that lead to dropping.

1.  **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA):** This is a widely used and CIBRC-approved plant growth regulator effective in reducing flower and fruit drop in Bhindi.
    *   Apply **Naphthalene Acetic Acid** (NAA) at a concentration of 10-20 ppm (parts per million). For most commercial formulations (e.g., 4.5% SL), this typically translates to approximately 0.2-0.4 ml/L of water.
    *   The first spray should be given at the initiation of flowering, and a second spray can be repeated after 10-15 days if the problem persists.
    *   **Always follow the specific instructions and dosage rates provided on the product label for the formulation you are using.**

By implementing these measures, you can significantly reduce flower, fruit, and tinda dropping in your Bhindi crop and achieve a healthier, more productive yield. For specific recommendations tailored to your farm, please consult with the agricultural extension services or scientists at HAU.
