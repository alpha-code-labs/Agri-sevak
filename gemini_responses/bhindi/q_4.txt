Wilt, including sudden wilting often referred to as Parawilt, is a significant problem in Bhindi (Okra) cultivation in Haryana, leading to substantial yield losses. The primary causes are fungal pathogens that infect the roots and vascular system.

**Causative Agents:**
The main pathogens responsible for wilt in Bhindi are:
*   *Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. vasinfectum* (causes Fusarium wilt)
*   *Rhizoctonia solani* (causes root rot and collar rot, leading to wilting)
*   *Pythium* spp. (causes damping-off and root rot, leading to wilting)

**Symptoms:**
*   Initial yellowing and drooping of lower leaves.
*   Gradual wilting of the entire plant, often starting from one side.
*   Stunted growth.
*   Browning or blackening of vascular tissues when the stem is cut open (especially for Fusarium wilt).
*   In cases of severe root/collar rot, sudden collapse and death of the plant (often termed Parawilt).

**Control Measures:**

An integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods is most effective for managing wilt in Bhindi.

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Plant varieties known to be resistant or tolerant to wilt. Consult with local HAU extension scientists for recommended varieties suitable for your region.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting Bhindi or other susceptible crops (like cotton, brinjal, tomato) in the same field for at least 3-4 years. Rotate with non-host crops like cereals (wheat, maize) or legumes (chickpea, lentil).
*   **Soil Solarization:** During hot summer months (May-June), plough the field, irrigate it, and cover it tightly with transparent polyethylene sheets (100-micron thickness) for 4-6 weeks. This raises soil temperature, killing many soil-borne pathogens.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plants immediately to prevent the spread of the disease.
*   **Proper Drainage:** Ensure good drainage in the field to avoid waterlogging, which favors root rot pathogens.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced fertilizers. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can make plants more susceptible.
*   **Avoid Root Injury:** Minimize root damage during intercultural operations, as wounds can serve as entry points for pathogens.

**2. Biological Control:**
*   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds with bio-control agents before sowing.
    *   **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum** (2.5-5 g/kg seed).
*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Mix **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum** (2.5 kg/acre) with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost. Keep the mixture moist for 7-10 days in a shaded place, then broadcast it evenly in the field before planting or at the time of sowing.

**3. Chemical Control:**

**A. Seed Treatment (Essential for prevention):**
Treating seeds before sowing provides early protection against soil-borne pathogens.
*   **Carbendazim 50% WP:** 2-3 g/kg seed.
*   **Thiophanate-methyl 70% WP:** 2-3 g/kg seed.
*   **Thiram 75% WS:** 2-3 g/kg seed (often used in combination with a systemic fungicide).
*   **Metalaxyl-M 35% WS:** 3-4 g/kg seed (effective against Pythium and other oomycetes causing damping-off/root rot).

**B. Soil Drenching (For standing crop, at early signs of disease):**
*   **Carbendazim 50% WP:** Drench the soil around the base of affected plants with a solution of 1-2 g/L water. Apply 200-500 ml solution per plant, depending on plant size.
*   **Thiophanate-methyl 70% WP:** Drench the soil around the base of affected plants with a solution of 1-2 g/L water.
*   **Copper Oxychloride 50% WP:** For collar rot symptoms, drench the soil around the plant base with a solution of 2-3 g/L water.
*   **Propamocarb hydrochloride 72.2% SL:** For root rot caused by oomycetes, drench the soil with a solution of 2-3 ml/L water.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) while handling and applying chemicals.
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

This comprehensive approach will help in effectively managing wilt and parawilt in Bhindi fields.
