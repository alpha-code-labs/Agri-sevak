As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach for effective and sustainable control of sucking pests in Bhindi (Okra).

**Regarding Psylla:**
This is not known to affect Bhindi as a primary or significant pest in Haryana or other major Bhindi growing regions. Therefore, specific control measures for Psylla on Bhindi are typically not required.

For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips, follow these guidelines:

**I. Monitoring and Early Detection:**
*   Regularly inspect Bhindi plants (at least twice a week), especially the undersides of leaves, tender shoots, and flowers, for the presence of pests and symptoms of damage.
*   Use yellow sticky traps (10-15 traps per acre) to monitor whitefly and leafhopper populations.

**II. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Plant varieties resistant to Yellow Vein Mosaic Virus (YVMV), as whiteflies are the primary vector for this devastating disease. HAU recommends varieties like Hisar Unnat, Hisar Naveen, and Pusa A-4.
*   **Timely Sowing:** Adjust sowing time to avoid peak pest incidence periods if possible.
*   **Weed Management:** Keep the field and surrounding areas free of weeds, which can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, as it can lead to lush growth that attracts sucking pests.
*   **Water Management:** Ensure proper irrigation to maintain plant vigor, as stressed plants are more susceptible.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation to break the pest cycle.
*   **Removal of Infected Plants:** Promptly remove and destroy YVMV-infected plants to reduce the source of inoculum and whitefly spread.

**III. Biological Control:**
*   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Protect and encourage natural predators like ladybird beetles, lacewings, syrphid fly larvae, and parasitic wasps, which feed on aphids, whiteflies, and leafhoppers. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.
*   **Biopesticides:**
    *   **Neem oil** (Azadirachtin 1500 ppm or 3000 ppm): Apply at 5 ml/L of water at early stages of infestation. It acts as an antifeedant and repellent.

**IV. Chemical Control (When Economic Threshold Level - ETL is reached):**
Apply insecticides only when pest populations reach ETLs (e.g., 5-10 aphids/leafhoppers per leaf, 5-10 whiteflies per leaf, 5-10 thrips per flower/shoot). Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

**Recommended CIBRC Approved Insecticides:**

*   **For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips:**
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: 0.5-1 ml/L of water (or 100-200 ml/acre)
    *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: 0.2-0.4 g/L of water (or 80-100 g/acre)
    *   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP: 0.2-0.4 g/L of water (or 80-100 g/acre)
    *   **Fipronil** 5% SC: 1.5-2 ml/L of water (or 300-400 ml/acre)
    *   **Spirotetramat** 150 OD: 0.75 ml/L of water (or 200-250 ml/acre)

*   **Primarily for Whiteflies (especially nymphs) and some effect on other sucking pests:**
    *   **Buprofezin** 25% SC: 1.25 ml/L of water (or 500 ml/acre)

*   **For Aphids and Whiteflies:**
    *   **Flonicamid** 50% WG: 0.3 g/L of water (or 150 g/acre)

**Important Considerations for Chemical Application:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the insecticide label carefully.
*   Use the recommended dosage and water volume for thorough coverage.
*   Spray during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   Ensure proper safety gear (gloves, mask, protective clothing) during mixing and spraying.
*   Observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) specified on the label before harvesting.
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.

By adopting this comprehensive IPM strategy, you can effectively manage sucking pests in Bhindi and ensure a healthy crop.
