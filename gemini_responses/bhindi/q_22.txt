As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following cultivation practices for Bhindi (Okra) in Haryana:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   Bhindi is typically direct-seeded.
    *   Sowing is done in rows to facilitate inter-cultivation, weeding, and harvesting.
    *   For better water management and drainage, especially in areas prone to waterlogging or for efficient irrigation, sowing on ridges can be beneficial.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   Seeds should be sown at a depth of 2-3 cm. Sowing too deep can hinder emergence, while too shallow can expose seeds to birds or lead to poor germination.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   **Row-to-Row:** 45-60 cm
    *   **Plant-to-Plant:** 15-30 cm
    *   *Note:* Closer spacing (e.g., 45x15 cm) is often preferred for early varieties or for spring/summer crops to achieve higher plant density and yield. Wider spacing (e.g., 60x30 cm) may be suitable for vigorous, long-duration varieties, especially during the rainy season.

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   **Rainy Season (Kharif):** 8-12 kg/acre
    *   **Spring/Summer Season (Zaid):** 15-20 kg/acre
    *   *Note:* The higher seed rate for the spring/summer season is recommended due to potential issues with germination under high temperatures and to ensure an optimal plant stand. Always use seeds from a reliable source with good germination percentage.
