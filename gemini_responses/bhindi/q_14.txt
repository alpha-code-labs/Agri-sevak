Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an integrated approach for managing soil pests like termites and nematodes in Bhindi (Okra) to ensure healthy crop growth and good yields.

### 1. Control of Termites (Dimag) in Bhindi

Termites can cause significant damage by feeding on roots and the base of the stem, leading to wilting and plant death.

**A. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Deep Plowing:** Conduct deep plowing during the hot summer months to expose termite colonies to sunlight and predators.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy all crop residues, stubbles, and woody debris from the field, as these serve as food sources for termites.
*   **Proper Irrigation:** Maintain adequate soil moisture, as termites prefer dry conditions.

**B. Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved):**
*   **Pre-sowing Soil Treatment:**
    *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC:** Apply 2.5-3.0 litres per acre. Mix the required quantity with 50-100 kg of sand and broadcast evenly over the field, then incorporate into the soil before sowing.
    *   **Fipronil 0.3% GR:** Apply 10-15 kg per acre at the time of sowing by broadcasting and light incorporation into the soil.
*   **For Standing Crop (if infestation is observed):**
    *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC:** Drench the soil around the base of affected plants with a solution of 2.5 ml per litre of water.

### 2. Control of Nematodes (Root-knot Nematodes - *Meloidogyne* spp.) in Bhindi

Root-knot nematodes cause characteristic galls or knots on the roots, leading to stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, and reduced yield.

**A. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate Bhindi with non-host crops such as cereals (wheat, maize, sorghum) for at least 2-3 years to break the nematode life cycle.
*   **Summer Solarization:** Cover moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks during the hot summer months. This raises soil temperature sufficiently to kill nematodes.
*   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or **Neem cake** (200-400 kg per acre) into the soil 2-3 weeks before sowing. Neem cake has natural nematicidal properties and improves soil health.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** If available, choose Bhindi varieties known to possess resistance or tolerance to root-knot nematodes.

**B. Biological Control:**
*   **Bio-nematicides:** Use formulations containing beneficial fungi like *Paecilomyces lilacinus* (also known as *Purpureocillium lilacinum*). Apply as a soil drench or mix with FYM and apply at 2-4 kg per acre before sowing or at early stages.

**C. Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved):**
*   **Pre-sowing/At Sowing Application:**
    *   **Carbosulfan 25% EC:** Apply 1.0-1.5 litres per acre as a soil drench or mix with irrigation water before sowing or at early stages of crop growth.
    *   **Fluensulfone 2% GR:** Apply 6-8 kg per acre at the time of sowing by broadcasting and light incorporation into the soil.
    *   **Fipronil 0.3% GR:** (As mentioned for termites, it also provides some control against nematodes). Apply 10-15 kg per acre at the time of sowing by broadcasting and light incorporation.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and strictly follow the instructions and safety precautions mentioned on the label of any pesticide.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, and protective clothing during handling and application of chemicals.
*   For specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions, please consult with your local agricultural extension officer.
