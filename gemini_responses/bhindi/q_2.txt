As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm the following regarding the rust diseases you have mentioned in Bhindi (Okra):

*   **Black Rust:** This is not known to affect Bhindi.
*   **Brown Rust:** This is not known to affect Bhindi.
*   **Yellow Rust:** This is not known to affect Bhindi.
*   **White Rust:** This is not known to affect Bhindi.
*   **Red Rust:** This is not known to affect Bhindi.

The primary rust disease affecting Bhindi is **Okra Rust**, caused by *Puccinia abelmoschi*. If you are observing rust-like symptoms on your Bhindi crop, it is most likely this specific rust. For its control, the following measures are recommended:

**Control Measures for Okra Rust (*Puccinia abelmoschi*) in Bhindi:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest to reduce inoculum for the next season.
    *   Practice crop rotation with non-host crops.
    *   Maintain proper plant spacing to ensure good air circulation, which helps reduce humidity and fungal spread.

2.  **Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
    *   Apply fungicides preventively or at the first sign of disease symptoms. Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.
    *   Recommended CIBRC approved technical chemicals include:
        *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2.0-2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5-3.0 g/L of water).
        *   **Propiconazole** (25% EC) at 200-250 ml/acre (or 0.5 ml/L of water).
        *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC) at 200 ml/acre (or 0.5 ml/L of water).
        *   **Pyraclostrobin** (20% WG) at 150-200 g/acre (or 0.4-0.5 g/L of water).

    *   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
    *   Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and pre-harvest interval (PHI) mentioned on the label.
