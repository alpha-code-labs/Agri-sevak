As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend the following doses of organic manures and bio-stimulants for Bhindi (Okra) cultivation in Haryana, based on scientific principles and local agricultural practices:

*   **Farm Yard Manure (FYM):**
    *   **Recommended Dose:** 15-20 tonnes per acre.
    *   **Application:** Apply uniformly and incorporate thoroughly into the soil at least 2-3 weeks before sowing. Ensure the FYM is well-decomposed to avoid nutrient immobilization and potential pest issues.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   **Recommended Dose:** 4-5 tonnes per acre.
    *   **Application:** Can be applied as a basal dose and incorporated into the soil before sowing, or as a top dressing during early growth stages. Vermicompost is richer in nutrients than FYM, allowing for effective results with a lower quantity.

*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract):**
    *   **Nature:** Please note that Sagarika is a seaweed extract, primarily functioning as a bio-stimulant and plant growth promoter, rather than a bulk organic manure like FYM or vermicompost. It enhances nutrient uptake, plant vigor, and stress tolerance.
    *   **Recommended Dose (Foliar Spray):** 2-3 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Application:**
        *   First spray: 20-25 days after sowing.
        *   Second spray: 15-20 days after the first spray (during flowering/fruiting initiation).
        *   Ensure complete coverage of the foliage.
    *   **Recommended Dose (Soil Application/Drench):** 500 ml per acre, mixed with irrigation water or applied as a drench around the root zone.
    *   **Application:** Can be applied at sowing or during early growth stages to stimulate root development.

For precise recommendations, it is always advisable to conduct a soil test to understand the specific nutrient status of your field.
