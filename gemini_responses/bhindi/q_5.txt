As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm the following regarding the conditions you've mentioned for Bhindi (Okra):

*   **Scab:** This is not known to affect Bhindi in a significant way that requires specific control measures. Scab diseases are primarily associated with other crops like potato, apple, or cucumber.
*   **Canker:** This is not known to affect Bhindi. Canker is typically a disease of woody stems and branches in trees and shrubs, not herbaceous plants like Bhindi.
*   **Gummosis:** This is not known to affect Bhindi. Gummosis is a physiological condition characterized by the exudation of gum, primarily observed in fruit trees (e.g., citrus, stone fruits) in response to stress, injury, or disease.
*   **Lichen:** This is not known to affect Bhindi as a pest or disease. Lichens are non-parasitic organisms that grow on surfaces like tree bark or rocks and do not cause harm to plants. They are not a concern for Bhindi cultivation.
