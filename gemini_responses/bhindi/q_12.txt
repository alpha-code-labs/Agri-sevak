Namaste, Kisan Bhaiyon! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I understand your concern regarding Scale insects and Mealybugs in Bhindi (Okra). Both these pests are significant sucking pests that can cause considerable damage by feeding on plant sap, leading to stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, and reduced yield. They also excrete honeydew, which promotes sooty mould growth, further hindering photosynthesis.

Here's a scientifically verified approach for their control:

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategy:**

A combination of cultural, mechanical, and chemical methods is most effective for managing these pests.

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   **Regular Monitoring:** Frequently inspect your Bhindi plants, especially the undersides of leaves, stems, and growing points, for early signs of infestation.
*   **Pruning Infested Parts:** If the infestation is localized, carefully prune and destroy heavily infested leaves, stems, or branches to prevent further spread.
*   **Water Jet:** For mild mealybug infestations, a strong jet of water can dislodge them from the plants. This is less effective for scale insects.
*   **Weed Management:** Keep the field free of weeds, as many weeds can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
*   **Avoid Excessive Nitrogen:** High nitrogen fertilization can lead to lush, soft growth that is more attractive to sucking pests. Maintain balanced nutrient application.

**2. Biological Control:**
*   Encourage natural enemies like ladybird beetles, lacewings, and parasitic wasps, which prey on or parasitize mealybugs and scale insects. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

**3. Chemical Control (When infestation is severe):**
When cultural and biological methods are insufficient, or the infestation is widespread and severe, chemical intervention becomes necessary. Always ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and stems where these pests tend to hide.

Here are some CIBRC approved technical chemicals effective against Scale insects and Mealybugs in Bhindi:

*   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** This is an insect growth regulator that primarily affects the nymphal stages by inhibiting chitin synthesis, leading to their death during moulting.
    *   **Dosage:** 1.25 - 1.5 ml per litre of water (or 500 - 600 ml per acre).
*   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:** This is a systemic insecticide with two-way movement (xylem and phloem), providing excellent control of sucking pests, including scales and mealybugs, even in hidden parts of the plant.
    *   **Dosage:** 0.75 - 1 ml per litre of water (or 200 - 250 ml per acre).
*   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** A systemic neonicotinoid insecticide effective against a wide range of sucking pests.
    *   **Dosage:** 0.5 - 1 ml per litre of water (or 100 - 125 ml per acre).

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Rotation of Chemicals:** To prevent the development of pesticide resistance, rotate insecticides with different modes of action.
*   **Safety Precautions:** Always wear protective clothing (gloves, mask, goggles) while handling and spraying chemicals.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Observe the recommended pre-harvest interval for each chemical to ensure the produce is safe for consumption.
*   **Spray Timing:** Spray during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
