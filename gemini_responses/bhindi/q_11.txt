As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, here is the scientifically verified advice for controlling Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies in Bhindi (Okra) in Haryana:

**General Approach:**
Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is crucial for sustainable pest control. This involves a combination of cultural practices, regular monitoring, and judicious use of chemical interventions when necessary.

**1. Beetles (e.g., Flea Beetles, Red Pumpkin Beetle):**
Flea beetles (e.g., *Podagrica* spp.) and the Red Pumpkin Beetle (*Aulacophora foveicollis*) are common pests of Bhindi, especially during the seedling stage. They cause characteristic shot-hole damage to leaves or defoliation.

**Control Measures:**
*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Regular field monitoring, especially during the seedling stage.
    *   Maintain field sanitation to remove alternate hosts.
    *   Timely sowing to avoid peak pest periods.
*   **Chemical Control (when pest incidence is high, especially on young plants):**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** 125-150 ml per acre (diluted in 200-400 L of water).
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** 40-50 g per acre (diluted in 200-400 L of water).
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** 100-125 ml per acre (diluted in 200-400 L of water).

**2. Weevils (e.g., Shoot Weevil, Pod Weevil):**
Weevils like the Shoot Weevil (*Alcidodes affaber*) and Pod Weevil (*Pempherulus affinis*) are significant pests of Bhindi. They bore into shoots, stems, and pods, causing wilting, stunted growth, and damage to the fruits.

**Control Measures:**
*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Regular monitoring for wilting shoots or damaged pods.
    *   Remove and destroy infested plant parts (shoots, pods) to break the pest cycle.
    *   Deep ploughing after harvest to expose pupae.
*   **Chemical Control (when pest incidence is observed):**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** 60 ml per acre (diluted in 200-400 L of water).
    *   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG:** 80-100 g per acre (diluted in 200-400 L of water).
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** 100-125 ml per acre (diluted in 200-400 L of water).

**3. Sawflies:**
This is not known to affect Bhindi as a significant pest requiring specific control measures.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully.
*   Ensure proper spray coverage for effective control.
*   Observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) for all pesticides to ensure food safety.
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension services for the most current and specific recommendations for your region.
