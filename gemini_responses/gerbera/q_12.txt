Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding Scale insects and Mealybugs in Gerbera. These sap-sucking pests can significantly impact plant health and flower quality if not managed effectively. Here's a scientifically verified approach for their control:

An integrated pest management (IPM) strategy is crucial for effective and sustainable control of scale insects and mealybugs in Gerbera.

**1. Monitoring and Sanitation:**
*   **Regular Inspection:** Frequently inspect your Gerbera plants, especially the undersides of leaves, leaf axils, stems, and where leaves meet the stem. Early detection is key.
*   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy heavily infested leaves, stems, or flowers immediately. This reduces the pest population and prevents further spread.
*   **Weed Control:** Keep the area around Gerbera plants free of weeds, as they can harbor these pests.
*   **Quarantine:** Isolate new plants before introducing them to your main growing area to prevent bringing in pests.

**2. Mechanical Control:**
*   **Water Spray:** For light infestations, a strong jet of water can dislodge mealybugs and scale crawlers from the plants. Repeat this every few days.
*   **Manual Removal:** For small infestations, mealybugs can be dabbed with a cotton swab dipped in rubbing alcohol (ensure to test on a small area first to avoid phytotoxicity). Scales can be gently scraped off.

**3. Biological Control:**
*   Encourage natural enemies such as ladybird beetles (e.g., *Cryptolaemus montrouzieri* for mealybugs), lacewings, and parasitic wasps. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

**4. Chemical Control (Use only if necessary and with caution):**
When chemical intervention is required, especially for moderate to severe infestations, choose CIBRC-approved insecticides. Rotate chemicals with different modes of action to prevent resistance development. Ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and in crevices where these pests hide.

**For Scale Insects and Mealybugs, consider the following CIBRC-approved technical chemicals:**

*   **Systemic Insecticides (effective as pests feed on plant sap):**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** 0.5 - 1.0 ml per liter of water.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** 0.2 - 0.4 gram per liter of water.
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** 0.2 - 0.4 gram per liter of water.
    *   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:** 0.75 - 1.0 ml per liter of water. (Highly effective against both scales and mealybugs, with translaminar and systemic action).

*   **Insect Growth Regulators (IGRs) (disrupt pest development):**
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** 1.25 - 1.5 ml per liter of water. (Effective against nymphs/crawlers of both pests by inhibiting chitin synthesis).

*   **Horticultural Oils (smothering action):**
    *   **Horticultural Mineral Oil (HMO):** 10 - 20 ml per liter of water. (Apply during cooler parts of the day to avoid phytotoxicity. It works by suffocating the pests and their eggs. Ensure good coverage).

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Spray Technique:** Ensure complete coverage of the plant, especially the undersides of leaves and stem crevices where these pests hide.
*   **Rotation:** Rotate between different classes of insecticides (e.g., neonicotinoids, IGRs, lipid biosynthesis inhibitors) to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) like gloves, masks, and eye protection while handling and spraying chemicals. Follow the instructions on the product label strictly.
*   **Timing:** For scale insects, targeting the crawler stage (young, mobile scales) is most effective for contact insecticides. Systemic insecticides are effective against all feeding stages. For mealybugs, repeated applications might be necessary due to their waxy coating and overlapping generations.

By implementing these measures, you can effectively control scale insects and mealybugs and maintain healthy Gerbera plants.
