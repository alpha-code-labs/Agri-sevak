As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I emphasize the critical role of micronutrients for healthy Gerbera growth and optimal flowering. Before any application, it is crucial to conduct a soil test and, if possible, a plant tissue analysis to accurately diagnose the specific deficiency and its severity. Visual symptoms can sometimes be misleading.

Here's how to address common micronutrient deficiencies in Gerbera:

**General Recommendations for Micronutrient Application:**

*   **Diagnosis First:** Always confirm the deficiency through soil and/or plant tissue analysis.
*   **Foliar Application:** Often preferred for quick correction of deficiencies, especially for immobile nutrients or when soil conditions (like high pH) limit nutrient uptake. Apply during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to avoid leaf burn and maximize absorption.
*   **Soil Application:** Suitable for long-term maintenance and correcting severe deficiencies. Incorporate into the soil before planting or as a drench.
*   **Water Quality:** Ensure the pH of the spray solution is appropriate (usually slightly acidic to neutral) for optimal nutrient availability and absorption.
*   **Caution:** Over-application of micronutrients can be toxic. Always adhere to recommended rates.

### Addressing Specific Micronutrient Deficiencies in Gerbera:

#### 1. Zinc (Zn)

*   **Deficiency Symptoms:** Stunted growth, small and narrow leaves (often called "little leaf"), interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, and rosetting of leaves.
*   **Recommended Chemicals & Application:**
    *   **Foliar Spray:**
        *   **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** (21% Zn): 2.5-5 g/L of water.
        *   **Zinc EDTA** (12% Zn): 0.5-1 g/L of water.
    *   **Soil Application (Basal/Drench):**
        *   **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** (21% Zn): 10-25 kg/acre, mixed well into the soil before planting or as a drench.

#### 2. Iron (Fe) / Ferrous

*   **Deficiency Symptoms:** Pronounced interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, with veins remaining distinctly green. In severe cases, leaves may turn almost white. Gerbera is particularly susceptible to iron deficiency in alkaline soils, common in Haryana.
*   **Recommended Chemicals & Application:**
    *   **Foliar Spray:**
        *   **Ferrous Sulphate Heptahydrate** (19% Fe): 2.5-5 g/L of water.
        *   **Ferrous EDTA** (12% Fe): 0.5-1 g/L of water.
    *   **Soil Application (Basal/Drench):**
        *   **Ferrous Sulphate Heptahydrate** (19% Fe): 10-25 kg/acre, especially in severe cases or as a preventive measure in alkaline soils.
        *   **Ferrous EDTA** (12% Fe): More effective in alkaline soils for soil application, typically 2-5 kg/acre.

#### 3. Boron (B)

*   **Deficiency Symptoms:** Stunted growth, thickened and brittle leaves, cracking of stems, poor flower development, distorted or malformed flowers, and death of growing points.
*   **Recommended Chemicals & Application:**
    *   **Foliar Spray:**
        *   **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (20% B): 1-1.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Borax** (Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate, 10.5-11.3% B): 1.5-2 g/L of water.
    *   **Soil Application (Basal):**
        *   **Borax** (10.5% B): 4-8 kg/acre. *Caution: Boron can be toxic if over-applied. Apply only if deficiency is confirmed.*

#### 4. Calcium (Ca)

*   **Deficiency Symptoms:** Distorted or stunted young leaves, marginal necrosis (tip burn) on new leaves, poor root development, weak stems, and premature flower senescence.
*   **Recommended Chemicals & Application:**
    *   **Foliar Spray:**
        *   **Calcium Nitrate** (19% Ca): 2.5-5 g/L of water.
        *   **Calcium Chloride** (27-30% Ca): 2-3 g/L of water.
    *   **Soil Application (Fertigation/Drench):**
        *   **Calcium Nitrate** (19% Ca): Can be applied through fertigation at recommended rates based on crop stage and soil test. For drench, 10-20 kg/acre.
        *   **Gypsum** (Calcium Sulphate): For long-term soil amendment and improving soil structure, but slower for correcting immediate deficiencies.

#### 5. Magnesium (Mg)

*   **Deficiency Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, with veins remaining green. Leaves may become brittle and curl upwards.
*   **Recommended Chemicals & Application:**
    *   **Foliar Spray:**
        *   **Magnesium Sulphate Heptahydrate** (Epsom salt, 9.6% Mg): 2.5-5 g/L of water.
    *   **Soil Application (Basal/Drench):**
        *   **Magnesium Sulphate Heptahydrate** (9.6% Mg): 10-20 kg/acre, as a basal application or drench.

#### 6. Manganese (Mn)

*   **Deficiency Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, often with a finer network of green veins compared to iron deficiency. Stunted growth.
*   **Recommended Chemicals & Application:**
    *   **Foliar Spray:**
        *   **Manganese Sulphate Monohydrate** (30.5% Mn): 2.5-5 g/L of water.
        *   **Manganese EDTA** (12% Mn): 0.5-1 g/L of water.
    *   **Soil Application (Basal/Drench):**
        *   **Manganese Sulphate Monohydrate** (30.5% Mn): 10-20 kg/acre, especially in high pH soils where availability is low.

**Important Considerations for Haryana Conditions:**

*   **Alkaline Soils:** Many soils in Haryana are alkaline, which can reduce the availability of micronutrients like Iron, Zinc, and Manganese. Chelated forms (e.g., EDTA) are often more effective in such conditions.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management (INM):** Incorporate organic matter (farmyard manure, compost) into the soil to improve nutrient availability and soil health.
*   **Regular Monitoring:** Continuously monitor your Gerbera plants for any signs of deficiency or toxicity and adjust your nutrient management plan accordingly.

Always consult with your local agricultural extension office or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's soil conditions and Gerbera variety.
