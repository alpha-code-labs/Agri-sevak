As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend the following doses for organic manures in Gerbera cultivation, based on scientific principles and suitability for Haryana's conditions:

*   **Farmyard Manure (FYM):**
    *   **Dose:** 15-20 tonnes per acre.
    *   **Application:** Incorporate thoroughly into the soil during land preparation, at least 2-3 weeks before planting Gerbera saplings.
    *   **Note:** Ensure the FYM is well-decomposed (at least 3-6 months old) and free from weed seeds and pathogens to prevent issues in the field. Well-decomposed FYM improves soil structure, water holding capacity, and provides a slow release of macro and micronutrients.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   **Dose:** 3-5 tonnes per acre. Alternatively, 1-2 kg per square meter.
    *   **Application:** Can be applied basally during land preparation, or as a top-dressing around the plants in split doses during the growing season (e.g., 2-3 months after planting and then every 3-4 months).
    *   **Note:** Vermicompost is richer in nutrients than FYM and provides readily available nutrients, beneficial microbes, and growth-promoting substances, enhancing overall plant health and vigour.

*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract):**
    *   **Dose (Foliar Spray):** 2-3 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Dose (Soil Drench/Drip):** 1-2 litres per acre, diluted in sufficient water.
    *   **Application:**
        *   **Foliar Spray:** Start 3-4 weeks after planting and repeat every 15-20 days during active vegetative growth and flowering stages.
        *   **Soil Drench/Drip:** Apply at critical growth stages such as vegetative growth, bud initiation, and peak flowering.
    *   **Note:** Sagarika acts as a bio-stimulant, enhancing nutrient uptake, root development, stress tolerance, and overall plant vigour and productivity. It complements the bulk organic manures and should be used as part of an integrated nutrient management strategy.

These recommendations are for healthy plant growth and optimal flowering in Gerbera, forming a crucial part of an integrated nutrient management plan. Always ensure proper soil testing to fine-tune nutrient applications.
