Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the critical importance of balanced nutrition for optimal Gerbera cultivation. Macro-nutrient deficiencies can significantly impact plant health, yield, and flower quality. The following scientifically verified advice will help you address Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium deficiencies in Gerbera, keeping in mind CIBRC approved chemicals and metric units.

Before applying any fertilizers, it is highly recommended to conduct a comprehensive soil test. This will provide precise information on nutrient availability in your specific field and allow for tailored recommendations, preventing over-application and nutrient imbalances.

### Addressing Macro-nutrient Deficiencies in Gerbera

**1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency**

Nitrogen is vital for vegetative growth, chlorophyll production, and overall plant vigor.

*   **Symptoms:**
    *   General yellowing (chlorosis) of older leaves, starting from the tips and margins.
    *   Stunted growth with thin, weak stems.
    *   Pale green foliage.
    *   Reduced flower size and number.

*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application (for sustained supply):**
        *   Apply 50-100 kg/acre of **Urea** (46% N) in split doses during the active growth phase.
        *   Alternatively, 100-150 kg/acre of **Calcium Nitrate** (15.5% N) can be used, especially if calcium is also deficient.
        *   Or, 100-150 kg/acre of **Ammonium Sulphate** (20.6% N) can be applied, which also provides sulfur.
    *   **Foliar Spray (for quick correction):**
        *   Spray 5-10 g/L of **Urea** dissolved in water.
        *   Alternatively, 5-10 g/L of **Calcium Nitrate** or **Potassium Nitrate** (13% N, 45% K2O) can be used. Apply in the morning or late afternoon to avoid leaf scorching.

**2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency**

Phosphorus is crucial for root development, flowering, fruit set, and energy transfer within the plant.

*   **Symptoms:**
    *   Dark green or purplish discoloration of older leaves, particularly on the undersides.
    *   Stunted growth and poor root development.
    *   Delayed flowering and reduced flower quality.
    *   Leaves may appear stiff and upright.

*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application (primary method, as P is less mobile):**
        *   Apply 250-350 kg/acre of **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5) at the time of planting or as a basal application. This also provides sulfur.
        *   Alternatively, 50-100 kg/acre of **Di-Ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5) can be applied, which also supplies nitrogen.
        *   Or, 30-60 kg/acre of **Monoammonium Phosphate (MAP)** (12% N, 61% P2O5) can be used.
    *   **Foliar Spray (less effective for P, but can provide a temporary boost):**
        *   Spray 5-10 g/L of **Monoammonium Phosphate (MAP)** dissolved in water.

**3. Potassium (K) Deficiency**

Potassium (Potash) is essential for water regulation, disease resistance, flower quality, and overall plant vigor.

*   **Symptoms:**
    *   Yellowing and browning (scorching or necrosis) of leaf margins and tips, especially on older leaves.
    *   Weak stems and lodging.
    *   Reduced flower size, poor color, and shorter vase life.
    *   Increased susceptibility to diseases and stress.

*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application (for sustained supply):**
        *   Apply 50-100 kg/acre of **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** (Potassium Chloride, 60% K2O) in split doses.
        *   Alternatively, 60-120 kg/acre of **Sulphate of Potash (SOP)** (Potassium Sulphate, 50% K2O) can be used, especially in saline soils or where chloride sensitivity is a concern.
        *   Or, 50-100 kg/acre of **Potassium Nitrate** (13% N, 45% K2O) can be applied, which also provides nitrogen.
    *   **Foliar Spray (for quick correction):**
        *   Spray 5-10 g/L of **Potassium Nitrate** dissolved in water.
        *   Alternatively, 5-10 g/L of **Sulphate of Potash** dissolved in water. Apply in the morning or late afternoon.

**Important General Advice:**

*   **Soil Testing:** Always base your fertilizer application on a recent soil test report. HAU's soil testing labs can provide accurate analyses and recommendations.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management (INM):** Supplement chemical fertilizers with organic manures like well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or vermicompost. This improves soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability.
*   **Application Method:** For soil application, ensure fertilizers are incorporated into the root zone and followed by adequate irrigation.
*   **Timing:** Apply fertilizers at appropriate growth stages (e.g., vegetative growth, bud initiation, flowering) for maximum benefit.
*   **Watering:** Proper irrigation is crucial for nutrient uptake. Ensure consistent moisture without waterlogging.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively manage macro-nutrient deficiencies in your Gerbera crop and ensure healthy, productive plants. For specific field conditions or persistent issues, please consult with the experts at HAU.
