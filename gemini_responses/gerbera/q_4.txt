Wilt and Parawilt in Gerbera are serious conditions primarily caused by soil-borne fungal pathogens, most commonly *Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. gerberae*, but also *Phytophthora* species, *Pythium* species, and *Rhizoctonia solani* which cause root and collar rot leading to wilting symptoms often referred to as Parawilt. Effective control requires an integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods.

Here's how to control Wilt (including Parawilt) in Gerbera:

### I. Cultural Practices (Preventive and Management)

1.  **Use Disease-Free Planting Material:** Always source healthy, certified tissue-cultured plantlets or cuttings from reputable nurseries.
2.  **Sterilize Growing Media:** For protected cultivation (polyhouses/net houses), sterilize the growing media (cocopeat, vermiculite, soil mix) using steam sterilization or chemical fumigants (if permitted and handled by trained personnel).
3.  **Ensure Excellent Drainage:** Gerbera plants are highly susceptible to root rot in waterlogged conditions. Use raised beds and well-draining media. Avoid overwatering.
4.  **Maintain Optimal Soil pH:** Gerbera prefers a slightly acidic to neutral pH (6.0-7.0). Maintain this range as extreme pH can stress plants and make them more susceptible.
5.  **Sanitation:**
    *   Remove and destroy infected plants immediately to prevent the spread of inoculum. Do not compost infected plant material.
    *   Disinfect tools, pots, and benches regularly with a suitable disinfectant (e.g., 1% sodium hypochlorite solution).
6.  **Avoid Root Injury:** Minimize any damage to roots during transplanting or intercultural operations, as wounds provide entry points for pathogens.
7.  **Soil Solarization:** In open field conditions or before planting in polyhouses, soil solarization during hot summer months (for 4-6 weeks) can significantly reduce soil-borne pathogen populations.

### II. Biological Control

1.  **Bio-fungicides:** Application of beneficial microbial antagonists can suppress pathogen growth.
    *   **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum**: Apply as a soil drench or mix with the growing media at the time of planting.
        *   **Dosage:** Typically 2.5-5 kg/acre mixed with 50-100 kg farmyard manure (FYM) or 5-10 g/L of water for drenching. Repeat applications every 3-4 weeks, especially during susceptible stages.

### III. Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved Technical Chemicals)

Chemical control should be used judiciously and in rotation to prevent resistance development. Always follow product label instructions for specific dosages and safety precautions.

**A. For Fusarium Wilt (*Fusarium oxysporum*)**

*   **Carbendazim**:
    *   **Dosage:** 1-2 g/L of water as a soil drench around the base of the plant. Repeat every 10-15 days if symptoms persist or as a preventive measure in high-risk areas.
*   **Thiophanate-methyl**:
    *   **Dosage:** 1-1.5 g/L of water as a soil drench.
*   **Propiconazole**:
    *   **Dosage:** 0.5-1 ml/L of water as a soil drench.

**B. For Root/Collar Rot (*Phytophthora*, *Pythium*, *Rhizoctonia*) leading to Parawilt**

*   **Propamocarb hydrochloride**: (Effective against Oomycetes like *Phytophthora* and *Pythium*)
    *   **Dosage:** 2-3 ml/L of water as a soil drench.
*   **Fosetyl-aluminium**: (Systemic, effective against Oomycetes)
    *   **Dosage:** 2-3 g/L of water as a soil drench.
*   **Metalaxyl**: (Often used in combination products, effective against Oomycetes)
    *   **Dosage:** If available as a standalone product, typically 0.5-1 g/L of water as a soil drench. (Note: Often found in combination with Mancozeb).
*   **Validamycin**: (Effective against *Rhizoctonia*)
    *   **Dosage:** 2-3 ml/L of water as a soil drench.
*   **Pencycuron**: (Specific for *Rhizoctonia*)
    *   **Dosage:** 0.5-1 g/L of water as a soil drench.

**Important Considerations for Chemical Application:**

*   **Rotation:** Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in pathogens.
*   **Timing:** Apply fungicides preventively if the disease is endemic in your area or at the first sign of symptoms.
*   **Drenching:** Ensure thorough drenching of the soil around the root zone for systemic absorption and direct contact with soil-borne pathogens.
