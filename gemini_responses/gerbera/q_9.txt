Mites, including Red Spider Mite (Tetranychus urticae) and Rust Mite (Polyphagotarsonemus latus, also known as Broad Mite), are significant pests of Gerbera, causing considerable damage if not managed effectively. An integrated pest management (IPM) approach is crucial for their control.

Here's a comprehensive strategy:

**I. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Approach**

1.  **Monitoring:**
    *   Regularly inspect the undersides of leaves, new growth, and flower buds for mites, webbing (Red Spider Mite), or distorted growth (Rust Mite). A hand lens can be very helpful.
    *   Yellow sticky traps can help monitor adult mite populations, though they are more effective for flying insects.

2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Humidity Management:** Red Spider Mites thrive in hot, dry conditions. Maintaining higher humidity (e.g., through misting or fogging in polyhouses) can help suppress their populations.
    *   **Water Sprays:** A strong jet of water directed at the undersides of leaves can physically dislodge mites and their eggs, especially in early stages of infestation. Do this early in the day to allow foliage to dry.
    *   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infested plant parts, weeds (which can host mites), and crop debris.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush, soft growth that is more attractive to mites.

**II. Chemical Control (Acaricides)**

When mite populations are high and cultural methods are insufficient, chemical control becomes necessary. Always rotate different classes of acaricides to prevent the development of resistance. Ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where mites primarily reside.

Here are some CIBRC approved technical chemical names for mite control in Gerbera, along with their recommended dosages:

*   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** 0.5 - 0.75 ml/L of water.
    *   Effective against all life stages of spider mites and also provides good control of broad mites.
*   **Abamectin 1.8% EC:** 0.3 - 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   Highly effective against spider mites and broad mites, with translaminar action.
*   **Fenpyroximate 5% SC:** 0.5 - 1 ml/L of water.
    *   Provides quick knockdown and residual control against spider mites.
*   **Propargite 57% EC:** 1.5 - 2 ml/L of water.
    *   A broad-spectrum acaricide effective against various mite species.
*   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP:** 2 - 3 g/L of water.
    *   Effective against rust mites and also has fungicidal properties. **Caution:** Do not apply when temperatures are very high (above 30°C) as it can cause phytotoxicity (leaf burn). Also, avoid mixing with oil-based sprays.
*   **Hexythiazox 5.45% EC:** 0.5 - 0.75 ml/L of water.
    *   A mite growth regulator, primarily ovicidal and larvicidal, effective in breaking the mite life cycle.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Rotation:** To prevent resistance development, rotate between acaricides with different modes of action. Do not use the same chemical repeatedly.
*   **Thorough Coverage:** Mites are often found on the undersides of leaves. Ensure that the spray solution thoroughly covers all plant surfaces, especially the lower leaf surfaces.
*   **Timing:** Apply acaricides early in the morning or late in the evening to minimize drift and maximize efficacy, especially in hot weather.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, and protective clothing when handling and applying pesticides. Follow all instructions on the product label.
*   **Re-application:** Mite control often requires multiple applications due to their rapid life cycle. Follow label recommendations for re-application intervals.
*   **Local Advice:** For specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and current pest pressure, it is always advisable to consult with the experts at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU) or your local agricultural extension officer.
