As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in Gerbera cultivation in Haryana:

It is crucial to adopt an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods for sustainable pest control. Always ensure thorough spray coverage and rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

### 1. Borers (Stem Borers, Flower Stalk Borers)

Borers, typically larvae of various moths, can cause significant damage by tunneling into stems and flower stalks, leading to wilting and plant death.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Regularly inspect plants for signs of entry holes or frass (excrement).
    *   Prune and destroy affected plant parts immediately to prevent further spread.
    *   Maintain good field sanitation.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   For systemic action and good control of internal feeders:
        *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC**: 0.3 - 0.4 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Flubendiamide 20% WG**: 0.2 - 0.3 g per litre of water.
        *   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG**: 0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water.
    *   For contact and translaminar action:
        *   **Indoxacarb 14.5% SC**: 0.5 - 0.7 ml per litre of water.

### 2. Caterpillars (Leaf-eating Caterpillars, Flower-eating Caterpillars)

Various species of caterpillars (larvae of moths like *Spodoptera litura*, *Helicoverpa armigera*, etc.) can feed on Gerbera leaves, buds, and flowers, causing defoliation and damage to marketable parts.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Regular monitoring and hand-picking of larger caterpillars in small infestations.
    *   Remove weeds around the crop that can serve as alternate hosts.
    *   Use pheromone traps to monitor adult moth populations.
*   **Biological Control:**
    *   **Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)** (various formulations): Apply as per product label, typically 1-2 g or ml per litre of water. This is effective against young larvae and is safe for beneficial insects.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   For broad-spectrum control against various lepidopteran larvae:
        *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC**: 0.3 - 0.4 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG**: 0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water.
        *   **Flubendiamide 20% WG**: 0.2 - 0.3 g per litre of water.
        *   **Indoxacarb 14.5% SC**: 0.5 - 0.7 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC**: 0.5 - 1.0 ml per litre of water (use with caution to protect beneficial insects).

### 3. Diamondback Moth (*Plutella xylostella*)

This is not known to affect Gerbera. Diamondback moth is a specific pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower, mustard).

### 4. Leaf Folder

Leaf folders are typically larvae of moths that roll or fold leaves and feed from within the protective fold. This can reduce photosynthetic area and damage foliage.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Regularly inspect plants and manually crush larvae inside folded leaves if infestation is low.
    *   Maintain field hygiene.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Insecticides effective against caterpillars are generally effective against leaf folders as well, as they are also lepidopteran larvae. Ensure good penetration into the folded leaves.
        *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC**: 0.3 - 0.4 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG**: 0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water.
        *   **Flubendiamide 20% WG**: 0.2 - 0.3 g per litre of water.
        *   **Indoxacarb 14.5% SC**: 0.5 - 0.7 ml per litre of water.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label for specific dosages, application methods, and safety precautions.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Avoid spraying during peak flowering to protect pollinators. If spraying is necessary, do it in the late evening or early morning.
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.
