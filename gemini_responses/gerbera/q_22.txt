As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified cultivation practices for Gerbera (Gerbera jamesonii) in Haryana, focusing on commercial production, which primarily utilizes vegetative propagation.

Gerbera is predominantly propagated using tissue culture plantlets or suckers for commercial cut flower production to ensure genetic uniformity, desired flower characteristics, and disease-free planting material. Propagation by seed is generally not recommended for commercial purposes due to genetic variability and longer time to flowering.

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern (Planting Method):**
    *   **Primary Method (Commercial):** Gerbera is commercially propagated by transplanting healthy tissue culture plantlets or suckers into well-prepared raised beds, typically within polyhouses or shade net houses.
    *   **Pattern:** Plantlets are usually planted in a staggered or zig-zag pattern within rows. This arrangement optimizes light interception, improves air circulation around the plants, and allows for better management practices.
    *   **Seed Sowing (Limited Use):** If seeds are used (e.g., for breeding or specific purposes), they are sown in sterile trays filled with a fine, well-draining growing medium (e.g., coco peat, vermiculite, perlite mix). Seeds are very small and are lightly covered or pressed onto the surface. Seedlings are then transplanted once they reach an appropriate size.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   For tissue culture plantlets or suckers, it is crucial to plant them so that the crown (the point where the roots meet the stem) is at or slightly above the soil surface.
    *   Burying the crown can lead to crown rot, poor growth, and reduced flower production. The root ball should be fully covered by the growing medium.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   **Polyhouse/Protected Cultivation (Recommended for Haryana):**
        *   **Row-to-Row:** 40-50 cm
        *   **Plant-to-Plant:** 30-40 cm
        *   This spacing typically results in a plant density of 5-7 plants per square meter, which is optimal for maximizing yield and quality in protected environments.
    *   **Open Field (Less Common for Commercial Cut Flowers):** While less common for high-quality commercial cut flowers in Haryana due to environmental challenges, if grown in open fields, slightly wider spacing might be adopted, but protected cultivation is highly recommended for Gerbera.

*   **Seed Dose (Planting Material Requirement):**
    *   **Commercial Production (Plantlets):** Since tissue culture plantlets are the primary planting material, there is no "seed dose." Instead, the requirement is calculated based on the number of plantlets needed per unit area.
        *   For a plant density of 5-7 plants per square meter, approximately 50,000 to 70,000 plantlets would be required per hectare (10,000 sq m).
    *   **Seed Propagation (If applicable):** If seeds were to be used, the seed rate would be very low due to their minute size. Typically, 2-3 grams of seeds might be sufficient to raise seedlings for a small area, but this is not the standard commercial practice for cut flower production.
