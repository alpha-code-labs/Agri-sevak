As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned conditions in Gerbera:

### Control of Dieback in Gerbera

Dieback in Gerbera is typically a symptom complex rather than a specific disease, often indicating underlying issues such as fungal infections (e.g., *Botrytis cinerea* causing grey mould, or root/crown rot pathogens like *Phytophthora*, *Pythium*, *Fusarium*), environmental stress, or poor cultural practices. Effective management involves both cultural and chemical approaches.

**Cultural Practices:**
*   **Sanitation:** Promptly remove and destroy all infected plant parts (leaves, flowers, stems) to reduce inoculum.
*   **Ventilation:** Ensure good air circulation around plants by proper spacing and ventilation in polyhouses/greenhouses to reduce humidity.
*   **Water Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day, to keep foliage dry. Water at the base of the plants. Ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging, which can lead to root rots.
*   **Nutrition:** Maintain balanced nutrition to enhance plant vigor and resistance.
*   **Pruning:** Use sterile tools for any pruning and disinfect them between plants.

**Chemical Control (for fungal causes of dieback, particularly *Botrytis* and broad-spectrum protection):**
For effective control, rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

*   **Carbendazim 50% WP**: Apply at 0.5-1 g/L of water as a foliar spray or drench.
*   **Mancozeb 75% WP**: Apply at 2 g/L of water as a protective foliar spray.
*   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC**: Apply at 0.5-1 ml/L of water as a foliar spray.
*   **Tebuconazole 25.9% EC**: Apply at 0.75-1 ml/L of water as a foliar spray.
*   **Fludioxonil 2.5% + Cyprodinil 37.5% WG**: Apply at 0.6-0.8 g/L of water as a foliar spray, particularly effective against *Botrytis*.

### Control of Twig Blight in Gerbera

This is not known to affect Gerbera. Twig blight is a disease typically associated with woody plants (trees and shrubs), affecting their twigs and branches. Gerbera is an herbaceous perennial and does not possess woody twigs.

### Control of Tikka Disease in Gerbera

This is not known to affect Gerbera. Tikka disease is a common name for leaf spot diseases primarily affecting groundnut (peanut), caused by *Cercospora arachidicola* and *Phaeoisariopsis personata*. Gerbera can suffer from various leaf spot diseases, but they are caused by different pathogens (e.g., *Alternaria*, *Cercospora gerberae*, *Phyllosticta*, *Septoria*) and are not referred to as "Tikka disease."
