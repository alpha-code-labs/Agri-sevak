As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned conditions in Gerbera, keeping in mind the specific context of Haryana, India.

### Control of Scab, Canker, Gummosis, and Lichen in Gerbera

**1. Scab in Gerbera**
Scab in Gerbera is typically caused by fungal pathogens (e.g., *Sphaceloma* species), leading to characteristic raised, corky spots on leaves, petioles, and flower stalks.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Ensure proper plant spacing to improve air circulation.
    *   Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day, to reduce leaf wetness.
    *   Remove and destroy infected plant parts to reduce inoculum.
    *   Use disease-free planting material.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   For preventive and early curative action, apply systemic and contact fungicides.
    *   **Mancozeb**: Apply at 2.0-2.5 g/L of water as a foliar spray.
    *   **Chlorothalonil**: Apply at 2.0 g/L of water as a foliar spray.
    *   **Carbendazim**: Apply at 0.5-1.0 g/L of water as a foliar spray.
    *   **Azoxystrobin**: Apply at 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water as a foliar spray.
    *   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

**2. Canker in Gerbera**
Cankers in Gerbera are often associated with stem or crown rot diseases caused by various fungal pathogens (e.g., *Phytophthora*, *Fusarium*, *Rhizoctonia*) or sometimes bacteria, leading to sunken lesions, wilting, and plant collapse.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Use certified disease-free planting material.
    *   Ensure excellent drainage in the growing medium and pots.
    *   Avoid mechanical injuries to stems and crowns during cultural operations.
    *   Maintain good sanitation by removing plant debris and sterilizing tools.
    *   Avoid overwatering, especially around the crown region.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   For fungal cankers/rots (e.g., *Phytophthora*, *Pythium*):
        *   **Propamocarb Hydrochloride**: Apply at 2.0-3.0 ml/L of water as a drench around the plant base.
        *   **Metalaxyl-M**: Apply at 0.5-1.0 g/L of water as a drench around the plant base.
        *   **Azoxystrobin**: Apply at 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water as a foliar spray or drench.
    *   For fungal cankers/rots (e.g., *Fusarium*):
        *   **Carbendazim**: Apply at 0.5-1.0 g/L of water as a drench around the plant base.
    *   For suspected bacterial cankers/rots (less common as distinct cankers in Gerbera, but if present):
        *   **Streptomycin Sulphate + Tetracycline Hydrochloride** (90:10 formulation): Apply at 1.0 g/10 L of water as a foliar spray or drench.
        *   **Copper Oxychloride**: Apply at 2.5-3.0 g/L of water as a foliar spray or drench.

**3. Gummosis in Gerbera**
This is not known to affect Gerbera. Gummosis is primarily a symptom of stress or disease in woody plants, particularly fruit trees, where sap exudes from the bark. While Gerbera can exhibit sap exudation due to severe stem or crown rot, it is not typically referred to as gummosis in this herbaceous plant. The underlying rot should be addressed as described under "Canker" above.

**4. Lichen in Gerbera**
This is not known to affect Gerbera. Lichens are symbiotic organisms (fungus and alga) that grow on surfaces like tree bark, rocks, or sometimes on older, less vigorous plant stems. They are epiphytic and non-parasitic, meaning they do not harm the plant itself. They are not a disease or condition that requires control on Gerbera plants.
