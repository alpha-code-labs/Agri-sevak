As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies in Gerbera cultivation in Haryana.

### Control of Beetles and Weevils in Gerbera

Beetles and Weevils can cause significant damage to Gerbera plants, both as adults (feeding on leaves, flowers, and stems) and as larvae (grubs feeding on roots). Effective management requires an integrated approach.

**1. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Principles:**

*   **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect plants, especially the undersides of leaves, stems, and the soil around the base, for adults, larvae, and signs of damage (chewed leaves, wilting).
*   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy plant debris, weeds, and infested plant parts to reduce breeding sites and overwintering populations.
*   **Crop Rotation:** If Gerbera is grown in open fields, rotating with non-host crops can help break the pest cycle. In polyhouses, thorough cleaning and soil sterilization between crops are crucial.

**2. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**

*   **Hand-picking:** For small infestations, especially of larger beetles or weevils, hand-picking and destroying them can be effective.
*   **Soil Solarization/Sterilization:** Before planting, especially in polyhouses, solarizing or sterilizing the soil can kill soil-borne grubs (larvae of beetles and weevils).
*   **Physical Barriers:** In some cases, fine nets can prevent adult beetles from reaching plants.

**3. Biological Control:**

*   **Entomopathogenic Fungi:** For soil-dwelling grubs (white grubs, root weevil larvae), drenching the soil with formulations of entomopathogenic fungi can be effective.
    *   **Beauveria bassiana** (e.g., 1-2 kg/acre or 5 g/L of water as a soil drench). Apply during evening hours for best results.
*   **Nematodes:** Entomopathogenic nematodes (e.g., *Heterorhabditis indica*, *Steinernema carpocapsae*) can be effective against soil-dwelling larvae.

**4. Chemical Control (Use only CIBRC approved technical chemicals):**

When pest populations are high and other methods are insufficient, chemical control may be necessary. Always follow label instructions for dosage, application method, and safety precautions. Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

*   **For Foliar Feeding Adults (Beetles and Weevils):**
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: 0.5 ml/L of water (Foliar spray).
    *   **Cypermethrin** 25% EC: 0.5 ml/L of water (Foliar spray).
    *   **Emamectin Benzoate** 5% SG: 0.2 g/L of water (Foliar spray, particularly effective against larvae but also adults).
    *   **Indoxacarb** 14.5% SC: 0.5 ml/L of water (Foliar spray).

*   **For Soil-Dwelling Grubs (Larvae of Beetles and Weevils):**
    *   **Fipronil** 5% SC: 2-3 ml/L of water (Soil drench around the root zone).
    *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: 2.5 ml/L of water (Soil drench around the root zone, use with caution and as per label).

### Control of Sawflies in Gerbera

This is not known to affect Gerbera. Sawflies are generally not considered a significant pest of Gerbera in Haryana or globally.
