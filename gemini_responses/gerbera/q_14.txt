As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling soil pests like termites and root-knot nematodes in Gerbera cultivation in Haryana.

Gerbera is susceptible to damage from both termites and root-knot nematodes, which can significantly impact plant health, growth, and flower production. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods, is recommended for effective and sustainable control.

### Control of Termites (Odontotermes spp., Microtermes spp.)

Termites feed on the roots and base of the stem, leading to wilting, yellowing, and eventual death of the plant.

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Methods:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove all plant debris, stubble, and wood pieces from the field before planting, as these can serve as food sources for termites.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** Expose termite colonies to predators and sunlight during land preparation.
*   **Avoid Organic Matter Accumulation:** Do not allow large quantities of undecomposed organic matter near the plant base.

**2. Chemical Control (Pre-planting and Post-planting):**
*   **Pre-planting Soil Treatment:**
    *   Apply **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** at 2.5 litres per acre mixed with 200-400 litres of water, and drench the soil thoroughly before planting. Incorporate it into the soil.
    *   Alternatively, apply **Fipronil 5% SC** at 400-600 ml per acre mixed with 200-400 litres of water as a soil drench before planting.
*   **Post-planting (if infestation is observed):**
    *   Drench the soil around the base of affected plants with **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** at 2.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   Alternatively, drench with **Fipronil 5% SC** at 1.5-2 ml per litre of water around the base of affected plants. Ensure the solution reaches the root zone.

### Control of Nematodes (Root-knot Nematodes - Meloidogyne spp.)

Root-knot nematodes are a major problem in Gerbera, causing characteristic galls or swellings on the roots. This impairs water and nutrient uptake, leading to stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, reduced flowering, and overall poor plant vigour.

**1. Cultural and Biological Methods:**
*   **Soil Solarization:** Cover the moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks during hot summer months (May-June) to raise soil temperature and kill nematodes.
*   **Use Healthy Planting Material:** Always use nematode-free tissue-cultured plantlets or healthy suckers.
*   **Crop Rotation:** If possible in open field conditions, rotate Gerbera with non-host crops (e.g., marigold, which has nematicidal properties).
*   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporate well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or neem cake (200-400 kg per acre) into the soil. Neem cake has nematicidal properties.
*   **Biological Nematicides:**
    *   Apply **Purpureocillium lilacinum** (formerly Paecilomyces lilacinus) at 2-4 kg per acre, mixed with 100 kg of FYM or compost, and broadcast evenly before planting or apply around existing plants.
    *   Apply **Bacillus subtilis** at 2-4 kg per acre, mixed with 100 kg of FYM or compost, and broadcast evenly before planting or apply around existing plants.
    *   **Trichoderma viride/harzianum** (primarily for fungal diseases) can also offer some suppressive effect on nematodes when applied at 2-4 kg per acre with FYM.

**2. Chemical Control (Pre-planting and Post-planting):**
*   **Pre-planting Soil Treatment (most effective):**
    *   Apply **Carbofuran 3% G** at 10-15 kg per acre, broadcast evenly and incorporate into the soil thoroughly before planting.
    *   Alternatively, apply **Phorate 10% G** at 4-6 kg per acre, broadcast evenly and incorporate into the soil thoroughly before planting.
    *   A modern option is **Fluensulfone 2% GR** at 10-15 kg per acre, broadcast and incorporated into the soil before planting.
*   **Post-planting (for existing infestations):**
    *   Apply **Fipronil 0.3% GR** at 10-15 kg per acre around the base of the plants and lightly incorporate into the soil, followed by irrigation. This can help suppress nematode populations.
    *   Drenching with **Oxamyl 24% SL** at 2-3 ml per litre of water around the root zone can also be effective, but ensure proper safety precautions.

**General Recommendations:**
*   **Soil Testing:** Conduct regular soil tests to determine the presence and population density of nematodes and other soil pests.
*   **Integrated Approach:** Combine cultural, biological, and chemical methods for the most effective and sustainable control.
*   **Follow Label Instructions:** Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the pesticide label regarding dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   **Protective Gear:** Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) while handling and applying chemicals.
