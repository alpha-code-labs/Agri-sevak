Protecting Gerbera from wild animals, especially in a commercial setting like a polyhouse or shade net house, primarily relies on robust physical exclusion methods. While larger animals like Nilgai or Wild Boar can be a threat to open field crops, Gerbera's typical cultivation environment offers a degree of inherent protection. However, rodents, birds, and sometimes monkeys can still pose significant challenges.

Here are scientifically verified methods to protect Gerbera from wild animals:

1.  **Physical Exclusion and Fencing (Most Effective):**
    *   **Maintain Polyhouse/Shade Net House Integrity:** This is the most critical step for Gerbera. Ensure that the polyhouse or shade net structure is fully enclosed with no gaps, tears, or openings in the plastic sheeting or netting. All doors and vents should be securely fitted and kept closed when not in use. This prevents entry of most animals, including birds, monkeys, and rodents.
    *   **Perimeter Fencing:** For the entire farm or around the polyhouse complex, install a sturdy perimeter fence.
        *   **Barbed Wire or Chain-link Fencing:** A fence of at least 2-2.5 meters (6-8 feet) height can deter larger animals like Nilgai, Wild Boar, and stray cattle. Ensure the fence is well-maintained and extends slightly below ground level to prevent burrowing.
        *   **Electric Fencing:** If permitted and installed safely according to local regulations, a low-voltage electric fence can be highly effective against larger animals. It requires careful installation, regular maintenance, and clear warning signs.
    *   **Fine Mesh Netting:** For smaller openings, vents, or around the base of polyhouses, use fine mesh netting to prevent entry of birds and smaller rodents.

2.  **Rodent Management (Specific "Wild Animal" Pest):**
    Rodents (rats, mice, bandicoots) can cause significant damage to Gerbera plants, roots, and irrigation systems.
    *   **Sanitation and Habitat Modification:** Keep the area around the polyhouse and inside it clean. Remove weeds, debris, piles of equipment, and any potential hiding spots for rodents. Store feed or other attractants in rodent-proof containers.
    *   **Trapping:** Use snap traps or live traps strategically placed inside and around the polyhouse. Regularly check and reset traps.
    *   **Chemical Rodenticides:** Use CIBRC-approved rodenticides strictly according to label instructions and with extreme caution to prevent harm to non-target animals or humans. Always use bait stations to prevent access by non-target animals.
        *   **Zinc Phosphide:** An acute rodenticide, typically used as a bait.
        *   **Bromadiolone:** An anticoagulant rodenticide, commonly available as ready-to-use baits.
        *   **Coumatetralyl:** Another anticoagulant rodenticide, also used in bait formulations.

3.  **Other Deterrent Methods (Limited Efficacy for Large Animals):**
    *   **Auditory and Visual Deterrents:** Devices like scarecrows, reflective tapes, or old CDs can deter birds initially, but animals often habituate to them quickly. Ultrasonic devices are generally not effective.
    *   **Guard Dogs:** For larger farm areas, well-trained guard dogs can deter some wild animals, but this requires significant commitment to their care and training.

By implementing a combination of these methods, with a strong emphasis on physical exclusion, Gerbera cultivation can be effectively protected from wild animal damage.
