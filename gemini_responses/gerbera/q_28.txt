As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified practices to protect Gerbera from environmental stress in Haryana:

Gerbera (Gerbera jamesonii) is sensitive to extreme temperatures and intense light. Optimal growth and flowering occur between 18-25°C. Protecting them from the harsh environmental conditions prevalent in Haryana is crucial for successful cultivation.

### 1. Protection from Extreme Cold and Frost:

*   **Polyhouse/Greenhouse Cultivation:** This is the most effective and recommended method for commercial Gerbera cultivation in Haryana. A polyhouse provides a controlled environment, shielding plants from direct exposure to cold winds and frost.
*   **Heating Systems (within Polyhouse):** For severe cold spells, supplementary heating systems (e.g., hot air blowers, radiant heaters) can be employed within polyhouses to maintain optimal temperatures (18-25°C).
*   **Row Covers/Low Tunnels:** For smaller plots or temporary protection, covering plants with non-woven fabric or clear plastic sheets overnight can trap heat and prevent frost damage. Ensure removal during the day to allow light and air circulation.
*   **Light Irrigation:** Applying a light irrigation in the late afternoon before a predicted frost can slightly raise soil temperature and release latent heat, offering some protection.
*   **Mulching:** Apply a layer of organic mulch (e.g., straw, sugarcane trash) of 5-10 cm thickness around the base of the plants. This insulates the soil, protecting roots from freezing temperatures.

### 2. Protection from Heat/Loo (Hot Winds):

*   **Shade Netting:** Essential during summer months. Install 50-75% shade nets over the cultivation area (or polyhouse). This significantly reduces direct solar radiation and ambient temperature, mitigating the impact of heat and Loo.
*   **Misting/Fogging Systems:** Within polyhouses, misting or fogging systems can effectively lower the ambient temperature and increase humidity, counteracting the drying effect of hot winds.
*   **Adequate Ventilation:** Ensure proper ventilation in polyhouses to prevent heat buildup. Utilize side vents, roof vents, and exhaust fans to facilitate air exchange.
*   **Windbreaks:** Plant tall, dense trees or construct physical barriers on the windward side of the cultivation area to reduce the impact of hot, dry winds (Loo).
*   **Timely Irrigation:** Maintain consistent soil moisture through regular and adequate irrigation, especially during hot periods, to prevent water stress and help plants cool through transpiration.
*   **Mulching:** Organic mulches help retain soil moisture and keep the root zone cooler, reducing the impact of heat.

### 3. Protection from Intense Sunlight:

*   **Shade Netting:** As mentioned for heat, shade nets are the primary method to filter intense sunlight, preventing leaf scorch and flower bleaching. The percentage of shade should be adjusted based on the season and light intensity, typically 50-75% during peak summer.
*   **Whitewashing Polyhouse Roofs:** Applying a temporary layer of whitewash (lime solution) on the exterior of polyhouse roofs can reflect a significant portion of solar radiation, reducing both light intensity and internal temperature. This can be washed off as temperatures drop.
*   **Diffused Light:** Modern polyhouse coverings are designed to diffuse light, spreading it more evenly and reducing hot spots, which is highly beneficial for Gerbera.
