As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the use of growth regulators and Boron in Gerbera cultivation for Haryana.

It is crucial to remember that the precise dosage and timing can vary based on specific Gerbera varieties, environmental conditions, and desired outcomes. Always conduct a small-scale trial before widespread application.

### Recommended Doses:

1.  **Ethephon (Ethrel)**
    *   **Role in Gerbera:** **Ethephon** is a plant growth regulator that releases ethylene, influencing various physiological processes. In Gerbera, it can be used to promote uniform flowering, increase flower yield, and sometimes to regulate plant height.
    *   **Recommended Dose:** Apply **Ethephon** (40% SL formulation) at a concentration of **0.25 - 0.6 ml/L** of water as a foliar spray.
    *   **Application:** This can be applied during the vegetative growth phase, typically 30-45 days after planting, or as per specific crop requirements to enhance flowering. Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage. Avoid spraying during peak sunlight hours.

2.  **2,4-D**
    *   **Role in Gerbera:** This is not known to be recommended as a growth regulator for Gerbera. **2,4-D** is primarily a synthetic auxin widely used as a selective herbicide. While auxins are plant hormones, the application of **2,4-D** at concentrations typically used for growth regulation in other specific contexts is highly risky for Gerbera and can cause severe phytotoxicity or act as a herbicide, leading to plant damage or death.
    *   **Recommendation:** We do not recommend the use of **2,4-D** as a growth regulator for Gerbera due to its potent herbicidal properties and the high risk of crop damage.

3.  **Boron**
    *   **Role in Gerbera:** Boron is an essential micronutrient vital for Gerbera's growth and development, particularly for pollen germination, flower formation, cell wall integrity, and sugar transport. Boron deficiency can lead to poor flowering, deformed flowers, and reduced yield. It is not a hormone or growth regulator but is critical for optimal plant function.
    *   **Recommended Dose (Foliar Application):**
        *   Apply **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (e.g., Solubor, containing 17-20% Boron) at a concentration of **1 - 2 g/L** of water as a foliar spray.
        *   Alternatively, if using **Sodium tetraborate decahydrate** (Borax, containing 10-11% Boron), apply at **2 - 4 g/L** of water.
        *   **Application:** Spray during active vegetative growth and at the flower bud initiation stage. Repeat every 15-20 days if deficiency symptoms are observed or as a preventive measure.
    *   **Recommended Dose (Soil Application):**
        *   Based on soil test results, if Boron deficiency is confirmed, apply **5 - 10 kg/acre** of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** or **10 - 20 kg/acre** of **Sodium tetraborate decahydrate** (Borax) as a basal application before planting or as a top dressing.
        *   **Important:** Soil testing is highly recommended before applying Boron to the soil, as excessive Boron can be toxic to plants.

**General Precautions:**
*   Always read and follow the manufacturer's instructions on the product label.
*   Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during application.
*   Ensure proper calibration of spray equipment for accurate dosage.
*   Avoid spraying during windy conditions or when rain is expected shortly after application.
*   For any specific concerns or severe deficiency symptoms, it is advisable to consult with local agricultural extension specialists or HAU experts for tailored advice.
