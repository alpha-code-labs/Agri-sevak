As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Gerbera in Haryana.

**General Cultural Practices for Fungal Disease Management:**
Implementing these practices is crucial for reducing disease incidence and enhancing the efficacy of chemical treatments:
*   **Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy infected plant parts, fallen leaves, and other plant debris.
*   **Air Circulation:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to promote good air circulation, which helps reduce humidity around the foliage.
*   **Irrigation Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day. Water plants at the base in the morning to allow foliage to dry quickly.
*   **Drainage:** Ensure well-drained soil or growing media to prevent waterlogging, which can favor root rot and other soil-borne diseases.
*   **Nutrition:** Maintain balanced plant nutrition to enhance plant vigor and resistance to diseases. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can lead to lush, susceptible growth.
*   **Disease-Free Material:** Always use healthy, disease-free planting material (e.g., tissue culture plants or certified cuttings).

**Specific Disease Control Measures:**

**1. Alternaria Leaf Spot/Blight (Caused by *Alternaria* spp.)**
This disease is known to affect Gerbera, causing dark, concentric spots on leaves, which can lead to blight under severe conditions.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP): 2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Chlorothalonil** (75% WP): 2.0 g/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC): 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water.
    *   **Propiconazole** (25% EC): 1.0 ml/L of water.
    *   **Tebuconazole** (25.9% EC): 0.75 ml/L of water.

**2. Anthracnose (Caused by *Colletotrichum* spp.)**
This disease is known to affect Gerbera, causing irregular, sunken lesions on leaves, petioles, and flowers, often with dark margins.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Carbendazim** (50% WP): 1.0 g/L of water.
    *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP): 2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC): 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water.
    *   **Copper Oxychloride** (50% WP): 2.5-3.0 g/L of water.

**3. Blast**
This is not known to affect Gerbera.

**4. Blight (General Blight Symptoms, e.g., *Phytophthora* Blight, *Rhizoctonia* Blight)**
Various pathogens can cause blight in Gerbera, leading to rapid wilting, discoloration, and death of plant parts. *Phytophthora* blight is particularly destructive.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **For *Phytophthora* Blight (Oomycete):**
        *   **Propamocarb Hydrochloride** (72.2% SL): 2.0-2.5 ml/L of water (as drench or foliar spray).
        *   **Metalaxyl** (8% WP) + **Mancozeb** (64% WP) (Combination product): 2.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Dimethomorph** (50% WP): 0.5-1.0 g/L of water.
    *   **For other Blights (e.g., *Rhizoctonia*, *Botrytis* - see Grey Mildew):**
        *   **Carbendazim** (50% WP): 1.0 g/L of water (as drench for *Rhizoctonia*).
        *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC): 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water.

**5. Brown Spot**
This is a symptom often caused by pathogens like *Alternaria* or *Colletotrichum*. Control measures for Alternaria and Anthracnose will effectively manage brown spot symptoms.

**6. Downy Mildew (Caused by *Plasmopara* spp. or similar oomycetes)**
This disease is known to affect Gerbera, causing angular, yellowish spots on the upper leaf surface and a grayish-white, downy growth on the corresponding lower surface.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Propamocarb Hydrochloride** (72.2% SL): 2.0-2.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Metalaxyl** (8% WP) + **Mancozeb** (64% WP) (Combination product): 2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Dimethomorph** (50% WP): 0.5-1.0 g/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC): 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water.

**7. Powdery Mildew (Caused by *Erysiphe cichoracearum* or similar fungi)**
This disease is known to affect Gerbera, appearing as white, powdery patches on leaves, stems, and flower buds, leading to distortion and reduced vigor.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Sulphur** (80% WP): 2.0-3.0 g/L of water.
    *   **Myclobutanil** (10% WP): 0.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Penconazole** (10% EC): 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Tebuconazole** (25.9% EC): 0.75 ml/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC): 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water.

**8. Grey Mildew (Synonymous with Grey Mold, Caused by *Botrytis cinerea*)**
This disease is known to affect Gerbera, especially under cool, humid conditions, causing fuzzy gray mold on flowers, buds, leaves, and stems, leading to rot.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Carbendazim** (50% WP): 1.0 g/L of water.
    *   **Thiophanate Methyl** (70% WP): 1.0 g/L of water.
    *   **Pyraclostrobin** (13.3% EC) + **Boscalid** (26.7% EC) (Combination product): 1.0-1.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Fludioxonil** (50% WG): 0.5 g/L of water.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Rotation:** Always rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in pathogens.
*   **Timing:** Apply fungicides preventively or at the very first sign of disease for best results.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough spray coverage of all plant parts, especially the undersides of leaves.
*   **Safety:** Always read and follow the label instructions for each chemical, including safety precautions, pre-harvest intervals, and recommended dosages.
*   **Local Advice:** Consult with local agricultural extension officers or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and current disease pressure.
