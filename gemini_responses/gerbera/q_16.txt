As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I emphasize that precise fertilizer recommendations for Gerbera are best made after a comprehensive soil test. This allows for tailoring nutrient application to your specific soil type, existing nutrient levels, and the crop's requirements, optimizing yield and quality while minimizing waste.

However, based on general scientific principles and common practices for Gerbera cultivation in Haryana, especially under protected conditions (polyhouse/net house), here are the recommended doses for the specified fertilizers on an annual basis per acre. These are *guidelines* and should be adjusted based on soil test results and crop growth stage.

**Crucial First Step: Soil Testing**
Before applying any fertilizers, a comprehensive soil test is **mandatory**. This will determine the existing nutrient levels (N, P, K, micronutrients, pH, EC) in your specific field and allow for precise, site-specific recommendations, preventing over- or under-application and optimizing nutrient use efficiency. HAU provides soil testing services.

**General NPK Requirement for Gerbera (Annual, per acre):**
A common recommendation for Gerbera is approximately 200-250 kg Nitrogen (N), 150-200 kg Phosphorus Pentoxide (P2O5), and 200-250 kg Potassium Oxide (K2O) per acre per year, typically applied through fertigation.

**Recommended Doses of Fertilizers for Gerbera (Annual, per acre):**

**1. Nitrogen (N) Sources:**
*   **Total N requirement:** Approximately 200-250 kg N per acre per year. This should be split into multiple applications throughout the crop cycle, preferably through fertigation.
    *   **Urea (46% N):**
        *   Dose: 435-545 kg **Urea** per acre per year.
        *   Application: Dissolve in water and apply through fertigation (drip irrigation) in weekly or bi-weekly splits.
    *   **Nano-Urea (4% N):**
        *   Dose: 2-4 ml per litre of water (or 250-500 ml per acre per spray).
        *   Application: Foliar spray, 2-3 sprays during active vegetative growth and flowering stages. Nano-Urea is a supplement to enhance nitrogen use efficiency and is not a complete replacement for conventional nitrogen fertilizers for basal or root zone application.

**2. Phosphorus (P) Sources:**
*   **Total P2O5 requirement:** Approximately 150-200 kg P2O5 per acre per year.
    *   **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP) (18% N, 46% P2O5):**
        *   Dose: 325-435 kg **Diammonium Phosphate** per acre per year.
        *   Application: Primarily as a basal application before planting or incorporated into the soil. Can also be used in fertigation, but solubility needs to be carefully managed.
    *   **Nano-DAP (8% N, 16% P2O5):**
        *   Dose: 2-4 ml per litre of water (or 500 ml per acre per spray).
        *   Application: Foliar spray, 2-3 sprays during vegetative growth and pre-flowering stages. Nano-DAP is a supplement to improve P uptake and efficiency, not a primary source for bulk P requirement.
    *   **Single Super Phosphate (SSP) (16% P2O5, 11% S):**
        *   Dose: 940-1250 kg **Single Super Phosphate** per acre per year.
        *   Application: Basal application, incorporated into the soil before planting. It also provides Sulphur.
    *   **Monoammonium Phosphate (MAP) (12% N, 61% P2O5):** (Often preferred for fertigation due to higher solubility and lower pH impact)
        *   Dose: 245-325 kg **Monoammonium Phosphate** per acre per year.
        *   Application: Highly suitable for fertigation.

**3. Potassium (K) Sources:**
*   **Total K2O requirement:** Approximately 200-250 kg K2O per acre per year.
    *   **Muriate of Potash (MOP) (Potassium Chloride) (60% K2O):**
        *   Dose: 335-415 kg **Potassium Chloride** per acre per year.
        *   Application: Can be applied as a basal dose or through fertigation.
    *   **Sulphate of Potash (SOP) (Potassium Sulphate) (50% K2O, 18% S):**
        *   Dose: 400-500 kg **Potassium Sulphate** per acre per year.
        *   Application: Preferred for fertigation, especially in chloride-sensitive crops or where additional sulphur is beneficial.

**4. NPK Complex Fertilizers:**
*   These are available in various grades (e.g., 19:19:19, 12:32:16, 10:26:26).
*   Dose: Varies significantly based on the specific grade and the NPK requirement. For example, if using **NPK (19:19:19)**, a dose of 100-130 kg per acre per year might be used to supplement other fertilizers, or higher if it's the primary source.
*   Application: Often used for basal application or early growth stages. Water-soluble NPK grades are excellent for fertigation.
*   **Recommendation:** For precise nutrient management in Gerbera, it is generally more flexible and efficient to use straight fertilizers (Urea, Monoammonium Phosphate, Potassium Sulphate/Chloride) through fertigation to precisely control the N, P, and K ratios according to crop demand at different growth stages.

**5. Sulphur (S) Sources:**
*   **Total S requirement:** Approximately 30-40 kg S per acre per year.
    *   Often supplied through **Single Super Phosphate** (11% S) or **Sulphate of Potash** (18% S).
    *   **Elemental Sulphur (90% S):**
        *   Dose: 35-45 kg **Elemental Sulphur** per acre per year.
        *   Application: Basal application, incorporated into the soil. It also helps in lowering soil pH if it's alkaline.
    *   **Gypsum (Calcium Sulphate) (13-18% S):**
        *   Dose: Varies widely, often used as a soil amendment for calcium and sulphur.
        *   Application: Basal application.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Fertigation:** For Gerbera grown under protected cultivation, fertigation (applying fertilizers through the drip irrigation system) is the most efficient method. This allows for precise, frequent application of nutrients directly to the root zone, matching the crop's daily demand.
*   **Growth Stages:** Nutrient requirements change with crop growth stages. Higher N during vegetative growth, and balanced NPK with increased K during flowering for optimal flower quality and longevity.
*   **Micronutrients:** Gerbera also requires micronutrients (Boron, Zinc, Manganese, Iron, Copper, Molybdenum). These should be applied based on soil test results, either through fertigation (chelated forms are preferred) or foliar sprays.
*   **Organic Matter:** Incorporating well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost (10-15 tonnes per acre) before planting significantly improves soil health, water retention, and nutrient availability.

For precise and optimal nutrient management, always rely on a recent soil test report from a reputable laboratory like HAU, Hisar, and consult with an agricultural expert.
