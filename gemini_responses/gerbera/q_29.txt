Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide guidance on managing "dropping" in Gerbera.

Firstly, it is important to clarify that Gerbera is a flowering plant. Therefore, "Fruit drop" and "Tinda/Boll dropping" are **not known to affect Gerbera**. These terms are applicable to fruit-bearing plants or specific crops like cotton (for boll dropping).

In Gerbera, the primary concern related to "dropping" is **flower bud drop or premature flower wilting/dropping**. This is usually a symptom of underlying stress rather than a disease or pest in itself. Effective control requires identifying and addressing the root cause.

Here's how to control flower bud/flower dropping in Gerbera:

**I. Cultural and Environmental Management (Prevention is Key):**

1.  **Optimal Temperature:** Gerbera thrives in moderate temperatures.
    *   Day temperature: 20-25°C
    *   Night temperature: 15-18°C
    *   Extreme heat or cold can cause stress and lead to bud drop. Provide shade during intense summer heat and protection from frost in winter.
2.  **Consistent Watering:**
    *   Maintain consistent moisture in the growing medium. Both overwatering (leading to root rot) and underwatering (causing drought stress) can lead to flower drop.
    *   Ensure excellent drainage to prevent waterlogging.
3.  **Adequate Light:**
    *   Gerbera requires bright, indirect light for optimal flowering. Insufficient light can lead to weak stems and bud abortion.
4.  **Humidity:**
    *   Maintain moderate humidity (around 50-60%). Very low humidity can stress the plants.
5.  **Air Circulation:**
    *   Good air circulation helps prevent fungal diseases and maintains a healthy environment.
6.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Provide a balanced fertilization program. Deficiencies or excesses of certain nutrients can cause stress.
    *   **Calcium** and **Boron** deficiencies are particularly known to cause bud abortion and flower malformation. Ensure these micronutrients are adequately supplied.
    *   Use a water-soluble fertilizer with a balanced NPK ratio, adjusting based on the plant's growth stage.

**II. Pest Management (If Pests are Identified as the Cause):**

Pests like thrips and mites can damage developing buds and flowers, leading to their dropping or malformation. Regular scouting is essential.

*   **Thrips:** These tiny insects feed on young buds and flowers, causing distortion and premature dropping.
    *   For control, spray with:
        *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL @ 0.5-0.75 ml/L of water.
        *   **Fipronil** 5% SC @ 1.5-2 ml/L of water.
        *   **Spinosad** 45% SC @ 0.25-0.3 ml/L of water.
        *   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP @ 0.2-0.3 g/L of water.
*   **Mites (e.g., Two-spotted spider mites):** Severe mite infestations can weaken the plant, leading to stress and flower drop.
    *   For control, spray with:
        *   **Spiromesifen** 22.9% SC @ 0.5-0.75 ml/L of water.
        *   **Fenpyroximate** 5% SC @ 1-1.5 ml/L of water.

**III. Disease Management (If Diseases are Identified as the Cause):**

Diseases, especially those affecting the roots or vascular system, can severely stress the plant and lead to wilting and flower drop.

*   **Root Rot (e.g., Phytophthora, Pythium):** Caused by overwatering and poor drainage, leading to root damage and inability to absorb water and nutrients.
    *   Improve drainage and reduce overwatering.
    *   For chemical control, drench the soil with:
        *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride** 72.2% SL @ 2-3 ml/L of water.
        *   **Fosetyl-aluminium** 80% WP @ 2-2.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Metalaxyl-M + Mancozeb** (e.g., 4% + 64% WP) @ 2-2.5 g/L of water.
*   **Botrytis Blight (Grey Mould):** Can affect flowers directly, especially in high humidity conditions, leading to rotting and dropping.
    *   Improve air circulation and reduce humidity.
    *   Remove affected plant parts.
    *   For chemical control, spray with:
        *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP @ 1-1.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC @ 0.5-1 ml/L of water.
        *   **Pyraclostrobin + Boscalid** (e.g., 12.8% + 25.2% WG) @ 1-1.5 g/L of water.

Always ensure proper diagnosis of the underlying cause before applying any chemical treatment. Follow label instructions carefully for dosage, safety precautions, and pre-harvest intervals.
