As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), here is the scientifically verified advice regarding the suitable climate, soil type, and drainage requirements for Gerbera cultivation in Haryana:

### Suitable Climate for Gerbera

Gerbera thrives in a moderate climate, making protected cultivation (polyhouse or greenhouse) highly recommended in Haryana to mitigate extreme temperatures.

*   **Temperature:**
    *   **Day Temperature:** Optimal range is 20-25°C. Temperatures above 30°C can lead to flower quality deterioration and reduced yield.
    *   **Night Temperature:** Optimal range is 12-15°C. Temperatures below 10°C can stunt growth and flowering.
*   **Relative Humidity:** An ideal range of 50-60% is preferred. High humidity can increase the risk of fungal diseases, while very low humidity can cause leaf scorching.
*   **Light:** Gerbera requires bright light for good flowering.
    *   **Light Intensity:** 400-600 W/m² (or 40,000-60,000 lux) is optimal.
    *   **Day Length:** Long day conditions (10-12 hours of light) promote flowering. In Haryana's intense summer, shading might be necessary in polyhouses to prevent scorching.

### Suitable Soil Type for Gerbera

Gerbera requires a well-structured soil that provides good aeration and water retention without becoming waterlogged.

*   **Texture:** Loamy to sandy loam soils are ideal. These textures allow for good root penetration and aeration. Heavy clay soils should be avoided or amended significantly.
*   **Organic Matter:** The soil should be rich in organic matter (at least 10-15%). This improves soil structure, water holding capacity, and nutrient availability.
*   **pH:** An slightly acidic to neutral soil pH is preferred, with an optimal range of 5.5 to 6.5.
*   **Salinity:** Gerbera is sensitive to high soil salinity. Electrical Conductivity (EC) of the soil should ideally be below 1.0 dS/m.

### Drainage Requirement for Gerbera

Excellent drainage is paramount for Gerbera cultivation to prevent root diseases.

*   **Well-Drained Soil:** Gerbera roots are highly susceptible to root rot diseases if subjected to waterlogging. The soil must allow for rapid percolation of excess water.
*   **Raised Beds:** Cultivating Gerbera on raised beds (typically 30-45 cm high) is highly recommended, especially in areas with heavy soils or a high water table, to ensure superior drainage and aeration around the root zone.
*   **Substrate:** In protected cultivation, soilless media like coco peat, perlite, vermiculite, or a mixture thereof, are often used due to their excellent drainage and aeration properties, along with precise nutrient control.
*   **Avoid Waterlogging:** Any condition leading to standing water around the plant base must be strictly avoided. This includes proper grading of the land and efficient irrigation management.
