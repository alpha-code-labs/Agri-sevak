Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling sucking pests in Gerbera.

Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips are indeed common and damaging sucking pests of Gerbera, causing direct damage by feeding and indirect damage by transmitting viral diseases.

Regarding Psylla (psyllids), **this is not known to affect Gerbera significantly.**

Effective control of these sucking pests requires an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods.

### Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Sucking Pests in Gerbera:

1.  **Monitoring:**
    *   Regularly inspect plants, especially the undersides of leaves and new shoots, for the presence of pests.
    *   Use yellow sticky traps (10-15 traps per acre) to monitor adult whiteflies, leafhoppers, and thrips. Replace traps every 10-15 days.

2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infested plant parts and weeds, which can act as alternate hosts for pests.
    *   **Water Management:** Avoid water stress, as stressed plants are more susceptible.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Provide balanced nutrition. Excessive nitrogen can lead to lush growth, making plants more attractive to sucking pests.
    *   **Pruning:** Remove old, senescent leaves to reduce hiding places for pests.
    *   **Reflective Mulches:** Silver-colored plastic mulches can deter thrips and whiteflies.

3.  **Physical Barriers:**
    *   In protected cultivation (polyhouses/net houses), use insect-proof nets (40-50 mesh) on vents and doors to prevent pest entry.

4.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Encourage natural enemies like ladybird beetles, lacewings, and parasitic wasps (e.g., *Encarsia formosa* for whiteflies). Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

### Chemical Control (Use only when pest populations exceed economic threshold levels and rotate chemicals to prevent resistance):

Always ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves. Spray during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening). Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and spraying.

Here are CIBRC approved technical chemical names and their recommended dosages:

*   **For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips:**
    *   **Imidacloprid** (17.8% SL formulation): 0.5 - 0.75 ml/L of water.
    *   **Acetamiprid** (20% SP formulation): 0.2 - 0.4 g/L of water.
    *   **Thiamethoxam** (25% WG formulation): 0.2 - 0.4 g/L of water.
    *   **Fipronil** (5% SC formulation): 1.0 - 1.5 ml/L of water (particularly effective against thrips and leafhoppers).
    *   **Spirotetramat** (150 OD formulation): 0.5 - 0.75 ml/L of water (systemic, effective against a broad range of sucking pests).

*   **For Whiteflies and Leafhoppers (Insect Growth Regulators):**
    *   **Buprofezin** (25% SC formulation): 1.0 - 1.25 ml/L of water (targets nymphs, good for resistance management).

*   **For Aphids and Whiteflies (Specific Action):**
    *   **Pymetrozine** (50% WG formulation): 0.3 - 0.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Flonicamid** (50% WG formulation): 0.3 - 0.4 g/L of water (highly specific for aphids).

*   **For Whiteflies, Thrips, and Mites:**
    *   **Diafenthiuron** (50% WP formulation): 0.6 - 1.0 g/L of water.

*   **Botanical Insecticides (for early infestation or as a rotation partner):**
    *   **Azadirachtin** (Neem oil based, e.g., 1500 ppm formulation): 3 - 5 ml/L of water.

**Important Note on Resistance Management:**
To prevent the development of pesticide resistance, it is crucial to rotate insecticides with different modes of action. Do not use the same chemical group repeatedly. Consult the label for specific instructions and safety precautions before use.
