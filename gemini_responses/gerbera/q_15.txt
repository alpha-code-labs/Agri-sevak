As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in Gerbera cultivation in Haryana:

1.  **Grasshopper:**
    Grasshoppers are generalist feeders and can cause damage to Gerbera foliage, especially young leaves and shoots.

    *   **Cultural Control:** Regular weeding around the Gerbera beds can reduce hiding places for grasshoppers.
    *   **Chemical Control:** In case of significant infestation, the following CIBRC approved insecticides can be used:
        *   **Malathion 50 EC**: Apply at 2.5 ml per litre of water as a foliar spray.
        *   **Cypermethrin 25 EC**: Apply at 0.4-0.5 ml per litre of water as a foliar spray.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5 EC**: Apply at 0.2-0.25 ml per litre of water as a foliar spray.

2.  **Painted bug (Bagrada hilaris):**
    This is not known to affect Gerbera. Painted bug is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., mustard, cabbage).

3.  **Red cotton bug (Dysdercus cingulatus):**
    This is not known to affect Gerbera. Red cotton bug is primarily a pest of cotton and other malvaceous plants, feeding on developing seeds.

4.  **Black ants:**
    Black ants are generally not direct pests of Gerbera by feeding on the plant itself. However, they are often associated with other sucking pests like aphids, mealybugs, and scale insects, which they "farm" for their honeydew. Their presence can indicate an underlying sucking pest problem, or they might disturb roots or feed on sweet exudates.

    *   **Integrated Management:**
        *   **Control Sucking Pests:** The most effective way to manage ants is to control the honeydew-producing sucking pests (aphids, mealybugs) that attract them.
        *   **Sanitation:** Keep the area around Gerbera plants clean and free of debris.
    *   **Chemical Control (for direct ant control if problematic):**
        *   **Fipronil 5 SC**: Apply at 1.5 ml per litre of water as a drench around ant nests or along ant trails.
        *   **Fipronil 0.3 GR**: Apply at 10 kg per acre as a broadcast application in infested areas, or localized application around the base of plants where ants are active.
