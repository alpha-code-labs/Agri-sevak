"Drying up" in Guinea Grass, manifesting as drying branches, leaves, and inflorescences, is a general symptom indicating stress rather than a specific disease. It is crucial to accurately diagnose the underlying cause to implement effective management strategies. Guinea Grass is known to be affected by conditions that lead to such symptoms.

Here's how to address drying up in Guinea Grass:

**I. Diagnosis – Identifying the Root Cause:**

Before applying any treatment, it is essential to determine why the plants are drying up. Observe the following:

*   **Pattern of Drying:** Is it affecting individual plants, patches, or the entire field? Is it sudden or gradual?
*   **Soil Moisture:** Dig a few inches into the soil. Is it excessively dry, waterlogged, or compacted?
*   **Root Health:** Carefully uproot a few affected plants. Examine the roots for discoloration (brown/black), rotting, galls (swellings), or lesions. Healthy roots are typically white and fibrous.
*   **Leaf Examination:** Look for any specific spots, lesions, insect feeding damage, or unusual discoloration beyond general drying.
*   **Recent Activities:** Consider recent weather patterns (drought, heatwave), herbicide application in or near the field, or changes in irrigation schedule.

**II. Potential Causes and Management Strategies:**

Based on your diagnosis, the drying up can be attributed to several factors:

**A. Abiotic Stresses (Most Common Causes):**

1.  **Water Stress (Drought):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Leaves roll inwards, turn yellow or brown, and dry progressively from the tips and margins. The entire plant may wilt and eventually dry out if water scarcity persists.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Irrigation:** Provide timely and adequate irrigation, especially during dry periods and critical growth stages. Guinea grass, while relatively drought-tolerant, requires sufficient moisture for optimal growth and yield.
        *   **Soil Moisture Conservation:** Implement practices like mulching with crop residues to reduce evaporation and improve water retention. Ensure proper land leveling and preparation to enhance water infiltration.

2.  **Nutrient Deficiencies:**
    *   **Symptoms:** General yellowing (chlorosis), stunted growth, and premature drying of older leaves can indicate deficiencies, particularly Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), or Potassium (K). Potassium deficiency specifically can cause marginal scorching and drying of leaves.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Soil Testing:** Conduct a comprehensive soil test to identify specific nutrient deficiencies. This is the most accurate way to determine fertilizer requirements.
        *   **Balanced Fertilization:** Apply fertilizers based on soil test recommendations. For general maintenance or if soil testing is not immediately feasible, a balanced approach can be considered:
            *   **Nitrogen:** Apply **Urea** (46% N) at 40-60 kg/acre in split doses.
            *   **Phosphorus:** Apply **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5) at 20-30 kg/acre or **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5) at 60-90 kg/acre at sowing/planting.
            *   **Potassium:** Apply **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** (60% K2O) at 15-20 kg/acre at sowing/planting, especially if soil tests indicate low levels.
        *   **Micronutrients:** If specific micronutrient deficiencies are identified through soil testing, apply appropriate micronutrient mixtures as foliar sprays or soil application.

3.  **Heat Stress:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Similar to drought stress, leaves may scorch, turn brown, and dry out, particularly during prolonged periods of high temperatures.
    *   **Management:** Ensure adequate water supply to help plants cope with high temperatures.

**B. Biotic Stresses (Less Common for Widespread Drying, but Possible):**

1.  **Root Rots (e.g., caused by *Rhizoctonia solani*, *Fusarium* spp.):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Wilting, yellowing, stunted growth, and eventual drying of the entire plant. Roots appear discolored (brown/black), soft, or rotted.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural Practices:** Improve soil drainage, avoid waterlogging, and practice crop rotation with non-host crops.
        *   **Chemical Control (if diagnosed and severe):**
            *   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds before sowing with **Carbendazim** at 2 g/kg seed or **Thiram** at 2.5 g/kg seed.
            *   **Soil Drench (for established plants):** If root rot is confirmed in patches, drench the affected area with **Carbendazim** at 1 g/L water.

2.  **Nematodes (e.g., Root-knot nematodes - *Meloidogyne* spp.):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, yellowing, wilting, and poor nutrient uptake leading to drying. Roots may show characteristic galls (knots) or lesions.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural Practices:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops (e.g., marigold), use resistant varieties if available, and incorporate organic matter like **Neem cake** at 200-400 kg/acre during land preparation to suppress nematode populations.
        *   **Chemical Control:** For severe infestations, consult with a local HAU expert for specific recommendations on CIBRC-approved nematicides, as their use requires careful consideration and precise application. General recommendations for highly toxic nematicides are avoided without specific field diagnosis.

**Important Note:** Always follow the instructions on the product label for dosage, application method, and safety precautions when using any chemical. For precise recommendations tailored to your specific field conditions, it is advisable to consult with the agricultural experts at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU), Hisar.
