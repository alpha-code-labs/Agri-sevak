As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following doses of organic manures for Guinea Grass, based on scientific principles and practices suitable for Haryana's agro-climatic conditions:

*   **Farm Yard Manure (FYM):**
    *   **Dose:** 10-15 tonnes per acre.
    *   **Application:** Apply thoroughly mixed with the soil during land preparation, approximately 2-3 weeks before planting/sowing. For established perennial Guinea Grass, it can be applied annually or biennially, incorporated into the soil or spread as a top dressing, preferably before the monsoon or during the cooler months.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   **Dose:** 2-5 tonnes per acre.
    *   **Application:** Apply thoroughly mixed with the soil during land preparation, similar to FYM. For established perennial Guinea Grass, it can be applied annually, incorporated into the soil or spread as a top dressing. Due to its higher nutrient concentration and microbial activity, a lower dose of vermicompost is generally sufficient compared to FYM.

*   **Sagarika:**
    *   **Nature:** Sagarika (e.g., IFFCO Sagarika) is a seaweed extract-based bio-stimulant and plant growth promoter, not a bulk organic manure like FYM or vermicompost. It is rich in natural plant hormones, micronutrients, and amino acids, which enhance nutrient uptake, promote root development, improve stress tolerance, and boost overall plant vigour and yield.
    *   **Application Method & Dose:**
        *   **Foliar Spray:** 250-500 ml per acre, diluted in 150-200 litres of water. Apply at critical growth stages, such as 20-30 days after planting/cutting, and again 20-30 days later, or as per crop requirement.
        *   **Soil Drench/Drip Irrigation:** 1-2 litres per acre, mixed with irrigation water. Apply during active growth phases to enhance root zone activity and nutrient availability.
