As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling soil pests like termites and root-knot nematodes in Guinea Grass in Haryana.

Both termites and root-knot nematodes are significant soil pests that can severely impact the growth and yield of Guinea Grass by damaging roots, leading to stunted growth, yellowing, wilting, and reduced fodder production.

### **1. Control of Termites (Isoptera)**

Termites attack the roots and stem base of Guinea Grass, especially young plants, leading to wilting and plant death.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Ensure proper field sanitation by removing dead wood, stubble, and other organic debris that can serve as termite food sources or nesting sites.
    *   Deep ploughing during summer can expose termite colonies to predators and desiccation.
*   **Chemical Control (Pre-planting Soil Treatment):**
    *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC**: Apply 2.0 - 4.0 litres per acre, mixed with 200-400 litres of water, and drench the soil thoroughly before planting or during the last ploughing.
    *   **Fipronil 0.3% GR**: Apply 10-20 kg per acre, broadcast evenly and incorporate into the soil during land preparation.
*   **Chemical Control (Post-planting for existing infestation):**
    *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC**: Drench the base of affected plants with a solution of 2.0 - 4.0 litres per acre mixed in 500-1000 litres of water. Ensure the solution penetrates the root zone.

### **2. Control of Nematodes (Root-knot nematodes - *Meloidogyne* spp.)**

Root-knot nematodes cause characteristic galls or swellings on the roots, impairing the plant's ability to absorb water and nutrients, leading to poor growth and reduced fodder quality.

*   **Cultural and Biological Control (Recommended as the primary approach for sustainable management):**
    *   **Soil Solarization:** In summer, after preparing the field, irrigate it thoroughly and then cover the moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets (25-100 micron thickness) for 4-6 weeks. This raises soil temperature sufficiently to kill nematodes and other soil-borne pathogens.
    *   **Organic Matter Addition:** Incorporate well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost (10-15 tonnes per acre) into the soil. This improves soil health, enhances water retention, and promotes beneficial microbial activity that can naturally suppress nematode populations.
    *   **Bio-nematicides:**
        *   **_Purpureocillium lilacinum_ (formerly _Paecilomyces lilacinus_)**: Apply 2.5 - 5 kg per acre, mixed with 100 kg of FYM or compost, and broadcast evenly before planting or as a drench around existing plants. This fungus parasitizes nematode eggs and females.
        *   **_Trichoderma viride_ / _Trichoderma harzianum_**: Apply 2.5 - 5 kg per acre, mixed with 100 kg of FYM or compost, and broadcast evenly before planting or as a drench. These fungi act as antagonists to various soil-borne pathogens, including some nematodes.
*   **Chemical Control (Use with caution and only if severe infestation, after consulting local experts):**
    *   Dedicated chemical nematicides for fodder crops often have residue concerns and specific CIBRC approvals are critical. For general soil pest management that can offer some suppression of nematodes:
        *   **Fipronil 0.3% GR**: Apply 10-20 kg per acre, broadcast and incorporate into the soil before planting. While primarily an insecticide, it has shown some efficacy against certain nematode species and can be part of an integrated approach for managing soil pest complexes.

### **Important Considerations and Precautions:**

*   **Integrated Pest Management (IPM):** Always adopt an IPM approach, combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods for sustainable and effective pest control.
*   **Label Instructions:** Always read and strictly follow the label instructions of any pesticide for dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest intervals (PHI).
*   **Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):** Wear appropriate PPE (gloves, mask, protective clothing) during handling and application of any chemical pesticide.
*   **Residue Management:** For fodder crops, observing the correct pre-harvest interval is crucial to avoid chemical residues in the feed.
*   **Consultation:** For specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and the severity of infestation, it is highly advisable to consult your local agricultural extension officer at HAU or the nearest Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK).
