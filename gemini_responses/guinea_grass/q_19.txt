Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice to address macro-nutrient deficiencies in Guinea Grass (Panicum maximum) in Haryana.

The most crucial first step in addressing any nutrient deficiency is a **soil test**. This provides precise information on the existing nutrient status of your soil, allowing for targeted and efficient fertilizer application, preventing both under-application and over-application, which can be detrimental to plant health and the environment.

Here's how to address Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K) deficiencies in Guinea Grass:

### General Recommendations for Guinea Grass in Haryana:

For optimal growth and yield of Guinea Grass, general nutrient recommendations, in the absence of a soil test, are typically around:
*   **Nitrogen (N):** 80-120 kg N per acre per year
*   **Phosphorus (P2O5):** 40-60 kg P2O5 per acre per year
*   **Potassium (K2O):** 30-40 kg K2O per acre per year (apply only if soil test indicates deficiency or for very high yielding varieties)

These quantities should be adjusted based on soil test results, crop intensity, and expected yield.

### Addressing Specific Macro-nutrient Deficiencies:

#### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency:

*   **Symptoms:** General yellowing or pale green colour of older leaves, stunted growth, reduced tillering, and overall poor vigour.
*   **Correction:** Nitrogen is highly mobile in the plant and soil, so split applications are most effective.
    *   **Recommended Chemical:** **Urea** (46% N)
    *   **Dosage:**
        *   **Basal Application:** Apply 25-30 kg **Urea** per acre at the time of planting/sowing.
        *   **Top Dressing:** Apply 25-30 kg **Urea** per acre after each cut (typically 3-4 cuts per year depending on management and variety). This ensures continuous supply for regrowth.
    *   **Method:** Broadcast evenly and incorporate into the soil, or apply near the root zone. Ensure irrigation after application if rain is not expected, to move the nutrient into the root zone and minimize volatilization losses.

#### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency:

*   **Symptoms:** Dark green or purplish discoloration of older leaves, stunted growth, poor root development, and delayed maturity. Phosphorus is less mobile in the plant and soil.
*   **Correction:** Phosphorus should ideally be applied as a basal dose, as it moves slowly in the soil.
    *   **Recommended Chemicals:**
        *   **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5)
        *   **Single Superphosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5)
    *   **Dosage:**
        *   If using **Diammonium Phosphate**: Apply 85-130 kg **Diammonium Phosphate** per acre as a basal dose.
        *   If using **Single Superphosphate**: Apply 250-375 kg **Single Superphosphate** per acre as a basal dose.
    *   **Method:** Apply the entire quantity as a basal dose, broadcasting evenly and incorporating thoroughly into the soil before planting or sowing. This ensures phosphorus is available in the root zone as the plant develops.

#### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency:

*   **Symptoms:** Yellowing and browning (scorching) of leaf margins, especially on older leaves, weak stems leading to lodging, reduced disease resistance, and poor overall plant vigour.
*   **Correction:** Potassium is moderately mobile in the soil.
    *   **Recommended Chemical:** **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** (60% K2O)
    *   **Dosage:** If soil test indicates deficiency, apply 50-65 kg **Muriate of Potash** per acre as a basal dose. For very high yielding systems, a split application (half basal, half after first cut) may be considered.
    *   **Method:** Broadcast evenly and incorporate into the soil before planting or sowing.

### Integrated Nutrient Management (INM):

For sustainable and efficient nutrient management, always integrate chemical fertilizers with organic sources:

*   **Farm Yard Manure (FYM) / Compost:** Apply 10-15 tonnes of well-decomposed FYM or compost per acre every 2-3 years. This improves soil structure, water retention, and provides a slow release of all macro and micronutrients.
*   **Biofertilizers:** Consider using biofertilizers like Azotobacter or Azospirillum (for nitrogen fixation) and Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria (PSB) (for phosphorus availability) as seed treatment or soil application. These can supplement nutrient supply and reduce reliance on chemical fertilizers.

Always remember that a proactive approach with regular soil testing is the most effective way to maintain soil fertility and ensure healthy, productive Guinea Grass stands.
