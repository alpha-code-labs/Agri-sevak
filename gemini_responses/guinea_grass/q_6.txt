As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling viral diseases in Guinea Grass (Panicum maximum) in Haryana.

Firstly, regarding one of the diseases you mentioned:

*   **Tristeza:** This is not known to affect Guinea Grass. Citrus Tristeza Virus (CTV) primarily affects citrus species.

For the other viral diseases you listed (Leaf curl, Mosaic, Yellow vein clearing, Stripe, and Stunt virus), it is important to understand that there is no direct chemical cure for viral infections in plants once they are established. Control strategies focus primarily on prevention, managing insect vectors, and cultural practices.

Here's how to control these viral diseases in Guinea Grass:

1.  **Use Disease-Free Planting Material:**
    *   Always source seeds or vegetative cuttings from certified, disease-free nurseries or fields. This is the most critical step to prevent the introduction of viruses.

2.  **Vector Management (Insect Control):**
    *   Most plant viruses are transmitted by insect vectors such as aphids, whiteflies, leafhoppers, and thrips. Controlling these vectors is crucial to prevent the spread of the disease.
    *   **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your Guinea Grass fields for the presence of these insect pests.
    *   **Chemical Control (as a last resort and when vector populations are high):** Apply CIBRC approved insecticides targeting the specific vectors. Always follow label instructions for dosage and safety.
        *   For Aphids, Whiteflies, and Leafhoppers:
            *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at 125-150 ml per acre in 200-300 litres of water.
            *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at 50-100 g per acre in 200-300 litres of water.
            *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply at 50-100 g per acre in 200-300 litres of water.
            *   **Fipronil 5% SC:** Apply at 400-600 ml per acre in 200-300 litres of water, particularly effective against leafhoppers and thrips.

3.  **Rouging and Sanitation:**
    *   Promptly identify and remove (rogue out) any plants showing symptoms of viral infection (e.g., yellowing, stunting, leaf distortion). Destroy these infected plants away from the field to prevent further spread.
    *   Sanitize tools and equipment after working with infected plants to avoid mechanical transmission.

4.  **Weed Management:**
    *   Many weeds can act as alternative hosts for viruses and their insect vectors. Keep the Guinea Grass field and surrounding areas free of weeds.

5.  **Nutrient and Water Management:**
    *   Ensure the Guinea Grass plants receive adequate and balanced nutrition and water. Healthy, vigorous plants are generally more resilient and can better tolerate stress, although this does not confer immunity to viruses.

6.  **Crop Rotation (if applicable):**
    *   While Guinea Grass is often grown as a perennial, if you are establishing new plots, consider rotating with non-host crops to break the disease cycle, especially if viral issues have been persistent in the past.

7.  **Resistant Varieties:**
    *   If available and suitable for the Haryana agro-climatic conditions, choose Guinea Grass varieties known to have resistance or tolerance to common viral diseases. Consult with HAU experts for recommendations on specific varieties.

Remember, integrated pest management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods, is the most effective strategy for long-term viral disease control.
