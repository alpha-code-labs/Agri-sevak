As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified practices for the ideal transplantation of Guinea Grass (Panicum maximum) in Haryana:

### Ideal Transplantation Time

*   **Monsoon Season:** The most opportune time for transplanting Guinea Grass slips in Haryana is during the onset of the monsoon, typically from **July to early August**. This period ensures sufficient soil moisture for successful establishment and reduces the need for frequent irrigation.
*   **With Irrigation:** If assured irrigation facilities are available, transplantation can also be carried out in **late June** or even **September-October**. However, establishment during these periods will require more intensive irrigation management.

### Ideal Transplantation Distance

*   For optimal fodder yield and plant development, the recommended spacing for Guinea Grass slips is:
    *   **Row-to-row distance:** 50 cm
    *   **Plant-to-plant distance:** 50 cm
    *   This spacing allows for good tillering, adequate light penetration, and ease of inter-cultural operations.

### Transplantation Process

1.  **Preparation of Planting Material:**
    *   Select healthy, well-rooted slips (tillers with 2-3 nodes and a good root system) from 2-3 month old established Guinea Grass clumps.
    *   Trim the leaves of the slips to about 15-20 cm in length to reduce transpiration and minimize transplant shock.

2.  **Field Preparation:**
    *   Plough the field thoroughly to a depth of 20-25 cm.
    *   Harrow the land 2-3 times to achieve a fine and uniform tilth.
    *   Level the field properly to ensure even distribution of water and nutrients.
    *   Prepare furrows or mark out the planting grid according to the recommended spacing (50 cm x 50 cm).

3.  **Planting:**
    *   Dig small pits or make holes at the marked spacing.
    *   Place one prepared slip per pit, ensuring that the roots are well spread and the crown (base of the stem) is at ground level.
    *   Cover the roots with soil and gently firm the soil around the slip to ensure good soil-root contact and eliminate air pockets.
    *   Planting should ideally be done on a cloudy day or in the late afternoon to reduce stress on the slips.

4.  **Post-Transplantation Care:**
    *   **Irrigation:** Immediately after planting, provide a light irrigation, especially if there is no rain. Subsequent irrigations should be given as needed to maintain adequate soil moisture, which is crucial for the initial establishment phase.
    *   **Weeding:** Control weeds effectively during the first 4-6 weeks after transplantation, as they compete strongly with young Guinea Grass plants for nutrients, water, and sunlight.
    *   **Fertilization:** A basal application of fertilizer at the time of field preparation or planting can significantly aid establishment. A general recommendation is 20 kg Nitrogen, 40 kg Phosphorus, and 20 kg Potassium per acre. Subsequent top-dressing with Nitrogen will be required for sustained high yields.
