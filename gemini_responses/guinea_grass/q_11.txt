As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies in Guinea Grass (Panicum maximum) in Haryana.

It is important to note that while various insects may occasionally feed on Guinea Grass, only certain pests are known to cause significant economic damage warranting specific control measures.

### Control of Beetles in Guinea Grass

The most significant beetle pests affecting Guinea Grass in our region are typically the larvae of scarab beetles, commonly known as **White Grubs**. These grubs feed on the roots, leading to severe damage.

**Symptoms of White Grub Infestation:**
*   Patchy yellowing and wilting of grass.
*   Stunted growth.
*   Plants can be easily pulled out from the soil due to damaged roots.
*   Presence of C-shaped, creamy-white grubs in the soil around the roots.

**Control Measures for White Grubs:**

1.  **Cultural Control:**
    *   **Deep Ploughing:** During summer fallow periods, deep ploughing exposes grubs and pupae to the sun, birds, and other predators, reducing their population.
    *   **Light Traps:** Adult beetles (which lay eggs) are attracted to light. Setting up light traps during their emergence period (often after the first monsoon rains) can help in mass trapping and reducing the adult population.

2.  **Chemical Control:**
    For effective control of white grubs, soil application of CIBRC-approved insecticides is recommended. These should be applied at the time of planting or as a top dressing and incorporated into the soil, followed by light irrigation.

    *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% G** at 10-12.5 kg/acre.
    *   **Fipronil 0.3% G** at 25-33 kg/acre.

    **Application Method:** Broadcast the granules evenly over the infested area and lightly incorporate them into the soil, followed by irrigation to ensure the chemical reaches the root zone where grubs are active.

### Control of Weevils in Guinea Grass

This is not known to affect Guinea Grass significantly to warrant specific chemical control measures. While some generalist weevils might occasionally be observed, they are not recognized as major economic pests of Guinea Grass in Haryana.

### Control of Sawflies in Guinea Grass

This is not known to affect Guinea Grass. Sawflies are not reported as pests of Guinea Grass in our region.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully, including dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Observe the recommended pre-harvest interval (PHI) for fodder crops to ensure the safety of livestock.
*   For specific field conditions and pest identification, it is always advisable to consult with local agricultural extension officers or HAU experts.
