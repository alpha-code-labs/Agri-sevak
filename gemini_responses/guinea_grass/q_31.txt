As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the conditions you've mentioned for Guinea Grass (Panicum maximum):

1.  **Fruit bursting and Hardness in fruit:**
    This is not known to affect Guinea Grass. Guinea Grass is a forage crop primarily grown for its leaves and stems, not for fleshy fruits. The plant produces seeds, which naturally harden as they mature.

2.  **Leaf burning/melting:**
    Leaf burning or melting in Guinea Grass is typically a symptom of environmental stress or improper management practices rather than a specific disease or pest. Control measures focus on mitigating these stresses:

    *   **Water Stress (Drought or Waterlogging):**
        *   **Adequate Irrigation:** Ensure timely and sufficient irrigation, especially during dry periods. Guinea grass is relatively drought-tolerant once established but performs best with adequate moisture.
        *   **Drainage:** Ensure proper field drainage to prevent waterlogging, which can also cause root damage and leaf symptoms.

    *   **Heat Stress:**
        *   **Variety Selection:** Choose heat-tolerant varieties recommended for Haryana's climate.
        *   **Mulching:** Applying organic mulch can help regulate soil temperature and retain moisture.

    *   **Nutrient Imbalance/Deficiency/Toxicity:**
        *   **Soil Testing:** Conduct regular soil tests to determine nutrient status and pH.
        *   **Balanced Fertilization:** Apply fertilizers based on soil test recommendations. Deficiencies (e.g., potassium) or toxicities (e.g., boron, salinity) can manifest as leaf burn.
        *   **Avoid Over-fertilization:** Excessive application of certain fertilizers, especially nitrogen, can sometimes lead to salt burn if not watered in properly.

    *   **Chemical Burn:**
        *   **Careful Herbicide Application:** Ensure herbicides are applied correctly, at recommended rates, and avoid drift onto Guinea grass from adjacent fields.
        *   **Proper Fertilizer Application:** Avoid direct contact of concentrated chemical fertilizers with leaves, especially during hot weather. Apply granular fertilizers to the soil and water them in.

    *   **Salinity Stress:**
        *   **Soil and Water Quality Testing:** If growing in areas with known salinity issues, test soil and irrigation water for salt content.
        *   **Salinity Management:** Implement practices like using salt-tolerant varieties, improving drainage, and applying soil amendments like gypsum (if recommended by soil test) to manage soil salinity.

    *   **Frost Damage:**
        *   **Variety Selection:** Choose varieties with better cold tolerance if frost is a recurring issue in your area.
        *   **Irrigation before Frost:** A light irrigation before an anticipated frost can sometimes help by increasing soil heat capacity.

By addressing these underlying causes through good agronomic practices, leaf burning/melting in Guinea Grass can be effectively managed.
