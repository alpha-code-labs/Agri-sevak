As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling weeds in Guinea Grass (Panicum maximum) in Haryana. Effective weed management is crucial, especially during the establishment phase of Guinea Grass, to ensure vigorous growth and high fodder yield.

**Integrated Weed Management (IWM) Approach:**
A holistic approach combining cultural, mechanical, and chemical methods is recommended for sustainable weed control.

**I. General Weed Management Practices:**

1.  **Thorough Land Preparation:** Deep ploughing and harrowing before planting help to reduce the initial weed seed bank.
2.  **Use Clean Planting Material:** Ensure that Guinea Grass seeds or slips are free from weed seeds, especially parasitic weeds like Amarbail.
3.  **Optimal Planting:** Plant Guinea Grass at the recommended spacing and depth to ensure quick establishment and canopy closure, which helps suppress weeds through competition.
4.  **Timely Irrigation and Fertilization:** Proper nutrient and water management promotes strong Guinea Grass growth, enhancing its competitive ability against weeds.
5.  **Critical Period for Weed Control:** The first 30-45 days after planting/sowing are most critical for weed control in Guinea Grass.

**II. Specific Weed Control Recommendations:**

**1. Orobanche (Broomrape):**
*   This is not known to affect Guinea Grass. Orobanche species are parasitic weeds primarily on dicotyledonous crops (e.g., mustard, tobacco, pulses), not monocots like Guinea Grass.

**2. Phalaris minor (Gulli Danda):**
*   While primarily a weed of wheat, it can emerge in Guinea Grass fields, especially during establishment if the field has a history of infestation. Post-emergence chemical control in Guinea Grass is challenging due to its grass nature.
*   **Pre-emergence Application:**
    *   Apply **Pendimethalin** (30% EC) at 1.0 kg a.i./acre (approximately 3.3 L of product) in 200-300 L of water within 3 days of sowing or planting Guinea Grass. Ensure adequate soil moisture for effective action.

**3. Amarbail (Cuscuta spp. - Dodder):**
*   Amarbail is a parasitic weed that can severely affect fodder crops. Prevention is key.
*   **Preventive Measures:**
    *   Use only certified, Amarbail-free Guinea Grass seeds/slips.
    *   Avoid feeding Amarbail-infested fodder to livestock in the field, as seeds can spread through manure.
*   **Mechanical Control:**
    *   Hand-pulling and removal of Amarbail patches before they flower and set seed is highly effective for localized infestations. Burn or bury the removed material away from the field.
*   **Chemical Control (Pre-emergence):**
    *   **Pendimethalin** (30% EC) at 1.0 kg a.i./acre (approximately 3.3 L of product) in 200-300 L of water, applied within 3 days of sowing/planting, can offer some suppression of Amarbail emergence.
*   **Spot Application (Extreme Cases, with Caution):**
    *   For isolated, severe patches, a directed spot spray of **Paraquat dichloride** (24% SL) at 5-7 ml/L of water can be used. Extreme care must be taken to avoid contact with Guinea Grass, as it is a non-selective herbicide.

**4. Broadleaf Weeds (including Bathu, Congress Grass):**
*   These weeds are common during the establishment phase and can compete significantly with young Guinea Grass plants.
*   **Post-emergence Application:** Apply when weeds are at the 2-4 leaf stage (typically 20-25 days after sowing/planting Guinea Grass).
    *   **2,4-D Sodium salt** (80% WP) at 0.5 kg a.i./acre (approximately 625 g of product) in 200-300 L of water.
    *   **2,4-D Amine salt** (58% SL) at 0.5 kg a.i./acre (approximately 860 ml of product) in 200-300 L of water.
    *   **Metribuzin** (70% WP) at 0.25-0.35 kg a.i./acre (approximately 350-500 g of product) in 200-300 L of water.
    *   **Atrazine** (50% WP) at 0.5-1.0 kg a.i./acre (approximately 1.0-2.0 kg of product) in 200-300 L of water. This can be applied as pre-emergence or early post-emergence (within 7 days of planting) for broadleaf and some annual grass weeds.

**5. Narrowleaf Weeds (Annual Grasses):**
*   These are primarily problematic during the establishment phase. Once Guinea Grass is well-established, its dense canopy usually suppresses most annual grass weeds.
*   **Pre-emergence Application:**
    *   **Pendimethalin** (30% EC) at 1.0 kg a.i./acre (approximately 3.3 L of product) in 200-300 L of water, applied within 3 days of sowing or planting Guinea Grass.
    *   **Atrazine** (50% WP) at 0.5-1.0 kg a.i./acre (approximately 1.0-2.0 kg of product) in 200-300 L of water, applied as pre-emergence or early post-emergence (within 7 days of planting).

**III. Important Considerations for Herbicide Application:**

*   **Timing:** Adhere strictly to the recommended application timings for optimal efficacy and crop safety.
*   **Soil Moisture:** Ensure adequate soil moisture, especially for pre-emergence herbicides, for proper activation.
*   **Spray Volume:** Use the recommended water volume (200-300 L/acre) for uniform coverage.
*   **Nozzle Type:** Use flat fan nozzles for herbicide application to ensure even distribution.
*   **Weather Conditions:** Avoid spraying during windy conditions, extreme temperatures, or when rain is expected within 6-8 hours of application.
*   **Crop Stage:** Ensure Guinea Grass is at the appropriate growth stage for post-emergence applications to prevent phytotoxicity.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including gloves, mask, and protective clothing. Read and follow all instructions on the herbicide label carefully.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate herbicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of herbicide-resistant weed populations.

By implementing these scientifically sound practices, farmers in Haryana can effectively manage weeds in Guinea Grass, leading to healthier crops and higher fodder yields. For any specific field conditions or persistent weed problems, please consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts.
