As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice to protect your Guinea Grass (Panicum maximum) from environmental stresses prevalent in Haryana. Guinea Grass is a tropical fodder grass, generally robust, but susceptible to extremes.

Here's how to manage environmental stress:

### 1. Protection from Extreme Cold and Frost

Guinea Grass is highly sensitive to cold and frost. Temperatures below 5°C can severely inhibit growth, and frost can cause significant damage, browning leaves, and potentially killing the above-ground biomass. Established plants, however, often regrow from the crown if the frost is not prolonged or extremely severe.

*   **Site Selection:** Avoid planting Guinea Grass in low-lying areas or "frost pockets" where cold air tends to settle and accumulate.
*   **Mulching:** Before the onset of winter, apply a thick layer (5-10 cm) of organic mulch such as straw, sugarcane trash, or other crop residues around the base of the plants. This insulates the crown and roots, protecting them from freezing temperatures and aiding in quicker regrowth in spring.
*   **Irrigation:** A light irrigation before a predicted frost event can help raise the soil temperature slightly and release latent heat, offering some minor protection. Ensure good drainage to avoid waterlogging, which can exacerbate cold damage.
*   **Cutting Management:** Avoid cutting the grass too close to the ground just before the onset of winter. Leaving a taller stubble (15-20 cm) can provide some insulation to the crown.
*   **Chemicals:** No specific CIBRC-approved chemical is practically recommended or economically viable for frost protection in Guinea Grass fodder on a large scale.

### 2. Protection from Heat/Loo and Intense Sunlight

Guinea Grass is a C4 plant, inherently efficient in high temperatures and intense sunlight, making it well-adapted to Haryana's summer. However, prolonged periods of extreme heat, especially when accompanied by hot, dry winds (locally known as "Loo") and insufficient moisture, can lead to water stress, wilting, reduced growth, and leaf scorching.

*   **Adequate Irrigation:** This is the most critical measure. Ensure timely and sufficient irrigation during hot periods, especially when Loo winds are prevalent. This helps maintain plant turgor, facilitates evaporative cooling, and supports continuous growth. Consider irrigating in the cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize evaporation loss.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure balanced fertilization, particularly adequate potassium (K). Potassium plays a vital role in regulating stomatal opening and closing, improving water use efficiency, and enhancing the plant's overall tolerance to heat and drought stress.
*   **Cutting Management:** Avoid very close cutting during peak summer heat. Leaving a slightly higher stubble (10-15 cm) can provide some shade to the soil, reduce soil temperature, and minimize direct evaporation from the soil surface.
*   **Chemicals:** No specific CIBRC-approved chemical is practically recommended for heat/Loo protection in Guinea Grass fodder on a large scale, as cultural practices and irrigation are generally sufficient and more economical.
