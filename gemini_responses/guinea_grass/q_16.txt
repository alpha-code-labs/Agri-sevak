As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following fertilizer doses for Guinea Grass (Panicum maximum) in Haryana. Please note that these are general recommendations for medium fertility soils. For precise nutrient management, a soil test is highly recommended to determine specific deficiencies and optimize fertilizer application.

**General Nutrient Targets (per acre per year for multi-cut Guinea Grass):**
*   Nitrogen (N): 100-120 kg
*   Phosphorus (P2O5): 50-60 kg
*   Potassium (K2O): 30-40 kg
*   Sulphur (S): 15-20 kg

**Recommended Fertilizer Doses:**

**1. Basal Application (at planting/sowing, per acre):**
*   **DAP**: 120-130 kg
    *   *(This provides approximately 21-23 kg N and 55-60 kg P2O5)*
*   **Muriate of Potash** (Potash): 60-70 kg
    *   *(This provides approximately 36-42 kg K2O)*
*   **Elemental Sulphur** (90%): 20-25 kg
    *   *(This provides approximately 18-22.5 kg S)*
*   **Urea**: 15-20 kg
    *   *(To supplement the initial Nitrogen requirement)*

**2. Top-dressing (after each cut, typically 4-5 cuts per year, per acre):**
*   **Urea**: 40-50 kg per cut
    *   *(Apply after each cut to ensure continuous vegetative growth and high fodder yield. The total annual Urea for top-dressing would be 160-250 kg depending on the number of cuts.)*

**Alternative for Phosphorus and Sulphur (Basal Application):**
If you prefer to use **SSP** for Phosphorus and Sulphur, it can replace **DAP** and **Elemental Sulphur** in the basal application:

*   **SSP**: 350-375 kg per acre
    *   *(This provides approximately 56-60 kg P2O5 and 38-41 kg S)*
*   **Muriate of Potash** (Potash): 60-70 kg per acre
*   **Urea**: 50-60 kg per acre
    *   *(Since SSP provides no Nitrogen, a higher dose of Urea is needed at basal.)*
*   *(Follow with **Urea** top-dressings as mentioned above.)*

**Nano-Fertilizers (Foliar Application):**

*   **Nano-Urea**: 500 ml per acre
    *   *(Mix 500 ml of **Nano-Urea** in 200-250 litres of water. Apply 2-3 sprays during the crop cycle, especially after cuts, starting 15-20 days after the first cut.)*
*   **Nano-DAP**: 500 ml per acre
    *   *(Mix 500 ml of **Nano-DAP** in 200-250 litres of water. Apply 1-2 sprays during early vegetative growth, e.g., 20-30 days after sowing/planting.)*

**NPK Fertilizers:**
Compound **NPK** fertilizers (e.g., 12:32:16, 19:19:19) can be used, but their specific ratio will dictate the amount needed and subsequent supplementation. For fodder crops, using straight fertilizers like **Urea**, **DAP**, **Muriate of Potash**, and **SSP** often allows for more flexible and precise nutrient management based on crop stage and soil requirements.

*   If using **NPK (12:32:16)**: 180-200 kg per acre as basal, along with 20-25 kg **Elemental Sulphur**. Then follow with **Urea** top-dressings as recommended above.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Soil Testing:** Always prioritize soil testing for the most accurate recommendations.
*   **Application Method:** Ensure uniform application of granular fertilizers. Foliar sprays should be done during cooler parts of the day.
*   **Watering:** Adequate moisture is crucial for nutrient uptake. Irrigate after applying granular fertilizers.
