Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I am pleased to provide scientifically verified advice for improving Guinea Grass cultivation in Haryana.

It is important to clarify that Guinea Grass (*Panicum maximum*) is primarily a **forage crop**, grown for its abundant vegetative biomass (leaves and stems) to feed livestock. It is not cultivated for "fruit" production.

Let's address your points:

1.  **Fruit Quality:**
    Guinea Grass does not produce "fruit" in the horticultural sense. It produces seeds, which are primarily used for propagation. Therefore, the concept of "fruit quality" does not apply to Guinea Grass. If you are referring to *seed quality* for propagation, factors like proper harvesting, drying, and storage conditions are crucial to maintain seed viability and germination rates.

2.  **Storage Life:**
    For forage crops like Guinea Grass, "storage life" refers to the preservation of the harvested biomass for later feeding, typically through **hay making** or **silage making**. This is a processing method, not an inherent quality of the fresh plant.
    *   **Hay Making:** Involves drying the cut grass to a moisture content of 15-20% to inhibit microbial activity. Proper drying (avoiding rain, turning frequently) and storage in a dry, well-ventilated area are crucial to prevent spoilage and retain nutritional value.
    *   **Silage Making:** Involves fermenting the chopped green grass (at 60-70% moisture) in an anaerobic environment (e.g., a silo or pit). This preserves the forage and maintains its palatability and nutritional quality. Proper compaction and sealing are critical for successful silage.

3.  **Improving Yield (Biomass Production):**
    Improving the yield of Guinea Grass focuses on maximizing its vegetative growth. Here are key practices:

    *   **1. Variety Selection:**
        Choose high-yielding, locally adapted varieties recommended for Haryana. Popular varieties include Hamil, Makueni, PGG-19, PGG-101, PGG-505, and PGG-9.

    *   **2. Soil Management:**
        *   **Soil Type:** Guinea Grass thrives in a wide range of soils but prefers well-drained loamy soils.
        *   **pH:** Optimal pH range is 5.5 to 7.0. If soil pH is acidic, apply **Agricultural Lime** as per soil test recommendations.
        *   **Organic Matter:** Incorporate farmyard manure (FYM) or compost at 10-15 tonnes/acre during land preparation to improve soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability.

    *   **3. Nutrient Management (Fertilization):**
        Based on soil test results, apply fertilizers judiciously. General recommendations for good growth are:
        *   **Nitrogen (N):** Crucial for vegetative growth.
            *   Basal application: 25-30 kg N/acre at sowing/planting.
            *   Top dressing: 25-30 kg N/acre after each cut (except the last cut before winter dormancy).
            *   Source: **Urea** (46% N).
        *   **Phosphorus (P):** Essential for root development and overall plant vigor.
            *   Basal application: 20-25 kg P2O5/acre.
            *   Source: **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5) or **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5).
        *   **Potassium (K):** Improves drought tolerance, disease resistance, and stem strength.
            *   Basal application: 15-20 kg K2O/acre.
            *   Source: **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** or **Potassium Chloride** (60% K2O).
        *   **Micronutrients:** If soil tests indicate deficiencies, apply specific micronutrients (e.g., Zinc, Iron, Manganese, Boron) as per recommendations. A foliar spray of a general micronutrient mixture (e.g., 0.5-1.0 kg/acre dissolved in 200 L water) can be beneficial if deficiencies are suspected.

    *   **4. Water Management (Irrigation):**
        Guinea Grass is relatively drought-tolerant once established but responds well to irrigation, especially during dry periods, for higher yields.
        *   Provide irrigation immediately after sowing/planting.
        *   Subsequent irrigations should be given at intervals of 10-15 days during summer and 20-25 days during winter, depending on soil type and rainfall.
        *   Ensure proper drainage to prevent waterlogging.

    *   **5. Weed Management:**
        Weeds compete with Guinea Grass for nutrients, water, and sunlight, reducing yield.
        *   **Cultural Methods:** Thorough land preparation, timely sowing, and inter-row cultivation can help control weeds.
        *   **Chemical Control:** For broadleaf weeds, post-emergence application of **2,4-D Sodium Salt** at 0.5-1.0 kg active ingredient per acre (dissolved in 200-300 L water) can be used, ensuring the grass is well-established and not under stress. Always follow label instructions carefully.

    *   **6. Harvesting Management:**
        *   **First Cut:** Take the first cut 60-75 days after sowing/planting.
        *   **Subsequent Cuts:** Subsequent cuts can be taken at intervals of 30-40 days during the active growing season (monsoon and post-monsoon).
        *   **Cutting Height:** Maintain a cutting height of 10-15 cm from the ground level to ensure rapid regrowth and sustained yield. Frequent cutting at the correct height promotes tillering and higher biomass production.

    *   **7. Pest and Disease Management:**
        Guinea Grass is generally robust and less prone to severe pest and disease outbreaks in Haryana.
        *   **Pests:** Occasionally, armyworms or grasshoppers might appear. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) practices, including cultural control and biological control, are preferred. Chemical control is rarely needed for Guinea Grass.
        *   **Diseases:** Fungal diseases like rust or leaf spot might occur under specific environmental conditions. Maintaining good field hygiene, proper spacing, and balanced nutrition usually keeps these in check.

By implementing these scientifically sound practices, you can significantly improve the biomass yield of Guinea Grass, providing high-quality forage for your livestock.
