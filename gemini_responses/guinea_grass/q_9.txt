Mites, including Red Spider Mite (Tetranychus urticae) and Rust Mites (various species of Eriophyidae), can significantly impact the yield and quality of Guinea Grass (Panicum maximum) by sucking sap and causing damage to leaves, leading to reduced photosynthetic efficiency. As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend an integrated approach for effective and sustainable control, keeping in mind that Guinea Grass is a fodder crop.

### Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Mites in Guinea Grass

1.  **Monitoring:**
    *   Regularly inspect your Guinea Grass fields, especially the undersides of leaves, for the presence of mites, webbing (for red spider mites), or bronzing/rusting symptoms (for rust mites). Early detection is key.
    *   Use a hand lens to confirm mite presence and species if possible.

2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Water Management:** Ensure adequate irrigation. Water-stressed plants are more susceptible to mite infestations. Overhead irrigation can sometimes help dislodge mites.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Maintain balanced fertilization. Excessive nitrogen can sometimes promote mite outbreaks.
    *   **Weed Control:** Remove weeds from and around the Guinea Grass field, as many weeds can serve as alternate hosts for mites.
    *   **Crop Rotation/Field Sanitation:** If possible, rotate fields or ensure proper sanitation after harvesting to reduce carry-over populations.

3.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Conserve natural enemies such as predatory mites (e.g., Amblyseius spp.), ladybird beetles, lacewings, and minute pirate bugs. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.
    *   Provide a diverse habitat to encourage these predators.

### Chemical Control (Acaricides)

Chemical control should be considered when mite populations reach damaging levels and cultural/biological methods are insufficient. **Given that Guinea Grass is a fodder crop, extreme caution must be exercised regarding chemical residues. Always check the label for specific approval on fodder crops and strictly adhere to the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) before feeding to livestock.**

Here are CIBRC-approved technical chemicals effective against mites, with specific considerations for fodder:

1.  **Sulphur (Wettable Powder):**
    *   **Recommendation:** This is generally the safest option for fodder crops due to its low toxicity and short/negligible PHI for grazing. It is effective against both red spider mites and rust mites.
    *   **Dosage:** Apply **Sulphur 80% WP** at 2.0-3.0 kg per acre, mixed in 400-500 litres of water for thorough coverage.
    *   **Application:** Ensure good coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves. Repeat application after 10-15 days if necessary.

2.  **Propargite:**
    *   **Recommendation:** Effective against red spider mites.
    *   **Dosage:** Apply **Propargite 57% EC** at 1.0-1.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Caution:** **Strictly observe the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) as specified on the product label before feeding treated fodder to livestock.** This may make it impractical for continuous harvesting.

3.  **Fenpyroximate:**
    *   **Recommendation:** Effective against red spider mites.
    *   **Dosage:** Apply **Fenpyroximate 5% SC** at 0.5-1.0 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Caution:** **Strictly observe the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) as specified on the product label before feeding treated fodder to livestock.**

4.  **Abamectin:**
    *   **Recommendation:** Effective against both red spider mites and rust mites.
    *   **Dosage:** Apply **Abamectin 1.9% EC** at 0.3-0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Caution:** **Strictly observe the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) as specified on the product label before feeding treated fodder to livestock.**

**General Application Guidelines for Chemical Control:**

*   **Read the Label:** Always read and follow the instructions, precautions, and PHI mentioned on the product label.
*   **Thorough Coverage:** Mites are often found on the undersides of leaves, so ensure thorough spray coverage.
*   **Rotation of Acaricides:** To prevent the development of resistance, rotate acaricides with different modes of action if multiple applications are needed.
*   **Safety:** Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying.
