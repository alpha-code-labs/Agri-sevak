As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following seed and soil treatment processes for Guinea Grass (Panicum maximum) to ensure optimal establishment, vigor, and protection against common issues in Haryana.

### Recommended Seed Treatment Process for Guinea Grass

Seed treatment is crucial for protecting seeds from soil-borne pathogens, improving germination, and providing early seedling protection.

*   **Fungicide Treatment:** To protect against soil-borne diseases like damping-off and seedling blight.
    *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: 1-2 g per kg of seed.
    *   OR **Thiram** 75% WS: 2-3 g per kg of seed.
*   **Bio-fertilizer Treatment:** To enhance nutrient availability (nitrogen fixation, phosphorus solubilization) and promote early vigor.
    *   **Azotobacter** (liquid/powder formulation): 250 ml or 250 g per 10-15 kg of seed.
    *   **PSB (Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria)** (liquid/powder formulation): 250 ml or 250 g per 10-15 kg of seed.
    *   **Trichoderma viride** (bio-fungicide, also aids in disease suppression): 4-5 g per kg of seed or 250 g per 10-15 kg of seed.
*   **Insecticide Treatment (Optional):** If early season sucking pests or shoot fly are anticipated based on local history or risk assessment.
    *   **Imidacloprid** 48% FS: 2-5 ml per kg of seed.

**Application Process for Seed Treatment:**
1.  **Chemical Treatment First:** In a clean container, first treat the seeds with the chosen fungicide (e.g., **Carbendazim** or **Thiram**). If using an insecticide (e.g., **Imidacloprid**), apply it next. Mix thoroughly to ensure uniform coating on all seeds.
2.  **Drying:** Allow the chemically treated seeds to air dry in the shade for 30-60 minutes to prevent clumping and ensure proper adhesion.
3.  **Bio-fertilizer Application:** Once the chemical treatments are dry, apply the bio-fertilizers (**Azotobacter**, **PSB**, **Trichoderma**). Mix gently to coat the seeds uniformly.
4.  **Sowing:** Sow the treated seeds as soon as possible, preferably within 24 hours, to maximize the efficacy of the treatments.

### Recommended Soil Treatment Process for Guinea Grass

Soil treatment focuses on improving soil health, managing soil-borne pests and diseases, and enhancing nutrient availability for robust plant growth.

*   **Organic Amendments:**
    *   **Well-decomposed Farmyard Manure (FYM) or Compost:** 10-15 tonnes per acre. Incorporate thoroughly into the soil during land preparation (e.g., before the last ploughing). This is fundamental for improving soil structure, water retention, microbial activity, and overall soil fertility.
*   **Bio-fertilizers / Bio-control Agents (Soil Application):**
    *   **Azotobacter** (liquid/powder formulation): 2-4 kg per acre.
    *   **PSB (Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria)** (liquid/powder formulation): 2-4 kg per acre.
    *   **Trichoderma viride** (bio-fungicide): 2-4 kg per acre.
    *   **Application:** Mix these bio-agents with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed FYM or compost. Broadcast this mixture evenly over the field before the last ploughing or at the time of sowing/planting. This ensures uniform distribution and provides a suitable carrier for the microbes.
*   **Chemical Soil Treatment (Only if specific pest problems are identified and confirmed):**
    *   **For Termites/White Grubs:** If these pests are a known problem in your field.
        *   **Fipronil** 0.3% GR: 6-8 kg per acre. Apply uniformly in the soil at the time of sowing/planting or before.
    *   **For Nematodes (if confirmed by soil testing and severe infestation):**
        *   **Carbosulfan** 25% EC: 1.6-2.4 L per acre, applied as a drench around the root zone or incorporated into the soil. *Use this option with caution and only when nematode infestation is severe, as it is a chemical nematicide.*
*   **Pre-emergence Herbicide (for early weed management):**
    *   **Pendimethalin** 30% EC: 1.0-1.3 L per acre. Apply as a uniform spray within 3 days of sowing/planting, ensuring adequate soil moisture. This helps control a wide range of annual grasses and broadleaf weeds, reducing early competition for the Guinea Grass seedlings.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions when handling any chemical.
*   Ensure proper soil moisture for optimal efficacy of both bio-agents and chemical treatments.
*   Regular soil testing is recommended to understand nutrient status and pH, guiding further amendments.
