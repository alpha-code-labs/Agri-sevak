As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm the following regarding the diseases mentioned for Guinea Grass (*Panicum maximum*):

*   **Dieback:** This is not known to affect Guinea Grass as a specific disease. Symptoms resembling dieback (e.g., drying of plant parts) can occur due to various stresses (nutrient deficiency, water stress, insect damage, or other fungal/bacterial leaf/stem blights), but "Dieback" itself is not a recognized primary disease of Guinea Grass.
*   **Twig Blight:** This is not known to affect Guinea Grass. Guinea Grass is a herbaceous plant and does not have "twigs" in the botanical sense that would be affected by twig blight diseases, which are typically associated with woody plants.
*   **Tikka Disease:** This is not known to affect Guinea Grass. Tikka disease is a specific leaf spot disease primarily associated with groundnut (*Arachis hypogaea*). While Guinea Grass can suffer from various leaf spot diseases, the condition known as "Tikka disease" does not affect it.
