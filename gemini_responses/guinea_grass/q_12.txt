Scale insects and mealybugs are common sap-sucking pests that can affect a wide range of plants, including Guinea Grass (Panicum maximum). These pests feed on plant sap, leading to stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, and in severe infestations, can significantly reduce fodder yield and quality. Effective control requires an integrated approach.

Here's how to control Scale insects and Mealybugs in Guinea Grass:

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Approach:**

1.  **Cultural Control:**
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy infested plant debris and weeds, which can harbor pests.
    *   **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to improve air circulation, which can reduce humidity and make the environment less favorable for these pests.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, as it can lead to lush, soft growth that is more attractive to sap-sucking pests. Maintain balanced nutrition.
    *   **Water Management:** Ensure proper irrigation to avoid water stress, which can make plants more susceptible.
    *   **Pruning:** For localized infestations, prune and destroy heavily infested plant parts.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Encourage beneficial insects like ladybird beetles (coccinellids), lacewings, and parasitic wasps (e.g., *Anagyrus lopezi* for mealybugs) that prey on or parasitize scale insects and mealybugs. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficials.
    *   **Biopesticides:** Consider using entomopathogenic fungi like *Beauveria bassiana* or *Metarhizium anisopliae*, which can infect and kill these pests, especially under humid conditions.

3.  **Chemical Control (As a Last Resort):**
    If cultural and biological methods are insufficient and the infestation is severe, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always follow label instructions, wear appropriate personal protective equipment, and adhere to the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) before feeding the grass to livestock.

    **Recommended CIBRC-approved Insecticides:**

    *   **For early stages and moderate infestations (IPM compatible):**
        *   **Azadirachtin 1500 ppm:** Apply 5 ml per litre of water. This is a neem-based botanical insecticide that acts as an antifeedant and insect growth regulator. It is safer for beneficial insects.

    *   **For moderate to severe infestations:**
        *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply 1.25 litres per acre (mixed in 500-600 litres of water). This is an insect growth regulator that primarily affects the nymphal stages by inhibiting chitin synthesis, preventing molting.
        *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply 125-150 ml per acre (mixed in 500-600 litres of water). This is a systemic insecticide that provides good control against sap-sucking pests. Ensure to check the specific Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) for fodder crops before application.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Spot Treatment:** For localized infestations, consider spot treatment rather than broadcast spraying to minimize chemical use and protect beneficial insects.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and stems where these pests often hide.
*   **Rotation of Chemicals:** To prevent the development of resistance, rotate insecticides with different modes of action.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Strictly observe the PHI mentioned on the insecticide label. This is crucial for fodder crops to ensure the safety of livestock consuming the grass.

By adopting these scientifically verified practices, you can effectively manage scale insects and mealybugs in your Guinea Grass fields and ensure healthy fodder production. For any specific concerns or severe outbreaks, please consult with the entomology experts at HAU, Hisar.
