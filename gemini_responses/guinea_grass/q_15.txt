Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I will provide scientifically verified advice for managing the mentioned conditions in Guinea Grass.

Here's how to address the pests you've inquired about:

### 1. Grasshopper

Grasshoppers are common polyphagous pests that can cause significant defoliation in fodder crops like Guinea Grass by feeding on the leaves and stems.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Maintain field sanitation by removing weeds, which can serve as alternate hosts and breeding grounds for grasshoppers.
    *   Deep ploughing after harvest can expose grasshopper eggs to predators and adverse weather conditions, reducing the next generation's population.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   For severe infestations, consider spraying with CIBRC approved insecticides. Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.
        *   **Malathion 50% EC** at 1.0 - 1.5 Litres per acre, mixed in 200-300 Litres of water.
        *   **Quinalphos 25% EC** at 1.0 - 1.5 Litres per acre, mixed in 200-300 Litres of water.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC** at 200-250 ml per acre, mixed in 200-300 Litres of water.

### 2. Painted Bug (Bagrada hilaris)

This is not known to affect Guinea Grass. Painted bugs primarily infest cruciferous crops (e.g., mustard, cabbage, radish) and are not typically a pest of grasses.

### 3. Red Cotton Bug (Dysdercus cingulatus)

This is not known to affect Guinea Grass. Red cotton bugs are primarily pests of cotton and other malvaceous plants, feeding on developing seeds. They do not infest grasses.

### 4. Black Ants

Black ants are generally not direct pests that feed on Guinea Grass. Their presence in the field might be due to nesting, or they might be tending to other sap-sucking insects (like aphids or mealybugs) for their honeydew secretions. If ants are causing a nuisance by creating mounds, disturbing roots, or protecting other pests, control measures can be considered.

**Control Measures (if deemed necessary):**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Maintain good field sanitation to reduce nesting sites and remove debris that ants might use for shelter.
    *   If ants are tending other pests, focus on controlling the primary sap-sucking pest, which will naturally reduce ant activity.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   For localized ant nests causing disturbance, drenching the nests can be effective.
        *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** at 2.0 - 2.5 Litres per acre, mixed in sufficient water (e.g., 400-500 Litres) and applied as a drench to ant mounds/nests.
    *   For widespread ant issues, especially if they are disturbing roots or protecting other pests:
        *   **Fipronil 0.3% GR** at 10-15 kg per acre, applied uniformly to the soil surface and lightly incorporated, or applied near ant activity areas.

### General Recommendations:

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully, including dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during pesticide application.
*   Observe the recommended pre-harvest interval (PHI) for any applied chemicals, especially since Guinea Grass is a fodder crop for livestock.
*   For any specific concerns or severe infestations, it is always advisable to consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for tailored advice.
