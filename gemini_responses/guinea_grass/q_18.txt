As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the use of Growth Regulators/Hormones and Boron in Guinea Grass for Haryana conditions:

It is important to clarify the primary roles of the substances mentioned, as some are not typically used as growth regulators/hormones for Guinea Grass in standard agricultural practices.

### **1. Ethephon**

*   **Technical Chemical Name:** **Ethephon**
*   **Role:** **Ethephon** is an ethylene-releasing compound primarily used for ripening fruits, promoting flowering, or preventing lodging in certain cereal crops.
*   **Recommendation for Guinea Grass:** The use of **Ethephon** as a growth regulator for enhancing yield or quality in Guinea Grass is not a standard, widely recommended practice in Haryana. Its primary applications are in other crops for specific purposes such as fruit ripening or lodging prevention.

### **2. 2,4-D**

*   **Technical Chemical Name:** **2,4-D**
*   **Role:** **2,4-D** is a synthetic auxin, but it is primarily known and recommended as a selective herbicide for controlling broadleaf weeds in grass crops. While auxins are plant hormones, applying **2,4-D** specifically as a growth regulator (hormone) for Guinea Grass to promote specific growth phases or enhance yield is not a standard, scientifically verified recommendation.
*   **Recommendation for Guinea Grass:** Its application in Guinea Grass fields would typically be for weed control, not as a growth regulator.

### **3. Boron**

*   **Technical Chemical Name:** **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate) or **Boric acid**
*   **Role:** Boron is an essential micronutrient for plant growth, crucial for cell wall formation, sugar transport, and reproductive development. It is not classified as a growth regulator or hormone in the same way as **Ethephon** or **2,4-D**. However, Boron deficiency can significantly impact Guinea Grass growth and yield. Recommendations for Boron application are typically based on soil test results, as deficiencies are known to occur in some Haryana soils.

*   **Recommended Dose (if deficiency is diagnosed or suspected):**

    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   Apply 1.0 - 2.0 kg of actual Boron per acre. This can be achieved by applying 10-20 kg of **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate) per acre, or 6-12 kg of **Boric acid** per acre, mixed with other fertilizers or sand, before sowing or as a top dressing.

    *   **Foliar Spray:**
        *   Prepare a 0.1% - 0.2% solution of **Borax** or **Boric acid** (i.e., 1-2 g of **Borax** or **Boric acid** per litre of water).
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at critical growth stages such as tillering and pre-flowering, ensuring thorough coverage of the foliage.

**Important Note:** Always conduct a soil test to determine the actual nutrient status of your field before applying any micronutrients like Boron. Over-application of Boron can be toxic to plants.
