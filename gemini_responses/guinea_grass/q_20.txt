Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice on addressing micronutrient deficiencies in Guinea Grass (Panicum maximum) in Haryana.

Guinea Grass is a robust fodder crop, but like any plant, it can suffer from micronutrient deficiencies, especially in soils with specific characteristics (e.g., alkaline pH, low organic matter, sandy texture) or under intensive cultivation.

**Crucial First Step: Soil Testing**
Before applying any micronutrients, it is **imperative** to conduct a comprehensive soil test. Visual symptoms can be misleading, and applying unnecessary nutrients can be wasteful or even harmful. HAU's soil testing labs can provide precise recommendations based on your specific field conditions.

Once a deficiency is confirmed, here's how to address each micronutrient:

### Addressing Specific Micronutrient Deficiencies in Guinea Grass

**1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency**
*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, reduced leaf size, interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, often with a reddish-brown tinge.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.5% solution of **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** (ZnSO4.7H2O).
        *   **Rate:** 5 grams per litre of water. Add a suitable wetting agent/sticker.
        *   **Timing:** Apply at tillering stage and repeat if symptoms persist after 15-20 days.
    *   **Soil Application:** Broadcast **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** (ZnSO4.7H2O) or **Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate** (ZnSO4.H2O).
        *   **Rate:** 10-25 kg per acre for **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** or 7-15 kg per acre for **Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate**, incorporated into the soil before sowing or as a top dressing.

**2. Iron (Fe) Deficiency (Ferrous Deficiency)**
*   **Symptoms:** Pronounced interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on young leaves, with veins remaining green. In severe cases, entire leaves turn yellow or white.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.5-1% solution of **Ferrous Sulphate Heptahydrate** (FeSO4.7H2O).
        *   **Rate:** 5-10 grams per litre of water. Add a suitable wetting agent/sticker.
        *   **Timing:** Apply when symptoms appear, repeat every 7-10 days until recovery. Soil application of iron is generally less effective in alkaline soils due to rapid oxidation.

**3. Boron (B) Deficiency**
*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, thickening and brittleness of younger leaves, malformation of growing points, poor root development.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.1-0.2% solution of **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** or **Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate** (Borax).
        *   **Rate:** 1-2 grams per litre of water. Add a suitable wetting agent/sticker.
        *   **Timing:** Apply at early vegetative growth stage.
    *   **Soil Application:** Broadcast **Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate** (Borax).
        *   **Rate:** 2-4 kg per acre, incorporated into the soil before sowing. *Caution: Boron can be toxic if over-applied, so precise application based on soil test is critical.*

**4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency**
*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, distorted or curled new leaves, tip burn of young leaves, poor root development. Symptoms are rare in Haryana soils unless highly acidic or very sandy.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.5-1% solution of **Calcium Nitrate** (Ca(NO3)2) or **Calcium Chloride** (CaCl2).
        *   **Rate:** 5-10 grams per litre of water. Add a suitable wetting agent/sticker.
        *   **Timing:** Apply when symptoms appear, focusing on young foliage.
    *   **Soil Application:** If soil pH is low, liming with **Calcium Carbonate** (CaCO3) can correct both pH and calcium deficiency. For direct Ca supply, **Gypsum** (Calcium Sulphate Dihydrate, CaSO4.2H2O) can be used.
        *   **Rate:** As per soil test recommendations, typically 200-500 kg per acre for gypsum, incorporated into the soil.

**5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency**
*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, starting from the leaf margins and progressing inwards, often with a reddish or purplish tinge.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.5-1% solution of **Magnesium Sulphate Heptahydrate** (MgSO4.7H2O, Epsom salt).
        *   **Rate:** 5-10 grams per litre of water. Add a suitable wetting agent/sticker.
        *   **Timing:** Apply when symptoms appear, repeat if necessary.
    *   **Soil Application:** Broadcast **Magnesium Sulphate Heptahydrate** (MgSO4.7H2O).
        *   **Rate:** 10-20 kg per acre, incorporated into the soil before sowing or as a top dressing.

**6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency**
*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, similar to iron deficiency but often with small necrotic (dead) spots or streaks. Growth may be stunted.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.2-0.5% solution of **Manganese Sulphate Monohydrate** (MnSO4.H2O).
        *   **Rate:** 2-5 grams per litre of water. Add a suitable wetting agent/sticker.
        *   **Timing:** Apply at early vegetative growth stage or when symptoms appear.
    *   **Soil Application:** Broadcast **Manganese Sulphate Monohydrate** (MnSO4.H2O).
        *   **Rate:** 5-10 kg per acre, incorporated into the soil before sowing.

### General Recommendations for Micronutrient Application:

*   **Timing of Foliar Sprays:** Apply foliar sprays during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late afternoon) to maximize absorption and minimize leaf scorch.
*   **Water Quality:** Use clean water for spraying. Hard water can reduce the effectiveness of some chemicals.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management:** Micronutrient application should be part of a holistic nutrient management plan that includes adequate macronutrient (N, P, K) fertilization and organic matter addition.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (gloves, mask, eye protection) when handling chemicals. Follow label instructions carefully.
*   **Consultation:** For specific field conditions and tailored advice, always consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts.

By following these guidelines and prioritizing soil testing, you can effectively manage micronutrient deficiencies and ensure healthy, productive Guinea Grass for your livestock.
