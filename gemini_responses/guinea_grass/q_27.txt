As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the suitable climate, soil type, and drainage requirements for Guinea Grass (Panicum maximum) in regions like Haryana:

### Suitable Climate for Guinea Grass:

*   **Temperature:** Guinea Grass is a warm-season perennial grass that thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Optimal growth occurs at temperatures between 25°C and 35°C. It is highly sensitive to frost and will cease growth or die back with prolonged exposure to temperatures below 10°C.
*   **Rainfall:** It requires moderate to high rainfall, ideally in the range of 900 mm to 1700 mm annually, well-distributed throughout the growing season. While it can tolerate short dry spells once established, prolonged drought will significantly reduce yield. In areas with lower rainfall, supplementary irrigation is crucial for optimal production.
*   **Sunlight:** Guinea Grass requires full sun exposure for vigorous growth. Shaded conditions will lead to reduced tillering and overall biomass production.

### Suitable Soil Type for Guinea Grass:

*   **Texture:** Guinea Grass is adaptable to a wide range of soil types, from sandy loams to clay loams. However, it performs best on fertile, well-drained loamy soils.
*   **pH:** It tolerates a broad pH range, typically from 5.0 to 7.5. Optimal growth is observed in slightly acidic to neutral soils (pH 6.0-7.0). It can tolerate moderately acidic and slightly alkaline conditions, which are common in parts of Haryana.
*   **Fertility:** It is a high-yielding grass and responds very well to good soil fertility, particularly nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Regular soil testing is recommended to determine specific nutrient requirements.

### Drainage Requirement for Guinea Grass:

*   **Drainage:** Excellent drainage is critical for Guinea Grass. It is highly intolerant to waterlogging and poorly drained soils. Standing water or saturated soil conditions for extended periods will lead to root rot, stunted growth, and eventually plant death.
*   **Aeration:** Well-aerated soils are essential for healthy root development and nutrient uptake. Therefore, sites prone to water accumulation should be avoided or improved with proper drainage systems before planting.
