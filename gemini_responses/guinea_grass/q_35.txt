As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the maturity signs, harvesting time, and cutting process for Guinea Grass (Panicum maximum) in Haryana:

### Maturity Signs for Harvesting Guinea Grass

For optimal fodder quality (high protein and digestibility) and good regrowth, Guinea Grass should be harvested at the vegetative stage, before it starts flowering extensively. Key maturity signs include:

*   **Height:** The plants typically reach a height of 100-150 cm.
*   **Leafiness:** The crop should be lush green with a high proportion of leaves to stems. As the plant matures and flowers, the stem becomes lignified (woody), reducing digestibility.
*   **Pre-flowering Stage:** The ideal stage is just before the emergence of flower heads (panicles) or at the very early boot stage (when the flower head is still enclosed within the leaf sheath). Harvesting at this stage ensures maximum nutrient content.

### Harvesting Time

The timing of harvesting is crucial for maximizing both yield and fodder quality.

*   **First Cut:** The first cut is generally taken 60-75 days after sowing or planting. This allows the root system to establish well and ensures vigorous regrowth.
*   **Subsequent Cuts:** Subsequent cuts can be taken at intervals of 30-45 days, depending on the season, growth rate, and availability of irrigation. During warmer months with good moisture, growth is faster, allowing for shorter intervals.
*   **Number of Cuts:** In Haryana's climate, with proper management and irrigation, Guinea Grass can provide 4-6 cuts per year.
*   **Optimal Stage:** Always aim to harvest when the crop is at the pre-flowering stage or when it reaches the recommended height (100-150 cm) to ensure high nutritive value. Delaying harvest beyond this stage significantly reduces protein content and digestibility.

### Cutting Process

The correct cutting process is vital for promoting rapid and healthy regrowth, ensuring sustained fodder production.

*   **Stubble Height:** Cut the grass at a height of 10-15 cm from the ground. Cutting too low can damage the crown of the plant, hindering regrowth, while cutting too high leaves too much stem, reducing the quality of the subsequent cut.
*   **Tools:** Harvesting can be done manually using sickles or mechanically using fodder harvesters/mowers, especially for larger areas.
*   **Clean Cut:** Ensure a clean cut to minimize damage to the plant and promote faster healing and regrowth.
*   **Post-Harvest Management:** After each cut, it is beneficial to apply a top-dressing of nitrogen fertilizer and irrigate, especially during dry periods, to encourage vigorous regrowth.

By following these guidelines, farmers in Haryana can ensure a continuous supply of high-quality green fodder from Guinea Grass.
