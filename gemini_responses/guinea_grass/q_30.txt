As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I advise that managing growth issues in Guinea Grass (Panicum maximum) is crucial for maintaining high-quality fodder yield. These issues often stem from nutrient imbalances, environmental stress, or improper management. A fundamental first step for addressing any growth issue is a comprehensive **soil test** to determine nutrient status and soil pH.

Here's how to manage common growth issues in Guinea Grass:

### 1. Slow Growth

Slow growth in Guinea Grass often indicates nutrient deficiencies or environmental stress.

*   **Soil Testing:** Conduct a thorough soil test to identify specific nutrient deficiencies (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, or micronutrients) and soil pH issues.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Based on soil test results:
    *   **Nitrogen (N):** Apply **Urea** at 50-100 kg/acre per cut, preferably in split doses. For establishment, **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)** can provide initial N and P.
    *   **Phosphorus (P):** Apply **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)** at 25-50 kg/acre at sowing or establishment. Alternatively, **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** can be used.
    *   **Potassium (K):** Apply **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** at 20-40 kg/acre per cut.
    *   **Micronutrients:** If deficiencies are identified (e.g., Zinc, Iron), apply specific micronutrient fertilizers. For Zinc deficiency, apply **Zinc sulfate heptahydrate** at 10-25 kg/acre to the soil or as a foliar spray of 0.5% solution (5 g/L).
*   **Water Management:** Ensure adequate and timely irrigation, especially during dry periods, to prevent moisture stress.
*   **Soil Health:** Improve soil structure and aeration by incorporating organic matter (farmyard manure or compost) to enhance root development and nutrient uptake.
*   **Weed Control:** Manage weeds effectively to reduce competition for nutrients, water, and light.

### 2. Yellow Growth (Chlorosis)

Yellowing of Guinea Grass leaves (chlorosis) is typically a symptom of nutrient deficiency or waterlogging.

*   **Soil Testing:** Essential to pinpoint the exact cause, whether it's a macronutrient (like Nitrogen) or a micronutrient (like Iron or Zinc) deficiency, or an unfavorable soil pH.
*   **Nitrogen Deficiency:** If older leaves show general yellowing, apply **Urea** as a top dressing at 50-75 kg/acre or a foliar spray of 1-2% solution (10-20 g/L).
*   **Iron Deficiency:** If younger leaves show interveinal yellowing (veins remain green), apply **Ferrous sulfate heptahydrate** at 0.5-1% solution (5-10 g/L) as a foliar spray. In severe cases, soil application of 10-20 kg/acre may be considered.
*   **Zinc Deficiency:** If yellowing is accompanied by stunted growth, apply **Zinc sulfate heptahydrate** at 0.5% solution (5 g/L) as a foliar spray.
*   **Waterlogging:** Ensure proper drainage in the field. Guinea Grass does not tolerate prolonged waterlogging, which can lead to root damage and nutrient unavailability, causing yellowing.
*   **Soil pH Adjustment:** If high soil pH is causing micronutrient unavailability, consider long-term soil amendments like **Gypsum** for sodic soils, as advised by soil test reports.

### 3. Excessive Height

Excessive height can lead to lodging, making harvesting difficult and reducing forage quality.

*   **Nitrogen Management:** Optimize Nitrogen application. Avoid excessive use of Nitrogen, especially in later growth stages, as it promotes lush vegetative growth and height. Follow soil test recommendations.
*   **Harvesting Frequency:** Implement timely and frequent harvesting. Cutting the grass at the recommended height (typically 15-20 cm above ground) and at appropriate intervals (usually every 30-45 days depending on growth) prevents it from becoming too tall and promotes tillering.
*   **Planting Density:** Maintain optimal plant spacing to ensure adequate light penetration and air circulation, which can help prevent etiolation (stretching due to low light).
*   **Variety Selection:** If lodging is a persistent issue, consider selecting Guinea Grass varieties known for their moderate height and good standability.
*   **Plant Growth Regulators:** The use of plant growth regulators is generally not recommended for fodder crops due to potential residue concerns in animal feed. Focus on cultural practices.

### 4. Excessive Flowering

Excessive flowering indicates the plant is shifting from vegetative growth to reproductive growth, which can reduce the nutritional quality and palatability of the fodder.

*   **Harvesting Management:** This is the most effective strategy. Harvest the Guinea Grass before or at the very early stages of flowering. Frequent cutting promotes vegetative regrowth and delays flowering.
*   **Nutrient and Water Management:** Ensure the crop receives adequate Nitrogen and water. Stress conditions (drought, nutrient deficiency) can sometimes trigger premature flowering. Maintain optimal soil moisture and nutrient levels to encourage vegetative growth.
*   **Variety Selection:** Some Guinea Grass varieties are naturally earlier flowering than others. If excessive flowering is a consistent problem, consider varieties known for delayed flowering or prolonged vegetative phase.

Always consult with HAU experts or your local Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and soil test results.
