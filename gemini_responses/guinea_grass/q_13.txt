This is not known to affect Guinea Grass.

Fruit flies (Tephritidae) and Ber flies (*Carpomyia vesuviana*) are pests primarily of fruit-bearing horticultural crops, where they infest the developing fruits. Guinea Grass (*Panicum maximum*) is a fodder crop grown for its vegetative parts (leaves and stems) and does not produce fruits that would be susceptible to these pests.
