As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified strategies for controlling sucking pests in Guinea Grass (Panicum maximum) in Haryana:

**1. Pests Addressed:** Aphids, Leafhopper, Whitefly, Thrips.

**2. Regarding Psylla:** This is not known to affect Guinea Grass as a significant pest.

**3. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Approach:**
For fodder crops like Guinea Grass, an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is crucial to minimize chemical residues and ensure the safety of livestock. Chemical control should always be a last resort, implemented only when pest populations reach economic threshold levels and other methods are insufficient.

**A. Cultural Control Measures:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Regularly remove weeds and crop residues from and around the field, as these can harbor sucking pests and provide alternative hosts.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush, succulent growth that is particularly attractive to sucking pests. Maintain a balanced nutrient supply.
*   **Water Management:** Ensure proper and timely irrigation to maintain plant vigor. Stressed plants are often more susceptible to pest infestations.
*   **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect Guinea Grass plants, especially the undersides of leaves and tender shoots, for early signs of pest infestation. Early detection allows for timely and effective intervention.

**B. Biological Control Measures:**
*   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Protect and encourage beneficial insects such as ladybird beetles, lacewings, hoverflies, and parasitic wasps. These natural enemies are highly effective in preying on or parasitizing aphids, whiteflies, and leafhoppers. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that can harm these beneficial populations.
*   **Habitat Management:** Provide diverse habitats (e.g., flowering plants) around the field to support and enhance populations of natural enemies.

**C. Chemical Control Measures (As a Last Resort):**
If pest populations reach economic threshold levels and cultural/biological methods are insufficient, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always adhere strictly to the recommended dosage and Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) to ensure fodder safety for livestock.

*   **For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips:**
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply at a rate of 100-200 g per acre, mixed in 200-400 litres of water for thorough coverage.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at a rate of 100 g per acre, mixed in 200-400 litres of water.
    *   **Flonicamid 50% WG:** Apply at a rate of 150 g per acre, mixed in 200-400 litres of water. (This is particularly effective against aphids and whiteflies).

**Important Considerations for Chemical Application:**
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always check and strictly follow the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) mentioned on the insecticide label. This is critically important for fodder crops to prevent harmful residues in livestock feed.
*   **Spray Coverage:** Ensure thorough coverage of the plant, especially the undersides of leaves where sucking pests often reside.
*   **Rotation of Chemicals:** To prevent the development of pesticide resistance, rotate insecticides with different modes of action if multiple applications are required.
*   **Safety Precautions:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying operations.

This comprehensive approach will help manage sucking pests effectively while prioritizing the safety and sustainability of Guinea Grass cultivation for fodder in Haryana.
