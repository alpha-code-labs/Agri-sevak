As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide comprehensive guidance on managing various rot types in Guinea Grass (Panicum maximum). Rots are primarily caused by fungal pathogens, often exacerbated by environmental factors such as excessive moisture, poor drainage, and high humidity.

**General Cultural and Agronomic Practices (Foundation of Rot Control):**

Effective management of rots begins with robust cultural practices that minimize conditions favorable for pathogen development:

1.  **Site Selection and Drainage:**
    *   Choose well-drained fields. Avoid low-lying areas prone to waterlogging.
    *   Improve soil drainage through proper land preparation, raised beds, or installation of drainage channels if necessary.

2.  **Soil Health Management:**
    *   Maintain good soil structure and aeration by incorporating organic matter (e.g., well-decomposed farmyard manure or compost).
    *   Ensure balanced nutrient application. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can lead to lush, soft growth more susceptible to disease.

3.  **Irrigation Management:**
    *   Irrigate judiciously. Avoid over-irrigation, especially during cooler, humid periods.
    *   Water in the morning to allow foliage to dry before nightfall, reducing leaf wetness duration.
    *   Use drip irrigation where feasible to minimize wetting of plant crowns and stems.

4.  **Planting Density:**
    *   Maintain optimal plant spacing to ensure good air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce humidity and fungal growth.

5.  **Sanitation:**
    *   Promptly remove and destroy infected plant debris (leaves, stems, roots) to reduce inoculum sources.
    *   Clean farm equipment to prevent the spread of soil-borne pathogens.

6.  **Crop Rotation:**
    *   Practice crop rotation with non-host crops to break the disease cycle, especially for soil-borne pathogens.

7.  **Resistant Varieties:**
    *   While specific rot-resistant Guinea Grass varieties may not be widely available, selecting vigorous, locally adapted varieties can contribute to overall plant health and resilience.

**Specific Chemical Control Measures (CIBRC Approved Technical Names):**

Chemical control should be integrated with cultural practices and applied based on the specific rot type and severity.

**1. For Seed Rot and Seedling Rot (Damping-off):**
These are critical stages where pathogens like *Pythium*, *Rhizoctonia*, and *Fusarium* can cause significant losses. Seed treatment is highly recommended.

*   **Seed Treatment:**
    *   **Thiram** @ 2-3 g/kg seed.
    *   **Carbendazim** @ 1-2 g/kg seed.
    *   **Metalaxyl** @ 1-2 g/kg seed (especially effective against Oomycetes like *Pythium*). Often available in combination with **Mancozeb**.

**2. For Root, Stem, Foot, Collar, Crown, Neck, and Black Rot:**
These rots affect established plants and are often caused by a complex of fungi including *Rhizoctonia*, *Fusarium*, *Sclerotium*, *Macrophomina*, *Pythium*, and *Phytophthora*. Application methods include soil drenching or foliar sprays, depending on the chemical and target.

*   **Soil Drenching (for Root, Collar, Crown, Foot, Neck Rots):**
    *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride** @ 2-3 ml/L water, applied as a drench around the base of affected plants (effective against Oomycetes).
    *   **Metalaxyl 8% + Mancozeb 64% WP** @ 2-2.5 g/L water, applied as a drench around the root zone.
    *   **Carbendazim** @ 1-2 g/L water, applied as a drench.
    *   **Thiophanate-methyl** @ 1-1.5 g/L water, applied as a drench.

*   **Foliar Spray (for Stem, Neck, Black Rots, if systemic action is desired):**
    *   **Azoxystrobin** @ 0.5-1 ml/L water.
    *   **Pyraclostrobin** @ 0.5-0.75 ml/L water.
    *   **Copper oxychloride** @ 2-3 g/L water (broad-spectrum protectant, can be used as a spray or drench).

**Addressing "Fruit Rot":**

Guinea Grass is a forage crop that produces seeds, not botanical fruits. Therefore, "Fruit Rot" as a specific disease term is not known to affect Guinea Grass in the conventional sense. Issues affecting developing seed heads or seeds would typically fall under seed rot or inflorescence blight, which are addressed by the seed treatment and general fungicide recommendations above if applied to the reproductive structures.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Diagnosis:** Accurate diagnosis of the specific rot pathogen can help in selecting the most effective chemical.
*   **Timing:** Apply fungicides preventively or at the very early stages of disease development for best results.
*   **Rotation of Chemicals:** To prevent the development of fungicide resistance, rotate fungicides with different modes of action.
*   **Safety:** Always follow the manufacturer's instructions, wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), and observe pre-harvest intervals (PHI) if the crop is intended for fodder.

By integrating these cultural practices with judicious and targeted chemical applications, you can effectively manage rot diseases in Guinea Grass.
