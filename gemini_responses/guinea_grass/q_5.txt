As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm the following regarding the conditions you've mentioned for Guinea Grass (Panicum maximum):

*   **Scab:** This is not known to affect Guinea Grass. Scab is primarily a disease of cereals, fruits, and vegetables.
*   **Canker:** This is not known to affect Guinea Grass. Canker is a disease typically found in woody plants, causing lesions on stems and branches. Guinea Grass is a herbaceous plant.
*   **Gummosis:** This is not known to affect Guinea Grass. Gummosis is the exudation of gum from the bark of woody plants, usually in response to stress or disease.
*   **Lichen:** This is not known to affect Guinea Grass as a disease or pest requiring control measures. Lichens are symbiotic organisms (fungus and alga) that grow on surfaces like rocks, tree bark, or sometimes on the older, non-photosynthetic parts of plants. They are generally non-parasitic and do not cause damage to the grass itself.

Therefore, no specific chemical control measures are recommended for these conditions in Guinea Grass. Focus on good agronomic practices, including proper nutrient management, irrigation, and timely harvesting, to maintain healthy Guinea Grass stands.
