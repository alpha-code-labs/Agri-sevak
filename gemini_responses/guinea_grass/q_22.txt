As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following cultivation practices for Guinea Grass (Panicum maximum) in Haryana:

**Recommended Cultivation Practices for Guinea Grass:**

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   **Direct Sowing:** Guinea grass can be directly sown by broadcasting or, preferably, by line sowing. Line sowing is recommended for better weed management, inter-cultivation, and efficient fertilizer application.
    *   **Transplanting:** For faster establishment and better utilization of limited seed, transplanting rooted slips or seedlings (raised in a nursery) is a highly effective method. This is particularly useful for establishing perennial pastures.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   For direct sowing, seeds should be planted shallowly at a depth of **1-2 cm**. Deeper planting can significantly reduce germination and emergence.
    *   When transplanting slips or seedlings, ensure the root crown is at soil level, similar to its original growing depth.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   **For Line Sowing (Direct):** A spacing of **50-75 cm** between rows is generally recommended. Within the row, plants can be thinned to **30-45 cm** apart after establishment, or seeds can be sown to achieve this spacing.
    *   **For Transplanting (Slips/Seedlings):** A spacing of **50-75 cm** between rows and **30-45 cm** between plants within the row is ideal for optimal growth and fodder yield.

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   **For Direct Sowing:** A seed dose of **4-6 kg/acre** is recommended when using good quality seeds with high germination percentage.
    *   **For Transplanting:** If establishing through slips or seedlings, approximately **25,000 to 35,000 slips/seedlings per acre** would be required, depending on the chosen spacing. If raising seedlings in a nursery, a smaller quantity of seed would be used for the nursery bed.
