Rust diseases are indeed known to affect Guinea Grass (*Panicum maximum*), primarily caused by fungi such as *Puccinia panicicola* and *Uromyces setariae-italicae*. While the common names like Black, Brown, Yellow, White, and Red rust are often associated with specific cereal crops, the general category of rust diseases can manifest on Guinea Grass, leading to reduced fodder quality and yield.

As a Senior Agronomist, I recommend an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, prioritizing cultural and preventive measures, especially for fodder crops, to minimize chemical use and ensure the safety of livestock.

### Control Measures for Rust Diseases in Guinea Grass:

**A. Cultural and Preventive Measures (Primary Approach):**

1.  **Resistant Varieties:** Where available, select and plant Guinea Grass varieties known to have resistance or tolerance to common rust pathogens in the region. Consult HAU's recommendations for suitable varieties for Haryana.
2.  **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to promote good air circulation within the canopy. This helps in drying leaf surfaces quickly, reducing the duration of leaf wetness, which is crucial for rust spore germination and infection.
3.  **Balanced Fertilization:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, as it can lead to lush, succulent growth that is more susceptible to rust infections. Maintain a balanced nutrient regime based on soil test recommendations.
4.  **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest or during routine maintenance. This reduces the inoculum source for future infections.
5.  **Irrigation Management:** If using overhead irrigation, irrigate in the morning to allow foliage to dry completely before evening. Avoid late-day irrigation, which can prolong leaf wetness and favor disease development.
6.  **Crop Rotation:** While Guinea Grass is often grown as a perennial, if replanting, consider rotating with non-host crops to break the disease cycle.

**B. Chemical Control (As a Last Resort):**

Chemical control should be considered only when cultural practices are insufficient and disease severity threatens significant yield loss. **Extreme caution must be exercised when using fungicides on fodder crops due to potential residues in livestock feed.** Always adhere strictly to the pre-harvest interval (PHI) specified on the product label.

The following are CIBRC approved technical chemical names for rust control, which may be considered. However, always verify their specific approval for fodder crops and follow label instructions for dosage and safety.

*   **Propiconazole** (e.g., 25% EC formulation)
    *   **Dosage:** 0.5 - 1.0 ml per litre of water, or 200 - 400 ml per acre, depending on disease severity and product concentration.
*   **Tebuconazole** (e.g., 25.9% EC formulation)
    *   **Dosage:** 0.75 - 1.0 ml per litre of water, or 300 - 400 ml per acre, depending on disease severity and product concentration.
*   **Azoxystrobin** (e.g., 23% SC formulation)
    *   **Dosage:** 0.5 - 1.0 ml per litre of water, or 200 - 400 ml per acre, depending on disease severity and product concentration.

**Important Considerations for Chemical Application:**

*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** This is critical for fodder crops. Ensure that the recommended PHI is strictly followed before cutting or grazing the grass to prevent fungicide residues from entering the food chain.
*   **Application Timing:** Fungicides are most effective when applied preventively or at the very early stages of disease development.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage for optimal efficacy.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and application.
