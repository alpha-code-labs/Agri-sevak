As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for managing pests in Guinea Grass (*Panicum maximum*) in Haryana.

It is crucial to implement an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods, especially for fodder crops to minimize residues. Always observe the recommended pre-harvest interval (PHI) for any chemical applied to fodder crops to ensure safety for livestock.

### 1. Borers (e.g., Stem Borers)

Stem borers, such as the maize stem borer (*Chilo partellus*) or pink stem borer (*Sesamia inferens*), can affect Guinea Grass, particularly during early growth stages, leading to "dead hearts" or stunted growth.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM):**
*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Timely Sowing:** Plant at the recommended time to avoid peak pest periods.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy crop residues after harvest to eliminate overwintering larvae and pupae.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate Guinea Grass with non-host crops to break the pest cycle.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure balanced fertilization to promote vigorous plant growth, making plants more tolerant to damage.
*   **Biological Control:**
    *   Conserve natural enemies like parasitic wasps (e.g., *Trichogramma* spp.) and predatory insects.
*   **Mechanical Control:**
    *   Hand-pick and destroy affected plants showing "dead heart" symptoms in small plots.

**Chemical Control (if infestation is severe and economic threshold is crossed):**
*   **Granular Application (at early stages):**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 0.4% GR:** Apply 4 kg/acre by broadcasting in the whorls of plants, especially during early infestation.
*   **Foliar Spray (for older plants or widespread infestation):**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** 60 ml/acre in 200-300 litres of water.
    *   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG:** 80-100 g/acre in 200-300 litres of water.
    *   **Spinetoram 11.7% SC:** 120-150 ml/acre in 200-300 litres of water.

### 2. Caterpillars (General Leaf-feeding Caterpillars, e.g., Armyworms, Cutworms)

Various caterpillar species can feed on Guinea Grass leaves, causing defoliation. Fall armyworm (*Spodoptera frugiperda*) is a significant polyphagous pest that can severely damage fodder grasses.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM):**
*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Regular Scouting:** Monitor fields frequently, especially young plants, for egg masses and early instar larvae.
    *   **Weed Management:** Remove weeds that can serve as alternate hosts for caterpillars.
    *   **Deep Ploughing:** Plough fields after harvest to expose pupae to predators and sunlight.
*   **Biological Control:**
    *   **Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki (Bt):** Spray 500-1000 g/acre (or as per product label) in 200-300 litres of water. Bt is a biological insecticide specific to lepidopteran larvae and is safe for beneficial insects and livestock. Apply when caterpillars are young.
    *   Conserve natural enemies like predatory birds, spiders, and parasitic wasps.
*   **Mechanical Control:**
    *   Hand-pick and destroy egg masses and young larvae in small areas.

**Chemical Control (if infestation is severe):**
*   **Foliar Spray:**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** 60 ml/acre in 200-300 litres of water.
    *   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG:** 80-100 g/acre in 200-300 litres of water.
    *   **Spinetoram 11.7% SC:** 120-150 ml/acre in 200-300 litres of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** 100-120 ml/acre in 200-300 litres of water (use with caution, observe PHI).

### 3. Diamondback Moth (*Plutella xylostella*)

This is not known to affect Guinea Grass. Diamondback moth is a specific pest of cruciferous crops (plants belonging to the Brassicaceae family like cabbage, cauliflower, mustard, etc.) and does not feed on grasses.

### 4. Leaf Folder

Leaf folders are lepidopteran larvae that fold leaves and feed from within, causing characteristic damage. While specific leaf folders for Guinea Grass might vary, general management strategies for lepidopteran pests apply.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM):**
*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy affected leaves or plant parts.
    *   **Balanced Fertilization:** Avoid excessive nitrogen application, which can lead to lush growth favored by leaf folders.
*   **Biological Control:**
    *   **Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki (Bt):** Spray 500-1000 g/acre (or as per product label) in 200-300 litres of water, especially when larvae are young.
    *   Encourage natural enemies like spiders and parasitic wasps.

**Chemical Control (if infestation is severe):**
*   **Foliar Spray:**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** 60 ml/acre in 200-300 litres of water.
    *   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG:** 80-100 g/acre in 200-300 litres of water.
    *   **Spinetoram 11.7% SC:** 120-150 ml/acre in 200-300 litres of water.

**General Recommendations for Chemical Application:**
*   Always read and follow the label instructions for any pesticide product.
*   Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application.
*   Ensure thorough spray coverage for effective control.
*   Rotate chemicals with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension officers for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and the latest CIBRC approvals.
