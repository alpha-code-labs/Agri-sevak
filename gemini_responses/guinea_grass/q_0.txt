Namaste, Kisan Bhaiyon! As a Senior Agronomist from Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the importance of maintaining healthy Guinea Grass for optimal fodder production. Fungal diseases can significantly reduce yield and quality. Here's a scientifically verified approach to control the mentioned fungal diseases in Guinea Grass in Haryana:

**Integrated Disease Management (IDM) Approach:**
Effective control of fungal diseases in Guinea Grass relies on a combination of cultural practices and judicious use of fungicides.

**I. General Cultural Practices (Applicable to most fungal diseases):**

1.  **Resistant Varieties:** Where available, choose Guinea Grass varieties known to have resistance or tolerance to common fungal diseases.
2.  **Crop Rotation:** Avoid continuous cultivation of Guinea Grass in the same field. Rotate with non-host crops to break the disease cycle.
3.  **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest. This reduces the inoculum for the next crop.
4.  **Proper Spacing:** Maintain adequate plant spacing to ensure good air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce humidity and fungal growth.
5.  **Balanced Nutrition:** Apply fertilizers based on soil test recommendations. Avoid excessive nitrogen application, as it can make plants more susceptible to certain fungal diseases.
6.  **Water Management:**
    *   Avoid overhead irrigation late in the day, especially during humid weather, as prolonged leaf wetness promotes fungal development.
    *   Ensure good drainage in the field to prevent waterlogging.

**II. Specific Control Measures for Fungal Diseases:**

**A. For Alternaria Leaf Spot, Anthracnose, Blast, Blight, and Brown Spot (General Leaf Spot/Blight Complex):**
These diseases often manifest as spots, lesions, or blighting on leaves and stems. The control measures are largely similar.

*   **Cultural:** Implement all general cultural practices mentioned above.
*   **Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
    *   **Mancozeb 75% WP:** Apply at 2.5 kg per acre (or 3 g per litre of water) as a foliar spray. Repeat at 10-15 day intervals if the disease persists.
    *   **Propiconazole 25% EC:** Apply at 250 ml per acre (or 1 ml per litre of water) as a foliar spray. This is a systemic fungicide offering both protective and curative action.
    *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:** Apply at 200 ml per acre (or 0.5 ml per litre of water) as a foliar spray. This is a broad-spectrum systemic fungicide.
    *   **Carbendazim 50% WP:** Apply at 200-300 g per acre (or 0.5-1 g per litre of water) as a foliar spray.

**B. For Downy Mildew:**
Downy mildew typically appears as yellowish spots on the upper leaf surface with a downy growth on the underside.

*   **Cultural:** Ensure good drainage and air circulation. Remove infected plants early to prevent spread.
*   **Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
    *   **Mancozeb 75% WP:** Apply at 2.5 kg per acre (or 3 g per litre of water) as a protective spray, especially during conditions favourable for the disease.
    *   For severe outbreaks, a combination product containing **Metalaxyl + Mancozeb** (e.g., Metalaxyl 8% + Mancozeb 64% WP) can be highly effective. Apply at 2.5 kg per acre (or 3 g per litre of water). *Ensure this specific combination product is CIBRC approved for fodder crops.*

**C. For Powdery Mildew:**
Powdery mildew appears as white, powdery patches on the leaf surface, which can spread to stems and flowers.

*   **Cultural:** Ensure good air circulation. Avoid excessive nitrogen.
*   **Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
    *   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP:** Apply at 2 kg per acre (or 4-5 g per litre of water) as a foliar spray. This is a very effective and economical option for powdery mildew.
    *   **Propiconazole 25% EC:** Apply at 250 ml per acre (or 1 ml per litre of water) as a foliar spray.
    *   **Tebuconazole 25.9% EC:** Apply at 250-300 ml per acre (or 0.75-1 ml per litre of water) as a foliar spray.

**D. For Grey Mildew:**
This is not known to affect Guinea Grass as a distinct, commonly recognized disease. If you are observing greyish symptoms, it might be a manifestation of downy mildew, a general mold, or another leaf spot disease. Please consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU expert with a sample for accurate diagnosis.

**III. Important Precautions:**

*   **Read the Label:** Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the fungicide label regarding dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Since Guinea Grass is a fodder crop, pay critical attention to the PHI of any fungicide used. Ensure that the recommended waiting period between the last spray and harvesting for fodder is strictly observed to prevent residues in animal feed.
*   **Spray Uniformly:** Ensure thorough and uniform coverage of the plant foliage during spraying for best results.
*   **Rotate Fungicides:** To prevent the development of fungicide resistance, rotate fungicides with different modes of action.
*   **Safety:** Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) like gloves, masks, and protective clothing while handling and spraying chemicals.
