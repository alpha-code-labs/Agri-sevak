As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide the following scientifically verified advice on irrigation management for Sorghum (Jowar) in Haryana:

Sorghum is a relatively drought-tolerant crop, but timely and adequate irrigation, especially during critical growth stages, is essential for maximizing grain and fodder yields. The irrigation schedule largely depends on the rainfall received, soil type, and prevailing weather conditions.

### Irrigation Management in Sorghum (Jowar)

**1. First Irrigation:**

*   **Pre-sowing Irrigation (Palewa):** If the soil moisture is insufficient at the time of sowing, a pre-sowing irrigation of about 70-80 mm (7-8 cm) is highly recommended to ensure uniform germination and good crop establishment.
*   **Post-sowing First Irrigation:**
    *   If a pre-sowing irrigation was not given, or if the monsoon rains are delayed or insufficient after sowing, the first irrigation becomes crucial.
    *   **Timing:** Apply the first irrigation around **20-25 days after sowing (DAS)**. This corresponds to the knee-high stage or early vegetative growth phase, which is critical for root development and vigorous plant growth.
    *   **Depth:** Apply approximately **50-60 mm (5-6 cm)** of water.
    *   **Importance:** This irrigation helps in establishing a strong root system and supports the initial rapid vegetative growth, which sets the foundation for higher yields.

**2. Second and Subsequent Irrigations:**

The need for subsequent irrigations depends heavily on the monsoon rainfall. In years with erratic or insufficient rainfall, supplemental irrigations are vital at critical growth stages.

*   **Critical Growth Stages for Irrigation:**
    *   **Boot Stage (Panicle Initiation):** This occurs around **45-55 DAS**. Water stress at this stage can severely affect panicle development and the number of grains per panicle.
    *   **Flowering Stage:** This occurs around **60-70 DAS**. Water stress during flowering can lead to poor pollen viability, reduced fertilization, and significant yield losses.
    *   **Grain Filling Stage:** This occurs around **80-90 DAS**. Adequate moisture during this period ensures proper grain development and plumpness, contributing to higher grain weight.
*   **Frequency and Depth:**
    *   Typically, **2-3 additional irrigations** may be required if monsoon rains are inadequate.
    *   Each irrigation should apply about **50-70 mm (5-7 cm)** of water, depending on the soil type (lighter soils require more frequent, lighter irrigations; heavier soils can hold water longer).
    *   **General Guideline:** Observe the crop and soil moisture. Irrigate when the soil shows signs of dryness (e.g., wilting of leaves in the afternoon). Avoid waterlogging at all stages, as sorghum is sensitive to excessive moisture.

**3. Sprinkler Use:**

Sprinkler irrigation is an efficient method for irrigating Sorghum, especially beneficial under Haryana's conditions:

*   **Water Use Efficiency:** Sprinklers provide uniform water distribution, significantly reducing water losses due to deep percolation and surface runoff compared to flood irrigation. This is particularly important in areas with limited water availability.
*   **Suitability for Soil Types:** It is highly recommended for light-textured (sandy) soils, which have low water retention capacity, as it allows for more frequent, lighter applications without causing water stress or nutrient leaching.
*   **Undulating Terrain:** Sprinklers are ideal for fields with uneven topography where flood irrigation is difficult or inefficient.
*   **Application:** Sprinklers can be used for all irrigations, from establishment to grain filling. The application rate should be adjusted to the soil infiltration rate to prevent runoff.
*   **Fertigation:** Sprinkler systems can also be used for fertigation (applying water-soluble fertilizers along with irrigation water), which improves nutrient use efficiency.

**General Recommendation:** Monitor soil moisture regularly and irrigate based on crop needs and rainfall patterns to optimize water use and maximize Sorghum yields.
