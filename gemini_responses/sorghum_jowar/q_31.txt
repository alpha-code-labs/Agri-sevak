As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the conditions you've mentioned for Sorghum (Jowar):

1.  **Fruit bursting:**
    This is not known to affect Sorghum (Jowar). Fruit bursting is a physiological disorder typically observed in fleshy fruits (like tomato, pomegranate, citrus) due to sudden changes in water availability or nutrient imbalances, which is not relevant to sorghum grains.

2.  **Hardness in fruit:**
    This is not known to affect Sorghum (Jowar) in the context of a "physical damage" problem. Sorghum produces grains, and issues related to grain texture or quality are usually symptoms of other underlying stresses (e.g., drought, nutrient deficiency, pest damage affecting grain development) rather than a direct physical damage to be controlled.

3.  **Leaf burning/melting:**
    This condition can affect Sorghum (Jowar) and is typically a symptom of environmental stress or improper agricultural practices.

    **Causes of Leaf Burning/Melting in Sorghum:**
    *   **Heat Stress/Sun Scorch:** Prolonged exposure to very high temperatures, especially when combined with low humidity, can cause scorching of leaf tips and margins.
    *   **Drought Stress:** Severe and prolonged lack of water leads to wilting, rolling, and eventual necrosis (burning) of leaf tissue.
    *   **Chemical Phytotoxicity:** Incorrect application of agrochemicals (e.g., herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, or even high concentrations of foliar fertilizers) can cause severe leaf burn. This can be due to overdose, application during high temperatures, or drift from adjacent fields.
    *   **Nutrient Toxicity:** Excess levels of certain micronutrients (e.g., boron) in the soil or through foliar application can lead to leaf margin necrosis.

    **Control Measures:**
    Since "leaf burning/melting" is a symptom of environmental stress or improper chemical application, direct chemical "control" is generally not applicable. The focus is on preventive and management practices:

    *   **Agronomic Practices:**
        *   **Variety Selection:** Choose sorghum varieties known for their tolerance to heat and drought conditions prevalent in Haryana. Consult with HAU experts for suitable varieties.
        *   **Timely Irrigation:** Provide adequate and timely irrigation, especially during critical growth stages like flowering and grain filling, to mitigate drought stress.
        *   **Optimized Sowing Time:** Adjust sowing dates to avoid the most intense heat periods during sensitive growth phases of the crop.
        *   **Mulching:** Apply organic mulches (e.g., crop residues) to conserve soil moisture, reduce soil temperature fluctuations, and suppress weeds.
        *   **Balanced Nutrition:** Conduct regular soil testing to ensure balanced nutrient application and avoid nutrient toxicities.

    *   **Chemical Application Management:**
        *   **Adhere to Recommendations:** Strictly follow the recommended dosage, application method, and timing for all agrochemicals (herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, fertilizers) as per manufacturer guidelines and HAU recommendations.
        *   **Avoid Stressful Conditions:** Do not apply chemicals when plants are under stress (e.g., drought, extreme heat) or during high temperatures, as this increases the risk of phytotoxicity.
        *   **Proper Calibration:** Ensure spray equipment is accurately calibrated to deliver the correct amount of product.
        *   **Drift Prevention:** Take necessary precautions to prevent spray drift to non-target sorghum fields or sensitive areas.

    There are no specific CIBRC-approved technical chemical names that directly "control" physical damage like leaf burning; the solutions are entirely management-based.
