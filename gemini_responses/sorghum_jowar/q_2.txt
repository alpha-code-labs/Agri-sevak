As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice regarding rust diseases in Sorghum (Jowar) for Haryana.

First, let's clarify which of the mentioned rust diseases are known to affect Sorghum (Jowar):

*   **Black Rust (Stem Rust):** This is not known to affect Sorghum (Jowar).
*   **Brown Rust (Leaf Rust):** This is not known to affect Sorghum (Jowar).
*   **Yellow Rust (Stripe Rust):** This is not known to affect Sorghum (Jowar).
*   **White Rust:** This is not known to affect Sorghum (Jowar).

The primary rust disease affecting Sorghum (Jowar) is Sorghum Rust, caused by *Puccinia purpurea*. The term "Red Rust" is often used interchangeably with Sorghum Rust due to the reddish-brown color of the pustules.

### Control of Sorghum Rust (*Puccinia purpurea*) in Jowar

Sorghum rust is characterized by small, circular to oval, reddish-brown pustules that appear on both surfaces of the leaves, leaf sheaths, and sometimes on the stalks. These pustules rupture to release powdery spores. Severe infection can lead to premature drying of leaves and reduced grain yield.

An integrated approach combining cultural practices and timely chemical intervention is recommended for effective management.

#### 1. Cultural Practices:

*   **Resistant Varieties:** Plant rust-resistant or tolerant sorghum varieties recommended for your region. This is the most economical and effective long-term solution.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid continuous cultivation of sorghum in the same field. Rotate with non-host crops to break the disease cycle.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest to reduce the inoculum source for the next season.
*   **Balanced Fertilization:** Apply balanced nutrients, avoiding excessive nitrogen, which can make plants more susceptible to diseases.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Maintain optimal plant spacing to ensure good air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce humidity and disease development.
*   **Timely Sowing:** Sow crops at the recommended time to avoid periods highly conducive for disease development.

#### 2. Chemical Control:

Fungicides can be applied as a preventive measure or at the first appearance of symptoms, especially if weather conditions are favorable for disease development (moderate temperatures and high humidity). Always ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.

*   **Propiconazole:**
    *   Apply **Propiconazole 25% EC** at a rate of 200 ml per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water. This translates to approximately 0.7-1 ml per litre of water.
*   **Tebuconazole:**
    *   Apply **Tebuconazole 250 EC** at a rate of 200-300 ml per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water. This translates to approximately 0.7-1 ml per litre of water.
*   **Azoxystrobin:**
    *   Apply **Azoxystrobin 23% SC** at a rate of 200 ml per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water. This translates to approximately 0.7-1 ml per litre of water.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the fungicide label for correct dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for the most current recommendations and specific product availability in your area.
*   Monitor your crop regularly for early detection of disease symptoms.
