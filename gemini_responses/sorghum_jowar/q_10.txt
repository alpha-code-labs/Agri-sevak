As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Sorghum (Jowar) in Haryana:

### Control of Borers in Sorghum (Jowar)

Borers, primarily the Sorghum Stem Borer (*Chilo partellus*), are a major pest of Sorghum in Haryana.

**Cultural Practices:**
*   **Early Sowing:** Sowing sorghum early can help the crop escape peak pest incidence.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Utilize resistant or tolerant varieties recommended for the region.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy sorghum stubbles after harvest to eliminate diapausing larvae.

**Chemical Control:**
For effective control, apply insecticides at the appropriate stage, typically 10-15 days after emergence (DAE) for granular application, or upon observing initial damage for sprays.

*   **Granular Application (Whorl application):**
    *   **Carbofuran** 3G: 8 kg/acre (Apply granules into the leaf whorls)

*   **Foliar Sprays:**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC: 60 ml/acre (in 200-300 L water)
    *   **Flubendiamide** 20% WG: 50 g/acre (in 200-300 L water)
    *   **Emamectin Benzoate** 5% SG: 80-100 g/acre (in 200-300 L water)
    *   **Thiamethoxam** 12.6% + **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 9.5% ZC: 50 ml/acre (in 200-300 L water)

### Control of Caterpillars in Sorghum (Jowar)

Various defoliating caterpillars, including armyworms and the Fall Armyworm (*Spodoptera frugiperda*), can affect Sorghum.

**Cultural Practices:**
*   **Monitoring:** Regularly scout fields for early detection of egg masses and young larvae.
*   **Hand Picking:** In small areas or for low infestations, hand-picking and destroying egg masses and larvae can be effective.

**Chemical Control:**
Apply insecticides upon observing initial feeding damage or caterpillar presence.

*   **Foliar Sprays:**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC: 60 ml/acre (in 200-300 L water)
    *   **Flubendiamide** 20% WG: 50 g/acre (in 200-300 L water)
    *   **Emamectin Benzoate** 5% SG: 80-100 g/acre (in 200-300 L water)
    *   **Indoxacarb** 14.5% SC: 200 ml/acre (in 200-300 L water)
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: 100 ml/acre (in 200-300 L water)
    *   **Spinetoram** 11.7% SC: 120-150 ml/acre (in 200-300 L water)
