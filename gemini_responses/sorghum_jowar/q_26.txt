As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified information regarding specialized practices in Sorghum (Jowar) for Haryana conditions:

*   **Pruning:**
    This is not known to affect Sorghum (Jowar). Sorghum is a monocotyledonous cereal crop, and pruning, in the horticultural sense of removing branches or shaping the plant, is not a standard or beneficial practice for its cultivation.

*   **Desuckering:**
    This is not known to affect Sorghum (Jowar) as a standard practice. Sorghum naturally produces tillers (often referred to as suckers). In most sorghum cultivation systems, tillering is a desirable trait as it contributes to overall grain yield and biomass, especially in fodder varieties or under optimal growing conditions. Removing tillers would generally reduce the yield potential.

*   **Mulching:**
    Mulching is a highly beneficial practice for Sorghum (Jowar) cultivation, particularly in regions like Haryana, which often experience water stress.
    *   **Benefits:**
        *   **Moisture Conservation:** Reduces evaporation from the soil surface, conserving precious soil moisture.
        *   **Weed Suppression:** Acts as a physical barrier, inhibiting weed germination and growth, thereby reducing competition for nutrients and water.
        *   **Soil Temperature Regulation:** Keeps the soil cooler during hot periods and warmer during cooler periods, creating a more stable root environment.
        *   **Soil Health Improvement:** Organic mulches decompose over time, adding organic matter to the soil, improving soil structure, and enhancing microbial activity.
        *   **Erosion Control:** Protects the soil surface from the impact of raindrops and wind, reducing soil erosion.
    *   **Materials:** Common mulching materials include crop residues (e.g., wheat straw, rice straw, sorghum stover), dry leaves, or even plastic films (though organic mulches are preferred for soil health benefits).
    *   **Application:** Apply a layer of mulch (typically 5-10 cm thick) on the soil surface after sowing or after crop establishment, ensuring it does not smother young seedlings.

*   **Grafting:**
    This is not known to affect Sorghum (Jowar). Grafting is a horticultural technique primarily used for woody plants or certain dicotyledonous vegetables to combine desirable traits of a scion and a rootstock. Sorghum is a monocotyledonous annual cereal crop, and grafting is not a feasible or practiced technique for its cultivation.

*   **Pollination:**
    Sorghum (Jowar) is primarily a self-pollinated crop. The flowers are hermaphroditic (contain both male and female parts) and are typically pollinated before or shortly after the anthers emerge from the glumes. While some degree of cross-pollination (up to 5-10%) can occur, mainly facilitated by wind, specialized practices like hand-pollination or reliance on specific insect pollinators are not required for commercial grain production in sorghum. Its self-pollinating nature ensures reliable seed set.
