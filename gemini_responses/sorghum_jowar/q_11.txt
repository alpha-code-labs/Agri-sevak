As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies in Sorghum (Jowar) in Haryana:

### Control of Beetles in Sorghum (Jowar)

In Sorghum, the primary beetle pests of concern are Blister Beetles (feeding on earheads) and White Grubs (root feeders).

**1. Blister Beetles (Mylabris spp., Epicauta spp.)**
These beetles are active during the flowering and grain-filling stages, feeding on pollen and developing grains in the earhead.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Manual collection and destruction of beetles in the early morning or late evening when they are less active, especially in small plots.
*   **Chemical Control (Spray on earheads at infestation):**
    *   **Malathion** 50% EC: 400 ml per acre in 200-300 litres of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: 100-125 ml per acre in 200-300 litres of water.

**2. White Grubs (Holotrichia spp.)**
The larvae (grubs) of these beetles reside in the soil and feed on the roots of young sorghum plants, leading to wilting and plant death. Adults are nocturnal beetles.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Deep ploughing during summer to expose grubs and pupae to predators and sunlight.
    *   Collection and destruction of adult beetles attracted to light traps or host trees (e.g., neem, babul) during their emergence period (monsoon onset).
*   **Chemical Control (Soil application at sowing):**
    *   **Phorate** 10% GR: 4 kg per acre, applied in furrows at the time of sowing.
    *   **Carbofuran** 3% GR: 13 kg per acre, applied in furrows at the time of sowing.
    *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: 1.6 litres per acre, mixed with irrigation water or as a soil drench at sowing.

### Control of Weevils in Sorghum (Jowar)

Weevils are generally not considered major field pests of Sorghum (Jowar) during its growth period in Haryana. While some minor species might occasionally be present, they typically do not cause economic damage requiring specific control measures in the field. Grain weevils (e.g., *Sitophilus oryzae*) are primarily pests of stored sorghum grain.

### Control of Sawflies in Sorghum (Jowar)

This is not known to affect Sorghum (Jowar) as a significant pest in Haryana. Sawflies are generally not listed as major pests of sorghum in India.
