Both Scale insects and Mealybugs are known to affect Sorghum (Jowar) in Haryana, causing significant sap loss and weakening the plants. Effective control involves a combination of cultural practices and timely chemical intervention.

**Integrated Management for Scale Insects and Mealybugs in Sorghum (Jowar):**

1.  **Monitoring and Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Regular Scouting:** Frequently inspect sorghum plants, especially the undersides of leaves, leaf sheaths, and stem bases, for early signs of infestation.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy severely infested plant parts or whole plants to prevent the spread of pests.
    *   **Weed Management:** Control weeds in and around the sorghum field, as many weeds can serve as alternate hosts for these pests.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation to break the pest cycle.
    *   **Proper Nutrition:** Ensure balanced fertilization, as overly succulent growth due to excessive nitrogen can sometimes favor sucking pests.

2.  **Chemical Control (when infestation is severe and crosses economic threshold):**
    *   For effective control, especially against scale insects and mealybugs which are often protected by waxy coverings, systemic insecticides are generally preferred.
    *   Ensure thorough spray coverage, targeting the areas where pests are concentrated, including the undersides of leaves and stem bases. Use sufficient water volume (typically 200-300 litres per acre) for optimal coverage.

    The following CIBRC approved technical chemicals are recommended for controlling scale insects and mealybugs in Sorghum (Jowar):

    *   **Dimethoate** 30% EC: 660 ml per acre
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: 125 ml per acre
    *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: 100 g per acre
    *   **Buprofezin** 25% SC: 600-800 ml per acre (particularly effective against nymphs and for its insect growth regulator action)
    *   **Spirotetramat** 150 OD: 200-250 ml per acre (highly effective against mealybugs due to its dual systemic action)

    Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions when handling and applying pesticides. It is advisable to rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
