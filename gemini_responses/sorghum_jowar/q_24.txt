Sorghum (Jowar) is primarily cultivated through direct seeding in Haryana, as transplantation is generally not the ideal or recommended practice for commercial production. While sorghum *can* be transplanted in specific experimental or very small-scale scenarios, it is not a common or efficient method for large-scale cultivation due to factors such as potential root damage, transplant shock, higher labor requirements, and often reduced establishment success compared to direct seeding.

Therefore, the following information pertains to the ideal practices for **direct seeding** of Sorghum (Jowar):

**1. Ideal Sowing Time:**
*   **Kharif Season:** The optimal time for sowing Kharif sorghum in Haryana is from the last week of June to the first fortnight of July, coinciding with the onset of monsoon rains. Early sowing can help mitigate the incidence of shoot fly.

**2. Ideal Sowing Distance:**
*   **Row-to-Row Spacing:** 45-50 cm
*   **Plant-to-Plant Spacing:** 12-15 cm (after thinning)

**3. Ideal Sowing Process:**
*   **Seed Rate:**
    *   For grain purpose: 8-10 kg/acre
    *   For fodder purpose: 15-20 kg/acre
*   **Sowing Depth:** 2.5-3.0 cm. Ensure uniform depth for better germination.
*   **Method:** Seeds are typically sown using a seed drill to ensure uniform spacing and depth. Ensure adequate soil moisture at the time of sowing for optimal germination.
*   **Thinning:** Thinning should be carried out 10-15 days after emergence to achieve the desired plant-to-plant spacing and maintain an optimal plant population.
