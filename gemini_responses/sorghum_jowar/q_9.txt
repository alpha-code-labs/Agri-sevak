As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm that Red spider mite (e.g., *Oligonychus indicus*) and Rust mite (*Aceria sorghi*) are known pests of Sorghum (Jowar) in our region, especially during dry and warm weather conditions. Effective management is crucial to prevent yield losses.

Here's a scientifically verified approach for controlling mites in Sorghum:

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategy:**

1.  **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect the underside of leaves for mite presence, webbing (for red spider mites), or bronzing/rusting symptoms (for rust mites). Early detection is key.

2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Timely Sowing:** Sow sorghum at the recommended time to avoid peak mite infestation periods.
    *   **Weed Management:** Remove weeds from and around the field, as many weeds can act as alternate hosts for mites.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can make plants more succulent and attractive to mites. Maintain balanced nutrition.
    *   **Irrigation:** Provide adequate irrigation, especially during dry spells, as water stress can exacerbate mite problems. Overhead irrigation can sometimes help wash off mites.

3.  **Chemical Control (Acaricides):**
    When mite populations reach economic threshold levels, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development. Ensure thorough coverage, especially on the underside of leaves where mites reside.

    The following CIBRC approved technical chemicals are recommended for mite control in Sorghum:

    *   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP:** Apply **2.5 kg per acre** mixed in 500-600 litres of water. Sulphur acts as a contact acaricide and also has fungicidal properties.
    *   **Propargite 57% EC:** Apply **1.0 - 1.25 Litres per acre** mixed in 200-400 litres of water. This is a specific acaricide effective against various mite species.
    *   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** Apply **125 ml per acre** mixed in 200-400 litres of water. This acaricide is effective against all developmental stages of mites (eggs, nymphs, and adults).

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label carefully before use.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying.
*   Spray during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer for the most current recommendations and economic threshold levels specific to your area in Haryana.
