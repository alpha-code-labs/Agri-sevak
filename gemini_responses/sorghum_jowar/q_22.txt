As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following cultivation practices for Sorghum (Jowar) in Haryana:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   **Line Sowing:** This is the most recommended method. It facilitates efficient intercultivation, weeding, fertilizer application, and plant protection measures.
    *   **Drill Sowing:** Using a seed drill ensures uniform depth and spacing, leading to better germination and stand establishment.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   Sorghum seeds should be sown at a depth of **2-4 cm**. Sowing too deep can hinder emergence, while too shallow can lead to poor germination due to moisture stress or bird damage.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   **For Grain Sorghum:**
        *   **Row-to-row:** 45-60 cm
        *   **Plant-to-plant:** 10-15 cm
    *   **For Fodder Sorghum:**
        *   **Row-to-row:** 30-45 cm (can be slightly denser)
        *   **Plant-to-plant:** 10-15 cm (or even closer for higher biomass)

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   **For Grain Sorghum:** 8-10 kg/acre
    *   **For Fodder Sorghum:** 15-20 kg/acre (to achieve a higher plant population for increased biomass)
    *   **For Dual-Purpose Varieties:** 10-12 kg/acre
