As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an integrated disease management approach for controlling various rot types in Sorghum (Jowar), focusing on prevention and timely intervention based on scientifically verified practices for Haryana.

**1. Rots Not Known to Affect Sorghum (Jowar):**

*   **Black Rot:** This is not known to affect Sorghum (Jowar). It is primarily a bacterial disease of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower).
*   **Fruit Rot:** This is not known to affect Sorghum (Jowar). Sorghum produces grains, and while grain molds can occur, "fruit rot" as a distinct disease term is not applicable to Sorghum.

**2. Rots Affecting Sorghum (Jowar) and their Control:**

**A. Stalk Rot Complex (Including Root Rot, Stem Rot, Foot Rot, Collar Rot, Crown Rot, Neck Rot)**
These rots are often caused by a complex of soil-borne and stubble-borne fungi such as *Macrophomina phaseolina* (Charcoal Rot), *Fusarium verticillioides* (Fusarium Stalk Rot), *Rhizoctonia solani*, and *Sclerotium rolfsii*. Symptoms include premature drying of leaves, lodging of plants, shredding of internal stalk tissues, and discolored roots/stems.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Resistant Varieties:** Plant sorghum varieties known to have resistance or tolerance to stalk rots. Consult HAU for recommended varieties suitable for your specific region and soil type.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Implement a crop rotation system with non-host crops (e.g., legumes, wheat) for at least 2-3 years to reduce the build-up of pathogen inoculum in the soil.
    *   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure adequate and balanced fertilization, particularly potassium (K). Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can make plants more susceptible to stalk rots.
    *   **Water Management:** Avoid both severe drought stress (especially during the grain filling stage) and waterlogging. Provide critical irrigation during dry spells to minimize plant stress.
    *   **Timely Sowing:** Sow sorghum at the optimal time to ensure plants mature before severe environmental stresses (e.g., high temperatures, drought) occur.
    *   **Residue Management:** Remove or deeply plough in infected crop residues after harvest to reduce inoculum sources for the next season.
    *   **Weed Control:** Effectively manage weeds, as they compete for water and nutrients, potentially stressing the crop and increasing susceptibility to diseases.

*   **Biological Control:**
    *   Seed treatment or soil application with bio-agents can help suppress soil-borne pathogens.
        *   **Trichoderma viride:** Apply 4 g/kg seed as a seed treatment, or 2.5 kg/acre mixed with 50 kg farmyard manure (FYM) for soil application before sowing.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Seed Treatment (for early protection against soil-borne pathogens):**
        *   **Carbendazim** 1-2 g/kg seed
        *   **Thiram** 2-3 g/kg seed
        *   **Captan** 2-3 g/kg seed
        *   **Tebuconazole** 1-1.5 ml/kg seed (liquid formulation) or 1-1.5 g/kg seed (powder formulation)
        *   **Carboxin + Thiram** (combination product) 2-3 g/kg seed
    *   **Soil Drenching (for localized outbreaks or high-value crops, less practical for large fields):**
        *   **Carbendazim** 1-2 g/L water, applied around the base of affected plants.
        *   **Propiconazole** 1 ml/L water, applied around the base of affected plants.

**B. Seed Rot and Seedling Rot (Damping-off)**
These conditions lead to poor germination, pre-emergence damping-off (seeds rot before emerging), or post-emergence damping-off (seedlings emerge but collapse and die). They are primarily caused by soil-borne fungi like *Pythium* spp., *Rhizoctonia solani*, and *Fusarium* spp.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Quality Seed:** Use healthy, certified, disease-free seeds with high germination vigor.
    *   **Optimal Sowing:** Sow at the correct depth and when soil moisture and temperature are optimal for rapid germination and emergence. Avoid sowing in overly wet or cold soils, which can favor pathogen development.
    *   **Good Seedbed Preparation:** Ensure a fine, firm, and well-drained seedbed for uniform germination and reduced stress on emerging seedlings.

*   **Chemical Control (Seed Treatment is the most effective method):**
    *   **Thiram** 2-3 g/kg seed
    *   **Captan** 2-3 g/kg seed
    *   **Metalaxyl** 1-2 g/kg seed (especially effective against Oomycetes like *Pythium* spp.)
    *   **Carbendazim** 1-2 g/kg seed
    *   **Tebuconazole** 1-1.5 ml/kg seed (liquid formulation) or 1-1.5 g/kg seed (powder formulation)
    *   **Carboxin + Thiram** (combination product) 2-3 g/kg seed
    *   **Azoxystrobin** 1-2 ml/kg seed

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and strictly follow the label instructions for any pesticide product regarding dosage, application method, pre-harvest interval, and safety precautions.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions, the prevailing disease pressure, and the availability of approved products.
*   Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is crucial for sustainable and effective disease control, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods.
