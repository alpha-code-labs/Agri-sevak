As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the use of growth regulators and micronutrients in Sorghum (Jowar) for Haryana conditions:

It is crucial to understand the specific roles and recommendations for each substance.

*   **Ethephon (Ethrel)**
    This is not a standard or recommended growth regulator for routine application in Sorghum (Jowar) for yield enhancement or growth manipulation in Haryana. Its primary applications are in other crops for fruit ripening, flowering induction, or height reduction, which are not typically recommended practices for Sorghum (Jowar) in our region.

*   **2,4-D**
    This is primarily a selective herbicide used for broadleaf weed control. While 2,4-D can exhibit growth regulator effects at extremely low concentrations, its use as a growth regulator in Sorghum (Jowar) is **not recommended**. Applying 2,4-D at doses intended for growth regulation is highly risky and can easily lead to phytotoxicity, severe deformities, or even death of the Sorghum plants. Its application in Sorghum (Jowar) should strictly be limited to its approved use as a herbicide for weed management, following specific label instructions and recommended doses for that purpose.

*   **Boron**
    Boron is an essential micronutrient, not a hormone or growth regulator in the same sense as Ethephon or 2,4-D. It plays a vital role in cell wall formation, sugar transport, pollen germination, and seed development. Boron deficiency can significantly impact Sorghum (Jowar) yield and quality.

    *   **Recommendation for Boron:**
        The application of Boron should ideally be based on soil test reports indicating a deficiency. However, if deficiency symptoms are observed or as a general prophylactic measure in areas known for Boron deficiency, foliar application can be beneficial.

        *   **Foliar Application:**
            *   **Chemical:** **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (e.g., Solubor)
            *   **Dose:** 0.5 - 1.0 g/L of water.
            *   **Application Timing:** Apply as a foliar spray at the pre-flowering or boot stage, or when deficiency symptoms (e.g., poor panicle development, sterile florets) are observed. Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.

**Important Note:** Always consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your field's soil conditions and the Sorghum (Jowar) variety being cultivated. Balanced nutrient management is key to healthy crop growth and optimal yields.
