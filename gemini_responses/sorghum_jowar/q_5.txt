As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned conditions in Sorghum (Jowar) in Haryana:

### Control of Scab, Canker, Gummosis, and Lichen in Sorghum (Jowar)

**1. Scab (Sorghum Grain Mold/Head Blight)**

Sorghum is susceptible to grain molds, often caused by various fungi including *Fusarium* species, which can lead to symptoms sometimes broadly referred to as scab or head blight. This is a significant issue, especially under humid conditions during grain filling.

*   **Symptoms:** Discoloration of grains (pink, black, grey), reduced grain size and quality, fungal growth on the panicle, and potential mycotoxin contamination.

*   **Control Measures:**

    *   **Cultural Practices:**
        *   **Resistant Varieties:** Plant sorghum varieties known to have resistance or tolerance to grain molds. Consult HAU recommendations for suitable varieties for Haryana.
        *   **Timely Sowing:** Sow at the recommended time to ensure grain maturity occurs during drier periods, reducing exposure to high humidity.
        *   **Proper Spacing:** Maintain optimal plant spacing to ensure good air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce humidity around the developing panicles.
        *   **Balanced Nutrition:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush growth and increased susceptibility.
        *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest to reduce inoculum for the next season.
        *   **Timely Harvest:** Harvest the crop as soon as it reaches physiological maturity to minimize exposure to adverse weather conditions and fungal development.

    *   **Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
        Fungicide application can be considered if weather conditions are highly conducive for disease development during the flowering and grain-filling stages.

        *   **Propiconazole** 25% EC: Apply at 400 ml per acre mixed in 200-400 litres of water (approximately 1-2 ml per litre of water).
        *   **Tebuconazole** 25% EC: Apply at 500 ml per acre mixed in 200-400 litres of water (approximately 1.25-2.5 ml per litre of water).

        *Note: These fungicides are broad-spectrum and registered for other fungal diseases in sorghum (e.g., rust, smut, leaf spot) and can provide control against grain molds when applied preventively or at early symptom onset.*

**2. Canker**

This is not known to affect Sorghum (Jowar). Canker is typically a disease of woody plants or specific bacterial/fungal diseases in other crops, characterized by localized necrotic lesions on stems or branches. Sorghum can suffer from stem rots, but these are not generally termed "canker."

**3. Gummosis**

This is not known to affect Sorghum (Jowar). Gummosis is a pathological condition primarily affecting woody plants, where gum exudes from the bark, usually in response to stress or disease. It is not a characteristic disease or symptom of sorghum.

**4. Lichen**

This is not known to affect Sorghum (Jowar). Lichens are symbiotic organisms (fungus and alga) that grow on surfaces such as tree bark, rocks, or soil. They are non-parasitic and do not cause disease or harm to crop plants like sorghum. Their presence on plant surfaces is generally harmless and does not require control.
