As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach for controlling sucking pests in Sorghum (Jowar). This involves a combination of cultural, biological, and chemical methods to ensure sustainable and effective pest management.

**Regarding Psylla:**
This is not known to affect Sorghum (Jowar) as an economic pest. Psyllids are highly host-specific, and sorghum is not a typical host for species that cause significant damage.

For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips, consider the following strategies:

**I. Cultural and Agronomic Practices:**

*   **Resistant Varieties:** Opt for sorghum varieties known to have tolerance or resistance to common sucking pests, if available and suitable for your region.
*   **Timely Sowing:** Sow sorghum at the recommended time to avoid peak pest infestations, which often coincide with specific crop growth stages.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy crop residues after harvest to reduce overwintering pest populations. Control weeds in and around the field, as they can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, as it can lead to lush growth that attracts sucking pests and makes plants more susceptible. Maintain balanced nutrition.
*   **Water Management:** Ensure proper irrigation, as water stress can sometimes exacerbate pest problems.

**II. Biological Control:**

*   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Protect and encourage natural predators (e.g., ladybird beetles, lacewings, hoverfly larvae) and parasitoids (e.g., parasitic wasps) that feed on aphids, whiteflies, and leafhoppers. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides unless absolutely necessary.
*   **Biopesticides:** In early stages of infestation, consider using neem-based formulations (e.g., Azadirachtin 1500 ppm or 3000 ppm) at a dose of 5 ml/L of water. These act as antifeedants and growth regulators.

**III. Chemical Control (When necessary):**

Chemical intervention should be considered when pest populations reach economic threshold levels. Always follow label instructions and safety precautions. Ensure thorough coverage of the plant, especially the undersides of leaves where many sucking pests reside.

*   **For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips:**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at 125-150 ml per acre (or 0.5-0.6 ml/L of water).
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at 50-100 g per acre (or 0.2-0.4 g/L of water).
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply at 80-100 g per acre (or 0.3-0.4 g/L of water).
    *   **Dimethoate 30% EC:** Apply at 330-400 ml per acre (or 1.5-2 ml/L of water).
    *   **Flonicamid 50% WG:** Apply at 60-80 g per acre (or 0.3 g/L of water), particularly effective against aphids and whiteflies.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Rotation of Chemicals:** To prevent the development of pesticide resistance, rotate insecticides with different modes of action.
*   **Timing of Application:** Apply insecticides during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and application.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Be mindful of the pre-harvest interval for any chemical applied to ensure the safety of the harvested grain.

For specific recommendations tailored to your local conditions and current pest pressure, it is always advisable to consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts.
