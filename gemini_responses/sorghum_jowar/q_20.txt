As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the critical importance of balanced nutrition for optimal Sorghum (Jowar) yield and quality. Micronutrient deficiencies can significantly impact crop health.

The first and most crucial step in addressing any nutrient deficiency is a **soil test**. This provides a precise understanding of the nutrient status of your field and allows for targeted application, preventing unnecessary expenditure and potential toxicity. Once a deficiency is confirmed, the following scientifically verified recommendations can be adopted for Sorghum (Jowar):

### Addressing Micro-nutrient Deficiencies in Sorghum (Jowar)

**General Recommendation:** For foliar applications, ensure good spray coverage and apply during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to maximize absorption and minimize leaf scorch. Repeat applications may be necessary depending on the severity of the deficiency and crop response.

#### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

Zinc deficiency is common in Haryana soils, especially in high pH conditions. Symptoms include stunted growth, interveinal chlorosis (whitish bands) on younger leaves, and reddish-brown spots.

*   **Soil Application (Pre-sowing or at sowing):**
    *   Apply 25 kg/acre of **Zinc sulfate heptahydrate**.
*   **Foliar Application (at 30-45 days after sowing or upon symptom appearance):**
    *   Spray 0.5% solution (5 g/L) of **Zinc sulfate heptahydrate**.
    *   Alternatively, spray 0.1% solution (1 g/L) of **Zinc EDTA**.

#### 2. Iron (Fe) / Ferrous Deficiency

Iron deficiency is often observed in calcareous (high pH) soils, leading to interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, which can turn almost white in severe cases.

*   **Foliar Application (upon symptom appearance):**
    *   Spray 0.5-1.0% solution (5-10 g/L) of **Ferrous sulfate heptahydrate**.
    *   Adding 0.1% citric acid (1 g/L) can improve absorption. Repeat after 10-15 days if symptoms persist.

#### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

Boron deficiency can lead to poor panicle development, sterility, malformed grains, and thickening/brittleness of leaves.

*   **Foliar Application (at pre-flowering/boot stage):**
    *   Spray 0.1-0.2% solution (1-2 g/L) of **Borax (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate)**.
    *   Alternatively, spray 0.1-0.2% solution (1-2 g/L) of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate**.

#### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

Calcium deficiency is less common in field-grown sorghum unless soil pH is extremely low or high, or there's severe drought stress. Symptoms affect growing points, leading to distorted young leaves and poor root development.

*   **Foliar Application (upon symptom appearance):**
    *   Spray 0.5-1.0% solution (5-10 g/L) of **Calcium nitrate**.
*   **Soil Application (for long-term correction in acidic soils):**
    *   Apply **Gypsum (Calcium sulfate dihydrate)** as per soil test recommendations to improve soil structure and provide calcium.

#### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

Magnesium deficiency typically appears as interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, with veins remaining green. In severe cases, purplish discoloration may occur.

*   **Soil Application (Pre-sowing or at sowing, if severe):**
    *   Apply 10-20 kg/acre of **Magnesium sulfate heptahydrate**.
*   **Foliar Application (upon symptom appearance):**
    *   Spray 0.5-1.0% solution (5-10 g/L) of **Magnesium sulfate heptahydrate**.

#### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

Manganese deficiency can cause interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, often appearing as a "netting" pattern, sometimes with necrotic spots. It is more common in high pH soils.

*   **Foliar Application (upon symptom appearance):**
    *   Spray 0.2-0.5% solution (2-5 g/L) of **Manganese sulfate monohydrate**. Repeat after 10-15 days if necessary.
