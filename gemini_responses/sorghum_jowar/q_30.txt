As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for managing growth issues in Sorghum (Jowar) in Haryana:

It is crucial to first identify the specific cause of the growth issue, as management strategies vary significantly. A soil test is highly recommended to determine nutrient deficiencies.

### 1. Slow Growth

Slow growth in Sorghum can be attributed to various factors including nutrient deficiencies, water stress, pest infestations, or soil issues.

*   **Nutrient Deficiencies:**
    *   **Nitrogen (N) Deficiency:** General yellowing, stunted growth.
        *   Apply **Urea** (46% N) @ 50-60 kg/acre as a top dressing, split into two doses (20-25 days after sowing and 40-45 days after sowing).
        *   For immediate relief, a foliar spray of 2% **Urea** solution (20 g/L water) can be applied.
    *   **Phosphorus (P) Deficiency:** Purplish discoloration of leaves, stunted growth.
        *   Ensure adequate basal application of **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5) @ 50-60 kg/acre or **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5) @ 150-200 kg/acre at the time of sowing.
    *   **Zinc (Zn) Deficiency:** Whitish-yellow bands on leaves, stunted growth.
        *   Apply **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (21% Zn) @ 10-12 kg/acre as a basal application.
        *   For standing crop, foliar spray of 0.5% **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** solution (5 g/L water) mixed with 0.25% lime (2.5 g/L water) can be done.
*   **Water Stress:**
    *   Ensure timely and adequate irrigation, especially during critical growth stages (seedling, flowering, grain filling). Avoid both drought and waterlogging.
*   **Pest Infestations:**
    *   **Sorghum Shoot Fly (Atherigona soccata):** Causes "dead heart" in young plants, leading to stunted growth.
        *   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds with **Thiamethoxam** 70 WS @ 3 g/kg seed.
        *   **Foliar/Whorl Application:** Apply **Carbofuran** 3G granules @ 3-4 kg/acre in the leaf whorls of young plants (7-10 days after emergence).
    *   **Stem Borer (Chilo partellus):** Causes shot-hole damage and dead hearts.
        *   **Foliar Spray:** Spray with **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5 SC @ 0.4 ml/L water or **Emamectin benzoate** 5 SG @ 0.4 g/L water.
        *   **Whorl Application:** Apply **Carbofuran** 3G granules @ 3-4 kg/acre in the leaf whorls.
*   **Weed Competition:**
    *   Control weeds through timely manual weeding or appropriate herbicide application.

### 2. Yellow Growth (Chlorosis)

Yellowing of Sorghum leaves can indicate various nutrient deficiencies or environmental stresses.

*   **Nitrogen (N) Deficiency:** General yellowing, starting from older leaves.
    *   Apply **Urea** (46% N) @ 50-60 kg/acre as a top dressing.
    *   Foliar spray of 2% **Urea** solution (20 g/L water).
*   **Iron (Fe) Deficiency:** Interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, common in calcareous soils.
    *   Foliar spray of 0.5% **Ferrous sulphate** (19% Fe) solution (5 g/L water) mixed with 0.25% lime (2.5 g/L water). Repeat after 7-10 days if necessary.
    *   Soil application of **Ferrous sulphate** @ 10-20 kg/acre can be done in severe cases.
*   **Zinc (Zn) Deficiency:** Whitish-yellow bands on leaves, stunted growth.
    *   Foliar spray of 0.5% **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** solution (5 g/L water) mixed with 0.25% lime (2.5 g/L water).
*   **Sulphur (S) Deficiency:** General yellowing of younger leaves.
    *   Apply **Elemental Sulphur** (90%) @ 8-10 kg/acre or **Gypsum** (13-18% S) @ 100-200 kg/acre as a basal application.
*   **Waterlogging:**
    *   Improve field drainage to prevent water stagnation, which can lead to root damage and nutrient uptake issues.

### 3. Excessive Height

Excessive height in Sorghum can lead to lodging (falling over), especially under strong winds or heavy rains, impacting yield.

*   **Balanced Nutrient Management:**
    *   Avoid excessive application of Nitrogen, which promotes vegetative growth and height. Base N application on soil test recommendations.
    *   Ensure adequate Potassium (K) application, as it strengthens stems and reduces lodging risk. Apply **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** (60% K2O) @ 30-40 kg/acre as a basal dose.
*   **Optimal Plant Density:**
    *   Maintain recommended plant spacing (e.g., 45 cm row-to-row and 12-15 cm plant-to-plant) to prevent competition for light, which can lead to etiolation (stretching for light).
*   **Variety Selection:**
    *   Choose Sorghum varieties that are known to be lodging-resistant and have a moderate height suitable for your region.

### 4. Excessive Flowering

"Excessive flowering" is generally not considered a growth issue in Sorghum, as flowering is a prerequisite for grain formation. However, if it refers to *premature* flowering or *unproductive* flowering (e.g., many tillers flowering but not setting grain well), it often indicates stress.

*   **Stress Management:**
    *   **Water Stress:** Ensure consistent water availability, especially during the reproductive stages. Both drought and waterlogging can induce stress.
    *   **Nutrient Stress:** Maintain a balanced nutrient supply throughout the crop cycle. Deficiencies or imbalances can trigger premature flowering or affect grain development.
    *   **Temperature Stress:** Extreme temperatures (very high or very low) can affect flowering and grain set. Choose varieties adapted to the local climate.
*   **Variety Selection:**
    *   Select varieties that are well-adapted to the local growing season and have a stable flowering and maturity period.

Always consult with local agricultural extension services or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions.
