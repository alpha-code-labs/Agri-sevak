As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), here is the scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Sorghum (Jowar) in Haryana:

### 1. Grasshopper

*   **Impact on Sorghum (Jowar):** Grasshoppers are polyphagous pests that can cause significant defoliation in sorghum, especially during seedling and vegetative stages, leading to reduced plant vigour and yield.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Cultural/Mechanical:**
        *   Deep ploughing after harvest helps expose grasshopper eggs to predators and adverse weather conditions, reducing subsequent populations.
        *   Hand-picking of nymphs and adults in early stages of infestation can be effective in small fields.
    *   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
        *   **Malathion** 50% EC: 1.25 L per acre in 500 L of water.
        *   **Quinalphos** 25% EC: 1.0 L per acre in 500 L of water.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: 200 ml per acre in 200-400 L of water.
        *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: 1.0 L per acre in 500 L of water.

### 2. Painted bug (Bagrada hilaris)

*   This is not known to affect Sorghum (Jowar).

### 3. Red cotton bug (Dysdercus cingulatus)

*   This is not known to affect Sorghum (Jowar).

### 4. Black ants

*   **Impact on Sorghum (Jowar):** Black ants are generally not considered a primary pest causing direct damage to Sorghum (Jowar) plants. They are often found in association with honeydew-producing insects like aphids or mealybugs, feeding on their excretions. They may also sometimes remove seeds during sowing, but this is less common in standing crops.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Management of Primary Pests:** Controlling the primary honeydew-producing pests (e.g., aphids, mealybugs) will indirectly manage ant populations by removing their food source.
    *   **Specific Chemical Control:** Specific chemical recommendations for black ants as a primary pest in standing sorghum are not typically provided by the Central Insecticides Board & Registration Committee (CIBRC).
