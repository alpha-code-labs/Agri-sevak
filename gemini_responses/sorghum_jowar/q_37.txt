Wild animals, such as Nilgai (Blue Bull), Wild Boar, and Monkeys, can cause significant damage to Sorghum (Jowar) crops in Haryana. Effective management strategies primarily involve physical barriers and deterrents. Chemical repellents for large wild animals are generally not recommended for direct application on food crops due to safety and efficacy concerns, and there are no widely approved CIBRC technical chemicals specifically for this purpose on sorghum.

Here are the recommended methods to protect Sorghum (Jowar) from wild animals:

*   **Physical Barriers:**
    *   **Fencing:** Erecting strong fences around the field is one of the most effective methods.
        *   **Barbed Wire Fencing:** Multiple strands of barbed wire can deter larger animals like Nilgai and Wild Boar.
        *   **Stone Walls/Hedges:** Traditional stone walls or dense thorny hedges (e.g., *Prosopis juliflora* or *Acacia nilotica* where appropriate and managed) can also provide a barrier.
        *   **Electric Fencing:** While highly effective, electric fences require careful installation, maintenance, and strict adherence to safety regulations to prevent harm to humans and non-target animals. Farmers must ensure proper earthing and prominent warning signs.
    *   **Trenching:** Digging a deep trench around the field can deter animals like Wild Boar from entering.

*   **Deterrents and Scare Tactics:**
    *   **Human Presence/Guarding:** Stationing guards, especially during vulnerable crop stages (e.g., grain filling to maturity), is a traditional and often effective method. This can be done individually or through community-based efforts.
    *   **Scarecrows and Visual Deterrents:** Placing scarecrows, reflective ribbons, or old clothes can temporarily deter some animals, especially birds and monkeys. Their effectiveness is often short-lived as animals tend to habituate.
    *   **Sound Devices:** Using crackers, drums, or other noise-making devices at irregular intervals can scare away animals. Automated sound devices can also be employed.
    *   **Light and Fire:** Using bright lights or small fires at night can deter nocturnal animals like Wild Boar.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Synchronized Sowing:** Encouraging synchronized sowing and harvesting within a village or cluster of villages can reduce the pressure on individual fields, as the damage gets distributed over a larger area.
    *   **Harvesting Promptly:** Harvesting the crop as soon as it matures reduces the window of vulnerability to animal damage.

*   **Community-Based Approaches:**
    *   **Collective Protection:** Villages can organize collective efforts for guarding fields, erecting common fences, or managing animal populations where permissible and regulated by forest departments.

**Regarding Chemical Repellents:**
As a Senior Agronomist, I must emphasize that there are no CIBRC approved technical chemical names specifically recommended for direct application on Sorghum (Jowar) as repellents for large wild animals like Nilgai or Wild Boar. The primary focus remains on physical barriers and deterrents.
