As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for managing viral diseases in Sorghum (Jowar) in Haryana.

It is important to understand that there is no direct chemical cure for viral diseases once a plant is infected. Management strategies primarily focus on preventing infection by controlling the vectors (insects that transmit the viruses), using resistant varieties, and implementing sound cultural practices.

Let's address the specific conditions mentioned:

*   **Tristeza:** This is not known to affect Sorghum (Jowar). Citrus Tristeza Virus (CTV) is specific to citrus crops.

For **Leaf curl, Mosaic, Yellow vein clearing, Stripe, and Stunt virus**, these are symptoms or diseases often caused by viruses such as Sorghum Mosaic Virus (SrMV), Maize Dwarf Mosaic Virus (MDMV), Maize Chlorotic Dwarf Virus (MCDV), or other similar viruses. These are primarily transmitted by insect vectors like aphids and leafhoppers.

Here are the recommended integrated management strategies:

**I. Cultural Practices (Foundation of Management):**

1.  **Resistant/Tolerant Varieties:** The most effective and sustainable method is to cultivate sorghum varieties known to be resistant or tolerant to common viral diseases prevalent in Haryana. Consult with HAU or local agricultural extension for recommended varieties.
2.  **Timely Sowing:** Sow sorghum at the recommended time for your region. Early or late sowing can expose plants to higher vector populations or more susceptible growth stages.
3.  **Weed Management:** Control weeds in and around sorghum fields. Many weeds can act as alternate hosts for viruses and their insect vectors, serving as reservoirs for infection.
4.  **Rogueing:** Regularly inspect fields and promptly remove and destroy (bury or burn) any plants showing symptoms of viral infection. This reduces the source of inoculum for further spread.
5.  **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops to break the disease cycle.
6.  **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy crop residues after harvest to eliminate potential overwintering sites for vectors and viruses.
7.  **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure balanced fertilizer application. Over-fertilization with nitrogen can sometimes lead to lush growth that attracts sucking pests.

**II. Chemical Control (Vector Management):**

Since viruses are transmitted by insect vectors, controlling these vectors is crucial to prevent the spread of the disease.

**A. Seed Treatment (for early protection against sucking pests):**

Treating seeds with systemic insecticides provides early protection to seedlings from sucking pests like aphids and leafhoppers, thereby reducing early viral transmission.

*   **Imidacloprid** 70 WS @ 5-7 g/kg seed
*   **Thiamethoxam** 70 WS @ 5-7 g/kg seed

**B. Foliar Sprays (when vector populations are high):**

Monitor fields regularly for the presence of aphids and leafhoppers. If vector populations are building up, especially during early growth stages, foliar application of systemic insecticides can help.

*   **Imidacloprid** 17.8 SL @ 125 ml/acre (diluted in 200-300 L of water)
*   **Thiamethoxam** 25 WG @ 50 g/acre (diluted in 200-300 L of water)
*   **Acetamiprid** 20 SP @ 80-100 g/acre (diluted in 200-300 L of water)
*   **Dimethoate** 30 EC @ 330 ml/acre (diluted in 200-300 L of water)

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Spray Timing:** Apply insecticides when vector populations are observed, especially during the early stages of crop growth when plants are most vulnerable to viral infection and yield loss.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of insecticide resistance in vector populations.
*   **Safety:** Always follow the instructions on the pesticide label regarding dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI). Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application.

By implementing these integrated strategies, farmers can significantly reduce the incidence and severity of viral diseases in Sorghum (Jowar) fields. For specific recommendations tailored to your local conditions, please consult with the agricultural extension services of HAU.
