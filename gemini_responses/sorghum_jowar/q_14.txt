As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm that both termites and root-knot nematodes are significant soil pests that can affect Sorghum (Jowar) cultivation in Haryana. Effective management strategies involve a combination of cultural practices and judicious use of CIBRC-approved chemical interventions.

Here's how to control these soil pests in Sorghum:

### **I. Control of Termites**

Termites (e.g., *Odontotermes obesus*, *Microtermes obesi*) can cause significant damage by feeding on roots and stems, leading to wilting and plant death, especially in dry conditions.

**A. Cultural and Agronomic Practices:**

*   **Deep Ploughing:** Plough the field deeply during summer to expose termite colonies to sunlight and predators.
*   **Removal of Residues:** Clear the field of crop residues, stubble, and woody debris, which can serve as food sources and nesting sites for termites.
*   **Well-decomposed FYM:** Use only well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost, as undecomposed organic matter can attract termites.
*   **Timely Irrigation:** Ensure adequate moisture, especially during critical growth stages, as termites thrive in dry conditions.

**B. Chemical Control (Soil Application):**

For severe infestations, chemical treatment is often necessary. Apply chemicals as a pre-sowing treatment or at the time of sowing.

*   **Chlorpyrifos:**
    *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC:** Apply 2.5 litres per acre. Mix with 50-100 litres of water and drench the soil, or mix with 50 kg of sand and broadcast evenly over the field before the last ploughing and sowing.
*   **Fipronil:**
    *   **Fipronil 0.3% GR:** Apply 6-8 kg per acre at the time of sowing by broadcasting evenly and incorporating into the soil, or apply in furrows.

### **II. Control of Nematodes (Root-knot Nematodes)**

Root-knot nematodes (*Meloidogyne* species) are microscopic roundworms that infect plant roots, causing galls or knots. This impairs water and nutrient uptake, leading to stunted growth, yellowing, and reduced yield.

**A. Cultural and Agronomic Practices:**

*   **Crop Rotation:** Implement a crop rotation system with non-host crops (e.g., certain cereals not susceptible to the specific *Meloidogyne* species, marigold, mustard) for at least 2-3 years to reduce nematode populations in the soil.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available and suitable for Haryana conditions, use Sorghum varieties known to be resistant or tolerant to root-knot nematodes.
*   **Solarization:** In small plots or nurseries, soil solarization (covering moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets during hot summer months) can effectively reduce nematode populations.
*   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporate organic matter like neem cake (200-400 kg/acre) or well-decomposed FYM into the soil. These amendments improve soil health and can promote natural enemies of nematodes.
*   **Timely Sowing:** Sowing at the recommended time can help plants establish better before nematode populations build up.

**B. Chemical Control (Soil Application):**

For fields with a history of severe nematode problems, chemical nematicides can be applied at sowing.

*   **Carbofuran:**
    *   **Carbofuran 3% G:** Apply 10-15 kg per acre at the time of sowing. Apply in furrows and cover with soil, or broadcast evenly and incorporate into the soil.
*   **Phorate:**
    *   **Phorate 10% G:** Apply 4-5 kg per acre at the time of sowing. Apply in furrows and cover with soil, or broadcast evenly and incorporate into the soil.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Integrated Pest Management (IPM):** Always integrate these chemical methods with cultural practices for sustainable and effective pest management.
*   **Safety Precautions:** Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the pesticide label regarding dosage, application method, safety precautions, and waiting periods. Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application.
*   **Soil Testing:** For nematodes, a soil test can help determine the species and population density, guiding the choice of control measures.
*   **Consult Local Experts:** For specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions, always consult with agricultural extension officers or scientists at HAU.
