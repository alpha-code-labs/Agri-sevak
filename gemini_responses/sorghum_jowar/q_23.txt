As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified seed and soil treatment processes for Sorghum (Jowar) cultivation in Haryana:

### Seed Treatment for Sorghum (Jowar)

Seed treatment is crucial for protecting young sorghum seedlings from early-season insect pests and soil-borne or seed-borne fungal diseases, ensuring better germination and stand establishment.

**For Fungal Diseases (Smuts, Downy Mildew, Seedling Blights):**

*   **General Fungal Protection:**
    *   Treat seeds with **Thiram** @ 2-3 g/kg seed.
    *   Alternatively, use **Carboxin** @ 2 g/kg seed.
    *   For broader spectrum, **Carbendazim** @ 1-2 g/kg seed can be used.
*   **For Downy Mildew (especially in endemic areas):**
    *   Treat seeds with **Metalaxyl** @ 6 g/kg seed. This can be combined with other fungicides for broader protection.
*   **For Smuts and Seedling Blights:**
    *   **Tebuconazole** @ 1-1.5 g/kg seed.

**For Insect Pests (Shoot Fly, Aphids):**

*   **For Shoot Fly and early season sucking pests:**
    *   Treat seeds with **Imidacloprid** @ 3-5 ml/kg seed (for liquid formulations) or 3-5 g/kg seed (for powder formulations).
    *   Alternatively, use **Thiamethoxam** @ 3-5 g/kg seed.

**Recommended Combination:**
For comprehensive protection, it is often advisable to combine a fungicide with an insecticide. For example:
*   **Metalaxyl** @ 6 g/kg seed + **Imidacloprid** @ 3-5 ml/kg seed.
*   **Thiram** @ 2-3 g/kg seed + **Imidacloprid** @ 3-5 ml/kg seed.

### Soil Treatment for Sorghum (Jowar)

Soil treatment primarily focuses on managing soil-borne pests like termites and white grubs, and pre-emergence weed control.

**For Soil-borne Insect Pests (Termites, White Grubs):**

*   **If termites or white grubs are a known problem in the field:**
    *   Apply **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC @ 2-2.5 L/acre mixed with irrigation water or as a drench before sowing or at the time of first irrigation.
    *   Alternatively, incorporate **Fipronil** 0.3% GR @ 6-8 kg/acre into the soil at the time of sowing.

**For Weed Management (Pre-emergence Herbicides):**

*   **For broadleaf and some grass weeds:**
    *   Apply **Atrazine** 50% WP @ 0.5-1 kg/acre as a pre-emergence spray within 3 days of sowing. The exact dose depends on soil type (lower dose for light soils, higher for heavy soils) and weed pressure. Ensure adequate soil moisture for efficacy.
*   **For grasses and some broadleaf weeds:**
    *   Apply **Pendimethalin** 30% EC @ 1-1.3 L/acre as a pre-emergence spray within 3 days of sowing.

Always ensure proper application techniques, follow label instructions, and wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) when handling any agricultural chemicals.
