As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an integrated approach for weed management in Sorghum (Jowar), combining cultural practices with judicious use of scientifically verified chemical control methods.

**General Weed Management Principles for Sorghum (Jowar):**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Timely Sowing:** Sowing at the recommended time helps the crop establish quickly and compete better with weeds.
    *   **Proper Seedbed Preparation:** A well-prepared, fine seedbed reduces initial weed pressure.
    *   **Inter-cultivation/Hoeing:** One or two inter-cultivations at 15-20 and 30-35 days after sowing (DAS) can effectively control early-emerging weeds.
    *   **Hand Weeding:** One hand weeding at 20-25 DAS is highly effective, especially for weeds that escape herbicide application.

2.  **Chemical Control (Herbicides):**
    *   **Pre-emergence Herbicides (Apply within 0-3 days after sowing, before weed emergence):**
        *   For broadleaf and some narrowleaf weeds:
            *   **Atrazine** 50% WP at 1.0-2.0 kg product per acre (0.5-1.0 kg active ingredient per acre) in 200-300 L of water.
            *   **Pendimethalin** 30% EC at 3.3 L product per acre (1.0 kg active ingredient per acre) in 200-300 L of water. This also offers some suppression of Cuscuta.

    *   **Post-emergence Herbicides (Apply 15-25 days after sowing, when weeds are at 2-4 leaf stage and crop is at 2-5 leaf stage):**
        *   For broadleaf weeds (including Bathu, Congress grass):
            *   **2,4-D ethyl ester** 38% EC at 1.3 L product per acre (0.5 kg active ingredient per acre) in 200-300 L of water. Apply carefully to avoid drift to sensitive crops.
            *   **Topramezone** 33.6% SC at 75 ml product per acre (25.2 g active ingredient per acre) along with a suitable surfactant, in 200-300 L of water. This is effective on both broadleaf and some grassy weeds.
        *   For grassy weeds and some broadleaf weeds:
            *   **Nicosulfuron** 75% WG at 20 g product per acre (15 g active ingredient per acre) along with a suitable surfactant, in 200-300 L of water. Apply when Sorghum is at the 2-5 leaf stage.

**Specific Weed Control Recommendations:**

*   **Broadleaf Weeds (e.g., Bathu, Congress grass) and Narrowleaf Weeds:**
    *   These general categories are effectively controlled by the pre-emergence and post-emergence herbicides mentioned above.
    *   For **Bathu (Chenopodium album)** and **Congress grass (Parthenium hysterophorus)** specifically:
        *   Pre-emergence: **Atrazine** or **Pendimethalin**.
        *   Post-emergence: **2,4-D ethyl ester** or **Topramezone**.

*   **Amarbail (Cuscuta):**
    *   Prevention is crucial. Use certified, clean seeds free from Cuscuta contamination.
    *   Pre-emergence application of **Pendimethalin** 30% EC at 3.3 L product per acre can provide some initial suppression.
    *   Once established, hand removal of affected plants before they set seed is the most effective method. There are no selective post-emergence herbicides available for Cuscuta in Sorghum that will not harm the crop.

*   **Orobanche (Broomrape):**
    *   This is not known to affect Sorghum (Jowar). Orobanche species are parasitic on dicotyledonous plants, whereas Sorghum is a monocot.

*   **Phalaris minor:**
    *   This is not known to be a primary weed of Sorghum (Jowar). *Phalaris minor* is predominantly a weed of Rabi crops (e.g., wheat) and germinates under cooler temperatures, which do not coincide with the main Kharif growing season of Sorghum.
