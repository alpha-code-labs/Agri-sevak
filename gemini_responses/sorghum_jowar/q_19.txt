Dear Farmer,

Addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies is crucial for achieving optimal yields in Sorghum (Jowar). Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium are essential for healthy plant growth and development. The most accurate way to determine the specific nutrient requirements for your field is through a comprehensive soil test. However, based on general recommendations for Haryana, here's how to address these deficiencies:

### General Recommendations:

*   **Soil Testing:** Always conduct a soil test before sowing to determine the exact nutrient status of your field. This allows for precise fertilizer application, preventing both deficiencies and over-application.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management (INM):** Combine chemical fertilizers with organic manures (Farm Yard Manure, compost, vermicompost) and bio-fertilizers for sustainable soil health and nutrient availability.

### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

Nitrogen is vital for vegetative growth, chlorophyll formation, and protein synthesis.

*   **Symptoms:**
    *   General yellowing (chlorosis) of older leaves, starting from the tip and progressing along the midrib.
    *   Stunted plant growth and thin stalks.
    *   Reduced tillering and overall vigor.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Fertilizer:**
        *   **Urea** (46% N)
    *   **Application:**
        *   For rainfed Sorghum, a general recommendation is 40-60 kg N per acre.
        *   For irrigated Sorghum, 60-80 kg N per acre is often recommended.
        *   Apply Nitrogen in split doses to minimize losses and ensure continuous availability:
            *   **Basal Application:** 1/2 of the total N at the time of sowing.
            *   **First Top Dressing:** 1/4 of the total N at 30-40 days after sowing (DAS).
            *   **Second Top Dressing:** Remaining 1/4 of the total N at 50-60 DAS, especially for longer duration varieties or if growth is slow.
        *   Ensure adequate moisture in the soil during top-dressing for efficient nutrient uptake.

### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

Phosphorus plays a critical role in root development, energy transfer, flowering, and seed formation.

*   **Symptoms:**
    *   Stunted plant growth, particularly root development.
    *   Leaves may appear dark green, often developing a purplish discoloration, especially on older leaves and leaf margins.
    *   Delayed maturity and poor grain filling.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Fertilizers:**
        *   **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5)
        *   **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5)
    *   **Application:**
        *   A general recommendation is 20-30 kg P2O5 per acre.
        *   Phosphorus is relatively immobile in the soil, so it should be applied as a **basal dose** at the time of sowing.
        *   Drill the entire quantity of Phosphorus fertilizer 5-7 cm below the seed to ensure it is accessible to the developing root system.

### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency

Potassium is essential for water regulation, enzyme activation, disease resistance, and stalk strength.

*   **Symptoms:**
    *   Yellowing and scorching or browning of leaf margins, particularly on older leaves, starting from the tip.
    *   Weak stalks, leading to lodging (falling over) of plants.
    *   Poor grain filling and reduced seed size.
    *   Increased susceptibility to diseases.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Fertilizer:**
        *   **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** (60% K2O)
    *   **Application:**
        *   A general recommendation is 15-20 kg K2O per acre.
        *   Apply the entire quantity of Potassium fertilizer as a **basal dose** at the time of sowing.
        *   In sandy soils or under irrigated conditions, a split application (half basal, half at 30-40 DAS) can be considered to minimize leaching losses.

Always consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your soil type and farming practices.
