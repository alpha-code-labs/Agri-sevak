As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice to improve yield, grain quality, and storage life for Sorghum (Jowar) in Haryana.

It's important to clarify that Sorghum produces grains, not fruits. Therefore, "fruit quality" and "storage life" will be addressed as "grain quality" and "grain storage life."

### Improving Sorghum (Jowar) Yield

1.  **Variety Selection:**
    *   Choose high-yielding, disease-resistant, and drought-tolerant hybrid varieties recommended for Haryana conditions by HAU. Consult your local Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) for the latest recommendations.
2.  **Land Preparation:**
    *   Ensure a fine, firm, and well-pulverized seedbed for good germination and root development.
3.  **Sowing Time and Method:**
    *   **Kharif:** Mid-June to mid-July is optimal.
    *   **Rabi:** Mid-September to mid-October.
    *   Maintain proper spacing: 45-60 cm row-to-row and 10-15 cm plant-to-plant.
    *   Seed depth should be 2.5-3.0 cm.
4.  **Nutrient Management (Based on Soil Test):**
    *   **Nitrogen (N):** Apply 80-100 kg N per acre. Apply 1/3rd at sowing, 1/3rd at 30-35 days after sowing (DAS), and the remaining 1/3rd at 50-55 DAS.
    *   **Phosphorus (P):** Apply 40-60 kg P2O5 per acre as a basal dose at sowing.
    *   **Potassium (K):** Apply 20-30 kg K2O per acre as a basal dose, especially on light soils or if soil test indicates deficiency.
    *   **Zinc (Zn):** If soil test indicates deficiency, apply **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** at 10 kg/acre as a basal dose or foliar spray of 0.5% solution (5 g/L water) at 30 and 45 DAS.
    *   **Sulphur (S):** Apply 20 kg S per acre if soil test indicates deficiency.
5.  **Water Management:**
    *   Sorghum is relatively drought-tolerant, but critical stages for irrigation are:
        *   Knee-high stage (25-30 DAS)
        *   Booting stage (45-50 DAS)
        *   Flowering stage (60-70 DAS)
        *   Grain filling stage (80-90 DAS)
    *   Provide light and timely irrigations based on rainfall and soil moisture status. Avoid waterlogging.
6.  **Weed Management:**
    *   Weeds compete heavily with sorghum, especially during the first 30-45 DAS.
    *   **Pre-emergence:** Apply **Atrazine** at 0.5-1.0 kg active ingredient per acre immediately after sowing or within 3 days, followed by light irrigation.
    *   **Post-emergence:** If needed, apply **2,4-D ethyl ester** at 0.5 kg active ingredient per acre at 20-25 DAS for broadleaf weeds.
    *   Manual weeding can be done at 20-25 DAS and 40-45 DAS.
7.  **Pest Management:**
    *   **Sorghum Shoot Fly:**
        *   Use resistant varieties.
        *   Seed treatment with **Thiamethoxam** 70 WS at 3 g/kg seed.
        *   If infestation occurs, spray **Dimethoate** 30 EC at 1.0 ml/L water or **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5 EC at 0.5 ml/L water at 7-10 DAS.
    *   **Stem Borer:**
        *   Remove and destroy affected plants.
        *   Apply **Carbofuran** 3G granules at 3-4 kg/acre in leaf whorls at 20-25 DAS.
        *   Spray **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5 SC at 0.3 ml/L water.
    *   **Sorghum Midge:**
        *   Sow early and uniformly.
        *   Spray **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5 EC at 0.5 ml/L water at earhead emergence.
8.  **Disease Management:**
    *   **Downy Mildew:**
        *   Use resistant varieties.
        *   Seed treatment with **Metalaxyl** 35 WS at 6 g/kg seed.
        *   Remove and destroy infected plants.
    *   **Anthracnose:**
        *   Use resistant varieties.
        *   Seed treatment with **Carbendazim** 50 WP at 2 g/kg seed.
        *   Foliar spray of **Propiconazole** 25 EC at 1.0 ml/L water or **Azoxystrobin** 23 SC at 1.0 ml/L water at disease appearance.
    *   **Rust:**
        *   Spray **Propiconazole** 25 EC at 1.0 ml/L water at disease appearance.
9.  **Harvesting:**
    *   Harvest when grains are hard and moisture content is around 20-25%. Timely harvest prevents lodging and shattering losses.

### Improving Sorghum (Jowar) Grain Quality

1.  **Variety Selection:**
    *   Choose varieties known for good grain quality traits like desired color, size, protein content, and processing characteristics.
2.  **Balanced Nutrition:**
    *   Adequate and balanced application of N, P, K, and micronutrients (especially Zinc and Sulphur) is crucial for good grain development and nutritional quality. Nitrogen contributes to protein content.
3.  **Pest and Disease Control:**
    *   Effective management of pests and diseases prevents damage to grains, which can lead to discoloration, shriveling, and reduced nutritional value.
4.  **Timely Harvest:**
    *   Harvesting at physiological maturity ensures maximum grain filling and prevents quality deterioration due to adverse weather conditions or pest attacks in the field.
5.  **Proper Threshing and Cleaning:**
    *   Threshing should be done carefully to minimize physical damage to grains.
    *   Clean the grains thoroughly to remove chaff, dust, stones, and other foreign matter, which improves market value and storage potential.

### Improving Sorghum (Jowar) Grain Storage Life

1.  **Drying to Safe Moisture Content:**
    *   This is the most critical step. Dry grains immediately after harvest to a safe moisture level of 10-12% for long-term storage. Higher moisture content promotes mold growth and insect infestation.
2.  **Cleaning and Grading:**
    *   Remove all foreign matter (chaff, dust, stones, weed seeds, damaged grains) before storage. Clean grains store better.
3.  **Storage Structure Preparation:**
    *   **Cleanliness:** Thoroughly clean the storage bins/godowns before storing new grain. Remove old grain residues, dust, and spider webs.
    *   **Repair:** Seal all cracks and crevices to prevent entry of insects and rodents.
    *   **Sanitation:** Spray the empty storage structure with an approved insecticide like **Malathion** 50 EC at 10 ml/L water (for surface treatment) at least 7-10 days before storing grain.
    *   **Rodent Proofing:** Ensure the storage structure is rodent-proof.
4.  **Aeration:**
    *   If storing in large bins, provide adequate aeration to maintain uniform temperature and moisture, preventing hot spots and condensation.
5.  **Pest Management in Storage:**
    *   **Fumigation:** For large-scale or long-term storage, fumigation with **Aluminium phosphide** tablets (as per label instructions and under expert supervision) can be done to control stored grain pests.
    *   **Insecticides:** For small-scale storage, mix **Malathion** 5% dust at 250 g per 100 kg of grain, ensuring uniform mixing.
    *   **Regular Inspection:** Periodically inspect stored grain for signs of insect infestation, mold growth, or moisture accumulation.
6.  **Bag Storage:**
    *   If storing in bags, stack them on wooden pallets away from walls to allow air circulation and prevent moisture absorption from the floor/walls.
    *   Cover stacks with tarpaulins to protect from moisture and pests.

By implementing these practices, you can significantly improve the yield, grain quality, and storage life of your Sorghum (Jowar) crop. Always consult your local KVK or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions.
