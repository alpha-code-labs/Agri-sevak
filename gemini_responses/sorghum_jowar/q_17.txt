As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following doses of organic manures and biostimulants for Sorghum (Jowar) cultivation in Haryana, based on scientific verification:

*   **Farmyard Manure (FYM):**
    *   Apply **8-12 tonnes per acre**.
    *   Ensure the FYM is well-decomposed (at least 3-4 months old) to prevent nutrient immobilization and weed proliferation.
    *   It should be uniformly spread and thoroughly incorporated into the soil 2-3 weeks before sowing.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   Apply **2-3 tonnes per acre**.
    *   Vermicompost is richer in nutrients and beneficial microorganisms compared to FYM. It significantly improves soil structure, water holding capacity, and nutrient availability.
    *   It can be applied during field preparation or as a top dressing.

*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract based biostimulant):**
    *   While not a bulk organic manure, Sagarika is an organic biostimulant that enhances plant growth, nutrient uptake, and stress tolerance.
    *   **Foliar Spray:**
        *   Apply **2.5 - 5 ml per litre of water**.
        *   Typically, this translates to **500 ml - 1 litre per acre**, depending on the spray volume used.
        *   **Application Timing:**
            *   First spray: 25-30 days after sowing.
            *   Second spray: At the pre-flowering stage.
        *   Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage during spraying.

It is always advisable to conduct a soil test to determine specific nutrient deficiencies and tailor the nutrient management plan accordingly for optimal yields and soil health. An integrated approach combining organic manures with balanced chemical fertilizers (if required) is recommended for sustainable agriculture.
