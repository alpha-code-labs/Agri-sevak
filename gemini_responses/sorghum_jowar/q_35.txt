As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding Sorghum (Jowar) maturity, harvesting time, and cutting process for Haryana conditions:

### Maturity Signs for Sorghum (Jowar)

Identifying the correct maturity signs is crucial for maximizing yield and grain quality. Look for the following indicators:

*   **Physiological Maturity (Black Layer Formation):** This is the most reliable indicator. A small, distinct black spot or layer forms at the base of the grain where it attaches to the pedicel (the stalk connecting the grain to the head). This signifies that the flow of nutrients and moisture to the grain has ceased.
*   **Grain Hardness:** The grains become hard and firm. They should be difficult to dent with a thumbnail.
*   **Moisture Content:** At physiological maturity, the grain moisture content typically ranges from **25-30%**.
*   **Plant Senescence:** The leaves and stalks of the plant begin to dry down and turn yellow or brown, starting from the bottom of the plant and progressing upwards.
*   **Head Colour Change:** The glumes (chaff) surrounding the grains change from green to a lighter straw colour, or sometimes to reddish/purplish hues, depending on the specific variety.

### Harvesting Time for Sorghum (Jowar)

The optimal harvesting time depends on the intended use and harvesting method.

*   **For Grain Harvest:**
    *   Harvesting should ideally commence when the grain moisture content is between **18-20%**. This range is optimal for mechanical harvesting (combine) to minimize grain losses and damage.
    *   For manual harvesting, it can be done slightly earlier, but ensuring the grain has reached physiological maturity (black layer formed) is paramount.
    *   For safe long-term storage, the harvested grain must be dried to **below 14% moisture content** to prevent fungal growth, insect infestation, and spoilage.
    *   The typical duration from planting to grain harvest for most sorghum varieties in Haryana ranges from **90 to 120 days**, depending on the specific hybrid/variety and prevailing weather conditions.

### Cutting Process for Sorghum (Jowar)

The cutting process varies based on the scale of cultivation and available resources.

*   **Manual Harvesting:**
    *   Farmers commonly use a **sickle** to cut the entire plant at the base (ground level) or just below the panicle (head).
    *   If the entire plant is cut, it is often stacked in the field for a few days to allow for further drying of the stalks and grains before threshing.
    *   If only the heads are cut, they are collected and then transported for threshing.
*   **Mechanical Harvesting (Combine Harvester):**
    *   For large-scale sorghum cultivation, **combine harvesters** are efficiently employed.
    *   The combine cuts the sorghum heads, threshes the grain, and separates it from the stalks and chaff in a single operation.
    *   Proper adjustment of combine settings, such as cylinder speed, concave clearance, and fan speed, is critical to minimize grain damage and harvesting losses.
    *   The stubble height can be adjusted according to subsequent field management practices.
