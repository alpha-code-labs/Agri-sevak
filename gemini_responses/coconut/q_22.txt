As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), providing scientifically verified advice for Haryana, India, it is important to note that Coconut (Cocos nucifera) is a tropical crop.

The climatic conditions in Haryana, characterized by a subtropical, semi-arid to arid environment with extreme temperatures and distinct dry and wet seasons, are not suitable for the successful cultivation of Coconut. Coconut palms require a hot, humid climate with well-distributed rainfall (or irrigation), high humidity, and sandy-loamy soils, typically found in coastal regions of India.

Therefore, Haryana Agricultural University does not recommend or provide specific cultivation practices for Coconut within Haryana, as it is not a viable crop for the region.
