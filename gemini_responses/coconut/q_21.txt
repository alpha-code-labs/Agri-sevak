As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), my expertise and recommendations are specifically focused on the agricultural conditions and crops cultivated in Haryana.

Coconut (Cocos nucifera) is a tropical crop and is not grown commercially in Haryana due to unsuitable climatic conditions. Consequently, Haryana Agricultural University does not conduct research or provide specific management recommendations for nutrient toxicities or any other issues pertaining to Coconut cultivation.
