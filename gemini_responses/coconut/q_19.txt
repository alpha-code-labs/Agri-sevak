As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide scientifically verified advice on addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies in Coconut. While Coconut is not a primary crop in Haryana, the principles of nutrient management are universal.

Addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium) in Coconut requires a systematic approach, ideally starting with soil and leaf analysis to accurately diagnose the specific deficiency and its severity.

**General Recommendations for Macro-nutrient Application in Coconut:**

*   **Soil and Leaf Analysis:** This is crucial for precise diagnosis and tailored recommendations. Visual symptoms can be misleading.
*   **Application Method:** Fertilizers are typically applied in a basin around the palm, 1.5-2 meters from the base, incorporated into the soil, and followed by irrigation.
*   **Split Applications:** For better nutrient utilization and to minimize leaching losses, it is recommended to split the annual dose into 2-3 applications, especially during the monsoon and post-monsoon periods.
*   **Organic Matter:** Regular application of farmyard manure (FYM) or compost (25-50 kg/palm/year) significantly improves soil health, nutrient retention, and microbial activity, enhancing fertilizer efficiency.

### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   General yellowing of older leaves (chlorosis).
*   Stunted growth and reduced leaf size.
*   Poor crown development and reduced nut yield.

**Correction:**
For mature bearing palms, an annual application of 500-1000 g of Nitrogen per palm is generally recommended, split into 2-3 applications.

*   **Urea** (46% N): Apply 1.1 - 2.2 kg per palm per year.
*   **Ammonium Sulphate** (20.6% N): Apply 2.4 - 4.8 kg per palm per year.
*   **Calcium Ammonium Nitrate (CAN)** (25% N): Apply 2.0 - 4.0 kg per palm per year.

### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   Stunted growth, particularly of roots.
*   Dark green or purplish discoloration of older leaves.
*   Reduced nut size and poor kernel development.

**Correction:**
For mature bearing palms, an annual application of 250-500 g of P2O5 per palm is generally recommended, split into 2 applications.

*   **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5): Apply 1.5 - 3.1 kg per palm per year.
*   **Di-Ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (46% P2O5, 18% N): Apply 0.5 - 1.1 kg per palm per year. (Note: If using DAP, adjust N application accordingly).
*   **Rock Phosphate** (variable P2O5, slow release): Can be used as a long-term source, especially in acidic soils. Dosage depends on P2O5 content.

### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency (Potash)

**Symptoms:**
*   Yellowing and scorching (necrosis) of leaf tips and margins, particularly on older leaves.
*   Premature nut drop and reduced nut size.
*   Poor copra quality and reduced oil content.
*   Increased susceptibility to pests and diseases.

**Correction:**
Potassium is often the most critical nutrient for Coconut. For mature bearing palms, an annual application of 500-1000 g of K2O per palm is generally recommended, split into 2-3 applications. In severe cases or high-yielding palms, this can be increased.

*   **Muriate of Potash (Potassium Chloride)** (60% K2O): Apply 0.8 - 1.7 kg per palm per year.
*   **Sulphate of Potash (Potassium Sulphate)** (50% K2O): Apply 1.0 - 2.0 kg per palm per year. (Preferred in chloride-sensitive areas, though coconut tolerates chloride well).

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Irrigation:** Adequate soil moisture is essential for nutrient uptake. Ensure proper irrigation, especially after fertilizer application.
*   **Timing:** Apply fertilizers when the soil is moist and during periods of active growth.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management:** Combine chemical fertilizers with organic manures and bio-fertilizers for sustainable soil health and nutrient availability.

Always consult with local agricultural extension services for specific recommendations tailored to your soil type, climate, and coconut variety.
