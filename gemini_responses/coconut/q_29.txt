As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide scientifically verified advice for controlling flower and fruit drop in Coconut. Please note that "Tinda/Boll dropping" is not a condition associated with Coconut palms. Therefore, the advice below focuses on the control of flower and fruit drop (often referred to as button shedding) in Coconut.

Flower and fruit drop in coconut can be attributed to various factors, including physiological stress, nutrient deficiencies, pest infestations, and diseases. Effective control involves an integrated approach.

**I. Cultural and Agronomic Practices:**

1.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Ensure balanced fertilization based on soil test recommendations. For adult palms, a general recommendation (to be adjusted based on soil analysis) is:
        *   Urea: 1.3 kg/palm/year (600 g N)
        *   Single Super Phosphate (SSP): 2.0 kg/palm/year (320 g P2O5)
        *   Muriate of Potash (MOP): 2.0 kg/palm/year (1200 g K2O)
    *   Apply these fertilizers in two equal split doses during May-June and September-October.
    *   **Micronutrients:** If deficiencies are identified, especially Boron, apply **Borax** at 50-100 g/palm/year. Magnesium deficiency can be corrected with **Magnesium Sulphate** at 500 g/palm/year.
2.  **Water Management:**
    *   Provide adequate irrigation, especially during dry spells and critical stages like flowering and fruit development.
    *   Avoid waterlogging, which can also stress the palm.
    *   Mulching around the base of the palm with organic materials helps conserve soil moisture and regulate soil temperature.
3.  **Pollination:**
    *   Ensure good pollination. In some varieties or conditions, poor pollination can lead to button shedding. Encourage natural pollinators.
4.  **Weed Control:** Keep the palm basin free of weeds to reduce competition for water and nutrients.
5.  **Basin Management:** Maintain a proper basin around the palm for efficient water and nutrient absorption.

**II. Hormonal Applications (Plant Growth Regulators):**

*   To reduce button shedding, a foliar spray of **Naphthalene Acetic Acid** (NAA) can be effective.
    *   Spray **Naphthalene Acetic Acid** 20 ppm (20 mg/L) on the bunches during the button shedding stage.

**III. Pest Management (if identified as a cause for dropping):**

*   **Coconut Eriophyid Mite (*Aceria guerreronis*):** Mite infestation on tender buttons can cause malformation and shedding.
    *   Spray the crown and bunches with **Spiromesifen** 22.9% SC @ 0.4 ml/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, spray **Propargite** 57% EC @ 1.5 ml/L of water.
    *   For organic control, spray **Azadirachtin** 1500 ppm @ 5 ml/L of water.
*   **Mealybugs/Thrips:** Severe infestations can lead to flower and fruit drop.
    *   Spray **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL @ 0.3 ml/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, spray **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG @ 0.2 g/L of water.

**IV. Disease Management (if identified as a cause for dropping):**

*   **Bud Rot (*Phytophthora palmivora*):** While primarily affecting the bud, severe infection can indirectly lead to shedding.
    *   Remove all infected tissues.
    *   Apply a prophylactic spray of **Copper Oxychloride** 50% WP @ 3 g/L of water or **Mancozeb** 75% WP @ 2.5 g/L of water on the crown, especially during monsoon.

Always consult with local agricultural extension services for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and to confirm the latest CIBRC approved formulations and dosages.
