Scale insects and Mealybugs are significant pests of Coconut. Effective control requires an integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods.

Here's how to control them:

**I. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Approach:**
An IPM strategy is crucial for sustainable and effective management, minimizing reliance on chemical pesticides.

**II. Non-Chemical Control Methods:**

1.  **Manual Removal:** For small infestations, physically remove scale insects and mealybugs using a strong jet of water or by hand with a brush. Prune and destroy heavily infested fronds.
2.  **Biological Control:** Encourage natural enemies such as parasitic wasps (e.g., *Anagyrus lopezi* for mealybugs, various encyrtids for scales) and predatory beetles (e.g., ladybird beetles like *Cryptolaemus montrouzieri*). These can be released in affected areas.
3.  **Horticultural Mineral Oil (HMO):** Spraying with **Horticultural Mineral Oil** (10-20 ml/L of water) can smother the pests, especially at early stages. Repeat applications may be necessary.
4.  **Neem-based Formulations:** Products containing **Azadirachtin** (Neem oil) at 1-2% concentration can act as an antifeedant and growth disruptor, particularly effective against nymphs.

**III. Chemical Control Methods (CIBRC Approved):**

For severe infestations, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always follow label instructions carefully and ensure proper safety measures.

**A. Foliar Spray (for accessible fronds, especially young palms):**

*   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: Apply at 0.3 - 0.5 ml per litre of water.
*   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: Apply at 0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water.
*   **Buprofezin** 25% SC: Apply at 1.25 ml per litre of water (effective against nymphs by inhibiting chitin synthesis).
*   **Dimethoate** 30% EC: Apply at 2 ml per litre of water.
*   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: Apply at 2.5 ml per litre of water.

**B. Systemic Application (for mature palms, highly effective for hidden pests):**

1.  **Trunk Injection:** This method delivers the insecticide directly into the vascular system of the tree, providing systemic control.
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: Inject 2-5 ml per tree (diluted in an equal volume of water) into a pre-drilled hole in the trunk. Seal the hole after injection.
    *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: Inject 5-10 ml per tree (diluted in an equal volume of water) into a pre-drilled hole in the trunk. Seal the hole after injection.
    *   *Note:* Trunk injection should be done carefully to avoid tree injury and only when necessary.

2.  **Root Feeding:** For systemic action, especially in younger palms or where trunk injection is not feasible.
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: Expose a healthy, actively growing root. Cut the tip and immerse it in a solution of 2-5 ml of **Imidacloprid** diluted in 50-100 ml of water. Cover the root and solution to prevent evaporation.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Timing:** Apply insecticides when pests are in their most vulnerable stages (e.g., nymphs).
*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and in leaf axils where pests tend to congregate.
*   **Rotation:** Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals. Follow all safety guidelines on the product label.
*   **Environmental Impact:** Consider the impact on beneficial insects and the environment when choosing and applying pesticides. Prioritize non-chemical methods whenever possible.
