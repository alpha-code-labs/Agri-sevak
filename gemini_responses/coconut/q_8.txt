As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling sucking pests in Coconut in Haryana.

**Regarding Aphids, Leafhopper, and Psylla:**
This is not known to affect Coconut.

**Regarding Whitefly and Thrips:**
These pests can affect Coconut. Control measures are detailed below:

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Whitefly and Thrips:**
*   **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect palms, especially the undersides of leaves for whiteflies and flowers/young nuts for thrips.
*   **Biological Control:** Encourage natural enemies such as parasitoids (e.g., *Encarsia guadeloupae* for Rugose Spiralling Whitefly) and predators (e.g., lacewings, ladybugs). Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.
*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   For whiteflies, remove severely infested older leaves and destroy them. A strong jet of water can dislodge nymphs and pupae from the undersurface of leaves.
    *   Maintain palm health through proper nutrition and irrigation to enhance natural resistance.
    *   For thrips, maintain orchard hygiene and remove weeds that might harbor pests.

**Chemical Control (Use only CIBRC approved technical chemicals, metric units):**

**For Whitefly (e.g., Rugose Spiralling Whitefly):**
*   **Foliar Spray (ensure thorough coverage on the undersides of leaves):**
    *   **Buprofezin** 25% SC @ 1.25 ml/L of water.
    *   **Spirotetramat** 150 OD @ 0.75 ml/L of water.
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL @ 0.6 ml/L of water.
    *   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP @ 0.2 g/L of water.
*   **Trunk Injection (for systemic action, especially for tall palms):**
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL @ 10-15 ml per palm (diluted in water, injected into the trunk).
    *   **Dinotefuran** 20% SG @ 10-15 g per palm (diluted in water, injected into the trunk).

**For Thrips:**
*   **Foliar Spray (target flowers and young nuts):**
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL @ 0.6 ml/L of water.
    *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG @ 0.2 g/L of water.
    *   **Fipronil** 5% SC @ 1.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Spinosad** 45% SC @ 0.25 ml/L of water.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label carefully, including safety precautions and pre-harvest intervals (PHI).
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your region and current pest situation.
