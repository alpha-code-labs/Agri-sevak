As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the specified pests in Coconut, adhering to CIBRC approved technical chemical names and metric units.

### Control of Borers in Coconut

Borers like the Red Palm Weevil (*Rhynchophorus ferrugineus*) and Rhinoceros Beetle (*Oryctes rhinoceros*) are significant pests of coconut.

*   **Red Palm Weevil (RPW):**
    *   **Trunk Injection:** For infested palms, inject 10-15 ml of **Chlorpyrifos** 20 EC (diluted in 100 ml of water) per tree into the trunk.
    *   **Crown Drenching:** For severe infestations, drench the crown with **Chlorpyrifos** 20 EC at 2.5 ml/L of water.
*   **Rhinoceros Beetle:**
    *   **Leaf Axil Application:** Apply a mixture of **Carbaryl** 50 WP (25 g) and sand (200 g) in the leaf axils and innermost three leaf axils of the crown.
    *   **Pheromone Traps:** Use pheromone traps for mass trapping of adult beetles.

### Control of Caterpillars in Coconut

The Black-headed caterpillar (*Opisina arenosella*) is a common caterpillar pest of coconut.

*   **Foliar Spray:**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5 SC at 0.3 ml/L of water.
    *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5 SG at 0.2 g/L of water.
    *   **Quinalphos** 25 EC at 2 ml/L of water.

### Diamondback Moth in Coconut

This is not known to affect Coconut. Diamondback moth (*Plutella xylostella*) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops.

### Control of Leaf Folder in Coconut

While less common as a primary pest, leaf folders can occasionally affect coconut.

*   **Foliar Spray:**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5 SC at 0.3 ml/L of water.
    *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5 SG at 0.2 g/L of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5 EC at 0.6 ml/L of water.

**Note:** Always ensure proper safety measures, wear protective gear, and follow the instructions on the product label when handling and applying any chemical pesticides. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approaches, including cultural practices and biological control, should always be prioritized for sustainable pest management.
