As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU), Hisar, my advice is specifically tailored for agricultural practices within Haryana.

Coconut (Cocos nucifera) is a tropical palm that requires specific climatic and soil conditions, primarily found in coastal regions of India. It is not commercially cultivated in Haryana due to its unsuitable climate (extreme temperatures, lack of coastal environment) and soil types.

Therefore, Haryana Agricultural University, Hisar, does not provide specific recommendations for weed control in coconut plantations, as this crop is not part of Haryana's agricultural landscape.
