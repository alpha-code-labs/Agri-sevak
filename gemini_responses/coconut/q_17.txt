As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), it is important to provide advice that is scientifically verified and relevant to the agro-climatic conditions of Haryana.

Coconut (Cocos nucifera) is a tropical palm that thrives in hot, humid climates with well-distributed rainfall, typically found in coastal regions. Haryana's climate, characterized by extreme temperatures (hot summers and cold winters) and a semi-arid to sub-humid continental environment, is generally not suitable for the commercial cultivation of coconut.

Therefore, Haryana Agricultural University does not provide specific recommendations for the cultivation of coconut, including the recommended doses of organic manures like FYM, Vermicompost, or Sagarika, for the Haryana region, as it is not a commercially viable or recommended crop for our state.
