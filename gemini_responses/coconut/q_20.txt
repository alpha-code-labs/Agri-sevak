As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide scientifically verified advice. While coconut is not a primary crop cultivated in Haryana, and our research and advisory services are primarily focused on crops relevant to our state's agro-climatic conditions, I can provide general scientific guidance on addressing micronutrient deficiencies in coconut, based on established agricultural practices.

Here's how to address common micronutrient deficiencies in coconut:

### Micronutrient Deficiencies in Coconut

**1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency**
*   **Symptoms:** Reduced leaf size (little leaf), rosetting of fronds, stunted growth, and sometimes chlorosis.
*   **Correction:**
    *   Foliar spray: Apply 0.5% solution of **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** (5 g/L of water) twice a year.
    *   Soil application: Apply 50-100 g of **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** per palm per year, split into two doses.

**2. Iron (Fe) Deficiency**
*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on young leaves, which may turn almost white in severe cases.
*   **Correction:**
    *   Foliar spray: Apply 0.5% solution of **Ferrous Sulphate Heptahydrate** (5 g/L of water) to the foliage.
    *   Soil application: Apply 50-100 g of **Ferrous Sulphate Heptahydrate** per palm per year. For severe cases, chelated iron like **Fe-EDTA** can be applied at 10-20 g per palm.

**3. Boron (B) Deficiency**
*   **Symptoms:** Crinkling and malformation of leaflets, stunted growth, premature nut fall, barren nuts, and sometimes 'pencil point' or 'little leaf' symptoms in the growing point.
*   **Correction:**
    *   Soil application: Apply 25-50 g of **Borax** (Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate) per palm per year, or 10-20 g of **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** per palm per year.
    *   Foliar spray: Apply 0.1% solution of **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (1 g/L of water).

**4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency**
*   **Symptoms:** Necrosis (death) of young leaves and growing points, stunted growth, poor root development, and sometimes premature nut drop.
*   **Correction:**
    *   Soil application: Apply 1-2 kg of **Gypsum** (Calcium Sulphate) or 200-300 g of **Calcium Nitrate** per palm per year.
    *   Foliar spray: Apply 0.5% solution of **Calcium Chloride** (5 g/L of water).

**5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency**
*   **Symptoms:** Characteristic yellowing of older leaves, starting from the tips and margins and progressing inwards, often forming an inverted 'V' shape.
*   **Correction:**
    *   Soil application: Apply 250-500 g of **Magnesium Sulphate Heptahydrate** (Epsom salt) per palm per year, split into two doses.
    *   Foliar spray: Apply 1-2% solution of **Magnesium Sulphate Heptahydrate** (10-20 g/L of water).

**6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency**
*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, often appearing as streaks, reduced leaf size, and sometimes necrosis of leaf tips.
*   **Correction:**
    *   Foliar spray: Apply 0.5% solution of **Manganese Sulphate Monohydrate** (5 g/L of water).
    *   Soil application: Apply 50-100 g of **Manganese Sulphate Monohydrate** per palm per year.

**General Recommendations:**
*   Always conduct a soil test and leaf analysis to confirm specific deficiencies before applying micronutrients.
*   Ensure proper irrigation and drainage, as water stress can exacerbate nutrient deficiencies.
*   Integrate organic matter into the soil to improve nutrient availability and soil health.
*   For foliar sprays, ensure good coverage of the fronds, especially the younger ones. Apply during cooler parts of the day to avoid scorching.
