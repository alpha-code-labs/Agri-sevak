While coconut (Cocos nucifera) is a tropical crop not typically cultivated in the agro-climatic conditions of Haryana due to its specific requirements for high humidity, consistent warm temperatures, and well-distributed rainfall, I can provide general scientific advice on managing the described physical damages based on established horticultural practices for coconut.

Here are the control measures for physical damage in coconut:

### 1. Fruit Bursting (Splitting of nuts)

*   **Causes:** Primarily due to sudden fluctuations in soil moisture (e.g., heavy rainfall after a dry spell), but can also be exacerbated by nutrient imbalances (especially Boron and Potassium) and genetic factors.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Consistent Irrigation:** Maintain uniform soil moisture, especially during the fruit development stage. Avoid extremes of drought followed by sudden heavy watering.
    *   **Mulching:** Apply organic mulch around the base of the palm to conserve soil moisture and regulate soil temperature.
    *   **Nutrient Management:**
        *   **Boron Deficiency:** Apply 100-200 g of **Sodium tetraborate decahydrate** (Borax) or **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** per palm per year, split into two applications. Alternatively, a foliar spray of 0.2% (2 g/L) **Sodium tetraborate decahydrate** can be applied.
        *   **Potassium Deficiency:** Apply 1-2 kg of **Potassium chloride** (Muriate of Potash) or **Potassium sulphate** (Sulphate of Potash) per palm per year, split into 2-3 applications.
    *   **Variety Selection:** Where possible, choose varieties known to be less susceptible to fruit splitting.

### 2. Leaf Burning/Melting (Scorching, Necrosis)

*   **Causes:** Can be attributed to various environmental stresses such as high temperatures, intense solar radiation, drought stress, salinity, strong dry winds, or nutrient deficiencies (e.g., Potassium, Magnesium) or toxicities, and sometimes chemical phytotoxicity.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Adequate Irrigation:** Ensure consistent and sufficient water supply, particularly during hot and dry periods, to prevent drought stress.
    *   **Shade Management:** For young palms, provide temporary shade during periods of extreme heat and intense sunlight.
    *   **Windbreaks:** Establish windbreaks around the plantation to protect palms from strong, desiccating winds.
    *   **Nutrient Management:**
        *   **Potassium Deficiency:** Apply 1-2 kg of **Potassium chloride** or **Potassium sulphate** per palm per year.
        *   **Magnesium Deficiency:** Apply 0.5-1 kg of **Magnesium sulphate heptahydrate** per palm per year.
        *   **Balanced Fertilization:** Ensure a comprehensive nutrient management plan to prevent other deficiencies or toxicities.
    *   **Salinity Management:** If salinity is an issue, improve drainage, leach salts with good quality water, and consider using salt-tolerant rootstocks or varieties if available.
    *   **Proper Chemical Application:** Always follow label instructions for all agrochemicals to avoid phytotoxicity.

### 3. Hardness in Fruit (Undesirable or Premature Hardening)

*   **Causes:** This can refer to premature hardening of the endosperm or husk, or a lack of desired tenderness. It is often linked to inconsistent water supply, nutrient imbalances (e.g., Boron, Potassium, Calcium), high temperatures, or genetic factors.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Consistent Water Management:** Maintain optimal and uniform soil moisture throughout the fruit development stages to support proper endosperm and husk formation.
    *   **Balanced Nutrition:**
        *   **Boron:** Apply 100-200 g of **Sodium tetraborate decahydrate** or **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** per palm per year.
        *   **Potassium:** Apply 1-2 kg of **Potassium chloride** or **Potassium sulphate** per palm per year.
        *   **Calcium:** Ensure adequate calcium availability. If deficiency is suspected, apply **Calcium sulphate dihydrate** (Gypsum) to the soil or use foliar sprays of **Calcium nitrate tetrahydrate** at 0.5-1% (5-10 g/L).
    *   **Mulching:** Helps regulate soil temperature and moisture, contributing to more consistent fruit development.
    *   **Variety Selection:** Choose coconut varieties known for producing fruits with desired tenderness and quality characteristics.
