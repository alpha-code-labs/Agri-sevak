As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling soil pests in Coconut, adhering to CIBRC approved technical chemical names and metric units.

**Control of Soil Pests in Coconut**

**1. Termites (Subterranean Termites)**

Termites can cause significant damage to coconut palms, especially young plants, by feeding on roots and the base of the trunk.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Maintain good field sanitation by removing dead wood, stumps, and other organic debris from the vicinity of the palms, as these can serve as food sources and nesting sites for termites.
    *   Avoid piling organic manure directly against the base of the palm, as it can attract termites.
    *   Regularly inspect the base of the palm and surrounding soil for termite mud tubes.
*   **Chemical Control (for severe infestations or prophylactic treatment, especially for young palms):**
    *   Drench the soil around the base of the affected palms (up to 50 cm radius and 15-20 cm deep) with a solution of **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at a concentration of 2.5 ml/L of water. Use 5-10 liters of this solution per palm, depending on the size of the palm and severity of infestation.
    *   Alternatively, for young palms, mix **Fipronil** 0.3% GR at 20-30 g per palm into the soil around the base.

**2. Nematodes (Root-knot Nematodes - *Meloidogyne* spp. and others)**

Nematodes infest coconut roots, leading to root damage, nutrient deficiency symptoms, reduced vigor, and decreased yield.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Ensure optimal nutrition and irrigation to enhance the palm's tolerance to nematode damage.
    *   Incorporate organic amendments such as neem cake (2-5 kg/palm/year) or well-decomposed farmyard manure into the soil around the palms. These improve soil health and can suppress nematode populations.
*   **Biological Control:**
    *   Apply bio-nematicides containing *Purpureocillium lilacinum* (formerly *Paecilomyces lilacinus*) or *Trichoderma harzianum* at the rate of 20-50 g per palm. Mix the bio-nematicide with organic manure or apply it as a soil drench around the root zone. Repeat the application every 6 months for sustained control.
*   **Chemical Control (for severe infestations, consult local agricultural extension for specific recommendations):**
    *   Apply **Carbosulfan** 6% G at 50-100 g per palm. Mix the granules thoroughly into the soil around the root zone and irrigate immediately after application. Ensure the granules do not come into direct contact with the palm trunk.
    *   Alternatively, **Fluensulfone** 2% GR can be applied at 100-150 g per palm, mixed into the soil around the root zone.
