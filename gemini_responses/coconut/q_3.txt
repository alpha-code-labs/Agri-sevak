As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm that various types of rot are significant concerns in coconut cultivation, primarily caused by fungal pathogens. While "rot" is a general term, it manifests as specific diseases affecting different parts of the palm. The most common and destructive pathogens causing these rot types in coconut are *Phytophthora palmivora* and *Ganoderma lucidum*.

Here's a comprehensive approach to controlling all rot types in coconut:

**I. General Management Practices (Preventive and Cultural):**

These practices are crucial for reducing disease incidence and enhancing the palm's natural resistance:

*   **Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy all infected plant parts (leaves, nuts, fallen fronds, dead seedlings) to reduce the source of inoculum.
*   **Drainage:** Ensure excellent drainage in the coconut garden. Waterlogging creates anaerobic conditions and favors the development of many rot-causing pathogens, especially *Phytophthora* species.
*   **Nutrition:** Maintain optimal palm health through balanced fertilization. Healthy palms are more resilient to disease attacks.
*   **Weed Control:** Keep the base of the palm and the surrounding area free from weeds, which can harbor pathogens and impede air circulation.
*   **Avoid Injury:** Prevent mechanical injuries to the trunk, roots, and crown during cultural operations, as these can serve as entry points for pathogens.
*   **Spacing:** Maintain proper spacing between palms to ensure adequate air circulation and reduce humidity within the canopy.
*   **Water Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation during periods of high humidity, which can promote fungal growth.

**II. Specific Chemical Control Measures:**

The following measures target the primary diseases responsible for various rot types in coconut, using CIBRC-approved technical chemical names:

**1. Bud Rot (Affects Crown, Neck, Collar, and can lead to overall palm death):**
*   **Causative Agent:** Primarily *Phytophthora palmivora*.
*   **Symptoms:** Yellowing and drooping of spindle leaves, rotting of the spear leaf base, foul smell, and eventual death of the crown.
*   **Control:**
    *   **Early Stage:** Carefully remove all infected tissues from the crown.
    *   Apply a thick paste of **Copper oxychloride** (50% WP) (e.g., 100 g mixed with minimal water) to the cleaned, affected crown region.
    *   Alternatively, drench the crown with a solution of **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 3 g/L or **Copper oxychloride** (50% WP) at 3 g/L. Repeat every 15-30 days, especially during monsoon or high humidity.
    *   For systemic protection, inject **Fosetyl-aluminium** (80% WP) into the trunk at 2-3 g per palm, dissolved in 100 ml water, once or twice a year, preferably before the monsoon season.

**2. Basal Stem Rot / Ganoderma Wilt (Affects Root, Stem, Foot, and leads to gradual decline):**
*   **Causative Agent:** *Ganoderma lucidum* (and related species).
*   **Symptoms:** Reddish-brown oozing at the base of the trunk, rotting of basal tissues, shedding of older leaves, reduction in nut yield, and in advanced stages, the appearance of bracket fungi (basidiocarps) at the base.
*   **Control:**
    *   **Early Stage:**
        *   Drench the soil around the base of the palm (within a 1-meter radius) with **Hexaconazole** (5% SC) at 2 ml/L or **Propiconazole** (25% EC) at 2 ml/L, applying 5-10 litres of solution per palm, 2-3 times a year.
        *   Alternatively, apply **Tebuconazole** (25% WG) at 2 g/L as a soil drench.
        *   Root feeding with **Hexaconazole** (5% SC) at 2 ml/L or **Propiconazole** (25% EC) at 2 ml/L (50-100 ml solution per root) can also be done.
    *   **Advanced Stage:** Control is very difficult. Severely infected palms should be removed and destroyed to prevent the spread of the disease.

**3. Fruit Rot (Koleroga / Mahali Disease):**
*   **Causative Agent:** *Phytophthora palmivora*.
*   **Symptoms:** Water-soaked lesions on young nuts, turning brown to black, leading to premature nut fall.
*   **Control:**
    *   Spray bunches and crowns with **Copper oxychloride** (50% WP) at 3 g/L or **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 3 g/L. Repeat at 15-day intervals during the monsoon season.
    *   Alternatively, use **Propineb** (70% WP) at 2.5 g/L.

**4. Seed Rot and Seedling Rot:**
*   **Causative Agents:** *Phytophthora palmivora*, *Pythium* spp., *Rhizoctonia* spp., and other soil-borne fungi.
*   **Symptoms:** Poor germination, rotting of germinating nuts, damping-off symptoms in seedlings (water-soaked lesions at the collar region, leading to collapse).
*   **Control:**
    *   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds (nuts) before planting by dipping them in a solution of **Carbendazim** (50% WP) at 1 g/L or **Thiram** (75% WS) at 2 g/L for 30 minutes.
    *   **Seedling Drench:** Drench the soil around seedlings in the nursery with **Copper oxychloride** (50% WP) at 3 g/L or **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 3 g/L.
    *   A combination product like **Metalaxyl + Mancozeb** (72% WP) at 2.5 g/L can also be used as a drench for effective control of seedling rot.

Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions when handling and applying any chemical. Integrated disease management, combining cultural practices with judicious chemical application, is the most effective strategy for long-term control of rot diseases in coconut.
