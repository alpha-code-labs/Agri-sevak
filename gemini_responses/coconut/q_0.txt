As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding fungal diseases in Coconut, keeping in mind the context of Haryana and CIBRC approved chemicals.

It is important to note that coconut cultivation in Haryana is limited, and these recommendations are based on general best practices for coconut disease management.

Here's the assessment for each fungal disease listed:

*   **Alternaria:**
    This is not known to cause significant disease in Coconut.

*   **Anthracnose:**
    Anthracnose in coconut is primarily caused by *Colletotrichum gloeosporioides*, affecting leaves, spathes, and young nuts, leading to sunken lesions and dieback.
    **Control Measures:**
    *   **Cultural:** Remove and destroy infected plant parts. Ensure proper spacing and air circulation. Maintain good orchard hygiene.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   Foliar spray with **Carbendazim 50% WP** at 1-2 g/L of water.
        *   Alternatively, spray with **Mancozeb 75% WP** at 2-2.5 g/L of water.
        *   For systemic action, **Propiconazole 25% EC** can be used at 0.5-1 ml/L of water.

*   **Blast:**
    This is not known to affect Coconut. (The typical "Blast" disease, such as Rice Blast caused by *Magnaporthe oryzae*, does not affect coconut. While some diseases like bud rot are sometimes colloquially referred to as "blast," the specific fungal disease "Blast" is not a known pathogen of coconut.)

*   **Blight (Bud Rot and Leaf Blight):**
    Blight can manifest as Bud Rot (often caused by *Phytophthora palmivora*) or various Leaf Blights (e.g., *Pestalotiopsis palmarum*).
    **Control Measures for Bud Rot:**
    *   **Cultural:** Remove all infected tissues from the crown. Avoid mechanical injuries to the crown. Ensure good drainage.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   Drench the crown with **Copper Oxychloride 50% WP** at 2.5-3 g/L of water.
        *   Alternatively, apply a paste of **Copper Oxychloride 50% WP** mixed with water to the affected crown region.
        *   Systemic fungicides like **Metalaxyl 8% + Mancozeb 64% WP** at 2-2.5 g/L of water can be sprayed or poured into the crown.
        *   **Fosetyl-aluminium 80% WP** at 2-3 g/L of water can be used as a drench or foliar spray for *Phytophthora* control.
    **Control Measures for Leaf Blight:**
    *   **Cultural:** Prune and destroy severely infected leaves. Improve air circulation.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   Foliar spray with **Mancozeb 75% WP** at 2-2.5 g/L of water.
        *   Alternatively, **Carbendazim 50% WP** at 1-2 g/L of water.
        *   **Propiconazole 25% EC** at 0.5-1 ml/L of water can also be effective.

*   **Brown spot:**
    Brown spot, often caused by *Bipolaris incurvata*, appears as small, dark brown spots on leaves, which can enlarge and coalesce, leading to leaf necrosis.
    **Control Measures:**
    *   **Cultural:** Remove severely infected leaves. Maintain proper nutrient balance, especially potassium.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   Foliar spray with **Mancozeb 75% WP** at 2-2.5 g/L of water.
        *   Alternatively, **Carbendazim 50% WP** at 1-2 g/L of water.
        *   **Propiconazole 25% EC** at 0.5-1 ml/L of water can also be used.

*   **Downy/Powdery mildew:**
    This is not known to affect Coconut.

*   **Grey mildew:**
    This is not known to affect Coconut. (While Grey Leaf Spot caused by *Pestalotiopsis palmarum* is a known disease, "Grey mildew" as a specific disease name is not recognized for coconut.)

**General Recommendations for Integrated Disease Management:**

1.  **Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy diseased plant parts (leaves, spathes, nuts) to reduce inoculum.
2.  **Nutrition:** Ensure balanced fertilization, as nutrient deficiencies can predispose palms to diseases.
3.  **Water Management:** Provide adequate drainage to prevent waterlogging, which can favor root and crown diseases.
4.  **Variety Selection:** Where possible, choose disease-tolerant coconut varieties.
5.  **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect palms for early signs of disease to allow for timely intervention.

Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label for correct dosage, application method, and safety precautions. For specific local conditions or severe outbreaks, it is advisable to consult with local agricultural extension specialists.
