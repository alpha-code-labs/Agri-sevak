As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide scientifically verified advice for the control of Beetles and Weevils in Coconut. Sawflies are not known to be a significant pest of Coconut.

Coconut palms are primarily affected by specific beetle and weevil species, notably the Rhinoceros Beetle and the Red Palm Weevil, which are among the most destructive pests.

### Control of Beetles and Weevils in Coconut

**1. Rhinoceros Beetle (Oryctes rhinoceros)**

This beetle causes characteristic V-shaped cuts on fronds and bores into the growing point, damaging young leaves and inflorescences.

*   **Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
    *   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy all decaying organic matter, dead palms, and breeding sites (e.g., compost pits, decaying logs) in and around the plantation.
    *   **Mechanical Removal:** Use a long barbed iron hook to extract beetles from the crown of the palm, especially from damaged leaf axils. Fill the holes with sand mixed with an insecticide.
    *   **Leaf Axil Filling:** Fill the innermost 3-4 leaf axils and the central spindle leaf with a mixture of sand and an insecticide.

*   **Biological Control:**
    *   **Fungal Application:** Apply the entomopathogenic fungus *Metarhizium anisopliae* (strain var. *anisopliae*) in breeding sites (e.g., compost pits, decaying logs) at a rate of 5 x 10^11 spores per kg of organic matter.

*   **Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved):**
    *   **Leaf Axil Application:**
        *   Apply a mixture of 20 g of **Carbaryl** 50 WP with 200 g of sand in the innermost 3-4 leaf axils and the central spindle leaf. Repeat every 3 months.
        *   Alternatively, apply 2.5 g of **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG mixed with 200 g of sand in the innermost 3-4 leaf axils. Repeat every 3-4 months.
    *   **Crown Drenching/Injection (for severe infestations):**
        *   Drench the crown with 10 ml of **Fipronil** 5% SC diluted in 1 liter of water per palm.
        *   Alternatively, drench the crown with 10 ml of **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC diluted in 500 ml of water per palm.

**2. Red Palm Weevil (Rhynchophorus ferrugineus)**

This weevil is highly destructive, boring into the stem and crown, often leading to the death of the palm. Symptoms include oozing of reddish-brown liquid, chewed-up plant material, and characteristic "gnawing" sounds from inside the trunk.

*   **Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
    *   **Avoid Injuries:** Prevent any mechanical injuries to the palm trunk during cultural operations, as these serve as entry points for the weevil.
    *   **Pruning:** Prune only mature green leaves and avoid cutting green leaves unnecessarily. Apply a wound dressing (e.g., Bordeaux paste) to cut surfaces.
    *   **Early Detection:** Regularly inspect palms for early signs of infestation (e.g., small holes, oozing sap, frass).

*   **Pheromone Trapping:**
    *   Install Red Palm Weevil pheromone traps (e.g., Ferrolure+) at a density of 1 trap per 2.5 acres (approximately 1 trap per hectare) to monitor and mass-trap adult weevils. Add a bait (e.g., fermented toddy or sugarcane molasses) to enhance attraction.

*   **Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved):**
    *   **Stem Injection (for localized infestations):**
        *   Inject 10 ml of **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC diluted in 500 ml of water per palm into the affected area of the trunk. Ensure the injection hole is sealed after treatment.
        *   Alternatively, inject 10 ml of **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL diluted in 500 ml of water per palm into the affected area.
        *   *Note: Stem injections should be performed by trained personnel to avoid further damage to the palm.*
    *   **Crown Drenching (for preventive or early-stage infestations):**
        *   Drench the crown with 10 g of **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG diluted in 1 liter of water per palm.
        *   Alternatively, drench the crown with 10-20 ml of **Fipronil** 5% SC diluted in 1 liter of water per palm.

**Sawflies**

This is not known to affect Coconut. Sawflies are typically pests of broadleaf trees and conifers, not monocotyledonous plants like coconut palms.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the label instructions for any pesticide product.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods, is recommended for sustainable pest control.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension services for specific recommendations tailored to your region and current pest pressure.
