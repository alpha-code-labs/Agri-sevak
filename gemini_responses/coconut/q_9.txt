Mites, including Red spider mite (e.g., *Tetranychus* spp.) and Coconut mite (*Aceria guerreronis*, often referred to as rust mite due to the damage it causes), are significant pests of coconut. *Aceria guerreronis* is particularly damaging as it attacks the tender parts of young nuts, leading to malformation and yield loss.

Here's a scientifically verified approach for their control:

**I. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Principles:**

1.  **Regular Monitoring:** Regularly inspect young nuts (1-5 months old) for symptoms of *Aceria guerreronis* (triangular patches, brown lesions at the base of the nut) and leaves for red spider mites (yellowing, bronzing, fine webbing).
2.  **Nutritional Management:** Ensure proper nutrient management and irrigation to maintain palm vigour, which helps palms tolerate pest damage better.
3.  **Hygiene:** Remove and destroy all severely infested and fallen nuts to reduce the mite population.

**II. Cultural and Biological Control:**

1.  **Removal of Infested Nuts:** Manually remove and destroy all nuts showing severe damage from *Aceria guerreronis*.
2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   **Predatory Mites:** Naturally occurring predatory mites (e.g., *Amblyseius* spp.) can help in suppressing red spider mite populations.
    *   **Entomopathogenic Fungi:** *Hirsutella thompsonii* is a known natural enemy of eriophyid mites like *Aceria guerreronis*. Formulations of this fungus can be sprayed, especially during humid conditions.
3.  **Neem Cake Application:** Apply 5 kg of neem cake per palm per year in two split doses (June-July and October-November) to improve palm health and potentially deter pests.

**III. Chemical Control (Acaricides):**

Chemical control should be used judiciously and as part of an IPM strategy. For *Aceria guerreronis*, the application method is crucial as the mites are hidden under the perianth of young nuts.

**A. For Coconut Mite (*Aceria guerreronis* - Rust Mite):**

The most effective method is targeted spot application to the base of young nuts (1-5 months old).

*   **Spot Application:** Mix the acaricide with water and apply directly to the tender parts under the perianth of young nuts using a small brush or a hand-held sprayer with a fine nozzle. Repeat the application every 45-60 days during peak infestation periods.
    *   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP:** Mix 30-40 g in 1 litre of water and apply to the base of young nuts.
    *   **Azadirachtin 1500 ppm:** Mix 5-10 ml in 1 litre of water and apply to the base of young nuts.
    *   **Propargite 57% EC:** Mix 2.0-2.5 ml in 1 litre of water and apply to the base of young nuts.
    *   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** Mix 0.3-0.4 ml in 1 litre of water and apply to the base of young nuts.

**B. For Red Spider Mite (on leaves):**

For red spider mites, which typically infest the underside of leaves, a thorough foliar spray is recommended.

*   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP:** 3-5 g/L of water (or 2.5-3.0 kg/acre).
*   **Propargite 57% EC:** 2.0-2.5 ml/L of water (or 1.0-1.25 L/acre).
*   **Fenpyroximate 5% SC:** 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water (or 200-300 ml/acre).
*   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** 0.3-0.4 ml/L of water (or 160-200 ml/acre).
*   **Abamectin 1.9% EC:** 0.4-0.5 ml/L of water (or 200-300 ml/acre).
*   **Azadirachtin 1500 ppm:** 5 ml/L of water.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) while handling and applying chemicals.
*   **Calibration:** Ensure your sprayer is properly calibrated to deliver the correct dosage.
*   **Rotation:** Rotate different classes of acaricides to prevent the development of resistance in mite populations.
*   **Environmental Conditions:** Avoid spraying during strong winds or when rain is imminent. Early morning or late evening hours are generally best for spraying.
*   **Consult Local Experts:** For specific recommendations tailored to your local conditions and the severity of infestation, it is always advisable to consult with local agricultural extension officers or scientists from Haryana Agricultural University.
