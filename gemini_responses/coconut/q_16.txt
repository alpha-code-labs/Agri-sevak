As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), my advice is specifically tailored for the agro-climatic conditions of Haryana, India.

Coconut (Cocos nucifera) is a tropical crop that requires a hot, humid climate, high rainfall, and well-drained sandy soils, typically found in coastal regions. Haryana, being a landlocked state with a semi-arid to sub-humid continental climate, is not naturally suited for the commercial cultivation of coconut.

Therefore, Haryana Agricultural University does not have specific research-based fertilizer recommendations for coconut cultivation within the state, as it is not a commercially viable or recommended crop for Haryana's agro-climatic zone. Attempting to grow coconut in Haryana would require significant artificial environmental modifications and would likely not be economically sustainable.

For general information on coconut fertilization in regions where it is commercially cultivated, recommendations typically involve a balanced approach of Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K), along with micronutrients. However, these recommendations are highly specific to soil type, age of the palm, yield potential, and local climatic conditions of the coconut-growing regions, and would not be directly applicable or advisable for Haryana.
