As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified recommendations for the use of Growth Regulators/Hormones in Coconut, keeping in mind the general agricultural practices and scientific consensus, as coconut is not a primary crop in Haryana.

Please note that specific recommendations for coconut are often derived from research conducted in major coconut-growing regions of India.

### Recommended Doses of Growth Regulators/Hormones in Coconut:

*   **Ethephon (Ethrel):**
    *   **Purpose:** To induce early flowering, increase female flower production, and enhance sap yield (toddy).
    *   **Dose:**
        *   **Foliar Spray:** 200-400 ppm (parts per million) solution. This translates to approximately 0.2-0.4 ml of 40% **Ethephon** formulation per litre of water. Apply 2-3 sprays at monthly intervals.
        *   **Trunk Injection:** For specific purposes like increasing sap yield, 100-200 mg of active ingredient per palm can be injected into the trunk. This requires specialized equipment and expertise.

*   **2,4-D (2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid):**
    *   This is not known to affect Coconut as a commonly recommended growth regulator for general application. While 2,4-D is a synthetic auxin and can act as a plant growth regulator at extremely low concentrations, its primary agricultural use in Haryana and globally is as a herbicide. There are no standard, widely accepted recommendations for its use as a growth regulator in coconut for purposes like fruit set or retention from major coconut research institutions.

*   **Boron:**
    *   **Purpose:** Boron is an essential micronutrient crucial for pollen germination, fruit set, and preventing 'button shedding' (premature nut drop).
    *   **Dose:**
        *   **Foliar Spray:** Spray 0.2% **Borax** solution (2 g of **Borax** per litre of water) to the crown and leaves. Apply 2-3 times a year, especially during flowering and fruit set stages.
        *   **Soil Application:** Apply 50-100 g of **Borax** per palm per year, mixed with organic manure, applied in a basin around the palm. This is particularly recommended in areas with known Boron deficiency.
