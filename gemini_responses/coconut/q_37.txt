As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), my expertise is focused on crops relevant to the agricultural landscape of Haryana. Coconut (Cocos nucifera) is a tropical palm that requires specific climatic conditions, primarily found in coastal regions of India, and is not cultivated in Haryana. Therefore, providing specific methods for protecting Coconut from wild animals within the context of Haryana agriculture is not applicable.
