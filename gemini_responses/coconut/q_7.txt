As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I must provide scientifically verified advice specific to the crops and conditions known to affect them.

Regarding your query:

*   **Dieback in Coconut:** This is not known to affect Coconut as a specific disease. While symptoms resembling dieback (e.g., drying of frond tips) can occur due to various factors like nutrient deficiencies, water stress, or other diseases, "Dieback" itself is not a recognized disease name for coconut.
*   **Twig blight in Coconut:** Coconut palms do not have "twigs" in the conventional sense. Therefore, "Twig blight" is not known to affect Coconut.
*   **Tikka disease in Coconut:** This is not known to affect Coconut. Tikka disease is a well-known disease primarily affecting groundnut (peanut).
