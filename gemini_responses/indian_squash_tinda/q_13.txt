As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in Indian Squash (Tinda) in Haryana:

### Ber Fly (Carpomyia vesuviana)

This is not known to affect Indian Squash (Tinda). Ber fly is a specific pest of Ber (Ziziphus mauritiana).

### Fruit Fly (Bactrocera cucurbitae) in Indian Squash (Tinda)

Fruit flies, primarily the Melon Fruit Fly (*Bactrocera cucurbitae*), are a significant pest of Indian Squash (Tinda). Effective control requires an integrated approach:

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**

*   **Field Sanitation:** Regularly collect and destroy all fallen, damaged, or infested fruits by burying them deep in the soil (at least 60 cm deep) or burning them. This breaks the life cycle of the pest.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** After harvest, deep ploughing helps expose and destroy pupae in the soil.
*   **Timely Harvesting:** Harvest fruits at the appropriate stage to prevent over-ripening on the plant, which attracts fruit flies.
*   **Pheromone Traps:** Install specific cucurbit fruit fly pheromone traps (e.g., Methyl Eugenol traps for male annihilation, or specific lures for *Bactrocera cucurbitae*) at a density of 10-12 traps per acre. Replace lures every 2-3 weeks.

**2. Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved):**

Chemical control should be used judiciously, preferably as bait sprays or spot applications, to minimize impact on beneficial insects and the environment.

*   **Bait Sprays:** This is a highly effective method. Prepare a bait solution and apply it as small droplets on the leaves (not directly on fruits) or on non-host plants around the field.
    *   Mix **Malathion 50% EC** at 10-20 ml per litre of water along with 100 g of jaggery or protein hydrolysate per litre of water. Apply this bait spray once a week, especially during fruiting.
*   **Foliar Sprays (if infestation is severe):**
    *   **Malathion 50% EC:** 1.5 - 2 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Dimethoate 30% EC:** 1.5 - 2 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Spinosad 45% SC:** 0.25 - 0.3 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** 0.5 ml per litre of water.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully.
*   Observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) for any chemical applied to ensure the safety of the produce.
*   Rotate different classes of insecticides to prevent the development of resistance.
*   Apply insecticides preferably in the evening to minimize harm to pollinators.
