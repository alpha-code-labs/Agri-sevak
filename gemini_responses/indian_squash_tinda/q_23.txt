As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified seed and soil treatment processes for Indian Squash (Tinda) to ensure healthy crop establishment and mitigate common pest and disease issues in Haryana.

### Seed Treatment for Indian Squash (Tinda)

Seed treatment is crucial for protecting germinating seeds and young seedlings from seed-borne and early soil-borne diseases, as well as initial insect pest attacks.

1.  **Fungal Protection (Damping-off, Seedling Blight):**
    *   **Option 1 (Chemical):** Treat seeds with a broad-spectrum fungicide.
        *   **Thiram** @ 2.5 grams per kilogram of seed.
        *   Alternatively, **Carbendazim** @ 1-2 grams per kilogram of seed.
    *   **Option 2 (Biological):** For organic farming or integrated pest management.
        *   **Trichoderma viride** @ 4-5 grams per kilogram of seed.
        *   *Method:* Mix the required quantity of fungicide/biological with a small amount of water to make a slurry. Coat the seeds evenly and allow them to dry in the shade before sowing.

2.  **Insect Protection (Early Sucking Pests):**
    *   To protect against early season sucking pests like aphids and whiteflies, a systemic insecticide can be used.
        *   **Imidacloprid 70 WS** @ 5-7 grams per kilogram of seed.
        *   Alternatively, **Thiamethoxam 70 WS** @ 3-5 grams per kilogram of seed.
        *   *Method:* Apply after fungicide treatment (if using both). Mix the insecticide with a small amount of water to make a slurry, coat the seeds evenly, and dry in the shade.

### Soil Treatment for Indian Squash (Tinda)

Soil treatment focuses on managing soil-borne diseases, nematodes, and improving overall soil health before or at the time of planting.

1.  **Management of Soil-borne Fungal Diseases (Wilt, Root Rot, Damping-off):**
    *   **Biological Treatment (Recommended):** Apply biological agents to the soil 10-15 days before sowing or at the time of final land preparation.
        *   **Trichoderma viride** @ 2.5 kilograms per acre.
        *   **Pseudomonas fluorescens** @ 2.5 kilograms per acre.
        *   *Method:* Mix the biological agents with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost. Keep the mixture moist and covered for 3-5 days in a cool, shaded place to allow the microbes to multiply. Broadcast this enriched FYM evenly over the field and incorporate it into the soil.

2.  **Management of Root-Knot Nematodes:**
    *   **Organic Amendment:**
        *   **Neem cake** @ 200-400 kilograms per acre.
        *   *Method:* Apply and thoroughly mix into the soil 2-3 weeks before planting. Neem cake acts as a slow-release fertilizer and has nematicidal properties.
    *   **Biological Nematicide:**
        *   **Purpureocillium lilacinum** @ 2.5 kilograms per acre.
        *   *Method:* Similar to Trichoderma, mix with FYM/compost and apply to the soil 10-15 days before planting.
    *   **Chemical Nematicide (for severe infestations):**
        *   **Fluensulfone 2% GR** @ 10 kilograms per acre.
        *   *Method:* Apply uniformly in the soil at the time of planting and incorporate it lightly.

3.  **General Soil Health Improvement:**
    *   Incorporate 10-15 tonnes of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost per acre during the final land preparation. This improves soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability, fostering a healthy environment for plant growth.

**Note:** Always follow the specific instructions and safety precautions provided on the product labels. Ensure proper protective gear is used during application.
