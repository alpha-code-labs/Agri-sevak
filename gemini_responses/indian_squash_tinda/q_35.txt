As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for Indian Squash (Tinda) in Haryana:

**Maturity Signs for Indian Squash (Tinda):**
*   **Size:** Fruits should be of marketable size, typically 5-8 cm in diameter.
*   **Skin Colour:** The skin should be light green, glossy, and smooth. Avoid fruits showing any yellowing, which indicates over-maturity.
*   **Texture:** The fruit should be firm to the touch but tender. Over-mature fruits become hard, fibrous, and seedy.
*   **Absence of Hardness:** The skin should be easily pierced with a fingernail, indicating tenderness.

**Harvesting Time for Indian Squash (Tinda):**
*   Harvesting typically begins 40-50 days after sowing, depending on the variety and prevailing environmental conditions.
*   Fruits should be harvested when they are young and tender, before they become fully mature, hard, and seedy.
*   Regular harvesting (every 2-3 days) is crucial to encourage continuous flowering and fruit production, thereby maximizing yield.
*   The harvesting period can extend for 60-90 days from sowing, with multiple pickings.

**Cutting Process for Indian Squash (Tinda):**
*   Use a sharp knife or secateurs for harvesting.
*   Cut the fruit from the vine, ensuring to leave a short stalk (pedicel) of approximately 1-2 cm attached to the fruit. This helps in better post-harvest handling and reduces the risk of spoilage.
*   Avoid pulling or twisting the fruit, as this can damage the main vine and negatively impact subsequent yields.
*   Handle the harvested fruits carefully to prevent bruising, which can reduce their market value and shelf life.
