Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm that Red Spider Mites (Tetranychus urticae) and Rust Mites (often broad mites like Polyphagotarsonemus latus, or eriophyid mites) are significant pests that can affect Indian Squash (Tinda) in Haryana.

These mites can cause considerable damage if not managed effectively.

**Symptoms:**
*   **Red Spider Mites:** Typically found on the underside of leaves. Symptoms include fine webbing, yellow or silvery stippling on the upper leaf surface, and bronzing or reddening of leaves, leading to premature leaf drop.
*   **Rust Mites (Broad Mites):** These are microscopic and cause bronzing, curling, and distortion of young leaves and growing points. Flowers may abort, and fruits can become russeted or malformed.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies:**

1.  **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect the undersides of leaves, especially during dry and warm weather, for early signs of mite infestation. A hand lens can be very useful for detecting mites.
2.  **Water Management:** Mites thrive in dry, dusty conditions. Ensure proper irrigation and avoid water stress. Overhead irrigation can sometimes help dislodge mites.
3.  **Weed Control:** Remove weeds in and around the Tinda field, as they can act as alternate hosts for mites.
4.  **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy severely infested plant parts or entire plants to reduce mite populations.
5.  **Biological Control:** Encourage natural enemies such as predatory mites (e.g., Amblyseius species), lacewings, and minute pirate bugs, which feed on pest mites. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

**Chemical Control (Acaricides):**

When mite populations are high and causing economic damage, chemical control may be necessary. Always rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where mites reside.

Here are some CIBRC-approved technical chemical names for mite control in cucurbits:

*   **Spiromesifen** (22.9% SC): Apply at a rate of **0.5 ml per litre** of water.
*   **Propargite** (57% EC): Apply at a rate of **1.5 - 2.0 ml per litre** of water.
*   **Fenpyroximate** (5% EC): Apply at a rate of **0.5 ml per litre** of water.
*   **Abamectin** (1.9% EC): Apply at a rate of **0.4 - 0.5 ml per litre** of water.
*   **Wettable Sulphur** (80% WP): Particularly effective against rust mites. Apply at a rate of **2.0 - 3.0 g per litre** of water. Avoid spraying sulphur when temperatures are very high (above 30-32°C) as it can cause phytotoxicity.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label for specific dosages, pre-harvest intervals (PHI), and safety precautions.
*   Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during application.
*   Ensure good spray coverage, targeting the undersides of leaves.
*   Rotate different classes of acaricides to prevent resistance development.
