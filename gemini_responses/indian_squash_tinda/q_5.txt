As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned conditions in Indian Squash (Tinda) in Haryana.

### Scab (Caused by *Cladosporium cucumerinum*)

This disease can affect Indian Squash (Tinda).

*   **Symptoms:** Initial symptoms include small, water-soaked spots on leaves, stems, and fruits. On fruits, these spots enlarge, become sunken, and turn olive-green to dark brown, often exuding a sticky substance. The lesions can crack, making the fruit unmarketable.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Cultural Practices:**
        *   Implement a crop rotation program, avoiding cucurbit crops in the same field for at least 2-3 years.
        *   Use certified disease-free seeds.
        *   Ensure good field sanitation by promptly removing and destroying infected plant debris.
        *   Avoid overhead irrigation, which can facilitate spore dispersal and prolonged leaf wetness.
    *   **Chemical Control (Apply at the first sign of disease, repeat as per label instructions):**
        *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L water).
        *   **Chlorothalonil** (75% WP) at 2 kg/acre (or 2 g/L water).
        *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC) at 200 ml/acre (or 0.5 ml/L water).

### Canker and Gummosis (Often associated with Gummy Stem Blight, caused by *Didymella bryoniae* / *Stagonosporopsis cucurbitacearum*)

These conditions can affect Indian Squash (Tinda). Gummosis is a symptom, often of gummy stem blight, where gum exudes from cankers on stems.

*   **Symptoms:** Water-soaked lesions appear on leaves, stems, and fruits. Stem lesions can expand, girdle the stem, and often exude an amber-colored, sticky gum (gummosis). This can lead to wilting and collapse of the plant. Fruit lesions are typically dark, sunken, and can lead to soft rot.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Cultural Practices:**
        *   Utilize resistant or tolerant varieties if available for Tinda.
        *   Practice strict crop rotation with non-cucurbit crops for at least 2-3 years.
        *   Maintain good field hygiene, including sanitation of tools and equipment.
        *   Promptly remove and destroy all infected plant parts to reduce inoculum.
        *   Ensure proper plant spacing and ventilation to reduce humidity within the canopy.
    *   **Chemical Control (Apply preventively or at early stages of disease development):**
        *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L water).
        *   **Chlorothalonil** (75% WP) at 2 kg/acre (or 2 g/L water).
        *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC) at 200 ml/acre (or 0.5 ml/L water).
        *   **Difenoconazole** (25% EC) at 100 ml/acre (or 0.25 ml/L water).
        *   **Copper Oxychloride** (50% WP) at 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L water) can also be used, particularly if bacterial involvement is suspected.

### Lichen

This is not known to affect Indian Squash (Tinda). Lichens are symbiotic organisms (fungus and alga) that are typically epiphytic, meaning they grow harmlessly on the surface of other plants, usually on the bark of older, woody perennial trees and shrubs. They do not parasitize or cause damage to annual herbaceous plants like Indian Squash (Tinda).

Consult with your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions.
