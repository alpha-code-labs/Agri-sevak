As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an integrated weed management approach for Indian Squash (Tinda), combining cultural practices with judicious use of scientifically verified and CIBRC-approved herbicides. Given the sensitivity of cucurbit crops, careful application is paramount.

**General Weed Management Principles:**

*   **Field Preparation:** Ensure thorough ploughing and harrowing to reduce the initial weed seed bank.
*   **Clean Seeds:** Use certified, weed-free seeds to prevent the introduction of new weeds.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate Tinda with non-host crops to break weed cycles and reduce specific weed populations.
*   **Inter-cultivation:** Shallow inter-cultivation can effectively control young weeds without damaging crop roots.
*   **Manual Weeding:** Hand weeding is highly effective, especially for weeds growing close to the crop plants, and should be done at critical stages (e.g., 15-30 days after sowing).

**Specific Weed Control Recommendations:**

**1. Broadleaf Weeds (including Bathu and Congress grass) and Narrowleaf Weeds (Grasses):**

*   **Pre-emergence Application (within 1-3 days of sowing/transplanting):**
    *   Apply **Pendimethalin** 30% EC at 3.3 - 4.3 L per acre, or **Pendimethalin** 38.7% CS at 2.6 - 3.4 L per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water. This will control a wide range of germinating broadleaf and narrowleaf weeds. Ensure uniform spray and adequate soil moisture for best results.

*   **Post-emergence Application (for Grasses only):**
    *   For control of narrowleaf weeds (grasses) after crop emergence, when weeds are at the 2-4 leaf stage:
        *   Apply **Quizalofop-ethyl** 5% EC at 1.0 L per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water.
        *   Alternatively, apply **Fenoxaprop-p-ethyl** 9.3% EC at 500-600 ml per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water.
    *   **Note:** These herbicides are specific for grasses and are generally safe for Tinda. Avoid spraying on broadleaf weeds as they will not be controlled.

*   **Post-emergence Application (for Broadleaf Weeds and General Inter-row Weeds):**
    *   For broadleaf weeds like Bathu and Congress grass, manual weeding is the safest and most effective post-emergence method in Tinda due to the crop's sensitivity to most selective broadleaf herbicides.
    *   For weeds in inter-row spaces, a directed spray of non-selective herbicides can be used with extreme caution to avoid contact with Tinda plants:
        *   Apply **Paraquat dichloride** 24% SL at 2.0 - 4.0 L per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water.
        *   Alternatively, apply **Glyphosate** 41% SL at 2.0 - 3.0 L per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water.
    *   **STRICT CAUTION:** These are non-selective herbicides and will cause severe damage or death if they come into contact with Tinda plants. Use a protective hood on the spray nozzle and spray only between rows, away from the crop.

**2. Amarbail (*Cuscuta* spp.):**

*   **Prevention:** This parasitic weed is best managed through preventive measures. Use only certified, Amarbail-free seeds. Avoid using farmyard manure or irrigation water contaminated with Amarbail seeds.
*   **Pre-emergence:** The pre-emergence application of **Pendimethalin** (as mentioned above) can offer some suppression of germinating Amarbail seeds.
*   **Post-emergence:** Once Amarbail has established, manual removal is the most effective method. Carefully hand-pull or cut the infested parts of the crop and the Amarbail strands before they produce seeds. Remove and destroy the removed plant material away from the field.

**3. Orobanche (*Broomrape*):**

*   This is not known to affect Indian Squash (Tinda). Orobanche species are primarily parasitic on solanaceous crops (e.g., tomato, brinjal), crucifers, and some legumes.

**4. Phalaris minor (*Little Seed Canary Grass*):**

*   This is not known to affect Indian Squash (Tinda). *Phalaris minor* is predominantly a weed of winter cereal crops, particularly wheat, and is not typically found as a significant weed in summer/kharif cucurbit crops like Tinda.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the label instructions of the herbicide product carefully.
*   Ensure proper calibration of spray equipment for accurate dosage.
*   Apply herbicides during calm weather to prevent drift.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application.
