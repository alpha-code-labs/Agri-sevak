Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an integrated approach for managing soil pests like termites and root-knot nematodes in Indian Squash (Tinda) to ensure sustainable and effective control.

### 1. Control of Termites (Deemak)

Termites can cause significant damage by feeding on roots and stems, leading to wilting and plant death.

**A. Cultural and Preventive Measures:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove all crop residues, stubble, and woody debris from the field before planting, as these can serve as food sources and breeding sites for termites.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** Ploughing the field deeply during summer exposes termite colonies to sunlight and predators, disrupting their activity.
*   **Proper Decomposition of Organic Matter:** Ensure that farmyard manure (FYM) or compost is well-decomposed before application, as undecomposed organic matter can attract termites.

**B. Chemical Control (Pre-planting/Soil Application):**
For severe infestations, chemical treatment can be applied to the soil before planting or at the time of sowing.
*   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC:** Apply 2-4 litres per acre mixed with 400-600 litres of water as a soil drench before planting or at the time of land preparation. Ensure uniform mixing in the soil.
*   **Fipronil 0.3% GR:** Apply 10-20 kg per acre by broadcasting and mixing thoroughly into the soil before planting.

### 2. Control of Root-knot Nematodes (Jad Ganth Krumi)

Root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.) are microscopic worms that infect plant roots, causing galls or knots, leading to stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, and reduced yield.

**A. Cultural and Preventive Measures:**
*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate Tinda with non-host crops like cereals (maize, sorghum, pearl millet) or marigold for at least 2-3 years. Marigold (Tagetes spp.) is particularly effective as a trap crop or bio-fumigant.
*   **Summer Solarization:** During the hot summer months (May-June), plough the field, irrigate it lightly, and then cover it tightly with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks. The high temperatures generated under the sheet kill nematodes and other soil-borne pathogens.
*   **Use of Healthy Seedlings:** Ensure that seedlings are free from nematode infection if you are transplanting.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** Exposes nematodes to sunlight and desiccation.

**B. Biological Control:**
*   **Neem Cake:** Incorporate 200-400 kg of **Neem cake** per acre into the soil 2-3 weeks before planting. Neem cake releases compounds that are toxic to nematodes and also enhances beneficial microbial activity.
*   **Purpureocillium lilacinum (formerly Paecilomyces lilacinus):** Apply 2.5-5 kg of **Purpureocillium lilacinum** (1% WP formulation) per acre. Mix it with 100-200 kg of well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost and apply to the soil before planting or at the time of sowing. This bio-nematicide parasitizes nematode eggs and females.

**C. Chemical Control (if severe infestation):**
For fields with a history of severe nematode problems, chemical nematicides can be used as a last resort.
*   **Carbofuran 3% G:** Apply 10-15 kg per acre by broadcasting and mixing into the soil at the time of planting.
*   **Fipronil 0.3% GR:** Apply 10-20 kg per acre by broadcasting and mixing thoroughly into the soil before planting. This granular formulation also offers some control against nematodes in addition to termites.

Always follow the instructions on the product label for safe and effective application. For specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions, please consult with your local agricultural extension officer.
