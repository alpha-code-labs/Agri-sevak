As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following doses of organic manures for Indian Squash (Tinda) to ensure optimal growth and yield in Haryana conditions:

*   **Farm Yard Manure (FYM):**
    *   Apply **10-15 tonnes per acre** (10,000-15,000 kg/acre) during land preparation, about 2-3 weeks before sowing. Ensure it is well-decomposed.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   Apply **2-4 tonnes per acre** (2,000-4,000 kg/acre) during land preparation, either as a standalone organic amendment or as a supplement/partial replacement for FYM.

*   **Seaweed Extract (e.g., products like Sagarika):**
    *   **For soil application (granular form):** Apply **8-16 kg per acre** at the time of sowing or transplanting, mixed with the soil.
    *   **For foliar application (liquid form):** Prepare a solution of **2.5-5 ml per litre of water**.
        *   First spray: 20-25 days after sowing/transplanting.
        *   Second spray: At flowering stage.
        *   Third spray: At fruit development stage.
