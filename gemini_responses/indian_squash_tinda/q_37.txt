Protecting Indian Squash (Tinda) from wild animals is a significant challenge for farmers in Haryana. A multi-pronged approach combining physical barriers, cultural practices, and deterrents is generally most effective.

*   **Physical Barriers:**
    *   **Fencing:**
        *   **Barbed Wire Fencing:** Install 5-7 strands of barbed wire at varying heights (from ground level up to 1.5-2 meters) around the field. This is effective against larger animals like Nilgai (Blue Bull) and wild boar.
        *   **Mesh Fencing:** A more robust option, especially against smaller animals and to prevent larger animals from pushing through. Ensure the mesh is strong and buried slightly underground to prevent burrowing.
        *   **Electric Fencing:** Highly effective in deterring most wild animals by delivering a non-lethal shock. Requires careful installation, proper earthing, and clear warning signs to ensure safety for humans and animals. Regular maintenance is crucial.
    *   **Trenching:** Digging a deep (e.g., 1-1.5 meters) and wide (e.g., 0.5-1 meter) trench around the field can prevent wild boar and other ground-dwelling animals from entering, especially when combined with a fence.

*   **Repellents:**
    *   While specific CIBRC-approved technical chemical names for wild animal repellents directly applied to crops are limited, some substances can offer a degree of deterrence.
    *   **Neem-based formulations:** **Azadirachtin** (the active ingredient in Neem oil) is primarily approved as an insecticide, nematicide, and fungicide. However, its strong odor and bitter taste can act as a general repellent against some animals. Apply **Neem oil** formulations at a concentration of 5 ml/L of water as a foliar spray, ensuring thorough coverage of the plants. Reapplication every 7-10 days or after heavy rainfall is necessary. It is important to note that its efficacy against large, determined wild animals may be limited.

*   **Scare Devices:**
    *   **Scarecrows:** Traditional method, but animals often habituate quickly, reducing long-term effectiveness.
    *   **Noise Makers:** Devices such as gas guns (bird scarers), crackers, or drums can temporarily deter animals. However, their effectiveness diminishes as animals become accustomed to the noise.
    *   **Reflective Tapes/CDs:** Hanging reflective tapes or old CDs can deter birds and some smaller animals due to flashing light, but are generally ineffective against larger mammals.

*   **Guarding:**
    *   **Human Guarding:** Employing human guards, especially during critical periods (e.g., fruiting stage) and at night, can be highly effective but is labor-intensive and costly.
    *   **Guard Dogs:** Trained guard dogs can be an effective deterrent against various wild animals.

*   **Cultural Practices and Habitat Management:**
    *   **Clearing Perimeters:** Keep the area around the field clear of weeds, bushes, and debris that can provide cover or hiding places for wild animals.
    *   **Timely Harvesting:** Harvest the crop as soon as it matures to reduce the period of vulnerability.

*   **Community-Based Approaches:**
    *   Coordinated efforts among farmers in a village or cluster of fields are often more effective than individual actions, especially for highly mobile animals like Nilgai and wild boar. This can involve shared guarding duties or collective investment in fencing.

A combination of these methods, tailored to the specific wild animal threats in your area, will provide the best protection for your Tinda crop.
