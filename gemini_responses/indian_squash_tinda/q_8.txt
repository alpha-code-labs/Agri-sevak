As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling sucking pests in Indian Squash (Tinda) in Haryana.

**Regarding Psylla:**
This is not known to affect Indian Squash (Tinda). Psylla (psyllids) are generally not considered a primary or significant pest of Indian Squash (Tinda) in Haryana. Therefore, specific control measures for Psylla are typically not required for this crop.

For the control of Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips, an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is highly recommended, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies:**

1.  **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect plants (especially undersides of leaves) for the presence of pests and their natural enemies. Early detection is crucial.
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep fields and surrounding areas free of weeds, as they can harbor sucking pests.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid continuous cultivation of cucurbit crops in the same field.
    *   **Balanced Fertilization:** Avoid excessive nitrogen application, which can lead to lush, soft growth that attracts sucking pests.
    *   **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing for good air circulation.
3.  **Biological Control:** Encourage natural enemies such as ladybird beetles, lacewings, hoverflies, and parasitic wasps, which prey on aphids and whiteflies. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.
4.  **Physical Barriers:** For small-scale cultivation, insect-proof nets can be used to prevent pest entry.
5.  **Yellow Sticky Traps:** Install yellow sticky traps (10-15 traps per acre) to monitor and trap adult whiteflies and leafhoppers.

**Chemical Control (Apply only when pest populations exceed economic threshold levels):**

When chemical intervention is necessary, rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Always ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where many sucking pests reside. Use the recommended dosage and follow pre-harvest intervals (PHI) strictly.

Here are some CIBRC approved technical chemical names effective against these sucking pests:

*   **For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips (Broad Spectrum Systemic Insecticides):**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at 0.5 - 0.75 ml per litre of water (or 100 - 150 ml per acre).
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at 0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water (or 80 - 100 g per acre).
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply at 0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water (or 80 - 100 g per acre).
    *   **Dinotefuran 20% SG:** Apply at 0.3 - 0.4 g per litre of water (or 120 - 160 g per acre).

*   **Primarily for Whiteflies (especially nymphs) and Mites:**
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at 1.0 - 1.25 ml per litre of water (or 400 - 500 ml per acre). This is an Insect Growth Regulator (IGR) effective against nymphs.
    *   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** Apply at 0.5 - 0.75 ml per litre of water (or 200 - 300 ml per acre). Effective against whitefly nymphs and adults, and also mites.
    *   **Diafenthiuron 50% WP:** Apply at 0.6 - 1.0 g per litre of water (or 250 - 300 g per acre). Effective against whiteflies, thrips, and mites.
    *   **Pyriproxyfen 10% EC:** Apply at 1.0 - 1.25 ml per litre of water (or 400 - 500 ml per acre). Another IGR effective against whitefly nymphs.

*   **For Thrips and Leafhoppers:**
    *   **Fipronil 5% SC:** Apply at 1.0 - 1.5 ml per litre of water (or 400 - 600 ml per acre).
    *   **Flonicamid 50% WG:** Apply at 0.3 - 0.4 g per litre of water (or 120 - 160 g per acre). Primarily effective against aphids, but also has activity against some other sucking pests.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Rotation:** Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.
*   **Spray Volume:** Ensure adequate spray volume (typically 200-400 litres per acre depending on crop canopy) for thorough coverage.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying.
*   **Product Label:** Always read and strictly follow the instructions, dosage, and pre-harvest interval (PHI) mentioned on the product label.
*   **Local Advice:** For specific recommendations tailored to your local conditions and current pest pressure, consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts.
