As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies in Indian Squash (Tinda) in Haryana.

### Control of Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies in Indian Squash (Tinda)

**1. Sawflies:**
This is not known to affect Indian Squash (Tinda). Sawflies are primarily pests of cruciferous crops and are not reported as significant pests of cucurbits like Tinda in Haryana.

**2. Weevils:**
This is not known to significantly affect Indian Squash (Tinda). While some generalist weevils might occasionally be observed, there are no specific or major weevil pests that cause economic damage to Tinda in our region.

**3. Beetles:**
Beetles, particularly the Red Pumpkin Beetle (*Aulacophora foveicollis*) and sometimes Epilachna beetles (e.g., *Henosepilachna vigintioctopunctata*), are significant pests of Indian Squash (Tinda) in Haryana.

*   **Red Pumpkin Beetle:** Both adult beetles and their grubs cause damage. Adults feed voraciously on young leaves, flowers, and tender fruits, often skeletonizing leaves. Grubs feed on the roots and underground stems, which can lead to wilting and death of young plants.
*   **Epilachna Beetles (Spotted Leaf Beetles):** Both adults and grubs feed on the leaves, scraping the green matter and leaving behind characteristic window-pane-like damage.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Beetles:**

An integrated approach combining cultural, mechanical, and chemical methods is recommended for effective and sustainable control.

**A. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**

*   **Early Sowing:** Sowing Tinda early can help plants establish and grow vigorously before the peak incidence of Red Pumpkin Beetle.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy crop residues and weeds that can harbor pests.
*   **Hand Picking:** Regularly inspect plants, especially young ones, and hand-pick adult beetles and grubs. Drop them into a bucket of soapy water for destruction. This is particularly effective in small plots.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** After harvest, deep ploughing helps expose and destroy pupae of the Red Pumpkin Beetle in the soil.
*   **Ash Application:** Dusting plants with wood ash or a mixture of ash and neem cake can act as a repellent, especially for young plants.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting Tinda or other cucurbits in the same field year after year to break the pest cycle.

**B. Chemical Control (When pest incidence is high and causing economic damage):**

When beetle populations are high, and cultural methods are insufficient, judicious use of CIBRC-approved insecticides is necessary. Always follow label instructions, wear protective gear, and observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI).

*   **For Foliar Feeding Adult Beetles (Red Pumpkin Beetle, Epilachna Beetles):**
    *   **Malathion** 50% EC: Apply at a rate of 1.0-1.5 ml per liter of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: Apply at a rate of 0.5 ml per liter of water.
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: Apply at a rate of 0.3-0.5 ml per liter of water. (Effective against early stages and also provides control for sucking pests).
    *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: Apply at a rate of 0.2 g per liter of water. (Similar to Imidacloprid, systemic action).

*   **For Soil-Dwelling Grubs (Red Pumpkin Beetle, if severe damage to roots/stems is observed):**
    *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: Apply as a drench around the base of the plants at a rate of 2.5 ml per liter of water. Ensure proper soil moisture for better efficacy.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always check the label for the recommended PHI to ensure the safety of the produce.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and application of insecticides.
*   **Environmental Impact:** Apply insecticides responsibly to minimize harm to beneficial insects and the environment.
