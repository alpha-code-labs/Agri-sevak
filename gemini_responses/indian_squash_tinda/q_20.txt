As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide scientifically verified advice on addressing micronutrient deficiencies in Indian Squash (Tinda) for the Haryana region.

It is crucial to first confirm any suspected deficiency through **soil testing** and/or **plant tissue analysis**. Visual symptoms can be indicative, but accurate diagnosis ensures the correct nutrient is applied at the appropriate rate, preventing over-application which can lead to toxicity.

**General Recommendations for Prevention:**
*   Maintain optimal soil pH (6.0-7.0 is generally ideal for most micronutrients).
*   Incorporate organic matter (Farm Yard Manure, compost) regularly, as it improves soil structure and micronutrient availability.
*   Ensure balanced primary and secondary nutrient application.

**Addressing Specific Micronutrient Deficiencies in Indian Squash (Tinda):**

### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted plant growth, small and narrow leaves (often called "little leaf"), interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, sometimes with purplish discoloration.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 2-3 times at 10-15 day intervals, preferably in the morning or late evening.
        *   **Zinc sulfate heptahydrate** (21% Zn) @ 2.5-5 g/L water
        *   OR **Zinc EDTA** (12% Zn) @ 0.5-1 g/L water
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply before sowing or at early growth stages.
        *   **Zinc sulfate heptahydrate** @ 10-25 kg/acre (typically once every 2-3 years, depending on soil test results).

### 2. Iron (Fe) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Pronounced interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, with veins remaining distinctly green. In severe cases, entire leaves may turn pale yellow or almost white. Common in alkaline soils (high pH) prevalent in parts of Haryana.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 2-3 times at 7-10 day intervals.
        *   **Ferrous sulfate heptahydrate** (19% Fe) @ 5 g/L water
        *   OR **Iron EDTA** (13% Fe) @ 1-2 g/L water (more effective in alkaline soils)
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   **Ferrous sulfate heptahydrate** @ 10-20 kg/acre (less effective in high pH soils).
        *   **Iron EDTA** @ 2-5 kg/acre (for severe cases in alkaline soils).

### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, thickening and brittleness of young leaves, death of growing points, cracking of stems and petioles, poor fruit set, deformed or malformed fruits, and internal browning of fruit tissue.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 1-2 times at 15-day intervals.
        *   **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (20% B) @ 1-1.5 g/L water
        *   OR **Borax (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate)** (11% B) @ 2-3 g/L water
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply before sowing.
        *   **Borax (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate)** @ 2-4 kg/acre.
        *   **Caution:** Boron has a narrow range between deficiency and toxicity. Apply strictly based on soil test recommendations.

### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Affects new growth and meristematic tissues. Young leaves may be distorted, stunted, or show necrosis at the tips and margins. Poor root development, and in fruits, it can lead to blossom end rot (though less common in Tinda than in other cucurbits like watermelon or muskmelon, it can occur under severe stress).
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 2-3 times at 10-15 day intervals, especially during fruit development.
        *   **Calcium chloride** (27% Ca) @ 5 g/L water
        *   OR **Calcium nitrate** (19% Ca) @ 5-10 g/L water
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   **Gypsum (Calcium sulfate dihydrate)** @ 200-500 kg/acre (as a soil amendment, also provides Ca).
        *   **Calcium nitrate** @ 10-20 kg/acre.

### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, starting from the leaf margins and progressing inwards, often leaving a characteristic "Christmas tree" pattern with green veins. Leaves may become brittle and eventually necrotic.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 2-3 times at 10-15 day intervals.
        *   **Magnesium sulfate heptahydrate** (9.8% Mg) @ 5-10 g/L water
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   **Magnesium sulfate heptahydrate** @ 10-20 kg/acre.

### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, similar to iron deficiency but often less severe and sometimes accompanied by small necrotic spots. Veins remain green. Stunted growth.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 2-3 times at 10-15 day intervals.
        *   **Manganese sulfate monohydrate** (30.5% Mn) @ 2.5-5 g/L water
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   **Manganese sulfate monohydrate** @ 5-10 kg/acre.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Wetting Agent:** Always add a non-ionic wetting agent (0.5 ml/L) to foliar sprays to improve coverage and absorption.
*   **Timing of Spray:** Apply foliar sprays during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to prevent leaf scorch and maximize absorption.
*   **Compatibility:** Do not mix micronutrient solutions with incompatible pesticides or other fertilizers without checking compatibility.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management:** For long-term soil health and nutrient availability, integrate chemical fertilizers with organic manures and follow crop rotation practices.
