Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice regarding dropping issues in Indian Squash (Tinda).

Firstly, it is important to clarify that "Boll dropping" is a term specifically associated with cotton plants and **this is not known to affect Indian Squash (Tinda)**. However, flower drop and fruit drop are common physiological issues in Tinda and other cucurbits.

**Understanding Flower and Fruit Drop in Indian Squash (Tinda):**

Flower and fruit drop in Tinda can be attributed to several factors, primarily physiological and environmental stresses. These include:

1.  **Environmental Stress:**
    *   **Temperature Extremes:** High temperatures (above 35°C) or low temperatures (below 15°C) during flowering can impair pollen viability and fertilization, leading to flower abortion.
    *   **Moisture Stress:** Both drought conditions (insufficient water) and waterlogging (excessive water) can stress the plant, causing it to shed flowers and young fruits.
    *   **Humidity:** Very low or very high humidity can affect pollination and fruit set.
    *   **Strong Winds:** Can physically damage flowers and young fruits.
2.  **Nutritional Deficiencies:**
    *   Lack of essential micronutrients like Boron and Calcium, which are crucial for pollen germination, fertilization, and cell wall development.
    *   Imbalance of major nutrients (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium).
3.  **Poor Pollination:**
    *   Insufficient number of pollinators (e.g., bees) due to pesticide use or lack of pollinator-friendly environment.
    *   Poor pollen viability due to environmental stress.
    *   Asynchronous flowering of male and female flowers.
4.  **Hormonal Imbalance:**
    *   An imbalance of plant hormones (auxins, gibberellins, cytokinins) can lead to abscission (shedding) of flowers and young fruits.
5.  **Pest and Disease:**
    *   While less common as a direct cause of dropping, severe infestations or infections can weaken the plant, indirectly leading to flower/fruit drop.

**Control Measures for Flower and Fruit Drop in Indian Squash (Tinda):**

To effectively manage flower and fruit drop, a combination of cultural practices, nutritional management, and judicious use of plant growth regulators is recommended.

**A. Cultural Practices:**

*   **Optimal Irrigation:** Maintain consistent soil moisture. Irrigate regularly, especially during flowering and fruit development. Avoid both water scarcity and waterlogging. Drip irrigation is highly recommended for efficient water use.
*   **Weed Management:** Keep the field free of weeds, as they compete for water and nutrients.
*   **Pollinator Protection:** Avoid spraying insecticides during the flowering period, especially in the morning when pollinators are most active. Consider planting pollinator-attracting plants nearby.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to allow for good air circulation and light penetration, reducing stress.

**B. Nutritional Management:**

*   **Soil Testing:** Conduct regular soil tests to determine nutrient status and apply fertilizers accordingly.
*   **Balanced Fertilization:** Ensure a balanced supply of macro and micronutrients.
*   **Foliar Application of Micronutrients:**
    *   **Boron:** If Boron deficiency is suspected or confirmed, apply **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (20% Boron) at 0.5-1 g/L of water as a foliar spray during pre-flowering and early fruit set stages.
    *   **Calcium:** If Calcium deficiency is suspected, apply **Calcium nitrate** (19% Calcium) at 2-4 g/L of water as a foliar spray during flowering and fruit development.

**C. Chemical Interventions (Plant Growth Regulators - PGRs):**

These should be used judiciously and as per recommended dosages.

*   **For Flower and Fruit Drop Prevention:**
    *   **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA):** Apply **Naphthalene Acetic Acid** (4.5% SL formulation) at a concentration of 0.2-0.4 ml/L of water (equivalent to 9-18 ppm) as a foliar spray. The first spray can be given at the initiation of flowering, and a second spray 10-15 days later, if needed. This helps in preventing abscission and promoting fruit set.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read the label instructions of any chemical product before use.
*   Ensure thorough coverage of the plant during foliar sprays.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions.

By implementing these measures, you can significantly reduce flower and fruit drop and improve the yield of your Indian Squash (Tinda) crop.
