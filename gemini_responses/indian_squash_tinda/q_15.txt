As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in Indian Squash (Tinda) in Haryana:

Here's how to manage the mentioned pests:

### 1. Grasshopper

Grasshoppers are polyphagous pests that can cause significant damage by feeding on leaves and young shoots of Indian Squash (Tinda).

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Keep the field free of weeds, as they serve as alternate hosts and breeding sites.
    *   Deep ploughing during the off-season can expose and destroy grasshopper egg pods in the soil.
*   **Chemical Control (Apply when nymphs are young and active):**
    *   **Malathion 50% EC:** Apply at 1.0 - 1.5 Litres per acre, mixed in 200-400 Litres of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** Apply at 200-250 ml per acre, mixed in 200-400 Litres of water.
    *   **Cypermethrin 25% EC:** Apply at 200-250 ml per acre, mixed in 200-400 Litres of water.

### 2. Painted bug

This is not known to affect Indian Squash (Tinda). Painted bug (Bagrada hilaris) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops like mustard, cabbage, and cauliflower.

### 3. Red cotton bug

This is not known to affect Indian Squash (Tinda). Red cotton bug (Dysdercus cingulatus) is primarily a pest of cotton and other malvaceous plants.

### 4. Black ants

Black ants are generally not direct pests of Indian Squash (Tinda) plants themselves. Their presence often indicates the presence of other sap-sucking pests (like aphids or mealybugs) which excrete honeydew, attracting ants. However, if they are directly damaging seeds, seedlings, or roots, or are a significant nuisance, control measures can be considered.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Maintain good field sanitation and remove any debris or weeds that might provide shelter for ant colonies.
    *   If ants are tending to other sap-sucking pests, controlling the primary pest will often reduce ant populations.
*   **Chemical Control (Targeted application around ant trails or nests):**
    *   **Fipronil 0.3% GR:** Apply at 5-10 kg per acre, broadcast or applied near ant nests and trails.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** As a spot treatment or drench around the base of affected plants or ant trails, apply at 200-250 ml per acre, mixed in 200-400 Litres of water.
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** As a drench around the base of plants or ant-infested areas, apply at 100-125 ml per acre, mixed in 200-400 Litres of water.
