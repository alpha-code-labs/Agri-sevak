Namaste, Kisan bhaiyon! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm that Scale insects and Mealybugs are significant sucking pests that can affect Indian Squash (Tinda) cultivation in Haryana. They feed on plant sap, leading to yellowing, wilting, stunted growth, and reduced yield. They also excrete honeydew, which promotes the growth of sooty mold, further hindering photosynthesis.

Effective management requires an integrated approach.

**General Management Practices:**

1.  **Regular Scouting:** Regularly inspect your Tinda plants, especially the undersides of leaves, stems, and fruit calyx, for early signs of infestation.
2.  **Pruning and Sanitation:** Remove and destroy heavily infested plant parts (leaves, stems, fruits) to reduce pest populations. Keep the field free of weeds, which can act as alternate hosts.
3.  **High-Pressure Water Spray:** For small infestations, a strong jet of water can dislodge mealybugs and scales from the plants.
4.  **Biological Control:** Encourage natural enemies like ladybird beetles, lacewings, and parasitic wasps, which prey on these pests. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm beneficial insects.

**Chemical Control:**

When infestations are severe and general practices are insufficient, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and in protected areas where these pests tend to hide. Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

Here are some CIBRC-approved technical chemical names effective against Scale insects and Mealybugs in cucurbits, along with their recommended dosages:

*   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at a rate of **1.25 - 1.5 ml per litre of water** or **250 - 300 ml per acre**. This is an insect growth regulator, effective against nymphs.
*   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at a rate of **0.5 - 0.75 ml per litre of water** or **125 - 150 ml per acre**. This is a systemic insecticide effective against a wide range of sucking pests.
*   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at a rate of **0.25 - 0.5 g per litre of water** or **100 - 125 g per acre**. Another systemic insecticide with good efficacy against sucking pests.
*   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:** Apply at a rate of **0.75 - 1 ml per litre of water** or **150 - 200 ml per acre**. This is a systemic insecticide that moves both upwards and downwards in the plant, providing excellent control of hidden pests.
*   **Dimethoate 30% EC:** Apply at a rate of **1.5 - 2 ml per litre of water** or **500 ml per acre**. This is a contact and systemic insecticide, effective against various sucking pests.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label carefully, including the pre-harvest interval (PHI) to ensure the safety of the produce.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying.
*   Spray during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions.
