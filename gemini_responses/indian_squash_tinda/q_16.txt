Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified fertilizer schedule for Indian Squash (Tinda) cultivation in Haryana. Please note that these are general recommendations for average soil fertility. For precise nutrient management, a soil test is highly recommended.

**General Nutrient Requirement for Indian Squash (Tinda):**
*   Nitrogen (N): 60-80 kg/acre
*   Phosphorus (P2O5): 40-60 kg/acre
*   Potassium (K2O): 40-60 kg/acre
*   Sulphur (S): 20-25 kg/acre

**Recommended Fertilizer Doses and Application Schedule:**

**1. Basal Application (at the time of field preparation/sowing):**
Apply these fertilizers and mix them well into the soil before sowing or transplanting.

*   **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP):** 85-130 kg/acre (This will provide 40-60 kg P2O5 and 15-23 kg N).
*   **Muriate of Potash (MOP):** 65-100 kg/acre (This will provide 40-60 kg K2O).
*   **Bentonite Sulphur (90% S):** 20-25 kg/acre (If your soil test indicates Sulphur deficiency or if you are not using Single Super Phosphate).
    *   *Alternatively, if using Single Super Phosphate (SSP) for Phosphorus and Sulphur:*
        *   **Single Super Phosphate (SSP):** 250-375 kg/acre (This will provide 40-60 kg P2O5 and 27.5-41 kg S). If using SSP, reduce the DAP quantity accordingly and ensure the total N, P, K, S requirements are met.

**2. Top Dressing (Split Application for Nitrogen):**
The remaining Nitrogen should be applied in two split doses to ensure continuous nutrient availability during critical growth stages.

*   **First Top Dressing (3-4 weeks after sowing, at active vegetative growth):**
    *   **Urea:** 50-70 kg/acre
*   **Second Top Dressing (at flowering/early fruit set stage):**
    *   **Urea:** 50-70 kg/acre

**3. Foliar Applications (as supplements):**
Nano-fertilizers are excellent for foliar application, providing quick nutrient uptake and supplementing soil-applied fertilizers.

*   **Nano-Urea:** 2-4 ml/L of water. Apply at 3-4 weeks after sowing and again at the flowering/fruit set stage.
*   **Nano-DAP:** 2-4 ml/L of water. Apply at the pre-flowering stage (around 4-5 weeks after sowing) to boost flowering and fruit development.

**4. NPK Compound Fertilizers:**
If your soil test specifically recommends a balanced NPK fertilizer, you can use it as a basal dose. However, it is generally more precise to manage individual nutrients as outlined above.
*   For example, if using **NPK (12:32:16)**: 125-185 kg/acre can be applied as a basal dose to provide 15-22 kg N, 40-60 kg P2O5, and 20-30 kg K2O. You would then need to supplement with additional **Urea** and **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** to meet the full N and K requirements.

Always ensure proper irrigation after fertilizer application, especially for basal doses and top dressings, to facilitate nutrient dissolution and uptake by the plants.
