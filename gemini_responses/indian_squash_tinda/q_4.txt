Wilt, including Parawilt, is a significant concern in Indian Squash (Tinda) cultivation in Haryana, often leading to considerable yield losses. An integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods is recommended for effective management.

**Integrated Disease Management for Wilt (including Parawilt) in Indian Squash (Tinda):**

**A. Cultural Practices:**

1.  **Crop Rotation:** Practice a 3-4 year crop rotation with non-cucurbit crops to reduce the build-up of soil-borne pathogens.
2.  **Resistant Varieties:** Where available, select and cultivate Tinda varieties known for their resistance or tolerance to wilt diseases.
3.  **Healthy Seeds:** Always use healthy, certified, disease-free seeds.
4.  **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds before sowing to protect against early seedling infection.
5.  **Soil Solarization:** During the hot summer months (May-June), cover the prepared field with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks. This helps in reducing soil-borne pathogen inoculum.
6.  **Proper Drainage and Raised Beds:** Ensure good field drainage to prevent waterlogging, which can stress roots and favor root rot pathogens. Planting on raised beds can be beneficial.
7.  **Avoid Root Injury:** Be careful during intercultural operations (weeding, hoeing) to avoid damaging the plant roots, as root injuries provide entry points for pathogens and can predispose plants to parawilt.
8.  **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced fertilization to maintain plant vigor and enhance natural resistance. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can make plants more susceptible.
9.  **Irrigation Management:** Maintain optimal soil moisture. Both water deficit and waterlogging can induce stress leading to parawilt symptoms. Irrigate judiciously, especially during critical growth stages.
10. **Field Sanitation:** Promptly remove and destroy infected plants showing wilt symptoms to prevent the spread of the disease.
11. **Nematode Management:** Manage plant-parasitic nematodes, as root damage caused by nematodes can predispose plants to wilt diseases and exacerbate parawilt symptoms.

**B. Biological Control:**

1.  **Seed Treatment:**
    *   Treat seeds with *Trichoderma viride* or *Trichoderma harzianum* @ 4-6 g/kg seed.
    *   Treat seeds with *Pseudomonas fluorescens* @ 10 g/kg seed.
2.  **Soil Application/Drenching:**
    *   Apply *Trichoderma viride* or *Trichoderma harzianum* @ 2.5 kg/acre mixed with 50 kg farmyard manure (FYM) or compost, and apply to the soil before planting or drench around the root zone of established plants.
    *   Apply *Pseudomonas fluorescens* @ 2.5 kg/acre mixed with 50 kg FYM or compost, and apply to the soil.

**C. Chemical Control (Use only CIBRC approved technical chemical names):**

**1. Seed Treatment (for prevention of early infection):**
    *   **Carbendazim** 12% + **Mancozeb** 63% WP @ 2-3 g/kg seed.
    *   **Metalaxyl-M** 31.8% ES @ 3 ml/kg seed (especially effective against Oomycete pathogens like *Pythium*).

**2. Soil Drenching (at the first sign of wilting):**
    *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP @ 1-2 g/L water. Drench 100-200 ml solution per plant around the root zone.
    *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride** 72.2% SL @ 2-3 ml/L water. Drench around the base of affected plants.
    *   **Metalaxyl-M** 4% + **Mancozeb** 64% WP @ 2-2.5 g/L water. Drench around the root zone.
    *   **Fosetyl-aluminium** 80% WP @ 2.5 g/L water. Drench around the base of affected plants.

It is crucial to adopt an integrated approach for sustainable and effective management of wilt and parawilt in Indian Squash (Tinda). Regular field monitoring is essential to detect symptoms early and initiate timely control measures.
