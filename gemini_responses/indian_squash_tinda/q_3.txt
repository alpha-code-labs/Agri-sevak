As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling various rot types in Indian Squash (Tinda) in Haryana.

Effective management of rot diseases in Tinda requires an integrated approach combining cultural practices, biological controls, and judicious use of CIBRC-approved chemical fungicides.

### 1. Root Rot, Stem Rot, Foot Rot, Collar Rot, Crown Rot
*(Caused by pathogens such as *Pythium* spp., *Phytophthora* spp., *Fusarium* spp., *Sclerotium rolfsii*, and *Rhizoctonia solani*)*

These diseases often manifest similarly, affecting the plant at or below the soil line, leading to wilting, yellowing, and eventual plant death.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Ensure excellent field drainage to prevent waterlogging, which favors rot pathogens.
    *   Practice crop rotation with non-cucurbit crops for at least 2-3 years.
    *   Avoid planting in fields with a history of severe rot diseases.
    *   Maintain proper plant spacing to improve air circulation around the plant base.
    *   Remove and destroy infected plant debris promptly to reduce inoculum.
    *   Solarize soil during hot summer months to reduce pathogen load.
    *   Avoid deep planting of seedlings.

*   **Biological Control:**
    *   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds with *Trichoderma viride* or *Trichoderma harzianum* (4-6 g/kg seed) or *Pseudomonas fluorescens* (10 g/kg seed).
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply *Trichoderma viride* or *Trichoderma harzianum* (2.5 kg/acre mixed with 50 kg well-decomposed farmyard manure) at the time of planting or transplanting.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Seed Treatment (Preventive):**
        *   **Thiram** (2-3 g/kg seed)
        *   **Captan** (2-3 g/kg seed)
        *   **Metalaxyl-M** (3-6 g/kg seed, often in combination with other fungicides)
    *   **Drenching/Foliar Application (for established plants, at first sign of disease):**
        *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride** (2-3 ml/L water for drenching)
        *   **Metalaxyl-M** (0.5-1 g/L water for drenching or foliar spray, often in combination with Mancozeb)
        *   **Fosetyl-aluminium** (2-3 g/L water for drenching or foliar spray)
        *   **Copper oxychloride** (2-3 g/L water for drenching)
        *   **Validamycin** (2-3 ml/L water for drenching, particularly effective against *Rhizoctonia* and *Sclerotium*)
        *   **Carbendazim** (1-1.5 g/L water for drenching)
        *   **Thiophanate-methyl** (1-1.5 g/L water for drenching)

### 2. Neck Rot
This is not known to affect Indian Squash (Tinda).

### 3. Black Rot (Gummy Stem Blight)
*(Caused by *Didymella bryoniae*)*

This disease affects leaves, stems, and fruits, causing dark, water-soaked lesions, often with gummy exudates on stems.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Use disease-free, certified seeds.
    *   Practice crop rotation with non-cucurbit crops.
    *   Remove and destroy infected plant parts and crop debris promptly.
    *   Avoid overhead irrigation, which can facilitate spore dispersal.
    *   Ensure good air circulation within the plant canopy.

*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray, at first sign of disease):**
    *   **Azoxystrobin** (0.5-1 ml/L water)
    *   **Pyraclostrobin** (0.5-1 ml/L water, often in combination with Metiram)
    *   **Tebuconazole** (0.5-1 ml/L water)
    *   **Difenoconazole** (0.5 ml/L water)
    *   **Mancozeb** (2-2.5 g/L water)
    *   **Chlorothalonil** (2 g/L water)

### 4. Fruit Rot
*(Caused by various pathogens including *Phytophthora* spp., *Pythium* spp., *Didymella bryoniae*, *Colletotrichum* spp.)*

Rotting of fruits can occur at any stage, often starting from contact with wet soil or through wounds.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Prevent fruits from direct contact with wet soil by using mulching (e.g., straw, plastic mulch).
    *   Harvest fruits carefully to avoid injury, which can create entry points for pathogens.
    *   Remove and destroy diseased fruits immediately to prevent spread.
    *   Ensure good field sanitation.

*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray, as a preventive measure or at first sign):**
    *   The fungicides recommended for Root/Stem/Collar Rot and Black Rot will also help in managing fruit rots if applied systemically or protectively.
    *   **Mancozeb** (2-2.5 g/L water)
    *   **Copper oxychloride** (2-3 g/L water)
    *   **Azoxystrobin** (0.5-1 ml/L water)

### 5. Seed Rot and Seedling Rot (Damping-off)
*(Caused by *Pythium* spp., *Phytophthora* spp., *Rhizoctonia solani*, *Fusarium* spp.)*

Seed rot prevents germination, while seedling rot causes young seedlings to collapse at or below the soil line.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Use healthy, certified, disease-free seeds.
    *   Plant seeds at the correct depth and spacing.
    *   Ensure well-drained soil or nursery media.
    *   Avoid overwatering, especially immediately after sowing.
    *   Sterilize nursery media (e.g., by solarization or steaming) before use.
    *   Maintain optimal soil temperature for quick germination.

*   **Biological Control:**
    *   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds with *Trichoderma viride* or *Trichoderma harzianum* (4-6 g/kg seed) or *Pseudomonas fluorescens* (10 g/kg seed).
    *   **Nursery Media Application:** Incorporate *Trichoderma viride* or *Trichoderma harzianum* into nursery media.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Seed Treatment (most effective for prevention):**
        *   **Thiram** (2-3 g/kg seed)
        *   **Captan** (2-3 g/kg seed)
        *   **Metalaxyl-M** (3-6 g/kg seed, often in combination with other fungicides)
        *   **Carbendazim** (1-2 g/kg seed)
    *   **Drenching (if damping-off appears in nursery):**
        *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride** (2-3 ml/L water)
        *   **Metalaxyl-M** (0.5-1 g/L water)
        *   **Validamycin** (2-3 ml/L water)

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and strictly follow the label instructions for any chemical product regarding dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pathogen resistance.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension specialists for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and current disease pressure.
