As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), here are the recommended cultivation practices for Indian Squash (Tinda) in Haryana:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   Tinda is primarily sown directly in the field.
    *   It can be sown on flat beds, but for better drainage and irrigation management, sowing on ridges and furrows is highly recommended, especially in areas prone to waterlogging or for efficient drip irrigation.
    *   Seeds are typically sown in pits or directly along the ridges.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   Seeds should be sown at a depth of 2-3 cm. Deeper sowing can hinder germination.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   **Row-to-Row Spacing:** 1.5 - 2.5 meters
    *   **Plant-to-Plant Spacing:** 0.6 - 1.0 meter
    *   When sowing in pits, maintain a pit-to-pit distance of 1.5 - 2.5 meters, and sow 2-3 seeds per pit, thinning to 1-2 healthy plants after establishment.

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   An average seed rate of 1.5 - 2.5 kg per acre is recommended, depending on seed size and germination percentage.
