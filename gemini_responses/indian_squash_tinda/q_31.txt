As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling physical damage in Indian Squash (Tinda) in Haryana:

### 1. Fruit Bursting (Cracking)

Fruit bursting in Tinda is primarily a physiological disorder caused by sudden fluctuations in soil moisture, leading to rapid water uptake and internal pressure that the fruit skin cannot withstand. Calcium deficiency can also exacerbate this condition.

**Causes:**
*   Irregular watering: A dry spell followed by heavy irrigation or rainfall.
*   Rapid growth due to excessive nitrogen fertilization.
*   Calcium deficiency in the fruit.

**Control Measures:**
*   **Consistent Soil Moisture:** Maintain uniform soil moisture throughout the fruit development stage. Avoid extremes of drought and waterlogging. Use drip irrigation if possible for precise water delivery.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure adequate and balanced nutrient supply, particularly calcium.
    *   For soil application, incorporate calcium-rich amendments if soil tests indicate deficiency.
    *   For foliar application during fruit development:
        *   **Calcium nitrate** (0.5-1.0% solution, i.e., 5-10 g/L water)
        *   **Calcium chloride** (0.2-0.4% solution, i.e., 2-4 g/L water)
    *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals starting from fruit set.
*   **Proper Drainage:** Ensure good soil drainage to prevent waterlogging.
*   **Variety Selection:** While management is key, some varieties may exhibit better resistance to cracking.

### 2. Leaf Burning/Melting

Leaf burning (scorching) and severe tissue collapse ("melting") are typically symptoms of extreme environmental stress, particularly high temperatures and intense solar radiation, often coupled with water stress.

**Causes:**
*   **High Temperatures and Intense Sunlight:** Direct exposure to scorching sun during peak summer months in Haryana can cause leaf tissue to burn and desiccate.
*   **Water Stress:** Insufficient water supply makes plants more susceptible to heat stress and sunscald.
*   **Nutrient Imbalance/Toxicity:** Excess salts or certain micronutrient toxicities (e.g., boron) can also cause leaf burn, though less common as a primary cause of widespread "melting."

**Control Measures:**
*   **Adequate Irrigation:** Provide regular and sufficient irrigation, especially during hot and dry periods, to keep plants well-hydrated. Water early in the morning or late in the evening to minimize evaporation.
*   **Shade Management:** In areas with extremely high temperatures (above 40°C) and intense sunlight, consider using shade nets (e.g., 30-50% shade) over the crop during the hottest part of the day.
*   **Mulching:** Apply organic mulch (straw, dry leaves) around the base of plants to conserve soil moisture, regulate soil temperature, and reduce heat reflection onto lower leaves.
*   **Planting Density:** Ensure appropriate plant spacing to allow for good air circulation while providing some self-shading.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Follow soil test recommendations for balanced fertilization to avoid nutrient toxicities.

### 3. Hardness in Fruit

Hardness in Tinda fruit is almost exclusively a result of over-maturity. Tinda is prized for its tender texture and mild flavor when harvested young.

**Causes:**
*   **Over-maturity:** Leaving the fruit on the vine for too long allows the seeds to fully develop and the skin to harden and thicken.

**Control Measures:**
*   **Timely Harvesting:** Harvest Tinda fruits when they are young, tender, and typically 5-8 cm in diameter, with a bright green, smooth skin. At this stage, the seeds are undeveloped and soft.
*   **Frequent Harvesting:** Harvest regularly (every 1-2 days during peak season) to encourage continuous fruit production and prevent fruits from becoming over-mature.
*   **Variety Selection:** Choose varieties known for good fruit quality and tenderness at the desired harvest stage.

No CIBRC approved technical chemicals are directly used to prevent or reverse hardness in fruit, as it is primarily a cultural and harvesting management issue.
