As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following for the ideal transplantation of Indian Squash (Tinda) in Haryana:

### Ideal Transplantation Time

*   **Spring-Summer Season:** The optimal time for transplanting Tinda in Haryana is from **February to March**. This allows the crop to establish before the peak summer heat and mature during favorable conditions.

### Ideal Transplantation Distance

*   **Row-to-Row:** Maintain a distance of **2.0 - 2.5 meters** between rows.
*   **Plant-to-Plant:** Maintain a distance of **0.6 - 0.9 meters** within the row.
    *   This spacing ensures adequate sunlight penetration, air circulation, and ease of cultural operations, leading to better yield and reduced disease incidence.

### Ideal Transplantation Process

1.  **Seedling Preparation:**
    *   Sow Tinda seeds in nursery trays or polybags filled with a well-drained potting mix approximately **3-4 weeks** before the intended transplanting date.
    *   Ensure seedlings have developed **2-4 true leaves** and a robust root system before transplanting.
    *   Harden off seedlings by gradually exposing them to outdoor conditions (reduced watering, increased sunlight) for about a week prior to transplanting to minimize transplant shock.

2.  **Field Preparation:**
    *   Prepare the field thoroughly by ploughing and harrowing to achieve a fine, friable tilth.
    *   Incorporate well-rotted farmyard manure (FYM) or compost at a rate of **20-25 tonnes per acre** during the final ploughing.
    *   Form ridges and furrows or raised beds according to your irrigation method.
    *   Pre-irrigate the field 1-2 days before transplanting to ensure adequate soil moisture.

3.  **Actual Transplanting:**
    *   Transplant seedlings in the **late afternoon or evening** to avoid the stress of direct sunlight and high temperatures, allowing them to recover overnight.
    *   Carefully remove seedlings from the nursery trays/polybags, ensuring the root ball remains intact.
    *   Dig a hole slightly larger than the root ball at the predetermined spacing.
    *   Place the seedling in the hole, ensuring the soil level around the stem is the same as it was in the nursery.
    *   Gently firm the soil around the base of the plant to remove air pockets.
    *   Immediately provide a light irrigation to settle the soil around the roots.

4.  **Post-Transplant Care:**
    *   Ensure consistent moisture in the soil, especially during the initial establishment phase, but avoid waterlogging.
    *   Monitor the transplanted seedlings closely for any signs of stress, pests, or diseases.
    *   Provide light irrigation every 2-3 days for the first week, depending on soil type and weather conditions, to aid establishment.
