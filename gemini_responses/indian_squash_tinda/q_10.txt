As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in Indian Squash (Tinda) in Haryana:

It is important to adopt an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods for sustainable pest control.

### 1. Borers

The primary borer affecting Indian Squash (Tinda) is the **Melon Fruit Fly** (*Bactrocera cucurbitae*), which bores into the developing fruits. Other caterpillars might occasionally cause stem or fruit boring.

**Management Strategies:**

*   **Cultural Methods:**
    *   Regular collection and destruction of infested and fallen fruits to break the pest life cycle.
    *   Deep ploughing after harvest to expose pupae.
    *   Use of fruit fly traps (e.g., methyl eugenol traps) at 4-5 traps per acre to monitor and mass trap male flies.
    *   Bagging of individual fruits with paper or cloth bags when they are small can protect them from fruit fly attack.
*   **Chemical Control (for Melon Fruit Fly and general borers):**
    *   **Bait Sprays:** Mix 100 g of jaggery or sugar with 10 ml of **Malathion 50% EC** in 10 litres of water. Apply this bait spray on leaves (not directly on fruits) in small patches, especially during morning hours.
    *   For severe infestations or other caterpillar borers:
        *   **Spinosad 45% SC** at 0.25-0.3 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC** at 0.15-0.2 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG** at 0.2-0.25 g per litre of water.

### 2. Caterpillars

Various caterpillar species can infest Indian Squash (Tinda), feeding on leaves, flowers, and sometimes fruits.

**Management Strategies:**

*   **Cultural Methods:**
    *   Regular monitoring of the crop for early detection of caterpillar damage.
    *   Hand-picking and destruction of visible larvae and egg masses in small areas.
    *   Removal of weeds which can act as alternate hosts.
*   **Biological Control:**
    *   Application of **Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)** formulations at 1-2 g per litre of water, especially effective against young larvae.
*   **Chemical Control (for various leaf-feeding and fruit-feeding caterpillars):**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC** at 0.15-0.2 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG** at 0.2-0.25 g per litre of water.
    *   **Flubendiamide 20% WG** at 0.2-0.3 g per litre of water.
    *   **Indoxacarb 14.5% SC** at 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Spinosad 45% SC** at 0.25-0.3 ml per litre of water.

### 3. Diamondback moth

This is not known to affect Indian Squash (Tinda).

### 4. Leaf folder

This is not known to affect Indian Squash (Tinda).

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully, including dosage, application method, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Rotate different classes of insecticides to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.
*   Ensure proper safety measures (gloves, mask, protective clothing) during pesticide application.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension officers for specific recommendations tailored to your farm conditions.
