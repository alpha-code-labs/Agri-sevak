As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), here are the scientifically verified recommendations for Growth Regulators/Hormones and Boron in Indian Squash (Tinda):

### Growth Regulators/Hormones and Boron for Indian Squash (Tinda)

**1. Ethephon**
*   **Purpose:** To promote the production of female flowers, which leads to an increased number of fruits and higher yield in cucurbits like Tinda.
*   **Recommended Dose:** Apply **Ethephon** (e.g., 39% SL formulation) at a concentration of **0.25 - 0.65 ml/L** of water.
*   **Timing:** The first spray should be given at the 2-4 true leaf stage of the plant. A second spray can be applied 7-10 days later if necessary, depending on the plant's response and desired flowering pattern.

**2. 2,4-D**
*   This is not known to affect Indian Squash (Tinda) as a recommended growth regulator. 2,4-D is primarily a herbicide, and its use as a growth regulator for cucurbits like Tinda is not recommended due to the high risk of phytotoxicity (plant damage) at even very low concentrations.

**3. Boron**
*   **Purpose:** Boron is an essential micronutrient crucial for pollen germination, fruit set, and overall plant development. Its deficiency can lead to poor fruit set, malformed fruits, and reduced yield.
*   **Recommended Dose:** Apply a foliar spray of **Boron** using a soluble source such as:
    *   **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (e.g., Solubor, containing ~20% Boron) at **0.5 - 1.0 g/L** of water.
    *   OR **Sodium tetraborate decahydrate** (e.g., Borax, containing ~11% Boron) at **1.0 - 2.0 g/L** of water.
*   **Timing:** The first spray should be applied at the pre-flowering stage. A second spray can be given during early fruit development to ensure adequate Boron availability throughout the critical reproductive phases.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always ensure thorough coverage of the plant foliage during spraying.
*   Use clean water for mixing.
*   Always read and follow the instructions and safety precautions on the product label.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension specialists for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions.
