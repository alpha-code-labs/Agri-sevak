As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified approach to address macro-nutrient deficiencies (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium/Potash) in Indian Squash (Tinda) in Haryana.

**Initial and Foremost Recommendation: Soil Testing**
Before applying any fertilizers, it is crucial to conduct a comprehensive soil test. This will accurately determine the existing nutrient levels in your soil and help tailor the exact fertilizer recommendations, preventing over-application and ensuring efficient nutrient use. The recommendations below are general guidelines for Tinda cultivation in Haryana, assuming moderate fertility.

**General Macronutrient Requirements for Indian Squash (Tinda) in Haryana (as a general guideline without soil test):**
*   **Nitrogen (N):** 60-80 kg per acre
*   **Phosphorus (P2O5):** 40-60 kg per acre
*   **Potassium (K2O):** 40-60 kg per acre

**Addressing Specific Macro-nutrient Deficiencies:**

**1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency**
*   **Symptoms:** General yellowing (chlorosis) of older leaves, starting from the tips and progressing inwards. Stunted plant growth, thin stems, and pale green foliage. Reduced fruit set and smaller fruits.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Basal Application:** Apply 1/3rd of the total recommended Nitrogen at the time of sowing.
    *   **Top Dressing:** Apply the remaining 2/3rd Nitrogen in two equal splits:
        *   First split: 30-40 days after sowing (at vegetative growth stage).
        *   Second split: At flowering/early fruit set stage.
    *   **Recommended Fertilizers and Rates (as per general guidelines):**
        *   For basal application: 40-50 kg **Urea** per acre (provides ~18-23 kg N) or use **Diammonium Phosphate** which also provides N.
        *   For top dressing (each split): 40-50 kg **Urea** per acre.
        *   Alternatively, **Calcium Ammonium Nitrate** can be used for top dressing at similar N rates.

**2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency**
*   **Symptoms:** Dark green or purplish discoloration of older leaves, especially on the undersides. Stunted growth, poor root development, delayed flowering and maturity, and reduced fruit yield. Leaves may appear stiff.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Basal Application:** Phosphorus is relatively immobile in the soil, so it is best applied as a basal dose and thoroughly incorporated into the soil before sowing.
    *   **Recommended Fertilizers and Rates (as per general guidelines):**
        *   87-130 kg **Diammonium Phosphate** per acre (provides 40-60 kg P2O5 and some N).
        *   Alternatively, 250-375 kg **Single Super Phosphate** per acre (provides 40-60 kg P2O5).

**3. Potassium (K) Deficiency (Potash)**
*   **Symptoms:** Yellowing and browning (scorching or necrosis) of leaf margins, particularly on older leaves. The affected areas may appear burnt. Weak stems, poor fruit development, reduced fruit size and quality, and increased susceptibility to diseases and lodging.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Basal Application:** Apply 1/2 of the total recommended Potassium at the time of sowing.
    *   **Top Dressing:** Apply the remaining 1/2 Potassium at the flowering/early fruit set stage.
    *   **Recommended Fertilizers and Rates (as per general guidelines):**
        *   For basal application: 35-50 kg **Potassium Chloride** per acre (provides ~20-30 kg K2O).
        *   For top dressing: 35-50 kg **Potassium Chloride** per acre.
        *   Alternatively, **Potassium Sulphate** can be used at similar K2O rates, especially in soils where sulfur is also deficient.

**Integrated Nutrient Management (INM):**
For sustainable and efficient nutrient management, it is advisable to integrate chemical fertilizers with organic manures such as well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost (10-15 tonnes per acre) and bio-fertilizers. Organic matter improves soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability, reducing reliance on chemical fertilizers over time.
