As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide scientifically verified advice to improve yield, grain quality (instead of fruit quality, as paddy produces grains), and storage life for Paddy (Dhan) in Haryana.

### Improving Yield in Paddy (Dhan)

To maximize paddy yield, focus on integrated management practices:

*   **Variety Selection:** Choose high-yielding, disease-resistant varieties recommended for Haryana, such as PR-126, PR-121, PR-114, or suitable Basmati varieties like Pusa Basmati 1509, Pusa Basmati 1121, Pusa Basmati 1718, depending on your specific agro-climatic zone and market demand.
*   **Timely Sowing/Transplanting:** Adhere to the recommended sowing/transplanting window (e.g., mid-June to mid-July for Kharif paddy) for optimal growth and yield.
*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Nitrogen (N):** Apply 120-150 kg of N per acre for high-yielding varieties. Apply in 3-4 splits: 1/4th at transplanting, 1/2 at active tillering, and 1/4th at panicle initiation. Use **Urea** as the source.
    *   **Phosphorus (P):** Apply 25 kg of P2O5 per acre as a basal dose at transplanting. Use **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** or **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)**.
    *   **Potassium (K):** Apply 25 kg of K2O per acre. Apply 1/2 as basal and 1/2 at panicle initiation. Use **Muriate of Potash (MOP)**.
    *   **Zinc (Zn):** Zinc deficiency is common in Haryana soils. Apply 10 kg of **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** per acre as a basal dose. If deficiency appears later, spray 0.5% **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** solution (500 g in 100 L water per acre) 2-3 times at weekly intervals.
    *   **Iron (Fe):** In alkaline soils, iron deficiency (chlorosis) can occur. Spray 0.5-1% **Ferrous sulphate** solution (500-1000 g in 100 L water per acre) 2-3 times at weekly intervals.
*   **Water Management:** Maintain shallow submergence (2-5 cm) during the active growth period. Practice Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD) after tillering to save water without compromising yield, ensuring the soil does not crack. Avoid water stress during critical stages like panicle initiation and grain filling.
*   **Weed Management:** Timely weed control is crucial.
    *   **Pre-emergence:** Apply **Pretilachlor** (0.5 kg a.i./acre) or **Pendimethalin** (1.0 kg a.i./acre) within 3-5 days after transplanting.
    *   **Post-emergence:** For grassy weeds, use **Bispyribac-sodium** (20-25 g a.i./acre) or **Fenoxaprop-p-ethyl** (50-60 g a.i./acre) at 15-25 days after transplanting. For broadleaf weeds and sedges, use **Ethoxysulfuron** (10-15 g a.i./acre).
*   **Pest and Disease Management:** Implement Integrated Pest and Disease Management (IPDM) strategies, including monitoring, cultural practices, and judicious use of CIBRC-approved pesticides when necessary, to prevent yield losses.

### Improving Grain Quality in Paddy (Dhan)

Grain quality encompasses physical appearance, milling quality, and nutritional value.

*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Adequate and balanced application of N, P, K, and micronutrients (especially Zn and Si) is vital. Potassium (K) helps in proper grain filling and reduces chalkiness. Silicon (Si) can improve grain hardness and reduce pest/disease incidence.
*   **Water Management:** Avoid severe water stress or excessive submergence during the grain filling stage, as both can lead to chalky grains and reduced milling recovery.
*   **Timely Harvesting:** Harvest the crop at physiological maturity, typically when 80-85% of the grains on the panicle are straw-coloured and hard. The optimal grain moisture content at harvest is usually 20-22%. Delayed harvesting can lead to grain shattering, cracking, discolouration, and increased chalkiness.
*   **Proper Drying:** Immediately after harvest, dry the paddy grains to a safe moisture level (12-14%) to prevent fungal growth, discolouration, and maintain milling quality. Avoid rapid drying under direct sun, which can cause grain cracking. Use shade drying or mechanical dryers with controlled temperature.

### Improving Storage Life for Paddy (Dhan)

Effective storage practices are essential to minimize post-harvest losses and maintain grain quality.

*   **Drying to Safe Moisture Content:** This is the most critical step. Paddy must be dried to 12-14% moisture content before storage. Grains with higher moisture content are highly susceptible to mould growth, insect infestation, and quality deterioration.
*   **Cleaning and Grading:** Remove all foreign matter (chaff, straw, weed seeds, dust), immature grains, and damaged grains before storage. Clean grains store better and longer.
*   **Proper Storage Structures:**
    *   Store grains in clean, dry, well-ventilated, rodent-proof, and insect-proof structures.
    *   Use improved traditional structures, metal bins, or Pusa bins for small to medium-scale storage.
    *   Ensure the storage floor is raised above ground level to prevent moisture absorption.
    *   Seal all cracks and crevices in the storage structure to prevent pest entry.
*   **Pest Management in Storage:**
    *   **Sanitation:** Thoroughly clean the storage area before introducing new grains. Remove old grain residues, dust, and debris.
    *   **Aeration:** Periodically aerate the stored grains, especially in bulk storage, to prevent moisture accumulation and hot spots.
    *   **Fumigation (if necessary):** For large-scale storage or severe infestations, fumigation can be done by trained personnel using CIBRC-approved fumigants like **Aluminium phosphide** tablets. This is a highly regulated process and should only be performed by certified professionals.
    *   **Prophylactic Treatment:** For empty godowns or storage bags, surface treatment with CIBRC-approved insecticides like **Malathion** (50% EC at 10 ml/L water) can be done, ensuring the treated surfaces are dry before grain storage. Direct mixing of chemicals with grains for small-scale storage is generally discouraged for food safety reasons; focus on physical methods.
*   **Regular Inspection:** Periodically inspect stored grains for signs of insect infestation, mould growth, or moisture ingress. Take immediate corrective action if any issues are detected.
*   **Temperature and Humidity Control:** Store grains in a cool and dry environment. High temperature and humidity accelerate grain deterioration and pest activity.
