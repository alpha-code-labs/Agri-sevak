Wild animals such as Nilgai (Blue Bull), Wild Boar, Monkeys, and various rodents and birds can cause significant damage to paddy fields in Haryana. Effective protection often requires a combination of the following methods:

1.  **Physical Barriers:**
    *   **Fencing:**
        *   **Barbed Wire Fencing:** Install multiple strands (5-7) of barbed wire around the field. Ensure the lowest strand is close to the ground (within 15-20 cm) to deter smaller animals, and subsequent strands are spaced appropriately to prevent larger animals from breaching.
        *   **Electric Fencing:** This is a highly effective deterrent for most wild animals. It delivers a non-lethal shock that discourages animals from entering. Installation must be done by trained personnel, adhering strictly to safety standards and local government regulations. Regular maintenance is crucial for its effectiveness.
        *   **Mesh Fencing:** For protection against smaller animals like rodents and monkeys, a sturdy mesh fence can be installed. However, it is generally more expensive and may require deeper installation to prevent burrowing.
    *   **Trenching:** Digging deep and wide trenches (e.g., 1 meter deep and 1 meter wide) around the field can deter Wild Boar from entering by making it difficult for them to cross.

2.  **Repellents (Non-Chemical):**
    *   **Visual Repellents:**
        *   **Scarecrows:** Place scarecrows in the field. Their effectiveness is temporary as animals habituate; therefore, frequently change their location and appearance.
        *   **Reflective Tapes/CDs:** Hang shiny, reflective tapes or old CDs that move with the wind. The flashing light and movement can deter birds and some animals.
    *   **Acoustic Repellents:**
        *   **Sound Devices:** Use devices that emit loud noises, firecrackers, or distress calls. Vary the type, intensity, and timing of sounds to prevent animals from habituating.
    *   **Olfactory Repellents:**
        *   **Strong-Smelling Substances:** Some farmers use substances with strong odors (e.g., human hair, certain types of dung, fermented products) placed strategically around the field. Their effectiveness is often localized and temporary.

3.  **Vigilance and Guarding:**
    *   **Human Presence:** Stationing guards or farmers in the fields, especially during critical growth stages (e.g., tillering to grain filling), is one of the most effective deterrents.
    *   **Community Vigilance:** Organize community-level guarding shifts and coordinated efforts among farmers in a village or cluster of villages to enhance protection and share the burden.

4.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Synchronized Sowing and Harvesting:** Encourage all farmers in a contiguous area to sow and harvest their paddy crops at roughly the same time. This reduces the period when isolated fields are vulnerable and dilutes the damage across a larger area.
    *   **Weed and Habitat Management:** Keep field bunds, irrigation channels, and surrounding areas free of weeds and dense vegetation. This reduces shelter and breeding grounds for rodents and other small wild animals.
    *   **Prompt Harvesting:** Harvest the crop as soon as it matures to minimize the period of vulnerability to animal damage.

**Note on Chemical Repellents:**
As per CIBRC guidelines, there are currently no CIBRC approved technical chemical names specifically for animal repellents (other than rodenticides for specific rodent pests) for direct application on paddy crops to deter large wild animals like Nilgai, Wild Boar, or Monkeys in India. Therefore, no chemical repellents can be recommended for this purpose.
