As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies in Paddy (Dhan) in Haryana:

It is crucial to conduct a soil test before planting to determine the exact nutrient status of your field. This allows for precise fertilizer application and prevents both deficiencies and excesses. However, if deficiencies are observed during the crop growth, the following corrective measures can be taken:

### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** General yellowing of older leaves, stunted growth, reduced tillering, and pale green appearance of the entire plant.

**Corrective Measures:**
Nitrogen is highly mobile in the plant and soil. Top-dressing with nitrogenous fertilizers is an effective way to correct deficiencies.

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Urea** at 25-30 kg per acre as a top-dressing. This can be done 2-3 weeks after transplanting or when deficiency symptoms are observed. Ensure the field has standing water or irrigate immediately after application to minimize volatilization losses.
    *   Alternatively, **Ammonium Sulfate** can be used at 50-60 kg per acre, especially in soils with high pH or where sulfur deficiency is also suspected.

### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Dark green or purplish discoloration of older leaves, stunted growth, poor root development, delayed maturity, and reduced tillering. Phosphorus deficiency is often less visually apparent than nitrogen or potassium deficiency.

**Corrective Measures:**
Phosphorus is relatively immobile in the soil, making post-planting correction less efficient than basal application. However, if a severe deficiency is observed, some measures can be taken.

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** at 25-30 kg per acre. This should be incorporated into the soil if possible, or applied when the soil is moist. Its effectiveness as a top-dressing is limited compared to basal application, but it can provide some relief.
    *   Alternatively, **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** can be applied at 75-90 kg per acre.

*   **Foliar Application (for quick, temporary relief):**
    *   For immediate, though temporary, relief, a foliar spray of water-soluble phosphorus fertilizer can be considered. However, CIBRC primarily lists soil-applied phosphatic fertilizers. If a suitable water-soluble grade is available, consult with your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations on concentration and frequency.

### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Yellowing and browning (scorching) of leaf tips and margins, particularly on older leaves. The affected leaves may appear flaccid, and the plant may show increased susceptibility to lodging and diseases.

**Corrective Measures:**
Potassium is moderately mobile in the soil and plant, making top-dressing an effective way to correct deficiencies.

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Muriate of Potash (Potassium Chloride)** at 25-30 kg per acre as a top-dressing. This can be applied along with nitrogen top-dressing or when deficiency symptoms are observed.
    *   Alternatively, **Sulfate of Potash (Potassium Sulfate)** can be used at 25-30 kg per acre, especially if sulfur deficiency is also a concern.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Soil Testing:** Always prioritize soil testing to understand the specific nutrient status of your field and apply fertilizers based on recommendations.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management (INM):** Combine chemical fertilizers with organic manures (Farm Yard Manure, compost, green manure) to improve soil health and nutrient availability.
*   **Timing:** The effectiveness of corrective measures depends heavily on the timing of application. Early detection and application yield better results.
*   **Water Management:** Proper water management is crucial for nutrient uptake in paddy. Ensure adequate moisture or standing water as required for the specific nutrient application.
