As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the suitable climate, soil type, and drainage requirements for Paddy (Dhan) cultivation in Haryana:

### Climate Requirements for Paddy (Dhan)

Paddy is a tropical to sub-tropical crop that thrives under specific climatic conditions:

*   **Temperature:**
    *   Requires high temperatures, ideally ranging from 20°C to 37°C for optimal growth.
    *   Minimum temperature for germination is around 10-12°C.
    *   Optimal temperature for flowering and grain filling is typically 22-25°C.
    *   Temperatures below 20°C or above 40°C can negatively impact yield.
*   **Rainfall and Humidity:**
    *   Requires abundant water and high humidity throughout its growth period.
    *   An average annual rainfall of 100-200 cm is ideal, though in Haryana, supplementary irrigation is crucial due to variable rainfall patterns.
    *   High relative humidity (above 70%) is beneficial.
*   **Sunshine:**
    *   Requires good sunshine, especially during the reproductive and grain-filling stages, for proper photosynthesis and grain development.

### Soil Type Requirements for Paddy (Dhan)

Paddy performs best in soils that have good water retention capacity and can be easily puddled:

*   **Ideal Soil Types:**
    *   **Clayey Loams, Clay, and Silty Clay Loams:** These soils are considered ideal due to their high water-holding capacity, which is essential for maintaining standing water in paddy fields. They also form a good hardpan upon puddling, reducing water percolation.
    *   **Alluvial Soils:** Predominant in Haryana, these soils are generally well-suited for paddy cultivation, provided they have sufficient clay content.
*   **Soil pH:**
    *   Paddy can tolerate a wide range of soil pH, but it generally thrives in slightly acidic to neutral soils (pH 5.5 to 7.0).
*   **Avoid:**
    *   Light sandy soils or very coarse-textured soils are generally unsuitable as they have poor water retention and high percolation rates, leading to significant water loss.

### Drainage Requirements for Paddy (Dhan)

Paddy is a semi-aquatic crop and has unique drainage requirements:

*   **Waterlogging Tolerance:**
    *   Paddy is well-adapted to waterlogged conditions and requires standing water (typically 5-10 cm depth) for most of its growth period, especially in lowland or irrigated cultivation systems. This standing water helps in weed suppression, nutrient availability, and temperature regulation.
*   **Controlled Drainage:**
    *   While standing water is crucial, *controlled* drainage is important at specific stages:
        *   **Establishment:** Careful water management is needed during seedling establishment to prevent submergence of young plants.
        *   **Mid-season Drainage (AWD - Alternate Wetting and Drying):** In some modern water-saving practices, fields are allowed to dry for a few days before re-flooding. This can improve root aeration and nutrient uptake, and save water, without significantly impacting yield.
        *   **Pre-Harvest Drainage:** Fields must be drained completely 10-15 days before harvest. This allows the soil to dry, facilitates mechanical harvesting, prevents lodging, and improves grain quality and uniformity.
*   **Excessive Waterlogging:**
    *   Deep waterlogging (water levels consistently above 20-30 cm) can be detrimental, especially to non-deepwater varieties, as it can submerge the plants, reduce tillering, and hinder photosynthesis.
