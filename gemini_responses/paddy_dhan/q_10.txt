As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in Paddy (Dhan) in Haryana:

It is crucial to adopt an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods for sustainable pest control. Always consult your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations based on the current pest situation in your area.

### Control Measures for Pests in Paddy (Dhan)

#### 1. Borers (Stem Borers)

Stem borers (e.g., Yellow Stem Borer) are major pests in paddy. Look for symptoms like 'dead hearts' in the vegetative stage and 'white ears' in the reproductive stage.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Remove and destroy stubbles after harvest.
    *   Avoid excessive nitrogenous fertilizers.
    *   Synchronized planting in the area.
    *   Flood fields periodically to drown larvae.
*   **Chemical Control (Apply at economic threshold level):**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 0.4% GR: 4 kg/acre (for early stage infestation)
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC: 60 ml/acre
    *   **Fipronil** 0.3% GR: 7.5-10 kg/acre
    *   **Fipronil** 5% SC: 400-600 ml/acre
    *   **Cartap hydrochloride** 4% GR: 10 kg/acre
    *   **Cartap hydrochloride** 50% SP: 400 g/acre
    *   **Thiamethoxam + Chlorantraniliprole** 12.6% + 6.3% ZC: 80 ml/acre
    *   **Flubendiamide** 20% WG: 50 g/acre
    *   **Acephate** 75% SP: 600 g/acre

#### 2. Caterpillars (General Defoliators)

This refers to various defoliating caterpillars that might feed on paddy leaves, distinct from leaf folders or stem borers.

*   **Chemical Control (Apply at economic threshold level):**
    *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG: 80 g/acre
    *   **Indoxacarb** 14.5% SC: 200 ml/acre
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC: 60 ml/acre
    *   **Flubendiamide** 20% WG: 50 g/acre
    *   **Acephate** 75% SP: 600 g/acre

#### 3. Diamondback Moth

This is not known to affect Paddy (Dhan). Diamondback moth (*Plutella xylostella*) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops like cabbage, cauliflower, and mustard.

#### 4. Leaf Folder

The Rice Leaf Folder (*Cnaphalocrocis medinalis*) folds leaves longitudinally and feeds from within, causing white streaks on the leaves.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Avoid excessive nitrogenous fertilizers.
    *   Maintain proper plant spacing.
    *   Remove weeds from bunds.
*   **Chemical Control (Apply at economic threshold level, when 1-2 freshly damaged leaves per plant are observed):**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC: 60 ml/acre
    *   **Flubendiamide** 20% WG: 50 g/acre
    *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG: 80 g/acre
    *   **Indoxacarb** 14.5% SC: 200 ml/acre
    *   **Cartap hydrochloride** 50% SP: 400 g/acre
    *   **Fipronil** 5% SC: 400-600 ml/acre
    *   **Thiamethoxam + Chlorantraniliprole** 12.6% + 6.3% ZC: 80 ml/acre
    *   **Acephate** 75% SP: 600 g/acre

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Application:** Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully regarding dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval.
*   **Water Volume:** Ensure adequate water volume (typically 200-300 liters per acre for spray solutions) for thorough coverage.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate different classes of insecticides to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.
*   **Safety:** Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   **Environmental Impact:** Be mindful of the impact on beneficial insects and the environment. Apply pesticides judiciously.
