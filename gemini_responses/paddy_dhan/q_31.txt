As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I must provide scientifically verified advice specific to Paddy (Dhan) cultivation in Haryana.

Regarding your query:

*   **Fruit bursting**: This is not known to affect Paddy (Dhan). Paddy produces grains (caryopses), not fleshy fruits that are susceptible to bursting.
*   **Hardness in fruit**: This is not known to affect Paddy (Dhan) in the context of physical damage to a fruit. Grain hardness in paddy is a quality parameter influenced by genetics and environmental factors during grain development, not a physical damage like bursting or burning.

However, **Leaf burning/melting** can affect Paddy (Dhan) due to various physiological and environmental stresses. This condition is often a symptom of underlying issues rather than a direct physical damage. Control measures focus on addressing these root causes:

**Control Measures for Leaf Burning/Melting in Paddy (Dhan):**

1.  **Optimal Water Management:**
    *   Ensure consistent water availability, avoiding both severe drought stress and prolonged waterlogging, which can both lead to leaf tip drying or scorching.
    *   Maintain a shallow water level (2-5 cm) in the field during critical growth stages.

2.  **Balanced Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Potassium Deficiency:** This is a common cause of leaf tip and margin burning.
        *   Apply **Potassium chloride** (Muriate of Potash) at 40-60 kg/acre as basal or top dressing, based on soil test recommendations.
        *   For quick relief, a foliar spray of 1-2% **Potassium nitrate** solution can be applied during the vegetative stage.
    *   **Zinc Deficiency:** Can cause reddish-brown spots and bronzing, sometimes leading to necrosis (burning appearance).
        *   Apply **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** at 10 kg/acre as basal application.
        *   Alternatively, a foliar spray of 0.5% **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** solution (500 g in 100 litres of water) can be applied 2-3 times at 10-15 day intervals.
    *   **Iron Toxicity:** In some waterlogged or acidic soils, excess iron can cause bronzing and scorching of leaves.
        *   Improve drainage and apply lime if soil pH is very low (though less common in Haryana's paddy soils).
    *   **Salinity/Alkalinity:** High salt concentration in soil or irrigation water can lead to leaf tip burn.
        *   Use good quality irrigation water.
        *   For sodic soils, apply **Gypsum (Calcium sulphate dihydrate)** as per soil test recommendations to improve soil structure and reduce alkalinity.

3.  **Mitigation of Environmental Stress:**
    *   **Heat Stress:** While direct control is difficult, maintaining adequate soil moisture through proper irrigation can help the plants cope better with high temperatures, reducing scorching.
    *   **Chemical Phytotoxicity:**
        *   Always adhere strictly to the recommended dosages and application methods for all herbicides, insecticides, and fertilizers.
        *   Use calibrated sprayers to ensure uniform and correct application rates.
        *   Avoid spraying during high temperatures or strong winds to prevent drift and phytotoxicity.

4.  **Variety Selection:**
    *   Choose paddy varieties that are well-adapted to the local agro-climatic conditions and have known tolerance to specific stresses like heat or salinity, if these are recurring issues in your area.
