As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Paddy (Dhan) in Haryana:

**1. Alternaria Leaf Spot (Caused by *Alternaria padwickii*)**
While Alternaria leaf spot can occur in paddy, it is generally considered a minor disease in Haryana and rarely requires specific chemical intervention. Good cultural practices and fungicides applied for major diseases often provide sufficient control.

**2. Anthracnose (Caused by *Colletotrichum gloeosporioides*)**
This disease can cause leaf spots and panicle blight, particularly under specific environmental conditions.
*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
    *   **Carbendazim** (50% WP) at 500 g/acre in 200 L water.
    *   **Propiconazole** (25% EC) at 200 ml/acre in 200 L water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC) at 200 ml/acre in 200 L water.

**3. Blast (Caused by *Magnaporthe oryzae* / *Pyricularia oryzae*)**
Blast is a major and highly destructive disease affecting leaves, nodes, and panicles.
*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
    *   **Tricyclazole** (75% WP) at 240 g/acre in 200 L water.
    *   **Isoprothiolane** (40% EC) at 400 ml/acre in 200 L water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC) at 200 ml/acre in 200 L water.
    *   **Carbendazim** (50% WP) at 500 g/acre in 200 L water.
    *   **Propiconazole** (25% EC) at 200 ml/acre in 200 L water.
    *   **Carbendazim + Mancozeb** (63% WP) at 500 g/acre in 200 L water.

**4. Blight (Fungal - Sheath Blight, Caused by *Rhizoctonia solani*)**
Assuming "Blight" refers to the major fungal Sheath Blight, which causes characteristic lesions on leaf sheaths and can lead to lodging.
*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
    *   **Validamycin** (3% L) at 700-1000 ml/acre in 200 L water.
    *   **Propiconazole** (25% EC) at 200 ml/acre in 200 L water.
    *   **Hexaconazole** (5% SC) at 400 ml/acre in 200 L water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC) at 200 ml/acre in 200 L water.
    *   **Thifluzamide** (24% SC) at 100 ml/acre in 200 L water.

**5. Brown Spot (Caused by *Bipolaris oryzae* / *Cochliobolus miyabeanus*)**
Brown spot is a significant disease, especially in nutrient-deficient soils, causing characteristic spots on leaves and grains, leading to yield and quality reduction.
*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
    *   **Propiconazole** (25% EC) at 200 ml/acre in 200 L water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC) at 200 ml/acre in 200 L water.
    *   **Carbendazim** (50% WP) at 500 g/acre in 200 L water.
    *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 800 g/acre in 200 L water.

**6. Downy Mildew**
This is not known to affect Paddy (Dhan).

**7. Powdery Mildew**
This is not known to affect Paddy (Dhan).

**8. Grey Mildew**
This is not known to affect Paddy (Dhan).

**General Integrated Disease Management Practices for Paddy:**
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Cultivate disease-resistant or tolerant paddy varieties recommended for Haryana.
*   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds with fungicides like **Carbendazim** (2 g/kg seed) or **Tricyclazole** (2 g/kg seed) to protect against seed-borne diseases and early seedling infections.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, as it can make plants more susceptible to diseases like Blast and Sheath Blight. Ensure adequate potassium and phosphorus.
*   **Water Management:** Maintain proper water levels in the field. Avoid prolonged dry periods followed by flooding, which can stress plants.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest to reduce inoculum for the next season.
*   **Timely Sowing/Transplanting:** Adhere to recommended sowing/transplanting dates to avoid peak disease periods.
*   **Monitoring:** Regularly scout fields for early detection of disease symptoms to allow for timely intervention.

Always consult with local agricultural extension specialists for the most current and specific recommendations for your region and paddy variety.
