As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), here are the recommended cultivation practices for Paddy (Dhan) in Haryana:

**1. Sowing Method/Pattern:**
*   **Transplanted Paddy:** This is the traditional and most common method. Seedlings are raised in a nursery and then transplanted into puddled or unpuddled fields.
    *   **Manual Transplanting:** Seedlings are manually planted in rows.
    *   **Mechanical Transplanting:** Using a rice transplanter for faster and more uniform planting.
*   **Direct Seeded Rice (DSR):** This method is gaining popularity due to water conservation benefits.
    *   **Dry DSR (Drilled DSR):** Dry seeds are sown directly into a well-prepared, dry field using a seed drill.
    *   **Wet DSR:** Pre-germinated seeds are broadcast or drilled into a puddled and leveled field.

**2. Planting Depth:**
*   **Transplanted Paddy:** 2-3 cm deep. Ensure the roots are well-covered with soil.
*   **Direct Seeded Rice (DSR):** 2-3 cm deep for drilled DSR to ensure proper germination and establishment.

**3. Spacing:**
*   **Transplanted Paddy:**
    *   For most varieties: 20 cm row-to-row and 15 cm plant-to-plant (20 cm x 15 cm).
    *   For high-tillering varieties or fertile soils: 20 cm row-to-row and 20 cm plant-to-plant (20 cm x 20 cm).
    *   Maintain 2-3 seedlings per hill.
*   **Direct Seeded Rice (DSR):**
    *   **Drilled DSR:** Maintain a row-to-row spacing of 20-22.5 cm. Plant-to-plant spacing is determined by seed rate and drill calibration.
    *   **Wet DSR (Broadcast):** Spacing is less uniform, but the seed rate is adjusted to achieve optimal plant density.

**4. Seed Dose:**
*   **Transplanted Paddy (for nursery raising):**
    *   For long-duration varieties: 30-40 kg/acre.
    *   For short-duration varieties: 20-25 kg/acre.
*   **Direct Seeded Rice (DSR):**
    *   **Drilled DSR:** 20-25 kg/acre.
    *   **Wet DSR (Broadcast):** 30-40 kg/acre.
