As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I must inform you that **Fruit fly and Ber fly are not known to affect Paddy (Dhan).**

Fruit flies (e.g., *Bactrocera* species) are primarily pests of various fruit crops and some vegetables, where they damage the developing fruits. Ber fly (*Carpomyia vesuviana*) is a specific pest of Ber (Indian Jujube) fruits. Paddy (rice) is a cereal crop, and these insects do not infest it.

For effective pest management in Paddy, it is crucial to correctly identify the pests affecting your crop. If you are observing any damage or insect activity in your paddy field, please provide a detailed description or samples for accurate identification, and we can then recommend appropriate, scientifically verified control measures.
