As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for the control of pests in Paddy (Dhan) in Haryana:

1.  **Grasshopper:**
    Grasshoppers can cause damage by feeding on the leaves, especially during the seedling and vegetative stages of the paddy crop.

    **Control Measures:**
    *   **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect fields, especially bunds and field edges, for grasshopper activity.
    *   **Mechanical Control:** In small areas, hand-picking and destroying grasshoppers can be effective, particularly for nymphs.
    *   **Chemical Control:** If the infestation is severe and causing economic damage, especially during early crop stages, the following CIBRC approved insecticides can be used:
        *   **Malathion** 50% EC: Apply at 1.0 - 1.25 litres per acre in 200-250 litres of water.
        *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: Apply at 500 ml per acre in 200-250 litres of water.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: Apply at 100 ml per acre in 200-250 litres of water.

2.  **Painted bug (Bagrada hilaris):**
    This is not known to affect Paddy (Dhan). Painted bugs are primarily pests of cruciferous crops like mustard, cabbage, and radish.

3.  **Red cotton bug (Dysdercus cingulatus):**
    This is not known to affect Paddy (Dhan). Red cotton bugs are primarily pests of cotton and other malvaceous plants, feeding on developing seeds.

4.  **Black ants:**
    This is not known to affect Paddy (Dhan) as a direct pest causing economic damage. While ants may be present in the field, they do not typically cause direct damage to the paddy crop itself. They might be associated with other honeydew-producing insects, but direct control for ants in paddy is generally not required.
