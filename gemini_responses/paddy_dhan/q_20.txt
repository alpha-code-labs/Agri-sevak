As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for addressing micronutrient deficiencies in Paddy (Dhan) in Haryana. It is crucial to conduct soil testing to confirm specific deficiencies before applying any micronutrients.

### Addressing Micro-nutrient Deficiencies in Paddy (Dhan)

**1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency:**
Zinc deficiency is very common in paddy, especially in alkaline and calcareous soils, leading to "Khaira disease."

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** at 25 kg/acre as a basal dose before transplanting or within 10-15 days of transplanting.
*   **Foliar Spray (for standing crop):**
    *   Spray 0.5% solution of **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (5 g/L of water). Add 0.25% unslaked lime (2.5 g/L) to neutralize acidity if needed, or use a compatible sticker/spreader. Repeat after 10-15 days if symptoms persist.

**2. Iron (Fe) Deficiency:**
Iron deficiency can occur in alkaline soils or in conditions of poor drainage.

*   **Foliar Spray:**
    *   Spray 0.5-1.0% solution of **Ferrous sulphate** (5-10 g/L of water). Repeat after 7-10 days if symptoms persist.

**3. Boron (B) Deficiency:**
Boron deficiency can affect pollen viability and grain filling, leading to poor panicle exertion and sterility.

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate) at 2-4 kg/acre as a basal dose.
*   **Foliar Spray:**
    *   Spray 0.1-0.2% solution of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** or **Borax** (1-2 g/L of water) at tillering or panicle initiation stage.

**4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency:**
Calcium deficiency is less common in paddy, especially if gypsum is used for sodic soil reclamation.

*   **Foliar Spray:**
    *   Spray 0.5-1.0% solution of **Calcium nitrate** (5-10 g/L of water) if deficiency symptoms are observed.

**5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency:**
Magnesium deficiency can lead to interveinal chlorosis, particularly on older leaves.

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Magnesium sulphate** at 10-20 kg/acre as a basal dose.
*   **Foliar Spray:**
    *   Spray 0.5-1.0% solution of **Magnesium sulphate** (5-10 g/L of water). Repeat after 10-15 days if symptoms persist.

**6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency:**
Manganese deficiency can occur in alkaline soils, leading to interveinal chlorosis and greyish-brown spots.

*   **Foliar Spray:**
    *   Spray 0.5% solution of **Manganese sulphate** (5 g/L of water). Repeat after 7-10 days if symptoms persist.

**General Recommendations:**

*   **Soil Testing:** Always conduct a comprehensive soil test before planting to determine the exact nutrient status and tailor your fertilization program accordingly.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management (INM):** Combine chemical fertilizers with organic manures (Farm Yard Manure, compost, green manure) to improve soil health and nutrient availability.
*   **Timely Application:** Apply micronutrients at the appropriate growth stages for maximum effectiveness.
*   **Water Management:** Proper water management is crucial as it influences nutrient availability in paddy fields.
