This is not known to affect Paddy (Dhan).

The terms "Flower drop," "Fruit drop," "Tinda dropping," and "Boll dropping" are typically associated with horticultural crops (like vegetables or fruit trees) or fibre crops (like cotton), not with Paddy (rice). Paddy produces florets that develop into grains, and issues related to poor grain formation or sterility are addressed differently. "Tinda" is a gourd, and "Boll" refers to the fruit capsule of plants like cotton, neither of which are related to Paddy.
