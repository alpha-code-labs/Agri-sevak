As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling sucking pests in Paddy (Dhan) in Haryana:

It is important to correctly identify the pest before applying any control measures. Regular field monitoring is crucial.

Here's the guidance for the mentioned pests:

*   **Aphids:**
    Aphids are generally not considered a major pest of Paddy (Dhan) in Haryana and rarely require specific chemical control. Natural enemies usually keep their populations in check.

*   **Leafhopper (Brown Plant Hopper - BPH, Green Leafhopper - GLH):**
    Leafhoppers, particularly Brown Plant Hopper (BPH) and Green Leafhopper (GLH), are significant pests of Paddy (Dhan). Control measures should be initiated upon reaching economic threshold levels (e.g., 5-10 hoppers per hill).

    Recommended chemical control measures:
    *   **Buprofezin** 25% SC @ 800 ml/acre
    *   **Dinotefuran** 20% SG @ 80 g/acre
    *   **Flonicamid** 50% WG @ 60 g/acre
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL @ 100-125 ml/acre
    *   **Pymetrozine** 50% WG @ 120 g/acre
    *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG @ 40 g/acre

*   **Whitefly:**
    This is not known to affect Paddy (Dhan).

*   **Thrips:**
    Paddy thrips can be a problem, especially in nurseries and early transplanted crops, causing silvering or rolling of leaves.

    Recommended chemical control measures:
    *   **Fipronil** 5% SC @ 400-600 ml/acre
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL @ 100-125 ml/acre
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC @ 100 ml/acre
    *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG @ 40 g/acre

*   **Psylla:**
    This is not known to affect Paddy (Dhan).

**General Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Practices for Sucking Pests in Paddy:**

1.  **Resistant Varieties:** Where available and suitable for the region, cultivate pest-resistant or tolerant paddy varieties.
2.  **Monitoring:** Regularly scout fields, especially the base of plants, for pest presence and population build-up.
3.  **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive application of nitrogenous fertilizers, as this can lead to lush growth that favors sucking pest multiplication.
4.  **Water Management:** Maintain proper water levels in the field. Draining the field for a few days can sometimes help manage BPH populations.
5.  **Weed Control:** Keep bunds and fields free of weeds, which can act as alternate hosts for pests.
6.  **Natural Enemies:** Conserve natural enemies like spiders, mirid bugs, and predatory beetles, which play a significant role in keeping sucking pest populations in check. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.
7.  **Proper Spacing:** Maintain recommended plant spacing to ensure good air circulation and reduce humidity, which can discourage pest build-up.
8.  **Timely Sowing/Planting:** Adhere to recommended sowing/transplanting dates to avoid peak pest incidence periods.

Always follow the instructions on the pesticide label for safe and effective use, including dosage, application method, and pre-harvest interval. Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
