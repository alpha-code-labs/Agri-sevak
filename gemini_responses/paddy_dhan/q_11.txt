As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies in Paddy (Dhan) in Haryana:

**Sawflies:**
This is not known to affect Paddy (Dhan).

**Weevils:**
This is not known to affect Paddy (Dhan). The common Rice Weevil (*Sitophilus oryzae*) is primarily a stored grain pest and not a field pest of standing paddy.

**Beetles:**
Among beetles, the Rice Hispa (*Dicladispa armigera*) is a significant pest of Paddy in Haryana. The adult beetles feed on the green matter of leaves, scraping the surface, while the grubs mine into the leaves, creating irregular white patches or blotches. Severe infestation can lead to reduced photosynthetic activity and yield loss.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Rice Hispa (Beetle):**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Clipping of leaf tips:** In the nursery, clip the tips of seedlings before transplanting to remove egg masses.
    *   **Field sanitation:** Remove alternate weed hosts from bunds and surrounding areas.
    *   **Nutrient management:** Avoid excessive nitrogenous fertilizers, as this can lead to lush growth that attracts pests.
    *   **Water management:** Maintain proper water levels in the field.

2.  **Mechanical Control:**
    *   **Net sweeping:** In early stages of infestation, adult beetles can be collected using hand nets and destroyed.
    *   **Kerosene oil application:** A thin film of kerosene oil (1-2 L/acre) can be sprayed on the water surface in the field, and then a rope can be dragged across the crop to dislodge the beetles, which then fall into the kerosene film and die.

3.  **Chemical Control:**
    When the pest population exceeds the Economic Threshold Level (ETL) – typically 2 adult beetles per plant or 5% damaged leaves – chemical intervention may be necessary. Use the following CIBRC approved technical chemicals:

    *   **For Granular Application:**
        *   **Fipronil 0.3% GR:** Apply 20-25 kg/acre.
        *   **Cartap Hydrochloride 4% GR:** Apply 10 kg/acre.

    *   **For Spray Application:**
        *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC:** Mix 500 ml in 200-250 litres of water per acre.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** Mix 100-125 ml in 200-250 litres of water per acre.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application.
*   Ensure proper spray coverage for effective control.
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension officers for the most current recommendations and specific pest situations in your area.
