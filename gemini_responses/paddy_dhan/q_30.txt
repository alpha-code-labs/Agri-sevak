Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concerns regarding growth issues in Paddy (Dhan). Addressing these issues promptly and scientifically is crucial for a healthy crop and good yield.

Before applying any corrective measures, it is always advisable to conduct a soil test to understand the specific nutrient status of your field. This helps in precise and efficient nutrient management.

Here's how to manage the mentioned growth issues:

### 1. Slow Growth

Slow growth in paddy can be due to various factors including nutrient deficiencies, water stress, temperature fluctuations, or pest/disease incidence.

**Causes:**
*   Deficiency of essential nutrients (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, Zinc).
*   Water stress (either too little or too much).
*   Low temperatures during early growth stages.
*   Soil compaction or poor soil health.
*   Pest damage (e.g., stem borer, leaf folder) or disease incidence.

**Management:**
*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Nitrogen (N) Deficiency:** If leaves are pale green to yellow, especially older leaves.
        *   Top dress with **Urea** at 25-50 kg/acre, depending on the severity and crop stage.
        *   For quick recovery, foliar spray 2% **Urea** solution (20 g/L water) at weekly intervals until recovery.
    *   **Phosphorus (P) Deficiency:** If leaves are dark green with purplish discoloration, and tillering is poor.
        *   Ensure adequate basal application of **Diammonium phosphate** or **Single superphosphate** as per soil test recommendations. Corrective measures during later stages are less effective for P.
    *   **Potassium (K) Deficiency:** If older leaves show yellowing or browning along margins, and plants are weak.
        *   Top dress with **Potassium chloride** (Muriate of Potash) at 10-20 kg/acre.
    *   **Zinc (Zn) Deficiency:** If younger leaves show interveinal chlorosis, reddish-brown spots, and stunted growth (Khaira disease).
        *   Foliar spray 0.5% **Zinc sulfate heptahydrate** (5 g/L water) mixed with 0.25% **Calcium hydroxide** (2.5 g/L water) to prevent leaf scorch. Repeat after 10-15 days if needed.
        *   Alternatively, apply **Zinc sulfate heptahydrate** to the soil at 10-25 kg/acre before transplanting or as a corrective measure.
*   **Water Management:** Ensure optimal water levels. Avoid prolonged waterlogging or drought stress.
*   **Pest/Disease Control:** Identify and manage specific pests or diseases as per HAU recommendations.

### 2. Yellow Growth (Chlorosis)

Yellowing of paddy leaves (chlorosis) is a common symptom, often indicating nutrient deficiencies or environmental stress.

**Causes:**
*   Nitrogen deficiency (most common).
*   Iron deficiency (especially in alkaline soils).
*   Zinc deficiency.
*   Sulfur deficiency.
*   Waterlogging or poor drainage.
*   Disease (e.g., Tungro virus, Bacterial Blight).

**Management:**
*   **Nitrogen (N) Deficiency:**
    *   Foliar spray 2% **Urea** solution (20 g/L water) for rapid greening.
    *   Top dress with **Urea** at 25-50 kg/acre.
*   **Iron (Fe) Deficiency:** If younger leaves turn yellow while veins remain green (interveinal chlorosis), common in high pH soils.
    *   Foliar spray 0.5-1% **Ferrous sulfate** (5-10 g/L water) mixed with 0.25% **Calcium hydroxide** (2.5 g/L water). Repeat after 7-10 days if necessary.
*   **Zinc (Zn) Deficiency:** (Refer to management under Slow Growth).
*   **Sulfur (S) Deficiency:** If younger leaves show uniform yellowing.
    *   Apply **Calcium sulfate dihydrate** (Gypsum) at 200-400 kg/acre during land preparation or as a top dressing.
    *   Alternatively, use **Ammonium sulfate** as a nitrogen source if sulfur is also deficient.
*   **Water Management:** Improve drainage if waterlogging is the cause.

### 3. Excessive Height (Lodging Risk)

Excessive height can lead to lodging (falling over of plants), especially during strong winds or heavy rains, resulting in significant yield loss.

**Causes:**
*   Over-application of Nitrogen fertilizer.
*   High planting density.
*   Use of tall-statured varieties.
*   Low light conditions.

**Management:**
*   **Nitrogen Management:**
    *   Optimize Nitrogen application based on soil test results and crop stage. Avoid excessive N, especially during the vegetative phase. Split N application is recommended.
*   **Planting Density:** Maintain optimal plant spacing (e.g., 20x15 cm or 20x20 cm) to ensure proper light penetration and air circulation.
*   **Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs):**
    *   To reduce plant height and strengthen stems, consider applying **Chlormequat chloride**.
    *   Apply **Chlormequat chloride** (e.g., 50% SL formulation) at 1-1.5 L/acre, typically between maximum tillering and panicle initiation stage. Consult your local agricultural extension officer for precise timing and dosage based on your specific variety and field conditions.

### 4. Excessive Flowering

"Excessive flowering" in paddy is not a standard term for a problematic growth issue that requires intervention to *reduce* flowering. A high number of productive panicles is generally desirable. However, if you observe:

*   **Premature Panicle Initiation/Flowering:** This can be a sign of stress (e.g., drought, severe nutrient deficiency, extreme temperatures) causing the plant to rush into reproduction.
*   **Unproductive Panicles:** A high number of panicles that are small, poorly filled, or sterile, often due to nutrient imbalance or stress during grain filling.

**Management:**
*   **Address Underlying Stress:**
    *   Ensure consistent and adequate water supply throughout the crop cycle, especially during critical stages like panicle initiation, flowering, and grain filling.
    *   Provide balanced nutrition, particularly adequate **Potassium chloride** (Muriate of Potash) during the reproductive phase, which is crucial for grain filling and overall panicle health.
    *   Maintain optimal plant health by managing pests and diseases.
*   **Optimize Nutrient Balance:** Ensure that all macro and micronutrients are available in balanced proportions as per soil test recommendations to support healthy panicle development and grain filling, rather than just panicle number.

For any specific concerns or severe issues, please consult your nearest HAU Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or agricultural extension officer for on-site diagnosis and tailored recommendations.
