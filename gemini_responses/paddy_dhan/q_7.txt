As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm the following regarding the diseases mentioned for Paddy (Dhan):

*   **Dieback**: This is not known to affect Paddy (Dhan). Dieback is a condition typically observed in woody plants (trees and shrubs), characterized by the progressive death of twigs and branches from the tips. Paddy is an annual grass and does not exhibit this type of symptom.
*   **Twig blight**: This is not known to affect Paddy (Dhan). Similar to dieback, twig blight is a disease affecting woody plants, causing the death of twigs and small branches. Paddy plants do not have "twigs."
*   **Tikka disease**: This is not known to affect Paddy (Dhan). Tikka disease is a common and significant leaf spot disease primarily affecting Groundnut (Moongfali), caused by *Cercospora* and *Phaeoisariopsis* species. It does not occur in Paddy. Paddy has its own distinct leaf spot diseases, such as Brown Spot, but these are not referred to as Tikka disease.
