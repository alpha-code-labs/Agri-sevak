As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the use of growth regulators/hormones in Paddy (Dhan) for Haryana.

It is crucial to understand the specific roles and recommended applications of these substances in paddy cultivation.

*   **Ethrel (Ethephon)**
    While **Ethephon** is a plant growth regulator, its specific recommendation as a growth regulator/hormone for general yield enhancement or specific physiological processes in Paddy (Dhan) is not a standard practice or recommendation by Haryana Agricultural University (HAU).

*   **2,4-D**
    **2,4-D** is a synthetic auxin and can act as a growth regulator at extremely low concentrations. However, its primary and widely recommended use in Paddy (Dhan) in Haryana is as a selective herbicide for the control of broadleaf weeds and sedges. Its application as a growth regulator/hormone for yield enhancement or specific physiological processes is not a standard recommendation by Haryana Agricultural University (HAU).

*   **Boron**
    Boron is an essential micronutrient critical for various physiological processes, including cell wall formation, sugar transport, and pollen viability, all of which are vital for healthy plant growth and yield. Therefore, its application, especially in boron-deficient soils, acts as a growth regulator by ensuring proper plant development.

    **Recommended Dose for Boron (Foliar Application):**
    *   **Technical Chemical Name:** **Sodium tetraborate decahydrate** (commonly known as Borax)
        *   **Dose:** 400 g per acre, dissolved in 200 litres of water, as a foliar spray.
        *   **Timing:** Apply at the tillering stage and repeat at the panicle initiation stage if deficiency symptoms are observed or soil analysis indicates low boron levels.
    *   **Technical Chemical Name:** **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate**
        *   **Dose:** 200 g per acre, dissolved in 200 litres of water, as a foliar spray.
        *   **Timing:** Apply at the tillering stage and repeat at the panicle initiation stage if deficiency symptoms are observed or soil analysis indicates low boron levels.

Always ensure proper diagnosis of nutrient deficiencies through soil and plant tissue analysis before applying micronutrients. Follow label instructions for all chemical products.
