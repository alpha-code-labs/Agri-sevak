Namaste, Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU), Hisar, I am providing you with scientifically verified recommendations for weed control in Paddy (Dhan) cultivation in Haryana. Effective weed management is crucial for maximizing your paddy yields.

Weeds in paddy fields can be broadly categorized into grasses (narrowleaf), sedges, and broadleaf weeds. A combination of cultural practices and judicious use of herbicides is recommended for optimal control.

### General Principles for Weed Management in Paddy:

1.  **Proper Land Preparation:** Thorough puddling in transplanted paddy helps suppress weeds by burying them and creating an anaerobic environment.
2.  **Water Management:** Maintaining a continuous shallow layer of water (2-5 cm) after transplanting is critical for suppressing weed germination and growth, especially for many broadleaf weeds and sedges.
3.  **Healthy Seedlings:** Use healthy, vigorous seedlings for transplanting to ensure quick establishment and canopy closure, which helps shade out weeds.
4.  **Timely Application:** Herbicide application at the correct growth stage of weeds and crop is paramount for efficacy.

### Specific Recommendations for Weeds in Paddy (Dhan):

#### 1. Broadleaf Weeds and Narrowleaf Weeds (Grasses & Sedges):

These are the most common and problematic weed types in paddy.

**A. Pre-Emergence (PRE) Herbicides (Applied within 0-5 days after transplanting/sowing):**
These herbicides prevent weed seeds from germinating or kill them shortly after germination. Ensure a thin film of water (2-3 cm) is present at the time of application and maintained for 3-5 days.

*   **For Broad Spectrum Control (Grasses, Sedges, and Broadleaf Weeds):**
    *   **Butachlor** @ 1.0-1.5 kg active ingredient per acre (e.g., 2.0-3.0 litres of 50% EC formulation per acre).
    *   **Pretilachlor** @ 0.45-0.6 kg active ingredient per acre (e.g., 1.5-2.0 litres of 30% EC formulation per acre).
    *   **Oxadiargyl** @ 80-100 g active ingredient per acre (e.g., 400-500 ml of 20% EC formulation per acre).
    *   **Pyrazosulfuron ethyl** @ 20-25 g active ingredient per acre (e.g., 80-100 g of 20% WP formulation per acre).

**B. Post-Emergence (POST) Herbicides (Applied when weeds are young, typically 15-25 days after transplanting/sowing):**
These herbicides kill weeds that have already emerged. Drain the field before application, apply the herbicide, and reflood after 24-48 hours.

*   **For Grasses (Narrowleaf Weeds):**
    *   **Bispyribac sodium** @ 20-25 g active ingredient per acre (e.g., 80-100 ml of 10% SC formulation per acre). Apply at 15-25 DAT/DAS.
    *   **Fenoxaprop-p-ethyl** @ 50-60 g active ingredient per acre (e.g., 250-300 ml of 10% EC formulation per acre). Apply at 15-25 DAT/DAS.
    *   **Cyhalofop-butyl** @ 80-100 g active ingredient per acre (e.g., 400-500 ml of 20% EC formulation per acre). Apply at 15-25 DAT/DAS.

*   **For Broadleaf Weeds and Sedges:**
    *   **2,4-D ethyl ester** or **2,4-D sodium salt** @ 0.5-1.0 kg active ingredient per acre (e.g., 1.0-2.0 litres of 38% EC or 1.25-2.5 kg of 80% WP formulation per acre). Apply at 20-30 DAT/DAS.
    *   **Metsulfuron methyl + Chlorimuron ethyl** (pre-mix) @ 16-20 g active ingredient per acre (e.g., 80-100 g of 20% WP formulation per acre). Apply at 15-25 DAT/DAS.
    *   **Ethoxysulfuron** @ 15-20 g active ingredient per acre (e.g., 60-80 g of 15% WG formulation per acre). Apply at 15-25 DAT/DAS.

#### 2. Specific Weeds Mentioned:

*   **Amarbail (Cuscuta spp.):** Amarbail is primarily a parasitic weed of dicotyledonous plants and is not a common or major weed of paddy (a monocot). If observed on bunds or in non-cropped areas adjacent to paddy fields, manual removal is the most effective method to prevent its spread. No specific herbicide is typically recommended for Amarbail control *within* paddy fields.

*   **Bathu (Chenopodium album):** Bathu is predominantly a weed of Rabi season crops (like wheat, mustard) and is not a primary weed of Kharif season paddy, especially in flooded conditions. If it appears in upland rice or on field bunds, general broadleaf herbicides like **2,4-D** would be effective, but it is not a target weed for typical paddy weed management.

*   **Congress grass (Parthenium hysterophorus):** Congress grass is a weed of wasteland, roadsides, and non-cropped areas. It is not a primary weed of paddy fields. Manual removal from bunds and surrounding areas is recommended to prevent its spread.

*   **Orobanche (Broomrape):** This is not known to affect Paddy (Dhan). Orobanche is a parasitic weed that primarily infests dicotyledonous crops like mustard, tobacco, tomato, and brinjal. It does not parasitize monocotyledonous crops like paddy.

*   **Phalaris minor (Gulli Danda):** Phalaris minor is a major weed of Rabi season crops, particularly wheat. It is not a primary weed of paddy, especially transplanted and flooded paddy. While it might occasionally appear in direct-seeded rice (DSR) under specific conditions, it is not a typical target for paddy weed control in Haryana.

### Important Considerations:

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the herbicide label carefully regarding dosage, timing, and safety precautions.
*   Use the recommended quantity of water for spraying (typically 150-200 litres per acre) to ensure proper coverage.
*   Rotate herbicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of herbicide resistance in weeds.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for specific advice tailored to your field conditions.

By adopting these integrated weed management strategies, you can effectively control weeds and ensure a healthy and productive paddy crop.
