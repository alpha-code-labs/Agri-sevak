As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling viral diseases in Paddy (Dhan) in Haryana.

It is crucial to understand that viral diseases in plants cannot be directly cured with chemical applications. The primary strategy for managing viral diseases is to control their insect vectors, utilize resistant varieties, and implement appropriate cultural practices.

Let's address each condition you mentioned:

*   **Leaf curl:** This is not known to affect Paddy (Dhan) as a specific viral disease. While some viral infections might cause leaf distortion or rolling, "Leaf curl virus" is typically associated with other crops like cotton or tomato.
*   **Yellow vein clearing:** This is not known to affect Paddy (Dhan) as a specific viral disease. While yellowing symptoms are common in various paddy diseases, "Yellow vein clearing virus" is not a recognized viral disease of paddy.
*   **Tristeza:** This is not known to affect Paddy (Dhan). Tristeza is a major viral disease primarily affecting citrus crops.

Now, let's discuss the viral diseases that affect Paddy (Dhan) and their management:

**Viral Diseases Affecting Paddy (Dhan) and Their Management:**

The viral diseases you mentioned, such as Mosaic (often caused by Rice Tungro Virus - RTV), Stripe (Rice Stripe Virus - RSV), and Stunt (Rice Grassy Stunt Virus - RGSV, Rice Ragged Stunt Virus - RRSV), are significant concerns. These viruses are primarily transmitted by insect vectors like green leafhoppers (for RTV) and brown planthoppers (for RGSV, RRSV, and RSV).

**Integrated Management Strategies:**

1.  **Resistant Varieties:**
    *   Cultivate paddy varieties known to be resistant or tolerant to specific viral diseases prevalent in your area. Consult with HAU experts or local agricultural extension for recommended varieties suitable for Haryana.

2.  **Vector Control (Insect Management):**
    *   Controlling the insect vectors (green leafhoppers and brown planthoppers) is the most critical step in preventing the spread of viral diseases.
    *   **Nursery Stage:** Protect seedlings from early infestation by vectors.
    *   **Field Stage:** Monitor insect populations regularly. Apply insecticides when pest populations reach economic threshold levels.
    *   **Chemical Control Options (CIBRC Approved Technical Chemicals):**
        *   **For Green Leafhoppers (Vectors of Rice Tungro Virus):**
            *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** 100-125 ml/acre
            *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** 40-80 g/acre
            *   **Fipronil 5% SC:** 1000-1200 ml/acre
        *   **For Brown Planthoppers (Vectors of Rice Grassy Stunt Virus, Rice Ragged Stunt Virus, and Rice Stripe Virus):**
            *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** 320-400 ml/acre
            *   **Pymetrozine 50% WG:** 120 g/acre
            *   **Dinotefuran 20% SG:** 150-200 g/acre
            *   **Ethiprole 10% EC:** 500 ml/acre
            *   **Fipronil 5% SC:** 1000-1200 ml/acre
            *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** 100-125 ml/acre (effective against early instars)
            *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** 40-80 g/acre

3.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Synchronized Planting:** Plant paddy in a synchronized manner over a large area to break the pest cycle and reduce the availability of continuous host plants.
    *   **Roguing:** Promptly remove and destroy infected plants and stubbles to reduce inoculum sources.
    *   **Weed Management:** Control weeds in and around paddy fields, as many weeds can serve as alternate hosts for both viruses and their insect vectors.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush growth and attract planthoppers. Maintain balanced fertilization.
    *   **Water Management:** Proper water management can help in maintaining plant vigor and reducing stress.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** While not always feasible for paddy, it can help in breaking pest and disease cycles.
    *   **Clean Cultivation:** Ensure field sanitation by removing crop residues after harvest.

By adopting these integrated management strategies, you can effectively minimize the incidence and spread of viral diseases in your paddy crop. Always consult with local agricultural experts for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions.
