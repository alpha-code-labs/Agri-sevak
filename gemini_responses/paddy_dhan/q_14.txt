As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling soil pests like Termites and Nematodes (Root-knot) in Paddy (Dhan) in Haryana.

It is important to note that while these pests can affect paddy, their severity often depends on factors like soil type, previous cropping history, and irrigation practices (e.g., upland/direct-seeded rice vs. transplanted puddled rice).

### Control of Soil Pests in Paddy (Dhan)

**1. Termites (Deemak)**

Termites can cause damage to germinating seeds, seedlings, and even older plants by feeding on roots and stems, especially in direct-seeded rice or upland paddy conditions.

**Management Strategies:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Ensure proper land preparation and removal of crop residues that can serve as food sources for termites.
    *   Adequate irrigation and maintaining standing water in transplanted paddy fields generally discourages termite activity.
    *   Deep ploughing during summer can expose termite colonies to heat and predators.
*   **Chemical Control (Soil Application):**
    *   **For Direct-Seeded Rice (DSR) or Upland Paddy:**
        *   Apply **Fipronil** 0.3% GR at 10 kg/acre at the time of sowing or transplanting, mixed with sand or fertilizer, and broadcast evenly.
        *   Alternatively, for pre-plant incorporation or drenching in problematic areas, **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC can be used at 2 L/acre, mixed with sufficient water and applied to the soil before planting.

**2. Nematodes (Root-knot Nematodes - *Meloidogyne* spp.)**

Root-knot nematodes are a significant problem in paddy, particularly in lighter soils, upland rice, or direct-seeded rice. They cause characteristic galls or knots on the roots, leading to stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, reduced tillering, and ultimately yield loss.

**Management Strategies:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate paddy with non-host crops (e.g., certain cereals, marigold) to reduce nematode populations in the soil.
    *   **Summer Ploughing:** Deep ploughing during the hot summer months exposes nematodes to high temperatures and desiccation, reducing their numbers.
    *   **Organic Matter:** Incorporating well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost can improve soil health and enhance natural enemies of nematodes.
    *   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available and suitable for Haryana conditions, using nematode-resistant paddy varieties can be an effective long-term solution.
*   **Chemical Control (Soil Application):**
    *   Apply **Carbofuran** 3% GR at 10-12 kg/acre. This should be broadcast evenly in the field, preferably at the time of transplanting or within 20-30 days after transplanting, followed by light irrigation or incorporation into the soil.
    *   **Fipronil** 0.3% GR at 10 kg/acre, applied as described for termites, can also provide some suppressive effect against nematodes, especially when both pests are a concern.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the pesticide label regarding dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Consult your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and the latest approved practices.
*   Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods, is always recommended for sustainable pest control.
