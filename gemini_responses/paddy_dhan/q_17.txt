As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following doses for organic manures and bio-stimulants in Paddy (Dhan) cultivation, based on scientific verification for Haryana conditions:

It is crucial to incorporate organic manures into the soil well before transplanting to allow for proper decomposition and nutrient release.

*   **Farm Yard Manure (FYM):**
    *   Apply **10-15 tonnes per acre** (approximately 25-37.5 tonnes per hectare).
    *   Incorporate into the soil 2-3 weeks before transplanting.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   Apply **2-4 tonnes per acre** (approximately 5-10 tonnes per hectare).
    *   Incorporate into the soil 1-2 weeks before transplanting.

*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract based bio-stimulant):**
    *   Sagarika is a plant growth promoter/bio-stimulant, not a bulk organic manure like FYM or vermicompost. It enhances nutrient uptake and plant vigor.
    *   **Granular Sagarika:**
        *   Apply **8-10 kg per acre** as a basal application at the time of transplanting or within 15-20 days after transplanting.
    *   **Liquid Sagarika (Foliar Spray):**
        *   Mix **2.5-3 ml per litre of water** and spray at tillering stage (20-30 DAT) and again at panicle initiation stage (45-55 DAT).
        *   Typically, this translates to **500-600 ml per acre** per spray, depending on the spray volume.
