As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm that most of the specialized practices you've mentioned are either not applicable or not recommended for Paddy (Dhan) cultivation. Paddy is a unique cereal crop with specific growth habits.

Here's a breakdown for each practice:

*   **Pruning:**
    This is not known to affect Paddy (Dhan). Paddy is a monocotyledonous cereal crop that develops tillers from its base, which are crucial for grain production. Pruning, which involves removing parts of the plant, is not a standard or beneficial practice for paddy and would likely reduce yield significantly.

*   **Desuckering:**
    This is not known to affect Paddy (Dhan). Similar to pruning, desuckering (removal of side shoots or suckers) is not practiced in paddy. The tillers produced by paddy plants are essential for maximizing grain yield, and their removal would be counterproductive.

*   **Mulching:**
    While traditional mulching with external materials is generally not a standard practice in flooded lowland paddy cultivation (where standing water itself helps in weed suppression and temperature regulation), residue management can be considered a form of mulching in certain paddy systems.
    *   In conservation agriculture practices, particularly in **Direct Seeded Rice (DSR)**, retaining rice straw or other crop residues on the soil surface acts as a mulch. This practice helps in:
        *   Conserving soil moisture.
        *   Suppressing weed growth.
        *   Moderating soil temperature.
        *   Improving soil organic matter and overall soil health over time.
    However, this differs from the typical mulching done in horticultural crops.

*   **Grafting:**
    This is not known to affect Paddy (Dhan). Grafting is a horticultural technique used for joining parts of two plants, primarily in dicotyledonous species. Paddy, being a monocotyledonous cereal crop, lacks the anatomical structure (e.g., vascular cambium) required for successful grafting. Therefore, grafting is neither possible nor relevant for paddy cultivation.

*   **Pollination:**
    Paddy (rice) is primarily a **self-pollinating crop**. Its flowers are perfect (containing both male and female reproductive organs) and typically self-pollinate before or immediately after the flower opens. While wind can assist in some cross-pollination, specialized practices such as hand-pollination or managing insect pollinators are not required or beneficial for paddy cultivation. The crop efficiently produces seeds through its natural self-pollination mechanism.
