As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice on irrigation management for Paddy (Dhan) in Haryana.

Paddy (Dhan) is a water-intensive crop, and precise irrigation management is crucial for maximizing yield and water use efficiency.

**Irrigation Management in Paddy (Dhan)**

**1. First Irrigation:**
*   **Timing:** The first irrigation is critical and should be applied immediately after transplanting the paddy seedlings. This helps in the establishment of the young plants and reduces transplanting shock.
*   **Water Depth:** Maintain a shallow water depth of **2-3 cm** for the initial 7-10 days after transplanting. This shallow submergence aids in root development and helps the seedlings to establish firmly in the soil.
*   **Purpose:** This initial irrigation ensures adequate moisture for seedling survival, facilitates nutrient uptake, and helps in suppressing early germinating weeds.

**2. Second Irrigation and Subsequent Irrigations:**
*   **General Principle:** After the initial establishment phase, a continuous shallow submergence or intermittent irrigation with short drying periods is generally recommended for most of the crop cycle.
*   **Water Depth:** From about 10-15 days after transplanting until the dough stage of grain filling, maintain a standing water depth of **5-7 cm** in the field.
*   **Critical Growth Stages for Irrigation:**
    *   **Tillering Stage (15-40 days after transplanting):** This is a crucial stage for the development of tillers, which contribute significantly to yield. Maintain **5-7 cm** water depth continuously. Water stress during this period can severely reduce the number of productive tillers.
    *   **Panicle Initiation to Flowering Stage (40-70 days after transplanting, depending on variety):** This is the most sensitive stage to water stress. Continuous submergence of **5-7 cm** is essential. Water deficit during panicle initiation, booting, and flowering can lead to sterile spikelets and substantial yield losses.
    *   **Grain Filling Stage (70-90 days after transplanting):** Continue to maintain **5-7 cm** water depth until the grains reach the soft dough stage. Adequate water ensures proper grain development and filling, leading to plump and heavy grains.
*   **Drainage Before Harvest:** It is vital to drain the field completely about **7-10 days** before the anticipated harvest date. This allows the soil to dry, facilitates mechanical harvesting, reduces lodging (falling over of plants), and promotes uniform grain maturity, which improves grain quality.

**3. Sprinkler Use in Paddy (Dhan):**
*   **General Unsuitability for Main Field:** Sprinkler irrigation is generally **not recommended** for the main field cultivation of Paddy (Dhan) due to the crop's specific water requirements.
*   **Reasons for Unsuitability:**
    *   **High Water Requirement for Submergence:** Paddy thrives under flooded or semi-flooded conditions, requiring a standing layer of water for most of its growth cycle. Sprinklers are inefficient in maintaining this continuous submergence.
    *   **Weed Control:** Standing water is a primary and highly effective method for suppressing weed growth in paddy fields. Sprinkler irrigation does not provide this crucial benefit, leading to increased weed pressure and higher labor/herbicide costs.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** The availability and uptake of certain nutrients, particularly nitrogen, are optimized under flooded conditions.
    *   **Temperature Regulation:** The standing water helps in moderating soil temperature, which is beneficial for paddy growth, especially during hot periods.
*   **Limited Specific Applications:** While not suitable for the main field, sprinklers might be used in very specific, limited scenarios:
    *   **Nursery Beds:** For initial germination and establishment of seedlings in dry-bed nurseries before transplanting, where precise and light water application is needed.
    *   **Direct Seeded Rice (DSR) - Initial Establishment:** In some Direct Seeded Rice systems, light sprinkler irrigation might be employed for initial seed germination and seedling establishment before switching to controlled intermittent irrigation or flood irrigation for the bulk of the crop cycle. However, for the majority of the growth period, flood irrigation or controlled intermittent irrigation remains the preferred method for DSR as well.
