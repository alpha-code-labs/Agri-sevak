As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm the following regarding rust diseases in Paddy (Dhan):

This is not known to affect Paddy (Dhan).

The rust diseases (Black Rust, Brown Rust, Yellow Rust, White Rust, and Red Rust) you have mentioned are primarily diseases of other crops like wheat, barley, oats, or specific horticultural crops, and are not known to cause significant damage or be a common problem in Paddy (Dhan) cultivation in Haryana or elsewhere. Paddy is affected by other fungal and bacterial diseases, but not these specific rusts.
