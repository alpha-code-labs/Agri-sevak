As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified seed treatment and soil treatment processes for Paddy (Dhan) cultivation in Haryana to ensure healthy crop establishment and minimize early pest and disease incidence.

### Seed Treatment Process for Paddy (Dhan)

Seed treatment is crucial for protecting seeds and young seedlings from seed-borne and soil-borne diseases, as well as early insect pests, ensuring better germination and vigorous initial growth.

**Recommended Process:**

1.  **Fungicidal Treatment:**
    *   To protect against seed-borne fungal diseases like blast and brown spot, and to prevent damping-off.
    *   Mix the seeds thoroughly with one of the following fungicides:
        *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP @ 2 grams per kg of seed.
        *   *Alternatively, for specific blast protection:* **Tricyclazole** 75% WP @ 2 grams per kg of seed.

2.  **Insecticidal Treatment:**
    *   To protect young seedlings from early sucking pests and shoot borers.
    *   After the fungicidal treatment, apply one of the following insecticides:
        *   **Imidacloprid** 70% WS @ 7 grams per kg of seed.
        *   *Alternatively:* **Thiamethoxam** 30% FS @ 3-4 ml per kg of seed.

3.  **Bio-fertilizer Treatment (Optional but Recommended):**
    *   To enhance nutrient availability and promote plant growth. Apply after chemical treatments.
    *   Mix the seeds with a suitable bio-fertilizer:
        *   **Azotobacter** (liquid formulation) @ 100 ml per 10 kg of seed.
        *   **PSB (Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria)** (liquid formulation) @ 100 ml per 10 kg of seed.
        *   *Alternatively, for bio-fungicidal action and growth promotion:* **Trichoderma viride** (powder formulation) @ 4 grams per kg of seed.

**Method of Application:**
Dissolve the required quantity of chemicals (fungicide and insecticide) in a small amount of water to make a slurry. Mix this slurry thoroughly with the seeds, ensuring uniform coating. For bio-fertilizers, mix them with a small amount of jaggery (gur) solution to help them stick to the seeds. Dry the treated seeds in shade before sowing. Sow treated seeds within 24 hours, especially if bio-fertilizers are used, to ensure their viability.

### Soil Treatment Process for Paddy (Dhan)

Soil treatment primarily focuses on managing early weeds and soil-borne pests, contributing to a healthy growing environment for the paddy crop.

**Recommended Process:**

1.  **Weed Management (Pre-emergence Herbicide):**
    *   To control a broad spectrum of weeds before they emerge, critical for both Direct Seeded Rice (DSR) and transplanted rice.
    *   Apply within 0-3 days after sowing (DAS) for DSR or 0-3 days after transplanting (DAT) for transplanted rice. Maintain a thin film of water (2-3 cm) in the field for 2-3 days after application.
        *   **Pretilachlor** 50% EC @ 500 ml per acre.
        *   *Alternatively:* **Pendimethalin** 30% EC @ 1.0-1.3 liters per acre.

2.  **Insect Pest Management (Granular Insecticide):**
    *   For effective control of early shoot borer and other soil-dwelling insect pests.
    *   Apply granular insecticide 15-20 days after transplanting/sowing. Ensure uniform broadcasting in standing water (2-3 cm) and maintain water for a few days.
        *   **Fipronil** 0.3% GR @ 7-10 kg per acre.
        *   *Alternatively:* **Cartap Hydrochloride** 4% GR @ 7.5-10 kg per acre.

3.  **Bio-agent Application (for Soil Health and Disease Suppression - Optional but Recommended):**
    *   To enhance soil health, suppress soil-borne pathogens, and improve nutrient cycling.
    *   Mix the bio-agent with 50 kg of well-decomposed Farmyard Manure (FYM) or compost and broadcast uniformly in the field before final puddling or sowing.
        *   **Trichoderma viride** (powder formulation) @ 2.5 kg per acre.
        *   *Alternatively:* **Pseudomonas fluorescens** (liquid formulation) @ 1-2 liters per acre.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions mentioned on the product label.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Ensure proper calibration of sprayers/applicators for accurate dosage.
*   Consult local agricultural extension services for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and current pest/disease pressure.
