As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following ideal transplantation time, distance, and process for Paddy (Dhan) in Haryana:

### Ideal Transplantation Time

The optimal window for paddy transplantation in Haryana is crucial for maximizing yield and efficient resource utilization, especially water.

*   **Mid-June to Early July:** The ideal period for transplanting paddy seedlings is generally from **June 20th to July 10th**. This timing aligns with the onset of the monsoon, ensuring adequate water availability and favorable climatic conditions for initial growth.
*   **Benefits of Timely Transplantation:** Transplanting within this window allows the crop to mature before the onset of severe winter, reduces the risk of pest and disease outbreaks associated with delayed planting, and optimizes the use of solar radiation during critical growth stages.

### Ideal Transplantation Distance

Proper spacing is vital for ensuring adequate light penetration, air circulation, nutrient uptake, and overall plant health, leading to higher yields.

*   **Row-to-Row Spacing:** Maintain a distance of **20 cm** between rows.
*   **Plant-to-Plant Spacing:** Maintain a distance of **15 cm** within the row.
*   **Overall Spacing:** This results in a **20 cm x 15 cm** spacing, which is ideal for most high-yielding paddy varieties grown in Haryana.
*   **Rationale:** This spacing allows for optimal plant population, reduces competition for resources, facilitates intercultural operations, and promotes better tillering. For very fertile soils or specific varieties, a slightly wider spacing like 20 cm x 20 cm might be considered, but 20 cm x 15 cm is generally recommended for high yields.

### Ideal Transplantation Process

A well-executed transplantation process sets the foundation for a healthy and productive paddy crop.

1.  **Nursery Preparation:**
    *   **Seedling Age:** Use healthy seedlings that are **21-25 days old** from the date of sowing in the nursery. Over-aged seedlings tend to have reduced tillering capacity and lower yields.
    *   **Hardening:** Gradually reduce irrigation in the nursery a few days before uprooting to harden the seedlings, making them more resilient to transplanting shock.

2.  **Main Field Preparation:**
    *   **Puddling:** Thoroughly puddle the field 1-2 days before transplanting. Puddling involves churning the soil with water to create a soft mud layer, which helps in weed control, reduces water percolation, and facilitates easy planting.
    *   **Leveling:** Ensure the field is perfectly leveled after puddling. Proper leveling is critical for uniform water distribution, nutrient availability, and consistent plant growth across the field.

3.  **Transplanting Method:**
    *   **Number of Seedlings per Hill:** Transplant **2-3 healthy seedlings** per hill. Using more seedlings per hill can lead to overcrowding and reduced tillering.
    *   **Depth of Planting:** Plant the seedlings at a shallow depth of **2-3 cm**. Deep planting can hinder tillering and root development.
    *   **Manual vs. Mechanical:** While manual transplanting is common, mechanical transplanters can ensure uniform spacing and depth, leading to better establishment and reduced labor costs.

4.  **Water Management Post-Transplantation:**
    *   Maintain a shallow water depth of **2-3 cm** in the field for the first 3-5 days after transplanting to help the seedlings establish and recover from transplanting shock.
    *   Subsequently, follow recommended irrigation schedules, typically maintaining a shallow water level or practicing intermittent irrigation based on soil type and weather conditions.
