Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I will provide scientifically verified advice for controlling smut diseases in Paddy (Dhan) in Haryana.

Let's address each smut disease you mentioned:

**1. Black Smut:**
This is not known to affect Paddy (Dhan). The term "Black Smut" is generally associated with other cereal crops like wheat and barley.

**2. False Smut (caused by *Ustilaginoidea virens*) and Kernel Smut (caused by *Tilletia barclayana* / *Neovossia horrida*):**
Both False Smut and Kernel Smut are significant diseases of Paddy in Haryana. Their management strategies are largely similar and focus on integrated approaches.

**Symptoms:**
*   **False Smut:** Transforms individual grains into large, velvety, greenish-black spore balls, often protruding from the glumes.
*   **Kernel Smut:** Affects only a few grains per panicle, turning them into black, powdery masses of spores, which may rupture the glumes.

**Control Measures:**

**A. Cultural Practices (Preventive and Management):**
1.  **Resistant Varieties:** Cultivate paddy varieties known to be resistant or tolerant to these smut diseases. Consult your local Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or HAU experts for recommended varieties for your region.
2.  **Seed Treatment:** While these smuts are primarily floral infections, using certified disease-free seeds is crucial. Although seed treatment is less effective for direct control of these specific smuts, it helps manage other seed-borne pathogens.
3.  **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive application of nitrogenous fertilizers, especially during the reproductive stages of the crop. Balanced fertilization is key.
4.  **Field Sanitation:**
    *   Remove and destroy infected panicles or plants from the field to reduce the inoculum source.
    *   After harvest, deep ploughing helps bury infected plant debris and spores, reducing their survival for the next season.
5.  **Water Management:** Maintain proper irrigation schedules and avoid prolonged periods of high humidity, especially during the flowering stage, as these conditions favour disease development.

**B. Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
Fungicide application is most effective when done preventively at the **booting stage to early panicle emergence** (when the flag leaf emerges and the panicle is still enclosed within the leaf sheath). This timing is critical as the infection occurs during flowering.

Recommended CIBRC approved technical chemicals for foliar spray:

*   **Propiconazole** (25% EC) at 200 ml per acre in 200 litres of water.
*   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC) at 200 ml per acre in 200 litres of water.
*   **Trifloxystrobin** (25% WG) + **Tebuconazole** (50% WG) (as a pre-mix formulation) at 80 g per acre in 200 litres of water.
*   **Difenoconazole** (25% EC) at 100 ml per acre in 200 litres of water.

**Important Note:** Always read the label instructions carefully before using any chemical and follow the recommended dosage and safety precautions.

**3. Loose Smut:**
This is not known to affect Paddy (Dhan). Loose smut is a major disease primarily of wheat and barley.
