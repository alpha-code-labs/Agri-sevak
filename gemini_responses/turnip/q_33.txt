Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an integrated approach for effective weed management in Turnip (Shalgam) fields. This involves a combination of cultural practices and judicious use of scientifically verified chemical methods, keeping in mind the sensitivity of Turnip (a Brassica crop) to many herbicides.

**I. Cultural and Mechanical Weed Control:**

*   **Timely Sowing:** Sow Turnip at the optimal time to allow the crop to establish quickly and outcompete weeds.
*   **Thorough Seedbed Preparation:** Proper land preparation helps in reducing the initial weed flush.
*   **Use Clean Seeds:** Always use certified, weed-free Turnip seeds to prevent the introduction of weed seeds, especially those of parasitic weeds like Amarbail and Orobanche.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Implement crop rotation with non-host crops (e.g., cereals like wheat or barley for Orobanche) to reduce the weed seed bank in the soil over time.
*   **Manual Weeding/Hoeing:** This is a highly effective method, particularly for broadleaf weeds and for early removal of parasitic weeds. Perform 1-2 manual weedings, typically around 20-30 and 40-50 days after sowing, depending on weed pressure.

**II. Chemical Weed Control:**

**A. For Broadleaf Weeds (e.g., Bathu, Congress grass) and Narrowleaf Weeds (e.g., Phalaris minor):**

1.  **Pre-Emergence (PRE) Application (within 0-3 days of sowing):**
    *   Apply **Pendimethalin** 30% EC at 3.3 litres per acre in 200-300 litres of water. This herbicide provides good control of germinating broadleaf and narrowleaf weeds. Ensure uniform spray and adequate soil moisture for optimal efficacy.

2.  **Post-Emergence (POST) Application:**
    *   **For Narrowleaf Weeds (Grasses like Phalaris minor):**
        *   Apply **Quizalofop-ethyl** 5% EC at 1.0 litre per acre in 200-300 litres of water, when weeds are at the 2-4 leaf stage (typically 20-30 days after sowing).
        *   Alternatively, apply **Fluazifop-P-butyl** 12.5% EC at 0.5-0.75 litres per acre in 200-300 litres of water, when weeds are at the 2-4 leaf stage.
        *   Alternatively, apply **Clethodim** 24% EC at 250-300 ml per acre in 200-300 litres of water, when weeds are at the 2-4 leaf stage.
    *   **For Broadleaf Weeds (e.g., Bathu, Congress grass):**
        *   **There are no CIBRC approved post-emergence herbicides specifically recommended for broadleaf weed control in Turnip without significant risk of phytotoxicity to the crop.** Therefore, manual weeding remains the safest and most effective option for controlling broadleaf weeds after a pre-emergence application.

**B. For Parasitic Weeds:**

1.  **Amarbail (Cuscuta spp.):**
    *   **Prevention is key:** Use clean, certified seeds. Avoid using farmyard manure or irrigation water contaminated with Amarbail seeds.
    *   **Pre-emergence:** **Pendimethalin** applied as a pre-emergence herbicide can offer some suppression of Amarbail germination.
    *   **Post-emergence:** Once Amarbail has attached to the Turnip plant, chemical control is extremely difficult without harming the crop. **Manual removal** of infested Turnip plants or cutting the Amarbail strands before they produce seeds is the most practical approach to prevent further spread and reduce the seed bank.

2.  **Orobanche (Broomrape):**
    *   **Prevention is paramount:** Use clean seeds. Implement long crop rotations with non-host crops (e.g., cereals like wheat, barley) for several years to deplete the Orobanche seed bank. Solarization of soil during summer can also help in reducing the seed bank.
    *   **Chemical Control:** **There are no CIBRC approved post-emergence herbicides specifically recommended for Orobanche control in Turnip without severe phytotoxicity to the crop.** Manual removal of Orobanche shoots before they flower and set seeds is critical to prevent seed dispersal and reduce future infestations. Ensure the removed shoots are destroyed away from the field.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and strictly follow the label instructions of the herbicide carefully.
*   Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application.
*   Ensure proper calibration of spray equipment for accurate dosage and uniform coverage.
*   Apply herbicides when there is adequate soil moisture for optimal efficacy.
*   Avoid spraying during windy conditions to prevent herbicide drift to non-target areas or crops.
