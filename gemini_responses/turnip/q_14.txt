As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified strategies for controlling soil pests like Termites and Root-knot Nematodes in Turnip cultivation in Haryana.

### General Soil Pest Management Principles

Effective management of soil pests requires an integrated approach combining cultural practices, biological methods, and judicious use of CIBRC-approved chemical pesticides.

### 1. Termites (Dimag)

Termites are polyphagous pests that can cause significant damage to Turnip roots, leading to wilting, stunted growth, and ultimately plant death.

**Symptoms:**
*   Hollowing of roots and underground stem.
*   Presence of earthen runways on the plant base or in the soil.
*   Sudden wilting and drying of plants, especially during dry periods.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove all crop residues, stubble, and woody debris from the field before sowing, as these can serve as food sources and breeding sites for termites.
    *   **Deep Ploughing:** Expose termite colonies to predators and sunlight by deep ploughing during summer.
    *   **Irrigation:** Maintain adequate soil moisture, as termites prefer dry conditions.
    *   **Farmyard Manure (FYM):** Ensure well-decomposed FYM is used, as undecomposed organic matter can attract termites.

*   **Chemical Control (Pre-sowing/At Sowing):**
    *   For effective control, soil treatment before or at the time of sowing is crucial.
    *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC:** Apply 2.5 litres per acre mixed with 200-400 litres of water and drench the soil, or mix with 20-25 kg of sand and broadcast evenly before the last ploughing, followed by light irrigation.
    *   **Fipronil 0.3% GR:** Apply 6-8 kg per acre at the time of sowing by broadcasting and incorporating into the soil.

### 2. Nematodes (Root-knot Nematodes - *Meloidogyne* spp.)

Root-knot nematodes are microscopic roundworms that infect the roots of Turnip, causing characteristic galls or knots, which impair water and nutrient uptake. Turnip is highly susceptible to root-knot nematodes.

**Symptoms:**
*   Presence of galls or knots on the roots, varying in size.
*   Stunted plant growth, yellowing of leaves (chlorosis), and premature wilting, especially during hot periods.
*   Reduced yield and poor quality of roots.
*   Increased susceptibility to other root diseases.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate Turnip with non-host crops like cereals (wheat, maize, sorghum) for at least 2-3 years. Avoid continuous cultivation of susceptible crops.
    *   **Summer Ploughing/Solarization:** Deep ploughing during hot summer months exposes nematodes to lethal temperatures and desiccation. Soil solarization (covering moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks during summer) can significantly reduce nematode populations.
    *   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporate well-decomposed Farmyard Manure (FYM) or compost at 10-15 tonnes per acre.
    *   **Neem Cake:** Apply **Neem Cake** at 200-400 kg per acre and incorporate into the soil 2-3 weeks before sowing. Neem cake releases compounds that are toxic to nematodes and also enhances beneficial microbial activity.

*   **Chemical Control (Pre-sowing/At Sowing):**
    *   Chemical nematicides can be used as a targeted approach, especially in fields with a history of severe nematode infestation.
    *   **Carbofuran 3% G:** Apply 10-13 kg per acre at the time of sowing by broadcasting and incorporating into the soil.
    *   **Phorate 10% G:** Apply 4 kg per acre at the time of sowing by broadcasting and incorporating into the soil.

### Important Precautions:

*   Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the pesticide label regarding dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, and protective clothing during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Store pesticides safely, away from food, feed, and out of reach of children and livestock.
*   Dispose of empty pesticide containers properly as per local regulations.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions.
