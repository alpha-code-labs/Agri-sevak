Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I advise that addressing micronutrient deficiencies in Turnip (Shalgam) is crucial for healthy growth and good yield. The first and most important step is always to conduct a soil test to accurately diagnose the specific deficiency and its severity. This allows for targeted and efficient application of nutrients.

Here's how to address the common micronutrient deficiencies in Turnip:

### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms in Turnip:** Stunted growth, small and narrow leaves, interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, and sometimes a rosetted appearance.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray a 0.5% solution of **Zinc sulfate heptahydrate** (21% Zn) at a rate of 5 grams per litre of water. Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, starting 3-4 weeks after sowing or at the appearance of symptoms.
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 10-25 kg/acre of **Zinc sulfate heptahydrate** (21% Zn) or 5-10 kg/acre of **Zinc sulfate monohydrate** (33% Zn) as a basal application at the time of sowing.

### 2. Iron (Fe) / Ferrous Deficiency

*   **Symptoms in Turnip:** Severe interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, which may turn almost white while the veins remain green. Overall stunted growth. This is common in high pH soils of Haryana.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application (Preferred):** Spray a 0.5-1.0% solution of **Ferrous sulfate heptahydrate** (19% Fe) (5-10 grams per litre of water) or a 0.1% solution of **Iron EDTA** (12% Fe) (1 gram per litre of water). Apply 2-3 sprays at 7-10 day intervals, focusing on the young leaves showing symptoms. Foliar application is generally more effective for iron deficiency in high pH soils.
    *   **Soil Application:** Generally not recommended for iron in high pH soils of Haryana due to rapid fixation.

### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms in Turnip:** This is a critical deficiency for root crops like turnip, leading to "Brown heart" or "water core" (internal browning and watery areas) in the roots, hollow stems, stunted growth, distorted leaves, and poor root development.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray a 0.1-0.2% solution of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (20% B) (1-2 grams per litre of water) or a 0.2-0.3% solution of **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate, 11% B) (2-3 grams per litre of water). Apply 1-2 sprays, with the first at 3-4 weeks after sowing and the second at the root initiation stage.
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 1-2 kg/acre of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (20% B) or 2-4 kg/acre of **Borax** (11% B) as a basal application at sowing. **Caution:** Boron can be toxic if over-applied; adhere strictly to recommended doses.

### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms in Turnip:** Stunted growth, distorted or curled young leaves, marginal necrosis (death of tissue) on young leaves, and poor root development.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray a 0.5-1.0% solution of **Calcium chloride** (27% Ca) (5-10 grams per litre of water) or **Calcium nitrate** (19% Ca) (5-10 grams per litre of water). Apply 2-3 sprays during active growth.
    *   **Soil Application:** If soil test indicates severe deficiency, 200-400 kg/acre of **Gypsum** (Calcium sulfate dihydrate, 23% Ca) can be applied as a soil amendment, especially in sodic soils. For direct calcium supply, 50-100 kg/acre of **Calcium nitrate** (19% Ca) can be used.

### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms in Turnip:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves (yellowing between veins while veins remain green), leaves may become brittle or purplish.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray a 0.5-1.0% solution of **Magnesium sulfate heptahydrate** (9.6% Mg) (5-10 grams per litre of water). Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals.
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 10-20 kg/acre of **Magnesium sulfate heptahydrate** (9.6% Mg) as a basal application.

### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms in Turnip:** Interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, often appearing as a "netting" pattern, sometimes with small necrotic spots. Overall stunted growth.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray a 0.5% solution of **Manganese sulfate monohydrate** (30.5% Mn) (5 grams per litre of water). Apply 2-3 sprays at 7-10 day intervals, especially on younger leaves.
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 10-20 kg/acre of **Manganese sulfate monohydrate** (30.5% Mn) as a basal application at sowing, particularly in light-textured soils.

Always ensure thorough coverage during foliar sprays and apply during cooler parts of the day to prevent scorching. For soil applications, proper mixing with the soil is essential. Regular soil testing every 2-3 years is recommended to maintain optimal nutrient levels.
