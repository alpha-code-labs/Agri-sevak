As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding Turnip maturity, harvesting, and cutting processes for Haryana.

### Turnip (Brassica rapa subsp. rapa)

**Maturity Signs:**

*   **Root Size:** The primary indicator of maturity is the size of the root. Turnips are typically ready for harvest when their roots reach a diameter of **5 to 8 cm**, depending on the variety. Harvesting at this stage ensures optimal tenderness and flavor.
*   **Root Appearance:** The roots should appear smooth, firm, and well-formed.
*   **Foliage:** The leaves should be healthy, green, and vigorous. While not a direct indicator of root maturity, healthy foliage suggests a well-growing plant.
*   **Days After Sowing (DAS):** Depending on the variety and prevailing climatic conditions in Haryana, turnips generally mature within **45 to 70 days** after sowing. However, root size is a more reliable indicator than DAS alone.

**Harvesting Time:**

*   **Optimal Size:** Harvest turnips when they reach the desired size (5-8 cm diameter) to prevent them from becoming woody, fibrous, or developing an overly pungent flavor, which can occur if left in the ground too long.
*   **Continuous Harvest:** For home gardens or smaller plots, a continuous harvest can be practiced by pulling the largest roots first, allowing the smaller ones to continue growing.
*   **Time of Day:** It is advisable to harvest turnips during the cooler parts of the day, such as **early morning or late evening**. This helps in maintaining the turgidity and freshness of the roots, improving their post-harvest quality and shelf life.
*   **Season:** In Haryana, turnips are a cool-season (Rabi) crop. Harvesting typically occurs from late autumn through winter into early spring, depending on the sowing schedule.

**Cutting Process (Harvesting Method):**

1.  **Grasp the Foliage:** Firmly grasp the base of the turnip leaves, close to the soil line.
2.  **Pull Gently:** Pull the entire plant gently but firmly upwards from the soil. If the soil is very compact, you may need to loosen the soil around the root with a small hand trowel or spade to prevent damage to the root.
3.  **Trim Leaves:** After pulling, trim the leaves approximately **2 to 3 cm** above the root crown. Leaving a small portion of the stem helps in better storage. The trimmed leaves can be used as greens if desired.
4.  **Trim Taproot:** If the taproot (the main root extending below the bulbous part) is excessively long, it can be trimmed, leaving a short stub.
5.  **Handle with Care:** Handle the harvested roots carefully to avoid bruising, cuts, or abrasions, as these can reduce storage life and make them susceptible to spoilage.
6.  **Clean:** Gently shake off any excess soil from the roots. Avoid washing them until just before use or sale, as moisture can promote spoilage during storage.
