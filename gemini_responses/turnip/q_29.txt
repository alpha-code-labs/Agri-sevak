This is not known to affect Turnip.

The terms "Flower drop," "Fruit drop," and "Tinda/Boll dropping" are not typically associated with Turnip (Brassica rapa subsp. rapa) as a significant physiological disorder or pest/disease issue, especially when grown for its edible root.

*   **Tinda/Boll dropping** is entirely irrelevant to Turnip. Tinda is a gourd, and boll dropping refers to cotton.
*   **Fruit drop** in Turnip would refer to the dropping of seed pods (siliques). This is generally only a concern if the Turnip is being grown specifically for seed production, not for its root.
*   **Flower drop** can occur in Turnip, often as a symptom of general plant stress (e.g., extreme temperatures, water stress, nutrient deficiencies, or pest damage) rather than a specific condition requiring direct control for "dropping." For root production, flower development is secondary, and flower drop does not directly impact the root yield.
