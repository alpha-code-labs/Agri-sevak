As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Scab, Canker, Gummosis, and Lichen in Turnip in Haryana:

### Scab in Turnip

**Cause:** Primarily caused by the bacterium *Streptomyces scabies*.
**Symptoms:** Superficial, corky lesions or pitted areas on the turnip root surface, which can reduce marketability and storage quality.
**Control Measures:**
*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Practice crop rotation with non-host crops (e.g., cereals) for at least 3-4 years.
    *   Maintain soil pH slightly acidic (below 6.0) as alkaline soils favor scab development.
    *   Ensure adequate soil moisture during root development, as dry conditions can exacerbate scab.
    *   Use disease-free seeds/planting material.
    *   Incorporate organic matter into the soil, which can help suppress the disease.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   No highly effective chemical treatments are available for *Streptomyces scabies* once the infection is established in the field. Preventative measures are key.

### Canker in Turnip

**Cause:** Primarily caused by the fungus *Phoma lingam* (also known as *Leptosphaeria maculans*), leading to Blackleg and Canker disease.
**Symptoms:** Dark lesions on leaves, often with grey centers and black dots (pycnidia). Stem cankers develop near the soil line, which can girdle the stem, leading to wilting, lodging, and plant death.
**Control Measures:**
*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Practice crop rotation with non-Brassica crops for at least 3-4 years to break the disease cycle.
    *   Use certified disease-free seeds.
    *   Remove and destroy infected crop residues immediately after harvest, as the fungus can survive on them.
    *   Avoid planting turnips in fields where Brassica crops were recently grown.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Seed Treatment:**
        *   Treat seeds with a fungicide mixture before sowing:
            *   **Carbendazim** 1 g/kg seed + **Thiram** 2 g/kg seed.
    *   **Foliar Spray (if early symptoms appear and disease pressure is high):**
        *   Apply fungicides at 10-15 day intervals, depending on disease severity:
            *   **Mancozeb** 2.5 g/L water, or
            *   **Chlorothalonil** 2 g/L water.

### Gummosis in Turnip

This is not known to affect Turnip. Gummosis is a condition primarily observed in woody plants and fruit trees, characterized by the exudation of gum, often in response to disease or stress. Turnips are root vegetables and do not exhibit this symptom.

### Lichen in Turnip

This is not known to affect Turnip as a disease or pest. Lichens are symbiotic organisms (a fungus and an alga or cyanobacterium) that grow on surfaces like tree bark, rocks, or soil. They are not parasitic and do not cause disease or damage to turnip plants.
