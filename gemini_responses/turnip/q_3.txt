Namaste, Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding various rot diseases in Turnip. Effective management requires an integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods.

Here's a detailed guide to control rot types affecting Turnip:

### General Management Principles for Rot Diseases in Turnip:

These practices are crucial for preventing and managing most rot diseases:

1.  **Crop Rotation:** Practice a 3-4 year rotation with non-cruciferous crops (e.g., cereals, maize) to break the disease cycle and reduce pathogen build-up in the soil.
2.  **Soil Health & Drainage:**
    *   Ensure good soil drainage to prevent waterlogging, which favors many rot pathogens.
    *   Incorporate organic matter to improve soil structure and microbial activity.
    *   Avoid planting in low-lying areas prone to water accumulation.
3.  **Sanitation:**
    *   Remove and destroy infected plant debris immediately from the field.
    *   Clean farm tools and equipment to prevent disease spread.
4.  **Seed Quality:** Use certified, disease-free seeds from reputable sources.
5.  **Proper Spacing:** Maintain adequate plant spacing to ensure good air circulation, which reduces humidity around the plants.
6.  **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced fertilizers. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can lead to lush, soft growth more susceptible to disease.
7.  **Weed Control:** Manage weeds effectively as they can act as alternative hosts for pathogens and impede air circulation.
8.  **Soil Solarization:** In summer, cover moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks to reduce soil-borne pathogen inoculum.

### Specific Rot Types and Their Control in Turnip:

#### 1. Seed Rot & Seedling Rot (Damping-off)

These are common issues in Turnip, primarily caused by soil-borne fungi like *Pythium spp.*, *Rhizoctonia solani*, and *Fusarium spp.*

*   **Symptoms:** Seeds fail to germinate (seed rot), or seedlings emerge but collapse at the soil line (damping-off).
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Cultural:**
        *   Ensure optimal soil moisture and temperature for rapid germination.
        *   Avoid deep sowing.
        *   Prepare raised beds for better drainage.
    *   **Biological:**
        *   Treat seeds with *Trichoderma viride* or *Trichoderma harzianum* at 4-5 g/kg seed.
        *   Apply *Trichoderma viride* or *Trichoderma harzianum* to the soil at 2.5 kg/acre mixed with 50 kg farmyard manure (FYM) before sowing.
    *   **Chemical (Seed Treatment):**
        *   **Thiram** at 2-3 g/kg seed.
        *   **Carbendazim** at 1-2 g/kg seed.
        *   **Metalaxyl-M** at 1-2 g/kg seed (especially effective against *Pythium*).
        *   **Fludioxonil** at 1-2 g/kg seed.
        *   A combination of **Carbendazim + Thiram** (1:1 ratio) at 2-3 g/kg seed is also effective.

#### 2. Root Rot, Stem Rot, Foot Rot, Collar Rot, Crown Rot, Neck Rot

These terms often describe similar disease complexes affecting the plant at or below the soil line, caused by pathogens like *Rhizoctonia solani*, *Pythium spp.*, *Sclerotinia sclerotiorum*, and *Fusarium spp.*

*   **Symptoms:** Lesions or rotting at the root, stem base, collar, or crown region. Affected plants show wilting, yellowing, stunting, and eventually collapse. Roots may become discolored and mushy. *Sclerotinia* causes white, cottony growth with black sclerotia.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Cultural:**
        *   Implement all general management principles mentioned above, especially crop rotation and good drainage.
        *   Avoid mechanical injury to roots and stems during cultivation.
        *   Hilling up soil around the base of plants can sometimes help.
    *   **Biological:**
        *   Soil application of *Trichoderma viride* or *Trichoderma harzianum* at 2.5 kg/acre mixed with 50 kg FYM at the time of planting or as a drench.
    *   **Chemical (Soil Drench/Application):**
        *   Drench the soil around the base of affected plants with:
            *   **Propamocarb Hydrochloride** at 2-3 ml/L water.
            *   **Metalaxyl-M** at 1-2 g/L water.
            *   **Carbendazim** at 1-2 g/L water.
            *   **Validamycin** at 2-3 ml/L water (specifically for *Rhizoctonia*).
            *   **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5-1 ml/L water.
            *   **Tebuconazole** at 0.5-1 ml/L water.
        *   Repeat application if necessary, following label instructions.

#### 3. Black Rot

This is a serious bacterial disease of crucifers, caused by *Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris*.

*   **Symptoms:** V-shaped yellow lesions at the leaf margins, which progress inwards, turning black. The veins within the lesions also turn black. Systemic infection can lead to blackening of vascular tissues in the stem and roots, causing wilting and eventual plant death.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Cultural:**
        *   Use disease-free seeds. Hot water treatment of seeds (50°C for 25-30 minutes) can reduce seed-borne inoculum, but test a small batch first for viability.
        *   Strict crop rotation (at least 3 years) with non-cruciferous crops.
        *   Remove and destroy all infected plant debris.
        *   Avoid overhead irrigation, which can spread bacteria.
    *   **Chemical (Foliar Spray/Drench):**
        *   Spray with a combination of **Streptomycin Sulphate + Tetracycline Hydrochloride** at 6 g/10 L water.
        *   Spray with **Copper Oxychloride** at 2.5-3 g/L water.
        *   Start sprays preventively or at the first sign of symptoms.

#### 4. Fruit Rot

This is not known to affect Turnip, as Turnip is a root vegetable, not a fruit.

Always consult with your local HAU extension specialist for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and the prevailing disease pressure. Adhere strictly to the dosage and safety precautions mentioned on the chemical labels.
