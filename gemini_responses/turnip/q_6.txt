As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding viral diseases in Turnip for Haryana.

It is important to understand that there are no direct chemical cures for viral diseases once a plant is infected. Control strategies primarily focus on preventing infection by managing the insect vectors that transmit the viruses and implementing sound cultural practices.

Let's address each condition you've mentioned:

*   **Leaf curl:** Turnip Leaf Curl Virus (TuLCV) is a significant viral disease affecting turnip, transmitted by whiteflies.
*   **Mosaic:** Turnip Mosaic Virus (TuMV) is a very common and widespread virus in turnip, transmitted by aphids.
*   **Yellow vein clearing:** This is a common symptom associated with various viral infections in turnip, including Turnip Mosaic Virus (TuMV).
*   **Stunt virus:** While "stunt virus" is a general term for viruses causing stunted growth, specific viruses like TuMV and Turnip Yellows Virus (TuYV) can cause stunting in turnip.
*   **Stripe:** This is not known to affect Turnip.
*   **Tristeza:** This is not known to affect Turnip.

For the viral diseases that affect Turnip (Leaf curl, Mosaic, Yellow vein clearing, and Stunting caused by these viruses), the control measures are as follows:

### Control Measures for Viral Diseases in Turnip

**1. Cultural Practices:**

*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available, choose turnip varieties known to have resistance or tolerance to common viral diseases in the region. Consult with local agricultural extension for recommended varieties for Haryana.
*   **Healthy Seeds:** Use certified, virus-free seeds from reputable sources.
*   **Roguing:** Regularly inspect the field and promptly remove and destroy (bury or burn away from the field) any plants showing symptoms of viral infection (e.g., curling, mosaic patterns, yellowing, stunting). This helps reduce the source of inoculum.
*   **Weed Management:** Control weeds in and around the turnip field, as many weeds can act as alternative hosts for both the viruses and their insect vectors.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops to break the disease cycle.
*   **Timely Sowing:** Adjust sowing dates to avoid peak periods of vector activity, if possible.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Maintain good field hygiene to minimize pest and disease reservoirs.

**2. Vector Management (Insect Control):**

Since these viruses are primarily transmitted by insect vectors (aphids for Mosaic and Yellows, whiteflies for Leaf Curl), controlling these vectors is crucial for preventing the spread of the disease.

**For Aphids (Vectors of Mosaic and Yellows Viruses):**

*   **Early Detection:** Regularly monitor turnip plants for the presence of aphids, especially on the undersides of leaves and growing tips.
*   **Chemical Control:** If aphid populations are building up, apply CIBRC-approved insecticides. Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** 0.5 - 1.0 ml per litre of water (or 100-125 ml per acre).
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** 0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water (or 50-100 g per acre).
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** 0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water (or 50-100 g per acre).
    *   **Flonicamid 50% WG:** 0.3 g per litre of water (or 60 g per acre).

**For Whiteflies (Vectors of Leaf Curl Virus):**

*   **Early Detection:** Monitor for whiteflies, particularly on the undersides of leaves. Yellow sticky traps can be used for monitoring and mass trapping.
*   **Chemical Control:** Apply CIBRC-approved insecticides when whitefly populations are observed.
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** 1.25 ml per litre of water (or 250-300 ml per acre).
    *   **Diafenthiuron 50% WP:** 0.6 g per litre of water (or 150-200 g per acre).
    *   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** 0.6 ml per litre of water (or 120 ml per acre).
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** 0.5 - 1.0 ml per litre of water (or 100-125 ml per acre). (Effective against both aphids and whiteflies).

**Important Considerations for Chemical Application:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label carefully, including dosage, application method, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Ensure thorough coverage of the plant, especially the undersides of leaves where pests often reside.
*   Use appropriate safety gear during application.
*   Consult with your local HAU extension specialist for the most current and specific recommendations for your area and crop stage.
