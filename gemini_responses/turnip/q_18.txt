As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the use of Ethrel, 2,4-D, and Boron in Turnip cultivation for Haryana.

It is crucial to understand the specific roles and potential impacts of these substances on Turnip, an edible root crop.

1.  **Ethrel (Ethephon)**
    *   **Technical Chemical Name:** **Ethephon**
    *   **Recommendation:** This is not known to affect Turnip in a beneficial way for root production. **Ethephon** is primarily an ethylene-releasing compound used for fruit ripening, flower induction, or defoliation in other crops. Its application to Turnip for root development is not recommended and could lead to undesirable effects such as premature senescence or altered root quality.

2.  **2,4-D**
    *   **Technical Chemical Name:** **2,4-D** (2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid)
    *   **Recommendation:** This is not known to affect Turnip as a beneficial growth regulator for root production. **2,4-D** is a synthetic auxin primarily used as a selective herbicide to control broadleaf weeds. Even at very low concentrations, its application to an edible root crop like Turnip carries a significant risk of phytotoxicity, malformation, or residue issues, making it unsuitable and unsafe for this purpose.

3.  **Boron**
    *   **Technical Chemical Names:** **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate) or **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate**
    *   **Recommendation:** Boron is an essential micronutrient for Turnip. Deficiency can lead to internal browning, "water core," and hollow heart, severely affecting root quality and marketability. Therefore, Boron application is recommended, especially in soils known to be deficient or if symptoms appear.
        *   **Foliar Application (Recommended for Turnip):**
            *   **Formulation:** Use a soluble Boron source like **Borax** (10.5-11.3% Boron) or **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (20% Boron).
            *   **Dose:**
                *   For **Borax**: Prepare a 0.1% to 0.2% solution (1 to 2 grams per litre of water).
                *   For **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate**: Prepare a 0.05% to 0.1% solution (0.5 to 1 gram per litre of water).
            *   **Timing:** Apply two foliar sprays. The first spray should be given at the 3-4 true leaf stage, and the second spray 15-20 days later. Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.
        *   **Soil Application (If severe deficiency is confirmed by soil test):**
            *   **Formulation:** **Borax**
            *   **Dose:** 4-6 kg per acre, mixed thoroughly with soil at the time of land preparation or sowing. However, foliar application is generally preferred for Turnip to ensure efficient uptake and avoid potential toxicity from excessive soil application.

Always ensure proper safety measures are followed during the handling and application of any agricultural chemicals. Consult your local agricultural extension office for specific soil test-based recommendations for your farm.
