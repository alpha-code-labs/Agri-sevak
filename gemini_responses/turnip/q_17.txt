As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend the following doses for organic manures in Turnip cultivation, keeping in mind the soil health and nutrient requirements for optimal yield in Haryana:

It is crucial to incorporate these organic manures thoroughly into the soil during land preparation, ideally 2-3 weeks before sowing, to allow for decomposition and nutrient release.

*   **Farmyard Manure (FYM):**
    *   **Recommended Dose:** 15-20 tonnes per acre
    *   **Application:** Apply well-decomposed FYM during land preparation and mix thoroughly into the soil. This improves soil structure, water retention, and provides a slow-release source of macro and micronutrients.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   **Recommended Dose:** 4-6 tonnes per acre
    *   **Application:** Apply vermicompost during land preparation and incorporate it into the soil. Vermicompost is richer in nutrients than FYM and also contains beneficial microbes that enhance nutrient availability.

*   **Sagarika (IFFCO):**
    *   **Recommended Dose & Application:** Sagarika is a seaweed extract-based bio-stimulant and is typically applied as a foliar spray or soil drench, not as a bulk manure.
        *   **Foliar Spray:** 2-3 ml per litre of water. Apply 2-3 sprays during the crop cycle:
            *   First spray: 20-25 days after sowing.
            *   Second spray: 40-45 days after sowing (at root development stage).
            *   Third spray (optional): If nutrient deficiency or stress is observed.
        *   **Soil Drench/Drip Application:** 1-2 litres per acre, mixed with irrigation water. This can be done during critical growth stages to enhance root development and nutrient uptake.

These recommendations aim to provide a balanced approach to nutrient management, promoting healthy turnip growth and sustainable soil fertility. Always ensure the FYM and vermicompost are well-decomposed to avoid issues with pests and diseases.
