Scale insects and Mealybugs can be significant pests in Turnip cultivation, causing stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, and reduced yield by sucking sap from the plants. Effective management requires an integrated approach.

Here's how you can control them:

**I. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Approach:**

1.  **Regular Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your turnip plants, especially the undersides of leaves, leaf axils, and stems, for early signs of these pests.
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy severely infested plants or plant parts to prevent further spread.
    *   **Weed Control:** Keep the field free of weeds, as they can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
    *   **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to improve air circulation, which can deter pest build-up.
3.  **Mechanical Control:**
    *   For small infestations, physically remove mealybugs by hand or dislodge them with a strong jet of water.
    *   Use a soft brush or cloth dipped in soapy water to wipe off scale insects from stems and leaves.
4.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Encourage natural enemies like ladybird beetles (coccinellids), lacewings, and parasitic wasps, which prey on mealybugs and scale insects. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

**II. Chemical Control (When necessary):**

If the infestation is severe and cultural/mechanical methods are insufficient, chemical control may be required. Always follow the recommended dosage and safety precautions. Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and stems, as these pests are often hidden. Adding a spreading agent/sticker to the spray solution can improve efficacy.

Here are some CIBRC approved technical chemical options:

*   **For Scale Insects and Mealybugs:**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at a rate of **0.5 ml per liter of water** (or **200 ml per acre** in 400 liters of water).
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at a rate of **1.25 ml per liter of water** (or **500 ml per acre** in 400 liters of water). This is an insect growth regulator, effective against nymphs.
    *   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:** Apply at a rate of **0.75 ml per liter of water** (or **300 ml per acre** in 400 liters of water). This is a systemic insecticide with good translaminar action.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Rotation of Chemicals:** To prevent the development of pesticide resistance, rotate insecticides with different modes of action.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always observe the specified pre-harvest interval (PHI) for each chemical to ensure the safety of the produce.
*   **Safety:** Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) like gloves, masks, and protective clothing while handling and spraying chemicals.
*   **Spray Coverage:** Ensure complete and thorough coverage of the plant, especially the hidden parts where these pests reside.
