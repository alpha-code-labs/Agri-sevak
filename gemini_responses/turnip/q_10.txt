Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing these pests in Turnip cultivation in Haryana.

It is crucial to adopt an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods for sustainable and effective control.

### General IPM Principles for Turnip:

*   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting turnip or other brassicas in the same field consecutively.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy crop residues after harvest to reduce pest carryover.
*   **Timely Sowing:** Adhere to recommended sowing dates to avoid peak pest infestations.
*   **Monitoring:** Regularly scout your fields to detect pests early and take timely action.

### Specific Control Measures:

#### 1. Borers (Primarily Cabbage Root Fly - *Delia radicum*)

For Turnip, the most significant "borer" pest is typically the Cabbage Root Fly, whose larvae bore into the roots, causing wilting and stunted growth.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Deep ploughing after harvest to expose pupae.
    *   Use of physical barriers like collars around the base of young plants (for transplanted crops).
*   **Chemical Control (Soil Application/Drenching):**
    *   At sowing or transplanting, apply granular insecticides or drench the soil around the root zone.
    *   **Fipronil** 0.3% GR: 10-15 kg/acre, applied in the soil at sowing/transplanting.
    *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: 2.5 L/acre, mixed with irrigation water or as a drench around the root zone.

#### 2. Caterpillars, Diamondback Moth (DBM), and Leaf Folder

These pests are primarily lepidopteran larvae that feed on foliage. Diamondback Moth (*Plutella xylostella*) is a particularly notorious pest of brassicas due to its rapid life cycle and tendency to develop insecticide resistance. "Leaf folder" refers to caterpillars that fold or web leaves together to feed inside.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Hand-picking of visible caterpillars and egg masses in small areas.
    *   Installation of bird perches in the field to encourage predatory birds.
    *   Use of pheromone traps for monitoring and mass trapping of male moths (e.g., for DBM, *Spodoptera litura*).
*   **Biological Control:**
    *   Application of bio-pesticides containing *Bacillus thuringiensis* (Bt) formulations. These are effective against young larvae.
        *   **Bacillus thuringiensis** (Bt) (various strains like kurstaki, aizawai): As per product label, typically 1-2 kg/acre or 2-4 g/L of water.
*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
    *   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development, especially for DBM.
    *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG: 80-100 g/acre (0.4-0.5 g/L of water).
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC: 60 ml/acre (0.3 ml/L of water).
    *   **Flubendiamide** 20% WG: 50 g/acre (0.25 g/L of water).
    *   **Spinosad** 45% SC: 60-75 ml/acre (0.3-0.375 ml/L of water).
    *   **Indoxacarb** 14.5% SC: 200 ml/acre (1 ml/L of water).
    *   **Novaluron** 10% EC: 300 ml/acre (1.5 ml/L of water) - an insect growth regulator, effective on young larvae.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the insecticide label regarding dosage, application method, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where pests often hide.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer for the most current recommendations and pest situations in your specific area of Haryana.
