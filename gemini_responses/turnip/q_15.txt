As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the specified pests in Turnip cultivation in Haryana:

### Control of Pests in Turnip

**1. Grasshopper**
Grasshoppers are general feeders and can cause significant damage to young turnip plants by chewing leaves.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Keep the field and surrounding areas free of weeds, which can serve as breeding grounds and alternate hosts.
    *   For small infestations, hand-picking and destroying grasshoppers can be effective.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Malathion** 50% EC: 2-3 ml per litre of water, or 1.0 - 1.5 litres per acre.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: 0.4-0.5 ml per litre of water, or 200-250 ml per acre.
    *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: 2-2.5 ml per litre of water, or 1.0 - 1.25 litres per acre.

**2. Painted Bug (Bagrada hilaris)**
The Painted bug is a serious sap-sucking pest of cruciferous crops, including Turnip. Both nymphs and adults suck sap from leaves, stems, and pods, leading to wilting, yellowing, and reduced plant vigour.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Maintain field sanitation by removing crop residues and weeds that can harbour the pest.
    *   Early sowing can sometimes help escape peak pest incidence.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Malathion** 50% EC: 2-3 ml per litre of water, or 1.0 - 1.5 litres per acre.
    *   **Dimethoate** 30% EC: 1.2-1.6 ml per litre of water, or 600-800 ml per acre.
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: 0.2-0.25 ml per litre of water, or 100-125 ml per acre.
    *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: 0.1-0.2 g per litre of water, or 50-100 g per acre.
    *   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP: 0.1-0.2 g per litre of water, or 50-100 g per acre.

**3. Red Cotton Bug**
This is not known to affect Turnip.

**4. Black Ants**
This is not known to affect Turnip.
