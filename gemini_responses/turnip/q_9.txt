Mites, including Red Spider Mite (*Tetranychus urticae*) and various Rust Mites (Eriophyidae family), are significant pests of Turnip in Haryana, especially during dry and warm periods. They cause damage by sucking sap from the leaves, leading to yellowing, bronzing, leaf distortion, and reduced plant vigour and yield.

To effectively control mites in Turnip, an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is recommended, combining cultural practices with judicious use of CIBRC approved acaricides.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Mites in Turnip:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Regular Monitoring:** Frequently inspect the underside of leaves for the presence of mites, their eggs, and webbing (for red spider mites). Early detection is key for effective control.
    *   **Proper Irrigation:** Maintain adequate soil moisture. Water-stressed plants are more susceptible to mite infestations. Overhead irrigation can sometimes help dislodge mites.
    *   **Weed Management:** Remove weeds from and around the field, as many weeds can serve as alternate hosts for mites.
    *   **Balanced Fertilization:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can promote lush, soft growth that is more attractive to mites.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation to break the pest cycle.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Conserve natural enemies such as predatory mites (*Amblyseius* spp.), ladybird beetles, and lacewings by minimizing the use of broad-spectrum insecticides.

3.  **Chemical Control (Acaricides):**
    *   Apply acaricides when mite populations reach economic threshold levels (e.g., 5-10 mites per leaf).
    *   Ensure thorough coverage of both the upper and lower leaf surfaces, as mites primarily reside on the underside of leaves.
    *   Rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
    *   Always read and follow the label instructions for the specific product, including dosage, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and safety precautions.

**Recommended CIBRC Approved Acaricides for Mites in Turnip:**

*   **Spiromesifen** (e.g., 240 SC formulation): 0.5 - 0.75 ml per liter of water.
*   **Propargite** (e.g., 57% EC formulation): 1.5 - 2.0 ml per liter of water.
*   **Fenpyroximate** (e.g., 5% EC formulation): 0.5 - 1.0 ml per liter of water.
*   **Wettable Sulphur** (e.g., 80% WP formulation): 2.0 - 3.0 g per liter of water. (This is particularly effective against rust mites and also provides some control against red spider mites and powdery mildew).
*   **Abamectin** (e.g., 1.9% EC formulation): 0.3 - 0.5 ml per liter of water.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and application.
*   Spray early in the morning or late in the evening to minimize drift, maximize efficacy, and protect pollinators.
*   Observe the specified pre-harvest interval (PHI) to ensure the safety of the produce.
