As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm that Smut diseases (Black, False, Kernel, and Loose smut) are primarily diseases of cereal crops like wheat, barley, maize, sorghum, and rice.

This is not known to affect Turnip. Turnip (Brassica rapa subsp. rapa) is susceptible to other fungal and bacterial diseases, but not the smut diseases as described.
