Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide you with the ideal guidelines for Turnip transplantation in Haryana. While direct sowing is generally preferred for root crops like Turnip to ensure proper root development and avoid forking, transplantation can be done, especially for early crops or when field conditions are not optimal for direct sowing.

Here are the details:

### Ideal Transplantation Time for Turnip in Haryana

Turnip is a cool-season crop. The ideal transplantation windows are:

*   **Early Crop:** Seedlings raised in **August** can be transplanted in **late August to September**.
*   **Main Winter Crop:** Seedlings raised in **September-October** can be transplanted in **October-November**.

### Ideal Transplantation Distance for Turnip

Proper spacing is crucial for good root development and yield.

*   **Row-to-Row Distance:** 30-45 cm
*   **Plant-to-Plant Distance:** 10-15 cm

### Ideal Transplantation Process for Turnip

1.  **Nursery Raising:**
    *   Prepare raised nursery beds (approximately 1 meter wide, 15-20 cm high, and of convenient length).
    *   Mix well-decomposed Farmyard Manure (FYM) or compost thoroughly with the nursery bed soil.
    *   Sow Turnip seeds thinly in lines 5-7 cm apart, covering them lightly with a thin layer of soil.
    *   Water the nursery beds regularly to maintain adequate moisture.
    *   Seedlings are typically ready for transplanting in **3-4 weeks** when they have developed 3-4 true leaves.

2.  **Main Field Preparation:**
    *   Plough the main field thoroughly to achieve a fine, loose tilth, which is essential for root crops.
    *   Incorporate 15-20 tonnes of well-decomposed FYM per acre into the soil during land preparation.
    *   Prepare ridges and furrows or flat beds according to your preferred irrigation method.

3.  **Hardening of Seedlings:**
    *   About 5-7 days before transplanting, gradually reduce the frequency and amount of watering in the nursery. This process, known as hardening, makes the seedlings more robust and better able to withstand the shock of transplanting.

4.  **Transplanting:**
    *   Transplant seedlings preferably in the **late afternoon or on a cloudy day** to minimize transplanting shock and wilting.
    *   Carefully lift the seedlings from the nursery bed, ensuring that a small ball of earth adheres to the roots to minimize root disturbance.
    *   Plant the seedlings at the recommended spacing (30-45 cm row-to-row and 10-15 cm plant-to-plant).
    *   Ensure that the root collar (the point where the stem meets the roots) is at the soil surface level.
    *   Gently firm the soil around the base of each transplanted seedling.

5.  **Post-Transplant Care:**
    *   **Immediate Irrigation:** Immediately after transplanting, provide a light irrigation to settle the soil around the roots and help the seedlings establish.
    *   **Monitoring:** Monitor the field closely for any signs of wilting. Provide light, frequent irrigation if necessary during the initial establishment phase.
    *   **Gap Filling:** If any seedlings fail to establish, perform gap filling (replacing dead seedlings) within a week of transplantation to maintain uniform plant stand.

Remember, for optimal root development, direct sowing is often preferred for Turnips. However, if you choose to transplant, following these guidelines will help ensure a successful crop.
