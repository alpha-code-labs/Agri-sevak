As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the suitable climate, soil type, and drainage requirements for Turnip cultivation in Haryana:

### Suitable Climate for Turnip

Turnip is a cool-season crop that thrives in moderate temperatures.

*   **Temperature:** The ideal temperature range for optimal growth and root development is between **10°C and 18°C**. Temperatures consistently above 25°C can lead to premature bolting, fibrous roots, and a pungent taste, reducing overall quality.
*   **Season:** In Haryana, Turnip is primarily grown as a **Rabi season crop**. Sowing typically commences from September and continues through October to November, allowing the crop to mature during the cooler months.
*   **Frost Tolerance:** Mature plants can tolerate light frost, but severe freezing temperatures can damage the foliage and roots.

### Suitable Soil Type for Turnip

Turnips perform best in soils that allow for unhindered root development.

*   **Texture:** Well-drained, fertile **sandy-loam to loamy soils** are ideal. These soil types provide good aeration and allow the roots to expand uniformly. Heavy clay soils can impede root growth, leading to misshapen or stunted roots, and can also contribute to waterlogging.
*   **Organic Matter:** Soils rich in organic matter are highly beneficial as they improve soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability, all of which are crucial for healthy turnip growth.
*   **pH:** A slightly acidic to neutral soil pH range of **6.0 to 7.0** is considered optimal for turnip cultivation.

### Drainage Requirement for Turnip

Proper drainage is critical for successful turnip cultivation.

*   **Sensitivity to Waterlogging:** Turnips are highly sensitive to waterlogging. Standing water or excessively wet soil conditions can lead to several problems, including:
    *   **Root Rot:** Anaerobic conditions promote the growth of pathogenic fungi and bacteria, causing root rot.
    *   **Stunted Growth:** Lack of oxygen in the root zone inhibits nutrient uptake and overall plant growth.
    *   **Reduced Yield and Quality:** Waterlogged conditions severely impact the development of the edible root, leading to poor yield and quality.
*   **Requirement:** The soil must be **well-drained** to ensure adequate aeration around the roots and prevent water accumulation. This is particularly important during periods of heavy rainfall or irrigation. Raised beds can be beneficial in areas prone to poor drainage.
