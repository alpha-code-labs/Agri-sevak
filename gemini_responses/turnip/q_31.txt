As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling physical damage in Turnip:

### Control of Physical Damage in Turnip

**1. Fruit Bursting (Root Cracking/Splitting)**

This physiological disorder is primarily caused by rapid fluctuations in soil moisture, sudden growth spurts, and sometimes nutrient imbalances.

*   **Consistent Soil Moisture:** Maintain uniform soil moisture throughout the growing period. Avoid extremes of drought followed by heavy irrigation or rainfall. Implement light and frequent irrigation rather than heavy, infrequent watering.
*   **Organic Matter:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost into the soil to improve soil structure, water retention capacity, and drainage.
*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Boron Deficiency:** Boron plays a crucial role in cell wall integrity. If soil tests indicate boron deficiency, apply:
        *   **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate) at 10-15 kg/acre as a soil application before sowing, or 0.1-0.2% foliar spray (1-2 g/L water) at early root development.
        *   **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** at 1-1.5 kg/acre as a soil application or 0.1% foliar spray (1 g/L water).
    *   **Calcium Deficiency:** Calcium is essential for strong cell walls. If deficiency is suspected, apply:
        *   **Calcium nitrate** at 10-15 kg/acre as a soil application or 0.5% foliar spray (5 g/L water).
        *   **Gypsum** (Calcium sulfate dihydrate) at 200-400 kg/acre as a soil amendment, especially in sodic soils.
*   **Timely Harvesting:** Harvest turnip roots at their optimal maturity. Over-mature roots are more susceptible to cracking.
*   **Varietal Selection:** Choose varieties known to be less prone to cracking, if available.

**2. Leaf Burning/Melting**

This can be due to various environmental stresses or improper chemical application.

*   **Adequate Irrigation:** Ensure consistent and sufficient water supply to prevent drought stress, which can lead to leaf scorching. Avoid waterlogging, which can also damage roots and lead to leaf symptoms.
*   **Shade Management:** During periods of intense heat and direct sunlight, especially for young plants or after cloudy weather, temporary shading can help prevent sunscald.
*   **Proper Fertilization:** Apply fertilizers based on soil test recommendations. Over-application, especially of nitrogen, or high salt concentrations in the soil can cause leaf burn.
*   **Careful Chemical Application:**
    *   Always follow label instructions precisely for all pesticides, herbicides, and foliar fertilizers.
    *   Avoid spraying during the hottest part of the day or when plants are under water stress, as this increases the risk of phytotoxicity.
    *   Ensure correct dilution rates to prevent chemical burn.
*   **Soil Drainage:** Ensure good soil drainage to prevent waterlogging, which can lead to root damage and subsequent leaf symptoms.

**3. Hardness in Fruit (Root)**

This condition, where the turnip root becomes fibrous, woody, or tough, is primarily associated with over-maturity and environmental stress.

*   **Timely Harvesting:** This is the most critical control measure. Harvest turnip roots when they reach the desired size and tenderness, before they become over-mature. Delaying harvest significantly increases the likelihood of hardness and woodiness.
*   **Consistent Soil Moisture:** Maintain uniform and adequate soil moisture throughout the root development phase. Inconsistent watering or prolonged drought stress can lead to premature lignification and toughness.
*   **Optimal Planting Time:** Plant turnips during periods that avoid extreme high temperatures during the critical root enlargement phase, as heat can accelerate the hardening process.
*   **Varietal Selection:** Choose varieties known for good texture and slower development of woodiness.
