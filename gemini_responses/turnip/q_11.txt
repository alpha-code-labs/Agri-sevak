Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding pest management in Turnip. Beetles (primarily Flea Beetles), Weevils (like Turnip Gall Weevil), and Sawflies (Mustard Sawfly) are indeed significant pests of Turnip in our region. Effective management requires an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural practices with judicious use of CIBRC-approved chemicals.

Here's a detailed guide for their control:

### General Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Principles:

1.  **Regular Monitoring:** Inspect your fields frequently, especially during the seedling stage, to detect pest infestations early.
2.  **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy crop residues after harvest to break the pest life cycle. Control weeds, as they can act as alternate hosts.
3.  **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting Turnip or other cruciferous crops in the same field year after year. Rotate with non-cruciferous crops.
4.  **Timely Sowing:** Sow crops at the recommended time to avoid peak pest periods.

### Specific Control Measures:

#### 1. Beetles (Primarily Flea Beetles - *Phyllotreta spp.*)

**Symptoms:** Small, round holes (shot-holes) on leaves, especially on young seedlings. Severe infestation can stunt growth or even kill young plants.

**Cultural/Mechanical Control:**
*   Ensure good soil moisture and fertility to promote vigorous plant growth, allowing plants to tolerate some damage.
*   In small plots, hand-picking severely infested leaves or plants can help.

**Chemical Control (Apply when damage is significant, especially at seedling stage):**
*   **Seed Treatment:** For early protection against flea beetles, treat seeds before sowing.
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** 5-7 ml per kg of seed.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** 3-5 g per kg of seed.
*   **Foliar Spray:**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** 125-150 ml per acre (in 200-300 litres of water).
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** 50-100 g per acre (in 200-300 litres of water).
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** 100-125 ml per acre (in 200-300 litres of water).
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** 50-100 g per acre (in 200-300 litres of water).

#### 2. Weevils (Primarily Turnip Gall Weevil - *Ceutorhynchus pleurostigma* and Cabbage Stem Weevil - *Ceutorhynchus quadridens*)

**Symptoms:**
*   **Turnip Gall Weevil:** Causes galls (swellings) on roots, rootlets, and sometimes lower stems. Infested plants may show stunted growth, wilting, and reduced yield.
*   **Cabbage Stem Weevil:** Larvae tunnel into stems, causing wilting, stunted growth, and sometimes plant death.

**Cultural/Mechanical Control:**
*   Practice strict crop rotation, avoiding cruciferous crops for at least 2-3 years in infested fields.
*   Remove and destroy all infested plant material and cruciferous weeds (e.g., wild mustard) from around the field, as they can host the pest.
*   Deep ploughing after harvest can expose pupae to predators and adverse weather.

**Chemical Control (Focus on preventing adult egg-laying and early larval stages):**
*   **Seed Treatment:** Can provide early protection against stem weevils.
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** 5-7 ml per kg of seed.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** 3-5 g per kg of seed.
*   **Foliar Spray (to target adult weevils):**
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** 100-125 ml per acre (in 200-300 litres of water).
    *   **Cypermethrin 25% EC:** 200-250 ml per acre (in 200-300 litres of water).

#### 3. Sawflies (Primarily Mustard Sawfly - *Athalia lugens proxima*)

**Symptoms:** Larvae (false caterpillars, greenish-black with five longitudinal stripes) feed voraciously on leaves, creating irregular holes and often defoliating plants, especially young ones.

**Cultural/Mechanical Control:**
*   Regularly inspect plants and hand-pick larvae in small areas.
*   Maintain good field sanitation to remove host weeds.
*   Deep ploughing after harvest can expose pupae in the soil.

**Chemical Control (Apply when larvae are observed and causing damage):**
*   **Malathion 50% EC:** 500-1000 ml per acre (in 200-300 litres of water).
*   **Quinalphos 25% EC:** 500-800 ml per acre (in 200-300 litres of water).
*   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** 100-125 ml per acre (in 200-300 litres of water).
*   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC:** 500-1000 ml per acre (in 200-300 litres of water).
*   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG:** 80-100 g per acre (in 200-300 litres of water).

### Important Considerations:

*   **Safety First:** Always wear protective clothing (gloves, mask, goggles) while handling and spraying chemicals.
*   **Read Labels:** Strictly follow the instructions and dosage recommendations on the pesticide label.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Observe the specified waiting period between the last spray and harvest to ensure the produce is safe for consumption.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate different classes of insecticides to prevent the development of pest resistance.
*   **Spray Timing:** Spray during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
