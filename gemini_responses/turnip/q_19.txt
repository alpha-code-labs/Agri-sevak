Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I advise that addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies in Turnip (Shalgam) is crucial for healthy growth and good yield. The most effective approach begins with a **soil test**. A comprehensive soil test will accurately determine the existing nutrient levels in your field and guide precise fertilizer recommendations, preventing both deficiencies and over-application.

However, if visual symptoms indicate a deficiency, here's how to address Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium deficiencies in Turnip:

### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   General yellowing (chlorosis) of older leaves, starting from the tips and moving inwards.
*   Stunted growth and reduced plant vigor.
*   Pale green appearance of the entire plant.

**Correction:**
Nitrogen is essential for vegetative growth. It can be applied through soil or foliar methods.

*   **Soil Application (Top-dressing):**
    *   Apply 30-40 kg N/acre as a top-dressing, typically 3-4 weeks after sowing. This is in addition to the basal dose.
    *   Use **Urea** (46% N) at 65-87 kg/acre.
    *   Alternatively, **Calcium Ammonium Nitrate (CAN)** (25% N) at 120-160 kg/acre.
*   **Foliar Application (for quick correction):**
    *   Spray a 1-2% solution of **Urea**.
    *   Mix 10-20 g of **Urea** per litre of water. Apply 200-300 litres of this solution per acre, ensuring good leaf coverage. Repeat after 7-10 days if symptoms persist.

### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   Purplish discoloration on the underside of older leaves and stems.
*   Stunted growth, particularly poor root development.
*   Leaves may appear dull and dark green initially, then develop purple tints.

**Correction:**
Phosphorus is vital for root development, flowering, and energy transfer. It is best applied as a basal dose.

*   **Soil Application (Basal):**
    *   Apply 30-40 kg P2O5/acre at the time of sowing.
    *   Use **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5) at 65-87 kg/acre.
    *   Alternatively, **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5) at 187-250 kg/acre.
    *   *Note: Phosphorus is less mobile in soil, so basal application ensures it's available to developing roots.*

### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   Yellowing and browning (scorching) of leaf margins, especially on older leaves.
*   Weak stems and lodging (falling over).
*   Poor root development and reduced disease resistance.
*   Smaller, poorly developed roots/bulbs.

**Correction:**
Potassium is crucial for water regulation, disease resistance, and overall plant vigor, impacting the quality of the Turnip bulb.

*   **Soil Application (Basal or Split):**
    *   Apply 30-40 kg K2O/acre. This can be applied entirely as a basal dose or split into two applications (half basal, half as top-dressing 3-4 weeks after sowing), especially in sandy soils prone to leaching.
    *   Use **Muriate of Potash (Potassium Chloride)** (60% K2O) at 50-67 kg/acre.
    *   Alternatively, **Sulphate of Potash (Potassium Sulphate)** (50% K2O) at 60-80 kg/acre.
*   **Foliar Application (for quick correction):**
    *   For immediate relief, spray a 1% solution of **Potassium Sulphate**.
    *   Mix 10 g of **Potassium Sulphate** per litre of water. Apply 200-300 litres of this solution per acre.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Soil Testing is Paramount:** Always prioritize soil testing to get precise recommendations for your specific field conditions.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure a balanced application of all macro and micro-nutrients for optimal plant health and yield.
*   **Irrigation:** Proper irrigation practices are essential for nutrient uptake.
*   **Organic Matter:** Incorporating organic matter (farmyard manure, compost) improves soil structure and nutrient retention.
