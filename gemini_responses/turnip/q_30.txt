As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), here is scientifically verified advice for managing growth issues in Turnip in Haryana:

**General Principle:** A comprehensive soil test is the foundational step for diagnosing and managing most growth issues related to nutrient deficiencies or imbalances. Contact your nearest Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or HAU extension center for soil testing services.

### 1. Slow Growth

Slow growth in Turnip can be attributed to several factors, including nutrient deficiencies, water stress, soil compaction, or suboptimal environmental conditions.

*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Nitrogen (N):** Essential for vegetative growth. Apply as per soil test recommendations. If no test, a general recommendation for basal application could be 20-30 kg N/acre.
        *   **Urea** (46% N): Apply 40-65 kg/acre in split doses (basal and top-dressing).
    *   **Phosphorus (P):** Crucial for root development. Apply as basal.
        *   **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5): Apply 50-60 kg/acre.
        *   **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5): Apply 150-200 kg/acre.
    *   **Potassium (K):** Important for overall plant health and stress tolerance. Apply as basal.
        *   **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** (60% K2O): Apply 30-40 kg/acre.
    *   **Micronutrients:** Deficiencies in Zinc, Boron, or Manganese can also hinder growth.
        *   **Zinc sulfate** (21% Zn): Apply 10 kg/acre as basal if deficient.
        *   **Borax** (10.5% B): Apply 4-6 kg/acre as basal if deficient.
*   **Water Management:** Ensure consistent and adequate moisture. Turnips require regular irrigation, especially during root development. Avoid both water stress and waterlogging.
*   **Soil Health:** Improve soil structure and organic matter content by incorporating well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost (10-15 tonnes/acre) before sowing. Avoid soil compaction.
*   **Weed Control:** Weeds compete for nutrients and water, hindering turnip growth. Implement timely weeding (manual or chemical).

### 2. Yellow Growth (Chlorosis)

Yellowing of leaves indicates chlorosis, often due to nutrient deficiencies or waterlogging.

*   **Nitrogen Deficiency:** General yellowing, starting from older leaves.
    *   Apply **Urea** (46% N) as a top-dressing at 20-30 kg/acre, followed by light irrigation.
*   **Iron Deficiency:** Interveinal yellowing (veins remain green), typically on younger leaves. Common in high pH soils.
    *   Foliar spray of **Ferrous sulfate** (19% Fe) at 0.5% concentration (5 g/L water). Repeat after 10-15 days if needed.
*   **Sulfur Deficiency:** General yellowing, often on younger leaves.
    *   Apply **Gypsum** (18% S) at 200-250 kg/acre as basal, or **Ammonium sulfate** (24% S, 20.6% N) at 50-75 kg/acre as basal/top-dressing.
*   **Zinc Deficiency:** Yellowing or whitish patches, often on younger leaves.
    *   Foliar spray of **Zinc sulfate** (21% Zn) at 0.5% concentration (5 g/L water).
*   **Manganese Deficiency:** Interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, similar to iron but often with small necrotic spots.
    *   Foliar spray of **Manganese sulfate** (30.5% Mn) at 0.5% concentration (5 g/L water).
*   **Waterlogging:** Can cause root damage and nutrient uptake issues, leading to yellowing. Ensure proper drainage.

### 3. Excessive Height or Excessive Flowering (Bolting)

In Turnip, "excessive height" and "excessive flowering" are primarily symptoms of **bolting**, where the plant prematurely develops a flower stalk instead of forming a fleshy root. This makes the root woody and unpalatable, rendering the crop unmarketable. There is no chemical treatment to reverse bolting once it has occurred. Management focuses on prevention.

*   **Variety Selection:** Choose bolt-resistant varieties specifically recommended for cultivation in Haryana. Consult HAU recommendations for suitable varieties.
*   **Optimal Sowing Time:** Sow turnips at the recommended time for your region in Haryana (typically late September to November) to avoid temperature extremes (prolonged cold periods followed by warm spells, or late sowing into rising temperatures) that can induce bolting.
*   **Consistent Moisture and Nutrition:** Avoid any form of stress (water stress, nutrient stress) during the growing period, as stress can trigger bolting. Maintain uniform soil moisture and provide balanced nutrition.
*   **Planting Density:** Ensure proper spacing between plants to avoid overcrowding, which can also stress plants.

**Note:** Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs) are generally not recommended or effective for preventing bolting in turnips, as bolting is a complex physiological response to environmental cues and genetic predisposition. Their use for simply reducing height in turnip is not a standard practice as the focus is on root development, not stem height.
