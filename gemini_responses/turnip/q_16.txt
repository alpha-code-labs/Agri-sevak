As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following fertilizer doses for Turnip cultivation in Haryana. Please note that these are general recommendations, and a soil test is always advisable for precise nutrient management tailored to your specific field conditions.

**General Nutrient Recommendation for Turnip (per acre):**
*   **Nitrogen (N):** 60-80 kg
*   **Phosphorus (P2O5):** 40-60 kg
*   **Potassium (K2O):** 40-60 kg
*   **Sulphur (S):** 10-20 kg

**Fertilizer Application Schedule:**

**1. Basal Application (at the time of sowing):**
Apply all Phosphorus, Potassium, Sulphur, and half of the Nitrogen requirement.

*   **DAP (Diammonium Phosphate):** 87-130 kg/acre (This provides 15.6-23.4 kg N and 40-60 kg P2O5).
    *   *Alternatively, if using SSP for Phosphorus:*
        *   **SSP (Single Super Phosphate):** 250-375 kg/acre (This provides 40-60 kg P2O5 and 27.5-41.25 kg S, largely covering the Sulphur requirement).
*   **Muriate of Potash (MOP):** 67-100 kg/acre (This provides 40-60 kg K2O).
*   **Urea:** 60-80 kg/acre (To provide half of the total N requirement, adjusting for N supplied by DAP if used).
*   **Elemental Sulphur (90% S):** 11-22 kg/acre (If SSP is not used, or if additional Sulphur is required).

**2. Top Dressing (25-30 days after sowing):**
Apply the remaining half of the Nitrogen requirement.

*   **Urea:** 60-80 kg/acre (To provide the remaining half of the total N requirement).

**3. Nano Fertilizers (Foliar Application - Supplementary):**
Nano fertilizers are supplementary and do not replace the full basal application of conventional fertilizers. They are effective for nutrient uptake during critical growth stages.

*   **Nano-Urea (Liquid 4% N):** 2-4 ml/L of water. Apply 2-3 foliar sprays starting 25-30 days after sowing, at 10-15 day intervals, depending on crop vigor and nutrient demand.
*   **Nano-DAP (Liquid 8% N, 16% P2O5):** 2-4 ml/L of water. Apply 2-3 foliar sprays starting 25-30 days after sowing, at 10-15 day intervals, depending on crop vigor and nutrient demand.

**4. NPK (Complex Fertilizers):**
If using a complex NPK fertilizer, choose a grade that best matches the P and K requirements for basal application (e.g., 12:32:16 or 10:26:26).
*   For example, if using **12:32:16 NPK**, apply 125-188 kg/acre as basal to meet the P2O5 requirement. Then, supplement with **Urea** and **Muriate of Potash** to fulfill the remaining N and K2O needs as per the general recommendation.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always incorporate basal fertilizers into the soil before sowing.
*   Ensure uniform application of fertilizers.
*   Irrigate the field after top-dressing Urea if there is no immediate rainfall.
*   For best results, conduct a soil test to determine the exact nutrient status of your field and adjust fertilizer doses accordingly.
