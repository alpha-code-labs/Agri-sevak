As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Turnip (Brassica rapa subsp. rapa) in Haryana.

It is crucial to implement an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural practices with judicious use of CIBRC-approved fungicides when necessary.

### General Cultural Practices for Fungal Disease Management:

*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice a 2-3 year rotation with non-brassica crops to reduce pathogen inoculum in the soil.
*   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris immediately after harvest to prevent carry-over of pathogens.
*   **Seed Treatment:** Use certified disease-free seeds or treat seeds with appropriate fungicides to prevent seed-borne diseases.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to improve air circulation and reduce humidity within the canopy, which discourages fungal growth.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced fertilizers. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can lead to lush growth more susceptible to certain diseases.
*   **Irrigation Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day, to minimize leaf wetness periods. Drip irrigation is preferred.

### Specific Fungal Diseases and Control Measures:

#### 1. Alternaria Leaf Spot (Black Spot)

Caused by *Alternaria brassicae* and *Alternaria brassicicola*, this disease manifests as dark, concentric spots on leaves, stems, and pods, which can lead to blighting.

*   **Fungicides (Foliar Spray):**
    *   **Mancozeb** 2.0-2.5 kg/acre (dissolved in 500-750 L water)
    *   **Chlorothalonil** 1.0-1.25 kg/acre (dissolved in 500-750 L water)
    *   **Azoxystrobin** 200 ml/acre (dissolved in 500-750 L water)
    *   **Propineb** 1.5-2.0 kg/acre (dissolved in 500-750 L water)
    *   **Tebuconazole** 250-300 ml/acre (dissolved in 500-750 L water)

#### 2. Anthracnose

Caused by *Colletotrichum higginsianum*, this disease results in sunken, dark lesions on leaves, stems, and pods, often with pinkish spore masses in humid conditions.

*   **Fungicides (Foliar Spray):**
    *   **Mancozeb** 2.0-2.5 kg/acre (dissolved in 500-750 L water)
    *   **Chlorothalonil** 1.0-1.25 kg/acre (dissolved in 500-750 L water)
    *   **Azoxystrobin** 200 ml/acre (dissolved in 500-750 L water)
    *   **Carbendazim** 250-500 g/acre (dissolved in 500-750 L water) - *Note: Use judiciously to manage resistance development.*

#### 3. Blast

This is not known to affect Turnip.

#### 4. Blight

The term "Blight" is general. Specific blight diseases like Early Blight (*Alternaria solani*) or Late Blight (*Phytophthora infestans*) are not primary diseases of Turnip. However, severe *Alternaria* infection (as described above) can lead to blighting symptoms. Control measures for Alternaria Leaf Spot will manage such symptoms.

#### 5. Brown Spot

The term "Brown Spot" is general. Brown spots on Turnip leaves are commonly caused by *Alternaria* species (Alternaria Leaf Spot) or *Cercospora brassicicola* (Cercospora Leaf Spot). Control measures for Alternaria Leaf Spot will be effective.

#### 6. Downy Mildew

Caused by *Peronospora parasitica* (syn. *Hyaloperonospora parasitica*), this disease appears as yellowish patches on the upper leaf surface and a greyish-white, fuzzy growth on the underside.

*   **Fungicides (Foliar Spray):**
    *   **Metalaxyl-M + Mancozeb** 1.0 kg/acre (dissolved in 500-750 L water)
    *   **Dimethomorph + Mancozeb** 1.0 kg/acre (dissolved in 500-750 L water)
    *   **Cymoxanil + Mancozeb** 1.0 kg/acre (dissolved in 500-750 L water)
    *   **Fluopicolide + Propamocarb Hydrochloride** 600-800 ml/acre (dissolved in 500-750 L water)
    *   **Mancozeb** 2.0-2.5 kg/acre (dissolved in 500-750 L water) - *Primarily protective.*

#### 7. Powdery Mildew

Caused by *Erysiphe cruciferarum* (syn. *Erysiphe polygoni*), this disease is characterized by white, powdery patches on the upper and lower surfaces of leaves, stems, and sometimes pods.

*   **Fungicides (Foliar Spray):**
    *   **Sulphur** (Wettable Powder) 2.0-2.5 kg/acre (dissolved in 500-750 L water)
    *   **Myclobutanil** 200-250 ml/acre (dissolved in 500-750 L water)
    *   **Penconazole** 100-150 ml/acre (dissolved in 500-750 L water)
    *   **Azoxystrobin** 200 ml/acre (dissolved in 500-750 L water)
    *   **Tebuconazole** 250-300 ml/acre (dissolved in 500-750 L water)

#### 8. Grey Mildew

This is not known to affect Turnip.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the fungicide label for dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in fungal populations.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and current disease pressure.
