As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding rust diseases in Turnip for Haryana.

Let's address each type of rust mentioned:

*   **Black Rust (Stem Rust):** This is not known to affect Turnip. Black rust primarily affects cereal crops like wheat, barley, and rye.
*   **Brown Rust (Leaf Rust):** This is not known to affect Turnip. Brown rust primarily affects cereal crops like wheat and barley.
*   **Yellow Rust (Stripe Rust):** This is not known to affect Turnip. Yellow rust primarily affects cereal crops like wheat, barley, and rye.
*   **Red Rust:** This is not known to affect Turnip as a distinct, common rust disease. The term "red rust" is sometimes used for specific rusts on other crops (e.g., coffee) or as a general descriptor, but it is not a recognized rust disease of Turnip.

However, **White Rust** is a significant and common disease of Turnip and other cruciferous crops. It is caused by the oomycete *Albugo candida*, which, despite its name, is not a true rust fungus but causes symptoms that resemble rusts.

### Control Measures for White Rust (*Albugo candida*) in Turnip:

Effective management of White Rust involves a combination of cultural practices and timely chemical interventions.

**1. Cultural Practices:**

*   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting Turnip or other cruciferous crops (like mustard, cabbage, cauliflower, radish) in the same field for at least 2-3 years. This helps break the disease cycle.
*   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris and volunteer cruciferous plants from the field and surrounding areas.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available and suitable for Haryana conditions, choose Turnip varieties known to have resistance or tolerance to White Rust.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to improve air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce humidity and disease development.
*   **Weed Management:** Control cruciferous weeds (e.g., wild mustard, shepherd's purse) in and around the field, as they can act as alternate hosts for the pathogen.
*   **Balanced Fertilization:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush, susceptible growth.

**2. Chemical Control (Fungicides):**

Fungicides should be applied preventively or at the very first appearance of symptoms. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI). Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

*   **Mancozeb 75% WP:**
    *   Apply at a rate of 2.0-2.5 kg per acre (or 2.5-3.0 g per litre of water).
    *   This is a broad-spectrum contact fungicide that provides good protective action.
*   **Metalaxyl 8% + Mancozeb 64% WP:**
    *   Apply at a rate of 2.0-2.5 kg per acre (or 2.5-3.0 g per litre of water).
    *   This combination provides both systemic (Metalaxyl) and contact (Mancozeb) action, offering better control, especially if the disease has already appeared.
*   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:**
    *   Apply at a rate of 0.5 ml per litre of water (or 200 ml per acre).
    *   This is a strobilurin fungicide with systemic and translaminar action, effective against oomycetes.
*   **Propineb 70% WP:**
    *   Apply at a rate of 2.0-2.5 kg per acre (or 2.5-3.0 g per litre of water).
    *   Another effective contact fungicide for protective control.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Initiate sprays as soon as the first symptoms are observed or when environmental conditions (cool, moist weather) are favourable for disease development.
*   Repeat applications at 10-15 day intervals, depending on disease severity and weather conditions.
*   Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage during spraying.
