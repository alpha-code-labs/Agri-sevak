As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), here are the recommended cultivation practices for Turnip in Haryana:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   Turnip is primarily direct-seeded.
    *   Sowing in lines is highly recommended over broadcasting as it facilitates inter-cultivation operations like weeding, thinning, and irrigation more efficiently.
    *   Seeds can be sown on flat beds or on the sides of ridges, especially in areas prone to waterlogging or for efficient irrigation management.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   The seeds should be sown at a shallow depth of 1.0 to 1.5 cm. Deeper planting can hinder germination.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   **Row-to-Row Spacing:** Maintain a distance of 30 to 45 cm between rows.
    *   **Plant-to-Plant Spacing:** After germination, thinning should be done to maintain a plant-to-plant distance of 10 to 15 cm within the row. This ensures proper root development and prevents overcrowding.

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   An average seed rate of 3 to 4 kg per acre is recommended for optimal plant stand.
