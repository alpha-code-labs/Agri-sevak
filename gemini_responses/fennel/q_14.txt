As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling soil pests like Termites and Root-knot Nematodes in Fennel (Saunf) cultivation in Haryana.

Both Termites and Root-knot Nematodes are significant soil-borne pests that can severely impact Fennel yield and plant health. An Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods, is recommended for effective and sustainable control.

### Control of Termites (e.g., *Odontotermes obesus*, *Microtermes obesi*) in Fennel

Termites are polyphagous pests that can damage the roots and collar region of Fennel plants, leading to wilting, yellowing, and ultimately plant death, especially in young seedlings.

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove all stubble, crop residues, and woody debris from the field before sowing, as these serve as food sources for termites.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** Ploughing the field deeply during summer exposes termite colonies to sunlight and predators, disrupting their nests.
*   **Proper Irrigation:** Maintain adequate soil moisture, as termites prefer dry conditions. Avoid water stress in plants.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate Fennel with non-host crops or crops that are less susceptible to termite damage.

**2. Chemical Control (Pre-sowing/At Sowing):**
For severe infestations, chemical treatment can be applied as a preventive measure.
*   **Soil Treatment (Pre-sowing):**
    *   Apply **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** at 2.5-4.0 litres per acre, mixed in 400-600 litres of water, and drench the soil or apply through irrigation before sowing.
    *   Alternatively, apply **Fipronil 0.3% GR** at 10-15 kg per acre, broadcast evenly and incorporate into the soil during the last ploughing.
*   **Drenching (Post-emergence, if infestation is observed):**
    *   Drench the base of affected plants with a solution of **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** at 2.5 ml per litre of water.

### Control of Root-knot Nematodes (*Meloidogyne* spp.) in Fennel

Root-knot nematodes are microscopic roundworms that infect the roots of Fennel plants, causing characteristic galls or knots. These galls impair the plant's ability to absorb water and nutrients, leading to stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, reduced vigour, and significant yield loss. Fennel is highly susceptible to root-knot nematodes.

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate Fennel with non-host crops like cereals (e.g., wheat, maize, sorghum) for at least 2-3 years. Avoid continuous cultivation of susceptible crops.
*   **Summer Ploughing/Solarization:** Deep ploughing during hot summer months exposes nematode eggs and larvae to lethal temperatures. Soil solarization (covering moist soil with clear plastic sheets for 4-6 weeks during summer) can also effectively reduce nematode populations.
*   **Use of Healthy Seedlings:** Ensure that seedlings used for transplanting are free from nematode infection.
*   **Weed Management:** Control weeds, as many can act as alternate hosts for nematodes.

**2. Biological Control:**
*   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporate well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost at 10-15 tonnes per acre.
*   **Neem Cake:** Apply **Neem Cake** at 200-400 kg per acre and incorporate it into the soil 2-3 weeks before sowing. Neem cake releases compounds that are toxic to nematodes and also promotes beneficial soil microbes.
*   **Bio-nematicides:**
    *   Apply **Purpureocillium lilacinum** (formerly *Paecilomyces lilacinus*) or *Trichoderma harzianum* based formulations at 2-4 kg per acre, mixed with 100 kg of FYM/compost, and broadcast evenly before sowing or at planting. These fungi parasitize nematode eggs and larvae.

**3. Chemical Control (For severe infestations, as a last resort):**
*   **Pre-sowing Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Fluensulfone 2% GR** at 20-30 kg per acre, broadcast evenly and incorporate into the soil before sowing. This is a modern nematicide with good efficacy.

**General Precautions:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Avoid spraying during flowering to protect pollinators.
*   Ensure proper disposal of empty containers.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions.
