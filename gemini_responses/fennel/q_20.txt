Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I emphasize the critical role of micronutrients for healthy fennel growth and optimal yield. Deficiencies can significantly impact plant vigor, seed quality, and overall productivity. The first and most crucial step in addressing any suspected deficiency is a comprehensive **soil test**. This will accurately diagnose the specific nutrient lacking and its severity, allowing for targeted and efficient management.

Here's how to address the common micronutrient deficiencies in fennel, using CIBRC approved technical chemical names and metric units:

### General Recommendations:
*   **Soil Testing:** Get your soil tested from HAU or an accredited lab to determine the exact deficiency levels.
*   **Foliar Application:** Provides a quick corrective measure, especially for standing crops showing deficiency symptoms. Apply during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late afternoon) to avoid leaf scorching and maximize absorption.
*   **Soil Application:** Best for long-term management and prevention, typically applied as a basal dose before sowing or transplanting.
*   **Water Quality:** Use clean water for spray solutions.

### Addressing Specific Micronutrient Deficiencies in Fennel:

#### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency
Zinc deficiency is common in Haryana soils, particularly in high pH and calcareous conditions.
*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, small and narrow leaves (little leaf), interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, bronzing of older leaves.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.5% solution of **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** (21% Zn) or 0.1% solution of **Zinc EDTA** (12% Zn).
        *   Dosage: 5 g/L of **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** OR 1 g/L of **Zinc EDTA**.
        *   Frequency: Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, starting when symptoms appear.
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 10-25 kg/acre of **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** (21% Zn) as a basal dose before sowing or transplanting.

#### 2. Iron (Fe) / Ferrous Deficiency
Iron deficiency, often called lime-induced chlorosis, is prevalent in high pH, calcareous soils.
*   **Symptoms:** Prominent interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on young leaves, with veins remaining green. In severe cases, entire leaves may turn pale yellow or white.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.5-1.0% solution of **Ferrous Sulphate Heptahydrate** (19% Fe) or 0.1-0.2% solution of **Ferrous EDTA** (12% Fe).
        *   Dosage: 5-10 g/L of **Ferrous Sulphate Heptahydrate** OR 1-2 g/L of **Ferrous EDTA**.
        *   Frequency: Apply 2-3 sprays at 7-10 day intervals, especially during active growth.
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 25-50 kg/acre of **Ferrous Sulphate Heptahydrate** (19% Fe) or 5-10 kg/acre of **Ferrous EDTA**. Soil application of ferrous sulphate is less effective in high pH soils.

#### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency
Boron deficiency can occur in sandy soils or soils with low organic matter.
*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, thickening and brittleness of leaves, cracking of stems, hollow stems, malformed new growth, poor flowering, and reduced seed set.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.1-0.2% solution of **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (20% B) or **Boric Acid** (17% B).
        *   Dosage: 1-2 g/L of **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** OR 1-2 g/L of **Boric Acid**.
        *   Frequency: Apply at pre-flowering stage or when symptoms appear.
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 2-4 kg/acre of **Borax** (Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate, 10.5% B) or 1-2 kg/acre of **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** as a basal dose.

#### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency
Calcium deficiency is less common as a primary soil issue in Haryana but can occur due to imbalances or poor transport within the plant.
*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, distorted or curled new leaves, tip burn on young leaves, weak stems.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.5-1.0% solution of **Calcium Nitrate** (19% Ca) or **Calcium Chloride** (27% Ca).
        *   Dosage: 5-10 g/L of **Calcium Nitrate** OR 5-10 g/L of **Calcium Chloride**.
        *   Frequency: Apply during active growth stages, especially when new growth is emerging.
    *   **Soil Application:** For general calcium improvement, **Calcium Nitrate** can be applied at 20-40 kg/acre. If soil sodicity is an issue, **Gypsum** (Calcium Sulphate Dihydrate, 23% Ca) application based on soil test recommendations is beneficial.

#### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency
Magnesium deficiency can occur in sandy soils, acidic soils, or where potassium levels are excessively high.
*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, starting from the leaf margins and progressing inwards, often giving a "herringbone" pattern. Leaves may become brittle.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 1.0-2.0% solution of **Magnesium Sulphate Heptahydrate** (Epsom salt, 9.6% Mg).
        *   Dosage: 10-20 g/L of **Magnesium Sulphate Heptahydrate**.
        *   Frequency: Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, starting when symptoms appear.
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 10-20 kg/acre of **Magnesium Sulphate Heptahydrate** as a basal dose.

#### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency
Manganese deficiency can occur in high pH, well-aerated soils, or organic soils.
*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, similar to iron deficiency but often with a finer network of green veins. In severe cases, small necrotic (dead) spots may appear.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.5% solution of **Manganese Sulphate Monohydrate** (30.5% Mn) or 0.1% solution of **Manganese EDTA** (12% Mn).
        *   Dosage: 5 g/L of **Manganese Sulphate Monohydrate** OR 1 g/L of **Manganese EDTA**.
        *   Frequency: Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, starting when symptoms appear.
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 10-20 kg/acre of **Manganese Sulphate Monohydrate** as a basal dose. Soil application is less effective in high pH soils.

Always consult with HAU experts or your local agricultural extension office for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions. Integrated nutrient management, including regular addition of organic matter, can significantly improve micronutrient availability and overall soil health.
