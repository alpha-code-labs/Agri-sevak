As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified recommendations for the use of growth regulators and boron in Fennel cultivation in Haryana:

Here are the recommendations for the specified substances:

*   **Ethephon (Ethrel):**
    *   **Purpose:** To promote uniform maturity and enhance seed yield in Fennel.
    *   **Dose:** Foliar spray of **Ethephon** (39% SL or 40% SL formulation) at 0.5 - 1.0 ml per litre of water (equivalent to 200-400 ppm) at the pre-flowering stage (around 60-70 days after sowing) and again at the early seed development stage.
    *   **Application:** Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage. Use sufficient water volume (e.g., 200-250 litres per acre) for effective spray.

*   **2,4-D:**
    *   This is not known to be recommended as a growth regulator for Fennel. **2,4-D** is primarily used as a selective herbicide in cereal crops and its application to broadleaf crops like Fennel, even at very low concentrations, can cause phytotoxicity and adverse effects on growth and yield. Therefore, its use as a growth regulator in Fennel is not advised.

*   **Boron:**
    *   **Purpose:** Boron is an essential micronutrient crucial for flowering, pollen viability, seed set, and overall yield in Fennel. Its deficiency can lead to poor seed development and reduced yield.
    *   **Dose (Foliar Spray):**
        *   Spray **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (e.g., Solubor, 20% Boron) at 1.0 g per litre of water (0.1% solution).
        *   Alternatively, spray **Sodium tetraborate decahydrate** (e.g., Borax, 10.5-11.3% Boron) at 2.0 g per litre of water (0.2% solution).
    *   **Application:** Apply two foliar sprays:
        1.  First spray at the pre-flowering stage (when flower initiation begins).
        2.  Second spray 15-20 days after the first spray, during the early seed development stage.
    *   **Dose (Soil Application, if severe deficiency is suspected):**
        *   Apply **Sodium tetraborate decahydrate** (Borax) at 5-10 kg per acre, mixed with sand or fertilizer, at the time of sowing or before transplanting. This should be done based on soil test recommendations.

Always ensure proper calibration of spray equipment and follow safety precautions as per the product label.
