As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling these pests in Fennel:

**Ber Fly (*Carpomyia vesuviana*)**
This is not known to affect Fennel. Ber fly is a highly specific pest of Ber (*Ziziphus mauritiana*).

**Fruit Fly (*Bactrocera* species) in Fennel**
Fruit flies can infest the developing seeds/fruits of fennel, leading to significant yield and quality losses. An Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is recommended for effective control.

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Regularly collect and destroy all fallen, damaged, or infested fennel fruits/umbels. This helps to break the life cycle of the pest.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** After harvest, deep ploughing exposes pupae in the soil to predators and adverse environmental conditions, reducing the pest population for the next season.
*   **Timely Harvesting:** Harvest fennel fruits as soon as they reach maturity to prevent further infestation and reduce the period available for the flies to lay eggs.

**2. Mechanical/Physical Methods:**
*   **Pheromone Traps:** Install Methyl Eugenol traps at a rate of 4-5 traps per acre. These traps specifically attract and mass-trap male fruit flies, helping to reduce the breeding population. Replace the lures every 2-3 weeks.
*   **Bait Stations:** Prepare bait stations using attractants. A common method is to mix an insecticide with a protein source.

**3. Chemical Control (if infestation is severe and economic threshold is crossed):**
Chemical control should be used judiciously, preferably as bait sprays to minimize overall pesticide use and impact on beneficial insects. Always adhere to the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) mentioned on the product label.

*   **Bait Spray:**
    *   Mix 20 ml of **Malathion 50% EC** with 200 g of jaggery (gur) or 20 ml of protein hydrolysate in 10 litres of water.
    *   Spray this mixture on small patches of the crop (e.g., on a few leaves or on waste fruits) or on non-crop vegetation around the field. This attracts and kills adult fruit flies. Repeat at 7-10 day intervals, especially during the fruit development stage.

*   **Foliar Spray (if necessary, ensuring thorough coverage of developing fruits):**
    *   **Malathion 50% EC**: 1.0 - 1.5 litres per acre (or 2-3 ml per litre of water).
    *   **Dimethoate 30% EC**: 600 - 800 ml per acre (or 1.5-2 ml per litre of water).
    *   **Spinosad 45% SC**: 120 - 160 ml per acre (or 0.25-0.3 ml per litre of water). This is a good option for IPM due to its selective action and lower impact on beneficial insects.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and strictly follow the instructions and safety precautions provided on the pesticide label.
*   Ensure proper spray coverage, especially on the developing fruits where the flies lay eggs.
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.
*   Observe the recommended Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) to ensure the fennel produce is safe for consumption.
