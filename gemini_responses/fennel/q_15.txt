As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Fennel in Haryana:

### General Recommendations:
*   Always scout your fields regularly to detect pests early.
*   Use pesticides judiciously and only when necessary, following label instructions carefully.
*   Consider Integrated Pest Management (IPM) practices, including cultural controls, biological controls, and resistant varieties, to minimize pesticide use.
*   Ensure proper safety gear (gloves, mask, protective clothing) is used during pesticide application.

### Pest-Specific Control Measures:

#### 1. Grasshopper
Grasshoppers are polyphagous pests that can cause significant damage by feeding on fennel foliage, especially young plants.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Maintain field sanitation and remove weeds that can serve as alternate hosts.
    *   Deep ploughing after harvest can expose eggs to predators and desiccation.
*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
    *   **Malathion 50% EC**: Apply at 1.25 litres per acre in 500 litres of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC**: Apply at 100-125 ml per acre in 200-400 litres of water.
    *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC**: Apply at 1.0-1.25 litres per acre in 500 litres of water.

#### 2. Painted Bug (Bagrada hilaris)
While primarily a pest of cruciferous crops, Painted bug can occasionally infest fennel, especially if brassica crops are grown nearby. They suck sap from leaves and developing seeds.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Remove weeds, especially those belonging to the mustard family, from around fennel fields.
    *   Avoid planting fennel adjacent to mustard or other brassica crops.
*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
    *   **Malathion 50% EC**: Apply at 1.25 litres per acre in 500 litres of water.
    *   **Dimethoate 30% EC**: Apply at 660 ml per acre in 500 litres of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC**: Apply at 100-125 ml per acre in 200-400 litres of water.
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL**: Apply at 50-70 ml per acre in 200-400 litres of water for effective control of sucking pests.

#### 3. Red Cotton Bug (Dysdercus cingulatus)
This is not known to affect Fennel. Red cotton bug is primarily a pest of cotton and other malvaceous plants.

#### 4. Black Ants
Black ants are generally not direct pests of fennel, but they can be a nuisance, protect other sap-sucking pests like aphids (by feeding on their honeydew), or occasionally disturb roots if their nests are extensive near young plants.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Maintain good field sanitation to reduce food sources for ants.
    *   Control aphid infestations, as ants are often attracted to their honeydew.
*   **Chemical Control (Spot Treatment/Drenching):**
    *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC**: For drenching around ant nests or at the base of affected plants, mix 2.5 ml per litre of water and apply directly to the nests or affected areas.
    *   **Fipronil 0.3% GR**: For general soil application to manage ground-dwelling ants, apply at 10-15 kg per acre, incorporating it into the soil. This can be effective if ants are a persistent problem in the soil.
