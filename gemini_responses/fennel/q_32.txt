Drying up (drying branches, leaves, fruits, and flowers) in Fennel (Saunf) is a general symptom that can be caused by a variety of factors, both abiotic (environmental) and biotic (diseases and pests). As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I advise a systematic approach to identify the root cause for effective management in Haryana.

**I. Abiotic Factors (Environmental Stress)**

These are often the primary causes of widespread drying symptoms.

1.  **Water Stress:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Leaves wilt, turn yellow or brown, and eventually dry up. This can be due to either insufficient water (drought) or excessive water (waterlogging leading to root rot).
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Drought:** Ensure consistent and adequate irrigation, especially during critical growth stages (flowering and seed development). Use drip irrigation for efficient water use.
        *   **Waterlogging:** Improve soil drainage. Avoid overwatering. Plant on raised beds in areas prone to waterlogging.

2.  **Nutrient Deficiency/Imbalance:**
    *   **Symptoms:** General yellowing, stunted growth, and premature drying of leaves, often starting from older leaves.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Conduct a soil test to determine specific nutrient deficiencies.
        *   Apply balanced fertilizers based on soil test recommendations. For general health, ensure adequate Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium, along with micronutrients.

3.  **Heat Stress/Sun Scorch:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Leaves and tender parts may appear scorched, turn brown, and dry up, especially during hot, dry winds (loo) common in Haryana.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Provide light irrigation during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to cool the plant canopy.
        *   Apply mulch around the base of plants to conserve soil moisture and regulate soil temperature.

4.  **Soil Salinity/Alkalinity:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, marginal leaf burn, yellowing, and eventual drying, particularly in areas with poor quality irrigation water or saline soils.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Use good quality irrigation water.
        *   In saline-alkaline soils, apply gypsum (as per soil test recommendations) and incorporate organic matter to improve soil structure and leach salts.

**II. Biotic Factors (Diseases and Pests)**

If abiotic factors are ruled out, consider these biological causes.

**A. Diseases:**

1.  **Fusarium Wilt (Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. foeniculi):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Yellowing and wilting of leaves, often starting from one side of the plant or lower leaves, progressing upwards. The vascular tissue (stem cross-section) may show brown discoloration. Eventually, the entire plant dries up.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural:** Use resistant varieties if available. Practice long crop rotations (3-4 years) with non-host crops. Remove and destroy infected plant debris.
        *   **Chemical (Seed Treatment):** Treat seeds with **Carbendazim** (1-2 g/kg seed) or **Thiram** (2-3 g/kg seed).
        *   **Chemical (Soil Drench for established plants):** Drench the soil around affected plants with **Carbendazim** (1 g/L water) or **Propiconazole** (1 ml/L water).

2.  **Root Rot / Collar Rot (Pythium spp., Rhizoctonia solani, Phytophthora spp.):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Yellowing, wilting, and drying of leaves, often accompanied by rotting at the collar region (soil line) or roots. Affected plants can be easily pulled out.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural:** Ensure good drainage. Avoid waterlogging. Plant on raised beds.
        *   **Chemical (Seed Treatment):** Treat seeds with **Metalaxyl-M + Mancozeb** (2-3 g/kg seed).
        *   **Chemical (Soil Drench):** Drench the soil with **Propamocarb Hydrochloride** (2-3 ml/L water) or **Metalaxyl-M + Mancozeb** (2-2.5 g/L water) around the root zone.

3.  **Powdery Mildew (Erysiphe polygoni, Leveillula taurica):**
    *   **Symptoms:** White, powdery patches appear on leaves, stems, and sometimes flowers. In severe cases, leaves turn yellow, shrivel, and dry up prematurely.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural:** Ensure good air circulation by proper plant spacing.
        *   **Chemical:** Spray with **Sulphur** (wettable powder, 2-3 g/L water) or **Myclobutanil** (0.5 g/L water) or **Azoxystrobin** (0.5 ml/L water) at the first sign of disease.

4.  **Cercospora Blight (Cercospora foeniculi):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Small, circular to irregular brown spots with purplish margins appear on leaves and stems. Severe infection leads to blighting, defoliation, and drying of affected parts.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris. Practice crop rotation.
        *   **Chemical:** Spray with **Chlorothalonil** (2 g/L water) or **Mancozeb** (2.5 g/L water) or **Azoxystrobin** (0.5 ml/L water).

**B. Pests:**

1.  **Nematodes (Root-knot nematodes - Meloidogyne spp.):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Infested plants show stunted growth, yellowing, wilting, and premature drying, even with adequate water and nutrients. Inspection of roots reveals characteristic galls or swellings.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops (e.g., marigold, mustard). Solarize the soil during summer. Use nematode-resistant varieties if available.
        *   **Chemical (Pre-plant soil application for severe infestation):** Apply **Carbofuran** (granular, 10-15 kg/acre) or **Phorate** (granular, 4-6 kg/acre) to the soil before planting. *Note: Use these chemicals with extreme caution and only if absolutely necessary, following all safety guidelines.*

2.  **Stem Borers:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Wilting and drying of individual branches or the central shoot due to the larva boring into the stem, disrupting water and nutrient flow.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural:** Remove and destroy affected stems or plants.
        *   **Chemical:** If infestation is severe, spray with **Chlorantraniliprole** (0.3 ml/L water) or **Emamectin Benzoate** (0.2 g/L water).

**Recommendation:**

It is crucial to carefully observe the specific symptoms, their pattern of appearance, and environmental conditions to accurately diagnose the cause of "drying up" in your fennel crop. An integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods is most effective. For precise diagnosis and tailored recommendations, it is always advisable to bring a sample of the affected plant to the Department of Plant Pathology or Entomology at HAU, Hisar.
