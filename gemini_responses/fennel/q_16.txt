As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following fertilizer doses for Fennel (Saunf) cultivation in Haryana. Please note that these are general recommendations, and a soil test is always the most accurate method to determine precise nutrient requirements for your specific field conditions.

**General Nutrient Requirement for Fennel (per acre):**
*   **Nitrogen (N):** 70 kg/acre
*   **Phosphorus (P2O5):** 50 kg/acre
*   **Potassium (K2O):** 30 kg/acre
*   **Sulphur (S):** 20 kg/acre

### **I. Conventional Fertilizers**

**A. Primary Recommendation (using individual fertilizers):**

**1. Basal Application (at the time of sowing):**
*   **DAP (Di-ammonium Phosphate):** 110 kg/acre (Provides approximately 20 kg N and 50 kg P2O5)
*   **Muriate of Potash (MOP):** 50 kg/acre (Provides approximately 30 kg K2O)
*   **Sulphur (elemental 90%):** 22 kg/acre (Provides approximately 20 kg S)

**2. Top-dressing (30-45 days after sowing, at active vegetative growth stage):**
*   **Urea:** 110 kg/acre (Provides approximately 50 kg N)

**B. Alternative for Phosphorus and Sulphur:**

*   **Single Super Phosphate (SSP):** If you prefer to use **SSP** as a source of Phosphorus and Sulphur, it can replace **DAP** and separate **Sulphur**.
    *   **SSP (16% P2O5, 11% S):** 315 kg/acre (Basal application). This will provide approximately 50 kg P2O5 and 34 kg S.
    *   If using **SSP**, the Nitrogen provided by **DAP** (approx. 20 kg N) will be missing. Therefore, the **Urea** application needs to be adjusted:
        *   **Urea:** 50 kg/acre (Basal application) + 102 kg/acre (Top-dressing at 30-45 days after sowing).
    *   **Muriate of Potash:** 50 kg/acre (Basal application, as above).

**C. NPK (Complex Fertilizers):**

*   **NPK (Complex Fertilizers):** The dose of NPK complex fertilizers (e.g., 12:32:16, 10:26:26) will vary depending on the specific ratio of N, P, and K in the product. If using an NPK complex, it will partially or fully replace the individual **DAP**, **Muriate of Potash**, and a portion of **Urea**.
    *   For example, if using **NPK (12:32:16)**: Approximately 156 kg/acre can be applied basally to meet the P requirement. This would then need to be supplemented with additional **Muriate of Potash** and **Urea** to achieve the recommended total N and K. It is crucial to calculate the remaining nutrient requirements based on the specific NPK grade used.

### **II. Nano Fertilizers (Foliar Application)**

Nano fertilizers are designed for foliar application and act as supplements to conventional soil-applied fertilizers, enhancing nutrient use efficiency. They are not meant to fully replace basal applications of P and K.

*   **Nano-Urea:**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml/L of water.
    *   **Application:** Apply 1-2 sprays during the active vegetative growth stage (e.g., 30-45 days after sowing and again at pre-flowering stage), ensuring complete foliage coverage. This can help reduce the requirement of conventional **Urea** by up to 50%.

*   **Nano-DAP:**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml/L of water.
    *   **Application:** Apply 1-2 sprays during the early vegetative and pre-flowering stages. This can supplement the Phosphorus and Nitrogen supply, potentially reducing the need for conventional **DAP** by up to 50%.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always ensure uniform application of fertilizers.
*   Irrigate the field after fertilizer application, especially for top-dressing, to ensure nutrient availability and prevent burning.
*   Monitor your crop for any nutrient deficiency symptoms and consult with HAU experts for specific advice.
