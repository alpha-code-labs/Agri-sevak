As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following cultivation practices for Fennel (Saunf) in Haryana:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   Fennel is primarily sown directly in the field.
    *   Sowing should be done in rows to facilitate inter-cultivation operations, weeding, and harvesting.
    *   Broadcasting is generally not recommended for commercial cultivation due to uneven plant stand.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   The ideal planting depth for Fennel seeds is **1.5 - 2.5 cm**. Shallow planting is crucial for good germination and emergence.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   **Row-to-row spacing:** Maintain a distance of **45 - 60 cm** between rows.
    *   **Plant-to-plant spacing:** After germination and initial growth, thin the seedlings to achieve a plant-to-plant spacing of **15 - 20 cm** within the rows.

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   For direct sowing, a seed dose of **4 - 6 kg per acre** is recommended to ensure an optimum plant population.
