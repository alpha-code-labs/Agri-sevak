As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for fennel (Saunf) transplantation in Haryana:

**Ideal Transplantation Time:**
Fennel is primarily grown as a Rabi crop in Haryana.
*   The ideal time for transplanting fennel seedlings is from **late September to mid-October**. This timing allows the crop to establish well before the peak winter and mature during the cooler, dry period, which is conducive for good bulb development and seed production.

**Transplantation Distance:**
Proper spacing is crucial for optimal growth, air circulation, and yield.
*   **Row-to-Row Distance:** Maintain a distance of **60-75 cm** between rows.
*   **Plant-to-Plant Distance:** Maintain a distance of **30-45 cm** within the row.
    *   *Note:* Closer spacing (e.g., 60x30 cm) can be used for seed production, while wider spacing (e.g., 75x45 cm) is often preferred for bulb production to allow for larger bulb development.

**Transplantation Process:**

1.  **Nursery Preparation:**
    *   Fennel seeds are typically sown in well-prepared nursery beds 4-6 weeks before the intended transplanting date.
    *   The nursery beds should be raised, well-drained, and enriched with farmyard manure.
    *   Sow seeds thinly at a depth of 1-2 cm and cover lightly with soil.
    *   Keep the nursery bed consistently moist.

2.  **Seedling Age and Size:**
    *   Seedlings are ready for transplanting when they are **4-6 weeks old** and have attained a height of **10-15 cm** with 4-5 true leaves.
    *   Hardening off the seedlings (gradually exposing them to outdoor conditions for a week before transplanting) can improve their survival rate.

3.  **Main Field Preparation:**
    *   The main field should be well-ploughed and harrowed to achieve a fine tilth.
    *   Incorporate 10-15 tonnes of well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost per acre during land preparation.
    *   Prepare irrigation channels and ridges/furrows according to the desired spacing.

4.  **Transplanting Procedure:**
    *   **Pre-irrigation:** Lightly irrigate the nursery bed a few hours before transplanting to ease the removal of seedlings with minimal root damage. Also, pre-irrigate the main field if the soil is dry.
    *   **Lifting Seedlings:** Carefully lift the seedlings from the nursery bed, ensuring as much soil as possible adheres to the roots (root ball). Avoid damaging the delicate root system.
    *   **Planting:** Make small holes at the predetermined spacing on the ridges or flatbeds. Place one seedling per hole, ensuring the planting depth is similar to that in the nursery.
    *   **Firming Soil:** Gently firm the soil around the base of each seedling to ensure good root-to-soil contact and remove air pockets.
    *   **Post-transplant Irrigation:** Immediately after transplanting, provide a light irrigation to help the seedlings settle and reduce transplant shock.

5.  **Post-Transplant Care:**
    *   Maintain adequate moisture in the field, especially during the initial establishment phase.
    *   Monitor for pests and diseases and take appropriate action if necessary.
    *   Weeding should be done regularly to reduce competition for nutrients and water.
