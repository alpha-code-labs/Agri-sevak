Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling mites in Fennel (Saunf) in Haryana. Both Red Spider Mite (*Tetranychus urticae*) and Rust Mite (*Aculops foeniculi* or similar eriophyid mites) are significant pests of Fennel, especially during dry and warm weather conditions.

**Symptoms of Mite Infestation:**

*   **Red Spider Mite:** Yellowish-white speckles on the upper leaf surface, bronzing or reddening of leaves, fine webbing on the underside of leaves, and eventual leaf drop.
*   **Rust Mite:** Russeting or bronzing of leaves, stems, and umbels, stunted growth, and distorted plant parts.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Approach:**

Effective mite control involves a combination of cultural, mechanical, and chemical methods.

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**

*   **Regular Monitoring:** Inspect your fennel crop regularly, especially the undersides of leaves, for early signs of mites.
*   **Proper Irrigation:** Mites thrive in dry, dusty conditions. Overhead irrigation or frequent light irrigation can help wash off mites and increase humidity, which is unfavorable for them.
*   **Weed Management:** Remove weeds from around the fennel field as they can act as alternate hosts for mites.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation to break the pest cycle.
*   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy severely infested plant parts to reduce mite populations.

**2. Chemical Control (Acaricides):**

When mite populations are high and cultural methods are insufficient, chemical control becomes necessary. Always rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development. Ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves.

Here are some CIBRC approved acaricides recommended for mite control in Fennel:

*   **Spiromesifen (22.9% SC):**
    *   Dosage: **120-150 ml per acre** (or 0.6-0.75 ml per litre of water).
    *   Mode of Action: Inhibits lipid biosynthesis, effective against all mite stages.

*   **Fenpyroximate (5% SC):**
    *   Dosage: **250-300 ml per acre** (or 1.25-1.5 ml per litre of water).
    *   Mode of Action: Contact and stomach action, affects nervous system.

*   **Propargite (57% EC):**
    *   Dosage: **500 ml per acre** (or 2.5 ml per litre of water).
    *   Mode of Action: Contact action, effective against motile stages.

*   **Wettable Sulphur (80% WP):**
    *   Dosage: **400-600 g per acre** (or 2.0-3.0 g per litre of water).
    *   Mode of Action: Contact and fumigant action, effective against both red spider mites and rust mites, also has fungicidal properties. Best used in cooler parts of the day to avoid phytotoxicity.

*   **Abamectin (1.9% EC):**
    *   Dosage: **150-200 ml per acre** (or 0.75-1.0 ml per litre of water).
    *   Mode of Action: Translaminar action, affects nervous system, effective against spider mites.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Spray Volume:** Ensure adequate spray volume (typically 200 litres per acre for field crops) to achieve thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where mites reside.
*   **Resistance Management:** Do not use the same acaricide repeatedly. Rotate between different chemical groups (different modes of action) to prevent mites from developing resistance.
*   **Timing:** Apply acaricides when mite populations are building up, before they cause severe damage. Early morning or late evening sprays are recommended to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   **Safety:** Always read and follow the instructions on the product label, including dosage, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI). Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying.
