Namaste, Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I will provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling Dieback, Twig blight, and Tikka disease in Fennel, keeping in mind the conditions in Haryana.

### Control of Dieback and Twig Blight in Fennel

Dieback and Twig Blight in fennel are often caused by fungal pathogens such as *Alternaria* spp., *Phoma* spp., or *Fusarium* spp. These diseases manifest as drying back of shoots from the tip (dieback) or lesions and blighting of stems and shoots (twig blight/stem blight), leading to wilting and eventual death of affected plant parts.

**Integrated Management Strategies:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Sanitation:** Regularly inspect your field. Remove and destroy all infected plant debris, including fallen leaves and diseased shoots, to reduce the inoculum source.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops to break the disease cycle.
    *   **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to improve air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce humidity and fungal growth.
    *   **Balanced Nutrition:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, as it can promote lush, tender growth that is more susceptible to fungal infections. Use balanced NPK fertilizers based on soil test recommendations.
    *   **Irrigation Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation late in the day, which can leave foliage wet for prolonged periods. Drip irrigation or furrow irrigation is preferable.

2.  **Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
    For effective control, apply fungicides preventively or at the first sign of symptoms. It is crucial to alternate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

    *   **For Protective/Preventive Application:**
        *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP): Apply at 2.0-2.5 kg per acre, mixed in 200-250 litres of water.
        *   **Chlorothalonil** (75% WP): Apply at 1.0-1.5 kg per acre, mixed in 200-250 litres of water.

    *   **For Curative Application (at disease onset):**
        *   **Propiconazole** (25% EC): Apply at 200-250 ml per acre, mixed in 200-250 litres of water.
        *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC): Apply at 200-250 ml per acre, mixed in 200-250 litres of water.

    *   **Application Frequency:** Repeat sprays at 10-15 day intervals, depending on disease severity and weather conditions. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and pre-harvest interval (PHI).

### Tikka Disease in Fennel

This is not known to affect Fennel. Tikka disease is a specific leaf spot disease primarily affecting groundnut (*Arachis hypogaea*), caused by *Cercospora arachidicola* and *Phaeoisariopsis personata*.
