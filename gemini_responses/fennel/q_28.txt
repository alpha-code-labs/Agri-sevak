As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide scientifically verified advice on protecting your Fennel crop from various environmental stresses common in Haryana. Fennel (Foeniculum vulgare) is generally a hardy crop, but extreme weather conditions can significantly impact its growth and yield.

Here's how to protect your Fennel from environmental stress:

### 1. Protection from Extreme Cold and Frost

Fennel is relatively tolerant to cold but can suffer damage from severe frost, especially during its early growth stages or flowering.

*   **Site Selection:** Avoid planting in low-lying areas where cold air tends to settle. Fields with good air drainage are preferable.
*   **Irrigation:**
    *   Apply a light irrigation to the field a day or two before a predicted frost event. Moist soil retains heat better than dry soil and releases it slowly during the night, raising the ambient temperature slightly.
    *   Overhead irrigation can also be used during frost events, but this requires continuous application throughout the frost period and can be water-intensive.
*   **Mulching:**
    *   Apply a thick layer (5-10 cm) of organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves, sugarcane trash) around the base of the plants. This insulates the soil, prevents heat loss, and protects the root zone from freezing.
*   **Row Covers/Agro-nets:**
    *   For small areas or high-value crops, cover plants with **non-woven agro-textile covers** (e.g., 25-30 GSM spun-bonded polypropylene fabric) or plastic sheets before nightfall. Ensure the covers do not touch the foliage directly. Remove them during the day to allow sunlight and air circulation.
*   **Windbreaks:**
    *   Planting natural windbreaks (e.g., tall trees, hedges) or erecting artificial barriers on the northern and western sides of the field can reduce the impact of cold winds.
*   **Smudge Fires (for severe frost):**
    *   In extreme cases, burning organic material (like crop residue, sawdust) on the upwind side of the field can create a smoke blanket that traps heat and prevents radiation heat loss. This should be done carefully, ensuring proper ventilation and avoiding excessive smoke pollution.

### 2. Protection from Heat (Loo) and Intense Sunlight

High temperatures, especially accompanied by hot, dry winds (Loo), and intense sunlight can cause scorching, wilting, and reduced seed set in Fennel.

*   **Irrigation:**
    *   Maintain adequate soil moisture through frequent, light irrigations during hot periods. This helps in evaporative cooling of the plant canopy and prevents water stress. Drip irrigation is highly efficient for this purpose.
*   **Mulching:**
    *   Apply organic mulch to the soil surface. This helps to keep the soil cool, reduces evaporation, and conserves soil moisture, thereby mitigating the effects of high temperatures on roots.
*   **Shade Nets:**
    *   For sensitive stages or during peak summer, installing **agro-shade nets** (e.g., 30-50% shade factor) over the crop can significantly reduce direct solar radiation and ambient temperature, protecting plants from scorching and heat stress.
*   **Windbreaks:**
    *   Planting shelterbelts or erecting artificial windbreaks on the western and southern sides of the field can reduce the desiccating effect of hot winds (Loo), preventing excessive transpiration and wilting.
*   **Planting Time:**
    *   Adjust planting schedules to avoid the most intense heat periods during critical growth stages like flowering and seed development. In Haryana, late September to October planting is generally preferred for Fennel to avoid extreme summer heat during its reproductive phase.
*   **Proper Spacing:**
    *   Ensure optimal plant spacing. Overly dense planting can lead to competition for water and nutrients, exacerbating heat stress. Adequate spacing allows for better air circulation and light penetration.
