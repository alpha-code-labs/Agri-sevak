As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the maturity signs, harvesting time, and cutting process for Fennel (Saunf) in Haryana:

### Maturity Signs for Fennel (Saunf)

The maturity of fennel for seed harvest is indicated by several visual cues:

*   **Seed Color Change:** The most crucial indicator is the change in the color of the seeds within the umbels (flower clusters). They will transition from a bright green to a dull green, then yellowish-green, and finally to a characteristic grayish-green or light brown color.
*   **Seed Firmness:** The seeds should feel firm and hard when pressed between the fingers. Immature seeds will be soft and pliable.
*   **Drying of Foliage:** The leaves and stems of the plant will start to turn yellow and dry out, signaling the plant's physiological maturity for seed production.
*   **Umbels Appearance:** The umbels themselves will appear dry and somewhat brittle.
*   **Shattering Risk:** It is vital to observe the crop closely, as over-maturity can lead to significant seed shattering, resulting in yield losses.

### Harvesting Time for Fennel (Saunf)

*   Fennel typically reaches maturity for seed harvest approximately **150-180 days** after sowing, depending on the specific variety, prevailing agro-climatic conditions, and sowing date.
*   The optimal time for harvesting is when **50-70% of the umbels** on the plant have matured, and the seeds have attained their characteristic grayish-green or light brown color and firmness.
*   Harvesting should ideally be done in the **morning after the dew has dried**, but before the intense heat of midday. This helps minimize shattering losses, as the plants are less brittle.

### Cutting Process for Fennel (Saunf)

The harvesting and post-harvesting process for fennel seeds typically involves the following steps:

*   **Cutting the Plants:**
    *   In Haryana, manual harvesting is the most common method. The entire plant is cut close to the ground using a sickle.
    *   Alternatively, if maturity is uneven, only the mature umbels can be harvested in multiple pickings. However, cutting the whole plant is more prevalent for varieties with relatively uniform maturity.
*   **Bundling:** The cut plants or umbels are gathered into small bundles.
*   **Drying/Curing:** These bundles are then stacked upright in the field or transported to a clean, dry area (e.g., a threshing floor) for sun-drying. This curing process usually takes **5-7 days**, allowing any remaining immature seeds to mature and the plants to dry thoroughly. Proper drying is crucial to prevent mold growth and facilitate threshing.
*   **Threshing:** Once completely dry, the seeds are separated from the plant material.
    *   This can be done by gently beating the bundles with sticks.
    *   For larger quantities, small tractor-operated threshers or trampling by bullocks can be employed.
*   **Cleaning:** The threshed seeds are then winnowed to remove chaff, dust, and other impurities.
*   **Storage:** The cleaned seeds should be further dried to a safe moisture content (typically below **8-10%**) before being stored in clean, dry bags in a well-ventilated area to maintain quality and prevent spoilage.
