Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I will provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling borers, caterpillars, Diamondback moth, and leaf folders in Fennel (Saunf) crops in Haryana. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is always recommended for sustainable and effective control.

### General Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Principles for Fennel:

*   **Regular Scouting:** Regularly inspect your field for early signs of pest infestation (egg masses, young larvae, damaged leaves).
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy crop residues, weeds, and volunteer plants that can harbor pests.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation to break the pest life cycle.
*   **Conservation of Natural Enemies:** Avoid indiscriminate use of broad-spectrum pesticides that can harm beneficial insects like parasitoids and predators.
*   **Proper Nutrition and Irrigation:** Maintain optimal plant health, as stressed plants are more susceptible to pest attacks.

### Specific Control Measures:

#### 1. Borers (e.g., Stem Borer, Fruit Borer)

Borers can cause significant damage by tunneling into stems, flower stalks, or developing fruits, leading to wilting, drying, and reduced yield. Common borers affecting fennel can include larvae of *Spodoptera litura* (Tobacco caterpillar) or *Helicoverpa armigera* (Gram pod borer) which may bore into fruits.

*   **Cultural and Biological Control:**
    *   Remove and destroy infested plant parts showing signs of boring.
    *   Use pheromone traps to monitor adult moth activity and mass trap them (e.g., for *Spodoptera litura* or *Helicoverpa armigera*).
    *   Apply formulations of **Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)** at the larval stage, as per manufacturer's instructions (e.g., 500-1000 g per acre).

*   **Chemical Control (Apply when infestation crosses Economic Threshold Level):**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC**: 60 ml per acre.
    *   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG**: 88-100 g per acre.
    *   **Flubendiamide 20% WG**: 50 g per acre.
    *   **Indoxacarb 14.5% SC**: 200 ml per acre.

#### 2. Caterpillars (General Leaf and Fruit Feeders)

Various caterpillar species, such as *Spodoptera litura* (Tobacco caterpillar), *Helicoverpa armigera* (Gram pod borer), and *Papilio demoleus* (Lemon butterfly larvae), can feed on fennel leaves, flowers, and developing fruits.

*   **Cultural and Biological Control:**
    *   Hand-pick and destroy egg masses and young larvae, especially in the early stages of infestation.
    *   Use pheromone traps for monitoring and mass trapping adult moths.
    *   Apply formulations of **Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)** at the larval stage, as per manufacturer's instructions (e.g., 500-1000 g per acre).

*   **Chemical Control (Apply when infestation crosses Economic Threshold Level):**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC**: 60 ml per acre.
    *   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG**: 88-100 g per acre.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC**: 100-120 ml per acre.
    *   **Novaluron 10% EC**: 300 ml per acre.
    *   **Quinalphos 25% EC**: 800-1000 ml per acre.

#### 3. Diamondback Moth (*Plutella xylostella*)

This is not known to affect Fennel. Diamondback moth is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower, mustard).

#### 4. Leaf Folder

Leaf folders typically fold or roll leaves and feed from within, causing defoliation and affecting photosynthesis. While specific leaf folders for fennel are less common, general lepidopteran larvae can exhibit this behavior.

*   **Cultural and Biological Control:**
    *   Manually remove and destroy folded leaves containing larvae.
    *   Apply formulations of **Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)** at the larval stage, as per manufacturer's instructions (e.g., 500-1000 g per acre).

*   **Chemical Control (Apply when infestation crosses Economic Threshold Level):**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC**: 60 ml per acre.
    *   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG**: 88-100 g per acre.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC**: 100-120 ml per acre.
    *   **Indoxacarb 14.5% SC**: 200 ml per acre.

**Important Considerations for Chemical Application:**

*   Always mix the recommended quantity of chemical in 200-400 litres of water per acre, ensuring thorough coverage of the crop canopy.
*   Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the pesticide label regarding dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying.
