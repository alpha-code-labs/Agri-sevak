Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm that Scale insects and Mealybugs are indeed significant pests that can affect Fennel (Saunf) cultivation in Haryana, leading to reduced plant vigour, sooty mould development, and yield losses.

Effective control requires an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods.

### Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Scale Insects and Mealybugs in Fennel:

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   **Regular Scouting:** Frequently inspect fennel plants, especially the undersides of leaves, stems, and leaf axils, for early signs of infestation.
*   **Pruning and Destruction:** Immediately prune and destroy heavily infested plant parts (leaves, stems) to prevent further spread.
*   **High-Pressure Water Spray:** For small, localized infestations, a strong jet of water can dislodge mealybugs and young scales. This is more effective for mealybugs.
*   **Weed Management:** Keep the field free of weeds, as they can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
*   **Proper Plant Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to improve air circulation and reduce humidity, which can discourage pest proliferation.

**2. Biological Control:**
*   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Encourage and protect natural predators like ladybird beetles (e.g., *Cryptolaemus montrouzieri* for mealybugs), lacewings, and parasitic wasps, which naturally prey on scale insects and mealybugs. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

**3. Chemical Control (When infestation is severe and other methods are insufficient):**
When chemical intervention becomes necessary, choose CIBRC approved insecticides and ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and stems where these pests tend to aggregate. Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

Here are some CIBRC approved technical chemical names effective against Scale insects and Mealybugs:

*   **Buprofezin 25% SC** (Insect Growth Regulator, effective against nymphs):
    *   Dosage: 500 ml per acre (or 1 ml per litre of water for foliar spray).
*   **Spirotetramat 150 OD** (Systemic insecticide, effective against all stages, especially hidden pests):
    *   Dosage: 200-250 ml per acre (or 0.4-0.5 ml per litre of water).
*   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL** (Systemic Neonicotinoid, effective against sucking pests):
    *   Dosage: 100-125 ml per acre (or 0.2-0.25 ml per litre of water).
*   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG** (Systemic Neonicotinoid, effective against sucking pests):
    *   Dosage: 100 g per acre (or 0.2 g per litre of water).
*   **Acetamiprid 20% SP** (Systemic Neonicotinoid, effective against sucking pests):
    *   Dosage: 100-125 g per acre (or 0.2-0.25 g per litre of water).
*   **Azadirachtin 1500 ppm** (Neem oil based formulation, acts as antifeedant, repellent, and IGR; suitable for early stages or as a rotational spray):
    *   Dosage: 2.5-5 ml per litre of water.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Thorough Coverage:** Ensure the spray reaches all parts of the plant, especially the undersides of leaves and stem crevices where these pests hide.
*   **Rotation:** Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Strictly adhere to the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) mentioned on the product label, especially since fennel is an edible crop.
*   **Application Time:** Apply insecticides during the cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) while handling and applying pesticides.
