Addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium) in Fennel (Saunf) is crucial for healthy growth and optimal yield. The most accurate way to determine specific nutrient needs is through a comprehensive **soil test**. This will provide precise recommendations for your field. However, based on common symptoms and general recommendations for Haryana, here's how to address these deficiencies:

### General Recommendation:
Always conduct a soil test before applying any fertilizers to ensure balanced nutrition and prevent over-application, which can be detrimental and uneconomical.

### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   General yellowing of older leaves (chlorosis), starting from the tips and margins.
*   Stunted growth and reduced plant vigor.
*   Thin, spindly stems.

**Correction:**

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Urea** (46% N) at a rate of 60-80 kg N per acre, typically split into 2-3 applications. For example, apply 1/3rd at sowing/transplanting, and the remaining in 1-2 top dressings during vegetative growth.
    *   This translates to approximately 130-175 kg **Urea** per acre, split.
    *   Ensure proper irrigation after application to facilitate nutrient uptake.

*   **Foliar Application (for quick recovery):**
    *   Spray a 0.5-1.0% solution of **Urea**.
    *   Mix 5-10 g of **Urea** per litre of water.
    *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 7-10 day intervals, preferably in the morning or late afternoon.

### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   Dark green or purplish discoloration of older leaves, especially on the undersides.
*   Stunted root development, leading to poor anchorage and nutrient uptake.
*   Delayed maturity and reduced seed formation.

**Correction:**

*   **Soil Application (Basal application is most effective):**
    *   Apply 40-60 kg P2O5 per acre at the time of sowing or transplanting.
    *   This can be achieved using:
        *   **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5): Apply 85-130 kg **DAP** per acre.
        *   **Single Superphosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5): Apply 250-375 kg **SSP** per acre.
    *   Phosphorus is less mobile in the soil, so it should be incorporated into the soil near the root zone.

*   **Foliar Application (for immediate relief, but less effective than soil application for P):**
    *   Spray a 0.5-1.0% solution of **Monoammonium Phosphate (MAP)** (12% N, 61% P2O5) or **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)**.
    *   Mix 5-10 g of **Monoammonium Phosphate (MAP)** or **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)** per litre of water.
    *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals.

### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   Yellowing and scorching (browning) of leaf margins, especially on older leaves, progressing inwards.
*   Weak stems, leading to lodging.
*   Poor disease resistance and reduced seed quality.

**Correction:**

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply 40-60 kg K2O per acre, preferably at sowing or transplanting, with a portion as top dressing.
    *   This can be achieved using:
        *   **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** (60% K2O): Apply 65-100 kg **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** per acre.
        *   **Sulphate of Potash (SOP)** (50% K2O): Apply 80-120 kg **Sulphate of Potash (SOP)** per acre.

*   **Foliar Application (for quick recovery):**
    *   Spray a 0.5-1.0% solution of **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** or **Potassium Sulphate**.
    *   Mix 5-10 g of **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** or **Potassium Sulphate** per litre of water.
    *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 7-10 day intervals.

### Important Considerations:

*   **Soil Testing:** This remains the cornerstone of nutrient management. Regular soil testing (every 2-3 years) helps in precise fertilizer recommendations.
*   **Organic Matter:** Incorporating farmyard manure (FYM) or compost improves soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability over the long term.
*   **Timing:** Apply fertilizers at appropriate growth stages for maximum efficiency.
*   **Irrigation:** Ensure adequate moisture in the soil for nutrient uptake, especially after soil application of fertilizers.
*   **Split Applications:** For Nitrogen and Potassium, split applications are more efficient than a single large dose, reducing losses and ensuring continuous availability.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively manage macro-nutrient deficiencies in your Fennel crop and ensure a healthy, productive harvest.
