Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm that Wilt, primarily caused by *Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. foeniculi*, is a significant disease affecting Fennel (Saunf) in our region. While "Parawilt" is a term more commonly associated with other crops, the symptoms of severe wilting in fennel are devastating and require comprehensive management.

Here's a scientifically verified approach to control Wilt in Fennel:

**I. Cultural and Agronomic Practices (Prevention is Key):**

1.  **Resistant Varieties:** Where available, select and plant fennel varieties known to have resistance or tolerance to Fusarium wilt. Consult with HAU extension services for region-specific recommendations.
2.  **Crop Rotation:** Implement a strict 3-4 year crop rotation plan with non-host crops such as cereals (wheat, barley) or legumes (chickpea, lentil). Avoid continuous cultivation of fennel or other susceptible umbelliferous crops (e.g., coriander, cumin).
3.  **Soil Solarization:** During the hot summer months (May-June), prepare the field, irrigate it, and cover it with a transparent polyethylene sheet for 4-6 weeks. This raises soil temperature, effectively killing soil-borne pathogens, including Fusarium spores.
4.  **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy all infected plant debris from the field immediately after harvest to reduce the inoculum load in the soil.
5.  **Healthy Seed Material:** Always use certified, disease-free seeds from reputable sources.
6.  **Optimized Irrigation:** Avoid excessive irrigation and waterlogging, as moist conditions can favor fungal growth and spread. Ensure good drainage in the field.
7.  **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced fertilization based on soil test reports. Over-application of nitrogen can sometimes make plants more susceptible, while adequate potassium can improve plant vigor and resistance.
8.  **Weed Management:** Keep the field free of weeds, as they can compete for nutrients and sometimes act as alternate hosts for pathogens.

**II. Biological Control:**

1.  **Seed Treatment:**
    *   Treat seeds with **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum** (bio-fungicide) at a rate of 5-10 g/kg seed before sowing.
2.  **Soil Application:**
    *   Mix **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum** (1-2 kg/acre) with 50-100 kg of farmyard manure (FYM) or compost. Keep the mixture moist for 7-10 days in a shaded area, then broadcast it evenly in the field before sowing or transplanting.

**III. Chemical Control:**

**A. Seed Treatment (Crucial for early protection):**

1.  Treat fennel seeds with either of the following fungicides before sowing:
    *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: 2-3 g/kg seed
    *   **Thiophanate-methyl** 70% WP: 2-3 g/kg seed

**B. Soil Drenching (For managing disease in standing crop):**

1.  If wilt symptoms appear in isolated plants or patches, drench the soil around the root zone of affected and surrounding healthy plants with one of the following fungicides:
    *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: 1-2 g/L of water (apply 200-500 ml solution per plant, depending on plant size).
    *   **Thiophanate-methyl** 70% WP: 1-1.5 g/L of water (apply 200-500 ml solution per plant).

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label for safe and effective use.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in pathogens.
*   For specific local recommendations and the latest CIBRC approved products, please consult your nearest Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or the Department of Agriculture, Haryana.
