Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I am pleased to provide you with the scientifically verified recommendations for the application of organic manures in Fennel cultivation for the Haryana region.

Fennel (Saunf) responds very well to organic matter, which improves soil health, water retention, and nutrient availability, leading to better yield and quality.

Here are the recommended doses:

*   **Farmyard Manure (FYM):**
    Apply 15-20 tonnes per acre (approximately 15,000-20,000 kg per acre) of well-decomposed FYM. This should be incorporated thoroughly into the soil during the initial land preparation, at least 2-3 weeks before sowing. Well-decomposed FYM ensures a slow and steady release of nutrients and avoids issues with weed seeds or pest harborage.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    Vermicompost is a richer source of nutrients and beneficial microbes compared to FYM. It can be applied at a rate of 3-5 tonnes per acre (approximately 3,000-5,000 kg per acre) during land preparation. It can also be used as a partial substitute for FYM or as a top-dressing later in the crop cycle, though initial incorporation is highly beneficial for root establishment.

*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract):**
    Sagarika is a biostimulant derived from seaweed, known to promote root development, enhance nutrient uptake, and improve overall plant vigour and stress tolerance. It is typically applied as a foliar spray.
    *   **Foliar Spray Dose:** Apply **2-3 ml per litre of water**.
    *   **Application Timing:**
        *   **First Spray:** Approximately 30-45 days after sowing, during the active vegetative growth stage.
        *   **Second Spray:** At the initiation of flowering/umbel formation stage.
        *   **Third Spray (Optional):** During the fruit development stage, if the crop shows signs of stress or to boost yield and quality.
    *   Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage during spraying.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Soil Testing:** It is always advisable to conduct a soil test before planting to understand the specific nutrient status and organic carbon content of your field. This allows for more precise and efficient nutrient management.
*   **Incorporation:** Ensure that FYM and Vermicompost are well-incorporated into the soil for maximum benefit.
*   **Watering:** Adequate soil moisture is crucial for the decomposition of organic manures and the uptake of nutrients by the plants.

By following these recommendations, you can significantly enhance the health and productivity of your Fennel crop.
