Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I understand your concern regarding dropping of flowers and developing fruits in Fennel. This is a common physiological issue that can significantly impact yield. "Boll dropping" is a term more commonly associated with cotton; in fennel, it refers to the dropping of developing umbels or individual fruits.

Dropping in fennel is primarily a physiological response to various stresses or imbalances, rather than a specific disease or pest. The plant sheds flowers or young fruits to conserve resources when conditions are unfavorable or when it has set more fruits than it can sustain.

Here are the primary causes and scientifically verified control measures for dropping in fennel:

### Primary Causes of Dropping in Fennel:

1.  **Water Stress:** Both insufficient (drought) and excessive (waterlogging) soil moisture can lead to flower and fruit drop.
2.  **Nutrient Deficiencies:**
    *   **Boron (B):** Critical for pollen germination, pollen tube growth, and fruit set. Deficiency is a common cause of dropping.
    *   **Calcium (Ca):** Essential for cell wall integrity and fruit development. Deficiency can lead to poor fruit quality and dropping.
    *   **Potassium (K):** Plays a vital role in water regulation, nutrient transport, and overall plant vigor, indirectly affecting fruit retention.
3.  **Temperature Extremes:** Very high or very low temperatures during flowering and fruit development can impair pollen viability and fruit set.
4.  **Poor Pollination:** Inadequate activity of pollinators (like bees) due to adverse weather or lack of pollinator-friendly environment can result in unfertilized flowers that drop.
5.  **Over-bearing:** If the plant sets an excessive number of flowers/fruits, it may naturally shed some to balance its resource allocation.
6.  **Soil Salinity/Alkalinity:** High salt content or alkaline pH in the soil (common in parts of Haryana) can stress plants, leading to dropping.

### Control Measures:

To effectively manage dropping in fennel, an integrated approach focusing on optimal cultural practices and targeted nutrient management is recommended:

1.  **Soil Testing:**
    *   Conduct regular soil tests to determine nutrient status and soil pH. This is the foundation for any effective nutrient management plan.

2.  **Optimal Irrigation Management:**
    *   Maintain consistent soil moisture, especially during flowering and fruit development stages.
    *   Avoid both water stress (drought) and waterlogging. Irrigate judiciously based on soil type, weather conditions, and crop stage. Drip irrigation is highly recommended for efficient water use.

3.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Boron (B) Application:**
        *   If soil test indicates Boron deficiency, or as a preventive measure during flowering:
        *   Foliar spray of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (e.g., Solubor) at 1-2 g/L of water (0.1-0.2% solution). Apply at pre-flowering and again at early fruit set stage.
    *   **Calcium (Ca) Application:**
        *   If Calcium deficiency is suspected or as a general support for fruit development:
        *   Foliar spray of **Calcium nitrate** at 5-10 g/L of water (0.5-1% solution). Apply during flowering and early fruit development.
    *   **Potassium (K) Application:**
        *   Ensure adequate Potassium levels based on soil test. Potassium helps in overall plant health and stress tolerance.
        *   If deficiency is noted, apply **Potassium sulphate** (0-0-50) as per soil test recommendations, or a foliar spray of **Potassium nitrate** (13-0-45) at 10-20 g/L of water (1-2% solution) during flowering and fruit development.

4.  **Enhance Pollination:**
    *   Encourage pollinator activity by avoiding insecticide sprays during peak flowering hours.
    *   Consider placing bee hives near the field if natural pollinator populations are low.

5.  **Temperature and Humidity Management:**
    *   While direct control over weather is not possible, ensuring good plant vigor through proper nutrition and irrigation helps plants withstand minor temperature fluctuations.
    *   Planting at optimal times for your region in Haryana can help avoid extreme temperatures during critical stages.

6.  **General Plant Health:**
    *   Ensure balanced primary nutrient (N, P, K) application as per soil test recommendations.
    *   Manage weeds effectively to reduce competition for water and nutrients.
    *   Monitor for any pest or disease outbreaks that might indirectly stress the plant and lead to dropping. While not a direct cause of dropping, severe infestations can weaken the plant.

By implementing these measures, you can significantly reduce flower and fruit dropping in your fennel crop and achieve a better yield. Always consult your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions.
