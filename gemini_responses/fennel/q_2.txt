As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding rust diseases in Fennel (Saunf) for Haryana.

It is important to clarify the specific rust diseases mentioned:

*   **Black Rust (*Puccinia graminis*):** This is not known to affect Fennel. It primarily affects cereal crops like wheat.
*   **Brown Rust (*Puccinia recondita*):** This is not known to affect Fennel. It primarily affects cereal crops like wheat and barley.
*   **Yellow Rust (*Puccinia striiformis*):** This is not known to affect Fennel. It primarily affects cereal crops like wheat.
*   **White Rust (*Albugo candida*):** This is not known to affect Fennel. It primarily affects cruciferous crops (mustards, cabbage, etc.).
*   **Red Rust:** This is not a specific fungal disease name for Fennel. It can sometimes be a colloquial term or refer to algal diseases in other crops.

The primary rust disease affecting Fennel is caused by *Puccinia foeniculi*. This is the true rust of fennel. Control measures should focus on managing this specific pathogen.

**Control Measures for Rust (*Puccinia foeniculi*) in Fennel:**

An integrated approach combining cultural practices and judicious chemical application is recommended for effective management.

**I. Cultural and Agronomic Practices:**

1.  **Resistant Varieties:** Where available, choose fennel varieties known to have resistance or tolerance to rust. Consult with HAU for recommended varieties suitable for Haryana.
2.  **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting fennel in the same field year after year. Rotate with non-host crops for at least 2-3 years to break the disease cycle.
3.  **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest to reduce inoculum for the next season.
4.  **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to improve air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce humidity and fungal growth.
5.  **Balanced Nutrition:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush, susceptible growth. Provide balanced nutrients based on soil test recommendations.
6.  **Weed Management:** Control weeds in and around the fennel field, as some weeds can act as alternate hosts for rust pathogens.

**II. Chemical Control (Fungicides):**

Fungicides should be applied preventively or at the very early stages of disease appearance for best results. Always ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.

**CIBRC Approved Fungicides for Rust in Fennel (as per general recommendations for rusts in India):**

*   **Propiconazole 25% EC:**
    *   Dosage: 1 ml per litre of water (200 ml per acre in 200 litres of water).
    *   Application: Apply at the first appearance of rust symptoms and repeat after 10-15 days if necessary.
*   **Mancozeb 75% WP:**
    *   Dosage: 2.5 grams per litre of water (500 grams per acre in 200 litres of water).
    *   Application: Can be used as a protective spray before disease onset or at early stages. Repeat at 7-10 day intervals.
*   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP:**
    *   Dosage: 2.5-3 grams per litre of water (500-600 grams per acre in 200 litres of water).
    *   Application: Effective as a protective fungicide, especially in cooler weather. Repeat at 7-10 day intervals.
*   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:**
    *   Dosage: 0.5-1 ml per litre of water (100-200 ml per acre in 200 litres of water).
    *   Application: Apply at the first appearance of rust symptoms and repeat after 10-15 days if necessary.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Always read and follow the label instructions** of the specific product you are using, including dosage, application method, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and safety precautions.
*   **Rotate fungicides with different modes of action** to prevent the development of fungicide resistance.
*   **Monitor your crop regularly** for early signs of disease to initiate timely control measures.
