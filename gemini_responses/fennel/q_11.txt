Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding pest management in Fennel (Saunf). Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies can cause significant damage if not managed effectively. Here is scientifically verified advice for their control, emphasizing an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach.

**General Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Principles for Fennel:**

1.  **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy crop residues and weeds that can harbor pests.
2.  **Crop Rotation:** Avoid continuous cultivation of fennel or other umbelliferous crops in the same field.
3.  **Timely Sowing:** Adhere to recommended sowing times to avoid peak pest periods.
4.  **Balanced Nutrition:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can make plants more attractive to pests.
5.  **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your field for early signs of pest infestation.

### Control of Beetles in Fennel

Various beetles can affect fennel, including flea beetles (damaging young leaves) and blister beetles (feeding on flowers and developing seeds).

**Cultural and Mechanical Control:**

*   **Hand-picking:** For larger beetles like blister beetles, hand-picking and destroying them, especially in the morning or evening, can be effective in small areas.
*   **Clean Cultivation:** Keep the field free of weeds, which can serve as alternate hosts.

**Chemical Control (Apply only when pest incidence crosses economic threshold levels):**

*   For Flea Beetles:
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL at 0.5 ml per liter of water.
*   For Blister Beetles and other chewing beetles:
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 0.5 ml per liter of water.
    *   **Malathion** 50% EC at 2 ml per liter of water.

### Control of Weevils in Fennel

Weevils can damage fennel by feeding on leaves (adults) or boring into stems and roots (larvae).

**Cultural and Mechanical Control:**

*   **Deep Ploughing:** After harvest, deep ploughing can expose pupae and larvae to predators and sunlight, reducing future populations.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove plant debris where weevils might overwinter.

**Chemical Control (Targeting adult weevils):**

*   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 0.5 ml per liter of water.
*   **Quinalphos** 25% EC at 2 ml per liter of water.

### Control of Sawflies in Fennel

Sawfly larvae (e.g., mustard sawfly, *Athalia proxima*) can cause significant defoliation, especially on young fennel plants.

**Cultural and Mechanical Control:**

*   **Hand-picking:** Collect and destroy sawfly larvae, particularly in the early stages of infestation.
*   **Inter-cultivation:** Shallow inter-cultivation can expose pupating larvae in the soil.

**Chemical Control (Apply when larvae are observed feeding):**

*   **Malathion** 50% EC at 2 ml per liter of water.
*   **Quinalphos** 25% EC at 2 ml per liter of water.
*   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 0.5 ml per liter of water.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read the label of the insecticide carefully before use and follow all safety precautions.
*   Ensure proper coverage during spraying.
*   Observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) for any chemical applied to ensure the safety of the produce.
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
