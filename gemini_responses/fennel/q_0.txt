Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding fungal diseases in Fennel (Saunf). Effective management requires a combination of cultural practices and timely application of appropriate fungicides. Here's a scientifically verified approach for Haryana conditions:

**General Management Principles for Fungal Diseases in Fennel:**

*   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting fennel in the same field year after year. Rotate with non-umbelliferous crops for at least 2-3 years.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest to reduce the primary source of inoculum.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available and suitable for Haryana conditions, choose disease-resistant or tolerant fennel varieties.
*   **Optimum Plant Spacing:** Ensure proper plant spacing to allow good air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce humidity and fungal growth.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can promote lush, succulent growth more susceptible to diseases.
*   **Irrigation Management:** Use drip irrigation or furrow irrigation instead of overhead sprinklers to keep foliage dry, especially during evening hours. If overhead irrigation is unavoidable, irrigate in the morning to allow foliage to dry quickly.

Now, let's address the specific diseases you mentioned:

### **1. Alternaria Blight / Leaf Spot (Caused by *Alternaria dauci* and *Alternaria alternata*)**

This is a common and destructive disease in fennel, causing dark brown to black spots with concentric rings (target-like spots) on leaves, stems, and umbels. Severe infection can lead to defoliation, stem girdling, and significant yield loss.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Use certified disease-free seeds.
    *   Practice good field sanitation.
    *   Ensure proper plant spacing.
*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
    *   **Mancozeb:** 2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Chlorothalonil:** 2 g/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin:** 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Propiconazole:** 1 ml/L of water.
    *   *Application:* Apply approximately 200-250 litres of spray solution per acre, depending on crop canopy. Repeat sprays at 10-15 day intervals, alternating fungicides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

### **2. Anthracnose (Caused by *Colletotrichum gloeosporioides*)**

Anthracnose can cause water-soaked lesions that turn brown to black on leaves, stems, and fruits, often leading to dieback of affected plant parts.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Use disease-free seeds.
    *   Remove and destroy infected plant parts promptly.
    *   Improve field drainage to reduce humidity.
*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
    *   **Carbendazim:** 1 g/L of water.
    *   **Mancozeb:** 2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin:** 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   *Application:* Apply approximately 200-250 litres of spray solution per acre.

### **3. Blast**

This is not known to affect Fennel.

### **4. Blight / Brown Spot**

These are general terms often referring to various leaf spot and blight diseases, with Alternaria Blight being the most common in fennel. Other pathogens like *Cercospora* species can also cause leaf spots. The control measures for Alternaria Blight mentioned above are generally effective for most leaf spot and blight conditions in fennel. For *Cercospora* leaf spot, fungicides like **Carbendazim** or **Chlorothalonil** are also effective.

### **5. Downy Mildew (Caused by *Peronospora foeniculi*)**

Symptoms include yellowish-green, angular spots on the upper leaf surface and a characteristic purplish-grey, fuzzy, downy growth on the corresponding lower leaf surface. Severe infection can cause stunting, distortion, and premature defoliation.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Ensure good air circulation within the crop.
    *   Avoid overhead irrigation, especially in the evening.
    *   Remove and destroy infected plant debris.
*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
    *   **Metalaxyl + Mancozeb** (combination product): 2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride:** 2 ml/L of water.
    *   **Dimethomorph:** 1 g/L of water.
    *   **Fenamidone:** 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   *Application:* Apply approximately 200-250 litres of spray solution per acre. Apply preventively or at the first sign of disease, as these are systemic or translaminar and effective against oomycetes.

### **6. Powdery Mildew (Caused by *Erysiphe polygoni* or *Leveillula taurica*)**

Characterized by white, powdery patches on the surface of leaves, stems, and umbels. Infected parts may turn yellow, dry up, and distort, leading to significant reduction in photosynthetic activity and yield.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Maintain good air circulation.
    *   Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization.
*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
    *   **Sulphur** (Wettable powder): 2-3 g/L of water (effective at lower temperatures, avoid spraying in very hot weather, i.e., above 30°C, to prevent phytotoxicity).
    *   **Myclobutanil:** 0.4 ml/L of water.
    *   **Penconazole:** 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Difenoconazole:** 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin:** 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   *Application:* Apply approximately 200-250 litres of spray solution per acre.

### **7. Grey Mildew**

This is not known to affect Fennel.

**Important Considerations for Chemical Application:**

*   Always read the label of the chemical product carefully before use for specific dosage, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action (as indicated by FRAC codes on product labels) to prevent the development of resistance in fungal pathogens.
*   For best results, apply fungicides preventively or at the very early stages of disease development.
*   Ensure thorough coverage of the plant foliage during spraying.
*   Consult your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and the prevailing weather.

Jai Kisan!
