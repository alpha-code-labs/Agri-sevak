As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I will address your concerns regarding "Physical damage" in FingerMillet (Ragi) based on scientifically verified information for Haryana.

1.  **Fruit bursting:**
    This is a phenomenon typically observed in fleshy fruits (e.g., tomato, citrus) due to rapid water uptake or osmotic pressure changes, leading to cracking of the fruit skin. FingerMillet (Ragi) produces grains (caryopses), which are dry, indehiscent fruits, not fleshy fruits.
    **This is not known to affect FingerMillet (Ragi).**

2.  **Hardness in fruit (grains):**
    FingerMillet (Ragi) grains are naturally hard, which is a characteristic feature of the crop and contributes to its nutritional value and storage properties. If "hardness" refers to an abnormal or undesirable increase in grain hardness, it is typically a consequence of environmental stresses (e.g., severe drought during grain filling leading to shrivelled, dense grains) or varietal characteristics, rather than a "physical damage" that can be directly controlled by specific interventions like chemicals. It is more of a quality attribute influenced by genetics and growing conditions.
    **This is not known to affect FingerMillet (Ragi) as a 'damage' requiring specific control measures.**

3.  **Leaf burning/melting:**
    Leaf burning (scorching, desiccation) and severe necrosis (which might be interpreted as "melting" in extreme cases) in FingerMillet (Ragi) are primarily symptoms of abiotic stresses. These are not typically caused by pests or diseases but by environmental factors or improper agricultural practices.

    **Causes and Control Measures:**

    *   **Heat and Drought Stress:**
        *   **Cause:** Prolonged periods of high temperatures combined with insufficient soil moisture.
        *   **Control:**
            *   **Irrigation:** Provide timely and adequate irrigation, especially during critical growth stages like tillering, flowering, and grain filling. Finger millet, while drought-tolerant, benefits significantly from supplemental irrigation during dry spells to mitigate heat and water stress.
            *   **Mulching:** Apply organic mulches (e.g., straw, crop residues) to the soil surface. This helps conserve soil moisture, reduce soil temperature fluctuations, and suppress weeds, thereby reducing plant stress.
            *   **Variety Selection:** Choose heat and drought-tolerant FingerMillet varieties recommended for Haryana's agro-climatic conditions.

    *   **Nutrient Imbalances (Deficiencies/Toxicities):**
        *   **Cause:** Severe deficiencies of certain nutrients (e.g., potassium, zinc) can make plants more susceptible to environmental stresses, leading to leaf scorching. Toxicities can also cause similar symptoms.
        *   **Control:**
            *   **Soil Testing:** Conduct regular soil tests to determine the nutrient status of your field.
            *   **Balanced Fertilization:** Apply fertilizers based on soil test recommendations to ensure balanced nutrition.
            *   **Foliar Application (for identified deficiencies):** If specific micronutrient deficiencies are diagnosed, foliar sprays can provide a quick remedy.
                *   For Zinc deficiency: Apply **Zinc sulphate** at 0.5% (5 g/L of water) as a foliar spray.
                *   For Iron deficiency: Apply **Ferrous sulphate** at 0.5% (5 g/L of water) as a foliar spray.
                *   For Potassium deficiency (if severe and contributing to stress susceptibility): Apply **Potassium nitrate** at 1-2% (10-20 g/L of water) as a foliar spray.

    *   **Chemical Phytotoxicity:**
        *   **Cause:** Incorrect application of agricultural chemicals (e.g., herbicides, insecticides, fungicides) such as wrong dosage, improper mixing, application during adverse weather conditions (high temperature, strong winds), or spray drift.
        *   **Control:**
            *   **Strict Adherence to Label Instructions:** Always follow the manufacturer's recommendations for dosage, application method, and timing for all pesticides and fertilizers.
            *   **Equipment Calibration:** Ensure all spray equipment is accurately calibrated to deliver the correct amount of product.
            *   **Appropriate Weather Conditions:** Avoid spraying during high temperatures, strong winds, or when the crop is under severe stress.
