The symptom of "drying up" (drying branches, leaves, fruits, and flowers) in FingerMillet (Ragi) is a general indication of stress, which can be caused by a variety of factors, both abiotic (environmental) and biotic (pests and diseases). A precise diagnosis is crucial for effective management.

Here are the common causes and their management strategies:

### I. Abiotic Factors (Environmental Stresses)

These are often the primary causes of widespread drying symptoms.

1.  **Drought or Water Stress:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Leaves curl, turn yellow, and eventually dry from the tips downwards. Plants may wilt and eventually die.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Irrigation:** If irrigation facilities are available, provide light and frequent irrigation during critical growth stages (tillering, flowering, grain filling).
        *   **Mulching:** Apply organic mulch (straw, dry leaves) to conserve soil moisture, especially in rainfed areas.
        *   **Improved Soil Organic Matter:** Incorporate farmyard manure (FYM) or compost to enhance soil water retention capacity.
        *   **Drought-Tolerant Varieties:** Choose FingerMillet varieties known for their drought tolerance suitable for Haryana's climate.

2.  **Nutrient Deficiencies:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Specific nutrient deficiencies can lead to yellowing, stunted growth, and eventual drying of leaves. For example, nitrogen deficiency causes general yellowing of older leaves, while potassium deficiency can cause scorching and drying of leaf margins.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Soil Testing:** Conduct regular soil tests to determine nutrient status and apply fertilizers based on recommendations.
        *   **Balanced Fertilization:** Apply recommended doses of Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium. For FingerMillet, a general recommendation might be 40-60 kg N, 20-30 kg P2O5, and 20 kg K2O per acre, adjusted based on soil test results.
        *   **Micronutrients:** If soil tests indicate, apply micronutrients like Zinc or Boron as foliar sprays or soil application.

3.  **Waterlogging:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Yellowing of lower leaves, stunted growth, wilting, and eventual drying of the entire plant due to root damage from lack of oxygen.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Improved Drainage:** Ensure proper field drainage to prevent water accumulation.
        *   **Raised Beds:** Cultivate on raised beds in areas prone to waterlogging.
        *   **Land Leveling:** Proper land leveling helps prevent water stagnation.

### II. Biotic Factors (Pests and Diseases)

These can also cause drying symptoms, often with specific patterns or associated signs.

1.  **Fungal Diseases:**

    *   **a. Root Rots and Wilts (e.g., Charcoal Rot, Fusarium Wilt):**
        *   **Symptoms:** Plants suddenly wilt and dry up, often in patches. Roots may appear discolored, rotted, or show internal browning of the stem base.
        *   **Management:**
            *   **Cultural Practices:**
                *   Crop rotation with non-host crops.
                *   Use resistant or tolerant varieties.
                *   Ensure proper drainage and avoid waterlogging.
                *   Remove and destroy infected plant debris.
            *   **Seed Treatment (Preventive):**
                *   Treat seeds before sowing with a systemic fungicide:
                    *   **Carbendazim** @ 1-2 grams per kg of seed.
                    *   **Thiophanate-methyl** @ 1-2 grams per kg of seed.
                    *   **Thiram** @ 2-3 grams per kg of seed.
            *   **Soil Drench (Curative, if localized):**
                *   For affected plants, drench the soil around the base with:
                    *   **Carbendazim** @ 0.5-1 gram per litre of water.

    *   **b. Blast (Pyricularia grisea / Magnaporthe oryzae pv. eleusinis):**
        *   **Symptoms:** While primarily causing spindle-shaped lesions on leaves, severe neck blast can lead to the drying and breaking of the earhead. Finger blast causes drying of individual fingers.
        *   **Management:**
            *   **Cultural Practices:**
                *   Use resistant varieties.
                *   Maintain optimum plant spacing.
                *   Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can make plants more susceptible.
            *   **Foliar Spray (Curative):**
                *   At the appearance of symptoms or at the neck emergence stage:
                    *   **Tricyclazole** @ 0.6 grams per litre of water.
                    *   **Isoprothiolane** @ 1.5 ml per litre of water.
                    *   **Carbendazim** @ 1 gram per litre of water.
                    *   **Propiconazole** @ 1 ml per litre of water.

2.  **Insect Pests:**

    *   **a. Stem Borers (e.g., Pink Stem Borer - Sesamia inferens, Maize Stem Borer - Chilo partellus):**
        *   **Symptoms:** The central shoot of the plant dries up, forming a "dead heart." This is a classic symptom of stem borer damage.
        *   **Management:**
            *   **Cultural Practices:**
                *   Remove and destroy stubbles after harvest to reduce carry-over pest population.
                *   Early sowing can sometimes help escape peak pest incidence.
                *   Use resistant varieties if available.
            *   **Chemical Control (Granular/Spray):**
                *   At early stages of infestation (2-3 weeks after sowing), apply granules in the leaf whorls:
                    *   **Fipronil 0.3% GR** @ 6-8 kg per acre.
                *   Alternatively, spray with:
                    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC** @ 0.3 ml per litre of water.
                    *   **Fipronil 5% SC** @ 1-1.5 ml per litre of water.

### Important Note:

It is crucial to observe the specific symptoms carefully, including the pattern of drying, presence of lesions, insect damage, or root discoloration, to accurately diagnose the underlying cause. If you are unsure, please bring a sample of the affected plant to the Department of Plant Pathology or Entomology at HAU, Hisar, or your nearest Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) for expert diagnosis and precise recommendations.
