As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for protecting FingerMillet (Ragi) from environmental stresses in Haryana. FingerMillet is generally a hardy and drought-tolerant crop, well-suited to the Kharif season in our region.

### 1. Extreme Cold and Frost:

*   **Relevance to FingerMillet in Haryana:** FingerMillet is primarily a Kharif crop, typically sown in June-July and harvested by October-November. Therefore, mature FingerMillet crops are generally not exposed to the severe cold and frost conditions that occur in Haryana during December-January. However, late-sown crops might experience cooler temperatures during their reproductive phase.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Timely Sowing:** Ensure sowing is done within the recommended window (June-July) to allow the crop to mature before the onset of severe winter cold.
    *   **Irrigation:** If unseasonal cold or mild frost is anticipated for late-sown crops, a light irrigation can help raise the soil temperature and reduce the risk of frost damage.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure balanced nutrition, particularly adequate potassium, which enhances the plant's ability to withstand cold stress.
    *   **Foliar Application:** For late-sown crops facing mild cold stress, a foliar spray can be beneficial:
        *   **Potassium nitrate:** Apply at 10-15 g/L of water. This helps improve cold tolerance and overall plant vigor.

### 2. Heat (Loo) and Intense Sunlight:

*   **Relevance to FingerMillet in Haryana:** FingerMillet is sown during the early monsoon period (June-July), which can sometimes coincide with high temperatures and intense sunlight, especially during the establishment phase or if there are dry spells. High temperatures during flowering can lead to pollen sterility and reduced grain set.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Timely Sowing:** Sowing at the recommended time helps the crop establish and complete critical growth stages during more favorable temperature regimes.
    *   **Adequate Irrigation:** Maintain optimal soil moisture, especially during critical growth stages like flowering and grain filling. Irrigation helps in evaporative cooling of the plant canopy and maintains turgor.
    *   **Mulching:** Applying organic mulches (e.g., straw, crop residues) can help conserve soil moisture, reduce soil temperature, and suppress weed growth.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure balanced fertilization, particularly adequate potassium, which plays a vital role in osmoregulation and heat tolerance. Micronutrients like Zinc and Manganese are also crucial for antioxidant defense systems.
    *   **Foliar Applications:**
        *   **Kaolin clay:** Apply a 5% solution (50 g/L of water) as a foliar spray. Kaolin acts as a reflective barrier, reducing leaf temperature and protecting against sunburn and heat stress. Repeat application if heavy rain washes it off.
        *   **Potassium nitrate:** Apply at 10-15 g/L of water. This helps in osmoregulation and improves the plant's ability to cope with heat stress.
        *   **Salicylic acid:** Apply at 0.07-0.14 g/L of water (equivalent to 0.5-1.0 mM). Salicylic acid is known to induce systemic acquired tolerance to various abiotic stresses, including heat and drought.
