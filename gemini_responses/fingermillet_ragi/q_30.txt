As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for managing growth issues in FingerMillet (Ragi) in Haryana.

**General Recommendation:**
Before applying any specific treatments, it is highly recommended to conduct a soil test to determine the exact nutrient status and pH of your field. This will provide the most accurate basis for nutrient management.

**1. Slow Growth in FingerMillet (Ragi)**

Slow growth can be attributed to various factors including nutrient deficiencies, water stress, weed competition, or soil health issues.

*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Nitrogen (N) Deficiency:** Apply **Urea** (46% N) as per soil test recommendations. A common practice is to apply N in splits: half at sowing and half at 25-30 days after sowing (DAS).
    *   **Phosphorus (P) Deficiency:** Apply **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5) or **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5) at sowing, based on soil test.
    *   **Potassium (K) Deficiency:** Apply **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** (60% K2O) at sowing, if soil test indicates deficiency.
    *   **Zinc (Zn) Deficiency:** If soil test indicates low zinc, apply **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** at 25 kg/acre as basal application, or a foliar spray of 0.2-0.5% solution of **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (2-5 g/L water) at 20-30 DAS.
    *   **Iron (Fe) Deficiency:** In alkaline soils, iron deficiency can occur. Apply a foliar spray of 0.5-1.0% solution of **Ferrous sulphate** (5-10 g/L water) mixed with 0.1% citric acid (1 g/L water) at 15-20 day intervals until recovery.
*   **Water Management:** Ensure adequate and timely irrigation, especially during critical growth stages. Avoid both water stress and waterlogging.
*   **Weed Control:** Weeds compete for nutrients, water, and light, severely impacting growth. Implement timely manual weeding or use appropriate herbicides.
*   **Soil Health:** Incorporate well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost (5-10 tonnes/acre) to improve soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability.

**2. Yellow Growth (Chlorosis) in FingerMillet (Ragi)**

Yellowing is often a symptom of nutrient deficiency, particularly Nitrogen, Iron, or Zinc, or sometimes waterlogging.

*   **Nitrogen (N) Deficiency:**
    *   Apply **Urea** (46% N) as a top dressing. For quick recovery, a foliar spray of 2% **Urea** solution (20 g/L water) can be applied.
*   **Iron (Fe) Deficiency:**
    *   Common in alkaline soils. Apply a foliar spray of 0.5-1.0% solution of **Ferrous sulphate** (5-10 g/L water) mixed with 0.1% citric acid (1 g/L water). Repeat at 10-15 day intervals if necessary.
*   **Zinc (Zn) Deficiency:**
    *   Apply a foliar spray of 0.2-0.5% solution of **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (2-5 g/L water). For soil application, **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** at 25 kg/acre can be applied basally.
*   **Sulphur (S) Deficiency:**
    *   If identified by soil test, apply **Gypsum** (200-250 kg/acre) or **Elemental sulphur** (20-40 kg/acre) at sowing.
*   **Waterlogging:** Ensure proper field drainage to prevent waterlogging, which can damage roots and impair nutrient uptake.

**3. Excessive Height in FingerMillet (Ragi)**

Excessive height, especially when accompanied by weak stems, can lead to lodging (falling over), which significantly reduces yield.

*   **Nitrogen Management:** Avoid excessive application of Nitrogen fertilizers, as this can promote lush vegetative growth and increased height, making plants more prone to lodging. Follow soil test recommendations strictly.
*   **Planting Density:** Maintain optimal plant spacing as per recommended practices for your chosen variety. Overcrowding can lead to etiolation (stretching for light) and taller, weaker plants.
*   **Variety Selection:** If lodging is a recurring issue, consider selecting semi-dwarf or lodging-resistant FingerMillet varieties suitable for Haryana, if available.
*   *Note: The use of Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs) for height control in FingerMillet is not a standard or widely recommended practice in Haryana and is generally not necessary with proper nutrient and cultural management.*

**4. Excessive Flowering in FingerMillet (Ragi)**

"Excessive flowering" is generally not considered a problem in FingerMillet, as flowering leads to grain formation. However, if it implies premature flowering or flowering at the expense of adequate vegetative growth, it could be a symptom of stress.

*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure a balanced supply of all essential nutrients (N, P, K, and micronutrients) based on soil test recommendations. Imbalances can sometimes affect growth stages.
*   **Water Management:** Ensure consistent and adequate water supply, especially during critical growth stages. Drought stress can sometimes induce premature flowering in some crops as a survival mechanism, leading to reduced grain fill.
*   **Pest and Disease Management:** Ensure the crop is free from significant pest and disease pressure, as severe stress from these can sometimes alter growth patterns.
*   *Note: If the crop is otherwise healthy and yielding well, abundant flowering is a positive indicator. If you observe poor grain filling despite abundant flowering, it might indicate resource limitations (nutrients, water) during the grain development stage, which should be addressed through proper management.*
