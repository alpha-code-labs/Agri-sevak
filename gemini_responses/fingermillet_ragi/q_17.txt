As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following doses of organic manures and bio-stimulants for FingerMillet (Ragi) to enhance soil health, nutrient availability, and crop productivity:

**1. Farm Yard Manure (FYM):**
*   **Recommended Dose:** 10-15 tonnes per acre.
*   **Application:** Apply 2-3 weeks before sowing and thoroughly incorporate into the soil during land preparation. Well-decomposed FYM is crucial to avoid nutrient immobilization.

**2. Vermicompost:**
*   **Recommended Dose:** 2-4 tonnes per acre.
*   **Application:** Apply at the time of land preparation, similar to FYM, and incorporate into the soil. It can also be used as a top dressing in smaller quantities if needed.

**3. Sagarika (Seaweed Extract-based Bio-stimulant):**
Sagarika is a seaweed extract-based bio-stimulant, not an organic manure in the traditional sense, but it significantly enhances nutrient uptake and plant growth.

*   **Granular Form (Soil Application):**
    *   **Recommended Dose:** 8-10 kg per acre.
    *   **Application:** Apply at the time of sowing or transplanting, mixed with fertilizers or broadcasted evenly and incorporated into the soil.
*   **Liquid Form (Foliar Spray):**
    *   **Recommended Dose:** 250-500 ml per acre, diluted in 150-200 litres of water.
    *   **Application:**
        *   First spray: 20-25 days after sowing/transplanting.
        *   Second spray: At flowering stage.

**Important Considerations:**
*   The exact doses may vary slightly based on soil test reports, previous crop history, and specific agro-climatic conditions of your field.
*   Always ensure the organic manures are well-decomposed to prevent pest issues and nutrient imbalances.
*   Integration of organic manures with balanced chemical fertilizers (as per soil test recommendations) provides the best results for FingerMillet.
