As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Wilt (including Parawilt) in FingerMillet (Ragi) in Haryana.

Wilt in FingerMillet can be caused by various fungal or bacterial pathogens, while Parawilt is often a physiological condition triggered by environmental stress. An integrated approach is crucial for effective management.

### Management of Wilt (Fungal and Bacterial)

**1. Cultural and Agronomic Practices:**

*   **Resistant Varieties:** Utilize resistant or tolerant FingerMillet varieties recommended for cultivation in Haryana. Consult HAU for the latest recommendations.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Implement a 2-3 year crop rotation with non-host crops (e.g., maize, sorghum, or specific legumes not susceptible to the same wilt pathogens) to reduce soil-borne inoculum.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Promptly remove and destroy infected plant debris and weeds, which can harbor pathogens.
*   **Soil Health and Drainage:** Improve soil structure and drainage to prevent waterlogging, which favors many fungal wilt pathogens. Avoid excessive soil compaction.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure balanced fertilization to promote vigorous plant growth and enhance natural resistance.
*   **Deep Ploughing and Soil Solarization:** During the summer fallow period, deep ploughing followed by soil solarization (covering moist soil with transparent polythene sheets for 4-6 weeks) can significantly reduce soil-borne pathogen populations.

**2. Seed Treatment (for fungal wilts):**

*   Treat FingerMillet seeds before sowing with:
    *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 1-2 g/kg of seed.
    *   Or **Thiram** 75% WS at 2-3 g/kg of seed.
    *   Alternatively, use bio-control agents like *Trichoderma viride* or *Pseudomonas fluorescens* at 10 g/kg of seed.

**3. Soil Application/Drenching (for severe cases):**

*   For established plants showing early symptoms of fungal wilt, drench the soil around the base of the plants with:
    *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 1-2 g/L of water (apply 200-250 ml solution per plant).
    *   For bacterial wilt, if confirmed, **Copper Oxychloride** 50% WP at 2-3 g/L of water can be used as a soil drench.
    *   Bio-control agents like *Trichoderma viride* or *Pseudomonas fluorescens* can also be applied to the soil at 2.5 kg/acre mixed with 50 kg of well-decomposed farmyard manure.

### Management of Parawilt

Parawilt is primarily a physiological condition, often not caused by a pathogen, but rather by sudden environmental stress, particularly related to water availability or root damage.

*   **Optimal Water Management:**
    *   Ensure consistent and adequate soil moisture levels. Avoid both severe water stress (drought) and prolonged waterlogging.
    *   Irrigate judiciously, especially during critical growth stages, based on soil moisture status and weather conditions. Avoid sudden changes in soil moisture.
*   **Soil Management:**
    *   Improve soil structure and drainage to prevent compaction and waterlogging, which can hinder root development and nutrient uptake.
    *   Avoid root damage during intercultural operations (e.g., weeding, hoeing) as damaged roots are more susceptible to stress.
*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Address any micronutrient deficiencies, as these can predispose plants to stress. Foliar application of a balanced micronutrient mixture may be beneficial if deficiencies are identified through soil testing.
