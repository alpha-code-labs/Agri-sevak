As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling weeds in FingerMillet (Ragi) in Haryana:

Effective weed management in FingerMillet (Ragi) involves a combination of cultural practices and judicious use of herbicides. Early weed competition can significantly reduce yield, so timely intervention is crucial.

**General Weed Management Strategy:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Land Preparation:** Thorough land preparation helps in reducing initial weed load.
    *   **Clean Seed:** Use certified, weed-free FingerMillet seeds to prevent introduction of new weed species.
    *   **Hand Weeding/Intercultivation:** This is highly effective, especially during the critical period of weed competition (15-45 days after sowing).
        *   Perform 1-2 hand weedings or intercultivations at 15-20 days after sowing (DAS) and again at 30-35 DAS.
    *   **Proper Spacing:** Maintain optimal plant spacing to allow for better crop growth and competition against weeds.

2.  **Chemical Control (Herbicides):**

    **A. For Broadleaf Weeds (including Bathu and Congress grass) and Narrowleaf Weeds (Grasses):**

    **i. Pre-emergence Herbicides (Apply within 0-3 days after sowing):**
    These herbicides are applied to the soil surface after sowing but before the emergence of the crop and weeds. Ensure adequate soil moisture for optimal efficacy.

    *   **Pendimethalin** 30% EC: Apply at 1.0 kg a.i./acre (approximately 3.3 litres of product per acre) in 200-300 litres of water.
    *   **Pendimethalin** 38.7% CS: Apply at 0.75 kg a.i./acre (approximately 1.9 litres of product per acre) in 200-300 litres of water.
    *   **Oxyfluorfen** 23.5% EC: Apply at 0.15-0.2 kg a.i./acre (approximately 600-850 ml of product per acre) in 200-300 litres of water.

    **ii. Post-emergence Herbicides (Apply 15-25 days after sowing, when weeds are at 2-4 leaf stage):**
    These herbicides are applied after the emergence of both the crop and weeds.

    *   **For Broadleaf Weeds (e.g., Bathu, Congress grass):**
        *   **2,4-D ethyl ester** 38% EC: Apply at 0.5 kg a.i./acre (approximately 1.3 litres of product per acre) in 200-300 litres of water.
        *   **2,4-D sodium salt** 80% WP: Apply at 0.5 kg a.i./acre (approximately 625 grams of product per acre) in 200-300 litres of water.

    *   **For Narrowleaf Weeds (Grasses):**
        *   **Fenoxaprop-P-ethyl** 9% EC: Apply at 0.05 kg a.i./acre (approximately 550 ml of product per acre) in 200-300 litres of water.
        *   **Quizalofop-P-ethyl** 5% EC: Apply at 0.0375-0.05 kg a.i./acre (approximately 750-1000 ml of product per acre) in 200-300 litres of water.
        *   **Propaquizafop** 10% EC: Apply at 0.05-0.075 kg a.i./acre (approximately 500-750 ml of product per acre) in 200-300 litres of water.

    **B. Specific Weed Conditions:**

    *   **Amarbail (Cuscuta spp.):**
        This is not a common or major weed problem in FingerMillet (Ragi) in Haryana. However, if observed, the most effective control measures are:
        *   **Prevention:** Use clean, certified seeds free from Amarbail seeds.
        *   **Manual Removal:** Hand-pull and destroy Amarbail patches immediately upon detection before they spread.
        *   **Pre-emergence Herbicides:** **Pendimethalin** applied pre-emergence can offer some suppression of Amarbail germination.

    *   **Orobanche (Broomrape):**
        This is not known to affect FingerMillet (Ragi). Orobanche species are parasitic weeds that primarily affect dicotyledonous crops (e.g., mustard, tobacco, tomato, brinjal), whereas FingerMillet is a monocot.

    *   **Phalaris minor (Little seed canary grass):**
        This is not known to affect FingerMillet (Ragi). *Phalaris minor* is predominantly a weed of winter cereal crops like wheat, not a kharif crop like FingerMillet.

**Important Considerations for Herbicide Application:**

*   **Water Volume:** Always use the recommended water volume (200-300 litres per acre) for uniform spray coverage.
*   **Nozzle Type:** Use a flat fan nozzle for herbicide application to ensure even distribution.
*   **Weather Conditions:** Apply herbicides on a calm day, avoiding windy conditions to prevent drift. Ensure no rain is expected for at least 4-6 hours after application.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals. Read and follow the instructions on the product label carefully.
*   **Rotation:** Rotate herbicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of herbicide resistance in weeds.
