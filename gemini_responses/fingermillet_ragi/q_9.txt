Mites, including Red Spider Mite (Tetranychus urticae) and Rust Mites (Eriophyidae family), are indeed known to affect FingerMillet (Ragi), especially under dry and warm conditions. They can cause significant damage by sucking sap from leaves, leading to yellowing, bronzing, and reduced photosynthetic activity, ultimately impacting yield.

As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend an integrated approach for effective mite management in FingerMillet:

**1. Monitoring and Early Detection:**
*   Regularly inspect the underside of leaves, especially during dry spells. Look for tiny moving specks (mites), webbing (red spider mites), or bronzing/rusting of leaves (rust mites).
*   Use a hand lens for better observation.

**2. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Proper Irrigation:** Ensure adequate soil moisture, as water stress can exacerbate mite infestations. Overhead irrigation can sometimes help dislodge mites.
*   **Weed Management:** Control weeds in and around the field, as many weeds can serve as alternate hosts for mites.
*   **Crop Residue Management:** Remove and destroy crop residues after harvest to reduce overwintering mite populations.

**3. Chemical Control (Acaricides):**
If mite populations are high and causing economic damage, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development. Ensure thorough coverage, especially on the underside of leaves.

Here are some CIBRC approved technical chemical options for mite control in FingerMillet:

*   **Propargite 57% EC:**
    *   Dosage: 1.5 - 2.0 ml per litre of water (or 500 - 750 ml per acre).
*   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:**
    *   Dosage: 0.5 - 0.75 ml per litre of water (or 200 - 300 ml per acre).
*   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP:**
    *   Dosage: 2.0 - 3.0 g per litre of water (or 800 - 1200 g per acre). (Effective against early stages and also has fungicidal properties).
*   **Fenpyroximate 5% SC:**
    *   Dosage: 0.5 - 1.0 ml per litre of water (or 200 - 400 ml per acre).

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Spray Volume:** Use sufficient water volume (typically 200-400 litres per acre, depending on crop canopy) to ensure complete coverage of the foliage, especially the undersides of leaves where mites reside.
*   **Timing:** Apply acaricides when mite populations are building up, before they cause severe damage. Repeat application may be necessary after 10-15 days if infestation persists.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying. Follow the instructions and safety precautions mentioned on the product label.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Observe the specified pre-harvest interval for each chemical to ensure the safety of the harvested produce.
*   **Consult Local Experts:** For specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and current pest pressure, it is always advisable to consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts.
