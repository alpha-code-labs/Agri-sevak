As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling smut diseases in FingerMillet (Ragi) in Haryana.

It is important to note that among the smut diseases mentioned, **Black Smut (Head Smut)** caused by *Sphacelotheca ragi* (or *Urocystis ragi*) and **Loose Smut** caused by *Ustilago ragi* are the primary smut diseases known to affect FingerMillet (Ragi).

**Control Measures for Black Smut (Head Smut) and Loose Smut in FingerMillet (Ragi):**

These smut diseases are primarily seed-borne or soil-borne, making seed treatment and cultural practices the most effective control strategies.

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Use Resistant Varieties:** Whenever available and suitable for the agro-climatic conditions of Haryana, select and plant FingerMillet varieties known for their resistance to smut diseases.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops to reduce the build-up of soil-borne inoculum.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris and volunteer FingerMillet plants from the field to prevent the carry-over of spores.
*   **Timely Sowing:** Adhere to recommended sowing times to ensure vigorous plant growth, which can sometimes help plants better withstand disease pressure.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced fertilization to promote healthy plant growth, avoiding excessive nitrogen which can sometimes make plants more susceptible.

**2. Chemical Control (Seed Treatment):**
Seed treatment is highly effective in controlling seed-borne smut pathogens. Treat seeds before sowing with CIBRC-approved fungicides.

*   **For Black Smut and Loose Smut:**
    *   **Carboxin 37.5% + Thiram 37.5% DS:** Apply at a rate of 2-2.5 g per kg of seed.
    *   **Carboxin 75% WP/DS:** Apply at a rate of 1.25 g per kg of seed.
    *   **Thiram 75% WS/DS:** Apply at a rate of 2-2.5 g per kg of seed.
    *   **Tebuconazole 2% DS:** Apply at a rate of 1-1.5 g per kg of seed.
    *   **Difenoconazole 3% FS:** Apply at a rate of 1-2 ml per kg of seed.

**Regarding other smut diseases mentioned:**

*   **False Smut:** This is not known to affect FingerMillet (Ragi). It is primarily a disease of rice.
*   **Kernel Smut:** This is not known to affect FingerMillet (Ragi). It is primarily a disease of rice.

Always follow the specific instructions and safety precautions provided on the fungicide label. Consult with your local agricultural extension officer for the most current recommendations and availability of resistant varieties in your specific area of Haryana.
