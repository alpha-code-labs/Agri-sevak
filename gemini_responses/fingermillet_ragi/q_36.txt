As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice to improve the yield, grain quality, and storage life of Finger Millet (Ragi) in Haryana.

### I. Improving Yield of Finger Millet (Ragi)

To maximize the yield of Finger Millet, focus on the following practices:

1.  **Variety Selection:**
    *   Choose high-yielding, disease-resistant, and drought-tolerant varieties specifically recommended for Haryana's agro-climatic conditions. Consult your local agricultural extension office for the latest recommended varieties.

2.  **Soil Health Management:**
    *   Conduct soil testing every 2-3 years to determine nutrient status and pH.
    *   Incorporate 5-10 tonnes/acre of well-decomposed Farmyard Manure (FYM) or compost during land preparation to improve soil structure and fertility.

3.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Nitrogen (N):** Apply 40-60 kg/acre. Apply 50% as basal at the time of sowing and the remaining 50% at 25-30 days after sowing (DAS).
    *   **Phosphorus (P2O5):** Apply 20-30 kg/acre. The full dose should be applied as basal at sowing.
    *   **Potassium (K2O):** Apply 20 kg/acre if soil test indicates deficiency. The full dose should be applied as basal.
    *   **Micronutrients:** If soil test indicates deficiency, apply **Zinc Sulfate** (21%) @ 10 kg/acre as basal, or foliar spray of **Zinc EDTA** (12%) @ 0.5 kg/acre dissolved in 200 L water at the tillering stage.

4.  **Weed Management:**
    *   **Pre-emergence:** Apply **Pendimethalin** (30% EC) @ 1.0-1.25 kg a.i./acre (equivalent to 3.3-4.1 litres of product per acre) within 3 days of sowing.
    *   **Post-emergence:** For broadleaf weeds, apply **2,4-D Ethyl Ester** (38% EC) @ 0.5 kg a.i./acre (equivalent to 1.3 litres of product per acre) at 20-25 DAS. Manual weeding at 15-20 and 30-35 DAS is also highly effective.

5.  **Water Management:**
    *   Although Finger Millet is largely rainfed, supplemental irrigation during critical growth stages (tillering, flowering, and grain filling) can significantly boost yield if rainfall is insufficient.

6.  **Pest and Disease Management:**
    *   Regularly monitor your crop for signs of pests and diseases. Implement timely interventions based on economic threshold levels and integrated pest management (IPM) principles.

### II. Improving Grain Quality of Finger Millet (Ragi)

Grain quality in Finger Millet refers to its physical characteristics, nutritional content, and overall market value.

1.  **Balanced Nutrition:**
    *   Adequate supply of Phosphorus and Potassium, along with essential micronutrients like Zinc, is crucial for proper grain filling, nutrient density, and overall grain quality. Follow the nutrient management recommendations above.

2.  **Timely Harvest:**
    *   Harvest the crop when grains are physiologically mature (hard and firm, typically with a moisture content of 20-25%), usually 25-30 days after 50% flowering. This prevents shattering losses and ensures optimal grain development and nutrient accumulation.

3.  **Proper Drying:**
    *   Immediately after harvest, dry the grains to a safe moisture level of 12-14% to prevent the growth of molds and fungi, which can degrade grain quality and produce toxins.

4.  **Cleaning:**
    *   Thoroughly clean the harvested grain to remove chaff, dust, stones, immature grains, and other foreign matter. This improves the aesthetic appeal and market value of the grain.

### III. Improving Storage Life of Finger Millet (Ragi)

Effective storage practices are vital to minimize post-harvest losses and maintain grain quality over time.

1.  **Thorough Drying:**
    *   This is the most critical step for long-term storage. Dry grains to a moisture content of 10-12%. Higher moisture content promotes mold growth, insect infestation, and rapid spoilage.

2.  **Cleaning and Grading:**
    *   Before storage, remove all impurities, broken grains, and immature grains. Clean grain stores better and is less susceptible to pest attacks.

3.  **Sanitation of Storage Structures:**
    *   Clean storage bins, godowns, or containers thoroughly, removing all old grain residues, dust, and debris.
    *   Repair any cracks or crevices to prevent pest entry.
    *   Spray empty godowns/bins with **Malathion** (50% EC) @ 10 ml/L of water, 2-3 weeks before storing grain, ensuring proper ventilation before loading.

4.  **Airtight Storage:**
    *   Store grains in clean, dry, airtight, rodent-proof, and insect-proof structures. Examples include improved traditional bins, metal bins, or hermetic bags, which restrict oxygen and inhibit pest activity.

5.  **Pest Control in Storage (for large-scale storage):**
    *   For large quantities of grain stored in airtight conditions, fumigation with **Aluminium Phosphide** tablets (3g each) @ 1-2 tablets per tonne of grain for 7 days can be carried out. This procedure should only be performed by trained personnel under strict supervision due to the hazardous nature of the chemical.

6.  **Regular Inspection:**
    *   Periodically inspect stored grain for any signs of insect infestation, mold growth, or moisture accumulation. Aerate the grain if necessary to prevent hot spots and moisture build-up.
