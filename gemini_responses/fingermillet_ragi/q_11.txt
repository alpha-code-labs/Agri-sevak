As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), here is the scientifically verified advice for controlling Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies in FingerMillet (Ragi) in Haryana:

Firstly, regarding Sawflies:
*   This is not known to affect FingerMillet (Ragi).

Now, for Beetles and Weevils, it is important to distinguish between field pests and storage pests, as control measures differ significantly.

**1. Field Pests (Beetles - specifically White Grubs):**
White grubs, the larval stage of certain beetles, are soil-dwelling pests that feed on the roots of FingerMillet, leading to wilting and plant death. Weevils are generally not considered major field pests of FingerMillet in Haryana.

*   **Preventive Measures:**
    *   Deep ploughing during summer to expose grubs to predators and sun.
    *   Collection and destruction of adult beetles during their emergence (monsoon onset).

*   **Chemical Control (at sowing/planting):**
    *   **Seed Treatment:**
        *   **Imidacloprid 70% WS**: 5-7 grams per kg of seed.
    *   **Soil Application (for severe infestations):**
        *   **Fipronil 0.3% GR**: 8-10 kg per acre, applied at the time of sowing and incorporated into the soil.
        *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC**: 4 litres per acre, mixed with 20-30 kg of sand and broadcast evenly before sowing or as a drenching application around the root zone.

**2. Storage Pests (Beetles and Weevils):**
Several species of beetles (e.g., Lesser grain borer, Red flour beetle) and weevils (e.g., Rice weevil) are major pests of stored FingerMillet grains, causing significant quantitative and qualitative losses.

*   **Preventive Measures:**
    *   Ensure grains are thoroughly dried to less than 10% moisture content before storage.
    *   Clean and disinfest storage structures (godowns, bins) before storing new grain. Repair cracks and crevices.
    *   Store grains in airtight containers or bags.
    *   Regular inspection of stored grain for early detection of infestation.

*   **Chemical Control (for stored grain and storage structures):**
    *   **For Admixture with Grain (for protection against infestation):**
        *   **Malathion 5% Dust**: 250 grams per 100 kg of grain. Mix thoroughly and evenly with the grain.
        *   **Deltamethrin 0.25% Dust**: 100 grams per 100 kg of grain. Mix thoroughly.
    *   **For Surface Treatment/Spraying of Storage Structures:**
        *   **Deltamethrin 2.5% WP**: 100 grams dissolved in 5 litres of water to spray 100 square meters of godown walls, floor, and bags.
        *   **Malathion 50% EC**: 10 ml per litre of water, sprayed on the inner and outer surfaces of godowns and bags.

**Important Note:** Always read and follow the instructions and safety precautions on the pesticide label before use. Consult with local agricultural extension officers for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions.
