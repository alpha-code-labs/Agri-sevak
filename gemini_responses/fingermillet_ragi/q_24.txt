As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for the ideal transplantation time, distance, and process for Finger Millet (Ragi) in Haryana:

### Ideal Transplantation Time for Finger Millet (Ragi)

*   **Nursery Sowing:** The ideal time for sowing seeds in the nursery is with the onset of the monsoon, typically from **late June to mid-July**.
*   **Field Transplanting:** Seedlings are ready for transplanting into the main field when they are **3-4 weeks old** (or have 3-4 leaves and are about 15-20 cm tall). This usually falls between **late July and mid-August**, coinciding with sufficient monsoon rains for better establishment.

### Ideal Transplantation Distance for Finger Millet (Ragi)

Maintaining optimal spacing is crucial for proper plant growth, light interception, and nutrient utilization, leading to higher yields.

*   **Row-to-Row Distance:** **22.5 cm to 30 cm**
*   **Plant-to-Plant Distance:** **10 cm to 15 cm**

A common and effective spacing recommendation is **22.5 cm x 10 cm** or **30 cm x 10 cm**.

### Ideal Transplantation Process for Finger Millet (Ragi)

The transplantation process involves several key steps, from nursery preparation to field planting:

1.  **Nursery Preparation:**
    *   **Location:** Select a well-drained, fertile plot near a water source.
    *   **Bed Preparation:** Prepare raised beds of convenient size (e.g., 1 m wide, 3-5 m long, 10-15 cm high).
    *   **Soil Enrichment:** Incorporate well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost at 10-15 kg per square meter into the nursery soil.
    *   **Seed Rate:** Use a seed rate of **2.5 kg to 3 kg per acre** of the main field, which translates to sowing in about 250-300 square meters of nursery area.
    *   **Sowing:** Sow seeds thinly in lines 10 cm apart or broadcast uniformly. Cover with a thin layer of soil and gently pat.
    *   **Watering:** Irrigate immediately after sowing and maintain adequate moisture until seedlings are ready for transplanting.

2.  **Main Field Preparation:**
    *   **Ploughing:** Plough the field thoroughly to a fine tilth.
    *   **Levelling:** Level the field to ensure uniform water distribution.
    *   **Basal Fertilization:** Incorporate recommended basal doses of fertilizers (e.g., DAP, MOP) as per soil test recommendations during the final ploughing.
    *   **Marking:** Mark lines at the desired row-to-row spacing (22.5 cm to 30 cm) using a marker or rope.

3.  **Seedling Uprooting:**
    *   Water the nursery beds thoroughly a few hours before uprooting to ease the process and minimize root damage.
    *   Carefully uproot 3-4-week-old seedlings, ensuring minimal damage to the root system.

4.  **Transplanting:**
    *   **Timing:** Transplant seedlings preferably on a cloudy day or in the late afternoon to reduce transplanting shock.
    *   **Planting:** Plant 1-2 seedlings per hill at the marked plant-to-plant distance (10 cm to 15 cm). Ensure the seedlings are planted at the same depth as they were in the nursery.
    *   **Watering:** Irrigate the field immediately after transplanting to help the seedlings establish quickly.

5.  **Gap Filling:**
    *   Inspect the field 5-7 days after transplanting. If any seedlings have failed to establish, replace them with healthy seedlings from the nursery to maintain optimal plant stand.
