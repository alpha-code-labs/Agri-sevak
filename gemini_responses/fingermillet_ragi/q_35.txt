As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the maturity signs, harvesting time, and cutting process for Finger Millet (Ragi) in Haryana:

### Maturity Signs for Finger Millet (Ragi)

The maturity of Finger Millet is indicated by several visual cues:

*   **Colour Change:** The ear heads (panicles) change colour from green to a yellowish-brown or dark brown, depending on the variety.
*   **Grain Hardness:** The grains become hard and firm. When pressed with a thumbnail, they should not dent easily.
*   **Moisture Content:** The moisture content of the grains significantly reduces.
*   **Leaf Senescence:** The leaves and stalks may start to dry and turn yellow, though this can vary with variety and environmental conditions.
*   **Uneven Maturity:** It is crucial to note that Finger Millet typically exhibits uneven maturity, with the central ear head maturing first, followed by the side tillers. This necessitates careful observation and often leads to staggered harvesting.

### Harvesting Time for Finger Millet (Ragi)

*   **Duration:** Finger Millet is generally ready for harvest between 100 to 130 days after sowing, depending on the specific variety (early, medium, or late duration) and prevailing agro-climatic conditions.
*   **Optimal Stage:** Harvesting should commence when about 80-90% of the grains in the ear heads have matured and hardened.
*   **Staggered Harvesting:** Due to the uneven maturity of ear heads on the same plant, harvesting is often done in 2 to 3 stages (pickings) at intervals of 7-10 days. The first picking targets the fully mature main ear heads, and subsequent pickings collect the later-maturing tillers. This practice ensures maximum yield and quality.

### Cutting Process for Finger Millet (Ragi)

The cutting process can be done manually or, less commonly, mechanically:

*   **Manual Harvesting:**
    *   **Ear Head Cutting:** This is the most common method, especially for staggered harvesting. Only the mature ear heads are cut using a sickle, leaving the straw standing in the field. This allows the immature ear heads to continue ripening.
    *   **Whole Plant Cutting:** If the maturity is relatively uniform across the field, or if the straw is also desired for fodder, the entire plant can be cut close to the ground using a sickle.
*   **Mechanical Harvesting:**
    *   **Reapers/Combines:** In larger fields with uniform maturity, reapers can be used to cut the entire plant. Combine harvesters can also be employed, but their use is less common for Finger Millet due to its uneven maturity and the potential for significant grain loss if not all ear heads are uniformly ripe.
*   **Post-Cutting:**
    *   After cutting, the harvested ear heads (or whole plants) are typically bundled and left to dry in the sun for 2-3 days to further reduce moisture content before threshing. This drying process is crucial for preventing mould growth and ensuring proper storage.
