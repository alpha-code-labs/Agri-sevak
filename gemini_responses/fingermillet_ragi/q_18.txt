As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the use of growth regulators/hormones in FingerMillet (Ragi) for Haryana:

*   **Ethephon (Ethrel):**
    There are no standard recommendations for the use of **Ethephon** as a growth regulator/hormone in FingerMillet (Ragi) in Haryana. Its primary agricultural uses are generally for fruit ripening, flowering induction in specific crops, or latex stimulation, which are not applicable to FingerMillet in this context.

*   **2,4-D:**
    There are no standard recommendations for the use of **2,4-D** as a growth regulator/hormone in FingerMillet (Ragi) in Haryana. While 2,4-D is a synthetic auxin, its primary agricultural application is as a selective herbicide for broadleaf weed control. FingerMillet is generally sensitive to 2,4-D, and its application can cause crop injury.

*   **Boron:**
    Boron is an essential micronutrient crucial for various physiological processes, including cell wall formation, sugar transport, pollen germination, and seed development. While not classified as a hormone, its adequate supply is vital for optimal growth and yield.
    Application of Boron is recommended only if soil tests indicate a deficiency. For foliar application in FingerMillet (Ragi) in Boron-deficient soils:
    *   **Sodium tetraborate decahydrate** (Borax): 2 g/L of water (0.2% solution)
    *   **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (Solubor): 1 g/L of water (0.1% solution)
    Apply as a foliar spray at tillering or pre-flowering stage, ensuring thorough coverage. Soil application of Boron (e.g., 1-2 kg **Sodium tetraborate decahydrate** per acre) can also be considered based on severe deficiency indicated by soil tests, applied at the time of sowing.
