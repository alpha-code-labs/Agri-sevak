As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I must provide scientifically verified advice for Haryana.

Regarding the specific rust diseases you mentioned for FingerMillet (Ragi):

*   Black Rust (Stem Rust) is not known to affect FingerMillet (Ragi).
*   Brown Rust (Leaf Rust) is not known to affect FingerMillet (Ragi).
*   Yellow Rust (Stripe Rust) is not known to affect FingerMillet (Ragi).
*   White Rust is not known to affect FingerMillet (Ragi).

However, FingerMillet (Ragi) is susceptible to a rust disease caused by *Puccinia eleusinis*. While this is generally referred to as FingerMillet Rust and not specifically 'Red Rust' in scientific literature, if you are observing reddish-brown pustules on your FingerMillet crop, these are likely symptoms of this disease.

Here are the recommended control measures for FingerMillet Rust (*Puccinia eleusinis*) in Haryana:

**Cultural Practices:**
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Use resistant or tolerant FingerMillet varieties recommended by HAU for Haryana conditions.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops to reduce the build-up of fungal inoculum in the soil.
*   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest to minimize overwintering inoculum.
*   **Spacing:** Maintain optimal plant spacing to ensure good air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce humidity and fungal spread.

**Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
Apply fungicides at the appearance of initial symptoms or as a preventive measure if the disease is historically prevalent in your area and weather conditions are conducive for its development. Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.

*   **Propiconazole** (25% EC): Apply at a rate of 1 ml/L of water (or 500 ml/acre in 500 L of water).
*   **Tebuconazole** (25.9% EC): Apply at a rate of 0.75 ml/L of water (or 375 ml/acre in 500 L of water).
*   **Mancozeb** (75% WP): Apply at a rate of 2.5 g/L of water (or 1.25 kg/acre in 500 L of water).

Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions on the product label. It is advisable to rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of fungicide resistance.
