As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in FingerMillet (Ragi) in Haryana.

**General Cultural Practices for Disease Management:**

Before discussing specific chemical controls, it is crucial to implement good cultural practices as part of an Integrated Disease Management (IDM) strategy:

*   **Resistant Varieties:** Whenever possible, choose FingerMillet varieties known to be resistant or tolerant to common fungal diseases in your region.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid continuous cultivation of FingerMillet or other susceptible cereals in the same field. Rotate with non-host crops to break disease cycles.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest to reduce inoculum for the next season.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure balanced fertilizer application. Excessive nitrogen can sometimes make plants more susceptible to certain fungal diseases.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Maintain optimal plant spacing to ensure good air circulation, which helps reduce humidity and fungal growth.
*   **Weed Control:** Weeds can act as alternate hosts for pathogens and impede air circulation.

**Specific Fungal Diseases and Their Control in FingerMillet (Ragi):**

1.  **Alternaria Leaf Spot/Blight (*Alternaria alternata*)**
    This disease causes small, dark, circular to irregular spots on leaves, which can enlarge and coalesce, leading to blight.
    *   **Seed Treatment:**
        *   Treat seeds with **Carbendazim 50% WP** at 2 g/kg seed.
        *   Alternatively, use **Thiram 75% WS** at 2.5 g/kg seed.
    *   **Foliar Sprays (at first appearance of symptoms, repeat at 10-15 day intervals if necessary):**
        *   **Mancozeb 75% WP**: 400-600 g/acre (or 1.5-2 g/L water).
        *   **Chlorothalonil 75% WP**: 400-500 g/acre (or 1.5 g/L water).
        *   **Propiconazole 25% EC**: 200 ml/acre (or 0.5 ml/L water).
        *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC**: 200 ml/acre (or 0.5 ml/L water).

2.  **Anthracnose (*Colletotrichum graminicola*)**
    Anthracnose causes elongated, water-soaked lesions on leaves, stems, and panicles, which turn dark brown to black with a reddish-purple margin.
    *   **Seed Treatment:**
        *   Treat seeds with **Carbendazim 50% WP** at 2 g/kg seed.
        *   Alternatively, use **Thiram 75% WS** at 2.5 g/kg seed.
    *   **Foliar Sprays (at first appearance of symptoms, repeat at 10-15 day intervals if necessary):**
        *   **Carbendazim 50% WP**: 200-250 g/acre (or 0.5-0.6 g/L water).
        *   **Mancozeb 75% WP**: 400-600 g/acre (or 1.5-2 g/L water).
        *   **Propiconazole 25% EC**: 200 ml/acre (or 0.5 ml/L water).
        *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC**: 200 ml/acre (or 0.5 ml/L water).

3.  **Blast (*Magnaporthe oryzae* pv. *eleusinae*)**
    Blast is one of the most destructive diseases of FingerMillet, affecting leaves, nodes, and panicles. Lesions are typically spindle-shaped with grey centers and dark brown margins.
    *   **Seed Treatment:**
        *   Treat seeds with **Carbendazim 50% WP** at 2 g/kg seed.
    *   **Foliar Sprays (at first appearance of symptoms, especially at tillering and panicle emergence stages, repeat at 10-15 day intervals if necessary):**
        *   **Tricyclazole 75% WP**: 250-300 g/acre (or 0.6-0.75 g/L water).
        *   **Carbendazim 50% WP**: 200-250 g/acre (or 0.5-0.6 g/L water).
        *   **Propiconazole 25% EC**: 200 ml/acre (or 0.5 ml/L water).
        *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC**: 200 ml/acre (or 0.5 ml/L water).
        *   **Isoprothiolane 40% EC**: 400 ml/acre (or 1 ml/L water).

4.  **Blight (General Leaf Blight, e.g., *Bipolaris oryzae*)**
    This refers to various leaf blight symptoms, often overlapping with Alternaria or Brown Spot. Symptoms include irregular, water-soaked lesions that expand and cause large areas of leaf tissue to die.
    *   **Seed Treatment:**
        *   Treat seeds with **Carbendazim 50% WP** at 2 g/kg seed.
        *   Alternatively, use **Thiram 75% WS** at 2.5 g/kg seed.
    *   **Foliar Sprays (at first appearance of symptoms, repeat at 10-15 day intervals if necessary):**
        *   **Mancozeb 75% WP**: 400-600 g/acre (or 1.5-2 g/L water).
        *   **Chlorothalonil 75% WP**: 400-500 g/acre (or 1.5 g/L water).
        *   **Propiconazole 25% EC**: 200 ml/acre (or 0.5 ml/L water).
        *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC**: 200 ml/acre (or 0.5 ml/L water).
        *   **Thiophanate Methyl 70% WP**: 200-300 g/acre (or 0.75 g/L water).

5.  **Brown Spot (*Bipolaris oryzae*)**
    Brown spot causes small, oval to circular, dark brown spots on leaves, which can enlarge and coalesce, leading to premature drying of leaves.
    *   **Seed Treatment:**
        *   Treat seeds with **Carbendazim 50% WP** at 2 g/kg seed.
        *   Alternatively, use **Thiram 75% WS** at 2.5 g/kg seed.
    *   **Foliar Sprays (at first appearance of symptoms, repeat at 10-15 day intervals if necessary):**
        *   **Mancozeb 75% WP**: 400-600 g/acre (or 1.5-2 g/L water).
        *   **Chlorothalonil 75% WP**: 400-500 g/acre (or 1.5 g/L water).
        *   **Propiconazole 25% EC**: 200 ml/acre (or 0.5 ml/L water).
        *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC**: 200 ml/acre (or 0.5 ml/L water).

6.  **Downy Mildew (*Sclerophthora macrospora*)**
    Downy mildew causes systemic infection, leading to stunting, yellowing, and malformation of leaves (often becoming thick and leathery). White downy growth may be visible on the underside of leaves under humid conditions.
    *   **Seed Treatment:**
        *   Treat seeds with **Metalaxyl 35% WS** at 6 g/kg seed.
    *   **Foliar Sprays (at first appearance of symptoms, repeat at 10-15 day intervals if necessary):**
        *   **Metalaxyl 8% + Mancozeb 64% WP**: 500 g/acre (or 2 g/L water).
        *   **Fosetyl-Al 80% WP**: 1 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L water).

7.  **Powdery Mildew**
    This is not known to affect FingerMillet (Ragi).

8.  **Grey Mildew**

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the fungicide label for safe and effective use.
*   Ensure thorough coverage of the plant foliage during spraying.
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in pathogens.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension specialists for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and prevailing disease pressure.
