As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified seed and soil treatment processes for FingerMillet (Ragi) to ensure healthy crop establishment and protection against common pests and diseases in Haryana.

### Seed Treatment Process for FingerMillet (Ragi)

Seed treatment is crucial for protecting germinating seeds and young seedlings from seed-borne and early soil-borne pathogens and insect pests.

1.  **Fungicidal Seed Treatment:**
    *   To protect against seed-borne diseases like blast, smut, and damping-off.
    *   Treat seeds with **Carboxin 37.5% + Thiram 37.5% DS** at 2.5 g per kg of seed.
    *   *Alternatively, you may use:* **Carbendazim 50% WP** at 2 g per kg of seed.

2.  **Insecticidal Seed Treatment:**
    *   To protect against early insect pests such as shoot fly and sucking pests.
    *   Treat seeds with **Imidacloprid 70% WS** at 5 g per kg of seed.

3.  **Bio-fertilizer/Bio-fungicide Seed Treatment (Optional but Recommended):**
    *   These should be applied after the chemical treatments and once the seeds are dry.
    *   For enhanced disease suppression: Treat seeds with *Trichoderma viride* (10^8 CFU/g) at 4 g per kg of seed.
    *   For nitrogen fixation: Treat seeds with *Azotobacter chroococcum* (10^8 CFU/g) at 10 g per kg of seed.
    *   For phosphate solubilization: Treat seeds with *Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria (PSB)* (10^8 CFU/g) at 10 g per kg of seed.

    **Application Sequence:** First apply the fungicide, then the insecticide. Allow the seeds to dry slightly before applying bio-agents. Ensure thorough and uniform coating of the seeds.

### Soil Treatment Process for FingerMillet (Ragi)

Soil treatment aims to manage soil-borne pests and diseases and improve soil health.

1.  **For Soil-borne Insect Pests:**
    *   To manage pests like termites and white grubs, which can damage roots and young plants.
    *   Apply **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** at 2.5 L per acre. Mix the chemical with 50-100 kg of sand or soil and broadcast evenly across the field before the last ploughing, ensuring it is incorporated into the soil.

2.  **For Soil-borne Diseases and Nutrient Mobilization (Bio-agents):**
    *   To suppress soil-borne diseases and enhance nutrient availability.
    *   Mix *Trichoderma viride* (10^8 CFU/g) at 2 kg per acre with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost.
    *   Similarly, mix *Azotobacter chroococcum* (10^8 CFU/g) at 2 kg per acre with FYM/compost.
    *   Also, mix *Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria (PSB)* (10^8 CFU/g) at 2 kg per acre with FYM/compost.
    *   Broadcast this mixture evenly across the field before sowing or transplanting and incorporate it into the soil.

    **Important Note:** Bio-agents should not be mixed directly with chemical fertilizers or pesticides. Maintain a gap of at least 7-10 days if applying them in the same area, or apply them mixed with organic matter as described.

Always follow safety precautions while handling chemicals, including wearing gloves, masks, and protective clothing. Read and adhere to the instructions on the product labels.
