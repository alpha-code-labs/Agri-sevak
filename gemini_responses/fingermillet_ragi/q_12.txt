As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Scale insects and Mealybugs in FingerMillet (Ragi) in Haryana:

**Scale Insects:**
This is not known to affect FingerMillet (Ragi).

**Mealybugs:**
Mealybugs can occasionally infest FingerMillet (Ragi), particularly on the earheads and leaf sheaths, leading to stunted growth and reduced grain filling. Early detection and integrated management are crucial.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Mealybugs:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Regularly remove weeds and volunteer plants from the field and surrounding areas, as they can act as alternate hosts for mealybugs.
    *   **Crop Residue Management:** Properly dispose of or incorporate crop residues after harvest to reduce overwintering sites for pests.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive application of nitrogenous fertilizers, which can lead to lush, succulent growth that is more attractive to sucking pests.
    *   **Proper Spacing:** Maintain optimal plant spacing to ensure good air circulation, which can deter mealybug establishment.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Encourage natural enemies such as ladybird beetles, lacewings, predatory mites, and parasitic wasps, which prey on or parasitize mealybugs. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

3.  **Chemical Control (If infestation is severe and localized):**
    *   For spot infestations, direct sprays can be effective. For widespread infestations, systemic insecticides are often preferred due to the waxy coating of mealybugs.
    *   Ensure thorough coverage, especially on the underside of leaves and within leaf sheaths where mealybugs tend to congregate.
    *   Use CIBRC approved technical chemical names only:
        *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at 500-600 ml per acre in 200-300 litres of water.
        *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at 100 g per acre in 200-300 litres of water.
        *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at 125 ml per acre in 200-300 litres of water.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and the prevailing pest situation.
