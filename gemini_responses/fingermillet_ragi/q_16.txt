As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified fertilizer doses for Finger Millet (Ragi) in Haryana, aiming for optimal yield. It is always advisable to conduct a soil test for precise recommendations tailored to your specific field conditions.

**General Nutrient Targets per acre for Finger Millet (Ragi):**
*   Nitrogen (N): 40-60 kg
*   Phosphorus (P2O5): 20-30 kg
*   Potassium (K2O): 20-30 kg
*   Sulphur (S): 10 kg

**Recommended Fertilizer Application Schedule:**

**1. Basal Application (at the time of sowing):**
*   **Phosphorus:**
    *   Apply 45-65 kg of **DAP (Di-ammonium Phosphate)** per acre. (This provides 8-12 kg N and 20-30 kg P2O5).
    *   *Alternatively, if **DAP** is not used, apply 125-185 kg of **SSP (Single Super Phosphate)** per acre. (This provides 20-30 kg P2O5 and 13.75-20.35 kg S).*
*   **Potassium:**
    *   Apply 35-50 kg of **Potash (Muriate of Potash)** per acre.
*   **Sulphur:**
    *   If **SSP** is not used, or if additional Sulphur is required based on soil test, apply 11 kg of **Sulphur (Bentonite Sulphur 90%)** per acre.
*   **Nitrogen (Partial):**
    *   Apply 20-30 kg of **Urea** per acre. (This is in addition to any Nitrogen supplied by **DAP** to meet approximately half of the total N requirement).

**2. Top Dressing (20-25 days after sowing, or after first weeding):**
*   **Nitrogen (Remaining):**
    *   Apply 45-65 kg of **Urea** per acre. (This provides the remaining half of the total Nitrogen requirement).

**3. Nano Fertilizers (Supplemental/Partial Replacement):**
*   **Nano-Urea:**
    *   Can be used as a foliar spray to supplement or partially replace conventional **Urea**.
    *   Apply 2-4 ml of **Nano-Urea** per litre of water, for 2 sprays at critical growth stages (e.g., tillering and pre-flowering). This can potentially reduce conventional **Urea** application by up to 50% in top dressing.
*   **Nano-DAP:**
    *   Can be used as a foliar spray to supplement or partially replace conventional **DAP**.
    *   Apply 2-4 ml of **Nano-DAP** per litre of water, for 2 sprays at critical growth stages (e.g., early vegetative and pre-flowering). This can potentially reduce conventional **DAP** application by up to 50% in basal application.
    *   *Note: For Nano-DAP, seed treatment is also an option, typically 5 ml/kg seed.*

**4. NPK Fertilizers:**
*   If using complex **NPK** fertilizers (e.g., 12:32:16, 10:26:26), the application rate should be adjusted to meet the target N, P2O5, and K2O requirements. For example, 100-150 kg of **NPK (12:32:16)** per acre can be applied as a basal dose, and then supplement with **Urea** and **Potash** as needed to meet the remaining nutrient targets. It is generally recommended to use single fertilizers for precise nutrient management.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Soil Testing:** Always conduct a soil test to determine the exact nutrient status of your field and get precise recommendations.
*   **Irrigation:** Ensure adequate moisture for efficient nutrient uptake, especially after fertilizer application.
*   **Method of Application:** Fertilizers should be broadcast uniformly or placed in furrows at the time of sowing. Top-dressed **Urea** should be applied when the soil is moist.
