As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling sucking pests in FingerMillet (Ragi) in Haryana.

Firstly, regarding Psylla:
*   This is not known to affect FingerMillet (Ragi). Psylla species are typically pests of specific fruit trees and other woody plants, not millets.

For the control of Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips in FingerMillet (Ragi), an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is recommended, combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Timely Sowing:** Sow FingerMillet at the recommended time to avoid peak pest incidence periods.
    *   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available and suitable for Haryana, choose FingerMillet varieties known to be tolerant or resistant to sucking pests.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Keep the field free of weeds, as many weeds act as alternate hosts for these pests.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush growth that attracts sucking pests.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation to break the pest cycle.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Protect and encourage natural predators like ladybird beetles, lacewings, hoverfly larvae, and parasitic wasps, which feed on aphids, whiteflies, and leafhoppers. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.
    *   **Biopesticides:** Consider using entomopathogenic fungi like *Beauveria bassiana* or *Verticillium lecanii* during early stages of infestation, especially under humid conditions, if available and approved for FingerMillet.

3.  **Mechanical Control:**
    *   **Yellow Sticky Traps:** Install yellow sticky traps (10-15 traps per acre) for monitoring and mass trapping of adult whiteflies and leafhoppers.

**Chemical Control (When necessary):**

If pest populations reach economic threshold levels and other methods are insufficient, judicious application of CIBRC-approved insecticides is recommended. Always ensure thorough spray coverage.

**Recommended Insecticides:**

*   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:**
    *   Dosage: 125-150 ml per acre (mixed in 200-400 litres of water).
    *   Effective against: Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, Thrips.
*   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:**
    *   Dosage: 40-50 g per acre (mixed in 200-400 litres of water).
    *   Effective against: Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, Thrips.
*   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:**
    *   Dosage: 80-100 g per acre (mixed in 200-400 litres of water).
    *   Effective against: Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, Thrips.
*   **Dimethoate 30% EC:**
    *   Dosage: 300-400 ml per acre (mixed in 200-400 litres of water).
    *   Effective against: Aphids, Thrips, Leafhoppers.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Rotation of Chemicals:** To prevent the development of insecticide resistance, rotate insecticides with different modes of action. Do not use the same chemical repeatedly.
*   **Timing of Application:** Apply insecticides when pest populations are low to moderate, and before they cause significant damage. Early morning or late evening sprays are ideal to minimize impact on beneficial insects and reduce drift.
*   **Safety Precautions:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying. Follow label instructions carefully regarding dosage, application, and pre-harvest intervals.
