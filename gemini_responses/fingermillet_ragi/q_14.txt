As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling soil pests in FingerMillet (Ragi) in Haryana.

### Control of Soil Pests (Termite and Nematodes/Root-knot) in FingerMillet (Ragi)

FingerMillet (Ragi) can be affected by soil pests like termites and nematodes, particularly in certain soil types and under specific environmental conditions prevalent in Haryana. Effective management involves both chemical and cultural practices.

#### 1. Termite Control in FingerMillet (Ragi)

Termites (e.g., *Odontotermes obesus*, *Microtermes obesi*) can cause significant damage to FingerMillet, especially during the seedling stage and in dryland conditions, leading to poor stand establishment and reduced yields.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Fipronil 0.3% GR:** Apply 10-15 kg/acre at the time of sowing or transplanting. Mix the granules thoroughly with the soil in the seedbed or transplanting pits.
    *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC:** For pre-plant soil incorporation, apply 2.0-2.5 L/acre mixed with 50-100 kg of dry sand or soil, and broadcast evenly before the final ploughing. Alternatively, for drenching, prepare a solution of 2.5 ml/L water and drench around the plant base immediately after sowing or transplanting.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Ensure proper field sanitation by removing stubble and crop residues that can serve as food sources for termites.
    *   Deep summer ploughing can expose termite colonies to predators and desiccation.

#### 2. Nematode (Root-knot) Control in FingerMillet (Ragi)

Root-knot nematodes (*Meloidogyne* species) can infest FingerMillet roots, leading to the formation of galls, stunted growth, nutrient deficiency symptoms, and reduced yield.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Carbofuran 3% G:** Apply 10-15 kg/acre at the time of sowing or transplanting. Broadcast the granules evenly and incorporate them into the soil.
    *   **Phorate 10% G:** Apply 4 kg/acre at the time of sowing or transplanting. Broadcast the granules evenly and incorporate them into the soil.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate FingerMillet with non-host crops such as marigold, mustard, or specific varieties of cereals that are less susceptible to root-knot nematodes.
    *   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or neem cake (100-200 kg/acre) into the soil. Neem cake has nematicidal properties and improves soil health.
    *   **Summer Ploughing:** Deep ploughing during hot summer months can expose nematode eggs and larvae to direct sunlight, reducing their population.
    *   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available and suitable for Haryana conditions, consider cultivating nematode-resistant FingerMillet varieties.
