As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified information regarding specialized practices in FingerMillet (Ragi) relevant to Haryana conditions:

*   **Pruning:**
    This is not known to affect FingerMillet (Ragi). Finger millet is an annual cereal crop and does not require pruning as it is not a woody plant or a perennial that benefits from such a practice.

*   **Desuckering:**
    This is not known to affect FingerMillet (Ragi) as a specialized practice. Finger millet produces tillers, which are generally desirable for yield formation. Desuckering, as practiced in crops like banana or pineapple to remove unwanted suckers, is not a standard or recommended practice for finger millet.

*   **Mulching:**
    Mulching is a highly beneficial practice for FingerMillet (Ragi), especially for moisture conservation, weed suppression, and soil temperature regulation.
    *   **Benefits:**
        *   **Moisture Conservation:** Reduces evaporation from the soil surface, crucial for rainfed areas.
        *   **Weed Control:** Suppresses weed growth by blocking sunlight, reducing competition for nutrients and water.
        *   **Soil Temperature Regulation:** Keeps soil cooler in hot conditions and warmer in cold conditions.
        *   **Soil Health Improvement:** Organic mulches decompose over time, adding organic matter and improving soil structure.
    *   **Types of Mulch:**
        *   **Organic Mulches:** Crop residues (straw from wheat, rice, or other cereals), dry leaves, farmyard manure.
            *   **Application:** Apply a layer of 5-10 cm thickness after sowing or transplanting. For straw, approximately 4-6 tonnes per acre may be required depending on the material and desired thickness.
        *   **Plastic Mulches:** Black or transparent polyethylene sheets.
            *   **Application:** Lay plastic sheets over the prepared beds before planting. Holes are then made at appropriate spacing for planting the finger millet seedlings. This is more common in high-value crops but can be used for finger millet in specific situations for intensive cultivation.

*   **Grafting:**
    This is not known to affect FingerMillet (Ragi). Grafting is a horticultural technique used for woody plants, fruit trees, or some dicotyledonous vegetables. Finger millet is a monocotyledonous cereal crop, and grafting is not applicable or practiced in such plants.

*   **Pollination:**
    This is not known to affect FingerMillet (Ragi) as a specialized practice requiring human intervention. Finger millet is primarily a **self-pollinated** crop. The flowers are bisexual, and pollination typically occurs within the same flower or between flowers on the same plant. While wind can play a minor role in cross-pollination, no specialized practices like hand pollination are required or performed for finger millet cultivation.
