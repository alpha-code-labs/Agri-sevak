As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in FingerMillet (Ragi) in Haryana:

First, let's address each pest specifically:

**1. Diamondback Moth (*Plutella xylostella*)**
This is not known to affect FingerMillet (Ragi). Diamondback moth is a specific pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower, mustard).

**2. Borers (e.g., Stem Borer, Shoot Borer, Earhead Borer), Caterpillars (e.g., Armyworm, Fall Armyworm, Cutworms), and Leaf Folder**
These pests are primarily lepidopteran (moth larvae) and often share similar control strategies. Key pests in FingerMillet include:
*   **Borers:** Finger Millet Shoot Borer (*Sesamia inferens*), Stem Borer (*Chilo partellus*), Earhead Borer (*Helicoverpa armigera*, *Mythimna separata*).
*   **Caterpillars:** Armyworm (*Mythimna separata*), Fall Armyworm (*Spodoptera frugiperda*), Cutworms (*Agrotis ipsilon*).
*   **Leaf Folder:** Finger Millet Leaf Folder (*Marasmia trapezalis*).

For effective control of these lepidopteran pests, an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is recommended, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Timely sowing to avoid peak pest incidence.
    *   Field sanitation: Remove and destroy crop residues and weeds that can harbor pests.
    *   Deep ploughing after harvest to expose pupae and larvae to predators and sunlight.
*   **Biological Control:**
    *   Conserve natural enemies like parasitic wasps (*Trichogramma* spp.) and predatory insects.
    *   Application of bio-pesticides like **Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)** formulations as per label instructions (e.g., 1 kg/acre).
*   **Mechanical Control:**
    *   Hand-picking and destroying visible larvae in small areas.
    *   Installation of pheromone traps for monitoring and mass trapping of adult moths (e.g., for stem borers, armyworms) at 4-5 traps per acre.
*   **Chemical Control (as a last resort, when pest incidence crosses Economic Threshold Level):**
    When chemical intervention is necessary, use CIBRC approved insecticides. Ensure thorough coverage and follow safety guidelines.

**Recommended CIBRC Approved Insecticides for Borers, Caterpillars, and Leaf Folder in FingerMillet:**

*   **For early stage borers (stem/shoot borer) and cutworms (soil application):**
    *   **Fipronil 0.3% GR:** 6.6 - 10 kg/acre (Apply in whorl or broadcast and lightly incorporate into soil).
*   **For foliar feeding caterpillars (including armyworm, fall armyworm, leaf folder) and later stage borers:**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** 60 ml/acre
    *   **Emamectin Benzoate 5% SG:** 88 g/acre
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** 100 - 120 ml/acre
    *   **Cartap Hydrochloride 50% SP:** 400 g/acre
    *   **Indoxacarb 14.5% SC:** 200 ml/acre
    *   **Quinalphos 25% EC:** 1.2 - 1.6 L/acre

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the insecticide label carefully, including dosage, timing, and pre-harvest interval.
*   Use appropriate spray volume (e.g., 200-400 litres of water per acre for foliar sprays) to ensure good coverage.
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations based on current pest pressure and local conditions in Haryana.
