As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies in Finger Millet (Ragi) in Haryana. It is crucial to conduct a soil test to determine the exact nutrient status of your field for precise recommendations.

**1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency:**
*   **Symptoms:** General yellowing of older leaves, stunted growth, reduced tillering, and overall pale green appearance of the plant.
*   **Management:**
    *   For basal application and top dressing:
        *   **Urea** (46% Nitrogen) at a rate of 87-130 kg per acre. This corresponds to a recommended application of 40-60 kg Nitrogen per acre.
        *   *Application timing:* Apply 1/3rd to 1/2 of the total Nitrogen as basal, and the remaining in 1-2 top dressings, usually 20-30 days after sowing/transplanting and again at the panicle initiation stage.

**2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency:**
*   **Symptoms:** Purplish discoloration of older leaves, stunted growth, poor root development, and delayed maturity.
*   **Management:**
    *   For basal application:
        *   **Single Super Phosphate** (16% P2O5) at a rate of 125-187 kg per acre. This corresponds to a recommended application of 20-30 kg P2O5 per acre.
        *   Alternatively, **Diammonium Phosphate** (18% Nitrogen, 46% P2O5) at a rate of 43-65 kg per acre. If using DAP, adjust the Urea application accordingly to avoid excess Nitrogen.
        *   *Application timing:* Phosphorus fertilizers should be applied entirely as a basal dose and thoroughly incorporated into the soil before sowing or transplanting, as phosphorus is less mobile in the soil.

**3. Potassium (K) Deficiency:**
*   **Symptoms:** Yellowing and scorching of leaf margins (especially older leaves), weak stems, poor grain filling, and increased susceptibility to lodging and diseases.
*   **Management:**
    *   For basal application:
        *   **Muriate of Potash** (Potassium Chloride, 60% K2O) at a rate of 33-50 kg per acre. This corresponds to a recommended application of 20-30 kg K2O per acre.
        *   *Application timing:* Potassium fertilizers are generally applied as a basal dose and incorporated into the soil before sowing or transplanting.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Soil Testing:** Always conduct a soil test before applying fertilizers to get precise recommendations tailored to your specific field conditions and avoid over-application or under-application.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management (INM):** Supplement chemical fertilizers with organic manures like Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost (5-10 tonnes per acre) to improve soil health and nutrient use efficiency.
