As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following cultivation practices for Finger Millet (Ragi) in Haryana:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   **Transplanting:** This method is generally preferred as it ensures better plant establishment, uniform stand, and higher yields, especially under rainfed conditions or where labor is readily available. Seedlings are raised in a nursery for 3-4 weeks before transplanting.
    *   **Line Sowing:** Direct sowing in lines is also a common and recommended practice over broadcasting, as it facilitates inter-cultivation operations and better nutrient utilization.
    *   **Broadcasting:** While possible, it is generally not recommended due to uneven plant stand and difficulty in weed management.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   Finger millet seeds are very small. A shallow planting depth of **2-3 cm** is crucial for good germination and seedling emergence. Deeper planting can lead to poor or delayed emergence.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   **For Transplanting:**
        *   Row-to-row spacing: **20-25 cm**
        *   Plant-to-plant spacing: **10-15 cm**
    *   **For Line Sowing:**
        *   Row-to-row spacing: **20-25 cm**
        *   Plant-to-plant spacing: **8-10 cm** (after thinning, which should be done 2-3 weeks after sowing)

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   **For Nursery (for transplanting 1 acre):** **2 kg/acre**
    *   **For Line Sowing:** **4-5 kg/acre**
    *   **For Broadcasting:** **10-12 kg/acre** (though broadcasting is less preferred)
