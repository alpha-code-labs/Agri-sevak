As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in FingerMillet (Ragi) in Haryana:

1.  **Grasshopper:**
    Grasshoppers are polyphagous pests that can cause significant damage to FingerMillet by feeding on leaves and young shoots.
    **Control Measures:**
    *   **Cultural Practices:** Deep ploughing after harvest can expose grasshopper eggs to predators and adverse weather conditions.
    *   **Chemical Control:** In case of severe infestation, the following CIBRC approved insecticides can be used:
        *   **Malathion 50% EC**: Apply at a rate of 1.0 - 1.25 litres per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water for spraying.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC**: Apply at a rate of 200-250 ml per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water for spraying.

2.  **Painted bug (Bagrada hilaris):**
    This is not known to affect FingerMillet (Ragi). Painted bug is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops like mustard, cabbage, and cauliflower.

3.  **Red cotton bug (Dysdercus cingulatus):**
    This is not known to affect FingerMillet (Ragi). Red cotton bug is primarily a pest of cotton and other malvaceous plants.

4.  **Black ants:**
    This is not known to affect FingerMillet (Ragi) as a direct pest causing significant economic damage to the crop itself. While ants may be present in fields, they are generally not considered a primary pest of FingerMillet plants. Their presence is often associated with other honeydew-producing insects (like aphids or mealybugs), in which case controlling the primary pest would indirectly manage the ant population.
