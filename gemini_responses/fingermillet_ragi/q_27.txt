As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), here is the scientifically verified advice regarding the suitable climate, soil type, and drainage requirements for Finger Millet (Ragi) in Haryana:

**Climate:**
*   **Temperature:** Finger Millet is a warm-season crop.
    *   Optimum temperature for growth: 25-30°C.
    *   It can tolerate temperatures up to 35-38°C.
    *   Minimum temperature for germination: 18-20°C.
*   **Rainfall:** It is primarily grown as a rainfed crop.
    *   Annual rainfall requirement: 500-900 mm.
    *   It is relatively drought-tolerant compared to other cereals but benefits from well-distributed rainfall during its growth period.
*   **Growing Season:** Typically grown as a Kharif (monsoon) crop in Haryana, sown with the onset of monsoon rains.

**Soil Type:**
*   **Texture:** Finger Millet can be grown on a wide range of soils, but it thrives best on:
    *   Well-drained sandy loams.
    *   Loamy soils.
    *   Red, light black, and alluvial soils are also suitable.
*   **pH:**
    *   Optimum pH range: 5.0 to 8.0.
    *   It has a good tolerance to slightly acidic soils.
*   **Fertility:** While it can grow on poor soils, it responds well to moderate fertility and organic matter content.

**Drainage Requirement:**
*   **Drainage:** Good drainage is crucial for Finger Millet.
    *   It is highly sensitive to waterlogging, especially during the early growth stages.
    *   Fields should be well-drained to prevent water stagnation, which can lead to root rot and poor plant stand.
