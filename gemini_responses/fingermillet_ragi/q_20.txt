Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I advise that addressing micronutrient deficiencies in FingerMillet (Ragi) effectively begins with a thorough soil test. This will accurately identify the specific deficiencies and their severity in your field, allowing for targeted and efficient management.

Here's how to address the listed nutrient deficiencies in FingerMillet (Ragi):

### General Recommendations:
*   **Soil Testing:** Always conduct a soil test to confirm the deficiency before applying any nutrient.
*   **Foliar Application:** Often preferred for quick correction of micronutrient deficiencies, especially when symptoms are visible. Apply sprays during cooler parts of the day (morning or late afternoon).
*   **Adjuvants:** Consider adding a non-ionic spreader/sticker to foliar sprays for better absorption.

### Specific Nutrient Deficiencies:

#### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency
*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, often with reddish-brown spots.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application (Preventive/Severe Deficiency):**
        *   Apply 25 kg/acre of **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate (21% Zn)** or 10-12 kg/acre of **Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate (33% Zn)** at the time of sowing or transplanting.
    *   **Foliar Application (Curative):**
        *   Spray a 0.5% solution (5 g/L of water) of **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate (21% Zn)** mixed with 0.25% (2.5 g/L) of unslaked lime to neutralize acidity.
        *   Alternatively, spray a 0.1% solution (1 g/L of water) of **Zinc EDTA (12% Zn)**.
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, starting when symptoms appear.

#### 2. Iron (Fe) Deficiency (Chlorosis)
*   **Symptoms:** Severe interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, which may turn completely yellow or white in severe cases. Common in alkaline and calcareous soils.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application (Most Effective):**
        *   Spray a 0.5-1% solution (5-10 g/L of water) of **Ferrous Sulphate Heptahydrate (19% Fe)**.
        *   Alternatively, spray a 0.1% solution (1 g/L of water) of **Ferrous EDTA (12% Fe)**.
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 7-10 day intervals, starting immediately after symptoms are observed.

#### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency
*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, thickening and brittleness of young leaves, poor pollen viability, and malformed grains.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application (If severe deficiency confirmed):**
        *   Apply 1-2 kg/acre of **Borax (Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate, 10.5% B)** at sowing.
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray a 0.1-0.2% solution (1-2 g/L of water) of **Borax (Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate, 10.5% B)** or **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate (20% B)**.
        *   Apply at tillering or panicle initiation stage.

#### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency
*   **Symptoms:** Affects growing points, leading to distorted new leaves, stunted root growth, and necrosis of young tissues. While Calcium is a secondary macronutrient, its deficiency can impact plant health.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application (If soil test indicates low Ca and/or high acidity):**
        *   Apply **Gypsum (Calcium Sulphate Dihydrate, 23% Ca)** at 200-400 kg/acre, especially beneficial in sodic soils.
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray a 0.5-1% solution (5-10 g/L of water) of **Calcium Nitrate (19% Ca)**. Apply 2-3 sprays as needed.

#### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency
*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves (veins remain green), sometimes with purplish discoloration. Magnesium is also a secondary macronutrient.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   Apply 10-20 kg/acre of **Magnesium Sulphate (Epsom Salt, 9.6% Mg)**.
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray a 0.5-1% solution (5-10 g/L of water) of **Magnesium Sulphate (Epsom Salt, 9.6% Mg)**. Apply 2-3 sprays.

#### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency
*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, often appearing as a "netting" pattern, sometimes with greyish-brown spots or streaks.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   Apply 10-15 kg/acre of **Manganese Sulphate (28-30% Mn)**.
    *   **Foliar Application (More effective for quick correction):**
        *   Spray a 0.2-0.5% solution (2-5 g/L of water) of **Manganese Sulphate (28-30% Mn)**.
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, starting when symptoms appear.

Always consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and soil test results.
