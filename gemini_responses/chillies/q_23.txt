As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified seed and soil treatment processes for Chilli cultivation in Haryana to ensure healthy plant establishment and mitigate early disease and pest challenges.

### Recommended Seed Treatment Process for Chillies

Seed treatment is crucial for protecting seeds and young seedlings from seed-borne and early soil-borne pathogens, as well as providing initial protection against sucking pests.

1.  **Fungicidal Seed Treatment:**
    *   **Purpose:** To protect against seed-borne fungal diseases like anthracnose (Colletotrichum capsici) and early seedling diseases such as damping-off (Pythium spp., Phytophthora spp., Rhizoctonia solani).
    *   **Options:**
        *   **Thiram** 75% WS at 2.5-3 g/kg seed.
        *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 1.5-2 g/kg seed.
        *   A combination product containing **Captan** 75% WS + **Metalaxyl** 35% WS at 3 g/kg seed (highly effective against damping-off).
        *   **Tebuconazole** 2% DS at 1.5 g/kg seed.
    *   **Method:** Mix the recommended quantity of the chosen fungicide thoroughly with the chilli seeds until a uniform coating is achieved.

2.  **Insecticidal Seed Treatment (Optional, for early sucking pest control):**
    *   **Purpose:** To provide systemic protection against early-season sucking pests like thrips and aphids for the first 2-3 weeks after germination/transplanting.
    *   **Options:**
        *   **Imidacloprid** 48% FS at 5-7 ml/kg seed.
        *   **Thiamethoxam** 30% FS at 4-6 ml/kg seed.
    *   **Method:** If using an insecticide, apply it after the fungicidal treatment. Mix thoroughly with the seeds.

3.  **Biological Seed Treatment (After chemical treatment):**
    *   **Purpose:** To enhance disease resistance, promote root development, and improve nutrient uptake.
    *   **Options:**
        *   **Trichoderma viride** (1-2% WP) at 4-5 g/kg seed.
        *   **Pseudomonas fluorescens** (1% WP) at 5-10 g/kg seed.
    *   **Method:** Apply biological agents after chemical treatments. Mix the bio-agent with the seeds and allow them to dry slightly in the shade before sowing.

**General Seed Treatment Procedure:**
*   Treat seeds with fungicide first, then insecticide (if used), and finally with biological agents.
*   Ensure uniform coating of the seeds.
*   Allow treated seeds to air dry in the shade for a short period before sowing.

### Recommended Soil Treatment Process for Chillies

Soil treatment is vital for managing soil-borne diseases (e.g., damping-off, wilt, root rot) and nematodes, which are significant challenges in chilli cultivation in Haryana.

1.  **Soil Solarization (Non-chemical approach):**
    *   **Purpose:** An effective method to reduce populations of soil-borne pathogens, nematodes, and weed seeds by harnessing solar energy.
    *   **Process:** During the hot summer months (May-June), plough the field, irrigate lightly to moisten the soil, and then cover the entire area with a transparent polyethylene sheet (100-micron thickness). Seal the edges of the sheet by burying them in the soil. Leave the sheet in place for 4-6 weeks.

2.  **Chemical Soil Treatment (Pre-planting/At planting):**
    *   **For Soil-borne Fungal Diseases (e.g., Damping-off, Wilt):**
        *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride** 72.2% SL: For damping-off and Phytophthora root rot, drench the nursery beds or around the base of seedlings immediately after transplanting at 2-3 ml/L water.
        *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: For Fusarium wilt management, drench the soil around the root zone at 1-2 g/L water.
    *   **For Nematode Management (Root-knot nematodes - *Meloidogyne* spp.):**
        *   **Fluensulfone** 2% GR: Apply at 10-15 kg/acre and thoroughly incorporate into the soil before transplanting.
        *   **Cadusafos** 10% GR: Apply at 10 kg/acre and incorporate into the soil before transplanting.
        *   **Fipronil** 0.3% GR: Apply at 10-15 kg/acre and incorporate into the soil before transplanting for combined control of nematodes and some soil insects.

3.  **Biological Soil Treatment (Pre-planting):**
    *   **Purpose:** To suppress soil-borne pathogens, enhance plant growth, and manage nematodes biologically.
    *   **Options:**
        *   **Trichoderma viride** (1-2% WP): Mix 2.5 kg/acre with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost. Keep the mixture moist in a shaded area for 7-10 days to allow the fungus to multiply. Broadcast this enriched FYM/compost and incorporate it into the soil 7-10 days before transplanting.
        *   **Pseudomonas fluorescens** (1% WP): Similar application method as Trichoderma viride, at 2.5 kg/acre mixed with FYM/compost.
        *   **Paecilomyces lilacinus** (1% WP): For biological control of nematodes, apply at 2.5 kg/acre mixed with FYM/compost as described above, 7-10 days before transplanting.

**Integrated Approach:**
For optimal results, an integrated approach combining soil solarization, biological treatments, and judicious use of chemical treatments (when necessary) is highly recommended. This strategy promotes sustainable chilli cultivation and minimizes reliance on chemical inputs.
