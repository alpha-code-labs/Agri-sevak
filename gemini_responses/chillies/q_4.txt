Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding Wilt in Chillies. Wilt is a serious issue that can significantly reduce yield. It's important to distinguish between pathogen-induced wilt and a physiological condition known as Parawilt, as their management strategies differ.

Here's a comprehensive approach to control Wilt (including Parawilt) in Chillies:

### I. Control of Pathogen-Induced Wilt (Fungal and Bacterial)

Pathogen-induced wilt is primarily caused by soil-borne fungi (e.g., *Fusarium oxysporum* f. sp. *capsici*, *Verticillium dahliae*) or bacteria (*Ralstonia solanacearum*).

**A. Cultural Practices (Most Important for Prevention and Management):**

*   **Resistant Varieties:** Select and plant chilli varieties known to be resistant or tolerant to wilt pathogens prevalent in your area. Consult HAU recommendations for suitable varieties for Haryana.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Implement a strict 3-4 year crop rotation with non-solanaceous crops (e.g., maize, wheat, pearl millet, mustard). Avoid continuous cultivation of chillies or other solanaceous crops (tomato, brinjal, potato) in the same field.
*   **Soil Solarization:** During the hot summer months (May-June), cover the moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks. This raises soil temperature, effectively killing many soil-borne pathogens, including wilt-causing organisms.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris and weeds, which can harbor pathogens.
*   **Proper Drainage:** Ensure good field drainage to prevent waterlogging, which favors the development of root rot and wilt pathogens.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced nutrients to plants. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can make plants more susceptible.
*   **Avoid Root Injury:** Minimize root damage during intercultural operations, as wounds can serve as entry points for pathogens.

**B. Biological Control:**

Biological agents are highly effective and environmentally friendly for managing soil-borne wilt pathogens.

*   **Seed Treatment:**
    *   **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum**: Treat seeds at 4-6 g/kg of seed.
    *   **Pseudomonas fluorescens**: Treat seeds at 10 g/kg of seed.
*   **Soil Application/Drenching:**
    *   **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum**: Mix 2.5 kg of formulation with 50 kg of farmyard manure (FYM) or compost and apply per acre before transplanting or at the time of planting. Alternatively, drench the soil around the base of plants with a solution of 5 g/L of water.
    *   **Pseudomonas fluorescens**: Mix 2.5 kg of formulation with 50 kg of FYM or compost and apply per acre. Alternatively, drench the soil around the base of plants with a solution of 5 g/L of water.

**C. Chemical Control (for managing soil-borne pathogens and root health):**

Direct chemical control for *Wilt* in Chillies is often challenging, especially for bacterial wilt. The following chemicals are approved for managing other soil-borne diseases in Chillies that can contribute to the wilt complex or affect root health.

*   **For Damping-off and Phytophthora Blight (which can lead to wilt-like symptoms):**
    *   **Propamocarb Hydrochloride 72.2% SL**: Drench the soil with 2.5 ml/L of water at the time of sowing/transplanting.
*   **For Damping-off:**
    *   **Copper Oxychloride 50% WP**: Drench the soil with 2.5 g/L of water at the time of sowing/transplanting.
    *   **Mancozeb 75% WP**: Drench the soil with 2.5 g/L of water at the time of sowing/transplanting.

### II. Control of Parawilt (Physiological Wilt)

Parawilt is a physiological disorder, not caused by a pathogen. It often occurs due to sudden changes in soil moisture, high temperatures, or root damage.

**A. Cultural Practices:**

*   **Consistent Irrigation:** Maintain uniform soil moisture. Avoid long dry spells followed by heavy irrigation, which is a common trigger for Parawilt. Use drip irrigation for better water management.
*   **Mulching:** Apply organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves) around the base of plants to conserve soil moisture, regulate soil temperature, and reduce evaporation.
*   **Improve Soil Structure:** Incorporate organic matter (FYM, compost) into the soil to improve its water-holding capacity and drainage, creating a more stable root environment.
*   **Avoid Root Disturbance:** Be careful during weeding and other intercultural operations to prevent damage to the root system.
*   **Shade Management:** In extreme heat, providing temporary shade during peak afternoon hours can help reduce plant stress.

**B. Chemical Control:**

*   There are no specific chemical controls for Parawilt as it is a physiological disorder. Focus entirely on cultural and water management practices.

**Integrated Pest and Disease Management (IPDM) is key** for effective and sustainable control of wilt in chillies. Combining resistant varieties, good cultural practices, and judicious use of biological and approved chemical agents will provide the best results. Always consult local agricultural extension services for the most current and specific recommendations for your region.
