Namaste, Kisan bhaiyon! As a Senior Agronomist from Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concerns regarding fungal diseases in Chillies. Effective management is crucial for a healthy crop and good yield.

Before delving into specific chemical controls, it's important to emphasize an Integrated Disease Management (IDM) approach. This includes:
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available and suitable for your region, choose varieties with known resistance to common diseases.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting chillies or other solanaceous crops (like tomato, brinjal, potato) in the same field year after year. A 2-3 year rotation with non-host crops helps break disease cycles.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris, weeds, and volunteer plants that can harbor pathogens.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to improve air circulation, which reduces humidity and fungal growth.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced fertilizers. Excessive nitrogen can make plants more susceptible to some diseases.
*   **Water Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation late in the day, which leaves foliage wet for extended periods. Drip irrigation is highly recommended.

Here's how to control the fungal diseases you've mentioned, based on scientifically verified methods and CIBRC-approved chemicals for Haryana:

### Fungal Disease Control in Chillies:

1.  **Alternaria (Early Blight/Leaf Spot)**
    This disease causes dark, concentric spots on leaves, stems, and fruits, leading to defoliation and reduced yield.
    *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP): 2-2.5 g/L water
    *   **Chlorothalonil** (75% WP): 2 g/L water
    *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC): 0.5-1 ml/L water
    *   **Difenoconazole** (25% EC): 0.5 ml/L water
    *   **Tebuconazole** (25% WG): 0.75-1 g/L water

2.  **Anthracnose**
    A severe disease, especially on fruits, causing sunken, circular spots with black fruiting bodies. It also affects leaves and stems.
    *   **Carbendazim** (50% WP): 1 g/L water
    *   **Thiophanate-methyl** (70% WP): 1 g/L water
    *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP): 2-2.5 g/L water (for protective action)
    *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC): 0.5-1 ml/L water
    *   **Difenoconazole** (25% EC): 0.5 ml/L water
    *   **Tebuconazole** (25% WG): 0.75-1 g/L water
    *   **Pyraclostrobin + Metiram** (5.5% + 55% WG): 2-2.5 g/L water

3.  **Blast**
    This is not known to affect Chillies.

4.  **Blight (Phytophthora Blight)**
    *Phytophthora capsici* causes rapid wilting, stem rot, fruit rot, and damping-off of seedlings, especially under wet and humid conditions.
    *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP): 2-2.5 g/L water (protective spray)
    *   **Propineb** (70% WP): 2-2.5 g/L water (protective spray)
    *   **Cymoxanil + Mancozeb** (8% + 64% WP): 2.5 g/L water
    *   **Metalaxyl-M + Mancozeb** (4% + 64% WP): 2.5 g/L water
    *   **Fenamidone + Propamocarb Hydrochloride** (10% + 37.5% SC): 2 ml/L water (for drenching or spraying)
    *   **Fluopicolide + Propamocarb Hydrochloride** (6.25% + 62.5% SC): 2 ml/L water (for drenching or spraying)

5.  **Brown Spot (Cercospora Leaf Spot)**
    Caused by *Cercospora capsici*, this disease produces circular to angular brown spots with light grey centers on leaves, leading to defoliation.
    *   **Carbendazim** (50% WP): 1 g/L water
    *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP): 2-2.5 g/L water
    *   **Chlorothalonil** (75% WP): 2 g/L water
    *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC): 0.5-1 ml/L water
    *   **Difenoconazole** (25% EC): 0.5 ml/L water
    *   **Tebuconazole** (25% WG): 0.75-1 g/L water

6.  **Downy/Powdery Mildew**
    *   **Downy Mildew:** This is not known to affect Chillies.
    *   **Powdery Mildew:** Caused by *Leveillula taurica*, this disease appears as white, powdery patches on the underside of leaves, leading to yellowing and defoliation.
        *   **Sulphur** (80% WP/WDG): 2-3 g/L water
        *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC): 0.5-1 ml/L water
        *   **Difenoconazole** (25% EC): 0.5 ml/L water
        *   **Tebuconazole** (25% WG): 0.75-1 g/L water
        *   **Myclobutanil** (10% WP): 0.5 g/L water
        *   **Penconazole** (10% EC): 0.5 ml/L water
        *   **Hexaconazole** (5% EC): 1 ml/L water

7.  **Grey Mildew**
    This is not known to affect Chillies.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label for dosage, application method, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in pathogens.
*   For best results, apply fungicides preventively or at the very first sign of disease.
*   Consult your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and current disease pressure.

By adopting these practices, you can effectively manage fungal diseases and ensure a healthy and productive chilli crop.
