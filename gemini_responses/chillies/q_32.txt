Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

The "drying up" of branches, leaves, fruits, and flowers in Chillies is a general symptom that can be caused by a variety of factors, including fungal diseases, bacterial diseases, nematode infestations, insect pests, and physiological stresses. Accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective management. I advise you to carefully observe the specific patterns and associated symptoms to identify the root cause.

Here's a comprehensive approach to address "drying up" in Chillies:

---

### I. Fungal Diseases

Several fungal pathogens can cause drying symptoms.

1.  **Dieback and Anthracnose (e.g., *Colletotrichum capsici*, *Phomopsis vexans*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Drying of twigs from the tip downwards, dark sunken lesions on fruits leading to drying, flower drop, and drying of affected flowers.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural:** Remove and destroy infected plant parts. Ensure proper plant spacing for good air circulation. Use disease-free seeds.
        *   **Chemical:**
            *   Spray with a combination fungicide like **Carbendazim 12% + Mancozeb 63% WP** at 2 g/L of water, or **Azoxystrobin 11% + Tebuconazole 18.3% SC** at 1 ml/L of water.
            *   Alternatively, use **Chlorothalonil 75% WP** at 2 g/L of water, or **Propiconazole 25% EC** at 1 ml/L of water.
            *   For severe cases, **Copper Oxychloride 50% WP** at 3 g/L of water can be effective.

2.  **Wilt Diseases (e.g., *Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. capsici*, *Phytophthora capsici*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Sudden wilting and drying of entire plants or individual branches, often starting from lower leaves. In *Phytophthora* blight, water-soaked lesions may appear on stems near the soil line, leading to stem rot and subsequent drying.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural:** Practice long crop rotations (3-4 years) with non-solanaceous crops. Use resistant varieties if available. Improve soil drainage to prevent waterlogging. Soil solarization during summer can reduce pathogen inoculum.
        *   **Biological:** Apply bio-control agents like *Trichoderma viride* or *Pseudomonas fluorescens* as a soil drench (5 g/L or 5 ml/L of water per plant) or seed treatment.
        *   **Chemical (for Phytophthora blight):**
            *   Drench the soil around affected plants with **Propamocarb Hydrochloride 72.2% SL** at 2-3 ml/L of water, or **Metalaxyl-M 4% + Mancozeb 64% WP** at 2.5 g/L of water.

### II. Bacterial Diseases

1.  **Bacterial Wilt (*Ralstonia solanacearum*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Sudden wilting of plants without yellowing, often during the hottest part of the day, with recovery at night. Eventually, the plant dries up completely. Cutting the stem near the base and placing it in water will show milky bacterial ooze.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural:** Use resistant varieties. Practice strict crop rotation with non-host crops (e.g., maize, wheat). Avoid planting in previously infected fields. Remove and destroy infected plants immediately. Avoid mechanical injury to roots during intercultural operations.
        *   **Chemical:** No highly effective chemical cure once the disease is established. However, early application of **Streptomycin Sulphate 9% + Tetracycline Hydrochloride 1% SP** at 0.5-1 g/L of water as a soil drench or foliar spray can help in reducing spread. **Copper Oxychloride 50% WP** at 3 g/L of water can also be used.

### III. Nematodes

1.  **Root-Knot Nematodes (*Meloidogyne spp.*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, wilting, and drying of plants, especially under water stress. Examination of roots will reveal characteristic galls or swellings.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops (e.g., marigold, mustard). Summer ploughing helps expose nematodes to sun. Incorporate organic matter (e.g., neem cake) into the soil.
        *   **Biological:** Apply bio-nematicides like *Paecilomyces lilacinus* or *Purpureocillium lilacinum* (5 kg/acre mixed with 100 kg farmyard manure) at the time of planting.
        *   **Chemical:**
            *   Apply **Cadusafos 10% GR** at 8 kg/acre as a soil application at the time of planting or transplanting.

### IV. Insect Pests

1.  **Thrips (*Scirtothrips dorsalis*) and Mites (*Polyphagotarsonemus latus*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Thrips cause upward curling and crinkling of leaves, bronzing, and drying of flowers and young fruits. Mites cause downward curling, bronzing, and leathery texture of leaves, leading to drying and defoliation. Severe infestations can lead to overall plant decline and drying.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural:** Remove weeds from the field and surrounding areas. Use yellow sticky traps to monitor thrips.
        *   **Chemical (for Thrips):**
            *   Spray with **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL** at 0.5 ml/L of water, or **Thiamethoxam 25% WG** at 0.2 g/L of water, or **Fipronil 5% SC** at 1.5 ml/L of water, or **Spinosad 45% SC** at 0.3 ml/L of water.
        *   **Chemical (for Mites):**
            *   Spray with **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC** at 0.5 ml/L of water, or **Fenpyroximate 5% SC** at 1 ml/L of water, or **Propargite 57% EC** at 2 ml/L of water.

2.  **Stem Borers (e.g., *Leucinodes orbonalis* - though primarily fruit borer, can bore into stems; *Sphenoptera perrotteti*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Wilting and drying of individual branches or the entire plant due to internal damage to the stem, disrupting water and nutrient flow. Boreholes may be visible on the stem.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural:** Remove and destroy affected branches or plants.
        *   **Chemical:**
            *   Spray with **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC** at 0.3 ml/L of water, or **Emamectin Benzoate 5% SG** at 0.4 g/L of water.

### V. Physiological / Environmental Stress

1.  **Water Stress (Drought or Waterlogging)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Wilting, yellowing, leaf scorch, and drying of leaves and branches. Drought causes desiccation, while waterlogging damages roots, leading to wilting and drying due to impaired water uptake.
    *   **Management:** Ensure proper irrigation scheduling. Provide adequate drainage to prevent waterlogging. Use mulching to conserve soil moisture.

2.  **Nutrient Deficiencies**
    *   **Symptoms:** Specific nutrient deficiencies can lead to yellowing, necrosis, and drying of leaves (e.g., potassium deficiency can cause marginal leaf scorch and drying).
    *   **Management:** Conduct soil testing to identify deficiencies and apply balanced fertilizers as per recommendations. Foliar sprays of micronutrients can provide quick relief.

3.  **Heat Stress / Sunscald**
    *   **Symptoms:** White or papery patches on fruits, scorching and drying of leaves, especially during hot, dry periods.
    *   **Management:** Provide partial shade during peak summer months using shade nets. Ensure adequate irrigation to help plants cope with heat.

### General Recommendations for Integrated Management:

*   **Field Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy diseased plant debris and weeds.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Whenever possible, choose chilli varieties known for resistance or tolerance to common diseases and pests in your region.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Implement a sound crop rotation plan to break disease and pest cycles.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced nutrition based on soil test reports to ensure strong, healthy plants that are more resilient to stress.
*   **Proper Irrigation:** Maintain optimal soil moisture levels. Avoid both drought and waterlogging.
*   **Regular Scouting:** Regularly inspect your chilli plants for early signs of disease or pest infestation to allow for timely intervention.

For precise diagnosis and specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions, it is always advisable to consult with the experts at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU), Hisar, or your local Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK).
