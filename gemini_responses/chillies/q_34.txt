Herbicide injury in chillies can significantly reduce yield and quality. The most effective way to reduce harmful effects is through strict adherence to best application practices and careful selection of chemicals.

Here's how to reduce the harmful effects of weedicides/herbicides in chillies:

**I. Preventative Measures (Most Important to Avoid Harm)**

1.  **Correct Herbicide Selection:**
    *   Always use herbicides specifically approved and recommended for chilli cultivation in Haryana. Using non-selective herbicides or those not registered for chillies will cause severe damage.
    *   For pre-emergence weed control, options like **Pendimethalin** or **Oxyfluorfen** are generally used. For post-emergence control of grassy weeds, selective herbicides such as **Quizalofop-ethyl** or **Fluazifop-p-butyl** are common. Always consult the product label for specific crop safety and application guidelines.

2.  **Accurate Dosage and Calibration:**
    *   Overdosing is a primary cause of herbicide injury. Calibrate your sprayer regularly to ensure the correct application rate (e.g., litres per acre or ml/L).
    *   Strictly follow the recommended dosage mentioned on the product label. Do not exceed the recommended rates.

3.  **Correct Application Timing:**
    *   Apply herbicides at the recommended crop growth stage and weed growth stage. Applying too early or too late can increase phytotoxicity.
    *   Avoid application during extreme temperatures (very hot or very cold) or when the crop is under stress (water stress, nutrient deficiency).

4.  **Sprayer Management:**
    *   Use dedicated sprayers for herbicides if possible. If not, thoroughly clean the sprayer with a triple-rinse method using water and a cleaning agent (e.g., household detergent or ammonia solution) after using other pesticides, especially non-selective herbicides like **Glyphosate** or broadleaf herbicides like **2,4-D**, which can cause severe damage even in trace amounts.
    *   Ensure all parts of the sprayer, including nozzles, filters, and tank, are clean and free from residues.

5.  **Drift Management:**
    *   Herbicide drift onto chillies from adjacent fields or non-target areas is a major concern. Apply herbicides on calm days with wind speeds less than 10 km/h.
    *   Use drift-reducing nozzles (e.g., air-induction nozzles) and maintain a low boom height (typically 30-50 cm above the target canopy).
    *   Apply at appropriate spray pressure, avoiding excessively high pressures that produce fine, drift-prone droplets.

6.  **Soil and Crop Health:**
    *   Ensure chillies are healthy and well-nourished before herbicide application. Stressed plants are more susceptible to herbicide injury.
    *   Consider soil type and organic matter content, as some herbicides have higher activity in light soils with low organic matter.

**II. Mitigation Strategies (If Injury Has Occurred)**

1.  **Immediate Irrigation:**
    *   If a soil-applied herbicide overdose or drift is suspected, immediate light irrigation can help dilute and leach the herbicide away from the root zone, reducing uptake by the plant.
    *   For foliar-applied herbicides, if detected immediately, washing the foliage with plain water might help reduce absorption, though this is often impractical in field conditions.

2.  **Nutritional Support:**
    *   Provide foliar application of micronutrients and plant growth regulators to help the plant recover from stress and promote new growth.
    *   A general recommendation could be a foliar spray of a multi-micronutrient mixture (e.g., containing Zinc, Iron, Manganese, Boron) at 2-3 g/L of water, or a soluble NPK fertilizer (e.g., 19:19:19) at 5 g/L of water.
    *   Ensure adequate soil fertility to support recovery.

3.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Light inter-cultivation can sometimes help to aerate the soil and break up herbicide layers, especially for soil-applied herbicides, but be careful not to damage roots.
    *   Remove severely damaged leaves or branches if the plant is still viable, to encourage new, healthy growth.
