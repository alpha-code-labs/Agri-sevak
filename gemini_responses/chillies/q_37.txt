As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified methods to protect your Chilli crop from wild animals, which commonly include Nilgai (Blue Bull), Wild Boar, and Monkeys in Haryana:

1.  **Physical Barriers:**
    *   **Robust Fencing:** This is the most effective method for deterring larger animals.
        *   **Barbed Wire Fencing:** Install a strong fence with 5-7 strands of barbed wire, reaching a height of 1.2 to 1.5 meters. This is effective against Nilgai and Wild Boar.
        *   **Chain-link or Woven Wire Fencing:** For more comprehensive protection, especially against smaller animals and to supplement barbed wire, a chain-link or woven wire fence (e.g., 10-12 gauge, 1.2-1.8 m high) can be installed.
        *   **Electric Fencing:** A low-voltage, solar-powered electric fence can be highly effective. It delivers a non-lethal shock that deters animals without causing harm. Ensure proper installation, grounding, and regular maintenance for safety and efficacy.
    *   **Trenches:** Digging deep trenches (e.g., 1-1.5 meters deep and 0.5-0.75 meters wide) around the field can be effective against burrowing animals and wild boars.

2.  **Scare Tactics and Deterrents:**
    *   **Human Presence:** Regular patrolling and human presence in and around the field, especially during vulnerable periods (dawn, dusk, and night), can deter many animals.
    *   **Scarecrows and Reflective Devices:** Use traditional scarecrows, but move them frequently and change their appearance to prevent animals from getting accustomed. Hanging reflective strips, old CDs, or metallic objects can also create visual deterrents.
    *   **Noise Makers:** Employ sound-based deterrents such as gas guns (LPG-based bird/animal scarers), drums, or firecrackers (used judiciously and legally) to scare away animals.
    *   **Guard Dogs:** Well-trained guard dogs can be an effective deterrent, especially against nocturnal animals.

3.  **Habitat Management:**
    *   **Clear Field Edges:** Remove weeds, bushes, and other vegetation from the periphery of the chilli field. This reduces cover and hiding spots for wild animals, making the area less attractive to them.

4.  **Repellents (Limited Application for Large Animals):**
    *   While chemical repellents specifically for large mammals in crop protection are not as widely effective or commonly approved by CIBRC as insecticides, some general repellents can be considered.
    *   **Neem-based formulations:** Products containing **Azadirachtin** (e.g., 1500 ppm or 3000 ppm formulations) can have some repellent properties against certain animals and birds, in addition to their primary insecticidal action. Apply as per label instructions, typically 2-5 ml/L of water. *It is important to note that their primary efficacy is against insect pests, and their repellent effect on large mammals like Nilgai or Wild Boar is generally limited.*
    *   **Traditional Repellents:** Some farmers use strong-smelling substances like fermented cow dung slurry, urine-soaked rags, or even human hair placed around the field. The scientific efficacy of these methods varies, but they are low-cost options.

5.  **Community-Based Approach:**
    *   **Coordinated Efforts:** Encourage farmers in a village or cluster of fields to adopt protection measures collectively. A coordinated approach, such as community fencing or shared patrolling, is often more effective than individual efforts, as animals can simply move to unprotected fields.
