Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the challenges posed by sucking pests in chilli cultivation. Effective management is crucial for a healthy crop and good yield. Here's a scientifically verified approach for controlling Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips in Chillies in Haryana.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategy for Sucking Pests in Chillies:**

A holistic approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods is most effective and sustainable.

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Regular Monitoring:** Frequently inspect plants (especially undersides of leaves and growing tips) for early detection of pests.
*   **Weed Management:** Remove weeds from and around the chilli fields as they often act as alternate hosts for these pests.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush growth, making plants more attractive to sucking pests.
*   **Water Management:** Ensure proper irrigation to reduce plant stress.
*   **Reflective Mulches:** Use silver-colored plastic mulches in the early stages of crop growth to deter thrips and whiteflies.
*   **Yellow Sticky Traps:** Install yellow sticky traps (15-20 traps per acre) at canopy height to monitor and trap adult whiteflies, aphids, and leafhoppers.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation to break the pest cycle.
*   **Removal of Infected Plants:** Promptly remove and destroy severely infested plants or plant parts to prevent further spread.

**2. Biological Control:**
*   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Protect and encourage natural predators like ladybird beetles, lacewings, syrphid fly larvae, and parasitic wasps (e.g., *Encarsia formosa* for whiteflies) which feed on these pests. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.
*   **Biopesticides:** Consider using biopesticides like entomopathogenic fungi (e.g., *Verticillium lecanii* or *Beauveria bassiana*) during early infestation stages, especially under high humidity conditions.

**3. Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved Technical Chemicals):**

When pest populations exceed economic threshold levels, judicious application of CIBRC approved insecticides is necessary. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

**For general control of Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips:**

*   **Systemic Insecticides (for early infestation and good residual action):**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** 0.5 - 0.75 ml per litre of water (or 100 - 150 ml per acre).
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** 0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water (or 50 - 100 g per acre).
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** 0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water (or 50 - 100 g per acre).
    *   **Dinotefuran 20% SG:** 0.2 - 0.3 g per litre of water (or 60 - 80 g per acre).

*   **Contact/Translaminar Insecticides (for quick knockdown and resistance management):**
    *   **Fipronil 5% SC:** 1.5 - 2 ml per litre of water (or 300 - 400 ml per acre). (Particularly effective against Thrips).
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** 0.5 - 0.75 ml per litre of water (or 100 - 150 ml per acre). (Effective against Thrips and Leafhoppers).
    *   **Acephate 75% SP:** 1 - 1.5 g per litre of water (or 250 - 375 g per acre).

*   **Specific for Whiteflies (especially nymphs) and Mites:**
    *   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** 0.5 - 0.75 ml per litre of water (or 150 - 200 ml per acre).
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** 1.25 ml per litre of water (or 250 ml per acre). (Insect Growth Regulator, targets nymphs).

*   **Specific for Aphids:**
    *   **Flonicamid 50% WG:** 0.3 g per litre of water (or 60 g per acre).

**Regarding Psylla:**

*   This is not known to affect Chillies as a significant pest in Haryana. Psyllids are primarily pests of other crops like citrus or potato/tomato.

**Important Considerations for Chemical Application:**
*   **Spray Coverage:** Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where many sucking pests reside.
*   **Timing:** Apply insecticides during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   **Water Volume:** Use adequate water volume (typically 200-250 litres per acre, depending on crop size) to ensure proper coverage.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Strictly observe the Pre-Harvest Interval mentioned on the insecticide label before harvesting chillies.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate insecticides with different modes of action (indicated by IRAC codes on labels) to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.
