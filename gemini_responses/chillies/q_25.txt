As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified irrigation management practices for Chillies (Capsicum annuum L.) in Haryana:

Chillies are sensitive to both water stress and waterlogging. Proper irrigation management is crucial for optimal growth, flowering, fruit set, and yield, especially during critical growth stages. The total water requirement for chillies typically ranges from 600-900 mm over their growing period, depending on soil type, climate, and variety.

**1. First Irrigation:**
*   **Timing:** The first irrigation is critical and should be given immediately after transplanting the chilli seedlings. This helps in settling the soil around the roots, establishing root-soil contact, and minimizing transplant shock.
*   **Method:** A light irrigation is preferred to avoid waterlogging around the tender seedlings. It should be sufficient to moisten the root zone without causing runoff or standing water.
*   **Purpose:** Ensures quick establishment of seedlings and reduces mortality.

**2. Second Irrigation:**
*   **Timing:** The second irrigation is typically given 4-7 days after the first irrigation, depending on the soil type and prevailing weather conditions.
    *   **Sandy soils:** May require irrigation closer to 4-5 days due to lower water holding capacity.
    *   **Loamy to clay-loamy soils:** Can wait up to 6-7 days.
    *   **Weather:** Hot, dry, and windy conditions will necessitate earlier irrigation.
*   **Method:** Similar to the first, a light to moderate irrigation is usually sufficient. The goal is to maintain adequate soil moisture without over-saturating the root zone.
*   **Purpose:** Continues to support seedling establishment and promotes initial vegetative growth.

**3. Subsequent Irrigations:**
*   **Frequency:** Subsequent irrigations should be scheduled based on soil moisture depletion, crop growth stage, and prevailing weather.
    *   **Vegetative Stage:** Moderate water requirement.
    *   **Flowering and Fruit Development Stage:** This is the most critical period for water. Water stress during these stages can lead to flower drop, poor fruit set, and reduced fruit size and quality. Irrigation should be more frequent during this period (e.g., every 7-10 days in loamy soils, more frequently in sandy soils).
    *   **Fruiting Stage:** Continue regular irrigation to support fruit development and ripening.
*   **Indicators:**
    *   **Soil feel method:** Check soil moisture at 15-20 cm depth. If it feels dry, irrigate.
    *   **Plant wilting:** Avoid letting plants reach visible wilting, as this indicates significant stress.
    *   **Evapotranspiration (ET) data:** For advanced management, use local ET data to estimate water loss.
*   **General Rule:** Maintain consistent soil moisture. Avoid extremes of very wet or very dry conditions.

**4. Sprinkler Use in Chillies:**
*   **Suitability:** Sprinkler irrigation, particularly micro-sprinklers or mini-sprinklers, is highly suitable for chilli cultivation in Haryana. Drip irrigation is even more efficient but sprinklers offer good water distribution and can be more cost-effective for some farmers.
*   **Advantages:**
    *   **Water Saving:** Significantly reduces water consumption compared to flood irrigation (up to 30-50% saving).
    *   **Uniform Water Distribution:** Ensures even application of water across the field, leading to uniform crop growth.
    *   **Reduced Leaching:** Minimizes the loss of nutrients through deep percolation.
    *   **Improved Fertilizer Use Efficiency:** Fertigation (applying fertilizers through the irrigation system) can be effectively implemented.
    *   **Soil Health:** Prevents soil erosion and maintains soil structure better than flood irrigation.
    *   **Weed Control:** Reduces weed growth in non-irrigated areas between rows.
    *   **Temperature Regulation:** Can help in cooling the canopy during hot periods.
*   **Management Considerations for Sprinklers:**
    *   **Nozzle Selection:** Choose appropriate nozzle sizes and sprinkler types (e.g., micro-sprinklers, mini-sprinklers) to match the soil infiltration rate and crop water requirement.
    *   **Pressure Regulation:** Maintain optimal operating pressure for uniform water distribution.
    *   **Scheduling:** Adjust irrigation duration and frequency based on ET, soil type, and crop stage. Shorter, more frequent irrigations are often beneficial with sprinklers.
    *   **Disease Management:** While sprinklers are beneficial, overhead wetting of foliage can sometimes increase the risk of certain foliar diseases, especially if irrigation is done late in the day, preventing leaves from drying before nightfall. It's advisable to irrigate in the morning or early afternoon.
    *   **Wind Drift:** Strong winds can affect the uniformity of water distribution. Consider irrigating during calmer periods.

By adopting these irrigation practices, chilli growers in Haryana can optimize water use, enhance crop health, and achieve higher yields and better quality produce.
