As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding various rot types in Chillies. Rots are a significant challenge, often caused by a complex of fungal and oomycete pathogens. Effective management requires an integrated approach combining cultural practices, biological methods, and judicious use of CIBRC-approved chemicals.

Here's a comprehensive guide to control rot types in Chillies:

**I. General Cultural and Preventive Measures (Crucial for all Rot Types):**

1.  **Site Selection and Soil Preparation:**
    *   Choose well-drained fields. Avoid low-lying areas prone to waterlogging.
    *   Ensure proper land leveling and raised beds to facilitate drainage.
    *   Deep ploughing and solarization (covering soil with transparent polythene during hot months) can reduce pathogen inoculum.
2.  **Crop Rotation:**
    *   Avoid continuous cultivation of chillies or other solanaceous crops (tomato, brinjal, potato) in the same field.
    *   Rotate with non-host crops like cereals (wheat, maize), pulses (gram, lentil), or oilseeds (mustard) for at least 2-3 years.
3.  **Resistant Varieties:**
    *   Where available and suitable for Haryana conditions, select chilli varieties known for resistance or tolerance to major rot-causing pathogens like *Phytophthora capsici*. Consult HAU recommendations for specific varieties.
4.  **Seed Health and Treatment:**
    *   Use certified, disease-free seeds.
    *   Always treat seeds before sowing to protect against seed-borne and soil-borne pathogens causing seed rot and damping-off.
5.  **Nursery Management:**
    *   Prepare nursery beds in well-drained areas.
    *   Sterilize nursery soil using solarization or chemical methods (e.g., Formaldehyde, though less common now).
    *   Avoid overcrowding of seedlings.
    *   Ensure proper ventilation and light.
6.  **Water Management:**
    *   Irrigate judiciously. Avoid overhead irrigation, especially during flowering and fruiting, which can spread spores.
    *   Use drip irrigation where feasible, as it delivers water directly to the root zone, keeping foliage dry and reducing soil splash.
    *   Avoid waterlogging at all stages of crop growth.
7.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Provide balanced nutrition. Excessive nitrogen can lead to lush growth, making plants more susceptible.
    *   Ensure adequate potassium and calcium, which contribute to plant vigor and disease resistance.
8.  **Sanitation:**
    *   Remove and destroy infected plant debris (leaves, stems, fruits) from the field to reduce inoculum.
    *   Keep the field free of weeds, which can act as alternate hosts or create humid microclimates.
9.  **Plant Spacing:**
    *   Maintain recommended plant spacing to ensure good air circulation, reducing humidity around plants.

**II. Specific Control Measures for Rot Types:**

Many rot types (Root, Stem, Foot, Collar, Crown, Seed, Seedling Rot) are caused by soil-borne pathogens like *Phytophthora spp.*, *Pythium spp.*, *Rhizoctonia solani*, *Sclerotium rolfsii*, and *Fusarium spp.* Fruit Rot is often caused by *Colletotrichum capsici*, *Phytophthora capsici*, and *Alternaria alternata*. "Black Rot" is not a specific disease name for chillies, but dark-colored rots can be caused by *Phytophthora capsici* or *Alternaria alternata*. "Neck Rot" is also not a specific disease name; if it refers to the base of the plant, it's covered by collar/stem rot; if it refers to the fruit pedicel, it's fruit rot.

**A. Seed Rot and Seedling Rot (Damping-off):**

These are primarily caused by *Pythium spp.*, *Phytophthora spp.*, *Rhizoctonia solani*, and *Fusarium spp.*

*   **Seed Treatment (Mandatory):**
    *   **Thiram** 75% WS @ 2-3 g/kg seed
    *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP @ 1-2 g/kg seed
    *   **Metalaxyl-M** 35% WS @ 6 g/kg seed (especially effective against *Pythium* and *Phytophthora*)
    *   **Captan** 75% WS @ 2-3 g/kg seed
    *   *Alternatively, for biological control:* **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum** @ 4-5 g/kg seed.

**B. Root Rot, Stem Rot, Foot Rot, Collar Rot, Crown Rot:**

These are mainly caused by *Phytophthora capsici*, *Sclerotium rolfsii*, *Rhizoctonia solani*, and *Fusarium spp.*

*   **Soil Drenching / Drip Application (at transplanting or appearance of symptoms):**
    *   **Propamocarb Hydrochloride** 72.2% SL @ 2-3 ml/L water (for *Phytophthora*, *Pythium*)
    *   **Metalaxyl-M** 4% + **Mancozeb** 64% WP @ 2-2.5 g/L water (for *Phytophthora*, *Pythium*)
    *   **Fosetyl-Aluminium** 80% WP @ 2-2.5 g/L water (for *Phytophthora*)
    *   **Validamycin** 3% L @ 2-3 ml/L water (for *Rhizoctonia*, *Sclerotium*)
    *   **Hexaconazole** 5% SC @ 1-2 ml/L water (for *Rhizoctonia*, *Sclerotium*)
    *   *For biological control:* **Trichoderma viride** or **Pseudomonas fluorescens** @ 2.5 kg/acre mixed with 50 kg Farm Yard Manure (FYM) and applied to the soil, or 5-10 g/L water for drenching.

**C. Fruit Rot (including dark-colored rots often referred to as "Black Rot"):**

Primarily caused by *Colletotrichum capsici* (Anthracnose), *Phytophthora capsici*, and *Alternaria alternata*.

*   **Foliar Sprays (at flowering/fruiting stage or symptom appearance):**
    *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC @ 0.5-1 ml/L water
    *   **Pyraclostrobin** 6.7% + **Metiram** 55% WG @ 1.5-2 g/L water
    *   **Carbendazim** 12% + **Mancozeb** 63% WP @ 2-2.5 g/L water
    *   **Tebuconazole** 25.9% EC @ 0.75-1 ml/L water
    *   **Chlorothalonil** 75% WP @ 2 g/L water
    *   **Copper Oxychloride** 50% WP @ 2.5-3 g/L water (broad-spectrum, can help with *Phytophthora* and some bacterial issues)

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Integrated Disease Management (IDM):** Always combine cultural practices with chemical control for sustainable and effective management.
*   **Alternation of Chemicals:** To prevent the development of fungicide resistance, rotate fungicides with different modes of action.
*   **Timing of Application:** Apply fungicides preventively or at the very first sign of disease.
*   **Adherence to Label Instructions:** Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the fungicide label regarding dosage, application method, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and safety precautions.
