Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling mites in chillies. Both Red Spider Mite (*Tetranychus urticae*) and Broad Mite (*Polyphagotarsonemus latus*, often referred to as Rust Mite due to the bronzing symptoms) are significant pests of chillies in Haryana and can cause considerable yield losses if not managed effectively.

An Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is crucial for sustainable and effective control.

### Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies for Mite Control in Chillies:

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**

*   **Field Sanitation:** Regularly remove weeds from and around the chilli fields, as they can act as alternate hosts for mites.
*   **Removal of Infested Parts:** Prune and destroy severely infested leaves, shoots, or plants to reduce the initial mite population.
*   **Proper Irrigation:** Maintain adequate soil moisture. Water stress can make plants more susceptible to mite infestations. Overhead irrigation (sprinkler) can sometimes help wash off mites, but ensure it doesn't promote fungal diseases.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush, soft growth that is more attractive to mites. Maintain balanced nutrition.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate chillies with non-solanaceous crops to break the pest cycle.

**2. Biological Control:**

*   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Several predatory mites (e.g., *Amblyseius* species) and insects (e.g., ladybird beetles, lacewings) naturally prey on pest mites. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial organisms.
*   **Release of Predatory Mites:** In protected cultivation or high-value crops, commercial release of predatory mites can be considered, though this is less common in open field conditions in Haryana.

**3. Chemical Control (Acaricides):**

When mite populations reach economic threshold levels, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Use only CIBRC approved technical chemical names.

*   **For Red Spider Mite and Broad Mite:**
    *   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** Apply at 0.5 ml per litre of water (approximately 100-120 ml per acre in 200-240 litres of water).
    *   **Fenpyroximate 5% SC:** Apply at 1.0 ml per litre of water (approximately 200 ml per acre in 200 litres of water).
    *   **Propargite 57% EC:** Apply at 2.0 ml per litre of water (approximately 400-600 ml per acre in 200-300 litres of water).
    *   **Abamectin 1.9% EC:** Apply at 0.5 ml per litre of water (approximately 100 ml per acre in 200 litres of water).
    *   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP:** Apply at 2.0-3.0 g per litre of water (approximately 400-600 g per acre in 200 litres of water). This is effective, especially in early stages or for prevention, and also has fungicidal properties. Avoid spraying when temperatures are very high (>35°C) as it can cause phytotoxicity.
    *   **Fenazaquin 10% EC:** Apply at 1.0 ml per litre of water (approximately 200 ml per acre in 200 litres of water).
    *   **Pyridaben 10% WP:** Apply at 1.0 g per litre of water (approximately 200 g per acre in 200 litres of water).
    *   **Ethion 50% EC:** Apply at 2.0 ml per litre of water (approximately 400 ml per acre in 200 litres of water).

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Thorough Coverage:** Mites are often found on the undersides of leaves. Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the lower leaf surfaces, for effective control.
*   **Rotation of Acaricides:** To prevent the development of resistance, never use the same acaricide repeatedly. Rotate chemicals with different modes of action.
*   **Monitoring:** Regularly scout your chilli fields to detect mite infestations early. Early detection allows for timely and more effective intervention.
*   **Safety Precautions:** Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label, including dosage, application method, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and safety precautions (wearing protective clothing, gloves, mask).

By adopting these practices, you can effectively manage mite populations in your chilli crop and ensure good yields. For specific local recommendations, please consult your nearest Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or HAU extension specialist.
