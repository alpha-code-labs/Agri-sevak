As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I must provide scientifically verified advice.

Black rust, Brown rust, Yellow rust, White rust, and Red rust (as fungal rust diseases) are not known to be significant diseases affecting Chillies (*Capsicum annuum*) in Haryana. These rusts primarily affect other crops like cereals (wheat, barley, rye) or specific host plants (e.g., white rust on crucifers).

Therefore, specific control measures for these rusts are not typically required for Chillies. If you are observing symptoms that resemble rust, it might be another disease or a physiological condition. It is advisable to get the symptoms accurately diagnosed by an expert from HAU or a local agricultural extension office.
