As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following cultivation practices for Chillies in Haryana:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   Chillies are primarily grown by transplanting seedlings raised in a nursery. This allows for better management of young plants and ensures a uniform stand in the main field.
    *   Nursery beds should be prepared as raised beds (1.0 m wide, 15-20 cm high, and convenient length) to ensure good drainage and aeration.
    *   Seedlings are typically transplanted to the main field when they are 4-6 weeks old or have 4-5 true leaves.
    *   Transplanting can be done on flatbeds, but planting on **ridges or raised beds** is often preferred, especially in areas prone to waterlogging, as it improves drainage and aeration around the root zone.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   **Nursery Sowing:** Seeds should be sown shallowly, about 0.5 - 1.0 cm deep, and lightly covered with fine soil or sand.
    *   **Transplanting:** Seedlings should be planted at the same depth they were growing in the nursery, ensuring the root ball is completely covered with soil. Avoid planting too deep or too shallow.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   Optimal spacing is crucial for proper plant growth, light penetration, air circulation, and yield. Spacing can vary slightly based on variety (bushy vs. erect) and soil fertility.
    *   A common and recommended spacing for Chillies in Haryana is:
        *   **Row-to-row:** 60 - 75 cm
        *   **Plant-to-plant:** 45 - 60 cm

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   The seed rate depends on the type of variety (open-pollinated vs. hybrid) and the desired plant population.
    *   **For Open-Pollinated Varieties:** 1.0 - 1.5 kg per acre
    *   **For Hybrid Varieties:** 200 - 250 g per acre (due to higher germination percentage and vigor, and often higher seed cost)
