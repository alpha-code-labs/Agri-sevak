As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned conditions in Chillies in Haryana:

### Dieback and Twig Blight in Chillies

**Causal Agents:** Dieback and Twig Blight in Chillies are primarily caused by fungal pathogens such as *Colletotrichum capsici* (which also causes anthracnose), *Alternaria solani*, or sometimes *Phytophthora capsici*.

**Symptoms:** These diseases are characterized by the drying back of twigs and branches from the tip downwards. Dark, sunken lesions may appear on stems and branches, leading to defoliation, flower drop, and fruit rot. The affected parts eventually shrivel and die.

**Control Measures:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Use disease-free seeds or treat seeds with a recommended fungicide before sowing.
    *   Maintain proper plant spacing to ensure good air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce humidity.
    *   Remove and destroy all infected plant debris, fallen leaves, and alternate host weeds from the field to reduce inoculum sources.
    *   Avoid overhead irrigation, especially during flowering and fruiting stages, as prolonged leaf wetness favors disease development. Drip irrigation is preferable.
    *   Prune affected twigs and branches immediately upon noticing symptoms and destroy them. Sanitize pruning tools between cuts.

2.  **Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
    For effective management, a combination of contact and systemic fungicides is often recommended. Initiate spraying at the first sign of symptoms or as a prophylactic measure during susceptible stages (e.g., flowering and fruit set). Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

    *   **Mancozeb** at 2.0-2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L of water).
    *   **Carbendazim** at 500 g/acre (or 0.5 g/L of water).
    *   **Azoxystrobin** at 200 ml/acre (or 0.2 ml/L of water).
    *   **Difenoconazole** at 100-150 ml/acre (or 0.1-0.15 ml/L of water).
    *   **Copper oxychloride** at 2.0-2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L of water).

    Apply sprays at 10-15 day intervals, depending on disease severity and prevailing weather conditions. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions for dosage and safety precautions.

### Tikka Disease in Chillies

This is not known to affect Chillies. Tikka disease is primarily a significant foliar disease of groundnut (peanut), caused by *Cercospora arachidicola* and *Phaeoisariopsis personata*.

For specific local recommendations and current CIBRC guidelines, it is always advisable to consult with your local agricultural extension officer or the experts at HAU, Hisar.
