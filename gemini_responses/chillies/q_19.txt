Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice to address macro-nutrient deficiencies in Chillies.

First and foremost, it is crucial to conduct a **soil test** to accurately determine the nutrient status of your field. This will help in precise fertilizer application, preventing both deficiencies and excesses, and ensuring optimal plant health and yield.

Here's how to address deficiencies of Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K) in Chillies:

### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   General yellowing (chlorosis) of older leaves, starting from the tips and moving inwards.
*   Stunted plant growth with thin, spindly stems.
*   Reduced branching and smaller leaves.

**Correction Measures:**

*   **Foliar Application (for quick correction of mild to moderate deficiency):**
    *   Prepare a 1-2% solution of **Urea**.
    *   Mix **10-20 g** of **Urea** per litre of water.
    *   Spray the solution evenly on the foliage during cooler parts of the day (morning or late afternoon).
    *   Repeat 2-3 times at 7-10 day intervals if symptoms persist.

*   **Soil Application (for severe deficiency or as a preventive measure based on soil test):**
    *   Apply **Urea** at a rate of **10-15 kg** per acre as a top-dressing.
    *   Alternatively, **Calcium Ammonium Nitrate** can be used.
    *   Ensure the fertilizer is broadcast evenly and lightly incorporated into the soil, followed by irrigation.
    *   Split applications are generally more effective to prevent leaching losses.

### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   Dark green to purplish discoloration of leaves, especially on the undersides and petioles, particularly in older leaves.
*   Stunted growth, poor root development, and delayed maturity.
*   Reduced flowering and fruit set.

**Correction Measures:**

*   **Foliar Application (for mild deficiency, though less effective than soil application for P):**
    *   Prepare a 0.5-1% solution of **Monoammonium Phosphate** or **Potassium Dihydrogen Phosphate**.
    *   Mix **5-10 g** of **Monoammonium Phosphate** or **Potassium Dihydrogen Phosphate** per litre of water.
    *   Spray the solution evenly on the foliage.
    *   Repeat 2-3 times at 7-10 day intervals.

*   **Soil Application (most effective for P deficiency):**
    *   Apply **Single Superphosphate** at a rate of **125-187 kg** per acre (to supply 20-30 kg P2O5 per acre).
    *   Alternatively, **Diammonium Phosphate** can be applied at a rate of **43-65 kg** per acre (to supply 20-30 kg P2O5 per acre).
    *   Phosphorus is relatively immobile in the soil, so it is best applied at planting or early growth stages, incorporated into the soil near the root zone. For existing plants, broadcast and lightly incorporate, or apply in bands near the plants, followed by irrigation.

### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   Yellowing and browning (scorching or necrosis) of leaf margins, especially on older leaves.
*   Weak stems, lodging (falling over) of plants.
*   Poor fruit development, reduced fruit size, and quality.
*   Increased susceptibility to diseases and drought stress.

**Correction Measures:**

*   **Foliar Application (for quick correction of mild to moderate deficiency):**
    *   Prepare a 1-2% solution of **Potassium Nitrate** or **Potassium Sulphate**.
    *   Mix **10-20 g** of **Potassium Nitrate** or **Potassium Sulphate** per litre of water.
    *   Spray the solution evenly on the foliage.
    *   Repeat 2-3 times at 7-10 day intervals.

*   **Soil Application (for severe deficiency or as a preventive measure based on soil test):**
    *   Apply **Potassium Chloride** (Muriate of Potash) at a rate of **33-67 kg** per acre (to supply 20-40 kg K2O per acre).
    *   Alternatively, **Potassium Sulphate** can be applied at a rate of **40-80 kg** per acre (to supply 20-40 kg K2O per acre).
    *   Broadcast the fertilizer evenly and lightly incorporate it into the soil, followed by irrigation. Potassium can be applied as basal or as a top-dressing.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always ensure proper irrigation after soil application of fertilizers to facilitate nutrient uptake and prevent root burn.
*   Observe your plants closely after application to monitor their response.
*   For long-term soil health and balanced nutrition, integrate organic manures (Farm Yard Manure, compost) into your soil management practices as recommended by HAU.

For specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions, please consult with the agricultural extension services of HAU or your local Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK).
