As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend the following strategies to protect your Chilli crop from environmental stresses:

### Protection from Extreme Cold and Frost

Extreme cold and frost can severely damage Chilli plants, leading to wilting, leaf drop, and fruit damage.

*   **Irrigation:** Apply light irrigation to the field in the evening before a predicted cold spell. Water has a higher specific heat capacity and releases latent heat slowly, which can raise the soil temperature and protect roots.
*   **Mulching:** Apply a thick layer (5-10 cm) of organic mulch such as straw, dry leaves, or sugarcane trash around the base of the plants. This insulates the soil, retains warmth, and protects the root zone from freezing.
*   **Covering:** For small areas or young plants, cover them with straw, hessian cloth, or plastic sheets during the night. Ensure to remove the covers during the day to allow sunlight and air circulation.
*   **Windbreaks:** Plant taller, fast-growing crops (e.g., mustard, wheat) or erect temporary barriers on the northern and western sides of the field to protect the Chilli plants from cold, dry winds.
*   **Foliar Spray:**
    *   **Potassium nitrate** (10-20 g/L water, i.e., 1-2% solution) can be sprayed on the foliage a few days before a predicted cold wave. This helps improve the plant's physiological tolerance to cold stress.

### Protection from Heat and Loo (Hot Winds)

High temperatures and hot, dry winds (Loo) can cause flower drop, fruit abortion, sunscald, and general plant stress.

*   **Irrigation:** Maintain adequate soil moisture through frequent, light irrigation, especially during the hottest parts of the day. Drip irrigation is highly effective in conserving water and providing moisture directly to the root zone.
*   **Mulching:** Organic mulches help reduce soil temperature, minimize evaporation, and conserve soil moisture, which is crucial during hot periods.
*   **Shade Nets:** Install 30-50% shade nets over the Chilli crop. This significantly reduces direct solar radiation and ambient temperature around the plants, preventing heat stress and sunscald on fruits.
*   **Windbreaks:** Plant taller crops (e.g., maize, bajra) or erect temporary barriers on the western and southern sides of the field to protect the Chilli plants from hot, dry winds.
*   **Foliar Spray:**
    *   **Kaolin clay** (60-80 g/L water) can be sprayed to form a reflective white film on the leaves and fruits. This reflects excess sunlight, reduces leaf temperature, and prevents sunscald.
    *   **Potassium nitrate** (10-20 g/L water, i.e., 1-2% solution) can be sprayed to enhance the plant's ability to cope with heat stress by improving osmoregulation and nutrient uptake.

### Protection from Intense Sunlight

Intense sunlight, especially during fruit development, can lead to sunscald on fruits, reducing their market value.

*   **Shade Nets:** This is the most effective method. Use 30-50% shade nets to reduce the intensity of direct sunlight, protecting fruits from sunscald and reducing overall plant stress.
*   **Planting Density:** Slightly higher plant density can provide some self-shading for fruits, especially in varieties with good canopy cover.
*   **Foliar Spray:**
    *   **Kaolin clay** (60-80 g/L water) spray can reflect excess sunlight and reduce the surface temperature of leaves and fruits, thereby protecting them from sunburn and sunscald.
