As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach for effective and sustainable control of pests in Chillies. This involves a combination of cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods.

Here's how to manage the specified pests:

### Borers and Caterpillars (e.g., Fruit Borer - *Helicoverpa armigera*, Tobacco Caterpillar - *Spodoptera litura*, Armyworm - *Spodoptera exigua*)

These are major lepidopteran pests that cause significant damage by feeding on leaves, flowers, and boring into fruits.

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy affected plant parts and fallen fruits to reduce pest populations.
*   **Hand Picking:** Regularly inspect plants and hand-pick larger caterpillars and egg masses, especially in small plots.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** Plough fields deeply after harvest to expose pupae to predators and sunlight.
*   **Trap Cropping:** Plant marigold as a trap crop around chilli fields to attract fruit borers. Destroy marigold flowers with larvae periodically.
*   **Pheromone Traps:** Install pheromone traps (e.g., for *Helicoverpa armigera* or *Spodoptera litura*) at 5 traps per acre to monitor pest activity and for mass trapping. Change lures every 2-3 weeks.

**2. Biological Control:**
*   **Bio-pesticides:** Apply formulations of **Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)** (e.g., 15000 IU/mg WP) at 500-1000 g per acre in 200-250 L of water, especially against young larvae.
*   **Natural Enemies:** Conserve natural enemies like parasitic wasps (e.g., *Trichogramma* spp.) and predatory birds, spiders, and lacewings.

**3. Chemical Control (Use only when pest incidence crosses Economic Threshold Level):**
Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

*   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** 60 ml per acre (in 200-250 L of water).
*   **Emamectin Benzoate 5% SG:** 80-100 g per acre (in 200-250 L of water).
*   **Flubendiamide 20% WG:** 60 g per acre (in 200-250 L of water).
*   **Indoxacarb 14.5% SC:** 200 ml per acre (in 200-250 L of water).
*   **Spinetoram 11.7% SC:** 150-200 ml per acre (in 200-250 L of water).
*   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** 100-120 ml per acre (in 200-250 L of water) for quick knockdown.

### Diamondback Moth (*Plutella xylostella*)

This is not known to affect Chillies. Diamondback moth is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower, mustard).

### Leaf Folder

Leaf folding in chillies is typically caused by the feeding activity of various lepidopteran larvae (caterpillars) or sometimes by mites or thrips. If it's due to caterpillars, the control measures are similar to those for borers and other caterpillars.

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   **Regular Monitoring:** Inspect plants for folded leaves and the presence of larvae inside.
*   **Hand Picking:** Remove and destroy folded leaves containing larvae.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Keep the field free of weeds, which can act as alternate hosts.

**2. Biological Control:**
*   **Bio-pesticides:** Apply **Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)** (e.g., 15000 IU/mg WP) at 500-1000 g per acre in 200-250 L of water, especially effective against young larvae.

**3. Chemical Control (If caterpillar infestation is significant):**
The same insecticides recommended for borers and caterpillars are effective against leaf-folding caterpillars. Rotate chemicals to manage resistance.

*   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** 60 ml per acre (in 200-250 L of water).
*   **Emamectin Benzoate 5% SG:** 80-100 g per acre (in 200-250 L of water).
*   **Flubendiamide 20% WG:** 60 g per acre (in 200-250 L of water).
*   **Indoxacarb 14.5% SC:** 200 ml per acre (in 200-250 L of water).
*   **Spinetoram 11.7% SC:** 150-200 ml per acre (in 200-250 L of water).

**General Recommendations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label, including dosage, timing, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the underside of leaves.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension officers or HAU experts for specific advice tailored to your field conditions and current pest situation.
