**Regarding "Tinda/Boll dropping":** This is not known to affect Chillies. Tinda is a type of gourd (*Praecitrullus fistulosus*), and boll dropping is a condition primarily associated with cotton (*Gossypium* spp.).

Flower and fruit drop in Chillies (*Capsicum annuum*) is a common physiological issue that can be caused by various environmental stresses, nutritional imbalances, and pest/disease infestations. Effective control involves a combination of good agricultural practices and, if necessary, targeted chemical interventions.

Here's how to control flower and fruit dropping in Chillies:

**1. Cultural and Agronomic Practices:**

*   **Water Management:** Maintain consistent soil moisture. Both waterlogging and drought stress can lead to flower and fruit drop. Irrigate regularly, especially during flowering and fruiting stages, ensuring good drainage.
*   **Temperature Management:** Chillies are sensitive to extreme temperatures. High temperatures (above 35°C) and low temperatures (below 15°C) can cause significant drop.
    *   Choose heat-tolerant varieties suitable for Haryana's climate.
    *   Consider providing temporary shade during peak summer heat for small plots.
*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Ensure a balanced fertilization program based on soil test results. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which promotes vegetative growth at the expense of reproductive growth.
    *   **Boron and Calcium** deficiencies are often linked to flower and fruit drop.
*   **Pest and Disease Control:** Timely management of pests (e.g., thrips, mites, aphids) and diseases (e.g., powdery mildew, anthracnose) that weaken the plant and damage reproductive structures is crucial. A healthy plant is less prone to dropping.
*   **Pollination:** Ensure adequate pollination. While chillies are largely self-pollinating, good air movement and insect activity can improve fruit set.
*   **Planting Density:** Maintain optimal plant spacing to ensure good air circulation and light penetration, reducing plant stress.

**2. Chemical Interventions (CIBRC Approved Technical Names):**

If environmental and cultural factors are managed and dropping persists, specific foliar applications can help:

*   **Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs):**
    *   To reduce flower and fruit drop, apply **Naphthalene Acetic Acid** (NAA) 4.5% SL formulation at a concentration of 0.2 - 0.4 ml per litre of water (equivalent to 10-20 ppm). Apply at the onset of flowering and repeat after 15-20 days if needed.
*   **Micronutrients (if deficiency is suspected based on soil test or visual symptoms):**
    *   **Boron:** Foliar spray of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (20% Boron) at 1-2 grams per litre of water, or **Borax** (10.5% Boron) at 2-3 grams per litre of water. Apply before flowering and repeat at fruit set.
    *   **Calcium:** Foliar spray of **Calcium nitrate** (19% Calcium) at 5-10 grams per litre of water, or **Calcium chloride** (27% Calcium) at 3-5 grams per litre of water. Apply during flowering and early fruit development.

Always read and strictly follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions on the product label. Consult with your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions in Haryana.
