As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice to improve yield, fruit quality, and storage life for Chillies in Haryana:

### Improving Yield

To maximize chilli yield, focus on robust plant health, optimal nutrient management, and effective fruit set.

*   **Variety Selection:** Choose high-yielding, disease-resistant chilli varieties specifically recommended for the agro-climatic conditions of Haryana. Consult HAU recommendations for the latest suitable varieties.
*   **Balanced Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Soil Testing:** Conduct regular soil tests to determine precise nutrient requirements.
    *   **NPK Application:** Apply Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium fertilizers as per soil test recommendations. A general guideline for chillies is 100-120 kg Nitrogen, 60 kg Phosphorus, and 60 kg Potassium per acre, adjusted based on soil fertility. Apply Phosphorus and Potassium as basal dose, and Nitrogen in split doses.
    *   **Micronutrient Foliar Sprays:**
        *   **Zinc Sulphate** (0.5% solution, i.e., 5 g/L water) during pre-flowering and fruit development stages.
        *   **Borax** (0.2% solution, i.e., 2 g/L water) during flowering to improve pollen viability and fruit set.
        *   **Sodium Molybdate** (0.05% solution, i.e., 0.5 g/L water) if molybdenum deficiency is suspected.
*   **Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs):**
    *   To reduce flower drop and improve fruit set: Spray **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA)** at 20-30 ppm (20-30 mg/L water) at the peak flowering stage.
    *   To manage excessive vegetative growth and divert energy towards fruiting: Spray **Mepiquat Chloride** at 100-150 ml/acre (50-75 g a.i./acre) during pre-flowering to early fruiting.
*   **Optimal Irrigation:** Maintain consistent soil moisture, especially during flowering and fruit development stages. Avoid both water stress and waterlogging.
*   **Weed, Pest, and Disease Management:** Implement timely and effective integrated pest and disease management strategies to prevent yield losses.

### Improving Fruit Quality

High-quality chillies are firm, uniformly colored, free from blemishes, and have good pungency.

*   **Calcium and Boron Nutrition:**
    *   **Calcium Nitrate** (0.5-1.0% solution, i.e., 5-10 g/L water) or **Calcium Chloride** (0.5% solution, i.e., 5 g/L water) as foliar sprays at 10-15 day intervals during fruit development. This is crucial to prevent Blossom End Rot and improve fruit firmness.
    *   Ensure adequate Boron supply through soil application or foliar spray of **Borax** (0.2% solution, i.e., 2 g/L water) to improve fruit shape and reduce malformation.
*   **Potassium Management:** Adequate Potassium application (as per soil test) is vital for fruit size, uniform color development, pungency, and overall fruit quality.
*   **Consistent Water Supply:** Uniform irrigation prevents fruit cracking and ensures consistent fruit development.
*   **Timely Harvesting:** Harvest fruits at the appropriate maturity stage (e.g., green for fresh market, fully red for drying/processing) to ensure optimal quality and pungency.

### Improving Storage Life

Extending the storage life of chillies requires careful handling and appropriate post-harvest treatments.

*   **Careful Harvesting and Handling:**
    *   Harvest fruits carefully to avoid any physical damage (bruises, cuts, stem detachment), which can serve as entry points for pathogens.
    *   Harvest during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening).
*   **Pre-cooling:** Rapidly remove field heat from harvested chillies using forced-air cooling or hydro-cooling immediately after harvest. This slows down respiration and ripening processes.
*   **Post-harvest Treatments:**
    *   **Fungicidal Dip:** Dip harvested chillies in a solution of a CIBRC approved fungicide to control post-harvest rots.
        *   **Carbendazim** 0.05% (0.5 g/L water) for 5-10 minutes.
        *   **Thiophanate-methyl** 0.05% (0.5 g/L water) for 5-10 minutes.
        *   **Prochloraz** 0.025% (0.25 ml/L of 45% EC formulation) for 5-10 minutes.
        *   Ensure proper air-drying of fruits after dipping before packing.
    *   **Calcium Dip:** Dipping in 2-4% **Calcium Chloride** solution for 5-10 minutes can further improve fruit firmness and reduce physiological disorders during storage.
*   **Optimal Storage Conditions:**
    *   Store chillies at a temperature of 7-10°C with a high relative humidity of 90-95%. These conditions significantly reduce respiration rate, moisture loss, and microbial growth.
*   **Appropriate Packaging:** Use well-ventilated crates or baskets that allow for adequate air circulation. Avoid over-packing, which can lead to heat build-up and condensation, promoting spoilage.
