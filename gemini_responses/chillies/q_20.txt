Namaste, Kisan Bhaiyon! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the critical role micronutrients play in the healthy growth and yield of Chillies. Addressing these deficiencies scientifically is key to a successful harvest.

**General Recommendations for Addressing Micronutrient Deficiencies:**

1.  **Soil Testing is Paramount:** Before applying any micronutrient, it is highly recommended to conduct a soil test from a reputable lab (like HAU's soil testing lab). This will accurately identify the deficient nutrients and their levels, preventing unnecessary applications and potential toxicities.
2.  **Integrated Nutrient Management:** Combine chemical applications with good agricultural practices, including the incorporation of organic matter (Farm Yard Manure, compost) which helps in improving micronutrient availability.
3.  **Application Methods:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Provides a sustained supply of nutrients and is suitable for correcting severe deficiencies or for prophylactic application based on soil test results.
    *   **Foliar Application:** Offers a quicker response, especially for immediate correction of visible deficiency symptoms, as nutrients are absorbed directly by the leaves. It is also efficient for nutrients like Iron and Manganese, which can be less available in alkaline soils.
4.  **Timing of Application:** Apply micronutrients at critical growth stages (e.g., vegetative growth, pre-flowering, fruit set) for maximum benefit.
5.  **Water Quality:** Always use clean water for foliar sprays.
6.  **Adjuvants:** For foliar sprays, consider adding a non-ionic spreader/sticker at recommended rates to improve coverage and absorption.
7.  **Spray Timing:** Spray during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to avoid leaf scorching and maximize absorption.
8.  **Compatibility:** Do not mix different micronutrients or pesticides without checking their compatibility.

Here's how to address specific micronutrient deficiencies in Chillies:

---

### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted plant growth, small and narrow leaves (often called "little leaf"), interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, and sometimes bronzing of older leaves. Poor fruit set and development.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   Apply **Zinc sulphate monohydrate** (33% Zn) at 5-10 kg/acre, or **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (21% Zn) at 10-20 kg/acre, mixed with soil before planting or as a basal application.
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (21% Zn) at a concentration of 0.2-0.5% (2-5 g/L of water).
        *   Alternatively, use **Chelated Zinc** (e.g., Zn-EDTA 12% Zn) at 0.5-1.0 g/L of water.
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 15-day intervals, starting 30-45 days after transplanting or upon appearance of symptoms.

### 2. Iron (Fe) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Pronounced interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on young leaves, with veins remaining green. In severe cases, the entire leaf may turn pale yellow or even white, leading to stunted growth.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   Apply **Ferrous sulphate** (19% Fe) at 10-20 kg/acre, especially in soils with pH below 7.0.
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray **Ferrous sulphate** (19% Fe) at a concentration of 0.5-1.0% (5-10 g/L of water).
        *   Alternatively, use **Chelated Iron** (e.g., Fe-EDTA 6% Fe) at 0.5-1.0 g/L of water, which is more effective in alkaline soils.
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, particularly when symptoms appear.

### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, thickening and brittleness of young leaves, cracking of stems and fruit walls, poor pollen viability leading to reduced fruit set, and malformed or corky fruits. Growing points may die back.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   Apply **Borax** (10.5% B) at 1-2 kg/acre, or **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (20% B) at 0.5-1 kg/acre, mixed with soil before planting. *Caution: Boron can be toxic if over-applied; adhere strictly to recommended rates.*
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray **Borax** (10.5% B) at a concentration of 0.1-0.2% (1-2 g/L of water).
        *   Alternatively, use **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (20% B) at 0.5-1.0 g/L of water.
        *   Apply 1-2 sprays at pre-flowering and fruit development stages.

### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Blossom End Rot (BER) in fruits (a common and significant problem in Chillies, appearing as a water-soaked spot at the blossom end of the fruit, which later turns dark and leathery), stunted growth, distorted new leaves, and marginal necrosis (browning) of young leaves.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   Apply **Gypsum** (Calcium sulphate) at 200-400 kg/acre as a soil amendment, especially in sodic soils, to improve calcium availability.
        *   For direct deficiency correction, **Calcium nitrate** (15.5% N, 19% Ca) can be applied through fertigation at 10-20 kg/acre.
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray **Calcium chloride** (77% CaCl2) at a concentration of 0.5-1.0% (5-10 g/L of water).
        *   Alternatively, use **Calcium nitrate** (15.5% N, 19% Ca) at 0.5-1.0% (5-10 g/L of water).
        *   Begin spraying at fruit set and continue during fruit development, with 2-3 sprays at 7-10 day intervals, especially crucial for preventing BER.

### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, where the veins remain green but the tissue between them turns yellow, often progressing to reddish or purplish discoloration. Leaves may become brittle and drop prematurely.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   Apply **Magnesium sulphate** (9.6% Mg) at 10-20 kg/acre as a basal application or side-dressing.
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray **Magnesium sulphate** (9.6% Mg) at a concentration of 0.5-1.0% (5-10 g/L of water).
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 15-day intervals, particularly when symptoms appear on older leaves.

### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, similar to iron deficiency but often with a finer network of green veins. Leaves may appear mottled or speckled, and growth can be stunted.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   Apply **Manganese sulphate** (30.5% Mn) at 5-10 kg/acre, especially in soils with pH below 7.0.
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray **Manganese sulphate** (30.5% Mn) at a concentration of 0.2-0.5% (2-5 g/L of water).
        *   Alternatively, use **Chelated Manganese** (e.g., Mn-EDTA 12% Mn) at 0.5-1.0 g/L of water.
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 15-day intervals, starting when symptoms are observed.
