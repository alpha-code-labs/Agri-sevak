Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in Chillies in Haryana.

**Control of Beetles and Weevils in Chillies:**

Beetles (e.g., Flea beetles, Blister beetles) and Weevils can cause significant damage to chilli plants by feeding on leaves, stems, flowers, and fruits. Flea beetles create small 'shot-holes' in leaves, while blister beetles can defoliate plants and damage flowers. Weevils can damage roots, stems, or fruits depending on the species.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Maintain field sanitation by removing weeds and crop residues, which can harbor pests.
    *   Practice crop rotation to break the pest life cycle.
    *   Monitor plants regularly for early signs of infestation.
    *   Use yellow sticky traps for monitoring adult beetles.

*   **Chemical Control (Use only CIBRC approved technical chemicals):**
    When pest incidence crosses the economic threshold level, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always follow label instructions for dosage and safety.

    *   For general control of chewing insects like beetles and weevils:
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC**: Apply at 0.5 ml per liter of water (or 100-125 ml per acre).
        *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG**: Apply at 0.2 g per liter of water (or 80-100 g per acre). This is particularly effective against flea beetles due to its systemic action.
        *   **Spinosad 45% SC**: Apply at 0.25 ml per liter of water (or 60-75 ml per acre). This offers a different mode of action and is effective against a range of chewing insects.

**Regarding Sawflies in Chillies:**

This is not known to affect Chillies as a significant pest in Haryana. Sawflies are primarily pests of other crops like mustard, roses, or fruit trees, and are not typically associated with chilli damage.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always wear protective clothing while handling and spraying pesticides.
*   Adhere to the pre-harvest interval (PHI) mentioned on the pesticide label.
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations based on the exact pest species and severity of infestation in your field.
