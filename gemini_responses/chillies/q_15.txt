As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Chillies in Haryana:

**1. Grasshopper:**
Grasshoppers are polyphagous pests that can cause significant damage to chilli plants by feeding on leaves, young shoots, and sometimes even fruits, leading to defoliation and reduced yield.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Maintain good field sanitation by regularly removing weeds and crop residues, which can serve as breeding sites and shelter for grasshoppers.
    *   Deep ploughing of fields after harvest can expose grasshopper eggs to predators and adverse weather conditions, reducing subsequent populations.
*   **Chemical Control (if infestation is severe):**
    *   **Malathion 50 EC** at 2.0-3.0 ml/L of water (or 1.0-1.5 L/acre).
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5 EC** at 0.4-0.5 ml/L of water (or 200-250 ml/acre).

**2. Painted bug:**
This is not known to affect Chillies. It is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops like mustard, cabbage, and cauliflower.

**3. Red cotton bug:**
This is not known to affect Chillies. It is primarily a pest of cotton and other malvaceous crops, feeding on developing seeds.

**4. Black ants:**
Black ants are generally not direct pests that feed on chilli plants. However, they can be problematic indirectly by protecting sap-sucking insects (such as aphids, mealybugs, and whiteflies) from their natural enemies. Ants are attracted to the honeydew secreted by these pests and, in return, guard them. If ants are present in large numbers and are associated with other sap-sucking pests, managing the primary sap-sucking pest will often reduce ant populations.

*   **Management (if ants are directly problematic, e.g., nesting at the base of plants, or protecting other pests):**
    *   Apply **Chlorpyrifos 20 EC** at 2.5 ml/L of water as a drench around the base of the plants or directly on ant trails and nests.
    *   Alternatively, use commercially available ant baits containing active ingredients like **Fipronil** or **Hydramethylnon**, placed strategically away from the chilli plants, following the product label instructions.
