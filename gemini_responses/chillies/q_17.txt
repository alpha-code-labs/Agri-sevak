As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following doses of organic manures for Chillies, based on scientific verification for Haryana conditions:

*   **Farm Yard Manure (FYM):**
    *   **Dose:** 8-10 tonnes per acre.
    *   **Application:** Apply well-decomposed FYM during land preparation, at least 2-3 weeks before transplanting, and thoroughly incorporate it into the soil. This improves soil structure, water retention, and provides a slow release of essential nutrients.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 tonnes per acre.
    *   **Application:** Can be applied during land preparation along with FYM, or as a top dressing around the plants during early growth stages (e.g., 30-45 days after transplanting). Vermicompost is richer in nutrients and microbial activity than FYM.

*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract based product):**
    *   **Granular Form (e.g., Sagarika G):**
        *   **Dose:** 8-10 kg per acre.
        *   **Application:** Apply as a basal dose during transplanting or as a top dressing during the vegetative growth phase (e.g., 30-45 days after transplanting).
    *   **Liquid Form (e.g., Sagarika Z):**
        *   **Dose:** 250-500 ml per acre.
        *   **Application:** Dilute in water and apply as a foliar spray during critical growth stages such as vegetative growth, pre-flowering, and fruit set. Typically, 2-3 sprays are recommended at 15-20 day intervals. This acts as a plant growth stimulant, enhancing nutrient uptake and stress tolerance.
