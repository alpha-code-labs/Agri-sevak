As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling physical damage in Chillies in Haryana:

Physical damage in Chillies, such as fruit bursting, leaf burning/melting, and hardness in fruit, is primarily a result of environmental stresses, improper cultural practices, and sometimes nutritional imbalances. Effective control involves a combination of good agricultural practices and targeted nutritional management.

### 1. Control of Fruit Bursting (Cracking)

Fruit bursting in Chillies is typically caused by sudden fluctuations in soil moisture, leading to rapid water uptake by the fruit after a dry period, which the fruit skin cannot accommodate. Calcium deficiency can also exacerbate this condition.

*   **Consistent Irrigation:** Maintain uniform soil moisture throughout the fruit development stage. Avoid extremes of drought followed by heavy irrigation or rainfall. Drip irrigation is highly recommended for precise water management.
*   **Mulching:** Apply organic mulch (e.g., straw, crop residues) around the plants to conserve soil moisture, regulate soil temperature, and reduce evaporation, thereby minimizing moisture fluctuations.
*   **Nutritional Management (Calcium):** Ensure adequate calcium availability, as calcium strengthens cell walls and improves skin elasticity.
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray with **Calcium Chloride** at 5-10 g/L of water, starting from fruit set and repeating every 10-15 days.
    *   **Soil Application:** Incorporate **Calcium Nitrate** as part of your fertigation schedule or as a basal application, typically 10-20 kg/acre depending on soil test results and crop stage.

### 2. Control of Leaf Burning/Melting

Leaf burning (often sunscald or heat stress) and melting (severe tissue collapse due to extreme heat or chemical phytotoxicity) are common under high temperatures, intense solar radiation, and water stress.

*   **Adequate and Timely Irrigation:** Ensure plants receive sufficient water, especially during hot periods, to prevent water stress which makes leaves more susceptible to burning. Irrigate in the early morning or late evening.
*   **Shade Management:** For high-value crops or during peak summer months (May-June in Haryana), consider using 30-50% shade nets over the crop, especially for young plants, to reduce direct solar radiation and temperature.
*   **Proper Plant Spacing:** Ensure optimal plant spacing to allow for good air circulation, which helps in cooling the canopy and reducing humidity around the leaves.
*   **Avoid Phytotoxicity:**
    *   Always use recommended dosages of pesticides and fertilizers.
    *   Avoid spraying during the hottest part of the day or when plants are under water stress.
    *   Ensure proper mixing and application techniques.
*   **Nutritional Management (Potassium and Silicon):**
    *   **Potassium:** Adequate potassium improves plant tolerance to heat and drought stress. Apply **Potassium Sulphate** as a foliar spray at 1-2% solution (10-20 g/L water) or through soil application (e.g., 20-30 kg/acre depending on soil test and crop stage).
    *   **Silicon:** Silicon helps strengthen cell walls and provides a protective layer, enhancing stress tolerance. Apply **Potassium Silicate** as a foliar spray at 1-2 ml/L of water.

### 3. Control of Hardness in Fruit

Hardness or toughness in Chilli fruits is often associated with water stress, high temperatures, nutrient imbalances (especially potassium and calcium), and harvesting at an over-mature stage.

*   **Consistent Water Supply:** Maintain consistent soil moisture levels throughout the fruit development period. Water stress can lead to smaller, harder fruits.
*   **Timely Harvesting:** Harvest fruits at their optimal maturity stage. Over-mature fruits tend to become harder and lose quality.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure a balanced supply of essential nutrients, particularly potassium and calcium, which are crucial for fruit development and quality.
    *   **Potassium:** Apply **Potassium Sulphate** as a foliar spray at 1-2% solution (10-20 g/L water) or through soil application (e.g., 20-30 kg/acre depending on soil test and crop stage) to improve fruit size, quality, and reduce hardness.
    *   **Calcium:** Ensure adequate calcium as mentioned under fruit bursting, using **Calcium Nitrate** for soil application or **Calcium Chloride** for foliar sprays.
*   **Variety Selection:** Choose Chilli varieties known for good fruit quality and tenderness, suitable for the local agro-climatic conditions of Haryana.

By implementing these integrated management strategies, Chilli growers can significantly reduce physical damage and improve the overall quality and yield of their crop. Regular monitoring of the crop and soil conditions is key to timely intervention.
