As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified recommendations for the use of growth regulators and micronutrients in Chillies in Haryana:

It is crucial to understand the specific role and appropriate application of each compound to ensure optimal plant health and yield without causing adverse effects.

*   **Ethephon (Ethrel)**
    **Ethephon** is a plant growth regulator used primarily for promoting fruit ripening and uniform maturity in Chillies.
    *   **Recommended Dose:** Apply **Ethephon** (e.g., 39% SL formulation) at a concentration of 250-500 ppm (parts per million). This translates to approximately 0.64 - 1.28 ml of 39% Ethephon SL product per litre of water.
    *   **Application Timing:** Apply when the first flush of fruits has reached the red ripe stage, or when a significant portion of fruits are mature green to turning red. This helps in achieving uniform ripening for a concentrated harvest.
    *   **Caution:** Do not exceed the recommended dose, as higher concentrations can lead to defoliation or premature fruit drop.

*   **2,4-D**
    This is not known to be recommended as a growth regulator for Chillies in general agricultural practice. **2,4-D** is primarily a selective herbicide, and even at very low concentrations, it can cause severe phytotoxicity, malformations, and yield reduction in Chillies. Its use as a growth regulator in Chillies is not advised.

*   **Boron**
    **Boron** is an essential micronutrient, not a hormone, but it plays a critical role in pollen germination, fruit set, cell wall formation, and overall plant development. Deficiency can lead to poor fruit set and deformed fruits.
    *   **Recommended Dose:** For foliar application, use a water-soluble **Boron** fertilizer (e.g., Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate, 20% Boron) at a concentration of 1.0-1.5 g per litre of water.
    *   **Application Timing:** Apply the first spray at the pre-flowering or early flowering stage, and a second spray during the fruit setting stage, if deficiency symptoms are observed or anticipated.
    *   **Caution:** Ensure even coverage. Excessive Boron can be toxic to plants, so adhere strictly to the recommended dose.
