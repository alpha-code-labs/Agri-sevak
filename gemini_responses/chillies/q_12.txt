Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I will provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling Scale insects and Mealybugs in Chillies. Both these pests are sap-suckers and can cause significant damage if not managed properly. An Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is always recommended for sustainable control.

**General Management Principles for Both Pests:**

1.  **Regular Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your chilli plants, especially the undersides of leaves, stems, and fruit, for early signs of infestation.
2.  **Pruning and Sanitation:** Remove and destroy heavily infested plant parts (leaves, stems, fruits) to reduce pest population. Keep the field free of weeds, which can act as alternate hosts.
3.  **Encourage Natural Enemies:** Protect and encourage beneficial insects like ladybird beetles, lacewings, and parasitic wasps, which naturally prey on scale insects and mealybugs. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficials.
4.  **Proper Nutrition:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, as it can lead to lush growth that is more attractive to sucking pests.

**Specific Control Measures:**

### **For Scale Insects in Chillies:**

When the infestation is severe and cultural/biological methods are insufficient, chemical intervention may be necessary. Ensure thorough spray coverage, as scales are often protected by their waxy covering.

*   **Systemic Insecticides:**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at 0.5 ml per litre of water (or 125 ml per acre).
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at 0.2 g per litre of water (or 80 g per acre).
    *   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:** Apply at 0.75 ml per litre of water (or 300 ml per acre).
*   **Insect Growth Regulators (IGR):**
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at 1.25 ml per litre of water (or 500 ml per acre). This is particularly effective against the nymphal stages.
*   **Horticultural Oils:**
    *   **Mineral oil (Horticultural grade):** Apply at 10-20 ml per litre of water. This works by suffocating the scales, especially effective on younger stages. Ensure good coverage.

### **For Mealybugs in Chillies:**

Mealybugs are often found in protected areas like leaf axils and fruit calyx, making thorough spray coverage essential.

*   **Systemic Insecticides:**
    *   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:** Apply at 0.75 ml per litre of water (or 300 ml per acre). This is highly effective due to its dual systemic action.
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at 1.25 ml per litre of water (or 500 ml per acre). This IGR is very effective against mealybug nymphs.
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at 0.5 ml per litre of water (or 125 ml per acre).
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at 0.2 g per litre of water (or 80 g per acre).
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply at 0.2 g per litre of water (or 80 g per acre).
*   **Horticultural Oils:**
    *   **Mineral oil (Horticultural grade):** Apply at 10-20 ml per litre of water. This helps in suffocating the mealybugs and removing sooty mold.

**Important Precautions:**

*   **Rotate Chemicals:** To prevent the development of pesticide resistance, rotate insecticides with different modes of action.
*   **Spray Timing:** Spray during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   **Safety First:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) like gloves, mask, and protective clothing while handling and spraying chemicals.
*   **Read Label:** Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label regarding dosage, application method, and Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) before use.
*   **Consult Experts:** For severe or persistent infestations, consult your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for further guidance.
