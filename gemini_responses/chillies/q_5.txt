As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned conditions in Chillies in Haryana:

*   **Scab:**
    This is not known to affect Chillies as a distinct disease. Symptoms resembling scab are typically associated with other conditions like bacterial spot or anthracnose.

*   **Canker:**
    Bacterial Canker (caused by *Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis*) can affect chillies, though it is more commonly associated with tomatoes. Control measures focus on prevention and management of bacterial spread.

    **Control Measures for Bacterial Canker:**
    *   **Cultural Practices:**
        *   Use certified disease-free seeds or seedlings.
        *   Practice strict crop rotation, avoiding solanaceous crops for at least 3 years in affected fields.
        *   Remove and destroy all infected plant debris promptly.
        *   Avoid overhead irrigation, which can spread bacteria.
        *   Sanitize all tools and equipment used in the field.
        *   Avoid working in fields when plants are wet.
    *   **Chemical Control (as preventative or early stage treatment):**
        *   **Copper oxychloride** (50% WP) at 2.5-3 g/L of water.
        *   **Streptomycin sulphate + Tetracycline hydrochloride** (90:10 SP) at 0.5-1 g/L of water.
        *   **Kasugamycin** (3% SL) at 2-2.5 ml/L of water.

*   **Gummosis:**
    This is not known to affect Chillies. Gummosis is primarily a symptom observed in woody perennial plants, particularly fruit trees, characterized by the exudation of gum. Chillies are herbaceous plants and do not exhibit gummosis.

*   **Lichen:**
    This is not known to affect Chillies. Lichens are symbiotic organisms that grow on surfaces like bark, rocks, or soil. They are epiphytes and do not parasitize or cause disease in the host plant. Their presence on chilli plants, if observed, would indicate an old, slow-growing plant in a humid environment, but they do not cause any harm.
