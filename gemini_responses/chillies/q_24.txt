Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide you with the ideal recommendations for chilli transplantation in Haryana.

**Ideal Transplantation Time, Distance, and Process for Chillies:**

**1. Ideal Transplantation Time:**
The ideal time for transplanting chilli seedlings in Haryana depends on the cropping season:

*   **Kharif (Monsoon) Season:**
    *   Nursery Sowing: May - June
    *   Transplanting: June - July (with the onset of monsoon or availability of irrigation)
*   **Rabi (Winter) Season:**
    *   Nursery Sowing: September - October
    *   Transplanting: October - November
*   **Spring/Summer Season (for specific regions/varieties):**
    *   Nursery Sowing: January - February
    *   Transplanting: February - March

*   **Seedling Age:** Seedlings should be 4-6 weeks old, healthy, sturdy, and about 10-15 cm tall with 4-5 true leaves.

**2. Ideal Transplantation Distance (Spacing):**
Proper spacing is crucial for optimal plant growth, air circulation, light penetration, and yield.

*   **Row-to-Row Distance:** 60 - 75 cm
*   **Plant-to-Plant Distance:** 45 - 60 cm

*   **Note:** This spacing can be adjusted slightly based on the specific variety (bushy vs. erect), soil fertility, and irrigation method (e.g., slightly wider for very vigorous varieties or closer for compact ones).

**3. Ideal Transplantation Process:**

*   **A. Seedling Preparation (Hardening):**
    *   About 7-10 days before transplanting, gradually expose the seedlings to outdoor conditions (reduced watering, increased sunlight, and wind) to acclimatize them to the field environment. This process, known as 'hardening,' reduces transplant shock.
    *   Water the nursery bed thoroughly a few hours before uprooting to ensure minimal root damage.

*   **B. Field Preparation:**
    *   Prepare the main field thoroughly by ploughing and harrowing to achieve a fine tilth.
    *   Incorporate 10-15 tonnes of well-decomposed Farmyard Manure (FYM) or compost per acre during land preparation.
    *   Apply a basal dose of fertilizers (e.g., 25 kg Nitrogen, 25 kg Phosphorus, 25 kg Potassium per acre) as per soil test recommendations, and mix it well into the soil.
    *   Prepare ridges and furrows or flat beds as per your irrigation method.

*   **C. Transplanting Technique:**
    *   Transplant seedlings preferably in the late afternoon or on a cloudy day to minimize stress from direct sunlight.
    *   Make holes at the recommended spacing (60-75 cm between rows and 45-60 cm between plants).
    *   Carefully lift the seedlings from the nursery bed or trays, ensuring that the root ball remains intact as much as possible.
    *   Plant each seedling into the prepared hole at the same depth it was in the nursery.
    *   Gently firm the soil around the base of each seedling to ensure good root-to-soil contact and remove air pockets.

*   **D. Post-Transplantation Care:**
    *   Immediately after transplanting, provide a light irrigation to settle the soil around the roots and provide initial moisture.
    *   Monitor the field closely for 7-10 days. If any seedlings die, perform 'gap filling' by replacing them with healthy spare seedlings.
    *   Ensure proper drainage to avoid waterlogging, which can be detrimental to young chilli plants.
    *   Continue with regular irrigation and nutrient management as per the crop's requirements.

Following these guidelines will help ensure a successful establishment of your chilli crop and contribute to a healthy yield.
