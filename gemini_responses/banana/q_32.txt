Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

The symptom of "drying up" – affecting branches (pseudostem), leaves, fruits, and flowers – in banana plants is a general indication of underlying stress, which can be due to various biotic (diseases, pests) or abiotic (environmental, nutritional) factors. A precise diagnosis is crucial for effective management. As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I advise you to carefully observe the specific patterns and associated symptoms to identify the root cause.

Here's a comprehensive approach to address "Drying up" in Banana:

---

### I. Abiotic Factors (Environmental and Nutritional Stress)

These are often the first to consider as they can mimic disease symptoms.

1.  **Water Stress:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Leaves turn yellow, then brown and dry, starting from the margins or tips. Pseudostem may shrivel. Fruits may be small and shrivelled.
    *   **Causes:**
        *   **Insufficient Water (Drought):** Prolonged dry spells, inadequate irrigation.
        *   **Excess Water (Waterlogging):** Leads to root rot, impairing water and nutrient uptake, causing wilting and drying of aerial parts.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Ensure consistent and adequate irrigation, especially during dry periods. Drip irrigation is highly recommended for efficient water use.
        *   Improve soil drainage in waterlogged areas by creating raised beds or improving field channels.

2.  **Nutrient Deficiencies:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Specific patterns of leaf yellowing and drying.
        *   **Potassium (K) Deficiency:** Very common. Older leaves show yellowing and scorching (drying) along the margins, progressing inwards. Leaves may become brittle.
        *   **Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency:** Yellowing between veins (interveinal chlorosis) on older leaves, eventually leading to necrosis and drying.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Conduct a soil test to determine nutrient status.
        *   Apply balanced fertilizers based on soil test recommendations.
        *   For Potassium deficiency, apply **Muriate of Potash** (Potassium chloride) or **Sulphate of Potash** (Potassium sulphate) at 100-200 kg/acre in split doses, or as recommended by soil test.
        *   For Magnesium deficiency, apply Magnesium sulphate (Epsom salt) as a foliar spray (20 g/L water) or soil application.

3.  **Heat Stress/Sun Scorch:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Leaves develop bleached or brown patches, especially on exposed areas, leading to drying. Fruits can also get sunburnt and shrivel.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Maintain adequate soil moisture through irrigation.
        *   Use mulching around the base of plants to keep soil cool and conserve moisture.

4.  **Salinity/Alkalinity:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Leaf margins turn yellow and then brown/dry (scorching), stunted growth.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Improve soil quality through gypsum application (for sodic soils) and regular leaching with good quality water.
        *   Select banana varieties tolerant to local soil conditions.

### II. Biotic Factors (Diseases and Pests)

These require specific identification and targeted interventions.

#### A. Fungal Diseases:

1.  **Fusarium Wilt (Panama Disease) - *Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense***
    *   **Symptoms:** Yellowing and wilting of older leaves, starting from the margins and progressing towards the midrib. Leaves eventually dry up and collapse around the pseudostem. Splitting of the pseudostem base. Cutting the pseudostem or rhizome reveals reddish-brown vascular discoloration.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **No chemical cure for infected plants.**
        *   Use disease-free planting material (tissue culture plants).
        *   Plant resistant or tolerant varieties (e.g., Cavendish group has some resistance to Race 1, but susceptible to Tropical Race 4).
        *   Strict sanitation: Remove and destroy infected plants immediately. Disinfect tools.
        *   Crop rotation with non-host crops.
        *   Soil solarization can reduce pathogen load.

2.  **Sigatoka Leaf Spot (Yellow Sigatoka - *Mycosphaerella musicola* / Black Sigatoka - *Mycosphaerella fijiensis*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Oval to elongated spots on leaves, initially yellow (Yellow Sigatoka) or dark brown/black (Black Sigatoka), which enlarge and coalesce, leading to extensive drying and death of leaf tissue. Severe infection causes premature drying of leaves, reducing photosynthetic area and affecting fruit development.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Remove and destroy severely infected leaves.
        *   Maintain proper plant spacing for good air circulation.
        *   **Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
            *   **Propiconazole** (0.5 ml/L water)
            *   **Azoxystrobin** (0.5-1 ml/L water)
            *   **Difenoconazole** (0.5 ml/L water)
            *   **Mancozeb** (2 g/L water) - often used in rotation or as a protectant.
        *   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

3.  **Anthracnose - *Colletotrichum musae***
    *   **Symptoms:** Primarily affects fruits, causing dark, sunken spots that enlarge and coalesce, leading to fruit rot and drying. Can also affect flowers, causing them to dry and drop prematurely.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Maintain field sanitation.
        *   Harvest fruits carefully to avoid injury.
        *   Post-harvest dipping in fungicides (if allowed for export/storage).
        *   **Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
            *   **Carbendazim** (1 g/L water)
            *   **Mancozeb** (2 g/L water)
        *   Apply during flowering and fruit development stages if disease pressure is high.

#### B. Bacterial Diseases:

1.  **Bacterial Wilt (Moko Disease - *Ralstonia solanacearum* / Xanthomonas Wilt - *Xanthomonas campestris pv. musacearum*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Rapid and sudden wilting and yellowing of leaves, which then dry up. Vascular discoloration (yellow to brown) in the pseudostem and rhizome. Bacterial ooze may be visible when infected parts are cut. Fruits may ripen prematurely and show internal rot.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Extremely serious and highly contagious.**
        *   **No chemical cure.**
        *   Immediate eradication of infected plants (uproot and destroy).
        *   Strict sanitation: Disinfect all tools (knives, sickles) with bleach (10% sodium hypochlorite solution) or by flaming after each plant.
        *   Use disease-free planting material.
        *   Avoid sharing tools or machinery between infected and healthy fields.
        *   Control insect vectors (e.g., bees visiting male buds).

#### C. Viral Diseases:

1.  **Banana Bunchy Top Virus (BBTV)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, dark green streaks on petioles and midribs, leaves become erect, brittle, and "bunchy" at the top. Infected plants fail to produce normal bunches, and eventually, the entire plant may dry up and die prematurely.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **No chemical cure for the virus.**
        *   Use virus-free planting material (tissue culture plants).
        *   Eradicate infected plants immediately (uproot and destroy).
        *   Control the aphid vector (*Pentalonia nigronervosa*) that transmits the virus.
        *   **Chemical Control (Insecticides for Aphids):**
            *   **Imidacloprid** (0.3-0.5 ml/L water)
            *   **Thiamethoxam** (0.2-0.4 g/L water)
        *   Apply systemic insecticides to control aphids, especially in new plantings and surrounding areas.

#### D. Pests:

1.  **Nematodes (e.g., Root-knot Nematodes - *Meloidogyne spp.*, Burrowing Nematodes - *Radopholus similis*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Damage to roots impairs water and nutrient uptake, leading to stunted growth, yellowing, wilting, and premature drying of leaves. Roots may show galls (root-knot) or reddish-brown lesions (burrowing).
    *   **Management:**
        *   Use nematode-free planting material.
        *   Crop rotation with non-host crops (e.g., marigold, paddy).
        *   Soil solarization.
        *   Application of organic amendments (e.g., neem cake) to improve soil health and suppress nematodes.
        *   **Chemical Control (Nematicides - use with caution and as per label):**
            *   **Fluopyram** (1.5-2 ml/L water as drench or soil application, refer to product label for specific banana recommendations).

2.  **Banana Weevil Borer (*Cosmopolites sordidus*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Larvae tunnel into the pseudostem and rhizome, weakening the plant, causing yellowing, wilting, and eventual drying of leaves and pseudostem. Plants may topple easily.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Field sanitation: Remove and destroy old pseudostems and plant debris.
        *   Use clean, borer-free planting material.
        *   Trapping weevils using pseudostem traps.
        *   **Chemical Control (Insecticides):**
            *   **Fipronil** (1-1.5 ml/L water as a drench around the pseudostem base).
            *   **Chlorpyrifos** (2.5 ml/L water as a drench, check CIBRC approval for banana stem borer in Haryana).

### III. Diagnostic Steps for the Farmer:

1.  **Observe the Pattern:** Is it a single plant, a few plants, or widespread in the field? This helps differentiate localized issues from systemic problems.
2.  **Examine the Entire Plant:**
    *   **Leaves:** Look for specific spots, streaks, yellowing patterns, or insect presence.
    *   **Pseudostem:** Check for splitting, discoloration, holes (borers), or oozing.
    *   **Roots:** Carefully dig around the base to inspect roots for rot, galls, or lesions.
3.  **Cut the Pseudostem/Rhizome:** Make a cross-section cut to check for vascular discoloration (reddish-brown, yellow, or black streaks) or bacterial ooze.
4.  **Consider Environmental Factors:** Recall recent weather conditions (drought, heavy rains, heat waves) and your irrigation practices.
5.  **Soil Testing:** A comprehensive soil test can reveal nutrient deficiencies or imbalances.

### IV. General Management Principles:

*   **Integrated Pest and Disease Management (IPDM):** Combine cultural, biological, and chemical methods for sustainable control.
*   **Sanitation:** Always remove and destroy infected plant parts, weeds, and plant debris. Disinfect tools.
*   **Healthy Planting Material:** Always use disease-free, tissue-culture raised plants from certified nurseries.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure adequate and balanced supply of macro and micronutrients based on soil test.
*   **Proper Irrigation:** Avoid both water stress and waterlogging.
*   **Regular Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your plants for early signs of stress, disease, or pest infestation.
