Dear farmer,

The application of organic manures is fundamental for enhancing soil fertility, improving soil structure, and providing a steady supply of nutrients essential for healthy and productive banana cultivation in Haryana. Based on scientific recommendations, here are the advised doses:

*   **Farm Yard Manure (FYM):** Apply 10-15 kg of well-decomposed **FYM** per plant annually. This should ideally be incorporated into the soil during land preparation or applied in two split doses around the plant base during the growing season. This translates to approximately 25-37.5 tonnes per acre, assuming a planting density of 2500 plants/acre.
*   **Vermicompost:** Apply 5-7 kg of **Vermicompost** per plant annually. This can be applied at the time of planting and subsequently in split doses around the plant. This is equivalent to roughly 12.5-17.5 tonnes per acre.
*   **Sagarika (IFFCO):** This is a seaweed extract-based bio-stimulant and should be used as a supplement to bulk organic manures, not as a replacement.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Mix 2-4 ml of **Sagarika** per litre of water and spray thoroughly on the foliage. Apply at critical growth stages, such as 45, 90, and 135 days after planting, or during pre-flowering and fruit development stages.
    *   **Soil Drench/Drip Application:** Apply 500 ml to 1 litre of **Sagarika** per acre, diluted in sufficient water, during early growth stages to stimulate root development and nutrient uptake.

It is highly recommended to conduct a soil test to determine the specific nutrient status of your field. This will allow for a more precise and efficient integrated nutrient management plan, combining organic manures with appropriate chemical fertilizers for optimal banana yield and quality.
