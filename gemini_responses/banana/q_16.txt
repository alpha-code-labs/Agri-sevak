As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified fertilizer doses for Banana (Musa paradisiaca) cultivation in Haryana. These recommendations are general and should ideally be fine-tuned based on soil test reports, specific cultivar, and plant age.

**General Principles for Banana Fertilization:**

*   **Soil Testing:** A comprehensive soil test before planting and periodically during cultivation is crucial to determine the exact nutrient status of your field and tailor fertilizer applications.
*   **Split Application:** Banana is a heavy feeder with a long growth cycle. Nitrogen and Potassium should be applied in multiple splits to ensure continuous nutrient availability and minimize losses.
*   **Micronutrients:** While the focus is on macro-nutrients, micronutrients like Zinc, Boron, Manganese, and Iron are also vital. Their application should be based on soil test results or observed deficiency symptoms.
*   **Irrigation:** Always ensure adequate irrigation after fertilizer application to facilitate nutrient dissolution and uptake by the roots, and to prevent root burn.

**Recommended Fertilizer Doses (per plant per year):**

**1. Nitrogen (N):**
*   **Urea:** 300-400 g per plant per year.
    *   Apply in 5-6 equal splits, starting from 2 months after planting, at monthly intervals.
*   **Nano-Urea:** Can be used as a supplementary foliar application to enhance nitrogen use efficiency and potentially reduce granular urea requirement by 25-50%.
    *   Mix 2-4 ml of **Nano-Urea** per litre of water and spray at critical growth stages (e.g., active vegetative growth, pre-flowering, fruit development).

**2. Phosphorus (P2O5):**
*   **DAP (Di-ammonium Phosphate):** 150-200 g per plant per year.
    *   Apply in 2-3 splits. A major portion (e.g., 50-70%) can be applied at planting or within the first 2-3 months, with subsequent applications during active growth.
*   **SSP (Single Super Phosphate):** As an alternative to DAP, 400-500 g of **SSP** per plant per year can be used.
    *   Apply similarly to DAP, in 2-3 splits, with a significant portion at planting. SSP also provides Sulphur and Calcium.
*   **Nano-DAP:** Can be used as a supplementary foliar application to enhance phosphorus use efficiency and potentially reduce granular DAP/SSP requirement.
    *   Mix 2-4 ml of **Nano-DAP** per litre of water and spray at critical growth stages (e.g., active vegetative growth, pre-flowering, fruit development).

**3. Potassium (K2O):**
*   **Potash (Muriate of Potash - MOP):** 300-400 g per plant per year.
    *   Apply in 4-5 equal splits, starting from 2 months after planting, coinciding with nitrogen applications. Potassium is crucial for fruit development, size, and quality.

**4. NPK (Complex Fertilizers):**
*   If using complex NPK fertilizers (e.g., NPK 19:19:19, NPK 10:26:26), the total N, P2O5, and K2O requirements should be met by calculating the appropriate amount of the complex fertilizer.
*   For example, to meet the N, P, and K requirements, you would calculate the quantity of the specific **NPK** grade needed. It is often more precise and economical to use straight fertilizers (Urea, DAP/SSP, MOP) to meet the specific nutrient needs of banana.

**5. Sulphur (S):**
*   **Sulphur:** 20-30 g per plant per year.
    *   This requirement can be partially met if **SSP** is used (SSP contains about 12% Sulphur).
    *   If not using SSP, or if soil tests indicate a deficiency, apply elemental **Sulphur** (e.g., Bentonite Sulphur) at 20-30 g per plant per year, typically once a year at planting or during early growth stages.

**Application Method:**
*   **Soil Application:** Granular fertilizers should be applied in a ring around the plant, approximately 30-45 cm away from the pseudostem, and lightly incorporated into the soil.
*   **Foliar Application:** Nano-fertilizers are best applied as foliar sprays, ensuring good coverage of the leaves.

Always monitor your plants for any signs of nutrient deficiencies or excesses and adjust your fertilization program accordingly.
