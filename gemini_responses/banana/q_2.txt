As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding rust diseases in Banana for Haryana, India:

Regarding the specific rust diseases you've mentioned:

*   **Black Rust (Stem Rust), Brown Rust (Leaf Rust), Yellow Rust (Stripe Rust), and White Rust:** These are primarily diseases of cereal crops (like wheat, barley) or other specific plant families. **These are not known to affect Banana.**

*   **Red Rust:** In the context of banana, "Red Rust" typically refers to the true fungal rust disease caused by *Puccinia musae* (anamorph *Uredo musae*). This disease manifests as reddish-brown pustules, primarily on the underside of banana leaves.

Here's how to control Banana Rust (*Puccinia musae*):

**I. Cultural and Management Practices:**

1.  **Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy severely infected leaves and plant debris to reduce the inoculum source.
2.  **Air Circulation:** Ensure proper plant spacing to allow for good air circulation within the plantation, which helps in drying leaf surfaces and reducing humidity, thereby discouraging fungal growth.
3.  **Nutrient Management:** Maintain balanced nutrition. Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush, susceptible growth.
4.  **Weed Control:** Keep the area around banana plants free of weeds, as they can harbor diseases and impede air circulation.
5.  **Water Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation late in the day, which can leave leaves wet for prolonged periods. Irrigate in the morning to allow leaves to dry quickly.

**II. Chemical Control (Fungicides):**

In cases of severe infection, chemical control can be employed using CIBRC-approved fungicides. Always rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

*   **Systemic Fungicides:**
    *   **Propiconazole 25% EC:** Apply at a concentration of 0.5 - 1.0 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:** Apply at a concentration of 0.5 - 1.0 ml per litre of water.

*   **Contact Fungicides (for preventive application or in rotation):**
    *   **Mancozeb 75% WP:** Apply at a concentration of 2.0 grams per litre of water.

**Application Notes:**
*   Ensure thorough coverage of the leaf surfaces, especially the undersides where pustules are more prevalent.
*   Repeat applications as per the product label recommendations, typically at 10-14 day intervals, depending on disease severity and weather conditions.
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the fungicide label for dosage, application timing, and safety precautions.
