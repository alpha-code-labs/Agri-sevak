As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods for effective management of rot diseases in banana.

Here's how to control various rot types in banana:

**1. Root Rot, Stem Rot, Foot Rot, Collar Rot, and Seedling Rot**
These rots primarily affect the underground parts, pseudostem base, or young plantlets. They are often caused by soil-borne fungi like *Fusarium oxysporum* f. sp. *cubense* (Panama disease/Fusarium wilt), *Pythium* spp., *Phytophthora* spp., *Rhizoctonia solani*, and sometimes bacterial soft rot by *Erwinia* spp. or *Pectobacterium* spp. in the case of stem rot.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Disease-Free Planting Material:** Always use healthy, certified tissue culture plantlets or suckers from disease-free mother plants.
    *   **Soil Drainage:** Ensure excellent soil drainage to prevent waterlogging, which favors rot pathogens. Raised beds can be beneficial.
    *   **Field Hygiene:** Remove and destroy infected plants and plant debris immediately to reduce inoculum.
    *   **Avoid Injuries:** Minimize mechanical damage to roots and pseudostems during intercultural operations.
    *   **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide adequate and balanced nutrients to enhance plant vigor and resistance. Avoid excessive nitrogen.
    *   **Soil Solarization:** In fallow periods, solarize the soil for 4-6 weeks during hot months to reduce pathogen load.
*   **Biological Control:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply bio-control agents like **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum** (2.5 kg/acre mixed with 50 kg Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost) or **Pseudomonas fluorescens** (2.5 kg/acre mixed with 50 kg FYM) at the time of planting and subsequently as a drench.
    *   **Plantlet Dip:** Dip tissue culture plantlets or suckers in a solution of **Trichoderma viride** or **Pseudomonas fluorescens** (10 g/L water) for 30 minutes before planting.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Pre-planting Dip:** Dip suckers/plantlets in a solution of **Carbendazim 50% WP** (1 g/L water) or **Metalaxyl 8% + Mancozeb 64% WP** (2 g/L water) for 15-20 minutes.
    *   **Soil Drench:** For established plants showing early symptoms, drench the soil around the base with **Carbendazim 50% WP** (2 g/L water) or **Metalaxyl 8% + Mancozeb 64% WP** (2.5 g/L water) or **Copper Oxychloride 50% WP** (3 g/L water). Repeat if necessary.
    *   **For Rhizoctonia-specific rots:** Drench with **Validamycin 3% L** (2.5 ml/L water).
    *   **For Bacterial Soft Rot (Stem Rot):** Drench with a combination of **Streptomycin Sulphate 9% + Tetracycline Hydrochloride 1% SP** (1 g/L water) or **Copper Oxychloride 50% WP** (3 g/L water).

**2. Crown Rot and Neck Rot**
These are primarily post-harvest diseases, often caused by a complex of fungi like *Colletotrichum musae*, *Fusarium semitectum*, *Thielaviopsis paradoxa*, and *Lasiodiplodia theobromae*. They affect the cut surface of the banana hand (crown) and can extend to the fruit neck.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Careful Harvesting:** Harvest bunches carefully to avoid mechanical injuries.
    *   **Clean Cuts:** Make clean cuts when de-handing the bunches.
    *   **Rapid Cooling:** Cool harvested bananas quickly to slow down fungal growth.
    *   **Hygiene:** Maintain strict hygiene in packing sheds and handling areas.
*   **Chemical Control (Post-harvest):**
    *   **Fungicidal Dip:** Dip banana hands immediately after de-handing in a solution of **Carbendazim 50% WP** (0.5-1 g/L water) or **Thiophanate Methyl 70% WP** (0.5-1 g/L water) for 1-2 minutes. Ensure the solution is changed regularly to maintain efficacy.

**3. Black Rot**
This is a general term. If it refers to a specific fruit rot, it's often caused by *Colletotrichum musae* (Anthracnose) or *Lasiodiplodia theobromae*. If it refers to a structural rot, it is likely covered by the root/stem/foot rot categories mentioned above.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   As mentioned for Crown Rot and Fruit Rot.
    *   Maintain good field sanitation.
*   **Chemical Control (Pre-harvest for fruit protection):**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** For general fruit protection against anthracnose, spray with **Mancozeb 75% WP** (2.5 g/L water) or **Carbendazim 50% WP** (1 g/L water) during fruit development, ensuring good coverage of the developing bunches.

**4. Fruit Rot**
This includes pre-harvest and post-harvest rots, such as Anthracnose (*Colletotrichum musae*), Cigar-end rot (*Verticillium theobromae* or *Fusarium pallidoroseum*), and Black Tip Rot (*Botryodiplodia theobromae*).

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Bunch Covering:** Cover developing banana bunches with perforated polythene bags or dry leaves to protect them from insect damage and direct exposure to rain and sun, which can reduce disease incidence.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected fruits and plant parts.
    *   **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing for good air circulation.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Pre-harvest Spray:** Spray developing bunches with **Mancozeb 75% WP** (2.5 g/L water) or **Carbendazim 50% WP** (1 g/L water) at appropriate intervals, especially during humid conditions.
    *   **Post-harvest Dip:** As mentioned for Crown Rot.

**5. Seed Rot**
This is not known to affect Banana, as commercial banana cultivation relies on vegetative propagation (suckers or tissue culture plantlets), not seeds.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label, including dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest intervals.
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in pathogens.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension services for the most current and specific recommendations for your region and banana variety.
