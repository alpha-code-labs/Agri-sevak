As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Banana cultivation in Haryana:

### Control of Pests in Banana

**1. Grasshopper**

Grasshoppers can occasionally cause damage to banana leaves, especially on young plants.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Maintain field sanitation by regularly removing weeds and crop residues, which can serve as breeding grounds and shelter for grasshoppers.
    *   Encourage natural predators like birds, spiders, and predatory insects.

*   **Chemical Control (if infestation is severe):**
    *   For foliar spray, use:
        *   **Malathion** 50% EC at 2.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   Ensure thorough coverage of the affected foliage.

**2. Painted Bug**

This is not known to affect Banana. The Painted bug (*Bagrada hilaris*) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops like mustard, cabbage, and radish.

**3. Red Cotton Bug**

This is not known to affect Banana. The Red cotton bug (*Dysdercus cingulatus*) is primarily a pest of cotton and other malvaceous plants, feeding on developing seeds.

**4. Black Ants**

Black ants are often secondary pests in banana, attracted to the honeydew secreted by sap-sucking insects like aphids, mealybugs, or scale insects. They can also protect these sap-suckers from natural enemies. Direct damage by ants to banana plants is less common.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Regularly inspect plants for sap-sucking pests. Controlling these primary pests will often reduce ant activity.
    *   Remove any debris or plant material around the base of the plant that could provide shelter for ant nests.

*   **Chemical Control (if ants are a nuisance or protecting other pests):**
    *   **For ant nests around the base of the plant or as a barrier:**
        *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 2.5 ml per litre of water, applied as a drench around the base of the plant or as a barrier spray on the stem.
    *   **For general ant control using baits:**
        *   **Fipronil** 0.01% GR (granules) can be used as bait. Apply 10-15 kg per acre by scattering granules near ant trails or nests.
