Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice regarding dropping in banana.

Firstly, regarding "Tinda/Boll dropping":
*   This is not known to affect Banana. The terms "Tinda" (referring to Indian round gourd) and "Boll" (referring to cotton fruit) are specific to other crops and not used in banana cultivation.

Now, let's address flower drop and fruit drop in Banana. This is a common physiological issue that can significantly reduce yield. It is often a plant's response to various stresses or imbalances.

**Key Factors Contributing to Flower and Fruit Drop in Banana:**

1.  **Environmental Stress:**
    *   **Water Stress:** Both drought (insufficient water) and waterlogging (excess water) can lead to dropping.
    *   **Temperature Extremes:** Very high or very low temperatures, especially during flowering and early fruit development, can cause stress.
    *   **High Winds:** Strong winds can physically damage flowers and young fruits, leading to abscission.
2.  **Nutritional Deficiencies:**
    *   Lack of essential nutrients, particularly Potassium (K), Boron (B), and Calcium (Ca), can impair flower and fruit development and retention.
    *   General nutrient imbalance.
3.  **Hormonal Imbalance:**
    *   An imbalance between growth-promoting hormones (like auxins and gibberellins) and abscission-promoting hormones (like ethylene) can lead to dropping.
4.  **Pest and Disease Damage:**
    *   Sucking pests (e.g., thrips, mites) can damage flowers and young fruits, leading to their premature shedding.
    *   Certain diseases affecting the inflorescence or young fruits can also cause dropping.
5.  **Physiological Factors:**
    *   Over-bearing: The plant may naturally shed some flowers or young fruits if the fruit load is too high for its capacity to support.

**Control Measures for Flower and Fruit Drop in Banana:**

A holistic approach combining cultural practices, nutritional management, and hormonal interventions is recommended.

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Optimal Irrigation:** Ensure consistent and adequate water supply, especially during flowering and fruit development. Avoid both water scarcity and waterlogging. Drip irrigation is highly recommended for efficient water use.
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the plantation weed-free to reduce competition for water and nutrients.
    *   **Mulching:** Apply organic mulch around the base of plants to conserve soil moisture, regulate soil temperature, and suppress weeds.
    *   **Proper Spacing:** Maintain recommended plant spacing to ensure good air circulation and light penetration, reducing stress.
    *   **Windbreaks:** In areas prone to strong winds, planting windbreak trees around the orchard can protect the banana plants.

2.  **Nutritional Management:**
    *   **Soil Testing:** Conduct regular soil tests to determine nutrient status and apply fertilizers based on recommendations.
    *   **Balanced Fertilization:** Ensure adequate supply of macro and micronutrients.
        *   **Potassium (K):** Crucial for fruit development and stress tolerance. Apply **Potassium chloride** (Muriate of Potash) or **Potassium sulphate** as per soil test recommendations, typically 150-300 kg/acre annually in split doses.
        *   **Boron (B):** Essential for pollen viability, flower fertilization, and fruit set.
            *   Foliar spray: Apply **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (e.g., Solubor) at 1.5-2.0 g/L of water, or **Disodium tetraborate decahydrate** (Borax) at 3-4 g/L of water, at pre-flowering and early fruit set stages.
        *   **Calcium (Ca):** Important for cell wall integrity and fruit retention.
            *   Foliar spray: Apply **Calcium nitrate** at 5-7 g/L of water, or **Calcium chloride** at 3-5 g/L of water, during flowering and fruit development.
        *   **Micronutrient Mixture:** If multiple deficiencies are suspected, a foliar spray of a CIBRC-approved chelated micronutrient mixture can be beneficial.

3.  **Hormonal Management (Plant Growth Regulators - PGRs):**
    *   **Auxins:** Can help in fruit retention by delaying the formation of the abscission layer.
        *   **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA):** Apply as a foliar spray at a concentration of 10-20 mg/L (ppm) of water at the early fruit set stage. This helps in reducing premature fruit drop. Ensure proper coverage of the young fruits and pedicels.

4.  **Pest and Disease Management:**
    *   Regularly monitor your banana plants for any signs of pests (e.g., thrips, mites, mealybugs) or diseases that might be affecting the flowers or young fruits.
    *   If specific pests or diseases are identified as the cause of dropping, implement targeted control measures using CIBRC-approved pesticides/fungicides. For example, if thrips are severe, an insecticide like **Imidacloprid** (0.3 ml/L) or **Thiamethoxam** (0.2 g/L) might be considered, but only after confirming pest presence and damage.

By implementing these integrated measures, you can effectively manage and reduce flower and fruit drop in your banana plantation, leading to better yields. Always consult your local agricultural extension office for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions.
