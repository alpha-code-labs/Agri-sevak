As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned conditions in Banana, specifically for the agro-climatic conditions of Haryana.

Here's how to address Scab, Canker, Gummosis, and Lichen in Banana:

### 1. Scab in Banana

Banana Scab, primarily caused by the fungus *Sphaceloma musarum*, is a known disease affecting banana plants, particularly the fruit, leaves, and petioles. It manifests as rough, corky lesions.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Maintain good field sanitation by removing and destroying infected plant parts.
    *   Ensure proper spacing between plants to improve air circulation and reduce humidity.
    *   Use disease-free planting material.
*   **Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
    *   For effective control, especially during fruit development, apply fungicides as a protective measure.
    *   **Mancozeb:** Apply at a rate of 2.0-2.5 g per litre of water.
    *   **Chlorothalonil:** Apply at a rate of 2.0-2.5 g per litre of water.
    *   **Copper oxychloride:** Apply at a rate of 2.5-3.0 g per litre of water.
    *   **Propiconazole:** Apply at a rate of 0.5-1.0 ml per litre of water.

Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

### 2. Canker in Banana

This is not known to affect Banana. The term "canker" typically refers to localized necrotic lesions on woody stems or branches of trees, often caused by fungi or bacteria. While bananas can suffer from stem rots or vascular wilts (e.g., Panama wilt, Moko disease), these are not commonly referred to as "canker" in banana pathology.

### 3. Gummosis in Banana

This is not known to affect Banana. Gummosis is the pathological exudation of gum from plant tissues, commonly seen in citrus or stone fruit trees in response to stress, injury, or specific diseases (e.g., *Phytophthora* gummosis). While banana plants can exude sap (latex) when injured or affected by certain vascular diseases, a distinct disease named "Gummosis" is not recognized in banana.

### 4. Lichen in Banana

Lichens are symbiotic organisms (a fungus and an alga) that grow superficially on the bark of trees and other plants. They are epiphytes and are generally considered non-parasitic, meaning they do not directly feed on or harm the banana plant. Their presence often indicates good air quality and high humidity.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Improve air circulation within the plantation by proper spacing and judicious removal of old, senescent leaves. This can help reduce the humidity levels that favour lichen growth.
    *   Ensure the plants are healthy and vigorous, as dense lichen growth can sometimes be more noticeable on less vigorous plants.
*   **Chemical Control (if deemed necessary for aesthetic reasons or very heavy growth):**
    *   While generally not required, if heavy lichen growth is a concern, a mild spray of a copper-based fungicide can help deter them.
    *   **Copper oxychloride:** Apply at a rate of 2.5-3.0 g per litre of water.
    *   It is important to note that chemical control for lichens is rarely necessary as they do not cause direct damage to the banana plant.
