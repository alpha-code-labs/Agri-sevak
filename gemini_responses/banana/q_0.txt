Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Banana cultivation in Haryana.

It's important to correctly identify the specific disease, as control measures can vary. Here's how to manage the fungal conditions you've mentioned:

### Fungal Diseases Affecting Banana:

**1. Alternaria Leaf Spot (Caused by *Alternaria alternata*)**
This disease typically causes small, dark brown to black spots on leaves, which can enlarge and coalesce, leading to blight-like symptoms.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Remove and destroy severely infected leaves to reduce inoculum.
    *   Ensure proper plant spacing for good air circulation.
    *   Maintain balanced nutrition, avoiding excessive nitrogen.
*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
    *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP): 2.5-3.0 g/L of water (or 1.0-1.2 kg/acre).
    *   **Chlorothalonil** (75% WP): 2.0-2.5 g/L of water (or 800-1000 g/acre).
    *   **Propiconazole** (25% EC): 0.5 ml/L of water (or 200 ml/acre).
    *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC): 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water (or 200-400 ml/acre).

**2. Anthracnose (Caused by *Colletotrichum musae*)**
Anthracnose primarily affects banana fruits, causing dark, sunken lesions, especially during ripening. It can also cause leaf spots.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Harvest fruits carefully to avoid injury.
    *   Maintain orchard hygiene by removing infected plant debris.
    *   Ensure proper ventilation in storage areas.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Pre-harvest (Foliar Spray):**
        *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP): 2.5-3.0 g/L of water (or 1.0-1.2 kg/acre).
        *   **Carbendazim** (50% WP): 0.5-1.0 g/L of water (or 200-400 g/acre).
        *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC): 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water (or 200-400 ml/acre).
    *   **Post-harvest (Fruit Dip):**
        *   **Carbendazim** (50% WP): 0.5-1.0 g/L of water for 2-5 minutes.

**3. Blight and Brown Spot (Primarily symptoms of Sigatoka Leaf Spot Complex)**
In banana, "Blight" and "Brown Spot" symptoms are most commonly associated with the Sigatoka leaf spot complex, which includes Yellow Sigatoka (*Pseudocercospora musae*) and Black Sigatoka (*Pseudocercospora fijiensis*). These are the most destructive leaf diseases of banana, causing extensive leaf necrosis and reduced fruit yield and quality.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **De-suckering:** Regularly remove excess suckers to maintain plant vigor and improve air circulation.
    *   **De-leafing:** Remove severely infected older leaves (up to 1-2 functional leaves below the youngest unfurled leaf) and destroy them away from the plantation.
    *   **Nutrition:** Ensure balanced fertilization, especially potassium, to enhance plant resistance.
    *   **Drainage:** Provide good drainage to prevent waterlogging.
*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
    *   **Contact Fungicides (for protective action, especially in early stages or rotation):**
        *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP): 2.5-3.0 g/L of water (or 1.0-1.2 kg/acre).
        *   **Chlorothalonil** (75% WP): 2.0-2.5 g/L of water (or 800-1000 g/acre).
        *   **Copper Oxychloride** (50% WP): 3.0-4.0 g/L of water (or 1.2-1.6 kg/acre).
    *   **Systemic Fungicides (for curative and protective action, crucial for established infections):**
        *   **Propiconazole** (25% EC): 0.5 ml/L of water (or 200 ml/acre).
        *   **Difenoconazole** (25% EC): 0.5 ml/L of water (or 200 ml/acre).
        *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC): 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water (or 200-400 ml/acre).
        *   **Trifloxystrobin 25% + Tebuconazole 50% WG**: 0.6 g/L of water (or 240 g/acre).
    *   **Rotation:** It is crucial to rotate fungicides with different modes of action (e.g., contact with systemic, different systemic groups) to prevent the development of fungicide resistance in Sigatoka pathogens. Consult your local agricultural extension for a recommended spray schedule.

### Fungal Diseases Not Known to Affect Banana:

*   **Blast:** This is not known to affect Banana.
*   **Downy Mildew:** This is not known to affect Banana.
*   **Powdery Mildew:** This is not known to affect Banana.
*   **Grey Mildew:** This is not known to affect Banana.

Always read the label instructions of any chemical product before use and adhere to safety precautions, including wearing appropriate personal protective equipment. For specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions, please consult with your local HAU Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or agricultural extension officer.
