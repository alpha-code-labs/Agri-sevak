Namaste. As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with the recommended cultivation practices for Banana in Haryana. It is important to note that banana is propagated vegetatively, not by seeds.

Here are the scientifically verified recommendations:

*   **Sowing method/pattern:**
    *   Banana is propagated vegetatively, primarily using disease-free tissue-cultured plantlets or healthy sword suckers. Tissue-cultured plantlets are highly recommended for their uniformity, vigor, and freedom from pests and diseases, leading to better yields and reduced disease incidence.
    *   Planting is done directly in well-prepared pits.
    *   The most common planting pattern is the **square system**, which facilitates inter-cultivation operations. Paired-row or high-density planting systems are also adopted by some farmers to maximize land use efficiency, especially with dwarf varieties like Grand Naine.

*   **Planting depth:**
    *   **For tissue-cultured plantlets:** Dig pits of approximately **30 cm x 30 cm x 30 cm**. Place the plantlet in the center of the pit, ensuring that the top of the root ball is at the same level as it was in the polybag, or slightly below ground level. Gently backfill with soil, firming it around the base of the plant to ensure good contact and stability. Avoid planting too deep, as this can hinder growth.
    *   **For suckers:** Pits of **45 cm x 45 cm x 45 cm** are recommended. Place the sucker in the center, ensuring the base of the pseudo-stem is at ground level or slightly below, and fill the pit with soil, firming it well to provide anchorage.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   The optimal spacing depends on the cultivar, soil fertility, and management practices. For the most commonly cultivated commercial variety, Grand Naine, in Haryana, the following spacings are recommended:
        *   **Standard Spacing:** **1.8 meters** between rows and **1.8 meters** between plants within a row (1.8 m x 1.8 m). This spacing allows for good plant development and ease of cultural operations.
        *   **High-Density Planting (HDP):** For higher yields per unit area, a spacing of **1.5 meters x 1.5 meters** can be adopted. Alternatively, a paired-row system (e.g., 1.2 m between plants in a row, 1.5 m between paired rows, and 2.5-3 m between sets of paired rows) can also be considered, requiring careful management.

*   **Seed dose (Planting material requirement):**
    *   As banana is propagated vegetatively, this refers to the number of plantlets/suckers required per unit area, which is determined by the chosen spacing:
        *   For **1.8 m x 1.8 m spacing**: Approximately **3086 plantlets per hectare** (or about 1250 plantlets per acre).
        *   For **1.5 m x 1.5 m spacing (HDP)**: Approximately **4444 plantlets per hectare** (or about 1798 plantlets per acre).

It is crucial to use healthy, disease-free planting material and ensure proper pit preparation with organic matter and soil amendments for successful banana cultivation.
