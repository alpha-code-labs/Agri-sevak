As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified recommendations for the use of growth regulators and micronutrients in banana cultivation in Haryana:

### Recommended Doses of Growth Regulators/Hormones and Micronutrients in Banana

**1. Ethephon**
*   **Technical Chemical Name:** **Ethephon**
*   **Purpose:** **Ethephon** is a plant growth regulator that releases ethylene, a natural ripening hormone. It is primarily used for uniform post-harvest ripening and degreening of banana fruits.
*   **Recommended Dose:** For post-harvest ripening, dip banana bunches or individual fruits in an aqueous solution of **Ethephon** at 250-500 mg/L (0.25-0.5 g/L) of water.
*   **Application:** Post-harvest dipping for 5-10 minutes. Ensure proper ventilation during the ripening process.

**2. 2,4-D**
*   **Technical Chemical Name:** **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid**
*   **Recommendation:** While **2,4-D** is a synthetic auxin, its primary and widely recommended use in agriculture is as a selective herbicide. Its application as a growth regulator for fruit development or yield enhancement in commercial banana cultivation is not a standard practice and is generally not recommended by HAU. This is due to the high risk of phytotoxicity even at very low concentrations, and the availability of safer and more effective alternatives for growth regulation. Therefore, we do not recommend its use as a growth regulator in banana.

**3. Boron**
*   **Technical Chemical Names:** **Sodium tetraborate decahydrate** (commonly known as Borax) or **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (commonly known as Solubor).
*   **Purpose:** Boron is an essential micronutrient critical for various physiological processes in banana, including cell division, pollen germination, fruit set, and overall fruit development. Boron application helps prevent deficiency symptoms, improves fruit set, and enhances fruit quality.
*   **Recommended Dose:** Foliar spray of:
    *   **Sodium tetraborate decahydrate** (Borax) at 2-3 g/L of water (0.2-0.3% solution).
    *   OR **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (Solubor) at 1-1.5 g/L of water (0.1-0.15% solution).
*   **Application:** Apply as a foliar spray to the foliage and developing bunches. Typically, 2-3 sprays are recommended:
    *   First spray: Before flowering (at the time of bunch emergence).
    *   Second spray: At fruit set.
    *   Third spray: During the fruit development stage (2-3 months after fruit set).
