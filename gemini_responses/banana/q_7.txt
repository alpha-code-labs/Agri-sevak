As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I must provide scientifically verified advice.

Regarding the conditions you mentioned for Banana:

*   **Dieback:** This is not known to affect Banana as a specific disease. While parts of a banana plant can die, it is usually a symptom of other underlying diseases (e.g., Fusarium wilt, bacterial soft rot, severe Sigatoka leaf spot) or physiological stress, rather than a primary disease called "Dieback."
*   **Twig blight:** Banana plants do not have twigs. This is not known to affect Banana.
*   **Tikka disease:** This is a well-known disease of groundnut (peanut) and is not known to affect Banana.
