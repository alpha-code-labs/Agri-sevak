As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified recommendations for pre-planting treatments for Banana cultivation in Haryana. It is important to note that bananas are propagated vegetatively, primarily through suckers, corms, or tissue culture plantlets, not true seeds. Therefore, "seed treatment" refers to the treatment of these planting materials.

### Pre-planting Material Treatment (Sucker/Corm/Plantlet Treatment) for Banana

This treatment aims to protect the planting material from initial infections by soil-borne pathogens and nematodes, ensuring a healthy start for the crop.

*   **For Suckers/Corms:**
    *   **Fungicidal Dip:** To protect against fungal diseases like Fusarium wilt and corm rot.
        *   Dip the trimmed suckers/corms in a solution of **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 1-2 grams per litre of water for 30 minutes.
        *   **OR**
        *   Dip in a solution of **Thiophanate Methyl** 70% WP at 1-2 grams per litre of water for 30 minutes.
    *   **Bio-fungicidal Dip:** To provide biological protection and enhance root development.
        *   Dip the suckers/corms in a suspension of *Trichoderma viride* (or *Trichoderma harzianum*) 1-2% WP at 10-20 grams per litre of water for 30 minutes.
        *   **OR**
        *   Dip in a suspension of *Pseudomonas fluorescens* 1-2% WP at 10-20 grams per litre of water for 30 minutes.
        *   *(Note: Bio-agent dips are highly recommended for sustainable disease management and can be used in conjunction with or as an alternative to chemical fungicides, especially if the planting material is relatively healthy.)*
    *   **Nematicidal Dip (if severe nematode history):**
        *   While less common for dipping, in areas with known high nematode pressure, a short dip in a dilute solution of certain nematicides might be considered, but soil application is generally more effective. Consult local HAU experts for specific recommendations in such cases.

*   **For Tissue Culture Plantlets:**
    *   Tissue culture plantlets are generally disease-free when sourced from reputable labs. The primary focus is on hardening and acclimatization.
    *   A dip in *Trichoderma viride* or *Pseudomonas fluorescens* suspension (as above) can be beneficial before planting to provide early biological protection against soil-borne pathogens.

### Soil Treatment (Pre-planting) for Banana

Effective soil treatment before planting is crucial for managing soil-borne diseases, nematodes, and improving overall soil health.

1.  **Land Preparation:**
    *   Deep ploughing and harrowing to achieve a fine tilth. This helps in aerating the soil and exposing pest stages to sunlight.
    *   **Solarization:** If feasible, cover the prepared land with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks during hot summer months. This helps in reducing soil-borne pathogens and weed seeds.

2.  **Organic Matter Incorporation:**
    *   Incorporate 10-15 tonnes per acre of well-decomposed Farmyard Manure (FYM) or compost into the soil at least 2-3 weeks before planting. This improves soil structure, water retention, and provides nutrients, while also supporting beneficial microbial activity.

3.  **Nematode Management (if history of nematodes):**
    *   **Chemical Nematicide:**
        *   Apply **Carbofuran** 3% G at 10-15 kg per acre, either broadcast and incorporated into the soil before planting, or applied in the planting pits at the time of planting.
        *   **OR**
        *   Apply **Phorate** 10% G at 4-6 kg per acre, applied in the planting pits.
        *   *(Note: Apply these chemicals carefully, following safety guidelines, and ensure proper incorporation.)*
    *   **Bio-nematicide:**
        *   Mix *Purpureocillium lilacinum* (formerly *Paecilomyces lilacinus*) 1-2% WP at 2-4 kg per acre with 100 kg of FYM and incorporate into the soil 15-20 days before planting. This helps in suppressing plant-parasitic nematodes.

4.  **Fungal Disease Management (Bio-agents):**
    *   To manage soil-borne fungal diseases like Fusarium wilt and corm rot, incorporate beneficial microbes into the soil.
    *   Mix *Trichoderma viride* (or *Trichoderma harzianum*) 1-2% WP at 2-4 kg per acre with 100 kg of well-decomposed FYM and incorporate into the soil 15-20 days before planting.
    *   **OR**
    *   Mix *Pseudomonas fluorescens* 1-2% WP at 2-4 kg per acre with 100 kg of well-decomposed FYM and incorporate into the soil 15-20 days before planting.
    *   *(These bio-agents colonize the root zone, protecting plants from pathogens and promoting growth.)*

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always conduct a soil test to understand the nutrient status and pH of your field.
*   Consult with local HAU extension specialists for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's soil type, previous crop history, and prevailing pest/disease pressure.
*   Strictly follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions when handling any chemical or biological product.
