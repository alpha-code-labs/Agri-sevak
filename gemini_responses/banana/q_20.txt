Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the critical importance of balanced nutrition for optimal banana production in Haryana. Micronutrient deficiencies can significantly impact yield and fruit quality.

The first and most crucial step in addressing any nutrient deficiency is a **comprehensive soil test**. This will accurately identify which specific micronutrients are lacking and to what extent, allowing for precise and efficient application. Visual symptoms can be indicative, but a soil test provides scientific validation.

Here's how to address the common micronutrient deficiencies in banana, based on scientific recommendations and CIBRC approved chemicals:

### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Characterized by "little leaf" (small, narrow, and chlorotic leaves), reduced internode length, and stunted plant growth.

**Corrective Measures:**

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** at 10-20 kg per acre, mixed with farmyard manure, at the time of planting or during active growth.
*   **Foliar Spray:**
    *   Spray a 0.5% solution of **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (5 g per litre of water). To neutralize acidity and prevent leaf burn, add 2.5 g of lime (calcium hydroxide) per litre of water. Apply 2-3 sprays at 15-day intervals, starting from 2-3 months after planting.

### 2. Iron (Fe) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Prominent interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, with veins remaining green. In severe cases, the entire leaf may turn pale yellow or white.

**Corrective Measures:**

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Ferrous sulphate** at 20-40 kg per acre, especially in soils with high pH, though its effectiveness can be limited in such conditions.
*   **Foliar Spray:**
    *   Spray a 0.5-1% solution of **Ferrous sulphate** (5-10 g per litre of water) or a 0.1% solution of **Iron EDTA** (1 g per litre of water). Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals until symptoms disappear.

### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Shortened internodes, brittle and distorted leaves, thickening of leaf lamina, and malformed or cracked fruit. The growing point may die back in severe cases.

**Corrective Measures:**

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate) at 4-8 kg per acre or **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** at 2-4 kg per acre, mixed with soil or compost, at planting or during early growth.
*   **Foliar Spray:**
    *   Spray a 0.1-0.2% solution of **Borax** (1-2 g per litre of water) or **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (1-2 g per litre of water). Apply 2-3 sprays during the vegetative and early reproductive stages.

### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Poor root development, necrosis (death) of young leaves and growing points, and a characteristic "choke throat" symptom where emerging leaves fail to unfurl properly.

**Corrective Measures:**

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Gypsum** (Calcium sulphate dihydrate) at 200-400 kg per acre to improve soil structure and supply calcium, especially in sodic soils.
    *   Alternatively, apply **Calcium nitrate** at 10-20 kg per acre as a direct calcium source.
*   **Foliar Spray:**
    *   Spray a 0.5-1% solution of **Calcium nitrate** (5-10 g per litre of water). Apply 2-3 sprays, particularly during periods of rapid growth and fruit development.

### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, starting from the margins and progressing inwards, often accompanied by a reddish-brown or purplish discoloration.

**Corrective Measures:**

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Magnesium sulphate** at 20-40 kg per acre, mixed with soil or compost, at planting or during active growth.
*   **Foliar Spray:**
    *   Spray a 1-2% solution of **Magnesium sulphate** (10-20 g per litre of water). Apply 2-3 sprays at 15-day intervals, especially when symptoms are visible.

### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, similar to iron deficiency but often with a finer network of green veins. Leaves may appear mottled or speckled.

**Corrective Measures:**

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Manganese sulphate** at 10-20 kg per acre, mixed with soil or compost, at planting or during active growth.
*   **Foliar Spray:**
    *   Spray a 0.5% solution of **Manganese sulphate** (5 g per litre of water). Apply 2-3 sprays at 15-day intervals.

### General Recommendations:

*   **Timing:** Foliar sprays are most effective when applied in the early morning or late afternoon to avoid rapid drying and maximize absorption.
*   **Water Quality:** Use clean water for all sprays.
*   **Compatibility:** Always check the compatibility of micronutrient fertilizers if mixing with other pesticides or fertilizers. It is generally advisable to apply micronutrients separately.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management:** Combine these specific treatments with a balanced NPK fertilization program and regular application of organic manures to maintain overall soil health and nutrient availability.
*   **Repeat Soil Testing:** Conduct soil tests every 2-3 years to monitor nutrient levels and adjust fertilization programs accordingly.

By following these scientifically verified recommendations, banana growers in Haryana can effectively manage micronutrient deficiencies and ensure healthy, productive plants.
