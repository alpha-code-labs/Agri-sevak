Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, I can provide you with scientifically verified advice to address macro-nutrient deficiencies (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium) in Banana cultivation in Haryana. Accurate diagnosis is crucial, so I strongly recommend conducting a soil test and, if possible, leaf tissue analysis before applying any fertilizers. This will help determine the precise nutrient status and avoid over-application.

Here's how to address these deficiencies:

**1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency:**
*   **Symptoms:** General yellowing (chlorosis) of older leaves, stunted plant growth, reduced leaf size, and smaller fruit bunches.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply nitrogenous fertilizers in split doses throughout the growing season. For an existing deficiency, an immediate top-dressing can be beneficial.
        *   **Urea:** 150-200 kg/acre/year, split into 4-6 applications. For immediate correction, apply 25-30 kg/acre as a top-dressing.
        *   **Ammonium Sulphate:** 300-400 kg/acre/year, split into 4-6 applications.
        *   **Calcium Ammonium Nitrate:** 250-350 kg/acre/year, split into 4-6 applications.
    *   **Foliar Application (for quick but temporary relief):**
        *   **Urea:** Spray a 1-2% solution (10-20 g/L of water) on the foliage, ensuring good coverage. Repeat every 10-15 days if symptoms persist.

**2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency:**
*   **Symptoms:** Dark green or purplish discoloration of older leaves, stunted growth, poor root development, and delayed maturity.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Phosphorus is less mobile in the soil, so it's best applied basally or incorporated into the soil during planting. For existing deficiency, a band application near the root zone can be effective.
        *   **Single Super Phosphate:** 180-300 kg/acre/year (supplying 30-50 kg P2O5/acre), applied basally or as a band application.
        *   **Di-Ammonium Phosphate:** 65-110 kg/acre/year (supplying 30-50 kg P2O5/acre), applied basally or as a band application.

**3. Potassium (K) Deficiency:**
*   **Symptoms:** Yellowing and browning (scorching) of leaf margins, especially on older leaves, weak pseudostem, poor fruit development, and reduced bunch size.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Potassium is highly demanded by banana. Apply in split doses throughout the growing season.
        *   **Muriate of Potash (Potassium Chloride):** 250-350 kg/acre/year (supplying 150-200 kg K2O/acre), split into 4-6 applications. For immediate correction, apply 40-50 kg/acre as a top-dressing.
        *   **Sulphate of Potash (Potassium Sulphate):** 300-450 kg/acre/year (supplying 150-200 kg K2O/acre), split into 4-6 applications.
    *   **Foliar Application (for quick but temporary relief):**
        *   **Potassium Sulphate:** Spray a 1-2% solution (10-20 g/L of water) on the foliage.
        *   **Potassium Nitrate:** Spray a 1-2% solution (10-20 g/L of water) on the foliage.

**General Recommendations for Effective Nutrient Management:**
*   **Soil Testing:** This is paramount. Get your soil tested every 2-3 years to understand its nutrient status and pH.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management (INM):** Supplement chemical fertilizers with organic manures (Farm Yard Manure, vermicompost) and bio-fertilizers to improve soil health and nutrient availability.
*   **Water Management:** Ensure adequate and timely irrigation, as water stress can severely limit nutrient uptake.
*   **Split Applications:** For Nitrogen and Potassium, applying fertilizers in multiple smaller doses throughout the crop cycle is more efficient than a single large application, reducing losses and ensuring continuous availability.

Always follow the specific recommendations from your latest soil test report for precise fertilizer quantities.
