Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide you with the scientifically verified information regarding the maturity signs, harvesting time, and cutting process for Banana cultivation in Haryana. Proper harvesting is crucial for good quality and market value.

### Maturity Signs of Banana

The maturity of banana fruits is assessed based on several visual and tactile indicators, as bananas are typically harvested at a "green mature" stage before full ripening on the plant.

1.  **Angularity of Fingers:** This is the most reliable indicator. Immature fruits are distinctly angular. As they mature, the fingers become progressively **rounder and plumper**, losing their sharp angularity.
2.  **Filling of Fingers:** The pulp inside the fruit fills out, making the fingers feel firm and turgid when gently squeezed.
3.  **Colour Change:** The deep green colour of the skin starts to lighten, becoming a **lighter green** or sometimes showing a slight yellowish tinge, especially at the tips or base, depending on the variety.
4.  **Dry Perianth:** The dried floral remnants (perianth) at the tip of the fruit become **dry and easily detachable**.
5.  **Days from Flowering:** While not a direct visual sign, for most commercial varieties grown in Haryana, the bunch is ready for harvest approximately **90-120 days** after the emergence of the last hand (female flowers). This can vary slightly with variety and prevailing weather conditions.

### Harvesting Time

The optimal harvesting time largely depends on the intended market and distance to market.

1.  **For Local Markets (within Haryana):** Bananas can be harvested at **3/4th to full maturity**. This means the fingers are well-rounded, light green, and show good filling. This allows for quicker ripening and consumption.
2.  **For Distant Markets or Processing:** It is crucial to harvest at **3/4th maturity (green mature stage)**. At this stage, the fruits are well-developed, firm, and green, but not yet showing signs of ripening. This allows for sufficient shelf life during transit and controlled ripening at the destination. Harvesting too early leads to poor quality and taste, while harvesting too late can result in premature ripening and damage during transport.
3.  **Time of Day:** Harvesting is best done in the **cooler parts of the day**, either early morning or late afternoon, to minimize heat stress on the fruit and reduce field heat.

### Cutting Process

The cutting process involves carefully detaching the banana bunch from the plant and, subsequently, separating the hands or individual fingers if required for packing.

1.  **Preparation:**
    *   Ensure you have a **sharp knife or sickle** and a helper.
    *   Prepare a soft landing area (e.g., a bed of straw, dry leaves, or a padded surface) to prevent bruising when the bunch falls.
2.  **Cutting the Bunch from the Plant:**
    *   The helper should support the bunch to prevent it from falling abruptly and getting damaged.
    *   Make a clean cut on the **peduncle (bunch stalk)**, approximately **15-30 cm above the first hand**. This ensures enough stalk remains for handling and prevents damage to the top hands.
    *   Carefully lower the bunch onto the prepared soft surface.
3.  **Post-Harvest Plant Management:**
    *   After harvesting the bunch, the **mother plant should be cut down** at ground level. This encourages the growth of new suckers (ratoons) for the next crop cycle and prevents the plant from becoming a host for pests and diseases.
4.  **De-handing (Separating Hands):**
    *   For commercial packing, the bunch is often "de-handed," meaning individual hands are separated from the main stalk.
    *   Use a sharp knife to cut the **"cushion"** (the part where the hand attaches to the main stalk) cleanly, leaving a small portion of the cushion attached to the hand. This prevents sap exudation and potential rot.
5.  **Washing and Packing:**
    *   Immediately after de-handing, the hands should be **washed in clean water** to remove latex (sap) and dirt. For commercial operations, a fungicidal dip (e.g., **carbendazim** at 0.5 g/L or **thiophanate-methyl** at 0.5 g/L) is often used to prevent crown rot, followed by drying before packing.
    *   Pack the hands carefully in appropriate cartons or crates to prevent bruising during transport.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure optimal quality and shelf life for your banana produce.
