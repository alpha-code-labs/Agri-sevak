As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies in Banana cultivation in Haryana.

### Control of Beetles and Weevils in Banana

The primary beetle/weevil pest of concern in banana cultivation in Haryana and India is the **Banana Weevil (Cosmopolites sordidus)**, also known as the Banana Root Borer. This pest causes significant damage by boring into the corm and pseudostem, leading to reduced plant vigour, toppling of plants, and yield loss.

An Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is recommended for effective and sustainable control:

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**

*   **Use Healthy Planting Material:** Always use weevil-free suckers. Inspect suckers thoroughly for any signs of weevil damage (tunnels, grubs).
*   **Paring and Hot Water Treatment:** Before planting, pare off the outer layers of suckers to remove any weevil eggs or larvae. Dipping suckers in hot water (54°C for 20 minutes) can also kill weevils without harming the plant.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy old pseudostems, crop residues, and severely infested plants immediately after harvest. This reduces breeding sites for the weevils.
*   **Trapping:** Use pseudostem traps by splitting sections of banana pseudostems (about 50-60 cm long) lengthwise and placing them cut-side down on the soil near the base of infested plants. Weevils are attracted to these traps and can be collected and destroyed daily.
*   **Crop Rotation:** While bananas are perennial, rotating with non-host crops in new plantings can help reduce pest build-up.

**2. Chemical Control (as a last resort or in conjunction with cultural methods for severe infestations):**

When chemical intervention is necessary, use CIBRC approved technical chemicals at recommended dosages. These are typically applied as a drench around the base of the plant or for sucker treatment.

*   **For Sucker Treatment (Dipping before planting):**
    *   Dip suckers in a solution of **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** at 5 ml/L of water for 15-20 minutes.
    *   Alternatively, use **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL** at 0.5 ml/L of water for 15-20 minutes.

*   **For Field Application (Drenching around the plant base):**
    *   Apply **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** at 2.5 ml/L of water, drenching 2-3 litres of solution per plant around the base, especially during periods of high weevil activity.
    *   Alternatively, use **Fipronil 5% SC** at 1.5-2 ml/L of water, drenching 2-3 litres per plant.
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL** can be used as a drench at 0.5 ml/L of water, applying 2-3 litres per plant.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG** can be applied as a drench at 0.5 g/L of water, applying 2-3 litres per plant.

**Important Considerations for Chemical Use:**
*   Always read and follow the label instructions carefully.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application.
*   Observe pre-harvest intervals (PHI) to ensure fruit safety.
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

### Control of Sawflies in Banana

This is not known to affect Banana. Sawflies are typically pests of broadleaf trees, conifers, and some herbaceous plants, but are not recognized as a significant pest of banana.

For specific local recommendations and current pest pressure assessments, it is always advisable to consult with your local agricultural extension officer or the scientists at HAU, Hisar.
