Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling soil pests like termites and root-knot nematodes in banana cultivation in Haryana. Effective management requires an integrated approach combining cultural practices with judicious use of CIBRC-approved chemical solutions.

Here's how to control these soil pests:

### 1. Control of Termites (e.g., *Odontotermes obesus*, *Microtermes obesi*)

Termites can cause significant damage by attacking the roots, pseudostem base, and suckers, leading to weakening, poor nutrient uptake, and even death of the banana plants.

**Cultural and Preventive Measures:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove all plant debris, stumps, and other organic matter from the field before planting, as these can serve as food sources and breeding sites for termites.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** Expose termite colonies to sunlight and predators by deep ploughing the field during summer.
*   **Healthy Planting Material:** Ensure planting material (suckers) is free from termite infestation.

**Chemical Control:**
For effective chemical control, apply the following CIBRC-approved insecticides:

*   **At Planting:**
    *   Drench the planting pit with a solution of **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** at 2.5 ml per litre of water. Use approximately 1-2 litres of this solution per pit before planting the sucker.
*   **Post-Planting (if infestation is observed):**
    *   Drench the soil around the base of the affected plants with **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** at 2.5 L per acre mixed in 500-1000 L of water.
    *   Alternatively, apply **Fipronil 0.3% GR** at 10-15 kg per acre by broadcasting around the plant base and lightly incorporating it into the soil, followed by irrigation.

### 2. Control of Nematodes (Root-knot Nematodes, *Meloidogyne* spp.)

Root-knot nematodes are microscopic worms that infect banana roots, causing characteristic galls or knots. This impairs the plant's ability to absorb water and nutrients, leading to stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, reduced bunch size, and overall yield loss.

**Cultural and Preventive Measures:**
*   **Use Healthy Planting Material:** Always use nematode-free suckers or tissue-cultured plantlets. Hot water treatment of suckers (55°C for 20 minutes) can help eliminate nematodes.
*   **Crop Rotation:** If feasible, rotate banana with non-host crops like marigold, maize, or sorghum for 2-3 years to reduce nematode populations in the soil.
*   **Organic Matter:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost at 10-15 tonnes per acre. Organic matter improves soil health and promotes beneficial microorganisms that can suppress nematodes.
*   **Solarization:** During summer, cover the moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks to raise soil temperature and kill nematodes.

**Chemical Control:**
For chemical management of root-knot nematodes, consider the following CIBRC-approved nematicides:

*   **At Planting:**
    *   Apply **Fluopyram 34.48% SC** as a soil drench at 500-600 ml per acre, mixed in sufficient water, around the planting pit or plant base. This can be done at planting or 2-3 months after planting.
    *   Alternatively, apply **Ethoprophos 10% GR** at 10-20 kg per acre by broadcasting around the planting pit and incorporating it into the soil, followed by irrigation.
    *   **Carbofuran 3% CG** can also be used at 33 kg per acre, applied in a ring around the plant base and lightly incorporated into the soil, followed by irrigation. *Please note: While Carbofuran is effective, it is a restricted-use pesticide due to its toxicity. Use with extreme caution and strictly follow safety guidelines.*

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Integrated Pest Management (IPM):** Always combine cultural, biological, and chemical methods for sustainable and effective pest control.
*   **Safety Precautions:** When handling any chemical, always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (gloves, mask, protective clothing) and follow the instructions on the product label strictly.
*   **Timing:** Apply chemicals at the recommended stage and frequency for optimal results and to minimize environmental impact.
*   **Soil Testing:** Regular soil testing can help determine the nematode population levels and guide your management decisions.
