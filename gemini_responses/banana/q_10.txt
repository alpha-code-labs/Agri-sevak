As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling these conditions in Banana cultivation in Haryana:

### Control of Borers in Banana

Borers in banana primarily refer to the Banana pseudostem weevil (Odoiporus longicollis) and the Banana rhizome weevil (Cosmopolites sordidus).

**Cultural Practices:**
*   Maintain field sanitation by removing dried leaves, pseudostem sheaths, and plant debris.
*   Remove and destroy severely infested plants to prevent further spread.
*   Use pheromone traps for monitoring and mass trapping of adult weevils.

**Chemical Control:**
*   **For Pseudostem Weevil:**
    *   Swab the pseudostem with a solution of **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 2.5 ml/L of water, starting from the 3rd month after planting and repeating every 45 days.
*   **For Rhizome Weevil:**
    *   Apply **Fipronil** 0.3% GR at 10-15 kg/acre near the base of the plant and irrigate, or drench the base of the plant with **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 2.5 ml/L of water.

### Control of Caterpillars and Leaf Folder in Banana

Caterpillars causing defoliation and leaf folding/rolling in banana are primarily the Banana leaf roller (Erionota thrax).

**Cultural Practices:**
*   Regularly monitor plants for folded leaves or feeding damage.
*   Hand-pick and destroy visible larvae in the early stages of infestation.
*   Remove and destroy severely infested leaves to reduce pest population.

**Chemical Control:**
*   Spray with **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC at 0.3 ml/L of water.
*   Alternatively, spray with **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG at 0.4 g/L of water.
*   Another option is to spray with **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 1 ml/L of water.

### Control of Diamondback Moth in Banana

This is not known to affect Banana.
