As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fruit flies and addressing the query about Ber fly in Banana cultivation in Haryana.

### Control of Fruit Fly in Banana

Fruit flies (e.g., *Bactrocera dorsalis*, *Bactrocera zonata*) can be a significant pest in banana, causing damage to ripening fruits. An integrated pest management (IPM) approach is recommended for effective control.

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Regularly collect and destroy all fallen, damaged, or infested fruits by burying them deep in the soil or burning them. This breaks the life cycle of the pest.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** After harvest, deep ploughing can expose pupae in the soil to predators and adverse weather conditions.
*   **Bagging of Fruit Bunches:** For smaller scale cultivation, covering the developing banana bunches with paper or cloth bags can physically prevent fruit fly oviposition.
*   **Pheromone Traps:** Install methyl eugenol-based pheromone traps at a density of 10-15 traps per acre to monitor and mass-trap male fruit flies. Replace the lure every 2-3 weeks.

**2. Chemical Control (as part of bait sprays):**
For effective and targeted control, bait sprays are highly recommended. These involve mixing a small quantity of insecticide with a protein source (like jaggery or protein hydrolysate) to attract and kill the flies. Apply these bait sprays as spots on the leaves or non-bearing plants, not directly on the fruit, especially close to harvest.

*   **Malathion 50% EC:** Mix 2 ml of **Malathion 50% EC** per litre of water along with 100 g of jaggery or protein hydrolysate per litre of water. Apply this mixture as spot sprays (e.g., 100 ml per spot) on 5-10 plants per acre, preferably in the morning. Repeat every 7-10 days if infestation persists.
*   **Spinosad 45% SC:** Mix 0.2-0.3 ml of **Spinosad 45% SC** per litre of water along with 100 g of jaggery or protein hydrolysate per litre of water. Apply this mixture as spot sprays (e.g., 100 ml per spot) on 5-10 plants per acre. Repeat every 7-10 days if infestation persists.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always follow the instructions on the pesticide label regarding dosage, application, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.

### Control of Ber Fly in Banana

This is not known to affect Banana. Ber fly (*Carpomyia vesuviana*) is a specific pest primarily of Ber (*Ziziphus mauritiana*) and does not infest banana.
