Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding sucking pests in banana cultivation. Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, Thrips, and Psylla can cause significant damage by directly feeding on plant sap, leading to stunted growth, leaf curling, yellowing, and even transmitting viral diseases. Thrips are particularly notorious for causing scarring on banana fruits.

Effective management of these pests requires an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical control methods.

### Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Sucking Pests in Banana:

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**

*   **Regular Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your banana plants, especially young leaves, pseudostems, and the undersides of leaves, for the presence of pests. Early detection is key.
*   **Weed Management:** Keep the banana plantation and surrounding areas free of weeds, as many weeds act as alternate hosts for these sucking pests.
*   **Proper Nutrition:** Ensure balanced fertilization to maintain plant vigour. Over-fertilization with nitrogen can sometimes make plants more attractive to sucking pests.
*   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy heavily infested leaves or plant parts to reduce pest populations.
*   **Yellow Sticky Traps:** Install yellow sticky traps (10-15 traps per acre) to monitor and mass-trap adult whiteflies, thrips, and leafhoppers.

**2. Biological Control:**

*   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Protect and encourage natural predators like ladybird beetles, lacewings, hoverfly larvae, and parasitic wasps, which feed on aphids, whiteflies, and other soft-bodied insects. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.
*   **Biopesticides:** In cases of low to moderate infestation, consider using entomopathogenic fungi like *Beauveria bassiana* or *Verticillium lecanii*. These are effective against various sucking pests.
    *   **Beauveria bassiana (1% WP):** Apply at 2.5 kg per acre mixed in 200-400 litres of water.
    *   **Verticillium lecanii (1% WP):** Apply at 2.5 kg per acre mixed in 200-400 litres of water.
    *   *Note: Apply biopesticides during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) for best results.*

**3. Chemical Control (When necessary):**

If pest populations exceed economic threshold levels and cultural/biological methods are insufficient, chemical intervention may be required. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where pests often reside.

Here are some CIBRC approved technical chemical names effective against sucking pests in banana:

*   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at 0.5 - 1.0 ml per litre of water. Effective against aphids, leafhoppers, whiteflies, thrips, and psylla.
*   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at 0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water. Provides excellent control of aphids, leafhoppers, whiteflies, thrips, and psylla.
*   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply at 0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water. Good for controlling aphids, whiteflies, and thrips.
*   **Fipronil 5% SC:** Apply at 1.5 - 2.0 ml per litre of water. Particularly effective against thrips, and also controls aphids and leafhoppers.
*   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** Apply at 0.5 - 1.0 ml per litre of water. Highly effective against whiteflies (nymphs and adults) and mites.
*   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at 1.25 - 1.5 ml per litre of water. An insect growth regulator primarily effective against whitefly nymphs and hoppers.

**Important Precautions for Chemical Application:**

*   **Safety First:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including gloves, mask, and protective clothing during mixing and spraying.
*   **Timing of Spray:** Spray during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy, and to protect pollinators.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Strictly observe the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) mentioned on the insecticide label to ensure the produce is safe for consumption.
*   **Rotation:** Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance in pests.
*   **Calibration:** Ensure your sprayer is properly calibrated for uniform application.
