As a Senior Agronomist, I must emphasize that there is no chemical cure for viral diseases in plants, including banana. The control strategies primarily focus on prevention, managing vectors, and removing infected plants to prevent further spread.

Here's how to control the mentioned viral diseases in Banana, based on scientifically verified advice for Haryana:

**1. Leaf curl (Banana Bunchy Top Virus - BBTV) & Stunt virus (Banana Bunchy Top Virus - BBTV):**
*   **Cause:** Banana Bunchy Top Virus (BBTV).
*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, dark green streaks on petioles and midribs, upward curling and brittleness of leaves, and a characteristic "bunchy top" appearance due to short internodes.
*   **Transmission:** Primarily by the banana aphid (*Pentalonia nigronervosa*).

**2. Mosaic (Cucumber Mosaic Virus - CMV):**
*   **Cause:** Cucumber Mosaic Virus (CMV).
*   **Symptoms:** Yellowish-green mosaic patterns on leaves, leaf distortion, and overall stunting of the plant.
*   **Transmission:** Transmitted by several aphid species (e.g., *Aphis gossypii*, *Myzus persicae*) and through infected suckers.

**3. Yellow vein clearing & Stripe (Banana Streak Virus - BSV):**
*   **Cause:** Banana Streak Virus (BSV).
*   **Symptoms:** Yellow streaks on leaves that often turn necrotic (brown/black), stunting, and sometimes distortion of fruit.
*   **Transmission:** Primarily by mealybugs (e.g., *Planococcus citri*, *Dysmicoccus brevipes*). Some BSV strains are also integrated into the banana genome and can be activated by stress or transmitted through infected planting material.

**4. Tristeza:**
*   This is not known to affect Banana. Tristeza is a viral disease primarily affecting citrus plants.

**General Control Measures for Viral Diseases in Banana:**

The management of viral diseases in banana relies on an integrated approach:

1.  **Use Virus-Free Planting Material:**
    *   This is the most critical step. Always use certified virus-free tissue culture plantlets obtained from reputable nurseries. Avoid using suckers from unknown or potentially infected plants.

2.  **Vector Control:**
    *   Regularly monitor your banana plants for the presence of aphid and mealybug vectors.
    *   Apply appropriate insecticides to control vector populations, especially during the early stages of crop growth or when vector populations are high.
    *   **For Aphids (vectors of BBTV, CMV):**
        *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL at 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water (foliar spray) or 1.0-2.0 ml/plant (drenching around the base).
        *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG at 0.2-0.4 g/L of water (foliar spray).
        *   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP at 0.2 g/L of water (foliar spray).
    *   **For Mealybugs (vectors of BSV):**
        *   **Buprofezin** 25% SC at 1.25-1.5 ml/L of water (foliar spray, acts as an insect growth regulator).
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 0.5 ml/L of water (foliar spray, for direct contact kill).

3.  **Rouging and Sanitation:**
    *   **Regular Inspection:** Inspect your banana plants frequently (at least once a week) for any symptoms of viral diseases.
    *   **Immediate Removal:** As soon as symptoms are observed, immediately uproot and destroy the entire infected plant, including its suckers. Before uprooting, spray the infected plant with an insecticide to kill any vectors present and prevent their spread to healthy plants.
    *   **Destruction:** Infected plants should be buried deep or burned away from the field. Do not leave them in the field as they can be a source of inoculum.
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the field free of weeds, as many weeds can act as alternate hosts for viruses and their vectors.
    *   **Volunteer Plants:** Remove and destroy any volunteer banana plants or wild *Musa* species in and around the plantation.

4.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Ensure balanced nutrition for your banana plants. Healthy, vigorous plants are generally more tolerant to stress, although this does not confer resistance to viral infections.

By strictly adhering to these integrated management practices, you can significantly reduce the incidence and spread of viral diseases in your banana plantation.
