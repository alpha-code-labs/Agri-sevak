Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling mites in Banana cultivation in Haryana. Both Red Spider Mite (Tetranychus urticae) and Rust Mite (Phyllocoptruta musae) are significant pests of banana.

### Symptoms of Mite Infestation:

*   **Red Spider Mite:** These tiny mites are usually found on the underside of leaves. They cause yellowing, bronzing, or stippling on the leaves. In severe infestations, fine webbing may be visible, and leaves can turn brown and drop prematurely, affecting photosynthesis and fruit development.
*   **Rust Mite:** These microscopic mites are difficult to see with the naked eye. They primarily attack the fruit surface, causing a characteristic reddish-brown, rusty discoloration or scabbing. On leaves, they can cause a silvery or rusty appearance, particularly along the midrib and veins. Severe infestation can lead to fruit cracking and reduced market value.

### Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategy for Mites in Banana:

An integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods is most effective for sustainable mite management.

#### 1. Cultural Practices:

*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy severely infested leaves and plant debris to reduce mite populations and breeding sites.
*   **Proper Irrigation:** Maintain adequate soil moisture. Overhead irrigation or misting can help dislodge spider mites and increase humidity, which is unfavorable for them.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, as it can promote lush growth that is more attractive to mites. Ensure balanced nutrition to maintain plant vigor.
*   **Pruning:** Remove old, senescent, or heavily infested leaves to improve air circulation and reduce mite habitats.

#### 2. Biological Control:

*   **Natural Enemies:** Encourage natural predators like predatory mites (e.g., *Amblyseius* species), ladybird beetles, and lacewings, which feed on pest mites. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

#### 3. Chemical Control (Acaricides):

When mite populations reach damaging levels, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always rotate different classes of acaricides to prevent the development of resistance. Apply thoroughly, ensuring good coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and fruit surfaces.

Here are some CIBRC approved technical chemical names and their recommended dosages:

*   **For Red Spider Mite and Rust Mite:**
    *   **Wettable Sulphur (80% WP):** Apply at 2.0-3.0 g/L of water. Sulphur is particularly effective against rust mites and also has some fungicidal properties.
    *   **Propargite (57% EC):** Apply at 1.0-1.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Spiromesifen (22.9% SC):** Apply at 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water.

*   **For Red Spider Mite (and generally effective against other mites):**
    *   **Abamectin (1.9% EC):** Apply at 0.3-0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Fenpyroximate (5% EC):** Apply at 1.0-1.5 ml/L of water.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Timing of Application:** Apply acaricides when mite populations are building up, before they cause severe damage.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough coverage of all plant parts, especially the undersides of leaves and the fruit surface, where mites are most active.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, and protective clothing while handling and applying chemicals. Follow the instructions and safety precautions mentioned on the product label.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Observe the specified pre-harvest interval for each chemical to ensure the fruit is safe for consumption.

For specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions, it is always advisable to consult with local agricultural extension officers or HAU experts.
