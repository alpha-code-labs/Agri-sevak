As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Barley (Jau) in Haryana:

It is important to correctly identify the pest before applying any control measures. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategies, including cultural practices, biological control, and judicious use of chemical control, are always recommended for sustainable pest management.

Here's the specific guidance for each mentioned pest:

### Borers and Caterpillars

While borers are generally not a major pest of Barley (Jau) in Haryana, occasional infestations by species like the Pink Stem Borer (*Sesamia inferens*) can occur, particularly if other cereal crops in the vicinity are heavily infested. Caterpillars, especially Armyworms (*Mythimna separata*), can occasionally cause significant defoliation in Barley (Jau) fields, particularly during outbreaks. Early detection and timely intervention are crucial for both.

For the control of borers and caterpillars (lepidopteran pests), if infestation levels warrant intervention, the following CIBRC-approved technical chemicals can be used:

*   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC: Apply at 60 ml per acre.
*   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG: Apply at 88-100 g per acre.
*   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: Apply at 100-120 ml per acre.
*   **Indoxacarb** 14.5% SC: Apply at 200 ml per acre.

Ensure thorough coverage of the crop during spraying. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions.

### Diamondback Moth

Diamondback moth (*Plutella xylostella*) is a specific pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., mustard, cabbage, cauliflower) and **is not known to affect Barley (Jau).** Therefore, no control measures are required for this pest in barley.

### Leaf Folder

Leaf folders, such as the Rice Leaf Folder (*Cnaphalocrocis medinalis*), are primarily pests of rice and other specific grass species. They **are not known to be significant pests of Barley (Jau)** in Haryana, and their economic impact on barley is negligible. Therefore, specific control measures for leaf folders are generally not required in barley.
