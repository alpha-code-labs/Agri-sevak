Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I advise an integrated approach for managing sucking pests in Barley (Jau) to ensure sustainable and effective control.

Regarding your query about Psylla:
This is not known to affect Barley (Jau).

For the control of other sucking pests like Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips in Barley (Jau), please follow these guidelines:

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Practices:**

1.  **Regular Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your barley fields, especially the undersides of leaves and tender shoots, for the presence of pests. Early detection is crucial for effective management.
2.  **Resistant Varieties:** Where available and suitable for your region, consider planting barley varieties known to have resistance or tolerance to common sucking pests.
3.  **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, as it can lead to lush growth that attracts sucking pests. Maintain balanced nutrient application based on soil test recommendations.
4.  **Weed Control:** Keep the field and surrounding areas free of weeds, as many weeds can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
5.  **Conservation of Natural Enemies:** Protect beneficial insects like ladybird beetles, lacewings, and hoverfly larvae, which prey on aphids and other soft-bodied insects. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides unless absolutely necessary.
6.  **Timely Sowing:** Adhere to recommended sowing dates for barley in Haryana, as off-season planting can sometimes increase pest incidence.

**Chemical Control (If necessary, upon reaching Economic Threshold Level):**

If the pest population crosses the economic threshold level and cultural/biological methods are insufficient, chemical intervention may be required. Always ensure thorough spray coverage.

*   **For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips:**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at a rate of 100-125 ml per acre, mixed in 200-250 litres of water.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at a rate of 50 g per acre, mixed in 200-250 litres of water.
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply at a rate of 80-100 g per acre, mixed in 200-250 litres of water.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in pests.
*   Consult your local Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and the prevailing pest situation.
