As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend the following doses for organic manures and bio-stimulants in Barley (Jau) cultivation in Haryana to improve soil health, nutrient availability, and crop yield:

**1. Farmyard Manure (FYM)**
Well-decomposed Farmyard Manure (FYM) should be incorporated into the soil at least 2-3 weeks before sowing.
*   **Recommended Dose:** 10-15 tonnes per acre

**2. Vermicompost**
Vermicompost, being richer in nutrients than FYM, can be applied at lower rates.
*   **Recommended Dose:** 2-4 tonnes per acre

**3. Sagarika (Seaweed Extract based Bio-stimulant)**
Sagarika is a seaweed extract-based bio-stimulant, not a bulk organic manure like FYM or vermicompost. It enhances nutrient uptake, promotes root growth, and improves plant vigor. It is typically applied as a foliar spray, seed treatment, or soil application.

*   **Foliar Spray:**
    *   **Recommended Dose:** 250-500 ml per acre, mixed in 150-200 litres of water.
    *   **Application Timing:**
        *   First spray: At tillering stage (25-30 days after sowing).
        *   Second spray: At booting/flag leaf stage (50-60 days after sowing).
*   **Seed Treatment:**
    *   **Recommended Dose:** 10-20 ml per kg of seed.
    *   **Application Method:** Mix the recommended quantity of Sagarika with the seeds just before sowing.
*   **Soil Application/Drenching:**
    *   **Recommended Dose:** 1-2 litres per acre, mixed with irrigation water or applied as a drench around the root zone.
    *   **Application Timing:** At sowing or early growth stages.
