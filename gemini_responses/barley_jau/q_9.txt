Mites, including Red spider mite (*Tetranychus urticae*) and various rust mites, can infest Barley (Jau), especially under dry and warm conditions, leading to significant yield losses if not managed effectively.

Here's a scientifically verified approach for their control:

**1. Monitoring and Cultural Practices:**
*   **Regular Scouting:** Frequently inspect the underside of leaves for the presence of mites, their eggs, and characteristic damage like stippling (tiny yellow or white spots) or fine webbing (for red spider mites). Early detection is crucial.
*   **Water Management:** Ensure adequate irrigation to reduce plant stress, as stressed plants are more susceptible to mite infestations.
*   **Field Hygiene:** Remove weeds from around the field, as many weeds can serve as alternate hosts for mites.

**2. Chemical Control (Acaricides):**
Apply acaricides when mite populations reach economic threshold levels. Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the underside of leaves where mites primarily reside. Always use CIBRC approved products and follow label instructions for dosage and safety.

*   **For Red Spider Mite and Rust Mite:**
    *   **Spiromesifen** (e.g., 11.25% SC formulation): Apply at a rate of 125-150 ml per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water.
    *   **Fenpyroximate** (e.g., 5% SC formulation): Apply at a rate of 250-300 ml per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water.
    *   **Propargite** (e.g., 57% EC formulation): Apply at a rate of 1.0-1.25 litres per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water.

*   **Specifically for Rust Mites and General Mite Suppression (also helps with Powdery Mildew):**
    *   **Wettable Sulphur** (e.g., 80% WP formulation): Apply at a rate of 1.5-2.0 kg per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water. This is a good option for early infestations and as part of an integrated pest management strategy.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Rotation of Acaricides:** To prevent the development of resistance, rotate acaricides with different modes of action. Do not use the same chemical repeatedly.
*   **Timing of Application:** Apply acaricides at the first sign of infestation to prevent rapid population buildup and significant damage.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and application. Observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) specified on the product label to ensure the safety of the harvested grain.
