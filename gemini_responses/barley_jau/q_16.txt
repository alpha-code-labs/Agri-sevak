As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified fertilizer doses for Barley (Jau) in Haryana. Please note that these are general recommendations for irrigated conditions; precise doses should always be based on a recent soil test report from a certified laboratory.

**Importance of Soil Testing:**
A soil test is crucial to determine the exact nutrient status of your field (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, Sulphur, and micronutrients) and allows for tailored fertilizer application, optimizing nutrient use efficiency and minimizing environmental impact.

**General Nutrient Targets for Irrigated Barley:**
*   Nitrogen (N): 60 kg/acre
*   Phosphorus (P2O5): 24 kg/acre
*   Potassium (K2O): 12 kg/acre (if soil test indicates low to medium K)
*   Sulphur (S): 8-10 kg/acre

**Recommended Fertilizer Doses (Choose ONE of the following options for basal application):**

**Option 1: Using DAP, Urea, Muriate of Potash, and Sulphur**

*   **Basal Application (at sowing):**
    *   **DAP**: 50-55 kg/acre
    *   **Muriate of Potash (MOP)**: 20 kg/acre (Apply if soil test indicates low to medium K. If soil K is high, this can be reduced or omitted.)
    *   **Bentonite Sulphur** (90% S): 8-10 kg/acre
    *   **Urea**: 55 kg/acre (This is half of the total recommended Urea)

*   **Top-dressing (at first irrigation, approximately 25-30 days after sowing):**
    *   **Urea**: 55 kg/acre (Remaining half of the total recommended Urea)

**Option 2: Using SSP, Urea, and Muriate of Potash**

*   **Basal Application (at sowing):**
    *   **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)**: 150 kg/acre (This provides both Phosphorus and Sulphur)
    *   **Muriate of Potash (MOP)**: 20 kg/acre (Apply if soil test indicates low to medium K. If soil K is high, this can be reduced or omitted.)
    *   **Urea**: 65 kg/acre (This is half of the total recommended Urea)

*   **Top-dressing (at first irrigation, approximately 25-30 days after sowing):**
    *   **Urea**: 65 kg/acre (Remaining half of the total recommended Urea)

**Nano-Fertilizers (As Supplements):**

Nano-fertilizers are primarily recommended as foliar sprays to supplement the nutrient requirements and enhance nutrient use efficiency, not as a complete replacement for granular fertilizers.

*   **Nano-Urea (Liquid, 4% N):**
    *   **Dose**: 2-4 ml/L of water.
    *   **Application**: Two foliar sprays.
        *   First spray: At tillering stage (around 30-40 DAS).
        *   Second spray: At booting/flag leaf stage (around 60-70 DAS).
    *   **Quantity**: Typically, one 500 ml bottle of **Nano-Urea** per acre per spray, mixed in 100-150 L of water.
    *   **Note**: Can partially replace 25-50% of the top-dressed granular urea, but it is advisable to use it as a supplement for best results.

*   **Nano-DAP (Liquid, 8% N, 16% P2O5):**
    *   **Dose**: 2-4 ml/L of water.
    *   **Application**: Two foliar sprays.
        *   First spray: At tillering stage (around 30-40 DAS).
        *   Second spray: At pre-flowering/grain filling stage (around 60-80 DAS).
    *   **Quantity**: Typically, one 500 ml bottle of **Nano-DAP** per acre per spray, mixed in 100-150 L of water.
    *   **Note**: Used as a supplement to basal **DAP** application to boost phosphorus and nitrogen availability during critical growth stages.

**NPK Complex Fertilizers:**

Various grades of NPK complex fertilizers (e.g., 12:32:16, 10:26:26, 19:19:19) are available. If you choose to use an NPK complex fertilizer, calculate the amount needed to meet the Phosphorus (P2O5) requirement first, and then supplement with **Urea**, **Muriate of Potash**, and **Sulphur** as necessary to meet the remaining nutrient targets.

*   **Example (using NPK 12:32:16):**
    *   To meet 24 kg P2O5 requirement: Approximately 75 kg of **NPK (12:32:16)** per acre.
    *   This 75 kg **NPK (12:32:16)** will provide about 9 kg N and 12 kg K2O.
    *   You would then need to supplement with approximately 110 kg **Urea** (to provide the remaining 51 kg N) and 8-10 kg **Bentonite Sulphur** (if not already covered by other sources or soil test).

**Sulphur:**

Sulphur is an essential nutrient for protein synthesis and oil content. If you are not using **SSP** (which contains Sulphur), it is highly recommended to apply 8-10 kg of Sulphur per acre through sources like **Bentonite Sulphur** (90% S) or **Gypsum** (13% S).

---

**Potash:**

Potassium (K) is vital for disease resistance, stalk strength, and grain filling. While many Haryana soils are medium to high in K, application of **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** at 20 kg/acre is recommended if your soil test indicates low to medium K levels.

---

**Micronutrients:**

If your soil test indicates deficiencies in micronutrients like Zinc (Zn), Manganese (Mn), or Iron (Fe), apply them as per recommendations. For example, 10 kg **Zinc Sulphate heptahydrate** (21% Zn) or 6.5 kg **Zinc Sulphate monohydrate** (33% Zn) per acre can be applied basally if Zn deficiency is observed.
