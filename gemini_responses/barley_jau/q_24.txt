Barley (Jau) is primarily a direct-sown crop and is not typically transplanted in commercial agriculture, especially in Haryana. Transplanting barley is generally not recommended due to potential root damage, increased labor costs, and reduced yield efficiency compared to direct sowing.

Therefore, instead of transplantation, the following are the ideal practices for direct sowing of Barley (Jau):

**1. Ideal Sowing Time:**
*   **Optimal Period:** Mid-October to Mid-November.
*   **Late Sowing:** Can be done up to the first week of December, but may result in reduced yields.

**2. Ideal Sowing Distance (Spacing):**
*   **Row-to-Row Spacing:** 20-22.5 cm.
*   **Plant-to-Plant Spacing:** Not specifically managed for barley; uniform seed distribution is achieved through appropriate seed rate and sowing method.

**3. Ideal Sowing Process:**
*   **Method:** Line sowing using a seed drill is the most recommended method for uniform seed distribution and proper depth. Broadcasting can also be done but is less efficient.
*   **Seed Depth:** 4-6 cm.
*   **Seed Rate:**
    *   **Normal Sowing:** 100 kg/acre.
    *   **Late Sowing:** 120 kg/acre.
    *   **For Malting Varieties:** 80-90 kg/acre (to ensure proper grain development and uniformity).
