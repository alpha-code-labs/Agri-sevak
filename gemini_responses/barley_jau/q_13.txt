Fruit flies (e.g., *Bactrocera* species) are primarily pests of horticultural crops such as fruits (mango, guava, citrus) and vegetables (cucurbits). Ber fly (*Carpomyia vesuviana*) is a specific pest of Ber (Ziziphus mauritiana) fruit. Neither of these insect pests are known to infest or cause damage to cereal crops like Barley (Jau).
