As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Barley (Jau) in Haryana:

### Control Measures for Pests in Barley (Jau)

**1. Grasshopper**
Grasshoppers can cause significant defoliation in barley, especially during early growth stages or in outbreak situations.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Deep ploughing after harvest can expose grasshopper eggs to predators and adverse weather conditions, reducing their population for the next season.
    *   Maintain field sanitation and remove weeds that can serve as alternate hosts.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   In case of severe infestation, chemical intervention may be necessary. Apply insecticides when nymphs or adults are actively feeding.
    *   **Malathion** 50% EC: Apply at a rate of 1.0 - 1.25 litres per acre, mixed in 200-400 litres of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: Apply at a rate of 200-250 ml per acre, mixed in 200-400 litres of water.

**2. Painted bug**
This is not known to affect Barley (Jau). Painted bug (Bagrada hilaris) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops like mustard, radish, and cabbage.

**3. Red cotton bug**
This is not known to affect Barley (Jau). Red cotton bug (Dysdercus cingulatus) is primarily a pest of cotton and other malvaceous plants.

**4. Black ants**
This is not known to affect Barley (Jau) as a direct pest causing significant economic damage to the crop itself. While ants may be present in fields, they typically do not feed on barley plants or cause direct harm that warrants specific control measures. They are often associated with tending other sap-sucking insects like aphids for honeydew, in which case controlling the primary pest (aphids) would be the focus.
