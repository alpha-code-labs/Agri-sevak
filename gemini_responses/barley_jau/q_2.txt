As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling rust diseases in Barley (Jau) in Haryana.

Rust diseases can significantly impact barley yield. Regular field monitoring and timely intervention are crucial.

Here's how to manage the rust diseases relevant to Barley (Jau):

### 1. Black Rust (Stem Rust)
*   **Causal Agent:** *Puccinia graminis f.sp. tritici*
*   **Symptoms:** Elongated, reddish-brown pustules appear on stems, leaf sheaths, and sometimes on leaves and heads. These pustules later turn black.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Cultural Practices:**
        *   Cultivate resistant varieties recommended for Haryana, such as BH 902, BH 946, BH 393.
        *   Ensure timely sowing as per recommended dates for your region.
        *   Maintain balanced nutrition, avoiding excessive nitrogen application.
    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   Apply fungicides at the first appearance of symptoms. Repeat application after 15-20 days if the disease persists or conditions are favorable for its spread.
        *   **Propiconazole** 25% EC: 500 ml per acre in 200-250 litres of water.
        *   **Tebuconazole** 25% WG: 250 g per acre in 200-250 litres of water.
        *   **Difenoconazole** 25% EC: 200 ml per acre in 200-250 litres of water.

### 2. Brown Rust (Leaf Rust)
*   **Causal Agent:** *Puccinia hordei*
*   **Symptoms:** Small, circular to oval, orange-brown pustules scattered randomly on the upper surface of leaves.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Cultural Practices:**
        *   Cultivate resistant varieties like BH 902, BH 946, BH 393.
        *   Follow recommended sowing dates.
    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   Apply fungicides at the first appearance of symptoms. Repeat application after 15-20 days if necessary.
        *   **Propiconazole** 25% EC: 500 ml per acre in 200-250 litres of water.
        *   **Tebuconazole** 25% WG: 250 g per acre in 200-250 litres of water.
        *   **Difenoconazole** 25% EC: 200 ml per acre in 200-250 litres of water.

### 3. Yellow Rust (Stripe Rust)
*   **Causal Agent:** *Puccinia striiformis f.sp. hordei*
*   **Symptoms:** Yellow-orange pustules arranged in characteristic stripes or streaks on leaves, often appearing in cooler weather.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Cultural Practices:**
        *   Cultivate resistant varieties such as BH 902, BH 946, BH 393.
        *   Adhere to recommended sowing times.
    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   Apply fungicides at the first appearance of symptoms. Repeat application after 15-20 days if the disease persists.
        *   **Propiconazole** 25% EC: 500 ml per acre in 200-250 litres of water.
        *   **Tebuconazole** 25% WG: 250 g per acre in 200-250 litres of water.
        *   **Difenoconazole** 25% EC: 200 ml per acre in 200-250 litres of water.

### 4. White Rust
*   This is not known to affect Barley (Jau).

### 5. Red Rust
*   This is not known to affect Barley (Jau) as a distinct pathological disease. The term "Red Rust" is sometimes used colloquially, often referring to Brown Rust (Leaf Rust) or Stem Rust (Black Rust).

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always monitor your barley fields regularly, especially during periods of favorable weather conditions for rust development (e.g., high humidity, moderate temperatures).
*   For specific variety recommendations and the latest disease advisories, always consult your local agricultural extension office or HAU experts.
*   When using any chemical, strictly follow the instructions and safety precautions provided on the product label.
