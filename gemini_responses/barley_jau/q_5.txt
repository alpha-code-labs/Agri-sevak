As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned conditions in Barley (Jau) in Haryana:

**Control of Scab (Fusarium Head Blight) in Barley (Jau)**

Scab, also known as Fusarium Head Blight (FHB), is a significant fungal disease affecting barley, particularly during warm, humid weather around flowering. It is caused by *Fusarium* species, primarily *Fusarium graminearum*.

**Integrated Management Strategies:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting barley after maize, wheat, or other small grains, as these crops can host the *Fusarium* pathogen. Rotate with non-host crops like mustard, chickpea, or cotton.
    *   **Residue Management:** Plough in or remove infected crop residues from the previous season, as the fungus overwinters on these residues.
    *   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available and suitable for Haryana, choose barley varieties with improved resistance or tolerance to FHB. Consult HAU for recommended varieties.
    *   **Balanced Fertilization:** Avoid excessive nitrogen application, which can lead to dense canopy growth and increased humidity, favoring disease development.

2.  **Chemical Control:**
    *   Fungicide application is most effective when applied at the early heading to flowering stage (anthesis), which is the most susceptible period for infection.
    *   **Recommended Fungicide (CIBRC Approved Technical Chemical Name):**
        *   **Tebuconazole** (25.9% EC formulation): Apply at a rate of **300-400 ml per acre** mixed in 200-300 litres of water. Ensure thorough coverage of the heads.

**Regarding other conditions:**

*   **Canker:** This is not known to affect Barley (Jau). Canker is typically a disease of woody plants or certain vegetable crops, not annual cereal grasses like barley.
*   **Gummosis:** This is not known to affect Barley (Jau). Gummosis is the exudation of gum from plants, primarily associated with fruit trees (e.g., citrus, stone fruits) in response to stress or disease. Barley does not exhibit gummosis.
*   **Lichen:** This is not known to affect Barley (Jau). Lichens are symbiotic organisms that grow on stable surfaces like tree bark, rocks, or soil, and do not parasitize or grow on annual crop plants like barley.
