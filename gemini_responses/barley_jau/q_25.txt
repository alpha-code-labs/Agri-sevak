As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following irrigation management practices for Barley (Jau) cultivation in Haryana:

Barley is relatively more drought-tolerant than wheat, but timely and efficient irrigation is crucial for maximizing yield, especially during critical growth stages. Typically, 1-2 irrigations are sufficient for a good barley crop in Haryana, depending on rainfall and soil type.

### First Irrigation

The first irrigation is the most critical for barley and should be applied at the **Crown Root Initiation (CRI) stage**.

*   **Timing:** This stage usually occurs around **25-30 days after sowing (DAS)**.
*   **Importance:** Timely irrigation at CRI is essential for proper root development, tillering, and nutrient uptake, which directly impacts the final yield.
*   **Considerations:**
    *   If a good pre-sowing irrigation (palewa) was given and there has been sufficient winter rainfall, the first irrigation might be slightly delayed.
    *   In lighter, sandy soils, irrigation might be needed slightly earlier (around 20-25 DAS), while in heavier soils, it can be delayed slightly.
    *   Ensure the soil is adequately moist but not waterlogged.

### Second Irrigation (and Subsequent, if needed)

Barley often performs well with just one irrigation if winter rains are adequate. However, if dry spells persist or soil moisture is insufficient, a second irrigation may be beneficial.

*   **Timing:** If a second irrigation is required, it should ideally be given at the **booting stage** (around 60-70 DAS) or the **milking/grain filling stage** (around 80-90 DAS).
*   **Importance:** Irrigation at these stages helps in proper ear development and ensures good grain filling, leading to plump grains and higher yields.
*   **Avoidance:** **Do not irrigate during the flowering stage** (anthesis) as it can lead to increased incidence of fungal diseases and lodging, especially in tall varieties.
*   **Total Irrigations:** In most parts of Haryana, 1-2 irrigations are sufficient. In very light soils or during prolonged dry periods, a third light irrigation might be considered at the late grain filling stage, but this is less common.

### Sprinkler Use

Sprinkler irrigation is a highly efficient method and is strongly recommended for barley cultivation, especially in water-scarce regions of Haryana.

*   **Advantages:**
    *   **High Water Use Efficiency:** Sprinkler systems can achieve water use efficiencies of 60-80%, significantly higher than traditional flood irrigation (30-50%). This conserves precious water resources.
    *   **Uniform Water Distribution:** Ensures even application of water across the field, leading to uniform crop growth and reduced patches of water stress or waterlogging.
    *   **Reduced Lodging:** Applying water through sprinklers reduces the risk of lodging compared to heavy flood irrigation, particularly during later growth stages when plants are tall and heavy.
    *   **Suitable for Undulating Terrain:** Sprinklers are effective on uneven or sloping land where flood irrigation is difficult and leads to significant water loss.
    *   **Nutrient Application (Fertigation):** Sprinkler systems can be used for fertigation, allowing for precise application of water-soluble fertilizers directly to the root zone, improving nutrient uptake efficiency.
*   **Application:**
    *   Apply light and frequent irrigations using sprinklers.
    *   Sprinklers can be effectively used for all irrigations, from the first irrigation at CRI to subsequent irrigations at booting or grain filling.
    *   Monitor soil moisture levels regularly to determine the precise timing and duration of sprinkler irrigation.
