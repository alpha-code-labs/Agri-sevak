As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling soil pests like termites and nematodes (specifically root-knot nematodes) in Barley (Jau) in Haryana.

Both termites and root-knot nematodes are known to affect Barley (Jau) and can cause significant yield losses if not managed effectively. An Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural practices with judicious chemical control, is recommended.

### Control of Termites (Deemak) in Barley (Jau)

Termites can damage barley roots and stems, leading to wilting and plant death.

**1. Cultural and Agronomic Practices:**
*   **Deep Summer Ploughing:** Plough the field deeply during the hot summer months to expose termite colonies to sunlight and predators, which helps in their destruction.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove all crop residues, stubble, and woody debris from the field, as these can serve as food sources and breeding sites for termites.
*   **Well-Decomposed FYM:** Use only well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM). Undecomposed organic matter can attract termites.
*   **Proper Irrigation:** Maintain optimal soil moisture, as very dry conditions can sometimes favor termite activity.

**2. Chemical Control (at sowing):**
For effective control, chemical application should ideally be done at the time of sowing.
*   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC**: Apply 2.0-2.5 L per acre. Mix the required quantity with 20-30 kg of dry sand and broadcast evenly over the field before the last ploughing or at sowing. Alternatively, it can be applied as a drench through irrigation water.
*   **Fipronil 0.3% GR**: Apply 20-25 kg per acre at the time of sowing. Broadcast evenly and incorporate into the soil, or apply in furrows along with the seed.

### Control of Nematodes (Root-knot Nematodes - *Meloidogyne* spp.) in Barley (Jau)

Root-knot nematodes cause galls or knots on the roots, impairing nutrient and water uptake, leading to stunted growth, yellowing, and reduced yield.

**1. Cultural and Agronomic Practices:**
*   **Crop Rotation:** Implement a strict crop rotation program. Avoid continuous cultivation of susceptible crops. Rotate barley with non-host crops like mustard, marigold, sorghum, or pearl millet for at least 2-3 years.
*   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) at 10-15 tonnes per acre or neem cake at 200-400 kg per acre into the soil 2-3 weeks before sowing. Organic matter improves soil health and can suppress nematode populations.
*   **Summer Ploughing:** Deep ploughing during the hot summer months can expose nematode eggs and larvae to sunlight and desiccation, reducing their populations.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** While specific highly resistant barley varieties against root-knot nematodes might not be widely available for Haryana, consult HAU for any recommended tolerant varieties.

**2. Chemical Control (at sowing):**
Chemical nematicides can be applied at the time of sowing to protect young seedlings.
*   **Carbofuran 3% CG**: Apply 10-15 kg per acre at the time of sowing. Broadcast evenly and incorporate into the soil.
*   **Phorate 10% CG**: Apply 4-6 kg per acre at the time of sowing. Broadcast evenly and incorporate into the soil.

**Important Note:** Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully. Ensure proper safety measures are taken during handling and application of chemicals. For specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions, it is always advisable to consult with the experts at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar).
