As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies in Barley (Jau) in Haryana:

**1. Sawflies:**
The most significant pest among these for Barley (Jau) in Haryana is the Cereal Sawfly (*Cephus pygmaeus*). The larvae of this pest bore into the stems, causing lodging and significant yield losses.

*   **Control Measures for Cereal Sawfly:**
    *   At the appearance of initial symptoms (e.g., dead hearts or stem boring), apply one of the following CIBRC-approved insecticides:
        *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 1.0 - 1.25 litres per acre, mixed in 200-400 litres of water.
        *   **Quinalphos** 25% EC at 1.0 - 1.25 litres per acre, mixed in 200-400 litres of water.

**2. Beetles:**
Most beetle species are not considered major field pests of Barley (Jau) in Haryana. While occasional feeding by Blister Beetles (*Mylabris spp.*, *Epicauta spp.*) on flowers or developing grains might occur, it rarely warrants specific chemical intervention in barley. General pest management practices usually suffice.

**3. Weevils:**
Field weevils are generally not known to be significant pests causing economic damage to Barley (Jau) in Haryana. Storage weevils (*Sitophilus spp.*) are primarily post-harvest pests affecting stored grains and require different management strategies focused on storage hygiene and fumigation, which falls outside the scope of field control.
