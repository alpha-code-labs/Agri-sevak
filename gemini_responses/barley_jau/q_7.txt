As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm the following regarding the diseases mentioned for Barley (Jau):

*   **Dieback:** This is not known to affect Barley (Jau). Dieback is typically a condition affecting woody plants, not herbaceous crops like barley.
*   **Twig blight:** This is not known to affect Barley (Jau). Twig blight is also a disease primarily associated with woody plants, not cereals.
*   **Tikka disease:** This is not known to affect Barley (Jau). Tikka disease is a well-known foliar disease primarily affecting Groundnut (Moongfali). Barley is susceptible to other diseases such as rusts, powdery mildew, and various leaf spots, but not Tikka disease.
