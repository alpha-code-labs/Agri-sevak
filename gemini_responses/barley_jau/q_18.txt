As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the use of Ethrel (Ethephon), 2,4-D, and Boron in Barley (Jau) cultivation in Haryana:

**1. Ethrel (Ethephon)**
*   **Ethephon** is a plant growth regulator that releases ethylene. While it can be used in some cereal crops to reduce plant height and prevent lodging, **it is not a standard recommendation for Barley (Jau) cultivation in Haryana.** Therefore, we do not recommend its general use as a growth regulator in Barley (Jau) under typical Haryana conditions.

**2. 2,4-D**
*   **2,4-D** is a synthetic auxin, which is a type of plant hormone. However, its primary and recommended use in Barley (Jau) cultivation in Haryana is as a selective herbicide for the control of broadleaf weeds.
*   **It is not known to be recommended as a growth regulator/hormone for purposes other than weed control in Barley (Jau) in Haryana.**
*   *For your information, if you are referring to its use as a herbicide for broadleaf weed control in Barley (Jau), the general recommendations are:*
    *   **2,4-D Sodium Salt 80% WP:** 500 grams per acre, dissolved in 200-250 litres of water, applied 30-35 days after sowing.
    *   **2,4-D Ethyl Ester 38% EC:** 500 ml per acre, dissolved in 200-250 litres of water, applied 30-35 days after sowing.
    *   **2,4-D Amine Salt 58% SL:** 500 ml per acre, dissolved in 200-250 litres of water, applied 30-35 days after sowing.
    *   *Note: Apply when weeds are at 2-4 leaf stage and crop is well established. Avoid application if crop is under stress.*

**3. Boron**
*   Boron is an essential micronutrient vital for various physiological processes in plants, including cell wall formation, sugar transport, and pollen viability. While not classified as a "growth regulator/hormone" in the same category as Ethrel or 2,4-D, its deficiency can severely impair growth and development.
*   Boron application is recommended only when a deficiency is diagnosed through soil testing or visual symptoms. In Haryana, boron deficiency can occur in certain soil types.
*   **Recommended dose for foliar application (if deficiency is observed or anticipated):**
    *   **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate (e.g., Borax 10.5% Boron):** 100-150 grams per acre, dissolved in 200 litres of water.
    *   Apply as a foliar spray at the tillering stage or before flowering, if deficiency symptoms appear or soil tests indicate low boron levels. A second spray can be given 15-20 days later if needed.
    *   *Note: Always conduct a soil test to determine micronutrient status before application. Over-application of boron can be toxic to plants.*
