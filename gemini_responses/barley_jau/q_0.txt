As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Barley (Jau) in Haryana.

It is crucial to adopt an Integrated Disease Management (IDM) approach, combining cultural practices, resistant varieties, and judicious use of CIBRC-approved fungicides.

Here's how to address the specific diseases you've mentioned:

**1. Alternaria (Alternaria Leaf Spot/Blight)**
This disease can affect Barley (Jau), causing irregular brown spots on leaves.
*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Use resistant or tolerant varieties.
    *   Practice crop rotation with non-host crops.
    *   Ensure proper field sanitation by removing crop residues.
*   **Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
    *   Apply fungicides at the appearance of initial symptoms or when disease severity reaches economic threshold.
    *   **Propiconazole** 25% EC: 500 ml/acre
    *   **Tebuconazole** 25.9% EC: 250-300 ml/acre
    *   **Difenoconazole** 25% EC: 200 ml/acre
    *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC: 200 ml/acre
    *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP: 800-1000 g/acre (often used preventatively or in combination)

**2. Anthracnose**
This is not known to affect Barley (Jau) as a significant disease.

**3. Blast**
This is not known to affect Barley (Jau) as a significant disease.

**4. Blight (Net Blotch and Spot Blotch)**
Net blotch (caused by *Pyrenophora teres*) and Spot blotch (caused by *Bipolaris sorokiniana*) are common and significant leaf blights in Barley (Jau) in Haryana, leading to yield losses.
*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Sow resistant or tolerant varieties.
    *   Practice crop rotation.
    *   Timely sowing and balanced nutrient management.
    *   Remove crop residues to reduce inoculum.
*   **Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
    *   Apply fungicides at the appearance of initial symptoms or when disease severity reaches economic threshold.
    *   **Propiconazole** 25% EC: 500 ml/acre
    *   **Tebuconazole** 25.9% EC: 250-300 ml/acre
    *   **Difenoconazole** 25% EC: 200 ml/acre
    *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC: 200 ml/acre
    *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP: 800-1000 g/acre
    *   **Azoxystrobin 18.2% + Difenoconazole 11.4% SC**: 200 ml/acre
    *   **Tebuconazole 50% + Trifloxystrobin 25% WG**: 160 g/acre

**5. Brown spot**
This is not known to affect Barley (Jau) as a distinct primary disease. Symptoms resembling brown spots are typically associated with diseases like Spot Blotch, which is covered under 'Blight'.

**6. Downy/Powdery Mildew**
*   **Downy Mildew:** This is not known to affect Barley (Jau) as a significant disease.
*   **Powdery Mildew:** Powdery mildew (caused by *Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei*) is a very common and significant disease in Barley (Jau), appearing as white, powdery patches on leaves and stems.
    *   **Cultural Practices:**
        *   Cultivate resistant varieties.
        *   Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can promote disease.
        *   Ensure good air circulation within the crop canopy.
    *   **Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
        *   Apply fungicides at the appearance of initial symptoms.
        *   **Propiconazole** 25% EC: 500 ml/acre
        *   **Tebuconazole** 25.9% EC: 250-300 ml/acre
        *   **Difenoconazole** 25% EC: 200 ml/acre
        *   **Wettable sulfur** 80% WP: 1.5-2.0 kg/acre (effective for early stages and as a preventative measure)
        *   **Pyraclostrobin 13.3% + Epoxiconazole 5% SE**: 300-400 ml/acre (effective against both powdery mildew and blights)

**7. Grey mildew**
This is not known to affect Barley (Jau).

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the label instructions of the specific product you are using, including safety precautions and pre-harvest intervals.
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension services for the most current recommendations and disease outbreaks in your specific area.
