As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling smut diseases in Barley (Jau) in Haryana.

Smut diseases can significantly reduce barley yield and grain quality. Effective management primarily relies on preventive measures, especially seed treatment and the use of resistant varieties.

### False Smut

This is not known to affect Barley (Jau). False smut (caused by *Ustilaginoidea virens*) is primarily a disease of rice.

### Loose Smut (Ustilago nuda f. sp. hordei) and Covered Smut (Ustilago hordei)

Loose smut and Covered smut are the most common and economically important smut diseases affecting Barley (Jau) in Haryana. While "Black smut" and "Kernel smut" are often general terms, they typically refer to Covered smut in barley, where the grain is replaced by a black, powdery mass of spores.

*   **Loose Smut:** The pathogen is internally seed-borne, residing within the embryo of the seed. Infected plants produce heads where all grains are replaced by a black, powdery mass of spores that are dispersed by wind, leaving a bare rachis.
*   **Covered Smut:** The pathogen is externally seed-borne, with spores adhering to the surface of the seed. Infected heads have grains replaced by a black, compact mass of spores that remain covered by a thin membrane until harvest or threshing.

### Control Measures for Loose Smut and Covered Smut

Effective control of these smuts relies on an integrated approach, with seed treatment being the most critical step.

1.  **Resistant Varieties:**
    *   Cultivate smut-resistant or tolerant barley varieties recommended for Haryana. Always consult HAU or ICAR for the latest recommendations on suitable varieties for your region.

2.  **Seed Treatment (Most Critical Step):**
    *   Treat seeds with systemic fungicides before sowing. This is highly effective against both internally seed-borne Loose Smut and externally seed-borne Covered Smut. Ensure thorough coverage of the seeds with the fungicide.
        *   **Carboxin** @ 2.0-2.5 g per kg of seed.
        *   **Tebuconazole** @ 1.0-1.5 g per kg of seed (for dry formulations) or 1.0-1.5 ml per kg of seed (for liquid formulations).
        *   **Difenoconazole** @ 1.0-1.5 ml per kg of seed.

3.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Source of Seed:** Always use certified, disease-free seeds from reliable sources to prevent the introduction of smut pathogens.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops (e.g., legumes, mustard) to reduce any potential inoculum build-up in the soil, although smut spores are primarily seed-borne.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest to reduce any potential inoculum in the field.
    *   **Timely Sowing:** Sowing barley at the optimal time as recommended by HAU can help the crop establish well and potentially reduce the impact of disease under certain environmental conditions.
