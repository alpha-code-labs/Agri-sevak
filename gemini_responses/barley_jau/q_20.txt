As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the critical importance of balanced nutrition for optimal barley (Jau) yield and quality in Haryana. Micronutrient deficiencies can significantly impact crop health and productivity. Accurate diagnosis, preferably through soil and plant tissue analysis, is the first step.

Here's how to address common micronutrient deficiencies in Barley (Jau):

### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

Zinc deficiency is one of the most widespread micronutrient problems in cereals in Haryana, especially in high pH, calcareous soils.

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, often starting from the base of the leaf, sometimes with a purplish tinge on older leaves.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   Apply **Zinc sulfate monohydrate** (33% Zn) @ 5-10 kg/acre at the time of sowing.
        *   Alternatively, apply **Zinc sulfate heptahydrate** (21% Zn) @ 10-20 kg/acre at the time of sowing.
    *   **Foliar Application (when symptoms appear):**
        *   Spray **Zinc sulfate heptahydrate** (21% Zn) @ 0.5% solution (5 g/L of water). To prevent leaf scorch, it is advisable to add 0.25% (2.5 g/L) of unslaked lime.
        *   Alternatively, spray **Zinc EDTA** (12% Zn) @ 0.1% solution (1 g/L of water).
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, starting from the tillering stage.

### 2. Iron (Fe) Deficiency

Iron deficiency is common in high pH, calcareous, and waterlogged soils.

*   **Symptoms:** Prominent interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, which turn pale yellow to almost white, while the veins remain green. In severe cases, the entire leaf may turn white.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   Apply **Ferrous sulfate** (19% Fe) @ 10-20 kg/acre. This is often less effective in high pH soils compared to foliar application.
    *   **Foliar Application (when symptoms appear):**
        *   Spray **Ferrous sulfate** (19% Fe) @ 0.5-1.0% solution (5-10 g/L of water). Adding 0.1% citric acid or urea can enhance absorption.
        *   Alternatively, spray **Iron EDTA** (12% Fe) @ 0.1% solution (1 g/L of water).
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 7-10 day intervals until the green colour returns.

### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

Boron deficiency can affect reproductive growth and grain development.

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, death of growing points, poor pollen viability leading to reduced grain set, brittle young leaves, and sometimes a "witches' broom" appearance.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   Apply **Borax** (10.5-11.3% B) @ 2-4 kg/acre at the time of sowing.
        *   Alternatively, apply **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (20% B) @ 1-2 kg/acre at the time of sowing.
    *   **Foliar Application (when symptoms appear or at critical stages):**
        *   Spray **Borax** (10.5-11.3% B) @ 0.1-0.2% solution (1-2 g/L of water).
        *   Alternatively, spray **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (20% B) @ 0.05-0.1% solution (0.5-1 g/L of water).
        *   Apply at tillering and pre-flowering stages for best results.

### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

Calcium deficiency is less common in barley in Haryana's typical soil conditions but can occur in very acidic soils or where calcium uptake is hindered.

*   **Symptoms:** Death of growing points, young leaves distorted or curled, water-soaked appearance, and poor root development.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   For acidic soils, apply **Calcium carbonate** (liming material) as per soil test recommendations to raise pH and supply calcium.
        *   For direct calcium supply, **Gypsum** (Calcium sulfate dihydrate) @ 200-400 kg/acre can be applied, which also provides sulfur.
    *   **Foliar Application (when symptoms appear):**
        *   Spray **Calcium chloride** @ 0.5-1.0% solution (5-10 g/L of water).

### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

Magnesium deficiency can occur in sandy soils, acidic soils, or where there is an imbalance with high potassium levels.

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, starting from the leaf margins and progressing inwards, sometimes with reddish or purplish tints.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   Apply **Magnesium sulfate** @ 10-20 kg/acre at the time of sowing.
    *   **Foliar Application (when symptoms appear):**
        *   Spray **Magnesium sulfate** @ 1.0-2.0% solution (10-20 g/L of water).
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals.

### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

Manganese deficiency is often observed in high pH, organic matter-rich, or poorly drained soils.

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, often with small necrotic spots or streaks, leading to a "grey speck" appearance. Stunted growth.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   Apply **Manganese sulfate** @ 10-20 kg/acre. Soil application is often less effective in high pH soils.
    *   **Foliar Application (when symptoms appear):**
        *   Spray **Manganese sulfate** @ 0.5-1.0% solution (5-10 g/L of water).
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 7-10 day intervals until symptoms disappear.

### General Recommendations:

*   **Soil Testing:** Always conduct soil testing before sowing to accurately determine nutrient status and tailor recommendations. This is the most scientific and economical approach.
*   **Plant Tissue Analysis:** For confirming suspected deficiencies during crop growth, plant tissue analysis can provide precise information.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management (INM):** Combine organic manures (Farm Yard Manure, compost), biofertilizers, and chemical fertilizers for sustainable nutrient management and improved soil health.
*   **Timely Application:** Early detection and timely application of micronutrients are crucial for effective recovery and yield protection.
*   **Water Quality:** Use clean water for foliar sprays. Adding a non-ionic spreading agent (surfactant) can improve the efficacy of foliar applications.
*   **Consult Experts:** For specific field conditions and complex issues, always consult with local agricultural extension officers or experts at HAU for tailored advice.
