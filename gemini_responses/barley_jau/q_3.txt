As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling various rot types in Barley (Jau) relevant to Haryana conditions.

Many of the rot types you've mentioned (Root, Stem, Foot, Collar, Crown, Seed, and Seedling rot) are often part of a complex of diseases caused by several soil-borne and seed-borne fungal pathogens. Therefore, their control measures often overlap.

### Control of Common Rot Complex (Root, Stem, Foot, Collar, Crown, Seed, and Seedling Rot) in Barley (Jau)

These types of rots are primarily caused by a complex of fungal pathogens, including:
*   *Bipolaris sorokiniana* (causing common root rot, foot rot, and seedling blight)
*   *Fusarium* species (*F. culmorum*, *F. graminearum*, *F. pseudograminearum* causing Fusarium root rot, crown rot, and seedling blight)
*   *Rhizoctonia solani* (causing damping-off, root rot, and stem rot)
*   *Pythium* species (causing seed rot and seedling damping-off, especially in cool, wet conditions)

**Integrated Control Measures:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Implement a 2-3 year rotation with non-host crops (e.g., legumes, mustard, cotton) to reduce the build-up of pathogen inoculum in the soil. Avoid continuous cultivation of cereals.
    *   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available, select barley varieties known for their tolerance or resistance to common root rot and other soil-borne diseases.
    *   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure balanced fertilization. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can make plants more susceptible. Adequate phosphorus and potassium promote root health.
    *   **Proper Drainage:** Improve soil drainage to prevent waterlogging, which favors *Pythium* and other root rot pathogens.
    *   **Timely Sowing:** Sow barley at the recommended time for your region in Haryana. Early or late sowing can stress plants and increase susceptibility.
    *   **Seed Bed Preparation:** Prepare a well-pulverized, firm seedbed to ensure uniform germination and emergence, reducing stress on seedlings.
    *   **Residue Management:** Incorporate or remove crop residues from previous infected crops to reduce inoculum sources.

2.  **Seed Treatment (Crucial for Seed, Seedling, Root, Foot, Collar, and Crown Rots):**
    *   Treating seeds with a broad-spectrum fungicide combination before sowing is the most effective measure to protect against seed-borne pathogens and early-stage soil-borne infections.
    *   Recommended CIBRC approved technical chemicals for seed treatment:
        *   **Carboxin** 37.5% + **Thiram** 37.5% WS @ 2.5-3.0 g/kg seed.
        *   **Tebuconazole** 2% DS @ 1.0-1.5 g/kg seed.
        *   **Difenoconazole** 3% + **Metalaxyl-M** 3% FS @ 1.0 ml/kg seed (effective against *Pythium* and other fungi).
        *   **Fluxapyroxad** 333 g/L + **Pyraclostrobin** 333 g/L FS @ 0.3-0.6 ml/kg seed.
        *   **Tebuconazole** 60 FS @ 1.0-1.5 ml/kg seed.

3.  **Foliar/Soil Application (Less common for widespread field rot, but for specific cases):**
    *   For severe outbreaks of foot rot or crown rot, especially if diagnosed early, a targeted soil drench or foliar spray might be considered, though efficacy can be limited once the disease is well-established.
    *   **Propiconazole** 25% EC @ 500 ml/acre in 200-300 L water, applied as a drench around the base of affected plants, or as a foliar spray if symptoms are extending upwards.
    *   **Tebuconazole** 250 EW @ 250-300 ml/acre in 200-300 L water, as a foliar spray.

### Specific Rot Types:

*   **Neck Rot:**
    *   This is not typically recognized as a primary, distinct disease of barley in Haryana. While *Fusarium graminearum* can cause Head Blight (Scab) in barley, which might occasionally extend to the neck, it is not a common standalone "neck rot" disease requiring specific control measures beyond those for the general *Fusarium* complex.

*   **Black Rot:**
    *   This is not known to affect Barley (Jau). The term "Black Rot" is primarily associated with bacterial diseases in cruciferous crops or fungal diseases in grapes.

*   **Fruit Rot:**
    *   This is not known to affect Barley (Jau). Barley produces grains, not botanical fruits, and therefore the term "fruit rot" is not applicable to this crop.
