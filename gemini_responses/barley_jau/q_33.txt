As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling weeds in Barley (Jau) in Haryana:

**General Weed Management Principles:**
*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Use certified, weed-free seeds to prevent the introduction of weed seeds.
    *   Practice timely sowing as per recommended dates for your region to ensure vigorous crop growth that can outcompete weeds.
    *   Ensure proper seedbed preparation to reduce initial weed flush.
    *   Adopt crop rotation with non-cereal crops to break the life cycle of specific barley weeds.
    *   Hand weeding can be effective for scattered weeds, especially in the early stages of crop growth (20-40 days after sowing).

**Specific Weed Control Measures:**

**1. Phalaris minor (Gulli Danda) and other Narrow Leaf Weeds:**
*   **Post-emergence application (30-35 days after sowing, when weeds are in 2-4 leaf stage):**
    *   **Clodinafop-propargyl** 15% WP at 60 g/acre (mixed with 200-250 litres of water).
    *   **Pinoxaden** 5.1% EC at 40 g/acre (mixed with 200-250 litres of water).
    *   **Sulfosulfuron** 75% WG at 25 g/acre (mixed with 200-250 litres of water). This herbicide also provides control of some broadleaf weeds.
    *   **Fenoxaprop-p-ethyl** 9% EC at 400 ml/acre (mixed with 200-250 litres of water).

**2. Broad Leaf Weeds (Bathu, Congress grass, etc.):**
*   **Post-emergence application (30-35 days after sowing, when weeds are in 2-4 leaf stage):**
    *   **2,4-D ethyl ester** 38% EC at 500 ml/acre (mixed with 200-250 litres of water).
    *   **Metsulfuron-methyl** 20% WP at 4 g/acre (mixed with 200-250 litres of water).
    *   **Tribenuron-methyl** 75% WG at 10 g/acre (mixed with 200-250 litres of water).
    *   **Carfentrazone-ethyl** 10% EC at 20 ml/acre (mixed with 200-250 litres of water).

**3. Mixed Population of Narrow Leaf and Broad Leaf Weeds:**
*   For effective control of both types, a tank mix of a narrow-leaf herbicide and a broad-leaf herbicide can be used, *provided compatibility is confirmed and label instructions are followed*. For example:
    *   **Clodinafop-propargyl** (for NLW) + **Metsulfuron-methyl** (for BLW) at their respective recommended doses.
    *   **Sulfosulfuron** (as mentioned above) provides control of both, but may require an additional broadleaf herbicide if broadleaf weed pressure is high.

**4. Amarbail (Cuscuta):**
*   This is not known to affect Barley (Jau). Amarbail is primarily a parasitic weed of dicotyledonous crops.

**5. Orobanche (Broomrape):**
*   This is not known to affect Barley (Jau). Orobanche is primarily a parasitic weed of dicotyledonous crops.

**Important Considerations for Herbicide Application:**
*   Always read and strictly follow the label instructions of the specific product being used for correct dosage, timing, and safety precautions.
*   Ensure proper calibration of spray equipment to achieve uniform application.
*   Apply herbicides when there is adequate soil moisture and no strong winds to prevent drift.
*   Use flat fan nozzles for uniform spray coverage and better efficacy.
*   Rotate herbicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of herbicide resistance, especially for persistent weeds like Phalaris minor.
