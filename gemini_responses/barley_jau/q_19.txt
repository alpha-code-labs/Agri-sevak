Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide you with scientifically verified advice on addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies in Barley (Jau) in Haryana.

It is crucial to emphasize that **soil testing is the most accurate method** to determine specific nutrient deficiencies and the precise quantities required for your field. The recommendations below are general guidelines for Haryana conditions in the absence of a soil test report.

### Addressing Macro-nutrient Deficiencies in Barley (Jau)

#### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Yellowing of older leaves, stunted growth, reduced tillering, and overall pale green appearance of the crop.

**Correction:**
*   **Basal Application:** Apply a portion of the total nitrogen requirement at the time of sowing.
*   **Top-dressing:** Nitrogen is highly mobile and prone to losses, so split application as top-dressing is highly recommended for efficient utilization.
*   **Chemical:** **Urea** (46% N)
*   **Dose (General Recommendation):** For irrigated barley, a total of 60-80 kg N per acre is generally recommended. This translates to approximately 130-175 kg **Urea** per acre.
    *   **Timing:** Apply 1/3 to 1/2 of the total nitrogen as basal at sowing. The remaining nitrogen should be applied in 1-2 top-dressings.
        *   First top-dressing: At the tillering stage (around 25-30 days after sowing), usually after the first irrigation.
        *   Second top-dressing (if needed): At the jointing stage (around 45-50 days after sowing).

#### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Purplish discoloration of leaves (especially older ones), stunted growth, poor root development, and delayed maturity.

**Correction:**
*   **Basal Application:** Phosphorus is relatively immobile in the soil, so it is most effective when applied at or just before sowing, incorporated into the soil.
*   **Chemicals:**
    *   **Di-ammonium phosphate** (DAP, 18% N, 46% P2O5)
    *   **Single superphosphate** (SSP, 16% P2O5)
*   **Dose (General Recommendation):** A total of 20-30 kg P2O5 per acre is generally recommended.
    *   If using **Di-ammonium phosphate**: Apply approximately 45-65 kg **Di-ammonium phosphate** per acre.
    *   If using **Single superphosphate**: Apply approximately 125-190 kg **Single superphosphate** per acre.
*   **Timing:** Apply the entire quantity of phosphorus as basal at the time of sowing.

#### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Yellowing and browning of leaf margins (especially older leaves), weak stems leading to lodging, poor grain filling, and increased susceptibility to diseases.

**Correction:**
*   **Basal Application:** Potassium is best applied at the time of sowing.
*   **Chemical:** **Muriate of potash** (MOP, 60% K2O)
*   **Dose (General Recommendation):** A total of 20 kg K2O per acre is generally recommended. This translates to approximately 33 kg **Muriate of potash** per acre.
*   **Timing:** Apply the entire quantity of potassium as basal at the time of sowing. In very light soils or where soil test indicates severe deficiency, a split application (half basal, half at first irrigation) might be considered, but basal application is usually sufficient.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Soil Testing:** Always prioritize soil testing for precise recommendations tailored to your specific field conditions.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management:** Supplement chemical fertilizers with organic manures (Farm Yard Manure, compost) to improve soil health and nutrient availability.
*   **Water Management:** Ensure proper irrigation practices, as adequate soil moisture is essential for nutrient uptake by the plants.
