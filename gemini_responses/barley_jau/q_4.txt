Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU), Hisar, I understand your concern regarding Wilt and Parawilt in Barley (Jau). It is important to differentiate between these two conditions as their management strategies vary.

**1. Fungal Wilt (e.g., Fusarium Wilt)**

This is caused by soil-borne fungal pathogens, primarily *Fusarium* species.

**Symptoms:**
*   Yellowing and drooping of leaves, often starting from one side of the plant.
*   Stunted growth.
*   Wilting of the entire plant, which may eventually die.
*   Browning of vascular tissues (visible when the stem is cut open).

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid continuous cultivation of barley or other susceptible crops in the same field. Rotate with non-host crops like mustard or legumes.
    *   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available, choose barley varieties known to have resistance or tolerance to wilt diseases.
    *   **Soil Health:** Improve soil drainage and aeration. Avoid waterlogging.
    *   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure balanced application of macro and micronutrients to enhance plant vigour and resistance.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris to reduce inoculum in the soil.

*   **Chemical Control (Seed Treatment):**
    *   Seed treatment is highly effective in preventing early infection from soil-borne pathogens. Treat seeds before sowing with any of the following CIBRC approved fungicides:
        *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 2 grams per kilogram of seed.
        *   **Thiram** 75% WS at 2.5 grams per kilogram of seed.
        *   A combination product of **Carboxin** 37.5% + **Thiram** 37.5% DS at 2.5 grams per kilogram of seed.

**2. Parawilt (Physiological Wilt)**

Parawilt is a physiological disorder, not caused by a pathogen. It is often observed in cereals like wheat and can affect barley under specific environmental stresses.

**Symptoms:**
*   Sudden wilting of plants, often during hot periods of the day, with plants recovering partially or fully by evening or morning.
*   No visible yellowing or vascular discoloration initially.
*   Often associated with sudden changes in temperature (hot days, cool nights), high soil moisture followed by dry spells, or nutrient imbalances.

**Management Measures:**

*   **Optimal Soil Moisture:** Maintain consistent and adequate soil moisture. Avoid extremes of waterlogging followed by severe drought. Provide light irrigation during periods of high temperature stress.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:**
    *   Ensure adequate availability of potassium (K), as it plays a crucial role in water regulation and stress tolerance in plants.
    *   Address any micronutrient deficiencies, particularly Boron (B) and Zinc (Zn), which are important for plant health and stress resilience.
*   **Avoid Root Damage:** Be careful during inter-cultivation practices to avoid damaging the root system, which can exacerbate wilting.
*   **Foliar Nutrition (Supportive):**
    *   In situations of severe stress, a foliar spray of 0.5% Potassium Nitrate (KNO3) can help plants cope. This is a nutrient supplement, not a pesticide.
    *   Foliar application of a good quality micronutrient mixture (as per soil test recommendations) can also support plant health.

By adopting these integrated management strategies, you can effectively control both fungal wilt and manage parawilt conditions in your barley crop. For specific recommendations tailored to your field, please consult with your local agricultural extension officer.
