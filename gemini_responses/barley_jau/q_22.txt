As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following cultivation practices for Barley (Jau) in Haryana:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   **Line Sowing:** The most recommended method is line sowing using a seed drill. This ensures uniform seed distribution, proper depth, and facilitates inter-culture operations.
    *   **Zero Tillage:** For fields where the previous crop was rice, zero tillage sowing is also a highly recommended practice. It conserves soil moisture, reduces cultivation costs, and allows for timely sowing.
*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   The optimal planting depth for barley seeds is **3-5 cm**. Deeper sowing can lead to delayed emergence and reduced plant stand, while shallower sowing might expose seeds to birds or inadequate moisture.
*   **Spacing:**
    *   **Row-to-Row Spacing:** Maintain a distance of **20-22.5 cm** between rows. This spacing allows for adequate light penetration, air circulation, and efficient nutrient uptake.
    *   **Plant-to-Plant Spacing:** While not precisely controlled like in wider-row crops, the seed drill should be calibrated to ensure uniform distribution within the row, leading to an optimal plant population.
*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   For timely sown barley (grain purpose): **100 kg/acre**.
    *   For late sown barley or under saline/sodic soil conditions: Increase the seed rate to **120 kg/acre** to compensate for potential lower germination or reduced tillering.
    *   For dual-purpose barley (forage + grain): A higher seed rate of **120-140 kg/acre** is recommended to achieve a dense initial stand for fodder cutting.
