Dear Farmer,

Flower and fruit drop (including "Tinda/Boll dropping" which refers to young fruit drop) in Jamun (Syzygium cumini) is a common physiological issue that can significantly reduce yield. It is not a disease or pest in itself, but rather a symptom often caused by a combination of environmental stress, nutritional imbalances, poor pollination, and hormonal fluctuations within the plant.

Here's how you can control dropping in Jamun:

**I. Agronomic and Cultural Management Practices:**

1.  **Water Management:**
    *   **Consistent Moisture:** Jamun trees require consistent soil moisture, especially during the critical stages of flowering and fruit development. Both waterlogging and severe drought stress can lead to flower and fruit drop.
    *   **Irrigation Schedule:** Provide light irrigation during the flowering period to prevent stress. Once fruits have set, ensure regular and adequate irrigation to support fruit development. Avoid sudden changes in soil moisture.

2.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Balanced Fertilization:** Ensure the tree receives a balanced supply of macro and micronutrients. Deficiencies, particularly of Boron, Zinc, or Calcium, can sometimes contribute to poor fruit set and increased drop.
    *   **Soil Testing:** Conduct a soil test to determine specific nutrient deficiencies and apply fertilizers accordingly. As a general recommendation, apply well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost annually.

3.  **Pest and Disease Control:**
    *   While not direct causes of dropping, severe infestations of pests (e.g., fruit flies, mealybugs) or diseases can weaken the tree, leading to stress-induced flower and fruit drop. Maintain overall tree health through timely pest and disease management.

4.  **Pollination:**
    *   **Promote Pollinators:** Ensure the presence of natural pollinators like bees in your orchard. Avoid spraying insecticides during the peak flowering period to protect these beneficial insects.

5.  **Pruning:**
    *   **Light Pruning:** Remove dead, diseased, or overcrowded branches to improve air circulation and light penetration within the canopy. This enhances overall tree vigor and can indirectly reduce stress-related drop.

**II. Chemical Interventions (Plant Growth Regulators - PGRs):**

Plant growth regulators can be effectively used to minimize premature flower and fruit drop by influencing the hormonal balance within the plant.

*   **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA):**
    *   **Action:** This auxin is highly effective in preventing premature flower and fruit drop by strengthening the abscission layer (the layer of cells that forms at the base of the flower or fruit stalk, causing it to detach).
    *   **Dosage:** Apply **Naphthalene Acetic Acid** (NAA) at a concentration of 10-20 ppm (parts per million) as a foliar spray.
        *   *For example, if using a 4.5% SL (Soluble Liquid) formulation, this typically translates to approximately 0.22 - 0.44 ml of the product per liter of water.*
    *   **Timing:**
        *   The first spray should be applied when the fruits are at the pea-size stage.
        *   If necessary, a second spray can be given about 15-20 days after the first application.
    *   **Caution:** Strictly adhere to the recommended dosages. Higher concentrations of NAA can have adverse effects, including thinning of fruits or even phytotoxicity.

An integrated approach combining good horticultural practices with the judicious use of CIBRC-approved plant growth regulators like Naphthalene Acetic Acid is the most effective strategy to minimize flower and fruit drop in Jamun and ensure a healthy yield.
