As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in Jamun in Haryana:

**1. Borers (Stem Borer, Fruit Borer):**
Borers can cause significant damage to Jamun trees, affecting stems, branches, and fruits. Control measures depend on the type and severity of the infestation.

*   **Stem Borers:**
    *   **Mechanical Control:** Regularly inspect tree trunks and branches for boreholes, frass (wood dust), and wilting branches. Use a hooked wire to extract larvae from boreholes. Prune and destroy severely infested or dead branches.
    *   **Chemical Control (for active infestations):**
        *   **Trunk Swabbing/Painting:** Mix **Chlorpyrifos** (20% EC) at 2.5 ml/L of water and swab/paint the affected trunk and main branches, especially during periods of adult emergence or egg-laying.
        *   **Borehole Injection:** If boreholes are visible, inject a solution of **Chlorpyrifos** (20% EC) at 2.5 ml/L of water into the holes using a syringe, then plug the holes with mud or wet clay to trap the borer.

*   **Fruit Borers (often larval stage of moths/caterpillars):**
    *   **Cultural Control:** Collect and destroy all infested fallen fruits regularly to break the pest life cycle.
    *   **Chemical Control (during fruit development, considering pre-harvest interval):**
        *   Spray with **Chlorantraniliprole** (18.5% SC) at 0.3 ml/L of water.
        *   Alternatively, spray with **Emamectin benzoate** (5% SG) at 0.2 g/L of water.
        *   Alternatively, spray with **Spinosad** (45% SC) at 0.25 ml/L of water.

**2. Caterpillars (General leaf-eating caterpillars, including some fruit borers):**
Various caterpillar species can feed on Jamun leaves and fruits, causing defoliation or fruit damage.

*   **Cultural Control:** Hand-pick and destroy visible caterpillars on young trees or accessible branches.
*   **Biological Control:**
    *   Spray with **Bacillus thuringiensis** (Bt) formulations at 1-2 g/L or 1-2 ml/L of water (depending on the specific formulation), which is effective against young larvae and safe for beneficial insects.
*   **Chemical Control (for severe infestations):**
    *   Spray with **Chlorantraniliprole** (18.5% SC) at 0.3 ml/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, spray with **Emamectin benzoate** (5% SG) at 0.2 g/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, spray with **Flubendiamide** (20% WG) at 0.2 g/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, spray with **Indoxacarb** (14.5% SC) at 0.5 ml/L of water.

**3. Diamondback Moth (DBM):**
This is not known to affect Jamun. Diamondback moth (*Plutella xylostella*) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower, mustard).

**4. Leaf Folder:**
Leaf folders cause damage by folding leaves and feeding within the protective fold, leading to reduced photosynthetic area and stunted growth.

*   **Cultural Control:** Regularly inspect trees and remove and destroy folded leaves containing larvae.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Spray with **Chlorantraniliprole** (18.5% SC) at 0.3 ml/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, spray with **Emamectin benzoate** (5% SG) at 0.2 g/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, spray with **Spinosad** (45% SC) at 0.25 ml/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, spray with **Flubendiamide** (20% WG) at 0.2 g/L of water.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and strictly follow the label instructions of any pesticide for correct dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Apply pesticides during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift, reduce evaporation, and maximize efficacy.
*   Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage and fruits for effective pest control.
*   Rotate different classes of insecticides to prevent the development of pesticide resistance in pest populations.
*   Promote natural enemies (e.g., parasitic wasps, predatory beetles) by avoiding unnecessary use of broad-spectrum insecticides.
