Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding Wilt and Parawilt in Jamun. These conditions can significantly impact tree health and productivity. Effective management requires an integrated approach, focusing on prevention and timely intervention.

Here's a scientifically verified approach to control Wilt (including Parawilt) in Jamun:

**1. Cultural and Horticultural Practices (Foundation of Management):**

*   **Site Selection and Drainage:** Jamun thrives in well-drained soils. Avoid planting in low-lying areas prone to water stagnation, as waterlogging is a primary trigger for Parawilt and exacerbates root diseases. For existing orchards, improve drainage by creating raised beds or installing subsurface drains if necessary.
*   **Soil Health Management:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost (10-15 kg per tree annually for mature trees) to improve soil structure, aeration, and beneficial microbial activity, which naturally suppresses pathogens.
*   **Irrigation Management:** Practice judicious irrigation. Avoid over-watering, especially during the monsoon season or in heavy clay soils. Allow the soil to dry slightly between irrigations. Drip irrigation is recommended to provide water directly to the root zone and minimize soil saturation.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure balanced nutrition. Potassium deficiency can sometimes increase susceptibility to wilt. Conduct soil testing to determine nutrient requirements and apply fertilizers as per recommendations.
*   **Sanitation:** Promptly remove and destroy any dead or severely diseased branches and fallen leaves. Sterilize pruning tools with a 10% bleach solution after each tree to prevent disease spread.
*   **Rootstock Vigor:** While specific resistant rootstocks for Jamun wilt are not widely commercialized, using healthy, vigorous planting material from reputable nurseries is crucial.
*   **Soil Solarization:** In areas with a history of severe wilt, soil solarization during the hot summer months (May-June) for 4-6 weeks can significantly reduce soil-borne pathogen populations before planting new trees.

**2. Chemical Control (Targeted Intervention):**

For existing trees showing early symptoms or as a prophylactic measure in high-risk areas, chemical interventions can be effective. Always follow label instructions for application rates and safety precautions.

*   **Soil Drenching:**
    *   Drench the soil around the root zone with **Carbendazim** at a concentration of 1-2 grams per litre of water. Apply 5-10 litres of solution per tree, depending on its size and age. Repeat the application after 15-20 days if symptoms persist or as a preventive measure during critical periods.
    *   Alternatively, use **Thiophanate-methyl** at a concentration of 1-2 grams per litre of water for soil drenching, following similar application rates and frequency.
*   **Collar Region Treatment (if collar rot is suspected):**
    *   If symptoms include lesions or rotting at the collar region (junction of stem and soil), carefully scrape off the diseased bark. Then, apply a paste made from **Copper Oxychloride** (20-30 grams mixed in 1 litre of water) to the affected area.

**3. Biological Control (Enhancing Soil Resilience):**

Incorporating beneficial microbial agents can help suppress soil-borne pathogens and improve plant health.

*   **Bio-fungicides:** Apply formulations of *Trichoderma viride* or *Pseudomonas fluorescens* (available as powder or liquid) at the rate of 2.5-5 kg per acre. Mix the bio-fungicide with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed farmyard manure or compost and apply it around the root zone of the trees. This is best done during planting or early growth stages and can be repeated annually, especially before the monsoon season.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Early Detection:** Monitor your Jamun trees regularly for any signs of wilting, yellowing leaves, or dieback. Early detection allows for more effective control.
*   **Integrated Approach:** The most successful control strategy combines all the above methods. Relying solely on one method may not provide sustainable results.
*   **Consult Experts:** For severe or persistent problems, it is advisable to consult with local agricultural extension specialists or HAU experts for specific diagnosis and tailored recommendations for your farm's conditions.
