As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide the following scientifically verified advice to protect your Jamun trees from environmental stress in Haryana:

Jamun (Syzygium cumini) is a relatively hardy tree once established, but young plants and even mature trees can suffer significant damage from extreme weather conditions prevalent in Haryana.

### A. Protection from Extreme Cold and Frost

Jamun trees, especially young ones, are susceptible to frost damage.

*   **For Young Plants (up to 3-5 years):**
    *   **Covering:** During predicted frosty nights, cover young plants with hessian cloth, straw, or plastic sheets. Ensure the cover does not touch the foliage directly. Remove covers during the day to allow sunlight and air circulation.
    *   **Mulching:** Apply a thick layer (10-15 cm) of organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves, sugarcane trash, paddy straw) around the base of the plant. This insulates the soil, protects roots from freezing, and helps retain warmth.
    *   **Irrigation:** Light irrigation in the evening before a predicted frost can help raise the soil temperature and release latent heat, thereby reducing frost damage. Ensure good drainage to avoid waterlogging.
*   **For Mature Plants:**
    *   **Irrigation:** Maintain adequate soil moisture. A well-hydrated tree is more resilient to cold stress.
    *   **Windbreaks:** Plant taller, hardy trees (e.g., Eucalyptus, Poplar) on the northern and western sides of the orchard to reduce the impact of cold, dry winds.
    *   **Smudging/Smoking:** In commercial orchards, creating smoke by burning organic material (crop residue, dry leaves) on the upwind side can help create a warm air blanket and prevent temperature inversion, thus protecting the trees from frost. This requires careful management to prevent fire hazards.

### B. Protection from Heat (Loo) and Intense Sunlight

Jamun trees can suffer from heat stress, leading to leaf scorching, fruit drop, and reduced fruit quality.

*   **Irrigation:** Provide regular and adequate irrigation, especially during hot, dry periods (Loo) and during fruit development. Deep watering encourages a strong root system, making the tree more resilient.
*   **Mulching:** Maintain a thick layer of organic mulch around the base of the tree. This helps conserve soil moisture, reduces soil temperature, and suppresses weed competition.
*   **Windbreaks:** As mentioned for cold protection, windbreaks also help reduce the desiccating effect of hot, dry winds (Loo), minimizing water loss from the canopy.
*   **White Washing/Reflective Sprays:**
    *   **White Washing:** For the trunk and main branches of young trees, a solution of lime (calcium carbonate) can be applied to reflect sunlight and prevent sunscald.
    *   **Kaolin Clay Spray:** A spray of **Kaolin clay** can be applied to the foliage and fruits. This forms a reflective white film that reduces leaf and fruit temperature, minimizes sunburn, and reduces water loss. Apply **Kaolin clay** at a concentration of 25-50 g/L of water (2.5-5% solution) during peak summer months.
*   **Shade Nets:** For very young plants or newly transplanted saplings, temporary shade nets (e.g., 30-50% shade) can be erected during the hottest parts of the summer to protect them from intense sunlight and heat.
*   **Pruning:** Practice judicious pruning to maintain a balanced canopy that provides some self-shading to fruits and inner branches without being excessively dense, which can hinder air circulation.
