This is not known to affect Jamun.

Smut diseases (Black, False, Kernel, and Loose smut) are primarily diseases of cereal crops (like wheat, rice, maize, sorghum) and some grasses, caused by specific groups of fungi. They are not reported as diseases affecting Jamun (Syzygium cumini). Jamun is susceptible to other fungal diseases such as anthracnose, leaf spot, and rust, but not smuts.
