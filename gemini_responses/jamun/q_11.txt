As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling beetles and weevils in Jamun (Syzygium cumini) in Haryana.

### Control of Beetles and Weevils in Jamun

Beetles and weevils can cause significant damage to Jamun, affecting both leaves (especially young plants) and fruits. Common pests include leaf-feeding weevils (e.g., *Myllocerus* spp.) and fruit borers (which can include certain beetle or weevil larvae).

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Approach:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Orchard Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy fallen infested fruits to break the pest life cycle, especially for fruit borers.
    *   **Pruning:** Remove any infested or damaged branches.
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the area around the trees free of weeds, which can harbor pests.
    *   **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect trees for signs of pest activity (e.g., chewed leaves, holes in fruits, adult insects).

2.  **Mechanical Control:**
    *   **Hand Picking:** On young plants or for small infestations, adult beetles and weevils can be hand-picked and destroyed.
    *   **Shaking:** In the early morning, adults can be dislodged by shaking branches over a sheet and then collected and destroyed.

3.  **Chemical Control (Use only when necessary and follow label instructions carefully):**
    When pest incidence is high and cultural/mechanical methods are insufficient, CIBRC-approved insecticides can be used. Always ensure proper coverage and adhere to the pre-harvest interval (PHI) specified on the product label, especially if fruits are present.

    For controlling leaf-feeding beetles/weevils and fruit borers:

    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** Apply at a rate of 0.3 - 0.4 ml per liter of water. This is effective against various borers and chewing pests.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** Apply at a rate of 0.5 - 1.0 ml per liter of water. This broad-spectrum insecticide is effective against a range of chewing and sucking pests, including beetles and weevils.
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at a rate of 0.5 - 0.75 ml per liter of water. Primarily effective against sucking pests, but can also control some leaf-feeding beetles like flea beetles.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at a rate of 0.2 - 0.4 g per liter of water. Similar to Imidacloprid, effective against leaf-feeding pests.
    *   **Cypermethrin 25% EC:** Apply at a rate of 0.5 - 1.0 ml per liter of water. A synthetic pyrethroid effective against a wide range of insect pests.
    *   **Malathion 50% EC:** Apply at a rate of 1.5 - 2.0 ml per liter of water. A broad-spectrum organophosphate insecticide with a relatively shorter pre-harvest interval.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label, including dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
*   Apply insecticides during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application.

### Sawflies in Jamun

This is not known to affect Jamun significantly in Haryana. Sawflies are generally not considered a major pest of Jamun.
