As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Jamun cultivation in Haryana:

Here's how to address the pests you've mentioned:

### 1. Grasshopper

Grasshoppers are generalist feeders and can occasionally cause damage to Jamun foliage, especially in young plants or during outbreaks.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural/Mechanical:**
    *   Hand-picking and destroying grasshoppers, especially in the early morning when they are less active, can be effective for small infestations.
    *   Maintain field sanitation to reduce breeding sites.
*   **Chemical Control (if infestation is severe):**
    *   **Malathion** 50% EC: Apply at 2.5 ml per liter of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: Apply at 0.5 ml per liter of water.
    *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: Apply at 2.5 ml per liter of water.

### 2. Painted Bug (Bagrada hilaris)

This is not known to affect Jamun. Painted bug is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops like mustard, cabbage, and cauliflower.

### 3. Red Cotton Bug (Dysdercus cingulatus)

This is not known to affect Jamun. Red cotton bug is primarily a pest of cotton and other malvaceous plants.

### 4. Black Ants

Black ants can be a nuisance in Jamun orchards. They often protect sap-sucking pests like aphids, mealybugs, and scale insects to feed on their honeydew secretions. They can also feed on fallen fruits or nectar.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural/Physical:**
    *   Maintain good orchard sanitation by removing fallen fruits and weeds, which can attract ants.
    *   Use sticky bands around the trunk of the Jamun trees to prevent ants from climbing up and accessing the canopy. This is a very effective non-chemical method.
*   **Chemical Control (if ants are a significant problem, especially if protecting other pests):**
    *   **For drenching around the base of the tree or painting the trunk (mixed with clay/lime):**
        *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: Apply at 2.5 ml per liter of water.
    *   **For general ant control in the soil around the tree:**
        *   **Fipronil** 0.3% GR: Apply at 10-15 kg per acre, broadcast or applied around the base of the trees.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully, including dosage, application method, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Apply pesticides during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   Ensure proper safety measures, including wearing protective gear, during pesticide application.
*   For specific local recommendations or severe infestations, it is always advisable to consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts.
