As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach for controlling sucking pests in Jamun, focusing on monitoring, cultural practices, biological control, and judicious use of CIBRC-approved chemical insecticides when necessary.

Sucking pests like Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, Thrips, and Psylla can cause significant damage to Jamun by feeding on plant sap, leading to stunted growth, leaf curling, yellowing, and reduced fruit yield. They can also transmit viral diseases and excrete honeydew, promoting sooty mould growth.

Here's a comprehensive approach:

**1. Monitoring and Early Detection:**
*   Regularly inspect Jamun trees, especially new flushes, tender leaves, and the undersides of leaves, for the presence of pests or symptoms of damage.
*   Yellow sticky traps can be used to monitor adult whiteflies and thrips.

**2. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Pruning:** Remove heavily infested branches or leaves to reduce pest populations. Ensure proper aeration within the canopy.
*   **Weed Management:** Keep the area around Jamun trees free of weeds, as they can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush, tender growth that is more attractive to sucking pests.

**3. Biological Control:**
*   Encourage natural enemies such as ladybird beetles, lacewings, hoverfly larvae, and parasitic wasps, which prey on aphids, whiteflies, and other soft-bodied insects. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

**4. Chemical Control (When necessary):**
If pest populations are high and causing economic damage, chemical intervention may be required. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Apply sprays preferably in the morning or evening hours.

Here are some CIBRC-approved technical chemicals effective against sucking pests in Jamun:

*   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at a rate of **0.5 - 0.75 ml per litre of water**. This is a systemic insecticide effective against aphids, leafhoppers, whiteflies, thrips, and psylla.
*   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at a rate of **0.2 - 0.3 g per litre of water**. Another systemic insecticide with broad-spectrum activity against sucking pests.
*   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply at a rate of **0.2 - 0.3 g per litre of water**. Effective against aphids, whiteflies, and thrips.
*   **Flonicamid 50% WG:** Apply at a rate of **0.3 g per litre of water**. This insecticide specifically targets aphids and whiteflies with a different mode of action, making it useful for resistance management.
*   **Fipronil 5% SC:** Apply at a rate of **1.5 - 2.0 ml per litre of water**. Particularly effective against thrips and also provides control of other sucking pests.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Spray Volume:** Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage, especially the undersides of leaves, by using an appropriate spray volume (typically 200-400 litres per acre depending on tree size).
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, and protective clothing while handling and spraying chemicals.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Strictly observe the recommended pre-harvest interval for each insecticide to ensure the safety of the fruit for consumption.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent pests from developing resistance. Do not use the same chemical repeatedly.

For specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions, it is always advisable to consult with the entomology experts at HAU, Hisar, or your local Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK).
