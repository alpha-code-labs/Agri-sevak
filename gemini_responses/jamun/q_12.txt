As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm that Scale insects and Mealybugs are common sap-sucking pests that can affect Jamun (Syzygium cumini) trees in Haryana. Effective management requires a combination of cultural practices and judicious use of CIBRC-approved insecticides.

Here's how to control Scale insects and Mealybugs in Jamun:

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Control (First Line of Defense):**

*   **Regular Monitoring:** Inspect your Jamun trees frequently, especially the undersides of leaves, stems, and fruit clusters, for early signs of infestation.
*   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy heavily infested branches, twigs, or leaves. This reduces the pest population and improves air circulation.
*   **Water Jet:** For early and localized infestations of mealybugs, a strong jet of water can dislodge them from the plant surfaces.
*   **Sanitation:** Keep the area around the tree free of weeds, which can harbor pests.
*   **Ant Control:** Control ants, as they often protect mealybugs and scales for their honeydew secretions. Apply sticky bands around the tree trunk to prevent ants from climbing.

**2. Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved):**

When cultural methods are insufficient, chemical control may be necessary. Always ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and in crevices where these pests hide. Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

*   **For both Scale Insects and Mealybugs:**

    *   **Horticultural Mineral Oil (HMO):**
        *   Apply **Horticultural Mineral Oil** at a concentration of **10-15 ml/L** of water. This works by smothering the insects. It is particularly effective against younger stages (crawlers of scales and nymphs of mealybugs). Ensure complete coverage.
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:**
        *   Use **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL** at a rate of **0.5-0.75 ml/L** of water. This is a systemic insecticide that is absorbed by the plant and kills pests as they feed.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:**
        *   Apply **Thiamethoxam 25% WG** at a rate of **0.2-0.3 g/L** of water. This is another systemic insecticide effective against sucking pests.
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:**
        *   Use **Buprofezin 25% SC** at a rate of **1.25 ml/L** of water. This is an insect growth regulator that interferes with the molting process of nymphs, preventing them from developing into adults. It is particularly effective against younger stages.
    *   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:**
        *   Apply **Spirotetramat 150 OD** at a rate of **0.75-1 ml/L** of water. This is a systemic insecticide with translaminar and ambimobile movement, providing excellent control of hidden pests.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Timing of Application:** Apply insecticides when pests are in their younger, more vulnerable stages (e.g., scale crawlers, mealybug nymphs).
*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough wetting of all infested plant parts, including the undersides of leaves and stem crevices.
*   **Safety:** Always read and follow the instructions on the insecticide label regarding dosage, application, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and safety precautions (wearing gloves, masks, etc.).
*   **Pollinators:** Avoid spraying during the flowering period to protect beneficial insects like bees. If spraying is necessary, do it in the late evening or early morning when pollinators are less active.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance in pest populations.

By implementing these integrated pest management strategies, you can effectively control Scale insects and Mealybugs in your Jamun trees.
