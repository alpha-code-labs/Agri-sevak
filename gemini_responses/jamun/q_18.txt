As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified recommendations for the use of growth regulators and micronutrients in Jamun (Syzygium cumini) in Haryana:

1.  **Ethephon (Ethrel)**
    *   **Purpose:** To promote uniform fruit ripening and enhance fruit color.
    *   **Recommended Dose:** Apply **Ethephon** (39% SL formulation) at a concentration of **1.0 - 1.5 ml per liter of water**. This translates to approximately 390-585 ppm.
    *   **Timing:** Spray when fruits start changing color from green to pinkish-red, typically 7-10 days before anticipated harvest. Ensure thorough coverage of the fruit canopy.

2.  **2,4-D**
    *   While **2,4-D Sodium Salt** or **2,4-D Amine Salt** is a synthetic auxin and can act as a growth regulator at extremely low concentrations (e.g., for fruit drop control in some fruit crops), its specific recommendation as a growth regulator for Jamun in Haryana is not a standard or widely adopted practice. Its primary agricultural use is as a selective herbicide. Therefore, its use as a growth regulator for Jamun is generally not recommended due to the risk of phytotoxicity if not applied at precise, extremely low concentrations, which can be challenging for farmers.

3.  **Boron**
    *   **Purpose:** Boron is an essential micronutrient critical for pollen germination, fruit set, and overall fruit development. Deficiency can lead to poor fruit set and malformed fruits.
    *   **Recommended Dose:** Foliar spray of **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate) at a concentration of **1-2 g per liter of water** (0.1% - 0.2% solution).
    *   **Timing:** Apply one spray before flowering (at the bud development stage) and another spray after fruit set, particularly if boron deficiency symptoms are observed or soil tests indicate low boron levels.
