As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Scab, Canker, Gummosis, and Lichen in Jamun (Syzygium cumini) in Haryana:

---

**1. Scab:**
This is not known to affect Jamun as a distinct disease entity. While some fungal infections might cause scab-like lesions, a specific "Scab" disease (like those caused by *Venturia* or *Elsinoë* species in other fruits) is not commonly reported or recognized as a primary disease of Jamun in our region.

**2. Canker:**
Canker diseases are known to affect Jamun, often caused by various fungal or bacterial pathogens, leading to sunken lesions on stems and branches, sometimes accompanied by gum exudation.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Prune affected branches well below the visible canker, ensuring clean cuts.
    *   Sanitize pruning tools with a 10% bleach solution or methylated spirit before and after each cut to prevent disease spread.
    *   Remove and destroy pruned material.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   After pruning, apply a protective fungicidal paste or spray to the cut surfaces and affected areas.
    *   For fungal cankers:
        *   Spray with **Carbendazim** at 1.0-1.5 g/L of water.
        *   Alternatively, apply a paste made of **Copper Oxychloride** (50 g in 100 ml water) to the scraped canker area.
    *   For bacterial cankers (if suspected):
        *   Spray with a combination of **Streptomycin Sulphate + Tetracycline Hydrochloride** (e.g., 90:10 formulation) at 1.0 g/10 L of water (100 ppm).

**3. Gummosis:**
Gummosis in Jamun is characterized by the exudation of gum from the bark, often indicating underlying stress, injury, or infection by fungi (e.g., *Phytophthora* species, *Lasiodiplodia theobromae*) or bacteria.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Ensure proper drainage around the tree base to prevent waterlogging, which can predispose trees to root and collar rot pathogens.
    *   Avoid mechanical injuries to the trunk and roots.
    *   Maintain tree vigor through balanced nutrition and irrigation.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Gently scrape off the affected bark until healthy tissue is exposed.
    *   Apply a fungicidal paste to the scraped area:
        *   Paste made of **Copper Oxychloride** (50 g in 100 ml water).
        *   Alternatively, a paste of **Carbendazim** (20 g in 100 ml water).
    *   For systemic protection, especially if *Phytophthora* is suspected:
        *   Drench the soil around the tree base with **Fosetyl-aluminium** at 2.5 g/L of water.
        *   Alternatively, spray the trunk and lower branches with **Copper Oxychloride** at 2.5-3.0 g/L of water.

**4. Lichen:**
Lichens are symbiotic organisms (fungus and alga) that grow on the bark of trees. They are epiphytes and generally do not harm the Jamun tree as they do not draw nutrients from it. Their presence often indicates good air quality and a healthy, mature tree.

*   **Control:**
    *   Control is generally **not recommended or necessary** as lichens are harmless to the tree.
    *   If removal is desired for aesthetic reasons or if they are perceived to harbor pests (which is rare), they can be gently scraped off with a stiff brush during the dry season.
    *   A very mild spray of **Copper Oxychloride** (1.0 g/L of water) can deter their growth, but this is usually not warranted given their benign nature. Focus should be on maintaining overall tree health.
