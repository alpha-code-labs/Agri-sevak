As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I advise that addressing micronutrient deficiencies in Jamun (Syzygium cumini) is crucial for optimal growth, yield, and fruit quality. The first and most critical step is always a comprehensive **soil and leaf tissue analysis** to accurately diagnose the specific deficiency and its severity. Blind application of micronutrients can lead to imbalances or toxicity.

Here's how to address common micronutrient deficiencies in Jamun, using CIBRC approved technical chemical names and metric units:

### General Recommendations:
*   **Soil Testing:** Conduct soil tests every 2-3 years to monitor nutrient levels.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management:** Combine organic manures (FYM, compost) with chemical fertilizers to improve soil health and nutrient availability.
*   **Proper pH Management:** Soil pH significantly affects micronutrient availability. For Jamun, a slightly acidic to neutral pH (6.0-7.0) is generally preferred.

### Specific Micronutrient Deficiencies and Management:

#### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency
*   **Symptoms:** Small leaves (little leaf), rosetting of leaves, interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, reduced fruit size and yield.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Zinc sulfate heptahydrate** at 20-25 kg/acre or **Zinc sulfate monohydrate** at 10-12 kg/acre, broadcast evenly and incorporate into the soil, preferably before monsoon or during dormant season, once every 2-3 years. For individual trees, apply 50-100 g of **Zinc sulfate heptahydrate** per mature tree.
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.5% solution of **Zinc sulfate heptahydrate** (5 g/L of water) mixed with 0.25% (2.5 g/L) of unslaked lime to neutralize acidity. Alternatively, use 0.1% solution of **Chelated Zinc (Zn-EDTA)** (1 g/L of water). Apply 2-3 sprays at 15-day intervals, starting at new flush emergence.

#### 2. Iron (Fe) / Ferrous Deficiency
*   **Symptoms:** Prominent interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on young leaves, with veins remaining green. Severe deficiency can lead to complete yellowing or whitening of leaves.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Soil Application:** In alkaline soils, soil application of iron is often ineffective. However, for mild deficiencies, apply **Ferrous sulfate heptahydrate** at 200-500 g per mature tree, or **Ferrous EDTA** at 10-20 g per mature tree, mixed with organic manure and applied in the root zone.
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.5-1% solution of **Ferrous sulfate heptahydrate** (5-10 g/L of water) mixed with 0.25% (2.5 g/L) of unslaked lime. Alternatively, use 0.1% solution of **Ferrous EDTA** (1 g/L of water). Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, targeting young leaves.

#### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency
*   **Symptoms:** Dieback of growing points, stunted growth, cracking of fruits/stems, poor fruit set, internal corking of fruits, and sometimes gum exudation.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Borax (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate)** at 50-100 g per mature tree or **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** at 25-50 g per mature tree, mixed with soil in the root zone, once every 2-3 years.
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.1-0.2% solution of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (1-2 g/L of water). Apply 1-2 sprays, especially before flowering and during fruit development.

#### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency
*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, distorted new leaves, tip burn of young leaves, weak stems, and sometimes poor fruit development. While blossom end rot is common in other fruits, it's less typical for Jamun.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Soil Application:** For long-term improvement, apply **Gypsum (Calcium sulfate dihydrate)** at 200-500 kg/acre, depending on soil type and pH. For immediate effect, apply **Calcium nitrate** at 50-100 g per mature tree.
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.5-1% solution of **Calcium nitrate** (5-10 g/L of water) or 0.5% solution of **Calcium chloride** (5 g/L of water). Multiple sprays may be required during critical growth stages, especially during fruit development.

#### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency
*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, starting from leaf margins and progressing inwards, often with reddish or purplish tints. Leaves may become brittle.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Magnesium sulfate heptahydrate** (Epsom salt) at 20-50 kg/acre or 100-200 g per mature tree, broadcast or in the root zone.
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.5-1% solution of **Magnesium sulfate heptahydrate** (5-10 g/L of water). Apply 2-3 sprays at 15-day intervals, targeting affected leaves.

#### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency
*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, similar to iron deficiency but often with a finer network of green veins, sometimes leading to small necrotic spots.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Manganese sulfate monohydrate** at 10-20 kg/acre or 50-100 g per mature tree, broadcast or in the root zone.
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.5% solution of **Manganese sulfate monohydrate** (5 g/L of water) mixed with 0.25% (2.5 g/L) of unslaked lime. Alternatively, use 0.1% solution of **Manganese EDTA** (1 g/L of water). Apply 2-3 sprays at 15-day intervals.

### Important Considerations:
*   **Timing:** Foliar sprays are most effective when applied to young, actively growing leaves.
*   **Water Quality:** Ensure good quality water for spraying.
*   **Adjuvants:** Consider adding a non-ionic spreader/sticker to foliar sprays for better coverage and absorption.
*   **Caution:** Always read and follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions for all chemical products. Avoid spraying during hot periods of the day to prevent leaf scorching.
*   **Consultation:** For precise recommendations tailored to your specific farm conditions, it is always advisable to consult with local agricultural extension officers or HAU experts after obtaining soil and leaf analysis reports.
