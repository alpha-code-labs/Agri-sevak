Mites, including Red Spider Mite (*Tetranychus urticae*) and Rust Mite (*Eriophyes* spp.), can cause significant damage to Jamun (Syzygium cumini) trees, affecting leaf health and fruit quality. Effective management requires an integrated approach.

**Symptoms of Mite Infestation:**

*   **Red Spider Mite:** Initial symptoms include fine yellow or white stippling on the upper surface of leaves. As infestation progresses, leaves may turn bronzed or reddish-brown, and fine webbing can be observed on the undersides of leaves, especially in severe cases.
*   **Rust Mite:** These microscopic mites cause a characteristic russeting, bronzing, or silvery appearance on leaves and fruits. Infested fruits may develop a rough, leathery texture, become stunted, or crack, leading to reduced market value.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Mites in Jamun:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Regular Monitoring:** Inspect trees frequently, especially the undersides of leaves, to detect mite infestations early.
    *   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy severely infested leaves or branches to reduce mite populations.
    *   **Water Management:** Ensure adequate irrigation to prevent water stress, as stressed plants are more susceptible to mite attacks. Overhead irrigation can sometimes help wash off mites.
    *   **Weed Control:** Keep the area around Jamun trees free of weeds, as many weeds can act as alternate hosts for mites.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Conserve natural enemies such as predatory mites (e.g., *Amblyseius* spp.), ladybird beetles, and lacewings, which feed on pest mites. Avoid using broad-spectrum insecticides that can harm these beneficial insects.

3.  **Chemical Control (Acaricides):**
    When mite populations reach damaging levels and cultural/biological methods are insufficient, chemical control may be necessary. Always ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves, and rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

    **CIBRC Approved Acaricides for Jamun:**

    *   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** Apply at a rate of **0.5 - 0.75 ml/L** of water. This is effective against various mite stages, including eggs and nymphs.
    *   **Fenpyroximate 5% SC:** Use at a concentration of **0.5 - 1.0 ml/L** of water. It provides quick knockdown and residual activity against mites.
    *   **Propargite 57% EC:** Apply at **1.0 - 1.5 ml/L** of water. This is a broad-spectrum acaricide effective against a wide range of mites.
    *   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP:** For rust mites and general mite suppression, especially in cooler weather, apply at **2.0 - 3.0 g/L** of water. It also has fungicidal properties.
    *   **Abamectin 1.9% EC:** Use at **0.3 - 0.5 ml/L** of water. This is effective against mites and also has some insecticidal activity.

    **Important Considerations for Chemical Application:**
    *   **Timing:** Apply acaricides when mite populations are building up, typically during dry and warm periods.
    *   **Coverage:** Ensure complete coverage of the foliage, especially the undersides of leaves where mites often reside.
    *   **Rotation:** Rotate between different classes of acaricides to prevent the development of resistance in mite populations.
    *   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always observe the specified Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) mentioned on the product label to ensure the safety of the fruit for consumption.
    *   **Safety:** Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and application, and follow all safety instructions on the product label.
