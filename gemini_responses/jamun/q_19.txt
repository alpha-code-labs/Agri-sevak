Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the importance of balanced nutrition for optimal growth and yield of Jamun trees. Macro-nutrient deficiencies (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium) can significantly impact tree health, flowering, and fruit production.

The most accurate way to address these deficiencies is through a **soil test**. I strongly recommend getting your soil tested at the HAU Soil Testing Laboratory or any accredited lab in Haryana. This will provide precise recommendations tailored to your specific field conditions.

However, based on general observations and scientific principles for Jamun cultivation in Haryana, here's how to address common macro-nutrient deficiencies:

### General Approach to Nutrient Management

1.  **Soil Testing:** This is the foundational step. A soil test report will indicate the exact levels of available N, P, and K, allowing for precise fertilizer application.
2.  **Organic Matter:** Regular application of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost (20-50 kg per bearing tree annually) significantly improves soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability.
3.  **Application Method:** Fertilizers should generally be applied in a ring around the tree, 30-60 cm away from the trunk, extending to the drip line. For mature trees, it can be broadcast within the canopy area and lightly incorporated into the soil, followed by irrigation.

### Addressing Specific Macro-nutrient Deficiencies

#### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** General yellowing of older leaves (chlorosis), stunted growth, reduced leaf size, poor flowering, and fruit set.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Fertilizer:** **Urea** (46% Nitrogen)
    *   **Dosage (General Recommendation):**
        *   **Young Trees (1-3 years):** 50-150 g of **Urea** per tree per year.
        *   **Bearing Trees (4+ years):** 200-500 g of **Urea** per tree per year.
    *   **Application:** Apply in 2-3 split doses. The first dose typically before the monsoon (May-June) and subsequent doses post-monsoon (September-October) or during fruit development. Ensure proper irrigation after application.

#### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Dark green or purplish discoloration of older leaves, stunted root growth, delayed maturity, poor flowering, and reduced fruit quality.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Fertilizer:** **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% Nitrogen, 46% P2O5) or **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5).
    *   **Dosage (General Recommendation):**
        *   **Young Trees (1-3 years):** 50-100 g of **DAP** per tree per year OR 150-300 g of **SSP** per tree per year.
        *   **Bearing Trees (4+ years):** 200-400 g of **DAP** per tree per year OR 600-1200 g of **SSP** per tree per year.
    *   **Application:** Phosphorus is less mobile in the soil, so it's best applied as a single basal dose, usually before the monsoon (May-June) or during planting. Incorporate it well into the soil.

#### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Scorching or browning of leaf margins (especially older leaves), weak stems, poor fruit development, reduced fruit size and quality, and increased susceptibility to diseases.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Fertilizer:** **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** (60% K2O) or **Sulphate of Potash (SOP)** (50% K2O).
    *   **Dosage (General Recommendation):**
        *   **Young Trees (1-3 years):** 50-150 g of **Muriate of Potash** per tree per year.
        *   **Bearing Trees (4+ years):** 200-500 g of **Muriate of Potash** per tree per year.
    *   **Application:** Apply in 2 split doses. The first dose before the monsoon (May-June) and the second during fruit development (August-September).

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Irrigation:** Always ensure adequate irrigation after fertilizer application to help dissolve nutrients and make them available to the roots.
*   **Tree Age and Health:** Adjust dosages based on the age, size, and overall health of the tree. Older, larger, and heavily bearing trees will require more nutrients.
*   **Soil Type:** Sandy soils may require more frequent, smaller applications, while clayey soils can hold nutrients better.

For precise and tailored recommendations, please consult with the HAU extension services or your local Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) after obtaining a soil test report.
