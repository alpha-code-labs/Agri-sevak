Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding various rot types in Jamun (Syzygium cumini). While "rot" is a broad term encompassing many diseases, Jamun trees are indeed susceptible to several fungal and oomycete pathogens that cause root, collar, foot, stem, fruit, seed, and seedling rots. Black rot and neck rot are often specific manifestations or localized forms of these broader rot diseases.

Effective control requires an integrated approach combining cultural practices, biological methods, and judicious use of CIBRC-approved chemical fungicides.

### **I. General Cultural Practices (Prevention is Key)**

1.  **Site Selection and Soil Management:**
    *   Ensure well-drained soil. Jamun does not tolerate waterlogging, which is a primary predisposing factor for most rot diseases, especially those caused by *Phytophthora* and *Pythium*.
    *   Improve soil structure by incorporating organic matter (farmyard manure, compost) to enhance drainage and aeration.
    *   Avoid planting in low-lying areas prone to water accumulation.
2.  **Irrigation Management:**
    *   Irrigate judiciously, avoiding overwatering. Allow the soil to dry slightly between irrigations.
    *   Avoid direct wetting of the tree trunk, especially at the collar region, during irrigation. Use drip irrigation where possible.
3.  **Sanitation and Pruning:**
    *   Remove and destroy all infected plant parts (leaves, twigs, fruits, branches) to reduce inoculum sources.
    *   Prune dead, diseased, or overcrowded branches to improve air circulation within the canopy.
    *   Disinfect pruning tools with a 10% bleach solution or methylated spirit between cuts to prevent disease spread.
4.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Provide balanced nutrition to enhance tree vigor and natural resistance. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can lead to lush, susceptible growth.
5.  **Weed Control:**
    *   Keep the area around the tree base free of weeds, as they can harbor pathogens and impede air circulation.
6.  **Avoid Injury:**
    *   Protect the trunk and roots from mechanical injuries during cultivation, as wounds serve as entry points for pathogens.

### **II. Specific Rot Types and Control Measures**

#### **A. Root Rot, Collar Rot, Foot Rot, Crown Rot, Stem Rot**
These are often caused by soil-borne fungi and oomycetes like *Phytophthora*, *Fusarium*, *Rhizoctonia*, and sometimes *Ganoderma*.
*   **Symptoms:** Yellowing and wilting of leaves, stunted growth, dieback of branches, cankers or lesions on the trunk at or below the soil line, rotting of roots, and eventual tree death.
*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Improve drainage around affected trees.
    *   Expose the collar region to air by removing soil if symptoms are observed.
    *   Avoid piling soil or mulch directly against the trunk.
*   **Chemical Control (Drenching/Painting):**
    *   **For *Phytophthora* related rots:** Drench the soil around the tree base with a solution of **Metalaxyl** + **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water, or **Fosetyl-aluminium** at 2.5 g/L of water. Repeat after 15-20 days if necessary.
    *   **For *Fusarium* and *Rhizoctonia* related rots:** Drench the soil around the tree base with **Carbendazim** at 1-2 g/L of water, or **Thiophanate-methyl** at 1 g/L of water.
    *   **For visible lesions (Foot/Collar Rot):** Scrape off the infected bark and paint the wound with a paste made of **Copper oxychloride** (100 g in 1 L water with a sticker) or **Carbendazim** (50 g in 1 L water with a sticker).

#### **B. Fruit Rot (e.g., Anthracnose, Black Rot)**
Often caused by *Colletotrichum gloeosporioides*, *Alternaria*, or *Phytophthora*.
*   **Symptoms:** Dark, sunken spots on fruits, often with concentric rings, leading to complete rotting and premature fruit drop.
*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Collect and destroy all fallen infected fruits.
    *   Prune out dead or diseased twigs and branches that can harbor pathogens.
*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
    *   Spray with **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water, or **Carbendazim** at 1 g/L of water, or **Propiconazole** at 0.5-1 ml/L of water.
    *   Initiate sprays at fruit set and repeat at 10-15 day intervals, especially during humid weather, until harvest (observing pre-harvest intervals).
    *   **Copper oxychloride** at 2-3 g/L of water can also be effective.

#### **C. Seed Rot and Seedling Rot (Damping-off)**
Caused by various soil-borne pathogens like *Pythium*, *Phytophthora*, *Rhizoctonia*, and *Fusarium*.
*   **Symptoms:** Seeds fail to germinate (seed rot), or young seedlings collapse at the soil line (damping-off) before or after emergence.
*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Use healthy, disease-free seeds.
    *   Use sterilized potting mix or soil for nurseries.
    *   Ensure proper drainage in nursery beds/pots.
    *   Avoid overcrowding of seedlings.
*   **Chemical Control (Seed Treatment & Soil Drench):**
    *   **Seed Treatment:** Treat Jamun seeds before sowing with **Carbendazim** at 2 g/kg of seed, or **Thiram** at 2.5 g/kg of seed, or **Captan** at 2.5 g/kg of seed.
    *   **Soil Drench (for seedlings):** If damping-off appears, drench the nursery beds/pots with **Carbendazim** at 1 g/L of water, or **Metalaxyl** + **Mancozeb** at 2 g/L of water.

### **III. Biological Control**

*   **Trichoderma spp.:** Apply *Trichoderma viride* or *Trichoderma harzianum* (bio-fungicide) to the soil at 2.5 kg/acre mixed with 50 kg of farmyard manure. This can be done during planting or as a preventive measure for established trees. It helps suppress soil-borne pathogens.
*   **Pseudomonas fluorescens:** Apply *Pseudomonas fluorescens* (bio-bactericide) to the soil at 2.5 kg/acre mixed with 50 kg of farmyard manure, or as a seed treatment at 10 g/kg of seed.

### **Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the fungicide label for correct dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) for all chemical sprays, especially on fruits.
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in pathogens.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions.

By implementing these integrated management strategies, you can effectively control various rot diseases in your Jamun orchard.
