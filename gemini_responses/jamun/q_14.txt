Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the challenges posed by soil pests in orchards. Termites and nematodes can significantly impact the health and productivity of Jamun trees. Here's scientifically verified advice for their control:

### 1. Termites (Dimag)

Termites are a serious threat, especially in dry regions like Haryana. They attack the roots and collar region of Jamun trees, hollowing out the wood and leading to weakening, wilting, and eventually death of the tree.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Remove all dead wood, stumps, and debris from the orchard, as these serve as breeding grounds for termites.
    *   Avoid direct contact of organic manure or farmyard manure with the tree trunk. Apply it slightly away from the base.
    *   Ensure proper irrigation, as termites prefer dry conditions. Maintaining adequate soil moisture can deter them.
    *   Before planting new trees, deep ploughing can expose and destroy termite colonies.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **For existing trees:** Drench the soil around the base of the affected trees.
        *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC**: Mix 2.5 ml per liter of water. Drench 2-5 liters of this solution per tree around the root zone, depending on the tree's age and size. Ensure the solution penetrates the soil effectively.
    *   **For new plantations (pre-planting treatment):**
        *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC**: Mix 5 ml per liter of water. Apply 5-10 liters of this solution per pit before planting the sapling.

### 2. Nematodes (Root-knot Nematodes - *Meloidogyne* spp.)

Root-knot nematodes are microscopic worms that infect the roots of Jamun trees, causing characteristic swellings or galls (knots). These galls disrupt the root system's ability to absorb water and nutrients, leading to stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, reduced fruit yield, and increased susceptibility to other diseases.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Use only healthy, nematode-free planting material from certified nurseries.
    *   In nursery beds, solarization (covering moist soil with clear plastic sheets during hot months) can significantly reduce nematode populations.
    *   Incorporate organic matter like well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or **Neem cake** (500 g to 1 kg per tree) into the soil around the root zone. Neem cake has nematicidal properties and also promotes beneficial soil microbes.
    *   Maintain good soil health and fertility to help trees tolerate nematode damage.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Apply granular nematicides around the root zone of the affected trees and lightly incorporate them into the soil, followed by irrigation.
    *   **Carbofuran 3% G**: Apply 30-60 grams per tree, depending on the tree's age and size.
    *   **Fluensulfone 2% GR**: Apply 50-100 grams per tree, depending on the tree's age and size.

**Important Precautions:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (gloves, mask, protective clothing) while handling and applying chemicals.
*   Do not apply chemicals during flowering to protect pollinators.
*   Observe the recommended pre-harvest interval (PHI) before harvesting fruits.
*   For severe infestations or if you are unsure, it is always advisable to consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions.

By adopting these integrated pest management strategies, you can effectively control soil pests and ensure the healthy growth and productivity of your Jamun orchard.
