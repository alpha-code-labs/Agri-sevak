Here are the recommended doses for organic manures in Jamun cultivation:

*   **Farm Yard Manure (FYM):**
    *   For young Jamun plants (1-3 years old): 10-20 kg per plant per year.
    *   For established/mature Jamun trees (4 years and above): 20-50 kg per plant per year.
    *   *Application:* Apply during autumn (October-November) or early spring (February-March) by incorporating it into the soil around the tree basin.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   For young Jamun plants (1-3 years old): 5-10 kg per plant per year.
    *   For established/mature Jamun trees (4 years and above): 10-20 kg per plant per year.
    *   *Application:* Similar to FYM, apply during autumn or early spring, incorporating it into the soil around the tree basin.

*   **Sagarika (or similar seaweed extract-based bio-stimulants):**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** 2-3 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Soil Drench/Fertigation:** 1-2 litres per acre.
    *   *Application:* Apply 2-3 times during the active growth period, typically at pre-flowering, fruit set, and fruit development stages. For foliar spray, ensure complete coverage of the foliage. For soil drench, apply around the root zone.
