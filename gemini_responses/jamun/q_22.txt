As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following cultivation practices for Jamun (Syzygium cumini) in Haryana:

**1. Sowing Method/Pattern:**
*   **Propagation:** Jamun is primarily propagated through seeds for raising rootstock, or vegetatively through budding or grafting (e.g., patch budding, shield budding) for desired varieties. Vegetative propagation ensures true-to-type plants and earlier fruiting.
*   **Nursery Raising:** For seed propagation, mature seeds are extracted from ripe fruits, washed, and sown immediately in well-prepared nursery beds or polybags (15 cm x 25 cm) filled with a suitable potting mix (e.g., soil, sand, farmyard manure in 1:1:1 ratio). Seeds have a short viability.
*   **Field Planting:** One to two-year-old healthy seedlings or grafted plants are transplanted from the nursery to the main field. Pits of 1 meter x 1 meter x 1 meter are dug, exposed to sunlight for 15-20 days, and then refilled with a mixture of topsoil, 20 kg of well-decomposed farmyard manure, and 1 kg of neem cake.
*   **Planting Pattern:** A square or rectangular system is generally adopted for planting Jamun trees in the field.

**2. Planting Depth:**
*   **For Seeds in Nursery:** Seeds should be sown at a depth of approximately 1-2 cm in nursery beds or polybags.
*   **For Transplanting Seedlings/Grafted Plants:** The root ball of the seedling or grafted plant should be placed in the pit such that the soil level around the plant is the same as it was in the nursery. Ensure that the graft union (if applicable) remains well above the soil surface to prevent scion rooting.

**3. Spacing:**
*   For traditional planting, a spacing of **8 meters x 8 meters** is recommended. This allows for adequate growth and development of the tree canopy.
*   This spacing accommodates approximately 156 plants per acre.

**4. Seed Dose (for Nursery Raising):**
*   Since Jamun is a tree crop primarily propagated by transplanting seedlings or grafted plants, there isn't a "seed dose per acre" in the conventional sense like field crops.
*   For raising seedlings in a nursery, the number of seeds required depends on the desired number of plants for the field, accounting for germination percentage and seedling survival rates.
*   To achieve the recommended plant density of approximately 156 plants per acre (at 8m x 8m spacing), one would need to sow a sufficient number of seeds in the nursery, typically aiming for 20-30% more seeds than the target number of plants to account for losses.
