As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend an integrated approach combining cultural, mechanical, and chemical methods for effective weed control in Jamun orchards in Haryana.

### Integrated Weed Management in Jamun Orchards

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Methods:**

*   **Manual Weeding/Hoeing:** Particularly effective for young weeds and around the base of young Jamun trees where chemical application might be risky. This should be done regularly, especially during the monsoon season.
*   **Mulching:** Applying organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves, wood chips) around the base of Jamun trees can suppress weed growth, conserve soil moisture, and improve soil health.
*   **Intercropping:** In young Jamun orchards (up to 3-5 years), suitable short-duration crops can be grown in the inter-row spaces. This helps in weed suppression through competition and provides additional income. Ensure the intercrops do not compete excessively with Jamun trees for nutrients and water.
*   **Orchard Floor Management:** Keep the inter-row spaces clean by regular mowing or slashing, especially before weeds set seed.

**2. Chemical Control (Herbicides):**

For general control of broadleaf and narrowleaf weeds in the inter-row spaces, directed application of non-selective herbicides is recommended. Extreme care must be taken to avoid contact with the Jamun tree trunk (especially young trees), foliage, and fruit. Use a protective shield while spraying.

*   **For Broadleaf Weeds (e.g., Bathu, Congress grass) and Narrowleaf Weeds (e.g., Phalaris minor):**
    *   **Glyphosate (41% SL):** Apply at 3.75 - 5.0 litres per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water. This is a systemic, non-selective herbicide effective against most annual and perennial weeds. Apply when weeds are actively growing and have sufficient foliage.
    *   **Paraquat dichloride (24% SL):** Apply at 2.0 - 2.5 litres per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water. This is a contact, non-selective herbicide that provides quick knockdown of young weeds. It is effective for controlling weeds that have emerged.

**3. Specific Control for Amarbail (Cuscuta spp.):**

Amarbail is a parasitic weed that requires prompt action.

*   **Manual Removal:** The most effective method is to manually remove Amarbail as soon as it is noticed, before it spreads and sets seeds. If it has infested a branch, prune the affected branch and destroy the removed plant material by burning.
*   **Chemical Control (Directed Spot Application):** For localized patches, a very carefully directed spot application of **Paraquat dichloride (24% SL)** at 5-7 ml per litre of water can be used to burn off the Amarbail. Ensure absolutely no spray drift or contact with the Jamun tree foliage or branches, as it will cause severe damage. This method should only be used by trained personnel.

**4. Specific Control for Orobanche:**

*   This is not known to affect Jamun. Orobanche species are root parasites primarily of solanaceous crops (like tomato, brinjal, potato), tobacco, and some oilseed crops, but not typically a host for Jamun.

**Important Precautions for Herbicide Application:**

*   Always read and follow the label instructions carefully.
*   Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, and protective clothing.
*   Apply herbicides on a calm day to minimize spray drift.
*   Use a spray shield to protect Jamun tree trunks and foliage, especially for young trees.
*   Avoid spraying during flowering or fruiting stages of Jamun if possible, or ensure no contact with flowers/fruits.
*   Do not allow animals to graze in the treated area immediately after application.
*   Clean spray equipment thoroughly after use.
*   Store herbicides safely, away from children, food, and feed.
