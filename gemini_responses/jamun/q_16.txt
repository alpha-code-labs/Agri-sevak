As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following fertilizer schedule for Jamun (Syzygium cumini) cultivation in Haryana. Please note that these are general recommendations, and a soil test is highly advisable to determine the precise nutrient requirements of your specific orchard.

**General Principles for Fertilizer Application:**

*   **Soil Testing:** Always conduct a soil test every 2-3 years to understand the nutrient status of your soil and tailor fertilizer application accordingly.
*   **Timing:** Fertilizers should be applied in split doses for better nutrient utilization.
    *   Phosphorus and Potassium are generally applied as a basal dose once a year, either after fruit harvest or before flowering.
    *   Nitrogen should be split into 2-3 applications: one after fruit harvest, one before flowering, and one during fruit development.
*   **Method:** Apply granular fertilizers in a ring around the tree canopy, 30-60 cm away from the trunk, and incorporate them lightly into the soil, followed by irrigation.

**Fertilizer Recommendations for Jamun:**

**1. Young, Non-Bearing Trees (1-3 years):**
The aim is to promote vigorous vegetative growth and establishment.

*   **Year 1:**
    *   **Urea:** 100 g per tree
    *   **Diammonium Phosphate:** 100 g per tree
    *   **Muriate of Potash:** 50 g per tree
*   **Year 2:**
    *   **Urea:** 200 g per tree
    *   **Diammonium Phosphate:** 200 g per tree
    *   **Muriate of Potash:** 100 g per tree
*   **Year 3:**
    *   **Urea:** 300 g per tree
    *   **Diammonium Phosphate:** 300 g per tree
    *   **Muriate of Potash:** 150 g per tree

**2. Bearing Trees (4 years and above):**
The doses should be increased gradually as the tree matures and starts bearing fruit. For fully mature, high-yielding trees (10+ years), the maximum recommended doses can be applied.

*   **Nitrogen (N):**
    *   Apply 500-750 g of **Urea** per tree per year.
    *   Split this into 2-3 applications:
        *   1/3rd after fruit harvest.
        *   1/3rd before flowering (February-March).
        *   1/3rd during fruit development (May-June).
*   **Phosphorus (P):**
    *   Apply 300-500 g of **Diammonium Phosphate** per tree per year.
    *   Alternatively, if using **Single Superphosphate**, apply 750-1250 g per tree per year (as **Single Superphosphate** contains less P and also provides Sulphur).
    *   Apply as a single basal dose after fruit harvest or before flowering.
*   **Potassium (K):**
    *   Apply 500-750 g of **Muriate of Potash** per tree per year.
    *   Apply as a single basal dose after fruit harvest or before flowering.
*   **Sulphur (S):**
    *   If not using **Single Superphosphate**, apply 100-200 g of elemental **Sulphur** (e.g., Bentonite Sulphur) per tree per year, especially if soil test indicates deficiency.
    *   Alternatively, apply 20-40 kg of elemental **Sulphur** per acre annually.

**3. Nano Fertilizers:**
Nano fertilizers offer high nutrient use efficiency through foliar application, reducing the need for conventional granular fertilizers. They are supplementary and not a complete replacement for basal granular applications, especially for P and K.

*   **Nano-Urea:**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Application:** Foliar spray.
    *   **Timing:** 2-3 sprays during active vegetative growth and fruit development stages (e.g., one spray during pre-flowering, one during fruit set, and one during fruit enlargement).
*   **Nano-DAP:**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Application:** Foliar spray.
    *   **Timing:** 1-2 sprays during flowering and fruit set stages to support reproductive growth.

**4. NPK Complex Fertilizers:**
If using NPK complex fertilizers (e.g., 15:15:15, 19:19:19), calculate the amount required to meet the N, P, and K recommendations mentioned above. For example, if a tree needs 500 g N, 250 g P, and 500 g K, and you are using 15:15:15 NPK, you would need approximately 3.3 kg of 15:15:15 NPK to supply 500 g of N, P, and K each. Adjust the dose based on the specific NPK ratio of the fertilizer.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Organic Matter:** Supplement chemical fertilizers with well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost. Apply 10-20 kg of FYM per young tree and 30-50 kg per mature bearing tree annually, mixed into the soil around the tree basin. This improves soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability.
*   **Micronutrients:** Jamun trees may also require micronutrients like Zinc (Zn), Boron (B), Iron (Fe), and Manganese (Mn), especially in alkaline soils common in Haryana. If a deficiency is observed or indicated by soil test, apply a suitable micronutrient mixture as a foliar spray or soil application. For example, Zinc Sulphate (200-300 g/tree) or Borax (50-100 g/tree) can be applied if deficient.

Always ensure proper irrigation after applying granular fertilizers to facilitate nutrient dissolution and uptake.
