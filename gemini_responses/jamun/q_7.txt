Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing diseases in Jamun (Syzygium cumini) in Haryana. Effective disease management relies on an integrated approach combining cultural practices and judicious use of CIBRC-approved chemicals.

Here's how to control Dieback and Twig blight in Jamun:

**Control of Dieback and Twig Blight in Jamun:**
Dieback and Twig blight are common fungal diseases in Jamun, often caused by pathogens like *Botryodiplodia theobromae* or *Colletotrichum gloeosporioides*. They lead to the drying and death of twigs and branches, starting from the tip.

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Pruning:** Regularly inspect trees and prune all affected twigs and branches well below the diseased portion, ensuring a clean cut. Sterilize pruning tools with alcohol or a bleach solution between cuts to prevent disease spread.
    *   **Wound Protection:** After pruning, immediately apply a fungicidal paste to the cut ends. This can be prepared by mixing 100 g of **Copper oxychloride** 50% WP or **Carbendazim** 50% WP in 100 ml of linseed oil or lanolin.
    *   **Orchard Sanitation:** Remove and destroy all pruned material to reduce inoculum sources.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure balanced fertilization to improve tree vigor and resistance to diseases. Avoid water stress.

2.  **Chemical Control (Foliar Sprays):**
    *   Apply systemic or contact fungicides, especially during periods conducive to disease development (e.g., high humidity, post-monsoon).
    *   Spray with **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 1 g/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, use **Propiconazole** 25% EC at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   Another option is **Difenoconazole** 25% EC at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   For contact action, **Copper oxychloride** 50% WP at 2.5 g/L of water can be used, particularly as a protective spray.
    *   Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage and branches. Repeat sprays at 10-15 day intervals if the disease persists or conditions remain favorable.

**Regarding Tikka Disease:**
This is not known to affect Jamun. Tikka disease is a specific and well-known leaf spot disease primarily affecting groundnut (peanut) crops, caused by *Cercospora arachidicola* and *Cercosporidium personatum*.
