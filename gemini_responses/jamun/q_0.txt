As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Jamun (Syzygium cumini) in Haryana.

It is crucial to correctly identify the disease for effective management. Always follow label instructions for any chemical application and observe pre-harvest intervals (PHI).

Here's how to control the specified fungal diseases in Jamun:

**1. Alternaria (Leaf Spot, Fruit Rot)**
*   **Symptoms:** Irregular brown spots on leaves, often with concentric rings; can also affect fruits causing dark, sunken lesions.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   Prophylactic sprays during new flush and fruit development.
    *   Spray with:
        *   **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Chlorothalonil** at 2 g/L of water.
        *   **Propiconazole** at 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5 ml/L of water.

**2. Anthracnose (Leaf Spot, Twig Blight, Blossom Blight, Fruit Rot)**
*   **Symptoms:** Dark, sunken lesions on leaves, twigs, flowers, and fruits, often leading to dieback and fruit rot, especially in humid conditions.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   Prune and destroy infected twigs and branches.
    *   Spray with:
        *   **Carbendazim** at 1 g/L of water.
        *   **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Propiconazole** at 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Copper Oxychloride** at 3 g/L of water (especially as a pre-monsoon or post-harvest clean-up spray).

**3. Blast**
*   This is not known to affect Jamun.

**4. Blight (e.g., Dieback and Blight)**
*   **Symptoms:** Rapid browning and death of leaves, twigs, and branches, often starting from the tip and progressing downwards.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   Prune affected branches well below the visible symptoms and destroy them.
    *   Apply a paste of **Carbendazim** (10 g in 100 ml water) on the cut ends of pruned branches.
    *   Spray the canopy with:
        *   **Carbendazim** at 1 g/L of water.
        *   **Propiconazole** at 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Copper Oxychloride** at 3 g/L of water.

**5. Brown Spot**
*   **Symptoms:** Brown, often circular to irregular spots on leaves. This can be caused by various fungi, including *Alternaria* or *Cercospora* species.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   Control measures are similar to those for Alternaria leaf spot.
    *   Spray with:
        *   **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Carbendazim** at 1 g/L of water.
        *   **Chlorothalonil** at 2 g/L of water.

**6. Downy Mildew**
*   This is not known to affect Jamun.

**7. Powdery Mildew**
*   **Symptoms:** White, powdery patches on young leaves, shoots, and sometimes flowers and fruits. Infected parts may become distorted or stunted.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   Spray during the appearance of new flushes and flowering.
    *   Spray with:
        *   **Wettable Sulphur** at 2-3 g/L of water.
        *   **Propiconazole** at 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Tebuconazole** at 0.75 ml/L of water.
        *   **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5 ml/L of water.

**8. Grey Mildew**
*   This is not known to affect Jamun.

**General Management Practices for Fungal Diseases:**

*   **Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy fallen leaves, infected fruits, and pruned branches to reduce inoculum sources.
*   **Pruning:** Ensure proper canopy management through timely pruning to improve air circulation and light penetration, which reduces humidity within the canopy.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Maintain optimal plant health through balanced fertilization. Healthy plants are more resilient to diseases.
*   **Water Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation late in the day, which can prolong leaf wetness and favor fungal growth.
*   **Fungicide Rotation:** To prevent the development of fungicide resistance, rotate fungicides with different modes of action.
*   **Timely Application:** Apply fungicides preventively during susceptible stages (e.g., new flush, flowering, fruit set) or at the first sign of disease symptoms. Ensure thorough coverage of the plant.
