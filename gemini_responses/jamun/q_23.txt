As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified seed and soil treatment processes for Jamun cultivation in Haryana:

Jamun (Syzygium cumini) is a hardy fruit crop, but proper initial treatments ensure healthy establishment and long-term productivity.

### Seed Treatment for Jamun

Jamun seeds are recalcitrant (short viability) and are best sown fresh immediately after extraction. However, to protect against potential seed-borne and early soil-borne pathogens, a seed treatment is highly beneficial.

1.  **Fungal Protection (Biological):**
    *   Treat seeds with a bio-fungicide like **Trichoderma viride** at 5-10 grams per kg of seeds, or **Pseudomonas fluorescens** at 10 grams per kg of seeds.
    *   **Method:** Mix the chosen bio-agent with a small amount of water to form a slurry. Coat the Jamun seeds evenly with this slurry. Allow the seeds to dry in the shade for a few hours before sowing.

2.  **Fungal Protection (Chemical - if biological not available or severe disease history):**
    *   Treat seeds with **Carbendazim** at 2 grams per kg of seeds, or **Thiram** at 2.5 grams per kg of seeds.
    *   **Method:** Mix the chemical thoroughly with the seeds to ensure uniform coating. Wear gloves and a mask during application.

### Soil Treatment for Jamun

Soil treatment is crucial, especially during pit preparation for new plantations, to ensure a healthy start and manage soil-borne issues.

#### 1. Pit Preparation (for New Plantations):

*   **Pit Dimensions:** Dig pits of 1 meter x 1 meter x 1 meter size.
*   **Weathering:** Allow the dug-out pits to weather under sun exposure for 15-20 days. This helps in sterilizing the soil and exposing pests.
*   **Refilling Mixture:** Refill the pits with a well-mixed combination of:
    *   Topsoil (from the pit)
    *   20-30 kg of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or high-quality compost.
    *   1 kg of **Neem cake**. Neem cake acts as an organic amendment and has natural nematicidal and insecticidal properties.
*   **For Nematode Management (if soil testing indicates nematode presence or history of issues):**
    *   Incorporate bio-nematicides like **Purpureocillium lilacinum** (formerly *Paecilomyces lilacinus*) or **Bacillus subtilis** at 50-100 grams per pit, thoroughly mixed with the FYM and soil mixture before refilling. These bio-agents help suppress nematode populations.

#### 2. For Established Trees (Annual Maintenance/Problem Areas):

*   **Organic Matter Enrichment:** Annually apply 20-50 kg of well-decomposed FYM or compost per tree. Spread it evenly around the tree basin (within the drip line) and lightly incorporate it into the topsoil. This improves soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability.
*   **Bio-agent Application for Soil-borne Diseases:**
    *   To manage soil-borne fungal diseases (e.g., root rot), drench the soil around the root zone with a suspension of **Trichoderma viride** or **Pseudomonas fluorescens**.
    *   **Dosage:** Use 500 grams of the bio-agent per 100 litres of water per tree. Apply during the monsoon season or post-monsoon when soil moisture is adequate.
*   **Nematode Management (if symptoms appear on established trees):**
    *   Apply **Neem cake** at 1-2 kg per tree around the root zone and lightly incorporate it into the soil.
    *   Alternatively, drench the soil with a suspension of **Purpureocillium lilacinum** or **Bacillus subtilis** (500 grams per 100 litres of water per tree) around the root zone.

These practices will contribute significantly to the healthy growth and productivity of your Jamun orchard. Always ensure good drainage and proper irrigation for optimal results.
