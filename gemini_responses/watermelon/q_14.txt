Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist from Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling soil pests like termites and root-knot nematodes in watermelon cultivation in Haryana.

Effective management of soil pests requires an integrated approach, combining cultural practices with judicious use of CIBRC approved chemicals.

### Control of Termites in Watermelon

Termites can cause significant damage to watermelon plants by feeding on roots and the base of the stem, leading to wilting and plant death.

*   **Pre-planting/At-planting Application:**
    *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC**: Apply 2.0-2.5 litres per acre as a soil drench in the planting furrows or mix with irrigation water before transplanting/sowing. Ensure thorough mixing with the soil.
    *   **Fipronil 0.3% GR**: Apply 10-15 kg per acre by broadcasting and incorporating into the soil before planting, or apply in furrows at the time of sowing/transplanting.

### Control of Nematodes (Root-knot) in Watermelon

Root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.) are a major problem in watermelon, causing characteristic galls on roots, leading to stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, reduced yield, and increased susceptibility to other diseases.

**1. Cultural and Agronomic Practices (Highly Recommended for Sustainable Management):**

*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice rotation with non-host crops such as cereals (wheat, maize, sorghum) for at least 2-3 years. Avoid continuous cultivation of susceptible crops like other cucurbits, brinjal, tomato, or bhindi.
*   **Summer Ploughing:** Deep ploughing during the hot summer months (May-June) exposes nematode eggs and larvae to direct sunlight, desiccating and killing them. Repeat ploughing 2-3 times.
*   **Solarization:** Cover the prepared field with transparent polyethylene sheets (100-micron thickness) for 4-6 weeks during peak summer. This raises soil temperature to lethal levels for nematodes.
*   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporate well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost (20-30 tonnes per acre) into the soil. This improves soil health and promotes beneficial microorganisms that can suppress nematode populations.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** If available and suitable for your region, consider using watermelon varieties known to have resistance or tolerance to root-knot nematodes.
*   **Nursery Management:** Ensure that seedlings are raised in nematode-free soil or sterilized media to prevent early infestation.

**2. Chemical Control (As a Supplement to Cultural Practices):**

*   **Pre-planting/At-planting Application:**
    *   **Carbofuran 3% G**: Apply 10-15 kg per acre in furrows at the time of sowing or transplanting, ensuring it is mixed well with the soil.
    *   **Phorate 10% G**: Apply 4-6 kg per acre in furrows at the time of sowing or transplanting, ensuring it is mixed well with the soil. (Note: Phorate is a highly toxic chemical and should be handled with extreme caution and protective gear).
    *   **Fluensulfone 2% GR**: Apply 20-30 kg per acre in furrows at the time of sowing or transplanting, ensuring it is mixed well with the soil. This is a newer and effective nematicide.
    *   **Oxamyl 24% SL**: Apply 2.0-2.5 litres per acre as a soil drench around the root zone of plants or through drip irrigation system after transplanting.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label carefully, including dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and pest severity.
*   An Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods, is the most sustainable and effective strategy for long-term pest control.
