As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned conditions in Watermelon in Haryana:

**1. Grasshopper:**
Grasshoppers are polyphagous pests that can cause significant damage to watermelon by feeding on leaves and young shoots, especially during early growth stages.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Maintain field sanitation by removing weeds and crop residues that can serve as breeding grounds and shelter for grasshoppers.
    *   Deep plowing after harvest can expose grasshopper eggs to predators and adverse weather conditions, reducing future populations.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   For severe infestations, chemical control may be necessary. Apply insecticides during the early morning or late evening when grasshoppers are less active.
    *   **Malathion 50% EC**: Apply at 1.25 L per acre in 200-400 L of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC**: Apply at 100-125 ml per acre in 200-400 L of water.
    *   **Cypermethrin 25% EC**: Apply at 200-250 ml per acre in 200-400 L of water.

**2. Painted bug:**
This is not known to affect Watermelon. Painted bug (Bagrada hilaris) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops like mustard, cabbage, and cauliflower.

**3. Red cotton bug:**
This is not known to affect Watermelon. Red cotton bug (Dysdercus cingulatus) is primarily a pest of cotton and other malvaceous plants, feeding on developing seeds.

**4. Black ants:**
This is not known to affect Watermelon as a direct pest causing damage to the plant or fruit. While ants may be present in fields, they are generally not considered a primary pest of watermelon. If they are observed protecting other sap-sucking pests (like aphids or mealybugs) for their honeydew, the primary focus should be on controlling those sap-sucking pests, which will indirectly reduce ant presence.
