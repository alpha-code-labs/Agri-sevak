Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling weeds in watermelon cultivation in Haryana. Effective weed management is crucial for maximizing yield and quality.

We will address the weeds you've mentioned, categorizing them for better management strategies.

### General Weed Management Principles for Watermelon

A combination of cultural, mechanical, and chemical methods provides the most effective weed control.

1.  **Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
    *   **Field Preparation:** Thorough ploughing and harrowing before sowing help expose weed seeds to the sun, reducing their viability.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate watermelon with non-cucurbit crops to break weed cycles.
    *   **Mulching:** Use plastic mulch (black or silver-black) for excellent weed suppression, especially for weeds emerging between rows. It also conserves moisture and helps in early crop establishment.
    *   **Manual Weeding/Hoeing:** Essential, particularly in the early stages of crop growth (first 30-45 days) when the crop is most vulnerable to weed competition. Two to three manual weedings are often required.
    *   **Stale Seedbed Technique:** Prepare the field, allow weeds to germinate, and then spray a non-selective herbicide like **Glyphosate** (41% SL at 1.0-1.5 L/acre) before sowing/transplanting watermelon. This reduces the initial weed load.

2.  **Chemical Control (Herbicides):**

    **A. Pre-emergence Herbicides (Applied before crop and weed emergence):**
    These are effective against a broad spectrum of weeds, including broadleaf and narrowleaf weeds (grasses like Bathu, Congress grass, and other annual grasses). Apply within 3 days of sowing or transplanting watermelon, ensuring adequate soil moisture.

    *   **Pendimethalin** (30% EC): Apply at 1.0-1.5 kg a.i./acre (equivalent to 3.3-5.0 L of 30% EC formulation per acre) in 200-300 litres of water. This provides good control of most annual broadleaf and narrowleaf weeds.
    *   **Fluchloralin** (45% EC): Apply at 0.9-1.2 kg a.i./acre (equivalent to 2.0-2.7 L of 45% EC formulation per acre) in 200-300 litres of water. Incorporate into the soil immediately after application.

    **B. Post-emergence Herbicides (Applied after weed emergence):**
    These are generally more specific. For watermelon, options are primarily for narrowleaf weeds (grasses).

    *   **For Narrowleaf Weeds (Grasses):**
        If grass weeds emerge after crop establishment, you can use grass-specific herbicides that are safe for broadleaf crops like watermelon. Apply when grasses are at the 2-4 leaf stage for best results.
        *   **Quizalofop-ethyl** (5% EC): Apply at 50-100 g a.i./acre (equivalent to 1.0-2.0 L of 5% EC formulation per acre) in 200-300 litres of water.
        *   **Fenoxaprop-p-ethyl** (9% EC): Apply at 50-60 g a.i./acre (equivalent to 0.55-0.67 L of 9% EC formulation per acre) in 200-300 litres of water.

    *   **For Broadleaf Weeds (Bathu, Congress grass, other broadleaf weeds):**
        Post-emergence chemical control for broadleaf weeds in watermelon is very challenging due to the limited availability of selective herbicides that do not harm the crop. **Manual weeding remains the most effective and safest method for post-emergence broadleaf weed control in watermelon.**

### Specific Weed Management

*   **Amarbail (Cuscuta spp. - Dodder):**
    Amarbail is a parasitic weed and is extremely difficult to control once it has attached to the watermelon plant. Prevention is key.
    *   **Prevention:**
        *   Use certified, clean seeds free from Amarbail seeds.
        *   Avoid using farmyard manure or compost contaminated with Amarbail seeds.
        *   Remove any Amarbail plants from field borders or nearby host plants before they produce seeds.
        *   If small patches are observed, immediately remove them manually and destroy them by burning, ensuring no contact with the soil.
    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   **Pre-emergence application of Pendimethalin** can offer some suppression of Amarbail germination.
        *   Once Amarbail has attached to the watermelon, selective chemical control is virtually impossible without harming the crop. Spot application of **Glyphosate** (non-selective) can be done on isolated patches *before* it spreads to the crop, using a shielded sprayer to prevent contact with watermelon plants. This is a last resort and requires extreme caution.

*   **Orobanche (Broomrape):**
    This is not known to affect Watermelon. Orobanche species are primarily parasitic on solanaceous crops (like tomato, brinjal, potato), legumes, and some oilseed crops.

*   **Phalaris minor (Little seed canary grass):**
    This is not known to affect Watermelon. Phalaris minor is a major weed of wheat and other winter cereals, typically thriving in cooler temperatures. It is not a significant weed in watermelon cultivation, which is grown in warmer seasons.

### Important Considerations:

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the herbicide label carefully.
*   Use the correct dosage and application method.
*   Ensure proper calibration of spray equipment.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions.

By adopting an integrated approach, you can effectively manage weeds and ensure a healthy and productive watermelon crop.
