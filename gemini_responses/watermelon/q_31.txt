As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend the following scientifically verified practices to manage physical damage in watermelon cultivation in Haryana:

**1. Fruit Bursting (Cracking)**
This condition is primarily caused by sudden fluctuations in soil moisture (e.g., a dry spell followed by heavy irrigation or rainfall), rapid fruit growth, and sometimes nutrient imbalances, particularly calcium and boron deficiencies.

*   **Irrigation Management:** Maintain consistent and uniform soil moisture throughout the growing season, especially during fruit development. Avoid extremes of drought followed by excessive watering. Drip irrigation is highly recommended for precise water management.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure adequate supply of calcium and boron, which are crucial for cell wall integrity and fruit skin elasticity.
    *   **Foliar spray:** Apply **Calcium nitrate** at 5-7 g/L of water, or **Boric acid** at 1-1.5 g/L of water, during fruit development stages (e.g., 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals).
    *   **Soil application:** Apply **Calcium nitrate** at 10-15 kg/acre, or **Borax** at 4-6 kg/acre, as a basal dose or through fertigation, based on soil test recommendations.
*   **Variety Selection:** Choose watermelon varieties known for their crack resistance.
*   **Mulching:** Use organic mulches (e.g., straw) or plastic mulches to help maintain consistent soil moisture and temperature, reducing fluctuations that lead to cracking.
*   **Shade Nets:** In areas with very high temperatures, using shade nets (e.g., 30-35% shade) can help moderate temperature extremes around the fruit, reducing stress.

**2. Leaf Burning/Melting (Sunscald, Heat Stress)**
This damage occurs due to intense solar radiation, high temperatures, and often exacerbated by water stress. "Melting" indicates severe tissue collapse due to extreme heat.

*   **Water Management:** Ensure adequate and timely irrigation, especially during hot periods, to prevent water stress and keep plants turgid. Water early in the morning to allow leaves to dry before peak heat.
*   **Shade Management:**
    *   **Shade Nets:** Install 30-35% shade nets over the crop during peak summer months (April-June) to reduce direct sun exposure and ambient temperature.
    *   **Optimal Plant Spacing:** Maintain appropriate plant spacing to allow for some self-shading of leaves and fruits, without overcrowding.
*   **Mulching:** Apply mulches to keep the soil cooler, reduce soil temperature fluctuations, and conserve moisture.
*   **Foliar Sprays for Stress Tolerance:**
    *   Apply **Potassium nitrate** at 5-7 g/L of water to enhance heat stress tolerance and improve water use efficiency.
    *   Apply **Kaolin clay** (agricultural grade) at 20-40 g/L of water as a reflective coating to reduce leaf temperature and sunscald. Ensure good coverage.
    *   Consider foliar application of amino acid-based formulations (as per manufacturer's recommendations) to help plants recover from stress.

**3. Hardness in Fruit**
If "hardness" refers to an undesirable tough texture in mature fruit, it is typically related to harvesting practices, water management, or nutrient balance, rather than direct physical damage.

*   **Optimal Harvesting Maturity:** Harvest watermelons at their physiological maturity. Over-mature fruits tend to become excessively hard, mealy, or develop an undesirable texture. Indicators include a dull thumping sound, drying of the tendril closest to the fruit, and a distinct yellow ground spot.
*   **Consistent Irrigation:** Maintain consistent soil moisture throughout the fruit development stage. Water stress can lead to tougher rind and flesh.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure adequate supply of Potassium, which plays a vital role in fruit quality, sweetness, and texture.
    *   **Soil application/Fertigation:** Apply **Potassium sulphate** or **Potassium chloride** as per soil test recommendations, typically 50-70 kg K2O/acre during fruit development and maturation stages.
*   **Variety Selection:** Choose watermelon varieties known for desirable flesh texture and sweetness suitable for your market.
