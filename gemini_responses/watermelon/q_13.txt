As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fruit flies and addressing Ber fly in Watermelon cultivation in Haryana.

### Control of Fruit Fly in Watermelon

Fruit flies, primarily the Melon Fruit Fly (*Bactrocera cucurbitae*), are a significant pest of watermelon in Haryana, causing considerable damage by laying eggs in young fruits, leading to rotting and premature fruit drop. An integrated pest management (IPM) approach is crucial for effective control.

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**

*   **Field Sanitation:** Regularly collect and destroy all infested, fallen, or damaged fruits by burying them deep (at least 60 cm) or burning them. This prevents the completion of the fruit fly life cycle.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** After harvest, deep ploughing exposes pupae in the soil to predators and harsh environmental conditions, reducing the next generation's population.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid continuous cultivation of cucurbit crops in the same field to break the pest cycle.
*   **Pheromone Traps:** Install specific cue-lure based pheromone traps at a density of 10-12 traps per acre. These traps attract and kill male fruit flies, helping to monitor the population and reduce mating. Replace lures every 2-3 weeks.
*   **Poison Bait Sprays:** Prepare bait by mixing an insecticide with a food attractant. This can be applied as spot sprays on leaves (not directly on fruits) in the field.
    *   Mix **Malathion** 50% EC at 1 ml/L of water with jaggery (gur) at 10 g/L of water or protein hydrolysate at 5 g/L of water. Apply 50-100 ml of this bait solution per 10 m² area on leaves, preferably in the morning. Repeat at weekly intervals if infestation is high.

**2. Chemical Control (Use CIBRC approved technical chemicals only):**

When fruit fly incidence is high and other methods are insufficient, judicious use of insecticides may be necessary. Always observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) and rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

*   **Malathion** 50% EC: 1.5-2.0 ml/L of water.
*   **Dimethoate** 30% EC: 1.0-1.5 ml/L of water.
*   **Fipronil** 5% SC: 1.0-1.5 ml/L of water.
*   **Spinosad** 45% SC: 0.25-0.3 ml/L of water (effective and relatively safer, but generally more expensive).
*   **Deltamethrin** 2.8% EC: 0.5 ml/L of water.

**Important Considerations for Chemical Application:**

*   Spray during early morning or late evening to minimize impact on pollinators and maximize efficacy.
*   Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.
*   Always read and follow the label instructions for dosage, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval.

### Control of Ber Fly in Watermelon

This is not known to affect Watermelon.

Ber fly (*Carpomyia vesuviana*) is a host-specific pest primarily affecting Ber (*Ziziphus mauritiana*) fruits and is not known to infest watermelon.
