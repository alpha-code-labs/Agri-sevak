Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I understand your concern regarding the potential harmful effects of weedicides/herbicides on watermelon crops. While herbicides are valuable tools for weed management, improper use can lead to significant crop damage (phytotoxicity). The key to reducing these harmful effects lies in prevention and precise application.

Here are scientifically verified strategies to minimize herbicide harm in watermelon:

1.  **Integrated Weed Management (IWM):**
    *   Prioritize non-chemical methods such as hand weeding, mechanical cultivation, mulching (e.g., with straw or plastic film), and proper crop rotation. This reduces the overall reliance on herbicides, thereby lowering the risk of phytotoxicity.

2.  **Correct Herbicide Selection:**
    *   **Pre-emergence Herbicides:** Choose herbicides specifically registered and recommended for watermelon in Haryana. These are applied to the soil before the emergence of weeds and the crop. Examples include:
        *   **Pendimethalin** (e.g., 1.0-1.5 kg active ingredient per acre)
        *   **Oxyfluorfen** (e.g., 0.15-0.25 kg active ingredient per acre)
        *   Ensure proper soil moisture for their activation.
    *   **Post-emergence Herbicides:** Watermelon is highly sensitive to most post-emergence herbicides. If post-emergence application is necessary, use only highly selective herbicides or apply non-selective ones (e.g., **Paraquat**, **Glufosinate-ammonium**, **Glyphosate**) as **shielded sprays**. This means using a protective shield to prevent any contact of the spray solution with watermelon foliage, stems, or roots.

3.  **Accurate Dosage and Calibration:**
    *   **Strict Adherence to Dosage:** Always follow the recommended dosage (e.g., kg/acre or ml/L) provided by the manufacturer and HAU. Overdosing is a primary cause of phytotoxicity.
    *   **Equipment Calibration:** Regularly calibrate your spray equipment (knapsack sprayer, tractor-mounted sprayer) to ensure uniform and accurate delivery of the herbicide solution. Incorrect calibration can lead to under-dosing (ineffective) or over-dosing (phytotoxic).

4.  **Proper Application Technique:**
    *   **Uniform Coverage:** Ensure even spray distribution across the target area.
    *   **Nozzle Selection:** Use appropriate nozzles (e.g., flat fan nozzles for broadcast application) that produce droplets suitable for the herbicide and target.
    *   **Spray Pressure:** Maintain recommended spray pressure. Too high pressure can create fine mists prone to drift, while too low pressure can result in poor coverage.
    *   **Avoid Drift:** Do not spray during windy conditions (wind speed exceeding 10 km/h). Use drift-reducing nozzles or adjuvants if necessary, especially when applying near sensitive crops.

5.  **Timely Application:**
    *   **Pre-emergence:** Apply within 1-3 days after sowing or transplanting, before weed emergence.
    *   **Post-emergence:** If using shielded post-emergence herbicides, apply when weeds are small (2-4 leaf stage) and actively growing, as they are most susceptible. This allows for lower doses and reduces the period of crop exposure. Avoid spraying during critical flowering or fruiting stages unless specifically recommended and safe.

6.  **Environmental Considerations:**
    *   **Temperature:** Avoid spraying during extreme temperatures (very hot >35°C or very cold <10°C) as this can increase crop stress and herbicide uptake, leading to phytotoxicity.
    *   **Humidity:** High humidity can increase herbicide absorption by plants.
    *   **Rainfall:** Check the rain-free period required after application to ensure the herbicide is absorbed and not washed off, which could lead to reduced efficacy and potential runoff.

7.  **Soil and Water Quality:**
    *   **Soil Type:** Be aware that herbicide persistence and availability can vary with soil type (e.g., sandy soils may have higher leaching potential, clay soils higher adsorption). Adjust herbicide choice or dosage if recommended for specific soil types.
    *   **Water pH:** The pH of the spray water can affect the stability and efficacy of some herbicides. Adjust water pH if necessary, as per herbicide label recommendations.

8.  **Equipment Maintenance and Cleaning:**
    *   Thoroughly clean spray tanks, nozzles, and hoses immediately after each use, especially when switching between different crops or herbicides. Residues from previous applications (e.g., 2,4-D used in cereals) can be highly phytotoxic to watermelon.

9.  **Crop Health and Stress:**
    *   Avoid applying herbicides to watermelon plants that are already stressed due to drought, waterlogging, nutrient deficiency, disease, or insect damage. Stressed plants are more susceptible to herbicide injury. Ensure the crop is healthy and vigorous before application.

10. **Use of Adjuvants/Safeners:**
    *   Only use adjuvants (e.g., surfactants, crop oils) if specifically recommended on the herbicide label for watermelon. Incorrect adjuvants or concentrations can increase phytotoxicity.
    *   Currently, there are no widely available and CIBRC-approved chemical safeners specifically for watermelon against common herbicides used in its cultivation. The primary focus remains on correct herbicide selection and application.

11. **Post-Application Monitoring and Mitigation:**
    *   **Irrigation:** If mild herbicide injury is observed, light irrigation can sometimes help dilute the herbicide in the soil and promote plant recovery.
    *   **Nutrient Support:** Provide adequate balanced nutrition to help the plant recover from stress. Foliar application of micronutrients or amino acids might aid recovery, but this is generally for mild stress, not severe damage.

By strictly adhering to these scientific principles and best practices, farmers can significantly reduce the risk of herbicide-induced harm to their watermelon crops, ensuring healthy growth and optimal yields. Always consult the latest recommendations from Haryana Agricultural University for specific product choices and dosages relevant to your region.
