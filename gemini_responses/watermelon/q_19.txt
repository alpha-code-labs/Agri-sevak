Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I understand the critical importance of balanced nutrition for optimal watermelon yield and quality in Haryana. Addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium) requires a scientific approach, primarily guided by soil testing.

**General Recommendation:**
Before applying any fertilizers, it is **highly recommended to conduct a soil test** from a reputable laboratory. This will provide precise information on the nutrient status of your specific field and allow for tailored recommendations, preventing over-application or under-application. Visual symptoms often appear when the deficiency is already severe, leading to yield losses.

Here's how to address deficiencies of Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K) in watermelon:

### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

Nitrogen is crucial for vegetative growth, leaf development, and overall plant vigor.

*   **Symptoms:** Pale green to yellowing of older leaves (chlorosis), stunted plant growth, reduced vine length, and smaller, fewer fruits.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Soil Application (Top-dressing):**
        *   For general deficiency, apply 20-30 kg N per acre in split doses during the growing season.
        *   **Urea** (46% N): Apply 45-65 kg/acre in 2-3 split doses. The first split can be given 20-25 days after sowing/transplanting, and subsequent splits at 15-20 day intervals, avoiding application during flowering to prevent excessive vegetative growth at the expense of fruit set.
        *   **Calcium Ammonium Nitrate (CAN)** (25% N): Apply 80-120 kg/acre in 2-3 split doses.
    *   **Foliar Application (for quick, temporary relief):**
        *   In cases of acute deficiency, a foliar spray can provide a quick boost.
        *   Spray 0.5-1% solution of **Urea** (5-10 g of Urea per liter of water) at weekly intervals until symptoms subside. Ensure complete leaf coverage.

### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

Phosphorus is vital for root development, flowering, fruit set, and energy transfer within the plant.

*   **Symptoms:** Dark green or purplish discoloration of older leaves, stunted growth, poor root development, delayed maturity, and reduced fruit size and quality.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Soil Application (Basal):** Phosphorus is less mobile in the soil, so it's best applied as a basal dose and incorporated into the soil before planting or at the time of planting.
        *   For general deficiency, apply 20-30 kg P2O5 per acre.
        *   **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5): Apply 45-65 kg/acre as a basal dose.
        *   **Single Superphosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5): Apply 125-190 kg/acre as a basal dose. SSP also provides sulfur and calcium, which are beneficial.
        *   **Monoammonium Phosphate (MAP)** (11% N, 52% P2O5): Can be used, especially in drip irrigation systems, at appropriate rates based on P2O5 requirement.

### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency

Potassium (Potash) is essential for fruit development, sugar accumulation, water regulation, disease resistance, and overall fruit quality (size, sweetness, shelf life).

*   **Symptoms:** Yellowing and browning (scorching or necrosis) of leaf margins, especially on older leaves; weak stems; poor fruit development, size, and quality; reduced disease resistance.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Soil Application (Basal or Split Doses):**
        *   For general deficiency, apply 20-30 kg K2O per acre.
        *   **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** (60% K2O / Potassium Chloride): Apply 35-50 kg/acre. This can be applied as a basal dose or in 1-2 split doses, with the first dose at planting and the second during fruit development.
        *   **Sulphate of Potash (SOP)** (50% K2O / Potassium Sulphate): Apply 40-60 kg/acre. This is preferred in saline soils or where sulfur is also deficient.
    *   **Foliar Application (for quick, temporary relief):**
        *   For acute deficiency, a foliar spray can be beneficial.
        *   Spray 0.5-1% solution of **Potassium Nitrate** (5-10 g of Potassium Nitrate per liter of water) at weekly intervals during fruit development.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Integrated Nutrient Management:** Always combine chemical fertilizers with organic manures (Farm Yard Manure, compost) to improve soil health and nutrient availability.
*   **Water Management:** Proper irrigation is crucial for nutrient uptake. Ensure adequate soil moisture, especially after fertilizer application.
*   **Timing:** Apply fertilizers at the correct growth stages to maximize their effectiveness.
*   **Local Expertise:** For precise recommendations tailored to your specific field conditions and soil test results, please consult with the agricultural extension specialists at HAU or your local Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK).
