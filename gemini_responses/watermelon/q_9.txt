Mites, including Red Spider Mite (Tetranychus urticae) and various Rust Mites (Eriophyidae family), are significant pests of watermelon in Haryana, especially during hot and dry periods. Effective control requires an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach.

### Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Mites in Watermelon

**1. Cultural Control:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy crop residues and weeds, which can act as alternate hosts for mites.
*   **Proper Irrigation:** Ensure adequate and timely irrigation. Water-stressed plants are more susceptible to mite infestations. Overhead irrigation can sometimes help dislodge mites, but be mindful of fungal disease risks.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, as it can lead to lush, soft growth that is more attractive to mites.
*   **Mulching:** Use mulches to conserve soil moisture and reduce dust, as dusty conditions favor mite buildup.

**2. Biological Control:**
*   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Encourage the presence of natural predators such as predatory mites (e.g., Amblyseius spp.), ladybird beetles, lacewings, and minute pirate bugs. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.
*   **Biopesticides:** Neem-based formulations (e.g., Azadirachtin 1500 ppm or 3000 ppm) can have some repellent and anti-feedant effects, especially in early stages of infestation. Apply at 5 ml/L of water.

**3. Chemical Control (Acaricides):**
When mite populations reach economic threshold levels, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where mites primarily reside.

Here are some CIBRC-approved acaricides for watermelon:

*   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** Apply at 125 ml per acre in 200-400 litres of water. Effective against all life stages of spider mites.
*   **Fenpyroximate 5% SC:** Apply at 250-300 ml per acre in 200-400 litres of water. Provides quick knockdown and residual control.
*   **Propargite 57% EC:** Apply at 1-1.5 litres per acre in 200-400 litres of water. Effective against motile stages of mites.
*   **Abamectin 1.9% EC:** Apply at 150-200 ml per acre in 200-400 litres of water. Has translaminar action, effective against mites and leaf miners.
*   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP:** Apply at 2-2.5 kg per acre in 200-400 litres of water. Effective against rust mites and also provides some control of spider mites and powdery mildew.
*   **Etoxazole 10% SC:** Apply at 100-125 ml per acre in 200-400 litres of water. Acts as a mite growth regulator, primarily ovicidal and larvicidal.

**Important Considerations for Chemical Application:**
*   **Rotation:** Never use the same chemical repeatedly. Rotate between different chemical groups (modes of action) to prevent resistance development.
*   **Timing:** Apply acaricides during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize phytotoxicity and improve efficacy.
*   **Coverage:** Mites are primarily found on the undersides of leaves. Ensure thorough spray coverage of the entire plant, especially the lower leaf surfaces.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always observe the specified Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) for each chemical to ensure the produce is safe for consumption.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and application. Follow all label instructions carefully.

For specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions, it is always advisable to consult with the HAU extension services or a local agricultural expert.
