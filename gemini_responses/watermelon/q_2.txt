As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm the following regarding rust diseases in Watermelon:

Rust diseases, including Black Rust, Brown Rust, Yellow Rust, White Rust, and Red Rust, are generally **not known to be significant diseases of Watermelon (Citrullus lanatus)**.

*   **Black Rust (Stem Rust), Brown Rust (Leaf Rust), and Yellow Rust (Stripe Rust)** are primarily diseases of cereal crops like wheat, barley, and oats, caused by specific *Puccinia* species. They do not affect watermelon.
*   **White Rust** is caused by Oomycetes of the genus *Albugo* (e.g., *Albugo candida*), which primarily affect cruciferous crops (like mustard, radish, cabbage) and some other plant families. This is not known to affect Watermelon.
*   **Red Rust** is a less specific term. If it refers to true rust fungi, then specific rust pathogens causing "Red Rust" on watermelon are not documented. If it refers to algal red rust (*Cephaleuros virescens*), that also does not affect watermelon.

Therefore, there are no specific control measures recommended for these rust diseases in watermelon because:

*   **This is not known to affect Watermelon.**

Watermelon is susceptible to other fungal and Oomycete diseases such as Downy Mildew, Powdery Mildew, Anthracnose, Gummy Stem Blight, and Fusarium Wilt, for which specific management strategies are available. If you are observing symptoms that resemble rust on your watermelon plants, it is highly recommended to get a proper diagnosis, as it might be another disease with similar-looking symptoms or a non-pathogenic issue. You can bring a sample to the plant pathology department at HAU, Hisar, for accurate identification.
