Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I am pleased to provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Watermelon in Haryana. Effective management relies on an integrated approach combining cultural practices with judicious use of CIBRC-approved fungicides.

Here's a breakdown for each condition:

### General Cultural Practices for Fungal Disease Management in Watermelon:
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Whenever possible, choose watermelon varieties known to have resistance or tolerance to common fungal diseases in your area.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice a 2-3 year crop rotation with non-cucurbit crops to break disease cycles and reduce pathogen inoculum in the soil.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest. Control weeds, as they can harbor pathogens.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to improve air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce humidity and fungal growth.
*   **Irrigation Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day, as wet foliage for extended periods promotes fungal development. Drip irrigation is preferred.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced fertilization. Excessive nitrogen can lead to lush, susceptible growth.
*   **Certified Seeds:** Use certified disease-free seeds to prevent the introduction of seed-borne pathogens.

### Specific Disease Control Measures:

#### 1. Alternaria Leaf Spot/Blight (*Alternaria cucumerina*)
This disease causes small, circular, brown spots with concentric rings, often surrounded by a yellow halo, primarily on older leaves.
*   **Cultural Practices:** Implement the general practices mentioned above.
*   **Chemical Control (Apply preventively or at first symptom):**
    *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP: 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5-3 g/L water)
    *   **Chlorothalonil** 75% WP: 2 kg/acre (or 2-2.5 g/L water)
    *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC: 200 ml/acre (or 0.5-1 ml/L water)
    *   **Difenoconazole** 25% EC: 100-150 ml/acre (or 0.5 ml/L water)

#### 2. Anthracnose (*Colletotrichum orbiculare*)
Anthracnose causes dark, sunken lesions on leaves, stems, and fruits. Leaf spots are typically dark brown to black, often angular.
*   **Cultural Practices:** Use resistant varieties, practice crop rotation, and ensure good field sanitation.
*   **Chemical Control (Apply preventively or at first symptom):**
    *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP: 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5-3 g/L water)
    *   **Chlorothalonil** 75% WP: 2 kg/acre (or 2-2.5 g/L water)
    *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: 250-300 g/acre (or 0.5 g/L water)
    *   **Thiophanate Methyl** 70% WP: 250-300 g/acre (or 0.5 g/L water)
    *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC: 200 ml/acre (or 0.5-1 ml/L water)

#### 3. Blast
This is not known to affect Watermelon.

#### 4. Blight (e.g., Gummy Stem Blight - *Didymella bryoniae*)
Blights can affect leaves, stems, and fruits, causing lesions, cankers, and often a characteristic gummy exudate on stems.
*   **Cultural Practices:** Use resistant varieties, practice crop rotation, and remove infected plant parts.
*   **Chemical Control (Apply preventively or at first symptom):**
    *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP: 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5-3 g/L water)
    *   **Chlorothalonil** 75% WP: 2 kg/acre (or 2-2.5 g/L water)
    *   **Thiophanate Methyl** 70% WP: 250-300 g/acre (or 0.5 g/L water)
    *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC: 200 ml/acre (or 0.5-1 ml/L water)
    *   **Pyraclostrobin** 20% WG: 150-200 g/acre (or 0.5-0.75 g/L water)

#### 5. Brown Spot
Brown spot can be a general term for various leaf spot diseases, often caused by fungi like *Alternaria* or *Cercospora*. Control measures are similar to those for Alternaria or Anthracnose.
*   **Cultural Practices:** Implement general cultural practices.
*   **Chemical Control (Apply preventively or at first symptom):**
    *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP: 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5-3 g/L water)
    *   **Chlorothalonil** 75% WP: 2 kg/acre (or 2-2.5 g/L water)
    *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC: 200 ml/acre (or 0.5-1 ml/L water)

#### 6. Downy Mildew (*Pseudoperonospora cubensis*)
Downy mildew appears as angular, yellowish spots on the upper leaf surface, corresponding to purplish-grey, fuzzy growth on the lower leaf surface.
*   **Cultural Practices:** Use resistant varieties, ensure good air circulation, and avoid overhead irrigation.
*   **Chemical Control (Apply preventively or at first symptom, especially during humid conditions):**
    *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP: 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5-3 g/L water) - *Preventive*
    *   **Propamocarb Hydrochloride** 72.2% SL: 2-2.5 L/acre (or 2-2.5 ml/L water)
    *   **Dimethomorph** 50% WP: 200-250 g/acre (or 0.5 g/L water)
    *   **Cymoxanil 8% + Mancozeb 64% WP**: 1.5-2 kg/acre (or 2-2.5 g/L water)
    *   **Fenamidone 10% + Mancozeb 50% WG**: 1.5-2 kg/acre (or 2-2.5 g/L water)
    *   **Fluopicolide 6.25% + Propamocarb Hydrochloride 62.5% SC**: 1.5-2 L/acre (or 2-2.5 ml/L water)

#### 7. Powdery Mildew (*Podosphaera xanthii* or *Erysiphe cichoracearum*)
Powdery mildew is characterized by white, powdery patches on the upper and lower surfaces of leaves and stems.
*   **Cultural Practices:** Use resistant varieties, ensure good air circulation, and avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization.
*   **Chemical Control (Apply at first sign of disease):**
    *   **Sulphur** 80% WP: 2-2.5 kg/acre (or 2-3 g/L water) - *Effective for early stages and prevention*
    *   **Myclobutanil** 10% WP: 120-150 g/acre (or 0.5 g/L water)
    *   **Penconazole** 10% EC: 100-150 ml/acre (or 0.5 ml/L water)
    *   **Hexaconazole** 5% EC: 200-300 ml/acre (or 1 ml/L water)
    *   **Difenoconazole** 25% EC: 100-150 ml/acre (or 0.5 ml/L water)

### Important Considerations for Chemical Application:
*   **Read the Label:** Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the fungicide product label for dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   **Fungicide Rotation:** To prevent the development of fungicide resistance, rotate fungicides with different modes of action (FRAC codes). Do not use the same fungicide or fungicides from the same FRAC group repeatedly.
*   **Timing:** Apply fungicides preventively, especially if conditions are favorable for disease development, or at the very first sign of symptoms for best efficacy.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough spray coverage of all plant parts, including the undersides of leaves.
*   **Water Volume:** Use adequate water volume to ensure good coverage. Typically, 200-400 liters of water per acre for foliar sprays.

For any specific concerns or severe outbreaks, please consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for tailored advice.
