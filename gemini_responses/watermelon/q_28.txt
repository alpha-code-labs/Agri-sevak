As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the critical importance of protecting watermelon crops from environmental stresses, which are becoming more frequent and intense in our region. Watermelon is a warm-season crop, but extreme fluctuations can severely impact its growth, yield, and quality.

Here's scientifically verified advice to protect your watermelon crop from extreme cold, frost, heat (Loo), and intense sunlight:

### Protection from Extreme Cold and Frost

Watermelon plants are highly susceptible to cold temperatures and frost, which can cause significant damage or even plant death, especially in young stages.

*   **Site Selection and Planting Time:**
    *   Ensure planting occurs only after the danger of frost has completely passed. In Haryana, this typically means planting from mid-February to early March, depending on the specific microclimate of your area.
    *   Choose well-drained fields that are not prone to cold air pockets.
*   **Row Covers/Low Tunnels:**
    *   For early plantings or during unexpected cold snaps, cover young watermelon plants with transparent plastic sheets or non-woven fabric (agro-textile). This creates a mini-greenhouse effect, trapping heat.
    *   Ensure to ventilate these tunnels during sunny days to prevent excessive heat buildup, which can harm the plants.
*   **Mulching:**
    *   Apply a thick layer (5-10 cm) of organic mulch such as wheat straw, paddy straw, or sugarcane trash around the base of the plants. This insulates the soil, retaining warmth and protecting the root zone from cold.
    *   Black plastic mulch can also be used to absorb solar radiation during the day and radiate heat at night, but needs to be managed carefully to avoid overheating later in the season.
*   **Irrigation:**
    *   A light irrigation before a predicted frost can be beneficial. Water has a higher specific heat capacity than air, and the latent heat released as water freezes can slightly raise the ambient temperature around the plants, offering some protection. Ensure the soil is moist, not waterlogged.
*   **Windbreaks:**
    *   Planting taller crops (e.g., mustard, wheat as border crops) or installing temporary physical barriers can reduce the chilling effect of cold winds.

### Protection from Heat (Loo) and Intense Sunlight

While watermelon thrives in warm conditions, extreme heat (above 40-42°C), hot dry winds (Loo), and intense sunlight can lead to wilting, flower drop, poor fruit set, sunscald on fruits, and reduced fruit quality.

*   **Adequate and Timely Irrigation:**
    *   This is the most crucial factor. Watermelon has high water requirements, especially during flowering and fruit development.
    *   Use drip irrigation for efficient water delivery directly to the root zone, minimizing evaporation and ensuring consistent moisture.
    *   Maintain consistent soil moisture. Avoid water stress, which significantly exacerbates heat damage.
*   **Mulching:**
    *   Organic mulches (straw, paddy straw) are highly effective in keeping soil temperatures down, reducing evaporation, and protecting roots from extreme heat.
    *   If using black plastic mulch, consider covering it with a layer of straw during peak heat periods to prevent excessive soil heating.
*   **Shade Nets:**
    *   For young plants or during periods of extreme heat (temperatures consistently above 40°C), installing 30-50% shade nets can significantly reduce leaf temperature, prevent sunscald on fruits, and improve fruit set.
*   **Canopy Management:**
    *   Ensure healthy foliage development to provide natural shade for developing fruits, preventing sunscald. Avoid excessive pruning that exposes fruits to direct sunlight.
*   **Windbreaks:**
    *   Plant taller, hardy crops as border rows (e.g., pearl millet, sorghum) to act as physical windbreaks against hot, dry "Loo" winds. This reduces desiccation and physical damage to the watermelon plants.
*   **Foliar Application of Kaolin Clay:**
    *   **Kaolin clay** (e.g., 50-75 g/L of water) can be sprayed on the foliage and fruits. It forms a white, reflective film that reduces leaf and fruit surface temperatures by reflecting solar radiation, thereby mitigating heat stress and preventing sunscald.
    *   Repeat application may be needed after heavy rains or every 10-14 days during peak heat periods to maintain the protective layer.

### General Recommendations

*   **Variety Selection:** Choose watermelon varieties known for their tolerance to local environmental conditions. Consult HAU experts for recommendations on heat-tolerant varieties suitable for Haryana.
*   **Soil Health:** Healthy soil with good organic matter content improves water retention, nutrient availability, and overall plant vigor, making plants more resilient to various environmental stresses.

By implementing these practices, you can significantly protect your watermelon crop from environmental stresses and ensure a healthy, productive harvest.
