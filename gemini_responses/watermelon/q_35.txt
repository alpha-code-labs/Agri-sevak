As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding watermelon maturity, harvesting, and cutting processes for cultivation in Haryana:

### Maturity Signs for Watermelon

Identifying the correct maturity stage is crucial for optimal taste, sweetness, and shelf life. Look for the following indicators:

*   **Drying of the Tendril:** The most reliable indicator. The tendril (a small, curly vine-like structure) closest to the fruit's stem will dry out and turn brown. If the tendril is still green, the fruit is likely not fully ripe.
*   **Ground Spot Color:** The part of the watermelon that rests on the ground will change color from white or pale green to a creamy yellow or golden hue. This indicates the fruit has stopped growing and is ripening.
*   **Sound Test:** When tapped firmly with knuckles, a ripe watermelon will produce a dull, hollow thud. An unripe watermelon will typically sound more metallic or high-pitched.
*   **Skin Luster:** The glossy sheen on the watermelon's skin tends to dull as it ripens. A ripe watermelon will have a more matte appearance.
*   **Weight for Size:** A ripe watermelon will feel heavy for its size due to its high water content and sugar accumulation.
*   **Stem Condition:** The stem connecting the fruit to the main vine may show slight shriveling or drying near the fruit attachment point.

### Harvesting Time

*   **Days from Planting:** Watermelons typically mature 75-90 days after planting, depending on the specific variety and prevailing environmental conditions (temperature, sunlight).
*   **Observation of Maturity Signs:** Harvest when at least 90% of the fruits on the vine exhibit the combination of maturity signs mentioned above, especially the dried tendril and yellow ground spot.
*   **Time of Day:** It is best to harvest watermelons in the cooler parts of the day, either early morning or late afternoon, to minimize heat stress on the fruit and the harvesting crew.

### Cutting Process

Proper cutting is essential to prevent damage to the fruit and the vine, ensuring better post-harvest quality and potential for subsequent fruit development.

*   **Tools:** Use a sharp knife or pruning shears.
*   **Cutting Point:** Cut the stem about 2-5 cm (1-2 inches) above the fruit. Do not pull or twist the fruit off the vine, as this can cause internal bruising to the fruit or damage the vine, potentially affecting future yields.
*   **Stem Retention:** Leaving a short piece of stem attached to the watermelon helps in better storage and reduces the risk of rot or pathogen entry through the stem end.
*   **Gentle Handling:** Handle harvested watermelons carefully to avoid bruising, which can significantly reduce their shelf life and market value. Place them gently into collection bins or on padded surfaces.
