Namaste, Kisan Bhaiyon! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I understand the significant challenges posed by wilt diseases in watermelon cultivation, which can lead to substantial yield losses. Effective management requires an integrated approach.

Wilt in watermelon is primarily caused by the soil-borne fungus *Fusarium oxysporum* f. sp. *niveum* (FON), leading to Fusarium wilt. Parawilt is a term often used for a sudden, rapid wilting and collapse of the plant, which can be due to a complex of factors including physiological stress, root damage, sudden environmental changes, or sometimes secondary root rot pathogens like *Pythium* species, rather than a single primary wilt pathogen like Fusarium.

Here's a scientifically verified approach to control wilt (including parawilt) in watermelon:

**I. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Approach**
A combination of cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods is crucial for sustainable management.

**II. Control Measures**

**A. Cultural and Agronomic Practices (Foundation for Wilt Management)**

1.  **Resistant Varieties/Rootstocks:**
    *   The most effective long-term solution for Fusarium wilt is to use resistant or tolerant watermelon varieties. Consult with HAU or local agricultural extension for recommended varieties suitable for Haryana.
    *   Grafting watermelon scions onto resistant rootstocks (e.g., specific bottle gourd or interspecific squash hybrids) is highly effective against Fusarium wilt and can also improve tolerance to other soil-borne diseases and stresses.

2.  **Crop Rotation:**
    *   Practice a long crop rotation of at least 3-5 years with non-cucurbit crops (e.g., maize, wheat, pearl millet, mustard) to reduce the inoculum load of *Fusarium oxysporum* in the soil.

3.  **Soil Solarization:**
    *   During the hot summer months (May-June), cover the prepared field with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks. This raises soil temperature, effectively killing soil-borne pathogens, including Fusarium spores.

4.  **Field Sanitation:**
    *   Remove and destroy infected plant debris immediately to prevent the spread of pathogens.
    *   Clean farm tools and equipment thoroughly after working in infected fields.

5.  **Water Management:**
    *   Avoid both waterlogging and severe drought stress, as both can predispose plants to wilt or cause parawilt-like symptoms.
    *   Use drip irrigation to deliver water directly to the root zone, minimizing leaf wetness and optimizing soil moisture.

6.  **Soil Health and Nutrition:**
    *   Maintain optimal soil pH (6.0-7.0) and ensure good soil drainage.
    *   Apply balanced fertilizers. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can make plants more susceptible to diseases. Incorporate organic matter to improve soil structure and microbial activity.

7.  **Avoid Root Damage:**
    *   Be careful during intercultural operations to avoid damaging roots, as root injuries can provide entry points for pathogens and contribute to parawilt.

**B. Biological Control**

1.  **Seed Treatment:**
    *   Treat watermelon seeds with bio-fungicides before sowing.
    *   **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum**: Apply at 4-6 g per kg of seed.
    *   **Pseudomonas fluorescens**: Apply at 10 g per kg of seed.

2.  **Soil Application:**
    *   Mix **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum** (2.5 kg per acre) or **Pseudomonas fluorescens** (2.5 kg per acre) with 50-100 kg of farmyard manure (FYM) or compost. Keep the mixture moist for 7-10 days in a shaded area, then broadcast it evenly in the field before planting or apply it near the root zone of established plants.

**C. Chemical Control (Use Judiciously and as a Supplement to Cultural/Biological Methods)**

*   **Note:** Always ensure proper diagnosis of the specific wilt type before applying chemicals. For parawilt, if a root rot pathogen is suspected, specific fungicides may be considered.

1.  **Seed Treatment:**
    *   To protect seedlings from early infection and damping-off:
        *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: 2 g per kg of seed.
        *   **Thiram** 75% WS: 2-3 g per kg of seed.

2.  **Soil Drench/Drip Application (for Fusarium Wilt):**
    *   At the time of transplanting or at the first sign of symptoms, drench the soil around the plant base or apply through drip irrigation. Repeat if necessary, following label instructions.
        *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: 1-2 g per liter of water (drench 100-200 ml solution per plant).
        *   **Thiophanate Methyl** 70% WP: 1-1.5 g per liter of water (drench 100-200 ml solution per plant).

3.  **For Root Rot Complex (if suspected in Parawilt):**
    *   If root rot pathogens like *Pythium* are suspected to be contributing to parawilt-like symptoms, fungicides effective against oomycetes can be considered.
        *   **Propamocarb Hydrochloride** 72.2% SL: 2-3 ml per liter of water (drench 100-200 ml solution per plant).

Always read and follow the instructions on the product label carefully, including dosage, application method, and safety precautions. Consult your local HAU extension specialist for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions.
