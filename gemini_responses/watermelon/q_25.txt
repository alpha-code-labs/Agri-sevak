Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, I can provide you with comprehensive, scientifically verified advice on irrigation management for watermelon cultivation in Haryana. Watermelon requires careful water management to ensure optimal yield and fruit quality.

Here is the detailed information:

### Irrigation Management for Watermelon

Watermelon is a water-loving crop, especially during its critical growth stages. However, it is also sensitive to waterlogging. The goal is to maintain consistent soil moisture without saturation.

#### 1. First Irrigation

*   **Pre-sowing Irrigation (Palewa):** It is highly recommended to give a pre-sowing irrigation (palewa) to ensure adequate moisture for germination. This helps in uniform emergence.
*   **Post-sowing First Irrigation:** If a pre-sowing irrigation was given, the first irrigation after sowing should be light and applied around **7-10 days after sowing**, or when the seedlings have fully emerged and developed their first true leaves. This allows the root system to establish without being waterlogged.
*   **If no Pre-sowing Irrigation:** If the soil is dry and no pre-sowing irrigation was given, a very light irrigation immediately after sowing might be necessary to aid germination. However, care must be taken to avoid crust formation, which can hinder seedling emergence.

#### 2. Second Irrigation

*   The second irrigation typically follows **10-15 days after the first irrigation**, depending on the soil type, prevailing weather conditions (temperature, humidity, wind), and the plant's growth stage.
*   Observe the soil moisture status. Irrigate when the top 5-10 cm of soil starts to feel dry to the touch.

#### 3. General Irrigation Management and Frequency

*   **Critical Stages:** Watermelon has high water requirements during specific growth stages:
    *   **Flowering:** Adequate moisture is crucial for flower development and pollination.
    *   **Fruit Set:** Water stress during this period can lead to poor fruit set and fruit drop.
    *   **Fruit Development/Enlargement:** This is the most critical stage. Consistent and ample water supply is essential for achieving good fruit size and yield. Water stress here will severely reduce fruit size and marketability.
*   **Frequency:**
    *   **Vegetative Growth:** Moderate irrigation, ensuring the soil remains moist but not waterlogged.
    *   **Flowering to Fruit Development:** Increase irrigation frequency and quantity. During peak fruit development, irrigation may be required every **4-7 days** in sandy soils, and every **7-10 days** in heavier soils, depending on evapotranspiration rates.
    *   **Maturity (7-10 days before harvest):** Gradually reduce or stop irrigation as fruits approach maturity. This practice helps in increasing the sugar content (Brix value) of the fruit and prevents fruit cracking. Excessive water close to harvest can lead to bland, watery fruits and increased incidence of cracking.
*   **Soil Type:**
    *   **Sandy Soils:** Require more frequent but lighter irrigations due to their low water holding capacity.
    *   **Heavier Soils:** Require less frequent but heavier irrigations.
*   **Monitoring:** Regularly check soil moisture by hand or using tensiometers to determine the exact irrigation schedule.

#### 4. Sprinkler Use

*   **Advantages:**
    *   **Uniformity:** Can provide more uniform water distribution compared to traditional flood irrigation, especially on uneven terrain.
    *   **Water Saving:** Generally saves water compared to flood irrigation, though less efficient than drip irrigation.
    *   **Fertigation:** Can be adapted for applying water-soluble fertilizers (fertigation).
*   **Disadvantages:**
    *   **Foliar Diseases:** Wetting of foliage can increase the risk of fungal diseases (e.g., downy mildew, powdery mildew) if leaves remain wet for extended periods, especially during cooler temperatures or high humidity.
    *   **Evaporation Losses:** Water loss due to evaporation and wind drift can be significant, especially during hot, windy conditions.
    *   **Initial Cost:** Higher initial investment compared to flood irrigation.
*   **Recommendation:** If using sprinklers, it is advisable to irrigate in the morning hours. This allows the foliage to dry quickly under sunlight, reducing the risk of disease development. However, for optimal water use efficiency and disease management, **drip irrigation is strongly recommended over sprinkler irrigation for watermelon.**

#### 5. Drip Irrigation (Highly Recommended)

*   **Superiority:** Drip irrigation is the most efficient and recommended method for watermelon cultivation, especially in regions like Haryana where water conservation is paramount.
*   **Advantages:**
    *   **Maximum Water Use Efficiency:** Reduces water consumption by 40-60% compared to surface irrigation methods, delivering water directly to the root zone.
    *   **Optimized Nutrient Delivery (Fertigation):** Allows for precise application of water-soluble fertilizers directly to the root zone, improving nutrient uptake and reducing fertilizer waste and leaching.
    *   **Reduced Weed Growth:** Minimizes wetting of inter-row spaces, thereby suppressing weed germination and growth.
    *   **Disease Control:** Keeps foliage dry, significantly reducing the incidence of foliar diseases.
    *   **Improved Yield and Quality:** Consistent moisture supply leads to higher yields, larger fruits, and better fruit quality (higher Brix).
    *   **Labor Saving:** Reduces labor requirements for irrigation and weeding.
    *   **Adaptability:** Suitable for various soil types and terrains.

By adopting these scientifically sound irrigation practices, particularly emphasizing drip irrigation, you can achieve excellent watermelon yields and quality while conserving precious water resources.
