As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified recommendations for the use of growth regulators and Boron in Watermelon cultivation in Haryana:

It is crucial to remember that the precise application of growth regulators is vital. Always read and follow the manufacturer's instructions on the product label, and consider conducting a small-scale trial before widespread application.

### Recommended Doses of Growth Regulators/Hormones and Boron in Watermelon:

1.  **Ethephon (Technical name for Ethrel)**
    *   **Purpose:** Primarily used for inducing female flowers, which can lead to earlier and higher fruit set, especially in monoecious varieties. It can also promote fruit ripening in some cases, though less commonly the primary use in watermelon.
    *   **Dose:**
        *   Foliar spray of **Ethephon** at 100-250 ppm (parts per million).
        *   For a commercial formulation (e.g., 39% SL), this typically translates to **0.25 - 0.65 ml per litre of water**.
    *   **Timing:** Apply at the 2-4 true leaf stage of the plant.

2.  **2,4-D**
    *   **Purpose:** At extremely low concentrations, 2,4-D can act as an auxin, potentially improving fruit set and size. However, its margin of safety is very narrow, and even slightly higher doses are highly phytotoxic (damaging to plants), as it is primarily known as a herbicide.
    *   **Dose:**
        *   Foliar spray of **2,4-D** at an extremely low concentration of 1-5 ppm.
        *   For a common formulation (e.g., 80% Sodium Salt WP), this translates to approximately **0.00125 - 0.00625 grams per litre of water**.
    *   **Timing:** Apply at the flowering or early fruit set stage.
    *   **Important Caution:** Due to the extremely narrow margin of safety and the high risk of phytotoxicity, the use of 2,4-D as a growth regulator in watermelon is **generally not recommended for routine farmer application** unless under very controlled conditions and with precise measuring equipment. Misapplication can lead to severe crop damage or complete crop failure. Farmers are advised to exercise extreme caution or avoid its use for this purpose.

3.  **Boron**
    *   **Purpose:** Boron is an essential micronutrient critical for pollen germination, fertilization, fruit set, and overall fruit development. It helps prevent fruit cracking and malformation.
    *   **Dose:**
        *   **Foliar Application:**
            *   Spray **Borax (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate)** (containing approximately 10-11% Boron) at **1-2 grams per litre of water**.
            *   Alternatively, spray **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (containing approximately 20.5% Boron, e.g., Solubor) at **0.5-1 gram per litre of water**.
        *   **Soil Application (if deficiency is confirmed by soil test):**
            *   Apply **1-2 kg of Borax per acre** as a basal application before planting or as a side-dressing.
    *   **Timing:**
        *   For foliar application, spray before flowering and repeat at early fruit set.
        *   For soil application, incorporate before planting or at the time of sowing.

Always ensure uniform spray coverage and avoid spraying during hot periods of the day. For specific local conditions and product availability, it is always advisable to consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts.
