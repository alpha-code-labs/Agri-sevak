Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in Watermelon cultivation in Haryana.

It's crucial to adopt an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods for sustainable and effective control.

### Control of Beetles in Watermelon

Beetles, such as cucumber beetles (striped and spotted) and flea beetles, are common pests of watermelon. They can cause significant damage by feeding on leaves, stems, and fruits, and some also vector diseases like bacterial wilt.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Beetles:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting watermelon or other cucurbits in the same field year after year.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove weeds and crop residues that can harbor pests.
    *   **Timely Planting:** Plant early to allow plants to establish before peak beetle populations.
    *   **Row Covers:** Use physical barriers like floating row covers during the seedling stage to protect young plants.
2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Encourage natural enemies like parasitic wasps and predatory beetles.
3.  **Chemical Control:**
    *   Apply insecticides when pest populations reach economic threshold levels, typically when 1-2 beetles per plant are observed on young plants, or significant defoliation occurs.
    *   Ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves.
    *   Recommended CIBRC approved technical chemicals for foliar application:
        *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** 0.5 - 1.0 ml per litre of water (or 100 - 200 ml per acre).
        *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** 0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water (or 80 - 160 g per acre).
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** 0.5 - 1.0 ml per litre of water (or 200 - 400 ml per acre).
        *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** 0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water (or 80 - 160 g per acre).

### Control of Weevils in Watermelon

While true weevils are not as common or major pests of watermelon as some beetles, certain species like the vegetable weevil can occasionally cause damage by feeding on leaves and stems.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Weevils:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove weeds and plant debris that can serve as hosts or hiding places.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation to break the pest cycle.
2.  **Chemical Control:**
    *   If weevil infestation is observed, insecticides effective against chewing pests can be used.
    *   Recommended CIBRC approved technical chemicals for foliar application:
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** 0.5 - 1.0 ml per litre of water (or 200 - 400 ml per acre).
        *   **Fipronil 5% SC:** 1.5 - 2.0 ml per litre of water (or 600 - 800 ml per acre).
        *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** 0.5 - 1.0 ml per litre of water (or 100 - 200 ml per acre).

### Control of Sawflies in Watermelon

This is not known to affect Watermelon. Sawflies are primarily pests of trees, shrubs, and some other herbaceous plants, but they are not typically associated with cucurbit crops like watermelon.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label for correct dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.
*   Consult your local agricultural extension officer or Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) for the most current and specific recommendations for your region and situation.
