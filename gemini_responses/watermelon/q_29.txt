Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

Regarding your query about 'Dropping' in Watermelon:

Firstly, it is important to clarify the terms you've used:
*   **Boll dropping:** This phenomenon is specific to cotton (Gossypium spp.) and does not occur in Watermelon (Citrullus lanatus). Watermelon produces fruits, not bolls.
*   **Tinda dropping:** Tinda (Indian round gourd, Praecitrullus fistulosus) is a different cucurbit crop. While it can experience flower and fruit drop, the advice below is specifically tailored for Watermelon.

Now, let's address the issue of Flower Drop and Fruit Drop in Watermelon, which are common physiological problems. These can significantly reduce yield if not managed properly.

**Causes of Flower and Fruit Drop in Watermelon:**
The dropping of flowers and young fruits in watermelon is primarily a physiological response to various stresses, including:
*   **Environmental Stress:** High or low temperatures (especially during flowering), sudden changes in temperature, water stress (either drought or waterlogging), high humidity, or low light intensity.
*   **Nutritional Deficiencies:** Lack of essential micronutrients like Boron and Calcium, or macronutrients like Phosphorus and Potassium.
*   **Poor Pollination:** Insufficient number of pollinators (bees), non-viable pollen, or adverse weather conditions (rain, high winds) during the pollination period.
*   **Hormonal Imbalance:** Imbalance of plant growth regulators (e.g., excess ethylene, insufficient auxins).
*   **Excessive Fruit Load:** The plant naturally sheds flowers or young fruits if it cannot support the development of all of them.
*   **Pest and Disease Stress:** Severe infestations or infections can weaken the plant, leading to abortion of flowers and fruits.

**Control Measures for Flower and Fruit Drop in Watermelon:**

A holistic approach combining good cultural practices, balanced nutrition, and judicious use of plant growth regulators is recommended.

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Optimal Planting Time:** Plant watermelon during the recommended season for Haryana to avoid extreme temperatures during critical growth stages.
*   **Water Management:** Maintain consistent soil moisture. Avoid both waterlogging and severe drought stress, especially during flowering and fruit development. Use drip irrigation for efficient water use.
*   **Pollination Enhancement:**
    *   Ensure adequate bee activity. Avoid spraying insecticides during the flowering period when bees are most active.
    *   Consider placing bee hives near the field if natural pollinator populations are low.
*   **Weed Control:** Keep the field free of weeds to reduce competition for water, nutrients, and light.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Adhere to recommended plant spacing to ensure adequate light penetration and air circulation.

**2. Nutritional Management:**
*   **Soil Testing:** Conduct regular soil tests to determine nutrient status and apply fertilizers accordingly.
*   **Balanced Fertilization:** Ensure adequate supply of all macro and micronutrients.
*   **Boron Application:** Boron is crucial for pollen viability and fruit set.
    *   Foliar spray of **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (e.g., Borax or Solubor) at 1-2 g/L of water, applied at pre-flowering and early fruit set stages.
*   **Calcium Application:** Calcium is vital for cell wall development and fruit quality.
    *   Foliar spray of **Calcium Nitrate** at 5-10 g/L of water, applied during fruit development.
*   **Potassium Application:** Adequate Potassium helps in fruit development and stress tolerance. Ensure sufficient soil application as per soil test recommendations.

**3. Hormonal Management (Plant Growth Regulators):**
*   **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA):** This auxin is effective in preventing flower and fruit drop by promoting fruit retention.
    *   Foliar spray of **Naphthalene Acetic Acid** (4.5% SL formulation) at 0.2-0.4 ml/L of water (equivalent to 10-20 ppm) at the early flowering stage and again at the fruit set stage (when fruits are pea to marble size). Ensure thorough coverage.

**4. Pest and Disease Management:**
*   Implement an Integrated Pest and Disease Management (IPM) strategy to keep plants healthy and reduce stress that could lead to dropping. Regularly scout for pests and diseases and take timely control measures using CIBRC-approved chemicals.

By implementing these scientifically verified practices, you can significantly reduce flower and fruit drop in your watermelon crop and achieve better yields.
