Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the critical role micronutrients play in achieving optimal yield and quality in watermelon cultivation. Deficiencies can significantly impact plant health and fruit development.

Before applying any micronutrient, it is highly recommended to conduct a soil test to accurately diagnose specific deficiencies and their severity. This allows for targeted and efficient nutrient management. Visual symptoms can also guide initial assessment.

Here's how to address common micronutrient deficiencies in watermelon:

### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Stunted plant growth, small and narrow leaves (often called "little leaf"), interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, and sometimes bronzing of older leaves. Poor fruit set and development can also occur.

**Correction:**
*   **Soil Application (Preventive/Severe Deficiency):**
    *   Apply **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** (21% Zn) @ 10-15 kg/acre, or **Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate** (33% Zn) @ 6-8 kg/acre, broadcast and incorporated into the soil before planting. This application is generally effective for 2-3 years.
*   **Foliar Spray (Corrective/Mild Deficiency):**
    *   Spray **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** @ 5 g/L of water (0.5% solution) or **Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate** @ 3 g/L of water (0.3% solution). Add 1 g/L of unslaked lime (calcium hydroxide) to neutralize acidity and prevent leaf burn. Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, starting when symptoms appear or at the early vegetative stage.

### 2. Iron (Fe) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Pronounced interveinal chlorosis on the youngest leaves, where the leaf tissue turns yellow while the veins remain distinctly green. In severe cases, the entire leaf may turn pale yellow or white.

**Correction:**
*   **Foliar Spray (Most Effective for Quick Correction):**
    *   Spray **Ferrous Sulphate Heptahydrate** @ 5 g/L of water (0.5% solution) with 1 g/L of unslaked lime.
    *   Alternatively, use **Ferrous EDTA** (chelated iron) @ 1-2 g/L of water.
    *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 7-10 day intervals, focusing on thorough coverage of young foliage.
*   **Soil Application (For persistent issues, less common for watermelon):**
    *   Apply **Ferrous Sulphate Heptahydrate** @ 20-25 kg/acre, mixed with farmyard manure, in problematic areas.

### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Stunted growth, thickening and brittleness of young leaves, death of growing points (terminal buds), poor fruit set, and internal fruit disorders like "hollow heart" or cracking of fruits.

**Correction:**
*   **Soil Application (Preventive/Severe Deficiency):**
    *   Apply **Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate** (Borax, 10.5% B) @ 4-6 kg/acre, broadcast and incorporated into the soil before planting.
*   **Foliar Spray (Corrective/Preventive):**
    *   Spray **Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate** (Borax) @ 1.5-2 g/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, use **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (20% B) @ 1-1.5 g/L of water.
    *   Apply 2 sprays: one before flowering and another at early fruit set.

### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Most notably, Blossom End Rot (BER) in fruits, characterized by a dark, sunken, leathery spot at the blossom end of the fruit. Young leaves may show marginal necrosis (browning of edges) and distorted growth.

**Correction:**
*   **Foliar Spray (Most Effective for BER):**
    *   Spray **Calcium Nitrate** @ 5-7 g/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, use **Calcium Chloride** @ 4-5 g/L of water.
    *   Begin spraying at early fruit set and continue with 2-3 applications at 7-10 day intervals, ensuring good coverage of fruits and foliage. Ensure adequate and consistent soil moisture, as water stress exacerbates BER.

### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, where the areas between the veins turn yellow, but the veins remain green. In severe cases, the yellow areas may turn brown or purplish.

**Correction:**
*   **Soil Application (Preventive/Severe Deficiency):**
    *   Apply **Magnesium Sulphate Heptahydrate** @ 10-15 kg/acre, broadcast and incorporated into the soil before planting.
*   **Foliar Spray (Corrective/Mild Deficiency):**
    *   Spray **Magnesium Sulphate Heptahydrate** @ 5 g/L of water (0.5% solution).
    *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, starting when symptoms appear.

### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, similar to iron deficiency but often less distinct, with a more diffuse yellowing. Small necrotic (dead) spots may appear in severe cases. Growth can be stunted.

**Correction:**
*   **Soil Application (Preventive/Severe Deficiency):**
    *   Apply **Manganese Sulphate Monohydrate** @ 8-10 kg/acre, broadcast and incorporated into the soil before planting.
*   **Foliar Spray (Corrective/Mild Deficiency):**
    *   Spray **Manganese Sulphate Monohydrate** @ 3-4 g/L of water.
    *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, starting when symptoms appear.

**General Recommendations:**

*   **Soil Testing:** Always start with a comprehensive soil test to determine the exact nutrient status of your field. This is the most scientific approach to nutrient management.
*   **Timing:** Apply foliar sprays during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to maximize absorption and minimize leaf burn.
*   **Water Quality:** Use clean water for preparing spray solutions.
*   **Compatibility:** When mixing multiple chemicals, always perform a small jar test to check for compatibility before large-scale application.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management:** Combine micronutrient applications with balanced primary and secondary nutrient fertilization for overall plant health.
