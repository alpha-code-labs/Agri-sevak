Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, I understand the critical importance of managing rot diseases in watermelon, which can severely impact yield and quality. The term "rot" encompasses a wide range of diseases caused by various fungal and bacterial pathogens, often exacerbated by environmental conditions. Effective control requires an integrated approach combining cultural practices and judicious use of CIBRC-approved chemicals.

Here's a comprehensive guide to control various rot types in watermelon:

**I. General Cultural and Preventive Measures (Crucial for all Rot Types):**

These practices are fundamental to reducing the incidence and spread of all rot diseases, including Root, Stem, Foot, Collar, Crown, Neck, Black, Fruit, Seed, and Seedling rot.

*   **Crop Rotation:** Implement a 3-4 year crop rotation with non-cucurbit crops to break the disease cycle of soil-borne pathogens.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Whenever possible, choose watermelon varieties known for their resistance or tolerance to common rot-causing pathogens in your region.
*   **Soil Health and Drainage:**
    *   Ensure well-drained soils. Waterlogging is a major predisposing factor for most rots.
    *   Cultivate on raised beds to improve drainage around the root and crown area.
    *   Incorporate organic matter to improve soil structure and microbial activity.
*   **Irrigation Management:**
    *   Avoid overhead irrigation, especially during fruit development, as it can splash soil-borne pathogens onto plants and create a humid environment conducive to disease.
    *   Use drip irrigation to deliver water directly to the root zone, keeping foliage and fruits dry.
    *   Irrigate in the morning to allow foliage to dry before evening.
    *   Avoid over-watering.
*   **Planting Density:** Maintain optimal plant spacing to ensure good air circulation, which reduces humidity around the plants.
*   **Sanitation:**
    *   Remove and destroy infected plant debris, fruits, and weeds promptly.
    *   Clean tools and equipment regularly to prevent pathogen spread.
*   **Nutrition:** Provide balanced nutrition to ensure strong, healthy plants that are more resilient to disease. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can lead to lush, susceptible growth.
*   **Mulching:** Use plastic mulch to prevent direct contact of fruits with soil, reducing the risk of fruit rot.

**II. Specific Chemical Control Measures:**

These measures target the pathogens causing Root, Stem, Foot, Collar, Crown, Neck, Black, Fruit, Seed, and Seedling rots. "Neck rot" is often associated with stem or fruit rot depending on the location, and the control measures for those will apply.

**A. Seed Treatment (for Seed Rot, Seedling Rot/Damping-off, and early Root Rot):**

Treating seeds before planting is crucial for protecting young seedlings from soil-borne pathogens.

*   **For broad-spectrum fungal control:**
    *   **Thiram** @ 2-3 g/kg seed
    *   **Captan** @ 2-3 g/kg seed
    *   **Carbendazim** @ 1-2 g/kg seed
*   **For Oomycete pathogens (e.g., *Pythium*, *Phytophthora*):**
    *   **Metalaxyl** @ 1-2 g/kg seed

**B. Soil Drench / Drip Application (for Root, Stem, Foot, Collar, Crown Rots):**

These applications deliver fungicides directly to the root zone or plant base, targeting soil-borne pathogens.

*   **For Oomycete pathogens (e.g., *Pythium*, *Phytophthora*):**
    *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride** @ 2-3 ml/L of water, applied as a drench around the plant base or through drip irrigation.
    *   **Metalaxyl** @ 1-2 g/L of water, applied as a drench.
    *   **Fosetyl-aluminium** @ 2-3 g/L of water, applied as a drench.
*   **For other fungal pathogens (e.g., *Rhizoctonia*, *Fusarium*, *Sclerotium*):**
    *   **Carbendazim** @ 1-2 g/L of water, applied as a drench around the plant base.

**C. Foliar Spray (for Stem, Black, Fruit Rots, and some Collar/Crown Rots if pathogen spreads aerially):**

These sprays protect above-ground parts of the plant, including stems and fruits.

*   **For Gummy Stem Blight (Black Rot on stems/fruits) and Anthracnose (Fruit Rot):**
    *   **Mancozeb** @ 2-2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Chlorothalonil** @ 2 g/L of water.
    *   **Tebuconazole** @ 0.75-1 ml/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin** @ 0.5-1 ml/L of water.
    *   **Pyraclostrobin** @ 0.5-1 ml/L of water (often in combination products).
    *   **Difenoconazole** @ 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   Apply these fungicides preventively, especially during periods of high humidity or rainfall, and continue at recommended intervals.
*   **For Bacterial Soft Rot (Fruit Rot, Stem Rot):**
    *   **Streptomycin sulphate + Tetracycline hydrochloride** (combination product) @ 1 g/10 L of water. Apply as a foliar spray or drench.
    *   Copper-based fungicides like **Copper oxychloride** (2.5-3 g/L) can also offer some bacterial control, but are primarily fungicidal.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Diagnosis:** Accurate identification of the specific pathogen causing the rot is crucial for selecting the most effective control measure. If unsure, consult with HAU experts or local agricultural extension officers.
*   **Integrated Pest Management (IPM):** Always integrate chemical controls with cultural practices for sustainable and effective disease management.
*   **Label Instructions:** Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the chemical product label for dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest intervals.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pathogen resistance.

By implementing these scientifically verified strategies, watermelon growers in Haryana can significantly reduce the impact of rot diseases and ensure a healthy, productive crop.
