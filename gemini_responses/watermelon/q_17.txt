As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following doses of organic manures for Watermelon cultivation in Haryana to enhance soil health, nutrient availability, and overall crop productivity:

*   **Farmyard Manure (FYM)**
    *   **Dose:** 10-15 tonnes per acre.
    *   **Application:** Apply well-decomposed FYM uniformly across the field during land preparation, at least 2-3 weeks before planting, and thoroughly incorporate it into the soil. This provides a slow-release source of macro and micronutrients and improves soil structure.

*   **Vermicompost**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 tonnes per acre.
    *   **Application:** Vermicompost can be applied during land preparation, either broadcasted and incorporated into the soil or applied directly in the planting pits/rows. It is richer in nutrients and microbial activity compared to FYM, promoting better root development and nutrient uptake.

*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract)**
    *   **Dose:**
        *   **Foliar Spray:** 2-4 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Soil Drench/Drip Application:** 1-2 litres per acre.
    *   **Application:** Sagarika is a seaweed extract-based biostimulant, not a bulk organic manure. It enhances plant growth, improves nutrient uptake, and increases stress tolerance.
        *   **Foliar Spray:** Apply at critical growth stages such as vegetative growth, pre-flowering, and fruit development. Repeat every 15-20 days as needed.
        *   **Soil Drench/Drip:** Can be applied through irrigation systems during early growth stages to stimulate root development.
