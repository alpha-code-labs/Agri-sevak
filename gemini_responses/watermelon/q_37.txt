Protecting watermelon crops from wild animals is a significant challenge for farmers in Haryana. Various animals, including wild boars, nilgai, monkeys, and rodents, can cause substantial damage. Here are scientifically verified methods to mitigate this problem:

### Methods to Protect Watermelon from Wild Animals

1.  **Physical Barriers:**
    *   **Fencing:**
        *   **Barbed Wire Fencing:** A multi-strand barbed wire fence (5-7 strands) can deter larger animals like nilgai and wild boars. Ensure the fence is at least 1.5-2 meters high and properly tensioned.
        *   **Chain-Link or Woven Wire Fencing:** More effective against a wider range of animals, including monkeys and smaller mammals, if installed with appropriate mesh size and height.
        *   **Electric Fencing:** A low-cost, effective deterrent for many animals. It delivers a non-lethal shock that discourages animals from entering. It requires careful installation and regular maintenance to ensure safety and effectiveness. Ensure proper earthing and signage.
        *   **Stone Walls/Hedges:** In some areas, dense thorny hedges (e.g., *Prosopis juliflora* or *Acacia nilotica*) or stone walls can act as barriers, though they are less immediate solutions.
    *   **Netting:** For smaller animals and birds, overhead netting or side netting can be used, especially in smaller plots, to prevent damage.

2.  **Cultural and Management Practices:**
    *   **Human Surveillance/Watchmen:** Employing watchmen or farmers actively patrolling the fields, especially during critical periods (fruiting and ripening), is one of the most effective methods.
    *   **Guard Dogs:** Trained guard dogs can be very effective in deterring animals, particularly at night.
    *   **Scare Devices:**
        *   **Scarecrows:** Regularly moving and changing the appearance of scarecrows can maintain their effectiveness.
        *   **Sound Devices:** Using firecrackers, gas guns (bird scarers), or recorded sounds of predators can deter animals. These need to be used judiciously and varied to prevent habituation.
        *   **Reflective Tapes/CDs:** Hanging reflective tapes or old CDs can create visual disturbances that deter birds and some smaller animals.
    *   **Habitat Management:**
        *   **Weed Control:** Keep the area around the watermelon field free of weeds and tall grasses, which can provide cover for wild animals.
        *   **Remove Attractants:** Ensure no food waste or other attractants are left near the fields that might draw animals.
    *   **Timely Harvesting:** Harvest watermelons as soon as they reach maturity to reduce the period they are vulnerable to animal damage.
    *   **Community Approach:** Collaborate with neighboring farmers to implement protection strategies over a larger area, which can be more effective than individual efforts.

3.  **Repellents (Limited CIBRC Approved Options for Wild Animals on Edible Crops):**
    *   While various traditional and natural repellents (e.g., chili powder, garlic paste, castor oil cakes) are sometimes used by farmers, there are very few CIBRC-approved technical chemical names specifically for wild animal deterrence on edible crops like watermelon in India. Therefore, relying on physical barriers and cultural practices is generally more recommended and scientifically verified for this purpose.
