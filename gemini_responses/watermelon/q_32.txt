Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

The symptom of "Drying up" (drying branches, leaves, fruits, and flowers) in watermelon is a general indication of severe stress or disease. It is crucial to accurately diagnose the underlying cause, as the management strategies differ significantly. As Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I advise you to carefully observe the specific patterns and associated symptoms before applying any treatment.

Here are the common causes for drying up in watermelon, along with their management:

### I. Abiotic Factors (Environmental/Non-Pathogenic)

These are often the first to consider, especially if symptoms appear uniformly across the field or are linked to recent weather events or cultural practices.

1.  **Water Stress (Drought or Waterlogging):**
    *   **Symptoms:**
        *   **Drought:** Leaves wilt, turn yellow, then brown and crisp, starting from the margins. Fruits may shrivel.
        *   **Waterlogging:** Roots suffocate, leading to general wilting, yellowing, and eventual drying of foliage, often accompanied by stunted growth.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Ensure proper irrigation scheduling based on soil moisture and crop stage.
        *   Provide adequate drainage to prevent water accumulation, especially in heavy soils.
        *   Use mulching to conserve soil moisture and regulate soil temperature.

2.  **Nutrient Deficiencies/Imbalances:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Specific nutrient deficiencies can lead to yellowing, necrosis, and drying of leaves. For example, severe potassium deficiency causes leaf margin scorching and drying. Calcium deficiency can lead to blossom end rot on fruits, which then dry up.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Conduct soil testing to determine nutrient status.
        *   Apply balanced fertilizers as per crop requirements.
        *   Foliar application of specific micronutrients if deficiency is confirmed.

3.  **Heat Stress/Sunscald:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Leaves may show scorching, especially on exposed parts. Fruits can develop bleached, sunken lesions on the side exposed to direct sun, leading to drying and secondary infections.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Maintain adequate soil moisture.
        *   Ensure proper plant spacing to allow for canopy development that shades fruits.
        *   Consider using shade nets during extreme heat waves if feasible for high-value crops.

### II. Biotic Factors (Diseases and Pests)

These involve living organisms causing damage.

#### A. Diseases

1.  **Fusarium Wilt (Caused by *Fusarium oxysporum* f. sp. *niveum*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Wilting of leaves, often starting on one side of the plant or a single vine, followed by yellowing, browning, and drying. Vascular discoloration (brown streaking) can be observed when the stem is cut near the soil line. Plants may die rapidly.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Use resistant or tolerant watermelon varieties.
        *   Practice long-term crop rotation (at least 3-5 years) with non-cucurbit crops.
        *   Ensure good field sanitation.
        *   **Chemical Control (Preventive/Early Stage):**
            *   Seed treatment with **Carbendazim** (1-2 g/kg seed) or **Thiophanate Methyl** (2 g/kg seed).
            *   Soil drenching with **Carbendazim** (0.5-1 g/L water) or **Thiophanate Methyl** (0.5-1 g/L water) around the root zone at early stages.

2.  **Gummy Stem Blight (Caused by *Didymella bryoniae* / *Stagonosporopsis cucurbitacearum*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Water-soaked lesions on leaves, stems, and fruits. Stem lesions often exude a characteristic brown, gummy substance, leading to girdling and subsequent wilting and drying of the vine beyond the lesion. Leaves develop large, irregular brown spots.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Use disease-free seeds and resistant varieties.
        *   Practice crop rotation.
        *   Remove and destroy infected plant debris.
        *   **Chemical Control:**
            *   Spray with **Mancozeb** (2-2.5 g/L water).
            *   Spray with **Chlorothalonil** (2 g/L water).
            *   Spray with **Azoxystrobin** (0.5-1 ml/L water).
            *   Spray with **Pyraclostrobin** (0.5-1 ml/L water).
            *   Spray with **Tebuconazole** (0.5-1 ml/L water).

3.  **Anthracnose (Caused by *Colletotrichum orbiculare*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Dark, sunken, circular lesions on leaves, stems, and fruits. Severe leaf infection causes defoliation and drying of affected leaves. Fruit lesions can be deep and lead to fruit rot.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Use resistant varieties and disease-free seeds.
        *   Practice crop rotation.
        *   Remove and destroy infected plant material.
        *   **Chemical Control:**
            *   Spray with **Mancozeb** (2-2.5 g/L water).
            *   Spray with **Chlorothalonil** (2 g/L water).
            *   Spray with **Carbendazim** (0.5-1 g/L water).
            *   Spray with **Azoxystrobin** (0.5-1 ml/L water).
            *   Spray with **Pyraclostrobin** (0.5-1 ml/L water).

4.  **Powdery Mildew (Caused by *Podosphaera xanthii* / *Erysiphe cichoracearum*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** White, powdery patches on the upper and lower surfaces of leaves and stems. In severe cases, leaves turn yellow, then brown, become brittle, and dry up prematurely, leading to reduced fruit quality and yield.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Use resistant varieties.
        *   Ensure good air circulation within the canopy.
        *   **Chemical Control:**
            *   Spray with **Sulphur (Wettable Powder)** (2-3 g/L water).
            *   Spray with **Myclobutanil** (0.4-0.5 g/L water).
            *   Spray with **Penconazole** (0.5 ml/L water).
            *   Spray with **Azoxystrobin** (0.5-1 ml/L water).
            *   Spray with **Tebuconazole** (0.5-1 ml/L water).

5.  **Downy Mildew (Caused by *Pseudoperonospora cubensis*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Angular yellow spots on the upper surface of older leaves, which later turn brown and necrotic. A purplish-brown fuzzy growth may be visible on the lower leaf surface, especially in humid conditions. Rapid drying and defoliation can occur in severe infections.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Use resistant varieties.
        *   Ensure good air circulation.
        *   **Chemical Control:**
            *   Spray with **Mancozeb** (2-2.5 g/L water).
            *   Spray with **Propineb** (2-2.5 g/L water).
            *   Spray with **Chlorothalonil** (2 g/L water).
            *   Spray with **Cymoxanil + Mancozeb** (2.5-3 g/L water).
            *   Spray with **Dimethomorph** (1 g/L water).
            *   Spray with **Fluopicolide** (0.5 ml/L water).

#### B. Pests

1.  **Spider Mites (e.g., Two-spotted Spider Mite - *Tetranychus urticae*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Tiny yellow stippling on leaves, followed by bronzing, curling, and premature drying of leaves. Fine webbing may be visible on the undersides of leaves in severe infestations.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Maintain good field hygiene.
        *   Ensure adequate irrigation to reduce mite populations.
        *   **Chemical Control:**
            *   Spray with **Spiromesifen** (0.5-1 ml/L water).
            *   Spray with **Fenpyroximate** (0.5 ml/L water).
            *   Spray with **Propargite** (1-1.5 ml/L water).
            *   Spray with **Abamectin** (0.25-0.5 ml/L water).

2.  **Stem Borers (Various species)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Wilting and drying of individual vines or entire plants due to larvae boring into the stem, disrupting water and nutrient flow. Entry holes and frass may be visible.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Remove and destroy infested plants or plant parts.
        *   Practice crop rotation.
        *   **Chemical Control (if identified and severe):**
            *   Spray with **Chlorantraniliprole** (0.3 ml/L water).
            *   Spray with **Emamectin Benzoate** (0.2 g/L water).

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Accurate Diagnosis:** It is paramount to correctly identify the cause. If unsure, collect samples (affected leaves, stems, roots) and consult with the plant pathology or entomology experts at HAU, Hisar, or your local Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK).
*   **Integrated Pest and Disease Management (IPDM):** Always prioritize cultural practices, resistant varieties, and biological control methods. Use chemical controls judiciously and as a last resort, following recommended dosages and safety precautions.
*   **Spray Coverage:** Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves, for effective disease and pest control.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) while handling and applying chemicals. Follow the instructions on the product label strictly.

By carefully observing your plants and implementing the appropriate management strategies, you can effectively address the "drying up" problem in your watermelon crop.
