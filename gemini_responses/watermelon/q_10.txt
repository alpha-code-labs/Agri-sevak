As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified strategies for controlling borers, caterpillars, and leaf folders in watermelon, specifically for conditions in Haryana.

**General Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Principles for Watermelon:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy infested plant parts, fallen fruits, and weeds, which can harbor pests.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting cucurbits in the same field consecutively to break pest cycles.
*   **Regular Monitoring:** Scout fields frequently (at least twice a week) to detect pest infestations early, allowing for timely intervention.

### 1. Control of Borers (Fruit Borers, Stem Borers)

Borers, such as the melon fruit fly (*Bactrocera cucurbitae*) and various lepidopteran fruit and stem borers, can cause significant damage to watermelon.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Collect and destroy all infested fruits and plant parts regularly to prevent further pest development.
    *   Deep ploughing after harvest can expose pupae in the soil, reducing the next generation.
*   **Mechanical Control:**
    *   Install pheromone traps (e.g., for melon fruit fly) at a density of 4-5 traps per acre to monitor pest populations and mass trap male flies.
*   **Biological Control:**
    *   Release of egg parasitoids like *Trichogramma chilonis* at 50,000 eggs per acre, 3-4 times at weekly intervals, starting from the flowering stage, can help manage lepidopteran borers.
*   **Chemical Control (Apply at fruit initiation or upon observing initial damage):**
    *   For lepidopteran fruit/stem borers:
        *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC at 0.4 ml/L of water.
        *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG at 0.2 g/L of water.
        *   **Flubendiamide** 20% WG at 0.25 g/L of water.
    *   For melon fruit fly (use as a bait spray):
        *   **Malathion** 50% EC at 2 ml/L mixed with 10 g jaggery/molasses per liter of water, applied as spot sprays on leaves.
        *   **Spinosad** 45% SC at 0.25 ml/L mixed with 10 g jaggery/molasses per liter of water, applied as spot sprays.

### 2. Control of Caterpillars (General Defoliators)

Various caterpillar species can feed on watermelon leaves and young fruits, causing defoliation and direct damage.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Hand-picking and destruction of visible larvae and egg masses in the early stages of infestation.
*   **Biological Control:**
    *   Spray formulations of **Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)** var. *kurstaki* at 1-2 g/L of water, which is particularly effective against young larvae.
*   **Chemical Control (Upon observing initial feeding damage):**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC at 0.4 ml/L of water.
    *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG at 0.2 g/L of water.
    *   **Indoxacarb** 14.5% SC at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 0.5 ml/L of water.

### 3. Diamondback Moth

This is not known to affect Watermelon. Diamondback moth (*Plutella xylostella*) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower, mustard).

### 4. Control of Leaf Folder

The cucurbit leaf folder (*Diaphania indica*) is a common pest that folds leaves and feeds inside, reducing photosynthetic area and plant vigor.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Regularly remove and destroy folded leaves containing larvae to reduce pest populations.
*   **Biological Control:**
    *   Spray formulations of **Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)** var. *kurstaki* at 1-2 g/L of water, effective against young larvae feeding within the folds.
*   **Chemical Control (Upon observing initial leaf folding):**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC at 0.4 ml/L of water.
    *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG at 0.2 g/L of water.
    *   **Flubendiamide** 20% WG at 0.25 g/L of water.
    *   **Indoxacarb** 14.5% SC at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Spinosad** 45% SC at 0.25 ml/L of water.
