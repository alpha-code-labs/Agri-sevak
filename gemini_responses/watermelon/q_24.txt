As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified practices for watermelon transplantation in Haryana:

### Ideal Transplantation Time

*   For Haryana, the ideal time for transplanting watermelon seedlings is from **late January to mid-March**.
*   **Early transplanting (late January - February)** can yield an earlier crop, provided adequate protection from any lingering cold spells or frost is ensured, especially during the initial establishment phase.
*   **Main season transplanting** typically occurs from **mid-February to mid-March** when the danger of frost has completely passed and soil temperatures are consistently above 18°C, which is crucial for root establishment and vigorous growth.

### Distance

Watermelon plants are vigorous vining crops and require ample space for optimal growth, fruit development, and air circulation.

*   A common and recommended spacing for watermelon in Haryana is:
    *   **Row-to-Row:** 2.0 - 3.0 meters
    *   **Plant-to-Plant:** 0.6 - 1.2 meters
*   A practical recommendation for most vining varieties is **2.5 meters between rows and 0.75 meters between plants within a row**. This spacing facilitates proper light interception, air movement, and ease of cultural operations.

### Process

1.  **Seedling Preparation:**
    *   Start watermelon seeds in nursery trays or small pots (e.g., 10 cm diameter) filled with a sterile, well-draining potting mix, approximately **3-4 weeks** before the intended transplanting date.
    *   Ensure seedlings develop 3-4 true leaves and a robust, healthy root system before transplanting.
    *   **Harden off** seedlings for 7-10 days prior to transplanting by gradually exposing them to outdoor conditions (reduced water, increased sunlight, cooler temperatures) to minimize transplant shock.

2.  **Field Preparation:**
    *   Select a well-drained, fertile field with good sunlight exposure.
    *   Prepare the field by deep ploughing, followed by 2-3 harrowing operations to achieve a fine tilth.
    *   Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost (20-25 tonnes/acre) during field preparation.
    *   Form ridges or raised beds according to the recommended row spacing. Raised beds are highly beneficial for drainage, root development, and managing irrigation.
    *   Consider laying **plastic mulch** on the beds before transplanting. This practice is highly recommended as it helps in weed control, conserves soil moisture, maintains optimal soil temperature, and can lead to earlier harvests and improved yields.

3.  **Transplanting Steps:**
    *   Transplant healthy, vigorous seedlings, preferably in the **late afternoon or evening**, or on a cloudy day, to reduce stress from direct sunlight and heat.
    *   Dig holes on the ridges/beds at the recommended plant-to-plant spacing, ensuring the holes are slightly larger than the seedling's root ball.
    *   Carefully remove the seedling from its container, taking utmost care not to disturb the root system. Handle seedlings by their leaves or root ball, not by the delicate stem.
    *   Place the seedling in the hole, ensuring the top of the root ball is level with the surrounding soil surface. Avoid planting too deep or too shallow.
    *   Gently firm the soil around the base of the seedling to ensure good root-to-soil contact and eliminate air pockets.
    *   **Immediately irrigate** the transplanted seedlings thoroughly to settle the soil around the roots and aid in rapid establishment.
    *   Monitor the transplanted seedlings closely for the first few days for signs of wilting or stress and provide light irrigation as needed.
