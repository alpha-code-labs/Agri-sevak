### Control of Scab, Canker, and Gummosis in Watermelon

Scab, Canker, and Gummosis are significant diseases that can affect watermelon crops. In watermelon, "Canker" and "Gummosis" are often associated with the same primary fungal pathogen, *Didymella bryoniae* (also known as *Stagonosporopsis cucurbitacearum*), which causes Gummy Stem Blight. This disease can lead to stem cankers and the characteristic gummy exudates (gummosis). Scab is caused by *Cladosporium cucumerinum*.

Effective management requires an integrated approach combining cultural practices and judicious use of fungicides.

**A. Cultural and Agronomic Practices:**

1.  **Resistant Varieties:** Whenever possible, choose watermelon varieties known to have resistance or tolerance to these diseases.
2.  **Crop Rotation:** Practice a minimum of 2-3 year crop rotation with non-cucurbit crops to reduce pathogen inoculum in the soil.
3.  **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris immediately after harvest to reduce overwintering inoculum.
4.  **Seed Treatment:** Use certified disease-free seeds. Seed treatment with appropriate fungicides can help prevent early seedling infection.
5.  **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to improve air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce humidity and fungal growth.
6.  **Irrigation Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day, as wet foliage for extended periods promotes disease development. Drip irrigation is preferred.
7.  **Weed Control:** Manage weeds effectively as they can act as alternate hosts or impede air circulation.
8.  **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced fertilization to maintain plant vigor, as stressed plants are more susceptible to diseases. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can lead to lush, susceptible growth.

**B. Chemical Control (Fungicides):**

For effective chemical control, it is crucial to apply fungicides preventively or at the very first sign of disease symptoms. Always rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

Here are some CIBRC approved technical chemical names and their recommended dosages for controlling Scab, Canker, and Gummosis in watermelon:

*   **For Scab (*Cladosporium cucumerinum*) and Gummy Stem Blight (*Didymella bryoniae*):**
    *   **Chlorothalonil 75% WP:** Apply at 1.5 - 2.0 kg per acre (or 30-40 g per 15 litres of water).
    *   **Mancozeb 75% WP:** Apply at 1.5 - 2.0 kg per acre (or 30-40 g per 15 litres of water).
    *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:** Apply at 200 ml per acre (or 15-20 ml per 15 litres of water).
    *   **Difenoconazole 25% EC:** Apply at 200 ml per acre (or 10-15 ml per 15 litres of water).
    *   **Tebuconazole 250 EC:** Apply at 300 - 400 ml per acre (or 15-20 ml per 15 litres of water).
    *   **Propineb 70% WP:** Apply at 1.5 - 2.0 kg per acre (or 30-40 g per 15 litres of water).

**Important Considerations for Chemical Application:**
*   Always read and follow the label instructions for specific dosage, application timing, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Ensure thorough coverage of the plant foliage, including the undersides of leaves.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension services for the most current recommendations and disease outbreaks in your specific area.

### Control of Lichen in Watermelon

This is not known to affect Watermelon. Lichens are symbiotic organisms (fungus and alga) that typically grow on inert surfaces like tree bark, rocks, or soil, and are generally indicators of good air quality. They do not parasitize or cause disease in herbaceous plants like watermelon vines or fruit. Therefore, no control measures are required for lichen in watermelon cultivation.
