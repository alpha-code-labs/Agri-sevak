Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding Scale insects and Mealybugs in Watermelon. Both are significant sap-sucking pests that can severely impact yield and fruit quality if not managed effectively. Here's a scientifically verified approach for their control in Haryana:

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Scale Insects and Mealybugs in Watermelon:**

A holistic approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods is most effective for sustainable control.

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Regular Scouting:** Frequently inspect your watermelon plants, especially the undersides of leaves, stems, and fruit calyx, for early signs of infestation.
    *   **Removal of Infested Parts:** Manually remove and destroy heavily infested leaves, stems, or fruits to reduce pest populations.
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the field and surrounding areas free of weeds, as many weeds can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
    *   **Proper Nutrition and Irrigation:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush, soft growth that is more attractive to sap-sucking pests. Ensure balanced nutrition and appropriate irrigation.
    *   **Pruning:** Improve air circulation within the canopy by judicious pruning, which can make the environment less favorable for these pests.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Encourage beneficial insects like ladybird beetles (coccinellids), lacewings, and parasitic wasps, which are natural predators and parasitoids of scale insects and mealybugs. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficials.
    *   **Biopesticides:** Consider using entomopathogenic fungi like *Beauveria bassiana* or *Verticillium lecanii* (now *Lecanicillium lecanii*) during early stages of infestation, especially under high humidity conditions. Follow manufacturer's recommendations for application.

3.  **Chemical Control (Use only when necessary and as a last resort):**
    When infestations are severe and cultural/biological methods are insufficient, chemical intervention may be required. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development. Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and stems where these pests often hide.

    Here are some CIBRC approved technical chemicals effective against Scale insects and Mealybugs in Watermelon:

    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** This is an Insect Growth Regulator (IGR) that interferes with the molting process of nymphs.
        *   Dosage: 1.25 - 1.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:** A systemic insecticide with two-way movement (xylem and phloem), providing excellent control of hidden pests.
        *   Dosage: 0.75 - 1 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** A systemic neonicotinoid insecticide effective against a wide range of sucking pests.
        *   Dosage: 0.5 - 1 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Another systemic neonicotinoid, providing quick knockdown and residual control.
        *   Dosage: 0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water.
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** A systemic neonicotinoid, effective against various sucking pests.
        *   Dosage: 0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water.
    *   **Horticultural Mineral Oil (HMO):** These oils work by suffocating the pests and disrupting their physiological processes. They are particularly effective against early instars and can be used in conjunction with other insecticides or alone for mild infestations.
        *   Dosage: 10 - 20 ml per litre of water. Ensure good coverage.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Spray Coverage:** Both pests are often found in protected areas. Ensure thorough spray coverage, targeting the undersides of leaves, stems, and fruit calyx.
*   **Rotation of Chemicals:** To prevent the development of pesticide resistance, always rotate insecticides with different modes of action. Do not use the same chemical or chemicals from the same group repeatedly.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always observe the specified Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) for each chemical to ensure the safety of the produce. This information is usually provided on the pesticide label.
*   **Safety Precautions:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and application of pesticides. Follow all instructions and safety guidelines on the product label.

By implementing these strategies, you can effectively manage Scale insects and Mealybugs in your watermelon crop and ensure a healthy harvest. For any specific concerns, please consult with your local agricultural extension officer.
