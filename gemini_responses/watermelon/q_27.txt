As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the suitable climate, soil type, and drainage requirements for watermelon cultivation in Haryana:

**1. Climate:**
Watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) is a warm-season crop that thrives in hot and dry conditions.

*   **Temperature:** It requires a long growing season with high temperatures. The optimum temperature range for growth and fruit development is between 25°C and 35°C. Temperatures below 15°C or above 40°C can adversely affect growth, flowering, and fruit set.
*   **Sunshine:** Abundant sunshine is crucial for high sugar content and good fruit quality. Watermelon plants require at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily.
*   **Frost Sensitivity:** Watermelon is highly susceptible to frost. Even light frost can severely damage or kill the plants. Therefore, planting should be done after all danger of frost has passed.
*   **Humidity:** Low to moderate humidity is preferred, as high humidity can increase the incidence of fungal diseases.

**2. Soil Type:**
Watermelon prefers well-drained, fertile soils.

*   **Texture:** Sandy loam to loam soils are ideal. These soils warm up quickly in spring, which is beneficial for early planting and growth. Heavy clay soils are generally unsuitable as they can lead to waterlogging and poor root development.
*   **Organic Matter:** Soils rich in organic matter are preferred as they improve soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability.
*   **pH:** A soil pH range of 6.0 to 7.0 is considered optimal for watermelon cultivation. Slightly acidic to neutral soils are best.

**3. Drainage Requirement:**
Excellent drainage is paramount for successful watermelon cultivation.

*   **Waterlogging:** Watermelon plants are highly sensitive to waterlogging. Standing water or poorly drained conditions can lead to root rot, fungal diseases, and ultimately plant death.
*   **Aeration:** Good soil aeration is essential for healthy root growth and nutrient uptake. Well-drained soils ensure adequate oxygen supply to the roots.
*   **Field Preparation:** In areas prone to poor drainage, planting on raised beds or ridges is highly recommended. This helps to elevate the root zone above potential water accumulation and improves drainage.
*   **Irrigation Management:** While watermelons require consistent moisture, especially during flowering and fruit development, over-irrigation must be avoided to prevent waterlogging.
