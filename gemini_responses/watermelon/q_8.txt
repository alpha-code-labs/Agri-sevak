Namaste, Kisan bhaiyon! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the challenges posed by sucking pests in watermelon cultivation. Effective management is crucial for a healthy crop and good yield.

First, regarding your query about Psylla:
*   **This is not known to affect Watermelon.** Psyllids are generally host-specific and are not considered a common or significant pest of watermelon or other cucurbit crops.

For the control of Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips in Watermelon, an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is highly recommended. This involves a combination of cultural, biological, and chemical methods.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Principles:**

1.  **Monitoring:** Regularly scout your fields (at least twice a week) to detect pest infestations early. Look for pest colonies on the underside of leaves, distorted leaves, honeydew, or sooty mold.
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Weed Management:** Remove weeds from and around the field, as they can serve as alternate hosts for these pests.
    *   **Yellow Sticky Traps:** Install yellow sticky traps (10-15 traps per acre) to monitor pest populations and for mass trapping of whiteflies and winged aphids.
    *   **Reflective Mulches:** Using silver-colored plastic mulches can deter aphids and whiteflies from landing on plants, especially in the early stages.
    *   **Balanced Nutrition:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush, succulent growth that is more attractive to sucking pests.
3.  **Biological Control:** Encourage natural enemies like ladybird beetles, lacewings, hoverfly larvae, and parasitic wasps, which prey on aphids and whiteflies. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

**Chemical Control (When necessary):**
When pest populations reach economic threshold levels, chemical intervention may be required. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance. Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the underside of leaves where these pests often reside.

Here are some CIBRC-approved technical chemical options for controlling sucking pests in watermelon:

**For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips:**

*   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:**
    *   Dose: 125-150 ml per acre (mixed in 200-250 litres of water).
    *   This is a systemic insecticide effective against a broad range of sucking pests.
*   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:**
    *   Dose: 100 g per acre (mixed in 200-250 litres of water).
    *   Another systemic neonicotinoid, effective against aphids, leafhoppers, whiteflies, and thrips.
*   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:**
    *   Dose: 50-100 g per acre (mixed in 200-250 litres of water).
    *   A neonicotinoid with translaminar action, effective against aphids, whiteflies, and thrips.
*   **Dinotefuran 20% SG:**
    *   Dose: 100-125 g per acre (mixed in 200-250 litres of water).
    *   A newer neonicotinoid, effective against a wide range of sucking pests, including those resistant to older neonicotinoids.
*   **Fipronil 5% SC:**
    *   Dose: 600-800 ml per acre (mixed in 200-250 litres of water).
    *   Effective against thrips, aphids, and leafhoppers.

**Specifically for Whiteflies (especially nymphs) and Aphids:**

*   **Buprofezin 25% SC:**
    *   Dose: 500-600 ml per acre (mixed in 200-250 litres of water).
    *   An insect growth regulator (IGR) primarily effective against whitefly nymphs and hoppers, preventing them from molting.
*   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:**
    *   Dose: 200 ml per acre (mixed in 200-250 litres of water).
    *   Effective against whiteflies (all stages) and mites. It has a unique mode of action.
*   **Flonicamid 50% WG:**
    *   Dose: 60 g per acre (mixed in 200-250 litres of water).
    *   A selective insecticide that specifically targets aphids and whiteflies by disrupting their feeding behavior.
*   **Pyriproxyfen 10% EC:**
    *   Dose: 500 ml per acre (mixed in 200-250 litres of water).
    *   An insect growth regulator (IGR) effective against whitefly eggs and nymphs, preventing adult emergence.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Rotation:** Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action (different chemical groups) to prevent the development of resistance in pest populations. For example, do not use Imidacloprid and Thiamethoxam consecutively, as both are neonicotinoids.
*   **Timing:** Apply insecticides when pest populations are low and before they cause significant damage. Early morning or late evening sprays are ideal to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   **Water Volume:** Ensure adequate water volume (200-250 litres per acre) for thorough coverage, especially on the underside of leaves.
*   **Safety:** Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully. Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying. Observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) before harvesting.
