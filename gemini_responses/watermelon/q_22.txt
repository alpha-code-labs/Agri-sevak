Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following cultivation practices for Watermelon in Haryana, based on scientific research and local conditions:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   Watermelon is typically direct-seeded in the field.
    *   Sowing is commonly done on ridges or beds to ensure proper drainage and facilitate irrigation. Seeds are usually sown on one side of the ridge or on both sides, depending on the spacing and irrigation method (furrow irrigation is common).
    *   Alternatively, transplanting 3-4 week old seedlings (raised in nursery trays) can be done, especially for early crops or hybrid varieties, to ensure better stand establishment and uniformity.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   Seeds should be planted at a depth of 2.5 to 3.0 cm. Deeper planting can hinder germination, while shallower planting can expose seeds to birds or desiccation.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   Optimal spacing is crucial for plant growth, fruit development, and yield.
    *   **Row-to-Row:** 2.0 to 3.0 meters
    *   **Plant-to-Plant:** 0.6 to 1.0 meter
    *   A common recommended spacing is 2.5 meters between rows and 0.75 meters between plants within a row. This allows for adequate vine spread and sunlight penetration.

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   For direct seeding, the recommended seed dose is 2.5 to 3.5 kg per acre, depending on the variety (open-pollinated vs. hybrid) and seed size.
    *   If transplanting, the seed requirement will be lower, typically around 0.5 to 1.0 kg per acre, as seeds are sown in nursery trays first.
