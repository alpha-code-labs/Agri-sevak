As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling viral diseases in Watermelon in Haryana.

It is crucial to understand that there is no direct chemical cure for viral diseases once a plant is infected. Control strategies primarily focus on prevention, managing the vectors (insects that transmit the viruses), and cultural practices.

Let's address the specific conditions you mentioned:

1.  **Tristeza:**
    This is not known to affect Watermelon. Citrus Tristeza Virus (CTV) primarily affects citrus species.

2.  **Leaf curl, Mosaic, Yellow vein clearing, Stripe, and Stunt virus:**
    These are common viral symptoms or diseases affecting watermelon in Haryana. They are typically caused by various viruses such as Watermelon Mosaic Virus (WMV), Zucchini Yellow Mosaic Virus (ZYMV), Cucumber Mosaic Virus (CMV), and several whitefly-transmitted geminiviruses (causing leaf curl and yellow vein clearing). "Yellow vein clearing," "Stripe," and "Stunt virus" are often symptoms caused by the aforementioned mosaic or leaf curl viruses rather than distinct viruses themselves.

**Integrated Management Strategy for Viral Diseases in Watermelon:**

Since direct chemical control for viruses is not possible, an integrated approach focusing on prevention and vector management is essential.

**I. Cultural Practices and Prevention:**

*   **Resistant Varieties:** Whenever possible, choose watermelon varieties that are known to be resistant or tolerant to common viral diseases prevalent in your area. Consult with HAU or local agricultural extension for recommended varieties.
*   **Certified Virus-Free Seeds:** Always use certified, high-quality, virus-free seeds to prevent seed-borne transmission.
*   **Vector Control:** This is the most critical aspect. Viruses are primarily transmitted by insect vectors like whiteflies and aphids.
    *   **Whiteflies:** Transmit viruses causing leaf curl and yellow vein clearing.
    *   **Aphids:** Transmit mosaic viruses (WMV, ZYMV, CMV) and can cause stunting.
*   **Weed Management:** Many weeds act as alternative hosts for viruses and their insect vectors. Keep the field and surrounding areas free of weeds.
*   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy (bury or burn) any infected plants immediately upon noticing symptoms to prevent further spread. Do not compost infected plant material.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-cucurbit crops to break the disease cycle.
*   **Physical Barriers:**
    *   Use insect-proof nets or row covers during the early stages of crop growth to protect young seedlings from insect vectors.
    *   Silver reflective mulches can deter aphids and whiteflies, reducing virus incidence.
*   **Timely Planting:** Plant at recommended times to avoid peak vector populations.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure balanced fertilization to promote vigorous plant growth, which can help plants tolerate stress better. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can attract aphids.

**II. Chemical Control for Insect Vectors (Aphids and Whiteflies):**

Chemical control aims to reduce the population of insect vectors, thereby minimizing virus transmission. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development. Apply insecticides when vector populations are low, ideally before significant virus spread.

**For Aphid Control:**

*   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water (foliar spray) or 100-125 ml/acre.
*   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: 0.2-0.4 g/L of water (foliar spray) or 100 g/acre.
*   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP: 0.2-0.4 g/L of water (foliar spray) or 100-125 g/acre.
*   **Flonicamid** 50% WG: 0.3 g/L of water (foliar spray) or 150 g/acre.

**For Whitefly Control:**

*   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water (foliar spray) or 100-125 ml/acre.
*   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: 0.2-0.4 g/L of water (foliar spray) or 100 g/acre.
*   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP: 0.2-0.4 g/L of water (foliar spray) or 100-125 g/acre.
*   **Buprofezin** 25% SC: 1.25-1.5 ml/L of water (foliar spray) or 500-600 ml/acre (targets nymphs).
*   **Spiromesifen** 22.9% SC: 0.5-0.75 ml/L of water (foliar spray) or 200-300 ml/acre.
*   **Diafenthiuron** 50% WP: 0.6-1.0 g/L of water (foliar spray) or 250-300 g/acre.
*   **Pyriproxyfen** 10% EC: 1.0-1.25 ml/L of water (foliar spray) or 400-500 ml/acre (targets nymphs and eggs).

**Important Considerations for Chemical Application:**

*   **Read the Label:** Always read and follow the instructions on the product label for dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   **Timing:** Apply insecticides early in the morning or late in the evening to minimize harm to beneficial insects and pollinators.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough coverage of the plant, especially the undersides of leaves where vectors often reside.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in insect populations.
