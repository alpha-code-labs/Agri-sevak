As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified seed and soil treatment processes for Watermelon cultivation in Haryana to ensure healthy plant establishment and mitigate early-season pest and disease challenges.

### Recommended Seed Treatment for Watermelon

Seed treatment is crucial for protecting young seedlings from soil-borne diseases and early insect pests, leading to better germination and stand establishment.

1.  **Fungicidal Treatment (for protection against damping-off, root rot, and other seed-borne diseases):**
    *   Treat seeds with a combination of systemic and contact fungicides.
    *   **Option 1:**
        *   **Carbendazim** @ 1 gram/kg seed
        *   **Thiram** @ 2 grams/kg seed
    *   **Option 2:**
        *   **Captan** @ 2.5 grams/kg seed
        *   **Metalaxyl-M** (or Mefenoxam) @ 1 gram/kg seed (especially effective against Pythium and Phytophthora)
    *   **Method:** Mix the specified quantity of fungicide(s) thoroughly with the seeds in a plastic bag or container until the seeds are uniformly coated.

2.  **Insecticidal Treatment (for protection against early sucking pests like aphids, thrips, and whiteflies):**
    *   After fungicidal treatment, apply an insecticide.
    *   **Imidacloprid** 70 WS @ 5-7 grams/kg seed
    *   **OR**
    *   **Thiamethoxam** 70 WS @ 3-5 grams/kg seed
    *   **Method:** Apply the insecticide after the fungicide has dried slightly, ensuring uniform coating.

3.  **Bio-fungicidal Treatment (for enhanced protection against soil-borne diseases and promoting plant growth):**
    *   This should ideally be done just before sowing or after chemical treatments.
    *   **Trichoderma viride** (1% WP) @ 4-6 grams/kg seed
    *   **Method:** Prepare a slurry of **Trichoderma viride** with a small amount of water and coat the seeds uniformly. Allow the seeds to air dry in shade before sowing. This step is best done immediately before sowing to maximize the viability of the bio-agent.

**Order of Application:** Chemical Fungicide -> Chemical Insecticide -> Bio-fungicide (just before sowing).

### Recommended Soil Treatment for Watermelon

Soil treatment focuses on managing soil-borne pathogens, nematodes, and improving overall soil health for optimal watermelon growth.

1.  **Incorporation of Organic Matter:**
    *   Before final land preparation, incorporate well-decomposed Farmyard Manure (FYM) or compost @ 10-15 tonnes/acre. This improves soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability, and supports beneficial microbial activity.

2.  **Bio-agent Application (for management of soil-borne diseases and nematodes):**
    *   **For Fungal Diseases (e.g., Fusarium wilt, damping-off):**
        *   **Trichoderma viride** (1% WP) @ 2.5 kg/acre
        *   **Method:** Mix the specified quantity of **Trichoderma viride** with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed FYM or compost. Keep the mixture moist and covered in a shady place for 7-10 days to allow the fungus to multiply. Broadcast this enriched mixture evenly over the field and incorporate it into the soil during the last ploughing, at least 10-15 days before transplanting/sowing.
    *   **For Bacterial Diseases and Plant Growth Promotion:**
        *   **Pseudomonas fluorescens** (1% WP) @ 2.5 kg/acre
        *   **Method:** Similar to **Trichoderma viride**, mix with FYM/compost and apply during land preparation.
    *   **For Nematode Management:**
        *   **Purpureocillium lilacinum** (1% WP) @ 2.5 kg/acre (formerly known as Paecilomyces lilacinus)
        *   **Method:** Mix with 50-100 kg of FYM/compost, allow to multiply, and incorporate into the soil during land preparation, especially in fields with a history of nematode problems.

3.  **Soil Solarization (Non-chemical method):**
    *   **Method:** In hot summer months (May-June), after preparing the field, irrigate it thoroughly. Cover the moist soil with a transparent polyethylene sheet (25-100 micron thickness) and seal the edges with soil. Leave it for 4-6 weeks. This process increases soil temperature, effectively reducing populations of many soil-borne pathogens, nematodes, and weed seeds.

**Note:** Chemical soil treatments (e.g., fumigants, specific nematicides) are generally recommended only when a severe problem (like high nematode infestation) is identified through soil testing, and should be applied strictly as per CIBRC guidelines and expert advice. For general cultivation, biological and cultural methods are preferred for sustainable management.

Always ensure to follow the specific instructions and safety precautions mentioned on the product labels.
