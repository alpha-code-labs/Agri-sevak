As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I must provide scientifically verified advice.

*   **Dieback:** This is not known to affect Watermelon as a specific disease. While general decline or death of plant parts can occur due to various factors (e.g., root rot, stem blight, nutrient deficiency, water stress), "Dieback" is typically a term used for woody plants or as a symptom rather than a specific disease name for herbaceous crops like watermelon.
*   **Twig blight:** This is not known to affect Watermelon. Twig blight is a disease primarily associated with woody plants (trees and shrubs), causing the death of twigs and small branches. Watermelon is a herbaceous vine and does not have "twigs."
*   **Tikka disease:** This is not known to affect Watermelon. Tikka disease is a well-known leaf spot disease primarily affecting groundnut (peanut), caused by *Cercospora arachidicola* and *Phaeoisariopsis personata*. It does not affect watermelon.
