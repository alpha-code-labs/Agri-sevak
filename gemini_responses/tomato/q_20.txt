As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the critical role micronutrients play in achieving optimal tomato yield and quality. Deficiencies, even in small amounts, can severely impact plant health and fruit development.

The most crucial first step is always a **soil test**. This provides a precise diagnosis of which micronutrients are deficient in your specific field, allowing for targeted and efficient application. Visual symptoms can be indicative but are not always conclusive.

Here's how to address common micronutrient deficiencies in tomato, using CIBRC approved technical chemical names and metric units:

### Addressing Specific Micronutrient Deficiencies in Tomato

*   **Zinc (Zn)**
    *   **Role:** Essential for enzyme activity, hormone production, and carbohydrate metabolism.
    *   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, small leaves (little leaf), interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, often with purplish discoloration on the underside of leaves.
    *   **Correction:**
        *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** at 10-25 kg/acre as a basal application, once every 2-3 years, depending on soil test results.
        *   **Foliar Spray:** For quick correction, spray a 0.5% solution of **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (5 g/L of water) along with 0.25% lime (2.5 g/L) to neutralize acidity. Repeat 2-3 times at 10-15 day intervals, starting from 3-4 weeks after transplanting.

*   **Iron (Fe)**
    *   **Role:** Crucial for chlorophyll formation, photosynthesis, and respiration.
    *   **Symptoms:** Pronounced interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, with veins remaining green. In severe cases, entire leaves turn yellow or even white. Common in alkaline soils of Haryana.
    *   **Correction:**
        *   **Foliar Spray (most effective for quick correction):** Spray a 0.2-0.5% solution of **Ferrous sulphate** (2-5 g/L of water) or a 0.1% solution of **Fe-EDTA** (1 g/L of water). Repeat 2-3 times at 7-10 day intervals until symptoms disappear.
        *   **Soil Application (less effective in high pH soils):** Apply **Ferrous sulphate** at 20-40 kg/acre, but its availability can be limited in high pH soils. Chelated iron forms like **Fe-EDTA** or **Fe-DTPA** can be applied at lower rates (e.g., 5-10 kg/acre) if soil test indicates severe deficiency and high pH.

*   **Boron (B)**
    *   **Role:** Essential for cell wall formation, cell division, pollen germination, and fruit development.
    *   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, thickening and brittleness of young leaves, death of growing points, poor fruit set, cracking of fruits, and internal browning.
    *   **Correction:**
        *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Borax (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate)** at 4-8 kg/acre or **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** at 1-2 kg/acre as a basal application.
        *   **Foliar Spray:** Spray a 0.1-0.2% solution of **Borax (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate)** (1-2 g/L of water) or **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (0.5-1 g/L of water) at flowering and fruit set stages. Repeat if necessary.

*   **Calcium (Ca)**
    *   **Role:** Critical for cell wall structure, membrane integrity, and fruit quality. Prevents Blossom End Rot (BER).
    *   **Symptoms:** Blossom End Rot (BER) is the most common symptom, appearing as a water-soaked spot on the blossom end of the fruit, which later turns dark brown/black and leathery. Young leaves may be distorted or stunted.
    *   **Correction:**
        *   **Soil Application/Fertigation:** Ensure adequate soil calcium levels through **Calcium nitrate** (15.5% N, 19% Ca) applied through fertigation or as a side dressing.
        *   **Foliar Spray (for BER prevention):** Spray a 0.5-1% solution of **Calcium chloride** (5-10 g/L of water) or **Calcium nitrate** (5-10 g/L of water) starting from fruit set, every 7-10 days, for 3-4 applications. Ensure good coverage of fruits. *Note: Calcium is not very mobile in the plant, so consistent supply is key.*

*   **Magnesium (Mg)**
    *   **Role:** Central component of chlorophyll, essential for photosynthesis.
    *   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, starting from the leaf margins and progressing inwards, while veins remain green. Leaves may become brittle and curl upwards.
    *   **Correction:**
        *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Magnesium sulphate** at 10-20 kg/acre as a basal application or side dressing.
        *   **Foliar Spray:** Spray a 1-2% solution of **Magnesium sulphate** (10-20 g/L of water). Repeat 2-3 times at 10-15 day intervals.

*   **Manganese (Mn)**
    *   **Role:** Involved in photosynthesis, respiration, and nitrogen metabolism.
    *   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, similar to iron deficiency but often less severe and with a mottled appearance. In severe cases, necrotic spots may develop.
    *   **Correction:**
        *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Manganese sulphate** at 10-20 kg/acre as a basal application.
        *   **Foliar Spray:** Spray a 0.2-0.5% solution of **Manganese sulphate** (2-5 g/L of water). Repeat 2-3 times at 10-15 day intervals.

### Important Considerations for Haryana Farmers:

1.  **Soil pH:** Many Haryana soils are alkaline. This reduces the availability of Zinc, Iron, and Manganese. Managing soil pH through organic matter addition and appropriate fertilizer choices can improve micronutrient availability.
2.  **Organic Matter:** Regular addition of farmyard manure (FYM) or compost improves soil structure, water holding capacity, and micronutrient availability by chelation.
3.  **Water Management:** Erratic watering can exacerbate calcium deficiency (Blossom End Rot). Maintain consistent soil moisture.
4.  **Integrated Nutrient Management (INM):** Combine organic and inorganic sources of nutrients for sustainable soil health and crop productivity.
5.  **Timing:** Foliar sprays are most effective when applied in the early morning or late afternoon to avoid scorching and maximize absorption.
6.  **Compatibility:** When tank-mixing different chemicals for foliar application, always perform a small jar test to check for compatibility.

Always consult with your local HAU Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's soil type and crop history.
