As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Tomato in Haryana.

It is crucial to adopt an Integrated Disease Management (IDM) approach, combining cultural practices with judicious use of fungicides, to ensure sustainable and effective control.

**General Cultural Practices for Fungal Disease Management:**

*   **Use disease-free seeds/seedlings:** Source planting material from reputable suppliers.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting tomatoes or other solanaceous crops (potato, brinjal, chilli) in the same field for at least 2-3 years.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to improve air circulation and reduce humidity within the canopy, which discourages fungal growth.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced fertilizers. Excessive nitrogen can make plants more susceptible to some fungal diseases.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy infected plant debris, weeds, and volunteer plants.
*   **Irrigation Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day. Drip irrigation is preferred. If overhead irrigation is used, do it in the morning to allow foliage to dry quickly.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available and suitable for local conditions, choose disease-resistant or tolerant tomato varieties.

**Specific Control Measures for Fungal Diseases in Tomato:**

**1. Alternaria (Early Blight) and Blight (Early Blight)**
*   **Symptoms:** Characterized by dark, concentric rings (target spots) on older leaves, stems, and sometimes fruits. Severe infection leads to defoliation and reduced yield.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2.5 kg/acre or 2.5-3 g/L water.
    *   **Chlorothalonil** (75% WP) at 1.5-2 kg/acre or 2-2.5 g/L water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC) at 0.5 ml/L water.
    *   **Difenoconazole** (25% EC) at 0.5 ml/L water.

**2. Anthracnose**
*   **Symptoms:** Primarily affects ripe or ripening fruits, causing sunken, circular spots that may develop concentric rings and pinkish-orange spore masses in humid conditions. Can also affect leaves and stems.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2.5 kg/acre or 2.5-3 g/L water.
    *   **Chlorothalonil** (75% WP) at 1.5-2 kg/acre or 2-2.5 g/L water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC) at 0.5 ml/L water.

**3. Blight (Late Blight)**
*   **Symptoms:** Causes large, irregular, water-soaked lesions on leaves, stems, and fruits. A white, downy growth may be visible on the underside of leaves in humid conditions. Rapid blighting and collapse of plants can occur.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2.5 kg/acre or 2.5-3 g/L water (as a preventive spray).
    *   **Chlorothalonil** (75% WP) at 1.5-2 kg/acre or 2-2.5 g/L water (as a preventive spray).
    *   **Cymoxanil + Mancozeb** (8% + 64% WP) at 1.5-2 kg/acre or 2-2.5 g/L water.
    *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride** (72.2% SL) at 2.5 ml/L water.
    *   **Fenamidone + Propamocarb hydrochloride** (10% + 37.5% SC) at 2 ml/L water.

**4. Powdery Mildew and Grey Mildew**
*   **Note:** In Tomato, "Grey Mildew" often refers to Powdery Mildew caused by *Leveillula taurica*.
*   **Symptoms:** White, powdery patches primarily on the upper surface of older leaves, which can spread to stems and fruits. Infected leaves may turn yellow, curl, and drop prematurely.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Sulphur** (80% WP) at 2 kg/acre or 2-3 g/L water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC) at 0.5 ml/L water.
    *   **Difenoconazole** (25% EC) at 0.5 ml/L water.
    *   **Myclobutanil** (10% WP) at 0.4 g/L water.
    *   **Tebuconazole** (25% EC) at 0.75 ml/L water.

**Important Considerations for Chemical Application:**

*   **Read Labels:** Always read and follow the instructions on the fungicide label for correct dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   **Rotation of Fungicides:** To prevent the development of fungicide resistance, rotate fungicides with different modes of action.
*   **Timing:** Apply fungicides preventively or at the very first sign of disease symptoms for best efficacy.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough coverage of the plant foliage, including the undersides of leaves.
*   **Safety:** Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and application.

For specific local recommendations and to confirm the exact disease, it is always advisable to consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts.
