As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified seed and soil treatment processes for Tomato cultivation in Haryana to ensure a healthy start and robust growth, minimizing early disease and pest pressure.

### Seed Treatment Process for Tomato

Seed treatment is crucial for protecting young seedlings from seed-borne and early soil-borne pathogens and pests, leading to better germination and stand establishment.

*   **Purpose:** To protect seeds and emerging seedlings from fungal diseases like damping-off (caused by *Pythium*, *Phytophthora*, *Rhizoctonia*) and early blight (*Alternaria solani*), as well as some bacterial diseases and early insect pests.

*   **Recommendations:**
    *   **For Fungal Diseases:**
        *   Treat seeds with a broad-spectrum fungicide such as **Thiram** at 2-3 g per kg of seed, or **Carbendazim** at 1-2 g per kg of seed.
        *   Alternatively, a combination product like **Carboxin + Thiram** can be used at 2-3 g per kg of seed for enhanced protection against a wider range of seed-borne fungi.
    *   **For Bacterial Diseases (e.g., Bacterial Spot, Canker):**
        *   While chemical seed treatments are less effective against bacterial diseases, biological options can offer some protection. Treat seeds with a bio-agent like **Pseudomonas fluorescens** at 10 g per kg of seed.
        *   *Note: Hot water treatment (50°C for 25-30 minutes) is a highly effective non-chemical method for bacterial disease control, but requires precise temperature control to avoid damaging seeds.*
    *   **For Early Insect Pests (e.g., sucking pests in early stages):**
        *   If early season sucking pest pressure is anticipated, treat seeds with an insecticide like **Imidacloprid** at 5-7 ml per kg of seed.

*   **Application Method:** Mix the recommended quantity of the chemical or bio-agent thoroughly with the seeds in a container or plastic bag until the seeds are uniformly coated. Allow the seeds to dry slightly in the shade before sowing.

### Soil Treatment Process for Tomato

Soil treatment aims to manage soil-borne diseases, nematodes, and insect pests that can severely impact tomato plants throughout their life cycle.

*   **Purpose:** To reduce the inoculum of soil-borne fungal pathogens (e.g., *Fusarium* wilt, *Verticillium* wilt, damping-off), bacterial pathogens (e.g., bacterial wilt), nematodes (e.g., root-knot nematodes), and soil-dwelling insect pests (e.g., cutworms, white grubs).

*   **Recommendations:**
    *   **For Fungal Diseases (Damping-off, Wilt Complex):**
        *   **Cultural Method (Pre-planting):** Soil solarization is highly effective. Cover moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets (100-150 micron thick) for 4-6 weeks during the hot summer months (May-June). This raises soil temperature, killing many pathogens, nematodes, and weed seeds.
        *   **Biological Method (Pre-planting/At Planting):** Incorporate **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum** at 2.5 kg per acre, mixed with 50 kg of well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost, into the soil 7-10 days before transplanting.
        *   **Chemical Method (Drenching at Transplanting/Early Stage):**
            *   For damping-off, drench the soil around the base of seedlings with **Propamocarb hydrochloride** at 2-3 ml per litre of water.
            *   For wilt complex, drench with **Carbendazim** at 1-2 g per litre of water. Repeat if necessary based on disease pressure.
    *   **For Nematodes (Root-Knot Nematodes):**
        *   **Cultural Method (Pre-planting):** Soil solarization (as above) is effective. Deep ploughing during summer can expose nematode eggs to sunlight. Crop rotation with non-host crops (e.g., marigold, maize, sorghum) is also beneficial.
        *   **Biological Method (Pre-planting/At Planting):** Apply **Paecilomyces lilacinus** (a nematophagous fungus) at 2.5 kg per acre, mixed with 50 kg of FYM, and incorporate into the soil before transplanting.
        *   **Chemical Method (Pre-planting/At Planting):**
            *   Apply **Fluopyram** as a soil drench or through drip irrigation at a rate of 0.625-1.25 litres per acre (for 400 SC formulation), depending on the product label and nematode pressure.
            *   Alternatively, incorporate **Fosthiazate** granules at 10-15 kg per acre into the soil before planting.
    *   **For Soil-Borne Insects (Cutworms, White Grubs):**
        *   **Chemical Method (Pre-planting Incorporation):** Incorporate **Fipronil** 0.3% GR at 10-15 kg per acre into the soil during final land preparation.

*   **Application Method:**
    *   **Incorporation:** Mix granular formulations or bio-agents thoroughly into the top 15-20 cm of soil before transplanting.
    *   **Drenching:** Apply liquid formulations around the base of the plants using a watering can or sprayer without a nozzle, ensuring the solution penetrates the root zone.
    *   **Drip Irrigation:** For certain chemicals, application through drip irrigation can ensure uniform distribution in the root zone.

### Important Considerations:

*   **Integrated Pest Management (IPM):** These treatments are components of an IPM strategy. Always combine chemical and biological methods with good cultural practices (crop rotation, sanitation, resistant varieties) for sustainable and effective pest and disease management.
*   **Soil Testing:** Conduct regular soil tests to understand nutrient status and potential pathogen load, which can guide specific treatment decisions.
*   **Safety Precautions:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (gloves, mask, eye protection) when handling chemicals. Follow label instructions strictly for dosage, application, and pre-harvest intervals.
*   **Local Conditions:** While these are general recommendations for Haryana, always consult your local HAU extension specialist for advice tailored to your specific field conditions and the prevailing pest/disease situation.
