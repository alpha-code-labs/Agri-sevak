As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide scientifically verified advice for controlling various rot types in tomato cultivation in Haryana. It's important to understand that many "rot" terms describe symptoms caused by a range of pathogens, primarily fungi, and sometimes bacteria. Effective control relies on an integrated approach combining cultural practices, biological methods, and judicious use of CIBRC-approved chemical fungicides.

Here's a comprehensive guide to managing rot types in tomato:

**I. General Preventive Measures (Applicable to all Rot Types):**

1.  **Crop Rotation:** Implement a 3-4 year crop rotation plan, avoiding solanaceous crops (tomato, potato, brinjal, chilli) in the same field to break the life cycle of soil-borne pathogens.
2.  **Field Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy infected plant debris, weeds, and volunteer plants that can harbor disease-causing organisms.
3.  **Soil Solarization:** During hot summer months, moisten the soil and cover it with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks. This raises soil temperature, effectively reducing the inoculum of many soil-borne pathogens.
4.  **Raised Beds:** Planting tomatoes on raised beds improves drainage, prevents waterlogging, and reduces the incidence of root, stem, and collar rots.
5.  **Proper Irrigation:** Use drip irrigation to deliver water directly to the root zone, keeping foliage dry. Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day, as wet foliage promotes fungal growth. Ensure consistent, but not excessive, soil moisture.
6.  **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced fertilizers. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can lead to lush, succulent growth more susceptible to disease. Ensure adequate calcium for fruit development.
7.  **Resistant Varieties:** Where available and suitable for local conditions, select tomato varieties known to possess resistance or tolerance to common rot-causing pathogens.

**II. Specific Rot Types and Control Measures:**

Many of the listed "rots" (Root, Stem, Foot, Collar, Crown, Neck, Seed, and Seedling rot) are often caused by a complex of soil-borne fungal pathogens such as *Pythium spp.*, *Phytophthora spp.*, *Rhizoctonia solani*, and *Sclerotium rolfsii*. These are often managed with similar strategies. "Black Rot" in tomatoes typically refers to *Alternaria* fruit rot or other dark-lesion fruit rots.

**A. Seed Rot, Seedling Rot (Damping-off), Root Rot, Stem Rot, Foot Rot, Collar Rot, Crown Rot, Neck Rot:**

These are primarily caused by soil-borne fungi and manifest at various stages from seed germination to mature plant.

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Use healthy, certified seeds from reputable sources.
    *   Ensure excellent drainage in nursery beds and the main field.
    *   Avoid overcrowding seedlings in nursery beds to promote air circulation.
    *   Sterilize nursery media (e.g., by solarization or steam) before sowing.

2.  **Chemical Control:**

    *   **Seed Treatment (for Seed Rot & Seedling Rot prevention):**
        *   Treat seeds with **Thiram** at 2-3 g/kg seed.
        *   Alternatively, use **Captan** at 2-2.5 g/kg seed.
        *   For specific control of *Pythium* and *Phytophthora*, treat seeds with **Metalaxyl-M** at 1-2 ml/kg seed or a combination product containing **Metalaxyl-M + Difenoconazole** as per label recommendations.
        *   For *Rhizoctonia* and *Sclerotium*, **Carbendazim** at 1-2 g/kg seed can be used.

    *   **Nursery Drench / Soil Drench (for Seedling, Root, Stem, Collar, Foot, Crown, Neck Rots):**
        *   Drench nursery beds or planting pits with a solution of **Propamocarb hydrochloride** at 2-3 ml/L water.
        *   Alternatively, use **Metalaxyl-M + Mancozeb** at 2-2.5 g/L water.
        *   For *Rhizoctonia* and *Sclerotium* control, **Validamycin** at 2-3 ml/L water can be used as a drench.
        *   Apply 2-3 L of the solution per square meter of nursery bed or 100-200 ml per plant in the field, depending on plant size. Repeat if necessary, especially after transplanting or during periods conducive to disease.

**B. Fruit Rot (including Black Rot, Anthracnose, Phytophthora Fruit Rot):**

Fruit rots can be caused by various fungi such as *Alternaria spp.* (often leading to dark, sunken lesions, sometimes referred to as "Black Rot"), *Colletotrichum spp.* (Anthracnose), and *Phytophthora spp.*

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Stake or trellis tomato plants to keep fruits off the ground, reducing contact with soil-borne pathogens.
    *   Ensure good air circulation within the plant canopy through proper spacing and judicious pruning of lower leaves.
    *   Harvest fruits promptly at the appropriate stage of maturity and avoid leaving overripe or damaged fruits on the plant.
    *   Handle fruits carefully during harvest, sorting, and packing to prevent physical injuries that can serve as entry points for pathogens.

2.  **Chemical Control (Foliar Sprays):**
    *   Initiate foliar sprays at fruit set or at the first sign of disease symptoms, and repeat at 7-10 day intervals, especially during periods of high humidity or rainfall.
    *   For broad-spectrum control of fungal fruit rots:
        *   **Mancozeb** at 2-2.5 g/L water.
        *   **Chlorothalonil** at 2 g/L water.
        *   **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5-1 ml/L water.
        *   **Pyraclostrobin + Metiram** at 2-2.5 g/L water.
        *   For *Phytophthora* fruit rot, **Metalaxyl-M + Mancozeb** at 2-2.5 g/L water or **Fosetyl-aluminium** at 2-3 g/L water.
        *   For *Alternaria* (often referred to as "Black Rot" due to dark lesions) and *Colletotrichum* (Anthracnose), **Difenoconazole** at 0.5 ml/L water or **Propiconazole** at 0.5 ml/L water can be effective.
        *   **Copper oxychloride** at 2.5-3 g/L water can also be used for general fungal and some bacterial issues.

**III. Important Distinction: Blossom End Rot**

Blossom End Rot is a physiological disorder, not a disease caused by a pathogen. It manifests as a dark, sunken, leathery spot on the blossom end of the fruit. It is primarily caused by a localized calcium deficiency in the fruit, often exacerbated by inconsistent watering, rapid plant growth, or high soil salinity.

*   **Control:** Ensure consistent soil moisture by regular and adequate irrigation. Avoid extreme fluctuations between dry and wet soil conditions. Maintain proper soil pH (6.0-6.8) for optimal nutrient uptake. Ensure adequate calcium availability in the soil. Foliar sprays of calcium chloride (e.g., 4-5 g/L water) can provide temporary relief, but addressing soil moisture management and root health is crucial for long-term prevention.

**IV. Black Rot (Specific to Crucifers):**

The term "Black Rot" is specifically used for a bacterial disease caused by *Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris*, which primarily affects cruciferous crops such as cabbage, cauliflower, and broccoli.

*   **This is not known to affect Tomato.** (However, as noted above, *Alternaria* fruit rot in tomato can cause dark, blackish lesions and may be colloquially referred to as "black rot" by farmers. The control measures for *Alternaria* fruit rot are covered under "Fruit Rot" above.)

Always refer to the specific product label for precise dosage, application instructions, and safety precautions. For persistent or severe disease issues, it is advisable to obtain a confirmed diagnosis from a plant pathology laboratory.
