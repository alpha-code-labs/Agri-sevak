Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm that Scale insects and Mealybugs are significant sap-sucking pests that can severely affect tomato crops in Haryana, leading to stunted growth, yellowing, wilting, and reduced yield due to their feeding and the honeydew they excrete, which promotes sooty mold.

Effective control requires an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Scale Insects and Mealybugs in Tomato:**

1.  **Cultural Control:**
    *   **Regular Scouting:** Frequently inspect plants, especially the undersides of leaves and stem joints, for early signs of infestation.
    *   **Pruning:** For localized and minor infestations, prune and destroy infested leaves, stems, or branches to prevent spread.
    *   **Field Hygiene:** Remove weeds and crop residues that can harbor pests.
    *   **Avoid Excessive Nitrogen:** High nitrogen fertilization can lead to lush, succulent growth that is more attractive to sap-sucking pests.
    *   **Water Sprays:** For very minor infestations, a strong jet of water can dislodge some pests.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Encourage beneficial insects like ladybird beetles, lacewings, and parasitic wasps (e.g., *Anagyrus* spp. for mealybugs, *Encarsia* spp. for scales) which prey on or parasitize these pests. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficials.

3.  **Chemical Control:**
    When infestations are severe and other methods are insufficient, judicious use of CIBRC-approved insecticides is necessary. Ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and stem crevices where these pests often hide. Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

    For effective control of Scale insects and Mealybugs in Tomato, consider the following CIBRC-approved technical chemicals:

    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at a rate of **1.25 - 1.5 ml per litre of water**. This is an Insect Growth Regulator (IGR) that primarily affects the nymphal stages by inhibiting chitin synthesis, preventing them from molting.
    *   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:** Apply at a rate of **0.6 - 0.75 ml per litre of water**. This is a systemic insecticide with two-way movement (xylem and phloem), providing excellent control of sap-sucking pests, including hidden ones.
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at a rate of **0.5 - 0.75 ml per litre of water**. This is a systemic neonicotinoid insecticide that provides good control against a wide range of sap-sucking insects.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Spray Coverage:** Ensure complete coverage of the plant, especially the undersides of leaves and stem junctions, as these pests are often hidden.
*   **Timing:** Early detection and intervention are crucial for effective control.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) and follow the instructions and safety precautions mentioned on the insecticide label.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Adhere strictly to the Pre-Harvest Interval specified on the product label to ensure the safety of the produce.

By implementing these strategies, you can effectively manage Scale insects and Mealybugs in your tomato crop.
