As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Tomato cultivation in Haryana:

### 1. Grasshopper

*   **Nature of Damage:** Grasshoppers are polyphagous pests that feed on leaves, stems, and sometimes fruits, causing defoliation and damage to young plants.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Cultural Control:** Regular field monitoring, hand-picking for small infestations, and maintaining field sanitation to remove weeds that can serve as alternate hosts.
    *   **Chemical Control:** For significant infestations, the following CIBRC approved insecticides can be used:
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** Apply at 0.5 ml per litre of water (or 100-125 ml per acre, depending on spray volume).
        *   **Malathion 50% EC:** Apply at 2 ml per litre of water (or 400-500 ml per acre, depending on spray volume).
        *   Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.

### 2. Painted bug

*   This is not known to affect Tomato. Painted bugs (Bagrada hilaris/cruciferarum) are primarily pests of cruciferous crops like mustard, cabbage, and cauliflower.

### 3. Red cotton bug

*   This is not known to affect Tomato. Red cotton bugs (Dysdercus cingulatus) are primarily pests of cotton and other malvaceous plants.

### 4. Black ants

*   **Nature of Damage:** Black ants are generally not direct pests of tomato plants. However, they can be problematic as they often 'farm' honeydew-producing insects like aphids, mealybugs, and whiteflies, protecting them from natural enemies. They can also disturb roots by nesting in the soil.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Indirect Control:** The most effective strategy is to control the honeydew-producing pests (aphids, mealybugs, whiteflies) that the ants are tending. Once their food source is eliminated, the ants will disperse.
    *   **Direct Control (if necessary for nuisance or root disturbance):**
        *   **Fipronil 0.3% GR:** Apply 5-10 kg per acre as a broadcast application or directly around ant nests.
        *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC:** For drenching ant nests or as a perimeter spray, use 2.5 ml per litre of water. Apply directly to visible nests or ant trails.
        *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Can be used as a drench around nests at 0.5 ml per litre of water. This also provides systemic protection against sucking pests.
