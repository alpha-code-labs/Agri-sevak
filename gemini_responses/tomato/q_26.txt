As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I am pleased to provide scientifically verified information on specialized practices for tomato cultivation, crucial for maximizing yield and quality in Haryana.

Here is information on Pruning, Desuckering, Mulching, Grafting, and Pollination in Tomato:

### 1. Pruning

Pruning involves the removal of specific plant parts to manage growth, improve fruit quality, and enhance productivity. The approach varies significantly between indeterminate and determinate tomato varieties.

*   **Purpose:**
    *   Direct plant energy towards fruit development, leading to larger, more uniform fruits.
    *   Improve air circulation within the canopy, reducing humidity and the incidence of fungal diseases.
    *   Facilitate pest management and harvesting.
    *   Control plant size and shape, especially important in protected cultivation.
*   **Methods:**
    *   **Indeterminate Varieties:** These varieties continue to grow and produce flowers and fruits throughout the season. Pruning is essential.
        *   **Single Stem Pruning:** All suckers (side shoots emerging from leaf axils) are removed, allowing only the main stem to grow. This results in earlier harvests and larger fruits but potentially lower total yield per plant. Plant density can be increased.
        *   **Double Stem Pruning:** One strong sucker, typically the one immediately below the first flower cluster, is allowed to grow alongside the main stem. All other suckers are removed. This balances yield and fruit size.
        *   **Multiple Stem Pruning (3-4 stems):** More suckers are allowed to develop. This can lead to higher total yields but often smaller fruits and later maturity.
    *   **Determinate Varieties:** These varieties grow to a certain size, set fruit, and then stop growing. They generally require minimal pruning, primarily the removal of diseased, damaged, or yellowing leaves to improve air circulation and plant health. Excessive pruning can reduce yield.
*   **Technique:** Suckers should be removed when they are small (5-10 cm long) by pinching them off with fingers or using clean, sharp pruning shears. Avoid tearing the main stem.
*   **Timing:** Regular pruning (weekly or bi-weekly) is necessary for indeterminate varieties throughout the growing season.

### 2. Desuckering

Desuckering is the specific practice of removing the side shoots, or "suckers," that develop in the leaf axils of the main stem. It is an integral part of the overall pruning strategy.

*   **Purpose:**
    *   Direct the plant's energy and nutrients primarily to the main stem and developing fruits, rather than vegetative growth.
    *   Maintain the desired plant architecture (e.g., single or double stem) established during pruning.
    *   Improve light penetration and air circulation within the plant canopy, which helps in reducing disease pressure.
*   **Method:** Suckers are best removed when they are young and tender, typically 5-10 cm in length. They can be easily pinched off by hand. If suckers become too large and woody, use clean pruning shears to avoid damaging the main stem.
*   **Frequency:** Desuckering should be done regularly, usually once a week, to prevent suckers from growing too large, which can create larger wounds and stress the plant.

### 3. Mulching

Mulching involves covering the soil surface around tomato plants with a layer of material. This practice offers numerous benefits for soil health and plant growth.

*   **Purpose:**
    *   **Weed Suppression:** Reduces weed growth by blocking sunlight, thereby minimizing competition for water and nutrients.
    *   **Moisture Conservation:** Reduces evaporation from the soil surface, leading to more efficient water use and fewer irrigation cycles.
    *   **Soil Temperature Regulation:** Organic mulches help keep the soil cooler in hot weather and warmer in cold weather. Black plastic mulches can warm the soil, beneficial for early season growth, while reflective mulches can cool the soil.
    *   **Soil Splash Reduction:** Prevents soil particles from splashing onto lower leaves and fruits during irrigation or rain, which reduces the spread of soil-borne diseases and keeps fruits clean.
    *   **Soil Health Improvement:** Organic mulches decompose over time, adding organic matter and nutrients to the soil, improving its structure and fertility.
*   **Types:**
    *   **Organic Mulches:** Readily available materials in Haryana include paddy straw, wheat straw, sugarcane trash, dry leaves, and compost. Apply a layer of 5-10 cm thickness around the plants.
    *   **Inorganic Mulches:** Plastic mulches are widely used.
        *   **Black Plastic Mulch:** Effectively warms the soil, suppresses weeds, and conserves moisture. Ideal for early season planting.
        *   **Silver/White Plastic Mulch:** Reflects sunlight, helping to keep the soil cooler in hot climates, and can deter some insect pests.
*   **Application:** Mulch should be applied after transplanting when the plants are established. For plastic mulches, lay the film before transplanting and make holes for the plants.

### 4. Grafting

Grafting in tomatoes involves joining a desired tomato variety (scion) onto the root system of another plant (rootstock) that possesses advantageous traits.

*   **Purpose:**
    *   **Disease Resistance:** The primary reason for grafting is to impart resistance to soil-borne diseases such as Bacterial Wilt, Fusarium Wilt, Verticillium Wilt, and Nematodes, which are significant challenges in intensive cultivation areas of Haryana.
    *   **Increased Vigor and Yield:** Grafted plants often exhibit enhanced vigor, leading to stronger growth and higher yields, especially under stressful conditions.
    *   **Tolerance to Abiotic Stresses:** Rootstocks can provide tolerance to adverse soil conditions like salinity, waterlogging, and extreme temperatures.
    *   **Extended Production Period:** Grafted plants tend to have a longer productive life.
*   **Rootstocks:** Specialized rootstock varieties, often interspecific hybrids (e.g., *Solanum lycopersicum* x *Solanum habrochaites* or *Solanum torvum*), are used for their specific resistance profiles.
*   **Methods:** Common grafting methods for tomatoes include splice grafting (also known as top-grafting or tube grafting) and cleft grafting. Splice grafting is widely adopted due to its simplicity and high success rate.
*   **Procedure:**
    *   Select healthy rootstock and scion seedlings of similar stem diameter.
    *   Make precise, angled cuts on both the rootstock and scion.
    *   Join the cut surfaces and secure them with grafting clips.
    *   Place the grafted plants in a high-humidity healing chamber (e.g., a mist chamber or covered tunnel) for 7-10 days to allow the graft union to form.
*   **Relevance for Haryana:** Grafting is becoming an increasingly important practice, particularly for protected cultivation and in areas with high disease pressure, to ensure sustainable tomato production.

### 5. Pollination

Pollination is the transfer of pollen from the anther to the stigma, a crucial step for fruit set in tomatoes. Tomatoes are primarily self-pollinating, meaning each flower contains both male and female reproductive organs.

*   **Mechanism:** Tomato flowers are typically perfect (hermaphroditic). Pollen is released from the anthers and falls onto the stigma of the same flower. Natural vibrations from wind or insects aid in pollen release and transfer.
*   **Factors Affecting Pollination and Fruit Set:**
    *   **Temperature:** Optimal temperatures for pollination and fruit set are between 20-28°C. Temperatures consistently above 35°C or below 10°C can lead to poor pollen viability, reduced stigma receptivity, and consequently, poor fruit set.
    *   **Humidity:** Very high humidity can make pollen sticky, hindering its release, while very low humidity can dry out the stigma, making it unreceptive.
    *   **Wind/Vibration:** Even though tomatoes are self-pollinating, some physical agitation (like gentle wind) is necessary to dislodge pollen from the anthers and ensure it lands on the stigma.
    *   **Nutrient Status:** Deficiencies in certain micronutrients, particularly Boron, can impair pollen viability and fruit development.
*   **Assisted Pollination (especially in Protected Cultivation):** In polyhouses or net houses where natural wind is limited, assisted pollination may be required.
    *   **Manual Vibration:** Gently tapping the flower clusters or the supporting wires of the plants can help release pollen. This is often done daily during peak flowering.
    *   **Electric Vibrators:** Specialized handheld electric vibrators can be used to efficiently shake the flowers and promote pollen release.
    *   **Bumblebees:** While not common in open fields in Haryana, bumblebees are highly effective pollinators in protected cultivation environments globally.
*   **Hormonal Sprays:** In some cases, plant growth regulators (PGRs) containing auxins (e.g., 4-CPA or NAA) are used to induce fruit set, especially under adverse environmental conditions. However, their use should be judicious, as excessive application can lead to misshapen or hollow fruits. Always ensure any chemical used is **CIBRC approved** and applied as per recommended dosages. For example, **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA)** at very low concentrations (e.g., 5-10 ppm) can be used, but it's generally recommended to optimize environmental conditions and physical methods first.

These specialized practices, when implemented correctly, can significantly enhance the productivity and profitability of tomato cultivation in Haryana.
