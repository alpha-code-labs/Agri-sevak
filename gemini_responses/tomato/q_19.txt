Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice on addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium) in Tomato plants, keeping in mind the conditions prevalent in Haryana.

Macro-nutrients are essential for healthy growth, yield, and quality of tomatoes. The first and most crucial step in addressing any nutrient deficiency is to conduct a soil test. This will provide precise information on the nutrient status of your soil and help in formulating an accurate fertilization plan.

Here's how to address deficiencies of Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium:

### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

Nitrogen is vital for vegetative growth, leaf development, and chlorophyll production.

*   **Symptoms:**
    *   General yellowing (chlorosis) of older leaves, starting from the tips and progressing inwards.
    *   Stunted plant growth with thin, spindly stems.
    *   Reduced fruit set and smaller fruits.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Soil Application:** For immediate correction, a top-dressing can be applied.
        *   Apply 20-30 kg of **Urea** (46% N) per acre, broadcast evenly and lightly incorporated into the soil, followed by irrigation.
        *   Alternatively, **Calcium Ammonium Nitrate (CAN)** (25% N) can be used at 40-60 kg per acre.
    *   **Foliar Application (for quick, temporary relief):**
        *   Spray a 1-2% solution of **Urea** (10-20 g of **Urea** per litre of water) on the foliage. Repeat after 7-10 days if symptoms persist. Ensure complete coverage of leaves.

### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

Phosphorus is crucial for root development, flowering, fruit set, and energy transfer within the plant.

*   **Symptoms:**
    *   Dark green to purplish discoloration of leaves, especially on the undersides and petioles, particularly on older leaves.
    *   Stunted growth and poor root development.
    *   Delayed flowering and maturity, with reduced fruit set.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Soil Application (Phosphorus is less mobile in soil, so basal application is best, but for correction):**
        *   Apply 50-75 kg of **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5) per acre, incorporated into the soil near the root zone, followed by irrigation.
        *   Alternatively, 150-200 kg of **Single Superphosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5) per acre can be used.
    *   **Foliar Application (less effective for P, but can provide temporary relief):**
        *   Spray a 0.5-1% solution of **Monoammonium Phosphate (MAP)** (12% N, 61% P2O5) (5-10 g of **MAP** per litre of water).

### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency

Potassium (Potash) is essential for fruit development, quality, disease resistance, and water regulation.

*   **Symptoms:**
    *   Yellowing and browning (scorching) of leaf margins, particularly on older leaves, while the inner part of the leaf remains green.
    *   Weak stems and poor fruit development.
    *   Uneven ripening, blotchy ripening, and poor fruit quality.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   Apply 30-50 kg of **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** (60% K2O) per acre, incorporated into the soil near the root zone, followed by irrigation.
        *   Alternatively, 40-60 kg of **Sulphate of Potash (SOP)** (50% K2O) per acre can be used, especially if sulphur is also deficient or if chloride sensitivity is a concern.
    *   **Foliar Application (for quick relief):**
        *   Spray a 1-2% solution of **Potassium Nitrate** (13% N, 45% K2O) (10-20 g of **Potassium Nitrate** per litre of water).
        *   Alternatively, a 1% solution of **Sulphate of Potash** (10 g of **Sulphate of Potash** per litre of water) can be used. Repeat after 7-10 days if symptoms persist.

### General Recommendations:

*   **Soil Testing:** Always start with a comprehensive soil test to determine the exact nutrient status and avoid over-application, which can lead to nutrient imbalances or environmental issues. HAU provides soil testing services.
*   **Balanced Fertilization:** While addressing specific deficiencies, ensure a balanced nutrient supply to the plants.
*   **Split Applications:** For Nitrogen and Potassium, split applications are generally more effective than a single large dose, as it reduces leaching losses and ensures continuous availability to the plant.
*   **Irrigation:** Always ensure adequate irrigation after applying fertilizers to the soil to help dissolve the nutrients and make them available to the roots.
*   **Timing:** Apply fertilizers when the plants are actively growing and can utilize the nutrients efficiently.
*   **Observation:** Regularly monitor your tomato plants for any signs of nutrient stress and adjust your fertilization program accordingly.
