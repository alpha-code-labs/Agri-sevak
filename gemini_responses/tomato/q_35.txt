Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I am pleased to provide you with scientifically verified advice on the correct maturity signs, harvesting time, and cutting process for Tomato cultivation in Haryana.

### Maturity Signs for Tomato

The maturity of tomatoes is primarily judged by their colour, firmness, and the intended market.

*   **Colour Change:** This is the most reliable indicator. Tomatoes progress through several colour stages:
    *   **Green Mature:** Fully grown but still green. The internal jelly-like substance (locular gel) has formed. This stage is generally too early for harvest unless specifically for processing that requires green tomatoes.
    *   **Breaker Stage:** The first blush of colour (pink or yellow) appears on less than 10% of the fruit surface. This is the ideal stage for harvesting if the tomatoes are to be transported to distant markets or stored for a few days, as they will continue to ripen off the vine.
    *   **Pink Stage:** 10% to 30% of the fruit surface shows pink or red colour. Suitable for slightly less distant markets.
    *   **Light Red Stage:** 30% to 60% of the fruit surface shows red colour. Good for local markets.
    *   **Red Ripe Stage:** More than 90% of the fruit surface is red. This stage offers the best flavour and quality for immediate consumption or very local markets.
*   **Firmness:** Ripe tomatoes should be firm but yield slightly to gentle pressure. Over-ripe tomatoes will be soft and mushy.
*   **Glossiness:** The skin of a mature tomato often develops a slight sheen or gloss.
*   **Size:** The fruit should have reached its characteristic size for the specific variety being grown.

### Harvesting Time for Tomato

The optimal harvesting time depends on the intended use and market destination.

*   **Time of Day:** Harvest tomatoes in the early morning after the dew has dried, but before the heat of the day sets in. This helps to reduce field heat in the fruit, which is crucial for maintaining quality and extending shelf life.
*   **Frequency:** Harvesting should be done regularly, typically every 2-3 days, or up to once a week, depending on the variety, temperature, and ripening rate. This ensures that fruits are picked at their optimal maturity stage and encourages the plant to produce more fruit.
*   **Market Destination:**
    *   **Distant Markets/Storage:** Harvest at the **Breaker Stage** or **Pink Stage**. This allows the fruit to ripen during transit and storage, reaching the consumer in good condition.
    *   **Local Markets/Immediate Consumption:** Harvest at the **Light Red** or **Red Ripe Stage** for superior flavour and quality.

### Cutting Process for Tomato

Proper harvesting technique is essential to prevent damage to the fruit and the plant, thereby reducing post-harvest losses.

*   **Hand Harvesting:** Tomatoes are typically harvested by hand.
*   **Stem Attachment:**
    *   For most varieties and market conditions, it is recommended to harvest the fruit with the **calyx (the green leafy part at the stem end) and a short piece of the stem (pedicel)** attached. This prevents the stem end from being damaged or punctured, which can lead to rapid spoilage and disease entry.
    *   Carefully twist or snap the fruit from the vine, ensuring the stem and calyx remain intact with the fruit.
*   **Tools (Optional):** For some varieties or if the stems are particularly tough, a sharp, clean knife or pruning shears can be used to cut the stem just above the calyx. Ensure tools are disinfected regularly to prevent disease transmission.
*   **Gentle Handling:** Always handle tomatoes gently to avoid bruising, cuts, or punctures. Place the harvested fruits carefully into clean, shallow containers to prevent crushing. Avoid throwing or dropping them.
*   **Avoid Damaging the Plant:** Be careful not to damage the main stem or branches of the tomato plant during harvesting, as this can reduce future yields.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure a high-quality tomato harvest, leading to better market prices and reduced post-harvest losses.
