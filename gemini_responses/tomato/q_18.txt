As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified recommendations for the use of growth regulators and micronutrients in Tomato cultivation in Haryana:

### 1. **Ethephon** (for uniform ripening)

*   **Purpose:** To promote uniform ripening and enhance the red colour of tomato fruits, especially for harvesting in a single pick or for processing.
*   **Recommended Dose:**
    *   For **Ethephon** (39% SL formulation): 1.0 - 1.5 ml per litre of water.
*   **Application:** Spray thoroughly on the foliage and fruits when the fruits are at the mature green to breaker stage (when they just begin to show a colour change from green to light yellow/pink). Ensure good coverage.

### 2. **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid** (2,4-D)

*   **Purpose:** At extremely low concentrations, **2,4-D** can act as a synthetic auxin to induce parthenocarpy (seedless fruit development) and improve fruit size.
*   **HAU Recommendation:** As a Senior Agronomist, I must strongly advise that the use of **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid** as a growth regulator in tomato is **not generally recommended** for farmers. This is due to its extremely narrow margin of safety. Even a slight overdose can lead to severe phytotoxicity, malformed fruits, flower drop, and significant yield reduction. **2,4-D** is primarily a herbicide, and its application as a growth regulator requires precise measurement and expert supervision, which is often impractical and risky for general field use by farmers. Therefore, HAU does not advocate its routine use for this purpose in tomato.

### 3. **Boron** (as a micronutrient)

*   **Purpose:** Boron is an essential micronutrient critical for pollen germination, fertilization, fruit set, cell wall formation, and sugar transport. Its deficiency can lead to poor fruit set, fruit cracking, and hollow fruits.
*   **Recommended Dose:**
    *   For **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate, containing 11% Boron): 1.5 - 2.0 g per litre of water.
*   **Application:** Apply as a foliar spray.
    *   The first spray should be given at the onset of flowering.
    *   A second spray can be applied 10-15 days after the first, during the early fruit setting stage, to ensure continuous availability of Boron for developing fruits.
    *   Ensure thorough coverage of the plant foliage.
