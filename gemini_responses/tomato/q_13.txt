As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in Tomato in Haryana:

### Control of Fruit Fly in Tomato

Fruit flies, primarily species like *Bactrocera cucurbitae* (Melon fruit fly) and *Bactrocera dorsalis* (Oriental fruit fly), can be a significant pest of tomato, causing damage to developing and ripening fruits.

**Symptoms:**
*   Small puncture marks on the fruit surface where the female fly lays eggs.
*   Softening and rotting of the fruit, often due to secondary bacterial or fungal infections.
*   Presence of creamy-white maggots feeding inside the fruit pulp.
*   Premature fruit drop.

**Control Measures:**

1.  **Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Regularly collect and destroy all fallen, damaged, or infested fruits by burying them deep in the soil or burning them. This breaks the pest's life cycle.
    *   **Deep Ploughing:** After harvest, deep ploughing helps expose and kill pupae present in the soil.
    *   **Pheromone Traps:** Install fruit fly pheromone traps (e.g., Methyl Eugenol traps for *B. dorsalis* or Cue-lure traps for *B. cucurbitae*) at a density of 4-5 traps per acre. These traps attract and kill male flies, reducing the breeding population.
    *   **Protein Bait Traps:** Prepare bait by mixing 100 g of jaggery or molasses with 10 ml of **Malathion 50% EC** in 1 litre of water. Place this mixture in wide-mouthed bottles or plastic containers with small holes and hang them in the field at 4-5 traps per acre.

2.  **Chemical Control (Use as part of an Integrated Pest Management strategy):**
    *   **Bait Spray:** Prepare a bait spray by mixing **Malathion 50% EC** at 2 ml/L of water with 10 g/L of jaggery or molasses. Apply this mixture as spot sprays on the foliage (not directly on fruits) in the evening, targeting only a few leaves per plant. This attracts and kills adult flies.
    *   **Foliar Sprays:**
        *   **Spinosad 45% SC** at 0.3 ml/L of water.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC** at 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage and developing fruits. Always observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) mentioned on the product label before harvesting.

### Control of Ber Fly in Tomato

This is not known to affect Tomato. The Ber fly (*Carpomyia vesuviana*) is a highly specific pest of Ber (*Ziziphus mauritiana*) and does not infest tomato plants.
