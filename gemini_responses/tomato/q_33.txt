As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an Integrated Weed Management (IWM) approach for effective and sustainable control of weeds in tomato fields. This combines cultural, mechanical, and judicious chemical methods.

### I. Cultural and Mechanical Methods (Foundation of IWM)

1.  **Thorough Land Preparation:** Deep ploughing and harrowing before transplanting can bury weed seeds and expose rhizomes to desiccation.
2.  **Use of Healthy Seedlings:** Transplanting healthy, vigorous seedlings gives the tomato crop a competitive advantage over weeds.
3.  **Optimum Spacing:** Maintaining recommended plant spacing allows for better crop canopy development, shading out weeds, and facilitates inter-cultivation.
4.  **Mulching:** Applying organic mulches (e.g., straw, dry leaves) or plastic mulches can significantly suppress weed growth, conserve moisture, and regulate soil temperature.
5.  **Hand Weeding/Inter-cultivation:** This remains one of the most effective methods, especially for broadleaf weeds and parasitic weeds.
    *   Perform 2-3 hand weedings/hoeings, typically at 20-25, 40-45, and 60-65 days after transplanting, depending on weed pressure.
    *   For **Amarbail (Cuscuta)** and **Orobanche**, manual removal before they set seed is critical to prevent future infestations. Remove affected tomato plants or parts carefully and destroy them away from the field.
6.  **Crop Rotation:** Rotate tomato with non-host crops or crops that allow for different weed control strategies to break weed cycles.

### II. Chemical Control

Herbicides should be used as a supplement to cultural and mechanical methods. Always ensure uniform spray coverage and use the recommended water volume (typically 300-500 litres per acre).

#### A. Pre-emergence Herbicides (Applied after transplanting/sowing but before weed emergence)

These herbicides provide broad-spectrum control of germinating annual broadleaf and narrow leaf weeds.

*   **For Broad leaf weeds (e.g., Bathu, Congress grass), Narrow leaf weeds (e.g., Phalaris minor), and some suppression of Amarbail:**
    *   **Pendimethalin** 30% EC: Apply 1.0 - 1.25 litres per acre within 3 days of transplanting or sowing.
    *   **Fluchloralin** 45% EC: Apply 0.8 litres per acre as a pre-plant incorporation (PPI) herbicide, mixing it into the top 5-7 cm of soil before transplanting.
    *   **Metribuzin** 70% WP: Apply 140 - 200 grams per acre as pre-emergence. *Caution: Tomato varieties can vary in sensitivity to Metribuzin. Test on a small area first.*

#### B. Post-emergence Herbicides (Applied after weed and crop emergence)

These are generally more specific.

*   **For Narrow leaf weeds (Grasses, including Phalaris minor):**
    *   **Quizalofop-ethyl** 5% EC: Apply 0.4 - 0.6 litres per acre when grassy weeds are at the 2-4 leaf stage.
    *   **Fenoxaprop-p-ethyl** 9% EC: Apply 0.2 - 0.27 litres per acre when grassy weeds are at the 2-4 leaf stage.
    *   **Fluazifop-p-butyl** 25% EC: Apply 0.2 - 0.4 litres per acre when grassy weeds are at the 2-4 leaf stage.
    *   *Note: These herbicides are selective for grasses and will not control broadleaf weeds.*

*   **For Broad leaf weeds (e.g., Bathu, Congress grass):**
    *   Chemical control of broadleaf weeds post-emergence in tomato is very challenging due to the broadleaf nature of the tomato crop itself.
    *   **Hand weeding is the most recommended and safest method for post-emergence broadleaf weed control.**
    *   While **Metribuzin** can be used at very low rates (e.g., 70-100 grams per acre) as early post-emergence, it carries a high risk of phytotoxicity to tomato and is generally not recommended as a primary post-emergence broadleaf control in Haryana due to the risk of crop damage.

*   **For Amarbail (Cuscuta spp.):**
    *   Once Amarbail has attached to the tomato plant, chemical control without harming the tomato is extremely difficult.
    *   **Pre-emergence control with Pendimethalin** (as mentioned above) can help suppress germination.
    *   **Manual removal** (hand pulling or cutting affected parts) is the most effective post-emergence method. Ensure complete removal before it flowers and sets seeds.

*   **For Orobanche (Broomrape):**
    *   Orobanche is a parasitic weed that attaches to the roots of tomato.
    *   **Chemical control of Orobanche in tomato is extremely difficult and often ineffective or phytotoxic to the crop.** There are no widely recommended, safe, and CIBRC-approved post-emergence herbicides for Orobanche control *in tomato* in India that do not cause significant crop damage.
    *   **Focus on cultural methods:**
        *   **Deep ploughing** to bury Orobanche seeds.
        *   **Solarization** of soil during hot summer months can reduce seed viability.
        *   **Trap crops** (e.g., flax, sunflower, sorghum) can stimulate Orobanche seed germination but do not allow attachment, thus depleting the seed bank.
        *   **Hand pulling** Orobanche shoots before they flower and set seed is crucial to prevent further spread.
        *   Use of **resistant/tolerant tomato varieties**, if available and suitable for Haryana conditions.

### III. Important Considerations and Precautions

*   **Read the Label:** Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the herbicide label for dosage, application timing, safety precautions, and pre-harvest intervals (PHI).
*   **Spray Uniformity:** Ensure uniform spray coverage for effective weed control. Use appropriate nozzles and spray volume.
*   **Weather Conditions:** Avoid spraying during windy conditions, extreme temperatures, or when rain is expected shortly after application.
*   **Crop Stage:** Apply herbicides at the recommended crop and weed growth stages for optimal efficacy and crop safety.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate herbicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of herbicide-resistant weed populations.
*   **Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):** Always wear appropriate PPE (gloves, mask, protective clothing) during herbicide handling and application.

By adopting these integrated strategies, farmers can effectively manage weeds in tomato fields, ensuring healthy crop growth and good yields.
