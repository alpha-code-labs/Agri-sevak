This is not known to affect Tomato. True rust diseases (caused by fungi like *Puccinia* or *Uromyces* species) are highly host-specific and are not recognized as pathogens of tomato (*Solanum lycopersicum*).

If you are observing reddish-brown spots or lesions on your tomato plants, it is more likely to be another disease such as:
*   **Early Blight** (*Alternaria solani*)
*   **Late Blight** (*Phytophthora infestans*)
*   **Bacterial Spot** (*Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria*)
*   Or a physiological disorder.

For accurate diagnosis and appropriate management, it is recommended to bring a sample to the plant pathology lab at HAU, Hisar, or consult with your local agricultural extension officer.
