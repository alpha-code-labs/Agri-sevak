As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following ideal transplantation practices for Tomato cultivation in Haryana:

### Ideal Transplantation Time for Tomato in Haryana

Tomato can be grown in three main seasons in Haryana:

*   **Kharif (Rainy Season):**
    *   Nursery Sowing: June - July
    *   Transplanting: July - August
*   **Rabi (Winter Season - Main Crop):**
    *   Nursery Sowing: September - October
    *   Transplanting: October - November
*   **Spring-Summer (Zaid Season):**
    *   Nursery Sowing: December - January
    *   Transplanting: January - February

The Rabi season generally provides the best yields due to favorable climatic conditions.

### Ideal Transplantation Distance for Tomato

The spacing depends on the variety (determinate/indeterminate) and the cultivation method (staked/unstaked). For open field cultivation in Haryana:

*   **Determinate (Bush Type) Varieties (often unstaked):**
    *   Row-to-Row: 60 - 75 cm
    *   Plant-to-Plant: 45 - 60 cm
*   **Indeterminate (Vining Type) Varieties (often staked/trellised):**
    *   Row-to-Row: 75 - 90 cm
    *   Plant-to-Plant: 45 - 60 cm

### Ideal Transplantation Process for Tomato

A successful transplantation process ensures healthy plant establishment and good yields:

1.  **Nursery Preparation:**
    *   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds with fungicides like **Thiram** (2-3 g/kg seed) or **Carbendazim** (1-2 g/kg seed) to prevent damping-off disease in the nursery.
    *   Prepare raised nursery beds (15 cm high, 1 m wide, convenient length) with well-drained soil enriched with well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost.
    *   Sow seeds thinly in lines 5-10 cm apart and cover with a thin layer of soil.
    *   Water gently with a rose can.
2.  **Hardening Off:**
    *   About 7-10 days before transplanting, gradually expose seedlings to harsher field conditions. This involves reducing irrigation frequency and exposing them to more sunlight and wind. This process helps seedlings adapt to the field environment and reduces transplant shock.
3.  **Seedling Age and Size:**
    *   Transplant seedlings when they are 4-6 weeks old, 15-20 cm tall, and have 4-5 true leaves.
4.  **Field Preparation:**
    *   Prepare the main field thoroughly by ploughing, harrowing, and leveling.
    *   Incorporate well-decomposed FYM (20-25 tonnes/acre) during field preparation.
    *   Form ridges and furrows or prepare flatbeds according to your irrigation method.
5.  **Timing of Transplanting:**
    *   Transplant seedlings preferably in the late afternoon or on a cloudy day to minimize stress from direct sun and heat.
6.  **Method of Planting:**
    *   Dig holes at the recommended spacing on the ridges or beds.
    *   Carefully remove seedlings from the nursery bed or trays, ensuring minimal root damage.
    *   Plant the seedlings slightly deeper than they were in the nursery, up to the first true leaf.
    *   Gently firm the soil around the base of each plant to ensure good root-to-soil contact.
7.  **Post-Transplant Care:**
    *   Immediately after transplanting, provide a light irrigation to settle the soil around the roots and reduce transplant shock.
    *   Monitor the transplanted seedlings for wilting or pest/disease incidence.
    *   Perform gap filling (replacing dead or unhealthy seedlings) within 5-7 days of transplanting to maintain uniform plant stand.
