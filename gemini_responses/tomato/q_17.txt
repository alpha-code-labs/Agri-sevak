As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following doses for organic manures and bio-stimulants in Tomato cultivation in Haryana:

*   **Farm Yard Manure (FYM):**
    *   Apply **15-20 tonnes per acre** of well-decomposed FYM.
    *   It should be incorporated into the soil during land preparation, at least 2-3 weeks before transplanting.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   Apply **4-5 tonnes per acre** during land preparation, or
    *   Alternatively, apply **2-3 kg per plant** at the time of transplanting, mixed well with the soil in the planting pit.

*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract based bio-stimulant):**
    *   Sagarika is a plant growth stimulant and not a bulk organic manure. It is typically applied as a foliar spray or soil drench.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Mix **2-3 ml per litre of water** and spray at critical growth stages (e.g., 20-25 days after transplanting, at flowering, and at fruit development).
    *   **Soil Drench/Drip Application:** Apply **1-2 litres per acre** mixed with irrigation water, especially during early vegetative growth and fruit set.
