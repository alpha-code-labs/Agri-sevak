Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I understand your concern regarding herbicide injury in tomato crops. Tomatoes are sensitive to many herbicides, especially broadleaf weed killers. The most effective way to reduce harmful effects is through **prevention** and **precise application**. There is no direct "antidote" for most herbicide injuries; the focus is on helping the plant recover.

Here's how to reduce the harmful effects of weedicides/herbicides in tomato:

### I. Prevention: The Most Effective Strategy

Prevention is paramount to avoid herbicide injury. This involves careful planning and execution.

*   **1. Herbicide Selection:**
    *   Use only CIBRC-approved herbicides specifically registered for use in tomato. Many broad-spectrum herbicides can severely damage or kill tomato plants.
    *   For tomato, pre-emergence herbicides (applied before weed or crop emergence) are generally safer than post-emergence options, which are very limited and require extreme caution.
    *   Always read and strictly follow the label instructions for tomato.
*   **2. Correct Dosage:**
    *   Adhere strictly to the recommended dose rate mentioned on the herbicide label for tomato. Overdosing is a primary cause of phytotoxicity.
    *   Underdosing can lead to ineffective weed control and resistance development.
*   **3. Timely Application:**
    *   Apply herbicides at the correct crop growth stage and weed growth stage as specified on the label. Applying at the wrong time can increase crop sensitivity.
    *   For pre-emergence herbicides, apply immediately after transplanting or sowing, before weed emergence.
*   **4. Proper Application Technique:**
    *   **Sprayer Calibration:** Regularly calibrate your sprayer to ensure accurate delivery of the herbicide solution. This is crucial for applying the correct dose.
    *   **Nozzle Selection:** Use appropriate nozzles (e.g., flat fan nozzles for uniform coverage) and maintain recommended spray pressure.
    *   **Uniform Coverage:** Ensure even distribution of the spray solution.
    *   **Drift Management:**
        *   Avoid spraying during windy conditions (wind speed above 8-10 km/h).
        *   Use drift-reducing nozzles or adjuvants if recommended.
        *   Maintain appropriate boom height.
        *   Ensure no spray drift onto adjacent tomato plants or susceptible non-target crops.
*   **5. Environmental Considerations:**
    *   **Temperature:** Avoid spraying during extreme temperatures (very hot or very cold), as this can increase crop stress and herbicide uptake.
    *   **Soil Moisture:** Ensure adequate soil moisture before applying soil-applied herbicides for better efficacy and reduced stress on the crop.
    *   **Rainfall:** Check the label for rain-free periods required after application.
*   **6. Equipment Cleaning:**
    *   Thoroughly clean spray tanks, hoses, and nozzles after each use, especially when switching between different herbicides or crops. Residues from previous applications can cause severe damage.

### II. Mitigation Strategies (If Injury Occurs)

If herbicide injury is observed despite preventive measures, the following steps can help the tomato plants recover:

*   **1. Accurate Diagnosis:**
    *   Confirm that the symptoms are indeed due to herbicide injury and not nutrient deficiency, disease, or insect damage. Symptoms often include leaf yellowing, curling, stunting, necrosis, or abnormal growth.
*   **2. Irrigation:**
    *   If a soil-applied herbicide is suspected of causing injury, light and frequent irrigation can help leach the herbicide out of the root zone, reducing its concentration around the roots.
*   **3. Nutrient Management:**
    *   Provide balanced nutrition to help the plant recover from stress. A foliar application of a balanced nutrient solution can be beneficial.
    *   Consider foliar sprays of micronutrients if deficiencies are suspected or to boost plant vigor.
        *   **Urea** (0.5-1% solution) for nitrogen.
        *   **Monoammonium Phosphate** (0.5% solution) for phosphorus.
        *   **Muriate of Potash** (0.5% solution) for potassium.
        *   **Zinc Sulphate** (0.2-0.5% solution) for zinc.
        *   **Ferrous Sulphate** (0.2-0.5% solution) for iron.
        *   **Borax** (0.1-0.2% solution) for boron.
    *   *Note: These are general supportive measures and not direct antidotes for herbicide injury.*
*   **4. Avoid Further Stress:**
    *   Protect the plants from other stresses such as water scarcity, extreme temperatures, or pest and disease attacks, which can further weaken them.
*   **5. Pruning (if localized damage):**
    *   If only a few leaves or branches are severely damaged, carefully prune them to allow the plant to redirect energy to healthy growth.

By strictly adhering to these guidelines, you can significantly reduce the risk and impact of herbicide injury on your tomato crop, ensuring healthy growth and good yields.
