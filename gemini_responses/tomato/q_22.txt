As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), here are the recommended cultivation practices for Tomato in Haryana:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   Tomato seeds are typically sown in a nursery bed for raising seedlings.
    *   The nursery beds should be raised, well-drained, and treated for soil-borne diseases.
    *   Seeds are sown thinly in lines 10-15 cm apart in the nursery.
    *   Seedlings are ready for transplanting when they are 20-25 days old or have 4-5 true leaves.
    *   Transplanting is done in the main field in rows.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   When transplanting seedlings, the root ball should be placed at a depth of approximately 5-7 cm.
    *   It is beneficial to plant seedlings slightly deeper than they were in the nursery, up to the first set of true leaves, as this encourages the development of adventitious roots from the buried stem, leading to a stronger root system.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   Spacing depends on the variety (determinate or indeterminate) and the cultivation system (e.g., staking).
    *   For most determinate varieties commonly grown in Haryana:
        *   Row-to-row: 60-75 cm
        *   Plant-to-plant: 45-60 cm
    *   For indeterminate varieties (often requiring staking or support):
        *   Row-to-row: 75-90 cm
        *   Plant-to-plant: 45-60 cm

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   The seed dose varies based on the type of variety (hybrid vs. open-pollinated) and desired plant population.
    *   For hybrid varieties: 100-150 g/acre
    *   For open-pollinated varieties: 200-250 g/acre
