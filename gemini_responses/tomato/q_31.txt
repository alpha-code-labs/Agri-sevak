As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling physical damage in Tomato crops in Haryana:

### 1. Fruit Bursting (Cracking)

Fruit bursting is primarily caused by irregular water supply, sudden fluctuations in temperature and humidity, and deficiencies in certain nutrients.

*   **Consistent Irrigation:** Maintain uniform soil moisture through regular and consistent irrigation. Avoid sudden dry-wet cycles, especially when fruits are developing and ripening. Drip irrigation is highly recommended for precise water delivery.
*   **Mulching:** Apply organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves) around the base of plants to help conserve soil moisture, regulate soil temperature, and reduce moisture fluctuations.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure adequate supply of Calcium and Boron, which are crucial for cell wall integrity and fruit elasticity.
    *   **Calcium Nitrate**: Apply as a foliar spray at 0.5% (5 g/L) during fruit development, or through fertigation as per soil test recommendations.
    *   **Sodium tetraborate decahydrate (Borax)**: Apply as a foliar spray at 0.1-0.2% (1-2 g/L) during flowering and fruit set stages, especially if boron deficiency is suspected.
*   **Variety Selection:** Choose crack-resistant tomato varieties suitable for the local climate.

### 2. Leaf Burning/Melting (Sunscald, Heat Stress)

Leaf burning or melting is a symptom of severe heat stress and sunscald, often exacerbated by water stress.

*   **Shade Management:** Install shade nets (e.g., 30-50% shade) over the crop during peak summer months (April to June) to reduce direct sun exposure and ambient temperature around the plants.
*   **Adequate Irrigation:** Ensure plants receive sufficient water, especially during hot periods, to help them cope with high temperatures. Water deeply in the morning.
*   **Plant Spacing:** Maintain optimal plant spacing to allow for good air circulation, which helps in cooling the plant canopy.
*   **Nutrient Support:** Foliar application of certain nutrients can help plants build resilience against heat stress.
    *   **Potassium Nitrate**: Apply as a foliar spray at 1% (10 g/L) during periods of anticipated or ongoing high temperature stress.
    *   **Chelated Micronutrient Mixture**: Apply as per manufacturer's recommendation (typically 1-2 g/L) to ensure overall plant health and enhance stress tolerance.

### 3. Hardness in Fruit (Uneven Ripening, Green Shoulder)

Hardness in fruit, often associated with uneven ripening or green shoulder, is typically caused by high temperatures during fruit development and ripening, coupled with nutrient imbalances.

*   **Temperature Management:** High temperatures (above 30-32°C) inhibit lycopene synthesis, leading to poor colour development and hard patches. Use shade nets during hot periods to lower the canopy temperature.
*   **Balanced Fertilization:** Ensure a balanced supply of nutrients, particularly potassium, which is vital for fruit development, ripening, and quality. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can promote vegetative growth at the expense of fruit quality.
    *   **Potassium Nitrate**: Apply as a foliar spray at 1% (10 g/L) during fruit development and ripening stages to promote uniform ripening and improve fruit quality.
    *   **Potassium Sulphate (Sulphate of Potash)**: Apply to the soil or through fertigation based on soil test recommendations. Typical application rates can range from 50-100 kg/acre split over the growing season, depending on soil type and crop stage.
*   **Pruning:** Prune plants appropriately to ensure good light penetration to the developing fruits, which is essential for uniform ripening.
*   **Consistent Irrigation:** Maintain consistent soil moisture to support healthy fruit development and nutrient uptake.
