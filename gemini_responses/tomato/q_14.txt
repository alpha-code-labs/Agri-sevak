As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods for effective control of soil pests like termites and root-knot nematodes in tomato cultivation.

### General Cultural Practices for Soil Pest Management:

1.  **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy crop residues, weeds, and any woody debris that can harbor pests.
2.  **Deep Summer Ploughing:** Expose soil pests, including termite colonies and nematode eggs/larvae, to scorching sun, which helps in their desiccation and death.
3.  **Soil Solarization:** During hot summer months (May-June), cover moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks. This raises soil temperature, killing many soil-borne pests and pathogens.
4.  **Use Healthy Seedlings:** Always use certified, healthy, and pest-free seedlings to prevent introducing pests into the field.

### Control of Termites:

Termites (subterranean termites) can cause significant damage by feeding on roots and stems, leading to wilting and plant death.

**Cultural/Preventive Measures:**

*   Avoid planting tomatoes in fields with a history of severe termite infestation.
*   Ensure proper drainage to prevent waterlogging, which can stress plants and make them more susceptible.
*   Remove any dead wood or stumps from the field.

**Chemical Control (Pre-planting/At Planting):**

*   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC:** Apply as a pre-planting soil treatment by mixing 2.5-4.0 Litres per acre with 200-400 Litres of water and drenching the soil, or incorporate into the soil before transplanting.
*   **Fipronil 0.3% GR:** Apply 10-20 kg per acre uniformly in the soil at the time of transplanting or sowing.

### Control of Root-Knot Nematodes (*Meloidogyne* spp.):

Root-knot nematodes are microscopic worms that infect plant roots, causing characteristic galls or knots, leading to stunted growth, yellowing, and reduced yield.

**Cultural/Preventive Measures:**

*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate tomatoes with non-host crops like marigold (Tagetes spp.), mustard, sorghum, or maize for at least 2-3 years. Marigold is particularly effective as a trap crop.
*   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost (20-30 tonnes per acre) and neem cake (200-400 kg per acre) into the soil. Neem cake has nematicidal properties and improves soil health.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** If available and suitable for your region, consider using nematode-resistant tomato varieties.
*   **Hot Water Treatment of Seedlings:** For nursery seedlings, dipping roots in hot water (50°C for 10 minutes) can reduce nematode populations, but care must be taken to avoid plant damage.

**Biological Control:**

*   **Purpureocillium lilacinum (formerly Paecilomyces lilacinus):** Apply 2.5-5.0 kg per acre mixed with 50-100 kg of FYM or compost, and broadcast uniformly in the soil before transplanting or drench around the root zone of established plants.
*   **Trichoderma viride/harzianum:** Apply 2.5-5.0 kg per acre mixed with 50-100 kg of FYM or compost, and broadcast uniformly in the soil before transplanting. It can also be used for seedling root dip (10 g/L water for 30 minutes).

**Chemical Control (Pre-planting/At Planting):**

*   **Fluensulfone 2% GR:** Apply 20-30 kg per acre uniformly in the soil at the time of transplanting or sowing. This is a modern and effective nematicide.
*   **Carbofuran 3% CG:** Apply 10-13 kg per acre uniformly in the soil at the time of transplanting or sowing. *While effective, this chemical is highly toxic and should be handled with extreme caution, strictly following safety guidelines.*

Always read and follow the instructions on the product label for specific dosages, application methods, and safety precautions. For precise recommendations tailored to your specific field conditions, it is advisable to get your soil tested for pest presence and population levels.
