Protecting tomato crops from wild animals is crucial for minimizing yield losses. As a Senior Agronomist, I recommend a combination of physical barriers and sound farm management practices, as chemical repellents are generally not recommended for edible crops due to efficacy issues, frequent reapplication needs, and potential residue concerns, unless specifically approved for such use by CIBRC.

Here are the scientifically verified methods to protect your tomato crop from wild animals:

1.  **Physical Fencing:**
    *   **Perimeter Fencing:** Install a robust fence around the entire tomato cultivation area. The type and height of the fence should be chosen based on the prevalent wild animals in your region (e.g., wild boar, nilgai, deer, monkeys, rodents).
        *   For larger animals like wild boar and nilgai, a strong wire mesh or chain-link fence of at least **1.5 to 2 meters** in height is recommended.
        *   To prevent burrowing animals from entering, bury the bottom edge of the fence at least **30-45 cm** deep.
    *   **Electric Fencing:** In areas with severe wild animal depredation, a low-cost electric fence can be an effective deterrent. It requires careful installation, regular maintenance, and clear warning signs for safety.
2.  **Netting:**
    *   **Bird Netting:** For protection against birds and bats, overhead netting can be installed, especially during the fruiting stage. Use a durable, UV-stabilized net with an appropriate mesh size to prevent entry while allowing sunlight and air circulation.
    *   **Individual Plant Cages:** For smaller plots or high-value plants, individual cages made of wire mesh can be placed around each plant to protect them from smaller animals.
3.  **Farm Hygiene and Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Prompt Harvesting:** Harvest ripe tomatoes as soon as they are ready to reduce the attraction for animals. Overripe or fallen fruits are particularly appealing.
    *   **Removal of Fallen Fruit:** Regularly clear fallen or damaged fruits from the field, as these can attract various animals and pests.
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the area around the tomato field free of weeds and tall grasses, which can provide cover and hiding places for rodents and other small animals.
    *   **Boundary Planting:** Planting certain strong-smelling plants like marigold (Tagetes spp.) around the field periphery might act as a mild deterrent for some animals. *Caution: While some plants like castor bean (Ricinus communis) are known repellents, they are toxic and should not be consumed by humans or animals; they are for border planting only and require careful handling.*
4.  **Visual and Auditory Deterrents:**
    *   **Scarecrows and Reflective Tapes:** While their effectiveness is often temporary, scarecrows, reflective ribbons, or old CDs can be used to deter birds and some other animals. Their position should be changed frequently to prevent habituation.
    *   **Sound Devices:** Ultrasonic repellents or sound cannons (used sparingly to avoid disturbing local communities) can be tried, but their long-term effectiveness varies.
