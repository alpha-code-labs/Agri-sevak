Mites, including Red spider mite (*Tetranychus urticae*) and Rust mite (*Aculops lycopersici*), are significant pests of Tomato in Haryana, causing considerable damage if not managed effectively. An Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is crucial for their control.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Mites:**

*   **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect the underside of leaves for mites, webbing (spider mites), or bronzing/russeting (rust mites). Early detection is key.
*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Remove and destroy severely infested plant parts.
    *   Manage weeds in and around the field, as they can host mites.
    *   Ensure proper irrigation and nutrient management to maintain plant vigor, as stressed plants are more susceptible.
    *   Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can promote mite reproduction.
*   **Biological Control:** Encourage natural predators like predatory mites (*Amblyseius* spp.), lacewings, and ladybird beetles by minimizing broad-spectrum pesticide use.

**Chemical Control (Acaricides):**

For effective chemical control, especially during severe infestations, use CIBRC-approved acaricides. Always rotate chemicals with different modes of action to prevent resistance development. Apply thoroughly, ensuring coverage on the underside of leaves where mites often reside.

Here are some recommended acaricides:

*   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:**
    *   Dosage: 0.5 ml per liter of water (or 125 ml per acre).
    *   Effective against all life stages (eggs, nymphs, adults) of both red spider mites and rust mites.
*   **Abamectin 1.9% EC:**
    *   Dosage: 0.5-0.75 ml per liter of water (or 150-200 ml per acre).
    *   Provides good control of both mite species with translaminar action.
*   **Propargite 57% EC:**
    *   Dosage: 2-3 ml per liter of water (or 1-1.5 liters per acre).
    *   A broad-spectrum acaricide effective against red spider mites.
*   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP:**
    *   Dosage: 3-4 grams per liter of water (or 1.5-2 kg per acre).
    *   Particularly effective against rust mites and also provides some control of red spider mites.
    *   **Caution:** Do not apply when temperatures are above 30°C, as it can cause phytotoxicity (leaf burn). Avoid mixing with oil-based products.

**Application Guidelines:**

*   Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the underside of leaves.
*   Use sufficient water volume to ensure good penetration into the canopy.
*   Repeat application if necessary, following the product label's recommended interval.
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label for specific dosages, pre-harvest intervals (PHI), and safety precautions.

**Safety Precautions:**

*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including gloves, mask, and protective clothing during mixing and spraying.
*   Avoid spraying during windy conditions to prevent drift.
*   Do not eat, drink, or smoke while handling pesticides.
*   Wash hands and exposed skin thoroughly after spraying.
*   Dispose of empty containers safely as per local regulations.
