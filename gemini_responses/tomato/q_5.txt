As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the conditions you've mentioned for Tomato cultivation in Haryana:

Here's how to address the conditions:

*   **Scab (Tomato Leaf Mold - *Passalora fulva* / *Cladosporium fulvum*)**
    Tomato Leaf Mold is a common fungal disease that can cause scab-like lesions.
    *   **Symptoms:** Initially, pale green or yellow spots appear on the upper surface of older leaves. On the corresponding lower surface, olive-green to brown, velvety fungal growth develops. In severe cases, flowers and fruits can also be affected.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   **Cultural Practices:** Ensure good air circulation within the crop by proper spacing and pruning. Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day, to reduce leaf wetness. Use resistant varieties if available. Remove and destroy infected plant debris.
        *   **Chemical Control:**
            *   **Mancozeb**: 2.5 grams per litre of water.
            *   **Chlorothalonil**: 2 grams per litre of water.
            *   **Azoxystrobin**: 0.5 ml per litre of water.
            *   **Difenoconazole**: 0.5 ml per litre of water.
            *   **Copper oxychloride**: 2.5-3 grams per litre of water (can also help with bacterial issues).

*   **Canker (Bacterial Canker - *Clavibacter michiganensis* subsp. *michiganensis*)**
    Bacterial Canker is a serious bacterial disease of tomato.
    *   **Symptoms:** Initial symptoms include wilting of leaves, often on one side of the plant or leaflet. Cankers (open sores) may develop on stems, leading to internal discoloration of the vascular tissue. Fruits can develop characteristic "bird's eye" spots with a light brown center and a white halo.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   **Cultural Practices:** Use certified disease-free seeds or transplants. Practice strict sanitation, including cleaning tools and equipment. Implement a 3-4 year crop rotation. Avoid working in fields when plants are wet, as this can spread the bacteria. Remove and destroy infected plants immediately.
        *   **Chemical Control:** Chemical control is primarily suppressive and protective, not curative for established infections.
            *   **Streptomycin sulfate + Tetracycline hydrochloride** (combination product): 6 grams per 10 litres of water.
            *   **Copper oxychloride**: 2.5-3 grams per litre of water.

*   **Gummosis**
    This is not known to affect Tomato. Gummosis is typically a condition associated with woody perennial plants (like fruit trees) where gum exudes from the bark, often in response to stress or disease. Tomatoes are herbaceous annual plants and do not exhibit gummosis.

*   **Lichen**
    This is not known to affect Tomato. Lichens are symbiotic organisms (fungus and alga) that grow on stable surfaces like tree bark, rocks, or soil. They are epiphytes and do not parasitize plants. Tomatoes are short-lived herbaceous plants, and lichens do not grow on them.
