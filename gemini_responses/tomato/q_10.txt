As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I will provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Tomato cultivation in Haryana.

### Control of Borers and Caterpillars in Tomato

Borers (primarily fruit borers like *Helicoverpa armigera* and *Spodoptera litura*) and various caterpillars are significant pests of tomato, causing considerable damage to leaves and fruits. An Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is recommended for effective and sustainable control.

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Practices:**
*   **Deep Summer Ploughing:** Exposes pupae in the soil to predators and sunlight, reducing initial pest populations.
*   **Collection and Destruction:** Regularly collect and destroy larvae and infested fruits to break the pest life cycle.
*   **Pheromone Traps:** Install pheromone traps for *Helicoverpa armigera* at a rate of 5 traps per acre for monitoring and mass trapping. Replace lures every 2-3 weeks.
*   **Trap Cropping:** Plant marigold as a trap crop around tomato fields. Marigold attracts *Helicoverpa armigera* for egg laying, which can then be collected and destroyed.
*   **Bird Perches:** Erect bird perches in the field to encourage predatory birds to feed on larvae.

**2. Biological Control:**
*   **Parasitoids:** Release *Trichogramma chilonis* or *Trichogramma pretiosum* egg parasitoids @ 50,000 eggs per acre, 3-4 times at weekly intervals, starting from the flowering stage.
*   **Biopesticides:**
    *   Spray formulations of **Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)** @ 1 kg/acre or 1 g/L of water, especially effective against young larvae.
    *   Apply HaNPV (for *Helicoverpa armigera*) @ 250 LE (Larval Equivalents) per acre.
    *   Apply SlNPV (for *Spodoptera litura*) @ 250 LE per acre.

**3. Chemical Control (Use only CIBRC approved chemicals and rotate them to prevent resistance):**
When pest incidence crosses the Economic Threshold Level (ETL), chemical intervention may be necessary. Ensure thorough spray coverage.

*   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC @ 150 ml/acre.
*   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG @ 80-100 g/acre.
*   **Flubendiamide** 20% WG @ 100-120 g/acre.
*   **Indoxacarb** 14.5% SC @ 200 ml/acre.
*   **Spinetoram** 11.7% SC @ 160-180 ml/acre.

### Diamondback Moth (DBM) in Tomato

This is not known to affect Tomato. Diamondback moth (*Plutella xylostella*) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower, mustard) and does not cause significant damage to tomato.

### Leaf Folder in Tomato

While some general defoliating caterpillars (covered under 'Caterpillars' above) may cause leaves to fold or roll, a specific 'Leaf folder' is not considered a major primary pest of Tomato in Haryana. The integrated control measures recommended for general caterpillars and borers will be effective if such damage is observed.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read the label instructions carefully before using any pesticide.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying.
*   Observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) for each chemical to ensure food safety.
*   Rotate different classes of insecticides to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.
