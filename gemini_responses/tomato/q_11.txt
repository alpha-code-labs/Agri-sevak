As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing pests in Tomato cultivation in Haryana. Effective pest management relies on an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods.

Here's how to control Beetles and Weevils in Tomato. Regarding Sawflies, please note the specific statement below.

### **Control of Beetles in Tomato**

Beetles, such as Flea beetles, Blister beetles, and Epilachna beetles, can cause significant damage to tomato plants by feeding on leaves, stems, and sometimes fruits.

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Regularly remove weeds and crop residues that can harbor beetle pests.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation to break the pest life cycle.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** During summer, deep ploughing can expose beetle pupae and larvae to predators and harsh weather, reducing their population.
*   **Hand-picking:** In small holdings, larger beetles and their larvae can be hand-picked and destroyed.

**2. Chemical Control (Apply only when pest incidence crosses Economic Threshold Level):**
For effective control, consider the following CIBRC approved insecticides:
*   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** 0.3-0.5 ml per litre of water.
*   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** 0.2-0.4 g per litre of water.
*   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** 0.5-1.0 ml per litre of water.
*   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** 0.3 ml per litre of water.
*   **Spinosad 45% SC:** 0.25-0.3 ml per litre of water.

### **Control of Weevils in Tomato**

Weevils, such as the Vegetable weevil, can damage tomato plants by feeding on leaves (causing characteristic notching), stems, and sometimes roots or fruits.

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Keep the field free of weeds, especially broadleaf weeds, which can serve as alternate hosts.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate tomato with non-host crops.
*   **Hand-picking:** Adults can be hand-picked, especially during cooler parts of the day when they are less active.

**2. Chemical Control (Apply only when pest incidence crosses Economic Threshold Level):**
For effective control, consider the following CIBRC approved insecticides:
*   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** 0.5-1.0 ml per litre of water.
*   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** 0.3 ml per litre of water.
*   **Indoxacarb 14.5% SC:** 0.5 ml per litre of water.
*   **Cypermethrin 25% EC:** 0.5 ml per litre of water.

### **Sawflies in Tomato**

This is not known to affect Tomato. Sawflies are generally not considered significant pests of tomato crops in Haryana or India.

### **Important General Precautions:**
*   **Read the Label:** Always read and follow the instructions on the insecticide label for correct dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   **Protective Gear:** Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Observe the specified pre-harvest interval to ensure the produce is safe for consumption.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pest resistance.
*   **Spray Timing:** Apply insecticides during the cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   **Water Quality:** Use clean water for spraying.
