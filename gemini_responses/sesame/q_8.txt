Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I advise you on the control of sucking pests in Sesame (Til). Effective management relies on an integrated pest management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods.

**General Management Practices:**

1.  **Regular Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your sesame crop for the presence of aphids, leafhoppers, whiteflies, and thrips, especially on the undersides of leaves and tender shoots. Early detection is key.
2.  **Timely Sowing:** Sow sesame at the recommended time for your region to avoid peak pest infestations.
3.  **Weed Management:** Keep your fields free of weeds, as many weeds can act as alternate hosts for these sucking pests.
4.  **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, as it can lead to lush growth that is more attractive to sucking pests. Follow recommended fertilizer schedules.
5.  **Conservation of Natural Enemies:** Protect and encourage natural enemies like ladybird beetles, lacewings, syrphid fly larvae, and parasitic wasps, which prey on aphids and whiteflies. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides unless absolutely necessary.
6.  **Resistant Varieties:** If available and recommended by HAU for your specific region, consider cultivating pest-tolerant sesame varieties.

**Chemical Control (When necessary):**

Chemical intervention should only be considered when the pest population crosses the Economic Threshold Level (ETL). Always ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves. Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

For the control of Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips in Sesame, you can use the following CIBRC approved insecticides:

*   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: Apply 100-125 ml per acre.
*   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: Apply 40-50 g per acre.
*   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP: Apply 80-100 g per acre.
*   **Fipronil** 5% SC: Apply 400-600 ml per acre (particularly effective against thrips and leafhoppers).
*   **Dimethoate** 30% EC: Apply 250-300 ml per acre.

**Note on Psylla:**
This is not known to affect Sesame.

Always use the recommended quantity of water (typically 200-250 litres per acre for field crops) to ensure proper coverage and efficacy of the insecticide. Read the label carefully before use and follow all safety precautions.

For any specific concerns or further guidance, please consult your local Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or HAU extension specialist.
