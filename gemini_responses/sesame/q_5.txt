As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the conditions you've mentioned for Sesame cultivation in Haryana:

1.  **Scab:**
    This is not known to affect Sesame.

2.  **Canker:**
    Canker-like symptoms, particularly stem cankers, can be caused by bacterial blight (*Xanthomonas campestris pv. sesami*), a significant disease in sesame.

    **Control Measures for Bacterial Blight (causing Canker):**

    *   **Cultural Practices:**
        *   Use disease-free seeds.
        *   Practice crop rotation with non-host crops.
        *   Remove and destroy infected plant debris to reduce inoculum.
        *   Avoid overhead irrigation, especially during flowering and capsule formation, as wet conditions favor bacterial spread.

    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   For severe infections, especially during early stages, copper-based bactericides can be effective.
        *   **Copper Oxychloride** (50% WP) at 3 g/L of water (or 1.2 kg/acre in 400 L of water) as a foliar spray. Repeat application after 10-15 days if necessary, depending on disease severity.

3.  **Gummosis:**
    This is not known to affect Sesame.

4.  **Lichen:**
    This is not known to affect Sesame. Lichens are generally harmless epiphytes and do not parasitize herbaceous plants like sesame.
