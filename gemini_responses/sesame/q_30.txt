As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified management strategies for growth issues in Sesame (Til) in Haryana.

**General Principle:** A comprehensive soil test is the foundation for managing most growth issues related to nutrient imbalances. It provides precise recommendations for fertilizer application.

### 1. Slow Growth

Slow growth in Sesame can be attributed to various factors including nutrient deficiencies, water stress, soil compaction, or sub-optimal temperatures.

*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Nitrogen (N) Deficiency:** Apply **Urea** at 20-30 kg/acre as a top dressing at 30-45 days after sowing (DAS), or a foliar spray of 2% **Urea** solution (20 g/L water).
    *   **Phosphorus (P) Deficiency:** Ensure adequate basal application of **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (50-60 kg/acre) or **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (125-150 kg/acre) at sowing.
    *   **Potassium (K) Deficiency:** Apply **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** at 20-30 kg/acre as basal or top dressing.
    *   **Zinc (Zn) Deficiency:** Apply **Zinc sulfate heptahydrate** at 10 kg/acre as basal, or foliar spray of 0.5% **Zinc sulfate heptahydrate** (5 g/L water) + 0.25% lime (2.5 g/L water) at 30 and 45 DAS.
    *   **Iron (Fe) Deficiency:** Foliar spray of 0.5% **Ferrous sulfate heptahydrate** (5 g/L water) + 0.25% lime (2.5 g/L water) at 30 and 45 DAS.
*   **Water Management:** Ensure optimal soil moisture. Avoid both waterlogging and drought stress, especially during critical growth stages.
*   **Soil Health:** Incorporate well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost (5-10 tonnes/acre) before sowing to improve soil structure and nutrient availability.
*   **Weed Control:** Timely weeding to reduce competition for nutrients and water.

### 2. Yellow Growth (Chlorosis)

Yellowing of leaves (chlorosis) often indicates nutrient deficiencies or waterlogging.

*   **Nitrogen (N) Deficiency (general yellowing, older leaves first):** Apply **Urea** as a top dressing (20-30 kg/acre) or foliar spray (2% **Urea** solution).
*   **Iron (Fe) Deficiency (interveinal yellowing, younger leaves first, common in high pH soils):** Foliar spray of 0.5% **Ferrous sulfate heptahydrate** (5 g/L water) + 0.25% lime (2.5 g/L water) at 7-10 day intervals until recovery.
*   **Zinc (Zn) Deficiency (stunted growth, small yellow leaves):** Foliar spray of 0.5% **Zinc sulfate heptahydrate** (5 g/L water) + 0.25% lime (2.5 g/L water).
*   **Sulfur (S) Deficiency (general yellowing, younger leaves first):** Apply **Elemental sulfur** at 10 kg/acre or **Gypsum** at 100 kg/acre as basal.
*   **Waterlogging:** Improve field drainage. If possible, create furrows to remove excess water.

### 3. Excessive Height

Excessive height can lead to lodging, especially during strong winds or heavy rains, impacting yield.

*   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive application of Nitrogen, which promotes vegetative growth. Base N application on soil test recommendations.
*   **Planting Density:** Maintain optimal plant spacing (e.g., 30-45 cm row-to-row and 10-15 cm plant-to-plant) to prevent etiolation (stretching due to competition for light).
*   **Variety Selection:** Choose varieties known for their moderate height and lodging resistance suitable for Haryana conditions.
*   **Weed Control:** Ensure effective weed management to prevent competition for light, which can cause plants to stretch.
*   **Plant Growth Regulators:** Currently, there are no CIBRC approved plant growth regulators specifically recommended for height reduction in Sesame in India for general farmer use. Focus on cultural practices.

### 4. Excessive Flowering

While abundant flowering is generally desirable, if it leads to poor pod set, premature senescence, or reduced seed fill, it indicates underlying stress.

*   **Optimal Nutrient Management:** Ensure a balanced supply of all macro and micronutrients throughout the crop cycle, especially during flowering and pod development. Refer to soil test results.
*   **Water Management:** Provide adequate and timely irrigation, particularly during the flowering and pod development stages, to prevent moisture stress.
*   **Pest and Disease Control:** Manage any pest or disease infestations promptly, as stress from these can affect flower and pod retention.
*   **Environmental Stress:** Protect plants from extreme temperatures or humidity fluctuations if possible, though this is often beyond direct control.

Always consult your local agricultural extension office or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions.
