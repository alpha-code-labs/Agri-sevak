As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice on irrigation management for Sesame (Til) in Haryana. While sesame is considered a relatively drought-tolerant crop, timely and judicious irrigation significantly boosts yield and oil content, especially during critical growth stages.

**General Principles of Irrigation Management for Sesame:**

*   Sesame is sensitive to both water stress and waterlogging. Optimal soil moisture is crucial.
*   The most critical growth stages for irrigation are flowering and pod development.

**1. First Irrigation:**

*   The timing of the first irrigation is crucial and depends heavily on soil type, rainfall received, and the initial soil moisture at sowing.
*   Generally, if there is no significant rainfall after sowing, the first irrigation is recommended around **25-30 days after sowing (DAS)**.
*   This period often coincides with the active branching and early flowering stage, which is a critical phase for vegetative growth and flower initiation.
*   For light-textured sandy soils, this might be slightly earlier, while for heavier soils, it could be delayed if sufficient moisture is present.

**2. Second and Subsequent Irrigations:**

*   The second irrigation should be timed to coincide with the **peak flowering to early pod development stage**, typically around **45-55 DAS**, especially if there is a dry spell.
*   This is the most sensitive stage for water stress, as it directly impacts flower retention and pod setting, which are crucial for yield.
*   A third irrigation, if required, can be given during the **seed filling stage** (around 65-70 DAS), particularly in prolonged dry periods, to ensure good seed size and oil content. However, care must be taken to avoid irrigation close to maturity (when capsules start drying) to prevent capsule shattering and potential disease issues.
*   In total, **2-3 irrigations** are generally sufficient for sesame in Haryana, apart from any pre-sowing irrigation (palewa), depending on rainfall distribution during the Kharif season.

**3. Sprinkler Use:**

Sprinkler irrigation is an excellent method for sesame cultivation, offering high water use efficiency, especially beneficial in areas with limited water availability or on sandy soils prevalent in parts of Haryana.

*   **Advantages of Sprinkler Irrigation:**
    *   **Uniform Water Distribution:** Ensures even application of water across the field, preventing waterlogging in some areas and water stress in others.
    *   **Water Saving:** Significantly reduces water losses due to deep percolation and surface runoff compared to flood irrigation, leading to higher water use efficiency.
    *   **Maintains Optimal Soil Moisture:** Allows for light and frequent irrigations, which sesame prefers, without causing excessive wetness that can lead to root diseases.
    *   **Suitable for Undulating Terrain:** Can be effectively used on uneven land where flood irrigation is difficult or inefficient.
    *   **Reduced Soil Erosion:** Minimizes soil erosion, especially on sloped fields.

*   **Considerations for Sprinkler Use:**
    *   Apply water at a low intensity to match the infiltration rate of the soil, especially in heavy soils, to avoid runoff.
    *   Avoid irrigation during strong winds to ensure uniform distribution and minimize drift losses.
    *   Monitor soil moisture regularly (e.g., using a tensiometer or by feel method) to determine the precise timing and amount of water needed, optimizing water application.

**Important Note:** It is crucial to avoid over-irrigation, as sesame is highly sensitive to waterlogging, which can lead to root rot, nutrient leaching, and significant yield reduction. Always assess the soil moisture status before applying irrigation.
