### **I. Yield Improvement for Sesame**

To maximize sesame yield, focus on integrated management practices:

1.  **Variety Selection:**
    *   Choose high-yielding, disease-resistant varieties specifically recommended for Haryana's agro-climatic conditions. Examples include HT-1, RT-351, RT-374, TKG-21, or Gujarat Til-2, which are known for their adaptability and higher productivity.

2.  **Optimal Sowing Time:**
    *   For Kharif sesame, the ideal sowing window is from the last week of June to the first fortnight of July, coinciding with the onset of monsoon. Timely sowing ensures optimal growth and helps in avoiding peak pest and disease periods.

3.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Nitrogen (N):** Apply 40 kg N per acre. Half (20 kg N) should be applied as basal at sowing, and the remaining half (20 kg N) as top dressing 30-35 days after sowing (DAS).
    *   **Phosphorus (P):** Apply 20 kg P2O5 per acre as basal at the time of sowing.
    *   **Potassium (K):** Apply 20 kg K2O per acre as basal at the time of sowing, especially on light-textured soils.
    *   **Micronutrients:**
        *   **Zinc:** If soil tests indicate deficiency or symptoms appear, apply 10 kg **Zinc sulphate** per acre as basal. Alternatively, spray 0.5% **Zinc sulphate** solution (5 g/L water) at 30 and 45 DAS.
        *   **Boron:** For improved seed setting and oil content, spray 0.2% **Borax** solution (2 g/L water) at the flowering stage.

4.  **Water Management:**
    *   Sesame is relatively drought-tolerant but benefits significantly from irrigation during critical growth stages: branching, flowering, and capsule development. Provide light irrigations if monsoon is erratic or during prolonged dry spells. Ensure proper drainage to avoid waterlogging.

5.  **Weed Management:**
    *   **Cultural:** Perform two hand weedings at 20-25 DAS and 40-45 DAS for effective weed control.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   Pre-emergence: Apply **Pendimethalin** 1.0 kg a.i./acre (e.g., 3.3 L of 30% EC or 1.0 L of 38.7% CS) within 3 days of sowing.
        *   Post-emergence (for grassy weeds): Apply **Quizalofop-ethyl** 50 g a.i./acre (e.g., 1.0 L of 5% EC) at 20-25 DAS.

6.  **Pest Management:**
    *   **Leaf webber and Pod borer:**
        *   Regularly monitor for infestation. If the economic threshold is crossed, spray **Chlorantraniliprole** 60 ml/acre (18.5% SC) or **Flubendiamide** 80 ml/acre (39.35% SC) or **Emamectin benzoate** 80-100 g/acre (5% SG).
    *   **Gall fly:**
        *   If incidence is observed, spray **Dimethoate** 400 ml/acre (30% EC) or **Thiomethoxam** 100 g/acre (25% WG) at the initial stage of infestation.
    *   **Phyllody vector (Leafhoppers):**
        *   To manage the leafhoppers that transmit phyllody, spray **Imidacloprid** 100 ml/acre (17.8% SL) or **Acetamiprid** 80 g/acre (20% SP) at 20-25 DAS and repeat after 15 days if necessary.

7.  **Disease Management:**
    *   **Phytophthora Blight:**
        *   Use resistant varieties and ensure good field drainage. If severe, spray **Metalaxyl + Mancozeb** 500 g/acre (72% WP) or **Propamocarb hydrochloride** 1.0 L/acre (72.2% SL).
    *   **Bacterial Blight:**
        *   Use disease-free seeds and avoid overhead irrigation. Spray a mixture of **Streptomycin sulphate + Tetracycline hydrochloride** (antibiotic mixture) 6 g/10 L water along with **Copper oxychloride** 25 g/10 L water.
    *   **Powdery Mildew:**
        *   If observed, spray wettable **Sulphur** 1.0 kg/acre (80% WP) or **Hexaconazole** 200 ml/acre (5% EC).

### **II. Fruit (Capsule and Seed) Quality Improvement**

Improving the quality of sesame capsules and seeds is crucial for market value and end-product quality.

1.  **Balanced Nutrition:**
    *   Ensure an adequate and balanced supply of all macro and micronutrients. As mentioned, **Boron** is particularly critical for pollen viability, successful fertilization, and proper seed development, leading to bolder, well-filled seeds with higher oil content. Sufficient **Potassium** also contributes to better seed filling and oil synthesis.

2.  **Effective Pest and Disease Management:**
    *   Healthy plants, free from the stress of pests and diseases, are essential for producing superior quality capsules and seeds. Timely and effective intervention against pests and diseases prevents damage to developing capsules and ensures optimal nutrient allocation to the seeds.

3.  **Timely Harvesting:**
    *   Harvest sesame when 75-80% of the capsules have turned yellow and the lower leaves start shedding. Premature harvesting results in immature, shriveled seeds with lower oil content, while delayed harvesting can lead to significant shattering losses and reduced seed quality due to over-drying or unexpected rains.

4.  **Proper Drying:**
    *   After harvesting, bundle the plants and stack them upright in the field for 3-4 days for sun-drying. This allows for uniform drying of the capsules and seeds, preventing mold growth and maintaining the natural color and quality of the seeds.

### **III. Storage Life Improvement for Sesame Seeds**

Proper storage is vital to prevent post-harvest losses and maintain seed viability and quality.

1.  **Thorough Drying:**
    *   This is the most critical step. Sesame seeds must be dried to a safe moisture content of 6-8% for long-term storage. Higher moisture content promotes rapid mold growth, insect infestation, and rancidity. Utilize sun-drying or mechanical dryers, ensuring uniform drying.

2.  **Cleaning and Grading:**
    *   Thoroughly clean the threshed seeds to remove all foreign matter (chaff, dust, stones), immature seeds, broken seeds, and insect-damaged seeds. This significantly reduces the potential for storage pests and diseases and improves the overall quality and marketability of the stored produce.

3.  **Cool and Dry Storage Environment:**
    *   Store sesame seeds in a cool (ideally below 20°C), dry, and well-ventilated place. High temperature and humidity accelerate seed deterioration, rancidity, and pest activity.

4.  **Pest-Proof Storage:**
    *   Store seeds in clean, disinfected, airtight containers or bags (e.g., jute bags lined with polythene or woven polypropylene bags). Ensure the storage area is free from rodents, birds, and crawling insects.
    *   Before storing, thoroughly clean and disinfest the storage godown or structure.

5.  **Monitoring and Aeration:**
    *   Regularly inspect stored seeds for any signs of insect infestation, mold growth, or moisture accumulation. If moisture builds up, re-dry the seeds. Aerate the storage area periodically to maintain optimal conditions.

6.  **Fumigation (if necessary, by trained personnel):**
    *   For large-scale or long-term storage, if insect infestation is detected, fumigation with **Aluminium phosphide** tablets can be carried out. This must be done strictly by trained and certified personnel, adhering to all safety guidelines and recommended dosages, as it is a highly toxic chemical. It is not recommended for general farm-level application without expert supervision.
