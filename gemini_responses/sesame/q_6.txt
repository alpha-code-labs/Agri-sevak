As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling viral diseases in Sesame (Sesamum indicum) in Haryana.

Firstly, regarding the specific diseases mentioned:

*   **Tristeza:** This is not known to affect Sesame. Citrus Tristeza Virus (CTV) is a significant pathogen of citrus crops.

For Leaf curl, Mosaic, Yellow vein clearing, Stripe, and Stunt virus, these are indeed known to affect Sesame in varying degrees. Viral diseases in plants are generally not curable once the plant is infected. Therefore, control strategies focus primarily on prevention, managing the insect vectors that transmit these viruses, and adopting good cultural practices.

Here's a comprehensive approach to manage viral diseases in Sesame:

**I. Vector Management (Controlling Insects that Spread Viruses):**
The primary vectors for most sesame viral diseases (like Leaf Curl and Yellow Vein Clearing) are whiteflies, while aphids can transmit mosaic viruses. Effective control of these vectors is crucial.

*   **Seed Treatment (for early protection against sucking pests):**
    *   **Imidacloprid** 48% FS: 5-7 ml per kg seed.
    *   **Thiamethoxam** 30% FS: 5-7 ml per kg seed.

*   **Foliar Sprays (when vector population is observed):**
    *   **For Whiteflies (primary vector for Leaf Curl and Yellow Vein Clearing):**
        *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: 125-150 ml per acre.
        *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: 100 g per acre.
        *   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP: 50-100 g per acre.
        *   **Buprofezin** 25% SC: 500-600 ml per acre.
        *   **Spiromesifen** 22.9% SC: 120-150 ml per acre.
        *   **Diafenthiuron** 50% WP: 250 g per acre.
    *   **For Aphids (vectors for Mosaic viruses):**
        *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: 125-150 ml per acre.
        *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: 100 g per acre.
        *   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP: 50-100 g per acre.
        *   **Dimethoate** 30% EC: 330 ml per acre.

*   **Monitoring:** Regularly monitor the crop for the presence of whiteflies and aphids using yellow sticky traps (10-12 traps per acre) and visual inspection. Spray insecticides only when pest populations reach economic threshold levels.

**II. Cultural Practices:**

*   **Resistant/Tolerant Varieties:** Where available and suitable for Haryana conditions, choose sesame varieties known to have resistance or tolerance to common viral diseases. Consult HAU for the latest recommended varieties.
*   **Healthy Seed:** Use certified, disease-free seeds from reliable sources.
*   **Timely Sowing:** Sow sesame at the recommended time for your region in Haryana. Early or late sowing can sometimes expose the crop to higher vector populations.
*   **Rogueing:** Regularly inspect the field and promptly remove and destroy (bury or burn) any plants showing symptoms of viral infection (e.g., leaf curling, mosaic patterns, yellowing, stunting). This helps prevent the spread of the virus to healthy plants.
*   **Weed Management:** Many weeds can act as alternate hosts for both the viruses and their insect vectors. Keep the field and surrounding areas free of weeds.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure balanced fertilization to promote vigorous plant growth, which can help plants tolerate stress better. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can sometimes favor sucking pest multiplication.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops to break the disease cycle.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove crop residues after harvest to reduce potential inoculum sources and vector habitats.

By integrating these strategies, you can effectively minimize the incidence and severity of viral diseases in your sesame crop. Always follow label instructions for all chemical applications and ensure worker safety.
