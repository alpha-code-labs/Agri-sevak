As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I understand the critical importance of protecting sesame (til) from environmental stresses to ensure optimal yield in Haryana. Sesame is a warm-season crop, and while relatively hardy, extreme weather conditions can significantly impact its growth and productivity.

Here's how to protect sesame from environmental stress:

### 1. Protection from Extreme Cold and Frost

Sesame is highly sensitive to cold temperatures and frost, especially during germination, flowering, and early capsule development. Frost can cause severe damage, leading to flower drop, poor seed set, and even plant death.

*   **Timely Sowing:** The most effective measure is to ensure timely sowing during the recommended Kharif season (typically July-August in Haryana). This allows the crop to complete its life cycle before the onset of winter frosts (November-December). Avoid late sowing.
*   **Irrigation:** If a frost event is predicted, providing a light irrigation to the field in the late afternoon can help. Water has a higher specific heat capacity and releases latent heat slowly, which can slightly raise the ambient temperature around the plants and protect them from freezing.
*   **Potassium Nutrition:** Ensure adequate supply of potassium (K) through balanced fertilization. Potassium plays a vital role in improving the plant's physiological resilience and enhancing its ability to withstand cold stress.

### 2. Protection from Heat/Loo and Intense Sunlight

High temperatures (above 40°C), hot dry winds (locally known as 'Loo'), and intense sunlight, particularly during the critical flowering and capsule development stages, can lead to flower abortion, poor seed set, reduced seed size, and overall yield loss due to increased transpiration and heat stress.

*   **Timely Sowing:** Similar to cold stress, adjusting the sowing time is crucial. Kharif sowing generally helps sesame avoid the peak summer heat of May-June during its reproductive stages.
*   **Timely and Adequate Irrigation:** Provide timely and sufficient irrigation, especially during flowering and capsule formation. This helps in evaporative cooling, maintains plant turgor, and mitigates the adverse effects of heat and dry winds.
*   **Mulching:** Apply organic mulches (e.g., straw, crop residues) to the soil surface. Mulching helps to reduce soil temperature, conserve soil moisture by reducing evaporation, and suppress weed growth, all of which contribute to a more favorable microclimate for the crop.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure balanced nutrition, with particular emphasis on potassium. Potassium improves water use efficiency and enhances the plant's tolerance to heat and drought stress.
*   **Foliar Application of Stress Mitigants:**
    *   **Potassium Nitrate:** Spraying a 1-2% solution of **Potassium Nitrate** (10-20 g per liter of water) during periods of anticipated heat stress can improve the plant's physiological resilience, water use efficiency, and overall stress tolerance. Apply during the cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening).
    *   **Kaolin Clay:** Spraying a 5-6% solution of **Kaolin clay** (50-60 g per liter of water) can form a reflective white film on the leaves. This film reflects sunlight, reduces leaf temperature, and decreases transpiration, thereby mitigating the effects of intense sunlight and heat stress. Repeat application might be necessary after heavy rainfall.
