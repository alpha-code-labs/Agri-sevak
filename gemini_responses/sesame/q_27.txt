Sesame (Til) is a valuable oilseed crop well-suited to the agro-climatic conditions of Haryana, provided specific requirements are met.

Here are the suitable climate, soil type, and drainage requirements for optimal Sesame cultivation:

**1. Climate:**
*   **Temperature:** Sesame is a tropical and sub-tropical crop that thrives in warm conditions.
    *   **Germination:** Requires a minimum soil temperature of 20°C, with optimal germination occurring between 25-30°C.
    *   **Growth:** Optimal growth and development occur at temperatures ranging from 25-35°C. Temperatures below 15°C or above 40°C can adversely affect growth and yield.
*   **Rainfall:** It is a drought-tolerant crop but requires adequate moisture during critical growth stages.
    *   **Total Rainfall:** A well-distributed rainfall of 500-800 mm during the growing season is ideal.
    *   **Distribution:** Critical stages for moisture are flowering and capsule formation. Prolonged dry spells during these periods can reduce yield. Excessive rainfall, especially during flowering, can lead to flower drop and waterlogging issues.
*   **Sunshine:** Requires bright sunshine for good growth and oil synthesis. Cloudy weather and high humidity can increase disease incidence.
*   **Frost:** Sesame is highly susceptible to frost and cannot tolerate it at any stage of growth.

**2. Soil Type:**
*   **Texture:** Sesame performs best on well-drained, light to medium-textured soils.
    *   **Ideal:** Sandy loam to loam soils are most suitable.
    *   **Avoid:** Heavy clay soils with poor drainage are unsuitable as they can lead to waterlogging and root rot. Very light sandy soils may require more frequent irrigation and nutrient management.
*   **pH:** It can tolerate a wide range of soil pH but thrives in slightly acidic to neutral soils.
    *   **Optimal:** pH range of 5.5 to 7.5 is considered ideal.
*   **Organic Matter:** Soils rich in organic matter promote healthy growth and better nutrient availability.
*   **Salinity/Alkalinity:** Sesame has moderate tolerance to salinity and alkalinity, but extreme conditions will reduce yield.

**3. Drainage Requirement:**
*   **Crucial:** Excellent drainage is paramount for successful sesame cultivation.
*   **Sensitivity to Waterlogging:** Sesame is highly sensitive to waterlogging at all stages of growth, especially during germination and early seedling development.
    *   **Impact:** Waterlogging for even a short period (24-48 hours) can cause severe damage, leading to root rot, wilting, and significant yield losses.
*   **Field Preparation:** Fields must be well-prepared with proper leveling and provision for excess water drainage, particularly in areas prone to heavy rainfall. Raised beds can be beneficial in such situations.
