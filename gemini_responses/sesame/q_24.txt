As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I must clarify that **transplantation is generally not recommended for Sesame (Til)**.

Sesame plants possess a delicate taproot system that is highly sensitive to disturbance. Transplanting often leads to:
*   Poor establishment and high seedling mortality.
*   Stunted growth and delayed maturity.
*   Significant reduction in overall yield.

Therefore, the ideal and recommended practice for Sesame cultivation is **direct sowing**. Below are the ideal time, distance, and process for direct sowing in Haryana:

### Ideal Sowing Time for Sesame in Haryana
*   **Kharif Season:** The optimal time for sowing Sesame in Haryana is the **first fortnight of July** (i.e., July 1st to July 15th). This aligns with the onset of monsoon rains, which is crucial for rainfed sesame.
*   **Spring/Summer Season (with irrigation):** In areas with assured irrigation, Sesame can also be sown from **mid-February to mid-March**.

### Ideal Sowing Distance (Spacing) for Sesame
The recommended spacing for direct-sown Sesame to ensure optimal plant growth and yield is:
*   **Row-to-Row Distance:** 30-45 cm
*   **Plant-to-Plant Distance:** 10-15 cm (achieved through thinning after emergence)

### Ideal Sowing Process for Sesame (Direct Sowing)
1.  **Land Preparation:**
    *   Perform 1-2 ploughings followed by planking to achieve a fine, firm, and well-pulverized seedbed.
    *   Ensure the field is free from weeds and stubble.
2.  **Seed Treatment:**
    *   Treat seeds with a suitable fungicide (e.g., **Carbendazim** 2 g/kg seed or **Thiram** 2.5 g/kg seed) to protect against seed-borne diseases.
    *   Optionally, treat with an insecticide (e.g., **Imidacloprid** 5 g/kg seed) for early protection against sucking pests.
3.  **Sowing Method:**
    *   Sow seeds in rows at the recommended spacing (30-45 cm apart).
    *   The ideal sowing depth is 2-3 cm. Deeper sowing can lead to poor emergence.
    *   Use a seed drill for uniform sowing, or sow manually in furrows.
    *   The seed rate typically ranges from 2.5-3.0 kg/acre for pure crop.
4.  **Thinning:**
    *   Thinning is crucial for maintaining optimal plant population.
    *   Perform thinning 15-20 days after sowing, leaving healthy plants at a distance of 10-15 cm within the row.
5.  **Weed Management:**
    *   Early weed control is vital as sesame is highly sensitive to weed competition, especially in the first 30-45 days.
    *   Perform 1-2 manual weedings or use pre-emergence herbicides like **Pendimethalin** (1.0 kg a.i./acre) within 3 days of sowing.
