As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with the scientifically verified advice regarding the maturity signs, harvesting time, and cutting process for Sesame (Til) in Haryana.

### Maturity Signs for Sesame

The maturity of sesame is indicated by several visual cues:
*   **Leaf Senescence:** The lower leaves of the plant start turning yellow and gradually drop off.
*   **Capsule Color Change:** The capsules (pods) on the lower and middle parts of the plant change color from green to yellow, and then to light brown or straw color, depending on the variety.
*   **Capsule Drying and Splitting:** The capsules, particularly those at the bottom of the plant, begin to dry and may show signs of splitting open (dehiscence), indicating the seeds inside are mature.
*   **Seed Firmness:** The seeds inside the mature capsules become firm and attain their characteristic color (e.g., white, black, brown).
*   **Overall Plant Appearance:** The entire plant starts to dry down, and the stem may also show signs of yellowing.

### Harvesting Time for Sesame

The optimal time for harvesting sesame is crucial to minimize shattering losses and ensure good seed quality:
*   **Stage of Maturity:** Harvest when about 75-80% of the capsules on the plant have matured, turned yellow/brown, and the lower capsules have started to dry and show initial signs of splitting.
*   **Plant Condition:** It is best to harvest when the plants are still slightly green, especially the upper parts, to prevent excessive shattering of seeds from the fully dried capsules.
*   **Days After Sowing:** Depending on the variety and local conditions, harvesting typically occurs between 90 to 100 days after sowing. Early maturing varieties may be ready sooner.
*   **Weather Conditions:** Harvest during dry weather to facilitate drying and prevent mold growth.

### Cutting Process for Sesame

The cutting and post-harvest handling process for sesame is as follows:
*   **Cutting Method:** Sesame plants are typically harvested manually by cutting them close to the ground using a sickle.
*   **Bundling:** The cut plants are gathered into small bundles or sheaves.
*   **Field Drying/Curing:** These bundles are then stacked upright in the field against each other or on drying racks for 7-10 days. This allows for uniform drying of the remaining green capsules and ensures complete maturity of all seeds, especially those in the upper parts of the plant. This step is critical for proper seed development and easy threshing.
*   **Threshing:** Once the plants are thoroughly dry, threshing is performed. This usually involves gently beating the dried bundles on a clean tarpaulin, sheet, or concrete floor to release the seeds from the capsules.
*   **Winnowing:** After threshing, the seeds are winnowed to separate them from the chaff, dried leaves, and other debris.
*   **Storage:** The cleaned seeds should be further dried to a safe moisture content (typically 6-8%) before storage to prevent spoilage.
