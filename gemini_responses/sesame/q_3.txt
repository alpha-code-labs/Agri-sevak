As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an integrated approach for managing various rot types in Sesame (*Sesamum indicum*). This involves cultural practices, resistant varieties, and judicious use of CIBRC-approved fungicides.

Many of the listed rot types (Root, Stem, Foot, Collar, Crown, Neck, Black, Seed, and Seedling rot) are often caused by a complex of soil-borne pathogens such as *Macrophomina phaseolina* (charcoal rot), *Sclerotium rolfsii* (southern blight), *Rhizoctonia solani*, *Fusarium spp.*, *Pythium spp.*, and *Phytophthora spp.*. Therefore, control measures often overlap.

**General Cultural and Agronomic Practices (Applicable to most rots):**

*   **Resistant Varieties:** Plant varieties known to have resistance or tolerance to common rot pathogens prevalent in Haryana. Consult HAU recommendations for specific varieties suitable for your region.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice long-term crop rotation (2-3 years) with non-host crops (e.g., cereals like wheat, maize) to reduce pathogen inoculum in the soil. Avoid continuous sesame cultivation or rotation with other susceptible crops like groundnut, soybean, or cotton.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest to reduce overwintering inoculum.
*   **Soil Health and Drainage:** Improve soil drainage, especially in heavy soils, to prevent waterlogging, which favors many rot pathogens. Incorporate organic matter to enhance soil microbial activity.
*   **Sowing Time:** Adjust sowing time to avoid periods of high humidity and temperature that favor disease development.
*   **Seed Quality:** Use certified, disease-free seeds from a reliable source.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure balanced fertilization. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can make plants more susceptible to certain diseases.
*   **Weed Control:** Manage weeds, as they can act as alternate hosts for some pathogens and impede air circulation around the plant base.
*   **Irrigation Management:** Avoid excessive irrigation. If possible, use furrow irrigation instead of overhead irrigation, or irrigate in the morning to allow foliage and soil surface to dry quickly.

**Specific Rot Types and Chemical Control Measures:**

1.  **Root Rot, Stem Rot, Foot Rot, Collar Rot, Crown Rot, Neck Rot, Black Rot (primarily Charcoal Rot):**
    These rots primarily affect the roots, stem base, and lower stem, often leading to wilting, yellowing, and eventual plant death. Charcoal rot (*Macrophomina phaseolina*) is characterized by blackening of internal stem tissues.

    *   **Seed Treatment (Crucial for early protection):**
        *   **Carbendazim** 12% + **Mancozeb** 63% WP at 2-3 g/kg seed.
        *   **Thiram** 75% WS at 2.5-3 g/kg seed.
        *   **Tebuconazole** 2% DS at 1-1.5 g/kg seed.
        *   For oomycete pathogens (*Pythium*, *Phytophthora*):
            *   **Metalaxyl** 35% WS at 2 g/kg seed.
            *   **Metalaxyl-M** 3.3% + **Fludioxonil** 3.3% FS at 1-2 ml/kg seed.
    *   **Soil Drenching (for standing crop, if localized infection is observed):**
        *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 1-2 g/L water (apply 200-250 ml solution per plant around the base).
        *   **Propiconazole** 25% EC at 1 ml/L water.
        *   **Hexaconazole** 5% SC at 2 ml/L water.
        *   For *Sclerotium rolfsii* and *Rhizoctonia solani*:
            *   **Validamycin** 3% L at 2-3 ml/L water.
        *   For *Phytophthora* or *Pythium* related rots:
            *   **Metalaxyl** 8% + **Mancozeb** 64% WP at 2.5 g/L water.
            *   **Propamocarb Hydrochloride** 72.2% SL at 2-3 ml/L water.
    *   **Bio-control:** Application of *Trichoderma viride* or *Trichoderma harzianum* (4 kg/acre mixed with 100 kg farmyard manure, applied at sowing or transplanting) can help suppress soil-borne pathogens.

2.  **Fruit Rot (Capsule Rot):**
    This refers to rot affecting the sesame capsules, often caused by pathogens like *Phytophthora*, *Alternaria*, or *Cercospora*.

    *   **Foliar Spray (if observed):**
        *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP at 2.5 g/L water.
        *   **Chlorothalonil** 75% WP at 2 g/L water.
        *   **Copper Oxychloride** 50% WP at 2.5 g/L water.
        *   For *Phytophthora* related capsule rot:
            *   **Metalaxyl** 8% + **Mancozeb** 64% WP at 2.5 g/L water.

3.  **Seed Rot and Seedling Rot (Damping-off):**
    These are pre- and post-emergence problems, leading to poor germination and seedling death. Caused by *Pythium*, *Rhizoctonia*, *Fusarium*, *Macrophomina*.

    *   **Seed Treatment (Most critical step):**
        *   **Carbendazim** 12% + **Mancozeb** 63% WP at 2-3 g/kg seed.
        *   **Thiram** 75% WS at 2.5-3 g/kg seed.
        *   **Captan** 75% WS at 2.5-3 g/kg seed.
        *   For oomycete pathogens (*Pythium*):
            *   **Metalaxyl** 35% WS at 2 g/kg seed.
            *   **Metalaxyl-M** 3.3% + **Fludioxonil** 3.3% FS at 1-2 ml/kg seed.
    *   **Soil Drenching (if severe seedling rot occurs after emergence):**
        *   **Metalaxyl** 8% + **Mancozeb** 64% WP at 2.5 g/L water (apply around seedling base).
        *   **Propamocarb Hydrochloride** 72.2% SL at 2-3 ml/L water.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and strictly follow the label instructions for any chemical product regarding dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pathogen resistance.
*   Consult with local HAU extension specialists for the most current recommendations and specific product availability in Haryana, as recommendations can be updated based on local disease prevalence and research.
*   An Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining all available methods, is key for sustainable and effective disease control.
