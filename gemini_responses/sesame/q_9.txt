As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling Mites (Red Spider Mite and Rust Mite) in Sesame in Haryana.

Mites, including the Red Spider Mite (Tetranychus urticae) and various species of Rust Mites (Eriophyidae family), are known pests of sesame and can cause significant damage if not managed properly. An integrated pest management (IPM) approach is highly recommended for effective and sustainable control.

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy weeds in and around the sesame field, as many weeds can act as alternate hosts for mites.
*   **Proper Irrigation:** Maintain adequate soil moisture. Water stress can make plants more susceptible to mite infestations. Overhead irrigation can sometimes help dislodge mites from the plant canopy.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can promote lush, succulent growth that is often more attractive to mites.
*   **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect the undersides of leaves for early signs of mite infestation, such as stippling, bronzing, or fine webbing (for red spider mites). Early detection allows for timely intervention.

**2. Biological Control:**
*   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Protect and encourage natural predators of mites, such as predatory mites (e.g., *Amblyseius* species), ladybird beetles, lacewings, and minute pirate bugs. Avoid using broad-spectrum insecticides that can harm these beneficial insects.

**3. Chemical Control (Acaricides):**
When mite populations reach economic threshold levels, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where mites predominantly reside. Use sufficient water volume (typically 200-300 litres per acre) for effective coverage.

Here are some CIBRC approved technical chemical names for mite control in sesame:

*   **Spiromesifen** 22.9% SC: Apply at 125-150 ml per acre.
*   **Propargite** 57% EC: Apply at 500-750 ml per acre.
*   **Fenpyroximate** 5% SC: Apply at 200-300 ml per acre.
*   **Abamectin** 1.9% EC: Apply at 150-200 ml per acre.
*   **Wettable Sulphur** 80% WP: Apply at 1.5-2.0 kg per acre. (This is particularly effective against rust mites and also helps in managing spider mites, especially in early stages, and has fungicidal properties).

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the product label for specific dosages, application methods, and safety precautions.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for the most current recommendations and specific product availability in your region of Haryana.
