As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Sesame (til) in Haryana:

**1. Borers (e.g., Stem Borer, Pod Borer):**
Borers can cause significant damage to sesame by tunneling into stems or pods.
*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Timely sowing and maintaining proper plant spacing.
    *   Removal and destruction of affected plant parts or entire plants to reduce pest inoculum.
    *   Crop rotation with non-host crops.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** 60 ml per acre
    *   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG:** 80-100 g per acre
    *   **Flubendiamide 20% WG:** 50 g per acre
    *   **Indoxacarb 14.5% SC:** 200 ml per acre

**2. Caterpillars (General defoliating caterpillars like Tobacco Caterpillar, Bihar Hairy Caterpillar):**
These caterpillars feed on leaves, causing defoliation.
*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Regular monitoring of fields to detect early infestations.
    *   Hand-picking and destruction of egg masses and early instar larvae, especially for gregarious feeders.
    *   Installation of pheromone traps for monitoring and mass trapping of adult moths (e.g., for *Spodoptera litura*).
*   **Biological Control:**
    *   Application of **Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)** formulations as per manufacturer's recommendations (e.g., 1-2 kg/acre or 1-2 L/acre for liquid formulations).
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** 60 ml per acre
    *   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG:** 80-100 g per acre
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** 200-250 ml per acre
    *   **Quinalphos 25% EC:** 800-1000 ml per acre

**3. Diamondback moth:**
This is not known to affect Sesame. Diamondback moth (*Plutella xylostella*) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops.

**4. Leaf folder (Sesame Leaf Webber/Folder - *Antigastra catalaunalis*):**
The larvae of this pest fold or web leaves together and feed from within, causing significant damage to foliage and sometimes pods.
*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Collection and destruction of webbed leaves containing larvae.
    *   Clean cultivation and removal of crop residues.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** 60 ml per acre
    *   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG:** 80-100 g per acre
    *   **Indoxacarb 14.5% SC:** 200 ml per acre
    *   **Quinalphos 25% EC:** 800-1000 ml per acre

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully, including dosage, timing, and safety precautions.
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
*   Apply insecticides during the cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   Ensure thorough spray coverage for effective control.
