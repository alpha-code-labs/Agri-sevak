As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies in Sesame in Haryana:

**1. Beetles (e.g., Flea Beetles, Blister Beetles, Leaf Beetles):**
These beetles can cause significant defoliation, especially during the early stages of crop growth (flea beetles) or during flowering (blister beetles).

*   **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect plants for feeding damage and the presence of beetles.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   For early infestations, especially flea beetles, consider spraying with:
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC** at 200-250 ml per acre (mixed in 200-250 litres of water).
    *   For general defoliating beetles, including blister beetles, during later stages:
        *   **Quinalphos 25% EC** at 1.0-1.5 litres per acre (mixed in 200-300 litres of water).
        *   **Acephate 75% SP** at 250-500 g per acre (mixed in 200-300 litres of water).

**2. Weevils (e.g., Stem Weevil):**
Stem weevils can bore into the stem, leading to wilting and plant death.

*   **Monitoring:** Look for wilting plants, especially in patches, and inspect the stem for entry holes or larvae.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   At the first sign of infestation, apply a systemic insecticide:
        *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** at 1.0-1.25 litres per acre (mixed in 200-250 litres of water) as a drench around the base of affected plants or as a foliar spray if adult weevils are active.
        *   **Acephate 75% SP** at 250-500 g per acre (mixed in 200-300 litres of water) can also be effective against adult weevils and early larval stages.

**3. Sawflies:**
This is not known to affect Sesame. Sawflies are not considered a significant pest of sesame in Haryana or generally in India.
