As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified cultivation practices for Sesame in Haryana:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   **Row Sowing** is highly recommended over broadcasting. This method facilitates better light penetration, air circulation, and allows for easier intercultivation, weeding, and pest/disease management.
    *   Sow seeds in straight lines using a seed drill or by hand.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   Sesame seeds are small, so a shallow planting depth is crucial for good germination and emergence.
    *   Plant seeds at a depth of **2-3 cm**. Deeper planting can lead to poor or delayed emergence.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   For optimal plant growth and yield, maintain the following spacing:
        *   **Row-to-Row:** **30-45 cm**
        *   **Plant-to-Plant:** **10-15 cm** (after thinning, if necessary, to achieve the desired plant population)

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   The seed rate depends on the sowing method and desired plant stand.
    *   For **Row Sowing:** **2.5 - 3 kg/acre**
    *   For Broadcasting (less preferred): **4 - 5 kg/acre**
