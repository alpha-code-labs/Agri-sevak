Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I am pleased to provide you with the recommended doses of organic manures for Sesame (Til) cultivation in Haryana. Incorporating organic manures is crucial for improving soil health, nutrient availability, and overall crop productivity.

Here are the recommendations:

*   **Farmyard Manure (FYM):**
    *   Apply 5-10 tonnes per acre of well-decomposed FYM.
    *   **Application:** It should be incorporated into the soil during land preparation, at least 2-3 weeks before sowing, to allow for proper decomposition and nutrient release.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   Apply 2-4 tonnes per acre.
    *   **Application:** Similar to FYM, vermicompost should be thoroughly mixed into the soil during the final stages of land preparation before sowing.

*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract based product):**
    *   Sagarika is a plant growth stimulant and nutrient provider, typically available in liquid (foliar spray) and granular (soil application) forms.
    *   **Liquid Sagarika (e.g., Sagarika Z+):**
        *   **Dose:** 2.5-3 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Application:** Apply as a foliar spray.
            *   First spray: 20-25 days after sowing (at the vegetative growth stage).
            *   Second spray: 40-45 days after sowing (at the flowering/pod initiation stage).
    *   **Granular Sagarika (e.g., Sagarika G):**
        *   **Dose:** 8-10 kg per acre.
        *   **Application:** Apply as a basal dose by broadcasting and incorporating into the soil during land preparation or at the time of sowing.

These organic amendments, when used in conjunction with recommended chemical fertilizers (if applicable), will significantly enhance the growth and yield of your Sesame crop. Always ensure the organic manures are well-decomposed to avoid nutrient immobilization and pest issues.
