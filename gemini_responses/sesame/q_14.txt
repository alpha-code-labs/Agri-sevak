As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified strategies for controlling termites and root-knot nematodes in Sesame (Til) in Haryana:

It is crucial to adopt an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods for sustainable control.

### Control of Termites

Termites (e.g., *Odontotermes obesus*, *Microtermes obesi*) can cause significant damage to sesame, especially during germination and early growth stages, leading to wilting and plant death.

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Deep Summer Ploughing:** Exposes termite colonies to the sun and predators, disrupting their habitat.
*   **Removal of Crop Residues:** Clear fields of stubble, weeds, and other organic debris that can serve as food sources or shelter for termites.
*   **Avoidance of Organic Matter Accumulation:** Do not allow large quantities of undecomposed organic matter near the plants, as this can attract termites.

**2. Chemical Control:**
*   **Seed Treatment (for early protection):**
    *   Treat seeds with **Imidacloprid 600 FS** at 5-7 ml per kg of seed before sowing. This provides systemic protection to young seedlings against termites and other sucking pests.
*   **Soil Application (at sowing or pre-sowing):**
    *   Apply **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** at 2.5 litres per acre. Mix the required quantity with 50-100 kg of dry sand or soil and broadcast evenly over the field before the last ploughing, or apply in irrigation water.
    *   Alternatively, apply **Fipronil 0.3% GR** at 6-8 kg per acre by broadcasting and incorporating it into the soil at the time of sowing.

### Control of Nematodes (Root-knot)

Root-knot nematodes (*Meloidogyne* spp.) are a major concern in sesame, causing characteristic galls on roots, stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, and significant yield reduction.

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate sesame with non-host crops like cereals (e.g., wheat, maize, sorghum) for at least 2-3 years to reduce nematode populations in the soil.
*   **Summer Ploughing:** Deep ploughing during hot summer months exposes nematode eggs and larvae to desiccation and solar radiation, reducing their numbers.
*   **Incorporation of Organic Matter:** Apply well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost. Neem cake (powdered form) can be highly effective when incorporated into the soil at 200-400 kg per acre, 2-3 weeks before sowing. Neem cake releases compounds that are toxic to nematodes and also enhances beneficial soil microbes.
*   **Use of Resistant Varieties:** While specific resistant sesame varieties for Haryana are limited, consult HAU for any newly released varieties with nematode tolerance.

**2. Chemical Control (Soil Application at Sowing):**
*   Apply **Carbofuran 3% G** at 10-13 kg per acre in furrows at the time of sowing. Ensure proper mixing with the soil to avoid direct contact with seeds.
*   Alternatively, apply **Phorate 10% G** at 4 kg per acre in furrows at the time of sowing. (Note: Phorate is highly toxic and should be handled with extreme care, strictly following safety guidelines).

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully, including dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Consult your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and current pest pressure.
