Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I understand your concern regarding the potential harmful effects of weedicides/herbicides on sesame (til) crops. Sesame is known to be sensitive to many herbicides, especially post-emergence applications. The best approach to reduce harm is through stringent preventive measures and, if injury occurs, timely mitigation.

Here's how you can reduce the harmful effects of weedicides/herbicides in sesame:

**I. Prevention is Paramount (Most Effective Strategy)**

1.  **Correct Herbicide Selection:**
    *   Always choose herbicides specifically registered and recommended for sesame cultivation in Haryana by HAU or CIBRC.
    *   For sesame, pre-emergence herbicides are generally safer and more effective than post-emergence options. Post-emergence herbicides can cause significant phytotoxicity.
    *   Examples of commonly used pre-emergence herbicides (always check current HAU recommendations for specific doses and approval for sesame):
        *   **Pendimethalin**
        *   **Oxyfluorfen**
    *   Ensure the selected herbicide targets the specific weed spectrum prevalent in your field.

2.  **Accurate Dosage:**
    *   Strictly adhere to the recommended dose (active ingredient per unit area) as specified by HAU or on the herbicide label.
    *   Overdosing is a primary cause of crop injury (phytotoxicity).
    *   Underdosing can lead to poor weed control and promote herbicide resistance.

3.  **Timely Application:**
    *   **Pre-emergence herbicides:** Apply within 0-3 days after sowing (DAS) on moist soil. Delaying application can reduce efficacy and increase the risk of crop injury if sesame seeds have already germinated.
    *   **Post-emergence herbicides:** *Exercise extreme caution.* If any post-emergence herbicide is recommended (which is rare for sesame due to its sensitivity), apply it precisely at the recommended crop and weed growth stage (e.g., 2-4 leaf stage of weeds). Applying too early or too late can severely damage the crop.

4.  **Proper Application Technique:**
    *   **Sprayer Calibration:** Calibrate your sprayer accurately before each application to ensure uniform coverage and correct delivery rate.
    *   **Nozzle Selection:** Use appropriate nozzles (e.g., flat fan nozzles) for uniform spray distribution and minimal drift.
    *   **Water Volume:** Use the recommended water volume (e.g., 300-500 L/acre) for thorough coverage.
    *   **Uniform Coverage:** Ensure even spray distribution across the entire field. Avoid overlapping spray passes or leaving untreated strips.
    *   **Wind Speed:** Avoid spraying during high wind speeds (above 10 km/h) to prevent herbicide drift to non-target crops or uneven application within the field.

5.  **Favorable Environmental Conditions:**
    *   **Soil Moisture:** Pre-emergence herbicides require adequate soil moisture for activation and effective weed control. Apply on moist soil.
    *   **Temperature:** Avoid application during extreme temperatures (very hot or very cold) as this can increase crop stress and herbicide uptake, leading to injury.
    *   **Rainfall:** Check the rainfastness period for post-emergence herbicides. For pre-emergence, avoid heavy rainfall immediately after application as it can lead to leaching and potential crop injury.

6.  **Consider Soil Type:**
    *   Herbicide persistence and availability can vary with soil type. For instance, sandy soils have lower adsorption capacity, which can increase the risk of leaching and crop injury with some herbicides. Adjust doses if specific recommendations are provided for different soil types.

7.  **Water Quality:**
    *   Hard water can sometimes reduce the efficacy of certain herbicides. If using hard water, consider adding recommended water conditioners or adjuvants as per label instructions.

8.  **Adjuvants:**
    *   Use recommended adjuvants (e.g., non-ionic surfactants) only when specified on the herbicide label and at the correct rate. Incorrect use of adjuvants can also cause phytotoxicity.

**II. Mitigation Strategies (If Herbicide Injury Occurs)**

If, despite preventive measures, your sesame crop shows signs of herbicide injury (e.g., yellowing, stunted growth, leaf malformation), you can try the following to help the crop recover:

1.  **Immediate Irrigation:**
    *   If the injury is from a soil-applied herbicide, a light irrigation can help leach the herbicide away from the root zone, diluting its concentration and reducing further uptake by the plant.

2.  **Nutrient Management (Foliar Application):**
    *   Provide balanced nutrition to help the plant recover from stress and promote new growth. Foliar application of water-soluble fertilizers can provide quick relief.
    *   Spray a 0.5-1.0% solution of **Urea** or **DAP** (Diammonium Phosphate) or **Potassium Nitrate** to provide essential macro-nutrients.
    *   If micronutrient deficiency symptoms appear, apply a foliar spray of a recommended micronutrient mixture containing **Zinc**, **Iron**, **Manganese**, and **Boron**. For example, a 0.2-0.5% solution of **Zinc Sulphate** or **Ferrous Sulphate**.

3.  **Biostimulants:**
    *   Application of certain biostimulants like seaweed extracts, humic acids, or amino acid formulations can help plants cope with stress, enhance nutrient uptake, and promote recovery. Follow manufacturer's recommendations for dosage.

4.  **Avoid Further Stress:**
    *   During the recovery period, protect the crop from other stresses such as water scarcity, severe nutrient deficiencies, or pest and disease attacks. Ensure optimal growing conditions.

Always consult with your local HAU extension specialist or Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) for the most current and specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and the latest CIBRC approved products for sesame in Haryana.
