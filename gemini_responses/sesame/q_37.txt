Wild animals, including birds (e.g., parrots, sparrows) and mammals (e.g., wild boars, nilgai, deer, rodents), can cause significant damage to sesame crops, especially during the pod formation and maturity stages. Protecting sesame from wild animals primarily involves physical barriers and deterrents, as chemical repellents are generally not practical or widely approved for this purpose on food crops in India.

Here are the recommended methods:

1.  **Physical Barriers:**
    *   **Fencing:**
        *   **Barbed Wire Fencing:** Install a robust multi-strand barbed wire fence around the field. This can deter larger mammals like nilgai and wild boars. Regular inspection and maintenance are crucial.
        *   **Electric Fencing:** Low-cost, solar-powered electric fences can be highly effective against a range of animals. However, ensure that installation complies with local safety regulations and requires necessary permissions.
        *   **Netting:** For bird protection, especially in smaller plots, bird netting can be installed over the crop during the vulnerable stages of pod development and maturity.
    *   **Trenching:** Digging a deep trench (e.g., 1-1.5 meters deep) around the field can deter wild boars from entering, especially when combined with a fence.

2.  **Scare Tactics and Deterrents:**
    *   **Scarecrows:** Traditional scarecrows can be effective for a short period. To prevent habituation, regularly change their location, appearance, and clothing.
    *   **Noise Makers:** Use devices like gas guns (with caution and adherence to local regulations), firecrackers (sparingly and legally), or traditional drums to scare away birds and some mammals. Deploy these intermittently to prevent animals from getting used to the noise.
    *   **Reflective Devices:** Hang old CDs, reflective tapes, or shiny objects around the field. The flashes of light and movement can deter birds.
    *   **Human Presence:** Employing field guards, especially during critical periods (early morning and late evening when animals are most active), is one of the most effective methods to deter animals.

3.  **Habitat Management:**
    *   **Weed Control:** Keep the field and surrounding areas free of weeds and tall grasses. These can provide cover for rodents and other small animals, making them less visible and harder to deter.
    *   **Remove Attractants:** Avoid leaving harvested crop residues or other food sources near the field that might attract animals.

4.  **Community-Based Approaches:**
    *   **Coordinated Efforts:** Work with neighboring farmers to implement protection strategies across a larger area. Individual efforts might only shift the problem to adjacent fields.

**Regarding Chemical Repellents:**
There are no widely recommended or CIBRC-approved chemical repellents specifically for wild animals (mammals like nilgai, wild boar, or deer) on sesame crops in India that are practical, cost-effective, and safe for food crops. For birds, while some repellents exist, their efficacy on sesame and CIBRC approval for this specific use would need to be confirmed, and physical methods are generally preferred.
