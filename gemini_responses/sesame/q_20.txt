Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the critical role of micronutrients in achieving optimal yield and quality in Sesame (Til). Deficiencies can significantly impact plant health and productivity. It is crucial to first confirm any suspected deficiency through soil and/or plant tissue analysis, as visual symptoms can sometimes be misleading.

Here's how to address common micronutrient deficiencies in Sesame:

### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, small leaves (often called 'little leaf'), interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, and sometimes bronzing of older leaves.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** For quick correction in standing crops, spray with a 0.5% solution of **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** (5 g/L of water) or a 0.1% solution of **Zinc EDTA** (1 g/L of water). Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, starting from 30-40 days after sowing.
    *   **Soil Application:** As a preventive measure or for severe deficiencies, apply 10-25 kg/acre of **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** as a basal application before sowing.

### 2. Iron (Fe) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Pronounced interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, which may turn almost white in severe cases, while veins remain green. Growth is often stunted.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray with a 0.5-1.0% solution of **Ferrous Sulphate Heptahydrate** (5-10 g/L of water) or a 0.1% solution of **Iron EDTA** (1 g/L of water). Apply 2-3 sprays at 7-10 day intervals, especially during the vegetative growth phase.
    *   **Soil Application:** In Haryana's alkaline soils, soil application of iron is often less effective due to rapid fixation. However, if recommended by soil test, 10-20 kg/acre of **Ferrous Sulphate Heptahydrate** can be applied.

### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, distorted and thickened new leaves, cracking of stems, poor flowering, reduced fruit (capsule) set, and sometimes hollow stems.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray with a 0.1-0.2% solution of **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (1-2 g/L of water) or a 0.2-0.3% solution of **Borax (Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate)** (2-3 g/L of water). Apply at pre-flowering and early flowering stages.
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 1-2 kg/acre of **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** or 2-4 kg/acre of **Borax (Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate)** as a basal application. *Caution: Boron can be toxic if over-applied, so precise application based on soil test is critical.*

### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, distortion and necrosis (death) of young leaves and growing points, poor root development, and sometimes blossom end rot-like symptoms on capsules (though less common in sesame).
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray with a 0.5-1.0% solution of **Calcium Nitrate** (5-10 g/L of water) or **Calcium Chloride** (5-10 g/L of water). Apply during active growth and flowering stages.
    *   **Soil Application:** If soil tests indicate low calcium and/or acidic soil, apply **Gypsum (Calcium Sulphate Dihydrate)** or **Calcium Carbonate (Lime)** as per soil test recommendations.

### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, starting from the leaf margins and progressing inwards, often giving a 'herringbone' pattern. Leaves may become brittle and sometimes develop reddish-purple tints.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray with a 0.5-1.0% solution of **Magnesium Sulphate Heptahydrate** (5-10 g/L of water). Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, starting when symptoms appear.
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 10-20 kg/acre of **Magnesium Sulphate Heptahydrate** as a basal application.

### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, similar to iron deficiency but often with a finer network of green veins. In severe cases, small necrotic (dead) spots may appear on the yellowed areas.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray with a 0.5% solution of **Manganese Sulphate Monohydrate** (5 g/L of water) or a 0.1% solution of **Manganese EDTA** (1 g/L of water). Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, starting when symptoms are observed.
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 5-10 kg/acre of **Manganese Sulphate Monohydrate** as a basal application, especially in soils with high pH.

**General Recommendations:**

*   **Soil Testing is Key:** Always conduct a soil test before applying any micronutrients to determine the exact deficiency and avoid over-application, which can lead to toxicity.
*   **Timing of Foliar Sprays:** Apply foliar sprays during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late afternoon) to prevent leaf scorching and maximize absorption.
*   **Water Quality:** Use clean water for preparing spray solutions.
*   **Adjuvants:** Adding a good quality spreading agent (sticker) to the spray solution can improve the efficacy of foliar applications.
