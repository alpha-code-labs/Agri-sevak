As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in Sesame (Til) in Haryana:

### Grasshopper Control in Sesame

Grasshoppers can cause significant damage to sesame, especially during the seedling stage by feeding on leaves and tender shoots.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Grasshoppers:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Deep ploughing after harvest helps expose and destroy grasshopper eggs laid in the soil.
    *   Maintain field sanitation by removing weeds and crop residues that can serve as breeding grounds or shelter.
*   **Chemical Control (if infestation is severe):**
    *   **Malathion** 50% EC: 1.25 L per acre in 500 litres of water.
    *   **Quinalphos** 25% EC: 1.0 L per acre in 500 litres of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: 200 ml per acre in 200-300 litres of water.

### Painted Bug Control in Sesame

This is not known to affect Sesame. Painted bug (Bagrada hilaris) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops like mustard, radish, and cabbage.

### Red Cotton Bug Control in Sesame

Red cotton bug (Dysdercus cingulatus) can infest sesame, particularly feeding on developing seeds and capsules, leading to poor seed quality and yield loss.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Red Cotton Bug:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Field sanitation and removal of cotton plant residues or other alternate host plants from the vicinity of sesame fields can reduce pest populations.
    *   Early sowing can sometimes help escape peak pest incidence.
*   **Chemical Control (if infestation is severe, especially during capsule formation):**
    *   **Malathion** 50% EC: 1.25 L per acre in 500 litres of water.
    *   **Quinalphos** 25% EC: 1.0 L per acre in 500 litres of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: 200 ml per acre in 200-300 litres of water.

### Black Ants Control in Sesame

This is not known to affect Sesame as a direct pest. Black ants are generally not considered direct pests of sesame. Their presence in the field is often associated with other sucking pests (like aphids or whiteflies) from which they collect honeydew, or they may be scavengers. Control measures are typically not required for ants themselves in sesame. If they are farming other pests, the primary focus should be on controlling the honeydew-producing pest.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully, including dosage, application method, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during pesticide application.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension officers for the most current and specific recommendations for your region and crop stage.
