As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide scientifically verified advice regarding rust diseases in Sesame (Til) in Haryana.

It is important to clarify that the specific rust diseases you mentioned (Black, Brown, Yellow, White, and Red rust) are generally not known to affect Sesame. The actual rust disease that commonly affects Sesame in India is caused by fungi such as *Uromyces appendiculatus* or *Puccinia sesami*.

Here is a breakdown of the specific rust types you mentioned:

*   **Black Rust (Stem Rust)**: This is not known to affect Sesame. It primarily affects cereal crops like wheat, barley, and rye.
*   **Brown Rust (Leaf Rust)**: This is not known to affect Sesame. It primarily affects cereal crops like wheat and barley.
*   **Yellow Rust (Stripe Rust)**: This is not known to affect Sesame. It primarily affects cereal crops like wheat and barley.
*   **White Rust**: This is not known to affect Sesame. White rust, caused by *Albugo* species, primarily affects cruciferous crops (like mustard) and spinach.
*   **Red Rust**: This is not known to affect Sesame. "Red rust" often refers to an algal disease (*Cephaleuros virescens*) in crops like tea or coffee, or is a colloquial term for other rusts.

If you are observing rust-like symptoms on your Sesame crop, it is most likely the specific Sesame rust caused by *Uromyces appendiculatus* or *Puccinia sesami*. Here are the recommended control measures for this disease:

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Sesame Rust:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available and suitable for Haryana, choose rust-resistant Sesame varieties.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting Sesame in the same field year after year. Rotate with non-host crops to break the disease cycle.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest to reduce the source of inoculum for the next season.
    *   **Proper Spacing:** Maintain adequate plant spacing to improve air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce humidity and disease development.
    *   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure balanced fertilization, as excessive nitrogen can sometimes make plants more susceptible to diseases.

2.  **Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
    Fungicides should be applied preventatively or at the first appearance of symptoms for effective control. Always follow label instructions for dosage and safety.

    *   **Propiconazole 25% EC:**
        *   Dosage: 125 ml per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water.
        *   Application: Apply at the appearance of rust symptoms and repeat if necessary, typically at 10-15 day intervals.

    *   **Difenoconazole 25% EC:**
        *   Dosage: 100 ml per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water.
        *   Application: Apply at the appearance of rust symptoms.

    *   **Tebuconazole 25.9% EC:**
        *   Dosage: 250 ml per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water.
        *   Application: Apply at the appearance of rust symptoms.

    *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:**
        *   Dosage: 200 ml per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water.
        *   Application: Apply at the appearance of rust symptoms.

    *   **Mancozeb 75% WP:** (Contact fungicide, often used preventatively or in early stages)
        *   Dosage: 600-800 g per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water.
        *   Application: Apply preventatively or at the very early stages of disease development.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always consult the specific product label for the most accurate and up-to-date recommendations for Sesame in your region.
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of fungicide resistance.
*   For accurate diagnosis and specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions, it is always advisable to consult with HAU extension specialists.
