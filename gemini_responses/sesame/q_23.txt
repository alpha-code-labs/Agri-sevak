As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified seed and soil treatment processes for Sesame (Til) cultivation in Haryana:

### Seed Treatment Process for Sesame

Seed treatment is crucial for protecting young seedlings from seed-borne and early-season soil-borne diseases and insect pests, ensuring better germination and stand establishment.

*   **For Fungal Disease Protection (Damping-off, Root Rot, Seed-borne diseases):**
    *   **Option 1 (Chemical Fungicide):** Treat seeds with a combination fungicide like **Carbendazim** 12% + **Mancozeb** 63% WP @ 2.5 grams per kilogram (g/kg) of seed.
    *   **Option 2 (Bio-fungicide):** For an organic or integrated approach, treat seeds with **Trichoderma viride** (or **Trichoderma harzianum**) @ 4-5 g/kg of seed.
    *   **Process:** Mix the required quantity of the chosen fungicide with a small amount of water to form a slurry. Coat the sesame seeds evenly with this slurry. Spread the treated seeds in a thin layer on a clean surface and allow them to dry in the shade before sowing.

*   **For Early Season Insect Pest Protection (Sucking Pests like Aphids, Jassids, Thrips):**
    *   **Option 1 (Systemic Insecticide):** Treat seeds with **Imidacloprid** 70% WS @ 5-7 g/kg of seed.
    *   **Option 2 (Systemic Insecticide):** Alternatively, use **Thiamethoxam** 30% FS @ 4-5 ml/kg of seed.
    *   **Process:** If using both fungicide and insecticide, apply the fungicide first, allow it to dry, and then apply the insecticide. Ensure uniform coating of the seeds. Dry the seeds in shade before sowing.

### Soil Treatment Process for Sesame

Soil treatment aims to manage soil-borne diseases, insect pests, and weeds, providing a healthy environment for crop growth.

*   **For Soil-borne Disease Management (Root Rot, Wilt):**
    *   **Bio-fungicide Application:** Mix 2.5 kilograms (kg) of **Trichoderma viride** (or **Trichoderma harzianum**) with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost. Keep this mixture moist under shade for 7-10 days, turning it occasionally to ensure proper multiplication of the bio-agent. Broadcast this enriched FYM evenly over 1 acre of land before the last ploughing or at the time of sowing and incorporate it into the soil.

*   **For Termite and White Grub Management (if there is a history of infestation in the field):**
    *   **Insecticide Application:** Apply **Fipronil** 0.3% GR (Granular) @ 10-15 kg per acre. Broadcast the granules uniformly over the soil surface at the time of the last ploughing or before sowing, and then incorporate them into the soil.

*   **For Pre-emergence Weed Management:**
    *   **Herbicide Application:** Apply **Pendimethalin** 30% EC @ 1.0-1.25 Litres (L) per acre. Spray uniformly on the soil surface within 0-3 days after sowing. Ensure adequate soil moisture at the time of application for effective weed control.
