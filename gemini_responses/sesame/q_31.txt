As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned conditions in Sesame (Til):

**1. Fruit Bursting (Capsule Dehiscence)**
This is a significant issue in sesame, leading to considerable yield losses, especially in traditional varieties. It is primarily influenced by genetic factors and environmental conditions.

*   **Varietal Selection:** Choose improved, indehiscent or semi-dehiscent varieties that are less prone to capsule shattering upon maturity. HAU recommends varieties suitable for Haryana that exhibit reduced dehiscence.
*   **Irrigation Management:** Maintain consistent soil moisture, especially during capsule development. Avoid sudden fluctuations between drought and heavy irrigation, which can induce bursting.
*   **Timely Harvesting:** Harvest the crop at the physiological maturity stage (when 75-80% of the capsules turn yellow and leaves start shedding) to minimize pre-harvest shattering. Delaying harvest, especially during dry, windy conditions, increases bursting.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure balanced nutrition, particularly adequate potassium, which plays a role in cell wall integrity and stress tolerance. Apply recommended doses of fertilizers based on soil test reports.

**2. Leaf Burning/Melting**
This condition is typically a symptom of abiotic stress (environmental factors) or chemical phytotoxicity rather than a specific disease.

*   **Water Management:** Ensure adequate and timely irrigation, especially during hot and dry periods, to prevent water stress. Avoid both drought and waterlogging.
*   **Heat Stress Mitigation:** In areas prone to extreme heat, consider planting heat-tolerant varieties. Practices like mulching can help conserve soil moisture and moderate soil temperature, indirectly reducing leaf stress.
*   **Proper Chemical Application:** If leaf burning is due to chemical phytotoxicity (e.g., herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, or foliar fertilizers), ensure:
    *   Correct dosage and concentration are used.
    *   Application is done during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening).
    *   Compatibility of tank-mixes is checked.
    *   Sprayer calibration is accurate.
*   **Nutrient Balance:** Ensure the crop receives balanced nutrients. Deficiencies or toxicities of certain micronutrients can sometimes manifest as leaf discoloration or necrosis.

**3. Hardness in Fruit**
This is not known to affect Sesame as a problematic condition requiring control. Sesame capsules naturally harden as they mature and dry, which is a normal part of the plant's development cycle. If this refers to difficulty in threshing, it might be a characteristic of certain indehiscent varieties, which are specifically bred to prevent capsule bursting and may require mechanical threshing.
