Wilt, primarily caused by the soil-borne fungus *Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. sesami*, and Parawilt, a physiological disorder often associated with sudden changes in soil moisture or waterlogging, are significant challenges in Sesame (Til) cultivation in Haryana. Effective management requires an integrated approach combining cultural practices, resistant varieties, and appropriate seed treatments.

Here's how to control Wilt and Parawilt in Sesame:

**Integrated Management Strategies for Wilt and Parawilt in Sesame:**

1.  **Resistant Varieties:**
    *   Cultivate wilt-resistant varieties recommended by Haryana Agricultural University for your specific agro-climatic zone. This is the most sustainable and effective long-term solution.

2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Practice a 2-3 year crop rotation with non-host crops such as cereals (e.g., Pearl Millet, Sorghum) or legumes (e.g., Mungbean, Guar) to reduce the build-up of soil-borne inoculum.
    *   **Soil Health Management:** Improve soil drainage and structure by incorporating well-decomposed organic matter (farmyard manure, compost) at 5-10 tonnes/acre. This helps in better aeration and water infiltration, reducing conditions favorable for both wilt and parawilt.
    *   **Timely Sowing:** Sow sesame at the optimal time to avoid periods of extreme environmental stress, which can predispose plants to wilt and parawilt.
    *   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure adequate and balanced nutrient supply to enhance plant vigor and natural resistance. Avoid excessive nitrogen application, which can make plants more susceptible.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris from the field to reduce inoculum sources.
    *   **Avoid Root Injury:** Minimize root damage during intercultural operations (e.g., weeding, hoeing), as wounds can provide entry points for pathogens.
    *   **Soil Solarization:** In fields with a history of severe wilt, practice soil solarization during the hot summer months (May-June) for 4-6 weeks by covering moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets. This helps in reducing soil-borne pathogen populations.

3.  **Seed Treatment (for Wilt Prevention):**
    *   Treat seeds before sowing with recommended fungicides or bio-agents to protect against early infection and reduce primary inoculum.
        *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 1.0-1.5 g/kg seed.
        *   **Thiram** 75% WS at 2.0-2.5 g/kg seed.
        *   Alternatively, treat with a bio-fungicide: **Trichoderma viride** (or *Trichoderma harzianum*) at 4-6 g/kg seed.

4.  **Soil Application (for Wilt Management):**
    *   In fields with a history of severe wilt, soil application of bio-agents can be beneficial.
        *   Mix **Trichoderma viride** (or *Trichoderma harzianum*) formulation (2.5 kg/acre) with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed farmyard manure or compost and apply uniformly to the soil before sowing or at the time of last ploughing.

5.  **Water Management (Crucial for Parawilt):**
    *   Ensure proper field drainage to prevent water stagnation and waterlogging, which are primary triggers for parawilt.
    *   Irrigate judiciously, avoiding both prolonged water stress and over-irrigation. Parawilt is often triggered by sudden changes in soil moisture, especially after heavy rainfall following a dry spell, or prolonged waterlogging.
    *   If parawilt symptoms appear due to waterlogging, improve drainage immediately. If due to sudden moisture stress, provide light and timely irrigation to stabilize soil moisture.
