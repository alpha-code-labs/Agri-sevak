As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the use of Growth Regulators/Hormones in Sesame (Til) cultivation in Haryana:

It is crucial to use plant growth regulators judiciously and only when specifically recommended, as incorrect application can lead to adverse effects.

1.  **Ethephon (formerly known by brand name Ethrel)**
    *   **Recommendation for Growth Regulation in Sesame:** Ethephon is primarily known for its role in fruit ripening, flower induction, or defoliation in various crops. However, its use as a general growth regulator for enhancing yield in Sesame is **not a standard or widely recommended practice** in Haryana. There are no established recommendations for its application as a growth regulator for yield enhancement in Sesame in the region.

2.  **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D)**
    *   **Recommendation for Growth Regulation in Sesame:** 2,4-D is a potent selective herbicide used to control broadleaf weeds. While auxins (like 2,4-D) can act as growth regulators at extremely low concentrations, applying 2,4-D to a broadleaf crop like Sesame is **highly risky and strongly discouraged** as a growth regulator. Even minute overdoses can cause severe phytotoxicity, leading to crop damage or complete failure.
    *   **This is not recommended as a growth regulator for Sesame.**

3.  **Boron**
    *   **Recommendation for Sesame:** Boron is an essential micronutrient critical for flowering, pollen viability, fertilization, and seed development in Sesame. Deficiency can lead to poor flower and seed set, resulting in reduced yields.
    *   **Recommended Dose and Application:**
        *   **Foliar Spray:** Apply **0.2% Boron** solution (e.g., **2 g of Borax** or **1.5 g of Solubor** per litre of water).
        *   **Timing:** Spray twice:
            *   First spray at the **pre-flowering stage** (around 30-35 days after sowing).
            *   Second spray 10-15 days after the first spray, during the **peak flowering stage**.
        *   **Method:** Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage. Use sufficient water volume (e.g., 200-250 litres per acre) to achieve good spray coverage.
    *   **Note:** Boron application is particularly beneficial in soils known to be deficient in Boron or when deficiency symptoms (e.g., poor flowering, flower drop) are observed. Soil application of Boron (e.g., 1-2 kg Borax per acre) can also be done at the time of sowing in severely deficient soils, but foliar application is often more efficient for immediate correction during critical growth stages.

Always ensure to use CIBRC approved products and follow the manufacturer's instructions on the label for safe and effective application.
