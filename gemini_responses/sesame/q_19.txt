Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the critical importance of balanced nutrition for optimal sesame (til) yield and quality. Addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium) effectively requires a scientific approach, ideally starting with a comprehensive soil test.

**General Recommendation:**
Always conduct a soil test before sowing to determine the exact nutrient status of your field. This allows for precise fertilizer recommendations, preventing both deficiencies and wasteful over-application. The following recommendations are general guidelines for sesame cultivation in Haryana, assuming a moderate fertility status.

### Addressing Nitrogen (N) Deficiency in Sesame

Nitrogen is crucial for vegetative growth, leaf development, and overall plant vigour.
**Symptoms:** General yellowing of older leaves, stunted growth, reduced branching, and pale green foliage.

**Corrective Measures:**
*   **Basal Application:** Apply 15-20 kg N per acre at the time of sowing.
    *   Use **Urea** (46% N) at a rate of approximately 32-43 kg per acre as basal.
*   **Top Dressing:** Apply the remaining 15-20 kg N per acre as a top dressing around 25-30 days after sowing (DAS) or at the initiation of flowering, depending on plant vigour and soil test results.
    *   Use **Urea** (46% N) at a rate of approximately 32-43 kg per acre as top dressing.
*   **Foliar Application (for quick relief in observed deficiency):** If deficiency symptoms appear after basal application, a foliar spray can provide quick relief.
    *   Spray 2% solution of **Urea** (20 g of **Urea** per litre of water). Apply 200-300 litres of spray solution per acre, ensuring good leaf coverage. Repeat after 10-15 days if symptoms persist.

### Addressing Phosphorus (P) Deficiency in Sesame

Phosphorus is vital for root development, flowering, seed formation, and energy transfer within the plant.
**Symptoms:** Stunted growth, dark green or purplish discoloration of leaves (especially on the underside), delayed maturity, and poor seed set.

**Corrective Measures:**
*   **Basal Application:** Phosphorus is less mobile in the soil, so it is crucial to apply the entire recommended dose as a basal application at the time of sowing.
    *   Apply 20-30 kg P2O5 per acre.
    *   Use **Single Superphosphate** (16% P2O5) at a rate of approximately 125-188 kg per acre.
    *   Alternatively, use **Diammonium Phosphate** (18% N, 46% P2O5) at a rate of approximately 43-65 kg per acre. (Adjust N application accordingly if using DAP).
*   **Foliar Application (for quick relief in observed deficiency):** For mild to moderate deficiencies observed after basal application, a foliar spray can be considered.
    *   Spray 0.5-1% solution of **Monoammonium Phosphate** (5-10 g of **Monoammonium Phosphate** per litre of water). Apply 200-300 litres of spray solution per acre.

### Addressing Potassium (K) Deficiency in Sesame

Potassium plays a crucial role in water regulation, disease resistance, photosynthesis, and overall plant strength, leading to better seed filling.
**Symptoms:** Yellowing and browning (scorching) of leaf margins, especially on older leaves, weak stems, poor seed development, and increased susceptibility to diseases.

**Corrective Measures:**
*   **Basal Application:** Apply the entire recommended dose of Potassium as a basal application at the time of sowing.
    *   Apply 20-30 kg K2O per acre.
    *   Use **Muriate of Potash** (Potassium Chloride, 60% K2O) at a rate of approximately 33-50 kg per acre.
    *   Alternatively, use **Sulphate of Potash** (Potassium Sulphate, 50% K2O) at a rate of approximately 40-60 kg per acre.
*   **Foliar Application (for quick relief in observed deficiency):** For mild to moderate deficiencies observed after basal application, a foliar spray can be beneficial.
    *   Spray 0.5-1% solution of **Muriate of Potash** (Potassium Chloride) or **Sulphate of Potash** (Potassium Sulphate) (5-10 g of fertilizer per litre of water). Apply 200-300 litres of spray solution per acre.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Integrated Nutrient Management (INM):** Always combine chemical fertilizers with organic manures (Farm Yard Manure, compost, vermicompost) to improve soil health and nutrient use efficiency.
*   **Application Method:** Ensure uniform application of fertilizers. For basal application, incorporate fertilizers into the soil before sowing.
*   **Irrigation:** Adequate soil moisture is essential for nutrient uptake. Ensure proper irrigation practices, especially after fertilizer application.
*   **Timing:** Apply fertilizers at the correct growth stages for maximum benefit.
