As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide the following scientifically verified information regarding specialized practices in Sesame (Til) cultivation relevant to Haryana:

*   **Pruning:** Pruning, in the sense of removing specific plant parts to manage growth or yield, is **not a standard or recommended practice for Sesame**. Sesame is an annual crop primarily grown for its seeds, and its growth habit does not typically benefit from pruning.
*   **Desuckering:** Desuckering, which involves removing basal shoots or suckers, is **not a relevant practice for Sesame**. Sesame plants do not produce suckers in a manner that requires desuckering.
*   **Mulching:** Mulching can be a beneficial practice in Sesame cultivation, especially in regions like Haryana, to conserve soil moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature.
    *   **Organic Mulches:** Crop residues like wheat straw, paddy straw, or even dried leaves can be used. They decompose over time, adding organic matter to the soil.
    *   **Plastic Mulches:** Black or silver plastic mulches can be used, particularly in high-value cultivation or where water conservation is critical. They are highly effective in weed control and moisture retention.
*   **Grafting:** Grafting is a technique used to join parts of two plants. It is **not a known or practical practice for Sesame**. Sesame is an annual crop propagated by seeds, and grafting is not employed in its cultivation.
*   **Pollination:** Sesame flowers are primarily **self-pollinated**. However, some degree of cross-pollination can occur, mainly facilitated by insects like bees. There is no need for specialized human intervention or managed pollination services for successful seed set in Sesame.
