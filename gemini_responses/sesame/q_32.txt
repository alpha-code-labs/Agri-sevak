Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding the "drying up" of sesame plants, which manifests as drying branches, leaves, fruits, and flowers. This is a general symptom that can be caused by various factors, both biotic (diseases, pests) and abiotic (environmental stress). Accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective management.

Here's a comprehensive approach to address this issue:

**I. Potential Biotic Causes (Diseases):**

Several fungal and bacterial diseases can lead to wilting and drying symptoms in sesame.

*   **A. Macrophomina Stem/Root Rot (Charcoal Rot):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Plants show sudden wilting and drying, often in patches. The stem base turns black, and the bark shreds, revealing black sclerotia (tiny black dots) and charcoal-like discoloration inside the stem. Roots also rot.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural Practices:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops (e.g., cereals). Ensure proper field sanitation and remove infected plant debris. Maintain optimal soil moisture; avoid water stress.
        *   **Chemical Control (Seed Treatment):** Treat seeds before sowing with:
            *   **Carbendazim 50% WP** at 1-2 g/kg seed.
            *   **Thiram 75% WS** at 2-3 g/kg seed.

*   **B. Phytophthora Blight/Stem Rot:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Characterized by water-soaked lesions on stems, leaves, and pods, which rapidly expand, leading to wilting, stem rot, and collapse of the entire plant. Often severe under high humidity and waterlogged conditions.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural Practices:** Ensure good field drainage and avoid waterlogging. Plant on raised beds in areas prone to waterlogging. Practice crop rotation.
        *   **Chemical Control (Seed Treatment):** Treat seeds with:
            *   **Metalaxyl-M 31.8% ES** at 3-4 ml/kg seed.
        *   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray/Soil Drench):** For early stages or as a preventive measure in susceptible areas:
            *   **Metalaxyl-M 31.8% ES** at 1 ml/L water (foliar spray).
            *   **Propamocarb Hydrochloride 72.2% SL** at 2.5 ml/L water (soil drench around affected plants).

*   **C. Fusarium Wilt:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Plants show yellowing of lower leaves, followed by wilting and drying, often affecting one side of the plant first. If the stem is split, vascular discoloration (brownish streaks) can be observed.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural Practices:** Use resistant or tolerant varieties if available. Practice long crop rotations (3-4 years) with non-host crops. Maintain good field sanitation.
        *   **Chemical Control (Seed Treatment):** Treat seeds with:
            *   **Carbendazim 50% WP** at 1-2 g/kg seed.

*   **D. Bacterial Blight/Leaf Spot:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Initially, small, water-soaked spots appear on leaves, which enlarge and become angular, often delimited by veins. These lesions turn brown to black, leading to blighting and drying of leaves, and can spread to stems and pods.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural Practices:** Use disease-free certified seeds. Practice crop rotation. Avoid overhead irrigation, especially during humid conditions.
        *   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
            *   **Streptomycin Sulphate 90% + Tetracycline Hydrochloride 10% SP** at 0.5 g/L water.
            *   **Copper Oxychloride 50% WP** at 2.5 g/L water.

**II. Potential Biotic Causes (Pests):**

While pests usually cause specific damage, severe infestations can lead to overall plant stress and drying.

*   **A. Root-knot Nematodes (*Meloidogyne* spp.):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Infested plants show stunted growth, yellowing, wilting, and premature drying, especially under moisture stress. Examination of roots reveals characteristic galls or swellings.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural Practices:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops (e.g., marigold, cereals). Deep ploughing during summer can expose nematodes to sunlight. Incorporate organic matter into the soil.

*   **B. Sucking Pests (Aphids, Jassids, Whiteflies):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Severe infestation can lead to yellowing, curling of leaves, stunted growth, and in extreme cases, premature drying of leaves and branches due to continuous sap-sucking.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural Practices:** Install yellow sticky traps to monitor and trap adult whiteflies and jassids. Remove weeds that can act as alternate hosts.
        *   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
            *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL** at 0.5 ml/L water.
            *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG** at 0.2 g/L water.

**III. Abiotic Causes (Environmental Stress):**

*   **A. Water Stress (Drought):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Prolonged lack of water leads to wilting, leaf scorching, premature defoliation, and drying of the entire plant.
    *   **Management:** Provide timely and adequate irrigation, especially during critical growth stages (flowering and pod formation). Use mulching to conserve soil moisture.

*   **B. Waterlogging:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Excessive water in the root zone deprives roots of oxygen, leading to root rot, yellowing, wilting, and eventual drying of the plant.
    *   **Management:** Ensure proper field drainage. Avoid planting in low-lying areas prone to water accumulation.

*   **C. Nutrient Deficiencies:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Severe deficiencies of essential nutrients (e.g., Nitrogen, Potassium) can lead to yellowing, stunted growth, and premature drying of leaves.
    *   **Management:** Conduct soil testing to identify specific nutrient deficiencies. Apply balanced fertilizers based on soil test recommendations.

*   **D. Heat Stress:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Extreme high temperatures, especially during flowering, can cause flower drop, scorching of leaves, and overall plant stress leading to drying.
    *   **Management:** Select appropriate sowing time to avoid peak heat periods during sensitive growth stages. Ensure adequate irrigation to help plants cope with heat.

**General Recommendations (Integrated Pest and Disease Management - IPDM):**

1.  **Accurate Diagnosis:** The first step is to correctly identify the cause. Observe the specific symptoms, their pattern of spread, and environmental conditions.
2.  **Certified Seeds:** Always use certified, disease-free seeds from reliable sources.
3.  **Crop Rotation:** Implement a robust crop rotation plan to break disease and pest cycles.
4.  **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris to reduce inoculum sources.
5.  **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure plants receive adequate and balanced nutrients based on soil test reports to enhance their natural resistance.
6.  **Water Management:** Practice efficient irrigation, avoiding both drought and waterlogging.
7.  **Regular Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your fields for early signs of disease or pest infestation.

For a precise diagnosis and tailored recommendations, it is always advisable to bring a sample of the affected plant to the plant pathology or entomology department at HAU, Hisar, or consult with your local agricultural extension officer.
