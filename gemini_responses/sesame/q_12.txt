Scale insects and Mealybugs are known to affect Sesame (Til) crops, particularly during dry spells or when plants are stressed. Effective management requires an integrated approach.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Scale Insects and Mealybugs in Sesame:**

1.  **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect plants, especially the undersides of leaves, stems, and growing points, for the presence of these pests. Early detection is crucial for effective control.
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infested plant debris after harvest to reduce carry-over populations.
    *   **Weed Management:** Control weeds in and around the field, as they can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
    *   **Proper Nutrition and Irrigation:** Maintain healthy plant vigour through balanced fertilization and appropriate irrigation, as stressed plants are more susceptible.
    *   **Pruning:** In cases of localized infestation, prune and destroy heavily infested plant parts.
3.  **Biological Control:** Encourage natural enemies like ladybird beetles, lacewings, and parasitic wasps, which prey on scale insects and mealybugs. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.
4.  **Chemical Control:**
    When infestations are severe and other methods are insufficient, chemical intervention may be necessary. Choose insecticides with systemic action or good contact activity against these waxy-coated pests. Always ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and stems.

    For effective control, consider the following CIBRC approved insecticides:

    *   **For Scale Insects and Mealybugs:**
        *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at a rate of 500-600 ml per acre. This is an insect growth regulator that primarily affects nymphs.
        *   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:** Apply at a rate of 200-250 ml per acre. This is a systemic insecticide effective against various sucking pests, including scales and mealybugs.
        *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply at a rate of 50-100 g per acre. This is a systemic neonicotinoid insecticide effective against a broad range of sucking pests.

    **Important Considerations for Chemical Application:**
    *   Always use the recommended dosage and ensure thorough spray coverage, especially targeting the infested plant parts.
    *   Use sufficient water volume (e.g., 200 litres of water per acre) to ensure proper wetting and penetration.
    *   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
    *   Adhere strictly to the safety precautions mentioned on the insecticide label, including wearing personal protective equipment (PPE).
    *   Observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) before harvesting the crop.
