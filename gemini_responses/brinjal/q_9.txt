As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling mites in Brinjal (Eggplant) in Haryana. Red spider mites (primarily *Tetranychus urticae*) and rust mites (primarily *Aculops lycopersici*) are common and damaging pests of Brinjal.

**Symptoms of Mite Infestation:**

*   **Red Spider Mite:** Initial symptoms include fine, yellowish or silvery speckles on the upper leaf surface. As infestation progresses, leaves may turn bronze, become distorted, and eventually drop. Fine silken webbing can be observed on the undersides of leaves and between leaves, especially in severe cases. The mites themselves are tiny, reddish-brown, and can be seen with a hand lens.
*   **Rust Mite:** These mites are microscopic and not visible to the naked eye. Infested leaves develop a characteristic bronzed or rusty appearance, particularly on the undersides. Leaves may curl downwards, become leathery, and plant growth can be stunted. Stems may also show a rusty discoloration.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Mites in Brinjal:**

An integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods is most effective for sustainable mite management.

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy all infested plant debris after harvest to reduce overwintering mite populations.
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the field and surrounding areas free of weeds, as many weeds serve as alternate hosts for mites.
    *   **Proper Irrigation:** Maintain adequate soil moisture. Mites thrive in hot, dry conditions. Overhead irrigation can help dislodge mites from plants.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can promote lush, succulent growth that is more attractive to mites.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Conserve natural enemies such as predatory mites (e.g., *Amblyseius* species), ladybird beetles, and lacewings, which prey on pest mites. Judicious use of pesticides is crucial to protect these beneficial insects.

3.  **Chemical Control (Acaricides):**
    *   Chemical intervention should be considered when mite populations reach economic threshold levels. Always rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where mites are most prevalent.

    **CIBRC Approved Acaricides for Mites in Brinjal:**

    *   **Spiromesifen** (22.9% SC): Apply at 125 ml per acre (or 0.5 ml per litre of water).
    *   **Fenpyroximate** (5% SC): Apply at 200-300 ml per acre (or 0.8-1.2 ml per litre of water).
    *   **Propargite** (57% EC): Apply at 1.0-1.5 litres per acre (or 4-6 ml per litre of water).
    *   **Abamectin** (1.9% EC): Apply at 150-200 ml per acre (or 0.6-0.8 ml per litre of water).
    *   **Wettable Sulphur** (80% WP): Apply at 1.5-2.0 kg per acre (or 6-8 grams per litre of water). This is particularly effective against rust mites and also helps manage powdery mildew. *Caution: Do not apply when temperatures are very high (above 30-32°C) as it can cause phytotoxicity.*
    *   **Ethion** (50% EC): Apply at 1.0-1.5 litres per acre (or 4-6 ml per litre of water).
    *   **Fenazaquin** (10% EC): Apply at 200-300 ml per acre (or 0.8-1.2 ml per litre of water).
    *   **Pyridaben** (10% WP): Apply at 300-500 grams per acre (or 1.2-2.0 grams per litre of water).
    *   **Hexythiazox** (5.45% EC): Apply at 200-300 ml per acre (or 0.8-1.2 ml per litre of water). This is a mite growth regulator, primarily targeting eggs and nymphs.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Rotation:** Always rotate acaricides with different modes of action (as indicated by IRAC codes, if available on the label) to prevent the development of resistance in mite populations.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where mites are most active.
*   **Timing:** Apply acaricides when mite populations are low to moderate for best results. Early detection and intervention are crucial.
*   **Safety:** Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the pesticide label, including dosage, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and safety precautions (wearing appropriate Personal Protective Equipment - PPE).
*   **Water Quality:** Use clean water for preparing spray solutions.

For specific local recommendations and current pest thresholds, it is always advisable to consult your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts.
