As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies in Brinjal (Eggplant) in Haryana.

It is crucial to adopt an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, mechanical, and chemical methods for effective and sustainable pest control.

### 1. Control of Beetles in Brinjal

Several beetle species can affect Brinjal, including Epilachna beetles (also known as Hadra beetle or spotted leaf beetle), Flea beetles, and Blister beetles.

**Damage:**
*   **Epilachna beetles:** Both adults and grubs feed on the chlorophyll, scraping the leaf surface and leaving characteristic window-pane like damage.
*   **Flea beetles:** Create numerous small, round holes (shot-holes) in leaves, especially on young plants.
*   **Blister beetles:** Adults feed on flowers and leaves, causing significant defoliation and flower drop.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural and Mechanical Methods:**
    *   Regular scouting of fields to detect pest incidence early.
    *   Hand-picking and destruction of adult beetles, grubs, and egg masses, especially in the early stages of infestation.
    *   Maintaining field sanitation by removing weeds and crop debris that can harbor pests.
    *   Use of yellow sticky traps for monitoring adult beetle populations.

*   **Chemical Control (when pest incidence crosses economic threshold level):**
    *   **Malathion** 50% EC: 1.0 - 1.5 L per acre (or 2-3 ml per litre of water).
    *   **Carbaryl** 50% WP: 1.0 - 1.2 kg per acre (or 2-2.5 g per litre of water).
    *   **Cypermethrin** 10% EC: 200 - 250 ml per acre (or 0.75-1 ml per litre of water).
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: 100 - 125 ml per acre (or 0.5 ml per litre of water).
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC: 60 ml per acre (or 0.3 ml per litre of water).
    *   **Flubendiamide** 20% WG: 100 - 120 g per acre (or 0.5-0.6 g per litre of water).

### 2. Control of Weevils in Brinjal

While the major borer pest in Brinjal is the Brinjal Shoot and Fruit Borer (a moth), some weevil species like the Brinjal stem weevil (Alcidodes affaber) or root weevils (Myllocerus spp.) can occasionally affect the crop, though they are generally considered minor pests compared to beetles or borers.

**Damage:**
*   **Stem Weevils:** Larvae bore into the stem, causing wilting of shoots, stunted growth, and sometimes plant death.
*   **Root Weevils:** Larvae feed on roots, leading to poor plant vigor and reduced yield.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural and Mechanical Methods:**
    *   Regular monitoring for symptoms like wilting or stem damage.
    *   Removal and destruction of infested plant parts or severely affected plants to prevent further spread.
    *   Crop rotation to break the pest cycle.

*   **Chemical Control (if infestation is significant):**
    *   The insecticides recommended for beetles and borers are generally effective against weevils as well, especially those targeting chewing and boring insects.
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC: 60 ml per acre (or 0.3 ml per litre of water).
    *   **Flubendiamide** 20% WG: 100 - 120 g per acre (or 0.5-0.6 g per litre of water).
    *   **Cypermethrin** 10% EC: 200 - 250 ml per acre (or 0.75-1 ml per litre of water).
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: 100 - 125 ml per acre (or 0.5 ml per litre of water).

### 3. Control of Sawflies in Brinjal

This is not known to affect Brinjal. Sawflies are generally pests of other crops like mustard, wheat, or certain trees, and are not recognized as significant pests of Brinjal in Haryana or other parts of India.

**Important Considerations for Chemical Application:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully, including dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Observe the recommended pre-harvest interval (PHI) to ensure the produce is safe for consumption.
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.
*   Ensure thorough spray coverage for optimal efficacy.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension specialists or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions.
