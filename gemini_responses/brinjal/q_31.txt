As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling physical damage in Brinjal in Haryana:

### Control of Physical Damage in Brinjal

**1. Fruit Bursting (Cracking)**

Fruit bursting is primarily a physiological disorder caused by sudden fluctuations in soil moisture, especially when a dry spell is followed by heavy irrigation or rainfall. Calcium deficiency can also exacerbate this condition.

*   **Maintain Consistent Soil Moisture:**
    *   Provide regular, moderate irrigation. Avoid long dry periods followed by sudden heavy watering. Drip irrigation is highly recommended for maintaining uniform soil moisture.
    *   Mulching with organic materials (e.g., straw, dry leaves) can help conserve soil moisture, regulate soil temperature, and reduce moisture fluctuations.
*   **Ensure Adequate Calcium Nutrition:**
    *   If soil tests indicate calcium deficiency, apply calcium-rich fertilizers.
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray with **Calcium nitrate** at 5 g/L of water, or **Calcium chloride** at 3-4 g/L of water, starting from fruit set and repeating every 10-15 days.
    *   **Soil Application:** Incorporate **Calcium nitrate** into the soil as per soil test recommendations.

**2. Leaf Burning/Melting**

This condition is often a result of heat stress, intense sunlight (sun scald), water stress, or sometimes waterlogging leading to root damage. Chemical phytotoxicity from improper pesticide/herbicide application can also cause similar symptoms.

*   **Provide Adequate Irrigation:**
    *   Ensure timely and sufficient irrigation, especially during hot summer months (April-June) when temperatures are high in Haryana. Water stress makes plants more susceptible to heat damage.
*   **Shade Management:**
    *   During periods of extreme heat and intense sunlight, consider using shade nets (30-50% shade intensity) over the brinjal crop. This can significantly reduce leaf temperature and prevent sun scald.
*   **Ensure Proper Drainage:**
    *   Brinjal plants are sensitive to waterlogging. Ensure fields have good drainage to prevent water accumulation around roots, which can lead to root rot and subsequent leaf yellowing/browning and "melting" symptoms.
*   **Correct Chemical Application:**
    *   Always follow recommended dosages and application timings for all pesticides and herbicides. Avoid spraying during high temperatures or strong sunlight, as this can increase the risk of phytotoxicity (chemical burn) to leaves.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:**
    *   Maintain a balanced nutrient program to promote overall plant health and resilience against environmental stresses.

**3. Hardness in Fruit**

Hardness in brinjal fruit is typically associated with over-maturity at harvest, water stress, or nutrient imbalances, particularly insufficient potassium or boron.

*   **Timely Harvesting:**
    *   Harvest brinjal fruits at their optimal stage of maturity – when they are tender, glossy, and have reached a good size, but before the seeds fully harden and the skin loses its shine. Regular harvesting encourages continuous fruit production.
*   **Consistent Soil Moisture:**
    *   Maintain uniform soil moisture through regular irrigation. Water stress can lead to premature hardening of fruits and reduced quality.
*   **Balanced Nutrient Management:**
    *   Ensure adequate supply of essential nutrients, especially potassium and boron, which play crucial roles in fruit development and quality.
    *   **Potassium Application:** Apply **Potassium sulphate** (MOP or SOP) as per soil test recommendations during the fruiting stage.
    *   **Boron Application:** If boron deficiency is suspected or confirmed by soil tests:
        *   **Foliar Spray:** Apply **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate) at 1.5-2 g/L of water, or **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** at 1 g/L of water, starting from flowering and repeating every 15-20 days.
        *   **Soil Application:** Incorporate **Borax** into the soil at 5-10 kg/acre, depending on soil test results.
*   **Variety Selection:**
    *   Choose brinjal varieties known for their good fruit quality, tenderness, and suitability for the local agro-climatic conditions of Haryana.
