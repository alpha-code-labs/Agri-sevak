As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice on controlling flower and fruit drop in Brinjal.

Firstly, it is important to clarify that "Tinda dropping" refers to the dropping of fruits in Tinda (round gourd), and "Boll dropping" refers to the dropping of bolls in Cotton. **These conditions are not known to affect Brinjal.** In Brinjal, we primarily deal with flower drop and fruit drop.

Flower and fruit drop in Brinjal are common physiological issues that can significantly reduce yield. They are often a symptom of various stresses rather than a single disease or pest.

**Causes of Flower and Fruit Drop in Brinjal:**

1.  **Environmental Stress:**
    *   **Temperature Extremes:** Very high (above 35°C) or very low (below 15°C) temperatures can affect pollen viability, fertilization, and fruit development.
    *   **Moisture Stress:** Both drought conditions (insufficient water) and waterlogging (excessive water) can lead to dropping.
    *   **Humidity:** Very low or very high humidity can interfere with pollination and fruit set.
    *   **Light Intensity:** Insufficient light can weaken the plant and reduce its ability to support fruit development.
2.  **Nutritional Deficiencies:**
    *   Lack of essential nutrients, particularly Boron, Calcium, Phosphorus, and Potassium, can impair flower formation, pollen viability, and fruit retention.
3.  **Poor Pollination:**
    *   Lack of pollinators (bees, other insects) or conditions that hinder pollen transfer (e.g., high winds, heavy rain) can result in unfertilized flowers that drop.
4.  **Hormonal Imbalance:**
    *   An imbalance of plant hormones (auxins, gibberellins, cytokinins) can lead to abscission (shedding) of flowers and young fruits.
5.  **Pest and Disease Infestations:**
    *   Severe infestations of pests (e.g., mites, thrips, fruit and shoot borer) or diseases can weaken the plant, indirectly leading to stress and dropping.

**Control Measures for Flower and Fruit Drop in Brinjal:**

An integrated approach combining good agronomic practices with targeted interventions is most effective.

**A. Agronomic and Cultural Practices:**

1.  **Optimal Planting Time:** Plant Brinjal during periods when temperatures are conducive for growth and fruit set in Haryana (typically avoiding extreme summer heat and severe winter cold for main crop).
2.  **Water Management:**
    *   Maintain consistent soil moisture. Irrigate regularly, especially during flowering and fruiting stages.
    *   Avoid both water scarcity and waterlogging. Use drip irrigation if possible for efficient water use.
3.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Conduct soil testing to determine nutrient status.
    *   Apply balanced fertilizers based on soil test recommendations. Ensure adequate supply of Phosphorus, Potassium, and micronutrients like Boron and Calcium.
    *   Foliar application of micronutrients can be beneficial if deficiencies are observed.
4.  **Weed Control:** Keep the field free of weeds to reduce competition for water and nutrients.
5.  **Pest and Disease Management:**
    *   Regularly monitor for pests and diseases. Implement timely control measures to keep plants healthy and reduce stress.
6.  **Pollination Enhancement:**
    *   Encourage natural pollinators by planting flowering borders or avoiding broad-spectrum insecticides during flowering.
    *   In protected cultivation, hand pollination may be necessary.

**B. Chemical Control (Plant Growth Regulators and Micronutrients):**

When physiological dropping is significant, specific chemical interventions can help.

1.  **Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs):**
    *   **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA):** This auxin helps in preventing flower and fruit drop by delaying the formation of the abscission layer.
        *   **Dosage:** Apply **Naphthalene Acetic Acid** (4.5% SL formulation) at 0.2-0.4 ml per litre of water (equivalent to 10-20 ppm).
        *   **Timing:** Spray at the pre-flowering stage and repeat 15-20 days later, or as per specific product recommendations. Ensure thorough coverage of the plant.

2.  **Micronutrient Supplementation:**
    *   **Boron:** Boron is crucial for pollen germination, pollen tube growth, and fruit set. Deficiency can lead to significant flower and fruit drop.
        *   **Dosage:** If Boron deficiency is suspected or confirmed by soil/plant analysis, apply a foliar spray of Boron (e.g., Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate, 20% Boron) at 1-2 grams per litre of water (0.1-0.2% solution).
        *   **Timing:** Apply at the pre-flowering stage and repeat during early fruit development if needed.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label for specific dosages, application methods, and safety precautions.
*   Ensure proper spray coverage for effective absorption.
*   Avoid spraying during extreme heat or strong winds.
*   An integrated approach is key to sustainable management of flower and fruit drop in Brinjal.
