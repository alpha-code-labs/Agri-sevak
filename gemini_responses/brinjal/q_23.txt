As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified seed and soil treatment processes for Brinjal cultivation in Haryana:

### Seed Treatment for Brinjal

Seed treatment is crucial for protecting young seedlings from seed-borne and early soil-borne diseases, as well as initial pest attacks, ensuring better germination and stand establishment.

*   **For Fungal Diseases (e.g., Damping-off, Seedling Blight):**
    *   Treat seeds with a chemical fungicide:
        *   **Thiram** at 2-3 g per kg of seed, OR
        *   **Carbendazim** at 1-2 g per kg of seed, OR
        *   **Captan** at 2-3 g per kg of seed.
    *   Alternatively, for biological control, treat seeds with a bio-fungicide:
        *   **Trichoderma viride** at 4-6 g per kg of seed.
*   **For Early Sucking Pests (e.g., Aphids, Jassids, Thrips):**
    *   Treat seeds with a systemic insecticide:
        *   **Imidacloprid** (70 WS formulation) at 5-7 g per kg of seed, OR
        *   **Thiamethoxam** (70 WS formulation) at 3-5 g per kg of seed.
    *   **Application Note:** If using both a chemical fungicide and an insecticide, apply the fungicide first, allow the seeds to dry completely, and then apply the insecticide. If using biological agents (like **Trichoderma viride**), apply them last or separately to avoid inactivation by chemical fungicides.

### Soil Treatment for Brinjal

Soil treatment aims to manage soil-borne pathogens, nematodes, and enhance soil fertility, providing a healthy environment for root development.

*   **For Soil-borne Diseases (e.g., Wilt, Root Rot) and Nematodes (e.g., Root-knot Nematodes):**
    *   **Nursery Bed / Main Field Application (Pre-planting):**
        *   **Biological Control:** Mix **Trichoderma viride** at 2.5 kg per acre with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost. Apply this mixture evenly to the soil 7-10 days before transplanting.
        *   Similarly, **Pseudomonas fluorescens** at 2.5 kg per acre can be mixed with FYM/compost and applied.
        *   For nematode management, incorporate **Purpureocillium lilacinum** (formerly *Paecilomyces lilacinus*) at 2.5 kg per acre mixed with 50-100 kg FYM/compost into the soil 7-10 days before transplanting.
        *   **Chemical Control (for Nematodes):** Incorporate granular nematicides into the soil at the time of transplanting:
            *   **Carbofuran** (3G granules) at 10-15 kg per acre, OR
            *   **Phorate** (10G granules) at 10 kg per acre.
    *   **Drenching (Post-transplanting, if disease symptoms appear):**
        *   Drench the soil around the base of affected plants with a fungicide solution:
            *   **Carbendazim** at 1-2 g per litre of water, OR
            *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride** at 2-3 ml per litre of water.
*   **For Soil Health and Nutrient Availability (Bio-fertilizers):**
    *   **Soil Application:** Mix **Azotobacter** at 2.5 kg per acre and **Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria (PSB)** at 2.5 kg per acre with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed FYM/compost. Apply this mixture to the soil before transplanting.
    *   **Seedling Root Dipping:** Prepare a slurry by mixing 200 g of each bio-fertilizer (**Azotobacter** and **PSB**) in 10-15 litres of water. Dip the roots of brinjal seedlings for 30 minutes before transplanting. This helps in nitrogen fixation and phosphorus solubilization, promoting early plant vigour.

Always ensure proper safety measures, including wearing gloves and masks, when handling chemical treatments. Follow the manufacturer's instructions and local agricultural guidelines for best results and environmental safety.
