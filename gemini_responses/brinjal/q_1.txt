As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm the following:

Smut diseases, including Black smut, False smut, Kernel smut, and Loose smut, are primarily diseases of cereal crops (like wheat, rice, maize, sorghum) and grasses.

**These diseases are not known to affect Brinjal.**
