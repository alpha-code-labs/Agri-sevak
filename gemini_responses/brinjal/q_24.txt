As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following for Brinjal transplantation in Haryana:

### Ideal Transplantation Time

Brinjal is a warm-season crop, and its transplantation time in Haryana depends on the desired harvesting season:

*   **Kharif Season (Monsoon):** For a monsoon and early winter harvest, transplant seedlings during **July to August**.
*   **Rabi Season (Winter):** For a late winter and spring harvest, transplant seedlings during **October to November**.
*   **Spring-Summer Season:** For a summer harvest, transplant seedlings during **February to March**.

Seedlings are typically ready for transplanting when they are 4-6 weeks old, have developed 4-5 true leaves, and are about 10-15 cm tall.

### Ideal Transplantation Distance

The spacing depends on the variety (bushy vs. erect, short vs. long duration) and soil fertility. A general recommendation for optimal growth and yield is:

*   **Row to Row Distance:** 75-90 cm
*   **Plant to Plant Distance:** 60-75 cm

This spacing allows for adequate sunlight penetration, air circulation, and ease of cultural operations.

### Transplantation Process

1.  **Nursery Preparation:**
    *   Sow seeds in well-prepared raised nursery beds or pro-trays filled with a suitable potting mix.
    *   Ensure proper drainage and protection from heavy rains or direct harsh sun.

2.  **Field Preparation:**
    *   Plough the main field thoroughly to a fine tilth.
    *   Incorporate 20-25 tonnes of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost per acre during the last ploughing.
    *   Prepare ridges and furrows or flatbeds according to your irrigation method (furrow irrigation or drip irrigation).

3.  **Hardening of Seedlings:**
    *   About 7-10 days before transplanting, gradually expose the seedlings to outdoor conditions by reducing irrigation and removing shade. This helps them withstand transplant shock.

4.  **Timing of Transplanting:**
    *   Transplant seedlings preferably in the **late afternoon or evening** to minimize stress from high temperatures and direct sunlight.

5.  **Method of Transplanting:**
    *   Thoroughly water the nursery bed a few hours before uprooting the seedlings to ensure the root ball remains intact and to reduce damage.
    *   Carefully lift the seedlings, ideally with a small ball of earth around their roots.
    *   Plant the seedlings in the prepared holes/furrows at the recommended spacing.
    *   Ensure the root collar (the point where the stem meets the roots) is at the soil surface level. Do not plant too deep or too shallow.
    *   Gently firm the soil around the base of each plant to ensure good root-to-soil contact.
    *   Immediately provide a light irrigation after transplanting to settle the soil around the roots and help the plants establish.
    *   **Gap Filling:** Replant any dead or unhealthy seedlings within 5-7 days of transplanting to maintain uniform plant stand.
