Namaste, fellow farmer. As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the challenges posed by soil pests in Brinjal cultivation. Effective management of termites and root-knot nematodes is crucial for a healthy crop and good yield. Here is scientifically verified advice for controlling these pests in Brinjal:

### Control of Termites in Brinjal

Termites can cause significant damage to Brinjal plants, especially during the seedling and early growth stages, by feeding on roots and the base of the stem, leading to wilting and plant death.

**1. Cultural and Preventive Measures:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove all crop residues, stubble, and woody debris from the field before planting, as these can serve as food sources and breeding sites for termites.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** Expose termite colonies to sunlight and predators by deep ploughing the field during summer.
*   **Proper Irrigation:** Maintain adequate soil moisture, as termites prefer dry conditions. Avoid water stress in plants.

**2. Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved):**
For effective chemical control, consider the following:

*   **Pre-planting Soil Treatment:**
    *   Apply **Fipronil** 0.3% GR at 10-15 kg/acre by broadcasting and mixing into the soil before transplanting.
    *   Alternatively, drench the soil with **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 2.5-3.0 ml/L of water (or 500-600 ml per acre mixed in sufficient water) during the last ploughing or before transplanting.

*   **Post-planting (if infestation is observed):**
    *   Drench the base of affected plants with **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 2.5-3.0 ml/L of water. Ensure the solution reaches the root zone.

### Control of Nematodes (Root-knot) in Brinjal

Root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.) are a major pest of Brinjal, causing characteristic galls or knots on the roots. This damage impairs water and nutrient uptake, leading to stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, reduced yield, and increased susceptibility to other diseases.

**1. Cultural and Preventive Measures:**
*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate Brinjal with non-host crops like cereals (wheat, maize, sorghum) or marigold (Tagetes spp.) for at least 2-3 years. Marigold is known to have nematicidal properties.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available, use Brinjal varieties known to be resistant or tolerant to root-knot nematodes.
*   **Soil Solarization:** Cover the moist field with transparent polyethylene sheets (100-micron thick) for 4-6 weeks during the hot summer months (May-June). This raises soil temperature, killing nematodes and other soil-borne pathogens.
*   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or neem cake (at 200-400 kg/acre) into the soil 2-3 weeks before planting. Neem cake has nematicidal properties and improves soil health.
*   **Nursery Management:** Ensure the nursery beds are free from nematodes. Use solarized soil or treat nursery beds with recommended nematicides.

**2. Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved):**
For chemical management of root-knot nematodes, consider these options:

*   **Pre-planting/At Planting:**
    *   Apply **Carbofuran** 3% G at 10-13 kg/acre by broadcasting and mixing into the soil at the time of transplanting or within 7 days of transplanting.
    *   Alternatively, apply **Phorate** 10% G at 4 kg/acre by broadcasting and mixing into the soil at the time of transplanting.
    *   For a more modern approach, drench the soil with **Fluopyram** 34.48% SC at 0.625 ml/L of water (or 125 ml per acre mixed in sufficient water) at the time of transplanting or within 7 days of transplanting. This provides systemic protection.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully, including dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   An Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods, is the most sustainable and effective strategy for long-term pest control.
