Namaste, Kisan bhaiyon! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU), Hisar, I understand the challenges posed by pests like scale insects and mealybugs in Brinjal cultivation. These sucking pests can significantly reduce yield and quality if not managed effectively.

Here's a scientifically verified approach for their control:

**Understanding the Pests:**
*   **Scale Insects:** These are small, immobile insects often covered by a waxy or hard shell. They attach to stems, leaves, and fruits, sucking sap and causing yellowing, wilting, and stunted growth. They also excrete honeydew, leading to sooty mold development.
*   **Mealybugs:** These are soft-bodied, oval insects covered in a white, powdery, waxy substance. They cluster in leaf axils, under leaves, and on fruits, sucking sap and causing similar damage to scale insects, including honeydew excretion and sooty mold.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategy:**

A holistic approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods is most effective for sustainable control.

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Regular Monitoring:** Frequently inspect your Brinjal plants, especially the undersides of leaves, stem junctions, and developing fruits, for early signs of infestation.
    *   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy severely infested leaves, stems, or fruits to reduce pest populations.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Keep the field free of weeds, as they can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
    *   **Water Spray:** For small infestations, a strong jet of water can dislodge mealybugs from plants.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush, soft growth that is more attractive to sucking pests.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Encourage natural enemies like ladybird beetles, lacewings, and parasitic wasps, which prey on or parasitize scale insects and mealybugs. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

3.  **Chemical Control (When necessary):**
    When infestations are severe and cultural/biological methods are insufficient, chemical intervention may be required. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development. Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially targeting the undersides of leaves and hidden areas where these pests reside.

    The following CIBRC approved technical chemicals are recommended for the control of sucking pests, including scale insects and mealybugs, in Brinjal:

    *   **For Scale Insects and Mealybugs:**
        *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply 500-600 ml per acre (or 1.5-2 ml per litre of water). This is an insect growth regulator, effective against nymphs.
        *   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:** Apply 100-120 ml per acre (or 0.5-0.6 ml per litre of water). This is a systemic insecticide that moves both upwards and downwards in the plant, providing excellent control of hidden pests.
        *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply 100-125 ml per acre (or 0.5 ml per litre of water). This is a systemic neonicotinoid insecticide, effective against a wide range of sucking pests.
        *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply 100-125 g per acre (or 0.5 g per litre of water). This is another systemic neonicotinoid insecticide, known for its quick action.

    **Important Considerations:**
    *   Always read and follow the instructions on the insecticide label carefully, including dosage, mixing instructions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
    *   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying.
    *   Spray during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
    *   Avoid spraying during flowering to protect pollinators, or spray when pollinators are not active.

By implementing these strategies, you can effectively manage scale insects and mealybugs in your Brinjal crop and ensure a healthy harvest.
