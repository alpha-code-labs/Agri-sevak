As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Dieback, Twig blight, and Tikka disease in Brinjal in Haryana.

### Control of Dieback and Twig Blight in Brinjal

Dieback and Twig blight in Brinjal are often caused by fungal pathogens such as *Phomopsis vexans* or *Colletotrichum* species. These diseases lead to the drying back of twigs from the tip downwards, often accompanied by lesions or cankers on the stems.

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Sanitation:** Regularly inspect plants and promptly remove and destroy all infected plant parts (twigs, leaves, fruits) to reduce the source of inoculum.
*   **Disease-free planting material:** Always use healthy, disease-free seeds or seedlings from a reputable source.
*   **Pruning:** Prune affected branches during dry weather, making cuts into healthy wood. Sterilize pruning tools (e.g., with a 10% bleach solution) between cuts to prevent disease spread.
*   **Spacing:** Maintain adequate plant spacing to ensure good air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce humidity and fungal growth.
*   **Water Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day, as prolonged leaf wetness can promote fungal infections. Drip irrigation is preferable.

**2. Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
For effective management, apply fungicides as a protective measure or at the first sign of symptoms. It is advisable to alternate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

*   **Mancozeb** (75% WP): Apply at a rate of **2.0-2.5 g/L** of water.
*   **Carbendazim** (50% WP): Apply at a rate of **1.0-1.5 g/L** of water.
*   **Propiconazole** (25% EC): Apply at a rate of **1.0 ml/L** of water.
*   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC): Apply at a rate of **0.5-1.0 ml/L** of water.
*   **Copper Oxychloride** (50% WP): Apply at a rate of **2.5-3.0 g/L** of water.

Ensure thorough coverage of the plant foliage during spraying. Repeat applications as per product label recommendations, typically every 10-15 days, depending on disease severity and weather conditions.

### Tikka Disease in Brinjal

This is not known to affect Brinjal. Tikka disease is primarily a significant foliar disease of Groundnut (*Arachis hypogaea*), caused by *Cercospora arachidicola* and *Phaeoisariopsis personata*.
