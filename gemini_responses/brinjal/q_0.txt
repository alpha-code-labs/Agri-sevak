Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I will provide scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Brinjal (Eggplant) relevant to Haryana.

Here's how to manage the mentioned fungal diseases:

### Fungal Diseases Affecting Brinjal:

1.  **Alternaria (Early Blight)**
    This disease, caused by *Alternaria solani* or *Alternaria alternata*, leads to characteristic target-spot lesions on leaves, stems, and fruits.
    *   **Preventive/Early Stage:**
        *   Spray with **Mancozeb 75% WP** at 2.5 grams per litre of water (500-600 grams per acre).
        *   Alternatively, **Chlorothalonil 75% WP** at 2 grams per litre of water (400-500 grams per acre).
    *   **Curative/Advanced Stage:**
        *   Spray with **Azoxystrobin 23% SC** at 0.5-1 ml per litre of water (200 ml per acre).
        *   Alternatively, **Difenoconazole 25% EC** at 0.5 ml per litre of water (100-150 ml per acre).

2.  **Anthracnose**
    Caused by *Colletotrichum* species, this disease primarily affects fruits, causing sunken, circular spots with black dots, and can also appear on leaves and stems.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   Spray with **Carbendazim 50% WP** at 1 gram per litre of water (200-300 grams per acre).
        *   Alternatively, **Thiophanate methyl 70% WP** at 1 gram per litre of water (200-300 grams per acre).
        *   For broader spectrum control, **Azoxystrobin 23% SC** at 0.5-1 ml per litre of water (200 ml per acre) can be used.

3.  **Blast**
    This is not known to affect Brinjal.

4.  **Blight (Phomopsis Blight)**
    *Phomopsis vexans* is a major disease of Brinjal, causing leaf blight, stem blight, and fruit rot.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   Seed treatment with **Carbendazim 50% WP** at 2 grams per kg of seed is recommended before sowing.
        *   For foliar application, spray with **Carbendazim 50% WP** at 1 gram per litre of water (200-300 grams per acre).
        *   Alternatively, **Mancozeb 75% WP** at 2.5 grams per litre of water (500-600 grams per acre).
        *   For systemic action, **Propiconazole 25% EC** at 0.5 ml per litre of water (200 ml per acre) can be effective.

5.  **Brown spot**
    This is not known to affect Brinjal as a distinct named disease.

6.  **Downy Mildew**
    This is not known to affect Brinjal.

7.  **Powdery Mildew**
    Caused by *Leveillula taurica* or *Erysiphe cichoracearum*, it appears as white, powdery patches on the upper surface of leaves, leading to yellowing and defoliation.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   Spray with **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP** at 2-3 grams per litre of water (500-750 grams per acre).
        *   Alternatively, **Hexaconazole 5% EC** at 1 ml per litre of water (200-300 ml per acre).
        *   **Myclobutanil 10% WP** at 0.4-0.5 grams per litre of water (80-100 grams per acre) is also effective.

8.  **Grey Mildew**
    This is not known to affect Brinjal.

### General Recommendations:

*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation to break the disease cycle.
*   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris to reduce inoculum.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available, choose Brinjal varieties known for disease resistance.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing for good air circulation, which helps reduce humidity and fungal growth.
*   **Timely Application:** Apply fungicides at the first sign of disease symptoms for best results. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions.
