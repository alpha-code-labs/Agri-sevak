As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the significant challenges posed by various rot diseases in Brinjal (Eggplant) cultivation across Haryana. These rots, including Root, Stem, Foot, Collar, Crown, Neck, Black, Fruit, Seed, and Seedling rot, are often caused by a complex of soil-borne and airborne fungal pathogens such as *Phytophthora spp.*, *Pythium spp.*, *Rhizoctonia solani*, *Sclerotium rolfsii*, *Fusarium spp.*, and *Alternaria spp.*.

Effective control requires an Integrated Disease Management (IDM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods.

### Integrated Disease Management for Rot Types in Brinjal:

**A. Cultural Practices (Preventive Measures):**

1.  **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting brinjal or other solanaceous crops (tomato, potato, chilli) in the same field for at least 3-4 years. Rotate with non-host crops like maize, wheat, or legumes.
2.  **Field Sanitation:**
    *   Remove and destroy infected plant debris, weeds, and volunteer plants that can harbor pathogens.
    *   Ensure proper drainage to prevent waterlogging, which favors many rot-causing fungi.
3.  **Soil Solarization:** In summer, cover the prepared field with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks. This raises soil temperature, reducing pathogen inoculum.
4.  **Nursery Management:**
    *   Use raised beds for nurseries to improve drainage.
    *   Sterilize nursery soil using solarization or chemical methods (e.g., formaldehyde, though less common now).
    *   Avoid overcrowding of seedlings.
5.  **Water Management:**
    *   Irrigate judiciously, preferably in the morning, to allow foliage to dry before evening.
    *   Avoid overhead irrigation if possible, especially during fruit development, as it can spread spores and create favorable conditions for fruit rot. Drip irrigation is highly recommended.
6.  **Nutrient Management:** Maintain balanced nutrition. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can lead to lush, susceptible growth. Potash and phosphorus improve plant vigor and resistance.
7.  **Resistant Varieties:** Where available and suitable for Haryana conditions, choose brinjal varieties known for resistance or tolerance to common rot diseases. Consult with HAU experts for local recommendations.
8.  **Deep Ploughing:** Expose soil-borne pathogens to sunlight during summer fallow.

**B. Biological Control:**

1.  **Trichoderma Application:**
    *   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds with **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum** (4-6 g/kg seed) before sowing.
    *   **Soil Application:** Mix **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum** (2.5 kg/acre) with 50-100 kg of farmyard manure (FYM) or compost, keep it moist for a week, and then broadcast it in the field before transplanting or drench around the base of established plants. This helps suppress soil-borne pathogens.

**C. Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved Technical Chemicals):**

**1. For Seed Rot and Seedling Rot (Damping-off):**

*   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds before sowing with any of the following:
    *   **Thiram 75% WS** at 2-3 g/kg seed.
    *   **Carbendazim 50% WP** at 1-2 g/kg seed.
    *   **Metalaxyl-M 35% WS** at 3-4 g/kg seed (highly effective against oomycetes like *Pythium* and *Phytophthora*).

**2. For Root Rot, Stem Rot, Foot Rot, Collar Rot, Crown Rot, Neck Rot:**

*   **Nursery Drench:** If damping-off or collar rot symptoms appear in the nursery, drench the soil with:
    *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride 72.2% SL** at 2-3 ml/L water.
    *   **Metalaxyl-M 4% + Mancozeb 64% WP** at 2-2.5 g/L water.
*   **Field Drench/Drip Application:** For established plants showing symptoms, drench the soil around the base of the plants with:
    *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride 72.2% SL** at 2-3 ml/L water (apply 1-2 L solution per plant).
    *   **Metalaxyl-M 4% + Mancozeb 64% WP** at 2-2.5 g/L water (apply 1-2 L solution per plant).
    *   **Copper oxychloride 50% WP** at 2-3 g/L water (apply 1-2 L solution per plant).
    *   **Carbendazim 50% WP** at 1-2 g/L water (effective against *Fusarium* and *Rhizoctonia* rots).

**3. For Fruit Rot and Black Rot (often associated with *Phytophthora* or *Alternaria* blight):**

*   **Foliar Spray:** Initiate sprays at the first sign of disease or as a preventive measure during humid conditions and fruit development.
    *   **Mancozeb 75% WP** at 2-2.5 g/L water.
    *   **Chlorothalonil 75% WP** at 2 g/L water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC** at 0.5-1 ml/L water.
    *   **Metalaxyl-M 4% + Mancozeb 64% WP** at 2-2.5 g/L water (particularly effective against *Phytophthora* fruit rot).
    *   **Propineb 70% WP** at 2-2.5 g/L water.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the fungicide label for specific dosages, application methods, and safety precautions.
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in pathogens.
*   Consult with local HAU extension specialists for the most current and specific recommendations for your region and specific brinjal varieties.
