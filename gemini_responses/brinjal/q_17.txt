As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following doses of organic manures for Brinjal cultivation to enhance soil health, fertility, and crop productivity:

*   **Farmyard Manure (FYM):**
    *   Apply **20-25 tonnes per acre** during land preparation, at least 2-3 weeks before transplanting, ensuring it is well-decomposed. Incorporate it thoroughly into the soil.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   Apply **4-5 tonnes per acre** during land preparation, or as a partial replacement for FYM. It can also be applied at the time of transplanting in the planting pits.

*   **Sagarika (IFFCO):**
    *   Sagarika is a seaweed extract-based bio-stimulant. It is typically used as a foliar spray or soil application.
        *   **Foliar Spray:** Mix **2-4 ml per litre of water** and spray at critical growth stages (e.g., 20-25 days after transplanting, at flowering, and fruit development stages).
        *   **Soil Application/Drench:** Apply **500 ml per acre** mixed with irrigation water or as a drench around the root zone, particularly during early growth and flowering stages.
