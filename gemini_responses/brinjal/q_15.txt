As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Brinjal cultivation in Haryana:

### Control Measures for Pests in Brinjal

**1. Grasshopper**
Grasshoppers can cause significant damage by feeding on leaves and tender shoots of Brinjal plants.

*   **Cultural Methods:**
    *   Regular monitoring of fields, especially during early crop stages.
    *   Hand-picking and destroying grasshopper nymphs and adults in small infestations.
    *   Maintaining field sanitation by removing weeds that can serve as alternate hosts and breeding sites.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   For effective control, apply insecticides when nymphs are young and active. Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.
    *   **Malathion** 50 EC: Apply 1.0 - 1.5 litres per acre, mixed in 200-400 litres of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5 EC: Apply 100 - 150 ml per acre, mixed in 200-400 litres of water.
    *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20 EC: Apply 1.0 - 1.25 litres per acre, mixed in 200-400 litres of water.
    *   **Quinalphos** 25 EC: Apply 1.0 - 1.25 litres per acre, mixed in 200-400 litres of water.

**2. Painted bug**
This is not known to affect Brinjal. The Painted bug (Bagrada hilaris) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops like mustard, cabbage, and cauliflower.

**3. Red cotton bug**
This is not known to affect Brinjal. The Red cotton bug (Dysdercus cingulatus) is primarily a pest of cotton and other malvaceous plants, feeding on developing seeds.

**4. Black ants**
This is not known to affect Brinjal as a primary pest causing direct damage to the plant. Black ants are generally considered nuisance pests or secondary pests, often found tending to sap-sucking insects like aphids or mealybugs for their honeydew. If ants are present, it is advisable to check for the presence of other primary sap-sucking pests and manage them accordingly.
