As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm the following regarding the conditions you've mentioned for Brinjal:

*   **Scab:** This is not known to affect Brinjal.
*   **Canker:** This is not known to affect Brinjal.
*   **Gummosis:** This is not known to affect Brinjal.
*   **Lichen:** This is not known to affect Brinjal. Lichens are symbiotic organisms (fungus and alga) that typically grow on the bark of perennial woody plants and are not parasitic. They do not affect herbaceous plants like Brinjal.
