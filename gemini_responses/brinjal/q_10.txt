As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for managing pests in Brinjal (Eggplant) in Haryana. It is crucial to adopt an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods for sustainable control.

### Control of Borers in Brinjal (Brinjal Shoot and Fruit Borer - *Leucinodes orbonalis*)

This is a major pest of Brinjal.

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   Regularly monitor the crop for symptoms of infestation (withered shoots, boreholes in fruits).
*   Collect and destroy infested shoots and fruits by burying them deep or burning them. This helps break the pest life cycle.
*   Install pheromone traps (e.g., Pheromone traps for *Leucinodes orbonalis*) at a rate of 5 traps per acre for monitoring and mass trapping. Replace lures every 2-3 weeks.
*   Practice crop rotation and avoid continuous cultivation of Brinjal in the same field.

**2. Biological Control:**
*   Release the egg parasitoid **Trichogramma chilonis** at a rate of 50,000 eggs per acre, 4-6 times at weekly intervals, starting from the flowering stage.

**3. Chemical Control (Use only CIBRC approved technical chemicals):**
*   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC @ 60 ml/acre
*   **Flubendiamide** 20% WG @ 100 g/acre
*   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG @ 80-100 g/acre
*   **Cyantraniliprole** 10.26% OD @ 180 ml/acre
*   **Indoxacarb** 14.5% SC @ 200 ml/acre

### Control of Caterpillars in Brinjal (General Defoliators like *Spodoptera litura*, *Helicoverpa armigera*)

While the Brinjal Shoot and Fruit Borer is a primary caterpillar pest, other defoliating caterpillars can also affect Brinjal.

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   Regularly scout the field for egg masses and young larvae. Hand-pick and destroy them, especially in the early stages of infestation.
*   Install pheromone traps for *Spodoptera litura* at a rate of 5 traps per acre for monitoring and mass trapping.

**2. Chemical Control (Use only CIBRC approved technical chemicals):**
*   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG @ 80-100 g/acre
*   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC @ 60 ml/acre
*   **Novaluron** 10% EC @ 750 ml/acre
*   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC @ 200-250 ml/acre (Use judiciously to conserve natural enemies)

### Diamondback Moth (*Plutella xylostella*) in Brinjal

This is not known to affect Brinjal. Diamondback moth is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower, mustard).

---

### Leaf Folder in Brinjal

Leaf folder is not a primary or significant pest of Brinjal. However, if general defoliating caterpillars are causing leaf damage or rolling, the control measures for caterpillars mentioned above would be effective.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully, including dosage, timing, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.
*   Ensure proper spray coverage for effective pest control.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) while handling and applying pesticides.
*   Consult your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and for the latest updates on pest management practices.
