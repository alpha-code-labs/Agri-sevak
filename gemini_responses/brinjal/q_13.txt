### Control of Fruit Fly in Brinjal

The Fruit fly (*Bactrocera cucurbitae*) is a significant pest of Brinjal, causing damage by laying eggs in the developing fruits, leading to maggot infestation and fruit rot. Effective management requires an integrated approach.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Regularly collect and destroy all fallen, damaged, and infested fruits by burying them deep or burning them. This removes the breeding sites and breaks the pest's life cycle.
    *   **Deep Ploughing:** After harvest, deep ploughing exposes pupae in the soil to predators and sunlight, reducing the next generation's population.
    *   **Timely Harvesting:** Harvest fruits at the appropriate maturity stage to prevent over-ripening, which attracts fruit flies.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting Brinjal or other susceptible cucurbit/solanaceous crops continuously in the same field.

2.  **Mechanical Methods:**
    *   **Pheromone Traps:** Install cue-lure traps (specific for *Bactrocera cucurbitae*) at a density of 4-5 traps per acre. Replace the lures every 2-3 weeks. These traps attract and kill male fruit flies, disrupting mating.
    *   **Bagging:** For small-scale cultivation, individual fruits can be covered with paper or cloth bags to prevent the female fly from laying eggs.

3.  **Chemical Control (Use only when necessary and follow label instructions carefully):**
    *   **Bait Sprays:** These are highly effective as they attract and kill adult fruit flies. Mix an insecticide with a protein source (like jaggery or protein hydrolysate).
        *   Mix **Malathion** 50% EC at 2 ml/L of water with 10 g jaggery/L of water.
        *   Mix **Fenthion** 50% EC at 1 ml/L of water with 10 g jaggery/L of water.
        *   Apply these bait sprays as spot applications on foliage, preferably in the morning.
    *   **Foliar Sprays (for severe infestations):**
        *   **Dimethoate** 30% EC at 1.7 ml/L of water.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 0.6 ml/L of water.
        *   **Deltamethrin** 2.8% EC at 1 ml/L of water.

    **Important Considerations for Chemical Application:**
    *   Always adhere to the recommended dosage and pre-harvest interval (PHI) mentioned on the product label.
    *   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
    *   Apply sprays during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to maximize efficacy and minimize drift.

### Control of Ber Fly in Brinjal

This is not known to affect Brinjal. The Ber fly (*Carpomyia vesuviana*) is a host-specific pest primarily affecting Ber (*Ziziphus mauritiana*) fruits.
