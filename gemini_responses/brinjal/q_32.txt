Namaste! The "drying up" of branches, leaves, fruits, and flowers in Brinjal (eggplant) is a serious concern and can be attributed to several factors, ranging from diseases and pests to environmental stresses. As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I will provide you with scientifically verified advice to address this issue in Haryana.

It is crucial to accurately diagnose the underlying cause, as the management strategies differ significantly. Please observe your plants closely for specific symptoms.

Here are the primary causes and their recommended management strategies:

### I. Diseases

**1. Wilt Complex (Fungal and Bacterial Wilts)**
Wilt diseases are a major cause of drying up in Brinjal.

*   **Symptoms:**
    *   **Fungal Wilt (Fusarium Wilt, Verticillium Wilt):** Gradual yellowing, wilting, and drying of leaves, often starting from the lower leaves or one side of the plant. If you cut the stem near the base, you might observe brownish discoloration in the vascular tissues.
    *   **Bacterial Wilt (Ralstonia solanacearum):** Sudden wilting and drying of the entire plant or branches without significant yellowing. A key diagnostic is to cut the stem near the base and place it in clear water; a milky white bacterial ooze will emerge from the cut end within minutes.

*   **Management:**
    *   **Cultural Practices:**
        *   Use resistant or tolerant Brinjal varieties.
        *   Practice long-term crop rotation with non-solanaceous crops (e.g., cereals, legumes).
        *   Ensure good soil drainage to prevent waterlogging.
        *   Remove and destroy infected plants immediately to prevent spread.
        *   Soil solarization during summer can reduce pathogen inoculum.
    *   **Chemical Management (Preventive/Early Stage):**
        *   **For Fungal Wilt:**
            *   Seed treatment: **Carbendazim** (1-2 g/kg seed) or **Thiophanate Methyl** (2 g/kg seed).
            *   Soil drench (at transplanting or early stage): **Carbendazim** (1 g/L water) or **Thiophanate Methyl** (1 g/L water), applying 200-250 ml solution per plant.
            *   Bio-fungicides: *Trichoderma viride* (5 g/L water, as soil drench or mixed with FYM).
        *   **For Bacterial Wilt (efficacy is limited once established):**
            *   Soil drench (preventive/early stage): **Streptomycin Sulphate 9% + Tetracycline Hydrochloride 1% SP** (0.5-1 g/L water), applying 200-250 ml solution per plant.
            *   Bio-bactericides: *Pseudomonas fluorescens* (5 g/L water, as soil drench).

**2. Phomopsis Blight and Fruit Rot**
*   **Symptoms:** Can cause dark, sunken lesions on stems, which can girdle the stem and lead to drying of branches above the lesion. Also causes circular to irregular spots on leaves and dark, sunken spots on fruits, leading to fruit rot and drying.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Cultural Practices:** Use disease-free seeds, remove and destroy infected plant debris.
    *   **Chemical Management:**
        *   Foliar spray: **Mancozeb** (2.5 g/L water) or **Chlorothalonil** (2 g/L water) or **Carbendazim** (1 g/L water).

### II. Pests

**1. Brinjal Shoot and Fruit Borer (Leucinodes orbonalis)**
*   **Symptoms:** Larvae bore into young shoots, causing them to wilt, droop, and dry (often referred to as "dead heart" symptom). They also bore into flower buds and fruits, leading to drying of flowers, premature fruit drop, and drying of affected fruits.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Cultural Practices:**
        *   Regularly remove and destroy affected shoots and fruits.
        *   Use pheromone traps (5-10 traps/acre) to monitor and mass trap male moths.
        *   Plant trap crops like castor or marigold around the Brinjal field.
    *   **Chemical Management (Start at early fruiting stage):**
        *   Foliar spray:
            *   **Chlorantraniliprole** (0.3 ml/L water)
            *   **Flubendiamide** (0.2 ml/L water)
            *   **Emamectin Benzoate** (0.2 g/L water)
            *   **Cyantraniliprole** (0.6 ml/L water)
            *   **Spinosad** (0.25 ml/L water)

**2. Root-knot Nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.)**
*   **Symptoms:** These microscopic worms attack roots, causing characteristic galls or swellings. This damage impairs the plant's ability to absorb water and nutrients, leading to stunted growth, yellowing, wilting, and eventual drying of the plant, especially under stress conditions.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Cultural Practices:**
        *   Crop rotation with non-host crops (e.g., marigold, mustard, cereals).
        *   Use resistant Brinjal varieties if available.
        *   Soil solarization during summer.
        *   Incorporation of organic matter (e.g., neem cake at 100 kg/acre) can help suppress nematode populations.
    *   **Chemical Management (Pre-plant/At planting):**
        *   Soil application: **Carbofuran 3G** (10 kg/acre) or **Phorate 10G** (4 kg/acre) applied at planting.
        *   Drench/Drip: **Fluopyram** (0.625 ml/L water, 250 ml/plant) or **Cadusafos** (2 ml/L water, 250 ml/plant).
        *   Bio-nematicides: *Paecilomyces lilacinus* or *Purpureocillium lilacinum* (5 g/L water, as soil drench).

### III. Environmental/Physiological Factors

**1. Water Stress (Drought or Waterlogging)**
*   **Symptoms:**
    *   **Drought:** Insufficient water supply leads to wilting, drooping, and eventual drying of leaves and entire plants.
    *   **Waterlogging:** Excess water in the root zone damages roots, leading to impaired water uptake, causing symptoms similar to drought (wilting and drying) even when the soil is wet.
*   **Management:** Ensure proper irrigation practices. Avoid both extremes – provide adequate moisture without overwatering. Improve soil drainage in areas prone to waterlogging.

**2. Heat Stress**
*   **Symptoms:** Extremely high temperatures can cause wilting, flower drop, fruit abortion, and scorching of leaves, leading to drying.
*   **Management:** Provide temporary shade during peak summer heat. Ensure plants are well-hydrated.

**Integrated Pest and Disease Management (IPDM):**
For sustainable and effective management, always adopt an integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods. Regular field scouting is essential for early detection and timely intervention.

If you can provide more specific details about the onset, pattern, and associated symptoms of the "drying up," I can offer more targeted advice.
