As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), here are the recommended cultivation practices for Brinjal in Haryana:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   Brinjal is primarily grown by transplanting seedlings.
    *   Seeds are first sown in well-prepared nursery beds.
    *   Nursery beds should be raised (15-20 cm high), 1 meter wide, and of convenient length.
    *   Seeds are sown thinly in lines 5-10 cm apart in the nursery.
    *   Seedlings are ready for transplanting to the main field when they are 4-6 weeks old, or have attained a height of 10-15 cm with 4-5 true leaves.
    *   Transplanting in the main field is done in rows.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   When transplanting seedlings from the nursery to the main field, plant them at the same depth they were growing in the nursery, ensuring the root ball is well covered. A depth of approximately 5-7 cm for the root ball is generally appropriate.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   Optimal spacing is crucial for good yield and air circulation. The recommended spacing varies slightly based on variety and soil fertility:
        *   **Row-to-Row:** 75 cm to 90 cm
        *   **Plant-to-Plant:** 60 cm to 75 cm
    *   A common practice for good yields is 90 cm x 60 cm or 75 cm x 60 cm.

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   The seed rate depends on the variety type:
        *   **Open-pollinated varieties:** 200-250 g per acre
        *   **Hybrid varieties:** 80-100 g per acre
