Dear farmer,

Controlling sucking pests is vital for ensuring healthy Brinjal crops and good yields. These pests, including Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips, directly damage plants by feeding and can also transmit devastating viral diseases. Here is a scientifically verified approach for their management in Brinjal:

### Management of Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Methods:**
*   **Regular Monitoring:** Frequently inspect your Brinjal plants, especially the undersides of leaves and tender shoots, for early detection of pests.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Keep the field free of weeds, as many weeds serve as alternate hosts for these pests.
*   **Water Sprays:** For minor infestations, a strong jet of water can dislodge aphids and whiteflies from plants.
*   **Yellow Sticky Traps:** Install yellow sticky traps (10-12 traps per acre) to monitor and trap adult whiteflies, leafhoppers, and thrips.
*   **Reflective Mulches:** Use silver-colored plastic mulches in the early stages of crop growth to deter whiteflies and thrips.
*   **Removal of Infested Parts:** Prune and destroy heavily infested leaves or shoots to reduce pest populations.

**2. Biological Control:**
*   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Protect and encourage beneficial insects such as ladybird beetles, lacewings, hoverfly larvae, and parasitic wasps (e.g., *Encarsia formosa* for whiteflies). Avoid using broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these natural predators and parasitoids.
*   **Biopesticides:** Apply entomopathogenic fungi like *Verticillium lecanii* (now *Lecanicillium lecanii*) or *Beauveria bassiana* as per label recommendations, especially during periods of high humidity, for effective control of nymphs and adults.

**3. Chemical Control (Use only CIBRC approved technical chemicals):**
*   Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.
*   Adhere strictly to the recommended dosages, application timings, and safety precautions mentioned on the product label.
*   For early infestations or as part of an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategy, consider botanical insecticides:
    *   **Azadirachtin** (1500 ppm) at 5 ml/L of water.

*   For moderate to severe infestations, choose from the following CIBRC approved technical chemicals:
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG at 0.2 g/L of water.
    *   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP at 0.2 g/L of water.
    *   **Flonicamid** 50% WG at 0.3 g/L of water (effective against aphids and whiteflies).
    *   **Spiromesifen** 22.9% SC at 0.6 ml/L of water (effective against whiteflies).
    *   **Buprofezin** 25% SC at 1.6 ml/L of water (effective against whitefly nymphs).
    *   **Fipronil** 5% SC at 1.5-2 ml/L of water (effective against thrips, aphids, leafhoppers).
    *   **Dinotefuran** 20% SG at 0.3 g/L of water.
    *   **Diafenthiuron** 50% WP at 1.2 g/L of water (effective against whiteflies and thrips).

### Regarding Psylla

This is not known to be a significant or common pest affecting Brinjal in Haryana. Therefore, specific control measures for Psylla are generally not required for Brinjal cultivation in our region.

For any further clarification or specific field issues, please consult with the experts at Haryana Agricultural University.
