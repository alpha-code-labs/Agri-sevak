As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified recommendations for the use of growth regulators and micronutrients in Brinjal cultivation in Haryana:

It is crucial to use plant growth regulators and micronutrients judiciously and at the correct concentrations, as incorrect application can lead to adverse effects.

*   **Ethephon:**
    This is not commonly recommended as a growth regulator for yield enhancement or quality improvement in Brinjal cultivation in Haryana. Its primary applications are typically for fruit ripening or abscission in other crops, which are generally not desired for Brinjal, which is harvested immature.

*   **2,4-D (2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid):**
    At extremely low concentrations, 2,4-D can act as a synthetic auxin to improve fruit set and prevent flower drop in Brinjal.
    *   **Purpose:** To enhance fruit setting and reduce flower shedding.
    *   **Dose:** Spray **2,4-D** at a concentration of **2-5 mg per litre of water** (2-5 ppm).
    *   **Application:** Apply as a foliar spray during the flowering stage, typically when the first flush of flowers appears.
    *   **Caution:** Higher concentrations of 2,4-D are herbicidal and will damage the crop. Strict adherence to the recommended low dose is essential.

*   **Boron (as Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate):**
    Boron is an essential micronutrient vital for pollen germination, fruit set, and overall plant development. Boron deficiency can lead to poor fruit set and deformed fruits.
    *   **Purpose:** To improve flowering, pollen viability, fruit set, and fruit development.
    *   **Dose:** Spray **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (a soluble form of Boron) at a concentration of **1-2 grams per litre of water** (0.1-0.2% solution).
    *   **Application:** Apply as a foliar spray, typically starting from the pre-flowering stage and repeated at 15-20 day intervals, especially if deficiency symptoms are observed or anticipated.
    *   **Note:** Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage. Soil application of Boron (e.g., 10-15 kg Borax per acre) can also be done at the time of land preparation if soil tests indicate severe deficiency. However, foliar application is often preferred for quick correction and efficient uptake during critical growth stages.
