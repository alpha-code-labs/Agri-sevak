Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU), Hisar, I understand your concerns regarding growth issues in Brinjal. Effective management begins with accurate diagnosis of the underlying cause. Here's a scientifically verified approach to address slow growth, yellow growth, excessive height, and excessive flowering in Brinjal:

**General Recommendations (Applicable to all growth issues):**

1.  **Soil Testing:** This is the most crucial first step. A comprehensive soil test will reveal nutrient deficiencies, imbalances, and soil pH, which are often the root causes of growth problems. Based on the report, you can tailor your fertilization program.
2.  **Optimal Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Water Management:** Ensure consistent and adequate moisture. Both waterlogging and drought stress can severely impact plant growth.
    *   **Plant Spacing:** Maintain recommended plant spacing to ensure proper light penetration and air circulation, reducing competition for resources.
    *   **Weed Control:** Weeds compete with Brinjal plants for nutrients, water, and light, hindering their growth.
    *   **Sunlight:** Brinjal requires at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily.

**Specific Management Strategies:**

**1. Slow Growth:**
Slow growth can be indicative of nutrient deficiencies, soil issues, or pest/disease pressure.

*   **Nutrient Deficiencies:**
    *   **Nitrogen (N):** Apply **Urea** at 50-100 kg/acre in split doses, or a foliar spray of **Urea** at 10-15 g/L.
    *   **Phosphorus (P):** Apply **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** at 100-150 kg/acre or **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)** at 50-75 kg/acre as a basal dose or side dressing.
    *   **Potassium (K):** Apply **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** at 50-75 kg/acre as a basal dose or side dressing.
    *   **Micronutrients:** If soil test indicates deficiency, apply:
        *   **Zinc Sulphate:** 10-20 kg/acre in soil, or 2-5 g/L as foliar spray.
        *   **Ferrous Sulphate:** 5 g/L as foliar spray.
        *   **Manganese Sulphate:** 2-3 g/L as foliar spray.
        *   **Borax** or **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate:** 1-2 g/L as foliar spray.
*   **Soil pH Imbalance:**
    *   **Acidic Soil (low pH):** Apply agricultural lime (calcium carbonate) as per soil test recommendations to raise pH.
    *   **Alkaline Soil (high pH):** Apply gypsum or elemental **Sulphur** at 10-20 kg/acre to lower pH and improve nutrient availability.
*   **Nematode Infestation:** Root-knot nematodes can severely stunt growth.
    *   Apply **Fluopyram** (17.7% SC) at 625 ml/acre as a soil drench.
*   **Soil Compaction:** Improve soil structure by incorporating organic matter (farmyard manure, compost) and deep ploughing.

**2. Yellow Growth (Chlorosis):**
Yellowing of leaves (chlorosis) is typically a sign of nutrient deficiency or water stress.

*   **Nitrogen Deficiency:** General yellowing, especially of older leaves.
    *   Apply **Urea** as a foliar spray (10-15 g/L) or soil application.
*   **Iron Deficiency:** Interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves.
    *   Apply **Ferrous Sulphate** at 5 g/L as a foliar spray.
*   **Zinc Deficiency:** Stunted growth, small leaves, interveinal chlorosis.
    *   Apply **Zinc Sulphate** at 2-5 g/L as a foliar spray.
*   **Manganese Deficiency:** Similar to iron deficiency, often with a mottled appearance.
    *   Apply **Manganese Sulphate** at 2-3 g/L as a foliar spray.
*   **Sulphur Deficiency:** General yellowing, often starting on younger leaves.
    *   Apply elemental **Sulphur** at 10-20 kg/acre to the soil.
*   **Waterlogging:** Ensure proper drainage to prevent root damage and subsequent nutrient uptake issues.

**3. Excessive Height (Legginess):**
Excessive height with spindly growth often indicates insufficient light, high nitrogen, or close spacing.

*   **Light:** Ensure plants receive adequate sunlight. If growing in protected cultivation, adjust shading.
*   **Nutrient Balance:** Reduce high nitrogen fertilizers. Focus on balanced NPK application.
*   **Plant Spacing:** Maintain optimal plant spacing to prevent competition for light.
*   **Pruning:** Pinch off the terminal growing points to encourage lateral branching and a bushier habit.
*   **Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs):**
    *   To reduce internode length and promote compact growth, a foliar application of **Chlormequat chloride** (50% SL) at 1-2 ml/L can be considered, especially if other cultural practices are insufficient. Apply carefully as per product instructions.

**4. Excessive Flowering (but poor fruit set):**
This can be due to nutrient imbalances, environmental stress, or pollination issues.

*   **Nutrient Imbalance:**
    *   Ensure adequate **Phosphorus** and **Potassium** for flower and fruit development. Use fertilizers like **Monoammonium Phosphate (MAP)** or **Monopotassium Phosphate (MKP)** as foliar sprays (5-10 g/L) or **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** as soil application.
    *   Avoid excessive **Nitrogen**, which promotes vegetative growth over reproductive growth.
    *   **Boron** deficiency can lead to poor pollen viability and fruit set. Apply **Borax** or **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** at 1-2 g/L as a foliar spray.
*   **Pollination Issues:**
    *   Brinjal flowers are self-pollinating but benefit from insect activity. Encourage pollinators (e.g., bees) by avoiding insecticide sprays during flowering.
    *   In protected cultivation, manual vibration of flowers can aid pollination.
*   **Environmental Stress:**
    *   **Temperature Extremes:** High temperatures (above 35°C) or very low temperatures can cause flower drop. Provide shade during extreme heat if feasible.
    *   **Water Stress:** Maintain consistent soil moisture. Both drought and waterlogging can lead to flower abortion.
*   **Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs):**
    *   To improve fruit set, a very low concentration foliar spray of **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA)** (4.5% SL) at 0.2-0.5 ml/L can be applied at the peak flowering stage. Use with caution and strictly adhere to recommended dosages.

Always remember to observe your plants closely and identify the specific symptoms before applying any treatment. For precise recommendations, it is always best to consult with local agricultural extension officers or HAU experts after a thorough field inspection and soil analysis.
