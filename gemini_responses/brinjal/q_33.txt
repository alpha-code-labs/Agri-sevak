As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling weeds in Brinjal (Eggplant) fields in Haryana. Effective weed management in Brinjal requires an integrated approach combining cultural, mechanical, and judicious chemical methods.

**I. Integrated Weed Management Strategy for Brinjal**

1.  **Cultural and Mechanical Control (Foundation of Weed Management):**
    *   **Field Preparation:** Deep ploughing during summer followed by repeated harrowing helps expose weed seeds to solar radiation, reducing their viability.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate Brinjal with non-host crops (e.g., cereals, legumes) to break the life cycle of specific weeds like Orobanche and reduce the overall weed seed bank.
    *   **Healthy Seedlings:** Use vigorous, healthy seedlings to ensure quick establishment and canopy closure, which helps suppress weed growth by shading.
    *   **Proper Spacing:** Maintain optimal plant spacing to allow for inter-row cultivation and facilitate manual weeding.
    *   **Mulching:** Use organic mulches (straw, dry leaves) or plastic mulches to suppress weed emergence, conserve moisture, and regulate soil temperature.
    *   **Hand Weeding/Hoeing:** This is highly effective, especially during the early stages of crop growth (first 30-45 days after transplanting). Perform 2-3 hand weedings as needed. This is crucial for parasitic weeds like Amarbail and Orobanche.

2.  **Chemical Control (Herbicides):**
    *   Always read and follow the label instructions for any herbicide.
    *   Ensure proper calibration of spray equipment and uniform application.
    *   Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).

**II. Control Measures for Specific Weeds in Brinjal**

**A. For Broadleaf and Narrowleaf Weeds (General):**

*   **Pre-emergence Application (within 3-5 days of transplanting Brinjal seedlings):**
    *   **Pendimethalin** 30% EC: Apply at 1.0-1.5 kg active ingredient per acre (approx. 3.3-5.0 L of product per acre) mixed in 200-300 L of water. This controls many annual grasses and broadleaf weeds.
    *   **Oxyfluorfen** 23.5% EC: Apply at 0.23-0.46 kg active ingredient per acre (approx. 1.0-2.0 L of product per acre) mixed in 200-300 L of water. Effective against a range of broadleaf and some grass weeds.

*   **Post-emergence Application (for grass weeds only):**
    *   **Quizalofop ethyl** 5% EC: Apply at 0.2-0.4 L of product per acre mixed in 200-300 L of water when grass weeds are at the 2-4 leaf stage. This herbicide is selective for grass weeds and safe for Brinjal.
    *   **Fluazifop-P-butyl** 13.4% EC: Apply at 0.5-1.0 L of product per acre mixed in 200-300 L of water when grass weeds are actively growing. Also selective for grass weeds.

**B. For Specific Weeds:**

*   **Amarbail (Cuscuta spp.):**
    *   **Prevention is paramount:** Use certified, clean Brinjal seeds. Regularly inspect and remove any Amarbail plants from field bunds and surrounding areas before they flower and set seed.
    *   **Manual Removal:** If observed, immediately hand-pull and destroy Amarbail plants before they spread or set seed.
    *   **Pre-emergence:** **Pendimethalin** (as mentioned above) can offer some suppression of Cuscuta germination.

*   **Bathu (Chenopodium album):**
    *   This common broadleaf weed is effectively controlled by **Pendimethalin** (PRE) and regular manual weeding.

*   **Congress grass (Parthenium hysterophorus):**
    *   **Manual Removal:** Hand-pulling young plants before flowering is the most effective method. Wear gloves to avoid skin irritation.
    *   **Pre-emergence:** **Pendimethalin** (as mentioned above) can provide some initial suppression.

*   **Orobanche (Broomrape spp.):**
    *   **This is a major parasitic weed of Brinjal and other solanaceous crops.**
    *   **Prevention:**
        *   **Crop Rotation:** Essential. Avoid planting Brinjal or other solanaceous crops in infested fields for several years. Rotate with non-host crops like wheat, maize, or legumes.
        *   **Trap Crops:** Planting crops like linseed (flax) or mustard can stimulate Orobanche seed germination, but the Orobanche cannot parasitize them, leading to "suicidal germination." These trap crops should be ploughed under before Orobanche can complete its life cycle.
        *   **Solarization:** Covering the soil with transparent plastic sheets during hot summer months can kill Orobanche seeds in the upper soil layers.
    *   **Chemical Control (Highly sensitive application):**
        *   **Glyphosate** 41% SL: Very low doses of **Glyphosate** can be applied *post-emergence* to the Brinjal crop to control Orobanche *before* it emerges from the soil or at very early emergence. A typical recommendation is 25-50 ml of product per acre, applied as a spot spray or directed spray, 30-45 days after transplanting, and potentially a second application 15-20 days later. **This application requires extreme precision and should only be done by experienced personnel, as higher doses will severely damage the Brinjal crop.** Consult with a local agricultural expert before attempting this method.
    *   **Manual Removal:** Crucial to remove Orobanche spikes as soon as they emerge from the soil, *before* they flower and set seed. This prevents further seed build-up in the soil.

*   **Phalaris minor (Little seed canary grass):**
    *   While primarily a weed of wheat, if present in Brinjal, it can be controlled by:
    *   **Pre-emergence:** **Pendimethalin** (as mentioned above).
    *   **Post-emergence:** **Quizalofop ethyl** or **Fluazifop-P-butyl** (as mentioned above for general grass weeds).
