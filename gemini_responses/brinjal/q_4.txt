As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling Wilt (including Parawilt) in Brinjal in Haryana. It's crucial to understand that "Wilt" can be caused by pathogens (bacteria or fungi), while "Parawilt" is a physiological disorder. Therefore, the management strategies differ.

### Control of Wilt (Bacterial and Fungal) in Brinjal

Wilt diseases, caused by soil-borne bacteria (e.g., *Ralstonia solanacearum*) or fungi (e.g., *Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. melongenae*, *Verticillium dahliae*), are highly destructive in Brinjal. Integrated management is key.

**1. Cultural Practices:**

*   **Resistant Varieties:** The most effective long-term solution. Consult your local HAU Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) for recommended wilt-resistant Brinjal varieties suitable for Haryana.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting Brinjal or other solanaceous crops (tomato, potato, chilli) in the same field for at least 3-4 years. Rotate with non-host crops like maize, wheat, rice, or marigold.
*   **Soil Solarization:** During hot summer months (May-June), plough the field, irrigate it, and cover it tightly with a transparent polyethylene sheet (100-gauge thick) for 4-6 weeks. This raises soil temperature, killing many soil-borne pathogens.
*   **Proper Drainage:** Ensure good field drainage to prevent waterlogging, which can stress plants and favor pathogen development.
*   **Avoid Root Injury:** Minimize root damage during transplanting, weeding, and intercultural operations, as wounds provide entry points for pathogens.
*   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris to reduce inoculum in the soil.
*   **Raised Beds:** Planting on raised beds can improve drainage and reduce disease incidence.

**2. Biological Control:**

*   **Seed Treatment:**
    *   Treat seeds with **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum** at 4-5 g/kg seed, or **Pseudomonas fluorescens** at 10 g/kg seed before sowing.
*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Mix **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum** (2.5 kg/acre) or **Pseudomonas fluorescens** (2.5 kg/acre) with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost. Keep the mixture moist for a week in a shaded place, then broadcast it evenly in the field before transplanting or at the time of planting.

**3. Chemical Control (Use as preventive or early intervention):**

*   **Seed Treatment:**
    *   Treat seeds with **Carbendazim 50% WP** at 2 g/kg seed.
    *   Alternatively, use **Thiram 75% WS** at 2-3 g/kg seed.
*   **Nursery Drenching/Seedling Root Dip:**
    *   Before transplanting, drench the nursery beds with a solution of **Carbendazim 50% WP** at 1-2 g/L water.
    *   Dip the roots of seedlings in a solution of **Carbendazim 50% WP** (1 g/L water) or **Streptomycin Sulphate 9% + Tetracycline Hydrochloride 1% SP** (0.5 g/L water) for 30 minutes before transplanting.
*   **Soil Drenching (at early stages or transplanting):**
    *   For fungal wilt, drench the soil around the base of the plants with **Carbendazim 50% WP** at 1-2 g/L water (200-250 ml solution per plant) immediately after transplanting or at the first sign of wilting. Repeat after 15-20 days if necessary.
    *   For bacterial wilt, drenching with **Copper Oxychloride 50% WP** at 2-3 g/L water or **Streptomycin Sulphate 9% + Tetracycline Hydrochloride 1% SP** at 0.5-1 g/L water can help suppress the disease, especially in early stages. Once bacterial wilt is established, chemical control is often less effective.

### Control of Parawilt in Brinjal

Parawilt is a physiological disorder, not caused by a pathogen. It is often triggered by sudden changes in soil moisture (e.g., heavy rain after a dry spell, or sudden dry spell after irrigation), high temperatures, or root disturbance. Plants typically recover during cooler parts of the day or after irrigation.

**1. Management Strategies:**

*   **Consistent Irrigation:** Maintain uniform soil moisture. Avoid extremes of drought and waterlogging. Irrigate regularly, especially during dry periods.
*   **Mulching:** Apply organic mulch (straw, dry leaves, black plastic) around the base of plants. This helps conserve soil moisture, regulate soil temperature, and reduce weed competition.
*   **Improve Soil Organic Matter:** Incorporate well-decomposed FYM or compost into the soil. This improves soil structure, water holding capacity, and overall plant health, making plants more resilient to stress.
*   **Avoid Root Disturbance:** Be careful during weeding and intercultural operations to prevent damage to the root system.
*   **Provide Partial Shade:** In areas with extreme high temperatures, providing temporary partial shade during the hottest part of the day can help reduce plant stress.
