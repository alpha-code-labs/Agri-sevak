As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I emphasize that addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies in Brinjal (eggplant) is crucial for optimal growth, yield, and fruit quality. Visual symptoms are often late indicators; therefore, **regular soil testing is the most reliable method** to determine nutrient status and guide fertilizer application.

Here's how to address Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium deficiencies in Brinjal:

### General Recommendations:
*   **Soil Testing:** Always conduct a soil test before planting and periodically during cultivation to determine the exact nutrient requirements. This prevents over-application, which can be wasteful and harmful.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management (INM):** Combine chemical fertilizers with organic manures (Farm Yard Manure, compost, vermicompost) to improve soil health, nutrient availability, and water retention.

### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

**Role of Nitrogen:** Nitrogen is vital for vegetative growth, chlorophyll production, and protein synthesis. It contributes to leaf and stem development.

**Symptoms of Deficiency:**
*   General yellowing (chlorosis) of older leaves first, progressing to younger leaves.
*   Stunted plant growth.
*   Thin, weak stems.
*   Reduced fruit set and smaller fruits.

**Correction Measures:**
*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Urea** (46% N) at 20-30 kg/acre as a top-dressing, split into 2-3 applications during the vegetative growth phase, based on soil test recommendations. Ensure adequate soil moisture after application.
*   **Foliar Application (for quick recovery in mild to moderate cases):**
    *   Spray a 1.5-2% solution of **Urea** (15-20 g/L of water). Apply in the morning or late afternoon to avoid scorching. Repeat every 7-10 days if symptoms persist.

### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

**Role of Phosphorus:** Phosphorus is essential for root development, flowering, fruiting, energy transfer, and overall plant vigor.

**Symptoms of Deficiency:**
*   Stunted growth and poor root development.
*   Leaves may appear dark green or develop a purplish tint, especially on the undersides of older leaves.
*   Delayed flowering and fruit maturity.
*   Reduced fruit size and yield.

**Correction Measures:**
*   **Soil Application (Primary method, as P is less mobile in soil):**
    *   Apply **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5) at 40-50 kg/acre, or **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5) at 120-150 kg/acre, as a basal application before planting or at the time of transplanting. The exact dose should be based on soil test results.
*   **Foliar Application (for mild cases or as a supplement):**
    *   Spray a 0.5-1% solution of **Monoammonium Phosphate (MAP)** (12% N, 61% P2O5) or **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (5-10 g/L of water). This can provide a temporary boost but is not a substitute for soil application for severe deficiencies.

### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency

**Role of Potassium:** Potassium (Potash) is crucial for water regulation, nutrient transport, enzyme activation, disease resistance, and improving fruit quality (size, color, shelf life).

**Symptoms of Deficiency:**
*   Yellowing (chlorosis) and browning (scorching or necrosis) of leaf margins, particularly on older leaves.
*   Weak stems and lodging.
*   Poor fruit development, reduced fruit size, and quality.
*   Increased susceptibility to diseases and pests.

**Correction Measures:**
*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** (60% K2O) at 30-40 kg/acre, or **Sulphate of Potash (SOP)** (50% K2O) at 35-45 kg/acre, as a basal application or split into two applications (basal and top-dressing during flowering/fruiting). Adjust dose based on soil test.
*   **Foliar Application (for quick relief and improved fruit quality):**
    *   Spray a 0.5-1% solution of **Potassium Sulphate** (5-10 g/L of water) or **Potassium Nitrate** (5-10 g/L of water). Apply during flowering and fruit development stages. Repeat every 10-15 days as needed.

Always consult with your local HAU extension specialist for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's soil type and Brinjal variety.
