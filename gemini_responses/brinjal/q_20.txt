As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified approaches to address micronutrient deficiencies in Brinjal in Haryana. It is crucial to conduct a soil test to confirm specific deficiencies and their severity before applying any amendments.

### General Recommendation:
*   **Soil Testing:** Always begin with a comprehensive soil test to accurately diagnose deficiencies and determine the precise quantities of micronutrients required. This prevents over-application and ensures efficient nutrient management.
*   **Foliar vs. Soil Application:** Foliar applications provide a quick remedy for acute deficiencies, especially for mobile nutrients or when soil conditions limit uptake. Soil applications offer a more sustained supply.

### Specific Micronutrient Deficiencies and Management:

#### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency
Zinc deficiency leads to stunted growth, small and narrow leaves (little leaf), interveinal chlorosis, and reduced fruit set.

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Zinc sulphate** (21% Zn) at 10-25 kg/acre as a basal application or broadcast before planting, depending on soil test recommendations.
*   **Foliar Application:**
    *   Spray 0.5% solution (5 g/L) of **Zinc sulphate** (21% Zn) or 0.3% solution (3 g/L) of **Zinc sulphate** (33% Zn) at 15-day intervals, starting from 3-4 weeks after transplanting, if deficiency symptoms appear.

#### 2. Iron (Fe) Deficiency
Iron deficiency causes severe interveinal chlorosis, particularly on younger leaves, which may turn almost white in severe cases.

*   **Foliar Application:**
    *   Spray 0.5% solution (5 g/L) of **Ferrous sulphate** at 7-10 day intervals until symptoms disappear. Adding a few drops of liquid soap or a non-ionic surfactant can improve absorption.

#### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency
Boron deficiency can result in stunted growth, thickening and brittleness of leaves, cracking of stems and fruits, poor pollen viability, and reduced fruit set.

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Borax** (10.5% B) at 2-4 kg/acre as a basal application, based on soil test results.
*   **Foliar Application:**
    *   Spray 0.1-0.2% solution (1-2 g/L) of **Borax** or **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** at flowering and fruit development stages.

#### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency
While less common for blossom end rot in Brinjal compared to tomato, calcium deficiency can lead to stunted growth, marginal necrosis of young leaves, and poor fruit quality.

*   **Foliar Application:**
    *   Spray 0.5-1.0% solution (5-10 g/L) of **Calcium nitrate** or **Calcium chloride** at 10-15 day intervals, especially during fruit development.

#### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency
Magnesium deficiency causes interveinal chlorosis, starting from older leaves, often with a purplish or reddish tint, as chlorophyll production is impaired.

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   If severe, apply **Magnesium sulphate** at 10-20 kg/acre as a basal application.
*   **Foliar Application:**
    *   Spray 0.5-1.0% solution (5-10 g/L) of **Magnesium sulphate** at 10-15 day intervals until symptoms subside.

#### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency
Manganese deficiency symptoms are similar to iron deficiency, causing interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, but often accompanied by small necrotic spots.

*   **Foliar Application:**
    *   Spray 0.2-0.5% solution (2-5 g/L) of **Manganese sulphate** at 7-10 day intervals until symptoms disappear.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always ensure thorough spray coverage for foliar applications.
*   Apply foliar sprays during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late afternoon) to prevent leaf scorching and maximize absorption.
*   Avoid mixing multiple micronutrient fertilizers without confirming compatibility.
*   Regular monitoring of the crop for deficiency symptoms is crucial for timely intervention.
