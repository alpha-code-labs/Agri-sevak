As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice on irrigation management for Maize (Makka) in Haryana. Timely and adequate irrigation is crucial for maximizing maize yields, especially during critical growth stages.

**Irrigation Management in Maize (Makka)**

Maize is sensitive to water stress, particularly during its reproductive stages. The number and timing of irrigations depend on factors such as soil type, rainfall, and prevailing weather conditions.

**1. First Irrigation:**
*   The first irrigation is critical for establishing a strong root system and vigorous vegetative growth.
*   It should generally be applied around **20-25 days after sowing (DAS)**.
*   This stage corresponds to the **knee-high stage** of the crop.
*   If there has been good pre-sowing irrigation or significant rainfall immediately after sowing, the first irrigation might be slightly delayed, but it should not be postponed beyond 30 DAS in the absence of rain.

**2. Second Irrigation and Subsequent Irrigations:**
*   The second irrigation is typically required around **40-45 DAS**, coinciding with the **tasseling stage** (pre-tasseling to early tasseling). This is a highly critical stage for yield determination.
*   Subsequent irrigations should be scheduled based on the crop's water requirement and soil moisture status. The most critical growth stages for water application are:
    *   **Knee-high stage (20-25 DAS)**
    *   **Tasseling stage (40-45 DAS)**
    *   **Silking stage (50-60 DAS)**
    *   **Grain filling stage (65-80 DAS)**
*   Water stress during tasseling, silking, and grain filling can lead to significant yield losses.
*   In Haryana, depending on rainfall patterns and soil type, maize typically requires **3-5 irrigations** in total.
*   Always check the soil moisture before irrigating. Irrigate when the top 15-20 cm of soil feels dry to the touch. Avoid over-irrigation, especially in heavy soils, as it can lead to waterlogging, root damage, and nutrient leaching.

**3. Sprinkler Use in Maize:**
*   Sprinkler irrigation is an **efficient and recommended method** for maize cultivation, particularly in areas with limited water availability or undulating topography.
*   **Advantages of Sprinkler Irrigation:**
    *   **Water Saving:** Can save 25-40% water compared to traditional flood irrigation methods.
    *   **Uniform Water Distribution:** Ensures even application of water across the field, leading to uniform crop growth.
    *   **Reduced Nutrient Leaching:** Minimizes the loss of soluble nutrients from the root zone.
    *   **Suitable for Light Soils:** Prevents excessive deep percolation in sandy soils.
    *   **Fertigation Capability:** Allows for the application of water-soluble fertilizers along with irrigation water, improving nutrient use efficiency.
*   **Management with Sprinklers:**
    *   Use appropriate sprinkler types (e.g., mini-sprinklers, rain guns) and adjust nozzle sizes and operating pressures to ensure optimal water application rates and droplet size, minimizing runoff and evaporation.
    *   Monitor soil moisture regularly using tensiometers or by manual inspection to determine precise irrigation schedules.
    *   Irrigate for shorter durations but more frequently, especially during critical growth stages, to maintain optimal soil moisture without causing waterlogging.
    *   Ensure proper design, installation, and regular maintenance of the sprinkler system for efficient operation.
