As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm the following regarding the conditions you've mentioned for Maize (Makka):

*   **Scab:** This is not known to affect Maize (Makka) in the typical sense as it affects wheat or barley. While *Fusarium* species can cause ear rots in maize, the term "scab" is not the standard terminology for maize diseases.
*   **Canker:** This is not known to affect Maize (Makka). Cankers are primarily diseases of woody plants.
*   **Gummosis:** This is not known to affect Maize (Makka). Gummosis is a condition primarily affecting fruit trees.
*   **Lichen:** This is not known to affect Maize (Makka). Lichens are symbiotic organisms that grow on surfaces and are not parasitic to living maize plants.
