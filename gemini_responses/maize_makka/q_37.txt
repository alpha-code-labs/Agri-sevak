Protecting Maize (Makka) from wild animals is a significant challenge for farmers in Haryana, with common culprits including Nilgai (Blue Bull), Wild Boar, and Monkeys. Effective strategies often involve a combination of physical barriers, deterrents, and community-based approaches.

It is important to note that there are **no CIBRC-approved chemical repellents specifically registered for deterring large wild animals like Nilgai, Wild Boar, or Monkeys from maize crops in India.** Therefore, the focus is primarily on non-chemical methods:

Here are the recommended methods to protect Maize (Makka) from wild animals:

*   **Physical Barriers:**
    *   **Fencing:**
        *   **Barbed Wire Fencing:** A common and relatively cost-effective method. Multiple strands (5-7) at varying heights (e.g., 0.3 m, 0.6 m, 0.9 m, 1.2 m, 1.5 m) can deter larger animals like Nilgai and Wild Boar.
        *   **Electric Fencing (Solar Powered):** Highly effective against Nilgai and Wild Boar. A low-voltage, high-pulse electric fence provides a psychological barrier without causing harm. Ensure proper earthing and regular maintenance for optimal functionality.
        *   **Chain-link or Woven Wire Fencing:** More expensive but provides a robust barrier. For wild boars, it is advisable to bury the bottom portion (e.g., 0.3-0.5 meters deep) to prevent them from burrowing underneath.
    *   **Trenching:** Digging deep trenches (e.g., 1-1.5 meters deep, 0.5-0.75 meters wide) around the field can deter wild boars from entering by making it difficult for them to cross.

*   **Auditory and Visual Deterrents:**
    *   **Human Patrolling/Watchmen:** The most traditional and often effective method, especially during critical crop stages (e.g., tasseling to maturity). Human presence is a strong deterrent.
    *   **Scarecrows and Reflective Devices:** While their effectiveness can diminish over time as animals habituate, they can provide temporary deterrence. Using reflective tapes, old CDs, or shiny objects that move with the wind can create visual disturbance.
    *   **Sound Devices:** Using firecrackers or sound guns at irregular intervals can scare animals away, but requires constant human presence and effort.
    *   **Guard Dogs:** Trained dogs can be effective in deterring animals, especially during the night.

*   **Habitat Management:**
    *   **Clearing Field Edges:** Remove dense bushes, weeds, and tall grasses around the field boundaries. This reduces hiding spots for wild animals and makes them more visible, discouraging them from approaching.
    *   **Synchronized Sowing:** If possible, encourage synchronized sowing of maize in a village or cluster of villages. This dilutes the damage pressure on individual fields and makes it harder for animals to target specific plots.

*   **Community-Based Approaches:**
    *   **Collective Action:** Farmers in a village or cluster should work together to implement protection measures. A collective fence or shared patrolling system is often more effective and sustainable than individual efforts.
    *   **Reporting:** Report persistent wild animal issues to the local Forest Department or agricultural authorities for potential intervention or advice.
