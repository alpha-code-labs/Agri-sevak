Wilt, including Parawilt, is a significant concern in Maize (Makka) cultivation in Haryana. Parawilt, in particular, is a complex syndrome often associated with fungal pathogens like *Fusarium verticillioides* and can be exacerbated by environmental stresses and nutrient imbalances.

Effective control requires an integrated approach:

**1. Resistant Varieties:**
*   The most sustainable and effective long-term solution is to cultivate maize hybrids known to be tolerant or resistant to wilt and parawilt. Consult with HAU scientists or local agricultural extension officers for recommended varieties suitable for your region.

**2. Seed Treatment:**
*   Treating seeds with fungicides before sowing is crucial to protect seedlings from soil-borne and seed-borne pathogens that cause wilting and damping-off.
    *   **Carbendazim 50% WP:** Apply at 2 g/kg of seed.
    *   **Thiram 75% WS:** Apply at 2.5-3 g/kg of seed.
    *   **Tebuconazole 2% DS:** Apply at 2.5 g/kg of seed.
    *   **Fluxapyroxad 333 g/L + Pyraclostrobin 333 g/L FS:** Apply at 1.5-2 ml/kg of seed (check specific product label for exact dosage).

**3. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid continuous maize cultivation. Rotate maize with non-host crops like wheat, mustard, or legumes for at least 2-3 years to reduce pathogen build-up in the soil.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris from the field after harvest. This reduces the inoculum source for the next crop.
*   **Timely Sowing:** Sow maize at the recommended time for your region to avoid periods of high stress that can predispose plants to wilt.
*   **Optimum Plant Density:** Maintain recommended plant spacing to ensure proper air circulation and reduce stress.
*   **Proper Drainage:** Ensure good field drainage to prevent waterlogging, which can stress plants and favor root rot pathogens.

**4. Nutrient Management:**
*   **Balanced Fertilization:** Provide balanced nutrition based on soil test recommendations. Adequate levels of macro and micronutrients are essential for plant vigor and disease resistance.
*   **Boron Application:** For Parawilt, Boron deficiency has been implicated as a contributing factor. If soil tests indicate low Boron, apply **Borax (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate)** at 10-15 kg/acre as a soil application before sowing, or foliar spray **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (e.g., Solubor) at 1-1.5 g/L of water at knee-high stage and pre-tasseling stage, if deficiency symptoms appear.

**5. Water Management:**
*   Provide adequate and timely irrigation, especially during critical growth stages. Avoid both water stress (drought) and excessive irrigation (waterlogging), as both can weaken plants and make them more susceptible to wilt.

**Note:** Once plants show severe wilting symptoms, chemical control is often ineffective. The focus should be on preventive measures and integrated management strategies.
