As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I strongly recommend conducting a soil test before planting to accurately assess nutrient levels and determine precise fertilizer requirements. This proactive approach is the most effective way to prevent macro-nutrient deficiencies.

However, if deficiencies are observed during the growth cycle of Maize (Makka), here's how to address them:

### General Advice for Deficiency Correction:
*   **Soil Testing:** Always confirm the deficiency with a soil test if possible, or at least observe characteristic symptoms carefully.
*   **Timing:** Apply fertilizers when the soil is moist or irrigate immediately after application to ensure nutrient availability and minimize losses.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management:** Combine chemical fertilizers with organic manures (Farm Yard Manure, compost) for long-term soil health and nutrient availability.

### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   General pale green to yellow appearance of the entire plant.
*   Yellowing starts from the tip of older leaves and progresses along the midrib in a V-shape.
*   Stunted growth and reduced yield.

**Corrective Measures:**
*   **Soil Application (Top-dressing):**
    *   Apply 20-30 kg of **Urea** (46% N) per acre as a top-dressing. This can be split into two applications if the deficiency is severe, with a gap of 7-10 days.
    *   Broadcast evenly between rows and lightly incorporate into the soil, followed by irrigation.
*   **Foliar Application (for quick but temporary relief):**
    *   Spray a 2% solution of **Urea** (20 g of **Urea** per litre of water).
    *   Apply 2-3 sprays at weekly intervals, ensuring complete coverage of the foliage. Avoid spraying during hot midday sun.

### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   Stunted growth, especially in young plants.
*   Leaves may turn purplish or reddish, particularly on the underside of older leaves and leaf margins.
*   Poor root development and delayed maturity.

**Corrective Measures:**
*   Phosphorus is less mobile in the soil and within the plant, making post-emergence correction challenging. Basal application is most effective.
*   **Soil Application (Top-dressing, if observed early):**
    *   If deficiency is observed in young plants (up to 3-4 leaf stage), apply 10-15 kg of **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5) or 25-35 kg of **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5) per acre.
    *   Broadcast evenly and incorporate into the soil, followed by irrigation. The uptake will be slower compared to nitrogen.
*   **Note:** Foliar application of phosphorus is generally less effective for correcting severe deficiencies in maize due to limited absorption and translocation.

### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   Yellowing or browning (scorching) of leaf margins, starting from the tip of older leaves and progressing inwards.
*   Weak stalks, lodging, and poor kernel development at the ear tip.
*   Increased susceptibility to diseases.

**Corrective Measures:**
*   **Soil Application (Top-dressing):**
    *   Apply 15-20 kg of **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** (Potassium Chloride, 60% K2O) per acre.
    *   Broadcast evenly between rows and lightly incorporate into the soil, followed by irrigation.
*   **Foliar Application (for quick but temporary relief):**
    *   Spray a 1-2% solution of **Potassium Nitrate** (10-20 g of **Potassium Nitrate** per litre of water).
    *   Apply 2 sprays at 7-10 day intervals, ensuring good leaf coverage.

Always consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and soil test results.
