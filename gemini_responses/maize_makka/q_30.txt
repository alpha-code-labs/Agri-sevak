Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I will provide scientifically verified advice for managing growth issues in Maize (Makka) in Haryana. It's crucial to understand that these issues often stem from a combination of factors, and an integrated approach is always best.

### General Principles for Healthy Maize Growth:

Before addressing specific issues, ensure fundamental agronomic practices are in place:
*   **Soil Testing:** Regularly test your soil to understand its nutrient status and pH. This is the foundation for balanced fertilization.
*   **Hybrid Selection:** Choose high-yielding, locally adapted, and disease-resistant maize hybrids recommended for Haryana.
*   **Timely Sowing:** Sow maize at the optimal time to avoid extreme temperatures during critical growth stages.
*   **Weed Management:** Control weeds effectively as they compete for nutrients, water, and sunlight.

### Management of Specific Growth Issues:

#### 1. Slow Growth:

Slow growth in maize can be indicative of various underlying problems. A thorough field inspection is necessary to diagnose the exact cause.

*   **Nutrient Deficiency:**
    *   **Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K):** Ensure balanced application as per soil test recommendations. For a quick boost in early stages, a foliar spray can be considered.
        *   Foliar spray: 2% solution of **Urea** (20 g/L water) at 25-30 days after sowing (DAS).
    *   **Micronutrients (Zinc, Iron, Manganese, Boron):** Deficiencies, especially Zinc, are common in Haryana soils.
        *   Apply **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** at 25 kg/acre as a basal application if soil test indicates deficiency.
        *   For foliar application, use **Zinc EDTA** at 0.5 g/L water or **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** at 5 g/L water.
*   **Water Stress:**
    *   **Insufficient Water:** Ensure timely and adequate irrigation, especially during critical stages like knee-high, tasseling, silking, and grain filling.
    *   **Waterlogging:** Ensure proper field drainage to prevent water stagnation, which can suffocate roots and lead to nutrient lockout.
*   **Soil Compaction:** Hard pans can restrict root growth. Deep ploughing or subsoiling can alleviate compaction.
*   **Pest and Disease Pressure:** Inspect plants for signs of insect pests (e.g., Fall Armyworm, stem borers) or diseases (e.g., downy mildew, leaf blight) that can hinder growth. Implement appropriate pest and disease management strategies.
*   **Temperature Stress:** Extreme cold or heat can slow down growth. Ensure sowing is done during optimal temperature windows.

#### 2. Yellow Growth (Chlorosis):

Yellowing of maize leaves (chlorosis) is most commonly due to nutrient deficiencies or waterlogging.

*   **Nitrogen (N) Deficiency:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Older, lower leaves turn yellow, starting from the tip and progressing along the midrib in a 'V' shape.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Ensure timely top-dressing of **Urea** as per recommended schedule (e.g., 1/3rd at sowing, 1/3rd at knee-high stage, 1/3rd at tasseling).
        *   For quick recovery, foliar spray of 2% **Urea** solution (20 g/L water).
*   **Zinc (Zn) Deficiency:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Yellowish-white bands appear on either side of the midrib, especially on younger leaves, starting from the base. Stunted growth.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Soil application: 25 kg/acre of **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** at sowing.
        *   Foliar spray: 0.5 g/L water of **Zinc EDTA** or 5 g/L water of **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** at 25-30 DAS and repeat after 10-15 days if needed.
*   **Iron (Fe) Deficiency:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Youngest leaves show interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between green veins). More common in high pH or calcareous soils.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Foliar spray: 0.5 g/L water of **Iron EDTA** or 5 g/L water of **Ferrous sulphate** at 25-30 DAS and repeat after 10-15 days if needed.
*   **Sulfur (S) Deficiency:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Uniform yellowing of younger leaves, sometimes confused with nitrogen deficiency, but affects new growth first.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Soil application: 100 kg/acre of **Gypsum** or 20 kg/acre of **Elemental sulfur** at sowing.
*   **Waterlogging:**
    *   **Symptoms:** General yellowing, stunted growth, purpling of lower stems.
    *   **Management:** Improve drainage.

#### 3. Excessive Height:

Excessive height in maize can lead to lodging (falling over), especially during strong winds or heavy rains, resulting in significant yield loss.

*   **Hybrid Selection:** Choose maize hybrids known for their strong stalks and lodging resistance, suitable for your region.
*   **Plant Density:** Maintain optimal plant spacing and density as recommended for your chosen hybrid. Overcrowding can lead to taller, weaker plants.
*   **Nitrogen Management:** Avoid excessive application of nitrogen fertilizers, especially in later growth stages, as this can promote vegetative growth (height) at the expense of stalk strength and grain filling. Follow soil test-based recommendations for balanced fertilization.
*   **Earthing Up:** Performing earthing up (mounding soil around the base of the plants) at the knee-high stage provides additional support to the stalks and encourages the development of brace roots, reducing lodging risk.
*   **Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs):** The use of specific plant growth regulators for height reduction in maize is not a standard or widely recommended practice by agricultural universities in Haryana due to cost-effectiveness and potential impacts on yield. Focus on the cultural practices mentioned above.

#### 4. Excessive Flowering:

This is not known to affect Maize (Makka) as a detrimental growth issue requiring specific management. Maize has a distinct flowering pattern with a single main tassel (male flower) and typically one or two ears (female flowers) per plant. If you observe unusual flowering patterns (e.g., excessive tillering with tassels), it is usually a genetic trait of the hybrid or a response to severe stress, rather than a problem that requires direct intervention with growth regulators. Focus on providing optimal growing conditions to ensure healthy reproductive development.
