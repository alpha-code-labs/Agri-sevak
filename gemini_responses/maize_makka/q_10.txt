As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Maize (Makka) in Haryana:

It is crucial to identify the specific pest accurately before applying any control measures. Always follow label instructions for dosage, application method, and safety precautions.

### Control Measures for Pests in Maize (Makka)

#### 1. Borers (e.g., Maize Stem Borer - *Chilo partellus*)

Maize stem borers are a major pest causing 'dead heart' symptoms and tunneling in stems.
*   **Early Stage (Whorl Application - within 20-25 days of sowing):**
    *   Apply granules into the leaf whorls.
    *   **Carbofuran 3G**: 10 kg/acre
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 0.4% GR**: 5 kg/acre
*   **Later Stage / Foliar Spray (if infestation persists or for older plants):**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC**: 80 ml/acre
    *   **Emamectin Benzoate 5% SG**: 88 g/acre
    *   **Thiamethoxam 12.6% + Lambda-cyhalothrin 9.5% ZC**: 50 ml/acre

#### 2. Caterpillars (General defoliators, including Fall Armyworm - *Spodoptera frugiperda*)

Caterpillars can cause significant defoliation and damage to the leaf whorl, especially the Fall Armyworm.
*   **Early Stage (Whorl Application - for Fall Armyworm in young plants):**
    *   Apply granules into the leaf whorls.
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 0.4% GR**: 5 kg/acre
*   **Foliar Spray (for defoliating caterpillars and Fall Armyworm):**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC**: 80 ml/acre
    *   **Emamectin Benzoate 5% SG**: 88 g/acre
    *   **Spinetoram 11.7% SC**: 60 ml/acre
    *   **Flubendiamide 20% WG**: 50 g/acre
    *   **Thiamethoxam 12.6% + Lambda-cyhalothrin 9.5% ZC**: 50 ml/acre

#### 3. Diamondback Moth (*Plutella xylostella*)

This is not known to affect Maize (Makka). Diamondback moth is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops like cabbage, cauliflower, and mustard.

#### 4. Leaf folder

Leaf folders cause leaves to fold longitudinally, with larvae feeding inside. While less common as a primary pest in maize compared to borers or fall armyworm, they can occur.
*   **Foliar Spray:**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC**: 80 ml/acre
    *   **Emamectin Benzoate 5% SG**: 88 g/acre
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC**: 200 ml/acre

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Integrated Pest Management (IPM):** Always integrate chemical control with cultural practices (e.g., timely sowing, field sanitation), biological control, and resistant varieties for sustainable pest management.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pest resistance.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of pesticides. Follow the pre-harvest interval (PHI) mentioned on the product label.
*   **Local Advice:** For the most precise and up-to-date recommendations, always consult your local agricultural extension officer or the experts at HAU, Hisar, as pest situations and approved chemicals can change.
