As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), here is the scientifically verified advice regarding maturity signs, harvesting time, and cutting process for Maize (Makka) in Haryana:

### Maturity Signs for Maize (Makka)

Physiological maturity in maize indicates the point of maximum dry matter accumulation in the grain. Key signs include:

*   **Black Layer Formation:** The most reliable indicator. A dark, pigmented layer forms at the tip of the kernel where it attaches to the cob. This layer signifies the cessation of nutrient flow to the grain.
*   **Husks Drying and Turning Papery:** The protective leaves (husks) around the cob become dry, brittle, and lose their green colour, turning yellowish-brown or white.
*   **Kernels Hardening and Denting:** The grains become hard and firm. For dent corn varieties (common in Haryana), a distinct "dent" or depression forms on the crown of the kernel.
*   **Leaves and Stalk Drying:** The lower leaves of the plant start to yellow and dry out, progressing upwards. The stalk may also begin to lose its green colour.
*   **Grain Moisture Content:** At physiological maturity, the grain moisture content typically ranges from 25-35%, depending on the variety and environmental conditions.

### Harvesting Time for Maize (Makka)

The optimal harvesting time is crucial for maximizing yield, grain quality, and ensuring safe storage.

*   **Grain Moisture Content:** For safe storage and to minimize post-harvest losses, maize grain should ideally be harvested when its moisture content is between 18-25%. Harvesting at higher moisture content requires artificial drying, while harvesting at very low moisture content (below 15%) can lead to field losses due to shattering, lodging, and increased pest damage.
*   **Post-Physiological Maturity:** Harvesting usually occurs 15-20 days after physiological maturity (black layer formation) to allow for natural field drying and reduction in grain moisture content to the desired level.
*   **Variety Duration:** The total duration from sowing to harvest varies by variety. Early maturing varieties may be ready in 90-100 days, while medium to late maturing varieties can take 110-120 days or more.
*   **Weather Conditions:** Favourable dry weather conditions are essential during harvest to prevent spoilage and facilitate drying.

### Cutting Process for Maize (Makka)

The cutting or harvesting process can be done manually or mechanically, depending on the scale of operation and availability of machinery.

*   **Manual Harvesting:**
    *   **Cob Picking:** The most common method for grain harvest in small to medium holdings. Only the mature cobs are hand-picked from the standing plants. The remaining stalks can then be cut later for fodder.
    *   **Whole Plant Cutting:** The entire maize plant is cut close to the ground using a sickle. The plants are then stacked in the field for a few days to allow further drying of the cobs and stalks. After drying, the cobs are separated (de-husked) and shelled.
*   **Mechanical Harvesting:**
    *   **Maize Harvesters/Combines:** Large-scale operations often use specialized maize harvesters or combines. These machines can either pick only the cobs, de-husk them, and shell the grain in a single pass, or they can harvest the entire plant for silage (if intended for fodder).
    *   **Cob Pickers:** Machines that only pick the cobs from the standing plants, leaving the stalks in the field. The picked cobs are then transported for separate de-husking and shelling.

After harvesting, whether manually or mechanically, the cobs are typically de-husked and then shelled to separate the grain. The grain should be further dried to a safe moisture content (around 12-14%) before storage to prevent mould growth and insect infestation.
