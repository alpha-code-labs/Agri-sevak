As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for weed control in Maize (Makka) for Haryana.

First, let's address the specific weeds mentioned:

*   **Amarbail (Cuscuta spp.):** This is not known to affect Maize (Makka). Maize is a monocotyledonous plant and generally not a host for *Cuscuta*.
*   **Orobanche (Broomrape):** This is not known to affect Maize (Makka). *Orobanche* species are parasitic on dicotyledonous plants, not monocots like maize.

For the weeds that are known to affect Maize (Makka), namely Broadleaf Weeds (including Bathu and Congress grass) and Narrowleaf Weeds (including Phalaris minor), the following integrated weed management strategies and chemical control measures are recommended:

**Integrated Weed Management (IWM) Approach:**
A combination of cultural practices and chemical control provides the most effective and sustainable weed management.

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Timely Sowing:** Sowing at the optimal time helps the crop establish quickly and compete better with weeds.
    *   **Proper Spacing:** Maintaining recommended plant spacing allows for better crop growth and canopy closure, suppressing weed growth.
    *   **Inter-cultivation/Manual Weeding:** One or two manual weedings or inter-cultivation operations (e.g., hoeing) at 20-25 and 40-45 days after sowing can significantly reduce weed pressure.

2.  **Chemical Control:**
    Herbicides can be applied as pre-emergence (before crop and weed emergence) or post-emergence (after crop and weed emergence).

    **A. Pre-emergence Herbicides (Apply within 0-3 days after sowing):**
    These herbicides are applied to the soil surface after sowing but before the emergence of the crop and weeds. Ensure adequate soil moisture for optimal efficacy.

    *   For Broadleaf and Narrowleaf Weeds:
        *   **Atrazine** 50% WP: 1.0 - 1.2 kg/acre (dissolved in 200-250 L water).
        *   **Pendimethalin** 30% EC: 1.0 - 1.3 L/acre (dissolved in 200-250 L water).
        *   **S-Metolachlor** 96% EC: 400 ml/acre (dissolved in 200-250 L water).
        *   For broader spectrum control, a tank mix of **Atrazine** 50% WP (500 g/acre) + **Pendimethalin** 30% EC (1.0 L/acre) can be used.

    **B. Post-emergence Herbicides (Apply when weeds are at 2-4 leaf stage, typically 15-25 days after sowing):**
    These herbicides are applied after the crop and weeds have emerged.

    *   **For Broadleaf Weeds (including Bathu, Congress grass):**
        *   **2,4-D Amine Salt** 58% SL: 500-600 ml/acre (dissolved in 200-250 L water). Apply when maize is at the 4-5 leaf stage.
        *   **Atrazine** 50% WP: 500 g/acre (dissolved in 200-250 L water) as early post-emergence (15-20 DAS).
        *   **Dicamba** 38% SL: 120 ml/acre (dissolved in 200-250 L water). Apply when maize is at the 3-5 leaf stage.

    *   **For Narrowleaf Weeds (Grasses, including Phalaris minor) and some Broadleaf Weeds:**
        *   **Nicosulfuron** 75% WG: 16 g/acre (dissolved in 200-250 L water). Apply when weeds are at the 2-4 leaf stage. Always use with a non-ionic surfactant as per product label.
        *   **Topramezone** 33.6% SC: 25-30 ml/acre (dissolved in 200-250 L water). Apply when weeds are at the 2-4 leaf stage. Always use with a non-ionic surfactant as per product label.
        *   **Tembotrione** 34.4% SC: 115 ml/acre (dissolved in 200-250 L water). Apply when weeds are at the 2-4 leaf stage. Always use with a non-ionic surfactant as per product label.
        *   **Mesotrione** 48% SC: 100 ml/acre (dissolved in 200-250 L water). Apply when weeds are at the 2-4 leaf stage. Always use with a non-ionic surfactant as per product label.

    *   **For Mixed Weed Flora (Broadleaf + Narrowleaf):**
        *   A tank mix of **Nicosulfuron** 75% WG (16 g/acre) + **Atrazine** 50% WP (500 g/acre) can be used for broader spectrum control. Always use with a non-ionic surfactant.

**Important Considerations for Herbicide Application:**

*   **Read the Label:** Always refer to and strictly follow the instructions on the herbicide product label for dosage, application timing, safety precautions, and specific recommendations.
*   **Water Volume:** Use adequate water volume (200-250 L per acre) for uniform spray coverage.
*   **Nozzle Type:** Use a flat fan nozzle for herbicide application to ensure even distribution.
*   **Weather Conditions:** Avoid spraying on windy days to prevent drift to non-target areas. Do not spray if rain is expected within 6-8 hours.
*   **Soil Moisture:** Ensure sufficient soil moisture for pre-emergence herbicides to be effective. For post-emergence herbicides, avoid application if the crop is under severe moisture stress.
*   **Crop Stage:** Apply herbicides at the recommended crop and weed growth stages for optimal efficacy and crop safety.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate herbicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of herbicide resistance in weeds.
*   **Crop Health:** Do not apply herbicides if the crop is under stress from drought, waterlogging, nutrient deficiency, or insect/disease damage.
