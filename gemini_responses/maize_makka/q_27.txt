Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide you with the scientifically verified requirements for Maize (Makka) cultivation in Haryana.

Here are the suitable climate, soil type, and drainage requirements for Maize:

### Climate Requirements for Maize (Makka)

Maize is a warm-season crop and thrives under specific climatic conditions:

*   **Temperature:**
    *   **Optimum for Germination:** 21-27°C.
    *   **Optimum for Growth:** 20-30°C.
    *   **Minimum Temperature:** Growth is severely hampered below 10°C.
    *   **Maximum Temperature:** Temperatures above 35°C, especially during flowering and grain filling, can negatively impact yield.
    *   Maize is highly susceptible to frost, which can cause significant damage.
*   **Rainfall:**
    *   Requires 500-750 mm of well-distributed rainfall during its growing season.
    *   Critical stages for water requirement are tasseling, silking, and grain filling.
    *   The Kharif season in Haryana, with its monsoon rains, is generally suitable, but supplementary irrigation may be needed during dry spells.
*   **Sunlight:** Requires bright sunshine for optimal photosynthesis and yield development.

### Soil Type Requirements for Maize (Makka)

Maize can adapt to a range of soils but performs best in:

*   **Texture:** Loamy to sandy loam soils are ideal. Clay loam soils can also be suitable if they have good drainage. Heavy clay soils that are prone to waterlogging should be avoided.
*   **pH:** A soil pH range of 6.0 to 7.5 (slightly acidic to neutral) is considered optimal for nutrient availability and maize growth.
*   **Organic Matter:** Well-drained soils rich in organic matter are highly preferred as they improve soil structure, water holding capacity, and nutrient retention.
*   **Fertility:** Fertile soils with good nutrient status are essential for achieving high yields.

### Drainage Requirements for Maize (Makka)

Maize is highly sensitive to waterlogging:

*   **Well-Drained Soils:** It requires well-drained soils where water does not stand for prolonged periods.
*   **Root Aeration:** The roots of maize need adequate oxygen, and waterlogging deprives them of this, leading to root damage, nutrient uptake issues, and stunted growth.
*   **Impact of Waterlogging:** Even 24-48 hours of standing water in the root zone can significantly reduce yield.
*   **Field Preparation:** Proper land leveling and provision for surface drainage are crucial to prevent water accumulation, especially during heavy monsoon rains.
