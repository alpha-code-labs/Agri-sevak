As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Maize (Makka) in Haryana.

Effective management of fungal diseases in maize requires an Integrated Disease Management (IDM) approach, combining cultural practices, resistant varieties, and judicious use of CIBRC-approved fungicides.

**General Integrated Disease Management (IDM) Principles for Maize Fungal Diseases:**

1.  **Resistant Varieties:** Always choose maize hybrids/varieties known to be resistant or tolerant to prevalent diseases in your region. Consult HAU or local KVKs for recommended varieties.
2.  **Crop Rotation:** Rotate maize with non-host crops (e.g., legumes, wheat) to break disease cycles and reduce inoculum build-up in the soil.
3.  **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected crop debris after harvest to reduce primary inoculum sources.
4.  **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure balanced fertilization, as excessive nitrogen can sometimes increase susceptibility to certain diseases.
5.  **Proper Plant Spacing:** Maintain optimal plant spacing to ensure good air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce humidity and fungal growth.
6.  **Timely Sowing:** Sow maize at the recommended time to avoid periods of high disease pressure.
7.  **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds with recommended fungicides, especially for soil-borne or seed-borne diseases and early seedling protection.

            *   **Tebuconazole 25.9% EC:** 250-300 ml/acre in 200-300 L of water.

3.  **Blast (Maize Blast)**
    *   **Affects Maize:** Yes, it is an emerging and potentially serious disease in some regions.
    *   **Control:**
        *   Use resistant varieties if available for your region.
        *   Avoid planting in areas with high humidity and prolonged leaf wetness.
        *   Foliar application of fungicides at the appearance of initial symptoms:
            *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:** 200 ml/acre in 200-300 L of water.
            *   **Pyraclostrobin 20% WG:** 150-200 g/acre in 200-300 L of water.

4.  **Blight (e.g., Southern Corn Leaf Blight, Northern Corn Leaf Blight)**
    *   **Affects Maize:** Yes, these are common and economically important diseases.
    *   **Control:**
        *   Plant resistant/tolerant hybrids.
        *   Practice crop rotation and proper residue management.
        *   Foliar application of fungicides when symptoms appear and environmental conditions favor disease development:
            *   **Mancozeb 75% WP:** 1.5-2.0 kg/acre in 500-600 L of water.
            *   **Propiconazole 25% EC:** 200-250 ml/acre in 200-300 L of water.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the fungicide label for precise dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of fungicide resistance.
*   Consult your local Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or HAU extension specialist for the most current and specific recommendations tailored to your local conditions and specific maize varieties.
