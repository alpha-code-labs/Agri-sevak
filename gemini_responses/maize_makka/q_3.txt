Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding various rot types in Maize (Makka). Rots are a significant group of diseases that can affect maize at all growth stages, from seed to maturity, leading to substantial yield losses. These include Seed Rot, Seedling Rot, Root Rot, Collar Rot, Foot Rot, Stem Rot, Crown Rot, Neck Rot, and Ear Rots (which can be considered a form of "Fruit Rot" for maize kernels). Blackening can be a symptom of many of these rots.

Effective control requires an Integrated Disease Management (IDM) approach, combining cultural practices with judicious use of CIBRC-approved chemical fungicides.

### Integrated Disease Management (IDM) for Rot Control in Maize:

**A. Cultural and Agronomic Practices (Preventive Measures):**

1.  **Resistant Varieties:** Select maize varieties known to be resistant or tolerant to common rot diseases prevalent in your area. Consult with HAU experts or local agricultural extension for suitable varieties.
2.  **Crop Rotation:** Avoid continuous maize cultivation. Rotate maize with non-host crops like wheat, mustard, or legumes for at least 2-3 years to reduce pathogen inoculum in the soil.
3.  **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris from the previous crop. Deep ploughing after harvest can help bury and decompose infected residues, reducing pathogen survival.
4.  **Good Drainage:** Ensure proper field drainage to prevent waterlogging, especially during heavy rains, as excessive moisture favors the development of many rot-causing fungi (e.g., *Pythium*).
5.  **Balanced Nutrition:** Apply balanced fertilizers based on soil test recommendations. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can make plants more susceptible to stalk rots. Adequate potassium helps in strengthening stalks.
6.  **Optimal Plant Spacing:** Maintain recommended plant spacing to ensure good air circulation, which helps in reducing humidity around the plants.
7.  **Timely Sowing:** Sow maize at the optimal time for your region. Early or late sowing can expose plants to conditions favorable for disease development.
8.  **Weed Control:** Keep fields free of weeds, as some weeds can act as alternate hosts for rot pathogens.
9.  **Avoid Mechanical Injury:** Minimize any mechanical injury to plants during intercultural operations, as wounds can serve as entry points for pathogens.

**B. Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved Fungicides):**

Chemical control is primarily focused on seed treatment for early-stage rots and targeted application for later-stage stalk/stem rots.

1.  **For Seed Rot and Seedling Rot (Seed Treatment):**
    Seed treatment is crucial for protecting seeds from soil-borne pathogens causing seed rot and damping-off (seedling rot).

    *   **Carbendazim 50% WP** @ 2 grams per kg of seed.
    *   **Thiram 75% WS** @ 2.5-3 grams per kg of seed.
    *   **Captan 75% WS** @ 2.5 grams per kg of seed.
    *   **Tebuconazole 2% DS** @ 2.5 grams per kg of seed.
    *   For broader spectrum protection, especially against *Pythium* species, a combination product can be used:
        *   **Metalaxyl-M 31.8% ES** @ 3 ml per kg of seed (often combined with other fungicides).

2.  **For Root Rot, Collar Rot, Foot Rot, Stem Rot, Crown Rot, Neck Rot (Drenching/Spraying):**
    Once these rots appear in the standing crop, control becomes challenging. Early detection and targeted application are key. Drenching the base of the plant is generally more effective than foliar sprays for these types of rots.

    *   **Carbendazim 50% WP** @ 1-2 grams per litre of water. Drench 100-150 ml of solution around the base of each affected plant.
    *   **Propiconazole 25% EC** @ 1 ml per litre of water. Drench 100-150 ml of solution around the base of each affected plant.
    *   For rots primarily caused by oomycetes like *Pythium* (often associated with waterlogging):
        *   **Metalaxyl-M 35% WS** @ 1-2 grams per litre of water. Drench 100-150 ml of solution around the base of each affected plant.

3.  **For Ear Rots (Post-flowering):**
    Direct chemical control for established ear rots is generally not very effective. The focus should be on preventive measures and managing stalk rots, as stalk rot pathogens can also lead to ear rots.

    *   Maintain good plant health through balanced nutrition and irrigation.
    *   Control insect pests that damage ears, as wounds provide entry points for fungi.
    *   Harvest at physiological maturity to avoid prolonged exposure in the field.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the fungicide label regarding dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in pathogens.
*   Consult with your local HAU extension specialist for specific recommendations tailored to the prevailing disease situation in your area.

By adopting these integrated strategies, you can effectively manage various rot diseases in your maize crop and ensure a healthy harvest.
