As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following cultivation practices for Maize (Makka) in Haryana:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   Maize should ideally be sown in rows using a seed drill.
    *   The **ridge and furrow method** is highly recommended, especially for areas prone to waterlogging or for efficient irrigation management. Sowing on the side of the ridges helps in better drainage and aeration for roots.
    *   **Zero-tillage** maize cultivation is also an effective method for resource conservation and can be adopted where suitable equipment is available.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   The optimal planting depth for maize seeds is **3-5 cm**.
    *   Ensure uniform depth for consistent germination and emergence. Deeper sowing can delay emergence, while shallower sowing can lead to poor anchorage and moisture stress.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   Maintain a row-to-row spacing of **75 cm**.
    *   Maintain a plant-to-plant spacing of **20 cm**.
    *   This spacing aims for an optimal plant population of approximately 65,000-70,000 plants per acre, which is crucial for maximizing yield.

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   For grain maize (hybrid/composite varieties), a seed dose of **20-25 kg per acre** is recommended.
    *   Adjust the seed rate slightly based on seed size and germination percentage to achieve the desired plant population.
