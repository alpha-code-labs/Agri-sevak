As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), here are the scientifically verified recommendations for the application of organic manures in Maize (Makka) in Haryana:

The application of organic manures significantly improves soil health, fertility, and water retention capacity, leading to better crop yields.

*   **Farm Yard Manure (FYM):**
    *   Apply **10-15 tonnes per acre** of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM).
    *   It should be thoroughly incorporated into the soil 2-3 weeks before sowing the maize crop.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   As an alternative or supplement to FYM, apply **2-4 tonnes per acre** of Vermicompost.
    *   Vermicompost should also be incorporated into the soil before sowing.

*   **Sagarika:**
    *   Sagarika is a seaweed extract-based bio-stimulant, not a bulk organic manure like FYM or Vermicompost. It is used to enhance plant growth, nutrient uptake, and stress tolerance.
    *   **Foliar Application:** The recommended dose is typically **250-500 ml per acre**, mixed with sufficient water (e.g., 150-200 litres) and sprayed during critical growth stages, such as the knee-high stage and pre-tasseling.
    *   **Soil Application/Drenching:** For soil application or drenching, the dose can be **1-2 litres per acre**, mixed with irrigation water or applied directly to the soil.
    *   Always refer to the product label for specific instructions, timings, and safety precautions, as formulations and recommendations can vary.

**Important Note:** For precise recommendations, it is always advisable to conduct a soil test to understand the specific nutrient status and organic carbon content of your field. This allows for tailored nutrient management plans.
