Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I will provide scientifically verified advice for controlling rust diseases in Maize (Makka) in Haryana.

Here's the information regarding the rust diseases you mentioned:

### 1. Black Rust (Common Rust - *Puccinia sorghi*) and Brown Rust (Southern Rust - *Puccinia polysora*)

Both Black Rust (Common Rust) and Brown Rust (often referring to Southern Rust in warmer regions like Haryana) are significant diseases of Maize. Southern Rust (*Puccinia polysora*) is particularly aggressive in warm, humid conditions. The control measures for both are largely similar.

**Symptoms:**
*   **Common Rust:** Pustules are cinnamon-brown, circular to oval, scattered on both leaf surfaces, later turning dark brown to black.
*   **Southern Rust:** Pustules are smaller, circular, light orange to cinnamon-brown, typically found on the upper leaf surface, often appearing in dense clusters.

**Integrated Management for Black Rust and Brown Rust:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Resistant Varieties:** The most effective and economical control measure is to plant rust-resistant or tolerant maize varieties. Consult with HAU or local agricultural extension for recommended varieties suitable for Haryana.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate maize with non-host crops to reduce inoculum build-up in the soil.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest to reduce overwintering inoculum.
    *   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure balanced fertilization, avoiding excessive nitrogen, which can make plants more susceptible.
    *   **Proper Spacing:** Maintain optimal plant spacing to ensure good air circulation, which helps reduce humidity and disease development.

*   **Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
    *   Fungicides are effective if applied at the early stages of disease development, typically when the first pustules appear.
    *   Repeat application may be necessary depending on disease severity and weather conditions.
    *   **Recommended CIBRC Approved Fungicides:**
        *   **Propiconazole 25% EC**: Apply at 1 ml per litre of water (200 ml per acre) in 200 litres of water.
        *   **Tebuconazole 25.9% EC**: Apply at 1 ml per litre of water (200 ml per acre) in 200 litres of water.
        *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC**: Apply at 1 ml per litre of water (200 ml per acre) in 200 litres of water.
        *   **Pyraclostrobin 20% WG**: Apply at 0.75 g per litre of water (150 g per acre) in 200 litres of water.

### 2. Yellow Rust

In Maize, the term "Yellow Rust" often refers to Southern Rust (*Puccinia polysora*) due to the yellowish-orange colour of its pustules, especially when fresh. The control measures are the same as those listed above for Black Rust and Brown Rust.

### 3. White Rust (*Albugo candida*)

This is not known to affect Maize (Makka). White rust primarily affects cruciferous crops like mustard, radish, and cauliflower.

### 4. Red Rust

"Red Rust" is not a distinct, recognized rust disease of Maize. The pustules of Common Rust (*Puccinia sorghi*) can appear reddish-brown, especially when young, before turning dark brown to black. Therefore, if you observe reddish-brown pustules, it is likely Common Rust, and the control measures for Black Rust apply.
