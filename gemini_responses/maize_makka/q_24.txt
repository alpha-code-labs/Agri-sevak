Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I must inform you that **transplantation is generally not the recommended or ideal practice for Maize (Makka) cultivation in Haryana.**

Maize is a crop that establishes a strong taproot system early on. Transplanting can cause significant root damage and transplant shock, leading to:
*   Stunted growth
*   Delayed maturity
*   Reduced nutrient uptake
*   Ultimately, lower yields compared to direct sowing.

Therefore, for optimal growth and yield in Haryana, **direct sowing** is the scientifically recommended method. Below is the ideal time, distance, and process for direct sowing Maize:

### Ideal Direct Sowing for Maize (Makka)

**1. Ideal Sowing Time:**

*   **Kharif (Monsoon) Maize:** Mid-June to Mid-July. This period aligns with the onset of monsoon rains, which is crucial for rainfed maize, and provides optimal growing conditions.
*   **Spring Maize:** Mid-February to Mid-March. This is suitable for specific hybrids and regions with assured irrigation facilities.

**2. Ideal Sowing Distance:**

Maintaining proper spacing is crucial for adequate sunlight, nutrient, and water uptake, leading to healthy plant development and good yields.

*   **Row-to-Row Distance:** 60-75 cm
*   **Plant-to-Plant Distance:** 20-25 cm
*   This spacing aims for an optimal plant population of approximately 60,000 to 80,000 plants per acre.

**3. Ideal Sowing Process:**

*   **Land Preparation:**
    *   Plough the field 2-3 times to achieve a fine tilth.
    *   Perform harrowing to break clods and level the field. A well-prepared, level seedbed ensures uniform germination and efficient irrigation.
*   **Seed Treatment:**
    *   Seed treatment is vital to protect young seedlings from early-season diseases and pests, ensuring better germination and stand establishment.
    *   Treat seeds with a combination of fungicide and insecticide:
        *   **Fungicide:** Treat with **Carbendazim** 12% + **Mancozeb** 63% WP @ 2-3 g per kg of seed, or **Thiram** 75% WS @ 2.5-3 g per kg of seed, to protect against seed-borne and soil-borne fungal diseases.
        *   **Insecticide:** Treat with **Imidacloprid** 600 FS @ 4-6 ml per kg of seed, or **Fipronil** 5% SC @ 6-10 ml per kg of seed, to protect against early shoot borers, termites, and other sucking pests.
*   **Sowing Depth:**
    *   Sow seeds at a depth of 3-5 cm. Deeper sowing can delay emergence, while shallower sowing can expose seeds to birds or lead to poor root development.
*   **Sowing Method:**
    *   Use a seed drill or planter for uniform sowing and spacing. If sowing manually behind the plough, ensure consistent depth and spacing.
*   **Thinning:**
    *   After 10-15 days of sowing, when plants have developed 2-3 leaves, perform thinning. Remove weaker or excess seedlings to maintain a single healthy plant per hill at the recommended plant-to-plant distance. This ensures each plant gets adequate resources.

By following these direct sowing practices, you can achieve a healthy maize crop and maximize your yields.
