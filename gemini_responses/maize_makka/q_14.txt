As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling soil pests like termites and root-knot nematodes in Maize (Makka) in Haryana.

It is crucial to adopt an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, mechanical, and chemical methods for effective and sustainable pest control.

### Control of Termites (Deemak) in Maize (Makka)

Termites are a significant pest in maize, especially in dryland areas, causing damage to roots and the base of the stem, leading to wilting and plant death.

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy crop residues, stubbles, and any woody debris from the field, as these can serve as food sources and breeding sites for termites.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** Summer deep ploughing exposes termite colonies to the sun and predators, disrupting their nests.
*   **Irrigation:** Adequate irrigation can reduce termite activity, as they prefer drier conditions.
*   **Farmyard Manure (FYM):** Ensure well-decomposed FYM is used, as undecomposed organic matter can attract termites.

**2. Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved):**

*   **Pre-sowing Soil Treatment:**
    *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC**: Apply 2.5 Litres per acre. Mix with 200-400 litres of water and spray evenly on the soil surface before the last ploughing, then incorporate into the soil.
    *   **Fipronil 0.3% G**: Apply 6.6-10 kg per acre. Broadcast evenly and incorporate into the soil before sowing.

*   **Seed Treatment:**
    *   **Imidacloprid 600 FS**: Treat seeds at the rate of 4-7 ml per kg of seed. This provides early protection against termites and other sucking pests.

### Control of Nematodes (Root-knot) in Maize (Makka)

Root-knot nematodes (primarily *Meloidogyne* species) can cause significant damage to maize roots, leading to stunted growth, nutrient deficiency symptoms, and reduced yields.

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate maize with non-host crops (e.g., certain cereals like wheat, or specific varieties of pearl millet) for at least 2-3 years to reduce nematode populations in the soil. Avoid continuous maize cultivation or rotation with highly susceptible crops.
*   **Summer Deep Ploughing:** Exposing the soil to high summer temperatures through deep ploughing (solarization effect) can significantly reduce nematode populations.
*   **Use of Resistant/Tolerant Varieties:** If available and suitable for Haryana conditions, planting maize varieties known to be resistant or tolerant to root-knot nematodes can be an effective strategy.
*   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporating well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost can improve soil health and enhance the activity of beneficial microorganisms that prey on nematodes.

**2. Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved):**

Please note that specific chemical nematicides explicitly approved by the Central Insecticides Board & Registration Committee (CIBRC) for direct control of nematodes in maize are limited. Many chemicals with nematicidal properties are approved for other crops or for other pests in maize (e.g., shoot fly, stem borer) and may offer incidental nematode suppression. However, based on current CIBRC approvals for *nematodes specifically in maize*, there are no widely recommended chemical nematicides. Therefore, cultural practices remain the primary and most effective method for managing root-knot nematodes in maize.
