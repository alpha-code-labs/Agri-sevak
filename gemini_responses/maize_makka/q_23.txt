As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified seed and soil treatment processes for Maize (Makka) in Haryana:

### Recommended Seed Treatment for Maize (Makka)

Seed treatment is crucial for protecting young maize seedlings from early-season pests and diseases, ensuring better germination and stand establishment.

*   **For protection against seed-borne diseases (e.g., seed rot, seedling blight) and early season fungal infections:**
    *   Treat seeds with **Thiram** @ 2.5-3 g/kg seed.
    *   Alternatively, a combination product like **Carbendazim** 12% + **Mancozeb** 63% WP @ 2.5 g/kg seed can be used.
*   **For protection against downy mildew (a major disease in maize):**
    *   Treat seeds with **Metalaxyl** 35% WS @ 6 g/kg seed.
*   **For protection against early season insect pests (e.g., shoot fly, stem borer):**
    *   Treat seeds with **Imidacloprid** 600 FS @ 6-7 ml/kg seed.
    *   Alternatively, **Thiamethoxam** 30% FS @ 10 ml/kg seed.
*   **Integrated Approach:** For comprehensive protection, it is highly recommended to use a combination of a fungicide and an insecticide. For instance, treating seeds with **Metalaxyl** (for downy mildew) along with **Imidacloprid** or **Thiamethoxam** (for insect pests) provides broad-spectrum protection. Ensure proper mixing and uniform coating of the seeds.

### Recommended Soil Treatment for Maize (Makka)

Soil treatment primarily targets soil-borne insect pests and can also help in managing certain soil-borne diseases.

*   **For management of termites and other soil-borne insect pests (e.g., cutworms, white grubs if prevalent):**
    *   Apply **Fipronil** 0.3% GR @ 6-8 kg/acre at the time of sowing in furrows, or broadcast and lightly incorporate into the soil before sowing.
    *   Alternatively, if termites are a severe problem, **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC @ 2 L/acre can be mixed with 20-30 kg of sand and broadcast evenly before the last ploughing, or applied as a drench near the root zone after germination.
*   **For management of soil-borne fungal diseases and promoting soil health:**
    *   Incorporate bio-fungicides like *Trichoderma viride* @ 2.5 kg/acre. This should be mixed with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost and broadcast evenly before the last ploughing. This helps in suppressing soil-borne pathogens and improving soil microbial activity.
