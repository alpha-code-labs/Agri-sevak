As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling smut diseases in Maize (Makka) in Haryana:

First, let's clarify the smut diseases mentioned:

*   **False Smut:** This is not known to affect Maize (Makka). False smut is primarily a disease of rice.
*   **Loose Smut:** This is not known to affect Maize (Makka). Loose smut is primarily a disease of wheat and barley.

The smut diseases that commonly affect Maize (Makka) in Haryana are:

1.  **Common Smut (also referred to as Black Smut or Kernel Smut in some contexts):** Caused by *Ustilago maydis*. This disease can affect any above-ground part of the plant, forming large, irregular galls on ears, tassels, stalks, and leaves.
2.  **Head Smut (also referred to as Kernel Smut in some contexts):** Caused by *Sporisorium reilianum*. This disease typically replaces the entire ear or tassel with a large, sooty mass of spores, often covered by a thin membrane that ruptures to release spores.

Here are the recommended control measures for Common Smut and Head Smut in Maize:

### Integrated Disease Management for Smut Diseases in Maize

**A. Cultural Practices (Applicable for both Common Smut and Head Smut):**

*   **Resistant Varieties:** Plant maize varieties known to be resistant or tolerant to smut diseases. Consult with HAU extension services for the latest recommendations on suitable varieties for Haryana.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops (e.g., wheat, mustard, pulses) for at least 2-3 years. This helps reduce the build-up of soil-borne inoculum, especially for Head Smut.
*   **Sanitation:**
    *   **For Common Smut:** Carefully remove and destroy galls before they mature and rupture to release spores. Do not feed infected plant parts to livestock as spores can pass through the digestive system and remain viable.
    *   **For Head Smut:** Remove and destroy infected plants before the spore masses rupture. Deep ploughing after harvest can help bury spores and reduce their viability.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, as it can sometimes promote lush growth that is more susceptible to Common Smut. Ensure balanced application of NPK fertilizers based on soil test recommendations.
*   **Avoid Mechanical Injury:** Minimize mechanical damage to plants during cultivation, as wounds can serve as entry points for the Common Smut pathogen.
*   **Proper Plant Spacing:** Maintain recommended plant spacing to ensure good air circulation, which can help reduce humidity and stress on plants.

**B. Chemical Control (Primarily for Head Smut, and for early Common Smut infection):**

Seed treatment is the most effective chemical control measure, especially for Head Smut, which is primarily soil-borne and infects seedlings systemically.

*   **Seed Treatment:** Treat maize seeds with a recommended systemic fungicide before sowing. This protects the young seedlings from infection.

    *   **Option 1:** Treat seeds with **Carboxin 37.5% + Thiram 37.5% DS** at the rate of 2-3 g per kg of seed.
    *   **Option 2:** Treat seeds with **Tebuconazole 2% DS** at the rate of 2-3 g per kg of seed.
    *   **Option 3:** Treat seeds with **Difenoconazole 3% FS** at the rate of 1-1.5 ml per kg of seed.

**Note:** Once galls of Common Smut have formed, chemical sprays are generally not effective. The focus should be on preventive measures and sanitation. For Head Smut, seed treatment is critical as the infection occurs at the seedling stage.

Always ensure to follow the instructions on the fungicide label for safe and effective use.
