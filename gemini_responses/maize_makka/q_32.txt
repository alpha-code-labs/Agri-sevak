Drying up of leaves, fruits (kernels/cobs), and flowers (tassels/silks) in Maize (Makka) is a general symptom that can be caused by a variety of factors, both abiotic (environmental) and biotic (diseases and pests). It is crucial to accurately diagnose the underlying cause to implement effective management strategies. "Drying branches" is not a typical symptom for maize as it does not have branches in the conventional sense.

Here's how to address the potential causes of drying up in Maize:

**I. Abiotic Stresses (Environmental Factors)**

These are often the most common causes of general drying symptoms.

1.  **Water Stress (Drought):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Leaves roll inward, turn yellow, and eventually dry from the margins inwards. Stunted growth, poor cob formation, and shriveled kernels.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Ensure timely and adequate irrigation, especially during critical growth stages (knee-high, tasseling, silking, and grain filling).
        *   Adopt water-saving techniques like mulching with crop residues to conserve soil moisture.
        *   Consider drought-tolerant maize varieties suitable for Haryana's climate.

2.  **Nutrient Deficiencies:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Specific nutrient deficiencies can cause leaf discoloration and drying. For example, Potassium deficiency causes yellowing and scorching/drying of leaf margins, while Nitrogen deficiency causes yellowing from the leaf tip along the midrib.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Conduct soil testing to determine nutrient status.
        *   Apply balanced fertilizers based on soil test recommendations.
        *   For specific deficiencies, apply the required nutrient as a foliar spray or soil application.

3.  **Heat Stress:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Leaves may scorch, especially during hot, dry winds. Poor pollen viability and silk receptivity can lead to poor kernel set and drying of silks/tassels.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Plant heat-tolerant varieties.
        *   Ensure adequate irrigation to help plants cope with high temperatures.

4.  **Waterlogging:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Although seemingly contradictory to "drying up," prolonged waterlogging damages roots, leading to wilting, yellowing, and eventual drying of the plant due to impaired water and nutrient uptake.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Ensure proper field drainage to prevent water accumulation.
        *   Avoid planting in low-lying areas prone to waterlogging.

**II. Biotic Stresses (Diseases and Pests)**

These can cause localized or systemic drying symptoms.

**A. Diseases:**

1.  **Stalk Rots (e.g., Charcoal Rot, Fusarium Stalk Rot, Bacterial Stalk Rot):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Plants suddenly wilt and dry prematurely, often from the tasseling to grain-filling stage. Stalks become discolored, soft, or shredded internally.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Use resistant or tolerant maize varieties.
        *   Practice crop rotation with non-host crops.
        *   Maintain balanced fertility (avoid excessive nitrogen).
        *   Ensure proper drainage and avoid water stress.
        *   Remove and destroy infected plant debris.
        *   No effective chemical control once the disease is established in the stalk.

2.  **Leaf Blights (e.g., Southern Corn Leaf Blight, Northern Corn Leaf Blight, Maydis Leaf Blight):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Lesions appear on leaves, which can coalesce and cause large areas of the leaf to dry up, leading to premature defoliation and reduced photosynthetic area.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Plant resistant or tolerant varieties.
        *   Practice crop rotation and sanitation (remove infected debris).
        *   For severe infections, especially in susceptible varieties:
            *   Foliar spray with **Mancozeb** at 2.0 kg/acre or **Azoxystrobin** at 200 ml/acre or **Propiconazole** at 200 ml/acre, mixed with 200-400 litres of water, at the appearance of symptoms and repeat if necessary.

3.  **Downy Mildew (e.g., Brown Stripe Downy Mildew):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Systemic infection leads to stunting, chlorosis, and eventually drying of leaves, often with characteristic white downy growth on the underside of leaves.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Use resistant varieties.
        *   Seed treatment with **Metalaxyl** at 6 g/kg seed.
        *   Remove and destroy infected plants (roguing) early in the season.

4.  **Rusts (e.g., Common Rust, Southern Rust):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Pustules (small, raised spots) appear on leaves, which can be reddish-brown (Common Rust) or orange-brown (Southern Rust). Severe infections can lead to premature drying and death of leaves.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Plant resistant varieties.
        *   For severe outbreaks, especially in susceptible varieties:
            *   Foliar spray with **Propiconazole** at 200 ml/acre or **Azoxystrobin** at 200 ml/acre, mixed with 200-400 litres of water, at the appearance of symptoms and repeat if necessary.

**B. Pests:**

1.  **Maize Stem Borer (Chilo partellus):**
    *   **Symptoms:** In young plants, it causes "dead heart" (central shoot dries up). In older plants, larvae bore into the stem, damaging vascular tissues, leading to wilting and drying of the upper plant parts or premature drying of the entire plant.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Use resistant varieties.
        *   Remove and destroy stubbles after harvest.
        *   For early infestation, apply granules in the leaf whorl:
            *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 0.4% GR at 4 kg/acre.
            *   **Fipronil** 0.3% GR at 6.6-10 kg/acre.
        *   For severe infestation, foliar spray:
            *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG at 80 g/acre.
            *   **Spinetoram** 11.7% SC at 75 ml/acre.

2.  **Root Feeders (e.g., White Grubs, Termites):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Damage to roots impairs water and nutrient uptake, leading to wilting, yellowing, and eventual drying of the entire plant.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Deep ploughing during summer to expose grubs.
        *   Apply insecticides at the time of sowing or transplanting:
            *   **Fipronil** 0.3% GR at 6.6-10 kg/acre as soil application.

3.  **Mites (e.g., Spider Mites):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Tiny mites feed on the underside of leaves, causing stippling, bronzing, and eventually drying of leaves, especially under hot, dry conditions. Fine webbing may be visible.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Ensure adequate irrigation to reduce plant stress.
        *   For severe infestations, apply miticides:
            *   **Spiromesifen** 22.9% SC at 120 ml/acre.
            *   **Propargite** 57% EC at 500 ml/acre.

**Recommendation:**

The first and most critical step is to **accurately identify the specific cause** of the drying symptoms. Observe the pattern of drying, presence of lesions, insect damage, or other specific signs. If unsure, collect samples and consult with the plant pathology or entomology experts at HAU, Hisar, or your local Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) for precise diagnosis and tailored recommendations.
