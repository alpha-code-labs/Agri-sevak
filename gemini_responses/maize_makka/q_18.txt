As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the use of Growth Regulators/Hormones and Boron in Maize (Makka) for Haryana conditions:

Regarding the use of **Ethephon** (Ethrel) and **2,4-D** as *growth regulators/hormones* for general maize (Makka) cultivation in Haryana, it is important to clarify their roles:

*   **Ethephon (Ethrel)**
    *   While **Ethephon** is a plant growth regulator used in some crops for specific purposes (e.g., ripening, defoliation), its application as a growth regulator/hormone for enhancing yield or modifying growth in general maize (Makka) cultivation is **not a standard recommended practice** in Haryana.

*   **2,4-D**
    *   **2,4-D** is primarily a selective herbicide widely used for broadleaf weed control in maize (Makka) at specific growth stages and doses. Its use as a *growth regulator/hormone* at very low concentrations is **not a standard or recommended practice** for general maize (Makka) cultivation in Haryana due to the precise dosage requirements and potential for phytotoxicity if misapplied. Farmers should only use **2,4-D** as a herbicide as per recommended guidelines for weed control.

*   **Boron**
    *   Boron is an essential micronutrient, not a hormone or growth regulator itself, but it plays a crucial role in various physiological processes vital for plant growth, including cell wall formation, sugar transport, pollen germination, and seed development. Its deficiency can severely impact maize yield.
    *   **Recommended Dose and Application:**
        *   **Soil Application (if severe deficiency is confirmed by soil test):**
            *   Apply 1-2 kg of **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate, containing 10.5% Boron) per acre, mixed with fertilizers at the time of sowing.
        *   **Foliar Application (for quick correction or mild deficiency):**
            *   Prepare a 0.1-0.2% solution of **Borax** or **Boric acid** (Orthoboric acid).
            *   This translates to 1-2 grams of **Borax** or **Boric acid** per litre of water.
            *   Spray 200-250 litres of this solution per acre.
            *   **Timing:** Apply at the V6-V8 leaf stage (when the plant has 6-8 fully developed leaves) or before tasseling, especially if deficiency symptoms (e.g., poor ear development, barren tips, zigzag stalks) are observed. A second spray can be given 10-15 days later if symptoms persist.

Always ensure that any application of nutrients or chemicals is based on soil test reports and specific crop requirements to avoid over-application or nutrient imbalances.
