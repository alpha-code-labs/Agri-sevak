As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling sucking pests in Maize (Makka) in Haryana.

First, regarding one of the pests you mentioned:
*   This is not known to affect Maize (Makka).

Now, let's address the control of Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips in Maize (Makka):

Effective management of sucking pests involves an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods.

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Timely Sowing:** Sow maize at the recommended time for your region to avoid peak pest populations.
*   **Weed Management:** Keep fields free of weeds, as many weeds can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
*   **Balanced Fertilization:** Avoid excessive nitrogen application, as it can lead to lush growth that is more attractive to sucking pests.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation to break pest cycles.

**2. Biological Control:**
*   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Protect and encourage natural predators like ladybird beetles, lacewings, hoverfly larvae, and parasitic wasps, which feed on aphids and other soft-bodied insects. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides unless absolutely necessary.

**3. Chemical Control (When pest populations exceed economic threshold levels):**
When pest incidence is high and causing significant damage, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always scout your fields regularly to determine pest levels. Apply insecticides only when necessary, following label instructions carefully.

Here are some CIBRC approved technical chemical names for controlling these sucking pests in Maize:

*   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply 100-125 ml per acre in 200-300 litres of water. Effective against aphids, leafhoppers, and whiteflies.
*   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply 40-50 g per acre in 200-300 litres of water. Provides good control of aphids, leafhoppers, and whiteflies.
*   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply 80-100 g per acre in 200-300 litres of water. Effective against aphids, whiteflies, and thrips.
*   **Dimethoate 30% EC:** Apply 300-400 ml per acre in 200-300 litres of water. A broad-spectrum option effective against aphids, leafhoppers, and thrips.
*   **Flonicamid 50% WG:** Apply 60 g per acre in 200-300 litres of water. A selective insecticide primarily effective against aphids and whiteflies.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Spray Coverage:** Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where many sucking pests reside.
*   **Rotation of Chemicals:** To prevent the development of pesticide resistance, rotate insecticides with different modes of action.
*   **Safety Precautions:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying. Follow all safety instructions on the pesticide label.
*   **Environmental Impact:** Be mindful of the impact on beneficial insects and the environment. Apply chemicals judiciously.

For specific recommendations tailored to your local conditions and current pest pressure, it is always advisable to consult with the agricultural extension services of HAU or your local Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK).
