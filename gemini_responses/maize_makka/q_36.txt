Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice to improve yield, grain quality, and storage life for Maize (Makka) in Haryana.

### **I. Improving Yield in Maize (Makka)**

To maximize your maize yield, focus on the following integrated practices:

1.  **High-Yielding Variety Selection:**
    *   Choose improved hybrid varieties recommended by HAU or ICAR for your specific agro-climatic zone in Haryana. These hybrids are bred for higher yield potential, disease resistance, and adaptability.

2.  **Timely Sowing:**
    *   Sow maize at the optimal time (typically mid-June to mid-July for Kharif, and February for Spring maize) to ensure the crop benefits from favorable weather conditions throughout its growth cycle.

3.  **Optimal Plant Population:**
    *   Maintain a plant population of 60,000 to 75,000 plants per acre. This can be achieved with a spacing of 60-75 cm between rows and 20-25 cm between plants within a row.

4.  **Balanced Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Soil Testing:** Always conduct a soil test to determine specific nutrient deficiencies.
    *   **Nitrogen (N):** Apply 80-100 kg N per acre. Apply 1/3rd at sowing, 1/3rd at knee-high stage, and 1/3rd at tasseling.
    *   **Phosphorus (P):** Apply 24-28 kg P2O5 per acre as a basal dose at sowing.
    *   **Potassium (K):** Apply 16-24 kg K2O per acre as a basal dose at sowing, especially on light soils or where soil tests indicate deficiency.
    *   **Zinc (Zn):** Maize is highly susceptible to zinc deficiency. Apply 10 kg **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (21% Zn) per acre as a basal dose, or spray 0.5% solution of **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (500g in 100 litres of water) 2-3 times at 10-15 day intervals if deficiency symptoms appear.
    *   **Iron (Fe):** In alkaline soils, iron deficiency can occur. Spray 0.5% solution of **Ferrous sulphate** (500g in 100 litres of water) 2-3 times.

5.  **Efficient Water Management:**
    *   Maize is sensitive to water stress, especially during critical stages: tasseling, silking, and grain filling.
    *   Provide irrigation as needed, particularly during dry spells. Avoid waterlogging.

6.  **Integrated Weed Management:**
    *   Weeds compete heavily with maize for nutrients, water, and sunlight, causing significant yield losses.
    *   **Manual Weeding:** Two manual weedings at 20-25 and 40-45 days after sowing are effective.
    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   **Pre-emergence:** Apply **Atrazine** @ 0.5-1.0 kg active ingredient per acre (e.g., 1.0-2.0 kg of 50% WP formulation) within 2-3 days of sowing.
        *   **Post-emergence:** For broad-leaf weeds and some grasses, **2,4-D sodium salt** @ 0.5 kg active ingredient per acre (e.g., 1.25 kg of 80% WP formulation) can be applied 20-25 days after sowing. For mixed weed flora, **Topramezone** @ 25.2 g active ingredient per acre (e.g., 63 ml of 33.6% SC formulation) or **Tembotrione** @ 40 g active ingredient per acre (e.g., 100 ml of 40% SC formulation) can be used with a surfactant 15-20 days after sowing.

7.  **Pest and Disease Management:**
    *   **Fall Armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda):** This is a major pest.
        *   **Early Stage (up to 30 days):** Apply **Chlorantraniliprole** @ 40 ml per acre (18.5% SC) or **Emamectin benzoate** @ 80 g per acre (5% SG) or **Spinetoram** @ 60 ml per acre (11.7% SC) or **Thiamethoxam + Lambda-cyhalothrin** @ 50 g per acre (12.6% ZC + 9.4% ZC).
        *   **Later Stage (after 30 days):** Apply **Chlorantraniliprole** @ 80 ml per acre (18.5% SC) or **Emamectin benzoate** @ 100 g per acre (5% SG) or **Spinetoram** @ 100 ml per acre (11.7% SC). Ensure the spray reaches the whorl.
    *   **Stem Borer:** Use granular insecticides like **Carbofuran** @ 4 kg per acre (3% G) or **Phorate** @ 4 kg per acre (10% G) in the leaf whorls 15-20 days after germination.
    *   **Diseases (e.g., Maydis Leaf Blight, Common Rust):** Choose resistant varieties. If severe, apply fungicides like **Azoxystrobin** @ 200 ml per acre (23% SC) or **Propiconazole** @ 200 ml per acre (25% EC) as per recommendations.

### **II. Improving Grain Quality in Maize (Makka)**

Grain quality refers to characteristics like kernel size, uniformity, nutritional content (protein, starch), and freedom from damage or contamination.

1.  **Variety Selection:**
    *   Choose hybrids specifically known for good grain quality, uniform kernel size, and desired nutritional profiles (e.g., high protein, high oil, or specific starch types if for industrial use).

2.  **Balanced Nutrition:**
    *   Adequate supply of all macro and micronutrients, especially Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Zinc, is crucial for proper kernel development and nutrient accumulation. Nitrogen contributes to protein content, while Phosphorus is vital for energy transfer and grain filling.

3.  **Optimal Water Management:**
    *   Avoid water stress, particularly during the grain filling stage, as it can lead to shriveled, lightweight kernels and reduced quality. Consistent moisture ensures plump, well-filled grains.

4.  **Pest and Disease Control:**
    *   Prevent damage from pests (e.g., cob borers, earworms) and diseases (e.g., ear rots, fungal infections) that can directly affect kernel development, introduce mycotoxins, and reduce market value. Timely application of recommended pesticides/fungicides is important.

5.  **Timely Harvesting:**
    *   Harvest maize at physiological maturity (when the black layer forms at the base of the kernel) and when the grain moisture content is around 20-25%. Harvesting too early leads to immature, shriveled grains, while delayed harvesting can lead to lodging, shattering, and increased risk of fungal infections and pest damage in the field.

### **III. Improving Storage Life for Maize (Makka)**

Proper post-harvest handling and storage are critical to minimize losses and extend the storage life of maize.

1.  **Timely and Careful Harvesting:**
    *   Harvest at the right moisture content (around 20-25%).
    *   Minimize mechanical damage to kernels during harvesting, as damaged kernels are more susceptible to pest and fungal attack.

2.  **Proper Drying:**
    *   Reduce grain moisture content to a safe level of 12-14% for long-term storage. Higher moisture content promotes mold growth and insect infestation.
    *   Use sun drying (spreading grains thinly on clean tarpaulins) or mechanical dryers. Ensure uniform drying.

3.  **Cleaning and Grading:**
    *   Remove all foreign matter (chaff, dust, stones), broken kernels, and immature grains before storage. These impurities can harbor pests and fungi.

4.  **Appropriate Storage Structures:**
    *   Store maize in clean, dry, well-ventilated, rodent-proof, and insect-proof structures (e.g., metal bins, concrete silos, improved traditional structures).
    *   Ensure the storage area is free from cracks and crevices where pests can hide.

5.  **Pest Management in Storage:**
    *   **Sanitation:** Thoroughly clean and disinfect storage structures before introducing new grain.
    *   **Fumigation:** If infestation is present or for long-term storage, fumigation can be done by trained personnel using CIBRC approved fumigants like **Aluminium phosphide** tablets (e.g., 3 tablets of 3g each per tonne of grain, for 5-7 days exposure in airtight conditions). *Strict safety precautions and professional application are mandatory for fumigants.*
    *   **Insecticides (Surface Treatment):** For empty godowns or bags, spray contact insecticides like **Malathion** @ 10 ml per litre of water (50% EC) or **Deltamethrin** @ 1 ml per litre of water (2.5% EC) on walls, floors, and bags before storage.
    *   **Regular Inspection:** Periodically inspect stored grain for signs of insect infestation, mold growth, or rodent activity. Turn the grain if possible to aerate and check for hot spots.

6.  **Moisture Control:**
    *   Prevent re-wetting of stored grain. Ensure roofs are leak-proof and there is no contact with ground moisture.

By adopting these scientific practices, you can significantly enhance your maize yield, improve grain quality, and ensure longer, safer storage, leading to better returns for your hard work.
