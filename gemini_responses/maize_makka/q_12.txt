Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm that both Scale insects and Mealybugs can affect Maize (Makka) crops, though their incidence and severity can vary. Mealybugs, in particular, can be a significant pest, often found hidden within leaf sheaths.

Effective control requires an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural practices with judicious use of chemical control when necessary.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies:**

1.  **Regular Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your maize fields, especially the undersides of leaves and within leaf sheaths, for early signs of infestation.
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Weed Management:** Remove weeds and alternate host plants from around the field, as they can harbor these pests.
    *   **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to improve air circulation, which can reduce pest build-up.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, as it can lead to lush growth that is more attractive to sucking pests.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy severely infested plant parts or stubble after harvest to reduce carry-over.
3.  **Biological Control:** Encourage natural enemies like ladybird beetles, lacewings, and parasitic wasps, which prey on mealybugs and scale insects. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

**Chemical Control (When infestation is severe):**

When pest populations are high and causing economic damage, chemical intervention may be necessary. Due to the waxy coating of mealybugs and scale insects, and their tendency to hide, systemic insecticides are often more effective. Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially targeting the hidden areas.

Please use the following CIBRC approved technical chemicals with recommended dosages:

*   **For Mealybugs and Scale Insects:**
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** 100 g per acre
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** 50-70 ml per acre
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** 80-100 g per acre
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** 400-600 ml per acre (This is an Insect Growth Regulator, effective against nymphs)
    *   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:** 200-250 ml per acre

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always use sufficient water volume (e.g., 150-200 litres per acre) to ensure proper coverage, especially when targeting pests hidden in leaf sheaths.
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully, including safety precautions, dosage, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions.

By adopting these practices, you can effectively manage scale insects and mealybugs in your Maize (Makka) crop.
