Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I advise that accurate diagnosis is paramount before applying any micronutrient. Visual symptoms can be misleading, so it is crucial to conduct soil testing and, if possible, plant tissue analysis to confirm specific deficiencies and their severity. This ensures targeted and efficient nutrient management.

Here's how to address common micronutrient deficiencies in Maize (Makka):

### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** White bands on either side of the midrib, starting from the base of younger leaves, stunted growth, and shortened internodes.
*   **Recommended Action:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** (21% Zn) at 10-25 kg/acre or **Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate** (33% Zn) at 5-10 kg/acre at the time of sowing or before first irrigation.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** For immediate correction, spray a 0.5% solution of **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** (5 g/L water) mixed with 0.25% unslaked lime (2.5 g/L water) to neutralize acidity. Alternatively, use **Zinc EDTA** at 0.1% solution (1 g/L water). Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, starting 2-3 weeks after germination.

### 2. Iron (Fe) / Ferrous Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, with veins remaining green. In severe cases, leaves may turn completely yellow or white.
*   **Recommended Action:**
    *   **Soil Application:** In soils with moderate pH, apply **Ferrous Sulphate Heptahydrate** (19% Fe) at 20-40 kg/acre. However, soil application is often less effective in high pH (calcareous) soils common in Haryana.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Spray a 0.5-1.0% solution of **Ferrous Sulphate Heptahydrate** (5-10 g/L water) mixed with 0.25% unslaked lime (2.5 g/L water). Alternatively, use **Ferrous EDTA** at 0.1% solution (1 g/L water). Apply 2-3 sprays at 7-10 day intervals, targeting young leaves.

### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Shortened internodes, poor tassel and ear development, barren ears, irregular kernel development, "blind" kernels, and white, opaque spots on leaves.
*   **Recommended Action:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Borax (Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate)** (10.5-11.3% B) at 2-4 kg/acre or **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (20% B) at 1-2 kg/acre at sowing.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Spray a 0.1-0.2% solution of **Borax (Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate)** (1-2 g/L water) or **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (1-1.5 g/L water). Apply 1-2 sprays during the vegetative growth stage, particularly before flowering.

### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Youngest leaves become distorted, stunted, or fail to unfurl properly. Growing points may die back, and leaf tips can appear "gelatinous" or sticky.
*   **Recommended Action:**
    *   **Soil Application:** For long-term correction in acidic soils, apply **Gypsum (Calcium Sulphate Dihydrate)** as per soil test recommendations (typically 200-500 kg/acre). For direct calcium supply, **Calcium Nitrate** can be applied at 10-20 kg/acre.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Spray a 0.5-1.0% solution of **Calcium Nitrate** (5-10 g/L water) or a 0.2-0.4% solution of **Calcium Chloride** (2-4 g/L water). Apply 1-2 sprays during the vegetative growth phase.

### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, starting from the leaf margins and progressing inwards, giving a characteristic "striped" appearance. In severe cases, reddish-purple discoloration may occur.
*   **Recommended Action:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Magnesium Sulphate Heptahydrate** (Epsom salt, 9.6% Mg) at 10-20 kg/acre at sowing or as a side-dressing.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Spray a 0.5-1.0% solution of **Magnesium Sulphate Heptahydrate** (5-10 g/L water). Apply 1-2 sprays, especially when symptoms appear on older leaves.

### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, often with a mottled or streaked appearance, while veins remain green. In severe cases, necrotic spots may develop.
*   **Recommended Action:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Manganese Sulphate Monohydrate** (30.5% Mn) at 10-20 kg/acre. Soil application is less effective in high pH soils.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Spray a 0.5% solution of **Manganese Sulphate Monohydrate** (5 g/L water) mixed with 0.25% unslaked lime (2.5 g/L water). Apply 2-3 sprays at 7-10 day intervals, targeting young leaves.

**General Recommendations:**

*   **Soil Testing:** Always start with a comprehensive soil test to identify specific deficiencies and determine appropriate application rates.
*   **Uniform Application:** Ensure uniform application of both soil-applied and foliar-sprayed micronutrients for best results.
*   **Timing:** Foliar sprays are most effective when applied during the active vegetative growth stage, preferably in the morning or late afternoon.
*   **Water Quality:** Use clean water for preparing spray solutions.
*   **Organic Matter:** Incorporating organic matter (farmyard manure, compost) improves soil structure and nutrient availability, helping to prevent micronutrient deficiencies.
