As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling these conditions in Maize (Makka) in Haryana:

**1. Grasshopper:**
Grasshoppers can cause significant defoliation, especially in young maize plants.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Deep ploughing after harvest can expose grasshopper eggs to predators and adverse weather conditions.
    *   Maintain field sanitation to reduce breeding sites.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   For severe infestations, especially in young crops, chemical control may be necessary.
    *   **Dusting:**
        *   **Malathion** 5% Dust @ 20-25 kg/acre
    *   **Spraying:**
        *   **Malathion** 50 EC @ 500 ml/acre
        *   **Quinalphos** 25 EC @ 600 ml/acre
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5 EC @ 200 ml/acre

**2. Painted bug:**
This is not known to affect Maize (Makka). Painted bug primarily infests cruciferous crops like mustard, radish, and cabbage.

**3. Red cotton bug:**
This is not known to affect Maize (Makka). Red cotton bug is a pest primarily of cotton and other malvaceous plants.

**4. Black ants:**
This is not known to affect Maize (Makka) as a direct pest causing significant damage to the crop itself. While ants may be present in fields, they are generally not considered a primary pest of maize requiring direct control measures for plant protection. If they are observed in association with other pests like aphids (feeding on honeydew), controlling the primary pest (aphids) will indirectly manage the ant population.
