As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified information regarding specialized practices in Maize (Makka) cultivation relevant to Haryana:

1.  **Pruning:**
    This is not known to affect Maize (Makka). Pruning is a practice typically applied to woody plants or certain horticultural crops to manage growth, shape, or fruit production. Maize is an annual monocotyledonous crop, and pruning is not a standard or recommended practice in its cultivation.

2.  **Desuckering (Removal of Tillers):**
    Maize plants can produce tillers (often referred to as suckers) from the base. Historically, there was a belief that removing these tillers would divert nutrients to the main stalk and increase grain yield. However, extensive research, including studies conducted in regions like Haryana, has consistently shown that:
    *   Desuckering generally does not lead to an increase in grain yield.
    *   Tillers contribute to the overall photosynthetic capacity of the plant and can sometimes produce small ears, especially in wider spacing or specific varieties.
    *   The act of desuckering itself can cause injury to the plant, leading to entry points for pathogens and expending labor without a significant return.
    *   In modern high-density planting systems, tillers are often naturally suppressed due to competition for light and nutrients.
    Therefore, desuckering is generally **not recommended** as a standard practice for commercial maize cultivation in Haryana.

3.  **Mulching:**
    Mulching is a highly beneficial practice for maize cultivation, especially in the agro-climatic conditions of Haryana, primarily for moisture conservation and weed management.
    *   **Benefits:**
        *   **Moisture Conservation:** Reduces evaporation from the soil surface, conserving precious soil moisture, which is crucial during dry spells or in rainfed conditions.
        *   **Weed Suppression:** Acts as a physical barrier, preventing weed seed germination and growth, thereby reducing competition for nutrients and water.
        *   **Soil Temperature Regulation:** Helps moderate soil temperature, keeping it cooler in hot weather and warmer in cooler periods, which can be beneficial for root development.
        *   **Soil Health Improvement:** Organic mulches decompose over time, adding organic matter to the soil, improving soil structure, and enhancing microbial activity.
        *   **Erosion Control:** Protects the soil surface from the impact of raindrops and wind, reducing soil erosion.
    *   **Types of Mulch:**
        *   **Organic Mulches:** Crop residues (e.g., wheat straw, rice straw, maize stover), dry leaves, sugarcane trash. These are readily available in Haryana. Apply a layer of 5-10 cm thickness.
        *   **Plastic Mulches:** Black or silver plastic films. Black plastic is effective for weed control and warming the soil, while silver plastic can help repel some pests and reflect light. These are more expensive but offer excellent weed control and moisture retention.

4.  **Grafting:**
    This is not known to affect Maize (Makka). Grafting is a horticultural technique used to join parts of two plants so they grow as one. It is primarily applicable to dicotyledonous plants that possess a vascular cambium layer, which is essential for the successful union of the scion and rootstock. Maize is a monocotyledonous plant and lacks this cambium layer, making grafting technically impossible and not applicable to its cultivation.

5.  **Pollination:**
    Maize is a monoecious plant, meaning it has separate male flowers (tassel at the top of the plant) and female flowers (ears with silks) on the same plant.
    *   **Natural Pollination:** Maize is primarily **wind-pollinated (anemophilous)**. Pollen grains from the tassels are carried by the wind to the silks of the same plant (self-pollination) or to silks of neighboring plants (cross-pollination). Each silk strand is connected to a potential kernel, and successful pollination of each silk is required for a fully developed ear.
    *   **Specialized Practices in Commercial Cultivation:** For general grain production, no manual or specialized pollination practices are required from the farmer's side, as wind naturally facilitates the process.
    *   **Specialized Practices in Seed Production/Breeding:** In hybrid seed production, a specialized practice called **detasseling** is performed. This involves manually removing the tassels from the female parent rows to prevent self-pollination and ensure that all kernels produced are a result of cross-pollination from the male parent rows. This is a critical step to maintain genetic purity and produce hybrid seeds. For research and breeding purposes, hand-pollination might be done to achieve specific crosses. However, these are not practices for general maize cultivation.
