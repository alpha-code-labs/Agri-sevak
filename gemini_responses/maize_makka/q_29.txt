This is not known to affect Maize (Makka).

The terms "Flower drop," "Fruit drop," "Tinda dropping," and "Boll dropping" are not applicable to Maize (Makka) physiology. Maize produces ears (cobs) with kernels, not fruits or bolls that drop in the manner described for other crops like cotton (boll drop) or cucurbits (tinda drop). While poor kernel set or barrenness can occur due to various factors (e.g., poor pollination, nutrient deficiency, stress), the phenomenon of "dropping" as described does not occur in maize.
