As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I must inform you that the conditions you have mentioned are not typically associated with Maize (Makka) cultivation.

*   **Dieback:** This is not known to affect Maize (Makka). Dieback is a term generally used for woody plants (trees and shrubs) where branches or twigs die from the tip backward. Maize is an annual herbaceous plant and does not exhibit dieback in this manner.
*   **Twig blight:** This is not known to affect Maize (Makka). Similar to dieback, twig blight is a disease affecting woody plants, causing the death of twigs. Maize does not have twigs.
*   **Tikka disease:** This is not known to affect Maize (Makka). Tikka disease is a well-known and significant leaf spot disease primarily affecting Groundnut (Moongfali), caused by *Cercospora arachidicola* and *Phaeoisariopsis personata*. It does not affect Maize.

Maize is susceptible to various other diseases such as stalk rots, leaf blights (e.g., Northern Corn Leaf Blight, Southern Corn Leaf Blight), downy mildew, and rusts. If you are observing symptoms that you believe might be related to these conditions, please provide more specific details or images of the affected plants for accurate diagnosis and recommendations.
