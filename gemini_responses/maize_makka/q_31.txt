Regarding your query about physical damage in Maize (Makka):

1.  **Fruit bursting:** This is not known to affect Maize (Makka). Kernel cracking can occur due to mechanical damage during harvesting or improper drying, but "fruit bursting" as a physiological disorder like in fleshy fruits is not observed in maize.

2.  **Hardness in fruit:** This is not known to affect Maize (Makka) as a damage or disorder. Kernel hardness is a natural characteristic influenced by genetics and moisture content during maturation. Undesirable hardness might be linked to poor grain filling due to environmental stress, but it is not a "physical damage" in itself.

3.  **Leaf burning/melting:** This is a common symptom in Maize (Makka) and can be caused by various physical and environmental factors. Control measures depend on the specific cause:

    *   **Water Stress (Drought or Waterlogging):**
        *   **Drought:** Ensure timely and adequate irrigation, especially during critical growth stages like tasseling, silking, and grain filling. Maintain optimal soil moisture.
        *   **Waterlogging:** Ensure proper field drainage to prevent water accumulation around roots, which can lead to root damage and subsequent leaf symptoms.
    *   **Nutrient Deficiencies/Toxicities:**
        *   **Soil Testing:** Conduct regular soil tests to identify specific nutrient deficiencies (e.g., Potassium, Magnesium) or toxicities (e.g., Boron, Salinity).
        *   **Balanced Fertilization:** Apply fertilizers based on soil test recommendations.
        *   **Potassium Deficiency:** If potassium deficiency is identified as the cause of leaf margin scorching, apply **Muriate of Potash (Potassium Chloride)** at 40-60 kg/acre as a basal dose or top dressing, or a foliar spray of 1-2% solution (10-20 g/L) of **Potassium Sulphate**.
        *   **Magnesium Deficiency:** If magnesium deficiency is identified, apply **Magnesium Sulphate** at 10-20 kg/acre to the soil or as a foliar spray of 1-2% solution (10-20 g/L).
        *   **Salinity/Boron Toxicity:** Improve soil drainage, leach salts with good quality water, and avoid excessive boron application without soil test recommendations.
    *   **Heat Stress:**
        *   Maintain optimal soil moisture through irrigation to help plants cope with high temperatures.
        *   Consider planting heat-tolerant maize varieties suitable for Haryana conditions.
        *   Mulching can help moderate soil temperature and conserve moisture.
    *   **Chemical Phytotoxicity (Burn):**
        *   Always follow the manufacturer's instructions for dosage, timing, and application method for all herbicides, insecticides, and foliar fertilizers.
        *   Avoid spraying chemicals during periods of high temperature, strong sunlight, or when plants are under severe water stress, as this increases the risk of phytotoxicity.
        *   Use appropriate spray nozzles and ensure uniform coverage.
    *   **Variety Selection:**
        *   Choose maize varieties that are well-adapted to the local climate and soil conditions of Haryana and have known tolerance to common environmental stresses.
