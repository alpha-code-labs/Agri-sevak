As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified methods to protect Mulberry plantations from wild animals in Haryana, keeping in mind the primary use of mulberry leaves for sericulture and the safety of silkworms.

### Methods to Protect Mulberry from Wild Animals

1.  **Physical Barriers (Most Effective):**
    *   **Fencing**:
        *   **Barbed Wire Fencing**: Construct a robust fence of at least 1.5 to 2 meters height with 5-7 strands of barbed wire. This is effective against larger animals like Nilgai (Blue Bull), Wild Boar, and stray cattle. Ensure the fence is properly tensioned and regularly maintained to prevent breaches.
        *   **Chain-link Fencing**: While a higher initial investment, a chain-link fence provides a highly durable and effective barrier against a wider range of animals, including monkeys and smaller mammals.
        *   **Electric Fencing (Low Voltage)**: A well-installed, low-voltage, non-lethal electric fence can be highly effective. It delivers a mild, deterrent shock without causing harm to animals. **Crucially, it requires careful installation, regular maintenance, and clear warning signs for human safety.** Consult with local agricultural engineers or experts for proper setup and adherence to safety standards.
        *   **Trenching**: In areas severely affected by Wild Boar, digging a deep trench (e.g., 1 meter deep and 0.5-0.75 meters wide) around the field can prevent them from entering by making it difficult to cross.
    *   **Live Fencing/Hedge Fencing**: Planting dense, thorny bushes like *Prosopis juliflora* (Kikar), *Acacia nilotica* (Babul), or *Carissa carandas* (Karonda) as a hedge around the mulberry plot can act as a long-term deterrent. This requires time to establish but can be very effective.

2.  **Cultural and Management Practices:**
    *   **Human Guarding**: Employing watchmen, especially during critical periods (e.g., young plant establishment, leaf harvesting), is a highly effective deterrent. Consistent human presence often scares away most wild animals.
    *   **Habitat Modification**: Keep the area immediately surrounding the mulberry plot clear of weeds, bushes, and debris. This reduces potential hiding spots and cover for wild animals, making the field less attractive to them.
    *   **Community-Based Approach**: Coordinate with neighboring farmers to implement protection measures collectively. A unified and synchronized effort across multiple farms is often more successful than individual attempts.
    *   **Noise and Light Devices**:
        *   **Sound Devices**: Using crackers, drums, or even LPG-operated sound cannons can temporarily scare away animals. However, animals can habituate to these over time, so vary the timing and type of disturbance.
        *   **Light Devices**: Installing solar-powered lights or strobe lights around the field can deter nocturnal animals.

3.  **Repellents (Use with Extreme Caution for Sericulture):**
    *   **Non-Chemical Repellents**:
        *   **Chilli-Garlic Spray**: A mixture of crushed chillies and garlic, diluted in water, can be sprayed on non-leaf parts (stems, surrounding vegetation) as a deterrent. **It is critical to avoid spraying directly on leaves intended for silkworms, as residues can be harmful to silkworms and affect silk quality.**
        *   **Cow Dung/Urine Slurry**: Applying a slurry of cow dung and urine around the field perimeter can sometimes deter animals due to its strong smell.
    *   **Chemical Repellents**: Given that mulberry leaves are used for sericulture, the use of chemical repellents directly on the plants is generally **not recommended** due to potential harm to silkworms and the lack of specific CIBRC approvals for this purpose that guarantee silkworm safety. There are currently no widely recommended CIBRC-approved chemical repellents for large wild animals that are safe for direct application on mulberry leaves for sericulture.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Local Wildlife Identification**: Identify the specific wild animals causing damage in your area to tailor the most effective protection strategy.
*   **Sericulture Safety**: Always prioritize the safety of silkworms. Any method involving direct application to leaves must be thoroughly vetted for its impact on silkworm health and silk production.
*   **Legal Aspects**: In case of severe and persistent damage by protected wild animals, report the issue to the local Forest Department for assistance and guidance.
