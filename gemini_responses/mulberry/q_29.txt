As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding dropping in Mulberry:

Firstly, it is important to clarify:
*   **Tinda:** This is a type of gourd (*Praecitrullus fistulosus*) and is not related to Mulberry. This is not known to affect Mulberry.
*   **Boll dropping:** This term is primarily associated with cotton. Mulberry produces a syncarp (a multiple fruit formed from the fusion of many small fruits), not a boll. Therefore, "boll dropping" is not applicable to Mulberry.

Flower and fruit drop in Mulberry is a physiological phenomenon that can be influenced by various factors. Addressing these factors is key to control.

**Causes of Flower and Fruit Drop in Mulberry:**

1.  **Physiological Stress:**
    *   **Water Stress:** Both excessive water (waterlogging) and insufficient water (drought) can lead to shedding.
    *   **Nutrient Deficiencies:** Lack of essential nutrients, particularly Boron, Calcium, and Phosphorus, can weaken fruit attachment.
    *   **Temperature Extremes:** Very high or very low temperatures during flowering and fruit development can cause stress.
    *   **Hormonal Imbalance:** An imbalance of plant hormones (e.g., high abscisic acid relative to auxins) can trigger abscission.
    *   **Excessive Fruit Load:** The plant may naturally shed some flowers/fruits to ensure the healthy development of the remaining ones.
2.  **Poor Pollination:** Inadequate pollination can lead to unfertilized flowers or poorly developed fruits that are subsequently shed.
3.  **Pest and Disease Damage:** While the question focuses on dropping, severe infestations of pests or diseases can indirectly lead to flower/fruit drop due to overall plant stress.

**Control Measures for Flower and Fruit Drop in Mulberry:**

Effective control involves a combination of good agronomic practices and, if necessary, judicious use of plant growth regulators.

**A. Agronomic and Cultural Practices:**

*   **Balanced Nutrition:**
    *   Conduct regular soil testing to determine nutrient status.
    *   Apply fertilizers based on soil test recommendations. Ensure adequate supply of macro and micronutrients.
    *   Pay special attention to Boron and Calcium, which are crucial for fruit set and development. Foliar application of Boron (e.g., Borax 0.1-0.2%) can be beneficial if deficiency is suspected.
*   **Optimal Water Management:**
    *   Provide consistent and adequate irrigation, especially during flowering and fruit development stages.
    *   Avoid both waterlogging and severe drought stress. Mulching around the base of the plants can help conserve soil moisture and regulate soil temperature.
*   **Pruning:**
    *   Adopt appropriate pruning techniques to manage canopy size and fruit load. Over-cropping can lead to increased drop.
*   **Weed Control:**
    *   Keep the area around Mulberry plants free of weeds to reduce competition for water and nutrients.
*   **Pest and Disease Management:**
    *   Regularly monitor for pests and diseases and implement integrated pest management (IPM) strategies to keep plants healthy.

**B. Chemical Interventions (Plant Growth Regulators - PGRs):**

Plant growth regulators can be used to reduce flower and fruit drop by influencing hormonal balance.

*   **To prevent flower and fruit drop:**
    *   Apply **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA)**:
        *   **Dosage:** 10-20 mg per litre of water (10-20 ppm).
        *   **Application:** Spray at the full bloom stage and again 15-20 days later, if needed. Ensure thorough coverage of flowers and young fruits.
        *   **Note:** NAA helps in preventing the formation of the abscission layer, thereby reducing shedding.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read the label instructions of any chemical product before use.
*   The effectiveness of PGRs can vary depending on the Mulberry variety, environmental conditions, and the underlying cause of dropping.
*   It is advisable to consult with local agricultural extension specialists or HAU experts for precise recommendations tailored to your specific field conditions.
