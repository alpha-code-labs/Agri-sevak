As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I emphasize that weed management in mulberry (Morus spp.) requires a careful and integrated approach. The primary concern in mulberry cultivation, especially for sericulture, is the safety of the mulberry plants and, most importantly, the health of silkworms that feed on the leaves. Chemical weed control in mulberry is generally discouraged due to the high risk of herbicide residues affecting silkworms. Therefore, cultural and mechanical methods are highly recommended.

Here's a comprehensive approach to control the specified weeds in mulberry:

**I. General Principles for Weed Management in Mulberry:**

*   **Integrated Weed Management (IWM):** Combine cultural, mechanical, and biological methods. Chemical control should be considered a last resort and applied with extreme caution.
*   **Silkworm Safety:** Avoid any herbicide application that could lead to residues on mulberry leaves, as this can be highly detrimental to silkworm health and cocoon production.
*   **Timing:** Early weed removal is crucial to prevent competition with mulberry and reduce weed seed dispersal.

**II. Specific Weed Control Strategies:**

**A. Broadleaf Weeds (General, Bathu, Congress Grass) & Narrowleaf Weeds (General, Phalaris minor):**

1.  **Cultural and Mechanical Methods (Highly Recommended):**
    *   **Hand Weeding:** This is the safest and most effective method. Conduct regularly, especially during the initial growth stages of mulberry and after pruning.
    *   **Intercultivation/Hoeing:** Shallow cultivation between rows using hoes or cultivators helps to uproot young weeds and disturb their growth. Avoid deep cultivation to prevent root damage to mulberry.
    *   **Mulching:** Applying organic mulch (e.g., paddy straw, dry leaves, farmyard manure) around mulberry plants can effectively suppress weed growth, conserve soil moisture, and improve soil health.

2.  **Chemical Methods (Use with Extreme Caution and as a Last Resort):**
    *   Herbicides are generally not recommended for post-emergence application in established mulberry due to the risk of phytotoxicity and silkworm toxicity. If absolutely necessary, consider the following with strict adherence to safety protocols:
        *   **Directed Spray of Non-Selective Herbicides (for inter-row spaces only):**
            *   **Glyphosate** (41% SL): Apply at 2.5-3.75 litres per acre (equivalent to 1.0-1.5 kg a.i./acre) mixed in 200-300 litres of water. This should be applied as a *directed spray* only between mulberry rows, ensuring no spray drift or contact with mulberry leaves, stems, or roots. This is best done when mulberry plants are dormant or immediately after pruning, and well before new leaf emergence.
            *   **Paraquat dichloride** (24% SL): Apply at 2.0 litres per acre (equivalent to 0.5 kg a.i./acre) mixed in 200-300 litres of water. Similar to **Glyphosate**, use as a *directed spray* with extreme care to avoid contact with mulberry plants.
            *   **Precaution:** After using these non-selective herbicides, a minimum waiting period of 45-60 days is recommended before harvesting leaves for silkworm rearing to ensure no harmful residues remain. This makes them impractical for continuous leaf harvesting.
        *   **Pre-Emergence Herbicides (for newly planted gardens or after pruning):**
            *   **Pendimethalin** (30% EC): Apply at 3.3 litres per acre (equivalent to 1.0 kg a.i./acre) mixed in 200-300 litres of water, immediately after planting mulberry saplings or after pruning and before weed emergence. Ensure good soil moisture for effectiveness.
            *   **Oxyfluorfen** (23.5% EC): Apply at 0.85 litres per acre (equivalent to 0.2 kg a.i./acre) mixed in 200-300 litres of water, as a pre-emergent application.
            *   **Precaution:** Even with pre-emergent herbicides, ensure proper incorporation or watering to prevent volatilization and potential harm to young mulberry plants. A waiting period before leaf harvest is still advisable.

**B. Amarbail (Cuscuta spp.):**

*   **Manual Removal (Highly Recommended):** This is the most effective and safest method.
    *   As soon as Amarbail is noticed, manually remove the affected mulberry branches or entire plants if heavily infested.
    *   Collect all removed Amarbail plant material and burn it away from the field to prevent further spread of seeds.
    *   Regular monitoring is essential to catch infestations early.
*   **Chemical Control:** Post-emergence chemical control of Amarbail in mulberry is extremely challenging without harming the host plant. Herbicides like **Glyphosate** can kill Amarbail but will also kill the mulberry if it comes into contact. Therefore, chemical control is generally not recommended for established Amarbail infestations in mulberry.

**C. Orobanche (Broomrape):**

*   This is not known to affect Mulberry. Orobanche species are typically parasitic on solanaceous crops (e.g., tomato, potato, tobacco) and some legumes, but not on mulberry.

**Important Note:** Always consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for the most current and specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and the latest CIBRC guidelines for sericulture-safe practices. Strict adherence to label instructions for any chemical product is mandatory.
