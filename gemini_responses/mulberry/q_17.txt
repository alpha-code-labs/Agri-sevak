As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following doses of organic manures for Mulberry cultivation in Haryana to ensure optimal growth and leaf yield:

*   **Farm Yard Manure (FYM)**:
    *   **Dose**: 10-15 tonnes per acre per year.
    *   **Application**: Apply in two split doses, preferably during June-July (pre-monsoon) and October-November (post-monsoon/winter). Incorporate the FYM into the soil around the root zone of the mulberry plants.

*   **Vermicompost**:
    *   **Dose**: 3-5 tonnes per acre per year.
    *   **Application**: Vermicompost can be applied as a partial replacement for FYM or as a supplement to enhance soil fertility and microbial activity. Apply in two split doses, similar to FYM, incorporating it into the soil around the plants.

*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract)**:
    *   **Dose (Foliar Spray)**: 2-3 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Application**: Spray uniformly on the foliage, ensuring good coverage. Apply 2-3 times during the active growth period of the mulberry plants, typically at 30-45 day intervals, starting after pruning or during periods of rapid leaf development.
    *   **Dose (Soil Drench/Drip Application)**: 1-2 litres per acre, diluted in sufficient water.
    *   **Application**: Apply around the root zone or through drip irrigation during active growth phases to promote root development and nutrient uptake.
