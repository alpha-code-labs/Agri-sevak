As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the importance of maintaining healthy Mulberry plantations, especially considering their critical role in sericulture. Any pest management strategy must prioritize the safety of silkworms and the quality of leaves.

Here's the scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Mulberry:

### General Considerations for Mulberry Pest Management:
*   **Sericulture Safety:** Always prioritize non-chemical methods. If chemical intervention is necessary, choose products with low toxicity to silkworms and ensure a sufficiently long waiting period (pre-harvest interval) before feeding leaves to silkworms. Consult specific guidelines for sericulture-safe pesticides if available.
*   **Integrated Pest Management (IPM):** Combine cultural, biological, and chemical methods for sustainable control.

### Pest-Specific Control Measures:

#### 1. Grasshopper
Grasshoppers can cause significant defoliation by feeding on Mulberry leaves.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   **Hand-picking:** For small infestations, manually collect and destroy grasshoppers, especially nymphs.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Keep the area around Mulberry plots free of weeds and tall grasses, which serve as breeding grounds and shelter for grasshoppers.
    *   **Tillage:** Ploughing the soil during off-season can expose and destroy grasshopper eggs.
*   **Biological Control:**
    *   Encourage natural predators like birds, predatory beetles, and parasitic wasps.
*   **Botanical/Chemical Control (Use with extreme caution for sericulture):**
    *   **Azadirachtin** (Neem-based formulations): Apply 2.5 - 5 ml/L of water (e.g., 1500 ppm formulation). This is generally safer for sericulture, but allow a waiting period of 3-5 days after spraying before feeding leaves to silkworms.
    *   **Malathion** 50% EC: In cases of severe infestation and only during non-rearing periods, or if the leaves are not intended for silkworm feeding for an extended period, apply at 1.5 - 2 ml/L of water. **A strict waiting period of at least 15-20 days is essential after application before feeding leaves to silkworms, and even then, caution is advised.**

#### 2. Painted bug (Bagrada hilaris)
This is not known to affect Mulberry.

#### 3. Red cotton bug (Dysdercus cingulatus)
This is not known to affect Mulberry.

#### 4. Black ants
Black ants are generally not direct pests of Mulberry leaves but can be a nuisance. They are often associated with honeydew-producing pests like aphids, mealybugs, and scale insects, which *do* damage Mulberry. Ants protect these pests from natural enemies.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   **Identify Primary Pest:** If ants are present due to honeydew, the primary focus should be on controlling the aphids, mealybugs, or scale insects that are producing the honeydew.
    *   **Sanitation:** Remove weeds and debris around the base of Mulberry plants where ants might nest or forage.
    *   **Pruning:** Prune lower branches to prevent ants from easily accessing the canopy from the ground.
*   **Physical Barriers:**
    *   Apply sticky bands or grease around the trunk of the Mulberry trees to prevent ants from climbing up.
*   **Chemical Control (Targeted application, avoiding foliage):**
    *   **Ant Baits:** Use granular ant baits containing active ingredients like **Fipronil** 0.01% or **Hydramethylnon** 1%. Apply these baits around the base of the plants or along ant trails, away from direct contact with Mulberry leaves.
    *   **Soil Drench (for nests at base):** If ant nests are a significant problem at the base of the plants, a soil drench can be applied. Use **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 2.5 - 4 ml/L of water, or **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL at 0.5 - 1 ml/L of water. Apply this solution directly to the ant nests or around the base of the trunk, ensuring no spray drift onto the leaves. **Ensure a long waiting period if there is any chance of foliar contamination, as these chemicals are harmful to silkworms.**
