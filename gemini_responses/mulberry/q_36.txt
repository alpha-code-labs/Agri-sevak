### I. Improving Yield for Mulberry

To maximize mulberry yield, focus on integrated management practices:

1.  **Variety Selection:**
    *   Choose high-yielding, fruit-bearing varieties suitable for Haryana's agro-climatic conditions. Consult with HAU's horticulture department for the latest recommended varieties (e.g., S-1635, S-30, K-2, or local improved selections known for fruit production).
2.  **Soil Management and Nutrition:**
    *   **Soil Testing:** Conduct regular soil tests to determine nutrient status and pH. Mulberry thrives in well-drained loamy soils with a pH of 6.0-7.0.
    *   **Organic Matter:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost (10-15 kg per plant annually) to improve soil structure and fertility.
    *   **Fertilization:** Based on soil test results, apply NPK fertilizers. A general recommendation for established fruit-bearing mulberry plants (per acre per year) is:
        *   Nitrogen (N): 100-150 kg (e.g., through Urea)
        *   Phosphorus (P2O5): 50-60 kg (e.g., through Diammonium Phosphate - DAP or Single Super Phosphate - SSP)
        *   Potassium (K2O): 50-60 kg (e.g., through Muriate of Potash - MOP)
        *   Apply N in 2-3 split doses (after pruning, during fruit development). P and K can be applied as basal doses.
    *   **Micronutrients:** Address deficiencies through foliar sprays if identified by soil/leaf analysis:
        *   Boron deficiency: Spray **Borax** at 1.5-2 g/L of water.
        *   Zinc deficiency: Spray **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** at 2-3 g/L of water.
        *   Iron deficiency: Spray **Ferrous sulphate** at 2-3 g/L of water.
3.  **Water Management:**
    *   Mulberry requires consistent moisture, especially during flowering and fruit development.
    *   Irrigate regularly, particularly during dry spells. Drip irrigation is highly efficient, saving water and ensuring uniform moisture.
    *   Avoid waterlogging, which can lead to root rot.
4.  **Pruning:**
    *   Annual pruning is essential to encourage new growth and fruit wood. Prune after the main fruiting season to remove dead, diseased, or weak branches and to shape the canopy for better light penetration and air circulation.
5.  **Pest and Disease Management:**
    *   Regular monitoring is crucial.
    *   **Common Pests:** Mealybugs, Scale insects, Leaf rollers.
        *   For sucking pests (Mealybugs, Scale insects): Use **Imidacloprid** (0.3-0.5 ml/L) or **Thiamethoxam** (0.2-0.3 g/L).
        *   For chewing pests/leaf rollers: Use **Chlorantraniliprole** (0.3 ml/L) or **Emamectin benzoate** (0.2 g/L).
    *   **Common Diseases:** Powdery mildew, Leaf spot.
        *   For Powdery mildew: Spray **Sulphur** (wettable powder) at 2-3 g/L or **Myclobutanil** at 0.5 g/L.
        *   For Leaf spot: Spray **Mancozeb** at 2-2.5 g/L or **Carbendazim** at 1 g/L.
    *   Always follow label instructions for dosage and safety precautions.
6.  **Weed Management:**
    *   Control weeds around the base of the plants through manual weeding, mulching, or appropriate herbicides (if approved for mulberry and used carefully to avoid drift). Mulching also helps conserve soil moisture.

### II. Improving Fruit Quality for Mulberry

High-quality fruit is characterized by good size, uniform color, sweetness, and firmness.

1.  **Balanced Nutrition:**
    *   **Potassium (K):** Adequate potassium is vital for fruit size, sugar content, and color development. Ensure sufficient K application as per soil test recommendations.
    *   **Boron:** Essential for fruit set and development, preventing malformed fruits. Foliar application of **Borax** (1.5-2 g/L) can be beneficial during flowering and early fruit development.
    *   **Calcium:** Contributes to fruit firmness and reduces physiological disorders.
2.  **Consistent Water Supply:**
    *   Avoid water stress, especially during fruit development, as it can lead to smaller, less juicy fruits and premature fruit drop. Consistent moisture ensures optimal cell expansion and sugar accumulation.
3.  **Pest and Disease Control:**
    *   Prevent damage from pests and diseases, as any injury to the fruit surface can reduce its marketability and quality.
4.  **Timely Harvesting:**
    *   Harvest fruits at their optimal maturity stage (fully colored, slightly soft to touch, and easily detached from the stem). Harvesting too early results in sour, underdeveloped fruits, while over-ripe fruits are too soft and have a shorter shelf life.

### III. Improving Storage Life for Mulberry

Mulberries are highly perishable. Extending their storage life requires careful post-harvest handling:

1.  **Gentle Harvesting:**
    *   Harvest fruits early in the morning or late in the evening when temperatures are cooler.
    *   Handle fruits very gently to avoid bruising, crushing, or skin damage, which are primary causes of spoilage.
    *   Harvest with the pedicel (stem) intact if possible, as this reduces injury at the point of detachment.
2.  **Pre-cooling:**
    *   Rapidly remove field heat immediately after harvest. This is the most critical step to extend shelf life.
    *   Methods include forced-air cooling or hydro-cooling (if feasible), or simply placing fruits in a cool, shaded area.
3.  **Sorting and Grading:**
    *   Immediately after harvest, sort out damaged, diseased, or over-ripe fruits to prevent them from contaminating healthy ones. Grade fruits by size and maturity.
4.  **Appropriate Packaging:**
    *   Pack fruits in shallow, well-ventilated punnets or trays (e.g., plastic clamshells or cardboard trays with perforations) to prevent crushing and allow air circulation.
    *   Avoid overfilling containers.
5.  **Temperature and Humidity Control:**
    *   Store mulberries at the lowest possible safe temperature, ideally 0-2°C.
    *   Maintain a high relative humidity of 90-95% to prevent moisture loss and shriveling.
6.  **Post-harvest Treatments (Limited for fresh consumption mulberries):**
    *   Due to their delicate nature and direct consumption, chemical post-harvest treatments are generally not recommended for mulberries. Focus on good sanitation, rapid cooling, and proper storage conditions.

By implementing these scientifically sound practices, mulberry growers in Haryana can significantly improve their yields, fruit quality, and the marketability of their produce. For specific local recommendations or further assistance, please contact the Department of Horticulture at HAU, Hisar.
