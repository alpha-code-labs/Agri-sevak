Namaste! The "drying up" of branches, leaves, fruits, and flowers in Mulberry (Morus spp.) is a serious symptom indicating significant stress, which can be due to a variety of biotic (diseases, pests) or abiotic (environmental, nutritional) factors. As a Senior Agronomist, my primary advice is to conduct a thorough on-site examination to accurately diagnose the root cause.

Here's a systematic approach to address this issue in Mulberry cultivation in Haryana:

### 1. Initial Assessment and Diagnosis

Before any intervention, it is crucial to identify the specific cause. Observe the following:

*   **Pattern of Drying:** Is it affecting individual branches, entire plants, or scattered plants? Is it sudden or gradual?
*   **Location of Drying:** Does it start from the tips, base, or specific parts of the plant?
*   **Root Examination:** Carefully dig around the base of an affected plant to inspect the roots for any discoloration, rot, galls, or damage.
*   **Stem and Branch Examination:** Look for cracks, cankers, holes, frass (sawdust-like material), discoloration under the bark, or girdling.
*   **Leaf Symptoms:** Besides drying, are there any spots, yellowing, or unusual patterns?
*   **Soil Conditions:** Check for waterlogging, extreme dryness, compaction, or unusual soil color/smell.

### 2. Abiotic Factors (Environmental & Nutritional Stresses)

These are often the most common causes of general decline and drying.

*   **Water Stress:**
    *   **Under-watering (Drought):** Prolonged lack of water, especially during hot periods, will lead to wilting and drying of leaves, branches, and eventually the entire plant.
        *   **Management:** Ensure consistent and adequate irrigation, especially during dry spells and critical growth stages. Mulching around the base of the plants helps conserve soil moisture.
    *   **Over-watering / Poor Drainage:** Waterlogging deprives roots of oxygen, leading to root suffocation and subsequent root rot, which manifests as wilting and drying of above-ground parts.
        *   **Management:** Improve soil drainage by incorporating organic matter, creating raised beds, or improving field drainage channels. Adjust irrigation frequency and volume.

*   **Nutrient Deficiencies/Imbalances:** Severe deficiencies, particularly of potassium, calcium, or boron, can lead to poor plant vigor and susceptibility to stress, manifesting as drying or dieback.
    *   **Management:** Conduct a soil test to determine nutrient status. Based on the report, apply balanced fertilizers. For general health, apply well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost (5-10 kg/plant annually).

*   **Soil Salinity/Alkalinity:** High salt content or very high pH in the soil (common in some parts of Haryana) can impair water and nutrient uptake, leading to stunted growth and drying symptoms.
    *   **Management:** Improve drainage, leach salts with good quality water, and apply gypsum (for sodic soils) as per soil test recommendations. Incorporate organic matter.

*   **Temperature Extremes:** Severe heat stress or sudden cold snaps/frost can cause scorching and drying of foliage and young shoots.
    *   **Management:** Provide adequate irrigation during hot periods. For young plants, temporary shading can be beneficial during extreme heat.

### 3. Biotic Factors (Diseases and Pests)

If abiotic factors are ruled out, consider the following:

*   **Root Rot (Fungal):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Yellowing, wilting, and drying of leaves and branches, often starting from one side of the plant. Roots appear dark, mushy, and decayed.
    *   **Management:** Improve drainage. Remove severely affected plants. For early stages, drench the soil around the root zone with fungicides.
    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   **Carbendazim** (50% WP): 1-2 g/L of water, drench 2-5 L solution per plant depending on size.
        *   **Propiconazole** (25% EC): 1 ml/L of water, drench 2-5 L solution per plant.
        *   **Thiophanate Methyl** (70% WP): 1-1.5 g/L of water, drench 2-5 L solution per plant.

*   **Stem Borers (Insect Pests):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Wilting and drying of individual branches or the entire top portion of the plant. Presence of boreholes on the stem/branches, often with frass (sawdust-like material) extruding from them. The branch above the damage point dries up.
    *   **Management:** Prune and destroy affected branches well below the bore hole. Use a wire to physically extract the larva from the bore hole.
    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   **Chlorpyrifos** (20% EC): Inject 2-5 ml of undiluted solution into the boreholes using a syringe and plug the hole with mud or wax.
        *   **Imidacloprid** (17.8% SL): As a prophylactic measure or for early infestation, drench the soil around the base of the plant at 0.5-1 ml/L of water (2-5 L solution per plant).

*   **Stem Canker / Dieback (Fungal):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Sunken, discolored lesions on stems and branches, often leading to cracking of bark and girdling. The portion of the branch above the canker dries up.
    *   **Management:** Prune affected branches well below the canker into healthy wood. Apply a fungicidal paste to pruning wounds. Ensure proper sanitation.
    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   **Copper Oxychloride** (50% WP): Prepare a paste (50 g/L of water) and apply to pruning wounds. For general spray, 2-3 g/L of water.
        *   **Carbendazim** (50% WP): As a paste (20-30 g/L of water) on wounds or spray at 1 g/L of water.

*   **Nematodes (Root-knot Nematodes):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, yellowing, general decline, and reduced vigor leading to drying symptoms, especially under stress. Examination of roots reveals galls or swellings.
    *   **Management:** Incorporate organic matter (FYM, neem cake) into the soil. Practice crop rotation with non-host plants. Solarization of nursery beds.
    *   *This is not known to affect Mulberry to the extent of causing widespread drying up of branches, leaves, fruits, and flowers as a primary symptom, but can contribute to overall plant decline.*

### 4. General Horticultural Practices (Preventive Measures)

*   **Proper Pruning:** Use sharp, sterilized tools. Make clean cuts and apply a fungicidal paste (e.g., **Copper Oxychloride** paste) to large wounds to prevent pathogen entry.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure regular application of macro and micronutrients based on soil test results.
*   **Mulching:** Apply organic mulch around the base of plants to conserve moisture, regulate soil temperature, and suppress weeds.
*   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy all fallen leaves, dried branches, and diseased plant parts to reduce inoculum sources.
*   **Regular Monitoring:** Regularly inspect plants for any early signs of stress, pests, or diseases.

**Important Note:** Always read the label of any chemical product carefully before use and follow the manufacturer's instructions regarding dosage, application method, and safety precautions. For severe or persistent problems, it is advisable to consult with local agricultural extension specialists or HAU experts for a precise diagnosis and tailored recommendations.
