As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach for controlling sucking pests in Mulberry, prioritizing sustainable and effective methods.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Sucking Pests in Mulberry:**

1.  **Regular Monitoring:**
    *   Periodically inspect young shoots, tender leaves, and the undersides of older leaves for the presence of aphids, leafhoppers, whiteflies, thrips, and psylla. Early detection is crucial for effective management.

2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy severely infested shoots and leaves to reduce pest populations.
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the area around mulberry plantations free of weeds, as they can serve as alternate hosts for these pests.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush, tender growth that is more attractive to sucking pests. Maintain balanced nutrition to promote plant vigour.
    *   **Proper Irrigation:** Ensure adequate water supply to reduce plant stress, making plants less susceptible to pest attacks.

3.  **Biological Control:**
    *   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Encourage beneficial insects such as ladybird beetles, lacewings, hoverflies, and parasitic wasps, which are natural predators and parasitoids of aphids, whiteflies, and leafhoppers. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficials.
    *   **Bio-pesticides:** Consider using entomopathogenic fungi like *Beauveria bassiana* or *Verticillium lecanii* (if CIBRC approved for these pests in Mulberry) during early stages of infestation, especially under high humidity conditions.

4.  **Chemical Control (as a last resort, or for severe infestations):**
    *   When pest populations are high and other methods are insufficient, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
    *   Ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where many sucking pests reside.
    *   Apply insecticides during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.

**CIBRC Approved Insecticides for Sucking Pests in Mulberry:**

The following CIBRC approved technical chemicals can be used:

*   **For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, Thrips, and Psylla:**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at a rate of 0.5 - 1.0 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at a rate of 0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water.
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply at a rate of 0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water.
    *   **Flonicamid 50% WG:** Apply at a rate of 0.3 g per litre of water. (Specifically effective against aphids and whiteflies).
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at a rate of 1.0 - 1.25 ml per litre of water. (Effective against whitefly nymphs and hoppers).
    *   **Azadirachtin 1500 ppm (Neem-based formulation):** Apply at a rate of 2.0 - 3.0 ml per litre of water. (Botanical insecticide with anti-feedant, repellent, and insect growth regulator properties, generally safer).

**Important Considerations for Sericulture:**

If the mulberry leaves are intended for silkworm rearing, extreme caution must be exercised with chemical applications. Most synthetic insecticides are highly toxic to silkworms. In such cases:
*   Prioritize **Azadirachtin** formulations due to their lower toxicity to silkworms.
*   If synthetic insecticides are absolutely necessary, apply them immediately after leaf harvest, ensuring a sufficient waiting period (e.g., 15-20 days or more, depending on the chemical and its persistence) before the next leaf harvest for silkworms.
*   Always consult with sericulture experts for specific guidelines on safe chemical use and recommended waiting periods to avoid harm to silkworms.
