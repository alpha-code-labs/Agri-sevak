Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing pests in Mulberry. It is crucial to adopt an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, mechanical, biological, and judicious chemical methods, especially considering that Mulberry leaves are fed to silkworms.

Here's how to control the mentioned pests:

### General IPM Principles for Mulberry:
*   **Regular Monitoring:** Inspect your Mulberry plants frequently to detect pests early.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Keep the plantation clean by removing weeds and plant debris.
*   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy infested plant parts promptly.

### 1. Control of Borers in Mulberry

Borers, such as stem borers and root borers, can cause significant damage by tunneling into the plant tissues.

*   **Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
    *   Regularly inspect stems and branches for boreholes, frass (excreta), or wilting.
    *   Prune and destroy severely infested branches.
    *   For young plants, wrap the base of the stem with gunny bags or plastic sheets to deter egg-laying by root borer adults.
    *   Maintain plant vigour through proper nutrition and irrigation.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   For stem borers, inject the insecticide directly into the boreholes and seal them with mud or wet clay to prevent the escape of fumes and ensure efficacy.
        *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: Mix 2-3 ml per litre of water and inject 5-10 ml of this solution into each borehole.
        *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: Mix 0.5-1 ml per litre of water and inject 5-10 ml of this solution into each borehole.
    *   For root borers (if identified), drenching around the base of the plant can be effective.
        *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: Mix 4-5 ml per litre of water and drench 1-2 litres of this solution around the base of each infested plant.

### 2. Control of Caterpillars in Mulberry

Various caterpillar species can defoliate Mulberry plants.

*   **Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
    *   Hand-pick and destroy egg masses and young larvae, especially during early infestation.
    *   Remove and destroy infested leaves or branches.
    *   Ploughing around the base of the trees can expose pupae to predators.

*   **Biological Control:**
    *   Use formulations of *Bacillus thuringiensis* (Bt) which are highly effective against caterpillars and safe for silkworms after a short waiting period.
        *   *Bacillus thuringiensis* (Bt) (various formulations, e.g., WP, SC): Apply at 1-2 g/L or 1-2 ml/L of water as a foliar spray.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   For severe infestations, use CIBRC approved insecticides. Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.
        *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC: 0.3 ml/L of water.
        *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG: 0.2-0.25 g/L of water.
        *   **Flubendiamide** 20% WG: 0.2-0.3 g/L of water.
        *   **Indoxacarb** 14.5% SC: 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Quinalphos** 25% EC: 2 ml/L of water.

### 3. Control of Diamondback Moth in Mulberry

This is not known to affect Mulberry. Diamondback moth (*Plutella xylostella*) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower, mustard).

### 4. Control of Leaf Folder in Mulberry

Leaf folders (e.g., *Diaphania pulverulentalis*, *Glyphodes pyloalis*) cause damage by folding leaves and feeding from within, making them difficult to reach with contact insecticides.

*   **Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
    *   Regularly inspect plants for folded leaves.
    *   Hand-pick and destroy folded leaves containing larvae.
    *   Prune and destroy infested shoots.

*   **Biological Control:**
    *   *Bacillus thuringiensis* (Bt) formulations are effective as the larvae ingest the bacteria while feeding.
        *   *Bacillus thuringiensis* (Bt) (various formulations, e.g., WP, SC): Apply at 1-2 g/L or 1-2 ml/L of water as a foliar spray.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Systemic or translaminar insecticides are more effective as they can reach the larvae inside the folded leaves.
        *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC: 0.3 ml/L of water.
        *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG: 0.2-0.25 g/L of water.
        *   **Flubendiamide** 20% WG: 0.2-0.3 g/L of water.
        *   **Indoxacarb** 14.5% SC: 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Quinalphos** 25% EC: 2 ml/L of water.

### Crucial Note on Silkworm Safety and Waiting Period:

**Since Mulberry leaves are fed to silkworms, the choice of insecticide and the waiting period after application are paramount.**

*   **Always prioritize biological control agents like *Bacillus thuringiensis* (Bt) as they are generally safer for silkworms after a minimal waiting period.**
*   **For chemical insecticides, strictly observe the recommended waiting period (harvest interval) before feeding leaves to silkworms.** This period can range from 7 to 20 days or more, depending on the chemical and its residual effect. Consult the product label or local sericulture department for specific waiting periods for each chemical.
*   **Avoid spraying during the leaf harvesting period.** If spraying is unavoidable, harvest leaves from untreated plots or after the recommended waiting period.

### General Safety Precautions:

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, mask, and protective clothing during mixing and spraying.
*   Do not spray against the wind direction.
*   Avoid contamination of water sources.
*   Store pesticides safely, away from children and livestock.
*   Dispose of empty containers properly.

For any further specific queries or severe infestations, please consult with the local agricultural extension officer or sericulture expert.
