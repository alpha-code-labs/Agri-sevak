As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I strongly recommend a proactive approach to managing micronutrient deficiencies in Mulberry. The first and most crucial step is always **soil testing** to accurately diagnose specific deficiencies and their severity. This allows for targeted and efficient nutrient management.

Here's how to address common micronutrient deficiencies in Mulberry, based on scientific recommendations for Haryana's conditions:

### General Recommendation:
Before any application, conduct a comprehensive soil test through a recognized laboratory (like HAU's soil testing lab) to determine the exact nutrient status of your field. This will prevent over-application and ensure cost-effective management.

### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

*   **Importance:** Essential for enzyme activation, protein synthesis, and growth hormone production, crucial for leaf expansion and overall plant vigor.
*   **Symptoms:** Characterized by "little leaf" disease, where leaves are significantly smaller than normal. Interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, often accompanied by rosetting of leaves at the shoot tips.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   Apply 10-25 kg/acre of **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** (21% Zn) or 7-15 kg/acre of **Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate** (33% Zn) once every 2-3 years, preferably before planting or during pruning. Mix thoroughly with the soil.
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   For quick correction, spray a 0.2-0.5% solution (2-5 g/L of water) of **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate**. To prevent leaf scorch, it is often recommended to add 0.1% (1 g/L) of unslaked lime or urea. Apply 2-3 sprays at 15-day intervals, especially during active growth periods.

### 2. Iron (Fe) Deficiency

*   **Importance:** Vital for chlorophyll formation, photosynthesis, and respiration.
*   **Symptoms:** Pronounced interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, where the veins remain distinctly green while the tissue between them turns yellow. In severe cases, entire leaves may turn pale yellow or white, and growth can be stunted.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   Apply 25-50 kg/acre of **Ferrous Sulphate Heptahydrate** (19% Fe) or 15-30 kg/acre of **Ferrous Sulphate Monohydrate** (30% Fe). For alkaline soils common in Haryana, chelated forms like **Iron EDTA** (12% Fe) at 5-10 kg/acre are more effective as they remain available to the plant.
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray a 0.5-1.0% solution (5-10 g/L of water) of **Ferrous Sulphate Heptahydrate**. Adding 0.1% (1 g/L) citric acid can improve absorption. Alternatively, use a 0.1-0.2% solution (1-2 g/L of water) of **Iron EDTA**. Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals until symptoms disappear.

### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

*   **Importance:** Crucial for cell wall formation, sugar transport, pollen germination, and overall plant development.
*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, death of terminal buds, brittle and distorted young leaves, poor leaf expansion, and sometimes internal necrosis of stems. New shoots may appear bushy or rosetted.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   Apply 5-10 kg/acre of **Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate** (Borax, 11% B) or 2.5-5 kg/acre of **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (20% B). Apply once every 2-3 years, ensuring even distribution.
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray a 0.1-0.2% solution (1-2 g/L of water) of **Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate** or **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate**. Apply 1-2 sprays during active growth, especially before new flushes.

### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

*   **Importance:** Essential for cell wall structure, membrane integrity, and root development.
*   **Symptoms:** Affects young, rapidly growing tissues. Symptoms include distortion and death of terminal buds and young leaves, tip burn, stunted root growth, and overall stunted plant development.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   If soil pH is low, apply **Calcium Carbonate** (agricultural lime) as per soil test recommendations. For general calcium deficiency, apply 200-500 kg/acre of **Calcium Sulphate Dihydrate** (Gypsum) or 50-100 kg/acre of **Calcium Nitrate**. Gypsum is particularly beneficial in sodic soils prevalent in parts of Haryana.
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray a 0.5-1.0% solution (5-10 g/L of water) of **Calcium Nitrate** or **Calcium Chloride**. Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals to young foliage.

### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

*   **Importance:** Central component of chlorophyll, vital for photosynthesis, and an activator for many enzymes.
*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, where the veins remain green but the tissue between them turns yellow, often progressing to reddish-brown or purplish tints. Leaves may become brittle and drop prematurely.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   Apply 25-50 kg/acre of **Magnesium Sulphate Heptahydrate** (Epsom salt). If soil pH is low, **Dolomite** (Calcium Magnesium Carbonate) can be used as per soil test recommendations.
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray a 0.5-1.0% solution (5-10 g/L of water) of **Magnesium Sulphate Heptahydrate**. Apply 2-3 sprays at 15-day intervals, targeting the affected older leaves.

### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

*   **Importance:** Involved in photosynthesis, respiration, and nitrogen metabolism.
*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, similar to iron deficiency but often with a finer network of green veins and sometimes small necrotic (dead) spots appearing in the yellowed areas. Growth may be stunted.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   Apply 10-20 kg/acre of **Manganese Sulphate Monohydrate** (30.5% Mn).
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray a 0.2-0.5% solution (2-5 g/L of water) of **Manganese Sulphate Monohydrate**. Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals during active growth.

### Important Considerations:

*   **Timing:** Foliar applications are most effective when applied to young, actively growing leaves, preferably in the morning or late afternoon to avoid rapid drying and maximize absorption.
*   **Water Quality:** Use clean water for spray solutions.
*   **Compatibility:** Always check the compatibility of different chemicals before mixing them for foliar sprays.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management:** Micronutrient application should be part of a holistic nutrient management plan that also addresses macronutrients (N, P, K) and organic matter enrichment.
*   **Consult Experts:** For severe or persistent deficiencies, consult with HAU extension specialists for tailored advice.
