As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified fertilizer doses for Mulberry cultivation in Haryana. Please note that precise recommendations are best made after a thorough soil test, which helps in understanding the specific nutrient status and pH of your field.

**General NPK Requirements for Irrigated Mulberry (per acre per year):**
*   Nitrogen (N): 100-120 kg
*   Phosphorus (P2O5): 40-60 kg
*   Potassium (K2O): 40-60 kg

These nutrients are typically supplied through various fertilizers, applied in split doses throughout the year, usually after pruning cycles.

**Recommended Doses of Specific Fertilizers:**

1.  **Urea (Nitrogen Source):**
    *   **Basal Application:** 200-250 kg of **Urea** per acre per year. This should be split into 3-4 equal doses and applied after each pruning (e.g., 30-40 days after pruning).
    *   **Nano-Urea (Liquid):** This is a foliar supplement.
        *   **Foliar Spray:** 2-4 ml of **Nano-Urea** per litre of water. Apply 2-3 sprays during the crop cycle, typically 30-45 days after pruning and again before leaf harvest. When used effectively, it can reduce the requirement for granular **Urea** by 25-50%.

2.  **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP) (Nitrogen & Phosphorus Source):**
    *   **Basal Application:** 80-120 kg of **Diammonium Phosphate** per acre per year. This can be applied in 1-2 split doses, usually at the time of major pruning or establishment. This will supply 14.4-21.6 kg N and 36.8-55.2 kg P2O5.
    *   **Nano-DAP (Liquid):** This is a foliar supplement.
        *   **Foliar Spray:** 2-4 ml of **Nano-DAP** per litre of water. Apply 2-3 sprays during the crop cycle, often in conjunction with **Nano-Urea**.

3.  **Single Super Phosphate (SSP) (Phosphorus & Sulphur Source):**
    *   **Basal Application:** As an alternative to **DAP** for Phosphorus, 250-375 kg of **Single Super Phosphate** per acre per year can be applied. This should be applied in 1-2 split doses, usually at the time of major pruning or establishment. This will supply 40-60 kg P2O5 and 27.5-41.25 kg Sulphur.

4.  **Potash (Potassium Source):**
    *   **Muriate of Potash (MOP):**
        *   **Basal Application:** 60-100 kg of **Muriate of Potash** per acre per year. This should be split into 2-3 equal doses and applied after pruning.

5.  **Sulphur:**
    *   **Basal Application:** If **Single Super Phosphate** is used, the Sulphur requirement is largely met. If **Diammonium Phosphate** is used as the primary Phosphorus source, or if soil tests indicate a deficiency, apply 10-15 kg of **Bentonite Sulphur** (90% S) per acre per year, usually once during the major pruning cycle.

6.  **NPK (Complex Fertilizers):**
    *   While individual fertilizers are generally preferred for basal application in mulberry to precisely meet nutrient requirements, complex NPK fertilizers can be used.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Water-soluble NPK formulations (e.g., 19:19:19 or 17:17:17) can be used as a foliar spray at a concentration of 5-10 grams per litre of water, 2-3 times during the crop cycle, especially during periods of active growth or nutrient stress.
    *   **Basal Application:** If a complex NPK fertilizer is chosen for basal application, the dose would depend on the specific NPK ratio and the overall nutrient requirement. However, it is less common for basal application in mulberry compared to using individual nutrient sources like **Urea**, **DAP**/**SSP**, and **Muriate of Potash**.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Soil Testing:** Always conduct a soil test every 2-3 years to get precise recommendations tailored to your field's specific needs.
*   **Application Timing:** Fertilizers should be applied when the soil has adequate moisture, preferably after irrigation or rainfall.
*   **Method of Application:** Basal fertilizers are typically broadcast and incorporated into the soil around the plant base or applied in furrows. Foliar sprays should be done early morning or late evening.
*   **Organic Manures:** Supplement chemical fertilizers with 8-10 tonnes of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost per acre per year to improve soil health and nutrient use efficiency.
