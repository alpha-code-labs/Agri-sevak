Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide you with scientifically verified advice regarding rust diseases in Mulberry.

Firstly, it's important to clarify the specific rusts affecting Mulberry. The primary rust disease affecting Mulberry (Morus spp.) is caused by the fungus *Melampsora mori*. The symptoms of this rust can manifest as yellowish-orange to reddish-brown pustules on the underside of the leaves, which might be broadly described as "yellow," "brown," or "red" rust by growers. "Black rust" is typically associated with cereal crops, and while some rusts can turn dark, it's not a primary descriptive term for *Melampsora mori*.

Regarding "White rust":
*   This is not known to affect Mulberry. White rust is a distinct disease caused by oomycetes of the genus *Albugo*, primarily affecting cruciferous crops and some other plant families, but not Mulberry.

For the control of rust diseases (primarily *Melampsora mori*) in Mulberry, an integrated approach combining cultural practices and judicious chemical application is recommended:

**I. Cultural and Management Practices:**

1.  **Sanitation:**
    *   Collect and destroy all fallen infected leaves and plant debris, especially during the off-season, to reduce the inoculum source.
    *   Prune infected branches or leaves promptly.
2.  **Pruning and Spacing:**
    *   Ensure proper plant spacing to allow for good air circulation within the canopy, which helps in drying leaf surfaces and reducing fungal growth.
    *   Regular pruning helps maintain an open canopy.
3.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Maintain balanced nutrition. Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush, susceptible growth. Ensure adequate potassium, which can improve plant resistance.
4.  **Resistant Varieties:**
    *   Where available and suitable for your region in Haryana, consider planting Mulberry varieties known to have resistance or tolerance to rust diseases.

**II. Chemical Control (Fungicides):**

Fungicides should be applied preventively or at the first sign of disease symptoms, especially during periods of high humidity and moderate temperatures that favor rust development. Always ensure thorough coverage of both upper and lower leaf surfaces.

Here are some CIBRC approved technical chemical names effective against rusts, along with their recommended dosages:

*   **Propiconazole 25% EC:**
    *   Apply at a concentration of **0.5 - 1.0 ml/L** of water.
*   **Difenoconazole 25% EC:**
    *   Apply at a concentration of **0.5 ml/L** of water.
*   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:**
    *   Apply at a concentration of **0.5 - 1.0 ml/L** of water.
*   **Mancozeb 75% WP:**
    *   Apply at a concentration of **2.0 - 2.5 g/L** of water.
*   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP:**
    *   Apply at a concentration of **2.0 - 3.0 g/L** of water. (Note: Sulphur can be phytotoxic at high temperatures, so apply with caution during hot weather).

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Rotation of Fungicides:** To prevent the development of fungicide resistance, it is crucial to rotate fungicides with different modes of action. Do not use the same fungicide repeatedly.
*   **Safety Precautions:** Always read and follow the instructions on the fungicide label, including recommended dosage, application timing, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and personal protective equipment (PPE).
*   **Water Quality:** Use clean water for spraying.
*   **Timing:** Early morning or late evening applications are generally preferred to minimize drift and maximize absorption.

By implementing these measures, you can effectively manage rust diseases in your Mulberry cultivation. For specific local recommendations or severe outbreaks, please consult with the plant pathology department at HAU, Hisar, or your local agricultural extension officer.
