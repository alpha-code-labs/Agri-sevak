Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the challenges posed by Haryana's diverse climate on Mulberry cultivation. Protecting your Mulberry plants from environmental stresses like extreme cold, frost, heat (Loo), and intense sunlight is crucial for their healthy growth and productivity. Here's scientifically verified advice:

### **1. Protection from Extreme Cold and Frost:**

Mulberry, especially young plants, can be susceptible to frost damage. Mature trees are generally hardier but new shoots can be affected.

*   **Pre-Frost Irrigation:** Irrigating the field thoroughly a day or two before an anticipated frost event can significantly help. Moist soil retains heat better than dry soil and releases latent heat as water freezes, raising the ambient temperature around the plants.
*   **Covering Young Plants:** For young saplings or newly established plantations, individual covering can be highly effective. Use materials like straw, hessian cloth (burlap), old sacks, or even plastic sheets (ensure ventilation to prevent condensation buildup) to create a protective canopy. Remove covers during the day if temperatures rise significantly.
*   **Mulching:** Apply a thick layer (10-15 cm) of organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves, sugarcane trash, wood chips) around the base of the plants. This insulates the soil, keeps the root zone warmer, and prevents rapid temperature fluctuations.
*   **Windbreaks:** Planting shelterbelts or windbreaks (e.g., fast-growing trees like Eucalyptus or Poplar) on the northern and western sides of your Mulberry plantation can reduce the impact of cold, dry winds.
*   **Avoid Late Pruning:** Do not prune Mulberry plants late in the season (autumn/early winter) as this stimulates new, tender growth that is highly vulnerable to frost damage.

### **2. Protection from Heat (Loo) and Intense Sunlight:**

Haryana experiences severe heat waves and hot, dry winds (Loo) during summer, which can cause leaf scorch, wilting, and stress in Mulberry.

*   **Adequate and Timely Irrigation:** This is the most critical measure. Ensure plants receive sufficient water, especially during peak summer months and periods of Loo. Frequent, light irrigation can help maintain plant turgor and cool the soil. Consider drip irrigation for efficient water use.
*   **Mulching:** A thick layer of organic mulch (10-15 cm) around the base of the plants is highly beneficial. It conserves soil moisture by reducing evaporation, keeps the root zone cooler, and suppresses weed growth that competes for water.
*   **Shade Nets:** For young plants in nurseries or newly transplanted saplings, temporary shade nets (e.g., 30-50% shade factor) can provide significant relief from intense sunlight and heat. These should be erected during the hottest parts of the day or season.
*   **Windbreaks:** As mentioned for cold, windbreaks are equally effective against hot, desiccating winds (Loo). They reduce wind speed, thereby decreasing transpiration rates and preventing excessive moisture loss from leaves.
*   **Trunk Whitewashing:** For young Mulberry trees, painting the main trunk with a diluted lime wash (calcium carbonate solution) can reflect sunlight and prevent sunscald on the bark, which can lead to cracking and pest entry.
*   **Foliar Water Sprays:** During extreme heat waves, a fine mist of water sprayed over the foliage during the cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) can provide temporary cooling and increase humidity around the plants.

By implementing these scientifically sound cultural practices, you can significantly mitigate the adverse effects of environmental stresses on your Mulberry plants, ensuring their healthy growth and sustained productivity in Haryana's climate.
