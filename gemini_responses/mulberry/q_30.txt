As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified strategies for managing growth issues in Mulberry, keeping in mind the specific conditions of Haryana and the importance of leaf quality for sericulture.

**General Principles:**
*   **Soil Testing:** The foundational step for diagnosing most growth issues is a comprehensive soil test. This will reveal nutrient deficiencies, pH imbalances, and organic matter content, guiding precise interventions. Contact your nearest HAU Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) for soil testing services.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure a balanced supply of macro and micronutrients based on soil test results.
*   **Optimal Water Management:** Provide adequate irrigation, especially during critical growth stages and dry spells, to prevent water stress.
*   **Proper Pruning:** Regular and appropriate pruning is crucial for maintaining plant vigor, desired shape, and promoting vegetative growth.

**1. Slow Growth:**
Slow growth in Mulberry can be indicative of several underlying issues.
*   **Nutrient Deficiency:**
    *   Based on soil test, apply recommended doses of NPK fertilizers. For general vigor, a typical recommendation might be 100-150 kg Nitrogen, 50-60 kg Phosphorus (P2O5), and 50-60 kg Potassium (K2O) per acre per year, split into multiple applications.
    *   Incorporate 8-10 tonnes of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost per acre annually to improve soil structure and nutrient availability.
*   **Water Stress:**
    *   Ensure consistent irrigation, especially during dry periods. Drip irrigation is highly efficient.
*   **Soil Compaction/Poor Aeration:**
    *   Deep ploughing or subsoiling (if applicable) can alleviate compaction.
    *   Regular weeding and light hoeing can improve soil aeration.
*   **pH Imbalance:**
    *   If soil pH is outside the optimal range (6.0-7.0 for Mulberry), consult soil test results for specific amendments. For acidic soils, **Agricultural lime** can be applied. For alkaline soils, **Gypsum** can be used, but this requires careful calculation and application.

**2. Yellow Growth (Chlorosis):**
Yellowing of leaves (chlorosis) often points to specific nutrient deficiencies or environmental stress.
*   **Nitrogen Deficiency (General yellowing, older leaves first):**
    *   Apply **Urea** (46% N) at 50-75 kg/acre, split into 2-3 applications, or as per soil test recommendations.
*   **Iron Deficiency (Interveinal chlorosis, younger leaves first, common in high pH soils):**
    *   Foliar spray of **Ferrous sulphate** (19% Fe) at 0.5% concentration (5 g/L water) with a wetting agent, applied 2-3 times at 10-15 day intervals.
    *   Soil application of **Ferrous sulphate** at 10-20 kg/acre, especially if pH is not excessively high.
*   **Zinc Deficiency (Small, distorted, yellow leaves, short internodes):**
    *   Foliar spray of **Zinc sulphate** (21% Zn) at 0.25-0.5% concentration (2.5-5 g/L water) with a wetting agent, 2-3 times at 10-15 day intervals.
    *   Soil application of **Zinc sulphate** at 10-20 kg/acre once every 2-3 years.
*   **Manganese Deficiency (Interveinal chlorosis, similar to iron but often more mottled):**
    *   Foliar spray of **Manganese sulphate** (30.5% Mn) at 0.25-0.5% concentration (2.5-5 g/L water) with a wetting agent.
*   **Waterlogging:**
    *   Improve drainage in the field to prevent water stagnation, which can lead to root damage and nutrient uptake issues.

**3. Excessive Height:**
Excessive height, especially at the expense of lateral branching and leaf production, can be managed through cultural practices. Chemical growth regulators are generally avoided in mulberry for sericulture due to potential impacts on silkworms.
*   **Pruning:**
    *   **Annual Pruning:** Perform a hard pruning (bottom pruning or middle pruning) once a year to maintain the desired bush or tree height (typically 1.0-1.5 meters for bush type). This encourages vigorous new shoots.
    *   **Shoot Pruning/Topping:** Regularly pinch back or prune the terminal buds of rapidly growing shoots to encourage lateral branching and a bushier canopy, which increases leaf yield.
*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Adjust nitrogen application. Excessive nitrogen can promote lush, vertical growth. Ensure a balanced NPK ratio.

**4. Excessive Flowering:**
Excessive flowering diverts energy from vegetative growth, which is undesirable for silkworm rearing as it reduces leaf yield and quality.
*   **De-flowering/De-budding:**
    *   Manually remove flower buds or young flowers as soon as they appear. This is the most effective and recommended method to redirect plant energy towards leaf production.
*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Ensure adequate nitrogen and potassium supply to support vegetative growth. Avoid excessive phosphorus, which can sometimes promote flowering.
*   **Stress Management:**
    *   Ensure optimal irrigation and nutrient supply to minimize plant stress, as stress can sometimes induce premature or excessive flowering.
