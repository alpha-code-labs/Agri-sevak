As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I emphasize that proper macro-nutrient management is crucial for healthy mulberry growth, optimal leaf yield, and quality, which directly impacts sericulture. Soil testing is the foundational step before applying any fertilizers, as it provides precise recommendations tailored to your specific field conditions.

Here's how to address deficiencies of Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K) in Mulberry:

### General Recommendations for Mulberry in Haryana (Based on Soil Testing)

For a typical mulberry plantation in Haryana, general recommendations often range as follows, but *always* adjust based on your soil test report:
*   **Nitrogen (N):** 100-200 kg N per acre per year
*   **Phosphorus (P2O5):** 40-80 kg P2O5 per acre per year
*   **Potassium (K2O):** 40-80 kg K2O per acre per year

These are applied in different splits and timings as detailed below.

### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

Nitrogen is vital for vegetative growth, chlorophyll formation, and protein synthesis, directly impacting leaf yield and quality.

*   **Symptoms:**
    *   General yellowing (chlorosis) of older leaves, starting from the tips and margins, progressing inwards.
    *   Stunted plant growth with thin, weak stems.
    *   Reduced leaf size and overall vigor.
    *   Premature leaf drop.
*   **Addressing Deficiency:**
    *   **Soil Testing:** Essential to determine the exact N requirement.
    *   **Fertilizers:**
        *   **Urea** (46% N): Most common and cost-effective.
        *   **Ammonium Sulphate** (20.6% N): Also provides sulphur, beneficial in some soils.
    *   **Application:**
        *   Apply N in 3-4 split doses throughout the year, especially after each leaf harvest (pruning) or during active growth phases. This minimizes leaching losses and ensures continuous availability.
        *   **Dosage (General Guideline, adjust per soil test):** If 150 kg N/acre/year is recommended, apply approximately 325 kg of **Urea** per acre per year in splits (e.g., 80-85 kg **Urea** per acre per application, 4 times a year).
        *   Broadcast evenly around the base of the plants and lightly incorporate into the soil, followed by irrigation.

### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

Phosphorus is crucial for root development, energy transfer, flowering, and fruit development (though less critical for mulberry leaf production than N and K), and overall plant vigor.

*   **Symptoms:**
    *   Dark green to bluish-green leaves, sometimes with a purplish tint on the underside of older leaves and stems.
    *   Stunted growth, particularly poor root development.
    *   Delayed maturity.
    *   Reduced leaf expansion.
*   **Addressing Deficiency:**
    *   **Soil Testing:** Crucial as P mobility in soil is low, and excess can lead to micronutrient imbalances.
    *   **Fertilizers:**
        *   **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5): Provides P and also Calcium and Sulphur.
        *   **Di-Ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (46% P2O5, 18% N): Provides both P and N.
    *   **Application:**
        *   Phosphorus is best applied as a basal dose during planting or during annual pruning/rejuvenation, as it moves slowly in the soil.
        *   **Dosage (General Guideline, adjust per soil test):** If 60 kg P2O5/acre/year is recommended, apply approximately 375 kg of **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** per acre per year, or about 130 kg of **Di-Ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** per acre per year.
        *   Apply in furrows or broadcast and incorporate into the soil before planting or during major pruning, ensuring it's within the root zone.

### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency

Potassium (Potash) is essential for water regulation, disease resistance, enzyme activation, and carbohydrate metabolism, contributing to leaf quality and plant resilience.

*   **Symptoms:**
    *   Yellowing and scorching (necrosis) of leaf margins, especially on older leaves, starting from the tips and progressing inwards.
    *   Weak stems and increased susceptibility to lodging.
    *   Reduced disease resistance.
    *   Overall poor plant vigor.
*   **Addressing Deficiency:**
    *   **Soil Testing:** Important to determine the required K levels.
    *   **Fertilizers:**
        *   **Muriate of Potash (MOP) / Potassium Chloride** (60% K2O): Most common and economical.
        *   **Sulphate of Potash (SOP) / Potassium Sulphate** (50% K2O, 18% S): Preferred in soils where chloride sensitivity is a concern or sulphur is also deficient.
    *   **Application:**
        *   Apply K in 2-3 split doses, similar to Nitrogen, during active growth periods or after pruning.
        *   **Dosage (General Guideline, adjust per soil test):** If 60 kg K2O/acre/year is recommended, apply approximately 100 kg of **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** per acre per year, or 120 kg of **Sulphate of Potash (SOP)** per acre per year, in splits.
        *   Broadcast evenly around the plants and lightly incorporate, followed by irrigation.

### Important Considerations:

*   **Soil Testing:** This cannot be overstressed. Get your soil tested every 2-3 years to get precise recommendations for N, P, K, and micronutrients. HAU provides excellent soil testing facilities.
*   **Organic Matter:** Incorporating farmyard manure (FYM) or compost (5-10 tonnes/acre annually) significantly improves soil health, nutrient retention, and microbial activity, reducing reliance on synthetic fertilizers.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management (INM):** Combine chemical fertilizers with organic manures, bio-fertilizers (e.g., Azotobacter for N, PSB for P), and green manuring practices for sustainable nutrient management.
*   **Irrigation:** Ensure adequate and timely irrigation after fertilizer application to facilitate nutrient dissolution and uptake by roots.
*   **Timing:** Apply fertilizers when the soil is moist, but not waterlogged. Avoid application during heavy rainfall or extreme drought.

By following these scientifically verified guidelines, tailored with precise soil test results, you can effectively manage macro-nutrient deficiencies in your mulberry plantation for optimal yield and quality.
