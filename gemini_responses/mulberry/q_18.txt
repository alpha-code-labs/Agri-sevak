Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist from Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified recommendations for the use of growth regulators and micronutrients in Mulberry cultivation in Haryana.

Here are the recommendations for **Ethephon**, **2,4-D**, and **Boron**:

### 1. Ethephon (Technical name: **Ethephon**)

**Ethephon** is a plant growth regulator that releases ethylene within plant tissues, influencing various physiological processes.

*   **Purpose:** Primarily used for promoting rooting in mulberry cuttings and, in some specific contexts, for enhancing leaf yield.
*   **Recommendations:**
    *   **For Rooting of Cuttings:** To improve rooting percentage and vigor of mulberry cuttings, dip the basal portion (about 5-10 cm) of the cuttings in a solution of **Ethephon** at **100-200 ppm** (parts per million) for 12-24 hours before planting.
        *   *Calculation Example:* If using a 40% Ethephon formulation, this translates to approximately **0.25-0.5 ml/L** of water.
    *   **For Enhancing Leaf Yield (Use with caution):** Foliar spray of **Ethephon** at very low concentrations (e.g., **100-250 ppm**) can sometimes be explored to influence leaf growth and yield. This application should be done judiciously, typically 15-20 days after pruning, depending on the specific mulberry variety and desired effect.
        *   *Calculation Example:* If using a 40% Ethephon formulation, this translates to approximately **0.25-0.625 ml/L** of water.
        *   **Caution:** Higher doses can lead to premature leaf yellowing and defoliation, which is detrimental for silkworm rearing. Always conduct small-scale trials before widespread application.

### 2. 2,4-D (Technical name: **2,4-D**)

**2,4-D** is primarily known and registered as a selective herbicide. While auxins (which include 2,4-D at extremely low concentrations) can influence plant growth, its use as a beneficial growth regulator for enhancing leaf yield or quality in mulberry is **not a standard or recommended practice** in sericulture.

*   **Recommendation:** The application of **2,4-D** for growth regulation in mulberry is **strongly discouraged**. Misapplication, even at seemingly low doses, can lead to severe phytotoxicity, leaf deformation, and significant reduction in leaf quality and yield, rendering the leaves unsuitable for silkworm rearing. There are no established, safe, and beneficial recommendations for its use as a growth regulator in mulberry for commercial sericulture.

### 3. Boron (Technical names: **Boric acid** or **Borax** - Sodium tetraborate decahydrate)

Boron is an essential micronutrient crucial for various physiological processes in mulberry, including cell wall formation, sugar transport, flowering, and overall plant development. Its deficiency can lead to stunted growth, deformed leaves, and reduced leaf yield and quality.

*   **Purpose:** To correct Boron deficiency and ensure optimal plant growth and leaf quality.
*   **Recommendations:**
    *   **Foliar Application (for deficiency correction or general supplementation):**
        *   Spray a solution of **Boric acid** or **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate) at **0.1% - 0.2%** concentration.
        *   This translates to **1-2 g/L** of water.
        *   Apply as a foliar spray, ensuring thorough coverage of the leaves, especially during active growth phases or when deficiency symptoms (e.g., stunted growth, brittle leaves, chlorosis) are observed. Repeat if necessary, typically at intervals of 30-45 days.
    *   **Soil Application (for prophylactic or severe deficiency):**
        *   Apply **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate) at **5-10 kg/acre** as a basal application.
        *   This should be mixed thoroughly with other fertilizers or soil and applied once a year, preferably during pruning or land preparation. Soil application is best guided by soil test reports.

Always ensure precise measurement of chemicals and follow safety guidelines during application. For specific local conditions, it is advisable to consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts.
