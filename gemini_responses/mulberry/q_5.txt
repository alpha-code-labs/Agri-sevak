As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Scab, Canker, Gummosis, and Lichen in Mulberry:

### Control Measures for Mulberry Diseases and Conditions

**1. Scab (Caused by *Sphaceloma mori*)**

Mulberry scab is a fungal disease that causes small, circular, olive-green spots on leaves, petioles, and young twigs, which later turn brown to black and become sunken. Severe infection can lead to defoliation and reduced leaf quality.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Collect and destroy fallen infected leaves and twigs to reduce inoculum.
    *   Prune infected branches during dormancy.
    *   Ensure proper spacing between plants for good air circulation.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   At the first sign of disease, spray with:
        *   **Carbendazim 50% WP** at 0.5-1 g/L of water.
        *   **Mancozeb 75% WP** at 2-2.5 g/L of water.
    *   Repeat the spray at 10-15 day intervals, especially during humid conditions, until the disease is under control.

**2. Canker**

Canker diseases in Mulberry can be caused by various fungi or bacteria, leading to sunken, discolored lesions on branches and trunks, often with oozing sap. This can girdle branches and lead to dieback.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Prune out infected branches well below the visible canker, ensuring to cut into healthy wood.
    *   Sterilize pruning tools with a 10% bleach solution or methylated spirit between cuts to prevent disease spread.
    *   Avoid mechanical injuries to the bark, as these can be entry points for pathogens.
    *   Maintain tree vigor through proper nutrition and irrigation.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   After pruning, apply a protective paste to the cut surfaces and canker lesions (after scraping them gently) using:
        *   **Copper Oxychloride 50% WP** mixed with water to form a thick paste.
    *   For general protection, especially after pruning or during periods conducive to disease, a foliar spray can be applied:
        *   **Copper Oxychloride 50% WP** at 2.5-3 g/L of water.

**3. Gummosis**

Gummosis is the exudation of gum from the bark of Mulberry trees. It is often a symptom of stress, injury, insect borers, or underlying fungal/bacterial infections rather than a primary disease itself.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Identify and address the underlying cause:
        *   Ensure proper irrigation to avoid water stress (both deficit and excess).
        *   Provide balanced nutrition.
        *   Protect trees from mechanical injuries.
        *   Inspect for insect borers and manage them if present.
    *   Prune severely affected branches.
    *   Maintain overall tree health and vigor.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   If a fungal or bacterial pathogen is suspected as the cause of gummosis, a trunk wash or spray can be beneficial:
        *   **Copper Oxychloride 50% WP** at 2.5-3 g/L of water, applied to the trunk and affected branches.
    *   For specific fungal pathogens like *Phytophthora* (which can cause root rot and gummosis), a drench or spray with:
        *   **Fosetyl-aluminium 80% WP** at 2.5-3 g/L of water.

**4. Lichen**

Lichens are symbiotic organisms (fungus and alga) that grow on the bark of trees, including Mulberry. They are epiphytes and generally do not harm the tree by drawing nutrients. Their presence often indicates good air quality and can sometimes be more prevalent on older, less vigorous trees or in areas with high humidity.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Improve air circulation around the trees by judicious pruning of dense canopy.
    *   Maintain tree vigor through proper cultural practices.
    *   In most cases, no control is necessary as lichens are harmless.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   If removal is desired for aesthetic reasons or to improve bark health, a mild fungicidal spray can help dislodge them:
        *   **Copper Oxychloride 50% WP** at 2.5-3 g/L of water.
    *   After spraying, a gentle scrubbing with a soft brush can help remove the loosened lichens.

**Important Note:** Always follow label instructions for any chemical application. For precise diagnosis and tailored recommendations, it is advisable to consult with local agricultural extension specialists or plant pathologists.
