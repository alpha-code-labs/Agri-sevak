As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following practices for mulberry transplantation in Haryana:

### Ideal Transplantation Time

The most suitable periods for mulberry transplantation in Haryana, considering the local climatic conditions, are:

*   **Monsoon Season:** **July to August** is highly recommended. The abundant rainfall during this period significantly aids in root establishment, reduces transplant shock, and minimizes the need for frequent irrigation, leading to higher success rates.
*   **Late Winter/Early Spring:** **February to March** can also be a suitable period. This allows the plants to establish before the onset of intense summer heat, provided adequate irrigation facilities are available.

### Distance for Transplantation

The ideal spacing for mulberry depends on the system of cultivation and the purpose (e.g., silkworm rearing, fruit production). For silkworm rearing, which is the primary purpose in Haryana, the following spacings are common:

*   **Bush Plantation (most common for silkworm rearing):**
    *   **Traditional Bush System:** 90 cm x 90 cm (plant to plant and row to row). This allows for good canopy development and ease of leaf harvesting.
    *   **High-Density Bush System:** 60 cm x 60 cm. This system aims for higher leaf yield per unit area but requires intensive management.
*   **Tree Plantation:** 3 m x 3 m to 4 m x 4 m. This system is less common for commercial silkworm rearing but is used for specific varieties or purposes.
*   **Hedgerow System:** 90 cm between plants within a row, and 1.5 m to 2 m between rows. This system facilitates mechanical harvesting in some regions.

### Transplantation Process

The successful transplantation of mulberry involves several critical steps:

1.  **Land Preparation:**
    *   Plough the land thoroughly to a depth of 25-30 cm, followed by 2-3 harrowing operations to achieve a fine, friable tilth.
    *   Level the field to ensure uniform water distribution and prevent waterlogging in certain areas.

2.  **Pit/Trench Preparation:**
    *   For bush plantation (e.g., 90 cm x 90 cm spacing), dig pits of 30 cm x 30 cm x 30 cm at the marked distances.
    *   Mix the excavated soil with well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) at a ratio of 1:1 or 1:2 (soil:FYM). Approximately 5-10 kg of FYM per pit is recommended to enrich the soil and improve its structure.
    *   Refill the pits with this mixture a few days (preferably 7-10 days) before the actual transplantation to allow the soil to settle.

3.  **Selection of Planting Material:**
    *   Use healthy, well-rooted saplings (typically 6-9 months old) raised from cuttings in a nursery.
    *   Ensure the saplings have 4-6 healthy, well-developed leaves and a robust, undamaged root system. Avoid saplings showing any signs of disease or pest infestation.

4.  **Transplantation:**
    *   Carefully remove the saplings from the nursery beds or polybags, ensuring minimal disturbance and damage to the root ball.
    *   Place one sapling centrally in each prepared pit.
    *   Backfill the pit with the remaining soil-FYM mixture, gently firming the soil around the base of the plant to remove any air pockets.
    *   Ensure that the collar region (where the stem meets the roots) of the sapling is at ground level, not too deep or too shallow.

5.  **Post-Transplantation Care:**
    *   **Watering:** Immediately after transplantation, provide light irrigation to help settle the soil around the roots and reduce transplant shock. Continue regular watering, especially during dry spells, until the plants are well-established.
    *   **Mulching:** Apply a layer of organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves, crop residues) around the base of the young plants. This helps conserve soil moisture, suppress weed growth, and regulate soil temperature.
    *   **Weeding:** Keep the area around the young plants free from weeds, which compete for essential nutrients and moisture.
    *   **Protection:** Protect young saplings from grazing animals, strong winds, and intense direct sunlight if transplanted during hotter periods.
    *   **Initial Pruning:** Once the plants are established (typically after 2-3 months), perform an initial pruning to encourage lateral branching and develop the desired bush or tree shape.
