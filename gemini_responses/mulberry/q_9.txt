Mites, including Red spider mite (*Tetranychus urticae*) and Rust mites (*Aceria mori*), are significant pests of Mulberry in Haryana, causing leaf damage, reduced photosynthetic efficiency, and ultimately impacting silk production. Effective management involves an integrated approach:

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   **Regular Monitoring:** Inspect mulberry leaves regularly, especially the undersides, for early signs of mite infestation (stippling, webbing, bronzing, or rust-like appearance).
*   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy severely infested leaves or branches to reduce pest load.
*   **Water Spray:** A strong jet of water can dislodge mites from the leaves, especially effective for spider mites. This should be done early in the morning.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Keep the mulberry garden free of weeds, which can act as alternate hosts for mites.

**2. Biological Control:**
*   **Natural Enemies:** Encourage natural predators like predatory mites (e.g., *Amblyseius* species), ladybird beetles, and lacewings, which feed on pest mites. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

**3. Chemical Control (Acaricides):**
When mite populations are high and causing economic damage, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development. Ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves.

*   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP:** Apply at a concentration of 2.0 - 3.0 g per litre of water. Sulphur is effective against rust mites and also suppresses spider mites.
*   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** Apply at a concentration of 0.5 - 0.7 ml per litre of water. This is highly effective against all stages of spider mites, including eggs and nymphs.
*   **Fenpyroximate 5% EC:** Apply at a concentration of 0.5 - 1.0 ml per litre of water. It provides good control against various mite species and their life stages.
*   **Propargite 57% EC:** Apply at a concentration of 1.0 - 1.5 ml per litre of water. This is a well-established acaricide effective against spider mites.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the label instructions of the chosen acaricide for specific dosage, application timing, and safety precautions.
*   Ensure proper coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where mites are most prevalent.
*   Repeat applications may be necessary based on infestation severity and product residual activity, adhering to recommended intervals.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension services or HAU experts for the most current recommendations and specific product availability in your region.
