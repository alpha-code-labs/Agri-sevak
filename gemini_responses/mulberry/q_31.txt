Namaste, fellow farmer. As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concerns regarding physical damage in Mulberry. These issues are indeed common and can significantly impact yield and quality. Here's a scientific approach to manage them:

**1. Fruit Bursting (Cracking)**
This condition is primarily caused by fluctuations in soil moisture, especially sudden water uptake after a dry spell, which leads to rapid expansion of fruit skin. Nutrient imbalances can also contribute.

*   **Consistent Irrigation:** Maintain uniform soil moisture throughout the fruit development period. Avoid extremes of drought followed by heavy watering. Drip irrigation is highly recommended for precise water delivery.
*   **Mulching:** Apply a 10-15 cm layer of organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves, sugarcane trash) around the base of the plants. This helps conserve soil moisture, regulate soil temperature, and reduce evaporation.
*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Calcium:** Essential for cell wall integrity. For soil application, use **Calcium nitrate** at 10-15 kg/acre, split into 2-3 applications during fruit development. For foliar application, spray **Calcium chloride** at 5-7 g/L of water, starting from fruit set at 10-15 day intervals.
    *   **Boron:** Crucial for cell wall formation and calcium utilization. For soil application, use **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate) at 4-6 kg/acre or **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** at 1-1.5 kg/acre, based on soil test recommendations. For foliar application, spray **Borax** at 1-1.5 g/L of water.

**2. Leaf Burning/Melting**
This is often a result of heat stress, intense sunlight, water scarcity, or improper chemical application.

*   **Shade Management:** During peak summer months (April-June) in Haryana, consider providing partial shade (e.g., 30-50% shade net) for young plants or sensitive varieties, especially during the hottest part of the day (12 PM - 4 PM).
*   **Adequate Irrigation:** Ensure consistent and sufficient water supply, particularly during hot and dry periods. Water deeply in the early morning hours to allow foliage to dry before nightfall.
*   **Mulching:** As mentioned above, mulching helps regulate soil temperature and moisture, reducing overall plant stress.
*   **Proper Chemical Application:** Always adhere to recommended dosages and application timings for any pesticides or fertilizers. Avoid spraying during high temperatures or direct intense sunlight, as this can lead to phytotoxicity (chemical burn).
*   **Windbreaks:** Planting windbreaks around the mulberry orchard can protect plants from hot, desiccating winds.

**3. Hardness in Fruit**
This condition typically indicates issues with fruit ripening or development, often linked to environmental stress or nutrient imbalances.

*   **Optimal Harvesting Time:** Harvest fruits only when they reach physiological maturity, indicated by their characteristic color change and natural softening. Premature harvesting will result in hard, unripe fruits.
*   **Consistent Water Supply:** Maintain uniform soil moisture throughout the fruit development and ripening stages. Water stress can hinder proper fruit development.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:**
    *   **Potassium:** Crucial for fruit size, quality, and ripening. Apply **Potassium sulphate** at 20-30 kg/acre or **Potassium chloride** (Muriate of Potash) at 15-25 kg/acre, based on soil test recommendations, during fruit development.
    *   **Calcium:** While primarily for cell wall strength, adequate calcium can indirectly contribute to better fruit texture.
*   **Temperature Management:** While large-scale control is difficult, ensuring good air circulation within the orchard can help mitigate localized heat stress during fruit development.

By implementing these scientifically sound practices, you can significantly reduce physical damage in your mulberry crop and ensure a healthier, more productive yield. For precise nutrient recommendations, I strongly advise conducting a soil test through HAU or a certified laboratory.
