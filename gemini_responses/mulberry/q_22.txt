As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified recommendations for Mulberry cultivation, primarily for commercial leaf production (sericulture), which relies on vegetative propagation.

*   **Propagation Method (instead of Sowing Method):**
    *   For commercial leaf production, Mulberry is predominantly propagated through **hardwood stem cuttings**, not seeds. Seed propagation is generally reserved for breeding purposes or raising rootstock.
    *   Cuttings should be healthy, mature, and taken from disease-free mother plants. Each cutting should be 15-20 cm long, with 3-4 healthy buds, and a diameter of 1.0-1.5 cm.

*   **Planting Method and Pattern:**
    *   **Method:** Cuttings are directly planted in the main field.
    *   **Pattern:** The most common system for sericulture in Haryana is the **Bush System**, which facilitates easy harvesting and pruning.
        *   **Row-to-row spacing:** 60 cm to 90 cm.
        *   **Plant-to-plant spacing:** 30 cm to 60 cm.
        *   A widely recommended spacing for optimal leaf yield and management in Haryana conditions is **90 cm (row-to-row) x 60 cm (plant-to-plant)**.
        *   Other systems like the Paired Row System (e.g., 90 cm between rows in a pair, 150 cm between pairs, and 30 cm plant-to-plant) can also be adopted for higher density.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   For stem cuttings, approximately **10-15 cm** of the cutting should be buried in the soil. This ensures that at least two buds are below the soil surface for root development and one to two buds are above for shoot growth.

*   **Planting Material Dose (instead of Seed Dose):**
    *   Since cuttings are used, the "dose" refers to the number of cuttings required per unit area.
    *   For the recommended spacing of 90 cm x 60 cm, approximately 18,500 cuttings are needed per hectare.
    *   To account for potential mortality and replacements during establishment, it is advisable to prepare **8,000 to 9,000 cuttings per acre** (or 20,000 to 22,000 cuttings per hectare).
