Mulberry plants are susceptible to infestation by sap-sucking pests like Scale insects and Mealybugs, which can significantly impact leaf quality and yield, especially crucial for sericulture. Effective management requires an integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical control measures.

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   **Pruning:** Regularly inspect plants and prune heavily infested branches, twigs, and leaves. Dispose of the pruned material by burning or burying it away from the field to prevent further spread.
*   **Manual Removal:** For light infestations, mealybugs can be dislodged using a strong jet of water or by wiping them off with a cloth dipped in soapy water. Scale insects are more challenging to remove manually due to their protective covering.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Maintain a clean mulberry garden by removing weeds and debris, which can harbor pests.
*   **Monitoring:** Regularly monitor plants, paying close attention to the undersides of leaves, stem joints, and bark crevices for early detection of pests.

**2. Biological Control:**
*   Encourage natural enemies such as ladybird beetles (predators of mealybugs and scales) and parasitic wasps. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that can harm these beneficial insects.

**3. Chemical Control (when necessary):**
When infestations are severe and cultural/biological methods are insufficient, chemical intervention may be required. Always follow label instructions and safety precautions. Apply insecticides preferably in the morning or late afternoon.

For effective control of Scale insects and Mealybugs in Mulberry, the following CIBRC-approved technical chemicals can be used:

*   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at a rate of **1.25 ml per litre of water** (or 500 ml per acre in 400 litres of water). Buprofezin acts as an insect growth regulator, primarily affecting the nymphal stages.
*   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at a rate of **0.5 - 0.75 ml per litre of water**. This is a systemic insecticide that is absorbed by the plant and ingested by the sap-sucking pests.
*   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at a rate of **0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water**. Similar to Imidacloprid, Thiamethoxam is a systemic insecticide effective against sap-sucking pests.
*   **Horticultural Mineral Oil (HMO):** Apply at a concentration of **10-20 ml per litre of water** (1-2% solution). HMO works by suffocating the pests and disrupting their respiration. It is particularly effective against scale insects and mealybugs, especially their younger stages, and is generally safer for beneficial insects when used correctly. Ensure thorough coverage.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Rotation of Chemicals:** To prevent the development of resistance, rotate insecticides with different modes of action.
*   **Thorough Coverage:** Ensure complete coverage of the plant, especially the undersides of leaves, stem crevices, and bark where these pests tend to hide.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, and protective clothing while handling and applying pesticides.
*   **Pre-harvest Interval (PHI):** Be mindful of the pre-harvest interval (PHI) for any insecticide used, especially if mulberry leaves are intended for silkworm rearing. Consult the product label for specific PHI recommendations to ensure the safety of silkworms.
