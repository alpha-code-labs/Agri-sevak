Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing pests in Mulberry.

Effective pest management in Mulberry relies on an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, mechanical, biological, and judicious chemical methods.

### Control of Beetles and Weevils in Mulberry

Beetles and weevils can cause significant damage to Mulberry, affecting leaves, stems, and roots. Common types include stem borers (e.g., longhorn beetles), leaf-feeding beetles, and root weevils.

**Symptoms:**
*   **Stem Borers:** Wilting of branches, presence of frass (sawdust-like material) near boreholes, gummosis, and ultimately branch dieback or tree death.
*   **Leaf Feeders:** Holes in leaves, skeletonization, or complete defoliation.
*   **Root Weevils:** Stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, and general decline of the plant due to root damage.

**Integrated Management Strategies:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Pruning:** Regularly remove and destroy infested or dead branches to eliminate breeding sites for borers.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Keep the area around Mulberry trees clean of weeds and debris, which can harbor pests.
    *   **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect plants for early signs of pest infestation, especially during vulnerable stages.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure proper fertilization and irrigation to maintain plant vigor, making them more resilient to pest attacks.

2.  **Mechanical Control:**
    *   **Hand Picking:** For visible leaf-feeding beetles or weevils, hand-picking and destroying them can be effective in small plantations.
    *   **Physical Removal of Borers:** For stem borers, a wire can sometimes be inserted into boreholes to kill the larvae.

3.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Encourage natural enemies like predatory beetles, parasitic wasps, and birds that feed on these pests. Avoid broad-spectrum pesticides that harm beneficial insects.

4.  **Chemical Control (Use with extreme caution, especially if leaves are for sericulture):**
    *   **CRITICAL WARNING FOR SERICULTURE:** If the Mulberry leaves are intended for silkworm rearing, **NO CHEMICAL INSECTICIDE SHOULD BE APPLIED**. Silkworms are extremely sensitive to most insecticides, and even minute residues can cause severe mortality or deformities. In such cases, rely solely on cultural, mechanical, and biological control methods.
    *   For Mulberry grown for fruit, timber, or other purposes where sericulture is not involved, the following CIBRC approved insecticides can be considered:

    *   **For Stem Borers and Root Weevils (Drenching/Swabbing):**
        *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC:** Apply 2.5 ml per litre of water for swabbing affected stems or drenching the soil around the base of the plant (4 litres per acre for soil drenching) to control borers and root weevils.

    *   **For Leaf-Feeding Beetles and Weevils (Foliar Spray):**
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** Spray at a concentration of 0.5 ml per litre of water (100-150 ml per acre, depending on canopy size and water volume).
        *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Spray at a concentration of 0.5 ml per litre of water. This is a systemic insecticide effective against some leaf feeders.
        *   **Cypermethrin 25% EC:** Spray at a concentration of 0.5 ml per litre of water (100-150 ml per acre).

    *   **Application Notes:**
        *   Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions.
        *   Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage or affected parts.
        *   Observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) if the fruit is to be consumed.

### Control of Sawflies in Mulberry

Sawflies are not commonly reported as a major pest of Mulberry in Haryana or India. While occasional defoliation by general insect pests might occur, specific sawfly species causing significant economic damage to Mulberry are not well-documented.

**This is not known to affect Mulberry as a major pest requiring specific chemical intervention.**

If you observe general defoliation that you suspect might be due to sawfly-like larvae, the cultural and mechanical methods mentioned for beetles and weevils (like hand-picking) would be the first line of defense. If chemical intervention is deemed absolutely necessary (and again, **NOT for sericulture**), the broad-spectrum insecticides listed for leaf-feeding beetles (e.g., **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC** or **Cypermethrin 25% EC**) might offer control, but this should be done only after proper identification and consultation.

**General Recommendations:**
*   Always consult with local agricultural extension specialists or HAU experts for precise identification of pests and the most current, region-specific recommendations.
*   Prioritize non-chemical methods, especially for Mulberry intended for sericulture.
*   When using chemicals, wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) and dispose of empty containers safely.
