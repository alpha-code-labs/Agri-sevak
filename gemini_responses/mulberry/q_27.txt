As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the suitable climate, soil type, and drainage requirements for Mulberry (Morus spp.) in Haryana:

**1. Climate Requirements for Mulberry:**

*   **Temperature:** Mulberry is a hardy plant and can tolerate a wide range of temperatures.
    *   **Optimal Growth:** 24°C to 28°C is ideal for vigorous growth and good leaf production.
    *   **Tolerable Range:** It can withstand temperatures from -5°C to 40°C. However, prolonged exposure to extreme cold (frost) can damage young shoots and leaves, while very high temperatures (above 38°C) can lead to leaf scorching and reduced quality.
*   **Rainfall:**
    *   **Optimal:** An annual rainfall of 600 mm to 2500 mm, well-distributed throughout the growing season, is highly beneficial.
    *   **Haryana Context:** In regions of Haryana with lower or erratic rainfall, supplementary irrigation is crucial, especially during dry spells, to ensure consistent leaf yield and quality.
*   **Sunshine:** Mulberry requires ample sunlight for optimal photosynthesis and growth. A minimum of 8-10 hours of direct sunlight per day is ideal.
*   **Humidity:** Moderate humidity is generally preferred for healthy leaf development.

**2. Soil Type Requirements for Mulberry:**

*   **Texture:**
    *   **Ideal:** Deep, fertile, well-drained loamy to sandy-loam soils are most suitable. These soils offer a good balance of water retention and aeration.
    *   **Avoid:** Heavy clay soils that impede drainage and very sandy soils that have poor water and nutrient retention capacity are less ideal.
*   **pH:**
    *   **Optimal:** Slightly acidic to neutral soil pH, ranging from 6.2 to 6.8, is considered optimal for nutrient availability and mulberry growth.
    *   **Tolerable Range:** It can tolerate a pH range of 5.5 to 7.5, but growth may be suboptimal at the extremes.
*   **Organic Matter:** Soils rich in organic matter are highly preferred as they improve soil structure, water holding capacity, and nutrient availability.
*   **Salinity/Alkalinity:** Mulberry is sensitive to high soil salinity and alkalinity. In areas of Haryana with such issues, soil amendments and proper management practices are necessary.

**3. Drainage Requirements for Mulberry:**

*   **Crucial Importance:** Mulberry is highly susceptible to waterlogging. Excellent drainage is paramount for its healthy growth and survival.
*   **Impact of Poor Drainage:** Waterlogged conditions lead to root rot, oxygen deprivation for roots, nutrient deficiencies, and ultimately, stunted growth or plant death.
*   **Ideal Conditions:** The soil should be well-drained, allowing excess water to percolate freely away from the root zone. The water table should ideally be below 1.5 to 2 meters.
*   **Management:** In areas with naturally poor drainage or heavy soils, measures such as planting on raised beds, creating proper drainage channels, and improving soil structure with organic matter are essential to prevent water accumulation around the roots.
