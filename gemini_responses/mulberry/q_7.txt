As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Dieback, Twig blight, and Tikka disease in Mulberry, keeping in mind CIBRC approved chemicals for Haryana.

### 1. Dieback in Mulberry

Dieback is characterized by the progressive drying and death of branches, starting from the tip and moving downwards. It can be caused by various factors including fungal pathogens, environmental stress (drought, frost, nutrient deficiency), or improper pruning.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Pruning:** Promptly prune affected branches well below the visible symptoms, cutting into healthy wood.
    *   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy all pruned diseased material to reduce inoculum.
    *   **Plant Vigor:** Maintain tree health through balanced fertilization and adequate irrigation.
    *   **Injury Prevention:** Avoid mechanical injuries to the plant, as these can serve as entry points for pathogens.
*   **Chemical Control (Post-pruning application to protect cuts and prevent further spread):**
    *   Spray with a fungicide after pruning.
    *   **Copper Oxychloride** @ 2.5-3.0 g/L of water.
    *   **Carbendazim** @ 1.0 g/L of water.

### 2. Twig Blight in Mulberry

Twig blight manifests as wilting, browning, and death of young twigs and shoots, often accompanied by cankers or lesions. It is primarily caused by fungal pathogens.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Pruning:** Regularly inspect plants and prune out and destroy all infected twigs and branches as soon as symptoms appear.
    *   **Air Circulation:** Ensure good air circulation within the canopy through proper plant spacing and judicious pruning.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Spray with a suitable fungicide at the onset of symptoms and repeat if necessary.
    *   **Mancozeb** @ 2.0-2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Carbendazim** @ 1.0 g/L of water.
    *   **Propiconazole** @ 0.5 ml/L of water.

### 3. Tikka Disease in Mulberry

"Tikka disease" is a common name primarily associated with leaf spot diseases in groundnut (caused by *Cercospora arachidicola* and *Phaeoisariopsis personata*). While Mulberry is susceptible to leaf spot diseases caused by *Cercospora moricola* and other fungi, the term "Tikka disease" is not standard for Mulberry in scientific literature. However, if you are observing symptoms similar to leaf spots, the following advice applies to *Cercospora* leaf spot in Mulberry.

**Symptoms (Cercospora Leaf Spot):** Small, circular to irregular spots on leaves, initially yellowish-green, turning brown or black with a purplish margin. Severe infection can lead to premature defoliation.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Sanitation:** Collect and destroy fallen infected leaves to reduce the primary source of inoculum.
    *   **Air Circulation:** Ensure proper plant spacing to improve air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce humidity and fungal growth.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Spray with a systemic or contact fungicide at the first sign of disease, especially during humid conditions.
    *   **Mancozeb** @ 2.0-2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Carbendazim** @ 1.0 g/L of water.
    *   **Hexaconazole** @ 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Propiconazole** @ 0.5 ml/L of water.
