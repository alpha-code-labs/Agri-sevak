As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified processes for Mulberry, keeping in mind the specific conditions and CIBRC approved inputs for Haryana, India.

### I. Seed Treatment for Mulberry

It is important to note that commercial mulberry cultivation primarily relies on vegetative propagation through cuttings, not seeds. Seed propagation is generally reserved for breeding programs or rootstock development.

**A. For Mulberry Seeds (if used for breeding or rootstock):**
To protect against seed-borne diseases and improve germination, the following fungicide treatment is recommended:
*   Treat seeds with **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 2-3 g per kg of seeds.
*   Alternatively, use **Thiram** 75% WS at 2.5 g per kg of seeds.
*   Mix the chemical thoroughly with the seeds just before sowing.

**B. For Mulberry Cuttings (the primary propagation method):**
Treating cuttings is crucial for successful establishment and root development.
*   **Rooting Hormone Treatment:** Dip the basal end (lower 2-3 cm) of the cuttings in a solution of Indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) at 1000-2000 ppm (1-2 g of IBA per litre of water) for 10-15 minutes. This promotes rapid and robust root formation.
*   **Fungicide Treatment (Optional but Recommended):** To prevent fungal infections at the cut ends, which can lead to rotting, dip the basal end of the cuttings in a solution of **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 1 g per litre of water for 10-15 minutes. This can be done either before or after the rooting hormone treatment, or as a combined dip if compatible.

### II. Soil Treatment Process for Mulberry

Effective soil treatment is vital for establishing a healthy mulberry plantation and ensuring long-term productivity.

**A. Pre-planting Soil Preparation:**
*   **Deep Ploughing:** Plough the field to a depth of 30-45 cm during summer to expose soil-borne pests and pathogens to sunlight and air, which helps in their desiccation and destruction.
*   **Solarization:** In areas with high incidence of soil-borne diseases or nematodes, moisten the soil and cover it with transparent polyethylene sheets (100-150 micron thickness) for 4-6 weeks during the hot summer months. This raises soil temperature, effectively killing many pathogens, nematodes, and weed seeds.
*   **Organic Matter Incorporation:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost at 20-30 tonnes per acre during land preparation. This improves soil structure, water retention, nutrient availability, and promotes beneficial microbial activity.

**B. Management of Soil-borne Pests (Nematodes):**
Mulberry is susceptible to various nematodes, which can significantly reduce yield.
*   **Bio-nematicides:** Apply **Paecilomyces lilacinus** (1% WP) at 2.5-5 kg per acre. Mix it with 100 kg of FYM or compost and broadcast evenly, then incorporate into the soil before planting. For established plantations, apply as a ring application around the plants and lightly incorporate.
*   **Chemical Nematicides (Use with caution and only if severe infestation is confirmed by soil testing):**
    *   **Carbofuran** 3% G at 10-15 kg per acre can be applied at the time of planting in the planting pit or as a ring application around established plants. Ensure proper safety measures and follow label instructions strictly.

**C. Management of Soil-borne Diseases (e.g., Root Rot, Wilt):**
*   **Bio-fungicides:** Apply **Trichoderma viride** (1% WP) at 2.5-5 kg per acre. Mix it with 100 kg of FYM or compost and broadcast evenly, then incorporate into the soil before planting. For established plants, apply as a drench or ring application.
*   **Chemical Fungicides (for severe cases or specific disease outbreaks):**
    *   For root rot or wilt, drench the soil around affected plants with **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 1-2 g per litre of water. Repeat if necessary, based on disease severity.
    *   For general soil drenching or pre-planting treatment in areas with known fungal issues, **Copper Oxychloride** 50% WP at 2-3 kg per acre can be mixed with soil or applied as a drench.

**D. Soil pH Correction:**
*   Mulberry thrives in slightly acidic to neutral soil (pH 6.2-6.8). Conduct a soil test to determine the pH.
*   If the soil is acidic (pH below 6.0), apply agricultural lime as per soil test recommendations to raise the pH.
*   If the soil is alkaline (pH above 7.5), apply gypsum or elemental sulphur as per soil test recommendations to lower the pH.

**Important Note:** Always conduct a soil test before planting and periodically thereafter to determine specific nutrient deficiencies, pH imbalances, and the presence of pests or pathogens. This allows for precise and targeted treatment recommendations.
