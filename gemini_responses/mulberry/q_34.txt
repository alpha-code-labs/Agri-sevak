Mulberry (Morus spp.) is highly sensitive to most weedicides/herbicides. The primary and most effective way to reduce harmful effects is to prevent any contact with the plants. Direct application of weedicides on Mulberry is generally not recommended and can cause severe damage or even plant death.

Here's how to reduce the harmful effects of weedicides/herbicides in Mulberry cultivation:

**I. Preventive Measures (Most Effective Strategy):**

1.  **Prioritize Non-Chemical Weed Control:**
    *   **Manual Weeding:** This is the safest and most recommended method for weed control in Mulberry plantations. Regular manual weeding keeps the area around the plants free of weeds without any chemical risk.
    *   **Mulching:** Applying organic mulch (e.g., straw, dried leaves, wood chips) around the base of Mulberry plants can effectively suppress weed growth, conserve soil moisture, and improve soil health.
    *   **Intercropping/Cover Cropping:** In wider row spacing, consider suitable non-competitive cover crops that can suppress weeds without harming Mulberry, provided they don't compete for nutrients or water.

2.  **Strict Avoidance of Direct Herbicide Application:**
    *   **Do NOT apply any weedicide directly on Mulberry plants or in their root zone.** Mulberry is a broadleaf plant and is susceptible to damage from most broad-spectrum and even some selective herbicides.

3.  **Extreme Caution for Herbicide Use in Adjacent Areas:**
    *   If herbicides must be used in non-mulberry areas adjacent to the plantation (e.g., field boundaries, pathways), exercise extreme caution to prevent drift or runoff.
    *   **Physical Barriers:** Use physical shields (e.g., cardboard, plastic sheets) to protect Mulberry plants during herbicide application in nearby areas.
    *   **Low-Drift Nozzles:** Use spray nozzles designed to produce larger droplets, which are less prone to drift.
    *   **Appropriate Weather Conditions:** Apply herbicides only on calm days with minimal wind (wind speed less than 8 km/h) to prevent spray drift. Avoid application during temperature inversions.
    *   **Low Pressure Application:** Use the lowest effective spray pressure to minimize fine droplet formation.
    *   **Avoid Volatile Herbicides:** Do not use highly volatile herbicides (e.g., certain ester formulations of **2,4-D**) near Mulberry, as their vapours can drift and cause damage.
    *   **Consider Soil Residual Activity:** Be aware of herbicides with long soil residual activity if used in adjacent areas, as they might leach into the Mulberry root zone.

4.  **Thorough Equipment Cleaning:**
    *   Always clean spray equipment thoroughly with appropriate cleaning agents and rinse multiple times with clean water after using herbicides, especially before using the same equipment for applying other chemicals (e.g., foliar nutrients, insecticides) on Mulberry. Even trace amounts of herbicide residue can cause damage.

**II. Mitigation Measures (If Accidental Exposure Occurs):**

If Mulberry plants are accidentally exposed to weedicides, immediate action can help reduce the damage:

1.  **Immediate Washing (for Contact Herbicides):**
    *   If the herbicide is a contact type (e.g., **Paraquat dichloride**) and exposure is recent (within a few hours), immediately wash the affected foliage thoroughly with large volumes of plain water to remove the chemical.

2.  **Pruning Affected Parts:**
    *   For localized damage, carefully prune and remove the severely affected leaves, shoots, or branches. This can help prevent the spread of systemic herbicides and allow the plant to recover. Dispose of the pruned material safely.

3.  **Supportive Care:**
    *   **Watering:** Ensure the plants receive adequate water, especially if the soil is dry. This can help dilute any soil-applied herbicide and reduce plant stress.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Provide a balanced nutrient supply through soil application or foliar sprays of micronutrients (e.g., zinc, iron, manganese) to help the plant recover from stress. Avoid excessive nitrogen application, which can further stress damaged plants.

4.  **Soil Flushing/Amendment (for Soil Contamination):**
    *   If soil contamination with a persistent herbicide is suspected, heavy irrigation can sometimes help leach the chemical below the root zone.
    *   In severe, localized cases, applying activated charcoal to the contaminated soil can help adsorb and deactivate certain herbicides, but this is generally not practical for large areas.

5.  **Monitoring:**
    *   Continuously monitor the affected plants for signs of recovery or worsening symptoms. This helps in deciding further interventions.

**III. Herbicides to be Extremely Cautious About (Due to High Risk to Mulberry):**

Mulberry is highly susceptible to damage from non-selective herbicides and many broadleaf selective herbicides. Examples of CIBRC approved technical chemicals that are highly detrimental to Mulberry if they come into contact include:

*   **Glyphosate** (N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine) - A non-selective, systemic herbicide.
*   **Paraquat dichloride** (1,1'-dimethyl-4,4'-bipyridinium dichloride) - A non-selective, contact herbicide.
*   **2,4-D sodium salt** (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid sodium salt) - A selective broadleaf herbicide, but highly damaging to Mulberry.

In summary, the best approach is to avoid herbicide use in Mulberry plantations altogether and rely on manual or mechanical weed control methods. If herbicides must be used in adjacent areas, extreme caution and preventive measures are paramount to protect the sensitive Mulberry plants.
