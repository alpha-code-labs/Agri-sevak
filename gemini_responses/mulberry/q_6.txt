As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I advise that viral diseases in Mulberry are challenging to manage once established, as there are no direct chemical cures for the viruses themselves. Therefore, management strategies primarily focus on prevention, control of insect vectors, and cultural practices.

Here's how to control viral diseases like Leaf curl, Mosaic, and Yellow vein clearing in Mulberry:

**1. For Viral Diseases Known to Affect Mulberry (Leaf curl, Mosaic, Yellow vein clearing):**

These diseases are caused by specific viruses (e.g., Mulberry Leaf Curl Virus, Mulberry Mosaic Virus, Mulberry Yellow Vein Clearing Virus) and can significantly impact leaf quality and yield.

*   **Symptoms:**
    *   **Leaf curl:** Downward or upward curling of leaves, thickening, puckering, and vein clearing. Stunted plant growth.
    *   **Mosaic:** Irregular patches of light green or yellow on the leaves, often forming a mosaic pattern.
    *   **Yellow vein clearing:** Yellowing of veins, which may extend to the interveinal areas, leading to overall yellowing and reduced leaf size.

*   **Management Strategies:**

    *   **Cultural Practices:**
        *   **Use Disease-Free Planting Material:** Always source cuttings or saplings from healthy, certified disease-free mother plants. This is the most critical preventive measure.
        *   **Rogueing of Infected Plants:** Regularly inspect your mulberry garden. As soon as symptoms of viral infection are observed, immediately uproot and destroy (burn or deep bury) the infected plants to prevent the spread of the virus to healthy plants.
        *   **Weed Management:** Keep the mulberry garden and surrounding areas free of weeds, as many weeds can act as alternate hosts for viruses or their insect vectors.
        *   **Pruning and Sanitation:** If only a few branches show localized symptoms, prune them immediately. Always sterilize pruning tools (e.g., with 1% sodium hypochlorite solution or 70% alcohol) before and after pruning each plant to avoid mechanical transmission of viruses.
        *   **Nutrient and Water Management:** Maintain optimal soil fertility and provide adequate irrigation to ensure vigorous plant growth, which can help plants tolerate stress and potentially reduce symptom severity.

    *   **Vector Control (Crucial for preventing spread, especially for Leaf Curl transmitted by whiteflies):**
        Many mulberry viruses are transmitted by insect vectors like whiteflies, aphids, or thrips. Controlling these vectors is vital to prevent the spread of the disease.
        *   **Monitoring:** Regularly monitor your mulberry plants for the presence of insect vectors.
        *   **Chemical Control:** Apply CIBRC approved insecticides when vector populations reach damaging levels. Ensure thorough coverage. Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
            *   For Whiteflies (common vector for Leaf Curl):
                *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water.
                *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: 0.2-0.4 g/L of water.
                *   **Buprofezin** 25% SC: 1.25 ml/L of water.
            *   For Aphids:
                *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water.
                *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: 0.2-0.4 g/L of water.
        *   **Biological Control:** Encourage natural enemies of insect vectors (e.g., ladybugs, lacewings).

    *   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available and suitable for Haryana conditions, choose mulberry varieties known to possess tolerance or resistance to common viral diseases.

**2. For Diseases Not Known to Affect Mulberry:**

*   **Stripe:** This is not known to affect Mulberry.
*   **Tristeza:** This is not known to affect Mulberry. (Tristeza is primarily a citrus virus).
*   **Stunt virus:** This is not known to affect Mulberry as a specific viral disease. However, general 'stunting' symptoms can be caused by various factors including other pathogens like phytoplasmas (e.g., Mulberry Dwarf Phytoplasma) or nutrient deficiencies. Management for phytoplasma-induced stunt would involve similar cultural practices and vector control (leafhoppers) as for viral diseases.
