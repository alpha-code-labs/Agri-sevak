As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling soil pests like termites and root-knot nematodes in Mulberry cultivation in Haryana.

It is crucial to adopt an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods for sustainable control.

### **1. Control of Termites (e.g., *Odontotermes obesus*, *Microtermes obesi*)**

Termites can cause significant damage by feeding on the roots and the base of the stem, leading to wilting, stunted growth, and even death of young Mulberry plants.

**A. Cultural and Preventive Measures:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove all dead wood, stumps, and crop residues from the field before planting, as these can serve as breeding grounds for termites.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** Expose termite colonies to sunlight and predators by deep ploughing the field during summer.
*   **Proper Irrigation:** Avoid water stress in plants, as stressed plants are more susceptible to termite attack. Ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging.
*   **Organic Matter:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost, as fresh organic matter can attract termites.

**B. Chemical Control (as per CIBRC approval):**
For severe infestations, chemical control may be necessary.
*   **Soil Treatment at Planting:**
    *   Drench the planting pits or furrows with **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** at a rate of 2.5-5 ml per litre of water.
*   **For Existing Plantations:**
    *   Apply **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** as a soil drench around the base of affected plants at a rate of 2.5-5 ml per litre of water, ensuring the solution penetrates the root zone.
    *   Alternatively, broadcast **Fipronil 0.3% GR** granules at a rate of 10-15 kg per acre and incorporate into the soil, followed by light irrigation.

### **2. Control of Nematodes (Root-knot Nematodes - *Meloidogyne spp.*)**

Root-knot nematodes are microscopic worms that infect Mulberry roots, causing characteristic galls or knots. This impairs the plant's ability to absorb water and nutrients, leading to stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, reduced leaf yield, and overall poor plant health.

**A. Cultural and Preventive Measures:**
*   **Solarization:** For nursery beds, cover the moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks during hot summer months to kill nematodes.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** If available and suitable for Haryana conditions, use Mulberry varieties known to have resistance or tolerance to root-knot nematodes.
*   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporate large quantities of organic matter like well-decomposed FYM, compost, or **Neem cake** (200-400 kg per acre) into the soil. Neem cake has nematicidal properties and promotes beneficial soil microbes.
*   **Crop Rotation:** While difficult in perennial Mulberry, in fallow land or before establishing a new plantation, grow non-host crops like marigold (Tagetes spp.) which can act as a trap crop or have nematicidal properties.

**B. Biological Control (as per CIBRC approval):**
Biological nematicides are an eco-friendly and sustainable option.
*   **Bio-nematicides:** Apply formulations containing the fungus **Purpureocillium lilacinum** (formerly *Paecilomyces lilacinus*) or bacteria like *Bacillus subtilis*.
    *   **Purpureocillium lilacinum:** Apply at a rate of 2.5-5 kg per acre (for powder formulations) or 5-10 ml per litre of water (for liquid formulations) as a soil drench or mix with FYM and apply around the root zone.

**C. Chemical Control (as per CIBRC approval):**
Chemical nematicides should be used judiciously and as a last resort, especially considering their potential environmental impact and toxicity.
*   **Granular Nematicides:**
    *   Apply **Carbofuran 3% G** at a rate of 10-30 kg per acre. Apply granules uniformly around the base of the plants and lightly incorporate into the soil, followed by irrigation.
    *   **Note:** Carbofuran is a highly toxic pesticide. Use it with extreme care, strictly follow label instructions, wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), and observe pre-harvest intervals.

**General Advice:**
*   Always confirm the pest identity before applying any control measure.
*   Follow the recommended dosages and application methods strictly.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) while handling and applying chemicals.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions.
