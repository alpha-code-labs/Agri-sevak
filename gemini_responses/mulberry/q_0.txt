As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an integrated approach for managing fungal diseases in Mulberry, combining cultural practices with judicious use of CIBRC-approved fungicides.

Here's a detailed guide for controlling the specified fungal diseases in Mulberry:

### General Cultural Practices for Fungal Disease Management:

These practices are crucial for preventing and reducing the severity of most fungal diseases:

*   **Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy fallen leaves, infected twigs, and other plant debris from the mulberry garden. This reduces the inoculum source for future infections.
*   **Pruning:** Prune mulberry plants regularly to improve air circulation within the canopy and remove any diseased or overcrowded branches. This helps in drying leaf surfaces quickly, making them less conducive for fungal growth.
*   **Plant Spacing:** Maintain optimal plant spacing to ensure good air movement and reduce humidity around the plants.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced fertilization. Avoid excessive nitrogen application, which can lead to lush, succulent growth more susceptible to fungal attacks.
*   **Irrigation Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day, as wet foliage for prolonged periods favors fungal development. Drip irrigation or furrow irrigation is preferable.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available and suitable for local conditions in Haryana, consider planting mulberry varieties known for their resistance or tolerance to common fungal diseases.

### Specific Control Measures for Fungal Diseases in Mulberry:

#### 1. Alternaria Leaf Spot (Caused by *Alternaria alternata*)

*   **Symptoms:** Small, circular to irregular spots on leaves, often with concentric rings, turning dark brown to black.
*   **Cultural Control:** Implement general sanitation and pruning practices.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Spray with **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, use **Chlorothalonil** at 2 g/L of water.
    *   For systemic action, **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5 ml/L of water can be effective.

#### 2. Anthracnose (Caused by *Colletotrichum gloeosporioides*)

*   **Symptoms:** Irregular, sunken spots on leaves, stems, and fruits, often with dark margins and pinkish spore masses in humid conditions. Can cause defoliation and twig dieback.
*   **Cultural Control:** Remove and destroy infected plant parts. Prune to improve air circulation.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Spray with **Carbendazim** at 1 g/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water can be used as a protective spray.
    *   **Propiconazole** at 0.5 ml/L of water provides systemic control.

#### 3. Blast

*   This is not known to affect Mulberry.

#### 4. Blight (General Leaf Blight/Spot, e.g., *Cercospora*, *Phyllosticta*)

*   **Symptoms:** A general term for rapid browning, wilting, and death of plant tissues, often starting from leaf margins or tips. Can be caused by various fungi.
*   **Cultural Control:** Maintain good field sanitation, proper spacing, and balanced nutrition.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Spray with **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Chlorothalonil** at 2 g/L of water is also effective.
    *   For severe cases, **Copper Oxychloride** at 3 g/L of water can be used.

#### 5. Brown Spot (Caused by *Cercospora moricola*, *Phyllosticta moricola*)

*   **Symptoms:** Circular to irregular brown spots on leaves, often with a distinct margin. Severe infection can lead to defoliation.
*   **Cultural Control:** Follow general sanitation practices and ensure proper plant spacing.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Spray with **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Carbendazim** at 1 g/L of water can also be used.

#### 6. Downy Mildew (Caused by *Peronospora mori*)

*   **Symptoms:** Yellowish, angular spots on the upper surface of leaves, with a grayish-white, downy growth on the corresponding lower surface.
*   **Cultural Control:** Improve air circulation, avoid overhead irrigation, and remove infected leaves promptly.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Spray with **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water as a protective measure.
    *   For curative and protective action, a combination product of **Metalaxyl + Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water is highly effective.
    *   **Propamocarb Hydrochloride** at 2 ml/L of water can also be used.

#### 7. Powdery Mildew / Grey Mildew (Caused by *Phyllactinia moricola*)

*   **Symptoms:** White, powdery patches on the upper surface of leaves, which can later turn grayish. Severe infection leads to leaf distortion, yellowing, and premature defoliation.
*   **Cultural Control:** Prune to improve air circulation. Remove and destroy severely infected leaves.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Spray with **Wettable Sulphur** at 2-3 g/L of water. Ensure good coverage.
    *   **Hexaconazole** at 0.5 ml/L of water provides systemic control.
    *   **Myclobutanil** at 0.5 ml/L of water is another effective systemic option.
    *   **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5 ml/L of water can also be used.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Timing of Application:** Apply fungicides preventively or at the first sign of disease symptoms.
*   **Rotation of Fungicides:** To prevent the development of fungicide resistance, rotate fungicides with different modes of action.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough coverage of all plant parts, especially the undersides of leaves.
*   **Safety:** Always read and follow the instructions on the fungicide label, including recommended dosage, safety precautions, and pre-harvest intervals. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during application.
