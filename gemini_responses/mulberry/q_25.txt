As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice on irrigation management for Mulberry cultivation in Haryana:

Mulberry (Morus spp.) is a moderately water-intensive crop, especially during its active growth phases for leaf production. Efficient irrigation management is crucial for maximizing leaf yield and quality, which directly impacts sericulture.

### General Principles of Mulberry Irrigation:

*   **Soil Moisture Assessment:** The primary indicator for irrigation should be the soil moisture status. Feel and appearance method, or using tensiometers, can guide decisions.
*   **Avoid Waterlogging:** Mulberry is sensitive to waterlogging, which can lead to root rot and reduced growth. Ensure good drainage.
*   **Critical Stages:** Water requirement is highest during active vegetative growth, post-pruning, and during dry spells.

### First Irrigation:

The timing and amount of the first irrigation depend on whether it's a newly planted garden or an established one after pruning.

*   **For Newly Planted Mulberry Garden (Saplings/Cuttings):**
    *   **Timing:** Immediately after planting saplings or cuttings. This is critical for establishment and root development.
    *   **Amount:** A light to moderate irrigation to settle the soil around the roots and provide initial moisture. Ensure the root zone is adequately wet but avoid saturation.
    *   **Purpose:** Facilitates root establishment, reduces transplant shock, and promotes initial sprouting.

*   **For Established Mulberry Garden (After Pruning):**
    *   **Timing:** Within 2-3 days after severe pruning (bottom pruning or middle pruning). This helps in the rapid sprouting of new shoots.
    *   **Amount:** A thorough irrigation to moisten the entire root zone.
    *   **Purpose:** Supports vigorous shoot emergence and rapid leaf development for the subsequent harvest.

### Second Irrigation:

*   **For Newly Planted Mulberry Garden:**
    *   **Timing:** Typically 7-10 days after the first irrigation, depending on soil type and prevailing weather conditions. In sandy soils, it might be sooner; in heavier soils, it might be slightly later.
    *   **Amount:** Similar to the first irrigation, ensuring consistent moisture for continued root growth and initial leaf development.
    *   **Purpose:** Sustains the growth of young plants and helps them establish a strong root system.

*   **For Established Mulberry Garden:**
    *   **Timing:** Generally 10-15 days after the first irrigation (post-pruning), or when the top 15-20 cm of soil starts to dry out. Observe the plant for signs of wilting, especially during midday.
    *   **Amount:** A moderate irrigation to maintain optimal soil moisture for continuous vegetative growth.
    *   **Purpose:** Supports the rapid expansion of leaves and shoots, which are crucial for silkworm rearing.

### Subsequent Irrigations:

*   **Frequency:** During dry periods, especially from March to June and September to November in Haryana, irrigation may be required every 15-20 days for established gardens. During the monsoon season, irrigation frequency should be reduced or stopped depending on rainfall.
*   **Amount:** Apply 50-75 mm of water per irrigation, ensuring the root zone is adequately moistened.

### Sprinkler Use in Mulberry:

Sprinkler irrigation, particularly micro-sprinklers or mini-sprinklers, can be an efficient method for Mulberry, especially in areas with water scarcity or undulating terrain.

*   **Advantages:**
    *   **Water Use Efficiency:** Can save 20-30% water compared to flood irrigation.
    *   **Uniform Application:** Distributes water evenly across the field.
    *   **Fertigation Potential:** Allows for the application of water-soluble fertilizers along with irrigation water, improving nutrient uptake.
    *   **Suitable for Undulating Terrain:** Can be used effectively where flood irrigation is difficult.
    *   **Soil Conservation:** Reduces soil erosion.

*   **Disadvantages:**
    *   **Initial Cost:** Higher initial investment compared to traditional flood irrigation.
    *   **Wind Drift:** Water distribution can be affected by strong winds.
    *   **Leaf Wetness:** Prolonged leaf wetness can increase the risk of certain fungal diseases (e.g., powdery mildew, leaf spot), especially if irrigation is done late in the day.
    *   **Evaporation Losses:** Some water can be lost to evaporation, especially during hot, windy conditions.

*   **Recommendations for Sprinkler Use:**
    *   **Type:** Micro-sprinklers or mini-sprinklers are generally preferred over large impact sprinklers for Mulberry due to their finer spray and lower application rates, which are less likely to damage tender leaves.
    *   **Timing:** Irrigate during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize evaporation losses and allow leaves to dry before nightfall, reducing disease risk.
    *   **Duration:** Adjust the duration of irrigation based on the soil type, sprinkler discharge rate, and desired depth of water penetration. Aim to moisten the effective root zone (typically 60-90 cm for mature Mulberry).
    *   **Pressure:** Maintain optimal operating pressure for the chosen sprinkler system to ensure uniform water distribution.

By adopting these irrigation management practices, Mulberry growers in Haryana can ensure healthy plant growth, maximize leaf yield, and contribute to a thriving sericulture industry.
