As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling sucking pests in Apricot orchards in Haryana.

Sucking pests like Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, Thrips, and Psylla can cause significant damage to Apricot trees by feeding on sap, leading to stunted growth, leaf curling, premature defoliation, reduced fruit quality, and transmission of viral diseases. Effective management requires an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategy for Sucking Pests in Apricot:**

1.  **Regular Monitoring:**
    *   Inspect Apricot trees regularly, especially new flushes, undersides of leaves, and flower buds, for the presence of pests or symptoms of damage. Early detection is crucial for effective control.
    *   Use yellow sticky traps to monitor populations of whiteflies, thrips, and leafhoppers.

2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the orchard floor free of weeds, as many weeds act as alternate hosts for these pests.
    *   **Proper Nutrition:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush, succulent growth that is highly attractive to sucking pests.
    *   **Pruning:** Ensure proper pruning to improve air circulation within the canopy, which can make the environment less favorable for some pests. Remove heavily infested branches if feasible.
    *   **Water Management:** Maintain optimal soil moisture to reduce plant stress, making trees more resilient to pest attacks.

3.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Encourage natural enemies such as ladybird beetles, lacewings, hoverfly larvae, and parasitic wasps, which prey on aphids, whiteflies, and other sucking pests. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

4.  **Chemical Control (When necessary):**
    When pest populations reach damaging levels and cultural/biological methods are insufficient, judicious use of CIBRC-approved insecticides is recommended. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

    **Recommended Insecticides for Sucking Pests in Apricot:**

    *   **For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, Thrips, and Psylla:**
        *   **Imidacloprid** (17.8% SL): Apply at a concentration of 0.5 - 0.75 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Thiamethoxam** (25% WG): Apply at a concentration of 0.2 - 0.3 g per litre of water.
        *   **Acetamiprid** (20% SP): Apply at a concentration of 0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water.
        *   **Flonicamid** (50% WG): Particularly effective against aphids and whiteflies. Apply at a concentration of 0.3 g per litre of water.
        *   **Spiromesifen** (22.9% SC): Effective against whiteflies, mites, and thrips. Apply at a concentration of 0.5 - 0.75 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Diafenthiuron** (50% WP): Effective against whiteflies, thrips, and mites. Apply at a concentration of 1.0 g per litre of water.
        *   **Spirotetramat** (150 OD): A systemic insecticide effective against a broad range of sucking pests including aphids, whiteflies, and mealybugs. Apply at a concentration of 0.75 - 1.0 ml per litre of water.

    **Application Guidelines:**
    *   Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage, especially the undersides of leaves where many sucking pests reside.
    *   Apply insecticides during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
    *   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label for specific dosage, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
    *   Rotate insecticides with different chemical groups to prevent the development of pest resistance. For example, do not use Imidacloprid and Thiamethoxam consecutively as they belong to the same neonicotinoid group.
