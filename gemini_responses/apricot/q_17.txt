Here are the recommended doses of organic manures and bio-stimulants for Apricot (Prunus armeniaca) in Haryana:

*   **Farm Yard Manure (FYM):**
    *   **Young trees (1-3 years):** 10-20 kg per plant annually.
    *   **Bearing trees (4 years and above):** 25-50 kg per plant annually.
    *   *Application:* Apply during late autumn or early winter, spread evenly around the tree basin, and lightly incorporate into the soil.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   **Young trees (1-3 years):** 3-5 kg per plant annually.
    *   **Bearing trees (4 years and above):** 5-10 kg per plant annually.
    *   *Application:* Can be applied as a partial replacement for FYM (e.g., 1 kg vermicompost can replace approximately 5 kg FYM) or as a supplement. Apply similarly to FYM.

*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract based bio-stimulant):**
    *   This is a bio-stimulant, not a bulk organic manure. It enhances nutrient uptake, promotes root growth, and improves overall plant vigor.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** 2.5-3.0 ml per litre of water. Apply at critical growth stages such as pre-flowering, fruit set, and fruit development.
    *   **Soil Drench/Drip Application:** 1.0-2.0 litres per acre, diluted in sufficient water. Apply during active growth periods.
    *   *Application:* Typically 2-3 applications per season are beneficial.
