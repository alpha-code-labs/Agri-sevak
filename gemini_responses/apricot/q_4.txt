Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I understand your concern regarding Wilt and Parawilt in Apricot. These are serious issues that can significantly impact orchard health and productivity. Wilt in Apricot is primarily caused by soil-borne fungi like *Verticillium dahliae* (Verticillium wilt) and *Fusarium oxysporum* (Fusarium wilt). Parawilt is often a complex decline syndrome, sometimes associated with root damage, water stress, nutrient imbalances, and secondary infections, leading to sudden wilting and death.

Effective management requires an integrated approach, combining cultural practices, biological methods, and judicious chemical applications.

Here's a comprehensive strategy to control Wilt and Parawilt in Apricot:

**I. Cultural and Horticultural Practices (Foundation of Wilt Management):**

1.  **Resistant Rootstocks:** This is the most crucial long-term solution. Whenever possible, use rootstocks known for resistance or tolerance to Verticillium and Fusarium wilts. Consult with nursery providers for locally adapted and resistant rootstock options suitable for Haryana's conditions.
2.  **Site Selection and Soil Preparation:**
    *   Avoid planting Apricot in fields previously cultivated with susceptible crops like cotton, brinjal, tomato, potato, or other stone fruits that have shown wilt symptoms.
    *   Ensure good soil drainage. Amend heavy clay soils with organic matter (farmyard manure, compost) to improve aeration and drainage, as waterlogging exacerbates wilt diseases.
    *   Maintain a soil pH between 6.0-7.0, which is optimal for Apricot and can reduce stress.
3.  **Water Management:**
    *   Avoid both water stress (drought) and over-irrigation/waterlogging. Both conditions stress the tree and make it more susceptible to wilt pathogens.
    *   Use drip irrigation to deliver water directly to the root zone efficiently and avoid wetting the trunk base.
4.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Provide balanced nutrition based on soil test reports. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can promote lush, susceptible growth.
    *   Ensure adequate levels of potassium and micronutrients, which contribute to overall tree vigor and disease resistance.
5.  **Sanitation:**
    *   Promptly remove and destroy (burn or deep bury) any infected plant parts or entire trees showing severe wilt symptoms to prevent the spread of pathogens.
    *   Disinfect pruning tools with a 10% bleach solution or methylated spirit between trees, especially when working with diseased trees.
6.  **Weed Control:** Keep the orchard floor free of weeds, as some weeds can act as alternate hosts for wilt pathogens.
7.  **Pruning:** Practice proper pruning techniques to maintain tree health and vigor. Avoid excessive pruning that can stress the tree.
8.  **Soil Solarization:** In areas where new planting is planned and wilt has been a problem, soil solarization during the hot summer months (May-June) for 4-6 weeks can significantly reduce soil-borne pathogen inoculum.

**II. Biological Control:**

These beneficial microorganisms can suppress wilt pathogens and promote plant growth.

*   **For Soil Application (Pre-plant or as Drench):**
    *   **Trichoderma viride** (2.5 kg/acre mixed with 50 kg farmyard manure or compost, applied to the soil before planting or as a drench around existing trees).
    *   **Pseudomonas fluorescens** (2.5 kg/acre mixed with 50 kg farmyard manure or compost, applied to the soil before planting or as a drench around existing trees).

**III. Chemical Control (As a Preventive or Early Stage Measure):**

Chemical control for established wilt in mature trees is often challenging, as the pathogens are systemic. However, fungicides can be used as preventive measures or at the very early stages of infection, primarily as soil drench applications.

*   **For Soil Drenching (at the first sign of symptoms or as a preventive measure in susceptible areas):**
    *   **Carbendazim** (1-2 g/L of water, apply 5-10 L solution per tree depending on tree size, drenching the root zone).
    *   **Thiophanate-methyl** (1-2 g/L of water, apply 5-10 L solution per tree depending on tree size, drenching the root zone).

**Specific Considerations for Parawilt:**

Since Parawilt is often a complex decline, the emphasis should be on maintaining overall tree health and minimizing stress factors. All the cultural practices mentioned above are critical for preventing and managing Parawilt. Ensure:
*   Optimal irrigation and drainage.
*   Balanced nutrition.
*   Protection from root damage (e.g., during cultivation).
*   Management of any other pests or diseases that might weaken the tree.

It is always advisable to consult with the local agricultural extension specialist or HAU experts for a precise diagnosis and tailored recommendations based on the specific conditions of your orchard.
