As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified recommendations for the use of growth regulators and micronutrients in Apricot cultivation in Haryana.

It is crucial to understand the specific role of each substance and apply them judiciously, adhering to recommended concentrations and timings to achieve desired results without adverse effects. Always ensure thorough coverage during application and follow safety guidelines.

### 1. Ethephon (Ethrel)

Ethephon is a plant growth regulator that releases ethylene, influencing various physiological processes such as fruit ripening, thinning, and defoliation.

*   **For Fruit Thinning:**
    *   **Dose:** **Ethephon** 75-100 mg/L (ppm)
    *   **Timing:** Apply 7-14 days after full bloom, when fruitlets are 10-15 mm in diameter. This helps in reducing fruit load, leading to larger and better-quality fruits.
*   **For Hastening Fruit Ripening and Colour Development:**
    *   **Dose:** **Ethephon** 100-200 mg/L (ppm)
    *   **Timing:** Apply 7-10 days before the anticipated harvest date, when fruits begin to show signs of colour break. This can help in uniform ripening and improved marketability.

### 2. 2,4-D

2,4-D (2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) is primarily known as a selective herbicide. While some auxins are used as growth regulators for fruit drop control in certain fruit crops, **2,4-D is generally not recommended as a growth regulator for Apricot.** Its use at concentrations effective for growth regulation can often lead to phytotoxicity (plant injury) in Apricot, and there are no widely accepted or recommended practices for its application as a growth regulator in this crop.

### 3. Boron

Boron is an essential micronutrient, not a growth regulator or hormone. It plays a critical role in pollen germination, fruit set, cell wall formation, and sugar transport. Boron deficiency can lead to poor fruit set, deformed fruits, and reduced yield.

*   **For Foliar Application (most common and effective for quick uptake):**
    *   **Dose:** **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (e.g., Solubor, containing 20.5% Boron) at 1-2 g/L of water (0.1-0.2% solution) OR **Borax** (containing 10.5% Boron) at 2-4 g/L of water (0.2-0.4% solution).
    *   **Timing:**
        *   First spray: At the pre-bloom stage (pink bud stage), just before flowers open.
        *   Second spray: After fruit set, when fruitlets are small.
    *   **Note:** Foliar application is particularly effective in correcting deficiencies and ensuring adequate boron supply during critical reproductive stages.
*   **For Soil Application (if severe deficiency is confirmed by soil test):**
    *   **Dose:** **Borax** 10-20 kg/acre, depending on soil test results and severity of deficiency.
    *   **Timing:** Apply before planting or during dormant season, broadcast evenly and incorporate into the soil.
    *   **Note:** Soil application should only be done after a soil test confirms boron deficiency, as excessive boron can be toxic to plants.

**General Advice:**
*   Always conduct a small-scale trial before widespread application to observe the plant's response.
*   Ensure proper calibration of spray equipment for accurate dose application.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension specialists for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and soil test reports.
