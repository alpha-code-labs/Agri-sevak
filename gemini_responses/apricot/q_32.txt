Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding the "drying up" of Apricot plants, which manifests as drying branches, leaves, fruits, and flowers. This is a general symptom that can be caused by various biotic (diseases, pests) and abiotic (environmental) factors. A precise diagnosis is crucial for effective management.

Here's a comprehensive approach to address this issue:

**I. Initial Steps for Diagnosis:**

Before applying any treatment, it is essential to identify the root cause. Observe the following:
*   **Pattern of Drying:** Is it affecting a single branch, multiple branches, the entire tree, or specific parts like new growth or older wood?
*   **Associated Symptoms:** Look for cankers (sunken lesions on bark), gum exudation, discolouration of wood under the bark, holes in branches, insect frass, root damage, or unusual leaf spots.
*   **Environmental Conditions:** Recent changes in irrigation, extreme weather (frost, heatwave), soil conditions (waterlogging, drought), or nutrient application.

**II. Potential Causes and Management Strategies:**

Based on common issues observed in Apricot cultivation in Haryana, here are the likely causes and their recommended management:

**A. Biotic Factors (Diseases and Pests):**

1.  **Fungal Dieback/Canker Diseases (e.g., *Botryosphaeria*, *Phytophthora* species causing root rot, *Fusarium* wilt):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Wilting and drying of leaves and branches, often starting from the tip or one side of the tree. Cankers (sunken, discoloured areas) may form on branches or the trunk, sometimes with gumming. Wood under the bark may show brown streaks. Root rot causes general decline, yellowing, and wilting of the entire tree.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Pruning:** Immediately prune out all affected branches well into the healthy wood (at least 15-20 cm below the visible symptom). Disinfect pruning tools with a 10% bleach solution or methylated spirit between cuts to prevent spread.
        *   **Sanitation:** Collect and burn or bury all pruned material.
        *   **Fungicide Application:**
            *   For cankers/dieback: Apply a paste of **Copper oxychloride** (500 g) in 1 litre of linseed oil to the cut ends and canker wounds.
            *   For systemic protection against dieback: Spray the tree with **Carbendazim** at 1 g/L of water or **Thiophanate-methyl** at 1 g/L of water, ensuring thorough coverage. Repeat after 15-20 days if symptoms persist.
            *   For suspected root rot (*Phytophthora*): Improve drainage. Drench the soil around the base of the affected trees with **Propamocarb hydrochloride** at 2.5 ml/L of water or **Fosetyl-aluminium** at 2.5 g/L of water.

2.  **Bacterial Canker (*Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae*):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Sunken, dark cankers on branches and trunk, often exuding gum, especially in spring. Twig dieback, leaf spots, and drying of flowers and young fruits.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Pruning:** Prune out affected branches during dry periods (summer) to minimize bacterial spread. Disinfect tools.
        *   **Wound Protection:** Apply a paste of **Copper oxychloride** (500 g) in 1 litre of linseed oil to pruning wounds.
        *   **Bactericide Spray:** In severe cases, spray with a combination of **Streptomycin sulphate + Tetracycline hydrochloride** (90:10 SP) at 0.5 g/L of water, or **Copper oxychloride** at 3 g/L of water, especially before leaf fall and at bud break.

3.  **Stem Borers (e.g., Apricot Stem Borer, Bark Borer):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Wilting and drying of individual branches or the entire tree above the point of attack. Presence of bore holes on the trunk or branches, often with frass (sawdust-like material) or gum exudation.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Mechanical Removal:** Locate the bore holes. Insert a wire to kill the larva inside.
        *   **Chemical Injection/Swabbing:**
            *   Inject **Chlorpyrifos** at 2.5 ml/L of water into the bore holes using a syringe and plug the holes with mud.
            *   Alternatively, swab the affected trunk/branches with a solution of **Chlorpyrifos** at 5 ml/L of water.

**B. Abiotic Factors (Environmental and Cultural):**

1.  **Water Stress (Drought or Waterlogging):**
    *   **Symptoms:**
        *   **Drought:** Gradual wilting, yellowing, and drying of leaves and branches, starting from the canopy edges.
        *   **Waterlogging:** Sudden wilting, yellowing, and drying of leaves, often accompanied by root rot due to lack of oxygen.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Drought:** Provide regular, adequate irrigation, especially during critical growth stages (flowering, fruit development) and dry spells. Use mulching to conserve soil moisture.
        *   **Waterlogging:** Ensure proper drainage in the orchard. Avoid planting in low-lying areas prone to water accumulation. Improve soil structure with organic matter.

2.  **Nutrient Deficiencies:**
    *   **Symptoms:** General decline, poor growth, yellowing, and premature drying of leaves. Specific deficiencies (e.g., Boron, Zinc) can cause twig dieback.
    *   **Management:** Conduct a soil and leaf tissue analysis to identify specific deficiencies. Apply balanced fertilizers based on recommendations. For general health, ensure adequate supply of macro and micronutrients.

3.  **Root Damage:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Sudden wilting and drying of the entire tree or major branches. Can be caused by mechanical injury during cultivation, rodent damage, or nematode infestation.
    *   **Management:** Avoid deep cultivation near the tree base. Protect roots from rodents. For nematodes, soil solarization or application of appropriate nematicides (consult HAU experts for specific recommendations if nematodes are confirmed).

4.  **Extreme Temperatures:**
    *   **Symptoms:**
        *   **Frost Damage:** Blackening and drying of young shoots, flowers, and fruits, especially in spring.
        *   **Heat Stress/Sunburn:** Scorching and drying of leaves and bark on exposed sides, leading to cankers.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Frost:** Use overhead irrigation during frost events, cover young trees, or apply smoke screens.
        *   **Heat/Sunburn:** Provide adequate irrigation, use whitewash on trunks, or plant windbreaks.

5.  **Salinity/Alkalinity:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Leaf tip burn, marginal necrosis, stunted growth, and overall decline leading to drying.
    *   **Management:** Improve soil drainage, leach salts with good quality water, apply gypsum or other soil amendments as per soil test recommendations.

**III. General Cultural Practices for Prevention:**

*   **Orchard Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy fallen leaves, fruits, and diseased branches.
*   **Proper Pruning:** Prune annually to maintain tree vigour and open canopy for air circulation. Always prune during dry weather.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide a balanced fertilizer regime based on soil testing.
*   **Adequate Irrigation:** Ensure consistent and appropriate watering, avoiding both drought and waterlogging.
*   **Weed Control:** Keep the area around the trees free of weeds to reduce competition for nutrients and water, and to improve air circulation.
*   **Regular Monitoring:** Inspect your trees regularly for any early signs of disease or pest infestation.

**Conclusion:**

Given the varied causes of "drying up," a precise diagnosis is paramount. I strongly recommend collecting samples of affected branches, leaves, or even soil (if root issues are suspected) and bringing them to the Plant Pathology or Horticulture Department at HAU, Hisar, for expert analysis. This will enable us to provide the most accurate and targeted recommendations for your specific situation.
