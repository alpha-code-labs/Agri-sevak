As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified practices to protect Apricot trees from environmental stresses in Haryana:

**1. Protection from Extreme Cold and Frost:**

*   **Pre-Frost Irrigation:** Apply a light, thorough irrigation to the orchard a day or two before an anticipated frost event. Wet soil retains and radiates heat more effectively than dry soil, raising the ambient temperature around the trees. Sprinkler irrigation can also be used during frost events, as the latent heat released when water freezes on plant surfaces can protect tissues.
*   **Covering Young Trees:** For young apricot plants, provide individual covers using materials like straw, hessian cloth, or plastic sheets supported by stakes to create a mini-shelter. Ensure the cover does not directly touch the foliage.
*   **Windbreaks:** Establish windbreaks or shelterbelts on the northern and western sides of the orchard to reduce the impact of cold, dry winds.
*   **Avoid Late Pruning:** Refrain from pruning apricot trees late in the season, as it stimulates new, tender growth that is highly susceptible to frost damage.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure balanced nutrition, particularly adequate potassium, which can enhance cold hardiness in plants.

**2. Protection from Heat Stress and Loo (Hot Winds):**

*   **Adequate Irrigation:** Maintain optimal soil moisture through regular and sufficient irrigation, especially during hot periods and when hot winds (Loo) are prevalent. This is crucial for the tree's cooling mechanism (transpiration) and overall physiological function.
*   **Mulching:** Apply a thick layer (10-15 cm) of organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves, wood chips) around the base of the trees, extending to the drip line. Mulch conserves soil moisture, reduces soil temperature, and minimizes weed competition.
*   **Windbreaks/Shelterbelts:** Plant tall, fast-growing trees (e.g., Poplar, Eucalyptus) as permanent windbreaks on the western and southern sides of the orchard to reduce the velocity and drying effect of hot winds.
*   **White Washing Trunks:** Paint the trunks and lower scaffold branches with a lime wash (calcium carbonate solution). This reflects sunlight, reduces bark temperature, and prevents sunscald and heat stress on the cambium layer.
*   **Temporary Shade Nets:** For very young trees or during extreme heat waves, temporary shade nets (e.g., 30-50% shade) can be erected over individual plants or rows to reduce direct sun exposure and heat load.

**3. Protection from Intense Sunlight (Sunscald):**

*   **White Washing Trunks and Branches:** As mentioned above, painting exposed trunks and main branches with a lime wash is highly effective in reflecting intense sunlight and preventing sunscald, which can lead to bark cracking, canker development, and reduced tree vigor.
*   **Canopy Management:** Practice judicious pruning to maintain a balanced canopy that provides some self-shading for fruits and branches without excessively reducing light penetration for photosynthesis. Avoid heavy pruning that exposes previously shaded parts of the tree to sudden intense sunlight.
*   **Mulching:** Helps keep the soil cool, which indirectly reduces overall heat stress on the tree and protects roots from high soil temperatures caused by intense sunlight.
