As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding apricot maturity, harvesting, and cutting processes for growers in Haryana:

Apricot harvesting requires careful timing and technique to ensure optimal fruit quality and shelf life.

### Maturity Signs for Apricot

The following signs indicate that apricots are ready for harvest:

*   **Colour Change:** The most prominent sign is the change in skin colour from green to the characteristic yellow, orange, or reddish blush, depending on the variety. The fruit should have developed its full varietal colour.
*   **Softness:** The fruit should feel slightly soft to the touch, but not mushy. A gentle squeeze will indicate a slight give.
*   **Aroma:** Ripe apricots develop a distinct, sweet, and fragrant aroma.
*   **Ease of Separation:** A mature apricot will detach easily from the spur with a gentle twist. If it requires significant pulling, it is likely not fully ripe.
*   **Flesh Colour:** When cut, the flesh should be uniformly coloured and not green near the pit.

### Harvesting Time for Apricot in Haryana

*   In Haryana, apricot harvesting typically occurs from **late May to June**, depending on the specific variety and local climatic conditions.
*   Early maturing varieties may be ready by mid-May, while later varieties extend into June.
*   Apricots on a single tree do not ripen uniformly, necessitating **multiple pickings** (usually 2-3 times) over a period of 1-2 weeks to harvest all ripe fruits.

### Cutting Process (Harvesting Method)

The recommended harvesting process for apricots to ensure quality and minimize damage is as follows:

*   **Hand Picking:** Apricots are delicate fruits and should always be hand-picked to prevent bruising and damage.
*   **Gentle Twist:** Hold the fruit gently in your palm and give it a slight upward twist. A ripe apricot will separate easily from the spur with its stem attached. Avoid pulling forcefully, which can damage the fruit or the fruiting spur for the next season.
*   **Stem Retention:** Ideally, a short stem should remain attached to the fruit. This helps to prolong shelf life and reduces the risk of rot at the stem end.
*   **Careful Placement:** Place the harvested fruits carefully into padded containers (e.g., baskets lined with soft material) to prevent bruising. Do not drop or throw fruits into containers.
*   **Harvesting Time of Day:** It is best to harvest apricots during the cooler parts of the day, preferably in the early morning after the dew has dried, to reduce field heat and maintain fruit quality.
*   **Avoid Over-ripeness:** Harvest fruits when they are firm-ripe. Over-ripe fruits are more susceptible to bruising and have a shorter shelf life.
