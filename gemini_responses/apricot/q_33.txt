Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I understand the importance of effective weed management for healthy Apricot orchards. Weed control in perennial fruit trees like Apricot requires an integrated approach, combining cultural, mechanical, and chemical methods, with careful consideration for the tree's health and the environment.

Here's a scientifically verified approach to control the specified weeds in Apricot orchards in Haryana:

**General Principles for Weed Management in Apricot Orchards:**

1.  **Integrated Weed Management (IWM):** Combine manual weeding, mulching, inter-row cultivation, and judicious use of herbicides.
2.  **Timing:** Apply herbicides when weeds are young and actively growing for best results.
3.  **Safety:** Always use shielded sprayers for non-selective herbicides to prevent contact with Apricot tree trunks, foliage, and young shoots. Avoid spraying during windy conditions.
4.  **Soil Moisture:** Ensure adequate soil moisture before applying pre-emergence herbicides for optimal efficacy.

**Specific Weed Control Strategies:**

**1. Broadleaf Weeds (including Bathu, Congress Grass) and Narrowleaf Weeds (including Phalaris minor):**
These general categories of weeds can be managed using a combination of methods.

*   **Cultural & Mechanical Control:**
    *   **Hand Weeding:** Effective for young trees and small areas.
    *   **Mulching:** Apply organic mulches (straw, wood chips, dry leaves) around the base of trees to suppress weed growth, conserve moisture, and regulate soil temperature.
    *   **Inter-row Cultivation:** Shallow cultivation between tree rows can control weeds, but avoid deep tillage near tree roots.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Pre-emergence Herbicides (for preventing new weed growth):** Apply to a clean, moist soil surface before weed emergence.
        *   **Oxyfluorfen 23.5% EC:** Apply at 400-800 ml per acre in 200-300 litres of water.
        *   **Pendimethalin 30% EC:** Apply at 1.0-1.3 litres per acre in 200-300 litres of water.
    *   **Post-emergence Herbicides (for existing weeds):** Use non-selective herbicides as shielded sprays to avoid contact with Apricot trees.
        *   **Glyphosate 41% SL:** Apply at 4-6 ml per litre of water (or 1.6-2.4 kg a.i. per acre, which translates to approximately 4-6 litres of product per acre) for general weed control. Ensure application is directed only at weeds, avoiding contact with the Apricot tree's green parts (leaves, young bark, shoots).

**2. Amarbail (Cuscuta spp.):**
Amarbail is a parasitic weed that can severely affect host plants.

*   **Cultural & Mechanical Control:**
    *   **Manual Removal:** This is the most effective method. Carefully remove infested branches or entire host plants (if they are weeds) as soon as Amarbail is noticed. Burn or dispose of the removed material away from the orchard to prevent re-infestation.
    *   **Prevention:** Ensure that any intercropped plants or nearby vegetation are free from Amarbail. Use clean seeds if intercropping.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   There are no selective herbicides that can control Amarbail on Apricot trees without causing significant damage to the tree itself. Chemical control is generally not recommended for Amarbail directly on fruit trees. Focus on manual removal and prevention.

**3. Orobanche (Broomrape):**

*   This is not known to affect Apricot. Orobanche species are root parasitic weeds primarily affecting dicotyledonous crops like mustard, tomato, brinjal, tobacco, and some legumes. It is not a known host for Apricot.

Always read and follow the label instructions of any herbicide product carefully before use. For specific recommendations tailored to your orchard's conditions, it is advisable to consult with local agricultural extension specialists.
