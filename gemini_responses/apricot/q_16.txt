As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following fertilizer schedule for Apricot cultivation in Haryana. Please note that these are general recommendations, and a **soil test is highly recommended** to determine the precise nutrient requirements of your specific orchard soil.

**General Principles:**
*   Fertilizer doses should be adjusted based on tree age, yield, soil type, and results of soil analysis.
*   Nutrients are best applied in the root zone, typically in a band around the tree canopy, avoiding direct contact with the trunk.
*   Ensure adequate soil moisture for efficient nutrient uptake after fertilizer application.

### **1. For Young/Non-Bearing Apricot Trees (1-4 years old):**

The dose should be gradually increased with the age of the tree.

*   **Year 1:** 1/4th of the bearing tree dose
*   **Year 2:** 1/2 of the bearing tree dose
*   **Year 3:** 3/4th of the bearing tree dose
*   **Year 4 onwards (or when bearing starts):** Full bearing tree dose

**Recommended Dose for a 1-Year-Old Tree (approximate):**

*   **Urea:** 400 g per tree
*   **SSP (Single Super Phosphate):** 600 g per tree
*   **Potash (Muriate of Potash - MOP):** 300 g per tree
*   **Sulphur:** (Covered by SSP)

**Alternatively, for young trees, a balanced NPK fertilizer can be used:**

*   **NPK (e.g., 19:19:19 or 12:32:16):** 200-500 g per tree (gradually increasing with age)

### **2. For Bearing Apricot Trees (5 years and older):**

The following recommendations are for a mature, bearing apricot tree.

**A. Soil Application (Primary Fertilizers):**

*   **Urea:** 1.5 - 2.0 kg per tree per year (e.g., 1600 g per tree)
*   **SSP (Single Super Phosphate):** 2.0 - 2.5 kg per tree per year (e.g., 2300 g per tree)
*   **Potash (Muriate of Potash - MOP):** 1.0 - 1.5 kg per tree per year (e.g., 1250 g per tree)
*   **Sulphur:** The recommended dose of **SSP** (2.3 kg/tree) provides approximately 250 g of Sulphur, which is generally sufficient for a bearing tree. If **DAP** is used instead of **SSP**, then additional Sulphur may be required.
    *   **Sulphur (Elemental Sulphur 90%):** 100-200 g per tree (if not covered by SSP or soil test indicates deficiency).

**B. Alternative for Phosphorus (DAP):**

If **DAP** is preferred over **SSP** for Phosphorus, adjust the **Urea** dose accordingly as **DAP** also contains Nitrogen.

*   **DAP (Di-Ammonium Phosphate):** 800 - 900 g per tree per year (e.g., 850 g per tree)
    *   *Note:* This dose of **DAP** will provide approximately 150 g of Nitrogen.
*   **Urea:** Reduce the **Urea** dose to 1.0 - 1.2 kg per tree per year (e.g., 1100 g per tree) to compensate for the Nitrogen supplied by **DAP**.
*   **Potash (Muriate of Potash - MOP):** 1.0 - 1.5 kg per tree per year (e.g., 1250 g per tree)
*   **Sulphur (Elemental Sulphur 90%):** 100-200 g per tree (as **DAP** does not provide Sulphur).

**C. Nano Fertilizers (Foliar Application - Supplementary):**

Nano fertilizers are highly efficient and act as supplements to soil-applied fertilizers, especially during critical growth stages or nutrient stress.

*   **Nano-Urea:** 2-4 ml per litre of water. Apply as a foliar spray during vegetative growth and fruit development stages.
*   **Nano-DAP:** 2-4 ml per litre of water. Apply as a foliar spray during flowering and fruit setting stages.

**D. NPK (Complex Fertilizers):**

While individual fertilizers allow for precise nutrient management, complex NPK fertilizers can be used, especially for young trees or as supplementary feeding.

*   **NPK (e.g., 19:19:19 or 12:32:16):** Can be used as a basal dose for young trees (as mentioned above) or as a supplementary foliar spray at 5-10 g per litre of water during active growth.

### **Timing of Fertilizer Application:**

*   **Phosphorus (SSP or DAP), Potash (MOP), and Sulphur:** Apply the full annual dose as a basal application in **January-February**, before flowering.
*   **Nitrogen (Urea):** Split the annual dose into 2-3 applications:
    *   **1st Dose (50%):** In **January-February**, before flowering.
    *   **2nd Dose (25%):** In **March-April**, after fruit set.
    *   **3rd Dose (25%):** In **May-June**, after fruit harvest (to promote new growth and fruit bud differentiation for the next season).
*   **Nano-Urea and Nano-DAP:** Apply as foliar sprays during critical growth stages (e.g., pre-flowering, fruit set, fruit development, post-harvest flush). Typically 2-3 sprays per season.

**Important Note:** Always conduct a soil test to get precise recommendations tailored to your specific field conditions. This will help in optimizing fertilizer use and preventing nutrient imbalances.
