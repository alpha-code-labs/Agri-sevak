As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I advise on addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies in Apricot based on scientific principles and practices suitable for Haryana's agro-climatic conditions.

**Crucial First Step: Soil and Leaf Tissue Analysis**
Before applying any fertilizers, it is imperative to conduct a comprehensive soil test and, if possible, a leaf tissue analysis. Visual symptoms can be misleading, and precise nutrient management based on analytical data will prevent over-application, nutrient imbalances, and environmental harm.

### Addressing Nitrogen (N) Deficiency in Apricot

**Symptoms:**
*   General yellowing (chlorosis) of older leaves, starting from the tips and margins.
*   Stunted growth, reduced shoot length, and smaller leaves.
*   Poor fruit set and reduced fruit size.

**Correction:**

1.  **Soil Application:**
    *   For mature trees, a general recommendation is 200-400 g of elemental Nitrogen per tree per year, split into 2-3 applications. The first application should be before flowering, and subsequent applications after fruit set and during fruit development.
    *   **Recommended Fertilizers:**
        *   **Urea** (46% N): Apply 435-870 g of Urea per tree per year, split as advised.
        *   **Calcium Ammonium Nitrate (CAN)** (25% N): Apply 800-1600 g of CAN per tree per year, split as advised. This is beneficial if calcium is also required or if soil pH is a concern.
        *   **Ammonium Sulphate** (20.5% N): Apply 975-1950 g of Ammonium Sulphate per tree per year, split as advised. Provides sulfur, which is often beneficial.

2.  **Foliar Application (for quick correction or supplemental feeding):**
    *   Apply a 0.5-1% solution of low-biuret **Urea** (5-10 g/L of water) during periods of active growth, avoiding flowering time to prevent damage. Repeat every 10-15 days if symptoms persist.

### Addressing Phosphorus (P) Deficiency in Apricot

**Symptoms:**
*   Dark green or purplish discoloration of older leaves, especially on the underside.
*   Stunted growth, poor root development, and delayed maturity.
*   Reduced fruit quality and yield.

**Correction:**

1.  **Soil Application:**
    *   Phosphorus is less mobile in the soil. It should be applied in the root zone, preferably before flowering or during dormancy. For mature trees, a general recommendation is 100-200 g of P2O5 per tree per year.
    *   **Recommended Fertilizers:**
        *   **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5): Apply 625-1250 g of SSP per tree per year. SSP also provides sulfur and calcium.
        *   **Di-Ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5): Apply 217-435 g of DAP per tree per year. This will also contribute nitrogen. Adjust N application accordingly.
        *   **Triple Super Phosphate (TSP)** (46% P2O5): Apply 217-435 g of TSP per tree per year.

2.  **Foliar Application (less effective for P, but can provide a temporary boost):**
    *   Apply a 0.5-1% solution of **Monoammonium Phosphate (MAP)** (5-10 g/L of water) or **Potassium Dihydrogen Phosphate (MKP)** (5-10 g/L of water) during early growth stages.

### Addressing Potassium (K) Deficiency in Apricot

**Symptoms:**
*   Scorching or browning of leaf margins (necrosis), typically starting on older leaves.
*   Weak stems, poor fruit development, and reduced fruit size and quality.
*   Increased susceptibility to diseases and environmental stress.

**Correction:**

1.  **Soil Application:**
    *   Potassium is crucial for fruit development and quality. For mature trees, a general recommendation is 150-300 g of K2O per tree per year, split into 2 applications: before flowering and during fruit development.
    *   **Recommended Fertilizers:**
        *   **Muriate of Potash (MOP) / Potassium Chloride** (60% K2O): Apply 250-500 g of MOP per tree per year, split as advised. This is the most common and economical source.
        *   **Sulphate of Potash (SOP) / Potassium Sulphate** (50% K2O, 18% S): Apply 300-600 g of SOP per tree per year, split as advised. Preferred if chloride sensitivity is a concern or sulfur is also needed.

2.  **Foliar Application (for quick correction or supplemental feeding):**
    *   Apply a 0.5-1% solution of **Potassium Sulphate** (5-10 g/L of water) or **Potassium Nitrate** (5-10 g/L of water) during fruit development stages. Repeat every 10-15 days if symptoms persist.

**General Recommendations for Haryana:**

*   **Integrated Nutrient Management (INM):** Supplement chemical fertilizers with organic manures like well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or vermicompost (15-20 kg per tree annually for mature trees). This improves soil health, nutrient retention, and microbial activity.
*   **Water Management:** Ensure adequate and timely irrigation, as water stress can exacerbate nutrient deficiency symptoms and reduce nutrient uptake.
*   **Soil pH:** Haryana soils can often be alkaline. Maintain optimal soil pH (6.0-7.0) for better nutrient availability. Soil amendments like gypsum (for sodic soils) or organic matter can help.
*   **Timing:** Always consider the phenological stage of the apricot tree when applying nutrients for maximum efficacy.

Always consult your latest soil test report and local agricultural extension services for precise recommendations tailored to your specific orchard conditions.
