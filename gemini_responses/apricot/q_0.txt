As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for managing fungal diseases in Apricot in Haryana.

**Diseases Not Known to Affect Apricot:**

*   **Blast:** This is not known to affect Apricot as a fungal disease. The term 'blast' in stone fruits typically refers to bacterial blast caused by *Pseudomonas syringae*.
*   **Downy mildew:** This is not known to affect Apricot.

**Integrated Management for Fungal Diseases in Apricot:**

Effective control relies on a combination of cultural practices and timely chemical applications.

**1. Cultural Practices:**

*   **Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy fallen leaves, mummified fruits, and diseased twigs. Prune out infected branches during dormancy to reduce inoculum sources.
*   **Pruning:** Ensure proper tree spacing and pruning to improve air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce humidity and fungal growth.
*   **Nutrition:** Maintain balanced nutrient levels to promote tree vigor and resistance. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can lead to lush, susceptible growth.
*   **Irrigation:** Avoid overhead irrigation, especially during flowering and fruit development, as wet conditions favor fungal diseases. If possible, use drip irrigation.

**2. Chemical Control:**

Apply fungicides preventively or at the first sign of disease, following label instructions for dosage and safety. Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

**For Alternaria (Leaf Spot/Fruit Rot), Anthracnose (Fruit Rot/Leaf Spot), Brown Spot, and General Blight (e.g., Shot Hole Blight):**
These diseases often require broad-spectrum fungicidal protection, especially during leaf emergence, flowering, and fruit development.
*   **Mancozeb** (2.0-2.5 g/L water or 2.0-2.5 kg/acre)
*   **Chlorothalonil** (2.0-2.5 g/L water or 2.0-2.5 kg/acre)
*   **Captan** (2.0-2.5 g/L water or 2.0-2.5 kg/acre)
*   **Copper Oxychloride** (2.5-3.0 g/L water or 1.0-1.5 kg/acre) - particularly effective as a dormant spray or early season.
*   **Azoxystrobin** (0.5-1.0 ml/L water or 200-300 ml/acre)
*   **Tebuconazole** (0.75-1.0 ml/L water or 250-300 ml/acre)
*   **Difenoconazole** (0.5 ml/L water or 150-200 ml/acre)

**For Powdery Mildew:**
Apply fungicides at the first appearance of white powdery patches on leaves or fruits, and repeat as necessary.
*   **Sulphur** (Wettable Sulphur 80% WP) (2.0-3.0 g/L water or 2.0-3.0 kg/acre) - Avoid application when temperatures are very high (>30°C) to prevent phytotoxicity.
*   **Myclobutanil** (0.5-1.0 g/L water or 200-300 g/acre)
*   **Hexaconazole** (1.0-2.0 ml/L water or 300-600 ml/acre)
*   **Difenoconazole** (0.5 ml/L water or 150-200 ml/acre)
*   **Azoxystrobin** (0.5-1.0 ml/L water or 200-300 ml/acre)

**For Brown Rot Blossom Blight (*Monilinia laxa*) and Grey Mildew (Grey Mould, *Botrytis cinerea*):**
These diseases are critical during flowering and fruit ripening. Timely sprays are essential.
*   **Thiophanate-methyl** (1.0-1.5 g/L water or 300-500 g/acre)
*   **Carbendazim** (0.5-1.0 g/L water or 200-300 g/acre)
*   **Iprodione** (1.0-1.5 g/L water or 400-600 g/acre)
*   **Tebuconazole** (0.75-1.0 ml/L water or 250-300 ml/acre)
*   **Azoxystrobin** (0.5-1.0 ml/L water or 200-300 ml/acre)
*   For combination products, consider those containing **Boscalid** and **Pyraclostrobin** (e.g., 1.0-1.5 g/L water or 400-600 g/acre of the formulated product).
*   For combination products, consider those containing **Cyprodinil** and **Fludioxonil** (e.g., 0.6-0.8 g/L water or 250-300 g/acre of the formulated product).

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the fungicide label, including dosage, application timing, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and safety precautions.
*   Consult your local agricultural extension office or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and current disease pressure.
*   Ensure proper spray coverage for effective control.
