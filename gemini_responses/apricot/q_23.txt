As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified recommendations for Apricot cultivation in Haryana.

It is important to note that commercial apricot cultivation is primarily done through vegetative propagation (budding or grafting onto suitable rootstocks) or by planting nursery-raised saplings, rather than direct seed sowing. Therefore, direct seed treatment for commercial fruit production is not a standard practice. However, if seeds are used for raising rootstock seedlings, a fungicidal seed treatment can be beneficial.

### Seed Treatment Process (If seeds are used for rootstock production)

If apricot seeds are used for raising rootstock seedlings, a fungicidal seed treatment is recommended to protect against seed-borne diseases and damping-off in the nursery.

*   **Fungicidal Treatment:**
    *   Treat seeds with a broad-spectrum fungicide before sowing.
    *   **Carbendazim** 12% + **Mancozeb** 63% WP at 2-3 g per kg of seed.
    *   **Thiram** 75% WS at 2.5-3 g per kg of seed.
    *   **Captan** 75% WS at 2.5-3 g per kg of seed.
*   **Bio-fungicidal Treatment:**
    *   Alternatively, or in addition to chemical treatment, treat seeds with a biological agent.
    *   **Trichoderma viride** (bio-fungicide) at 5-10 g per kg of seed.

### Soil Treatment Process

Soil treatment for apricot involves pre-planting preparation and ongoing management to ensure a healthy growing environment.

#### A. Pre-planting Soil Treatment

Before planting apricot saplings, thorough soil preparation and treatment are crucial for establishing a healthy orchard.

1.  **Soil Testing:**
    *   Conduct a comprehensive soil test to determine nutrient status, pH, and presence of any soil-borne pathogens or nematodes. This will guide specific amendments.

2.  **Organic Matter Incorporation:**
    *   Incorporate well-rotted farmyard manure (FYM) or compost at a rate of 10-15 kg per planting pit (or 10-15 tonnes per acre broadcast) at least 2-3 months before planting. This improves soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability.

3.  **Soil Solarization (Optional but Recommended):**
    *   If feasible, especially in areas with known soil-borne disease or nematode problems, solarize the soil during the hot summer months (May-June) for 4-6 weeks. This involves covering moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets to raise soil temperature, effectively reducing populations of many pathogens, nematodes, and weed seeds.

4.  **Management of Soil-borne Pests and Diseases:**

    *   **Nematodes and Fungal Pathogens (e.g., Root Rot):**
        *   **Biological Control:** Apply bio-control agents to the soil before planting.
            *   **Trichoderma viride** (2.5 kg per acre) mixed with 50 kg of well-rotted FYM or compost, applied to the soil in the planting pits.
            *   **Pseudomonas fluorescens** (2.5 kg per acre) mixed with 50 kg of well-rotted FYM or compost, applied to the soil in the planting pits.
        *   **Chemical Control (if severe and justified by soil test):**
            *   For nematodes: Drench the planting pit area with **Fluopyram** 34.48% SC at 625 ml per acre (diluted in sufficient water).
            *   For root rot complex (e.g., Phytophthora): Drench the planting pit area with **Propamocarb hydrochloride** 72.2% SL at 2-3 ml per litre of water.
            *   For general soil-borne fungi: Drench the planting pit area with **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 2-3 g per litre of water.

#### B. Post-planting / Ongoing Soil Treatment

After planting, continuous monitoring and targeted soil treatments may be required.

1.  **Termite Management:**
    *   If termite activity is observed around the base of young trees, drench the soil around the trunk with an insecticide.
    *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 2.5 ml per litre of water. Apply sufficient quantity to soak the soil around the base of the tree.

2.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Regularly apply fertilizers based on soil and leaf analysis to maintain optimal nutrient levels. This is crucial for tree health and vigor, which in turn enhances resistance to pests and diseases.

3.  **Weed Management:**
    *   Maintain a weed-free basin around the trees through mulching, manual weeding, or judicious use of herbicides (e.g., **Glyphosate** 41% SL as a directed spray, avoiding contact with tree bark and foliage).

4.  **Re-application of Bio-agents:**
    *   Periodically apply **Trichoderma viride** and **Pseudomonas fluorescens** (2.5 kg per acre each, mixed with FYM) to the soil, especially during monsoon or post-monsoon, to maintain beneficial microbial populations and suppress soil-borne pathogens.

Always follow label instructions for all chemical applications and ensure proper safety measures are taken. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) principles should be adopted for sustainable apricot cultivation.
