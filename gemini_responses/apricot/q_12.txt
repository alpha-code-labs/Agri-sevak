Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist from Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling Scale insects and Mealybugs in Apricot orchards in Haryana. Both these pests are known to affect Apricot and can cause significant damage if not managed properly.

Effective control involves an integrated approach combining cultural practices, biological control, and judicious use of CIBRC-approved chemical insecticides.

### General Management Principles:

1.  **Regular Monitoring:** Frequently inspect your apricot trees, especially the undersides of leaves, stems, and fruit clusters, for early signs of infestation.
2.  **Pruning:** Remove and destroy heavily infested branches, twigs, or leaves to reduce pest populations.
3.  **Orchard Hygiene:** Keep the orchard clean by removing weeds and debris that can harbor pests.
4.  **Encourage Natural Enemies:** Protect and encourage beneficial insects like ladybird beetles and parasitic wasps, which are natural predators of scale insects and mealybugs.

### Chemical Control Measures:

When pest populations are high and natural enemies are insufficient, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and in crevices where these pests hide.

#### For Scale Insects:

*   **Dormant Oil Spray:** Apply during the dormant season (winter) before bud break to smother overwintering scales.
    *   **Horticultural Mineral Oil (Petroleum Oil):** 10-15 ml per litre of water.
*   **During Growing Season (for crawler stage and young scales):**
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** 1.25 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** 0.5-0.7 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** 0.25 g per litre of water.

#### For Mealybugs:

*   **Horticultural Mineral Oil (Petroleum Oil):** Can be used, especially with good coverage, to suffocate mealybugs.
    *   **Horticultural Mineral Oil (Petroleum Oil):** 10-15 ml per litre of water.
*   **Systemic Insecticides (effective due to their sap-sucking nature):**
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** 1.25 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** 0.5-0.7 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** 0.25 g per litre of water.
    *   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:** 0.75 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** 0.2 g per litre of water.

### Important Considerations:

*   **Rotation of Chemicals:** To prevent the development of pesticide resistance, rotate insecticides with different modes of action.
*   **Adjuvants:** Consider adding a spreading agent or sticker to the spray solution, especially for mealybugs, to improve penetration through their waxy coating.
*   **Safety Precautions:** Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the pesticide label, including dosage, application method, safety gear, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   **Timing of Application:** Apply insecticides when pests are most vulnerable (e.g., crawler stage for scales, or when mealybug populations are building up). Avoid spraying during flowering to protect pollinators.
