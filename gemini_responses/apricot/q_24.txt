As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified practices for apricot transplantation in Haryana:

### Ideal Transplantation Time for Apricot

The ideal time for transplanting apricot saplings in Haryana is during their dormant period. This typically falls in the **winter months**, specifically from **late December to February**. Planting during this period allows the saplings to establish their root system before the onset of hot summer temperatures and active growth.

### Ideal Transplantation Distance for Apricot

The recommended spacing for apricot trees depends on the rootstock vigor and the desired training system. For standard vigorous rootstocks and open-vase or modified leader training systems commonly adopted in the region, the following spacing is advised:

*   **Row-to-Row Distance:** 6 meters
*   **Plant-to-Plant Distance:** 6 meters

This provides adequate space for tree development, light penetration, air circulation, and ease of orchard operations.

### Ideal Transplantation Process for Apricot

A meticulous transplantation process is crucial for the successful establishment and long-term health of apricot trees.

1.  **Pit Preparation:**
    *   Dig pits of **1 meter x 1 meter x 1 meter** (length x width x depth) at the marked distances.
    *   This should ideally be done 1-2 months before planting (e.g., October-November for December-February planting) to allow the soil to weather and expose it to sunlight, which helps in pest and disease control.
    *   Separate the topsoil from the subsoil.
    *   Fill each pit with a mixture of:
        *   Topsoil
        *   20-30 kg of well-rotted Farmyard Manure (FYM) or compost
        *   500 g of **Single Super Phosphate**
        *   250 g of **Muriate of Potash**
        *   (Optional, if soil pH is low) 1-2 kg of gypsum or lime, based on soil test recommendations.
    *   Mix these components thoroughly and refill the pits, allowing the mixture to settle.

2.  **Selection of Saplings:**
    *   Procure healthy, disease-free, 1-2 year old grafted saplings from a reputable and certified nursery.
    *   Ensure the graft union is clearly visible and healthy.

3.  **Planting the Sapling:**
    *   Carefully remove the sapling from its nursery bag or container, ensuring the root ball remains intact and undisturbed.
    *   Place the sapling in the center of the prepared pit.
    *   Ensure that the graft union is positioned approximately **15-20 cm above the ground level** after planting. This prevents scion rooting and maintains the benefits of the rootstock.
    *   Backfill the pit with the remaining prepared soil mixture, gently firming the soil around the roots to remove any air pockets. Avoid compacting the soil too much.
    *   Create a small basin or ring around the newly planted sapling for efficient irrigation.

4.  **Post-Planting Care:**
    *   **Immediate Irrigation:** Water the sapling thoroughly immediately after planting to settle the soil around the roots.
    *   **Staking:** Provide support to the young sapling with a sturdy stake, especially in windy areas, to prevent damage and ensure upright growth.
    *   **Pruning:** Head back the sapling to a height of about **90-100 cm** from the ground level. This encourages the development of strong primary branches at a desirable height, forming the basic framework of the tree.
    *   **Mulching:** Apply a layer of organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves) around the base of the tree to conserve soil moisture, regulate soil temperature, and suppress weed growth.
    *   **Pest and Disease Monitoring:** Regularly inspect the young sapling for any signs of pests or diseases and take appropriate, CIBRC-approved control measures if necessary.
