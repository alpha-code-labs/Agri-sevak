As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the critical role of micronutrients in Apricot cultivation for optimal yield and quality in Haryana. Accurate diagnosis through soil and leaf tissue analysis is the first and most crucial step before applying any corrective measures.

Here's how to address common micronutrient deficiencies in Apricot:

### General Recommendation

Before any application, it is highly recommended to conduct a comprehensive **soil test** and **leaf tissue analysis**. This will confirm the specific deficiency and its severity, allowing for precise and effective treatment, preventing over-application which can lead to toxicity.

### Specific Micronutrient Deficiencies and Their Management

#### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Small, narrow leaves (often called "little leaf"), rosetting of leaves at the shoot tips, interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins), and reduced fruit size and yield.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray 0.2-0.5% solution of **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (2-5 g/L of water).
        *   Alternatively, spray 0.1% solution of **Zinc EDTA** (1 g/L of water).
        *   Apply during dormant period, pre-bloom, or post-harvest. Repeat if symptoms persist.
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   Apply **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** at 10-25 kg/acre, depending on soil test recommendations and severity. This is best incorporated into the soil before planting or broadcast around the tree base.

#### 2. Iron (Fe) / Ferrous Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Pronounced interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, where the veins remain green while the tissue between them turns yellow. In severe cases, leaves may become entirely yellow or even white, leading to necrosis.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray 0.2-0.5% solution of **Ferrous sulphate** (2-5 g/L of water).
        *   Alternatively, spray 0.1-0.2% solution of **Ferrous EDTA** (1-2 g/L of water).
        *   Multiple applications (2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals) may be required, especially in alkaline soils.
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   For severe cases, especially in alkaline soils, apply **Ferrous sulphate** at 25-50 kg/acre or **Ferrous EDTA** at 5-10 kg/acre. This is often less effective than foliar sprays in high pH soils.

#### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Dieback of growing points, cracking of fruits, internal browning or corky spots in fruits, poor fruit set, and misshapen fruits. Leaves may appear thick and brittle.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray 0.1-0.2% solution of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (1-2 g/L of water).
        *   Alternatively, spray 0.1% solution of **Boric acid** (1 g/L of water).
        *   Apply pre-bloom and/or post-harvest.
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   Apply **Borax** (sodium tetraborate decahydrate) at 5-10 kg/acre or **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** at 2-4 kg/acre.
        *   **Caution:** Boron can be toxic in excess, so apply strictly based on soil test recommendations.

#### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** While less common as a primary deficiency in Apricot compared to other fruits, it can manifest as tip burn of young leaves, stunted growth, poor fruit quality, and soft fruits. In some cases, it can contribute to fruit disorders.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray 0.5-1.0% solution of **Calcium chloride** (5-10 g/L of water).
        *   Alternatively, spray 0.5-1.0% solution of **Calcium nitrate** (5-10 g/L of water).
        *   Apply during fruit development stages.
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   Apply **Gypsum** (calcium sulphate dihydrate) at 200-500 kg/acre, depending on soil type and pH.
        *   If soil pH is low, **Calcium carbonate** (lime) can be applied as per soil test.

#### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, starting from the leaf margins and progressing inwards, often with a characteristic purplish or reddish tint. Leaves may become brittle and prematurely drop.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray 0.5-1.0% solution of **Magnesium sulphate** (Epsom salt) (5-10 g/L of water).
        *   Apply when symptoms appear, repeat every 2-3 weeks if necessary.
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   Apply **Magnesium sulphate** at 20-50 kg/acre.
        *   If soil pH is low, **Dolomite** (calcium magnesium carbonate) can be applied as per soil test.

#### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, similar to iron deficiency but often with a finer network of green veins, giving a mottled or speckled appearance. Growth may be stunted.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray 0.2-0.5% solution of **Manganese sulphate** (2-5 g/L of water).
        *   Alternatively, spray 0.1% solution of **Manganese EDTA** (1 g/L of water).
        *   Apply when symptoms appear.
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   Apply **Manganese sulphate** at 10-20 kg/acre.

### Important Considerations:

*   **Timing:** Foliar sprays are generally most effective when applied to young, actively growing leaves. Avoid spraying during hot midday sun to prevent leaf scorch.
*   **Water Quality:** Use clean water for mixing sprays.
*   **Adjuvants:** Adding a non-ionic spreader-sticker to foliar sprays can improve coverage and absorption.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management:** Micronutrient applications should be part of a balanced nutrient management plan, considering macronutrients (N, P, K) as well.
*   **Consultation:** Always consult with your local agricultural extension specialist or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions.
