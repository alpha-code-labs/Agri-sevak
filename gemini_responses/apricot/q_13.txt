As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fruit flies in Apricot in Haryana.

### Control of Fruit Fly in Apricot

Fruit flies, particularly species like *Bactrocera dorsalis*, are a significant pest of Apricot. Effective management requires an integrated approach.

**1. Cultural Control:**
*   **Sanitation:** Regularly collect and destroy all fallen and infested fruits by burying them deep (at least 60 cm) or burning them. This breaks the life cycle of the pest.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** After harvest, deep ploughing around the trees can expose pupae in the soil to predators and adverse weather conditions, reducing the next generation's population.

**2. Mechanical/Biological Control:**
*   **Pheromone Traps:** Install Methyl Eugenol pheromone traps at a density of 10-12 traps per acre, starting from the fruit development stage until harvest. Replace the lure every 2-3 weeks.
*   **Protein Bait Traps:** Use protein bait traps (e.g., containing protein hydrolysate or yeast autolysate) mixed with an insecticide to attract and kill adult fruit flies.

**3. Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved):**

*   **Bait Sprays:** These are highly effective and minimize insecticide use.
    *   Prepare a bait solution by mixing 100 g of jaggery or sugar with 10 litres of water and adding **Malathion** 50% EC at 2 ml/L of water. Apply this mixture as spot sprays on tree trunks or on a few leaves, not as a full canopy spray.
    *   Alternatively, use **Spinosad** 45% SC at 0.25 ml/L of water mixed with protein hydrolysate or jaggery. Apply as spot sprays.

*   **Foliar Sprays (if infestation is severe and bait sprays are insufficient):**
    *   Spray with **Dimethoate** 30% EC at 1.0 ml/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, spray with **Deltamethrin** 2.8% EC at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   Ensure thorough coverage of the fruit-bearing canopy. Observe pre-harvest intervals (PHI) strictly for any chemical application.

### Control of Ber Fly in Apricot

This is not known to affect Apricot. The Ber fruit fly (*Carpomyia vesuviana*) is a host-specific pest primarily affecting Ber (*Ziziphus mauritiana*) and is not known to infest Apricot.
