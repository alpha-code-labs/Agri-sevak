As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies in Apricot orchards in Haryana.

Effective pest management in Apricot relies on an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural practices, regular monitoring, and judicious use of chemical controls when necessary.

**General Cultural Practices for Pest Management:**

*   **Orchard Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy fallen fruits, leaves, and pruned branches, as these can harbor pests.
*   **Tree Health:** Maintain tree vigor through proper nutrition, irrigation, and pruning. Healthy trees are more resilient to pest attacks.
*   **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect trees for signs of pest activity, such as chewed leaves, damaged fruits, or boreholes in branches. Early detection is key to effective control.

**1. Control of Beetles in Apricot:**

Various beetle species can affect Apricot, including defoliating beetles, fruit-feeding beetles, and borers.

*   **Identification:** Identify the specific type of beetle causing damage. For instance, shot-hole borers create small, round holes in branches and trunks, while chafer beetles may feed on foliage or flowers.
*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   For borers, maintain tree health to prevent stress, which makes trees more susceptible. Prune out and destroy heavily infested branches.
    *   For soil-dwelling grubs (larvae of some beetles like chafers), deep ploughing during winter can expose them to predators and adverse weather.
*   **Chemical Control (if infestation is severe):**
    *   **For foliar-feeding or fruit-feeding beetles:**
        *   Spray with **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   Alternatively, spray with **Malathion** 50% EC at 2 ml/L of water.
    *   **For Shot-hole Borers (on trunk and branches):**
        *   Swab the affected trunk and branches with a solution of **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 2.5 ml/L of water. Ensure good coverage of the affected areas.

**2. Control of Weevils in Apricot:**

Weevils can cause damage by feeding on buds, leaves, and fruits, or by laying eggs in developing fruits, leading to fruit drop or malformation.

*   **Identification:** Look for characteristic crescent-shaped scars on young fruits (e.g., from plum curculio) or notched leaves.
*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Collect and destroy fallen infested fruits promptly to break the pest life cycle.
    *   Shake branches over a sheet early in the morning to dislodge adult weevils, then collect and destroy them.
*   **Chemical Control (if infestation is severe):**
    *   Spray with **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, spray with **Malathion** 50% EC at 2 ml/L of water.
    *   Apply sprays at critical stages, such as petal fall and during early fruit development, if weevil activity is observed.

**3. Control of Sawflies in Apricot:**

This is not known to affect Apricot significantly in Haryana. While some sawfly species are pests of other stone fruits like plum and apple, their incidence and damage on Apricot are generally uncommon and not considered a major concern in the region. Therefore, specific control measures for sawflies on Apricot are usually not required. If you observe unusual sawfly-like damage, please collect samples and consult with HAU experts for accurate identification and specific recommendations.

**Important Considerations for Chemical Application:**

*   **Timing:** Apply insecticides at the correct stage of pest development and tree phenology for maximum effectiveness.
*   **Safety:** Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the pesticide label, including dosage, application method, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and safety precautions.
*   **Protective Gear:** Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and application.
*   **Environmental Impact:** Be mindful of beneficial insects and pollinators. Avoid spraying during peak pollinator activity.

For any specific concerns or severe infestations, it is always advisable to consult with the experts at Haryana Agricultural University for precise diagnosis and tailored recommendations.
