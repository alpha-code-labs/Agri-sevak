As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice on irrigation management for Apricot in Haryana:

Apricot (Prunus armeniaca) is a deciduous fruit tree that requires careful irrigation management to ensure optimal growth, flowering, fruit set, and fruit development. While apricots are relatively drought-tolerant once established, timely irrigation during critical stages significantly impacts yield and fruit quality.

**General Irrigation Principles for Apricot:**

*   **Soil Type:** Lighter soils (sandy loams) require more frequent but lighter irrigations, while heavier soils (clay loams) need less frequent but heavier irrigations.
*   **Climate:** Hot, dry, and windy conditions increase evapotranspiration, necessitating more frequent irrigation.
*   **Tree Age and Size:** Young trees require more frequent irrigation due to their developing root systems. Mature, bearing trees have higher water demands during specific growth stages.
*   **Soil Moisture Monitoring:** Regularly check soil moisture using a tensiometer, gravimetric method, or simply by the "feel method" to determine irrigation needs. Irrigate when 50-60% of the available soil moisture in the root zone has been depleted.

**Irrigation Management in Apricot:**

**1. First Irrigation:**

*   **Timing:** The first irrigation is crucial and is typically given **after the dormancy period breaks, around the bud swell stage (late February to early March in Haryana, depending on local conditions and variety)**. If planting new trees, the first irrigation is given immediately after planting.
*   **Purpose:**
    *   To rehydrate the tree after dormancy and support the initial flush of vegetative growth.
    *   To facilitate nutrient uptake from the soil.
    *   To support flower bud development and ensure good bloom.
*   **Method and Quantity:**
    *   Apply a thorough irrigation to wet the entire root zone. For established trees, this might involve applying 75-100 mm (750,000 - 1,000,000 litres per hectare) of water, depending on soil type and previous rainfall.
    *   Basin irrigation or drip irrigation are common methods. Ensure water penetrates deeply without causing surface runoff or waterlogging.

**2. Second Irrigation:**

*   **Timing:** The second irrigation is generally given **around the fruit set stage (late March to early April)**, approximately 2-3 weeks after the first irrigation, or when soil moisture depletion indicates the need.
*   **Purpose:**
    *   To support the initial growth of newly set fruits.
    *   To prevent premature fruit drop, which can occur due to water stress during this critical period.
    *   To maintain vegetative vigor and support the development of new shoots.
*   **Method and Quantity:**
    *   Similar to the first irrigation, apply sufficient water to replenish the soil moisture deficit. The quantity will depend on the soil type, prevailing temperatures, and the effectiveness of the first irrigation. Typically, 50-75 mm of water is sufficient.
    *   Continue with basin or drip irrigation, ensuring uniform distribution.

**Subsequent Irrigations:**

*   **Fruit Development and Sizing:** The period from pit hardening to fruit maturity (April-May) is the most critical for water demand. Regular irrigations (every 7-14 days, depending on soil and weather) are essential to achieve good fruit size and quality. Water stress during this period can lead to small, poor-quality fruits and reduced yield.
*   **Post-Harvest:** After harvest (June-July), a few irrigations may be beneficial to maintain tree health, support shoot growth, and promote flower bud differentiation for the next season, especially if the monsoon is delayed or insufficient.
*   **Winter:** Reduce irrigation significantly during the dormant period (November-January) to avoid waterlogging and promote chilling accumulation.

**Sprinkler Use (including Drip Irrigation):**

Sprinkler irrigation, particularly micro-sprinklers or drip irrigation, is highly recommended for apricot orchards in Haryana due to its water-saving efficiency and other benefits.

*   **Drip Irrigation:**
    *   **Advantages:**
        *   **High Water Use Efficiency:** Delivers water directly to the root zone, minimizing evaporation and deep percolation losses. This is crucial for water-scarce regions like Haryana.
        *   **Reduced Weed Growth:** Only wets the area around the tree, limiting weed germination in inter-rows.
        *   **Fertigation Capability:** Allows for efficient application of fertilizers along with water (fertigation), improving nutrient uptake.
        *   **Disease Management:** Keeps foliage dry, reducing the incidence of foliar diseases.
        *   **Uniform Application:** Provides precise and uniform water application.
    *   **Considerations:** Requires proper filtration to prevent emitter clogging. Initial installation cost can be higher than traditional methods.

*   **Micro-Sprinklers:**
    *   **Advantages:**
        *   Offers better coverage than drip for a slightly larger area around the tree.
        *   Can be useful for young trees with developing root systems.
        *   Also efficient in water use compared to flood irrigation.
    *   **Considerations:** Can wet a portion of the lower foliage, potentially increasing humidity locally.

*   **Overhead Sprinklers (Impact Sprinklers):**
    *   **Advantages:** Can be used for frost protection in specific situations by continuously running water.
    *   **Disadvantages:**
        *   **Lower Water Use Efficiency:** Significant water loss due to evaporation and wind drift.
        *   **Increased Disease Risk:** Wets the entire canopy, increasing humidity and creating favorable conditions for fungal diseases (e.g., brown rot, shot hole) during flowering and fruit development.
        *   **Interference with Pollination:** Can wash off pollen or deter pollinators if operated during flowering.
        *   **Soil Compaction:** High impact drops can lead to soil surface compaction.

**Recommendation for Haryana:**

Given the emphasis on water conservation in Haryana, **drip irrigation or micro-sprinkler systems are strongly recommended for apricot orchards.** They provide the most efficient water delivery, reduce disease risk, and allow for precise nutrient management through fertigation, leading to better yields and fruit quality with less water. Overhead sprinklers should generally be avoided during critical flowering and fruiting stages due to disease risks and potential interference with pollination.
