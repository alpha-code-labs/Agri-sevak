As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I must first clarify the terminology used in your question.

**Regarding "Tinda/Boll dropping":**
This is not known to affect Apricot. "Tinda" refers to Indian round gourd, and "Boll" refers to the fruit capsule of cotton. Apricot is a stone fruit (drupe) and does not produce tinda or bolls.

**Regarding Flower Drop and Fruit Drop in Apricot:**
Flower and fruit drop in apricot can be a significant concern, leading to reduced yields. This is often a complex physiological process influenced by various factors.

**Common Causes of Flower and Fruit Drop in Apricot:**

1.  **Physiological Stress:**
    *   **Water Stress:** Both excessive (waterlogging) and insufficient (drought) moisture can lead to drop.
    *   **Nutrient Deficiencies:** Lack of essential nutrients, particularly Boron, Zinc, and Calcium, can impair flower development and fruit set.
    *   **Temperature Extremes:** Frost during flowering, or very high temperatures during fruit set, can cause significant drop.
    *   **Poor Pollination:** Insufficient pollinator activity (bees), unviable pollen, or self-incompatibility of the variety.
    *   **Hormonal Imbalance:** Natural hormonal signals within the plant can trigger abscission (shedding) of flowers or young fruits, especially if the tree is overbearing or under stress.

2.  **Pest and Disease:**
    *   Severe infestations of pests (e.g., aphids, mites) or diseases (e.g., fungal infections affecting flowers/young fruits) can indirectly lead to drop, though this is less common as a primary cause of widespread drop.

**Control Measures for Flower and Fruit Drop in Apricot:**

Effective management involves a combination of cultural practices, nutritional support, and judicious use of plant growth regulators.

**A. Cultural and Agronomic Practices:**

*   **Proper Irrigation:** Maintain consistent soil moisture, especially during flowering and fruit development. Avoid waterlogging and severe drought stress.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Conduct soil and leaf analysis to identify nutrient deficiencies. Apply fertilizers based on recommendations. Ensure adequate supply of N, P, K, and micronutrients.
*   **Pollination Management:** Encourage pollinator activity by placing bee hives in or near the orchard during flowering. Avoid spraying insecticides during bloom.
*   **Pruning:** Practice proper pruning to maintain tree vigor, improve light penetration, and manage crop load. Overbearing trees are more prone to fruit drop.
*   **Weed Control:** Keep the orchard free of weeds to reduce competition for water and nutrients.
*   **Protection from Extreme Weather:** Where feasible, protect trees from frost during flowering using methods like overhead irrigation or smoke.

**B. Nutritional Management (Foliar Application):**

If deficiencies are suspected or confirmed, foliar sprays can provide quick relief.

*   **Boron:** Boron is crucial for pollen germination and fruit set.
    *   Spray with **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (e.g., Solubor) at 1-2 g/L of water.
    *   Timing: One spray before flowering and another at petal fall/fruit set.
*   **Zinc:** Zinc is essential for hormone production and overall plant growth.
    *   Spray with **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** at 2-5 g/L of water.
    *   Timing: One spray before flowering and another at petal fall/fruit set.

**C. Chemical Management (Plant Growth Regulators - PGRs):**

Plant growth regulators can be used to reduce pre-harvest fruit drop.

*   **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA):**
    *   **Dosage:** Apply **Naphthalene Acetic Acid** at a concentration of 10-20 mg/L (parts per million). For a typical 4.5% (45 g/L) liquid formulation, this translates to approximately **0.2-0.4 ml/L** of water.
    *   **Timing:** Spray 2-4 weeks before the anticipated harvest, or when initial signs of fruit drop are observed. A single application is usually sufficient. Ensure thorough coverage of the fruit and foliage.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions for all chemical products.
*   The effectiveness of PGRs can vary depending on the apricot variety, environmental conditions, and tree health.
*   It is advisable to consult with local agricultural extension services or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your orchard's conditions.
