As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice regarding rust diseases in Apricot.

Let's address each type of rust you've mentioned:

*   **Black Rust (Stem Rust):** This is primarily a disease of cereals (wheat, barley, rye, oats) and is **not known to affect Apricot.**
*   **Brown Rust (Leaf Rust):** This is primarily a disease of cereals (wheat, barley) and is **not known to affect Apricot.**
*   **Yellow Rust (Stripe Rust):** This is primarily a disease of cereals (wheat, barley, rye) and is **not known to affect Apricot.**
*   **White Rust:** This disease, caused by *Albugo* species, primarily affects cruciferous vegetables (e.g., mustard, radish) and some other plant families. This is **not known to affect Apricot.**
*   **Red Rust:** The term "Red Rust" typically refers to an algal disease caused by *Cephaleuros virescens*, which affects plants like tea, coffee, guava, mango, and litchi. This specific algal disease is **not known to be a significant problem for Apricot.**

However, Apricot trees are susceptible to a fungal rust disease commonly known as **Apricot Rust** or **Plum Rust**, caused by the fungus *Tranzschelia discolor* (also known as *Tranzschelia pruni-spinosae*). This disease is characterized by reddish-brown pustules on the leaves. It is highly probable that you are referring to this fungal rust when mentioning "Red Rust" in the context of Apricot.

### Control Measures for Apricot Rust (*Tranzschelia discolor*)

Apricot Rust is a significant fungal disease that can cause premature defoliation and weaken trees, especially during warm and humid conditions. Effective management involves a combination of cultural practices and timely chemical applications.

**Symptoms:**
*   Small, yellowish spots appear on the upper surface of leaves.
*   On the corresponding lower surface, reddish-brown, powdery pustules develop.
*   Severe infection leads to premature yellowing and defoliation, particularly during late spring and summer.

**Management Strategies:**

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Sanitation:** Collect and destroy all fallen infected leaves and plant debris, especially before winter, as the fungus overwinters on these. This significantly reduces the inoculum for the next season.
*   **Pruning:** Ensure proper tree spacing and prune trees to improve air circulation within the canopy. This helps reduce humidity, which is conducive to fungal growth.
*   **Nutrition:** Maintain tree vigor through balanced fertilization. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can promote lush, susceptible growth.
*   **Weed Control:** Keep the orchard floor free of weeds, which can harbor moisture and create a favorable microclimate for disease development.

**2. Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
Fungicide applications are crucial, especially in areas with a history of rust or during periods conducive to disease development (warm and humid conditions). The timing of application is critical, usually starting from late spring to early summer, and repeated as necessary.

*   **Preventive/Protective Sprays:**
    *   Apply at bud break or early leaf emergence, and repeat every 10-14 days if conditions are favorable for disease.
    *   **Wettable Sulphur** (80% WP): 2.5-3.0 g/L of water.
    *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP): 2.0-2.5 g/L of water.

*   **Systemic/Curative Sprays (for established infections or as part of a rotation):**
    *   These fungicides can penetrate plant tissues and offer some post-infection activity.
    *   **Propiconazole** (25% EC): 0.5-0.75 ml/L of water.
    *   **Difenoconazole** (25% EC): 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Myclobutanil** (10% WP): 0.5-1.0 g/L of water.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Rotation:** Always rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of fungicide resistance in the pathogen.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough spray coverage of all leaf surfaces, especially the undersides where pustules develop.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always observe the recommended Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) for each fungicide to ensure fruit safety and compliance with food safety standards.
*   **Local Recommendations:** For the most current and specific recommendations tailored to your specific apricot varieties and local conditions in Haryana, it is always advisable to consult with the agricultural extension services of HAU or other local experts.

By implementing these integrated management strategies, Apricot Rust can be effectively controlled, ensuring healthy trees and good fruit production.
