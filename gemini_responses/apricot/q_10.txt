As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the specified pests in Apricot:

### Control of Borers in Apricot

Borers, particularly stem borers, can cause significant damage to Apricot trees. Control measures include:

*   **Cultural Practices:** Regularly inspect trees for signs of borer attack (e.g., sawdust-like frass, exit holes, wilting branches). Prune and destroy severely infested branches.
*   **Mechanical Control:** For visible boreholes, clean out the frass and inject an insecticide solution using a syringe, then plug the hole with mud or cotton.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   For stem borers, drenching the base of the tree or swabbing the trunk with an insecticide solution can be effective. For active boreholes, direct injection is recommended.
    *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC**: Apply at 2.5 ml/L of water for drenching/swabbing the trunk. For injecting into boreholes, use 5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL**: Apply at 0.5-1 ml/L of water as a drench around the base of the tree or for swabbing the trunk.

### Control of Caterpillars and Leaf folders in Apricot

Various species of caterpillars and leaf folders can infest Apricot, causing defoliation and damage to leaves. Integrated pest management (IPM) approaches are recommended, including monitoring and timely application of insecticides when pest populations reach economic thresholds.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC**: Apply at 0.2 ml/L of water.
    *   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG**: Apply at 0.2 g/L of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC**: Apply at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Flubendiamide 20% WG**: Apply at 0.2 g/L of water.
    *   **Spinosad 45% SC**: Apply at 0.3-0.4 ml/L of water.
    *   **Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)** (various formulations): Apply at 1-2 g/L of water. This is a biological insecticide effective against caterpillars and is suitable for organic farming practices.

### Diamondback moth in Apricot

This is not known to affect Apricot. Diamondback moth (*Plutella xylostella*) is a major pest primarily of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower, mustard).

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully, including dosage, application method, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and safety precautions.
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
*   Apply insecticides during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension specialists for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and current pest outbreaks.
