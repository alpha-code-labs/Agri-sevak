Mites, including Red Spider Mite (e.g., *Tetranychus urticae*) and Rust Mite (e.g., *Aculus fockeui*), are significant pests of Apricot in Haryana, especially during warm and dry periods. Their feeding can lead to leaf bronzing, defoliation, reduced fruit quality, and overall tree vigor decline.

For effective and sustainable control, an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is recommended, combining cultural practices with judicious chemical applications:

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies:**

*   **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect Apricot trees, especially the undersides of leaves, for early signs of mite infestation. A hand lens can be useful for better visibility.
*   **Water Management:** Ensure proper irrigation to reduce plant stress, as stressed plants are often more susceptible to mite attacks.
*   **Pruning:** Remove heavily infested branches if practical, especially during dormant periods.
*   **Biological Control:** Encourage natural predators like predatory mites (e.g., *Amblyseius* species) and lacewings by minimizing the use of broad-spectrum pesticides that harm beneficial insects.

**Chemical Control (Acaricides):**

When mite populations reach damaging levels, chemical intervention with CIBRC-approved acaricides is necessary. Always ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where mites primarily reside.

**For Red Spider Mite control:**

*   **Spiromesifen** 22.9% SC: 0.5 ml/L of water.
*   **Fenpyroximate** 5% SC: 0.5 ml/L of water.
*   **Abamectin** 1.9% EC: 0.4 ml/L of water.
*   **Propargite** 57% EC: 1.0 ml/L of water.

**For Rust Mite control (also effective against Red Spider Mite):**

*   **Wettable Sulphur** 80% WP: 2.0-3.0 g/L of water. (Note: Sulphur can be phytotoxic at high temperatures, apply when temperatures are below 30°C).
*   **Fenpyroximate** 5% SC: 0.5 ml/L of water.

**Important Precautions:**

*   Always read and strictly follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety guidelines provided on the product label.
*   Wear appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying operations.
*   Rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in mite populations.
*   Observe the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) specified on the label before harvesting fruits to ensure food safety.
