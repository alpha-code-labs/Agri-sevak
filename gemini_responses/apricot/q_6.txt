As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I must emphasize that there are no chemical cures for viral diseases once a plant is infected. The control of viral diseases in Apricot, including symptoms like leaf curl, mosaic, yellowing, stripe, and stunting, relies entirely on preventive measures and management strategies.

Regarding the specific viruses mentioned:

*   **Tristeza virus:** This is not known to affect Apricot. It primarily affects citrus.
*   **Leaf curl, Mosaic, Yellow vein clearing, Stripe, and Stunt virus:** These are general descriptions of symptoms that can be caused by various viruses affecting Apricot, such as Prunus Necrotic Ringspot Virus (PNRSV), Prune Dwarf Virus (PDV), and potentially Plum Pox Virus (PPV) in regions where it is prevalent. Yellow vein clearing is a symptom, often associated with mosaic or other viral infections.

Here are the scientifically verified control measures for viral diseases in Apricot:

1.  **Use Virus-Free Planting Material:**
    *   Always procure certified virus-free saplings and budwood from reputable and government-approved nurseries. This is the most critical step in preventing viral diseases.

2.  **Rogueing and Destruction of Infected Plants:**
    *   Regularly inspect your orchard for plants showing symptoms of viral infection (e.g., distorted leaves, mosaic patterns, yellowing, stunting, abnormal fruit).
    *   Immediately remove and destroy (burn or bury deep) any infected plants to prevent the spread of the virus to healthy trees.

3.  **Sanitation and Hygiene:**
    *   Disinfect all pruning tools, grafting knives, and other equipment with a 10% bleach solution or 70% alcohol solution between trees to prevent mechanical transmission of viruses.
    *   Avoid grafting material from trees with unknown health status.

4.  **Weed Management:**
    *   Control weeds in and around the orchard, as some weeds can act as alternative hosts for viruses or their insect vectors.

5.  **Vector Control (if applicable):**
    *   Some viruses are transmitted by insect vectors like aphids or nematodes. While many common Apricot viruses (like PNRSV and PDV) are primarily transmitted through pollen, seed, or grafting, if a specific vector-borne virus is identified in your orchard, managing its vector can help reduce spread.
    *   For aphid control, if necessary, consider using CIBRC-approved insecticides:
        *   **Imidacloprid** (e.g., 0.3-0.5 ml/L water)
        *   **Thiamethoxam** (e.g., 0.2-0.4 g/L water)
        *   **Acetamiprid** (e.g., 0.2-0.4 g/L water)
        *   Apply as per label instructions, ensuring proper coverage and timing.

6.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Ensure trees are well-nourished with balanced fertilizers. Healthy trees are generally more resilient to stress, although this does not prevent viral infection.

7.  **Resistant Varieties:**
    *   If available and suitable for your region, choose Apricot varieties known to have resistance or tolerance to common viral diseases. Consult with HAU experts for recommendations on suitable varieties for Haryana.

Remember, early detection and strict adherence to these preventive measures are key to managing viral diseases in Apricot orchards.
