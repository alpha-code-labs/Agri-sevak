As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Apricot in Haryana:

**1. Grasshopper:**
Grasshoppers are generalist feeders and can cause damage to young apricot plants, leaves, and developing fruits, especially during periods of high population.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Maintain field sanitation by removing weeds and debris that can serve as breeding grounds.
    *   Deep plowing during the off-season can expose eggs to predators and adverse weather conditions.
*   **Chemical Control (Spot treatment for localized infestations):**
    *   **Malathion** 50% EC at 1.0-1.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 0.5 ml/L of water.

**2. Painted bug:**
This is not known to affect Apricot. Painted bug (*Bagrada hilaris*) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops like mustard, cabbage, and radish.

**3. Red cotton bug:**
This is not known to affect Apricot. Red cotton bug (*Dysdercus cingulatus*) is a major pest of cotton and other malvaceous plants, feeding on developing seeds.

**4. Black ants:**
Black ants are often secondary pests in apricot orchards. They are primarily attracted to the honeydew secreted by sap-sucking insects like aphids, mealybugs, and scale insects. They can also cause minor damage to ripening fruit. Effective control often involves managing the primary sap-sucking pests.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Regularly inspect trees for sap-sucking pests and manage them promptly.
    *   Remove any debris or weeds around the tree base that might provide shelter for ants.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **For ants on the tree trunk/ground:** Apply a band of sticky material around the trunk to prevent ants from climbing.
    *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 2.5 ml/L of water, applied as a drench around the base of the tree, avoiding direct contact with the fruit or foliage.
    *   **Fipronil** 0.05% Gel bait (commercial formulations available) can be placed near ant trails or nests on the ground, away from direct contact with the tree trunk or fruit.
