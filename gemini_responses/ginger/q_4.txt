Wilt, including Parawilt, is a serious threat to ginger cultivation in Haryana, primarily caused by bacterial wilt (*Ralstonia solanacearum*) and Fusarium wilt (*Fusarium oxysporum* f. sp. *zingiberi*). Effective control requires an integrated approach focusing on prevention and timely intervention. Here's our scientifically verified advice:

**I. Cultural and Agronomic Practices (Foundation of Control):**

*   **Use Disease-Free Planting Material:** This is the most critical step. Always source rhizomes from certified disease-free nurseries or fields known to be free from wilt.
*   **Rhizome Treatment (Pre-planting):** Before planting, treat rhizomes by dipping them for 30 minutes in a solution of:
    *   **Streptomycin Sulphate** (0.5 g/L water) + **Copper Oxychloride** (3 g/L water) for bacterial wilt, OR
    *   **Carbendazim** (1 g/L water) for Fusarium wilt.
    *   Alternatively, use biological agents: **Trichoderma viride** (10 g/kg rhizomes) or **Pseudomonas fluorescens** (10 g/kg rhizomes).
*   **Soil Solarization:** In affected fields, cover the soil with transparent polythene sheets for 4-6 weeks during hot summer months (May-June) to reduce soil-borne pathogens.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice a long crop rotation of at least 3-5 years with non-host crops like maize, wheat, paddy, or legumes (e.g., green gram, cowpea). Avoid planting ginger after solanaceous crops (tomato, potato, brinjal) or other ginger crops.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Regularly inspect your field. Immediately uproot and destroy (burn or bury deep away from the field) any wilted plants along with the surrounding soil to prevent further spread.
*   **Improve Drainage:** Ensure excellent field drainage. Plant ginger on raised beds (15-20 cm high) to prevent waterlogging, which favors disease development.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced fertilizers based on soil test reports. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can make plants more susceptible.
*   **Weed Management:** Keep the field free of weeds, as some weeds can act as alternate hosts for the wilt pathogens.

**II. Biological Control:**

*   **Soil Application of Biocontrol Agents:**
    *   Apply **Trichoderma viride** (2.5 kg/acre) or **Pseudomonas fluorescens** (2.5 kg/acre) mixed with 50 kg of farmyard manure (FYM) or compost. Apply this mixture to the soil at the time of planting or as a drench around the plants. Repeat application after 45-60 days if needed.

**III. Chemical Control (As a supplementary measure):**

*   **Soil Drenching (If disease symptoms appear):**
    *   For bacterial wilt: Drench the soil around the base of affected plants with a solution of **Streptomycin Sulphate** (0.5 g/L water) + **Copper Oxychloride** (3 g/L water).
    *   For Fusarium wilt: Drench the soil around the base of affected plants with a solution of **Carbendazim** (1-2 g/L water) or **Thiophanate Methyl** (1-2 g/L water).
    *   Ensure thorough drenching to reach the root zone. Repeat after 15-20 days if necessary, following label instructions.

Remember, an integrated approach combining these practices offers the best chance for successful wilt management in ginger. For specific diagnosis or further assistance, please contact your nearest Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or HAU extension specialist.
