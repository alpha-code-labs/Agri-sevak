As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned conditions in Ginger:

### Scab in Ginger

Scab in ginger can be caused by bacterial pathogens (e.g., *Streptomyces* species) or certain fungal pathogens, leading to rough, corky lesions on the rhizomes, reducing marketability and yield.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Use Disease-Free Rhizomes:** Always plant healthy, certified, disease-free rhizomes.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Practice a rotation of at least 3-4 years with non-host crops (e.g., cereals, legumes) to reduce soil-borne inoculum.
    *   **Soil Solarization:** During the hot summer months, cover the field with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks to raise soil temperature and reduce pathogen load.
    *   **Proper Drainage:** Ensure good field drainage to prevent waterlogging, which can exacerbate soil-borne diseases.
    *   **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced nutrients to enhance plant vigor and resistance.

*   **Chemical Control (as per CIBRC guidelines):**
    *   **Rhizome Treatment (before planting):**
        *   Dip rhizomes in a solution of **Carbendazim** 1 g/L + **Mancozeb** 2 g/L of water for 30 minutes.
        *   Alternatively, treat rhizomes with **Thiram** at 2 g/kg of rhizomes.
    *   **Soil Drench/Foliar Spray (if symptoms appear):**
        *   Drench the soil around affected plants or spray foliage with **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water.
        *   For severe cases, **Copper Oxychloride** at 3 g/L of water can be used as a soil drench or foliar spray, ensuring thorough coverage.

*   **Biological Control:**
    *   Application of bio-control agents like *Pseudomonas fluorescens* or *Bacillus subtilis* as rhizome treatment or soil application can help suppress the disease.
