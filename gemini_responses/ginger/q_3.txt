As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling various rot types in ginger, specifically tailored for conditions in Haryana. It is crucial to adopt an integrated disease management approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods for effective control.

Many of the rot types you listed (Root, Stem, Foot, Collar, Crown, Neck) are descriptive terms for the location of the rot and are often symptoms of the same underlying diseases affecting ginger rhizomes and pseudostems. We will address these under the major disease complexes.

### General Principles for Rot Management in Ginger

Before discussing specific chemical controls, implementing robust cultural and biological practices is paramount for preventing and managing rot diseases:

1.  **Selection of Healthy Seed Material:** Always use disease-free rhizomes (seed material) obtained from healthy plants. Inspect thoroughly for any lesions, discolouration, or signs of rot.
2.  **Site Selection and Soil Preparation:**
    *   Choose well-drained fields. Avoid low-lying areas prone to waterlogging.
    *   Prepare raised beds (15-20 cm high) to improve drainage and aeration around the rhizomes.
    *   Solarize the soil during summer months (May-June) by covering it with transparent polythene sheets for 4-6 weeks to reduce pathogen inoculum.
3.  **Crop Rotation:** Practice a minimum 3-4 year crop rotation with non-host crops like cereals (paddy, maize) or legumes. Avoid continuous ginger cultivation or rotation with other susceptible crops like tomato, potato, brinjal, or chilli.
4.  **Sanitation:**
    *   Remove and destroy all infected plant debris and diseased plants from the field immediately.
    *   Clean farm tools and equipment regularly to prevent pathogen spread.
5.  **Water Management:**
    *   Avoid overhead irrigation, especially during periods of high humidity, which can splash soil-borne pathogens.
    *   Use drip irrigation where feasible to deliver water directly to the root zone and keep foliage dry.
    *   Ensure proper drainage to prevent water stagnation.
6.  **Nutrient Management:** Provide balanced nutrition to plants. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can make plants more susceptible to diseases.
7.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Apply beneficial microbial antagonists like *Trichoderma viride* or *Pseudomonas fluorescens* to the soil or as a rhizome treatment.
        *   **Soil Application:** Mix 2.5 kg of *Trichoderma viride* or *Pseudomonas fluorescens* formulation (containing 10^8 CFU/g) with 50 kg of farmyard manure (FYM) or compost, moisten, and keep for a week. Apply this mixture per acre at the time of planting.
        *   **Rhizome Treatment:** Dip ginger rhizomes in a suspension of *Trichoderma viride* or *Pseudomonas fluorescens* (10 g/L or 10 ml/L water) for 30 minutes before planting.

### Specific Rot Types and Their Control

#### 1. Soft Rot Complex (Rhizome Rot, Root, Stem, Foot, Collar, Crown, Neck Rot)

These are primarily caused by soil-borne fungi like *Pythium aphanidermatum*, *Pythium myriotylum*, *Fusarium oxysporum* f. sp. *zingiberi*, and *Rhizoctonia solani*. Symptoms include water-soaked lesions on rhizomes, yellowing and wilting of leaves, and eventual collapse of the pseudostems.

**Chemical Control:**

*   **Rhizome Treatment (before planting):**
    *   Dip ginger rhizomes in a solution of **Metalaxyl** 35% WS (e.g., 2 g/L water) or **Mancozeb** 75% WP (e.g., 2.5 g/L water) for 30 minutes.
    *   Alternatively, use a combination product containing **Metalaxyl** 8% + **Mancozeb** 64% WP (e.g., 2.5 g/L water) for 30 minutes.
    *   For *Fusarium* and *Rhizoctonia*, **Carbendazim** 50% WP (e.g., 1 g/L water) can be used as a dip for 30 minutes.
*   **Soil Drench (after planting, at first sign of disease):**
    *   Drench the soil around the base of affected plants with a solution of **Metalaxyl** 8% + **Mancozeb** 64% WP (e.g., 2.5 g/L water) at 1-2 litres per plant, ensuring the solution reaches the root zone. Repeat if necessary after 15-20 days.
    *   Alternatively, use **Propamocarb hydrochloride** 72.2% SL (e.g., 1.5 ml/L water) as a soil drench.
    *   For *Fusarium* and *Rhizoctonia*, **Carbendazim** 50% WP (e.g., 1 g/L water) can be used as a soil drench.

#### 2. Bacterial Wilt

Caused by *Ralstonia solanacearum*, this disease leads to wilting of leaves without yellowing, water-soaked lesions at the collar region, and a characteristic milky ooze from cut pseudostems. Rhizomes show internal browning.

**Chemical Control:**

*   **Rhizome Treatment (before planting):**
    *   Dip ginger rhizomes in a solution of **Streptomycin sulphate** 9% + **Tetracycline hydrochloride** 1% SP (e.g., 0.5 g/L water) combined with **Copper oxychloride** 50% WP (e.g., 3 g/L water) for 30 minutes.
*   **Soil Drench (after planting, at first sign of disease):**
    *   Drench the soil around the base of affected plants with a solution of **Streptomycin sulphate** 9% + **Tetracycline hydrochloride** 1% SP (e.g., 0.5 g/L water) combined with **Copper oxychloride** 50% WP (e.g., 3 g/L water) at 1-2 litres per plant. Repeat if necessary after 15-20 days.

#### 3. Black Rot

Often caused by *Ceratocystis fimbriata*, this disease can occur in the field and is a significant post-harvest problem. It causes dark, sunken lesions on rhizomes, leading to complete rotting, often with a characteristic odour.

**Chemical Control:**

*   **Rhizome Treatment (before planting):**
    *   Dip ginger rhizomes in a solution of **Carbendazim** 50% WP (e.g., 1 g/L water) or **Tebuconazole** 25.9% EC (e.g., 1 ml/L water) for 30 minutes.
*   **Post-harvest Treatment (for storage):**
    *   Before storage, dip harvested rhizomes in a solution of **Carbendazim** 50% WP (e.g., 1 g/L water) for 10-15 minutes, then air dry in shade before storing in well-ventilated pits or rooms.

#### 4. Seed Rot and Seedling Rot (Damping-off)

These issues are common during germination and early seedling stages, often caused by *Pythium* spp., *Fusarium* spp., and *Rhizoctonia solani*. Seeds fail to germinate, or young seedlings collapse at the soil line.

**Chemical Control:**

*   **Rhizome Treatment (before planting):**
    *   Treat ginger rhizomes with **Thiram** 75% WS (e.g., 2-3 g/kg seed material) or **Captan** 50% WP (e.g., 2-3 g/kg seed material) as a dry dressing.
    *   Alternatively, use **Carbendazim** 50% WP (e.g., 1-2 g/kg seed material) as a dry dressing.

### Fruit Rot

This is not known to affect Ginger. Ginger is a rhizome (underground stem), not a fruit.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the chemical product label for specific dosages, application methods, and safety precautions.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Consult your local agricultural extension officer for the most current and specific recommendations for your region and specific ginger varieties.
*   Adhere to pre-harvest intervals (PHI) for any chemical applications to ensure food safety.
