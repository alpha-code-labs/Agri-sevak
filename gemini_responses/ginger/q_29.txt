This is not known to affect Ginger.

Ginger is primarily cultivated for its underground rhizomes, not for its flowers or fruits. Therefore, "flower drop" or "fruit drop" is not considered an economic concern or a recognized problem requiring specific control measures in ginger cultivation. The term "Tinda/Boll dropping" is entirely unrelated to ginger.
