Namaste, Kisan bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in Ginger in Haryana:

**1. Borers, Caterpillars, and Leaf folder:**
These pests, particularly the Ginger Borer/Leaf Folder (Udaspes folus), can cause significant damage by feeding on leaves and boring into pseudostems. Effective control measures include:

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Regular field sanitation and removal of affected plant parts.
    *   Monitoring for initial signs of infestation.
*   **Chemical Control (Apply at the initial stage of infestation, ensuring thorough coverage):**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC: 60 ml per acre, mixed in 200-250 litres of water.
    *   **Emamectin Benzoate** 5% SG: 80-100 g per acre, mixed in 200-250 litres of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: 200-250 ml per acre, mixed in 200-250 litres of water.
    *   **Fipronil** 5% SC: 400-600 ml per acre, mixed in 200-250 litres of water.
    *   **Cartap Hydrochloride** 50% SP: 400-500 g per acre, mixed in 200-250 litres of water.

**2. Diamondback moth:**
This is not known to affect Ginger. The Diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops.
