Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the critical role of micronutrients in achieving optimal ginger yield and quality. Addressing these deficiencies scientifically is key.

Before any application, it is **highly recommended to conduct a soil test** to accurately diagnose the specific deficiencies and their severity. This will ensure targeted and efficient nutrient management. Visual symptoms can be indicative, but soil testing provides precise data.

Here's how to address the common micronutrient deficiencies in ginger:

### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

Zinc deficiency is common in many soils of Haryana and significantly affects ginger growth, leading to stunted plants and reduced rhizome development.

*   **Chemical Name:** **Zinc Sulphate** (either Heptahydrate with 21% Zn or Monohydrate with 33% Zn)
*   **Application:**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Dissolve **Zinc Sulphate** (21% Zn) @ 2.5-5 grams per litre (g/L) of water. Apply 2-3 sprays at 15-20 day intervals, starting 30-45 days after planting.
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Zinc Sulphate** (21% Zn) @ 10-25 kg per acre (kg/acre) as a basal application or top dressing, based on soil test recommendations.

### 2. Iron (Fe) / Ferrous Deficiency

Iron deficiency typically manifests as interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, with veins remaining green. This affects photosynthesis and overall plant vigour.

*   **Chemical Name:** **Ferrous Sulphate** (19% Fe)
*   **Application:**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Dissolve **Ferrous Sulphate** @ 2.5-5 g/L of water. Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, especially during active growth.
    *   **Soil Application:** While foliar application is generally more effective for quick correction, **Ferrous Sulphate** can be applied @ 10-20 kg/acre in severe cases, though its availability can be limited in alkaline soils.

### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

Boron is crucial for cell wall formation, sugar transport, and root development. Its deficiency can lead to stunted growth and poor rhizome quality.

*   **Chemical Name:** **Borax** (Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate, 10.5% B) or **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (20% B)
*   **Application:**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Dissolve **Borax** @ 1-2 g/L of water. Apply 1-2 sprays during the vegetative growth phase.
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Borax** @ 4-8 kg/acre as a basal application, based on soil test results.

### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

Calcium is essential for cell wall structure, root growth, and overall plant strength. Deficiency can lead to poor root development and weak plants.

*   **Chemical Name:** **Calcium Nitrate** (18.8% Ca) or **Gypsum** (Calcium Sulphate, 23% Ca)
*   **Application:**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Dissolve **Calcium Nitrate** @ 5-10 g/L of water. Apply during active growth, especially if symptoms appear.
    *   **Soil Application:** For long-term correction and soil amendment, apply **Gypsum** @ 200-500 kg/acre during land preparation. **Calcium Nitrate** can also be applied through fertigation or as a top dressing @ 25-50 kg/acre.

### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

Magnesium is a central component of chlorophyll, vital for photosynthesis. Deficiency causes interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, often starting from the leaf margins.

*   **Chemical Name:** **Magnesium Sulphate** (Epsom Salt, 9.6% Mg)
*   **Application:**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Dissolve **Magnesium Sulphate** @ 5-10 g/L of water. Apply 2-3 sprays at 15-20 day intervals, particularly when symptoms are visible.
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Magnesium Sulphate** @ 10-20 kg/acre as a basal application or top dressing, based on soil test recommendations.

### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

Manganese is involved in photosynthesis, respiration, and nitrogen assimilation. Deficiency leads to interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, often with small necrotic spots.

*   **Chemical Name:** **Manganese Sulphate** (30.5% Mn)
*   **Application:**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Dissolve **Manganese Sulphate** @ 2.5-5 g/L of water. Apply 2-3 sprays during the active growth period.
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Manganese Sulphate** @ 5-10 kg/acre as a basal application, especially in soils with high pH.

**Important General Recommendations:**

*   **Timing:** Foliar sprays are best applied in the morning or late afternoon to avoid scorching and ensure better absorption.
*   **Water Quality:** Use clean water for spraying.
*   **Adjuvants:** Consider adding a good quality spreading agent (sticker) to foliar sprays for better coverage and absorption.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management:** Micronutrient application should be part of a holistic nutrient management plan, including proper application of NPK fertilizers and organic manures.
*   **Consultation:** Always consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's soil conditions and ginger variety.

By following these scientifically verified guidelines, you can effectively manage micronutrient deficiencies in your ginger crop and ensure healthy, productive plants.
