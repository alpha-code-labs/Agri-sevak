Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding sucking pests in ginger. Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips are common sucking pests that can significantly reduce ginger yield and quality by feeding on plant sap and transmitting viral diseases. While Psylla is not a primary or common pest of ginger, general sucking pest management strategies would also address it if it were to occur.

Effective management requires an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods.

### Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Sucking Pests in Ginger:

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy crop residues and weeds regularly, as they can harbor pests.
*   **Weed Management:** Keep the ginger field and surrounding areas free of weeds, which often act as alternate hosts for these pests.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Maintain recommended plant spacing to ensure good air circulation, which can reduce pest incidence.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, as lush, tender growth can attract sucking pests. Follow soil test-based nutrient recommendations.
*   **Monitoring:** Regularly scout your ginger fields, especially the undersides of leaves and tender shoots, to detect pest infestations early.

**2. Biological Control:**
*   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Many natural enemies like ladybird beetles, lacewings, hoverfly larvae, and parasitic wasps (e.g., *Aphelinus* species for whiteflies, *Aphidius* species for aphids) prey on or parasitize sucking pests. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.
*   **Biopesticides:** Consider using neem-based formulations (e.g., Azadirachtin 1500 ppm or 3000 ppm) at early stages of infestation. These act as antifeedants and growth regulators.

**3. Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved):**
When pest populations exceed economic threshold levels and cultural/biological methods are insufficient, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

Here are some CIBRC-approved technical chemicals effective against sucking pests in ginger:

*   **For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, Thrips:**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at 0.5 - 0.75 ml per litre of water (or 100-150 ml per acre in 200-300 litres of water).
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at 0.2 - 0.3 g per litre of water (or 40-60 g per acre in 200-300 litres of water).
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply at 0.2 - 0.3 g per litre of water (or 40-60 g per acre in 200-300 litres of water).
    *   **Fipronil 5% SC:** Apply at 1.5 - 2.0 ml per litre of water (or 300-400 ml per acre in 200-300 litres of water).

*   **Specifically for Whiteflies and Thrips (and also effective on other sucking pests):**
    *   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** Apply at 0.5 - 0.75 ml per litre of water (or 100-150 ml per acre in 200-300 litres of water).
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at 1.25 - 1.5 ml per litre of water (or 250-300 ml per acre in 200-300 litres of water), particularly effective against nymphs.

*   **For Aphids and Whiteflies:**
    *   **Pymetrozine 50% WG:** Apply at 0.3 - 0.4 g per litre of water (or 60-80 g per acre in 200-300 litres of water).

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Spray Coverage:** Ensure thorough coverage of the plant, especially the undersides of leaves where many sucking pests reside.
*   **Timing:** Spray during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   **Resistance Management:** Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action (indicated by different IRAC codes, usually mentioned on the product label) to prevent pests from developing resistance.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) like gloves, mask, and protective clothing while handling and spraying chemicals. Follow the instructions and waiting periods mentioned on the product label.
*   **Consult Local Experts:** For specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and current pest pressure, always consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts.

By adopting these scientifically verified practices, you can effectively manage sucking pests and ensure a healthy ginger crop.
