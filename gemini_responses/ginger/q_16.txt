As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified fertilizer doses for Ginger cultivation in Haryana, aiming for optimal yield and rhizome quality. These recommendations are based on typical soil conditions in the region and should be adjusted based on specific soil test reports.

A general recommendation for Ginger is to apply 100-120 kg Nitrogen (N), 60 kg Phosphorus (P2O5), and 60 kg Potassium (K2O) per acre, along with adequate Sulphur.

Here are the recommended doses for the specified fertilizers:

### **1. Conventional Fertilizers (Basal and Top Dressing)**

**Basal Application (at the time of planting):**
Mix thoroughly with the soil before planting or apply in furrows at planting.

*   **DAP (Di-ammonium Phosphate):** 130 kg per acre
    *   *Provides approximately 23.4 kg N and 59.8 kg P2O5.*
*   **Muriate of Potash (MOP):** 100 kg per acre
    *   *Provides approximately 60 kg K2O.*
*   **Elemental Sulphur (90%):** 25-30 kg per acre
    *   *Provides essential Sulphur for rhizome development and oil content.*
*   **Urea:** 50-60 kg per acre
    *   *Provides initial Nitrogen for early vegetative growth.*

**Top Dressing (Split Applications for Nitrogen):**
The remaining Nitrogen should be applied in two equal split doses to ensure continuous nutrient availability and minimize leaching losses.

*   **Urea (First Top Dressing):** 55-60 kg per acre
    *   *Apply at 60-75 days after planting, during active vegetative growth.*
*   **Urea (Second Top Dressing):** 55-60 kg per acre
    *   *Apply at 90-120 days after planting, coinciding with rhizome initiation and development.*

### **2. Nano Fertilizers (Foliar Application)**

Nano fertilizers are highly efficient and can supplement conventional fertilizers, especially during critical growth stages or to correct deficiencies.

*   **Nano-Urea:**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Application:** Apply as a foliar spray, typically 2-3 sprays during the vegetative growth phase (e.g., 45-60 days and 75-90 days after planting). A single spray typically uses 500 ml **Nano-Urea** per acre.
*   **Nano-DAP:**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Application:** Apply as a foliar spray, typically 1-2 sprays during the rhizome initiation and development stages (e.g., 75-90 days and 105-120 days after planting). A single spray typically uses 500 ml **Nano-DAP** per acre.

### **3. Other Fertilizers**

*   **NPK (Complex Fertilizers):**
    *   If using complex NPK fertilizers (e.g., 12:32:16, 10:26:26) for basal application, the dose will vary significantly based on the specific grade. It is generally recommended to use straight fertilizers for precise nutrient management.
    *   For foliar application, a balanced water-soluble **NPK (19:19:19)** can be used at a dose of 5 grams per litre of water during vegetative growth, if required.
*   **SSP (Single Super Phosphate):**
    *   **SSP** contains 16% P2O5 and 11% Sulphur. If **SSP** is used as the primary source of Phosphorus and Sulphur instead of **DAP** and **Elemental Sulphur**:
        *   **Dose:** Approximately 375 kg per acre (to provide 60 kg P2O5).
        *   *This quantity would also provide about 41 kg Sulphur, fulfilling the Sulphur requirement.*
        *   *If using **SSP**, the **Urea** dose would need to be increased to compensate for the N not supplied by **DAP** (total 100 kg N from **Urea**, which is approximately 217 kg **Urea** per acre, split into basal and two top dressings).*

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Soil Testing:** Always conduct a soil test before planting to determine the exact nutrient status of your field. This will allow for precise adjustments to these general recommendations.
*   **Organic Manures:** Supplementing with well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) at 20-25 tonnes per acre or vermicompost at 4-5 tonnes per acre is highly beneficial for soil health and nutrient availability.
*   **Micronutrients:** Ginger also requires micronutrients like Zinc, Boron, and Iron. Consider applying a micronutrient mixture as per soil test recommendations or a general application of 10 kg Zinc Sulphate per acre as basal.
