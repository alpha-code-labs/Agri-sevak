As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies in Ginger in Haryana:

### Control of Beetles in Ginger

This is not known to affect Ginger as a major economic pest requiring specific control measures. While some generalist beetles might occasionally feed on ginger foliage, they typically do not cause significant damage to warrant dedicated management strategies.

### Control of Weevils in Ginger

The primary weevil pest affecting ginger is the **Ginger Rhizome Weevil** (Prodioctes haematicus). This pest causes significant damage by boring into the rhizomes, both in the field and in storage, leading to rotting and reduced yield.

**Management Strategies:**

1.  **Cultural and Preventive Measures:**
    *   **Healthy Planting Material:** Always use healthy, uninfected rhizomes for planting. Inspect rhizomes thoroughly before planting and discard any showing signs of damage or infestation.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy all infested plant debris and rhizomes from the field after harvest to reduce carry-over populations.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops to break the pest cycle.
    *   **Timely Harvest:** Harvest ginger at maturity to prevent prolonged exposure to field infestations.
    *   **Storage:** Store harvested rhizomes in cool, dry, well-ventilated conditions after proper curing.

2.  **Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved):**

    *   **Rhizome Treatment (Pre-planting):**
        *   Before planting, dip ginger rhizomes in an insecticidal solution for 30 minutes to protect them from initial weevil attack.
        *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC**: 2.5 ml per litre of water.

    *   **Soil Drenching (Post-emergence/During growth):**
        *   If weevil infestation is observed in the field (e.g., wilting of shoots, yellowing), drench the soil around the base of the plants.
        *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC**: 2.5 litres per acre mixed in 500 litres of water, applied as a drench.
        *   **Fipronil 5% SC**: 1.5 - 2.0 litres per acre mixed in 500 litres of water, applied as a drench.

    *   **Foliar Spray (Against adult weevils, if observed):**
        *   In cases of severe adult weevil activity on foliage, a foliar spray can be considered.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC**: 0.5 ml per litre of water (200-250 ml per acre in 400-500 litres of water).

### Control of Sawflies in Ginger

This is not known to affect Ginger. Sawflies are not recognized as pests of ginger in India.
