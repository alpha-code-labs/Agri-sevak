As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Ginger cultivation in Haryana:

1.  **Grasshopper:**
    Grasshoppers are generalist feeders and can cause defoliation in ginger.
    *   **Cultural Control:** Hand-picking and destroying grasshopper nymphs and adults, especially during early stages of infestation.
    *   **Chemical Control:** In case of severe infestation, apply:
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC**: 100-125 ml per acre in 200-400 litres of water, ensuring thorough coverage of the foliage.

2.  **Painted bug (Bagrada hilaris):**
    This is not known to affect Ginger. Painted bug is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops.

3.  **Red cotton bug (Dysdercus cingulatus):**
    This is not known to affect Ginger. Red cotton bug is a major pest of cotton and other malvaceous plants.

4.  **Black ants:**
    While black ants are not primary pests that directly feed on ginger plants, they can be a nuisance by disturbing the soil around the rhizomes, or more importantly, by protecting other sap-sucking pests like aphids or mealybugs that *do* damage ginger. If their activity is significant and causing issues:
    *   **Chemical Control:** For controlling ant nests around the ginger plants:
        *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC**: Drench the ant mounds or around the base of affected plants with a solution of 2.5 ml per litre of water. Ensure the drench reaches the ant colony.
