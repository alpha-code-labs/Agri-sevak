Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide you with the scientifically verified recommendations for the ideal transplantation time, distance, and process for Ginger cultivation in Haryana.

### Ideal Transplantation Time for Ginger

The ideal time for planting ginger in Haryana is crucial for its successful establishment and growth, leveraging the monsoon season.

*   **Late May to Mid-June:** This period is optimal, allowing the rhizomes to sprout and establish before the heavy monsoon rains, and then benefit from the subsequent moisture and humidity. Planting with the onset of monsoon rains is also highly effective.

### Ideal Transplantation Distance for Ginger

Proper spacing ensures adequate light, air circulation, and nutrient availability for optimal rhizome development.

*   **Row-to-Row Distance:** Maintain a distance of **30-45 cm** between rows.
*   **Plant-to-Plant Distance:** Maintain a distance of **20-25 cm** between individual ginger rhizome pieces within a row.

### Ideal Transplantation Process for Ginger

A meticulous process from land preparation to initial care is vital for a healthy ginger crop.

1.  **Land Preparation:**
    *   **Ploughing:** Plough the field 2-3 times deeply to achieve a fine tilth and good aeration.
    *   **Organic Matter:** Incorporate 20-25 tonnes per acre of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost during the last ploughing.
    *   **Bed Preparation:** Prepare raised beds of about **15-20 cm** height and **1 meter** width. This is crucial for good drainage and preventing waterlogging, which ginger is highly susceptible to.

2.  **Rhizome Selection:**
    *   **Source:** Use healthy, disease-free rhizomes from a reliable source or your previous crop.
    *   **Size:** Select rhizome pieces weighing **15-20 grams** each, ensuring each piece has at least 2-3 healthy 'eyes' or sprouts.
    *   **Seed Rate:** Approximately **600-800 kg** of seed rhizomes are required per acre, depending on the size of the rhizome pieces and spacing.

3.  **Rhizome Treatment (Pre-planting):**
    *   To prevent seed-borne diseases, treat the rhizomes before planting.
    *   Dip the selected rhizome pieces in a solution of **Carbendazim** (0.1% i.e., 1 gram per litre of water) and **Mancozeb** (0.25% i.e., 2.5 grams per litre of water) for 30 minutes.
    *   After treatment, air-dry the rhizomes in the shade for a few hours before planting.

4.  **Planting:**
    *   Plant the treated rhizome pieces in shallow pits (**5-7 cm** deep) on the raised beds.
    *   Ensure the 'eyes' or sprouts are facing upwards or sideways.
    *   Cover the rhizomes with a thin layer of soil.

5.  **Mulching:**
    *   Immediately after planting, apply a layer of organic mulch (e.g., paddy straw, dry leaves, sugarcane trash) about **5-7 cm** thick over the beds.
    *   Mulching helps in conserving soil moisture, suppressing weed growth, regulating soil temperature, and improving soil structure.

6.  **Initial Irrigation:**
    *   If there are no immediate rains expected after planting, provide a light irrigation to ensure proper moisture for sprouting.

By following these guidelines, you can establish a healthy ginger crop and achieve good yields. For any further queries, please feel free to consult us.
