Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the critical importance of managing soil pests like termites and nematodes for successful ginger cultivation in Haryana. These pests can significantly reduce yield and rhizome quality. Here's a scientifically verified approach for their control:

### Control of Termites in Ginger

Termites (e.g., *Odontotermes obesus*) can cause direct damage to ginger rhizomes, leading to rotting and reduced market value.

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove all plant debris, stubble, and woody material from the field before planting, as these can serve as food sources and breeding sites for termites.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** Expose termite colonies to predators and sunlight by deep ploughing during summer fallow.
*   **Use of Well-Decomposed FYM:** Ensure that farmyard manure (FYM) or compost is thoroughly decomposed before application, as undecomposed organic matter can attract termites.

**2. Chemical Control (Pre-planting/At Planting):**
For effective control, chemical application should be done at the time of land preparation or planting.
*   **Fipronil 0.3% GR:** Apply **Fipronil** granules at 10-15 kg/acre by broadcasting and mixing thoroughly into the soil before planting, or as a band application in the furrows at planting.
*   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC:** Drench the soil with **Chlorpyrifos** at 2-4 litres per acre, mixed in 200-400 litres of water, during land preparation or as a spot drench around the planting pits.

### Control of Nematodes (Root-knot Nematodes) in Ginger

Root-knot nematodes (*Meloidogyne* spp.) are a major threat to ginger, causing galls on roots and rhizomes, stunting, yellowing, and significant yield reduction.

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Healthy Planting Material:** Always use certified nematode-free rhizomes for planting. Inspect rhizomes carefully for any galls or lesions.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops such as marigold, maize, sorghum, pearl millet, or mustard for at least 2-3 years. Avoid continuous ginger cultivation or rotation with susceptible crops like brinjal, tomato, or chilli.
*   **Summer Ploughing/Solarization:** Deep ploughing during the hot summer months exposes nematode eggs and larvae to lethal temperatures and desiccation. Soil solarization (covering moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks during peak summer) can effectively reduce nematode populations.
*   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost at 20-30 tonnes/acre, or neem cake at 200-400 kg/acre, into the soil 2-3 weeks before planting. These amendments improve soil health and promote beneficial microbial activity that can suppress nematodes.

**2. Biological Control:**
*   **Purpureocillium lilacinum (1% WP):** Apply **Purpureocillium lilacinum** (formerly *Paecilomyces lilacinus*) at 2-4 kg/acre. Mix the bio-nematicide with 100 kg of well-decomposed FYM or sand and apply uniformly to the soil at the time of planting. This fungus parasitizes nematode eggs and females.

**3. Chemical Control (At Planting):**
Chemical nematicides should be applied at the time of planting for effective control.
*   **Fluensulfone 2% GR:** Apply **Fluensulfone** granules at 10-15 kg/acre by broadcasting and mixing thoroughly into the soil before planting, or as a band application in the furrows at planting.
*   **Carbofuran 3% GR:** Apply **Carbofuran** granules at 10-15 kg/acre by broadcasting and mixing thoroughly into the soil at the time of planting. Ensure proper safety precautions during application.
*   **Phorate 10% GR:** As an alternative, **Phorate** granules can be applied at 4-6 kg/acre at the time of planting, mixed with the soil. (Note: Use of Phorate requires strict adherence to safety guidelines due to its toxicity).

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label for dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Integrate cultural, biological, and chemical methods for sustainable and effective pest management.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions.
