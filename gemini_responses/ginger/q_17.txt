As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend the following doses of organic manures and biostimulants for Ginger cultivation in Haryana to ensure optimal growth and yield:

*   **Farmyard Manure (FYM):**
    *   Apply **20-25 tonnes per acre** during land preparation, at least 2-3 weeks before planting. Ensure the FYM is well-decomposed to avoid nutrient lock-up and pest issues.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   Apply **4-5 tonnes per acre** during land preparation, or as a partial replacement for FYM (e.g., 50% FYM + 50% Vermicompost on a nutrient equivalent basis, though direct replacement is often done by weight at a lower rate for vermicompost due to higher nutrient concentration). It can also be applied as a top-dressing around the plants after sprouting.

*   **Sagarika (IFFCO's Seaweed Extract):**
    *   **Sagarika Granular:** Apply **8-10 kg per acre** at the time of planting or within 30-45 days of planting, mixed with other fertilizers or broadcast evenly.
    *   **Sagarika Liquid:** For foliar application, mix **250-500 ml per acre** in 150-200 litres of water and spray during critical growth stages (e.g., 30-45 days after planting, and again 60-75 days after planting). This acts as a biostimulant to enhance nutrient uptake and plant vigour.
