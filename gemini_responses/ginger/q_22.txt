As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following cultivation practices for Ginger in Haryana:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   Ginger is propagated vegetatively using small pieces of rhizomes called 'setts'.
    *   The most common and recommended method for ginger cultivation in Haryana is planting on **ridges and furrows** or **raised beds**. This method ensures proper drainage, prevents waterlogging, and facilitates earthing up operations.
    *   Alternatively, flatbed planting can be done, but it requires careful management of drainage and subsequent earthing up to form ridges.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   The ginger rhizome setts should be planted at a shallow depth of **3-5 cm** from the soil surface. Planting too deep can delay germination and affect establishment.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   Optimal spacing is crucial for good yield and rhizome development.
    *   For planting on ridges and furrows:
        *   **Row-to-row spacing:** 30-45 cm
        *   **Plant-to-plant spacing (within the row):** 15-20 cm

*   **Seed Dose (Seed Rate):**
    *   The seed rate depends on the size of the rhizome setts and the spacing adopted.
    *   Use healthy, disease-free rhizome setts, each weighing approximately 20-25 g and having at least one or two healthy buds.
    *   The recommended seed dose is typically **1500-2000 kg of rhizomes per acre**.
