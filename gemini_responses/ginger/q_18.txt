As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the use of growth regulators and micronutrients in Ginger for Haryana conditions:

It is important to note that while some substances are plant growth regulators (hormones), others are essential micronutrients. The recommendations are based on their known effects and approved uses in ginger cultivation.

1.  **Ethephon (Ethrel):**
    *   **Ethephon** is a plant growth regulator that releases ethylene. While ethylene influences various plant processes, its application as a growth regulator for enhancing rhizome yield or vegetative growth in ginger in the field is **not a standard recommendation** in Haryana or by ICAR. Its primary agricultural uses are often related to fruit ripening, defoliation, or sprout suppression in other crops. Therefore, a recommended dose for growth regulation in ginger is not available.

2.  **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D):**
    *   **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid** is a synthetic auxin. While auxins are plant hormones, 2,4-D is primarily known and used as a selective herbicide for broadleaf weeds. Applying **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid** to ginger as a growth regulator for beneficial effects on yield or growth is **not recommended**. Even at very low concentrations, it can cause phytotoxicity and severe damage to the ginger crop. Therefore, there is no recommended dose for its use as a growth regulator in ginger.

3.  **Boron:**
    *   Boron is a crucial micronutrient essential for proper rhizome development, cell wall formation, sugar transport, and overall plant health in ginger. It is not a hormone but is vital for healthy growth and yield.
    *   **Recommended Dose (Foliar Application):**
        *   Apply **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** at 1.0 - 1.5 kg per acre, dissolved in 200-300 liters of water.
        *   Alternatively, **Sodium tetraborate decahydrate** (Borax) can be used at 2.0 - 3.0 kg per acre, dissolved in 200-300 liters of water.
    *   **Timing:** Two to three foliar sprays are generally recommended:
        *   First spray: 45-60 days after planting.
        *   Second spray: 90-100 days after planting.
        *   (Optional) Third spray: 120-130 days after planting, especially in soils known to be deficient.
    *   **Note:** Soil application of Boron can also be considered at the time of planting if soil tests indicate severe deficiency, typically 5-10 kg of **Sodium tetraborate decahydrate** per acre. However, foliar application is often more efficient for quick uptake and correction of deficiencies. Always conduct a soil test to determine the actual boron status of your field before application.
