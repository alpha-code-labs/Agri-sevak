Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I will provide scientifically verified advice for managing the pests you've mentioned in Coriander.

Here's how to control these conditions:

*   **Borers:**
    While general stem borers are not a primary or commonly recognized pest of coriander, the Gram Pod Borer (*Helicoverpa armigera*) is a significant caterpillar pest that bores into developing seeds and fruits. Its control measures are covered under the 'Caterpillars' section below.

*   **Caterpillars (including Gram Pod Borer/Fruit Borer - *Helicoverpa armigera*, Tobacco Caterpillar - *Spodoptera litura*, Beet Armyworm - *Spodoptera exigua*):**
    Caterpillars are a significant pest complex in coriander, causing defoliation and damage to developing seeds. Integrated pest management strategies are recommended:
    *   **Cultural Practices:**
        *   Regular field monitoring to detect early infestations.
        *   Hand-picking and destroying larvae in small areas.
        *   Maintaining field hygiene.
    *   **Biological Control:**
        *   Application of bio-pesticides containing **Bacillus thuringiensis** (Bt) formulations at 1-2 kg/acre or 1-2 g/L of water, especially effective against young larvae.
        *   Conservation and augmentation of natural enemies like parasitic wasps and predatory bugs.
    *   **Chemical Control (Use only CIBRC approved technical chemicals):**
        In case of severe infestation, consider spraying with one of the following CIBRC approved insecticides:
        *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC: 60 ml per acre (mixed in 200-300 litres of water).
        *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG: 88-100 g per acre (mixed in 200-300 litres of water).
        *   **Flubendiamide** 20% WG: 50 g per acre (mixed in 200-300 litres of water).
        *   **Indoxacarb** 14.5% SC: 200 ml per acre (mixed in 200-300 litres of water).
        *   **Novaluron** 10% EC: 300 ml per acre (mixed in 200-300 litres of water).
        *   Always follow the label instructions for dosage, application method, and pre-harvest interval (PHI). Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

*   **Diamondback moth (*Plutella xylostella*):**
    This is not known to affect Coriander. Diamondback moth is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops like cabbage, cauliflower, and mustard.

*   **Leaf folder:**
    This is not known to affect Coriander as a specific pest. While generalist caterpillars (covered above) might occasionally cause some leaf damage or webbing, a dedicated "leaf folder" pest is not common in coriander.

For any further clarification or specific field issues, please consult your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts.
