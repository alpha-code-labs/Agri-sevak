As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an integrated pest management (IPM) approach for controlling sucking pests in coriander, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods.

First, regarding one of the pests mentioned:
*   **Psylla:** This is not known to affect Coriander.

For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips, follow these guidelines:

**I. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies:**

1.  **Monitoring:** Regularly scout your coriander fields for the presence of pests, their population levels, and signs of damage. Pay close attention to the undersides of leaves and new growth.
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the field and surrounding areas free of weeds, as they can serve as alternate hosts for these pests.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush, succulent growth that is more attractive to sucking pests.
    *   **Water Management:** Ensure proper irrigation to maintain plant vigor, as stressed plants are more susceptible.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation to break pest cycles.
    *   **Reflective Mulches:** In some cases, reflective mulches can deter winged pests like aphids and whiteflies.
3.  **Physical Barriers:**
    *   **Yellow Sticky Traps:** Install yellow sticky traps (10-15 traps per acre) to monitor and mass trap adult whiteflies and leafhoppers.
4.  **Biological Control:**
    *   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Protect and encourage natural predators like ladybird beetles, lacewings, syrphid fly larvae, and parasitic wasps, which feed on aphids and other soft-bodied insects.
    *   **Biopesticides:** At early stages of infestation, consider using biopesticides.

**II. Chemical Control (When pest populations exceed economic thresholds):**

When chemical intervention becomes necessary, choose CIBRC-approved insecticides and rotate them to prevent resistance development. Always ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves.

*   **For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips:**

    *   **Azadirachtin** 1500 ppm: 2.5-5 ml/L of water (effective as a repellent and growth disruptor, especially at early stages).
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: 0.5-0.75 ml/L of water.
    *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: 0.2-0.4 g/L of water.
    *   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP: 0.2-0.4 g/L of water.
    *   **Flonicamid** 50% WG: 0.3 g/L of water (particularly effective against aphids and whiteflies).
    *   **Pymetrozine** 50% WG: 0.3-0.4 g/L of water (selective aphicide).
    *   **Spiromesifen** 22.9% SC: 0.5-0.75 ml/L of water (effective against whiteflies, thrips, and mites).
    *   **Spirotetramat** 150 OD: 0.75-1 ml/L of water (systemic, effective against whiteflies, aphids, and thrips).
    *   **Buprofezin** 25% SC: 1.25-1.5 ml/L of water (Insect Growth Regulator, primarily targets whitefly nymphs and hoppers).
    *   **Dimethoate** 30% EC: 1.5-2 ml/L of water (an older systemic insecticide, use with caution and check for any local restrictions).

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Rotation of Chemicals:** To prevent the development of pesticide resistance, always rotate insecticides with different modes of action.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Strictly observe the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) mentioned on the pesticide label before harvesting coriander.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying. Follow all instructions and safety precautions on the product label.
*   **Local Advice:** For the most current and specific recommendations tailored to your exact location and prevailing pest situation, it is always advisable to consult with local agricultural extension officers or experts at HAU, Hisar.
