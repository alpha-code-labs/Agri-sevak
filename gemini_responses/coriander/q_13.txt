As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm the following regarding your query:

This is not known to affect Coriander.

Fruit flies (e.g., *Bactrocera* species) and Ber fly (*Carpomyia vesuviana*) primarily infest fleshy fruits of various horticultural crops like mango, guava, ber, cucurbits, tomato, and brinjal. Coriander is grown for its leaves and dry seeds (which are botanically schizocarps, not fleshy fruits), and these pests do not typically infest coriander plants or their seeds.
