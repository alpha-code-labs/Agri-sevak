Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

Addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium) in Coriander is crucial for healthy growth and good yield. As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend the following scientifically verified practices for Haryana:

**General Recommendation:**
The most accurate way to determine nutrient deficiencies and required quantities is through **soil testing**. We strongly advise getting your soil tested at the nearest Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or HAU laboratory. Visual symptoms are indicators, but soil testing provides precise data for tailored recommendations.

**1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency:**
*   **Symptoms:** General yellowing of older leaves, stunted growth, pale green foliage, reduced leaf size, and overall poor vigor.
*   **Correction:**
    *   Nitrogen is highly mobile in the soil and is required throughout the growth cycle. It should be applied in split doses to minimize losses and ensure continuous availability.
    *   **Basal Application:** Apply a portion of Nitrogen at the time of sowing.
    *   **Top-dressing:** Apply the remaining Nitrogen in one or two splits, typically 20-30 days after sowing, depending on crop growth and visual symptoms.
    *   **Recommended Chemical:**
        *   **Urea** (46% Nitrogen)
    *   **Application Rate:** 20-30 kg Nitrogen per acre (equivalent to approximately 43-65 kg **Urea** per acre) in split doses.

**2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency:**
*   **Symptoms:** Purplish discoloration of older leaves and stems, stunted growth, poor root development, delayed maturity, and reduced flowering/seed set.
*   **Correction:**
    *   Phosphorus is relatively immobile in the soil, so it should be applied as a basal dose and thoroughly incorporated into the soil before sowing to ensure it is available in the root zone.
    *   **Recommended Chemicals:**
        *   **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5)
        *   **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% Nitrogen, 46% P2O5)
    *   **Application Rate:** 15-20 kg P2O5 per acre.
        *   If using **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)**: Approximately 94-125 kg **SSP** per acre.
        *   If using **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)**: Approximately 33-43 kg **DAP** per acre (adjust for Nitrogen contribution if using DAP).

**3. Potassium (K) Deficiency:**
*   **Symptoms:** Yellowing and browning/scorching of leaf margins (especially older leaves), weak stems, poor seed development, increased susceptibility to lodging and diseases, and reduced stress tolerance.
*   **Correction:**
    *   Potassium should primarily be applied as a basal dose and incorporated into the soil before sowing. In severe cases, a small top-dressing might be considered, but basal application is most effective.
    *   **Recommended Chemical:**
        *   **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** (Potassium Chloride, 60% K2O)
    *   **Application Rate:** 10-15 kg K2O per acre (equivalent to approximately 17-25 kg **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** per acre).

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management:** Supplement chemical fertilizers with well-decomposed Farmyard Manure (FYM) or compost (5-10 tonnes per acre) to improve soil health, water retention, and nutrient availability.
*   **Watering:** Always ensure adequate soil moisture after fertilizer application for proper nutrient uptake by the plants. Nitrogen top-dressing should be done when the soil is moist or followed by light irrigation.
*   **Timing:** Apply basal fertilizers before sowing and incorporate them well into the soil.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively manage macro-nutrient deficiencies in your Coriander crop and ensure a healthy and productive harvest.
