As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the maturity signs, harvesting time, and cutting process for Coriander (Dhania) in Haryana.

Coriander is harvested for both its leaves (as a herb) and its seeds (as a spice). The maturity signs and harvesting processes differ significantly for these two purposes.

### Maturity Signs

**For Leaf Harvest (Green Coriander):**
*   Plants develop sufficient foliage, typically 30-40 days after sowing.
*   Leaves are tender, green, and aromatic.
*   Harvesting should ideally be done before the plants start to bolt (flower), as leaf quality deteriorates after flowering.

**For Seed Harvest (Coriander Seeds):**
*   The crop typically matures in 90-110 days after sowing, depending on the variety and prevailing weather conditions.
*   **Color Change:** The most prominent sign is when 50-70% of the fruits (schizocarps) in the umbels turn from green to yellowish-brown.
*   **Drying of Foliage:** The lower leaves start to turn yellow and dry, and the entire plant begins to show signs of drying.
*   **Seed Hardness:** The seeds become firm and hard when pressed.
*   **Aroma:** A characteristic strong aroma develops in the maturing seeds.

### Harvesting Time

**For Leaf Harvest:**
*   The first cutting can be done when plants are 30-40 days old and have attained a height of 15-20 cm with sufficient foliage.
*   Subsequent cuttings can be taken at intervals of 15-20 days, depending on growth, usually up to 2-3 cuttings before the plant is allowed to flower for seed production.

**For Seed Harvest:**
*   Harvesting should be done when 50-70% of the fruits have turned yellowish-brown.
*   Delaying harvest too much can lead to significant seed shattering and yield loss, especially during hot, windy conditions.
*   Harvesting is best done in the early morning hours when dew is present, as this minimizes seed shattering.

### Cutting Process

**For Leaf Harvest:**
*   Plants are cut 2-3 cm above the ground level using a sharp knife or sickle. This allows for regeneration and subsequent cuttings.
*   The harvested leaves are then bundled and marketed fresh.

**For Seed Harvest:**
*   **Manual Harvesting:** The most common method in Haryana. Plants are cut close to the ground level (about 5-10 cm from the soil surface) using sickles.
*   **Bundling and Drying:** The cut plants are gathered into small bundles and tied. These bundles are then stacked upright in the field or on a clean threshing floor for 5-7 days to allow for further drying and curing. This process helps in uniform drying of seeds and prevents premature shattering.
*   **Threshing:** Once the plants are thoroughly dry, threshing is performed. This can be done by:
    *   Beating the bundles with sticks.
    *   Trampling by bullocks.
    *   Using mechanical threshers (e.g., multi-crop thresher with appropriate adjustments).
*   **Winnowing and Cleaning:** After threshing, the seeds are separated from the chaff and other debris by winnowing.
*   **Final Drying:** The cleaned seeds should be further dried in the sun to achieve a moisture content of 8-10% before storage to prevent fungal growth and maintain quality.
