As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Scale insects and Mealybugs in Coriander in Haryana:

**Scale Insects:**
This is not known to affect Coriander.

**Mealybugs:**
Mealybugs can occasionally infest coriander, especially under conditions of high humidity or in protected cultivation. While generally considered a minor pest, severe infestations can lead to stunted growth and reduced yield. An Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is recommended for effective and sustainable control.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Mealybugs in Coriander:**

1.  **Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
    *   **Regular Monitoring:** Frequently inspect coriander plants, especially the undersides of leaves and stem joints, for early detection of mealybug colonies.
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the field free of weeds, as many weeds can act as alternate hosts for mealybugs.
    *   **Pruning and Removal:** Remove and destroy severely infested plant parts or individual plants to prevent further spread.
    *   **Water Spray:** For small infestations, a strong jet of water can dislodge mealybugs from the plants.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation to break the pest cycle.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Encourage natural enemies such as ladybird beetles (e.g., *Cryptolaemus montrouzieri*), lacewings, and parasitic wasps. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that can harm these beneficial insects.

3.  **Chemical Control (Only if necessary and as a last resort):**
    If mealybug infestation is severe and other methods are insufficient, CIBRC-approved insecticides can be used. Always ensure thorough spray coverage, as mealybugs are often protected by their waxy coating.

    *   **For early stages of infestation or as an Insect Growth Regulator (IGR):**
        *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at a rate of 1.25 L per acre (or 2.5 ml per litre of water). This acts by inhibiting chitin synthesis, affecting molting.
    *   **For direct control of active infestations (systemic action):**
        *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply at a rate of 100-125 g per acre (or 0.5 g per litre of water). This is a systemic insecticide effective against sucking pests.

    **Important Considerations for Chemical Application:**
    *   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always check the label for the specific Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) of the chosen chemical for coriander or leafy vegetables. Do not spray close to harvest to avoid residues in the edible parts.
    *   **Safety:** Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying.
    *   **Rotation of Chemicals:** To prevent the development of resistance, rotate insecticides with different modes of action if multiple applications are required.
    *   **Spray Coverage:** Ensure good spray coverage, especially targeting the undersides of leaves and hidden areas where mealybugs tend to congregate.
    *   **Adjuvants:** The addition of a non-ionic spreader/sticker may improve the efficacy of the spray by helping it penetrate the waxy coating of mealybugs.

Always consult the latest recommendations from HAU or your local agricultural extension office for the most current and specific advice for your region and crop conditions.
