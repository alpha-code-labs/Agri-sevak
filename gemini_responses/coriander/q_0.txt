As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Coriander in Haryana.

Effective management of fungal diseases in coriander requires an integrated approach combining cultural practices and judicious use of CIBRC-approved fungicides.

**General Integrated Disease Management Principles:**

1.  **Use Disease-Free Seeds:** Always source certified disease-free seeds. Seed treatment can be beneficial.
2.  **Crop Rotation:** Avoid continuous cultivation of coriander or other susceptible crops in the same field. Rotate with non-host crops for at least 2-3 years.
3.  **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest to reduce inoculum for the next season.
4.  **Proper Spacing:** Maintain adequate plant spacing to ensure good air circulation, which helps reduce humidity and fungal growth.
5.  **Balanced Nutrition:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can promote lush, susceptible growth. Ensure balanced nutrient supply.
6.  **Irrigation Management:** Irrigate in the morning to allow foliage to dry quickly. Avoid overhead irrigation late in the day.

**Specific Control Measures for Fungal Diseases in Coriander:**

Here's how to address the mentioned diseases:

*   **Alternaria (Alternaria Blight/Leaf Spot):**
    This is a common and significant disease in coriander, causing dark, concentric spots on leaves, stems, and umbels, leading to blight.
    *   **Cultural:** Use resistant varieties if available. Practice good field sanitation.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   Spray with **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2.0-2.5 kg/acre (2.5 g/L water).
        *   Alternatively, use **Chlorothalonil** (75% WP) at 2.0 kg/acre (2.5 g/L water).
        *   For systemic action, consider **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC) at 200 ml/acre (0.5 ml/L water) or **Propiconazole** (25% EC) at 200 ml/acre (0.5 ml/L water).
        *   Repeat sprays at 10-15 day intervals depending on disease severity.

*   **Anthracnose:**
    Caused by *Colletotrichum gloeosporioides*, this disease leads to sunken lesions on stems, leaves, and fruits, often with pinkish spore masses in humid conditions.
    *   **Cultural:** Use disease-free seeds. Practice crop rotation.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   Spray with **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2.0-2.5 kg/acre (2.5 g/L water).
        *   Alternatively, use **Chlorothalonil** (75% WP) at 2.0 kg/acre (2.5 g/L water).
        *   For systemic control, **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC) at 200 ml/acre (0.5 ml/L water) or **Tebuconazole** (25.9% EC) at 200 ml/acre (0.5 ml/L water) can be effective.
        *   Initiate sprays at the first sign of disease and repeat as necessary.

*   **Blast:**
    This is not known to affect Coriander.

*   **Blight (General Blight, e.g., Cercospora Blight):**
    Blight is a general term for rapid and extensive browning, death, and wilting of plant tissues. *Cercospora leaf spot* can also cause blight-like symptoms.
    *   **Cultural:** As mentioned above for Alternaria.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   Fungicides effective against Alternaria and Anthracnose are generally effective against other blights and leaf spots.
        *   Spray with **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2.0-2.5 kg/acre (2.5 g/L water).
        *   Alternatively, use **Chlorothalonil** (75% WP) at 2.0 kg/acre (2.5 g/L water).
        *   Systemic options include **Propiconazole** (25% EC) at 200 ml/acre (0.5 ml/L water) or **Tebuconazole** (25.9% EC) at 200 ml/acre (0.5 ml/L water).

*   **Brown Spot (e.g., Cercospora Leaf Spot, Ramularia Leaf Spot):**
    These diseases cause distinct brown spots on leaves, which can coalesce and lead to defoliation.
    *   **Cultural:** Use disease-free seeds. Remove infected plant debris.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   Similar to blight control, contact fungicides like **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2.0-2.5 kg/acre (2.5 g/L water) or **Chlorothalonil** (75% WP) at 2.0 kg/acre (2.5 g/L water) are effective.
        *   Systemic options like **Propiconazole** (25% EC) at 200 ml/acre (0.5 ml/L water) or **Tebuconazole** (25.9% EC) at 200 ml/acre (0.5 ml/L water) can also be used.

*   **Downy Mildew:**
    Caused by *Peronospora coriandri*, this disease appears as yellowish spots on the upper leaf surface and a grayish-purple, downy growth on the corresponding lower surface.
    *   **Cultural:** Use resistant varieties. Ensure good air circulation. Avoid overhead irrigation.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   For preventive and early stage control, **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2.0-2.5 kg/acre (2.5 g/L water).
        *   For curative and systemic action, use a combination product like **Metalaxyl + Mancozeb** (e.g., 8% + 64% WP) at 500 g/acre (1.5-2.0 g/L water).
        *   Another effective combination is **Dimethomorph + Mancozeb** (e.g., 9% + 60% WP) at 1.0 kg/acre (2.5 g/L water).
        *   **Propamocarb Hydrochloride** (72.2% SL) at 1.0-1.5 L/acre (2.5-3.0 ml/L water) is also effective.
        *   Start spraying as soon as symptoms appear or when conditions are favorable for disease development.

*   **Powdery Mildew:**
    Caused by *Erysiphe polygoni* or *Leveillula taurica*, this disease manifests as white, powdery patches on leaves, stems, and flower parts, leading to reduced photosynthesis and yield.
    *   **Cultural:** Use resistant varieties. Maintain proper plant spacing.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   **Wettable Sulphur** (80% WP) at 2.0-2.5 kg/acre (2.5-3.0 g/L water) is a traditional and effective option.
        *   **Dinocarb** (48% EC) at 200-250 ml/acre (0.5 ml/L water).
        *   **Myclobutanil** (10% WP) at 120 g/acre (0.3 g/L water).
        *   **Penconazole** (10% EC) at 100-150 ml/acre (0.25-0.3 ml/L water).
        *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC) at 200 ml/acre (0.5 ml/L water) also provides good control.
        *   **Tebuconazole** (25.9% EC) at 200 ml/acre (0.5 ml/L water).
        *   Apply at the first sign of the disease and repeat at 10-15 day intervals.

*   **Grey Mildew:**
    This is not known to affect Coriander. (Note: *Botrytis cinerea* causes Grey Mold, which is a different disease and typically affects senescing tissues or during storage).

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the fungicide label, including dosage, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and safety precautions.
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and current disease pressure.
