As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified practices to improve yield, fruit quality, and storage life for coriander in Haryana:

### I. Improving Yield

1.  **Variety Selection:**
    *   Choose high-yielding varieties suitable for Haryana's agro-climatic conditions, such as HC-1, HC-5, Pant Haritma, RCR-41, or RCR-435.
2.  **Optimal Sowing Time and Method:**
    *   **Sowing Time:** Mid-October to mid-November is ideal for grain production.
    *   **Spacing:** Maintain a row-to-row distance of 30 cm and plant-to-plant distance of 10-15 cm.
    *   **Seed Rate:** Use 10-12 kg of seed per acre for grain production.
3.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Nitrogen (N):** Apply 20-25 kg N per acre (e.g., through Urea). Apply half N and full P, K, S at sowing, and the remaining N as top dressing 30-40 days after sowing.
    *   **Phosphorus (P):** Apply 12-16 kg P2O5 per acre (e.g., through DAP or SSP).
    *   **Potassium (K):** Apply 8-10 kg K2O per acre (e.g., through Muriate of Potash).
    *   **Sulphur (S):** Apply 8 kg S per acre (e.g., through Gypsum or SSP), as it significantly impacts essential oil content and yield.
    *   **Micronutrients:** If deficiencies are observed or suspected based on soil tests:
        *   **Zinc:** Foliar spray of **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** @ 0.5% solution (500 g in 100 L water) at branching and pre-flowering stages.
        *   **Boron:** Foliar spray of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** @ 0.2% solution (200 g in 100 L water) at pre-flowering stage.
4.  **Irrigation:**
    *   Provide 2-3 light irrigations. Critical stages are branching, flowering, and grain filling. Avoid waterlogging.
5.  **Weed Management:**
    *   **Pre-emergence:** Apply **Pendimethalin** @ 1.0 kg a.i./acre (e.g., 3.3 L of 30% EC in 200-300 L water/acre) within 3 days of sowing.
    *   **Post-emergence:** One or two hand weedings at 30 and 60 days after sowing are highly effective.
6.  **Pest and Disease Management (General for Yield Protection):**
    *   **Aphids:** If infestation is observed, spray **Imidacloprid** @ 0.5 ml/L or **Thiamethoxam** @ 0.2 g/L.
    *   **Powdery Mildew:** If symptoms appear, spray **Wettable Sulphur** @ 2.5 g/L or **Myclobutanil** @ 0.4 g/L.
    *   **Wilt:** To prevent wilt, treat seeds with **Carbendazim** @ 2 g/kg seed before sowing.

### II. Improving Fruit Quality

1.  **Variety Selection:**
    *   Choose varieties known for bold seeds, good essential oil content, and desirable aroma, such as RCR-435 or Pant Haritma.
2.  **Balanced Nutrient Management:**
    *   Ensure adequate supply of Potassium (K) for proper seed development and Sulphur (S) for essential oil synthesis. Boron (B) is also crucial for pollen viability and good seed set, contributing to well-filled fruits.
3.  **Optimal Irrigation:**
    *   Maintain consistent soil moisture, especially during flowering and fruit development stages. Both water stress and excessive moisture can negatively impact fruit size and quality.
4.  **Pest and Disease Control:**
    *   Protect developing fruits from pests like aphids, which can cause shriveling, and diseases like powdery mildew, which can reduce photosynthetic efficiency and thus fruit filling. Follow the recommendations under Yield Improvement.
5.  **Timely Harvesting:**
    *   Harvest the crop at physiological maturity when 70-80% of the fruits turn yellowish-brown. Harvesting too early results in immature, shriveled fruits with lower essential oil content, while delayed harvesting can lead to shattering and loss of quality.

### III. Improving Storage Life

1.  **Proper Harvesting:**
    *   Harvest at the correct maturity stage (70-80% fruits yellowish-brown). This ensures optimal moisture content for drying and minimizes post-harvest losses.
2.  **Thorough Drying:**
    *   After harvesting, spread the coriander plants on a clean, dry threshing floor in the sun for 5-7 days. This reduces the moisture content of the seeds to 8-10%, which is critical for safe storage.
    *   Threshing should be done carefully to avoid mechanical damage to the seeds, as damaged seeds are more susceptible to pest and fungal attack.
3.  **Cleaning and Grading:**
    *   Clean the threshed seeds thoroughly to remove all chaff, dust, stones, immature seeds, and other foreign matter. Use sieves and winnowing.
4.  **Appropriate Storage Conditions:**
    *   Store the dried and cleaned seeds in clean, dry, airtight containers such as metal bins, plastic drums, or jute bags lined with polythene.
    *   Store in a cool, dry, well-ventilated place, away from direct sunlight and moisture.
    *   Regularly inspect stored seeds for any signs of pest infestation or fungal growth.
5.  **Pest Management in Storage:**
    *   For large-scale storage, fumigation can be employed by trained personnel using **Aluminium phosphide** tablets @ 1-2 tablets (3g each) per tonne of grain for 5-7 days under airtight conditions. This is a restricted pesticide and requires strict safety protocols.
    *   For small-scale farm storage, ensuring proper drying, cleaning, and using airtight containers are the primary methods. Periodically sun-drying the seeds can also help deter pests.
