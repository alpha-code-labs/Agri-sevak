Namaste Kisan bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I will provide scientifically verified advice regarding the control of Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies in Coriander in Haryana.

### Sawflies
This is not known to affect Coriander.

### Weevils
This is not known to affect Coriander.

### Beetles
While many beetle species are not primary pests of coriander, **Flea Beetles** (e.g., *Phyllotreta* spp.) can occasionally infest young coriander plants, causing characteristic shot-hole damage on leaves. If their population is high, especially during the early growth stages, they can affect plant stand and vigor.

**Control Measures for Flea Beetles in Coriander:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove crop residues and weeds that can harbor pests.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting coriander or other susceptible crops (like mustard, radish) in the same field consecutively.
    *   **Timely Sowing:** Sowing at the recommended time can help plants establish before peak pest activity.
    *   **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect young plants for signs of flea beetle damage.

2.  **Chemical Control (if necessary and after careful assessment):**
    *   For effective control, especially when pest pressure is high, the following CIBRC-approved insecticides can be considered. Always follow the label instructions for dosage, application method, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).

    *   **Azadirachtin 1500 ppm (Neem-based formulation):**
        *   Dosage: 5-10 ml per liter of water (or 1-2 Litres per acre in 200-400 Litres of water).
        *   Application: Spray thoroughly, ensuring good coverage, especially on young plants. Repeat as needed. This is a good option for early infestations and organic farming practices.

    *   **Cypermethrin 25% EC:**
        *   Dosage: 0.5 ml per liter of water (or 200-250 ml per acre in 200-400 Litres of water).
        *   Application: Spray when flea beetle damage is observed. Ensure complete coverage.

    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:**
        *   Dosage: 0.5 ml per liter of water (or 100-150 ml per acre in 200-400 Litres of water).
        *   Application: Apply as a foliar spray upon observing pest incidence.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the pesticide label, including dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
*   For coriander, which is often consumed fresh, prioritize cultural methods and biological options like Azadirachtin. If chemical control is necessary, choose products with shorter PHI and ensure the crop is harvested only after the specified PHI.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions.
