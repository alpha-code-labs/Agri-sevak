As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for the ideal transplantation time, distance, and process for Coriander in Haryana:

While direct sowing is a very common and often preferred method for coriander cultivation, transplanting can be beneficial for achieving uniform stand establishment and better utilization of seeds, especially for high-value varieties or when early establishment is desired.

Here are the recommendations for transplanting coriander:

### Ideal Transplantation Time

*   **Rabi Season:** The ideal time for transplanting coriander in Haryana is during the Rabi season.
*   **Optimal Window:** Late October to early December is generally suitable. This period ensures that the seedlings establish well before the peak of severe winter cold and benefit from the cool, dry weather preferred by coriander. Avoid transplanting during periods of extreme frost or high temperatures.

### Ideal Transplantation Distance

Maintaining proper spacing is crucial for optimal plant growth, air circulation, and yield.

*   **Row-to-Row Spacing:** 20-30 cm
*   **Plant-to-Plant Spacing:** 10-15 cm

### Ideal Transplantation Process

1.  **Nursery Raising:**
    *   Sow coriander seeds in well-prepared nursery beds or seedling trays.
    *   Ensure the nursery medium is well-drained and rich in organic matter.
    *   Seeds should be split into two halves before sowing to improve germination.
    *   Keep the nursery moist but not waterlogged.
2.  **Seedling Age:**
    *   Seedlings are typically ready for transplanting when they are 3-4 weeks old, or have developed 3-4 true leaves. At this stage, they are robust enough to withstand transplanting shock.
3.  **Hardening Off:**
    *   About 7-10 days before transplanting, gradually harden off the seedlings. This involves reducing irrigation frequency and exposing them to outdoor conditions for longer periods each day. This process helps them adapt to the harsher field environment and reduces transplant shock.
4.  **Field Preparation:**
    *   Prepare the main field thoroughly by ploughing, harrowing, and levelling.
    *   Ensure the soil is well-pulverized and free of weeds.
    *   Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost during field preparation.
    *   Create shallow furrows or mark lines according to the recommended row spacing.
5.  **Transplanting:**
    *   Transplant seedlings preferably in the late afternoon or on a cloudy day to minimize stress from direct sunlight.
    *   Carefully lift seedlings from the nursery with a small ball of earth around their roots to prevent root damage.
    *   Plant the seedlings at the same depth they were in the nursery.
    *   Gently firm the soil around the base of each seedling to ensure good root-to-soil contact.
6.  **Post-Transplanting Care:**
    *   Immediately after transplanting, provide light irrigation to settle the soil around the roots and reduce transplant shock.
    *   Monitor the transplanted field for wilting and provide additional light irrigation if necessary during the first few days.
    *   Keep the field free of weeds, especially during the initial establishment phase.
