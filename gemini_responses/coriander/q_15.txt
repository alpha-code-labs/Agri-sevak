As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Coriander in Haryana:

### Control of Pests in Coriander

**1. Grasshopper**
Grasshoppers are polyphagous pests that can cause significant defoliation in coriander by feeding on leaves and tender shoots.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Undertake deep ploughing during summer months to expose and destroy grasshopper eggs laid in the soil.
    *   Maintain field sanitation by removing weeds and crop residues that can serve as breeding sites and alternate hosts.
*   **Chemical Control (for severe infestations):**
    *   Spray with **Malathion 50 EC** @ 1.25 L per acre in 200-400 L of water.
    *   Alternatively, spray with **Quinalphos 25 EC** @ 1.0 L per acre in 200-400 L of water.

**2. Painted bug (Bagrada hilaris)**
This is not known to affect Coriander. Painted bug is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., mustard, cabbage, radish).

**3. Red cotton bug (Dysdercus cingulatus)**
This is not known to affect Coriander. Red cotton bug is a major pest of cotton and other malvaceous plants, feeding on developing seeds.

**4. Black ants**
This is not known to affect Coriander as a direct pest causing significant damage to the crop itself. While ants may be present in the field, they typically do not feed on coriander plants or cause economic damage. If ants are observed in association with other pests like aphids (feeding on honeydew), the primary focus should be on controlling the aphid population.
