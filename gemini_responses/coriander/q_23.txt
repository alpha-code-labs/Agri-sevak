As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified seed and soil treatment processes for Coriander cultivation in Haryana to ensure healthy crop establishment and mitigate common pest and disease issues:

### Recommended Seed Treatment Process for Coriander

Seed treatment is crucial for protecting seeds and young seedlings from seed-borne and early soil-borne diseases, as well as initial insect pest attacks.

*   **Purpose:** To protect against seed-borne diseases (e.g., wilt, damping-off, stem gall) and early seedling pests (e.g., aphids, thrips).

*   **Recommendations:**

    *   **Fungicidal Treatment (Essential for disease prevention):**
        *   Apply **Carbendazim** 50% WP @ 2 grams per kg of seed.
        *   **OR** Apply **Thiram** 75% WS @ 2.5-3 grams per kg of seed.
        *   **OR** For a broader spectrum of disease control, use a combination product of **Carbendazim** 12% + **Mancozeb** 63% WP @ 2-3 grams per kg of seed.
        *   *Biological Option:* For organic cultivation or as an additional layer of protection, treat seeds with **Trichoderma viride** 1% WP @ 10 grams per kg of seed.

    *   **Insecticidal Treatment (If early pest pressure is anticipated or historically problematic):**
        *   Apply **Imidacloprid** 70% WS @ 5-7 grams per kg of seed.
        *   **OR** Apply **Thiamethoxam** 30% FS @ 4-5 ml per kg of seed.

    *   **Application Note:** If applying both fungicidal and insecticidal treatments, always apply the fungicide first, allow the seeds to dry thoroughly, and then apply the insecticide. Ensure uniform coating of the seeds.

### Recommended Soil Treatment Process for Coriander

Soil treatment aims to manage soil-borne diseases, nematodes, and soil insect pests that can affect coriander throughout its growth cycle.

*   **Purpose:** To manage soil-borne diseases (e.g., wilt, root rot, damping-off), nematodes, and soil insect pests (e.g., white grubs, cutworms).

*   **Recommendations:**

    *   **For Soil-borne Diseases (Wilt, Root Rot, Damping-off):**
        *   **Biological Approach (Recommended for prevention and soil health):** Incorporate **Trichoderma viride** 1% WP @ 2.5 kg per acre. Mix it thoroughly with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost, and apply uniformly to the soil 7-10 days before sowing.
        *   **Chemical Approach (For severe or recurring problems):** In problematic patches, drenching with **Carbendazim** 50% WP @ 500 grams per acre in 200-400 litres of water can be done at early stages if disease symptoms appear.

    *   **For Nematodes:**
        *   **Organic Approach:** Apply **Neem cake** @ 100-200 kg per acre and incorporate it into the soil during the final land preparation.
        *   **Biological Approach:** Incorporate **Paecilomyces lilacinus** (or *Purpureocillium lilacinum*) 1% WP @ 2.5 kg per acre, mixed with FYM, into the soil before sowing.

    *   **For Soil Insect Pests (White Grubs, Cutworms):**
        *   Apply **Fipronil** 0.3% GR @ 6-8 kg per acre. Broadcast uniformly and incorporate into the soil at the time of final land preparation before sowing.

**General Advice:**
Always follow the manufacturer's instructions for specific products and dosages. It is advisable to adopt an Integrated Pest and Disease Management (IPDM) approach, combining cultural practices, biological methods, and judicious use of chemicals. Regular monitoring of the crop and soil conditions is essential. For specific local conditions or severe outbreaks, consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts.
