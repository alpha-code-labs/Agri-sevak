As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified strategies for controlling soil pests (Termites and Nematodes/Root-knot) in Coriander in Haryana:

### I. Termite Control in Coriander

Termites (e.g., *Odontotermes obesus*, *Microtermes obesi*) can cause significant damage to coriander by feeding on roots and stems, leading to wilting, yellowing, and plant death.

**A. Cultural and Mechanical Methods:**
*   **Deep Ploughing:** Exposes termite colonies to predators and desiccation.
*   **Removal of Crop Residues:** Clear fields of stubble and other organic debris that can serve as food sources or shelter for termites.
*   **Avoidance of Fresh Organic Matter:** Do not incorporate fresh farmyard manure or undecomposed organic matter directly before sowing, as it can attract termites. Ensure well-decomposed compost is used.
*   **Proper Irrigation:** Maintain adequate soil moisture, as very dry conditions can sometimes favor termite activity.

**B. Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved):**
For severe infestations, chemical control can be effective. Apply these chemicals as a soil drench or incorporate them into the soil before sowing or at early stages of crop growth.

*   **Chlorpyriphos 20% EC:**
    *   **Application:** Mix 2.5 - 3.0 Litres of **Chlorpyriphos** 20% EC in 500-600 Litres of water and drench the soil over one acre, preferably before sowing or at the time of first irrigation.
*   **Fipronil 0.3% GR:**
    *   **Application:** Apply 6.0 - 8.0 kg of **Fipronil** 0.3% GR per acre by broadcasting and incorporating into the soil before sowing.

### II. Nematode (Root-Knot Nematode) Control in Coriander

Root-knot nematodes (*Meloidogyne* spp.) are a major threat, causing characteristic galls on roots, leading to stunted growth, yellowing, wilting, and significant yield reduction.

**A. Cultural and Mechanical Methods:**
*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate coriander with non-host crops such as cereals (wheat, barley), marigold, or mustard. Avoid continuous cultivation of susceptible crops.
*   **Solarization:** Cover moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets during hot summer months (May-June) for 4-6 weeks to raise soil temperature and kill nematodes.
*   **Incorporation of Organic Matter:** Apply well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost. Neem cake (200-400 kg/acre) can be highly effective when incorporated into the soil before sowing, as it releases compounds toxic to nematodes.
*   **Use of Healthy Seeds/Seedlings:** Ensure planting material is free from nematode infestation.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris.

**B. Biological Control:**
*   **Bio-nematicides:** Apply beneficial fungi or bacteria to the soil.
    *   **Paecilomyces lilacinus (or Purpureocillium lilacinum):** Apply 2.0 - 4.0 kg/acre of a carrier-based formulation (containing 1x10^8 CFU/g) mixed with 100 kg of FYM or compost, and broadcast evenly before sowing or at planting.
    *   **Trichoderma harzianum/viride:** While primarily a fungicide, it can also help suppress nematodes indirectly by improving plant health and competing with pathogens. Apply 2.0 - 4.0 kg/acre as above.

**C. Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved):**
Chemical nematicides should be used judiciously, especially in conjunction with cultural and biological methods.

*   **Carbofuran 3% GR:**
    *   **Application:** Apply 10.0 - 13.0 kg of **Carbofuran** 3% GR per acre by broadcasting and incorporating into the soil at the time of sowing or transplanting.
*   **Phorate 10% GR:**
    *   **Application:** Apply 4.0 kg of **Phorate** 10% GR per acre by broadcasting and incorporating into the soil at the time of sowing.
