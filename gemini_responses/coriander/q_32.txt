The symptom of "Drying up" (drying branches, leaves, fruits, and flowers) in Coriander (Dhania) is a general indication of stress, which can be caused by a variety of factors, both abiotic (environmental) and biotic (diseases or pests). A precise diagnosis is crucial for effective management.

Here's how to address this issue, considering the common causes in Haryana:

**I. Abiotic Factors (Non-Disease/Pest Related)**

These are often the primary causes of widespread drying symptoms.

1.  **Water Stress (Drought or Waterlogging):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Leaves wilt, turn yellow, and eventually dry up. In severe drought, the entire plant can shrivel. Waterlogging can also cause root damage, leading to similar wilting and drying symptoms due to impaired water uptake.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Ensure consistent and adequate irrigation. Coriander requires moist soil but is sensitive to waterlogging.
        *   Irrigate lightly and frequently, especially during critical growth stages (flowering and seed development).
        *   Improve soil drainage in areas prone to waterlogging.
        *   Apply mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves) to conserve soil moisture and regulate soil temperature.

2.  **Nutrient Deficiencies:**
    *   **Symptoms:** General poor growth, yellowing, and premature drying of leaves, often starting from older leaves. Potassium deficiency, in particular, can cause leaf margins to scorch and dry.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Conduct a soil test to determine nutrient status.
        *   Apply balanced fertilizers based on soil test recommendations.
        *   Ensure adequate supply of NPK and micronutrients. For general health, a foliar spray of a balanced NPK (e.g., 19:19:19) at 5 g/L can provide a quick boost.

3.  **Heat Stress and High Temperatures:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Scorching of leaves, wilting during the day, and eventual drying, especially during hot, dry winds.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Select appropriate sowing times to avoid extreme heat during critical growth phases.
        *   Maintain adequate soil moisture through irrigation.
        *   Consider planting heat-tolerant varieties if available.

4.  **Root Damage:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Sudden wilting and drying of the plant, even with adequate moisture. Can be caused by mechanical injury during intercultural operations or by soil-borne pests.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Exercise caution during weeding and other field operations to avoid damaging roots.
        *   Ensure good soil structure to promote healthy root development.

**II. Biotic Factors (Diseases)**

Several fungal diseases can cause wilting and drying symptoms in coriander.

1.  **Fusarium Wilt (Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. coriandri):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Yellowing and wilting of leaves, often starting from one side of the plant or one branch, progressing upwards. The plant eventually dries up and dies. A brown discoloration may be observed in the vascular tissue when the stem is cut open.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural:**
            *   Use disease-free seeds.
            *   Practice long crop rotations (3-4 years) with non-host crops.
            *   Remove and destroy infected plants immediately.
            *   Improve soil drainage.
            *   Consider soil solarization during summer months.
        *   **Biological:**
            *   Apply bio-control agents like *Trichoderma viride* or *Trichoderma harzianum* to the soil at 2.5 kg/acre mixed with 50 kg farmyard manure (FYM) before sowing or as a drench.
        *   **Chemical (Seed Treatment/Soil Drench):**
            *   For seed treatment: **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 2 g/kg seed.
            *   For soil drenching around affected plants: **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 1-2 g/L water or **Thiophanate-methyl** 70% WP at 1-1.5 g/L water.

2.  **Sclerotinia Stem Rot (Sclerotinia sclerotiorum):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Water-soaked lesions appear on stems, often near the soil line, which later turn brown. White, cottony fungal growth may be visible, and black, hard sclerotia (resting bodies) form inside or on the stem. Affected parts wilt and dry up.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural:**
            *   Crop rotation with non-host crops (e.g., cereals).
            *   Ensure good air circulation by proper plant spacing.
            *   Remove and destroy infected plant debris.
            *   Deep ploughing can bury sclerotia, reducing their viability.
        *   **Biological:**
            *   Soil application of *Trichoderma viride* or *Trichoderma harzianum* at 2.5 kg/acre mixed with 50 kg FYM.
        *   **Chemical (Foliar Spray/Drench):**
            *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 1-2 g/L water.
            *   **Thiophanate-methyl** 70% WP at 1-1.5 g/L water.
            *   **Propiconazole** 25% EC at 1 ml/L water.

3.  **Alternaria Blight (Alternaria dauci / Alternaria burnsii):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Small, dark brown to black spots with concentric rings appear on leaves, stems, and umbels. These spots enlarge, coalesce, and can lead to blighting and drying of foliage, especially under humid conditions.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural:**
            *   Use disease-free seeds.
            *   Maintain proper plant spacing for good air circulation.
            *   Remove and destroy infected plant debris.
        *   **Chemical (Foliar Spray):**
            *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP at 2-2.5 g/L water.
            *   **Chlorothalonil** 75% WP at 2 g/L water.
            *   **Propiconazole** 25% EC at 1 ml/L water.

4.  **Powdery Mildew (Erysiphe polygoni):**
    *   **Symptoms:** White, powdery patches appear on leaves, stems, and flowers. In severe cases, leaves turn yellow, curl, and dry up prematurely.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural:**
            *   Ensure good air circulation.
        *   **Chemical (Foliar Spray):**
            *   **Wettable Sulphur** 80% WP at 2-3 g/L water (avoid spraying in very hot weather).
            *   **Myclobutanil** 10% WP at 0.5 g/L water.
            *   **Hexaconazole** 5% SC at 1 ml/L water.

**III. Biotic Factors (Pests)**

While less common as a primary cause of widespread "drying up" of entire plants, severe infestations of certain pests can lead to wilting and drying of affected parts.

1.  **Sucking Pests (Aphids, Thrips, Mites):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Heavy infestations can cause leaves to curl, yellow, and eventually dry up due due to sap depletion. Mites cause bronzing and drying of leaves.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural:**
            *   Regular monitoring.
            *   Remove weeds that can host pests.
        *   **Biological:**
            *   Encourage natural enemies like ladybird beetles and lacewings.
        *   **Chemical (Foliar Spray for severe infestations):**
            *   For Aphids/Thrips: **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL at 0.5 ml/L water or **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG at 0.2 g/L water.
            *   For Mites: **Spiromesifen** 22.9% SC at 0.5 ml/L water or **Fenpyroximate** 5% SC at 1 ml/L water.

**Recommendation:**

It is essential to carefully examine the affected plants to identify the specific symptoms (e.g., spots, fungal growth, vascular discoloration, presence of pests) to determine the exact cause. If possible, bring a sample to the nearest Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or HAU extension center for accurate diagnosis.

Always follow the recommended dosages and safety precautions when using any chemical pesticides. Integrated Pest and Disease Management (IPDM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods, is the most sustainable way to manage these issues.
