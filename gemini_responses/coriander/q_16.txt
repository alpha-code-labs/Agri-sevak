As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I strongly recommend that fertilizer application for Coriander (Dhania) should always be based on a comprehensive soil test report. This ensures optimal nutrient supply, prevents wastage, and maintains soil health. The following recommendations are general guidelines for Coriander cultivation in Haryana, assuming average soil fertility.

**General Nutrient Recommendations for Coriander (without soil test):**
*   **Nitrogen (N):** 20-30 kg per acre
*   **Phosphorus (P2O5):** 15-20 kg per acre
*   **Potassium (K2O):** 10-15 kg per acre
*   **Sulphur (S):** 10-15 kg per acre

**Recommended Doses of Specific Fertilizers:**

1.  **Urea (46% Nitrogen):**
    *   **Dose:** 50-60 kg **Urea** per acre.
    *   **Timing:** Apply half of the dose (25-30 kg) as basal at the time of sowing. The remaining half (25-30 kg) should be top-dressed at 30-40 days after sowing (DAS), preferably after the first irrigation.

2.  **Nano-Urea:**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml per litre of water (typically one 500 ml bottle per acre mixed in 150-200 litres of water).
    *   **Timing:** Apply as 2-3 foliar sprays. The first spray can be given at 30-40 DAS (vegetative stage), and subsequent sprays at pre-flowering and early seed development stages, depending on crop vigour and requirement.

3.  **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP) (18% Nitrogen, 46% P2O5):**
    *   **Dose:** 35-45 kg **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** per acre.
    *   **Timing:** Apply the entire dose as basal at the time of sowing. This will provide approximately 6-8 kg N and 16-20 kg P2O5 per acre.

4.  **Nano-DAP:**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml per litre of water (typically one 500 ml bottle per acre mixed in 150-200 litres of water).
    *   **Timing:** Apply as 2 foliar sprays. The first spray at the vegetative stage (around 30-40 DAS) and the second at the pre-flowering or early seed development stage.

5.  **NPK (Compound Fertilizers):**
    *   **Dose (Granular):** If using a balanced NPK fertilizer like **NPK (12:32:16)**, apply 50-60 kg per acre as basal at the time of sowing. This will provide approximately 6-7 kg N, 16-19 kg P2O5, and 8-10 kg K2O. Adjust additional N and K based on this.
    *   **Dose (Water Soluble for Foliar):** For water-soluble NPK formulations (e.g., **19:19:19**, **0:52:34**, **13:0:45**), use 5-10 g per litre of water (500 g - 1 kg per acre in 100-200 litres of water).
    *   **Timing (Foliar):** Apply **19:19:19** during vegetative growth. Apply **0:52:34** or **13:0:45** during flowering and seed development stages to boost yield and quality.

6.  **Single Super Phosphate (SSP) (16% P2O5, 11% Sulphur):**
    *   **Dose:** 100-125 kg **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** per acre.
    *   **Timing:** Apply the entire dose as basal at the time of sowing. This will provide approximately 16-20 kg P2O5 and 11-14 kg Sulphur per acre.

7.  **Potash (Muriate of Potash - MOP, 60% K2O):**
    *   **Dose:** 15-25 kg **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** per acre.
    *   **Timing:** Apply the entire dose as basal at the time of sowing.

8.  **Sulphur:**
    *   If **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** is used, additional Sulphur may not be required as SSP provides sufficient Sulphur.
    *   If **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** is used, additional Sulphur is recommended.
    *   **Dose:** 10-15 kg **Elemental Sulphur (90% WDG)** per acre.
    *   **Timing:** Apply as basal at the time of sowing.
    *   Alternatively, 75-100 kg **Gypsum** per acre can be applied as basal to provide Sulphur and Calcium.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Soil Testing:** Always prioritize soil testing to get precise recommendations tailored to your field's specific nutrient status.
*   **Organic Manures:** Incorporating 5-10 tonnes of well-decomposed Farmyard Manure (FYM) or compost per acre can significantly improve soil health and nutrient availability, potentially reducing the need for chemical fertilizers.
*   **Micronutrients:** In some soils, deficiencies of micronutrients like Zinc (Zn) and Boron (B) can occur. If a soil test indicates deficiency, apply **Zinc Sulphate (21% Zn)** at 10 kg/acre as basal or foliar spray of **Zinc Sulphate (33% Zn)** at 0.5% solution, and **Borax (10.5% B)** at 5 kg/acre as basal or foliar spray of **Boron (20% B)** at 0.1% solution.
