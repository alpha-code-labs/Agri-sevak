Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the challenges posed by weeds in Coriander (Dhaniya) cultivation. Effective weed management is crucial for maximizing yield and quality. Here's a scientifically verified approach to control the weeds you've mentioned:

Coriander is a sensitive crop, and integrated weed management (IWM) combining cultural practices with judicious use of herbicides is recommended.

### I. Cultural Control Measures

1.  **Clean Seed:** Always use certified, weed-free coriander seeds to prevent the introduction of weed seeds, especially parasitic ones like Amarbail.
2.  **Timely Sowing:** Sowing at the optimal time helps the crop establish quickly and compete better with weeds.
3.  **Seedbed Preparation:** Thorough land preparation helps in reducing the initial weed flush.
4.  **Manual Weeding/Hoeing:** This is highly effective and recommended, especially in the early stages of crop growth. Perform 1-2 manual weedings at 20-30 and 40-50 days after sowing (DAS) to remove broadleaf and narrowleaf weeds.
5.  **Crop Rotation:** Rotate coriander with non-host crops to break the life cycle of specific problematic weeds.

### II. Chemical Control Measures

**A. Pre-emergence Herbicides (for Broadleaf, Narrowleaf, Bathu, Congress grass, and some suppression of Amarbail)**

Apply these herbicides within 0-3 days after sowing (DAS) to a moist soil surface. Ensure uniform spray coverage.

*   For general broadleaf and narrowleaf weed control, including Bathu and Congress grass:
    *   **Pendimethalin** 30% EC at 3.3 Litres per acre, mixed in 200-250 Litres of water.
    *   OR
    *   **Pendimethalin** 38.7% CS at 2.6 Litres per acre, mixed in 200-250 Litres of water.

**B. Post-emergence Herbicides (for Narrowleaf weeds like Phalaris minor)**

If narrowleaf weeds are a significant problem after crop emergence (typically when weeds are at 2-4 leaf stage, around 20-30 DAS), grass-specific herbicides can be used. Ensure the crop is healthy and there is adequate soil moisture.

*   For control of Phalaris minor and other narrowleaf weeds:
    *   **Quizalofop-ethyl** 5% EC at 400-500 ml per acre, mixed in 200-250 Litres of water.
    *   OR
    *   **Fenoxaprop-p-ethyl** 9% EC at 250-300 ml per acre, mixed in 200-250 Litres of water.
    *   OR
    *   **Fluazifop-p-butyl** 13.4% EC at 300-400 ml per acre, mixed in 200-250 Litres of water.

**Important Considerations for Herbicide Application:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the herbicide label carefully.
*   Use the recommended spray volume (200-250 Litres of water per acre) for effective coverage.
*   Use a flat fan nozzle for uniform spray application.
*   Avoid spraying on windy days to prevent drift.

### III. Specific Weed Control Notes

1.  **Amarbail (Cuscuta spp.):**
    *   Prevention is the most effective strategy. Use only certified, *Cuscuta*-free seeds.
    *   If *Cuscuta* patches appear, immediate manual removal and destruction of the infested coriander plants (before *Cuscuta* sets seed) is crucial to prevent its spread.
    *   Pre-emergence application of **Pendimethalin** can offer some suppression of *Cuscuta* germination. Post-emergence chemical control of *Cuscuta* in coriander without harming the crop is very challenging and generally not recommended for broadcast application.

2.  **Orobanche (Broomrape):**
    *   This is not known to affect Coriander. *Orobanche* primarily parasitizes crops like mustard, tobacco, tomato, and brinjal.

By adopting these integrated weed management strategies, you can effectively control weeds in your coriander crop and ensure a healthy and productive harvest. For any further specific queries, please consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts.
