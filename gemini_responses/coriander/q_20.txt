Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU), Hisar, I understand the critical role of micronutrients in ensuring healthy growth and optimal yield of Coriander (Dhaniya). Deficiencies in these essential elements can significantly impact plant vigor and productivity.

Before any application, it is **highly recommended to conduct a soil test** to accurately diagnose the specific deficiency and its severity. This ensures targeted and efficient nutrient management, preventing unnecessary applications and potential toxicities.

Here's how to address common micronutrient deficiencies in Coriander:

**General Guidelines for Micronutrient Application:**

*   **Foliar Application:** Often preferred for quick correction of visible deficiency symptoms, especially for mobile nutrients or when soil conditions limit uptake. Apply during cooler parts of the day (morning or late afternoon) to avoid scorching and improve absorption.
*   **Soil Application:** Suitable for long-term correction and preventive measures, especially for immobile nutrients or when soil tests indicate widespread deficiency. Incorporate into the soil before sowing or as a side-dressing.
*   **Water Quality:** Use clean water for foliar sprays.
*   **Compatibility:** Always check the compatibility of different chemicals before mixing them for foliar application.

### Addressing Specific Micronutrient Deficiencies in Coriander:

#### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, small and narrow leaves (little leaf), interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, sometimes bronzing.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application (Preventive/Corrective):**
        *   Apply **Zinc Sulphate heptahydrate** (21% Zn) at 10-25 kg/acre, broadcast and incorporated into the soil before sowing or as a basal dose.
    *   **Foliar Spray (Quick Correction):**
        *   Spray 0.5% solution of **Zinc Sulphate heptahydrate** (5 g/L of water).
        *   Alternatively, use **Chelated Zinc (Zn-EDTA)** at 0.1% solution (1 g/L of water).
        *   Repeat spray after 10-15 days if symptoms persist.

#### 2. Iron (Fe) / Ferrous Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Pronounced interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, turning them pale yellow or almost white while veins remain green. Severe cases can lead to necrosis.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application (Less common due to rapid fixation):**
        *   Apply **Ferrous Sulphate** (19% Fe) at 10-20 kg/acre in severe cases, but foliar application is generally more effective.
    *   **Foliar Spray (Most effective):**
        *   Spray 0.5-1.0% solution of **Ferrous Sulphate** (5-10 g/L of water).
        *   Alternatively, use **Chelated Iron (Fe-EDTA or Fe-DTPA)** at 0.1% solution (1 g/L of water).
        *   Repeat spray after 7-10 days if symptoms persist.

#### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, thickening and brittleness of leaves, malformation or death of growing points, poor flowering and seed set, sometimes hollow stems.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application (Preventive/Corrective):**
        *   Apply **Borax (Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate)** (10.5% B) at 2-4 kg/acre, broadcast and incorporated into the soil.
        *   Alternatively, **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (20% B) at 1-2 kg/acre.
    *   **Foliar Spray (Quick Correction):**
        *   Spray 0.1-0.2% solution of **Borax** (1-2 g/L of water).
        *   Alternatively, use **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** at 0.05-0.1% solution (0.5-1 g/L of water).
        *   Apply at pre-flowering stage for better seed set.

#### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Necrosis (death) of young leaves and growing points, stunted root growth, distorted new growth, sometimes marginal leaf burn on young leaves.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application (Preventive/Corrective):**
        *   Apply **Gypsum (Calcium Sulphate Dihydrate)** at 200-500 kg/acre, especially in sodic soils, to improve soil structure and provide calcium.
        *   For direct Ca supply, **Calcium Nitrate** at 10-20 kg/acre can be applied.
    *   **Foliar Spray (Quick Correction):**
        *   Spray 0.5-1.0% solution of **Calcium Nitrate** (5-10 g/L of water).
        *   Repeat sprays may be needed as calcium is immobile in the phloem.

#### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, with veins remaining green, giving a "tiger-stripe" or "herringbone" pattern. In severe cases, leaves may turn purplish or reddish.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application (Preventive/Corrective):**
        *   Apply **Magnesium Sulphate heptahydrate** (Epsom salt, 9.6% Mg) at 10-20 kg/acre, broadcast and incorporated.
    *   **Foliar Spray (Quick Correction):**
        *   Spray 0.5-1.0% solution of **Magnesium Sulphate heptahydrate** (5-10 g/L of water).
        *   Repeat spray after 10-15 days if symptoms persist.

#### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, often appearing as a fine "netting" pattern, sometimes with small brown necrotic spots. Growth may be stunted.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application (Preventive/Corrective):**
        *   Apply **Manganese Sulphate monohydrate** (27.5% Mn) at 5-10 kg/acre, broadcast and incorporated.
    *   **Foliar Spray (Quick Correction):**
        *   Spray 0.5% solution of **Manganese Sulphate monohydrate** (5 g/L of water).
        *   Alternatively, use **Chelated Manganese (Mn-EDTA)** at 0.1% solution (1 g/L of water).
        *   Repeat spray after 10-15 days if symptoms persist.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Soil pH:** Micronutrient availability is highly influenced by soil pH. For instance, Iron and Manganese become less available in alkaline soils, while Boron can become toxic in highly alkaline conditions.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management:** Always integrate micronutrient applications with balanced NPK fertilization for overall plant health.
*   **Preventive Approach:** Regular soil testing and timely application of deficient micronutrients are more effective than curative measures.
