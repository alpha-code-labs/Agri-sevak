As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following cultivation practices for Coriander in Haryana:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   **Line Sowing:** This is highly recommended over broadcasting. Line sowing facilitates better intercultural operations such as weeding, thinning, and pest/disease management, leading to a more uniform crop stand and higher yields.
    *   **Seed Preparation:** Coriander seeds are actually fruits (schizocarps) that contain two single-seeded mericarps. For better and quicker germination, it is advisable to gently rub the seeds to split them into two halves before sowing. This can be done by rubbing them between palms or using a light roller.
*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   Sow the seeds at a depth of **2-3 cm**. Deeper sowing can delay emergence and reduce the germination percentage.
*   **Spacing:**
    *   **Row-to-Row Spacing:** Maintain a distance of **20-30 cm** between rows. A spacing of 30 cm is often preferred for ease of operations.
    *   **Plant-to-Plant Spacing:** After emergence, thin the seedlings to maintain a plant-to-plant distance of **10-15 cm** within the rows. This ensures adequate space for individual plant development.
*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   For optimal plant stand and yield, a seed dose of **15-20 kg/acre** is recommended when using line sowing. If broadcasting, the seed rate might be slightly higher.
