As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice on irrigation management for Coriander in Haryana:

Coriander is a shallow-rooted crop and is sensitive to both water stress and waterlogging. Proper irrigation management is crucial for good germination, vegetative growth, flowering, and seed development. The total water requirement for coriander typically ranges from 250-400 mm, depending on soil type, climate, and crop duration.

### Irrigation Management in Coriander

**1. First Irrigation:**
The timing of the first irrigation is critical for uniform germination and stand establishment.

*   **Pre-sowing Irrigation (Palewa):** If the soil moisture is insufficient at the time of sowing, a light pre-sowing irrigation (palewa) is recommended to ensure adequate moisture for germination. Sowing should be done when the soil reaches optimal moisture content.
*   **Post-sowing Irrigation:**
    *   **Immediately after sowing:** For broadcast or flatbed sowing, a very light irrigation should be given immediately after sowing to ensure proper seed-soil contact and facilitate germination. Care must be taken to avoid crust formation, which can hinder seedling emergence.
    *   **Within 2-3 days after sowing:** If sowing is done on ridges and furrows, a light irrigation in the furrows is generally given within 2-3 days after sowing, allowing water to seep up to the seed zone.
*   **Key consideration:** The aim is to provide just enough moisture for germination without causing waterlogging or soil crusting.

**2. Second Irrigation:**
The second irrigation is typically given during the early vegetative growth phase.

*   **Timing:** This usually falls around 20-30 days after sowing, depending on the soil type and prevailing weather conditions.
*   **Crop Stage:** This stage corresponds to active vegetative growth and branching, which is crucial for developing a robust plant structure.
*   **Observation:** Observe the crop for signs of wilting or stress before applying the second irrigation. Check soil moisture at root depth.
*   **Quantity:** A moderate irrigation is generally sufficient.

**3. Subsequent Irrigations and Critical Stages:**
Coriander requires consistent moisture, especially during its critical growth stages.

*   **Critical Stages:**
    *   **Branching (30-45 DAS):** Essential for developing a good canopy.
    *   **Flowering (50-70 DAS):** Water stress during flowering can lead to flower drop and poor seed set.
    *   **Grain Filling/Seed Development (70-90 DAS):** Adequate moisture is vital for proper seed development and yield.
*   **Frequency:** Subsequent irrigations should be applied based on soil type, weather conditions, and crop demand. Generally, 3-5 irrigations are sufficient for the entire crop cycle in Haryana.
*   **Avoid Waterlogging:** Coriander is highly susceptible to root rot under waterlogged conditions. Ensure proper drainage and avoid excessive irrigation.
*   **Light Irrigations:** It is better to give frequent light irrigations rather than heavy, infrequent ones, especially on lighter soils.

**4. Sprinkler Use:**
Sprinkler irrigation is an excellent method for coriander cultivation, offering several advantages:

*   **Water Saving:** Sprinklers can save 25-40% water compared to traditional flood irrigation, making them highly efficient, especially in water-scarce regions of Haryana.
*   **Uniform Application:** Provides uniform distribution of water, ensuring all plants receive adequate moisture.
*   **Reduced Crusting:** Ideal for the first irrigation as it minimizes soil crust formation, which is beneficial for delicate coriander seedlings.
*   **Suitable for Light Soils:** Particularly effective on sandy or light-textured soils where water percolation is high.
*   **Fertigation:** Sprinklers can be used for fertigation (application of fertilizers through irrigation water), improving nutrient use efficiency.
*   **Timing:** Can be used for all irrigations, but particularly beneficial during germination and early vegetative stages. Avoid overhead irrigation during peak flowering if there is a risk of washing off pollen or promoting fungal diseases in humid conditions.
*   **Considerations:** Wind can affect the uniformity of water distribution. Irrigation should ideally be done during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize evaporative losses.

By following these guidelines, farmers can optimize water use, ensure healthy crop growth, and achieve good yields of coriander in Haryana.
