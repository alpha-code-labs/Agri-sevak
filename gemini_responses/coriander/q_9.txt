Mites, including Red spider mite (Tetranychus urticae) and Rust mite (Aceria spp.), are significant pests of Coriander, especially during dry and warm weather conditions in Haryana. They can cause considerable damage by sucking sap, leading to yellowing, bronzing, leaf distortion, and reduced yield and quality.

Here's a comprehensive approach to control mites in Coriander:

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies:**

1.  **Regular Monitoring:** Inspect coriander fields regularly, especially the undersides of leaves, for the presence of mites, their eggs, and webbing (for red spider mites). Early detection is crucial for effective control.
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy crop residues and weeds, which can act as alternate hosts for mites.
    *   **Proper Irrigation:** Maintain adequate soil moisture. Water stress can exacerbate mite infestations. Overhead irrigation can sometimes help dislodge mites, but avoid excessive moisture that can lead to fungal diseases.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can promote lush growth that is more attractive to mites.
3.  **Biological Control:** Encourage natural enemies like predatory mites (e.g., Amblyseius spp.), ladybird beetles, and lacewings. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.
4.  **Physical Removal:** For small infestations, a strong jet of water can dislodge mites from the plants.

**Chemical Control (Acaricides):**

When mite populations reach damaging levels, chemical control may be necessary. Always rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where mites reside.

**Important Note:** Coriander is a leafy vegetable/herb with a short growth cycle and frequent harvesting. Always observe the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) mentioned on the product label to ensure the produce is safe for consumption.

Here are some CIBRC-approved acaricides commonly used for mite control in various crops, which can be considered for coriander under expert guidance, strictly adhering to label instructions and PHI:

*   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP:**
    *   Dosage: 2.0 - 3.0 g/L of water.
    *   Effective against both red spider mites and rust mites, and also helps in controlling powdery mildew. It's a good option for early infestations or as a preventive.
*   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:**
    *   Dosage: 0.5 - 0.75 ml/L of water.
    *   Effective against all life stages of mites (eggs, nymphs, and adults) and has translaminar action.
*   **Fenpyroximate 5% SC:**
    *   Dosage: 1.0 - 1.5 ml/L of water.
    *   A contact and stomach action acaricide effective against various mite species.
*   **Propargite 57% EC:**
    *   Dosage: 1.5 - 2.0 ml/L of water.
    *   A broad-spectrum acaricide with contact action, effective against a wide range of mites.
*   **Abamectin 1.9% EC:**
    *   Dosage: 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   Has translaminar activity, providing good control of mites feeding on the undersides of leaves.

**Recommendations for Application:**

*   Apply acaricides preferably in the morning or evening to avoid high temperatures, which can reduce efficacy and increase phytotoxicity.
*   Ensure complete coverage of the plant, especially the undersides of leaves.
*   Repeat application after 7-10 days if the infestation persists, using a different group of acaricide to prevent resistance.
*   Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and application.
