Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm that Wilt (caused primarily by *Fusarium oxysporum* f. sp. *coriandri*) and Parawilt are significant concerns for coriander cultivation in Haryana. Parawilt is often a complex condition, frequently associated with *Fusarium* species but also exacerbated by environmental stresses like high temperatures and fluctuating soil moisture.

Effective management requires an integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods.

Here's how to control Wilt and Parawilt in Coriander:

**I. Cultural Practices (Prevention and Management):**

*   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid continuous cultivation of coriander or other susceptible crops in the same field. Rotate with non-host crops like cereals (wheat, barley) for at least 2-3 years.
*   **Soil Solarization:** During the hot summer months (May-June), cover the prepared field with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks. This raises soil temperature, effectively reducing the inoculum of soil-borne pathogens like *Fusarium*.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** Expose the soil to direct sunlight during summer to reduce pathogen survival.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure balanced fertilization. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can make plants more succulent and susceptible. Adequate potassium can improve plant resistance.
*   **Optimized Sowing Time:** Adjust sowing time to avoid periods of extreme high temperatures, especially during germination and early growth stages, as heat stress can predispose plants to parawilt.
*   **Water Management:**
    *   Ensure proper field drainage to prevent waterlogging, which stresses plants and favors wilt development.
    *   Provide adequate and timely irrigation, especially during critical growth stages, but avoid over-irrigation. Maintain consistent soil moisture without saturation.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Promptly remove and destroy infected plant debris and uprooted wilted plants to reduce the pathogen inoculum in the soil.
*   **Use Healthy Seeds:** Always use certified, healthy, and disease-free seeds from reputable sources.

**II. Biological Control:**

*   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds with bio-control agents before sowing.
    *   **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum**: Apply at 4-5 g/kg seed. These fungi colonize the root zone and suppress the growth of pathogenic *Fusarium*.
*   **Soil Application:**
    *   **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum**: Mix 2.5 kg of the formulation with 50-100 kg of farmyard manure (FYM) or compost, keep it moist for a week, and then broadcast it uniformly in one acre field before sowing or transplanting.

**III. Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved):**

*   **Seed Treatment (Most Critical for Wilt Management):**
    *   **Carbendazim 50% WP**: Treat seeds at 2 g/kg of seed.
    *   **Thiram 75% WS**: Treat seeds at 2.5-3 g/kg of seed.
    *   **Carbendazim 12% + Mancozeb 63% WP**: Treat seeds at 2.5 g/kg of seed.
    *   *Note: Seed treatment provides initial protection against soil-borne pathogens.*

*   **Soil Drenching (for standing crop, if disease incidence is observed):**
    *   **Carbendazim 50% WP**: Drench the soil around the base of the affected plants with a solution of 0.5-1 g/L of water. This can help in managing the spread of the disease.

**IV. Resistant Varieties:**

*   Where available and suitable for Haryana conditions, consider using coriander varieties known to possess resistance or tolerance to wilt. Consult with HAU experts or local KVKs for recommendations on specific varieties.

An integrated approach combining these strategies will provide the most effective and sustainable control of Wilt and Parawilt in your coriander crop. Always follow label instructions for chemical applications.
