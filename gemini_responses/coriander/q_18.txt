As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the use of growth regulators and Boron in Coriander for Haryana:

It is important to note that the use of growth regulators must be precise and based on specific crop needs and local recommendations.

*   **Ethrel (Ethephon)**
    *   **Chemical Name:** **Ethephon**
    *   **Recommendation:** While **Ethephon** is a plant growth regulator known to influence flowering and maturity in various crops, it is **not a standard recommended growth regulator for Coriander** in Haryana for general cultivation, especially not for leaf production. Research may explore its use for specific purposes like enhancing seed yield or synchronizing maturity, but it is not part of the routine advisory for farmers from HAU.

*   **2,4-D (2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid)**
    *   **Chemical Name:** **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid**
    *   **Recommendation:** **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid** is primarily a selective herbicide used for broadleaf weed control. At extremely low concentrations, it can exhibit auxin-like growth regulating properties. However, due to its potent herbicidal action and a very narrow margin of safety between growth regulation and phytotoxicity in broadleaf crops like Coriander, it is **not recommended as a growth regulator for Coriander**. Its application for this purpose carries a high risk of crop damage.

*   **Boron**
    *   **Recommendation:** Boron is an essential micronutrient crucial for pollen viability, flower formation, fruit set, and seed development, rather than a hormone or growth regulator in the same category as Ethrel or 2,4-D. Deficiency can significantly impact seed yield in Coriander.
    *   **For Foliar Application (to correct deficiency):**
        *   **Chemical Name:** **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (e.g., Solubor) or **Sodium tetraborate decahydrate** (e.g., Borax).
        *   **Dose:**
            *   For **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate**: 1 g/L of water (0.1% solution).
            *   For **Sodium tetraborate decahydrate**: 2 g/L of water (0.2% solution).
        *   **Timing:** Apply one to two foliar sprays at the pre-flowering or early flowering stage, especially if deficiency symptoms (e.g., poor flowering, reduced seed set) are observed or if soil tests indicate low Boron levels.
        *   **Method:** Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.
