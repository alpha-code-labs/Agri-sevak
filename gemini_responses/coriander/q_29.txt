"Dropping" in the context of flower and immature seed abortion can occur in Coriander (Coriandrum sativum) due to various physiological and environmental stresses. However, "Fruit drop" (typically referring to fleshy fruits) and "Tinda/Boll dropping" are not terms or conditions associated with Coriander. Coriander produces schizocarps (often referred to as seeds), not fleshy fruits, bolls, or tinda.

The primary causes for flower and immature seed drop in Coriander are generally physiological:

*   **Environmental Stress:**
    *   **High Temperatures:** Temperatures exceeding 30°C during flowering can lead to pollen sterility and flower abortion.
    *   **Water Stress:** Both drought conditions and waterlogging can induce stress, causing flowers and immature seeds to drop.
    *   **Sudden Weather Changes:** Abrupt shifts in temperature, humidity, or strong winds can also contribute.
*   **Nutritional Deficiencies/Imbalances:**
    *   Deficiencies of micronutrients like Boron and Calcium are critical for flower and seed development.
    *   General nutrient imbalance or excessive nitrogen application (promoting vegetative growth over reproductive) can also play a role.
*   **Poor Pollination:**
    *   Lack of adequate pollinators (e.g., bees) or adverse weather conditions during the flowering period can result in unfertilized flowers dropping.
*   **Pest and Disease Pressure:**
    *   Severe infestations of sucking pests (like aphids or thrips) or certain diseases can weaken the plant, indirectly leading to flower/seed abortion, though this is usually a secondary effect.

**Control Measures for Flower and Immature Seed Drop in Coriander:**

Focus on optimizing growing conditions and nutrient management:

1.  **Agronomic Practices:**
    *   **Optimal Sowing Time:** Sow coriander at the recommended time for your region in Haryana to ensure the flowering and seed development stages occur under favorable temperature conditions, avoiding extreme heat or cold.
    *   **Irrigation Management:** Maintain consistent and adequate soil moisture, especially from flowering to seed development. Avoid both water scarcity (drought stress) and waterlogging, which can severely stress the plants.
    *   **Weed Control:** Keep the field free of weeds to minimize competition for water, nutrients, and light.

2.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Balanced Fertilization:** Apply recommended doses of macro-nutrients (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium) based on soil test reports. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can promote vegetative growth at the expense of reproductive development.
    *   **Micronutrient Application:** Address potential deficiencies of critical micronutrients:
        *   **Boron:** For Boron deficiency, apply a foliar spray of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** at a concentration of 0.1-0.2% (1-2 g per liter of water) at the pre-flowering stage.
        *   **Calcium:** For Calcium deficiency, apply a foliar spray of **Calcium nitrate** at a concentration of 0.5% (5 g per liter of water) during the flowering stage.

3.  **Pollination Enhancement:**
    *   Encourage natural pollinators like bees by avoiding the use of broad-spectrum insecticides during the flowering period. If necessary, apply insecticides in the late evening or early morning when pollinators are less active.

4.  **Pest and Disease Management:**
    *   Regularly monitor for pests and diseases. If severe infestations or infections are observed, manage them promptly using CIBRC-approved pesticides/fungicides as per HAU recommendations to reduce overall plant stress.
