As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding rust diseases in Coriander for Haryana.

First, let's address the specific rust types you mentioned:

*   **Black Rust (Stem Rust):** This is not known to affect Coriander. It primarily affects cereal crops like wheat.
*   **Brown Rust (Leaf Rust):** This is not known to affect Coriander. It primarily affects cereal crops like wheat and barley.
*   **Yellow Rust (Stripe Rust):** This is not known to affect Coriander. It primarily affects cereal crops like wheat.
*   **White Rust:** This is not known to affect Coriander. It primarily affects cruciferous crops (e.g., mustard, radish) and some other plant families, but not typically Coriander.
*   **Red Rust:** This is not known to affect Coriander as a distinct rust disease. The term "Red Rust" is sometimes used colloquially or for algal diseases on other crops.

The most common and significant rust disease affecting Coriander (*Coriandrum sativum*) is caused by the fungus *Puccinia coriandri*, commonly known as **Coriander Rust**. This disease can cause significant yield losses, especially if conditions are favorable for its development (moderate temperatures and high humidity).

Here's how to control Coriander Rust (*Puccinia coriandri*):

**I. Cultural Control Measures:**

1.  **Resistant Varieties:** Where available and suitable for your region, choose rust-resistant or tolerant Coriander varieties. Consult with HAU or local agricultural extension for recommended varieties.
2.  **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting Coriander in the same field year after year. Rotate with non-host crops for at least 2-3 years to break the disease cycle.
3.  **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest. This reduces the inoculum for the next season.
4.  **Timely Sowing:** Sow Coriander at the recommended time for your region. Early or late sowing can sometimes expose the crop to more favorable conditions for rust development.
5.  **Proper Spacing:** Maintain adequate plant spacing to ensure good air circulation within the canopy. This helps reduce humidity and prevents prolonged leaf wetness, which are conducive to rust development.
6.  **Balanced Fertilization:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush, succulent growth that is more susceptible to rust. Use balanced NPK fertilizers based on soil test recommendations.

**II. Chemical Control Measures (CIBRC Approved for Rust in similar crops like Cumin, which is also Apiaceae, and generally effective for Coriander Rust):**

Fungicides should be applied preventively or at the very first appearance of symptoms. Repeat applications may be necessary based on disease severity and weather conditions. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions.

*   **Propiconazole 25% EC:**
    *   **Dosage:** 1.0 - 1.25 ml per litre of water, or 250 - 500 ml per acre.
    *   **Application:** Apply as a foliar spray at the appearance of rust symptoms. Repeat after 10-15 days if necessary.

*   **Difenoconazole 25% EC:**
    *   **Dosage:** 0.5 - 1.0 ml per litre of water, or 200 - 300 ml per acre.
    *   **Application:** Apply as a foliar spray at the appearance of rust symptoms. Repeat after 10-15 days if necessary.

*   **Tebuconazole 25.9% EC:**
    *   **Dosage:** 0.75 - 1.0 ml per litre of water, or 250 - 300 ml per acre.
    *   **Application:** Apply as a foliar spray at the appearance of rust symptoms. Repeat after 10-15 days if necessary.

*   **Mancozeb 75% WP:**
    *   **Dosage:** 2.5 - 3.0 g per litre of water, or 500 - 750 g per acre.
    *   **Application:** This is a protectant fungicide. Apply preventively or at the very early stages of the disease. Repeat at 7-10 day intervals, especially during periods favorable for disease development.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always ensure thorough coverage of the plant foliage during spraying.
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of fungicide resistance.
*   Observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) for any chemical applied to ensure the safety of the produce.
