As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling these conditions in Coriander in Haryana:

**1. Dieback and Twig Blight in Coriander:**
Dieback and Twig Blight are not specific disease names for Coriander but rather symptoms that can be observed due to severe infections of certain fungal diseases, most commonly **Alternaria Blight** (caused by *Alternaria coriandri* or *Alternaria dauci*). This disease can cause blighting of leaves, stems, and umbels, leading to necrosis and dieback of shoots and twigs.

**Control Measures for Alternaria Blight:**

**A. Cultural Practices:**
*   Use disease-free seeds. Seed treatment is highly recommended.
*   Practice crop rotation with non-umbelliferous crops.
*   Maintain proper plant spacing to ensure good air circulation and reduce humidity.
*   Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest to reduce inoculum.
*   Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day, to minimize leaf wetness.

**B. Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
Apply fungicides preventively or at the first appearance of symptoms. Repeat applications at 10-15 day intervals, depending on disease severity and weather conditions.

*   **Mancozeb** (75% WP): Apply at 2.0-2.5 kg per acre (or 2.0-2.5 g per liter of water).
*   **Propiconazole** (25% EC): Apply at 200 ml per acre (or 1.0 ml per liter of water).
*   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC): Apply at 200 ml per acre (or 1.0 ml per liter of water).
*   **Tebuconazole** (250 EC): Apply at 200 ml per acre (or 1.0 ml per liter of water).
*   **Carbendazim 12% + Mancozeb 63% WP** (Combination product): Apply at 400-500 g per acre (or 2.0-2.5 g per liter of water).

**Seed Treatment:**
*   Treat seeds with **Carbendazim** (50% WP) at 2 g per kg of seed, or **Thiram** (75% WS) at 2.5 g per kg of seed, or a combination product like **Carbendazim 12% + Mancozeb 63% WP** at 2-3 g per kg of seed.

**2. Tikka Disease in Coriander:**
This is not known to affect Coriander. Tikka disease is primarily a disease of groundnut (peanut).
