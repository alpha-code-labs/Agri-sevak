As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend the following doses of organic manures and biostimulants for Coriander cultivation in Haryana, based on scientific principles and local agricultural practices. Organic manures are crucial for improving soil health, structure, water retention, and nutrient availability, which are vital for healthy coriander growth.

Here are the recommended doses:

*   **Farmyard Manure (FYM):**
    *   **Dose:** 10-15 tonnes per acre.
    *   **Application:** Apply well-decomposed FYM at least 2-3 weeks before sowing, incorporating it thoroughly into the soil during field preparation. This allows for proper decomposition and nutrient release.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 tonnes per acre.
    *   **Application:** Similar to FYM, apply vermicompost during the final stages of field preparation, 1-2 weeks before sowing, and mix it well with the soil. Vermicompost is richer in nutrients than FYM, so a lower dose is effective.

*   **Sagarika (IFFCO's Seaweed Extract-based Biostimulant):**
    *   **Dose:**
        *   **Foliar Spray:** 250-500 ml per acre, mixed with 150-200 litres of water.
        *   **Soil Drench/Drip Irrigation:** 1-2 litres per acre.
    *   **Application:**
        *   **First Spray:** 15-20 days after sowing (at the vegetative growth stage).
        *   **Second Spray:** 30-35 days after sowing (at the flowering/early seed formation stage).
        *   Sagarika acts as a biostimulant, enhancing nutrient uptake, root development, and overall plant vigour, leading to better yield and quality.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Soil Testing:** For precise recommendations, it is always advisable to conduct a soil test. This will help determine the existing nutrient status of your soil and allow for tailored manure and fertilizer applications.
*   **Quality of Manure:** Ensure that FYM and vermicompost are well-decomposed and free from weed seeds and pathogens to avoid introducing problems into your field.
