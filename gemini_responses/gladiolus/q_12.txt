Scale insects and Mealybugs are significant sucking pests that can affect Gladiolus, causing stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, and reduced flower production. Effective management requires an integrated approach.

Here's how to control them:

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   **Regular Inspection:** Frequently inspect your Gladiolus plants, especially the undersides of leaves, leaf axils, and flower spikes, for early detection.
*   **Manual Removal:** For small infestations, scale insects and mealybugs can be physically removed using a soft brush, a strong jet of water, or by hand-picking. A cotton swab dipped in rubbing alcohol can also be used to dab individual pests.
*   **Pruning:** Heavily infested leaves, stems, or flower spikes should be pruned and destroyed (e.g., by burning or deep burying) to prevent further spread.
*   **Sanitation:** Remove plant debris and weeds from around the Gladiolus beds, as these can harbor pests.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate spacing between plants to improve air circulation, which can reduce pest incidence.

**2. Biological Control:**
*   Natural enemies like ladybird beetles (e.g., *Cryptolaemus montrouzieri* for mealybugs) and parasitic wasps can help keep populations in check. Encourage their presence by avoiding broad-spectrum insecticides.

**3. Chemical Control:**
When infestations are severe and cultural methods are insufficient, chemical control may be necessary. Always ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and in leaf axils where these pests tend to hide. Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

*   **For Scale Insects and Mealybugs:**
    *   **Horticultural Mineral Oil (e.g., 80% EC formulation):** Apply at a concentration of **10-20 ml/L** of water. Horticultural oils work by suffocating the pests. Ensure complete coverage. Avoid spraying during very hot conditions (above 30°C) or when plants are under moisture stress.
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at a concentration of **1.25-1.5 ml/L** of water. This is an insect growth regulator that primarily affects the nymphal stages, preventing them from molting. It is particularly effective against mealybugs and scale crawlers.
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at a concentration of **0.5-1 ml/L** of water. This is a systemic insecticide that is absorbed by the plant and ingested by the sucking pests.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at a concentration of **0.2-0.4 g/L** of water. This is another systemic insecticide effective against a wide range of sucking pests.
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply at a concentration of **0.2-0.4 g/L** of water. This is a systemic insecticide with translaminar action, providing good control of sucking pests.
    *   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:** Apply at a concentration of **0.75-1 ml/L** of water. This is a novel systemic insecticide with two-way systemic movement (xylem and phloem), providing excellent control of scales and mealybugs, including those hidden in plant tissues.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label carefully, including dosage, application timing, and safety precautions.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and application.
*   Apply insecticides preferably in the early morning or late evening to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   Repeat applications may be necessary, following the intervals specified on the product label, especially for persistent infestations.
