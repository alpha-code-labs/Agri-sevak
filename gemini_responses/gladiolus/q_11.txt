Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies in Gladiolus cultivation in Haryana. These pests are known to affect Gladiolus and can cause significant damage if not managed properly.

An Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, mechanical, and judicious chemical methods, is highly recommended for sustainable control.

### General Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Principles for Gladiolus:
*   **Regular Scouting:** Frequently inspect your Gladiolus plants for signs of pest activity, especially on the underside of leaves, stems, and around the corms.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Keep the field free of weeds, plant debris, and volunteer plants that can harbor pests.
*   **Healthy Planting Material:** Use only healthy, disease-free corms from reputable sources. Inspect corms thoroughly before planting.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate Gladiolus with non-host crops to break pest life cycles.
*   **Encourage Natural Enemies:** Avoid broad-spectrum pesticides unnecessarily, as they can harm beneficial insects that naturally control pests.

### Specific Control Measures:

#### 1. Beetles (e.g., Flea Beetles, Blister Beetles, Cucumber Beetles, Scarab Beetles)
**Damage:** Adult beetles feed on leaves, flowers, and stems, causing holes, defoliation, or damage to blooms. Larvae (grubs) of some beetles (e.g., scarab beetles) can feed on corms and roots in the soil.

**Cultural Control:**
*   Hand-picking of larger beetles can be effective in small infestations.
*   Maintain good field sanitation to reduce breeding sites.
*   Inspect corms before planting to avoid introducing soil-dwelling grubs.

**Chemical Control (Apply when pest incidence is high and causing economic damage):**
*   For foliar feeding adults:
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Cypermethrin** 25% EC at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Malathion** 50% EC at 2 ml/L of water.
*   For soil-dwelling grubs (if identified as a significant problem, apply as a soil drench):
    *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 2.5 ml/L of water (apply around the base of plants).

#### 2. Weevils (e.g., Bulb Weevils, Root Weevils)
**Damage:** Larvae feed on roots and corms, leading to stunted growth, yellowing, and plant death. Adults may feed on foliage and stems, causing notches or holes.

**Cultural Control:**
*   Thoroughly inspect corms before planting; discard or treat any infested corms.
*   Remove and destroy severely infested plants to prevent further spread.
*   Practice crop rotation to disrupt the weevil life cycle.

**Chemical Control (Apply when pest incidence is high):**
*   For adult weevils on foliage:
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Cypermethrin** 25% EC at 0.5 ml/L of water.
*   For corm/root protection (pre-planting dip or soil drench if infestation is known):
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL as a corm dip (e.g., 1 ml/L for 15-30 minutes) or soil drench (0.5 ml/L around the base of plants).
    *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC as a soil drench at 2.5 ml/L of water.

#### 3. Sawflies (e.g., Gladiolus Sawfly - *Ametastegia glabrata*)
**Damage:** The larvae, which resemble small caterpillars, feed on the leaves, creating characteristic holes or causing severe defoliation, especially on young leaves.

**Cultural Control:**
*   Regularly monitor the plants, especially the underside of leaves, for the presence of sawfly larvae.
*   Hand-picking and destruction of larvae can be effective for small infestations.
*   Remove host weeds that may harbor sawflies.

**Chemical Control (Apply when larvae are observed and causing significant damage):**
*   **Malathion** 50% EC at 2 ml/L of water.
*   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 0.5 ml/L of water.
*   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC at 0.3 ml/L of water.
*   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG at 0.4 g/L of water.

### Important Considerations for Chemical Application:
*   **Always read and strictly follow the label instructions** of the specific pesticide product you are using, including dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   **Wear appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)**, such as gloves, masks, and protective clothing, during mixing and application.
*   Apply pesticides during the cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   **Rotate insecticides with different modes of action** to prevent the development of pesticide resistance in pest populations.

For any specific concerns or severe infestations, it is always advisable to consult with the agricultural extension services at HAU, Hisar, for tailored advice.
