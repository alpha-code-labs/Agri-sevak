Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide you with the ideal recommendations for Gladiolus cultivation in Haryana.

Here is the ideal transplantation time, distance, and process for Gladiolus:

### Ideal Transplantation Time

For optimal growth and flowering in Haryana's climate, Gladiolus corms should be planted during the cooler months.

*   **Main Planting Season:** September to November. This allows the plants to establish and flower during the mild winter months, avoiding the extreme heat of summer and heavy monsoon rains.
*   **Staggered Planting:** For a continuous supply of flowers, corms can be planted in batches every 15-20 days from September to December.

### Ideal Transplantation Distance

Proper spacing is crucial for good air circulation, light penetration, and nutrient uptake, leading to healthy plants and quality spikes.

*   **Row-to-Row Spacing:** 30-45 cm
*   **Plant-to-Plant Spacing:** 15-20 cm
*   **Planting Density:** This spacing typically accommodates 100,000 to 150,000 corms per hectare.

### Ideal Transplantation Process

Follow these steps for successful establishment and growth of Gladiolus:

1.  **Corm Selection:**
    *   Use healthy, disease-free corms.
    *   Corms with a diameter of 4-6 cm are generally preferred for producing good quality flower spikes.
    *   Ensure corms have at least one prominent bud (eye).

2.  **Corm Treatment (Pre-Planting):**
    *   To prevent fungal diseases, dip the corms in a fungicide solution before planting.
    *   **Fungicide:** Prepare a solution of **Carbendazim** (0.2%) or **Mancozeb** (0.2%) by mixing 2 grams of the chemical per litre of water.
    *   **Method:** Soak the corms in this solution for 30 minutes.
    *   **Drying:** After treatment, air-dry the corms in the shade for a few hours before planting.

3.  **Land Preparation:**
    *   **Ploughing:** Plough the field deeply (20-30 cm) 2-3 times to achieve a fine, loose tilth.
    *   **Organic Matter:** Incorporate 20-25 tonnes of well-rotted Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost per acre during the last ploughing. This improves soil structure, fertility, and water-holding capacity.
    *   **Levelling:** Level the field properly to ensure uniform irrigation.
    *   **Drainage:** Ensure good drainage, as Gladiolus corms are sensitive to waterlogging. Raised beds can be beneficial in areas prone to water accumulation.

4.  **Planting:**
    *   **Orientation:** Plant the corms with the pointed end facing upwards.
    *   **Depth:** Plant corms 5-10 cm deep. For larger corms or in sandy soils, planting up to 10-15 cm deep can provide better anchorage for the developing flower spike.
    *   **Method:** Place the corms at the recommended spacing in furrows or holes.

5.  **Post-Planting Care:**
    *   **Initial Irrigation:** Immediately after planting, give a light irrigation to settle the soil around the corms.
    *   **Mulching (Optional but Recommended):** Apply a layer of organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves, sugarcane trash) 5-7 cm thick around the planted area. This helps conserve soil moisture, suppress weed growth, and regulate soil temperature.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure a healthy crop of Gladiolus with excellent flower production.
