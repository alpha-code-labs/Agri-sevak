Namaste Kisan bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I will provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing the mentioned pests in Gladiolus, keeping in mind the agro-climatic conditions of Haryana and CIBRC approved chemicals.

Here's how to control the pests you've identified:

### 1. Grasshopper

Grasshoppers are polyphagous pests that can cause significant damage by feeding on leaves, stems, and flowers of Gladiolus, leading to defoliation and reduced aesthetic value.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Keep the field and surrounding areas free of weeds, as weeds provide shelter and alternative food sources for grasshoppers.
    *   Deep ploughing after harvest can expose grasshopper eggs to predators and adverse weather conditions.
*   **Mechanical Control:**
    *   For small infestations, hand-picking and destroying grasshoppers, especially nymphs, can be effective.
    *   Use of insect nets to physically remove them.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   In case of severe infestation, chemical control may be necessary. Apply insecticides during the early morning or late evening when grasshoppers are less active.
    *   **Malathion** 50% EC: Apply at 1.5 - 2.0 ml per litre of water (or 500-750 ml per acre in 200-300 litres of water).
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: Apply at 0.5 ml per litre of water (or 100-150 ml per acre in 200-300 litres of water).
    *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: Apply at 2.0 - 2.5 ml per litre of water (or 500-600 ml per acre in 200-300 litres of water).

### 2. Painted bug (Bagrada hilaris)

This is not known to affect Gladiolus as a significant pest. Painted bug is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops like mustard, cabbage, and radish.

### 3. Red cotton bug (Dysdercus cingulatus)

This is not known to affect Gladiolus. Red cotton bug is primarily a pest of cotton and other malvaceous plants, feeding on developing seeds.

### 4. Black ants

Black ants themselves generally do not directly damage Gladiolus plants by feeding on them. However, they can be a nuisance, build nests around the plant roots, and most importantly, they often 'farm' sap-sucking insects like aphids, mealybugs, or scale insects, protecting them from natural enemies in exchange for honeydew. Their presence can indicate an underlying problem with sap-sucking pests.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Maintain good field sanitation and remove any debris that might serve as nesting sites.
    *   Ensure proper irrigation to avoid overly dry soil conditions that ants might prefer for nesting.
*   **Mechanical Control:**
    *   Locate and destroy ant nests by disturbing them.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   If ants are directly causing a nuisance or are associated with other sap-sucking pests, targeted chemical control can be employed.
    *   **Fipronil** 0.3% GR: Apply as a soil drench or broadcast around the base of plants at 5-10 kg per acre.
    *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: Drench ant nests directly with a solution of 2.0 - 2.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: Spray around the base of plants and along ant trails at 0.5 ml per litre of water.

Always read the label instructions carefully before using any pesticide and follow the recommended safety precautions. For specific local recommendations or further assistance, please contact your nearest Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or HAU extension specialist.
