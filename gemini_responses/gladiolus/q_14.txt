Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling soil pests like termites and nematodes in Gladiolus cultivation in Haryana.

Both termites and root-knot nematodes are significant soil pests that can severely impact Gladiolus corms and root systems, leading to stunted growth, yellowing, reduced flowering, and even plant death.

Here's how you can manage them:

### Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Soil Pests in Gladiolus

A combination of cultural, biological, and chemical methods is recommended for effective and sustainable control.

#### A. Cultural Practices (Preventive Measures)

1.  **Field Sanitation:** Remove all plant debris, stubble, and weeds from the field before planting, as these can harbor pests.
2.  **Deep Ploughing:** Expose soil pests to sunlight and natural predators by deep ploughing during summer. This helps reduce their population.
3.  **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting Gladiolus or other susceptible crops (like tomato, brinjal, okra, cucurbits) continuously in the same field. Rotate with non-host crops such as cereals (wheat, maize), marigold, or mustard for 2-3 years to break the pest life cycle.
4.  **Solarization:** In small areas, solarization (covering moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets during hot summer months for 4-6 weeks) can effectively reduce soil pest populations, including nematodes and termites.
5.  **Use of Healthy Corms:** Always use healthy, disease-free corms for planting. Inspect corms for any signs of damage or pest infestation before planting.
6.  **Organic Matter Addition:** Incorporating well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost into the soil improves soil health and can enhance the activity of beneficial microorganisms that suppress nematodes.

#### B. Biological Control

1.  **Bio-nematicides:** Apply biological agents like *Paecilomyces lilacinus* (now *Purpureocillium lilacinum*) or *Trichoderma harzianum* to the soil.
    *   **Application:** Mix 2.5 kg of *Paecilomyces lilacinus* (1x10^8 CFU/g) or *Trichoderma harzianum* (1x10^8 CFU/g) with 50 kg of well-decomposed FYM or compost. Keep the mixture moist for 7-10 days in a shaded area, then broadcast it uniformly over 1 acre of land and mix it into the soil before planting.

#### C. Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved)

**Important Note:** Chemical control should be used judiciously and as a last resort, following all safety guidelines. Always wear protective gear during application.

**For Termites (Dimag):**

Termites can damage Gladiolus corms directly. Pre-planting soil treatment is most effective.

*   **Soil Treatment (Pre-planting):**
    *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC:** Mix **2.5 litres** of Chlorpyrifos 20% EC in 500-1000 litres of water and drench the soil uniformly over 1 acre before planting. Ensure proper mixing with the soil.
    *   **Fipronil 0.3% GR:** Apply **10-15 kg** of Fipronil 0.3% GR per acre at the time of field preparation and incorporate it into the soil.

**For Nematodes (Root-knot Nematodes):**

Root-knot nematodes cause characteristic galls on roots, leading to nutrient deficiency symptoms.

*   **Soil Treatment (Pre-planting/At planting):**
    *   **Carbofuran 3% GR:** Apply **10-15 kg** of Carbofuran 3% GR per acre at the time of planting or before planting and incorporate it into the soil. This provides systemic protection.
    *   **Phorate 10% GR:** Apply **4 kg** of Phorate 10% GR per acre at the time of planting and incorporate it into the soil.
    *   **Fluensulfone 2% GR:** Apply **20 kg** of Fluensulfone 2% GR per acre at the time of planting and incorporate it into the soil. This is a newer, effective nematicide.

**Corm Treatment (for both pests, especially nematodes):**

*   **Hot Water Treatment:** For nematode-infested corms, hot water treatment can be effective. Dip corms in hot water at 50°C for 30 minutes. Ensure precise temperature control to avoid damaging the corms. This is a non-chemical method.
*   **Chemical Corm Dip (for Termites and early nematode protection):**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Dip Gladiolus corms in a solution of **2 ml** of Imidacloprid 17.8% SL per litre of water for 15-20 minutes before planting. Allow them to air dry in shade before planting. This provides protection against sucking pests and some soil pests.

**Recommendation:**

For optimal control, especially in fields with a history of these pests, it is advisable to combine cultural practices with either biological control or a suitable chemical treatment before planting. Always consult with your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and current CIBRC guidelines.
