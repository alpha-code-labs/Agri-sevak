As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Gladiolus in Haryana. It is crucial to adopt an integrated approach combining cultural practices with timely and appropriate chemical interventions.

**General Cultural Practices for Fungal Disease Management in Gladiolus:**
*   **Use Healthy Corms:** Always start with disease-free corms from reputable sources. Treat corms with a fungicide before planting if there's a history of disease.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate spacing between plants to promote good air circulation, which reduces humidity around the foliage and inhibits fungal growth.
*   **Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy infected plant debris (leaves, flowers, stems) from the field to reduce inoculum sources.
*   **Water Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day, as wet foliage for extended periods favors fungal development. Drip irrigation is preferable.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate Gladiolus with non-host crops to break disease cycles in the soil.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced fertilization. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can lead to lush, succulent growth more susceptible to fungal infections.

Here's how to control the specific fungal diseases you mentioned:

### 1. Alternaria (Alternaria Leaf Spot/Blight)
*   **Affects Gladiolus:** Yes, *Alternaria gladioli* is a known pathogen.
*   **Symptoms:** Small, reddish-brown spots with purplish margins appear on leaves, which enlarge and coalesce, leading to blighting of the foliage.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Cultural:** Implement good field sanitation and ensure proper plant spacing.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   Spray with **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2-2.5 g/L of water.
        *   Alternatively, use **Chlorothalonil** (75% WP) at 2-2.5 g/L of water.
        *   For systemic action, **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC) at 0.5-1 ml/L of water can be effective.

### 2. Anthracnose
*   **Affects Gladiolus:** Yes, *Colletotrichum* species can cause anthracnose in Gladiolus.
*   **Symptoms:** Irregular, sunken spots with dark margins appear on leaves, stems, and flowers. Severe infections can lead to flower blight and stem dieback.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Cultural:** Remove and destroy infected plant parts promptly. Ensure good air circulation.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   Apply **Carbendazim** (50% WP) at 0.5-1 g/L of water.
        *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2-2.5 g/L of water provides good protective action.
        *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC) at 0.5-1 ml/L of water offers broad-spectrum control.

### 3. Blast
*   **Affects Gladiolus:** The term "Blast" as a specific disease (like Rice Blast) is not commonly used for Gladiolus. However, rapid blighting or death of flowers/buds can occur due to various fungal pathogens (e.g., *Botrytis*, *Curvularia*). If referring to a general symptom of rapid tissue death caused by fungi, broad-spectrum fungicides are applicable.
*   **Control Measures (assuming general rapid blighting symptom):**
    *   **Cultural:** Improve air circulation, reduce humidity, and promptly remove any affected plant parts.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   Spray with **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC) at 0.5-1 ml/L of water.
        *   **Chlorothalonil** (75% WP) at 2-2.5 g/L of water can be used.
        *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2-2.5 g/L of water provides protective action.

### 4. Blight (General Blight)
*   **Affects Gladiolus:** Yes, various fungi such as *Botrytis*, *Curvularia*, and *Fusarium* can cause blights in Gladiolus.
*   **Symptoms:** Rapid browning, wilting, and death of leaves, stems, or flowers.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Cultural:** Maintain strict field sanitation, ensure proper plant spacing, and avoid overhead irrigation. Remove and destroy all infected plant debris.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   Apply **Chlorothalonil** (75% WP) at 2-2.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2-2.5 g/L of water is effective as a protective spray.
        *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC) at 0.5-1 ml/L of water provides systemic control.
        *   For *Botrytis blight* (Grey Mould), specifically, **Carbendazim** (50% WP) at 0.5-1 g/L of water is recommended.

### 5. Brown Spot
*   **Affects Gladiolus:** Yes, *Curvularia gladioli* is a common cause of brown spot.
*   **Symptoms:** Small, circular to oval, reddish-brown spots appear on leaves, often surrounded by a yellow halo.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Cultural:** Use healthy, disease-free corms and maintain good field sanitation.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   Spray with **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2-2.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Carbendazim** (50% WP) at 0.5-1 g/L of water can be used.
        *   **Propiconazole** (25% EC) at 0.5-1 ml/L of water provides systemic control.

### 6. Downy Mildew
*   **Affects Gladiolus:** Yes, *Peronospora gladioli* is a known pathogen.
*   **Symptoms:** Yellowish spots appear on the upper leaf surface, with corresponding purplish-grey fuzzy growth on the underside. Can lead to stunting and distortion of plants.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Cultural:** Ensure good drainage and air circulation. Avoid excessive humidity.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   Apply **Fosetyl-aluminium** (80% WP) at 2-2.5 g/L of water, which is specific for Oomycetes.
        *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC) at 0.5-1 ml/L of water is also effective.
        *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2-2.5 g/L of water can be used as a protective spray.

### 7. Powdery Mildew
*   **Affects Gladiolus:** Yes, *Oidium gladioli* is reported to cause powdery mildew.
*   **Symptoms:** White, powdery patches appear on leaves, stems, and flower buds, leading to distortion, reduced photosynthesis, and weakened plants.

### 8. Grey Mildew (Grey Mould / Botrytis Blight)
*   **Affects Gladiolus:** Yes, *Botrytis cinerea* is a very common and destructive pathogen.
*   **Symptoms:** Greyish-brown fuzzy mould develops on flowers, buds, leaves, and stems, especially under cool, wet, and humid conditions. It causes blighting, rotting, and can lead to significant post-harvest losses.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Cultural:** Immediately remove and destroy all infected plant parts. Improve air circulation, reduce humidity, and avoid overhead irrigation.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   Apply **Carbendazim** (50% WP) at 0.5-1 g/L of water.
        *   **Chlorothalonil** (75% WP) at 2-2.5 g/L of water is effective.
        *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC) at 0.5-1 ml/L of water provides broad-spectrum control.

**Important Considerations for Chemical Application:**
*   **Fungicide Rotation:** To prevent the development of fungicide resistance, always rotate fungicides with different modes of action. Do not use the same chemical repeatedly.
*   **Preventive Application:** Fungicides are most effective when applied preventively or at the very first sign of disease, before the infection becomes widespread.
*   **Thorough Coverage:** Ensure complete and thorough coverage of all plant surfaces (upper and lower leaf surfaces, stems) for optimal efficacy.
*   **Adherence to Label Instructions:** Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the product label regarding dosage, application timing, safety precautions, and pre-harvest intervals.
*   **Water Quality:** Use clean water for mixing fungicides. Adjust pH if necessary, as some fungicides are sensitive to alkaline water.

By implementing these measures, you can effectively manage fungal diseases in your Gladiolus crop. For specific local recommendations or severe outbreaks, please consult with the plant pathology department at HAU, Hisar.
