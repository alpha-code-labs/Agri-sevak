Rust diseases, particularly Gladiolus Rust caused by *Uromyces transversalis*, are a significant concern for Gladiolus cultivation in Haryana. While the question lists various rust types (Black, Brown, Yellow, White, and Red), the primary rust affecting Gladiolus is typically referred to as Gladiolus Rust, which manifests as reddish-brown pustules. The control measures generally apply to rust fungi affecting Gladiolus.

**Symptoms:**
Characteristic reddish-brown, powdery pustules appear predominantly on the upper and lower surfaces of leaves, and sometimes on stems and flower stalks. These pustules rupture the epidermis, releasing spores. Severe infection can lead to premature yellowing, drying, and death of leaves, significantly impacting flower quality and corm development.

**Integrated Management Strategies for Rust Diseases in Gladiolus:**

**A. Cultural and Preventive Measures:**
1.  **Disease-Free Corms:** Always use healthy, certified disease-free corms for planting.
2.  **Sanitation:** Promptly remove and destroy infected plant debris (leaves, stems) from the field to reduce the inoculum source. Do not compost infected material.
3.  **Spacing:** Maintain adequate plant spacing to ensure good air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce leaf wetness and humidity, thereby discouraging rust development.
4.  **Irrigation Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day, as prolonged leaf wetness promotes spore germination and infection. Drip irrigation is preferable. If overhead irrigation is unavoidable, do it in the morning to allow leaves to dry quickly.
5.  **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops to break the disease cycle.
6.  **Resistant Varieties:** Where available and suitable for local conditions, consider planting rust-resistant Gladiolus varieties.

**B. Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
Timely application of fungicides is crucial, especially during periods conducive to rust development (moderate temperatures and high humidity). It is recommended to alternate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of fungicide resistance.

For effective control, consider the following CIBRC approved fungicides:

*   **For Preventive Application (Contact Fungicides):**
    *   **Mancozeb 75% WP:** Apply at a rate of 2.0-2.5 grams per litre of water. Start spraying when the first symptoms appear or as a preventive measure during humid weather.
    *   **Chlorothalonil 75% WP:** Apply at a rate of 2.0 grams per litre of water.

*   **For Curative and Systemic Control (Systemic Fungicides):**
    *   **Propiconazole 25% EC:** Apply at a rate of 0.5-1.0 ml per litre of water. This systemic fungicide provides both protective and curative action.
    *   **Difenoconazole 25% EC:** Apply at a rate of 0.5 ml per litre of water. Another effective systemic triazole fungicide.
    *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:** Apply at a rate of 0.5-1.0 ml per litre of water. This strobilurin fungicide offers broad-spectrum control and has systemic and translaminar action.
    *   **Kresoxim-methyl 50% WG:** Apply at a rate of 0.5 grams per litre of water. Another systemic strobilurin fungicide effective against rusts.

**Application Schedule:**
1.  Start with a preventive spray of a contact fungicide like **Mancozeb** or **Chlorothalonil** if conditions are favourable for rust development.
2.  Upon the first appearance of rust symptoms, switch to a systemic fungicide such as **Propiconazole**, **Difenoconazole**, or **Azoxystrobin**.
3.  Repeat sprays at 10-15 day intervals, depending on disease severity and weather conditions.
4.  Rotate between different classes of fungicides (e.g., Triazoles, Strobilurins, Dithiocarbamates) to manage resistance. For example, alternate **Mancozeb** with **Propiconazole**, and then with **Azoxystrobin**.

Always read and follow the instructions on the fungicide label for specific dosage, safety precautions, and pre-harvest intervals.
