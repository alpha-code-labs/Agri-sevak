As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in Gladiolus in Haryana:

### General Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Principles for Gladiolus:

*   **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your Gladiolus plants for any signs of pest infestation (e.g., holes in leaves, rolled leaves, frass, visible larvae). Early detection is key for effective control.
*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Maintain good field sanitation by removing weeds and plant debris, which can harbor pests.
    *   Ensure proper spacing and nutrition to promote healthy, vigorous plants that are more resilient to pest attacks.
    *   Use healthy, certified corms to prevent introducing pests.
*   **Biological Control:** Encourage natural enemies like predatory insects (ladybugs, lacewings) and parasitic wasps.

### Specific Pest Control Recommendations:

#### 1. Borers (Stem Borers, Corm Borers)

Borers can cause significant damage by tunneling into stems or corms, leading to wilting, stunted growth, and plant death.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural:**
    *   Remove and destroy any infested plant parts or entire plants showing signs of borer damage to prevent further spread.
    *   Practice crop rotation.
*   **Chemical (for severe infestations):**
    *   **For Stem Borers (Foliar Spray):**
        *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC at 0.3 ml per liter of water.
        *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG at 0.2-0.4 g per liter of water.
        *   **Cartap hydrochloride** 50% SP at 1-2 g per liter of water.
    *   **For Corm Borers (Soil Drench/Granular Application at planting):**
        *   **Fipronil** 5% SC as a soil drench at 1.5-2 ml per liter of water around the base of the plants.
        *   **Cartap hydrochloride** 4% G at 10-15 kg per acre, applied in the soil at planting or as a side dressing.

#### 2. Caterpillars (Defoliators, Cutworms, Armyworms)

Various caterpillar species can feed on Gladiolus leaves, flowers, and sometimes cut young shoots.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural:**
    *   Hand-pick larger caterpillars in small infestations.
    *   Keep the field free of weeds, which can serve as alternate hosts.
*   **Biological:**
    *   Apply formulations of **Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)** at 1-2 g or ml per liter of water, especially effective against young larvae.
*   **Chemical (for severe infestations):**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC at 0.3 ml per liter of water.
    *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG at 0.2-0.4 g per liter of water.
    *   **Flubendiamide** 20% WG at 0.2-0.3 g per liter of water.
    *   **Indoxacarb** 14.5% SC at 0.5 ml per liter of water.
    *   **Spinosad** 45% SC at 0.2-0.3 ml per liter of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 0.5-1 ml per liter of water (for quick knockdown).

#### 3. Diamondback Moth (DBM)

This is not known to affect Gladiolus. Diamondback moth (*Plutella xylostella*) is a highly specific pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower, mustard).

#### 4. Leaf Folder

Leaf folders roll or fold leaves and feed from within the protective fold, causing damage to the foliage.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural:**
    *   Remove and destroy any folded leaves containing larvae to reduce pest population.
*   **Chemical (for severe infestations):**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC at 0.3 ml per liter of water.
    *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG at 0.2-0.4 g per liter of water.
    *   **Flubendiamide** 20% WG at 0.2-0.3 g per liter of water.
    *   **Indoxacarb** 14.5% SC at 0.5 ml per liter of water.
    *   **Quinalphos** 25% EC at 2 ml per liter of water.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully, including dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.
*   Apply pesticides during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   Ensure thorough spray coverage for contact insecticides.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension office or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions.
