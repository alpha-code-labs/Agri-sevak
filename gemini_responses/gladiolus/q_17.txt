As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend the following doses of organic manures for Gladiolus cultivation in Haryana to ensure optimal growth and flowering:

*   **Farm Yard Manure (FYM):**
    *   Apply 15-20 tonnes per acre (approximately 3.75-5 kg per square meter) of well-decomposed FYM.
    *   This should be thoroughly incorporated into the soil during land preparation, at least 2-3 weeks before planting the corms.
    *   FYM improves soil structure, water retention, and provides a slow release of essential nutrients.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   Apply 4-5 tonnes per acre (approximately 1-1.25 kg per square meter) of high-quality vermicompost.
    *   Vermicompost can be incorporated into the soil during land preparation along with FYM, or applied as a top-dressing around the plants at the time of planting or during early growth stages.
    *   It provides readily available nutrients and beneficial microbes, enhancing plant vigor.

*   **Sagarika:**
    *   **Sagarika** is a seaweed extract-based plant growth stimulant, not a bulk organic manure like FYM or vermicompost. It is used to enhance nutrient uptake and overall plant health.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** For liquid **Sagarika**, prepare a solution of 2-3 ml per liter of water. Spray this solution uniformly on the foliage at critical growth stages, such as 30-45 days after planting and again at the bud initiation stage.
    *   **Soil Application (Granular):** For granular **Sagarika**, apply 8-10 kg per acre by broadcasting and light incorporation into the soil, preferably at the time of planting or within 30 days of planting.
    *   **Soil Application (Liquid Drench):** For liquid **Sagarika**, it can also be applied as a soil drench at 1-2 liters per acre mixed with irrigation water, especially during early growth stages.
