As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling these conditions in Gladiolus, specifically for the Haryana region:

### Control of Scab in Gladiolus

Gladiolus scab is a common disease primarily caused by the bacterium *Pseudomonas gladioli* (bacterial scab) or the actinomycete *Streptomyces gladioli* (actinomycete scab). It manifests as sunken, dark lesions on corms, which can reduce their marketability and vigor.

**Integrated Management Strategy:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Corm Selection:** Always plant healthy, disease-free corms. Inspect corms carefully before planting and discard any showing lesions or discoloration.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Practice a minimum of 3-4 years of crop rotation with non-host plants to reduce the pathogen inoculum in the soil.
    *   **Soil Drainage:** Ensure well-drained soil. Avoid waterlogging, as excessive moisture favors disease development.
    *   **Sanitation:** Clean and sanitize all planting tools, equipment, and storage areas regularly. Remove and destroy infected plant debris promptly.
    *   **Planting Depth:** Plant corms at an appropriate depth to ensure good aeration.

2.  **Chemical Control (Corm Treatment):**
    For effective control and to protect corms from soil-borne pathogens, a pre-planting corm treatment is highly recommended.

    *   **Fungicide Dip:** Before planting, dip the gladiolus corms for 30 minutes in a solution of:
        *   **Carbendazim 50% WP** at 2 grams per litre of water.
        *   **Mancozeb 75% WP** at 2 grams per litre of water.
        *   (Prepare a combined solution of both chemicals in water).
    *   Allow the corms to air dry in shade before planting. This treatment helps protect against scab and other fungal diseases.

### Canker in Gladiolus

This is not known to affect Gladiolus. The term "canker" is typically used to describe localized dead areas on the stems, branches, or trunks of woody plants (trees and shrubs), often caused by fungi or bacteria. While Gladiolus can suffer from stem rots or basal rots, these are not generally referred to as cankers.

### Gummosis in Gladiolus

This is not known to affect Gladiolus. Gummosis is the exudation of gum from wounds or cankers, primarily observed in stone fruit trees (e.g., peach, plum) and citrus, as a physiological response to stress, injury, or disease. Gladiolus, being a herbaceous plant, does not exhibit gummosis.

### Lichen in Gladiolus

This is not known to affect Gladiolus. Lichens are symbiotic organisms (fungus and alga/cyanobacterium) that grow on surfaces like tree bark, rocks, or soil. They are non-parasitic and do not directly harm the plant they grow on. They are not typically found growing on the herbaceous parts of Gladiolus plants as a disease or pest.
