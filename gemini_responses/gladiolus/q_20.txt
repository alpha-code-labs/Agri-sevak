Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified recommendations for addressing micronutrient deficiencies in Gladiolus, keeping in mind the specific conditions of Haryana.

It is crucial to conduct a soil test to accurately diagnose specific deficiencies and determine the precise quantities required. However, general recommendations for foliar and soil applications are provided below. Foliar applications are often preferred for quick correction of deficiencies, especially in alkaline soils common in Haryana, as nutrient uptake from soil can be hindered.

### Addressing Micro-nutrient Deficiencies in Gladiolus

**1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency**
*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, 'little leaf' symptom (abnormally small leaves), interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, sometimes bronzing.
*   **Recommendations:**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Apply 0.2-0.5% solution of **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** or 0.1% solution of **Zinc EDTA**. Repeat at 15-20 day intervals if symptoms persist.
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 10-25 kg/acre of **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** at the time of land preparation or planting, based on soil test recommendations.

**2. Iron (Fe) Deficiency**
*   **Symptoms:** Pronounced interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, leading to a complete yellowing or whitening of the leaves in severe cases.
*   **Recommendations:**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Apply 0.5-1.0% solution of **Ferrous sulphate** or 0.1-0.2% solution of **Ferrous EDTA**. Repeat every 7-10 days until symptoms disappear. Foliar application is highly effective in alkaline soils.
    *   **Soil Application:** For severe cases, 25-50 kg/acre of **Ferrous sulphate** can be applied, but its effectiveness can be limited in high pH soils.

**3. Boron (B) Deficiency**
*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, thickening and brittleness of young leaves, cracking of stems, poor flower development, malformed or aborted flowers, and sometimes 'blindness' of flower buds.
*   **Recommendations:**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Apply 0.1-0.2% solution of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** or **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate). Apply at pre-flowering stage.
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 4-8 kg/acre of **Borax** at the time of planting, based on soil test results.

**4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency**
*   **Symptoms:** Necrosis (death) of young leaves and growing points, stunted root growth, poor flower quality, and sometimes 'tip burn' on leaves.
*   **Recommendations:**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Apply 0.5-1.0% solution of **Calcium nitrate** or 0.5% solution of **Calcium chloride**. Apply during active growth and pre-flowering stages.
    *   **Soil Application:** **Calcium nitrate** can be incorporated into the regular fertilizer schedule. In soils with very low calcium, liming (if pH is also low) or gypsum application can be considered, but this is less common in Haryana's soils for calcium deficiency alone.

**5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency**
*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, starting from the leaf margins and progressing inwards, often giving a 'herringbone' pattern. Leaves may become brittle.
*   **Recommendations:**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Apply 0.5-1.0% solution of **Magnesium sulphate**. Repeat at 15-20 day intervals if symptoms persist.
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 10-20 kg/acre of **Magnesium sulphate** at the time of planting or as a side-dressing, based on soil test recommendations.

**6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency**
*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, often similar to iron deficiency but sometimes accompanied by small necrotic spots. Overall stunted growth.
*   **Recommendations:**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Apply 0.5-1.0% solution of **Manganese sulphate** or 0.1-0.2% solution of **Manganese EDTA**. Repeat at 10-15 day intervals if symptoms persist.
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 10-20 kg/acre of **Manganese sulphate** at the time of planting, based on soil test results.

**General Considerations for Micronutrient Application:**

*   **Soil Testing:** Always prioritize soil testing to get precise recommendations for your specific field.
*   **Timing:** Foliar sprays are best applied during the cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to maximize absorption and minimize leaf scorch.
*   **Water Quality:** Use clean water for preparing spray solutions.
*   **Compatibility:** Avoid mixing different micronutrient solutions or with other pesticides unless compatibility is confirmed.
*   **Prevention:** Regular application of well-balanced fertilizers, including micronutrient mixtures, can help prevent deficiencies. Organic matter incorporation also improves micronutrient availability.
