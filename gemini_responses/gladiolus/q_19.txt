As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I advise the following scientifically verified approaches to address macro-nutrient deficiencies in Gladiolus in Haryana:

Firstly, it is paramount to conduct a soil test to accurately diagnose the specific nutrient deficiency and its severity. Visual symptoms can be indicative, but a soil test provides precise data for tailored recommendations.

### Addressing Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** General yellowing of older leaves, stunted growth, pale green foliage, reduced flower size and number, and poor spike development.

**Correction:**
For soil application (basal or top-dressing):
*   **Urea** (46% N): Apply 20-30 kg/acre as a top-dressing if deficiency is observed after initial growth. For general cultivation, a total of 100-120 kg N/acre is recommended, split into 2-3 applications (at planting, 30-45 days after planting, and pre-flowering).
*   **Calcium Ammonium Nitrate (CAN)** (25% N): Can be used as an alternative to Urea, applying 40-60 kg/acre as a top-dressing.
*   **Ammonium Sulphate** (20.5% N): Apply 50-75 kg/acre as a top-dressing, especially beneficial if sulfur deficiency is also suspected.

For quick foliar correction:
*   **Urea**: Prepare a 0.5-1% solution (5-10 g/L water) and spray on foliage, preferably in the morning or late afternoon. Repeat after 7-10 days if needed.
*   **Potassium Nitrate** (13% N, 45% K2O): If potassium deficiency is also present, a 0.5-1% solution (5-10 g/L water) can be used as a foliar spray.

### Addressing Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Purplish discoloration of older leaves, stunted growth, poor root development, delayed flowering, and reduced flower spike quality.

**Correction:**
Phosphorus is less mobile in soil, so basal application is most effective. For existing deficiency, soil application might be slower to show results.
For soil application (basal or top-dressing):
*   **Single Superphosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5): Apply 300-400 kg/acre as a basal dose at the time of planting. If deficiency is observed later, a top-dressing of 50-75 kg/acre can be applied, though its effectiveness will be slower.
*   **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5): Apply 130-175 kg/acre as a basal dose. This also provides some nitrogen.
*   **Monoammonium Phosphate (MAP)** (11% N, 52% P2O5): Apply 115-150 kg/acre as a basal dose.

For quick foliar correction:
*   **Monoammonium Phosphate (MAP)**: Prepare a 0.5-1% solution (5-10 g/L water) and spray on foliage. Repeat after 7-10 days if needed.

### Addressing Potassium (K) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Scorching or browning of leaf margins (starting from older leaves), weak stems, poor flower quality, reduced vase life, and increased susceptibility to diseases and stress.

**Correction:**
For soil application (basal or top-dressing):
*   **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** / **Potassium Chloride** (60% K2O): Apply 100-130 kg/acre as a basal dose. If deficiency is observed, a top-dressing of 20-30 kg/acre can be applied. For general cultivation, a total of 60-80 kg K2O/acre is recommended, split into 2 applications (at planting and pre-flowering).
*   **Sulphate of Potash (SOP)** / **Potassium Sulphate** (50% K2O, 17.5% S): Apply 120-160 kg/acre as a basal dose. This is also beneficial if sulfur deficiency is suspected.

For quick foliar correction:
*   **Potassium Nitrate** (13% N, 45% K2O): Prepare a 0.5-1% solution (5-10 g/L water) and spray on foliage. Repeat after 7-10 days if needed.
*   **Potassium Sulphate**: Prepare a 0.5-1% solution (5-10 g/L water) and spray on foliage.

**General Recommendations for Gladiolus in Haryana:**

*   **Soil Testing:** Always begin with a comprehensive soil test to determine existing nutrient levels and soil pH. This allows for precise fertilizer recommendations, preventing over-application and nutrient imbalances.
*   **Balanced Fertilization:** While addressing specific deficiencies, ensure a balanced nutrient supply. Over-application of one nutrient can induce deficiencies of others.
*   **Organic Matter:** Incorporating well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost (20-25 tonnes/acre) significantly improves soil health, nutrient retention, and microbial activity, enhancing nutrient availability.
*   **Irrigation:** Ensure adequate and timely irrigation, as water is crucial for nutrient uptake by plants.
*   **Timing:** Apply fertilizers at appropriate growth stages for maximum efficacy. Basal applications are incorporated before planting, while top-dressings are applied during active growth.
