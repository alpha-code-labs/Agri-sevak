Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I understand your concern regarding the potential harmful effects of weedicides/herbicides on your Gladiolus crop. While herbicides can be effective tools for weed management, improper use can lead to phytotoxicity and reduced yield. The key to minimizing harm lies in judicious selection, precise application, and integrated weed management practices.

Here's how you can reduce the harmful effects of weedicides/herbicides in Gladiolus:

**I. Pre-Application Planning and Selection:**

*   **Choose Selective Herbicides:** Always select herbicides specifically recommended and known to be safe for Gladiolus. Non-selective herbicides will severely damage or kill your crop.
    *   **Pre-emergence Herbicides (applied before Gladiolus sprouts emerge):** These are generally safer for Gladiolus.
        *   **Pendimethalin** (e.g., 30% EC or 38.7% CS): Apply at 1.0-1.5 kg active ingredient per acre (approx. 3.3-5.0 L of 30% EC or 2.6-3.9 L of 38.7% CS per acre) within 3-5 days of planting corms.
        *   **Oxyfluorfen** (e.g., 23.5% EC): Apply at 0.2-0.3 kg active ingredient per acre (approx. 850-1275 ml of 23.5% EC per acre) within 3-5 days of planting corms.
        *   **Metribuzin** (e.g., 70% WP): Can be used at lower doses (0.25-0.35 kg active ingredient per acre, approx. 350-500 g of 70% WP per acre) as a pre-emergence application. *However, use with extreme caution as some Gladiolus varieties can be sensitive to Metribuzin.*
    *   **Post-emergence Herbicides (applied after Gladiolus sprouts emerge):** Options are very limited for broadleaf weeds without causing severe crop injury. For grassy weeds, selective graminicides can be used with caution.
        *   **Quizalofop-ethyl** (e.g., 5% EC): For control of grassy weeds, apply at 0.05-0.1 kg active ingredient per acre (approx. 1.0-2.0 L of 5% EC per acre) when weeds are at 2-4 leaf stage. *Apply as a directed spray or spot application to minimize contact with Gladiolus foliage.*
        *   **Fluazifop-P-butyl** (e.g., 13.4% EC): For control of grassy weeds, apply at 0.1-0.2 kg active ingredient per acre (approx. 750-1500 ml of 13.4% EC per acre) when weeds are at 2-4 leaf stage. *Apply as a directed spray or spot application to minimize contact with Gladiolus foliage.*
*   **Accurate Dosage:** Always adhere strictly to the recommended dosage. Overdosing is a primary cause of phytotoxicity. Calibrate your sprayer regularly to ensure correct application rates.
*   **Timing of Application:**
    *   **Pre-emergence herbicides MUST be applied before the Gladiolus sprouts emerge from the soil.** Applying them after emergence will cause severe damage.
    *   Post-emergence herbicides should be applied when weeds are young and actively growing (typically 2-4 leaf stage) for best efficacy and to minimize the total amount of chemical needed.
*   **Soil Conditions:** Ensure adequate soil moisture for pre-emergence herbicides to be effective and safe. Dry soil can lead to poor activation or uneven distribution.

**II. During Application Practices:**

*   **Proper Application Technique:**
    *   Use appropriate spray nozzles (e.g., flat fan nozzles) for uniform coverage.
    *   Maintain consistent spray pressure and speed.
    *   Use the recommended spray volume (e.g., 500 L of water per acre) to ensure good coverage.
*   **Avoid Drift:** Do not spray during windy conditions to prevent herbicide drift onto Gladiolus foliage or adjacent sensitive crops.
*   **Environmental Conditions:** Avoid spraying during extreme temperatures (very hot or very cold) as this can increase crop stress and herbicide uptake, leading to injury.
*   **Crop Health:** Ensure your Gladiolus crop is healthy and not under any stress (e.g., water stress, nutrient deficiency, pest/disease attack) before applying herbicides. Stressed plants are more susceptible to herbicide injury.

**III. Post-Application and Integrated Weed Management (IWM):**

*   **Monitor Crop Response:** After application, regularly inspect your Gladiolus plants for any signs of stress or injury (e.g., yellowing, stunting, leaf malformation). Early detection can help in taking corrective measures.
*   **Supportive Care:** If mild herbicide injury occurs, provide optimal growing conditions to help the plants recover. This includes adequate irrigation and balanced fertilization.
*   **Reduce Reliance on Herbicides:** Incorporate Integrated Weed Management (IWM) practices to minimize the overall use of herbicides:
    *   **Manual Weeding:** Hand weeding or hoeing can be very effective, especially for initial weed flushes or for weeds that escape herbicide treatment.
    *   **Mulching:** Applying organic mulches (e.g., straw, dry leaves) or plastic mulches can effectively suppress weed growth and conserve soil moisture.
    *   **Proper Land Preparation:** Thorough ploughing and harrowing before planting can reduce the weed seed bank in the soil.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Rotating Gladiolus with other crops can help manage specific weed problems and reduce herbicide resistance development.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively manage weeds in your Gladiolus crop while minimizing the risk of herbicide-induced damage. Always consult with your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions.
