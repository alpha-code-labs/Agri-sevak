As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an integrated weed management approach for Gladiolus, combining cultural practices with the judicious use of CIBRC-approved herbicides. Pre-emergence herbicide application is generally the most effective and safest chemical method for Gladiolus.

### General Weed Control Strategy

1.  **Field Preparation:** Ensure thorough land preparation to remove existing weeds and their propagules before planting.
2.  **Clean Planting Material:** Use disease-free and weed-free corms to prevent the introduction of weed seeds.
3.  **Inter-cultivation/Manual Weeding:** Regular shallow inter-cultivation or manual weeding is highly effective, especially in the early stages of crop growth (first 60 days). This is particularly important for post-emergence control of grass weeds where chemical options are limited in Gladiolus.

### Chemical Weed Control

#### Pre-emergence Herbicides (for Broadleaf, Narrowleaf, Bathu, Congress grass, Phalaris minor)

These herbicides should be applied within 3 days of planting Gladiolus corms, before weed emergence, to a moist soil surface. Ensure uniform spray coverage.

*   **Pendimethalin:**
    *   **Technical Name:** Pendimethalin
    *   **Dosage:** 1.0 - 1.5 kg active ingredient (a.i.) per acre.
    *   **Formulation Example:** For a 30% EC formulation, use 3.3 - 5.0 Litres per acre. For a 38.7% CS formulation, use 2.6 - 3.9 Litres per acre.
    *   **Application:** Mix the recommended quantity in 200-250 Litres of water and spray uniformly over one acre.
    *   **Efficacy:** Controls a wide range of annual broadleaf and narrowleaf weeds.

*   **Oxyfluorfen:**
    *   **Technical Name:** Oxyfluorfen
    *   **Dosage:** 0.15 - 0.25 kg active ingredient (a.i.) per acre.
    *   **Formulation Example:** For a 23.5% EC formulation, use 640 - 1060 ml per acre.
    *   **Application:** Mix the recommended quantity in 200-250 Litres of water and spray uniformly over one acre.
    *   **Efficacy:** Effective against many annual broadleaf weeds and some grasses.

#### Post-emergence Herbicides

*   **For Broadleaf Weeds (e.g., Bathu, Congress grass):**
    *   Selective post-emergence broadleaf herbicides are generally not recommended for Gladiolus due to potential phytotoxicity to the crop. Manual weeding is the safest and most effective method for controlling broadleaf weeds that emerge after crop planting.

*   **For Narrowleaf Weeds / Grasses (e.g., Phalaris minor):**
    *   Gladiolus is a monocotyledonous plant. Therefore, selective post-emergence herbicides designed to control grass weeds in broadleaf crops are not safe for Gladiolus.
    *   **Recommendation:** Manual weeding is the primary and most reliable method for controlling narrowleaf weeds and grasses that emerge after crop planting.

#### Specific Weed Control

*   **Amarbail (Cuscuta spp.):**
    *   **Prevention:** Use clean planting material and avoid bringing contaminated soil or manure into the field.
    *   **Control:** Manual removal of Amarbail as soon as it is observed is the most effective method. Remove the parasitic strands along with the host plant parts they are attached to, before they produce seeds. Pre-emergence herbicides like **Pendimethalin** and **Oxyfluorfen** can offer some suppression of Cuscuta germination.

*   **Orobanche (Broomrape):**
    *   This is not known to affect Gladiolus. Orobanche species are root parasites primarily of dicotyledonous crops (e.g., mustard, tomato, brinjal, tobacco, sunflower). Gladiolus is a monocotyledonous plant and is not a host for Orobanche.

Always follow the label instructions of the specific product for safe and effective use, including precautions and recommended application rates.
