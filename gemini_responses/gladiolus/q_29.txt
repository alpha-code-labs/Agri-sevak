As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide scientifically verified advice regarding your query for Gladiolus.

First, let's clarify the terms you've used:

*   **Fruit drop** is not known to affect Gladiolus, as Gladiolus is cultivated for its flowers, not its fruit.
*   **Tinda/Boll dropping** is not known to affect Gladiolus. Tinda is a vegetable crop, and boll dropping refers to cotton.

Therefore, we will focus on **Flower drop** or premature senescence of florets in Gladiolus.

**Understanding Flower Drop in Gladiolus:**

Direct "flower drop" as a primary disease or pest issue, where entire flowers detach prematurely, is not a common problem in Gladiolus in the same way as fruit drop in fruit trees. However, poor flower development, premature wilting, or failure of florets to open properly can occur, which might be perceived as "dropping" or poor flower quality. These issues are typically due to a combination of physiological, environmental, and pest-related factors rather than a specific "dropping" disease.

Direct chemical interventions (like plant growth regulators used for fruit drop in other crops) specifically to *prevent* flower drop in Gladiolus are not standard or recommended practices. The focus should be on optimizing growing conditions and managing underlying stressors.

**Key Factors Contributing to Poor Flower Quality/Premature Senescence and Management Strategies:**

1.  **Environmental Stress:**
    *   **Water Management:** Both drought stress and waterlogging can negatively impact flower development. Ensure consistent and adequate irrigation, especially during spike emergence and flowering.
    *   **Temperature Extremes:** High temperatures can accelerate senescence and reduce flower longevity.
    *   **Nutrient Imbalance:** Deficiencies or excesses of essential nutrients can weaken the plant. A balanced fertilization program based on soil testing is crucial. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can promote vegetative growth at the expense of flowering and make plants more susceptible to pests/diseases.

2.  **Pest Infestation (Most Critical for Flower Quality):**
    *   **Thrips (e.g., Gladiolus Thrips, *Taeniothrips simplex*):** This is the most significant pest affecting Gladiolus flowers. Thrips feed on developing buds and florets, causing silvery streaks, distortion, browning, and failure of florets to open properly, leading to a perception of poor quality or "dropping."
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural:** Remove and destroy infested plant parts. Keep the field free of weeds, which can harbor thrips.
        *   **Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved):** Apply insecticides at the first sign of infestation, especially when flower spikes begin to emerge.
            *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** 0.5 ml per litre of water (or 100-125 ml per acre in 200-250 litres of water).
            *   **Fipronil 5% SC:** 1.5-2.0 ml per litre of water (or 300-400 ml per acre in 200 litres of water).
            *   **Spinosad 45% SC:** 0.25 ml per litre of water (or 64-75 ml per acre in 250-300 litres of water).

3.  **Disease Management:**
    *   Diseases like Fusarium wilt, Botrytis blight, and various corm rots can weaken the plant, indirectly affecting flower quality and longevity.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Use healthy, disease-free corms.
        *   Practice crop rotation.
        *   Ensure good drainage.
        *   Treat corms with fungicides before planting if disease history is known (e.g., **Carbendazim** or **Thiram**).

4.  **Physiological Factors:**
    *   **Corm Quality:** Plant only healthy, vigorous corms of appropriate size.
    *   **Planting Practices:** Ensure correct planting depth and spacing for optimal growth and air circulation.

By addressing these underlying factors through good agricultural practices and timely pest/disease management, you can ensure healthy Gladiolus plants that produce high-quality, long-lasting flowers, minimizing any issues related to premature senescence or "dropping."
