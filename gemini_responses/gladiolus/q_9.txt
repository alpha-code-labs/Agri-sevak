Mites, including Red Spider Mite (Tetranychus urticae) and Rust Mite (e.g., Aceria gladioli), are significant pests of Gladiolus in Haryana, causing considerable damage if not managed effectively. As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, I recommend an integrated approach for their control.

**Symptoms of Mite Infestation:**
*   **Red Spider Mite:** Fine webbing on the underside of leaves, yellowing or bronzing of leaves, stippling (tiny white or yellow spots), and overall stunted growth.
*   **Rust Mite:** Bronzing or russeting of leaves, especially along the veins, distortion of leaves, and reduced flower quality. These mites are microscopic and difficult to see without magnification.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategy for Mites in Gladiolus:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Water Management:** Mites thrive in hot, dry conditions. Regular overhead irrigation or syringing (spraying water forcefully on the foliage, especially the undersides) can help dislodge mites and increase humidity, making the environment less favorable for them. Do this in the morning to allow foliage to dry, preventing fungal issues.
    *   **Weed Control:** Many weeds act as alternate hosts for mites. Keep the gladiolus beds free of weeds.
    *   **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to improve air circulation, which can reduce mite populations and make chemical sprays more effective.
    *   **Removal of Infested Parts:** Promptly remove and destroy heavily infested leaves or plants to reduce the source of infestation.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** While gladiolus is a perennial corm, rotating the planting area or ensuring a good fallow period can help reduce pest pressure.

2.  **Chemical Control (Acaricides):**
    When mite populations are high and cultural methods are insufficient, chemical control becomes necessary. Always rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of the leaves where mites primarily reside.

    *   **For Red Spider Mite and Rust Mite:**
        *   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** Apply at a rate of **0.5 - 0.75 ml per litre** of water. This is effective against all life stages of mites.
        *   **Fenpyroximate 5% EC:** Apply at a rate of **0.5 ml per litre** of water. It provides quick knockdown and residual activity.
        *   **Propargite 57% EC:** Apply at a rate of **1.5 - 2.0 ml per litre** of water. This is a broad-spectrum acaricide effective against various mite species.
        *   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP:** Apply at a rate of **2 - 3 grams per litre** of water. Sulphur is effective against rust mites and also has some efficacy against spider mites, especially in cooler weather or as a preventive. Avoid spraying sulphur when temperatures are very high (above 30°C) as it can cause phytotoxicity.

    **Application Guidelines:**
    *   Always read the label instructions carefully before use.
    *   Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, mask, and protective clothing.
    *   Spray early in the morning or late in the evening to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
    *   Ensure complete coverage of the plant, especially the undersides of the leaves.
    *   Repeat application after 7-10 days if the infestation persists, using a different group of acaricide to prevent resistance.
    *   Do not exceed the recommended dosage.

By combining these cultural and chemical strategies, you can effectively manage mite populations in your Gladiolus crop.
