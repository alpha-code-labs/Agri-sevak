As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified seed (corm) and soil treatment processes for Gladiolus cultivation in Haryana to ensure healthy plant establishment and mitigate common pest and disease issues.

### Recommended Seed (Corm) Treatment for Gladiolus

The primary goal of corm treatment is to protect against seed-borne fungal diseases like Fusarium wilt, Stromatinia dry rot, and Penicillium rot, which can cause significant losses.

1.  **Fungicidal Treatment:**
    *   Before planting, sort and select healthy, disease-free corms. Discard any corms showing signs of rot, lesions, or discoloration.
    *   Dip the corms for 30 minutes in a solution of:
        *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 1.5 grams per litre of water.
        *   **OR**
        *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP at 2.5 grams per litre of water.
        *   **OR**
        *   A combination of **Carbendazim** 12% + **Mancozeb** 63% WP at 2 grams per litre of water.
    *   Allow the corms to air dry in the shade before planting.

2.  **Insecticidal Treatment (Optional, if early sucking pest pressure is anticipated):**
    *   If there is a history of early thrips infestation or other sucking pests, you may combine an insecticide with the fungicidal dip.
    *   Dip the corms for 30 minutes in a solution of:
        *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL at 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   Ensure corms are thoroughly dried before planting.

### Recommended Soil Treatment for Gladiolus

Soil treatment aims to manage soil-borne diseases, nematodes, and insect pests that can damage roots and corms, affecting plant growth and yield.

1.  **Biological Soil Treatment (Highly Recommended):**
    *   **For Fungal Diseases (e.g., Fusarium wilt, Sclerotium rot):**
        *   Mix **Trichoderma viride** (or **Trichoderma harzianum**) at 2.5 to 5 kg per acre with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost.
        *   Moisten the mixture and keep it covered for 7-10 days in a shaded area to allow the fungus to multiply.
        *   Broadcast this enriched FYM uniformly over the field and incorporate it into the soil 15-20 days before planting.
    *   **For Nematodes (e.g., Root-knot nematodes):**
        *   Mix **Purpureocillium lilacinum** (formerly *Paecilomyces lilacinus*) at 2.5 to 5 kg per acre with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed FYM or compost.
        *   Follow the same procedure as for Trichoderma, applying it 15-20 days before planting.

2.  **Chemical Soil Treatment (If biological control alone is insufficient or pest pressure is high):**
    *   **For Soil-borne Fungal Diseases:**
        *   If Fusarium wilt is a persistent problem, drench the soil around the planting area with **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 1.5 grams per litre of water, using approximately 2-3 litres of solution per square meter, immediately after planting or at the first sign of disease.
    *   **For Soil Insect Pests (e.g., Wireworms, Cutworms):**
        *   Apply **Fipronil** 0.3% GR at 10-15 kg per acre, or **Fipronil** 0.6% GR at 5-10 kg per acre, by broadcasting and incorporating it into the soil during final land preparation, just before planting.
    *   **For Nematodes:**
        *   In fields with a known history of severe nematode infestation, apply **Fluensulfone** 2% GR at 10-15 kg per acre, by broadcasting and incorporating it into the soil during final land preparation.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice regular crop rotation with non-host crops to break the disease and pest cycles.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy all plant debris after harvest to reduce inoculum for future crops.
*   **Healthy Planting Material:** Always start with certified, disease-free corms.
*   **Soil Testing:** Conduct regular soil tests to determine nutrient status and pH, which can influence plant health and disease susceptibility.

By implementing these scientifically sound seed and soil treatment protocols, Gladiolus growers in Haryana can significantly improve crop health, yield, and quality.
