Drying up (drying branches, leaves, fruits, and flowers) in Gladiolus is a general symptom that can be indicative of various underlying issues, both abiotic (environmental) and biotic (diseases and pests). A precise diagnosis is crucial for effective management. As a Senior Agronomist, I recommend the following approach:

**I. Initial Assessment and Diagnosis:**

Before applying any treatment, carefully observe the affected plants for additional symptoms:
*   **Pattern of drying:** Is it starting from the bottom leaves, specific branches, or randomly?
*   **Color changes:** Yellowing, browning, purpling before drying?
*   **Presence of spots/lesions:** On leaves, stems, or flowers?
*   **Root/Corm examination:** Are the roots healthy? Is the corm firm or soft/rotted? Look for discolouration or lesions.
*   **Presence of pests:** Inspect leaves, stems, and flowers for insects.

**II. Potential Causes and Management Strategies:**

**A. Abiotic Factors (Environmental/Physiological Stress):**

1.  **Water Stress (Deficiency or Excess):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Wilting, yellowing, and eventual drying of leaves. Excess water can lead to root rot, mimicking drought symptoms as roots cannot absorb water.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Ensure consistent and adequate irrigation, especially during dry periods. Gladiolus requires about 2.5-3.5 cm of water per week.
        *   Check soil moisture before watering. Avoid waterlogging by ensuring good drainage.
        *   Mulching can help retain soil moisture and regulate soil temperature.

2.  **Nutrient Imbalance/Deficiency:**
    *   **Symptoms:** General stunting, yellowing, marginal necrosis, and premature drying. Potassium deficiency, for instance, can cause marginal scorching and drying.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Conduct a soil test to determine nutrient levels.
        *   Apply balanced fertilizers based on soil test recommendations. A general recommendation for Gladiolus is 100-120 kg Nitrogen, 60-80 kg Phosphorus, and 80-100 kg Potassium per acre.
        *   Foliar application of micronutrients if specific deficiencies are identified.

3.  **Heat Stress:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Scorching of leaves and flowers, wilting, and drying, especially during peak summer temperatures.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Provide partial shade during extreme heat if possible.
        *   Ensure adequate watering to help plants cope with heat.
        *   Mulching helps keep soil temperatures stable.

**B. Biotic Factors (Diseases and Pests):**

**1. Fungal Diseases:**

*   **Fusarium Wilt/Corm Rot (*Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. gladioli*):** This is one of the most common and destructive diseases of Gladiolus.
    *   **Symptoms:** Yellowing and wilting of leaves, often starting from the lower leaves and progressing upwards. The plant eventually dries up. Vascular tissues in the stem and corm show brown discoloration. Corms may have dry, sunken lesions or rot.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural:** Use disease-free corms. Practice crop rotation (avoid planting Gladiolus in the same spot for at least 3-4 years). Remove and destroy infected plants and corms. Solarize soil before planting.
        *   **Chemical (Corm Treatment):** Dip corms in a solution of **Carbendazim** (50% WP) at 2 g/L of water for 30 minutes before planting.
        *   **Chemical (Soil Drench/Foliar):** In severe cases, drench the soil around affected plants with **Carbendazim** (50% WP) at 1-2 g/L of water, or spray foliage with **Propiconazole** (25% EC) at 1 ml/L of water.

*   **Botrytis Blight (*Botrytis gladiolorum*):** Primarily affects flowers and leaves, leading to browning and drying.
    *   **Symptoms:** Water-soaked spots on leaves and flowers that turn brown and necrotic. Flowers may fail to open or develop brown, papery petals. A grey, fuzzy mold may be visible under humid conditions.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural:** Ensure good air circulation. Remove and destroy infected plant parts. Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day.
        *   **Chemical:** Spray with a combination of **Carbendazim** (50% WP) at 1 g/L + **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2 g/L of water, or **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC) at 0.5 ml/L of water, at 7-10 day intervals during humid conditions.

*   **Stromatinia Dry Rot (*Stromatinia gladioli*):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Yellowing and wilting of leaves, followed by drying. Dark, sunken lesions on the corms, often with small, black sclerotia.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural:** Use healthy corms. Practice long crop rotations.
        *   **Chemical (Corm Treatment):** Similar to Fusarium, corm treatment with **Carbendazim** (50% WP) at 2 g/L of water can be effective.

**2. Bacterial Diseases:**

*   **Bacterial Scab/Rot (*Pseudomonas gladioli*):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Water-soaked spots on leaves that turn brown. On corms, sunken, dark lesions with a shiny, varnish-like appearance. Can lead to wilting and drying of the plant.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural:** Use disease-free corms. Avoid planting in poorly drained soils. Practice good sanitation.
        *   **Chemical:** Copper-based fungicides like **Copper Oxychloride** (50% WP) at 2.5 g/L of water can offer some protection as a foliar spray, but cultural practices are key.

**3. Insect Pests:**

*   **Gladiolus Thrips (*Taeniothrips simplex*):** A major pest that causes significant damage, leading to drying.
    *   **Symptoms:** Silvery streaks on leaves, browning and distortion of flower buds and petals. Flowers may fail to open or appear scorched and dry. Leaves become papery and dry.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural:** Remove and destroy plant debris. Destroy severely infested plants. Store corms at low temperatures (4-7°C) to suppress thrips.
        *   **Chemical:** Spray with **Imidacloprid** (17.8% SL) at 0.5 ml/L of water or **Fipronil** (5% SC) at 1.5-2 ml/L of water, repeating every 7-10 days if infestation persists. Ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and within flower buds.

*   **Nematodes (e.g., Root-knot nematodes - *Meloidogyne* spp.):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, yellowing, wilting, and drying of plants due to damaged roots that cannot absorb water and nutrients efficiently. Galls (swellings) on roots are characteristic.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural:** Practice crop rotation with non-host plants. Solarize soil before planting. Use healthy, nematode-free corms.
        *   **Chemical:** For severe infestations, consult with HAU experts for specific nematicide recommendations approved for Gladiolus in Haryana, as options can be highly regulated.

**III. General Preventive Measures:**

*   **Use Certified Disease-Free Corms:** Always start with healthy planting material.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting Gladiolus in the same field year after year.
*   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy all plant debris, especially infected material, after harvest.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing for good air circulation.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced fertilizers based on soil tests.
*   **Good Drainage:** Ensure well-drained soil to prevent waterlogging and root rot.
*   **Regular Scouting:** Regularly inspect plants for early signs of pests or diseases.

By carefully observing the specific symptoms and implementing the appropriate management strategies, you can effectively address the "drying up" issue in your Gladiolus crop. For precise diagnosis, especially for complex issues, it is always advisable to bring a sample to the plant pathology or entomology department at HAU, Hisar.
