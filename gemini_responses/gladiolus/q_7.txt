As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I must provide scientifically verified advice. Based on current plant pathology knowledge for Gladiolus, the conditions you have mentioned are not typically associated with this crop:

*   **Dieback:** This is not known to affect Gladiolus as a specific disease name. While Gladiolus plants can exhibit symptoms of wilting and eventual death of foliage (which might be colloquially referred to as dieback) due to various diseases like Fusarium wilt, Botrytis blight, or Stromatinia neck rot, "Dieback" itself is not a recognized disease of Gladiolus.
*   **Twig blight:** This is not known to affect Gladiolus. "Twig blight" is a term typically used for diseases affecting woody plants (trees and shrubs) that possess twigs. Gladiolus is a herbaceous plant and does not have twigs.
*   **Tikka disease:** This is not known to affect Gladiolus. Tikka disease is a well-known leaf spot disease primarily affecting groundnut (peanut) caused by *Cercospora arachidicola* and *Phaeoisariopsis personata*. Gladiolus can suffer from various leaf spot diseases, but they are not referred to as "Tikka disease."
