Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing rot diseases in Gladiolus.

Rot diseases in Gladiolus, including Root, Stem, Foot, Collar, Crown, Neck, and Black rot, are primarily caused by a complex of soil-borne fungal pathogens such as *Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. gladioli*, *Sclerotium rolfsii*, *Pythium* spp., and *Rhizoctonia solani*. These often lead to corm rot, basal rot, wilting, and eventual plant death.

Regarding the other rot types you mentioned:
*   **Fruit rot:** This is not known to affect Gladiolus. Gladiolus produces capsules, not fruits in the horticultural sense typically associated with fruit rot diseases.
*   **Seed rot:** This is not known to affect Gladiolus as commercial propagation is primarily through corms, not seeds.
*   **Seedling rot:** This is not known to affect Gladiolus as commercial cultivation does not typically involve seedlings; plants are grown from corms or cormels.

Here's a comprehensive strategy to control the relevant rot types in Gladiolus:

**I. Integrated Disease Management (IDM) Approach:**

A successful strategy combines cultural practices, biological control, and judicious chemical application.

**II. Cultural and Agronomic Practices (Most Crucial):**

1.  **Corm Selection:**
    *   Always use healthy, disease-free corms from a reputable source.
    *   Visually inspect corms before planting; discard any showing discoloration, lesions, or softness.
2.  **Soil Management:**
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Practice a 3-4 year crop rotation with non-host crops (e.g., cereals, legumes) to reduce pathogen build-up in the soil. Avoid planting Gladiolus in the same field year after year.
    *   **Soil Solarization:** In summer, cover moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks. This raises soil temperature, effectively killing many soil-borne pathogens.
    *   **Drainage:** Ensure excellent soil drainage. Waterlogging creates anaerobic conditions favorable for many rot pathogens, especially *Pythium*. Amend heavy soils with organic matter and sand if necessary.
    *   **Soil pH:** Maintain an optimal soil pH of 6.0-6.5.
3.  **Field Sanitation:**
    *   Remove and destroy all infected plant debris, corms, and leaves from the field immediately. Do not compost diseased material.
    *   Clean and sanitize all tools and equipment used in the field.
4.  **Planting Practices:**
    *   **Optimal Planting Depth:** Plant corms at the recommended depth (usually 10-15 cm) to ensure proper development and reduce stress.
    *   **Spacing:** Maintain adequate plant spacing to ensure good air circulation and reduce humidity around the plant base.
    *   **Avoid Injury:** Be careful during planting, weeding, and harvesting to avoid injuring corms or roots, as wounds provide entry points for pathogens.
5.  **Water Management:**
    *   Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day, which can keep foliage and soil surface wet for prolonged periods.
    *   Use drip irrigation if possible, or irrigate at the base of the plants in the morning.
    *   Avoid overwatering.

**III. Biological Control:**

1.  **Bio-fungicide Application:**
    *   **Corm Treatment:** Dip corms in a suspension of *Trichoderma viride* or *Trichoderma harzianum* (4-5 g/kg corms) for 30 minutes before planting.
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply *Trichoderma viride* or *Trichoderma harzianum* (2.5 kg/acre mixed with 50 kg farmyard manure) to the soil before planting or as a drench after planting. These beneficial fungi act as antagonists to many soil-borne pathogens.

**IV. Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved):**

Chemical control should be used as a supplementary measure to cultural practices.

1.  **Pre-Planting Corm Treatment:**
    *   Dip corms for 30 minutes in a solution of:
        *   **Carbendazim** (50% WP) at 2 g/L of water.
        *   OR **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2.5 g/L of water.
        *   OR a combination of **Carbendazim** (1 g/L) + **Mancozeb** (2 g/L) for broader spectrum protection.
        *   OR **Thiram** (75% WS) at 2-3 g/kg corms as a dry treatment or slurry.
        *   OR **Captan** (50% WP) at 2-3 g/L of water.
    *   Allow corms to air dry in shade before planting.

2.  **Soil Drench (If disease symptoms appear in the field):**
    *   If rot symptoms are observed, drench the soil around the affected plants with:
        *   **Carbendazim** (50% WP) at 1-2 g/L of water.
        *   OR **Propiconazole** (25% EC) at 1 ml/L of water.
        *   OR a combination product containing **Metalaxyl** (8% WG) + **Mancozeb** (64% WG) at 2.5 g/L of water, especially if *Pythium* is suspected.
        *   OR **Tebuconazole** (25.9% EC) at 1 ml/L of water.
    *   Ensure sufficient solution reaches the root zone. Repeat if necessary, following label instructions for interval and number of applications.

**V. Post-Harvest Management:**

1.  **Curing:** After harvesting, cure corms in a well-ventilated, warm (25-30°C) place for 7-10 days to heal any wounds and reduce susceptibility to storage rots.
2.  **Storage:** Store corms in a cool, dry, well-ventilated area (e.g., 4-7°C with 70-80% relative humidity) to prevent pathogen development.

By implementing these integrated strategies, you can effectively manage and control rot diseases in your Gladiolus crop. Always read and follow the instructions on the fungicide labels for safe and effective use.
