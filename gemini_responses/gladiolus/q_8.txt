Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding sucking pests in Gladiolus. These pests can significantly reduce the yield and quality of your flower crop.

First, regarding **Psylla**: This is not known to affect Gladiolus. Psyllids are generally host-specific, and Gladiolus is not a known host plant for these pests.

Now, let's address the control of Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips in Gladiolus:

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Approach:**

A combination of cultural, mechanical, and chemical methods is most effective for sustainable pest management.

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Practices:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy crop residues and weeds, which can harbor pests.
*   **Water Management:** Ensure proper irrigation, as water stress can make plants more susceptible.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush, soft growth attractive to sucking pests.
*   **Yellow Sticky Traps:** Install yellow sticky traps (10-15 traps per acre) to monitor and trap adult whiteflies, leafhoppers, and thrips.
*   **Reflective Mulches:** Use silver-colored reflective mulches, especially in early stages, to deter thrips and whiteflies.

**2. Chemical Control (Use only CIBRC approved chemicals and follow label instructions carefully):**

For effective control, it is crucial to rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Always ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where many of these pests reside.

Here are some recommended technical chemicals and their approximate dosages:

*   **For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips (Broad Spectrum):**
    *   **Imidacloprid** (17.8% SL formulation): 0.5 - 1.0 ml per liter of water.
    *   **Thiamethoxam** (25% WG formulation): 0.2 - 0.4 g per liter of water.
    *   **Acetamiprid** (20% SP formulation): 0.2 - 0.4 g per liter of water.
    *   **Cyantraniliprole** (10.26% OD formulation): 0.9 - 1.2 ml per liter of water.

*   **Specifically for Thrips:**
    *   **Fipronil** (5% SC formulation): 1.5 - 2.0 ml per liter of water.
    *   **Spinosad** (45% SC formulation): 0.25 - 0.3 ml per liter of water.

*   **Specifically for Whiteflies (especially nymphs) and Mites:**
    *   **Buprofezin** (25% SC formulation): 1.25 - 1.5 ml per liter of water (effective on nymphs, less on adults).
    *   **Spiromesifen** (22.9% SC formulation): 0.5 - 0.75 ml per liter of water (effective on all stages of whiteflies and mites).

*   **Specifically for Aphids and Whiteflies:**
    *   **Flonicamid** (50% WG formulation): 0.3 g per liter of water.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Timing of Application:** Apply insecticides when pest populations are low to moderate, before they cause significant damage. Early morning or late evening sprays are ideal.
*   **Water Quality:** Use clean water for spraying.
*   **Safety:** Always wear protective clothing (gloves, mask, goggles) while handling and spraying chemicals. Do not eat, drink, or smoke during application. Wash hands thoroughly after spraying.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Observe the recommended pre-harvest interval for each chemical to ensure the safety of the flowers for market.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent pests from developing resistance. Avoid repeated use of the same chemical group.
