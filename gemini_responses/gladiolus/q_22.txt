As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified cultivation practices for Gladiolus in Haryana:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern (Corm Planting Method):**
    *   Gladiolus is propagated through corms, not seeds.
    *   The most recommended method for commercial cultivation in Haryana is planting corms on **ridges and furrows**. This method ensures proper drainage, facilitates irrigation, and makes inter-cultural operations like weeding and earthing up easier.
    *   Corms are planted in straight rows along the ridges.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   The ideal planting depth depends on the size of the corm and the soil type.
    *   For medium to large corms (diameter > 3 cm), a depth of **7-10 cm** is recommended.
    *   For smaller corms or cormels, a depth of **5-7 cm** is generally sufficient.
    *   In lighter, sandy soils, corms can be planted slightly deeper, while in heavier clay soils, a shallower depth is advisable to prevent rotting.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   Optimal spacing is crucial for good air circulation, light penetration, and the development of quality flower spikes and healthy corms.
    *   **Row-to-row spacing:** **30-45 cm** (depending on the variety and the type of inter-cultivation machinery used).
    *   **Plant-to-plant (corm-to-corm) spacing within the row:** **15-20 cm** for commercial flower production using medium to large corms.
    *   For smaller corms or for the purpose of cormel multiplication, a closer spacing of 10-15 cm within the row can be adopted.

*   **Corm Dose (Seed Dose):**
    *   The "seed dose" refers to the number of corms required per unit area, which is directly determined by the chosen spacing.
    *   For commercial flower production, using medium to large corms (3-5 cm diameter) with a spacing of 30 cm (row-to-row) x 15 cm (plant-to-plant):
        *   You would require approximately **80,000 - 90,000 corms per acre**.
    *   If using smaller corms or planting at a higher density for cormel production, the requirement will be higher.
