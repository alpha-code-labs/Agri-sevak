As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified recommendations for the use of growth regulators and micronutrients in Gladiolus cultivation in Haryana:

### Recommended Doses for Growth Regulators/Hormones and Boron in Gladiolus

1.  **Ethephon (Ethrel)**
    *   **Purpose:** **Ethephon** is primarily used in Gladiolus for breaking corm dormancy and promoting early sprouting and flowering.
    *   **Recommended Dose:**
        *   **For Breaking Corm Dormancy:** Dip corms in a solution of **Ethephon** at 250-500 ppm (0.25-0.5 g/L of active ingredient) for 24 hours before planting. Ensure proper ventilation and drying of corms after treatment.

2.  **2,4-D**
    *   While **2,4-D** is an auxin, its use as a growth regulator in Gladiolus is not a standard or recommended practice for general cultivation in Haryana. Its primary agricultural application is as a selective herbicide, and the margin between a growth-regulating dose and a phytotoxic (damaging) dose in Gladiolus is extremely narrow. Therefore, specific recommendations for its use as a growth regulator in Gladiolus are not provided by HAU for general farmer practice.

3.  **Boron**
    *   **Purpose:** Boron is an essential micronutrient vital for cell wall formation, sugar transport, pollen germination, and overall plant development in Gladiolus. Boron deficiency can lead to poor flower development and reduced yield.
    *   **Recommended Form:** **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate) or Boric acid.
    *   **Recommended Dose:**
        *   **Foliar Spray:** Apply a foliar spray of **Borax** at 0.1-0.2% concentration (1-2 g/L of water) at the 4-6 leaf stage and again before flowering. Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.
        *   **Soil Application (if deficiency is severe or soil is known to be deficient):** Apply **Borax** at 10-15 kg/acre as a basal application before planting, mixed thoroughly with the soil. This should be done based on soil test recommendations.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always use the recommended doses precisely. Overdosing with growth regulators or micronutrients can be detrimental to plant health.
*   Ensure good quality water for preparing spray solutions.
*   For any specific concerns or severe deficiency symptoms, it is advisable to conduct a soil test and consult with HAU experts for tailored recommendations.
