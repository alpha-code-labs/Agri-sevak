As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified practices for the ideal transplantation of Snake Gourd in Haryana:

### Ideal Transplantation Time

*   **For early summer crop:** February to March, ensuring the danger of frost has completely passed.
*   **For main rainy season (Kharif) crop:** June to July, coinciding with the onset of monsoon.

### Ideal Transplantation Distance

*   **Row-to-Row:** 2.0 to 3.0 meters.
*   **Plant-to-Plant:** 0.6 to 1.0 meter.
    *   *Note: Wider spacing within these ranges is beneficial for better air circulation, light penetration, and fruit development, especially when a trellising system is used.*

### Transplantation Process

*   **Nursery Raising:** Sow seeds in nursery beds or pro-trays approximately 3-4 weeks prior to the intended transplanting date. This allows for the development of strong, healthy seedlings.
*   **Seedling Age:** Transplant seedlings when they are 3-4 weeks old and have developed 2-4 true leaves. At this stage, they are robust enough to withstand transplant shock.
*   **Hardening Off:** Gradually expose the seedlings to outdoor conditions for about 7-10 days before transplanting. This process, known as hardening off, helps them adapt to the field environment and significantly reduces transplant shock.
*   **Field Preparation:** Prepare the main field by thorough ploughing and harrowing. Incorporate well-rotted farmyard manure (FYM) or compost at a rate of 20-25 tonnes/acre to enrich the soil. Create raised beds or pits at the recommended spacing.
*   **Transplanting:**
    *   Water the nursery beds thoroughly a few hours before transplanting to ensure the root ball remains intact and moist.
    *   Transplant seedlings preferably in the late afternoon or evening to avoid the harsh midday sun and reduce stress.
    *   Carefully lift each seedling with its root ball intact to minimize root damage.
    *   Plant the seedlings at the same depth as they were in the nursery.
    *   Gently firm the soil around the base of each seedling to ensure good root-to-soil contact.
    *   Immediately provide light irrigation after transplanting to help settle the soil and aid in establishment.
*   **Support System:** Install trellises, stakes, or other appropriate support systems shortly after transplanting. Snake Gourd is a climbing vine and requires support for optimal growth, better air circulation, and to prevent fruit spoilage from contact with the ground.
