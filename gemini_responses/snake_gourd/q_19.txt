Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice to address macro-nutrient deficiencies in Snake Gourd (Trichosanthes cucumerina) in Haryana.

It is crucial to conduct a soil test to accurately determine the extent of nutrient deficiencies and tailor the fertilizer application accordingly. However, based on visual symptoms, here's how to address Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium deficiencies:

### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   General yellowing (chlorosis) of older leaves, starting from the tips and margins.
*   Stunted plant growth with thin, weak stems.
*   Reduced fruit set and smaller fruit size.

**Correction Measures:**
*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Urea** (46% N) at 20-30 kg per acre. This can be split into 2-3 applications during the vegetative growth phase.
*   **Foliar Application (for quick correction):**
    *   Spray a 1-1.5% solution of **Urea** (10-15 g per litre of water). Apply during the cooler parts of the day, preferably in the morning or late afternoon. Repeat after 7-10 days if symptoms persist.

### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   Dark green or purplish discoloration of older leaves, especially on the undersides.
*   Stunted growth, poor root development, and delayed flowering and fruiting.
*   Leaves may appear stiff and upright.

**Correction Measures:**
*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5) at 25-40 kg per acre as a basal dose or early in the growth cycle.
    *   Alternatively, **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5) can be applied at 75-120 kg per acre.
*   **Foliar Application (for quick correction):**
    *   Spray a 0.5-1% solution of **Monoammonium Phosphate (MAP)** (5-10 g per litre of water). Ensure complete dissolution before spraying.

### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   Yellowing and browning (scorching) of leaf margins, particularly on older leaves.
*   Weak stems, poor fruit development, and reduced fruit quality.
*   Increased susceptibility to diseases and environmental stresses.

**Correction Measures:**
*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** (60% K2O) at 20-30 kg per acre. This can be applied as a basal dose or split during the growth and fruiting stages.
    *   Alternatively, **Sulphate of Potash (SOP)** (50% K2O, 18% S) can be used, especially if sulfur is also deficient.
*   **Foliar Application (for quick correction):**
    *   Spray a 0.5-1% solution of **Sulphate of Potash (SOP)** (5-10 g per litre of water) or **Potassium Nitrate** (5-10 g per litre of water).

**General Recommendations:**
*   Always ensure uniform application of fertilizers.
*   For foliar sprays, use clean water and ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.
*   Avoid spraying during hot midday sun to prevent leaf scorching.
*   Monitor plant response and repeat applications if necessary, but always prioritize soil testing for long-term nutrient management.
*   Maintain good soil organic matter content through farmyard manure (FYM) or compost application, as it improves nutrient retention and availability.
