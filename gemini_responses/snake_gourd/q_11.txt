Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing pests in Snake Gourd in Haryana.

**Control of Beetles in Snake Gourd:**

Beetles, particularly the Red Pumpkin Beetle (Aulacophora foveicollis), are a common and significant pest of cucurbits, including Snake Gourd, especially during the seedling stage. They feed on leaves, flowers, and fruits, causing considerable damage.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Beetles:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Early Sowing:** Sow seeds early in the season to allow plants to establish before the peak beetle population emerges.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Keep the field free of weeds and crop residues, which can harbor pests.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate Snake Gourd with non-cucurbit crops to break the pest cycle.

2.  **Mechanical Control:**
    *   **Hand Picking:** In small plots, adult beetles can be hand-picked, especially in the early morning, and destroyed.
    *   **Physical Barriers:** Cover young seedlings with fine nets or cloth to protect them from initial beetle attack.

3.  **Chemical Control (Use only when necessary, following safety precautions and recommended dosages):**
    *   For effective control, especially during the vulnerable seedling stage, consider the following CIBRC approved insecticides:
        *   **Malathion 50% EC:** Apply at a rate of 2.0-3.0 ml per liter of water, or 1.0-1.5 liters per acre mixed in 200-400 liters of water.
        *   **Carbaryl 50% WP:** Apply at a rate of 2.5-3.0 grams per liter of water, or 1.0-1.5 kg per acre mixed in 200-400 liters of water.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** Apply at a rate of 0.25-0.5 ml per liter of water, or 100-150 ml per acre mixed in 200-400 liters of water.

    *   **Application Timing:** Apply insecticides preferably in the evening to minimize harm to beneficial insects. Ensure thorough coverage of the plant foliage. Always observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) mentioned on the product label.

**Control of Weevils in Snake Gourd:**

This is not known to affect Snake Gourd as a primary or significant pest in Haryana. While some generalist weevils might occasionally be observed, they are not typically a major concern requiring specific control measures for this crop.

**Control of Sawflies in Snake Gourd:**

This is not known to affect Snake Gourd as a primary or significant pest in Haryana. Sawflies are generally not considered major pests of cucurbit crops like Snake Gourd in our region.
