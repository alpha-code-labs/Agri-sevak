As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I advise on addressing micronutrient deficiencies in Snake Gourd (Trichosanthes cucumerina) based on scientific principles and practices suitable for Haryana's agro-climatic conditions.

**General Recommendations for Micronutrient Management:**

1.  **Soil Testing:** The most crucial first step is to conduct a comprehensive soil test. This will accurately identify which specific micronutrients are deficient in your field and to what extent, allowing for targeted and efficient application.
2.  **Integrated Nutrient Management:** Combine soil application for long-term correction with foliar sprays for quick relief and immediate symptom correction.
3.  **Timing of Application:** Foliar sprays are best applied during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late afternoon) to maximize absorption and prevent leaf scorching.
4.  **Water Quality:** Use clean water for spraying.
5.  **Soil pH Management:** Maintain optimal soil pH (typically 6.0-7.0 for Snake Gourd) as it significantly influences the availability of micronutrients.
6.  **Organic Matter:** Incorporate organic matter (farmyard manure, compost) into the soil, as it improves soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability.

Here's how to address specific micronutrient deficiencies in Snake Gourd:

### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Stunted growth, small leaves (often called 'little leaf'), interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, and sometimes bronzing of older leaves.

**Correction:**
*   **Foliar Application:**
    *   Spray 0.5% solution of **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (5 g/L of water).
    *   Alternatively, spray 0.1% solution of **Zinc EDTA** (1 g/L of water).
    *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, starting when deficiency symptoms appear or at the vegetative growth stage.
*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply 10-25 kg/acre of **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** at the time of land preparation or sowing, based on soil test recommendations.

### 2. Iron (Fe) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Pronounced interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on young leaves, with veins remaining green. In severe cases, entire leaves may turn pale yellow or white.

**Correction:**
*   **Foliar Application:**
    *   Spray 0.5% solution of **Ferrous sulphate heptahydrate** (5 g/L of water).
    *   Alternatively, spray 0.1% solution of **Ferrous EDTA** (1 g/L of water).
    *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 7-10 day intervals, especially during active growth.
*   **Soil Application:**
    *   In alkaline soils, **Ferrous EDTA** (5-10 kg/acre) is more effective than **Ferrous sulphate heptahydrate** (20-40 kg/acre) due to better availability. Apply at sowing or as a side dressing.

### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Stunted growth, death of growing points, cracking of stems and fruits, hollow stems, poor fruit set, and deformed or corky fruits.

**Correction:**
*   **Foliar Application:**
    *   Spray 0.1-0.2% solution of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (1-2 g/L of water) or **Boric acid** (1-2 g/L of water).
    *   Apply at pre-flowering and fruit development stages.
*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply 1-2 kg/acre of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** or 2-4 kg/acre of **Borax** at the time of land preparation.
    *   **Caution:** Boron can be toxic if over-applied. Always adhere strictly to recommended doses and soil test results.

### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Blossom end rot in fruits (a common issue in cucurbits like Snake Gourd), stunted growth, distorted new leaves, marginal necrosis (browning) of young leaves, and weak stems.

**Correction:**
*   **Foliar Application:**
    *   Spray 0.5-1.0% solution of **Calcium nitrate** (5-10 g/L of water) or **Calcium chloride** (5-10 g/L of water).
    *   Start spraying from fruit set and repeat at 10-15 day intervals, especially during periods of rapid fruit development.
*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Gypsum** (Calcium sulphate) at 200-400 kg/acre during land preparation, especially in soils with low calcium or high sodium.
    *   **Calcium nitrate** can also be applied as a side dressing.

### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, with veins remaining green. Leaves may become brittle and curl upwards.

**Correction:**
*   **Foliar Application:**
    *   Spray 0.5-1.0% solution of **Magnesium sulphate heptahydrate** (5-10 g/L of water).
    *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, starting when symptoms appear.
*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply 10-20 kg/acre of **Magnesium sulphate heptahydrate** at the time of land preparation or as a side dressing.

### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, often accompanied by small necrotic (dead) spots. Symptoms can resemble iron deficiency but typically appear on younger leaves first.

**Correction:**
*   **Foliar Application:**
    *   Spray 0.2-0.5% solution of **Manganese sulphate monohydrate** (2-5 g/L of water).
    *   Alternatively, spray 0.1% solution of **Manganese EDTA** (1 g/L of water).
    *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, starting when deficiency symptoms are observed.
*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply 5-10 kg/acre of **Manganese sulphate monohydrate** at the time of land preparation, especially in soils with high pH.
