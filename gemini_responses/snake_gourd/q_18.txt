As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified recommendations for the use of growth regulators and Boron in Snake Gourd cultivation in Haryana:

It is crucial to use these chemicals precisely as recommended, as incorrect dosages can lead to adverse effects on the crop. Always ensure thorough coverage of the foliage during spraying.

*   **Ethephon**
    *   **Purpose:** To induce female flower production, promote early fruiting, and increase overall yield in Snake Gourd.
    *   **Recommended Dose:** Apply **Ethephon** (39% SL formulation) at a concentration of **0.4 - 0.6 ml per litre of water** (equivalent to 150-250 ppm).
    *   **Timing:** The first spray should be given at the 2-4 true leaf stage of the plant. A second spray can be applied 7-10 days after the first, if necessary, depending on the plant's response and flowering pattern.

*   **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid**
    *   **Purpose:** While **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid** is a plant growth regulator, its primary and most common use is as a herbicide. Its application as a growth regulator for fruit setting or development in Snake Gourd is not commonly recommended by agricultural universities, including HAU.
    *   **Recommendation:** The margin between an effective growth-regulating dose and a phytotoxic (crop-damaging) dose of **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid** in cucurbits is extremely narrow. Therefore, its use for this purpose is generally discouraged due to the high risk of severe crop damage.

*   **Boron**
    *   **Purpose:** Boron is an essential micronutrient vital for pollen germination, fruit set, cell wall formation, and sugar transport in plants. Its deficiency can lead to poor fruit set, malformed fruits, and reduced yield in Snake Gourd.
    *   **Recommended Dose:** Apply **Boron** as a foliar spray using a soluble source like **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (e.g., Solubor, typically containing 20% Boron) at a concentration of **1-2 g per litre of water** (0.1-0.2% solution).
    *   **Timing:** The first spray should be applied at the pre-flowering stage. A second spray can be given at the early fruit set stage to ensure adequate Boron availability during critical reproductive phases.
