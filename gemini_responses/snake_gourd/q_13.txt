As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fruit fly and addressing Ber fly in Snake Gourd in Haryana:

### Control of Fruit Fly in Snake Gourd

Fruit flies, primarily *Bactrocera cucurbitae*, are a major pest of cucurbit crops, including Snake Gourd, causing significant damage by laying eggs in young fruits, leading to rotting and premature fruit drop. An integrated pest management (IPM) approach is crucial for effective control.

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Regularly collect and destroy all fallen, damaged, or infested fruits by burying them deep in the soil or burning them. This breaks the life cycle of the pest.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** After harvest, deep ploughing exposes pupae in the soil to predators and harsh weather conditions, reducing the next generation's population.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting cucurbit crops in the same field consecutively.
*   **Early Harvesting:** Harvest fruits at the tender stage to minimize the chances of infestation.

**2. Mechanical Methods:**
*   **Fruit Bagging:** For small-scale cultivation, individual fruits can be covered with paper or cloth bags once they start developing to prevent egg-laying by flies.
*   **Pheromone Traps:** Install specific fruit fly pheromone traps (e.g., Methyl Eugenol traps for male flies) at a density of 4-5 traps per acre. These traps attract and kill male flies, disrupting mating. Replace lures every 2-3 weeks.

**3. Biological Control:**
*   Naturally occurring parasitoids can help in reducing fruit fly populations, but their availability and practical application for farmers in Haryana might be limited. Conserving natural enemies by judicious use of pesticides is important.

**4. Chemical Control (as a last resort or in severe infestations):**
*   **Poison Bait Sprays:** This is a highly effective and targeted method.
    *   Mix **Malathion 50% EC** at 2 ml/L of water with 10 g of jaggery or molasses.
    *   Apply this bait mixture as spot sprays on the leaves (not directly on fruits) in the evening, targeting 50-100 spots per acre. The flies are attracted to the jaggery/molasses and consume the insecticide.
*   **Foliar Sprays (for severe infestations):**
    *   **Spinosad 45% SC**: 0.15 ml/L of water.
    *   **Cyantraniliprole 10.26% OD**: 0.36 ml/L of water.
    *   Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage and developing fruits. Always observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) mentioned on the product label.

### Control of Ber Fly in Snake Gourd

This is not known to affect Snake Gourd. The Ber fly (*Carpomyia vesuviana*) is a host-specific pest primarily affecting Ber (Ziziphus mauritiana) fruits and does not infest cucurbit crops like Snake Gourd.
