Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I understand the challenges posed by environmental stresses on crops like Snake Gourd (Trichosanthes cucumerina). This crop is sensitive to extreme weather conditions. Here's how you can protect your Snake Gourd from environmental stress:

### 1. Protection from Extreme Cold and Frost

Snake Gourd is a warm-season crop and is highly susceptible to cold temperatures and frost, which can severely damage or kill the plants.

*   **Site Selection and Planting Time:** In Haryana, avoid planting Snake Gourd during the peak winter months (December to February) when the risk of frost is highest. Opt for early spring (February-March) or late monsoon (July-August) plantings to avoid extreme cold.
*   **Mulching:** Apply a thick layer (5-10 cm) of organic mulch such as straw, dry leaves, or sugarcane trash around the base of the plants. This insulates the soil, retains warmth, and protects the root zone from freezing temperatures.
*   **Row Covers/Low Tunnels:** For young plants, use transparent plastic sheets or agro-textile covers to create low tunnels. This traps heat, raises the ambient temperature around the plants, and protects them from direct frost. Ensure proper ventilation during warmer parts of the day to prevent excessive humidity and heat buildup.
*   **Irrigation:** Lightly irrigate the field in the late afternoon before an expected frost. Water has a higher specific heat capacity and releases latent heat as it freezes, which can slightly raise the ambient temperature around the plants, offering some protection.
*   **Windbreaks:** Plant taller crops or erect temporary barriers (e.g., jute screens, plastic sheets) on the northern and western sides of your field to protect the Snake Gourd plants from cold, desiccating winds.

### 2. Protection from Heat/Loo and Intense Sunlight

While Snake Gourd thrives in warm conditions, extreme heat (above 40°C), hot dry winds (Loo), and intense direct sunlight can lead to flower drop, poor fruit set, leaf scorching, and sunburn on fruits.

*   **Shade Nets:** Install green or black shade nets (30-50% shade intensity) over your crop during the peak summer months (April-June). This significantly reduces the temperature around the plants and protects them from direct, intense sunlight.
*   **Mulching:** Maintain a thick layer of organic mulch to keep soil temperatures lower, conserve soil moisture, and reduce evaporation, which is crucial during hot periods.
*   **Adequate and Timely Irrigation:** Provide frequent and adequate irrigation, especially during hot periods and when hot winds (Loo) are prevalent. Drip irrigation is highly efficient in delivering water directly to the root zone. Overhead irrigation during the cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) can also help reduce canopy temperature.
*   **Windbreaks:** Plant taller crops or erect temporary barriers on the western and southern sides of the field to protect the Snake Gourd plants from hot, dry winds (Loo).
*   **Foliar Sprays:**
    *   **Kaolin clay:** Spray a 5% solution (50 g/L of water) of **Kaolin clay** on the foliage and fruits. This creates a reflective white film that reduces leaf and fruit temperature by reflecting sunlight. Repeat the application every 10-15 days or after heavy rains.
    *   **Potassium nitrate:** A foliar spray of 1-2% **Potassium nitrate** (10-20 g/L of water) can enhance the plant's heat tolerance and improve water use efficiency. Apply during the cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening).
    *   **Glycine betaine:** A foliar spray of 0.5-1% **Glycine betaine** (5-10 g/L of water) can act as an osmoprotectant, helping plants cope with heat and drought stress by maintaining cellular turgor. Apply during the cooler parts of the day.

By implementing these practices, you can significantly mitigate the adverse effects of environmental stresses and ensure a healthy and productive Snake Gourd crop.
