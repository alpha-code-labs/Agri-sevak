As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following doses of organic manures and bio-stimulants for Snake Gourd cultivation in Haryana, based on scientific principles and local agricultural practices:

It is crucial to conduct a soil test to determine the specific nutrient deficiencies and pH of your field. This will allow for more precise recommendations. However, general recommendations for healthy growth are as follows:

*   **Farmyard Manure (FYM):**
    *   **Dose:** 15-20 tonnes per acre.
    *   **Application:** Incorporate thoroughly into the soil during land preparation, at least 2-3 weeks before sowing or transplanting. This provides essential macro and micronutrients, improves soil structure, water retention, and microbial activity.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   **Dose:** 4-5 tonnes per acre.
    *   **Application:** Can be applied during land preparation along with or as a partial replacement for FYM. Alternatively, it can be used as a top dressing at 1-2 tonnes per acre during critical growth stages like flowering and fruit development, applied near the root zone. Vermicompost offers readily available nutrients and beneficial microbes.

*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract based product):**
    *   **Nature:** **Sagarika** is a commercially available seaweed extract-based bio-stimulant and micronutrient supplement, not a bulk organic manure like FYM or vermicompost. It enhances plant growth, nutrient uptake, and stress tolerance.
    *   **Granular Form:**
        *   **Dose:** 8-10 kg per acre.
        *   **Application:** Apply as a basal dose during land preparation or broadcasting near the root zone during early vegetative growth stages.
    *   **Liquid Form:**
        *   **Dose:** 2.5-5 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Application:** Foliar spray at critical growth stages such as vegetative growth, pre-flowering, and fruit development. Repeat applications every 15-20 days as needed, ensuring thorough coverage of the foliage.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always ensure that FYM and Vermicompost are well-decomposed to avoid pest issues and nutrient immobilization.
*   Integrated nutrient management, combining organic manures with balanced chemical fertilizers (based on soil test recommendations), is often the most effective approach for optimal yields and soil health.
