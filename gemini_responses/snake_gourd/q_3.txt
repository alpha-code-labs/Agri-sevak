As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm that all the mentioned rot types – Root, Stem, Foot, Collar, Crown, Neck, Black, Fruit, Seed, and Seedling rot – are known to affect Snake Gourd (Trichosanthes cucumerina) in varying degrees, primarily caused by a complex of fungal and oomycete pathogens. Effective control requires an integrated approach combining cultural practices, sanitation, and judicious use of CIBRC-approved chemical interventions.

Here's a comprehensive strategy for managing these rot types in Snake Gourd:

**I. General Cultural and Preventive Measures (Applicable to all Rot Types):**

These practices are crucial for reducing inoculum, improving plant health, and creating an unfavorable environment for pathogens.

*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice a minimum of 2-3 years of rotation with non-cucurbit crops (e.g., cereals, pulses) to break the disease cycle and reduce soil-borne pathogen build-up.
*   **Field Sanitation:**
    *   Remove and destroy all infected plant debris, weeds, and volunteer plants from the field promptly.
    *   Clean tools and equipment regularly to prevent pathogen spread.
*   **Soil Management:**
    *   Ensure excellent soil drainage. Avoid waterlogging, which favors many rot-causing pathogens (especially *Pythium* and *Phytophthora*).
    *   Consider planting on raised beds, especially in heavy soils or areas prone to water accumulation.
    *   Deep ploughing during summer can expose soil-borne pathogens to sunlight, reducing their viability.
*   **Irrigation Management:**
    *   Use drip irrigation instead of overhead irrigation to keep foliage and stems dry, reducing spore dispersal and infection.
    *   If overhead irrigation is unavoidable, irrigate in the morning to allow plants to dry quickly.
    *   Avoid overwatering; irrigate based on soil moisture and plant needs.
*   **Seed Selection:** Always use certified, disease-free seeds from reputable sources.
*   **Planting Density:** Maintain optimal plant spacing to ensure good air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce humidity and fungal growth.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Provide balanced nutrition. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can lead to lush, succulent growth more susceptible to disease.
*   **Weed Control:** Keep the field free of weeds, as they can act as alternative hosts for pathogens and impede air circulation.

**II. Specific Control Measures:**

**A. For Seed Rot and Seedling Rot (Damping-off):**

These rots occur before or shortly after germination, affecting seeds and young seedlings.

*   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds before sowing with CIBRC-approved fungicides.
    *   **Carbendazim** at 1-2 g per kg of seed.
    *   **Thiram** at 2-3 g per kg of seed.
    *   **Captan** at 2-3 g per kg of seed.
    *   Combination products containing **Metalaxyl-M** + **Difenoconazole** or **Metalaxyl-M** + **Mancozeb** at recommended rates (e.g., 1-2 ml or g per kg of seed) are highly effective against oomycetes causing damping-off.
*   **Soil Solarization:** In nursery beds, solarize the soil during hot summer months (4-6 weeks) to reduce pathogen load.
*   **Sterile Growing Media:** Use sterilized potting mix for raising seedlings in nurseries.

**B. For Root Rot, Stem Rot, Foot Rot, Collar Rot, Crown Rot, and Neck Rot:**

These rots typically affect the plant at or below the soil line, often caused by *Pythium*, *Phytophthora*, *Rhizoctonia*, *Fusarium*, and *Sclerotium rolfsii*.

*   **Soil Drenching:**
    *   For oomycete pathogens (*Pythium*, *Phytophthora*):
        *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride** at 2-3 ml per litre of water, applied as a drench around the plant base.
        *   **Metalaxyl-M** + **Mancozeb** (combination product) at 2-2.5 g per litre of water, as a drench.
        *   **Fosetyl-aluminium** at 2-3 g per litre of water, as a drench.
    *   For fungal pathogens (*Rhizoctonia*, *Fusarium*, *Sclerotium*):
        *   **Carbendazim** at 1-2 g per litre of water, as a drench.
        *   **Thiophanate methyl** at 1-1.5 g per litre of water, as a drench.
        *   **Validamycin** at 2-3 ml per litre of water, as a drench, particularly effective against *Rhizoctonia*.
*   **Bio-control Agents:** Incorporate beneficial microbes like *Trichoderma viride* or *Pseudomonas fluorescens* into the soil or as a seed treatment. These can suppress soil-borne pathogens. (Follow manufacturer's recommended rates for soil application, e.g., 2.5 kg per acre mixed with farmyard manure).

**C. For Black Rot and Fruit Rot:**

Black rot is often associated with Gummy Stem Blight (*Didymella bryoniae*), which causes stem lesions, leaf spots, and fruit rot. Other pathogens like *Phytophthora*, *Colletotrichum*, and *Sclerotium* can also cause fruit rots.

*   **Foliar Sprays (Preventive and Curative):**
    *   For broad-spectrum control, including *Didymella bryoniae* and other fruit rot pathogens:
        *   **Chlorothalonil** at 2 g per litre of water.
        *   **Mancozeb** at 2-2.5 g per litre of water.
        *   **Copper oxychloride** at 2.5-3 g per litre of water.
    *   For systemic control and specific fungal pathogens:
        *   **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5-1 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Pyraclostrobin** at 0.5-1 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Difenoconazole** at 0.5 ml per litre of water, particularly effective against *Didymella bryoniae*.
        *   **Carbendazim** at 1-1.5 g per litre of water.
        *   **Thiophanate methyl** at 1-1.5 g per litre of water.
    *   For oomycete-induced fruit rots (*Phytophthora*, *Pythium*):
        *   **Metalaxyl-M** + **Mancozeb** (combination product) at 2-2.5 g per litre of water.
        *   **Fosetyl-aluminium** at 2-3 g per litre of water.
*   **Pruning:** Remove infected leaves, stems, and fruits immediately and destroy them away from the field to reduce inoculum.
*   **Support Systems:** Use trellises or stakes to keep fruits off the ground, reducing contact with soil-borne pathogens.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the fungicide label for correct dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in pathogens.
*   Apply fungicides preventively, especially during periods conducive to disease development (e.g., high humidity, prolonged wetness).
*   Consult with local HAU extension specialists for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and prevailing disease pressure.
