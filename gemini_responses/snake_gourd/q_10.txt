As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in Snake Gourd in Haryana:

### Control of Borers in Snake Gourd

Borers, particularly fruit borers (e.g., melon fruit fly, *Bactrocera cucurbitae*, and lepidopteran fruit borers like *Spodoptera litura* larvae), can cause significant damage to Snake Gourd.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Regularly collect and destroy infested fruits to break the pest life cycle.
    *   Practice field sanitation by removing crop residues and weeds.
    *   Bag developing fruits with paper or cloth bags to prevent fruit fly oviposition.
*   **Mechanical Control:**
    *   Install pheromone traps (e.g., for melon fruit fly) at 4-5 traps per acre for monitoring and mass trapping.
*   **Chemical Control (Apply only when necessary, observing pre-harvest interval):**
    *   For fruit flies, use bait sprays:
        *   **Malathion** 50% EC @ 2 ml/L mixed with 10 g/L jaggery or protein hydrolysate. Apply on small patches of leaves, not directly on fruits.
    *   For lepidopteran fruit borers:
        *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC @ 0.3 ml/L of water.
        *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG @ 0.2 g/L of water.
        *   **Spinosad** 45% SC @ 0.25 ml/L of water.
        *   **Flubendiamide** 20% WG @ 0.25 g/L of water.

### Control of Caterpillars in Snake Gourd

Various caterpillar species can infest Snake Gourd, feeding on leaves, stems, and fruits.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Regularly scout the field for egg masses and young larvae and hand-pick and destroy them.
    *   Maintain field sanitation.
*   **Biological Control:**
    *   Apply **Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki** (Bt) @ 1-2 g/L of water, especially effective against young larvae.
*   **Chemical Control (Rotate chemicals with different modes of action to prevent resistance):**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC @ 0.3 ml/L of water.
    *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG @ 0.2 g/L of water.
    *   **Spinosad** 45% SC @ 0.25 ml/L of water.
    *   **Flubendiamide** 20% WG @ 0.25 g/L of water.
    *   **Indoxacarb** 14.5% SC @ 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC @ 0.5 ml/L of water (for broad-spectrum control in severe infestations).

### Control of Diamondback Moth in Snake Gourd

This is not known to affect Snake Gourd. Diamondback moth (*Plutella xylostella*) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops.

### Control of Leaf folder in Snake Gourd

Leaf folders (e.g., cucurbit leaf folder, *Diaphania indica*) can cause damage by folding leaves and feeding inside, reducing photosynthetic area.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Regularly inspect plants and hand-pick and destroy folded leaves containing larvae.
    *   Maintain good field sanitation.
*   **Chemical Control (Apply when infestation is observed, targeting young larvae):**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC @ 0.3 ml/L of water.
    *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG @ 0.2 g/L of water.
    *   **Spinosad** 45% SC @ 0.25 ml/L of water.
    *   **Flubendiamide** 20% WG @ 0.25 g/L of water.
    *   **Indoxacarb** 14.5% SC @ 0.5 ml/L of water.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the pesticide label, including dosage, application method, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Ensure proper spray coverage for effective pest control.
*   Apply pesticides during the cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.
