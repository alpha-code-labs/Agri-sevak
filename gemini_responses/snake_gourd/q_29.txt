Dear Farmer,

Flower and fruit dropping in Snake Gourd (Chichinda) is a common concern that can significantly reduce yield. While the term "Tinda/Boll dropping" is not specifically used for Snake Gourd (Tinda is a different gourd, and boll refers to cotton), the underlying physiological reasons for fruit drop are similar. This phenomenon is often multifactorial, stemming from environmental stress, nutritional imbalances, poor pollination, or hormonal factors.

Here is scientifically verified advice to control dropping in Snake Gourd:

**I. Agronomic and Cultural Practices:**

1.  **Optimal Water Management:** Both water stress (drought) and waterlogging can lead to flower and fruit drop.
    *   Maintain consistent soil moisture, especially during flowering and fruiting stages.
    *   Irrigate deeply and regularly, particularly during dry spells. Avoid overhead irrigation during flowering to prevent washing away pollen.
    *   Use mulching to conserve soil moisture and regulate soil temperature.

2.  **Balanced Nutrient Management:**
    *   Ensure a balanced supply of macro (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium) and micronutrients.
    *   Excessive nitrogen can lead to lush vegetative growth at the expense of flowering and fruiting, sometimes causing drop.
    *   Potassium is crucial for fruit development and stress tolerance.

3.  **Enhance Pollination:**
    *   Snake Gourd flowers are primarily pollinated by insects, especially bees.
    *   Avoid spraying insecticides during peak flowering times (early morning) when pollinators are most active.
    *   Consider planting pollinator-attracting plants nearby.
    *   In cases of poor natural pollination, hand pollination can be done in the early morning hours.

4.  **Temperature and Humidity Management:**
    *   Extreme temperatures (very high or very low) and sudden fluctuations can cause stress, leading to drop.
    *   High humidity can sometimes hinder pollen dispersal, while very low humidity can dry out pollen.
    *   Ensure proper plant spacing for good air circulation.

5.  **Pest and Disease Management:**
    *   While not a direct cause of dropping, severe infestations of pests (e.g., fruit flies, mites, aphids) or diseases can weaken the plant, making it more susceptible to flower and fruit drop. Implement timely and appropriate pest and disease control measures.

**II. Nutritional Management (Micronutrients):**

Deficiencies of certain micronutrients are directly linked to flower and fruit drop.

*   **Boron:** Essential for pollen germination, pollen tube growth, and fruit set.
    *   Foliar spray of **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate) or **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** at 1-2 g/L of water, applied at pre-flowering and early fruit set stages.
*   **Zinc:** Important for hormone synthesis and overall plant vigor.
    *   Foliar spray of **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** at 5 g/L of water, or chelated zinc as per product recommendations, applied before flowering.

**III. Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs):**

Certain CIBRC approved plant growth regulators can help in reducing flower and fruit drop by influencing hormonal balance.

*   **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA):** This auxin helps in preventing abscission (shedding) of flowers and young fruits.
    *   Foliar spray of **Naphthalene Acetic Acid** at 10-20 mg/L (0.01-0.02 g/L) of water. Apply at the initiation of flowering and repeat once or twice at 10-15 day intervals, depending on the severity of dropping. Ensure thorough coverage of flowers and young fruits.

By adopting an integrated approach combining good agronomic practices, balanced nutrition, and judicious use of CIBRC approved plant growth regulators, you can effectively manage flower and fruit dropping in Snake Gourd and achieve a healthier yield.
