As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling sucking pests in Snake Gourd (Trichosanthes cucumerina) in Haryana.

Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips are common and significant sucking pests of Snake Gourd. They can cause direct damage by feeding on plant sap, leading to stunted growth, leaf curling, yellowing, and reduced yield. They also excrete honeydew, which promotes sooty mold growth, and many species are vectors for plant viruses.

**Psylla:** This is not commonly known to be a significant pest of Snake Gourd in Haryana. While some psyllid species might occasionally feed on cucurbits, they rarely cause economic damage. Therefore, specific control measures for Psylla are generally not required, and the strategies for other sucking pests would likely manage any incidental infestation.

An Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is crucial for effective and sustainable control of these pests.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy crop residues after harvest to reduce pest carry-over.
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the field and surrounding areas free of weeds, as many weeds serve as alternate hosts for these pests.
    *   **Proper Nutrition and Irrigation:** Maintain optimal plant health through balanced fertilization and timely irrigation, as stressed plants are more susceptible to pest attacks.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-cucurbit crops to break the pest life cycle.
    *   **Reflective Mulches:** Use silver-colored reflective mulches (e.g., polyethylene film) in the early stages of crop growth to deter winged aphids, whiteflies, and thrips.
    *   **Yellow Sticky Traps:** Install yellow sticky traps (10-15 traps per acre) at crop height for monitoring pest populations and mass trapping of adult whiteflies, aphids, and leafhoppers.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Protect and encourage natural enemies such as ladybird beetles, lacewings, hoverfly larvae (predators of aphids), and parasitic wasps (e.g., *Encarsia formosa* for whiteflies). Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.
    *   **Biopesticides:** Consider using entomopathogenic fungi like *Beauveria bassiana* or *Verticillium lecanii* (now *Lecanicillium lecanii*) during early infestation stages, especially under high humidity conditions.

3.  **Chemical Control (Use as a last resort, based on Economic Threshold Levels - ETL):**
    *   Regularly monitor your crop for pest incidence. Apply insecticides only when pest populations reach ETLs (e.g., 5-10 aphids/leaf, 2-3 whiteflies/leaf, 5-10 thrips/flower).
    *   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.
    *   Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where many of these pests reside.
    *   Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI).

**Recommended CIBRC Approved Insecticides for Sucking Pests in Snake Gourd:**

For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips, you can choose from the following technical chemicals. It is advisable to rotate between different groups of chemicals.

*   **For early infestation and general sucking pest control:**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** 0.5 - 0.75 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** 0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water.
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** 0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water.

*   **For Whiteflies (especially nymphs) and Thrips:**
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** 1.25 ml per litre of water. (Effective against nymphs, acts as an insect growth regulator).
    *   **Diafenthiuron 50% WP:** 1.2 g per litre of water. (Effective against whiteflies, thrips, and mites).
    *   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** 0.5 ml per litre of water. (Effective against whiteflies and mites).

*   **For Thrips and Leafhoppers:**
    *   **Fipronil 5% SC:** 1.5 - 2.0 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Spinosad 45% SC:** 0.25 - 0.3 ml per litre of water. (Effective against thrips and caterpillars).

*   **For Aphids and Whiteflies (specific action):**
    *   **Flonicamid 50% WG:** 0.3 g per litre of water.
    *   **Pymetrozine 50% WG:** 0.3 - 0.4 g per litre of water.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always use the recommended water volume (typically 200-400 litres per acre depending on crop stage and canopy size) to ensure proper coverage.
*   Spray during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and current pest pressure.
