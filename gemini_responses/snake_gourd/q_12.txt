Namaste! Scale insects and mealybugs are common sap-sucking pests that can significantly damage Snake Gourd (Parwal) crops in Haryana, leading to stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, sooty mould development, and reduced yield. Effective management requires an integrated approach.

Here's how to control them:

**I. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Regular Monitoring:** Inspect plants frequently, especially the undersides of leaves, stems, and fruit, for early signs of infestation.
    *   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy heavily infested leaves, stems, or fruits immediately to prevent spread.
    *   **Water Jets:** For small infestations, a strong jet of water can dislodge mealybugs and scales from the plant surface. Repeat as necessary.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove weeds and crop residues that can harbour pests.
    *   **Proper Nutrition:** Ensure balanced fertilization, as over-fertilization with nitrogen can sometimes make plants more susceptible.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Encourage beneficial insects like ladybird beetles (coccinellids), lacewings, and parasitic wasps, which are natural predators and parasitoids of mealybugs and scale insects. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficials.

**II. Chemical Control (If necessary and as a last resort):**

When infestations are severe and cultural/biological methods are insufficient, chemical intervention may be required. Always ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and stem joints where these pests tend to hide. Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

**For Scale Insects and Mealybugs:**

*   **For Nymphal Stages (Crawlers) and Early Infestations:**
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at a concentration of 1.25 - 1.5 ml per litre of water. This is an insect growth regulator effective against nymphs.
    *   **Azadirachtin 1500 ppm (Neem Oil based formulation):** Apply at a concentration of 5 ml per litre of water. Effective as a repellent and antifeedant, particularly for early stages and as part of an IPM strategy.

*   **For Established Infestations (Systemic Action):**
    *   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:** Apply at a concentration of 0.75 - 1.0 ml per litre of water. This is a systemic insecticide that moves both upwards and downwards in the plant, reaching hidden pests.
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at a concentration of 0.5 ml per litre of water. A systemic insecticide effective against sucking pests.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at a concentration of 0.25 g per litre of water. Another systemic insecticide providing good control of sucking pests.
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply at a concentration of 0.2 g per litre of water. A systemic insecticide effective against a range of sucking pests.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Spray Timing:** Apply insecticides during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially targeting the undersides of leaves and stem crevices where these pests are often found.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) like gloves, masks, and protective clothing while handling and spraying chemicals.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Strictly observe the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) mentioned on the insecticide label to ensure the produce is safe for consumption.
*   **Consult Local Experts:** For specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions, always consult with local agricultural extension officers or HAU experts.
