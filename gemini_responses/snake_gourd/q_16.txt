As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend the following fertilizer schedule for Snake Gourd (Trichosanthes cucumerina) in Haryana, keeping in mind the importance of balanced nutrition for optimal yield and quality. These recommendations are general and should ideally be adjusted based on a soil test report from your field.

**General NPK Recommendation (Elemental Basis):**
For Snake Gourd, a typical recommendation is around 80-100 kg Nitrogen (N), 50-60 kg Phosphorus (P2O5), and 50-60 kg Potassium (K2O) per acre. Sulphur is also crucial for cucurbits.

**Fertilizer Application Schedule:**

**1. Basal Application (at the time of sowing/planting):**
Apply the following fertilizers uniformly in the soil and mix well before sowing or transplanting.

*   **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP):** 100-120 kg per acre
    *   *Alternatively, if using Single Super Phosphate:*
        *   **Single Super Phosphate (SSP):** 300-350 kg per acre
*   **Muriate of Potash (MOP):** 40-45 kg per acre
*   **Urea:** 40-50 kg per acre
*   **Sulphur (elemental):** 10-15 kg per acre (if not using SSP, as SSP provides sulphur)

**2. Top Dressing (30-45 days after sowing/planting):**
This application supports vigorous vegetative growth.

*   **Urea:** 40-50 kg per acre
*   **Muriate of Potash (MOP):** 40-45 kg per acre (especially beneficial for heavy fruiting varieties or if soil test indicates low K)

**3. Top Dressing (at flowering/early fruiting stage):**
This application supports fruit development and yield.

*   **Urea:** 40-50 kg per acre

**4. Nano Fertilizers (Foliar Application):**
Nano fertilizers offer high nutrient use efficiency and are excellent for supplementing granular applications, especially during critical growth stages or when nutrient deficiencies are observed.

*   **Nano-Urea:** 2-4 ml per litre of water
    *   *Application:* Apply 2-4 foliar sprays at 15-20 day intervals, starting from 30-45 days after sowing, particularly during active vegetative growth and fruit development stages.
*   **Nano-DAP:** 2-4 ml per litre of water
    *   *Application:* Apply 1-2 foliar sprays, especially at the pre-flowering and fruit setting stages, to boost flowering and fruit development.

**5. NPK Compound Fertilizers:**
If you prefer using NPK compound fertilizers, select a balanced grade like 19:19:19 or 12:32:16. The dose will depend on the specific grade and the NPK requirement. For example, if using NPK 19:19:19, you might apply 150-200 kg per acre in split doses (basal and top dressing) to meet a portion of the NPK requirement, and then supplement with additional Urea and Potash as needed. However, using individual fertilizers as outlined above allows for more precise nutrient management.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Soil Testing:** The most accurate fertilizer recommendations come from a recent soil test report. This helps in understanding the existing nutrient status of your soil and tailoring the application precisely.
*   **Organic Manures:** Incorporating well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) at 10-15 tonnes per acre or vermicompost at 2-3 tonnes per acre during land preparation significantly improves soil health and nutrient availability.
*   **Irrigation:** Ensure adequate and timely irrigation, especially after fertilizer application, to facilitate nutrient uptake by the plants.
*   **Micronutrients:** While not explicitly asked, ensure your soil has adequate micronutrients. If deficiencies are suspected, a foliar spray of a good micronutrient mixture can be beneficial.
