As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling diseases in Snake Gourd in Haryana:

**Control of Dieback and Twig Blight in Snake Gourd**

Dieback and Twig Blight are symptoms often associated with fungal pathogens such as *Colletotrichum orbiculare* (causing Anthracnose) or *Didymella bryoniae* / *Stagonosporopsis cucurbitacearum* (causing Gummy Stem Blight) in cucurbits like Snake Gourd. These diseases can lead to the progressive death of twigs, stems, and branches. Effective management requires an integrated approach combining cultural practices and timely chemical interventions.

**Cultural Practices:**
*   **Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy infected plant debris from the field to reduce inoculum sources.
*   **Seed Selection:** Use certified disease-free seeds or treat seeds with recommended fungicides.
*   **Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to promote good air circulation, which helps reduce humidity and fungal growth.
*   **Irrigation:** Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day, to minimize leaf wetness duration. Drip irrigation is preferable.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-cucurbit crops for at least 2-3 years to break the disease cycle.

**Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
Upon the appearance of initial symptoms, or as a preventive measure during conducive weather conditions (high humidity, moderate temperatures), the following CIBRC approved fungicides can be used:

*   **For Preventive Application:**
    *   **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Copper Oxychloride** at 3 g/L of water.
*   **For Curative Application (upon symptom appearance):**
    *   **Carbendazim** at 1 g/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Difenoconazole** at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   A combination product containing **Azoxystrobin + Difenoconazole** can be used as per label recommendations (typically 0.5-1 ml/L of water).
    *   **Propiconazole** at 0.5 ml/L of water.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of fungicide resistance.
*   Ensure thorough coverage of the plant, including the undersides of leaves and stems, during spraying.
*   Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the product label for dosage, application timing, and safety precautions.
*   Maintain a spray interval of 7-10 days, adjusting based on disease severity and prevailing weather conditions.

**Tikka Disease**

This is not known to affect Snake Gourd. Tikka disease is primarily a foliar disease of groundnut (peanut).
