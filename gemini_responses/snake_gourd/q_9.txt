Mites, including Red Spider Mite (Tetranychus urticae) and various species of Rust Mites (Eriophyidae family), are significant pests of Snake Gourd (Trichosanthes cucumerina) in Haryana, particularly during hot and dry periods. They cause damage by sucking sap from leaves, leading to yellowing, bronzing, leaf distortion, and reduced fruit yield and quality.

Effective control requires an integrated pest management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods.

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infested plant debris after harvest to reduce carry-over populations.
*   **Proper Irrigation:** Maintain adequate soil moisture, as water stress can exacerbate mite problems. Overhead irrigation can sometimes help dislodge mites, but be mindful of fungal disease risks.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can promote lush, succulent growth attractive to mites.
*   **Weed Control:** Keep the field free of weeds, as many weeds can serve as alternate hosts for mites.

**2. Biological Control:**
*   **Natural Enemies:** Conserve naturally occurring predatory mites (e.g., *Amblyseius* spp., *Phytoseiulus persimilis*) and insects (e.g., ladybird beetles, lacewings) by minimizing broad-spectrum pesticide use.
*   **Neem-based formulations:** **Azadirachtin** (e.g., 1500 ppm or 3000 ppm) can act as an antifeedant, repellent, and disrupt mite growth. Apply at 3-5 ml/L of water, especially in early stages of infestation.

**3. Chemical Control (as a last resort, when infestation is severe):**
When mite populations reach economic threshold levels, chemical control becomes necessary. Always rotate miticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development. Ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where mites reside.

**Recommended CIBRC-approved Miticides for Snake Gourd:**

*   **Spiromesifen** 22.9% SC: Apply at 0.5 ml/L of water.
*   **Fenpyroximate** 5% SC: Apply at 1.0 ml/L of water.
*   **Propargite** 57% EC: Apply at 1.5-2.0 ml/L of water.
*   **Abamectin** 1.9% EC: Apply at 0.4-0.5 ml/L of water.
*   **Wettable Sulphur** 80% WP: Apply at 2.0-3.0 g/L of water. This is effective against both mites and powdery mildew, especially in cooler weather. Avoid application during very hot conditions (above 30-32°C) as it can cause phytotoxicity.
*   **Dicofol** 18.5% EC: Apply at 2.0-2.5 ml/L of water. (Note: Resistance issues are common with Dicofol, so use judiciously and in rotation).
*   **Etoxazole** 10% SC: Apply at 0.5 ml/L of water. (Mite growth regulator, effective against eggs and nymphs).
*   **Pyridaben** 10% WP: Apply at 1.0 g/L of water.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Rotation:** Always rotate miticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in mite populations.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where mites are most prevalent.
*   **Timing:** Apply miticides when mite populations are building up, before they cause extensive damage. Repeat applications may be necessary based on pest pressure and product residual activity.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and application. Follow label instructions carefully regarding dosage, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and safety precautions.
*   **Water Quality:** Use clean water for spraying. Adjuvants (spreaders/stickers) can improve efficacy.
