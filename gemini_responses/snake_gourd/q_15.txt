Here is the scientifically verified advice for managing the mentioned pests in Snake Gourd (Trichosanthes cucumerina) in Haryana:

### Grasshopper

Grasshoppers can cause significant damage by feeding on leaves, stems, and young fruits, especially during early growth stages.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Regular monitoring of the field to detect infestations early.
    *   Hand-picking and destroying grasshoppers, especially in small areas or during initial stages of infestation.
    *   Maintain field sanitation by removing weeds and crop residues that can serve as breeding grounds.
*   **Chemical Control (for severe infestations):**
    *   Spray with:
        *   **Malathion** 50% EC at 2.0 - 3.0 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 0.4 - 0.5 ml per litre of water.

### Painted Bug

This is not known to affect Snake Gourd. Painted bug (Bagrada hilaris) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops like mustard, cabbage, and cauliflower.

### Red Cotton Bug

This is not known to affect Snake Gourd. Red cotton bug (Dysdercus cingulatus) is primarily a pest of cotton and other malvaceous plants, feeding on developing seeds.

### Black Ants

Black ants are generally not direct pests of Snake Gourd. They are often secondary pests, attracted to the honeydew secreted by sap-sucking insects like aphids, whiteflies, or mealybugs. They protect these sap-suckers from natural enemies, thus indirectly harming the plant by promoting the sap-sucker population.

*   **Management Strategy:**
    *   **Control primary sap-sucking pests:** The most effective way to manage black ants is to control the primary sap-sucking insects that produce honeydew. Once the honeydew source is eliminated, the ants will naturally disperse.
    *   **Cultural Control:**
        *   Keep the field free of weeds and debris, which can provide shelter for ants.
        *   Prune lower leaves that touch the ground to reduce ant access to the plant canopy.
    *   **Direct Ant Control (if necessary, targeting trails or nests):**
        *   Apply a drench of **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 2.0 - 2.5 ml per litre of water around the base of the affected plants or directly on ant trails/nests. Ensure the application is targeted and does not contaminate the edible parts of the plant.
