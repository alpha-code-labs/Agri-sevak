As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Snake Gourd in Haryana:

It is crucial to adopt an integrated approach combining cultural practices with judicious use of CIBRC approved fungicides for effective disease management. Always follow label instructions for dosage, application, and pre-harvest intervals.

### Fungal Diseases Affecting Snake Gourd:

1.  **Alternaria Leaf Spot (*Alternaria cucumerina*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Small, circular, water-soaked spots on older leaves, which enlarge into angular lesions with concentric rings (target-spot appearance). Severe infection can lead to defoliation.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   **Cultural:** Practice crop rotation, remove and destroy infected plant debris, ensure proper plant spacing for good air circulation.
        *   **Chemical:**
            *   Spray with **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water.
            *   Alternatively, use **Chlorothalonil** at 2 g/L of water.
            *   For systemic action, apply **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5 ml/L of water.
            *   Another option is **Difenoconazole** at 0.5 ml/L of water.

2.  **Anthracnose (*Colletotrichum orbiculare*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Circular, dark, sunken lesions on leaves, stems, and fruits. On fruits, these lesions can be deep and cause rot.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   **Cultural:** Use disease-free seeds, practice crop rotation, avoid overhead irrigation, and remove infected plant parts.
        *   **Chemical:**
            *   Spray with **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water.
            *   Alternatively, use **Chlorothalonil** at 2 g/L of water.
            *   For systemic control, apply **Carbendazim** at 1 g/L of water.
            *   Another effective option is **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5 ml/L of water.

3.  **Blight (*Phytophthora capsici*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Water-soaked lesions on leaves, stems, and fruits, leading to rapid wilting and collapse of the plant. Fruit rot is common, especially when in contact with soil.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   **Cultural:** Ensure good field drainage, plant on raised beds, avoid waterlogging, and practice crop rotation.
        *   **Chemical:**
            *   Apply **Propamocarb hydrochloride** at 2.5 ml/L of water.
            *   Alternatively, use a combination product of **Cymoxanil + Mancozeb** at 3 g/L of water.
            *   Another option is **Fenamidone + Propamocarb hydrochloride** at 2.5 ml/L of water.
            *   **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L can be used as a protectant.

4.  **Downy Mildew (*Pseudoperonospora cubensis*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Angular, yellow spots on the upper surface of leaves, often delimited by veins. A purplish-grey, fuzzy growth may be visible on the underside of the leaves, especially in humid conditions.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   **Cultural:** Plant resistant varieties (if available), ensure good air circulation, avoid overhead irrigation, and remove infected leaves.
        *   **Chemical:**
            *   Spray with **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water.
            *   Alternatively, use **Chlorothalonil** at 2 g/L of water.
            *   For systemic control, apply **Propamocarb hydrochloride** at 2.5 ml/L of water.
            *   Combination products like **Cymoxanil + Mancozeb** at 3 g/L of water or **Fenamidone + Propamocarb hydrochloride** at 2.5 ml/L of water are highly effective.
            *   **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5 ml/L of water can also be used.

5.  **Powdery Mildew (*Podosphaera xanthii* and *Erysiphe cichoracearum*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** White, powdery patches on the upper and lower surfaces of leaves, stems, and sometimes fruits. Severe infection can lead to yellowing, browning, and premature defoliation.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   **Cultural:** Plant resistant varieties (if available), ensure good air circulation, and remove severely infected leaves.
        *   **Chemical:**
            *   Apply **Sulphur (Wettable Sulphur)** at 2.5 g/L of water.
            *   Alternatively, use **Myclobutanil** at 0.5 g/L of water.
            *   Another effective option is **Penconazole** at 0.5 ml/L of water.
            *   **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5 ml/L of water or **Difenoconazole** at 0.5 ml/L of water can also be used.

### Diseases Not Known to Affect Snake Gourd:

*   **Blast:** This is not known to affect Snake Gourd.
*   **Brown spot:** This is not known to affect Snake Gourd.
*   **Grey mildew:** This is not known to affect Snake Gourd.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
*   Ensure thorough coverage of the plant, especially the undersides of leaves.
*   Consult your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your farm and current disease pressure.
