As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an integrated approach for managing diseases in Snake Gourd, combining cultural practices with judicious use of CIBRC-approved chemical interventions when necessary.

Here's the advice for the conditions you've mentioned:

### General Cultural Practices for Disease Management:

*   **Use Disease-Free Seeds:** Always source seeds from reputable suppliers to prevent the introduction of pathogens.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice a 2-3 year crop rotation with non-cucurbit crops to break disease cycles.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Promptly remove and destroy infected plant debris, weeds, and volunteer plants.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to improve air circulation, which helps reduce humidity and fungal growth.
*   **Irrigation Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day. Drip irrigation is preferred to keep foliage dry.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced fertilizers to maintain plant vigor, as stressed plants are more susceptible to diseases.

### Specific Control Measures:

#### 1. Scab (Caused by *Cladosporium cucumerinum*)

Scab can cause sunken, olive-green spots on fruits, leaves, and stems, leading to significant yield loss.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural:**
    *   Plant resistant varieties if available.
    *   Ensure good field sanitation.
*   **Chemical (Fungicides):**
    *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP): 2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Chlorothalonil** (75% WP): 2 g/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC): 0.5-1 ml/L of water.
    *   **Carbendazim 12% + Mancozeb 63% WP** (combination): 2 g/L of water.
    *   Apply fungicides preventively or at the first sign of symptoms, repeating as per label instructions and disease pressure.

#### 2. Canker and Gummosis (Often associated with Gummy Stem Blight, caused by *Didymella bryoniae*)

Canker refers to sunken lesions on stems, while gummosis is the exudation of amber-colored gum, often from these cankers or other injured plant parts. In Snake Gourd, these symptoms are frequently linked to Gummy Stem Blight.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural:**
    *   Use disease-free seeds.
    *   Practice strict crop rotation.
    *   Remove and destroy infected plant parts immediately.
    *   Avoid wounding plants during cultivation.
    *   Ensure good air circulation and avoid overhead irrigation.
*   **Chemical (Fungicides):**
    *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP): 2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Chlorothalonil** (75% WP): 2 g/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC): 0.5-1 ml/L of water.
    *   **Carbendazim 12% + Mancozeb 63% WP** (combination): 2 g/L of water.
    *   Begin applications preventively, especially during periods favorable for disease development (warm, humid conditions), or at the first appearance of symptoms.

#### 3. Lichen

This is not known to affect Snake Gourd. Lichens are symbiotic organisms (fungus and alga) that grow on the surface of plants, rocks, or soil. They are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants but do not parasitize them or draw nutrients from them. They are generally harmless to the host plant and are often an indicator of good air quality. Therefore, no control measures are typically required for lichens on Snake Gourd.
