Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the challenges posed by soil pests like termites and root-knot nematodes in Snake Gourd cultivation. Effective management is crucial for healthy plant growth and good yields. Here is scientifically verified advice for controlling these pests:

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Approach:**
A combination of cultural, biological, and chemical methods provides the most sustainable and effective control.

### **1. Control of Termites (Deemak)**

Termites can cause significant damage by feeding on roots and the base of the stem, leading to wilting and plant death, especially in young plants.

**A. Cultural and Mechanical Methods:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove all crop residues, stubble, and woody debris from the field before planting, as these can serve as food sources for termites.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** Deep summer ploughing exposes termite colonies to sunlight and predators, disrupting their nests.
*   **Avoid Organic Matter Accumulation:** Do not leave large quantities of undecomposed organic matter near the plant base.

**B. Chemical Control (Pre-planting/At planting):**
For effective control, soil treatment before or at the time of planting is highly recommended.

*   **Pre-planting Soil Treatment:**
    *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC**: Apply 2.5 litres per acre, mixed with 200-400 litres of water, and drench the soil thoroughly before planting. Alternatively, mix with sand and broadcast evenly, then incorporate into the soil during the last ploughing.
    *   **Fipronil 0.3% GR**: Apply 10-15 kg per acre, broadcast evenly and incorporate into the soil during the last ploughing.

*   **At Planting/Post-emergence (if infestation observed):**
    *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC**: If termite damage is observed after planting, drench the soil around the base of the affected plants with a solution of 2.5 ml per litre of water. Ensure the solution reaches the root zone.

### **2. Control of Nematodes (Root-knot Nematodes - Gaath Kripmi)**

Root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.) are a major problem in Snake Gourd, causing characteristic galls or knots on the roots. This impairs water and nutrient uptake, leading to stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, wilting, and significant yield reduction.

**A. Cultural and Biological Methods:**
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops such as cereals (maize, sorghum, pearl millet) or marigold (Tagetes spp.) for at least 2-3 years. Marigold roots release compounds that are toxic to nematodes.
*   **Summer Ploughing and Solarization:** Deep ploughing during hot summer months exposes nematode eggs and larvae to direct sunlight, killing them. Covering the soil with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks during summer (solarization) can also effectively reduce nematode populations.
*   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost.
    *   **Neem cake**: Apply 200-400 kg per acre, incorporated into the soil 2-3 weeks before planting. Neem cake releases compounds that are nematicidal and also improve soil health.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** If available, choose nematode-resistant Snake Gourd varieties.
*   **Bio-nematicides:** Apply biological agents like *Purpureocillium lilacinum* (formerly *Paecilomyces lilacinus*) or *Trichoderma harzianum* to the soil at planting. These fungi parasitize nematode eggs and larvae or promote plant growth, respectively.

**B. Chemical Control (Pre-planting/At planting):**
Chemical nematicides can provide quick and effective control, especially in heavily infested fields.

*   **At Planting:**
    *   **Carbofuran 3% G**: Apply 10-15 kg per acre, either broadcast and incorporated into the soil before planting or applied in furrows at the time of planting.
    *   **Phorate 10% G**: Apply 4 kg per acre, in furrows at the time of planting.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully regarding dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) for any chemical applied to ensure food safety.
*   For specific local recommendations or if you face persistent problems, please consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts.

By adopting these integrated strategies, you can effectively manage soil pests and ensure a healthy and productive Snake Gourd crop.
