As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified cultivation practices for Snake Gourd (Trichosanthes cucumerina) in Haryana:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   Snake Gourd is primarily grown by **direct sowing** of seeds.
    *   Seeds are typically sown on **ridges or raised beds**.
    *   For optimal yield and fruit quality, it is highly recommended to train the vines on **trellises, pandals, or arbours**. This prevents fruit deformity, reduces pest and disease incidence, and facilitates harvesting.
    *   Pits of 45 cm x 45 cm x 45 cm can be prepared at recommended spacing, filled with a mixture of soil and well-decomposed farmyard manure, and then seeds are sown. Alternatively, seeds can be sown directly on ridges.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   Seeds should be sown at a shallow depth of **2.0 to 3.0 cm**. Deeper sowing can hinder germination.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   When trained on trellises or pandals, the recommended spacing is:
        *   **Row to Row:** 2.0 to 3.0 meters
        *   **Plant to Plant:** 0.6 to 1.0 meter
    *   Typically, 2-3 seeds are sown per pit/hill, and after germination, thinned to one healthy seedling per spot.

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   The recommended seed rate for Snake Gourd is **1.0 to 1.5 kg per acre**.
