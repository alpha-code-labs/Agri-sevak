Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the critical role micronutrients play in the healthy growth, vibrant flowering, and overall vigor of roses. Deficiencies can significantly impact plant health and aesthetic appeal.

Addressing micronutrient deficiencies effectively requires a proper diagnosis, ideally through soil and leaf tissue analysis. However, based on common symptoms and general recommendations for Haryana, here's how to address the specified micronutrient deficiencies in roses:

**General Recommendation:** Always conduct a soil test to accurately determine the specific deficiencies and their severity before applying any micronutrients. Over-application can be detrimental.

### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Small, narrow, and distorted leaves (often called "little leaf"), interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, shortened internodes leading to a rosetted appearance of new growth.

**Correction:**
*   **Foliar Application:**
    *   Apply **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** at 2.5-5.0 g/L of water.
    *   Apply **Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate** at 1.5-2.5 g/L of water.
    *   Spray 2-3 times at 15-day intervals, preferably in the morning or late afternoon.
*   **Soil Application (for severe deficiency, based on soil test):**
    *   Apply **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** at 10-25 kg/acre, mixed with soil before planting or broadcast around established plants.

### 2. Iron (Fe) / Ferrous Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Pronounced interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on the youngest leaves, while the veins remain green. In severe cases, the entire leaf may turn pale yellow or even white, and growth can be stunted.

**Correction:**
*   **Foliar Application (most effective for quick correction):**
    *   Apply **Ferrous Sulphate** at 2.5-5.0 g/L of water.
    *   Apply **Iron EDTA** (Chelated Iron) at 1.0-2.0 g/L of water.
    *   Spray 2-3 times at 10-15 day intervals until symptoms disappear.
*   **Soil Application (for persistent issues, especially in alkaline soils):**
    *   Apply **Ferrous Sulphate** at 25-50 kg/acre, mixed into the soil.
    *   Apply **Iron EDTA** (Chelated Iron) at 5-10 kg/acre, mixed into the soil or applied as a drench.
    *   *Note: Iron availability is highly dependent on soil pH. Maintaining an optimal soil pH (6.0-6.5 for roses) is crucial.*

### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Stunted growth, thickened and brittle leaves, poor flower development (deformed or aborted buds), dieback of growing points, and cracking of stems.

**Correction:**
*   **Foliar Application (preferred due to narrow range between deficiency and toxicity):**
    *   Apply **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** at 1.0-1.5 g/L of water.
    *   Apply **Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate** (Borax) at 1.5-2.0 g/L of water.
    *   Spray 1-2 times during active growth, especially before flowering.
*   **Soil Application (only if severe deficiency confirmed by soil test):**
    *   Apply **Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate** (Borax) at 5-10 kg/acre, mixed thoroughly into the soil.
    *   *Caution: Boron has a very narrow range between deficiency and toxicity. Over-application can be highly damaging.*

### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Distorted and stunted new growth, tip burn on young leaves, poor root development, weak stems, and reduced flower quality. Flower petals may show necrosis (browning) or poor opening.

**Correction:**
*   **Foliar Application:**
    *   Apply **Calcium Nitrate** at 5.0-10.0 g/L of water.
    *   Apply **Calcium Chloride** at 2.5-5.0 g/L of water.
    *   Spray 2-3 times at 10-15 day intervals, especially during periods of rapid growth and flower development.
*   **Soil Application (for long-term correction and pH adjustment):**
    *   Apply **Gypsum** (Calcium Sulphate) at 200-500 kg/acre (depending on soil test and pH) to improve soil structure and provide calcium.
    *   Apply **Calcium Nitrate** at 50-100 kg/acre, mixed into the soil.

### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, starting from the leaf margins and progressing inwards, often with a reddish-purple tint. Leaves may become brittle and eventually drop prematurely.

**Correction:**
*   **Foliar Application (most effective for quick correction):**
    *   Apply **Magnesium Sulphate** (Epsom Salt) at 5.0-10.0 g/L of water.
    *   Spray 2-3 times at 10-15 day intervals until symptoms disappear.
*   **Soil Application (for long-term correction):**
    *   Apply **Magnesium Sulphate** at 25-50 kg/acre, mixed into the soil.
    *   Apply **Dolomite Lime** (Calcium Magnesium Carbonate) at 200-500 kg/acre (depending on soil test and pH) if soil pH also needs to be raised.

### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, similar to iron deficiency but often with a finer, net-like pattern of green veins against a yellow background. Growth may be stunted.

**Correction:**
*   **Foliar Application:**
    *   Apply **Manganese Sulphate** at 2.5-5.0 g/L of water.
    *   Spray 2-3 times at 15-day intervals until symptoms disappear.
*   **Soil Application (for severe deficiency, based on soil test):**
    *   Apply **Manganese Sulphate** at 10-25 kg/acre, mixed into the soil.
    *   *Note: Manganese availability is also influenced by soil pH. It becomes less available in alkaline soils.*

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Timing:** Foliar sprays are best applied in the early morning or late afternoon to avoid scorching and maximize absorption.
*   **Water Quality:** Use clean water for sprays.
*   **Adjuvants:** A non-ionic spreader/sticker can improve the efficacy of foliar sprays.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management:** Combine chemical corrections with organic matter addition (compost, well-rotted farmyard manure) to improve soil health and nutrient availability.
*   **Soil pH:** Regularly monitor and adjust soil pH as it significantly impacts the availability of all micronutrients.

Always follow the manufacturer's instructions on the product label for specific application rates and safety precautions. For precise recommendations tailored to your specific farm conditions in Haryana, I strongly advise consulting with the HAU extension services and conducting comprehensive soil and plant tissue analysis.
