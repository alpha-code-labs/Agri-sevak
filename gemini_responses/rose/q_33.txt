As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend a comprehensive approach to weed control in roses, prioritizing cultural methods and judicious use of CIBRC-approved herbicides where necessary. Roses are sensitive plants, so extreme caution must be exercised with chemical applications to prevent phytotoxicity.

### General Weed Management Principles for Roses:

1.  **Manual Weeding:** This is the safest and most effective method for roses, especially for removing established weeds and parasitic weeds like Amarbail. Regular hand weeding prevents weeds from setting seed and spreading.
2.  **Mulching:** Applying a 5-10 cm layer of organic mulch (e.g., straw, wood chips, compost) around rose plants can significantly suppress weed growth by blocking sunlight and reducing germination. It also helps conserve soil moisture and regulate soil temperature.
3.  **Proper Spacing:** Adequate spacing between rose plants allows for better air circulation and makes manual weeding easier.
4.  **Clean Planting Material:** Ensure that rose saplings and planting beds are free from weed seeds or vegetative propagules.

### Specific Weed Control Measures:

#### 1. Broadleaf Weeds (e.g., Bathu, Congress grass) and Narrowleaf Weeds (e.g., Phalaris minor)

**A. Pre-emergence Herbicides (Apply before weed emergence):**
These herbicides form a chemical barrier in the soil, preventing weed seeds from germinating. Apply to a clean, weed-free soil surface, ideally within 3 days of planting or transplanting roses, or before expected weed flush. Ensure adequate soil moisture for activation.

*   **Pendimethalin** (30% EC):
    *   Dosage: 1.0 - 1.5 kg a.i./acre (equivalent to 3.3 - 5.0 Litres of 30% EC formulation per acre).
    *   Application: Mix with sufficient water (e.g., 200-300 Litres/acre) and spray evenly over the soil surface.
*   **Oxyfluorfen** (23.5% EC):
    *   Dosage: 0.2 - 0.4 kg a.i./acre (equivalent to 1.0 - 2.0 Litres of 23.5% EC formulation per acre).
    *   Application: Mix with sufficient water (e.g., 200-300 Litres/acre) and spray evenly over the soil surface.

**B. Post-emergence Herbicides (Apply after weed emergence):**
For selective control of grass weeds in rose beds. For broadleaf weeds, manual removal is generally preferred due to the sensitivity of roses to most broadleaf selective herbicides.

*   **For Narrowleaf Weeds (Grasses like Phalaris minor):**
    *   **Quizalofop-ethyl** (5% EC):
        *   Dosage: 50 - 100 g a.i./acre (equivalent to 1.0 - 2.0 Litres of 5% EC formulation per acre).
        *   Application: Apply when grass weeds are at the 2-4 leaf stage. Use a directed spray to minimize contact with rose foliage.
    *   **Fenoxaprop-p-ethyl** (10% EC):
        *   Dosage: 50 - 60 g a.i./acre (equivalent to 0.5 - 0.6 Litres of 10% EC formulation per acre).
        *   Application: Apply when grass weeds are at the 2-4 leaf stage. Use a directed spray to minimize contact with rose foliage.

#### 2. Amarbail (Cuscuta spp.)

Amarbail is a parasitic weed that can severely damage roses. Control is challenging once it establishes.

*   **Manual Removal:** This is the most effective method. As soon as Amarbail strands are observed, carefully remove them by hand, ensuring all parts attached to the rose plant are detached and destroyed (preferably by burning) away from the rose bed.
*   **Pre-emergence:** **Pendimethalin** (as mentioned above) can offer some suppression of Amarbail seed germination if applied before its emergence.
*   **Post-emergence (Spot Application ONLY):** For severe infestations where manual removal is difficult, non-selective herbicides can be used as a highly directed spot spray *only on the Amarbail strands*, taking extreme care to avoid any contact with the rose plant. Use a spray shield or hood.
    *   **Paraquat dichloride** (24% SL):
        *   Dosage: 2 - 3 ml/L of water.
        *   Application: Apply as a directed spray only on Amarbail.
    *   **Glyphosate** (41% SL):
        *   Dosage: 10 - 15 ml/L of water.
        *   Application: Apply as a directed spray only on Amarbail.

#### 3. Orobanche (Broomrape)

This is not known to affect Rose.

### Important Precautions for Herbicide Application:

*   **Read the Label:** Always read and follow the instructions on the herbicide product label carefully.
*   **Phytotoxicity:** Roses are sensitive. Always test the herbicide on a small, inconspicuous area first to check for phytotoxicity before widespread application.
*   **Directed Spray:** When using post-emergence herbicides, especially non-selective ones, use a spray shield or hood to prevent drift onto rose foliage, stems, or flowers.
*   **Weather Conditions:** Apply herbicides on calm days to prevent drift. Avoid application during hot weather or when rain is expected shortly after.
*   **Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):** Always wear appropriate PPE (gloves, mask, protective clothing, eye protection) during mixing and application.
*   **Water Volume:** Ensure adequate water volume for uniform coverage, typically 200-300 Litres per acre for broadcast sprays.
*   **Nozzle Selection:** Use appropriate nozzles for herbicide application to ensure proper droplet size and coverage.

By combining these cultural and chemical methods, you can effectively manage weeds in your rose cultivation while minimizing risks to the plants.
