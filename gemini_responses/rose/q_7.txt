As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Dieback, Twig Blight, and Tikka disease in roses, specifically for conditions in Haryana.

It is crucial to maintain good plant hygiene and cultural practices to minimize disease incidence.

### Control of Dieback and Twig Blight in Rose

Dieback and Twig Blight are often caused by various fungal pathogens (e.g., *Botryosphaeria* spp., *Phomopsis* spp., *Diaporthe* spp., *Botrytis cinerea*) that infect plants through wounds, especially pruning cuts, or under stress conditions.

**Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   **Pruning:** Always prune infected branches well into healthy wood, making clean cuts. Discard or burn infected material away from the garden.
*   **Sanitation:** Sterilize pruning tools with a 10% bleach solution or rubbing alcohol between cuts and between plants to prevent disease spread.
*   **Wound Protection:** After pruning, especially larger cuts, apply a fungicidal paste or spray to protect the wound.
*   **Plant Vigor:** Ensure plants are well-nourished and watered appropriately to reduce stress, making them less susceptible to disease. Avoid waterlogging.
*   **Air Circulation:** Ensure adequate spacing between plants and prune for good air circulation to reduce humidity around foliage.

**Chemical Control (as per CIBRC approved technical names):**
For effective control, especially after pruning or at the first sign of symptoms, consider applying systemic or contact fungicides.

*   **For wound protection and early infection:**
    *   Spray with **Carbendazim** (50% WP) at 0.5-1 g/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, spray with **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2-2.5 g/L of water.
    *   For a protective barrier, especially after heavy pruning, **Copper Oxychloride** (50% WP) at 2.5-3 g/L of water can be used.
*   **For established infections or persistent issues:**
    *   Spray with **Propiconazole** (25% EC) at 0.5-1 ml/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, **Tebuconazole** (25.9% EC) at 0.75-1 ml/L of water can be effective.

Ensure thorough coverage of the affected parts. Repeat applications may be necessary as per product label instructions, typically at 7-14 day intervals, depending on disease severity and weather conditions.

### Control of Tikka Disease in Rose

This is not known to affect Rose.

*Explanation:* "Tikka disease" is a common name primarily associated with leaf spot diseases in groundnut (caused by *Cercospora arachidicola* and *Phaeoisariopsis personata*). Roses are susceptible to various leaf spot diseases, such as Black Spot (*Diplocarpon rosae*) or Cercospora Leaf Spot (*Cercospora rosicola*), but "Tikka disease" is not a standard, scientifically recognized disease name for roses.

If you are observing a leaf spot disease on your roses, it is likely one of the common rose leaf spots. For general leaf spot management in roses, the fungicides mentioned above for Dieback and Twig Blight (e.g., **Mancozeb**, **Propiconazole**, **Tebuconazole**) are often effective, along with good cultural practices like removing fallen infected leaves and ensuring good air circulation.
