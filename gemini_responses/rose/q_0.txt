As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in roses in Haryana.

**General Cultural Practices for Fungal Disease Management in Roses:**
Implementing good cultural practices is the first line of defense against fungal diseases.
*   **Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy all fallen leaves, pruned branches, and any visibly infected plant parts. This reduces the source of fungal inoculum.
*   **Air Circulation:** Ensure adequate spacing between rose plants and prune for an open canopy. This improves air movement, which helps dry foliage quickly and reduces humidity, making conditions less favorable for fungal growth.
*   **Watering:** Water at the base of the plant in the morning. This allows the foliage to dry completely before nightfall. Avoid overhead irrigation, especially in the evening, as wet leaves for prolonged periods promote fungal development.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where possible, choose rose varieties known for their resistance to common fungal diseases prevalent in your area.
*   **Nutrition:** Provide balanced nutrition. Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush, soft growth that is more susceptible to disease.

Here's how to control the specific fungal diseases you mentioned:

### 1. Alternaria (Leaf Spot)
*   **Affects Rose:** Yes, *Alternaria alternata* can cause leaf spots on roses.
*   **Symptoms:** Small, dark, circular spots with concentric rings, often surrounded by a yellow halo, primarily on older leaves.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Cultural:** Implement general sanitation practices. Ensure good air circulation and avoid overhead irrigation.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   Foliar spray with **Mancozeb** at 2-2.5 g/L water.
        *   Alternatively, use **Chlorothalonil** at 2-2.5 ml/L water.
        *   For systemic action, **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5-1 ml/L water can be effective.

### 2. Anthracnose
*   **Affects Rose:** Yes, *Colletotrichum* species can cause anthracnose on roses.
*   **Symptoms:** Irregular, sunken spots on leaves, stems, and petals, often with dark borders. Lesions may coalesce, leading to blighting.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Cultural:** Prune and destroy infected plant parts. Improve air circulation and reduce humidity around plants.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   Foliar spray with **Mancozeb** at 2-2.5 g/L water.
        *   Systemic options include **Carbendazim** at 0.5-1 g/L water or **Propiconazole** at 0.5-1 ml/L water.

### 3. Blast
*   **Affects Rose:** This is not known to affect Rose.

### 4. Blight (e.g., Botrytis Blight/Grey Mould)
*   **Affects Rose:** Yes, *Botrytis cinerea* (Grey Mould) is a common cause of blight in roses.
*   **Symptoms:** Brown, water-soaked spots on petals, often starting at the edges, leading to a fuzzy grey mould in humid conditions. Buds may fail to open and turn brown. Cankers can form on stems.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Cultural:** Promptly remove and destroy all dead or diseased flowers, buds, and leaves. Improve air circulation and reduce humidity. Avoid overhead watering.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   Foliar spray with **Carbendazim** at 0.5-1 g/L water.
        *   Alternatively, **Thiophanate methyl** at 1-1.5 g/L water.
        *   For broader spectrum control, **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5-1 ml/L water or **Pyraclostrobin** (often in combination products) at 0.5-1 ml/L water can be used.

### 5. Brown Spot
*   **Affects Rose:** Yes, various fungi can cause brown spot symptoms on roses, often as part of other leaf spot diseases.
*   **Symptoms:** Circular to irregular brown spots on leaves, which may enlarge and cause defoliation.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Cultural:** Follow general sanitation practices. Ensure good air circulation and avoid overhead irrigation.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   Foliar spray with **Mancozeb** at 2-2.5 g/L water.
        *   Alternatively, **Chlorothalonil** at 2-2.5 ml/L water.
        *   Systemic options like **Propiconazole** at 0.5-1 ml/L water or **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5-1 ml/L water are also effective.

### 6. Downy Mildew
*   **Affects Rose:** Yes, *Peronospora sparsa* is a significant pathogen of roses.
*   **Symptoms:** Irregular purple-red spots on upper leaf surfaces, often angular. A fuzzy, greyish-white growth may be visible on the underside of leaves, especially in humid conditions. Leaves may drop prematurely.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Cultural:** Ensure excellent air circulation. Avoid overhead irrigation and reduce leaf wetness duration. Remove and destroy infected leaves and plant parts immediately.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   Foliar spray with **Mancozeb** at 2-2.5 g/L water.
        *   Specific downy mildew fungicides like **Propamocarb hydrochloride** at 2-2.5 ml/L water.
        *   Systemic options include **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5-1 ml/L water or **Dimethomorph** (often in combination products) at 0.5-1 g/L water.

### 7. Powdery Mildew
*   **Affects Rose:** Yes, *Podosphaera pannosa* is a very common and important rose pathogen.
*   **Symptoms:** White, powdery patches on young leaves, stems, buds, and flowers. Infected leaves may curl, distort, and turn purplish. Buds may fail to open.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Cultural:** Choose resistant rose varieties if available. Ensure good air circulation. Prune out infected shoots and leaves. Avoid planting in overly shaded areas.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   Foliar spray with **Sulphur (wettable powder)** at 2-3 g/L water (avoid spraying in very hot weather).
        *   Systemic fungicides like **Myclobutanil** at 0.5-1 ml/L water.
        *   Alternatively, **Hexaconazole** at 0.5-1 ml/L water or **Propiconazole** at 0.5-1 ml/L water.
        *   **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5-1 ml/L water also provides control.

### 8. Grey Mildew
*   **Affects Rose:** This is not known to affect Rose. (Note: If referring to "Grey Mould," please see the "Blight" section above).

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the fungicide label for specific dosage, application timing, and safety precautions.
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of fungicide resistance.
*   Apply fungicides preventively or at the first sign of disease for best results.
*   Ensure thorough coverage of all plant surfaces, especially the undersides of leaves.
