As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the use of Growth Regulators/Hormones in Rose cultivation for Haryana:

It is crucial to understand the specific effects and recommended applications of each substance, as improper use can be detrimental to the crop.

*   **Ethephon**
    While **Ethephon** is a plant growth regulator, its use for beneficial growth regulation (e.g., promoting flowering, improving quality, or specific growth habits) in roses is not a standard or commonly recommended practice in general cultivation. It is primarily associated with inducing senescence, defoliation, or fruit ripening in other crops. Therefore, a general recommended dose for beneficial growth regulation in roses is not provided.

*   **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid**
    **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid** is a synthetic auxin that, at higher concentrations, acts as a broadleaf herbicide. Roses are broadleaf plants, and applying **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid** at any concentration typically used as a growth regulator in other crops (or even very low concentrations) is highly likely to cause severe phytotoxicity, deformities, and potentially kill the rose plant. It is strictly not recommended for use on roses as a growth regulator.

*   **Boron**
    Boron is an essential micronutrient vital for various physiological processes in roses, including cell wall formation, sugar transport, pollen tube growth, and hormone regulation. While not a hormone itself, its deficiency severely impacts growth and flowering.
    *   **Purpose:** To correct Boron deficiency or as a general micronutrient supplement to ensure healthy growth and flowering.
    *   **Recommended Dose (Foliar Application):**
        *   **Boric acid** (containing approximately 17.5% Boron): 1-2 g/L of water.
        *   **Disodium tetraborate decahydrate** (Borax, containing approximately 11.3% Boron): 1-2 g/L of water.
    *   **Application:** Spray evenly on the foliage, preferably in the morning or late afternoon, avoiding hot midday sun. Repeat every 15-30 days if deficiency symptoms persist or as part of a regular micronutrient program. Always ensure thorough mixing and uniform coverage.
