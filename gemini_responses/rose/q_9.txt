Mites, including Red spider mite (*Tetranychus urticae*) and various species of Rust mites, are common and significant pests of roses in Haryana. Effective control requires an integrated approach combining cultural practices and judicious use of CIBRC-approved acaricides.

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   **Water Spray:** Regularly spray the rose plants with a strong jet of water, especially on the undersides of leaves, to physically dislodge mites and their eggs. This also increases humidity, which mites generally dislike.
*   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy heavily infested leaves, shoots, or flowers to reduce the overall mite population and prevent further spread.
*   **Hygiene:** Keep the area around rose plants free of weeds and plant debris, as these can harbor mites and provide alternative hosts.
*   **Watering:** Ensure adequate and consistent watering to prevent plant stress, as stressed plants are often more susceptible to mite infestations.

**2. Chemical Control (Acaricides):**
When mite populations are high and cultural methods are insufficient, chemical control using CIBRC-approved acaricides is necessary. Always ensure thorough coverage, paying particular attention to the undersides of leaves where mites predominantly reside. To prevent the development of resistance, it is crucial to rotate between acaricides with different modes of action.

*   **Spiromesifen** (240 SC formulation): Apply at a concentration of 0.5-1.0 ml per litre of water.
*   **Fenpyroximate** (5 SC formulation): Apply at a concentration of 0.5-1.0 ml per litre of water.
*   **Propargite** (57 EC formulation): Apply at a concentration of 1.0-1.5 ml per litre of water.
*   **Hexythiazox** (5.45 EC formulation): Apply at a concentration of 0.5-0.75 ml per litre of water. This acaricide is particularly effective against mite eggs and nymphs.
*   **Abamectin** (1.9 EC formulation): Apply at a concentration of 0.5 ml per litre of water.
*   **Wettable Sulphur** (80 WP formulation): Apply at a concentration of 2-3 g per litre of water. Exercise caution when applying sulphur during hot weather (above 30°C) as it can cause phytotoxicity (leaf burn).
*   **Dicofol** (18.5 EC formulation): Apply at a concentration of 1.5-2.0 ml per litre of water.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Rotation:** To effectively manage resistance, always rotate between different classes of acaricides. Avoid using the same chemical repeatedly for consecutive applications.
*   **Timing:** Apply acaricides as soon as mite populations are observed to be building up, rather than waiting for severe infestations. Repeat applications may be necessary based on product label instructions and the level of pest pressure.
*   **Application Technique:** Ensure complete and uniform coverage of the plant, especially the undersides of leaves, for optimal efficacy.
*   **Safety:** Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the product label, including recommended dosage, safety precautions, and the use of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and application.
