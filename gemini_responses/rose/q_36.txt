As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I must clarify that roses are primarily cultivated for their beautiful flowers, not for edible fruits. The reproductive structure that develops from the rose flower is botanically a "hip," which contains seeds and is generally not harvested for "fruit quality" or "storage life" in commercial rose cultivation.

Therefore, I will address your question in terms of improving **Flower Yield**, **Flower Quality**, and **Vase Life** (which is the equivalent of storage life for cut flowers).

### Improving Flower Yield and Quality for Rose

To enhance both the quantity and quality of rose flowers, a holistic approach encompassing proper agronomic practices, nutrition, and pest/disease management is crucial.

1.  **Variety Selection:**
    *   Choose high-yielding, disease-resistant varieties well-suited to the agro-climatic conditions of Haryana. Consult local nurseries or HAU recommendations for suitable cultivars (e.g., 'First Red', 'Grand Gala', 'Taj Mahal' for cut flowers; 'Pusa Mohit', 'Pusa Abhishek' for garden roses).

2.  **Soil and Climate:**
    *   **Soil:** Roses thrive in well-drained, fertile, deep loamy soils with a pH range of 6.0-7.0. Ensure good organic matter content.
    *   **Climate:** Full sun exposure (at least 6 hours daily) is essential for abundant flowering.

3.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Soil Testing:** Always begin with a soil test to determine specific nutrient deficiencies.
    *   **Organic Manures:** Incorporate 10-15 kg of well-decomposed Farmyard Manure (FYM) or 2-3 kg of vermicompost per plant annually during soil preparation or pruning.
    *   **Inorganic Fertilizers:** Apply balanced NPK fertilizers based on soil test recommendations. A general recommendation for established plants (per plant per year) could be:
        *   **Nitrogen (N):** 100-150 g (e.g., from **Urea**)
        *   **Phosphorus (P2O5):** 50-75 g (e.g., from **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)**)
        *   **Potassium (K2O):** 75-100 g (e.g., from **Muriate of Potash (MOP)**)
        *   Apply N in split doses (e.g., after pruning and during peak growth). P and K can be applied once or twice a year.
    *   **Micronutrients:** Deficiencies can severely impact flower quality. Foliar sprays are effective for quick correction.
        *   **Zinc:** Apply **Zinc Sulphate** (21% Zn) at 0.5 g/L as a foliar spray.
        *   **Boron:** Apply **Borax** (10.5% B) at 0.5 g/L as a foliar spray.
        *   **Iron:** Apply **Ferrous Sulphate** (19% Fe) at 0.5 g/L as a foliar spray if chlorosis is observed.
        *   **Manganese:** Apply **Manganese Sulphate** (30.5% Mn) at 0.5 g/L as a foliar spray.

4.  **Water Management:**
    *   Roses require consistent moisture, especially during flowering. Drip irrigation is highly recommended for efficient water use and to prevent foliar diseases.
    *   Avoid overhead irrigation late in the day to reduce fungal disease incidence.

5.  **Pruning and Training:**
    *   **Annual Pruning:** Essential for plant vigor, shape, and continuous flowering. Perform heavy pruning in October-November in Haryana.
    *   **Disbudding:** For larger, high-quality individual flowers (especially for cut flowers), remove side buds, allowing the terminal bud to develop fully.

6.  **Pest Management:**
    *   Regular scouting is vital. Use Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategies.
    *   **Aphids and Thrips:**
        *   **Imidacloprid** (17.8% SL) at 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Thiamethoxam** (25% WG) at 0.2 g/L of water.
    *   **Mites (Red Spider Mites):**
        *   **Spiromesifen** (22.9% SC) at 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Propargite** (57% EC) at 1.5 ml/L of water.

7.  **Disease Management:**
    *   Good air circulation, proper spacing, and sanitation help prevent diseases.
    *   **Black Spot and Powdery Mildew:**
        *   **Myclobutanil** (10% WP) at 0.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Hexaconazole** (5% SC) at 1 ml/L of water.
        *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC) at 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2 g/L of water (for preventive and early stage control).

### Improving Vase Life of Cut Rose Flowers

The vase life of cut roses is crucial for marketability and consumer satisfaction.

1.  **Harvesting Stage:**
    *   Harvest flowers at the correct stage: when the sepals are reflexed, and 1-2 petals have started to unfurl, showing color. Harvesting too early or too late reduces vase life.
    *   Harvest in the early morning or late evening when temperatures are cooler and turgidity is high.

2.  **Immediate Post-Harvest Handling:**
    *   **Hydration:** Immediately after cutting, place stems in clean buckets containing fresh water or a pre-cooling solution.
    *   **Removal of Lower Leaves:** Remove all leaves that would fall below the water line in the vase to prevent microbial growth.
    *   **Re-cutting Stems:** Re-cut stems under water (or immediately after cutting) by 2-3 cm to remove air embolisms and improve water uptake.

3.  **Pre-cooling:**
    *   Rapidly cool harvested flowers to 2-4°C to reduce respiration and metabolic activity. This significantly extends vase life.

4.  **Holding Solutions (Floral Preservatives):**
    *   Use commercial floral preservative solutions or prepare a simple solution to provide nutrients, acidify the water, and inhibit microbial growth.
    *   **Components of a Holding Solution:**
        *   **Carbohydrate Source:** Provides energy to the flower.
            *   **Sucrose** (20-30 g/L of water).
        *   **Acidifier:** Lowers water pH (3.0-4.0) to improve water uptake and inhibit bacterial growth.
            *   **Citric Acid** (0.1-0.2 g/L of water).
        *   **Biocide:** Inhibits the growth of bacteria and fungi that can block water-conducting vessels.
            *   **8-hydroxyquinoline citrate** (200-300 mg/L of water) is a common biocide used in floral preservatives.

5.  **Storage Conditions:**
    *   Store cut flowers in a cool room (2-4°C) with high humidity (90-95%) until transport.
    *   Avoid storing flowers near ripening fruits or vegetables, as ethylene gas released by them can accelerate flower senescence.
