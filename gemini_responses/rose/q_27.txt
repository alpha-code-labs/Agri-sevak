Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with the scientifically verified requirements for growing roses successfully in our region.

Roses are beautiful and rewarding plants, but their optimal growth and flowering depend significantly on suitable environmental conditions.

### Suitable Climate for Rose

Roses thrive in a wide range of climates, but for optimal growth and abundant flowering, specific conditions are preferred:

*   **Temperature:** Roses generally prefer a temperate climate.
    *   **Day Temperature:** An ideal range is 20-28°C.
    *   **Night Temperature:** An ideal range is 15-20°C.
    *   While roses can tolerate the hot summers of Haryana, extreme heat (above 35°C) can reduce flower size and quantity, and may cause stress. Adequate watering and mulching are crucial during such periods. They also benefit from a cool period (Haryana winters) for better dormancy and subsequent flowering.
*   **Sunlight:** Roses are sun-loving plants and require a minimum of 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily for vigorous growth and prolific blooming. Less sunlight leads to leggy growth, fewer flowers, and increased susceptibility to diseases.
*   **Humidity:** Moderate humidity is generally preferred. Very high humidity can increase the incidence of fungal diseases, while very low humidity can lead to stress and pest issues like spider mites.

### Suitable Soil Type for Rose

The right soil is fundamental for healthy rose bushes.

*   **Texture:** Roses prefer a well-drained, fertile loamy soil. A good loam provides a balanced mix of sand, silt, and clay, offering both good water retention and aeration.
    *   Heavy clay soils can lead to waterlogging and poor root development.
    *   Very sandy soils drain too quickly, leading to nutrient leaching and requiring frequent irrigation.
*   **pH:** The ideal soil pH for roses is slightly acidic to neutral, typically ranging from 6.0 to 7.0. In Haryana, some soils can be alkaline, which may require amendments like gypsum or organic matter to adjust the pH for optimal nutrient availability.
*   **Organic Matter:** Soil rich in organic matter is crucial. Organic matter improves soil structure, enhances water-holding capacity, increases nutrient availability, and supports beneficial microbial activity. Incorporating well-rotted farmyard manure (FYM) or compost at least 2-3 weeks before planting is highly recommended.

### Drainage Requirement for Rose

Excellent drainage is paramount for rose cultivation.

*   **Prevention of Waterlogging:** Roses are highly susceptible to root rot if their roots remain waterlogged for extended periods. The soil must allow excess water to drain away freely and quickly.
*   **Methods to Ensure Good Drainage:**
    *   **Site Selection:** Choose a planting location that does not accumulate standing water after rainfall or irrigation. Avoid low-lying areas.
    *   **Soil Amendment:** For heavy clay soils, incorporate significant amounts of coarse sand, gypsum, and especially well-decomposed organic matter (FYM, compost) to improve soil structure and permeability.
    *   **Raised Beds:** In areas with naturally poor drainage or heavy clay soils, planting roses in raised beds (at least 30-45 cm high) filled with a suitable, well-draining soil mix is an excellent and often necessary solution.
    *   **Proper Watering:** While consistent moisture is needed, avoid overwatering. Allow the topsoil to dry slightly between waterings to prevent waterlogging around the root zone.

By ensuring these climate, soil, and drainage requirements are met, you can cultivate healthy and beautiful roses in Haryana.
