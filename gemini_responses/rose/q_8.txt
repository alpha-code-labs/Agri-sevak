Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding sucking pests in your rose garden. These pests can significantly reduce the vigour and aesthetic value of your roses. Here's a scientifically verified approach to control Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, Thrips, and Psylla in roses, keeping in mind the conditions in Haryana.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Approach for Sucking Pests in Rose:**

A holistic approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods is most effective and sustainable.

**I. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**

*   **Regular Monitoring:** Inspect your rose plants frequently, especially the new shoots, buds, and undersides of leaves, for early signs of pest infestation. Early detection is key to effective control.
*   **Pruning Infested Parts:** Immediately prune and destroy heavily infested shoots, leaves, or buds to reduce pest populations.
*   **Water Spray:** For mild aphid infestations, a strong jet of water can dislodge them from the plants.
*   **Weed Management:** Keep the area around rose plants free of weeds, as many weeds can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
*   **Proper Nutrition and Watering:** Maintain healthy plant vigour through balanced fertilization and adequate watering. Stressed plants are more susceptible to pest attacks.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate spacing between plants for good air circulation, which can deter some pests and diseases.

**II. Biological Control:**

*   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Encourage beneficial insects like ladybird beetles, lacewings, hoverflies, and parasitic wasps. These natural predators and parasitoids feed on aphids, whiteflies, and thrips. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.
*   **Biopesticides:** In cases of moderate infestation, consider using biopesticides like:
    *   **_Beauveria bassiana_** (fungal formulation): Apply as a foliar spray at recommended doses (e.g., 2-5 g/L of water) during evening hours.
    *   **_Verticillium lecanii_** (fungal formulation): Effective against whiteflies and aphids, apply as a foliar spray (e.g., 2-5 g/L of water).

**III. Chemical Control (Use as a last resort, following IPM principles):**

When cultural and biological methods are insufficient, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves.

**For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, Thrips, and Psylla:**

The following CIBRC-approved technical chemical names are effective against these sucking pests. Psylla, though less common on roses, will also be controlled by these insecticides if present.

*   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:**
    *   Dosage: 0.5 - 1.0 ml per litre of water.
    *   Effective against: Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, Thrips.
*   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:**
    *   Dosage: 0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water.
    *   Effective against: Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, Thrips.
*   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:**
    *   Dosage: 0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water.
    *   Effective against: Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, Thrips.
*   **Buprofezin 25% SC:**
    *   Dosage: 1.25 - 1.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   Primarily effective against: Whitefly nymphs and pupae. Less effective on adults or other pests. Good for resistance management when whiteflies are dominant.
*   **Diafenthiuron 50% WP:**
    *   Dosage: 1.0 - 1.25 g per litre of water.
    *   Effective against: Whiteflies, Thrips, and also has acaricidal (mite) properties.
*   **Fipronil 5% SC:**
    *   Dosage: 1.5 - 2.0 ml per litre of water.
    *   Effective against: Thrips, Aphids, Leafhoppers.
*   **Flonicamid 50% WG:**
    *   Dosage: 0.3 - 0.4 g per litre of water.
    *   Effective against: Aphids and Whiteflies (acts as a feeding blocker).

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Spray Volume:** Ensure adequate spray volume to achieve thorough coverage. For roses, typically 200-250 litres of spray solution per acre is sufficient, depending on plant size and density.
*   **Timing of Application:** Apply insecticides during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   **Safety Precautions:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (gloves, mask, protective clothing) while handling and applying pesticides. Follow the instructions on the product label strictly.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate insecticides with different modes of action. Do not use the same chemical repeatedly. For example, if you use Imidacloprid in one spray, use Buprofezin or Diafenthiuron for the next spray if needed.
*   **Product Label:** Always refer to the specific product label for the most accurate and up-to-date dosage rates, application instructions, and safety precautions, as formulations can vary. Ensure the product is approved for use on roses in India.

By implementing these strategies, you can effectively manage sucking pests in your rose garden and ensure healthy, beautiful blooms. For any further specific queries, feel free to consult with our experts at HAU.
