As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified fertilizer doses for Rose cultivation in Haryana. Please note that these are general recommendations, and a soil test is highly advisable to determine the precise nutrient requirements of your specific soil and optimize fertilizer application.

**General NPK Recommendation for Established Rose Plants (Annual Dose, to be split into multiple applications):**
For optimal growth and flowering, an established rose plant typically requires:
*   **Nitrogen (N):** 60-100 grams per plant per year
*   **Phosphorus (P2O5):** 40-60 grams per plant per year
*   **Potassium (K2O):** 40-60 grams per plant per year

These annual doses should be split into 3-4 applications throughout the active growing season, especially after pruning and before major flowering flushes.

Here are the recommended doses for specific fertilizers:

*   **Urea (46% N)**
    *   **Granular Application:** 130-220 grams per plant per year, split into 3-4 applications (e.g., 30-55 grams per plant per application). Apply around the base of the plant, away from the stem, and irrigate immediately.
    *   For commercial cultivation: 150-200 kg/acre per year, split into multiple top-dressings.

*   **Nano-Urea (Liquid, 4% N)**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** 2-4 ml per litre of water.
    *   Apply 2-3 sprays during the active vegetative growth phase, at 15-20 day intervals. Ensure thorough coverage of foliage.

*   **DAP (Di-Ammonium Phosphate, 18% N, 46% P2O5)**
    *   **Granular Application:** 90-130 grams per plant per year. This can be applied as a basal dose during planting or in 1-2 applications during the early growth phase.
    *   For commercial cultivation: 100-150 kg/acre per year, applied as a basal dose or in split applications.

*   **Nano-DAP (Liquid, 8% N, 16% P2O5)**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** 2-4 ml per litre of water.
    *   Apply 2-3 sprays, especially before flowering and during fruit set (if applicable for rose hips, though primarily for flower production).

*   **NPK (Complex Fertilizers)**
    *   **Granular Complex Fertilizers (e.g., 12:32:16, 10:26:26):**
        *   Apply 100-150 grams per plant per year as a basal dose or in 1-2 applications. Adjust based on the specific NPK grade and soil test results.
        *   For commercial cultivation: 150-250 kg/acre per year, applied as a basal dose.
    *   **Water-Soluble NPK (e.g., 19:19:19, 20:20:20):**
        *   **Foliar Spray:** 5 grams per litre of water. Apply 2-3 sprays during active growth and flowering.
        *   **Fertigation:** 1-2 kg per acre, applied weekly or bi-weekly through drip irrigation.

*   **SSP (Single Super Phosphate, 16% P2O5, 11% S, 19% Ca)**
    *   **Granular Application:** If used as the primary source of Phosphorus instead of DAP, apply 250-375 grams per plant per year as a basal dose.
    *   For commercial cultivation: 300-400 kg/acre per year, applied as a basal dose. SSP also provides Sulphur and Calcium.

*   **Potash (Muriate of Potash - MOP, 60% K2O)**
    *   **Granular Application:** 70-100 grams per plant per year, split into 2-3 applications (e.g., 25-35 grams per plant per application). Apply during active growth and before flowering.
    *   For commercial cultivation: 80-120 kg/acre per year, split into multiple applications.

*   **Sulphur (Elemental Sulphur 90% WDG or Bentonite Sulphur)**
    *   **Granular Application:** 10-20 grams of **Elemental Sulphur (90% WDG)** per plant per year. Apply annually as a basal dose.
    *   For commercial cultivation: 15-25 kg/acre per year, applied annually.
    *   Note: If **SSP** is used, it contributes significantly to Sulphur requirements, so additional Sulphur may be reduced or not needed.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Soil Testing:** Always conduct a soil test to get precise recommendations tailored to your soil's nutrient status.
*   **Organic Matter:** Supplement chemical fertilizers with well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost (5-10 kg per plant annually) to improve soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability.
*   **Split Applications:** For granular fertilizers, splitting the annual dose into multiple applications (3-4 times a year) ensures a continuous supply of nutrients and minimizes leaching losses.
*   **Irrigation:** Always irrigate thoroughly after applying granular fertilizers to help dissolve them and move nutrients into the root zone.
*   **Foliar Sprays:** Foliar applications of Nano-Urea, Nano-DAP, or water-soluble NPK are supplementary and should not replace soil-applied fertilizers entirely. They are effective for quick nutrient uptake and correcting deficiencies.
