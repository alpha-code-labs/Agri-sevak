Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm that Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies are common pests that can significantly damage rose plants in our region. Effective management requires an integrated approach.

Here's a scientifically verified approach to control these pests in roses:

**I. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Principles:**

1.  **Regular Monitoring:** Inspect your rose plants frequently (at least twice a week) for signs of pest activity, such as chewed leaves, holes in petals, skeletonized foliage, or the presence of the pests themselves. Early detection is key.
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Hand-picking:** For smaller infestations, larger beetles, weevils, and sawfly larvae can be hand-picked and dropped into a bucket of soapy water. This is most effective in the early morning or late evening when pests are less active.
    *   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy any infested leaves, buds, or canes (especially for stem sawflies) to prevent further spread.
    *   **Sanitation:** Keep the area around rose plants clean by removing fallen leaves, debris, and weeds, which can serve as overwintering sites for some pests.
    *   **Water Spray:** A strong jet of water can dislodge some sawfly larvae and smaller beetles from the foliage.
3.  **Biological Control:** Encourage natural enemies like parasitic wasps, predatory beetles (e.g., ladybugs), and birds, which can help keep pest populations in check. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides if natural enemies are present.

**II. Chemical Control (When infestation is severe and other methods are insufficient):**

When pest populations are high and causing significant damage, judicious use of CIBRC-approved insecticides may be necessary. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions on the product label for dosage, application method, and safety precautions.

Here are some CIBRC-approved technical chemical names effective against Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies, along with typical dosages for foliar spray:

*   **For Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies (Chewing Pests):**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** Apply at 0.15 - 0.2 ml/L of water. This is highly effective against a wide range of chewing pests, including many beetles and sawflies.
    *   **Fipronil 5% SC:** Apply at 1.0 - 1.5 ml/L of water. It provides both contact and systemic action, effective against various beetles and other chewing insects.
    *   **Spinosad 45% SC:** Apply at 0.25 - 0.3 ml/L of water. This is a naturalyte insecticide, effective against sawflies and some beetles, and generally considered safer for beneficial insects than broad-spectrum options.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** Apply at 0.5 - 1.0 ml/L of water. A synthetic pyrethroid that provides quick knockdown against a broad spectrum of pests, including beetles and sawflies.
    *   **Cypermethrin 25% EC:** Apply at 0.5 - 1.0 ml/L of water. Another synthetic pyrethroid with broad-spectrum activity against chewing pests.
    *   **Quinalphos 25% EC:** Apply at 1.5 - 2.0 ml/L of water. An organophosphate insecticide effective against various chewing and sucking pests.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Rotation of Chemicals:** To prevent the development of pesticide resistance, rotate insecticides with different modes of action. Do not use the same chemical repeatedly.
*   **Timing of Application:** Apply insecticides in the early morning or late evening to minimize harm to pollinators and beneficial insects, and to avoid high temperatures.
*   **Safety Precautions:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, and protective clothing while handling and spraying chemicals.
*   **Read the Label:** Always refer to the specific product label for detailed instructions, precautions, and the latest recommendations for your region.
*   **Local Guidance:** For specific recommendations tailored to your exact situation and current pest pressure, it is always advisable to consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts.

By implementing these strategies, you can effectively manage beetles, weevils, and sawflies and maintain healthy rose plants.
