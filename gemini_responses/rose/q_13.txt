Fruit flies (Tephritidae family) are primarily pests of various fruit crops (e.g., mango, guava, citrus, peach, ber, tomato, brinjal) where they lay eggs in the developing fruit, causing damage. Roses are cultivated for their flowers, and fruit flies are not considered a significant pest of rose flowers or hips.

Ber fly (*Carpomyia vesuviana*) is a highly host-specific pest, primarily infesting Ber (*Ziziphus mauritiana*) fruits. It is not known to infest roses.
