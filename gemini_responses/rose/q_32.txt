Drying up (drying branches, leaves, fruits, and flowers) in roses is a symptom, not a single disease, and can be caused by a variety of biotic (living organisms) and abiotic (environmental) factors. A careful observation of the plant and its environment is crucial for accurate diagnosis.

Here's a comprehensive approach to address "Drying up" in roses, considering conditions prevalent in Haryana:

**I. Abiotic Factors (Non-Living Causes):**

These are often the primary culprits and should be ruled out first.

1.  **Water Stress (Under-watering or Over-watering):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Leaves wilt, turn yellow or brown, become crispy, and eventually dry up. Under-watering leads to overall plant dehydration, while over-watering causes root rot, preventing water uptake, leading to similar symptoms.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Ensure consistent and adequate watering, especially during hot and dry periods. Water deeply to encourage deep root growth.
        *   Check soil moisture before watering; the top 2-3 inches should feel dry.
        *   Ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging and root rot. Amend heavy clay soils with organic matter.

2.  **Heat Stress and Sunburn:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Leaves may scorch, turn brown, especially at the edges, and dry out. Flowers may shrivel prematurely.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Provide partial shade during the hottest part of the day, especially for sensitive varieties.
        *   Apply a thick layer of organic mulch (e.g., straw, wood chips) around the base of the plant to keep the soil cool and retain moisture.
        *   Ensure adequate watering to help plants cope with heat.

3.  **Nutrient Deficiencies:**
    *   **Symptoms:** General poor growth, yellowing of leaves (chlorosis), stunted development, which can lead to premature drying. Specific deficiencies show distinct patterns (e.g., interveinal chlorosis for iron, overall yellowing for nitrogen).
    *   **Management:**
        *   Conduct a soil test to determine specific nutrient requirements.
        *   Apply a balanced rose fertilizer (e.g., NPK 8:12:16 or similar) as per recommendations.
        *   Supplement with micronutrients if soil tests indicate deficiencies.

4.  **Soil Salinity:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, leaf tip burn, marginal necrosis (browning of leaf edges), wilting, and eventual drying of leaves.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Improve soil drainage.
        *   Leach salts by applying large volumes of good quality water.
        *   Incorporate organic matter and gypsum (Calcium sulphate) to improve soil structure and reduce sodium effects.

5.  **Chemical Damage (Herbicide Drift, Incorrect Pesticide Use):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Distorted growth, yellowing, browning, and drying of leaves, often with a distinct pattern depending on the chemical.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Exercise extreme caution when using herbicides near roses.
        *   Always follow label instructions for pesticides regarding dosage and application method.

**II. Biotic Factors (Living Organism Causes):**

These include diseases and pests.

1.  **Fungal Diseases:**

    *   **Dieback and Canker (e.g., *Botryosphaeria*, *Coniothyrium* spp.):**
        *   **Symptoms:** Branches turn brown or black, starting from the tip and progressing downwards. Cankers (sunken, discolored lesions) may appear on stems, girdling them and causing the part above to dry and die.
        *   **Management:**
            *   Prune out affected branches well into healthy wood (at least 15-20 cm below the visible canker).
            *   Sterilize pruning tools with a 10% bleach solution or rubbing alcohol between cuts.
            *   Ensure good air circulation and avoid wounding the plant.
            *   **Chemical Control (Preventive/Early Stage):**
                *   **Carbendazim** (50% WP) @ 1 g/L of water.
                *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP) @ 2.5 g/L of water.

    *   **Verticillium Wilt (*Verticillium dahliae*):**
        *   **Symptoms:** Sudden wilting and yellowing of leaves on one side of the plant or individual branches, followed by browning and drying. Vascular tissue may show brown streaks when cut.
        *   **Management:**
            *   No effective chemical cure once established.
            *   Remove and destroy severely infected plants.
            *   Avoid planting roses in soil previously affected by Verticillium wilt.
            *   Solarization of soil can help reduce pathogen load.

    *   **Powdery Mildew (*Podosphaera pannosa*):**
        *   **Symptoms:** White, powdery growth on leaves, stems, and flower buds. Severe infection can cause leaves to curl, distort, turn purplish, and eventually dry out and drop.
        *   **Management:**
            *   Improve air circulation by proper spacing and pruning.
            *   Avoid overhead irrigation late in the day.
            *   **Chemical Control:**
                *   **Myclobutanil** (10% WP) @ 0.5 g/L of water.
                *   **Hexaconazole** (5% SC) @ 1 ml/L of water.
                *   **Sulphur** (80% WP) @ 2 g/L of water (avoid application during very hot weather).

    *   **Downy Mildew (*Peronospora sparsa*):**
        *   **Symptoms:** Irregular purplish-red spots on the upper leaf surface, often with grayish, fuzzy growth on the underside. Rapid defoliation, stem dieback, and drying of affected parts can occur.
        *   **Management:**
            *   Improve air circulation.
            *   Avoid overhead irrigation.
            *   **Chemical Control:**
                *   **Propineb** (70% WP) @ 2.5 g/L of water.
                *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP) @ 2.5 g/L of water.
                *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC) @ 0.5 ml/L of water.

2.  **Bacterial Diseases:**

    *   **Crown Gall (*Agrobacterium tumefaciens*):**
        *   **Symptoms:** Galls (tumor-like growths) on roots, crown, or lower stems. While not directly causing drying, these galls disrupt water and nutrient flow, severely weakening the plant and making it susceptible to other stresses, leading to wilting and drying.
        *   **Management:**
            *   No chemical cure.
            *   Remove and destroy infected plants.
            *   Use disease-free planting material.
            *   Avoid wounding roots and stems during planting and cultivation.

3.  **Insect Pests:**

    *   **Spider Mites (*Tetranychus urticae*):**
        *   **Symptoms:** Fine stippling (tiny dots) on leaves, bronzing, yellowing, and eventually drying and dropping of leaves. Fine webbing may be visible on the undersides of leaves in severe infestations.
        *   **Management:**
            *   Strong jet of water to dislodge mites.
            *   Maintain good plant hygiene.
            *   **Chemical Control (Acaricides):**
                *   **Spiromesifen** (22.9% SC) @ 0.5 ml/L of water.
                *   **Fenpyroximate** (5% SC) @ 1 ml/L of water.
                *   **Propargite** (57% EC) @ 1.5 ml/L of water.

    *   **Thrips (*Scirtothrips dorsalis*, *Frankliniella occidentalis*):**
        *   **Symptoms:** Silvery streaks on leaves, distorted new growth, flower buds failing to open or showing browning/drying of petals. Severe feeding can cause leaves and flowers to dry out.
        *   **Management:**
            *   Use blue sticky traps for monitoring and mass trapping.
            *   Remove and destroy infested flowers and buds.
            *   **Chemical Control:**
                *   **Imidacloprid** (17.8% SL) @ 0.5 ml/L of water.
                *   **Fipronil** (5% SC) @ 1.5 ml/L of water.
                *   **Spinosad** (45% SC) @ 0.25 ml/L of water.

    *   **Stem Borers (e.g., *Oberea linearis*):**
        *   **Symptoms:** Wilting and drying of individual branches, often with a small entry hole and frass (sawdust-like material).
        *   **Management:**
            *   Prune affected branches well below the damaged area and destroy them.
            *   Insert a thin wire into the bore hole to kill the larva.
            *   Maintain plant vigor to help resist attacks.

**General Cultural Practices for Healthy Roses:**

*   **Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy fallen leaves, diseased branches, and plant debris to reduce pathogen inoculum.
*   **Pruning:** Prune annually to remove dead, diseased, or weak wood, and to improve air circulation.
*   **Spacing:** Ensure adequate spacing between plants to promote air circulation and reduce humidity.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide regular, balanced fertilization based on soil tests.
*   **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect plants for early signs of stress, pests, or diseases.

**Recommendation:**

Start by thoroughly inspecting your rose plants for specific symptoms. Check the soil moisture, look for any visible pests or disease signs on leaves, stems, and flowers. Based on your observations, you can narrow down the potential causes and apply the appropriate management strategies. If unsure, collect a sample of the affected plant part and consult with the plant pathology or entomology experts at HAU, Hisar, or your local Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) for precise diagnosis and recommendations.
