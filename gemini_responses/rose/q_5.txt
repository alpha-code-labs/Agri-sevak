As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned conditions in roses, keeping in mind the agro-climatic conditions of Haryana and CIBRC approved chemicals.

### 1. Scab in Rose

Rose scab, caused by the fungus *Sphaceloma rosarum*, manifests as small, dark, raised spots on leaves, stems, and sometimes flowers, leading to leaf yellowing and premature defoliation.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Remove and destroy all infected plant parts, including fallen leaves, to reduce inoculum.
    *   Ensure good air circulation around plants by proper spacing and pruning.
    *   Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day, to minimize leaf wetness.
*   **Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
    *   Apply fungicides preventively during periods conducive to disease development (e.g., high humidity, moderate temperatures).
    *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP): 2.0-2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Chlorothalonil** (75% WP): 2.0 g/L of water.
    *   **Myclobutanil** (10% WP/EC): 0.5-0.75 g or ml/L of water.
    *   **Propiconazole** (25% EC): 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Difenoconazole** (25% EC): 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

### 2. Canker in Rose

Rose canker is caused by various fungi (e.g., *Leptosphaeria coniothyrium*, *Botryosphaeria dothidea*) that enter through wounds, leading to sunken, discolored lesions on stems, often resulting in dieback.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Prune out infected canes immediately, cutting well below the cankered area into healthy wood.
    *   Sterilize pruning tools with a 10% bleach solution or rubbing alcohol between cuts and between plants to prevent disease spread.
    *   Make clean cuts when pruning and avoid leaving stubs.
    *   Protect plants from physical injuries.
    *   Ensure proper plant nutrition and watering to maintain plant vigor.
*   **Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
    *   Fungicides are primarily used as protectants for fresh wounds or as a general preventative measure.
    *   After pruning, especially for canker removal, apply a protective fungicide to the fresh cuts.
    *   **Copper Oxychloride** (50% WP): 2.0-3.0 g/L of water (as a spray or paste for wounds).
    *   **Carbendazim** (50% WP): 1.0 g/L of water (as a spray, especially after pruning).
    *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP): 2.0-2.5 g/L of water (as a general protective spray).
