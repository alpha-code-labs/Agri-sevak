Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU), Hisar, I can provide you with scientifically verified advice on addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium) in Rose cultivation in Haryana.

It is crucial to conduct a soil test to accurately determine the specific nutrient levels in your soil and tailor the fertilization program accordingly. However, based on visual symptoms, here's how to address common macro-nutrient deficiencies:

### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

**Symptoms in Rose:**
*   General yellowing (chlorosis) of older leaves, starting from the tips and margins, progressing inwards.
*   Stunted growth and reduced vigor.
*   Pale green foliage overall.
*   Smaller flowers and fewer blooms.

**Correction:**
*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Urea** (46% N) at 10-15 kg/acre, split into 2-3 applications during the active growth phase. Ensure even distribution around the root zone and light irrigation afterwards.
*   **Foliar Spray (for quick relief):**
    *   Spray **Urea** at a concentration of 2-3 g/L of water. Apply early morning or late evening to avoid leaf burn. Repeat every 10-15 days if the deficiency is severe.

### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

**Symptoms in Rose:**
*   Stunted plant growth with dark green or purplish discoloration, especially on older leaves.
*   Leaves may appear dull and stiff.
*   Poor root development.
*   Reduced flowering and poor flower quality.
*   Delayed maturity.

**Correction:**
*   **Soil Application (Phosphorus is less mobile in soil, so soil application is most effective):**
    *   Apply **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5) at 20-25 kg/acre as a basal application or top-dressing, incorporating it into the soil.
    *   Alternatively, apply **Single Superphosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5) at 50-60 kg/acre as a basal application, incorporating it into the soil.

### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency

**Symptoms in Rose:**
*   Yellowing and scorching or browning of leaf margins (edges), particularly on older leaves.
*   Weak stems and reduced plant rigidity.
*   Poor flower quality, smaller blooms, and reduced vase life.
*   Increased susceptibility to diseases and environmental stresses.

**Correction:**
*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** (Potassium Chloride, 60% K2O) at 15-20 kg/acre as a basal application or top-dressing.
    *   Alternatively, apply **Potassium Sulphate** (Sulphate of Potash, 50% K2O) at 20-25 kg/acre, especially if chloride sensitivity is a concern (though roses are generally tolerant).
*   **Foliar Spray (for quick relief):**
    *   Spray **Potassium Sulphate** at a concentration of 5-10 g/L of water. Apply during active growth or flowering stages.

### General Recommendations for Rose Cultivation:

*   **Soil Testing is Paramount:** The most accurate way to determine nutrient deficiencies and precise application rates is through a soil test. HAU provides comprehensive soil testing services. Please bring a representative soil sample from your rose garden to our nearest Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or the main campus.
*   **Balanced Fertilization:** Once soil test results are available, apply a balanced NPK fertilizer as per the recommendations to prevent future deficiencies and ensure optimal plant health.
*   **Organic Matter:** Regularly incorporate well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost (5-10 tonnes/acre annually) into the soil. This improves soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability.
*   **Application Timing:** Apply fertilizers when the plant is actively growing, typically after pruning and during the peak flowering periods. Split applications are generally more effective than a single large dose.
*   **Watering:** Always ensure adequate and consistent watering after fertilizer application to help dissolve the nutrients and move them into the root zone for uptake by the plant. Avoid applying fertilizers to dry soil.
*   **Observe and Adjust:** Continuously monitor your rose plants for any signs of nutrient stress and adjust your fertilization program as needed.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively address macro-nutrient deficiencies and promote healthy, vigorous growth and abundant flowering in your roses.
