As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for managing pests in Rose cultivation in Haryana. It is crucial to adopt an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural practices with judicious use of CIBRC-approved chemicals.

Here's how to control the mentioned pests:

### 1. Borers (Stem Borers)

Rose plants can be affected by various stem borers, which tunnel into the stems, causing wilting and dieback.

*   **Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
    *   Regularly inspect rose bushes for signs of wilting or holes in stems.
    *   Prune affected canes well below the borer entry point, ensuring no part of the borer remains in the plant. Destroy the pruned material immediately by burning or deep burying to prevent further spread.
    *   Maintain plant vigour through proper nutrition and watering to help plants withstand minor infestations.

*   **Chemical Control (for severe infestations or prophylactic measures):**
    *   **Systemic Drench/Injection:**
        *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL**: Apply as a soil drench at the base of the plant at 0.5-0.75 ml per litre of water, or inject into borer holes (diluted as per product label).
        *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG**: Apply as a soil drench at 0.2-0.4 g per litre of water.
    *   **Direct Application (for visible holes):**
        *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC**: Inject a small amount (e.g., 1-2 ml diluted in 10 ml water) directly into the borer hole using a syringe, then plug the hole with mud.

### 2. Caterpillars (including those causing leaf folding/rolling)

Various lepidopteran larvae (caterpillars) can feed on rose leaves, buds, and flowers, sometimes causing leaves to fold or roll.

*   **Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
    *   Regularly monitor plants for caterpillars and manually remove them if the infestation is low.
    *   Remove and destroy any folded or rolled leaves containing larvae.
    *   Encourage natural predators like birds, parasitic wasps, and predatory bugs.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Biological Insecticides (preferred for early stages and safety):**
        *   **Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki (Bt) (e.g., 8000 WP)**: Spray at 1-2 g per litre of water. Effective against young larvae.
    *   **Chemical Insecticides (for moderate to severe infestations):**
        *   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG**: Spray at 0.2-0.4 g per litre of water.
        *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC**: Spray at 0.15-0.2 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Spinosad 45% SC**: Spray at 0.2-0.3 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Indoxacarb 14.5% SC**: Spray at 0.5 ml per litre of water.

### 3. Diamondback Moth (DBM)

This is not known to affect Rose. Diamondback moth (*Plutella xylostella*) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower, mustard).

### 4. Leaf Folder

As mentioned under caterpillars, "leaf folder" damage on roses is typically caused by various lepidopteran larvae that feed on leaves and may roll or fold them for protection. The control measures are the same as for general caterpillars. Please refer to the "Caterpillars" section above for recommended control strategies.

**General Recommendations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully, including dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during chemical application.
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
*   Apply insecticides during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension services for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions.
