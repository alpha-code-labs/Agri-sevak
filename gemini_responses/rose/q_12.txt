Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, I can confirm that Scale insects and Mealybugs are common and persistent pests of roses in Haryana. Effective control requires an integrated approach combining cultural, mechanical, and judicious chemical methods.

Here's how to manage them:

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategy:**

1.  **Regular Monitoring:** Inspect your rose plants frequently, especially the undersides of leaves, stem joints, and new growth, for early signs of these pests.
2.  **Pruning and Sanitation:**
    *   Immediately prune and destroy heavily infested branches, leaves, or stems. Do not compost infested material.
    *   Remove any plant debris around the base of the rose bush.
3.  **Mechanical Removal:**
    *   For small infestations, use a strong jet of water to dislodge mealybugs and scale crawlers.
    *   For scale insects, gently scrub them off stems with a soft brush or cloth dipped in soapy water.
    *   Mealybugs can be dabbed directly with a cotton swab dipped in rubbing alcohol (ensure to test on a small, inconspicuous area first to avoid phytotoxicity).
4.  **Encourage Natural Enemies:** Ladybird beetles (especially *Cryptolaemus montrouzieri* for mealybugs) and parasitic wasps are natural predators. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides if natural enemies are present.
5.  **Proper Plant Care:**
    *   Ensure adequate air circulation by proper spacing and pruning.
    *   Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush, soft growth that is more attractive to sucking pests.
    *   Maintain plant vigor through proper watering and nutrition.

**Chemical Control (Use only when necessary and follow label instructions carefully):**

When infestations are severe or mechanical methods are insufficient, chemical control may be required. Always ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and stem crevices where these pests hide. Repeat applications may be necessary as per product label.

*   **Horticultural Mineral Oil (e.g., 80% EC or similar formulations):**
    *   **Dosage:** 10-20 ml per litre of water for dormant spray (winter), or 5-10 ml per litre of water for foliar spray on actively growing plants.
    *   **Application:** Works by suffocating the pests. Apply thoroughly, ensuring complete coverage. Best applied during cooler parts of the day.
*   **Buprofezin (25% SC):**
    *   **Dosage:** 1.0 - 1.25 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Application:** An Insect Growth Regulator (IGR) that disrupts the molting process of nymphs, making it very effective against both scale crawlers and mealybug nymphs. It has good residual action.
*   **Imidacloprid (17.8% SL):**
    *   **Dosage:** 0.5 - 1.0 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Application:** A systemic insecticide that is absorbed by the plant and moves through its sap, killing pests that feed on it. Effective against both scales and mealybugs.
*   **Dimethoate (30% EC):**
    *   **Dosage:** 1.0 - 1.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Application:** A systemic and contact insecticide effective against a wide range of sucking pests.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Rotate Chemicals:** To prevent the development of resistance, rotate between different classes of insecticides (e.g., use **Buprofezin**, then **Imidacloprid**, then **Dimethoate** if multiple applications are needed).
*   **Safety First:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (gloves, mask, eye protection) when handling and applying pesticides.
*   **Read the Label:** Always refer to the specific product label for detailed instructions, precautions, and the latest recommended dosages for your region and crop.
*   **Timing:** For scale insects, targeting the 'crawler' stage (young, mobile nymphs) is most effective, as they are not yet protected by the waxy covering. For mealybugs, thorough coverage is key.

By implementing these strategies, you can effectively control scale insects and mealybugs on your rose plants.
