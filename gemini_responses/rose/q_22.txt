As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the recommended cultivation practices for Rose in Haryana.

Roses are primarily propagated vegetatively for commercial and garden purposes, as propagation by seed does not guarantee true-to-type plants and is mainly used for breeding new varieties. Therefore, the terms "sowing method" and "seed dose" are generally not applicable in the traditional sense for rose cultivation.

Here are the recommended cultivation practices:

*   **Propagation Method (instead of Sowing method/pattern):**
    *   Roses are predominantly propagated through **cuttings**, **budding**, or **grafting**.
    *   For commercial cultivation, **budded plants** (often on rootstocks like *Rosa indica* 'odorata' or *Rosa multiflora*) are commonly used as they offer vigor and disease resistance.
    *   The planting pattern is typically in **rows** to facilitate irrigation, fertilization, pruning, and harvesting.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   For **rooted cuttings or own-root plants**: Plant them at the same depth they were growing in the nursery or pot, ensuring the root ball is fully covered.
    *   For **budded or grafted plants**: The bud union (the swollen part where the scion meets the rootstock) should ideally be planted just **at or slightly above ground level** (1-2 cm above) in regions like Haryana to prevent the scion from rooting and to maintain the benefits of the rootstock. In some colder climates, it's planted below ground, but for Haryana, above ground is generally preferred.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   Spacing varies depending on the rose type (Hybrid Teas, Floribundas, Miniatures, Climbers) and the purpose (cut flower production, garden display).
    *   **For Commercial Cut Flower Production (Hybrid Teas/Floribundas):**
        *   **Row to Row:** 60-90 cm
        *   **Plant to Plant:** 30-45 cm
        *   This spacing allows for good air circulation and light penetration, crucial for quality flower production.
    *   **For Garden Display (Bush Roses):**
        *   **Bush Roses:** 60-90 cm apart
        *   **Climbing Roses:** 1.5-3 meters apart, depending on vigor and support structure.

*   **Planting Material Dose (instead of Seed dose):**
    *   Since roses are not typically grown from seed for commercial purposes, there is no "seed dose."
    *   Based on the recommended spacing for commercial cut flower production (e.g., 75 cm x 40 cm), you would require approximately **33,000 to 40,000 plants per hectare** (or 13,000 to 16,000 plants per acre).
    *   The exact number will depend on the chosen spacing.
