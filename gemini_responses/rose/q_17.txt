As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following doses for organic manures in Rose cultivation, keeping in mind the soil and climatic conditions of Haryana:

*   **Farmyard Manure (FYM):**
    *   For established rose plants: Apply **5-10 kg** of well-decomposed FYM per plant annually. This can be split into 2-3 applications, typically during pruning (December-January) and before major flowering flushes (e.g., September-October). Mix it lightly into the topsoil around the plant and water thoroughly.
    *   For new plantings: Incorporate **5-10 kg** of FYM per planting pit, mixing it thoroughly with the excavated soil before planting.
    *   For field-scale cultivation: Apply **20-30 tonnes** per acre annually, incorporated into the soil before planting or as a top dressing.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   For established rose plants: Apply **1-2 kg** of vermicompost per plant annually, split into 2-3 applications similar to FYM. Vermicompost has higher nutrient content, so a lesser quantity is sufficient. Mix it lightly into the topsoil and water.
    *   For new plantings: Incorporate **1-2 kg** of vermicompost per planting pit, mixing it with the soil.
    *   For field-scale cultivation: Apply **4-5 tonnes** per acre annually.

*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract):**
    *   **Sagarika** is a seaweed-based biostimulant, rich in natural plant hormones, micronutrients, and amino acids, which enhances plant growth and stress tolerance.
    *   Foliar Spray: Dilute **2-3 ml** of Sagarika per litre of water and spray evenly on the foliage. Apply every 15-20 days, especially during active growth, budding, and flowering stages.
    *   Soil Drench: For individual plants, dilute **50-100 ml** of Sagarika in sufficient water and apply around the base of the plant. This can be done every 30-45 days.

**General Recommendations:**
*   Always ensure the FYM and vermicompost are well-decomposed to avoid pest issues and nutrient lock-up.
*   After applying solid organic manures, lightly incorporate them into the topsoil and water the plants thoroughly to help nutrient release.
*   Regular application of organic manures improves soil structure, water retention, and microbial activity, leading to healthier rose plants and better flowering.
