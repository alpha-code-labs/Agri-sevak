As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the specified pests in Rose plants in Haryana:

### Grasshopper

Grasshoppers can cause significant damage to rose foliage by chewing on leaves, buds, and flowers.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Regularly inspect plants and hand-pick grasshoppers for small infestations.
    *   Keep the area around rose plants free of tall weeds and dense vegetation, which can serve as breeding grounds and shelter for grasshoppers.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   For larger infestations, consider spraying with CIBRC approved insecticides:
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 0.5 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Cypermethrin** 25% EC at 0.5 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 2.0 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Malathion** 50% EC at 2.0 ml per litre of water.
        *   For an organic option, **Azadirachtin** (Neem oil 1500 ppm) at 5 ml per litre of water can be used as a repellent and anti-feedant.

### Painted bug

This is not known to affect Rose. Painted bug (Bagrada hilaris) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops like mustard, cabbage, and radish.

### Red cotton bug

This is not known to affect Rose. Red cotton bug (Dysdercus cingulatus) is primarily a pest of cotton, okra, and other malvaceous plants, feeding on developing seeds.

### Black ants

Black ants are often found on rose plants, usually attracted by the honeydew secreted by sap-sucking pests like aphids or scale insects, which they tend and protect. They can also cause minor direct damage or disturb roots if nesting at the base.

*   **Cultural and Physical Control:**
    *   The primary step is to control the sap-sucking pests (aphids, scale insects) that ants are tending. Once these pests are eliminated, ants will naturally move away.
    *   Maintain good garden hygiene, removing plant debris and keeping the area around roses clean.
    *   For individual plants, sticky barriers can be applied around the base of the stem to prevent ants from climbing up.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   To control ants directly, especially if they are nesting near the rose plants or causing direct damage:
        *   Apply **Fipronil** 0.3% GR granules around the base of the plant or directly into ant nests at a rate of 10-15 kg per acre (adjust for individual plants).
        *   Drench the soil around the base of the plant or spray ant trails with **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 2.0 ml per litre of water.
        *   Spray ant trails and nests with **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 0.5 ml per litre of water.
        *   For systemic control of both ants and the sap-sucking pests they tend, drench the soil around the plant with **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL at 0.5 ml per litre of water.
