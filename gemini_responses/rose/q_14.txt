Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling soil pests like termites and root-knot nematodes in roses. Both these pests can cause significant damage to rose plants by affecting their root system, leading to stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, and reduced flowering.

Here's how to manage them effectively:

### I. Control of Termites (White Ants) in Rose

Termites are known to affect roses, especially by feeding on the roots and the base of the stem, often leading to wilting and eventual death of the plant.

**A. Cultural and Mechanical Methods:**

*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove all dead wood, plant debris, and stumps from the rose bed. Termites are attracted to decaying organic matter.
*   **Avoid Wood Contact:** Ensure that no wooden stakes or supports are in direct contact with the soil, as this can provide an entry point for termites.
*   **Proper Irrigation:** Avoid excessive moisture around the plant base, as damp conditions can favor termite activity.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** Before planting, deep ploughing can expose termite colonies to predators and sunlight, disrupting their nests.

**B. Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved):**

For effective chemical control, soil drenching with CIBRC approved insecticides is recommended.

*   **Pre-planting Treatment:**
    *   Mix **Fipronil 5% SC** at 1.5-2 ml/L of water and drench the soil thoroughly in the planting pit.
    *   Alternatively, use **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL** at 0.5-1 ml/L of water for soil drenching.
*   **Post-planting Treatment (for existing plants):**
    *   Drench the soil around the base of affected rose plants with **Fipronil 5% SC** at 1.5-2 ml/L of water. Ensure the solution penetrates the root zone.
    *   Alternatively, use **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL** at 0.5-1 ml/L of water as a soil drench.

### II. Control of Nematodes (Root-Knot Nematodes) in Rose

Root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.) are a major problem in roses, causing characteristic galls or knots on the roots, impairing water and nutrient uptake. This leads to stunted growth, yellowing, and reduced vigor.

**A. Cultural and Biological Methods:**

*   **Soil Solarization:** During hot summer months (May-June), cover the moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks. This raises soil temperature to lethal levels for nematodes and other soil-borne pathogens.
*   **Organic Matter Addition:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost (20-30 tonnes/acre) into the soil. This improves soil health and promotes beneficial microorganisms that can suppress nematode populations.
*   **Marigold Intercropping:** Planting marigolds (Tagetes spp.) as an intercrop or border crop around rose beds can help reduce nematode populations, as their roots release compounds toxic to nematodes.
*   **Bio-nematicides:**
    *   Apply formulations of **Purpureocillium lilacinum** (formerly *Paecilomyces lilacinus*) or **Trichoderma harzianum** at 1-2 kg/acre. Mix with 100 kg of well-decomposed FYM/compost and apply to the soil around the root zone. These fungi parasitize nematode eggs and juveniles.
    *   **Pseudomonas fluorescens** based formulations (1-2 kg/acre) can also be used as a soil application to suppress nematodes.

**B. Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved):**

Chemical nematicides should be used judiciously and as part of an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategy.

*   **Pre-planting Treatment:**
    *   Incorporate **Fluensulfone 2% GR** at 20-25 kg/acre into the soil before planting. This provides residual control.
*   **Post-planting Treatment (for existing plants):**
    *   Drench the soil around the base of affected rose plants with **Oxamyl 24% SL** at 2-3 ml/L of water. Repeat application if necessary, following label instructions.
    *   Alternatively, for granular application, **Fluensulfone 2% GR** can be applied around the root zone of existing plants at recommended rates (e.g., 20-25 kg/acre, split into smaller doses for individual plants) and lightly incorporated into the soil, followed by irrigation.

### General Recommendations:

*   **Integrated Pest Management (IPM):** Always combine cultural, biological, and chemical methods for sustainable and effective pest control.
*   **Soil Testing:** Regularly test your soil to understand its health and nutrient status, which can influence pest susceptibility.
*   **Proper Diagnosis:** Ensure correct identification of the pest before applying any control measures.
*   **Safety Precautions:** When using chemical pesticides, always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (gloves, mask, eye protection) and follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety guidelines strictly. Keep chemicals out of reach of children and livestock.

By implementing these strategies, you can effectively manage termites and root-knot nematodes, ensuring healthy and productive rose plants in your garden or farm.
