As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for rose cultivation in Haryana:

### Seed Treatment for Rose

Roses are primarily propagated vegetatively through cuttings, budding, or grafting for commercial cultivation. Propagation by seeds is generally reserved for breeding new varieties and is not a standard practice for establishing rose gardens or commercial fields.

Therefore, conventional "seed treatment" processes, as applied to field crops like cereals or pulses, are **not known to affect Rose** in typical horticultural practice.

### Soil Treatment Process for Rose

Healthy soil is fundamental for robust rose growth and disease resistance. The soil treatment process focuses on preparing the soil before planting and managing soil-borne issues.

**1. Pre-planting Soil Preparation:**

*   **Soil Testing:** Before any treatment, it is crucial to conduct a comprehensive soil test. This will provide information on soil pH, nutrient status (macro and micronutrients), and organic matter content, guiding subsequent amendments.
*   **Deep Ploughing/Tilling:** Plough the land deeply (at least 30-45 cm) to break up hardpans, improve aeration, and facilitate root penetration.
*   **Organic Matter Incorporation:** Incorporate a generous amount of well-rotted Farmyard Manure (FYM) or compost @ 10-15 kg per square meter (or 20-30 tonnes per acre) into the soil. This improves soil structure, water retention, nutrient availability, and supports beneficial microbial activity.
*   **pH Adjustment:**
    *   Roses thrive in slightly acidic to neutral soils (pH 6.0-7.0).
    *   **For acidic soils (pH < 6.0):** Apply agricultural lime (calcium carbonate) as per soil test recommendations to raise the pH.
    *   **For alkaline soils (pH > 7.5):** Incorporate gypsum (calcium sulfate) @ 2-4 kg per square meter and additional organic matter to help lower the pH and improve soil structure.

**2. Management of Soil-borne Pests and Diseases:**

*   **Solarization (Non-chemical method):** During hot summer months (May-June), moisten the prepared soil and cover it tightly with a transparent polyethylene sheet for 4-6 weeks. The sun's heat trapped under the sheet can effectively kill many soil-borne pathogens (fungi, bacteria), nematodes, and weed seeds.
*   **Biological Control (Bio-pesticides):**
    *   **For Fungal Diseases (e.g., damping-off, root rot caused by *Fusarium*, *Rhizoctonia*, *Pythium*):**
        *   Apply **Trichoderma viride** @ 2.5 kg per acre, mixed with 50 kg of well-rotted FYM or compost. Apply this mixture to the soil 10-15 days before planting.
    *   **For Nematodes:**
        *   Incorporate **Neem cake** @ 200-400 kg per acre into the soil during preparation. Neem cake acts as an organic amendment and has nematicidal properties.
        *   Apply **Paecilomyces lilacinus** (a bio-nematicide) @ 2.5 kg per acre, mixed with 50 kg of well-rotted FYM or compost, 10-15 days before planting.
*   **Chemical Control (if severe infestation or history of specific problems, after soil test/diagnosis):**
    *   **For Fungal Diseases (e.g., severe root rot, damping-off):**
        *   As a pre-planting soil drench, apply **Carbendazim** @ 1-2 g/L water, or **Propamocarb hydrochloride** @ 2-3 ml/L water. Drench the planting pits or the entire bed thoroughly.
    *   **For Nematodes (only if severe and biological methods are insufficient):**
        *   *Chemical nematicides are highly restricted and often toxic. For general recommendations, focus on biological and cultural methods first. If a chemical solution is deemed absolutely necessary by a qualified expert after diagnosis, specific CIBRC-approved granular nematicides might be considered, but their use requires extreme caution and adherence to label instructions.*

**3. Basal Nutrient Application (Post-soil test):**

*   Based on the soil test report, apply recommended doses of macro-nutrients (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium) and micronutrients (if deficient) as basal fertilizers before planting. For example, a general recommendation might include Single Super Phosphate (SSP) for phosphorus and Muriate of Potash (MOP) for potassium, along with a small amount of nitrogen.

By following these scientifically verified soil treatment processes, you can establish a healthy foundation for successful rose cultivation in Haryana.
