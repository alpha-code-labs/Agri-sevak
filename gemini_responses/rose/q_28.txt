As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified practices to protect your roses from environmental stresses in Haryana:

### Protection from Extreme Cold and Frost:

*   **Watering:** Ensure the soil around your rose bushes is adequately moist (but not waterlogged) before a predicted frost event. Moist soil retains heat better than dry soil, radiating it slowly through the night and helping to keep the root zone warmer.
*   **Mulching:** Apply a thick layer (7-10 cm) of organic mulch such as straw, wood chips, or sugarcane trash around the base of the plants. This insulates the soil, protects the root zone from freezing, and helps maintain a more stable soil temperature.
*   **Covering:** For young or particularly sensitive rose varieties, cover them with burlap, old sheets, or specialized frost blankets before nightfall. Ensure the cover extends to the ground to trap warmth. Remove covers during the day to allow for air circulation and sunlight, preventing fungal issues and promoting photosynthesis. Avoid using plastic directly touching the foliage, as it can cause more damage due to condensation and direct cold transfer.
*   **Site Selection:** If planting new roses, choose locations that are somewhat sheltered from direct cold winds and receive morning sun to help thaw frost gradually.
*   **Pruning:** Avoid heavy pruning in late autumn, as it stimulates new, tender growth that is highly susceptible to frost damage. Perform major pruning only after the threat of severe frost has passed in late winter/early spring.

### Protection from Heat (Loo) and Intense Sunlight:

*   **Watering:** Provide deep and consistent watering, especially during hot periods and when the hot "Loo" winds are prevalent. Water early in the morning to allow the plant to absorb moisture before the heat of the day and to minimize evaporative loss. Aim for 20-30 litres per plant per week during peak summer, adjusted based on soil type and rainfall.
*   **Mulching:** Maintain a 7-10 cm layer of organic mulch around the base of the plants. This is crucial for conserving soil moisture, reducing soil temperature, and suppressing weeds, all of which are vital in hot conditions.
*   **Shading:** During the peak summer months (typically April to June in Haryana) when temperatures are highest and sunlight is most intense, consider providing temporary shade. A 30-50% shade net erected over the rose beds can significantly reduce heat stress, prevent leaf scorch, and protect delicate petals from bleaching.
*   **Windbreaks:** If your garden is exposed to strong, hot westerly winds (Loo), consider planting taller, heat-tolerant shrubs or erecting temporary physical barriers on the windward side to reduce wind stress and desiccation.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure your roses receive adequate potassium nutrition, as it plays a vital role in improving a plant's tolerance to heat and drought stress. A balanced fertilizer program based on soil testing is always recommended.
