As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for irrigation management in Lentil (Masur) in Haryana:

Lentil is a relatively drought-tolerant crop, and excessive irrigation can be more harmful than beneficial, leading to excessive vegetative growth, lodging, increased susceptibility to diseases, and reduced yield. The key is judicious and timely water application.

### Irrigation Management in Lentil (Masur)

**1. First Irrigation:**
*   **Timing:** The first irrigation is critical and should be applied at the **branching stage** or **pre-flowering stage**, typically around 45-60 days after sowing (DAS).
*   **Soil Moisture:** If the soil has sufficient moisture from pre-sowing irrigation or winter rains, the first irrigation can be delayed or even skipped.
*   **Application:** It should be a **light irrigation**. Heavy irrigation at this stage can lead to excessive vegetative growth at the expense of reproductive growth.
*   **Impact:** Timely and light first irrigation helps in better root development and nutrient uptake, preparing the plant for flowering and pod formation.

**2. Second Irrigation (if needed):**
*   **Timing:** A second irrigation is generally required only if there is a prolonged dry spell and the crop shows signs of moisture stress during the **pod development and filling stage**, typically around 80-90 DAS.
*   **Avoidance:** Avoid irrigation during the peak flowering stage, as it can lead to flower drop and reduced pod setting.
*   **Condition:** Assess the soil moisture status. If the soil is still moist from the first irrigation or recent rainfall, a second irrigation may not be necessary.
*   **Application:** Similar to the first, it should be a **light irrigation** to support pod filling without causing waterlogging.

**3. Sprinkler Use:**
*   **Efficiency:** Sprinkler irrigation is highly recommended for lentil cultivation in Haryana due to its efficiency in water use and uniform distribution.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   **Water Saving:** Significantly reduces water consumption compared to traditional flood irrigation, which is crucial in water-scarce regions.
    *   **Uniform Application:** Ensures even distribution of water, preventing waterlogging in some areas and moisture stress in others.
    *   **Reduced Disease Incidence:** Minimizes direct contact of water with the plant canopy and soil surface, which can help in reducing the incidence of certain fungal diseases.
    *   **Improved Aeration:** Prevents soil compaction and maintains better soil aeration, which is beneficial for root growth and nitrogen fixation.
*   **Application:** When using sprinklers, apply water lightly and frequently rather than heavily. This mimics natural rainfall and is ideal for lentil. Micro-sprinklers or rain guns can be effectively utilized.

**General Advice:**
*   Always monitor the soil moisture status and the crop's visual symptoms of stress before deciding on irrigation.
*   Consider the amount and timing of winter rainfall, as it can significantly reduce the need for irrigation.
*   The goal is to maintain adequate soil moisture during critical growth stages without causing waterlogging.
