As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an integrated approach for managing soil pests like termites and nematodes in Lentil (Masur), combining cultural practices with judicious use of CIBRC-approved chemical interventions.

Both termites and root-knot nematodes are significant pests of Lentil in Haryana, causing considerable yield losses by damaging roots and affecting plant vigor.

### Integrated Pest Management for Soil Pests in Lentil (Masur)

**A. Termite (Dimag) Control:**

Termites damage the roots and stem base of lentil plants, leading to wilting and plant death, especially in dry conditions.

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Deep Summer Ploughing:** Expose termite colonies to the sun and predators by deep ploughing fields during summer.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove crop residues, stubble, and any woody debris from the field that can serve as food sources or shelter for termites.
    *   **Proper Irrigation:** Where irrigation is available, adequate moisture can deter termite activity.

2.  **Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved):**
    *   **Pre-sowing Soil Treatment:**
        *   Apply **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** at 2.0-2.5 L per acre, mixed with 200-400 L of water, and apply as a drench or through irrigation before sowing.
    *   **At Sowing:**
        *   Apply **Fipronil 0.3% GR** at 6.6-10 kg per acre, uniformly in furrows at the time of sowing.

**B. Nematode (Root-knot) Control:**

Root-knot nematodes (*Meloidogyne* spp.) cause galls on lentil roots, leading to stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, and reduced nutrient uptake, ultimately impacting yield.

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops such as cereals (e.g., wheat, barley) for at least 2-3 years to reduce nematode populations in the soil.
    *   **Deep Summer Ploughing:** Expose nematode eggs and larvae to the sun, which helps in their desiccation and destruction.
    *   **Use of Resistant Varieties:** If available and suitable for Haryana conditions, cultivate nematode-resistant lentil varieties.
    *   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost, which can improve soil health and promote beneficial microorganisms that suppress nematodes.

2.  **Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved):**
    *   **At Sowing:**
        *   Apply **Carbosulfan 6% GR** at 10-15 kg per acre, uniformly in furrows at the time of sowing.
        *   Alternatively, apply **Carbofuran 3% GR** at 10-13 kg per acre, uniformly in furrows at the time of sowing.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully before use.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Ensure proper calibration of application equipment for accurate dosage.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension officers for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions.
