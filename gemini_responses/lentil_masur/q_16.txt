As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified fertilizer doses for Lentil (Masur) cultivation in Haryana.

Lentil, being a leguminous crop, has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria (Rhizobium) in its root nodules. Therefore, its nitrogen requirement is lower compared to non-leguminous crops. However, a starter dose of nitrogen is beneficial for early plant vigor before nodulation is fully established. Phosphorus is crucial for root development and nodulation, while Potassium and Sulphur are important for overall plant health and protein synthesis.

**General Recommendation:** Always conduct a soil test to determine the precise nutrient status of your field. The following recommendations are general guidelines for soils with average fertility.

**Recommended Nutrient Doses for Lentil (Masur) per acre:**
*   **Nitrogen (N):** 15-20 kg
*   **Phosphorus (P2O5):** 40-60 kg
*   **Potassium (K2O):** 20 kg (Apply only if soil test indicates deficiency)
*   **Sulphur (S):** 20 kg (Beneficial for pulses, especially if soil test indicates deficiency)

**Fertilizer Options (Basal Application at Sowing):**

You can choose one of the following options to meet the nutrient requirements:

**Option 1: Using Diammonium Phosphate (DAP), Muriate of Potash, and Elemental Sulphur**
*   **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP):** 100-130 kg/acre (This will provide 18-23 kg N and 46-60 kg P2O5)
*   **Muriate of Potash:** 33 kg/acre (If K deficiency is indicated by soil test)
*   **Elemental Sulphur (90%):** 22 kg/acre (If S deficiency is indicated or not covered by other fertilizers)

**Option 2: Using Urea, Single Super Phosphate (SSP), and Muriate of Potash**
*   **Urea:** 32-43 kg/acre (To provide 15-20 kg N)
*   **Single Super Phosphate (SSP):** 250-375 kg/acre (This will provide 40-60 kg P2O5 and 27.5-41.25 kg S)
*   **Muriate of Potash:** 33 kg/acre (If K deficiency is indicated by soil test)

**Option 3: Using NPK Complex Fertilizer (e.g., 12:32:16 grade)**
*   **NPK (12:32:16 grade):** 125-188 kg/acre (This will provide approximately 15-22.5 kg N, 40-60 kg P2O5, and 20-30 kg K2O)

**Nano-Fertilizers (Foliar Application):**

Nano-fertilizers can be used as supplementary nutrition, especially during critical growth stages or under stress conditions. They are not meant to replace basal application of conventional fertilizers entirely.

*   **Nano-Urea:**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml/L of water for foliar spray.
    *   **Timing:** Typically 1-2 sprays during vegetative growth (e.g., 30-45 days after sowing) and/or pre-flowering stage.
*   **Nano-DAP:**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml/L of water for foliar spray.
    *   **Timing:** Typically 1-2 sprays during pre-flowering and pod initiation stages to support reproductive growth.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Rhizobium Inoculation:** Always treat lentil seeds with an effective **Rhizobium** culture before sowing. This significantly enhances nitrogen fixation and reduces the need for external nitrogen fertilizers.
*   **Application Method:** All conventional fertilizers (Urea, DAP, SSP, Muriate of Potash, NPK) should be applied as a basal dose and thoroughly mixed into the soil at the time of sowing.
*   **Micronutrients:** If soil tests indicate deficiencies of micronutrients like Zinc or Boron, apply them as per recommendations. For example, **Zinc Sulphate** (21%) at 25 kg/acre or **Borax** (10.5%) at 10 kg/acre as basal.
