Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU), Hisar, I will provide scientifically verified advice regarding dropping in Lentil (Masur).

Firstly, regarding "Tinda/Boll dropping":
This is not known to affect Lentil (Masur). Lentil plants produce pods, not tinda (a type of gourd) or bolls (as seen in cotton).

However, flower drop and pod (fruit) drop are significant concerns in Lentil (Masur) cultivation. These issues can lead to substantial yield losses.

**Causes of Flower and Pod Drop in Lentil (Masur):**

1.  **Environmental Stress:**
    *   **High Temperatures:** Temperatures exceeding 30-32°C, especially during flowering and pod development, can cause flower abortion and pod drop.
    *   **Water Stress:** Both drought conditions (insufficient moisture) and waterlogging (excessive moisture) can lead to dropping.
    *   **Humidity:** Extremely low or high humidity can also negatively impact pollination and pod set.
2.  **Nutrient Deficiencies:**
    *   **Boron:** Critical for pollen viability and fertilization. Deficiency can directly cause flower drop.
    *   **Molybdenum:** Essential for nitrogen fixation and overall plant vigour.
    *   **Phosphorus and Potassium:** Important for overall plant health, flowering, and pod development.
3.  **Hormonal Imbalance:** Stress conditions can disrupt the plant's natural hormonal balance, promoting abscission (shedding) of flowers and young pods.
4.  **Poor Pollination:** Inadequate pollination due to adverse weather or lack of pollinators can result in unfertilized flowers dropping.

**Control Measures for Flower and Pod Drop in Lentil (Masur):**

**A. Agronomic Practices:**

1.  **Timely Sowing:** Sow lentil varieties at the optimal time (typically October-November in Haryana) to ensure that the flowering and pod development stages do not coincide with periods of extreme heat or cold.
2.  **Irrigation Management:** Provide light and timely irrigation, especially at the pre-flowering and pod development stages. Avoid both water stress and waterlogging.
3.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Ensure adequate application of **Phosphorus** and **Potassium** as per soil test recommendations.
    *   Address micronutrient deficiencies, particularly **Boron** and **Molybdenum**, through soil application or foliar sprays if soil tests indicate a need.
4.  **Variety Selection:** Choose heat-tolerant varieties if cultivation is planned in areas or seasons prone to high temperatures during critical growth stages.

**B. Chemical Interventions (CIBRC Approved):**

Foliar sprays of certain plant growth regulators and micronutrients can help mitigate flower and pod drop.

1.  **Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs):**
    *   **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA):** An auxin that helps in reducing flower and pod drop by maintaining hormonal balance.
        *   **Dosage:** 0.45 - 0.9 ml/L of water (for 4.5% SL formulation).
        *   **Timing:** Spray at the pre-flowering stage and/or early pod development stage.
2.  **Micronutrients (if deficiency is suspected/confirmed):**
    *   **Boron:** Essential for pollen germination and fertilization.
        *   **Technical Chemical Name:** **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (e.g., 20% Boron).
        *   **Dosage:** 1 - 2 g/L of water.
        *   **Timing:** Spray at the pre-flowering stage.
    *   **Molybdenum:** Important for nitrogen metabolism.
        *   **Technical Chemical Name:** **Sodium Molybdate** or **Ammonium Molybdate**.
        *   **Dosage:** 0.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Timing:** Spray at the pre-flowering stage, especially in acidic soils.
3.  **Stress Alleviators:**
    *   **Potassium Nitrate (KNO3):** Can help improve stress tolerance and nutrient uptake.
        *   **Dosage:** 5 - 10 g/L of water (0.5-1% solution).
        *   **Timing:** Spray at pre-flowering and/or early pod development stages, especially under stress conditions.

Always ensure thorough coverage of the foliage during spraying. It is advisable to consult with your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and soil test results.
