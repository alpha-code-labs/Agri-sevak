As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned conditions in Lentil (Masur) in Haryana:

### Grasshopper Control in Lentil (Masur)

Grasshoppers can cause significant defoliation in lentil by feeding on leaves, tender shoots, and sometimes pods. Control measures should be initiated when damage is observed or populations are high.

**1. Cultural Control:**
*   **Deep Summer Plowing:** Plowing fields deeply during summer exposes grasshopper eggs to predators and harsh weather, reducing their population in the subsequent season.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Keep field bunds and surrounding areas free of weeds, which can serve as breeding grounds and shelter for grasshoppers.

**2. Chemical Control:**
When grasshopper populations are high and causing economic damage, the following CIBRC approved insecticides can be used:
*   **Malathion** 50% EC: Apply 1.0 - 1.25 L per acre in 250-300 L of water.
*   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: Apply 200 - 250 ml per acre in 250-300 L of water.

### Other Pests

*   **Painted bug:** This is not known to affect Lentil (Masur) as a significant pest. It is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops like mustard.
*   **Red cotton bug:** This is not known to affect Lentil (Masur). It is primarily a pest of cotton and other malvaceous plants.
*   **Black ants:** This is not known to affect Lentil (Masur) as a direct pest causing damage to the crop. Ants are generally not considered direct pests of lentil plants. If they are observed, they might be associated with other sap-sucking pests like aphids, feeding on their honeydew. In such cases, controlling the primary sap-sucking pest will indirectly manage the ant population.
