Protecting Lentil (Masur) from wild animals is a significant challenge for farmers in Haryana. Wild animals such as Nilgai (Blue Bull), wild boar, deer, and sometimes monkeys can cause substantial damage to crops. Effective management requires a combination of physical barriers, scaring techniques, and human vigilance.

Here are the scientifically verified methods to protect Lentil (Masur) from wild animals:

*   **Physical Barriers:**
    *   **Fencing:**
        *   **Barbed Wire Fencing:** A multi-strand barbed wire fence (at least 5-7 strands, 1.5-2 meters high) can deter some animals. Ensure the fence is taut and well-maintained.
        *   **Electric Fencing:** This is one of the most effective methods against larger animals like Nilgai and wild boar. A low-cost, solar-powered electric fence can be installed around the field. It delivers a non-lethal shock that deters animals without harming them. Proper earthing and signage are crucial for safety.
        *   **Mesh Fencing:** For smaller animals or in combination with barbed wire, a strong mesh fence can be effective, especially if buried slightly underground to prevent burrowing.
*   **Scaring Techniques:**
    *   **Acoustic Deterrents:**
        *   **Noise Makers:** Using gas guns, crackers, or other loud noise-making devices at irregular intervals can scare animals away. However, animals can habituate to constant noise.
        *   **Human Presence:** Regular patrolling and guarding of fields, especially during critical growth stages and at night, is highly effective.
    *   **Visual Deterrents:**
        *   **Scarecrows:** While traditional, their effectiveness is often limited as animals quickly learn they pose no threat. They can be made more effective by changing their location and appearance frequently.
        *   **Reflective Strips/CDs:** Hanging reflective materials can create glints of light that might deter some animals, but their long-term efficacy is low.
    *   **Guard Dogs:** Well-trained guard dogs can be very effective in deterring wild animals from entering fields.
*   **Habitat Management:**
    *   **Clearing Vegetation:** Remove bushes and tall grasses around the field boundaries that can serve as hiding spots for wild animals.
*   **Community-Based Approaches:**
    *   **Coordinated Guarding:** Farmers in a village or cluster of fields can collectively organize guarding shifts to protect their crops, which is more sustainable than individual efforts.
    *   **Awareness and Reporting:** Report persistent wild animal issues to the local forest department for potential intervention or advice.

**Regarding Chemical Repellents:**
There are currently no CIBRC (Central Insecticides Board & Registration Committee) approved chemical repellents specifically recommended for direct application on Lentil (Masur) crops to deter large wild animals like Nilgai, wild boar, or deer in India. Therefore, chemical solutions are not a viable or recommended option for this purpose.
