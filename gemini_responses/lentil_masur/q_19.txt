Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, I can provide you with scientifically verified advice on addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies in Lentil (Masur) for Haryana conditions.

Lentil, being a legume, has specific nutrient requirements. While it can fix atmospheric nitrogen, adequate availability of Phosphorus and Potassium, along with a starter dose of Nitrogen, is crucial for optimal growth and yield.

**General Recommendation:**
Always conduct a soil test before sowing to determine the exact nutrient status of your field. This will allow for precise fertilizer application, preventing both deficiencies and over-application. The following recommendations are general guidelines for corrective measures.

### Addressing Macro-nutrient Deficiencies in Lentil (Masur)

#### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

Lentil plants fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in their root nodules. However, a small starter dose of nitrogen is beneficial for early establishment before nodulation is fully active.

*   **Symptoms:** General yellowing of older leaves, stunted growth, reduced branching, and pale green foliage.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Basal Application (at sowing):**
        *   Apply 15-20 kg Nitrogen per acre. This can be achieved by applying approximately 32-43 kg of **Urea** (46% N) per acre.
    *   **Foliar Application (if deficiency appears early in vegetative stage):**
        *   Spray a 0.5-1% solution of **Urea** (5-10 g of **Urea** per litre of water). Apply during the vegetative growth stage, ensuring good leaf coverage. Repeat if necessary after 10-15 days.

#### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

Phosphorus is vital for root development, nodule formation, flowering, and seed development in lentils.

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, dark green or purplish discoloration of leaves (especially older ones), poor root development, delayed flowering and maturity, and reduced pod formation.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Basal Application (at sowing, incorporated into soil):**
        *   Apply 40-60 kg Phosphorus (P2O5) per acre. This can be achieved by applying:
            *   Approximately 250-375 kg of **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5) per acre.
            *   **OR** Approximately 87-130 kg of **Di-Ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5) per acre. If using DAP, adjust the basal Nitrogen application (Urea) accordingly, as DAP also supplies Nitrogen.
    *   **Foliar Application (for quick correction of mild to moderate deficiency):**
        *   Spray a 1-2% solution of **Monoammonium Phosphate (MAP)** (10-20 g of **MAP** per litre of water) or **Potassium Dihydrogen Phosphate (MKP)** (10-20 g of **MKP** per litre of water). Apply during the vegetative to pre-flowering stage. Repeat if necessary after 10-15 days.

#### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency

Potassium plays a crucial role in water regulation, nutrient transport, enzyme activation, and enhancing disease resistance in plants.

*   **Symptoms:** Yellowing and scorching (browning) of leaf margins, particularly on older leaves, weak stems, reduced plant vigor, and increased susceptibility to diseases.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Basal Application (at sowing, incorporated into soil):**
        *   Apply 20 kg Potassium (K2O) per acre, especially on light-textured soils or where soil test indicates deficiency. This can be achieved by applying approximately 33 kg of **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** (60% K2O) per acre.
    *   **Foliar Application (for quick correction of mild to moderate deficiency):**
        *   Spray a 0.5-1% solution of **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** (5-10 g of **MOP** per litre of water) or **Potassium Sulphate (SOP)** (5-10 g of **SOP** per litre of water). Apply during the vegetative to flowering stage. Repeat if necessary after 10-15 days.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Soil Testing:** The most accurate way to determine nutrient deficiencies and required application rates is through regular soil testing. HAU recommends getting your soil tested every 2-3 years.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management (INM):** Combine chemical fertilizers with organic manures (Farm Yard Manure, compost) and bio-fertilizers (Rhizobium inoculants for lentil) for sustainable soil health and nutrient availability.
*   **Application Timing:** Basal applications should be done at the time of sowing and incorporated into the soil for better nutrient availability to young roots. Foliar applications are best done in the morning or late afternoon to avoid scorching and maximize absorption.
*   **Water Quality:** When preparing foliar sprays, use clean water.
*   **Compatibility:** If mixing with other pesticides or nutrients for foliar application, always check for compatibility.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively manage macro-nutrient deficiencies in your lentil crop and ensure healthy growth and good yields.
