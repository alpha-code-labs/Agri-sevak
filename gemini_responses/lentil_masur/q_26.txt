As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified information regarding specialized practices in Lentil (Masur) cultivation for Haryana:

Lentil (Masur) is an annual, self-pollinating, herbaceous legume primarily grown for its seeds. Most of the practices listed are not typically applied to field crops like lentil.

Here is the information on the requested practices:

*   **Pruning:** This is not known to affect Lentil (Masur). Lentil is an annual field crop where pruning is not a standard or beneficial practice. Its growth habit does not necessitate pruning for yield or plant health.

*   **Desuckering:** This is not known to affect Lentil (Masur). Lentil plants do not produce suckers in a manner that requires desuckering as a cultivation practice.

*   **Mulching:** Mulching is a beneficial practice for lentil cultivation, especially in regions like Haryana, to conserve soil moisture and manage weeds.
    *   **Purpose:**
        *   **Moisture Conservation:** Reduces evaporation from the soil surface, crucial for rainfed or limited irrigation conditions.
        *   **Weed Suppression:** Forms a physical barrier, inhibiting weed germination and growth, thereby reducing competition for nutrients and water.
        *   **Soil Temperature Regulation:** Helps moderate soil temperature, protecting roots from extreme heat or cold.
        *   **Soil Health Improvement:** Organic mulches decompose over time, adding organic matter and improving soil structure and fertility.
    *   **Materials:**
        *   **Organic Mulches:** Crop residues such as wheat straw, rice straw (chopped finely to aid decomposition), or other dry plant material can be used.
        *   **Plastic Mulch:** While less common for large-scale lentil cultivation due to cost and management, thin plastic films can be used in specific high-value or experimental setups for precise moisture and temperature control.
    *   **Application:** Mulch can be applied after sowing, or after plant emergence once the crop is established. A layer of 5-10 cm thickness is generally effective for organic mulches.

*   **Grafting:** This is not known to affect Lentil (Masur). Lentil is propagated by seed, and grafting is not a practice used in its cultivation.

*   **Pollination:** Lentil flowers are primarily self-pollinating (autogenous), meaning they can pollinate themselves without the need for external agents. While insects may visit lentil flowers, cross-pollination is minimal (typically less than 1%). Therefore, specialized practices for managing pollination (e.g., introducing pollinators) are not required for commercial lentil production.
