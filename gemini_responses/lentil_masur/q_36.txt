As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified practices to enhance yield, improve seed quality, and extend the storage life of Lentil (Masur) in Haryana.

### I. Strategies to Improve Lentil (Masur) Yield:

1.  **Variety Selection:** Choose high-yielding, disease-resistant varieties recommended for Haryana's agro-climatic conditions. Consult your local KVK or HAU for the latest recommendations.
2.  **Optimal Sowing Time:** Sow during the optimal window, typically from the last week of October to the first fortnight of November, for better establishment and growth.
3.  **Seed Treatment:**
    *   Treat seeds with a fungicide combination to protect against seed-borne diseases and damping-off:
        *   **Carbendazim** 1 g/kg seed + **Thiram** 2 g/kg seed, OR
        *   **Mancozeb** 2.5 g/kg seed.
    *   For early protection against sucking pests, treat with an insecticide:
        *   **Imidacloprid** 1.25 ml/kg seed.
    *   Inoculate seeds with bio-fertilizers for enhanced nutrient uptake:
        *   *Rhizobium* culture 10 g/kg seed and Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria (PSB) 10 g/kg seed.
4.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Apply a basal dose of fertilizers based on soil test reports. General recommendation for rainfed conditions:
        *   Nitrogen (N): 15-20 kg/acre (as a starter dose).
        *   Phosphorus (P2O5): 40-60 kg/acre.
        *   Potassium (K2O): 20 kg/acre (if soil test indicates deficiency).
        *   Sulphur (S): 20 kg/acre (important for pulse crops).
    *   Micronutrients: If soil tests indicate deficiency, apply:
        *   Zinc (Zn): 10 kg/acre of Zinc Sulphate heptahydrate (21%) or 7 kg/acre of Zinc Sulphate monohydrate (33%) as basal.
        *   Boron (B): 1 kg/acre of Borax (10.5%) as basal, or foliar spray of Boric acid (0.1%) at flowering.
5.  **Weed Management:**
    *   Pre-emergence application (within 0-3 days of sowing):
        *   **Pendimethalin** 1.0 kg a.i./acre (mixed in 200-300 L water).
    *   Post-emergence application (25-35 days after sowing, depending on weed flora):
        *   For grassy weeds: **Quizalofop-ethyl** 40-50 g a.i./acre.
        *   For broadleaf weeds: **Imazethapyr** 40-50 g a.i./acre.
6.  **Irrigation:** Lentil is generally grown as a rainfed crop. If irrigation facilities are available, one light irrigation at the pre-flowering or pod development stage can significantly boost yield, especially during dry spells. Avoid waterlogging.
7.  **Pest and Disease Management:**
    *   **Aphids:** If infestation is severe, spray **Imidacloprid** 0.25 ml/L water or **Thiamethoxam** 0.2 g/L water.
    *   **Pod Borer:** At pod formation stage, if damage is observed, spray **Emamectin benzoate** 0.2 g/L water or **Chlorantraniliprole** 0.3 ml/L water.
    *   **Rust:** If symptoms appear, spray **Mancozeb** 2.5 g/L water or **Propiconazole** 1 ml/L water. Repeat after 10-15 days if necessary.
    *   **Wilt:** Primarily managed through resistant varieties, seed treatment, and crop rotation.

### II. Strategies to Improve Lentil (Masur) Seed Quality:

1.  **Balanced Nutrition:** Adequate supply of Phosphorus, Potassium, Sulphur, Zinc, and Boron is crucial for better seed size, protein content, and overall nutritional quality. Follow recommendations under "Nutrient Management" for yield improvement.
2.  **Optimal Water Management:** Avoid severe moisture stress or waterlogging during flowering and pod filling stages, as these can lead to shriveled seeds and reduced quality.
3.  **Effective Pest and Disease Control:** Protect developing pods and seeds from damage by pests (e.g., pod borer) and diseases (e.g., rust, blight) to ensure healthy, plump seeds.
4.  **Timely Harvesting:** Harvest the crop when 80-90% of the pods have matured and dried. Delayed harvesting can lead to shattering losses and quality deterioration due to adverse weather.
5.  **Proper Drying:** After harvesting, dry the seeds uniformly to a safe moisture content (typically 12-14%) to prevent fungal growth and maintain viability.

### III. Strategies to Improve Lentil (Masur) Storage Life:

1.  **Thorough Drying:** This is the most critical step. Lentil seeds must be dried to a safe moisture content of 10-12% before storage. Higher moisture content leads to rapid spoilage by fungi and insects.
2.  **Cleaning and Grading:** Remove all inert matter (chaff, dust, stones), broken seeds, shriveled seeds, and weed seeds. Cleaned seeds store better and longer.
3.  **Sound Storage Structure:**
    *   Store in clean, dry, well-ventilated, rodent-proof, and insect-proof godowns or bins.
    *   Ensure the storage area is free from cracks and crevices that can harbor pests.
    *   Elevate bags on wooden pallets to prevent moisture absorption from the floor.
4.  **Pest Management in Storage:**
    *   **Sanitation:** Thoroughly clean the storage structure before introducing new grain.
    *   **Prophylactic Treatment:** Spray the inner walls, floor, and outer surface of bags with **Malathion** 50 EC (10 ml/L water) 7-10 days before storage.
    *   **Fumigation:** For large-scale storage and severe infestations, fumigation with **Aluminium phosphide** tablets (1-2 tablets per tonne of grain) can be done. **This must only be carried out by trained personnel under strict supervision due to its highly toxic nature.**
    *   **Hermetic Storage:** Use of airtight containers or specialized hermetic bags can effectively control insect pests by depleting oxygen.
5.  **Regular Inspection:** Periodically inspect stored lentils for signs of insect infestation, rodent damage, moisture ingress, or fungal growth. Take corrective measures immediately.
6.  **Temperature and Humidity Control:** Store lentils in a cool, dry environment. Lower temperatures and humidity significantly extend storage life by slowing down metabolic processes and pest activity.
