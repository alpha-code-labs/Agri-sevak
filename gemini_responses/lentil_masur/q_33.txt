As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified strategies for weed control in Lentil (Masur) in Haryana. Effective weed management is crucial for maximizing lentil yield.

**General Principles for Weed Management in Lentil:**
*   **Integrated Weed Management:** Combine cultural practices (timely sowing, proper seedbed preparation, crop rotation, clean seed) with chemical control for best results.
*   **Timely Application:** Herbicide efficacy is highly dependent on correct timing and application method.
*   **Adequate Water Volume:** Always use sufficient water (typically 200-300 litres per acre) for uniform spray coverage.
*   **Nozzle Type:** Use a flat fan nozzle for herbicide application.

**Weed Control Strategies:**

**A. Pre-emergence Herbicides (Applied within 0-3 days after sowing):**
These herbicides provide control of a wide range of broadleaf and narrowleaf weeds by forming a chemical barrier in the soil.

*   For broad-spectrum control of broadleaf and narrowleaf weeds:
    *   Apply **Pendimethalin** 30% EC at 3.3 litres per acre, or **Pendimethalin** 38.7% CS at 2.6 litres per acre.
    *   Alternatively, apply **Fluchloralin** 45% EC at 1.6-2.2 litres per acre, incorporated into the soil before sowing or immediately after sowing.

**B. Post-emergence Herbicides (Applied when weeds are at 2-4 leaf stage, typically 20-30 days after sowing):**
These herbicides are applied after the crop and weeds have emerged.

*   For control of broadleaf weeds (including Bathu) and some narrowleaf weeds, and specifically for parasitic weeds like Amarbail and Orobanche:
    *   Apply **Imazethapyr** 10% SL at 750-1000 ml per acre. This is a critical herbicide for parasitic weed management in lentil.
*   For specific control of narrowleaf weeds (grasses) like Phalaris minor:
    *   Apply **Quizalofop-p-ethyl** 5% EC at 1.0 litre per acre.
    *   Alternatively, apply **Fenoxaprop-p-ethyl** 9% EC at 550-660 ml per acre.

**Specific Weed Control Recommendations:**

1.  **Broad leaf weeds (e.g., Bathu - *Chenopodium album*):**
    *   **Pre-emergence:** **Pendimethalin** or **Fluchloralin** as mentioned above.
    *   **Post-emergence:** **Imazethapyr** 10% SL at 750-1000 ml per acre.

2.  **Narrow leaf weeds (e.g., Phalaris minor - *Gulli danda*):**
    *   **Pre-emergence:** **Pendimethalin** or **Fluchloralin** as mentioned above.
    *   **Post-emergence:** **Quizalofop-p-ethyl** 5% EC at 1.0 litre per acre, or **Fenoxaprop-p-ethyl** 9% EC at 550-660 ml per acre.

3.  **Amarbail (*Cuscuta spp.*):**
    *   **Post-emergence:** This parasitic weed is a major threat. Apply **Imazethapyr** 10% SL at 750-1000 ml per acre when Amarbail seedlings are small and before they attach firmly to the lentil plants. Early detection and application are crucial.

4.  **Orobanche (Broomrape - *Orobanche spp.*):**
    *   **Post-emergence:** This parasitic weed can severely impact lentil. Apply **Imazethapyr** 10% SL at 750-1000 ml per acre. The timing is critical, usually when Orobanche shoots start emerging from the soil or even slightly before, based on previous field history.

5.  **Congress grass (*Parthenium hysterophorus*):**
    *   Congress grass (Parthenium hysterophorus) is generally not considered a primary competitive weed in lentil fields during the Rabi season in Haryana. While it may be present in the general vicinity, specific herbicide recommendations for its control *within* lentil are not commonly provided as it does not typically pose a major threat to lentil yield. The general broadleaf herbicides like **Imazethapyr** might offer some suppression if Parthenium is present at an early stage.

Always read and follow the instructions on the herbicide label carefully for safe and effective use.
