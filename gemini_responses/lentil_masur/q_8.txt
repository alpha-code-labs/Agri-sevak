Dear Farmer,

Controlling sucking pests in Lentil (Masur) is crucial for a healthy crop and good yield. Here's a scientifically verified approach for Haryana conditions:

**Pests Affecting Lentil (Masur):**
Aphids, Leafhopper, Whitefly, and Thrips are known to affect Lentil (Masur) in our region.
Psylla: This is not known to affect Lentil (Masur).

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategy:**

1.  **Monitoring:** Regularly scout your fields, especially the undersides of leaves and tender shoots, for the presence of these pests. Early detection is key.
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Timely Sowing:** Sow lentil at the recommended time to avoid peak pest incidence periods.
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep fields free of weeds, as many weeds act as alternate hosts for these pests.
    *   **Balanced Nutrition:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush growth, making plants more attractive to sucking pests.
3.  **Biological Control:** Encourage natural enemies like ladybird beetles, lacewings, and hoverfly larvae, which prey on aphids and other soft-bodied insects. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides unless absolutely necessary to conserve these beneficial insects.
4.  **Chemical Control (When pest populations reach economic threshold levels):**
    When pest incidence is high and natural enemies are insufficient, chemical intervention may be required. Always ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.

    **Recommended Insecticides (CIBRC Approved):**

    *   For Aphids, Leafhopper, Whitefly, and Thrips:
        *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: 125 ml per acre (in 200-400 litres of water).
        *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: 50-100 g per acre (in 200-400 litres of water).
        *   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP: 50-100 g per acre (in 200-400 litres of water).
        *   **Dimethoate** 30% EC: 330-660 ml per acre (in 200-400 litres of water).
        *   **Oxydemeton-methyl** 25% EC: 500 ml per acre (in 200-400 litres of water).

    **Important Considerations:**
    *   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully, including dosage, application method, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
    *   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in pests.
    *   Apply insecticides preferably in the morning or evening to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
