As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified seed and soil treatment processes for Lentil (Masur) cultivation in Haryana:

### Recommended Seed Treatment Process for Lentil (Masur)

Seed treatment is crucial for protecting lentil seeds from seed-borne and early soil-borne diseases, and for enhancing nutrient availability through beneficial microbial associations.

**Step 1: Fungicidal Treatment**
This step protects against common fungal diseases such as wilt (Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. lentis), root rot, and damping-off. Apply one of the following fungicides first:

*   **Carbendazim 50% WP** at 2.0-2.5 grams per kilogram of seed.
*   **Thiram 75% WS** at 2.5-3.0 grams per kilogram of seed.
*   A combination product like **Carboxin 37.5% + Thiram 37.5% DS** at 2.5-3.0 grams per kilogram of seed is also highly effective for broad-spectrum protection.

**Method:** Mix the chosen fungicide thoroughly with the lentil seeds. This can be done using a seed treatment drum or by spreading the seeds on a clean, impervious surface and mixing by hand until all seeds are uniformly coated. Allow the treated seeds to dry slightly in the shade before proceeding to the next step.

**Step 2: Bio-fertilizer Treatment**
This step is essential for improving nitrogen fixation and phosphorus availability, which are vital for lentil growth and yield. Apply these bio-fertilizers *after* the fungicidal treatment to ensure the viability of the beneficial microbes.

*   **Rhizobium inoculant** (specific for lentil) at 100-200 grams per 10-15 kilograms of seed (approximately 10-20 grams per kilogram of seed).
*   **Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria (PSB) inoculant** at 100-200 grams per 10-15 kilograms of seed (approximately 10-20 grams per kilogram of seed).

**Method:** Prepare a slurry by mixing the recommended quantities of **Rhizobium** and **PSB** inoculants with a small amount of jaggery (gur) solution (10% solution) or plain water. Mix this slurry uniformly with the fungicide-treated seeds. Ensure an even coating on all seeds. Dry the treated seeds in the shade for 30 minutes to an hour before sowing. For best results, sow the seeds within 24 hours of bio-fertilizer treatment.

### Recommended Soil Treatment Process for Lentil (Masur)

Soil treatment focuses on managing soil-borne diseases and pests, particularly in fields with a history of such issues.

**1. Bio-fungicide Application (for soil-borne diseases):**
This is recommended to manage soil-borne diseases like wilt and root rot, especially in fields where these problems have been observed previously.

*   **Trichoderma viride 1% WP** or **Trichoderma harzianum 1% WP** at 2.5-5.0 kilograms per acre.

**Method:** Mix the recommended quantity of **Trichoderma** formulation with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost. Moisten the mixture and keep it covered in a cool, shaded place for 7-10 days, turning it periodically to ensure uniform multiplication of the fungus. Broadcast this enriched FYM uniformly in the field before the last ploughing or at the time of sowing.

**2. Insecticide Application (for soil pests, if necessary):**
This treatment is recommended only if there is a known history of soil insect pests such as termites or cutworms in the field.

*   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** at 2.0-2.5 litres per acre.
*   **Fipronil 0.3% GR** at 6.0-8.0 kilograms per acre.

**Method:** Apply the chosen insecticide uniformly to the soil and incorporate it well before sowing. For **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC**, it can be mixed with 200-400 litres of water and sprayed evenly over the soil surface, followed by light incorporation. For **Fipronil 0.3% GR**, broadcast the granules evenly and incorporate them into the soil during the final land preparation.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (gloves, mask, etc.) while handling chemicals and bio-agents.
*   Read and follow the instructions and safety precautions provided on the product labels.
*   Store chemicals and bio-agents in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and out of reach of children and livestock.
*   For specific local recommendations or severe pest/disease outbreaks, consult with your nearest Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or HAU extension specialist.
