As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the use of growth regulators and micronutrients in Lentil (Masur) for Haryana conditions:

*   **Ethrel (Ethephon)**:
    This is not known to affect Lentil (Masur) as a recommended growth regulator for yield enhancement under Haryana conditions.

*   **2,4-D**:
    While 2,4-D is a plant hormone (auxin), its use as a growth regulator at very low concentrations for yield enhancement in Lentil (Masur) is not a standard recommendation. Its primary use in lentil is as a selective herbicide. Therefore, this is not known to affect Lentil (Masur) as a recommended growth regulator for yield enhancement.

*   **Boron**:
    Boron is an essential micronutrient crucial for pollen viability, flower formation, and seed set in lentil. Its application is recommended if soil tests indicate a deficiency or in areas historically prone to boron deficiency.

    *   **Foliar Application (Recommended for deficiency):**
        *   Apply at the pre-flowering stage.
        *   **Borax (Disodium tetraborate decahydrate)**: 0.2% solution (2 g per litre of water).
        *   **Boric acid**: 0.1% solution (1 g per litre of water).
        *   Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage. A second spray can be given 15 days after the first if deficiency symptoms persist or flowering is prolonged.

    *   **Soil Application (If severe deficiency is confirmed by soil test):**
        *   Apply at the time of sowing.
        *   **Borax (Disodium tetraborate decahydrate)**: 1.0 kg per acre.
        *   Mix with sand or fertilizer for uniform distribution.
