As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm the following regarding the control of Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies in Lentil (Masur) in Haryana:

*   **Beetles (field):** While some generalist leaf-feeding beetles might occasionally be observed, beetles are not considered a major economic field pest of Lentil (Masur) in Haryana that typically requires specific chemical control measures. The primary beetle pest, the pulse beetle (*Callosobruchus spp.*), is a storage pest and not a field pest.
    *   This is not known to significantly affect Lentil (Masur) in the field.

*   **Weevils (field):** Weevils are generally not considered a major economic field pest of Lentil (Masur) in Haryana.
    *   This is not known to significantly affect Lentil (Masur) in the field.

*   **Sawflies:** Sawflies, such as the mustard sawfly (*Athalia lugens proxima*), are pests primarily of cruciferous crops (e.g., mustard, cabbage) and do not infest leguminous crops like Lentil (Masur).
    *   This is not known to affect Lentil (Masur).
