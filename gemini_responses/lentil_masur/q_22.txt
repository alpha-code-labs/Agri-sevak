As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), here are the recommended cultivation practices for Lentil (Masur) in Haryana:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   Lentil should be sown in rows using a seed drill for uniform depth and spacing.
    *   **Conventional Tillage:** Sowing can be done after proper land preparation (1-2 ploughings followed by planking).
    *   **Zero Tillage:** In areas following a rice-wheat cropping system, zero-tillage sowing using a zero-till drill is highly recommended. This conserves soil moisture, reduces cultivation costs, and allows for timely sowing.
*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   The optimal planting depth for lentil is **3-5 cm**. Deeper sowing can lead to poor emergence and reduced plant stand.
*   **Spacing:**
    *   **Row-to-row spacing:** Maintain a distance of **22.5 cm to 30 cm** between rows.
    *   **Plant-to-plant spacing:** This is generally managed by the seed rate and drill calibration to achieve an optimal plant population.
*   **Seed Dose (Seed Rate):**
    *   The seed rate varies depending on the seed size and sowing time:
        *   **Small-seeded varieties:** **60-80 kg/acre**.
        *   **Bold-seeded varieties:** **80-100 kg/acre**.
        *   For **late sowing** or under **zero-tillage conditions**, a slightly higher seed rate (around 10-15% more) may be beneficial to ensure an adequate plant stand.
