As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for managing growth issues in Lentil (Masur) in Haryana:

Effective management of growth issues in Lentil begins with understanding the underlying causes, which often relate to soil health, nutrient availability, water management, and environmental factors. Regular field monitoring and soil testing are crucial for accurate diagnosis.

Here's how to manage the specified growth issues:

### 1. Slow Growth

Slow growth in Lentil can be indicative of various deficiencies or stresses.

**Possible Causes:**
*   Nutrient deficiencies (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, Zinc, Iron, Sulphur).
*   Water stress (either too little or too much).
*   Soil compaction or poor soil structure.
*   Low temperatures during critical growth stages.
*   Poor seed quality or inadequate seed treatment.

**Management Strategies:**
*   **Soil Testing:** Conduct a comprehensive soil test before sowing to determine nutrient status and soil pH.
*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Nitrogen (N):** Lentil is a legume and fixes atmospheric nitrogen. However, an initial starter dose may be beneficial if soil N is very low or nodulation is expected to be poor. Apply 15-20 kg N per acre (e.g., through **Urea**).
    *   **Phosphorus (P):** Crucial for root development and overall growth. Apply 40-60 kg P2O5 per acre (e.g., through **Di-ammonium phosphate (DAP)** or **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)**) as a basal dose.
    *   **Potassium (K):** Apply 20 kg K2O per acre (e.g., through **Muriate of Potash**) if soil test indicates low levels.
    *   **Zinc (Zn):** Zinc deficiency is common in Haryana. Apply 20-25 kg **Zinc sulfate** per acre as a basal soil application, or if deficiency appears during growth, foliar spray with 0.5% **Zinc sulfate** solution (5 g/L water) at 30-45 days after sowing.
    *   **Sulphur (S):** Apply 20 kg S per acre (e.g., through **Gypsum** or **Elemental sulphur**) as a basal dose, especially in light-textured soils.
*   **Water Management:** Provide light and timely irrigation, especially during critical stages like branching, flowering, and pod development. Avoid waterlogging.
*   **Soil Health:** Improve soil organic matter content through farmyard manure or compost application. Ensure proper tillage to reduce compaction.
*   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds with recommended Rhizobium inoculant and fungicides to ensure good germination and early vigor.

### 2. Yellow Growth (Chlorosis)

Yellowing of leaves (chlorosis) can be a symptom of specific nutrient deficiencies or environmental stress.

**Possible Causes:**
*   **Nitrogen deficiency:** General yellowing, often starting from older leaves.
*   **Iron deficiency:** Interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins), typically on younger leaves. Common in alkaline soils.
*   **Zinc deficiency:** Stunted growth, yellowing, and smaller leaves.
*   **Sulphur deficiency:** General yellowing, often starting from younger leaves.
*   **Waterlogging:** Impairs root function and nutrient uptake.
*   **Root diseases:** Can lead to nutrient uptake issues and yellowing.

**Management Strategies:**
*   **Diagnosis:** Observe the pattern of yellowing (which leaves, interveinal or general) and consider soil test results to identify the specific deficiency.
*   **Nutrient Application (Foliar Sprays for quick correction):**
    *   **Nitrogen:** If N deficiency is confirmed, foliar spray with 2% **Urea** solution (20 g/L water).
    *   **Iron:** If Iron deficiency, foliar spray with 0.5% **Ferrous sulfate** solution (5 g/L water) mixed with 0.1% citric acid.
    *   **Zinc:** If Zinc deficiency, foliar spray with 0.5% **Zinc sulfate** solution (5 g/L water).
    *   **Sulphur:** If Sulphur deficiency, foliar spray with 0.5% **Potassium sulfate** or **Magnesium sulfate** solution.
*   **Drainage:** Ensure proper field drainage to prevent waterlogging, especially after irrigation or heavy rainfall.

### 3. Excessive Height

Excessive height can lead to lodging, making harvesting difficult and reducing yield.

**Possible Causes:**
*   High nitrogen levels in the soil.
*   High plant density (overcrowding).
*   Shading from weeds or other crops.
*   Variety characteristic (some varieties are naturally taller).

**Management Strategies:**
*   **Nitrogen Management:** Avoid excessive application of nitrogen fertilizers. Lentil, being a legume, has lower N requirements.
*   **Optimal Plant Density:** Maintain recommended plant spacing (e.g., 20-22.5 cm row spacing and 5-7 cm plant-to-plant distance) to prevent overcrowding and competition for light.
*   **Weed Control:** Implement timely weed management practices to reduce competition for light and nutrients.
*   **Variety Selection:** Choose semi-dwarf or lodging-resistant varieties suitable for Haryana conditions.

### 4. Excessive Flowering

"Excessive flowering" is generally a positive sign, indicating a healthy plant with good reproductive potential. However, if it leads to poor pod set or is a result of premature stress-induced flowering, then the underlying issues need to be addressed.

**Possible Causes (if problematic, i.e., poor pod set follows):**
*   Nutrient imbalances, particularly Boron deficiency.
*   Water stress during flowering.
*   High temperatures during flowering.
*   Pest damage to flowers.

**Management Strategies (focused on ensuring good pod set and retention):**
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure adequate and balanced supply of all essential nutrients, especially Phosphorus and Potassium, which are crucial for flowering and pod development.
*   **Boron (B):** Boron deficiency can lead to poor pollen viability, flower drop, and poor pod set. If deficiency is suspected, foliar spray with 0.1% **Borax** solution (1 g/L water) or 0.05% **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (0.5 g/L water) at the pre-flowering stage.
*   **Water Management:** Provide adequate soil moisture during the flowering and pod development stages. Avoid both drought stress and waterlogging.
*   **Temperature Management:** While direct control over ambient temperature is not possible, selecting appropriate sowing times can help avoid extreme temperatures during critical reproductive stages.

Always consult with local agricultural experts or HAU extension services for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions.
