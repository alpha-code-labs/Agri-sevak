Lentil (Masur) is typically a direct-sown crop and is generally not transplanted. This is because lentil seedlings are sensitive to root disturbance, and direct sowing has proven to be the most efficient and effective method for establishing a healthy crop stand, leading to optimal yield under Haryana conditions.

Therefore, instead of transplantation, the ideal practices for direct sowing of Lentil (Masur) are as follows:

**1. Ideal Sowing Time (equivalent to 'Transplantation Time'):**
*   The optimal sowing window for lentil in Haryana is from **mid-October to mid-November**. Early sowing (mid-October) is generally preferred for higher yields, especially for long-duration varieties.

**2. Ideal Sowing Distance (equivalent to 'Transplantation Distance'):**
*   **Row-to-row distance:** Maintain a spacing of **20-22.5 cm** between rows.
*   **Plant-to-plant distance:** Aim for a plant-to-plant distance of **5-7 cm** within the row to achieve the desired plant population.

**3. Ideal Sowing Process (equivalent to 'Transplantation Process'):**
*   **Seedbed Preparation:** A well-prepared, fine, and firm seedbed is crucial for good germination and emergence. One deep ploughing followed by 2-3 harrowing operations is generally sufficient. Ensure adequate soil moisture at the time of sowing.
*   **Sowing Method:** Lentil seeds are best sown using a seed drill. This ensures uniform depth and spacing, which is critical for a good plant stand.
*   **Sowing Depth:** Sow seeds at a depth of **3-5 cm**. Shallow sowing can lead to poor germination due to moisture stress, while deep sowing can delay emergence and reduce the plant stand.
*   **Seed Rate:** The recommended seed rate varies depending on the variety and seed size:
    *   For normal-seeded varieties: **60-80 kg/acre**.
    *   For bold-seeded varieties: **80-100 kg/acre**.
*   **Seed Treatment:** To protect against seed-borne diseases and enhance nitrogen fixation, seed treatment is highly recommended:
    *   **Fungicide Treatment:** Treat seeds with a suitable fungicide to protect against early seedling diseases.
        *   **Carbendazim** @ 1 g/kg seed + **Thiram** @ 2 g/kg seed, OR
        *   **Carboxin** @ 2 g/kg seed + **Thiram** @ 2 g/kg seed.
    *   **Rhizobium Inoculation:** After fungicide treatment, inoculate seeds with an appropriate strain of *Rhizobium leguminosarum* specific for lentil, especially if lentil has not been grown in the field recently. Use **500 g of Rhizobium culture** per **40-50 kg of seed**. This should be done just before sowing.
