As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concerns regarding crop health. The terms you have used, "Fruit bursting", "Leaf burning/melting", and "Hardness in fruit", are not standard scientific classifications for specific diseases or pests affecting Lentil (Masur). However, we can address the underlying issues that these terms might represent as abiotic stresses or physiological conditions common in lentil cultivation in Haryana.

**1. Addressing "Fruit bursting" (interpreted as Pod Shattering/Dehiscence):**

While "fruit bursting" is not a standard term for lentil, premature pod splitting or shattering (dehiscence) is a known issue that leads to significant yield loss. This is often influenced by genetic factors and environmental conditions, particularly rapid drying after rain or strong winds.

*   **Control Measures for Pod Shattering:**
    *   **Variety Selection:** Choose improved lentil varieties known for their resistance to pod shattering. Consult HAU recommendations for specific varieties suitable for Haryana.
    *   **Timely Harvesting:** Harvest the crop at physiological maturity (when pods turn yellowish-brown and seeds are firm) to minimize shattering. Delaying harvest, especially during hot and dry conditions, significantly increases shattering risk.
    *   **Harvesting Method:** Use appropriate harvesting techniques. Direct combining can be effective if the crop is uniformly mature and shattering-resistant. For susceptible varieties, windrowing followed by threshing can reduce losses.
    *   **Irrigation Management:** Avoid extreme dry-wet cycles towards maturity, which can induce shattering.

**2. Addressing "Leaf burning/melting" (interpreted as Symptoms of Abiotic Stress):**

Leaf burning or necrosis (tissue death) can be a symptom of various abiotic stresses rather than a specific "physical damage" condition. These stresses are common in Haryana and can severely impact lentil growth and yield.

*   **Potential Causes and Control Measures:**
    *   **Heat Stress:**
        *   **Timely Sowing:** Sow lentil varieties at the recommended time (typically October-November in Haryana) to ensure the reproductive phase avoids peak summer temperatures.
        *   **Heat-Tolerant Varieties:** Cultivate varieties identified as tolerant to higher temperatures by HAU.
        *   **Irrigation:** Provide light and timely irrigation during critical growth stages, especially if temperatures are rising.
    *   **Drought Stress:**
        *   **Irrigation:** Ensure adequate soil moisture, particularly during flowering and pod development. One or two light irrigations can be crucial in rainfed areas or during dry spells.
        *   **Mulching:** Apply crop residue as mulch to conserve soil moisture, suppress weeds, and reduce soil temperature fluctuations.
    *   **Salinity/Sodicity:**
        *   **Soil Testing:** Conduct regular soil tests to identify salinity or sodicity issues in your field.
        *   **Salt-Tolerant Varieties:** Use lentil varieties known to perform better under saline conditions.
        *   **Soil Amendments:** For sodic soils, apply **Gypsum** as per soil test recommendations to improve soil structure and facilitate leaching of salts.
        *   **Leaching:** If good quality irrigation water is available, pre-sowing irrigation followed by drainage can help leach salts from the root zone.
    *   **Nutrient Toxicity (e.g., Boron, Chloride):**
        *   **Soil Testing:** Identify specific nutrient imbalances or toxicities.
        *   **Water Quality:** Use irrigation water with low levels of toxic ions.
    *   **Herbicide Injury:**
        *   **Correct Application:** Ensure herbicides are applied at the correct dose, timing, and with properly calibrated equipment.
        *   **Avoid Drift:** Take precautions to prevent herbicide drift from adjacent fields, which can cause severe damage.

**3. Addressing "Hardness in fruit":**

This is not known to affect Lentil (Masur) as a form of "physical damage" during its growth phase. If this refers to the hardness of the seeds post-harvest (e.g., hard-to-cook phenomenon or hard seed coat dormancy), these are quality issues influenced by genetics, storage conditions, and processing, rather than a "physical damage" to the growing plant.
