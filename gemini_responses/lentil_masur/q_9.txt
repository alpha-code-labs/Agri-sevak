Mites, including Red Spider Mite (Tetranychus urticae) and Rust Mites (e.g., *Aceria* spp.), are known to affect Lentil (Masur) crops, particularly during dry and warm periods. Early detection and timely intervention are crucial for effective management.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Approach:**

1.  **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect the underside of leaves, especially during dry spells, for the presence of mites, fine webbing (characteristic of red spider mites), or bronzing/rusting symptoms (for rust mites).
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Ensure adequate irrigation, as water stress can exacerbate mite infestations.
    *   Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can promote lush growth attractive to mites.
    *   Remove crop residues after harvest to reduce overwintering sites.

**Chemical Control (Acaricides):**

When mite populations reach damaging levels, chemical control may be necessary. Always ensure thorough coverage, especially on the underside of leaves. Rotate chemicals with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

Here are some CIBRC-approved technical chemicals effective against mites in field crops, which can be used in Lentil:

*   **Spiromesifen** (e.g., 22.9% SC formulation):
    *   Dosage: 125 ml per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water.
*   **Propargite** (e.g., 57% EC formulation):
    *   Dosage: 500 ml per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water.
*   **Fenpyroximate** (e.g., 5% SC formulation):
    *   Dosage: 200-300 ml per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water.
*   **Abamectin** (e.g., 1.9% EC formulation):
    *   Dosage: 150-200 ml per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water.
*   **Sulphur** (Wettable Powder, e.g., 80% WP formulation):
    *   Dosage: 1.5 - 2.0 kg per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water. Sulphur is effective against mites and also helps control powdery mildew.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Spray Volume:** Ensure adequate spray volume (200-300 litres per acre) for thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where mites reside.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in mite populations.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying. Follow all instructions and safety precautions mentioned on the product label.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Observe the recommended pre-harvest interval (PHI) for each chemical to ensure the produce is safe for consumption. This information is typically provided on the product label.
*   **Local Recommendations:** Always consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for the most current and specific recommendations for your region and crop stage.
