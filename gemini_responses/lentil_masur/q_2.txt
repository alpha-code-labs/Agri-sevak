As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling rust diseases in Lentil (Masur) in Haryana.

The primary rust disease affecting Lentil (Masur) is **Lentil Rust**, caused by the fungus *Uromyces viciae-fabae*. The pustules of this rust are typically reddish-brown, which might be referred to as "Red Rust" in common parlance.

Regarding the other rust types mentioned:

*   **Black Rust (Stem Rust):** This is not known to affect Lentil (Masur). It primarily affects cereals like wheat.
*   **Brown Rust (Leaf Rust):** This is not known to affect Lentil (Masur). It primarily affects cereals like wheat.
*   **Yellow Rust (Stripe Rust):** This is not known to affect Lentil (Masur). It primarily affects cereals like wheat.
*   **White Rust:** This is not known to affect Lentil (Masur). It primarily affects cruciferous crops like mustard.

Therefore, our focus will be on the control of Lentil Rust (*Uromyces viciae-fabae*).

### Control Measures for Lentil Rust (*Uromyces viciae-fabae*)

Effective management of lentil rust involves a combination of cultural practices and timely chemical interventions.

#### 1. Cultural Practices:

*   **Resistant Varieties:** Cultivate rust-resistant or tolerant varieties recommended for Haryana. Consult your local Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or HAU for the latest recommendations.
*   **Timely Sowing:** Sow lentil crops at the optimum time (typically mid-October to mid-November in Haryana). Late-sown crops are more susceptible to rust due to favorable environmental conditions (high humidity, moderate temperatures) during their reproductive stage.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops to reduce inoculum build-up in the soil.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected crop debris after harvest to reduce the primary source of inoculum for the next season.
*   **Balanced Fertilization:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, as it can lead to lush vegetative growth, making plants more susceptible to rust. Apply phosphorus and potassium as per soil test recommendations.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Maintain recommended plant spacing to ensure good air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce humidity and fungal development.

#### 2. Chemical Control:

Fungicides should be applied preventively if rust is anticipated, or at the first appearance of symptoms, especially during the flowering and pod-filling stages. Repeat applications may be necessary depending on disease severity and weather conditions.

*   **Preventive Spray:**
    *   **Mancozeb 75% WP:** Apply at a rate of 600-800 g per acre mixed in 200-400 litres of water.
*   **Curative/Systemic Spray (at first appearance of symptoms):**
    *   **Propiconazole 25% EC:** Apply at a rate of 250 ml per acre mixed in 200-400 litres of water.
    *   **Tebuconazole 25.9% EC:** Apply at a rate of 250-300 ml per acre mixed in 200-400 litres of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:** Apply at a rate of 200 ml per acre mixed in 200-400 litres of water.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the fungicide label for correct dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage during spraying.
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of fungicide resistance.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and the prevailing disease situation.
