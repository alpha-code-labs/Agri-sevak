Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I advise that addressing micronutrient deficiencies in Lentil (Masur) is crucial for optimal yield and quality. The first and most important step is always to conduct a comprehensive soil test to accurately diagnose the specific deficiencies and their severity in your field. This will help in precise and efficient nutrient management.

Here's how to address the common micronutrient deficiencies in Lentil:

### General Recommendation:
For all foliar applications, ensure good spray coverage and apply during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late afternoon) to avoid scorching and maximize absorption. Use sufficient water volume (e.g., 200-250 litres per acre) for thorough coverage.

### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

Zinc deficiency is widespread in Haryana soils and significantly impacts lentil growth and yield.
*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, small leaves (little leaf symptom), interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, and bronzing of older leaves.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Soil Application (Prophylactic/Severe Deficiency):**
        *   Apply **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (21% Zn) at 25 kg/acre, or **Zinc sulphate monohydrate** (33% Zn) at 15 kg/acre, broadcast and incorporated into the soil before sowing.
    *   **Foliar Application (Corrective):**
        *   Spray 0.5% solution of **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (5 g/L of water) along with 0.25% (2.5 g/L) of unslaked lime (calcium hydroxide) to neutralize acidity.
        *   Alternatively, spray 0.1% solution of **Zinc EDTA** (1 g/L of water).
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, starting from the vegetative growth stage when symptoms appear.

### 2. Iron (Fe) Deficiency

Iron deficiency, often called "lime-induced chlorosis," can occur in lentil, especially in high pH (alkaline) and calcareous soils common in Haryana.
*   **Symptoms:** Prominent interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on young leaves, with veins remaining green. In severe cases, the entire leaf may turn yellow or even white.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Foliar Application (Corrective):**
        *   Spray 0.5-1.0% solution of **Ferrous sulphate heptahydrate** (5-10 g/L of water).
        *   Alternatively, spray 0.1% solution of **Ferrous EDTA** (1 g/L of water).
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 7-10 day intervals, starting as soon as symptoms are observed.

### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

Boron is crucial for flowering, pollen viability, and seed setting in lentil. Deficiency can lead to poor pod formation.
*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, death of growing points, abnormal or cracked stems, poor flowering, and reduced pod and seed set.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Soil Application (Severe Deficiency, based on soil test):**
        *   Apply **Borax (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate)** at 1-2 kg/acre, broadcast and incorporated before sowing.
    *   **Foliar Application (Corrective):**
        *   Spray 0.1-0.2% solution of **Borax (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate)** (1-2 g/L of water).
        *   Alternatively, spray 0.05-0.1% solution of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (0.5-1 g/L of water).
        *   Apply one spray at the pre-flowering or early flowering stage to ensure good pollen viability and pod set.

### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

While Calcium is a macronutrient, its deficiency can occur, though it's less common as a primary issue in lentil in Haryana, especially if gypsum or single super phosphate (SSP) is used.
*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, distorted new leaves, necrosis (death) of young tissues, and poor root development.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Foliar Application (Corrective):**
        *   Spray 0.5-1.0% solution of **Calcium nitrate** (5-10 g/L of water).
        *   Alternatively, spray 0.5-1.0% solution of **Calcium chloride** (5-10 g/L of water).
        *   Apply as needed, particularly during active growth stages.

### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

Magnesium is a macronutrient essential for photosynthesis. Deficiency can occur in sandy soils or soils with high potassium levels.
*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) of older leaves, with veins remaining green. In severe cases, leaves may show purplish discoloration.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Soil Application (Severe Deficiency, based on soil test):**
        *   Apply **Magnesium sulphate heptahydrate** at 10-20 kg/acre at the time of sowing.
    *   **Foliar Application (Corrective):**
        *   Spray 1-2% solution of **Magnesium sulphate heptahydrate** (10-20 g/L of water).
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, starting when symptoms appear.

### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

Manganese deficiency can affect lentil, particularly in high pH (alkaline) soils, which are prevalent in parts of Haryana.
*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis of young leaves, often accompanied by small necrotic (dead) spots, and stunted growth.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Foliar Application (Corrective):**
        *   Spray 0.5% solution of **Manganese sulphate monohydrate** (5 g/L of water).
        *   Alternatively, spray 0.1% solution of **Manganese EDTA** (1 g/L of water).
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 7-10 day intervals, starting when symptoms are first observed.

Always remember that these recommendations are general guidelines. For precise and effective management, a recent soil test report from a reputable laboratory is invaluable. Consult your local agricultural extension officer for tailored advice based on your specific field conditions.
