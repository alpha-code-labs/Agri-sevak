As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the maturity signs, harvesting time, and cutting process for Lentil (Masur) in Haryana:

### Maturity Signs for Lentil (Masur)

Lentil plants reach physiological maturity when the seeds have developed fully and the plant begins to senesce. Key signs include:

*   **Pod Colour Change:** The pods, which are initially green, will turn yellow, then light brown or straw-coloured.
*   **Seed Hardness:** The seeds inside the pods will become hard and firm. When pressed between fingers, they should not be easily dented.
*   **Leaf Drop and Stem Drying:** The lower leaves will start to yellow and drop, and the stems will begin to dry out and change from green to yellow or light brown.
*   **Moisture Content:** The seeds will typically have a moisture content of around 25-30% at physiological maturity, which will further reduce as they dry down in the field.

### Harvesting Time for Lentil (Masur)

The optimal time for harvesting lentils is crucial to minimize shattering losses and maintain seed quality.

*   **Ideal Stage:** Harvest when 70-80% of the pods have matured (turned yellow to light brown) and the plants have dried down sufficiently. The seeds should have a moisture content of approximately 12-15%. Harvesting earlier can lead to immature seeds and higher moisture content, while delaying can result in significant shattering losses, especially in dry and windy conditions.
*   **Weather Conditions:** Choose a period of dry weather for harvesting. Avoid harvesting immediately after rain or during periods of high humidity, as this can lead to seed spoilage and difficulty in threshing.
*   **Timing:** In Haryana, lentil harvesting typically occurs from late February to March, depending on the sowing time and variety.

### Cutting Process for Lentil (Masur)

The cutting process can be done manually or mechanically.

**1. Manual Harvesting:**

*   **Method:** Plants are cut close to the ground using sickles. This is a common practice for small landholdings or when labour is readily available.
*   **Bundling:** The cut plants are gathered into small bundles and left in the field for a few days to further dry and cure. This helps in uniform drying and makes threshing easier.
*   **Stacking:** The bundles are then transported to a threshing floor and stacked in a well-ventilated area, often on a raised platform, to prevent moisture absorption from the ground and protect from pests.

**2. Mechanical Harvesting (Combine Harvester):**

*   **Suitability:** Combine harvesters can be used for lentil harvesting, especially for larger areas. However, specific adjustments are required to minimize losses.
*   **Machine Settings:**
    *   **Reel Speed:** The reel speed should be slightly faster than the ground speed to gently pull the plants into the cutter bar without excessive shattering.
    *   **Cutter Bar Height:** Set the cutter bar as low as possible to capture maximum pods, as lentil plants are relatively short.
    *   **Cylinder Speed:** Reduce the cylinder speed (typically 400-600 revolutions per minute) and widen the concave clearance to prevent seed damage and splitting.
    *   **Fan Speed:** Adjust the fan speed to ensure proper cleaning without blowing out the lighter lentil seeds.
    *   **Sieves:** Use appropriate sieve settings to separate seeds from chaff effectively.
*   **Pre-Harvest Desiccation (Optional):** In some cases, if there is uneven maturity or significant green weed growth, a pre-harvest desiccant (e.g., **Paraquat Dichloride** at 0.5 kg a.i./acre or **Glyphosate** at 0.8-1.0 kg a.i./acre, applied 7-10 days before harvest) may be used to dry down the crop and weeds, facilitating mechanical harvesting. *Always ensure CIBRC approval and follow label instructions for any chemical application.*
*   **Moisture Monitoring:** Continuously monitor seed moisture content during mechanical harvesting. If the moisture is too high, it can lead to blockages and poor threshing. If too low, it can increase shattering.

After cutting, whether manually or mechanically, the harvested material is then threshed to separate the seeds from the pods and straw, followed by cleaning and drying to the safe storage moisture level (typically 9-10%).
