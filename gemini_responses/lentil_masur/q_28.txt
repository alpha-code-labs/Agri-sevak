As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for protecting your Lentil (Masur) crop from environmental stresses in Haryana:

**Protecting Lentil (Masur) from Environmental Stress**

Lentil (Masur) is a crucial rabi crop in Haryana, and its productivity can be significantly impacted by adverse environmental conditions. Here's how to protect your lentil crop from extreme cold, frost, heat/loo, and intense sunlight:

**1. Protection from Extreme Cold and Frost:**
*   **Timely Irrigation:** A light irrigation before a predicted cold wave or frost event can significantly reduce damage. Water has a higher specific heat capacity, and moist soil radiates heat slowly, keeping the soil and plant canopy warmer.
*   **Foliar Spray:** In anticipation of severe cold or frost, a foliar spray can help the plants cope:
    *   **Thiourea** (0.05% solution): Mix 500 g of **Thiourea** in 1000 litres of water per acre. Apply as a foliar spray. This helps in improving cold tolerance and recovery.
    *   Alternatively, a spray of **Potassium Nitrate** (0.5% solution): Mix 5 kg of **Potassium Nitrate** in 1000 litres of water per acre. This helps in strengthening cell walls and improving osmotic adjustment.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure adequate potassium (K) application as per soil test recommendations, as potassium improves the plant's ability to withstand cold stress.

**2. Protection from Heat (Loo) and Intense Sunlight:**
*   **Timely Irrigation:** Provide light and frequent irrigations during periods of high temperature, especially at flowering and pod development stages. This helps in cooling the canopy and maintaining turgor. Avoid water stress.
*   **Mulching:** Apply organic mulch (e.g., wheat straw, paddy straw) between rows. This helps in reducing soil temperature, conserving soil moisture, and suppressing weed growth, thereby mitigating the effects of heat and intense sunlight.
*   **Foliar Spray:** To mitigate the adverse effects of heat stress and intense sunlight:
    *   **Potassium Nitrate** (0.5% solution): Mix 5 kg of **Potassium Nitrate** in 1000 litres of water per acre. Apply during the onset of high temperatures. This helps in improving water use efficiency and overall plant resilience.
    *   Alternatively, a spray of **Urea** (2% solution): Mix 20 kg of **Urea** in 1000 litres of water per acre. This provides readily available nitrogen and helps in maintaining physiological activity under stress.
*   **Variety Selection and Sowing Time:** Opt for heat-tolerant lentil varieties and adjust sowing time to ensure that the critical flowering and pod-filling stages do not coincide with the peak heat period (late March to April) in Haryana. Early sowing (mid-October to early November) is generally recommended to escape terminal heat stress.
