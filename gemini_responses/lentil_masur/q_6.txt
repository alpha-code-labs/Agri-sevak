As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling viral diseases in Lentil (Masur) in Haryana:

First, let's address the specific viral conditions you've mentioned:

*   **Tristeza:** This is not known to affect Lentil (Masur). Citrus tristeza virus is specific to citrus crops.
*   **Stripe:** This is not known to affect Lentil (Masur). Stripe viruses are primarily associated with cereal crops.
*   **Yellow vein clearing:** While "yellow vein clearing" is a symptom, a distinct "Lentil yellow vein clearing virus" is not commonly recognized as a major lentil pathogen. However, symptoms of yellowing and vein clearing can be associated with other mosaic viruses that affect lentil.

The viral diseases that are known to affect Lentil (Masur) and for which control measures are relevant include:

*   **Leaf curl (e.g., Lentil leaf curl virus)**
*   **Mosaic (e.g., Pea mosaic virus, Bean yellow mosaic virus, Broad bean mosaic viruses)**
*   **Stunt virus (e.g., Pea stunt virus, Broad bean stunt virus)**

**General Principles for Viral Disease Control in Lentil:**

It is crucial to understand that there are no direct chemical cures for viral diseases once a plant is infected. Management strategies focus entirely on prevention, controlling the vectors (insects that transmit the viruses), and using resistant varieties.

**Recommended Control Measures:**

1.  **Resistant Varieties:**
    *   The most effective and economical method is to cultivate virus-resistant or tolerant lentil varieties recommended by HAU for Haryana. Consult your local Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or HAU extension services for the latest recommendations on suitable varieties for your specific region.

2.  **Vector Control (Controlling Insect Pests that Spread Viruses):**
    *   **Aphids** are the primary vectors for many mosaic and stunt viruses in lentil. **Whiteflies** can transmit some leaf curl viruses.
    *   **Seed Treatment:**
        *   Treat seeds with a systemic insecticide before sowing to protect young seedlings from sucking pests for the initial few weeks.
        *   **Imidacloprid** 600 FS @ 5-7 ml per kg seed
        *   **Thiamethoxam** 30 FS @ 5-7 ml per kg seed
    *   **Foliar Sprays (if vector population is high):**
        *   Monitor fields regularly for the presence of aphids or whiteflies. If populations are building up, apply appropriate insecticides.
        *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8 SL @ 0.5 ml per litre of water (100-125 ml per acre)
        *   **Thiamethoxam** 25 WG @ 0.2 g per litre of water (80-100 g per acre)
        *   **Acetamiprid** 20 SP @ 0.2 g per litre of water (80-100 g per acre)
        *   **Dimethoate** 30 EC @ 1.7 ml per litre of water (300-400 ml per acre)
        *   **Flonicamid** 50 WG @ 0.3 g per litre of water (60 g per acre)
        *   Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage. Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

3.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Use Healthy, Certified Seeds:** Always use seeds from a reliable, certified source to ensure they are virus-free.
    *   **Rogueing:** Regularly inspect your field. As soon as you notice any plants showing viral symptoms (e.g., curling, mosaic patterns, yellowing, stunting), carefully remove and destroy them away from the field. This prevents the virus from spreading to healthy plants.
    *   **Weed Management:** Many weeds act as alternate hosts for both viruses and their insect vectors. Keep your lentil fields and surrounding areas free of weeds.
    *   **Timely Sowing:** Sowing at the recommended time for your region can help the crop escape peak vector populations.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops to break the disease cycle.
    *   **Avoid Intercropping with Susceptible Crops:** Do not intercrop lentil with other pulse crops that are highly susceptible to the same viruses.
    *   **Border Cropping:** Planting a non-host crop (e.g., sorghum, maize) around the lentil field can act as a physical barrier, reducing the initial entry of insect vectors.

By implementing these integrated management strategies, you can significantly reduce the incidence and severity of viral diseases in your lentil crop.
