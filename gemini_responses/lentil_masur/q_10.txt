As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for managing pests in Lentil (Masur) in Haryana:

### Control of Borers and Caterpillars in Lentil (Masur)

Borers, particularly the Gram Pod Borer (*Helicoverpa armigera*), are a major pest of Lentil. The larvae (caterpillars) feed on leaves, flowers, and bore into developing pods, causing significant yield losses.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategy:**

1.  **Monitoring and Scouting:** Regularly monitor fields from flowering to pod development stage. Look for eggs, larvae, and feeding damage.
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Early Sowing:** Sowing lentil early can help the crop escape peak pest incidence.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove crop residues and weeds that can harbor pests.
    *   **Intercropping:** Intercropping with suitable crops (e.g., mustard) can sometimes act as a trap crop or enhance natural enemy populations.
3.  **Biological Control:**
    *   **Pheromone Traps:** Install pheromone traps at 5 traps/acre to monitor adult moth activity. This helps in timing insecticide applications.
    *   **Bird Perches:** Install bird perches (10-12 per acre) to encourage predatory birds to feed on larvae.
    *   **Biopesticides:** Apply *Helicoverpa armigera* Nuclear Polyhedrosis Virus (HaNPV) at 250-500 larval equivalents (LE) per acre during the early larval stages.
4.  **Chemical Control (When pest population exceeds Economic Threshold Level - ETL):**
    *   The ETL for pod borer in lentil is typically 1-2 larvae per meter row length or 5-10% pod damage.
    *   Apply insecticides during the early pod formation stage when larvae are small. Ensure thorough coverage.

    CIBRC approved technical chemical names for control of pod borer/caterpillars in Lentil:
    *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG: 220 g/acre
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC: 60 ml/acre
    *   **Indoxacarb** 14.5% SC: 200 ml/acre
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: 200 ml/acre

### Diamondback Moth (DBM) in Lentil (Masur)

This is not known to affect Lentil (Masur). Diamondback moth (*Plutella xylostella*) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops like cabbage, cauliflower, and mustard.

### Leaf Folder in Lentil (Masur)

This is not known to affect Lentil (Masur) as a significant pest. While some generalist caterpillars might occasionally fold leaves, there is no specific "leaf folder" species recognized as a major pest of Lentil.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the insecticide label carefully.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension specialists for the most current recommendations and specific advice for your farm conditions.
