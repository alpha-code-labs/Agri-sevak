Mites, particularly Red Spider Mite (Tetranychus urticae) and Rust Mite (various Eriophyid mites), can cause significant damage to potato crops in Haryana, especially during dry and warm weather conditions. As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend an integrated approach for effective control.

**Symptoms of Mite Infestation:**

*   **Red Spider Mite:** Initially, tiny yellow or white spots appear on the leaves. As infestation progresses, leaves turn bronze or reddish-brown, become brittle, and may drop prematurely. Fine webbing can be observed on the underside of leaves and between leaves, especially in severe cases.
*   **Rust Mite:** These mites are microscopic and not visible to the naked eye. Symptoms include bronzing or russeting of leaves, especially on the undersides, and stunted plant growth. Leaves may curl downwards.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Mites in Potato:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Proper Irrigation:** Maintain adequate soil moisture, as dry conditions favour mite multiplication. Overhead irrigation can help wash off mites and increase humidity, which is unfavourable for them.
    *   **Weed Management:** Remove weeds from and around potato fields, as many weeds can serve as alternate hosts for mites.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation to break the pest cycle.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Conserve natural enemies like predatory mites (e.g., *Amblyseius* species), ladybird beetles, and lacewings, which feed on pest mites. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

3.  **Chemical Control (Acaricides):**
    If mite populations reach economic threshold levels, chemical control may be necessary. Always rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development. Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where mites reside.

    The following CIBRC approved technical chemicals can be used:

    *   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** Apply 125 ml per acre in 200-250 litres of water.
    *   **Fenpyroximate 5% EC:** Apply 250-300 ml per acre in 200-250 litres of water.
    *   **Propargite 57% EC:** Apply 500-750 ml per acre in 200-250 litres of water.
    *   **Abamectin 1.9% EC:** Apply 150-200 ml per acre in 200-250 litres of water.
    *   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP:** Apply 1.5-2.0 kg per acre in 200-250 litres of water. (Effective against rust mites and also helps with powdery mildew).

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label carefully, including dosage, application method, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying.
*   Spray during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   Monitor your crop regularly for mite infestation to ensure timely intervention.
