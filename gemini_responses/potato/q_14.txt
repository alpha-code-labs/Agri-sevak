Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling soil pests like Termites and Root-knot Nematodes in Potato cultivation in Haryana.

It is crucial to adopt an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods for sustainable and effective control.

### 1. Control of Termites (e.g., *Odontotermes obesus*, *Microtermes obesi*) in Potato

Termites can cause significant damage to potato tubers, leading to reduced marketability and yield.

**Cultural Practices:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove all crop residues, stubble, and woody debris from the field, as these can serve as food sources and breeding sites for termites.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** Ploughing the field deeply during summer exposes termite colonies to sunlight and predators, disrupting their nests.
*   **Irrigation Management:** Adequate irrigation can deter termites, as they prefer drier conditions.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate potatoes with non-host crops like cereals (wheat, maize) to break the termite life cycle.

**Chemical Control (Pre-planting/Soil Application):**
For effective control, chemical treatment should be done before or at the time of planting.

*   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC:** Apply **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** at a rate of 2.0-2.5 litres per acre, mixed in 200-400 litres of water, as a pre-planting soil drench or spray. Incorporate it into the soil immediately after application.

### 2. Control of Root-knot Nematodes (*Meloidogyne* spp.) in Potato

Root-knot nematodes are a major threat to potato, causing galls on roots and tubers, leading to stunted growth, reduced yield, and poor tuber quality.

**Cultural Practices:**
*   **Crop Rotation:** This is the most effective cultural practice. Rotate potatoes with non-host crops such as cereals (wheat, barley, maize), marigold, or mustard for at least 2-3 years. Avoid solanaceous crops (tomato, brinjal, chilli) in rotation.
*   **Summer Ploughing/Solarization:** Deep ploughing during hot summer months exposes nematode eggs and larvae to lethal temperatures and desiccation. Soil solarization (covering moist soil with clear plastic sheets during peak summer) can also significantly reduce nematode populations.
*   **Use of Resistant Varieties:** If available and suitable for your region, planting nematode-resistant potato varieties can be highly effective.
*   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporating well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost can improve soil health and promote beneficial microorganisms that suppress nematodes.

**Chemical Control (Soil Application at Planting):**
Nematicides are applied to the soil to reduce nematode populations before or at planting.

*   **Fluensulfone 2% GR:** Apply **Fluensulfone 2% GR** at a rate of 20 kg per acre at the time of planting, by broadcasting and incorporating into the soil.
*   **Carbofuran 3% GR:** Alternatively, you can use **Carbofuran 3% GR** at a rate of 20-30 kg per acre, applied in furrows at planting and covered with soil.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the label instructions of the chemical product carefully, including dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and pest severity.
*   Regular soil testing for nematode populations can help in making informed management decisions.
