As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Potato cultivation in Haryana:

### Grasshopper

*   **Damage:** Grasshoppers are polyphagous pests that can cause significant defoliation by feeding on potato leaves and young stems, leading to reduced photosynthetic capacity and potential yield loss.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Cultural Practices:**
        *   Deep ploughing during summer can expose grasshopper eggs to predators and desiccation, thereby reducing their population.
        *   Maintaining field sanitation and removing weeds can reduce breeding sites and alternative food sources for grasshoppers.
    *   **Chemical Control (Apply when nymphs or adults are observed causing economic damage):**
        *   **Malathion** 50 EC at 1250 ml per acre in 500 litres of water.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5 EC at 200-250 ml per acre in 200-400 litres of water.
        *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20 EC at 1250 ml per acre in 500 litres of water.

### Painted bug

This is not known to affect Potato. Painted bug (Bagrada hilaris) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops like mustard, cabbage, and cauliflower.

### Red cotton bug

This is not known to affect Potato. Red cotton bug (Dysdercus cingulatus) is primarily a pest of cotton and other malvaceous plants.

### Black ants

This is not known to affect Potato as a direct pest causing damage to the plant or tubers. Black ants are generally considered secondary pests; they might protect other sap-sucking insects like aphids, or their presence might indicate other underlying issues. Direct control measures specifically for black ants causing damage to potato are usually not required. If their presence is a nuisance or they are associated with other pests, general field sanitation and control of the primary pest they might be protecting would be more appropriate.
