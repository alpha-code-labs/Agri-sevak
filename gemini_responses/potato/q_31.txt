As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I will provide scientifically verified advice for controlling these conditions in Potato, interpreting "fruit" as "tuber" for this crop. These are primarily physiological disorders or symptoms of environmental stress.

### Control of Physical Damage in Potato

**1. Tuber Cracking/Splitting (Interpreted from "Fruit bursting")**
This physiological disorder occurs when tubers grow rapidly after a period of stress, often due to irregular water supply or nutrient imbalances.

*   **Consistent Irrigation:** Maintain uniform soil moisture throughout the growing season, especially during tuber development. Avoid sudden heavy irrigation after a dry spell, which can cause rapid growth and cracking.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure adequate and balanced supply of essential nutrients.
    *   **Boron:** Deficiency can lead to cracking. Apply **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (e.g., 1-1.5 kg/acre as soil application or 1-2 g/L as foliar spray) or **Sodium tetraborate decahydrate** (Borax) (e.g., 4-6 kg/acre as soil application or 2-3 g/L as foliar spray) if deficiency is confirmed by soil testing.
    *   **Calcium:** Adequate calcium is crucial for cell wall integrity. Apply **Calcium nitrate** (e.g., 5-10 kg/acre as soil application or 5-10 g/L as foliar spray) or **Calcium chloride** (e.g., 2-4 g/L as foliar spray) if soil tests indicate low calcium or during critical growth stages.
*   **Variety Selection:** Choose potato varieties known to be less susceptible to cracking.
*   **Harvest Timing:** Harvest tubers at appropriate maturity to reduce susceptibility to cracking during handling.

**2. Leaf Burning/Melting**
This refers to symptoms of phytotoxicity (chemical burn), heat stress, or severe tissue collapse due to environmental factors.

*   **Preventing Chemical Burn (Phytotoxicity):**
    *   **Correct Dosage:** Always use the recommended dosage of pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers.
    *   **Proper Application:** Ensure uniform spray coverage and avoid spraying during high temperatures or strong sunlight. Apply during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening).
    *   **Equipment Calibration:** Regularly calibrate spray equipment to ensure accurate application rates.
    *   **Compatibility:** Avoid mixing incompatible chemicals.
*   **Managing Heat Stress/Sunburn:**
    *   **Adequate Irrigation:** Ensure sufficient soil moisture to help plants cope with high temperatures.
    *   **Canopy Management:** Maintain a healthy and dense foliage canopy to shade the soil and tubers, and protect lower leaves from direct sun.
    *   **Mulching:** Organic mulches can help regulate soil temperature and conserve moisture.
*   **Addressing Salinity Stress:**
    *   **Water Quality:** Use irrigation water with low salt content.
    *   **Drainage:** Ensure good soil drainage to prevent salt accumulation in the root zone.
    *   **Soil Amendments:** In sodic soils, apply **Gypsum** (Calcium sulfate dihydrate) (e.g., 2-5 tonnes/acre depending on soil test recommendations) to improve soil structure and leach out excess sodium.
*   **Note:** Severe "melting" of leaves can also be a symptom of aggressive diseases like Late Blight or bacterial soft rot under very humid conditions, which would require specific fungicidal or bactericidal treatments. However, focusing on physical damage, the above measures are relevant.

**3. Tuber Hardness (Interpreted from "Hardness in fruit")**
This condition often refers to physiological disorders like Internal Brown Spot (IBS) or heat necrosis, where parts of the tuber flesh become hard and discolored.

*   **Calcium Management:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Ensure adequate soil calcium levels through pre-plant application of **Gypsum** (Calcium sulfate dihydrate) (e.g., 2-5 tonnes/acre) or **Calcium nitrate** (e.g., 5-10 kg/acre) based on soil test recommendations.
    *   **Foliar Application:** During tuber initiation and bulking, foliar sprays of **Calcium chloride** (e.g., 2-4 g/L) or **Calcium nitrate** (e.g., 5-10 g/L) can be beneficial, especially in light soils or under dry conditions.
*   **Temperature Regulation:**
    *   **Irrigation:** Maintain consistent soil moisture to help cool the soil, especially during periods of high ambient temperatures.
    *   **Mulching:** Apply organic mulches to reduce soil temperature fluctuations.
    *   **Planting Depth:** Ensure adequate planting depth to protect developing tubers from direct heat.
*   **Variety Selection:** Choose potato varieties that are less susceptible to internal physiological disorders.
