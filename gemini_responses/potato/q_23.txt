As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified seed and soil treatment processes for potato cultivation in Haryana to manage common diseases and pests effectively:

### Recommended Seed Treatment Process for Potato

Seed treatment is crucial for protecting potato tubers from seed-borne diseases and providing early protection against soil-borne pathogens and sucking pests.

**Process:**
1.  Ensure seed tubers are healthy, free from cuts, bruises, and visible disease symptoms.
2.  Prepare the chemical solution/slurry as per the recommended dosage.
3.  Dip the seed tubers in the solution or spray them thoroughly, ensuring complete coverage.
4.  Allow the treated tubers to air dry in a shaded, well-ventilated area before planting.

**Specific Recommendations:**

*   **For Black Scurf (Rhizoctonia solani), Dry Rot (Fusarium spp.), and Silver Scurf (Helminthosporium solani):**
    *   **Pencycuron** 23% SC: 2.5 ml per kg of seed tubers.
    *   Alternatively, a combination of fungicides can be used:
        *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP: 2.5 g per kg of seed tubers.
        *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: 1-2 g per kg of seed tubers.
    *   Some commercial formulations containing **Fludioxonil** and **Difenoconazole** are also highly effective. Follow product-specific recommendations.

*   **For early season sucking pests (Aphids, Jassids) and to provide initial protection against some soil pests:**
    *   **Imidacloprid** 600 FS: 3-5 ml per kg of seed tubers.
    *   Alternatively, **Thiamethoxam** 30% FS: 10 ml per 100 kg of seed tubers.

### Recommended Soil Treatment Process for Potato

Soil treatment targets soil-borne diseases and pests that can damage roots and developing tubers throughout the growing season.

**Process:**
1.  Ensure proper land preparation, including deep ploughing and removal of crop residues.
2.  Apply granular formulations by broadcasting evenly over the soil surface and incorporating them into the topsoil before planting.
3.  For drench applications, mix the chemical with water and apply it directly into the furrows at the time of planting or as a post-planting drench.
4.  For biological agents, mix with well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) for better distribution and efficacy.

**Specific Recommendations:**

*   **For Black Scurf (Rhizoctonia solani) and Common Scab (Streptomyces scabies):**
    *   **Pencycuron** 23% SC: 2.5 L per acre, applied as a drench in the furrows at planting or mixed with irrigation water.
    *   **Biological Control:** **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum**: 2.5 kg per acre, mixed with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) and applied to the soil before planting.

*   **For Nematodes (Root-knot nematode - Meloidogyne spp., Cyst nematode - Globodera spp.):**
    *   **Fluensulfone** 2% GR: 20 kg per acre, applied at planting and incorporated into the soil.
    *   **Ethoprophos** 10% GR: 10 kg per acre, applied at planting and incorporated into the soil.
    *   **Cadusafos** 10% GR: 10 kg per acre, applied at planting and incorporated into the soil.

*   **For White Grubs (Holotrichia spp.) and Cutworms (Agrotis spp.):**
    *   **Fipronil** 0.3% GR: 20-25 kg per acre, broadcast and incorporated into the soil before planting or at planting.
    *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: 2 L per acre, applied as a drench in the furrows at planting.

Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions when handling and applying any chemical. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) practices, including crop rotation and use of resistant varieties, should always be an integral part of your potato cultivation strategy.
