As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling sucking pests in Potato in Haryana.

**Regarding Psylla:**
This is not known to affect Potato as a significant economic pest in Haryana.

For the control of Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips in Potato, an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is highly recommended.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies:**

1.  **Monitoring and Scouting:** Regularly inspect potato fields (at least twice a week) for the presence of sucking pests, their nymphs, and damage symptoms. Pay attention to the undersides of leaves and growing points.
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the field and surrounding areas free of weeds, as many weeds serve as alternate hosts for these pests.
    *   **Balanced Nutrition:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush, succulent growth that is more attractive to sucking pests.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation to break the pest cycle.
3.  **Physical Methods:**
    *   **Yellow Sticky Traps:** Install yellow sticky traps (15-20 traps per acre) at crop height to monitor pest populations and for mass trapping of whiteflies and leafhoppers.
4.  **Biological Control:** Conserve natural enemies such as ladybird beetles, lacewings, and syrphid flies, which prey on aphids and other soft-bodied insects. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides when natural enemy populations are high.

**Chemical Control (When pest populations exceed economic threshold levels):**

When pest populations reach economic threshold levels (e.g., 5-10 aphids/leaf, 1-2 whiteflies/leaf, or visible damage), chemical intervention may be necessary. Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Always ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves.

For effective control, consider the following CIBRC approved insecticides (assuming a spray volume of 200-250 litres of water per acre):

*   **For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies:**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply 125 ml per acre (approximately 0.5-0.6 ml/L of water).
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply 100 g per acre (approximately 0.4-0.5 g/L of water).
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply 100 g per acre (approximately 0.4-0.5 g/L of water).

*   **For Thrips (and also effective against other sucking pests):**
    *   **Fipronil 5% SC:** Apply 400-600 ml per acre (approximately 1.6-2.4 ml/L of water).

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Rotation:** Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.
*   **Timing:** Apply insecticides during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of pesticides. Follow label instructions carefully regarding dosage, application method, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   **Consultation:** For specific recommendations based on current pest pressure and local conditions, farmers are advised to consult with HAU experts or local agricultural extension officers.
