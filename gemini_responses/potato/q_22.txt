As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following cultivation practices for Potato in Haryana:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   Potatoes are typically planted in rows on flat beds, followed by earthing up to form ridges and furrows.
    *   The most common method involves planting seed tubers in furrows, which are then covered to form ridges. This facilitates irrigation and tuber development.
    *   Mechanical potato planters are widely used for efficient and uniform planting.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   The optimal planting depth for potato seed tubers is generally **5-10 cm** from the top of the ridge.
    *   Adequate depth ensures proper tuberization, protects developing tubers from greening (due to sunlight exposure), and provides insulation against temperature fluctuations.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   Recommended spacing varies slightly depending on the variety and desired tuber size, but a common practice for good yield and tuber size distribution is:
        *   **Row-to-row spacing:** **60-75 cm**
        *   **Plant-to-plant spacing:** **15-25 cm**
    *   Closer spacing (e.g., 60x15 cm) may result in a higher number of smaller tubers, while wider spacing (e.g., 75x25 cm) tends to produce larger tubers.

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   The seed dose depends on the size of the seed tubers and the chosen spacing.
    *   On average, for whole or cut seed tubers of 25-50 g each, the recommended seed dose is approximately **2000-3000 kg/acre** (2-3 tonnes per acre).
    *   It is crucial to use healthy, disease-free, and well-sprouted seed tubers for optimal germination and crop establishment. If using cut tubers, ensure they are properly cured before planting to prevent rot.
