Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I understand the critical role of micronutrients in achieving optimal potato yields and quality in Haryana. Addressing these deficiencies requires a scientific approach, starting with proper diagnosis.

**General Approach to Micronutrient Management in Potato:**

1.  **Soil Testing:** This is the most crucial first step. A comprehensive soil test before planting will reveal existing deficiencies and guide basal application of micronutrients.
2.  **Plant Tissue Analysis:** If symptoms appear during the growing season, plant tissue analysis can confirm the deficiency and help determine the most effective foliar application.
3.  **Integrated Nutrient Management:** Combine soil application (for long-term correction) with foliar sprays (for quick relief and maintenance).

Here's how to address specific micronutrient deficiencies in Potato:

### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, small and narrow leaves (little leaf), interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, often with a bronzing appearance.
*   **Addressing Deficiency:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Zinc Sulphate (Monohydrate)** (33% Zn) at 7-15 kg/acre or **Zinc Sulphate (Heptahydrate)** (21% Zn) at 10-25 kg/acre as a basal dose before planting or at the time of planting.
    *   **Foliar Application:** For quick correction, spray **Zinc Sulphate (Heptahydrate)** (21% Zn) at 2.5-5 g/L of water (0.25-0.5% solution). Apply 2-3 sprays at 15-day intervals, starting 30-45 days after planting or upon symptom appearance.

### 2. Iron (Fe) / Ferrous Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Pronounced interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, while veins remain green. In severe cases, leaves may turn almost white. More common in alkaline soils.
*   **Addressing Deficiency:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Ferrous Sulphate (Heptahydrate)** (19% Fe) at 10-20 kg/acre as a basal dose. However, soil application can be less effective in high pH soils due to iron fixation.
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray **Ferrous Sulphate (Heptahydrate)** (19% Fe) at 5 g/L of water (0.5% solution) or **Ferrous EDTA** (12% Fe) at 1-2 g/L of water. Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, focusing on young foliage.

### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Death of growing points, stunted growth, distorted and thickened leaves, cracking of tubers, and internal brown spot or hollow heart in tubers.
*   **Addressing Deficiency:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Borax (Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate)** (10.5% B) at 4-8 kg/acre or **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (20% B) at 2-4 kg/acre as a basal dose.
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray **Borax (Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate)** (10.5% B) at 1-2 g/L of water (0.1-0.2% solution) or **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (20% B) at 0.5-1 g/L of water. Apply 1-2 sprays during the vegetative growth and tuber initiation stages.

### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, death of terminal buds, distorted new leaves, poor root development, and can contribute to internal brown spot or hollow heart in tubers, especially under fluctuating moisture conditions.
*   **Addressing Deficiency:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Gypsum (Calcium Sulphate)** (23% Ca, 18% S) at 200-400 kg/acre before planting, especially in soils with low calcium or poor structure.
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray **Calcium Nitrate** (19% Ca) at 5-10 g/L of water (0.5-1% solution) or **Calcium Chloride** (36% Ca) at 2.5-5 g/L of water (0.25-0.5% solution). Apply 2-3 sprays during the tuberization phase.

### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, starting from the leaf margins and progressing inwards, often leading to a characteristic "Christmas tree" pattern. Leaves may become brittle and sometimes develop a purplish tint.
*   **Addressing Deficiency:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Magnesium Sulphate (Heptahydrate)** (9.6% Mg) at 10-20 kg/acre as a basal dose.
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray **Magnesium Sulphate (Heptahydrate)** (9.6% Mg) at 5-10 g/L of water (0.5-1% solution). Apply 2-3 sprays at 15-day intervals, starting when symptoms appear or during active vegetative growth.

### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, often accompanied by small necrotic (dead) spots. Leaves may appear mottled or speckled.
*   **Addressing Deficiency:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Manganese Sulphate (Monohydrate)** (30.5% Mn) at 5-10 kg/acre as a basal dose. Soil application can be less effective in alkaline soils.
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray **Manganese Sulphate (Monohydrate)** (30.5% Mn) at 2.5-5 g/L of water (0.25-0.5% solution). Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, starting 30-45 days after planting or upon symptom appearance.

### Important Considerations:

*   **Water Quality:** Ensure the water used for foliar sprays is clean and has a suitable pH.
*   **Compatibility:** Always check the compatibility of micronutrient solutions if mixing with other pesticides or fertilizers.
*   **Timing:** Early diagnosis and timely application are crucial for effective correction and preventing yield losses.
*   **Over-application:** Micronutrients can be toxic if applied in excess. Always adhere to recommended dosages.
*   **Soil pH:** Micronutrient availability is highly influenced by soil pH. For instance, Iron and Manganese become less available in alkaline soils, which are common in parts of Haryana.

By following these scientifically verified recommendations, potato growers in Haryana can effectively manage micronutrient deficiencies and ensure healthy, productive crops.
