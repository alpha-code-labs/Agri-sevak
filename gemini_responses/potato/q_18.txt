As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified recommendations for the use of growth regulators and Boron in potato cultivation in Haryana:

### Recommended Doses of Growth Regulators/Hormones and Boron in Potato

**1. Ethephon (for Haulm Killing/Defoliation)**

*   **Purpose:** Ethephon is used for haulm killing (defoliation) of potato plants 10-15 days before harvest. This practice helps in skin setting of tubers, facilitates mechanical harvesting, and reduces the incidence of certain tuber diseases.
*   **Recommended Dose:**
    *   **Ethephon** (39% SL formulation): **1.5 - 2.0 litres per acre**.
    *   **Application:** Mix the recommended quantity in 200-300 litres of water and spray uniformly over the foliage. Apply 10-15 days before the anticipated harvest date.

**2. 2,4-D (2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid)**

*   **Recommendation:** While **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid** is a plant growth regulator, its primary and recommended use in potato cultivation in Haryana is as a selective herbicide for broadleaf weed control. Its application as a growth regulator for specific physiological effects (e.g., tuberization, dormancy breaking) is not a standard, scientifically verified, or widely recommended practice for commercial potato production. The margin between growth-regulating concentrations and phytotoxic (crop damaging) concentrations is very narrow, making its use as a growth regulator risky and prone to causing significant crop damage if misapplied.
*   **Conclusion:** Therefore, we do not recommend the use of **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid** as a growth regulator in potato.

**3. Boron (Micronutrient)**

*   **Purpose:** Boron is an essential micronutrient critical for cell wall formation, sugar transport, and overall tuber development and quality. Its deficiency can lead to internal brown spot, hollow heart, and reduced yield.
*   **Recommended Dose (Foliar Application):**
    *   **Disodium tetraborate decahydrate** (Borax, containing approximately 10.5-11.3% Boron): **2 grams per litre of water** (0.2% solution).
    *   **Boric acid** (containing approximately 17% Boron): **1 gram per litre of water** (0.1% solution).
    *   **Application:** Apply 200-300 litres of the prepared solution per acre.
    *   **Timing:** The first foliar spray should be given at the tuber initiation stage (approximately 40-50 days after planting), followed by a second spray 15-20 days later.
