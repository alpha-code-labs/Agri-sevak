As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for potato cultivation in Haryana regarding maturity, harvesting, and the cutting process:

### Maturity Signs

The maturity of potato tubers is indicated by several key signs, crucial for determining the optimal harvest time:

*   **Foliage Senescence:** The most prominent sign is the natural yellowing, drying, and eventual death of the potato plant's foliage (haulms). The leaves will start to turn yellow, then brown, and the stems will wither and fall over.
*   **Tuber Detachment:** Mature tubers will easily detach from the stolons (the underground stems connecting the tuber to the main plant) when gently pulled.
*   **Skin Set (Skin Hardening):** This is a critical indicator, especially for potatoes intended for storage. The skin of a mature potato tuber will be firm and resistant to peeling or rubbing off when gently rubbed with a thumb. Immature tubers have thin, easily bruised skin that peels off readily.
*   **Tuber Size:** Tubers will have reached their characteristic size and shape for the specific variety being grown.

### Harvesting Time

The optimal harvesting time depends on the potato variety, planting date, and the intended use (e.g., immediate consumption as "new potatoes" vs. long-term storage).

*   **General Duration:** Most potato varieties in Haryana typically mature within 90-120 days after planting.
*   **For Immediate Consumption (New Potatoes):** Harvesting can commence when tubers reach a marketable size, even if the foliage is still green. However, these potatoes have immature skin and poor storage quality.
*   **For Storage and Processing:** It is crucial to allow the tubers to fully mature and develop a strong skin set. This typically means waiting until the foliage has completely died down naturally or has been desiccated.
    *   Allow **10-15 days** after the complete death of the haulms (either naturally or through desiccation) before harvesting. This period is vital for the skin to toughen and "set," which significantly reduces damage during harvest and improves the storage life of the tubers.
*   **Weather Conditions:** Harvest during cool, dry weather. Avoid harvesting during hot periods (above 25°C) or when the soil is excessively wet, as this can lead to increased tuber damage, susceptibility to diseases, and poor storage quality.

### Cutting Process (Haulm Cutting/Desiccation and Tuber Lifting)

The "cutting process" in potato harvesting primarily refers to the management of the foliage (haulms) before lifting the tubers, and then the actual lifting process.

**1. Haulm Cutting/Desiccation:**
This practice is highly recommended, especially for potatoes intended for storage or processing. It serves several important purposes:

*   **Promotes Skin Set:** Accelerates the hardening and toughening of the tuber skin, which significantly reduces mechanical damage during harvest and improves storage quality.
*   **Controls Tuber Size:** By stopping further vegetative growth, it helps in achieving a more uniform tuber size.
*   **Facilitates Harvesting:** Removes bulky foliage, making both manual and mechanical harvesting easier and reducing the risk of tubers getting entangled or damaged by green matter.
*   **Disease Management:** Reduces the transfer of late blight spores and other foliar diseases from the dying foliage to the developing tubers.

Methods for haulm cutting/desiccation:

*   **Mechanical Haulm Cutting:**
    *   The potato tops are mowed or flailed off approximately 10-15 days before the planned harvest. This is a common and effective practice.
*   **Chemical Desiccation:**
    *   Chemical desiccants are applied to kill the foliage. This method is effective for uniform drying and can be particularly useful for large-scale operations.
    *   **Recommended CIBRC Approved Chemicals for Haulm Desiccation:**
        *   **Paraquat dichloride** (24% SL): Apply 2.0-2.5 L/acre in 200-300 L of water.
        *   **Diquat dibromide** (24% SL): Apply 1.0-1.5 L/acre in 200-300 L of water.
    *   *Application Timing:* Apply when tubers have reached the desired size and maturity, typically 10-15 days before the anticipated harvest. Ensure thorough spray coverage for effective desiccation.

**2. Tuber Lifting (Harvesting):**
After the haulms have been removed/desiccated and the tuber skin has set, the tubers are carefully lifted from the soil.

*   **Manual Harvesting:**
    *   Involves using spades, hoes, or manual potato diggers to carefully unearth the tubers.
    *   This method requires significant labor but allows for very careful handling, minimizing tuber damage.
*   **Mechanical Harvesting:**
    *   Potato diggers or combine harvesters are used. These machines lift the tubers, separate them from soil and debris, and often convey them into trailers or bags.
    *   **Careful Adjustment:** Machine settings (e.g., digging depth, forward speed, chain speed, and angle) must be precisely adjusted to minimize tuber damage (cuts, bruises, skinning) and ensure efficient separation from soil and clods.
    *   **Avoid Damage:** Regardless of the method, extreme care must be taken to avoid cutting, bruising, or skinning the tubers. Damaged potatoes are highly susceptible to rot and have significantly reduced storage life.

After harvesting, tubers should ideally undergo a curing period in a well-ventilated, dark place for a few days before sorting and storing, especially if they are to be stored for extended periods. This further aids in wound healing and skin toughening.
