"Drying up" in potato plants, manifesting as drying leaves, stems, and flowers, is a general symptom that can indicate a range of underlying issues, from specific diseases and pests to environmental stresses. As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I advise a thorough examination of the affected plants and field conditions to accurately diagnose the cause. Below are the common causes and their scientifically verified management strategies relevant to Haryana:

**I. Fungal Diseases**

1.  **Early Blight (Alternaria solani):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Characterized by small, dark, angular spots with concentric rings (target spots) on older leaves. These spots enlarge, coalesce, and lead to yellowing and premature drying of the foliage. Can also affect stems and tubers.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural:** Practice crop rotation, ensure balanced nutrition, and remove infected plant debris.
        *   **Chemical:**
            *   For foliar spray, apply **Mancozeb** at 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L of water).
            *   Alternatively, use **Chlorothalonil** at 2 kg/acre (or 2 g/L of water).
            *   For systemic action, **Azoxystrobin** can be applied at 200 ml/acre (or 0.5 ml/L of water).
            *   **Propineb** at 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L of water).

2.  **Late Blight (Phytophthora infestans):**
    *   **Symptoms:** This is a highly destructive disease, especially under cool and humid conditions. It causes water-soaked lesions on leaves, stems, and tubers, which rapidly turn brown to black. A white, downy fungal growth may be visible on the underside of leaves, leading to rapid blighting and drying of the entire foliage.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural:** Use healthy, certified seed tubers, remove volunteer potato plants, ensure proper plant spacing, and provide good field drainage.
        *   **Chemical (Preventive and Curative):**
            *   For preventive control, apply **Mancozeb** at 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L of water) or **Chlorothalonil** at 2 kg/acre (or 2 g/L of water).
            *   For curative action or when disease pressure is high, use combination products:
                *   **Cymoxanil + Mancozeb** at 1.25 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L of combination product).
                *   **Dimethomorph + Mancozeb** at 1 kg/acre (or 2 g/L of combination product).
                *   **Metalaxyl-M + Mancozeb** at 1 kg/acre (or 2 g/L of combination product).
                *   **Fluopicolide + Propamocarb hydrochloride** at 1.25 L/acre (or 2.5 ml/L of combination product).

3.  **Fusarium Wilt (Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. tuberosi) / Verticillium Wilt (Verticillium dahliae):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Both cause yellowing and wilting of lower leaves, often starting unilaterally (one side of the plant or leaf), progressing upwards. Stems, when cut, show brown discoloration of the vascular tissue. This leads to premature drying and death of the plant.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural:** Use resistant potato varieties, practice long crop rotations (3-4 years with non-solanaceous crops), plant healthy seed tubers, and avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization.
        *   **Chemical (Primarily Seed Treatment):**
            *   Treat seed tubers with **Carbendazim** at 1-2 g/kg seed tubers.
            *   Alternatively, use **Thiram** at 2.5 g/kg seed tubers.

4.  **Rhizoctonia Stem Canker and Black Scurf (Rhizoctonia solani):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Causes brown to black cankers on stems, particularly near the soil line, which can girdle the stem. This leads to wilting, stunting, and eventual drying of the plant.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural:** Use healthy, disease-free seed tubers, plant in warm, well-drained soil, and avoid deep planting.
        *   **Chemical (Seed Treatment):**
            *   Treat seed tubers with **Pencycuron** at 2.5 g/kg seed tubers.
            *   Alternatively, use **Flutolanil** at 2.5 ml/kg seed tubers.

**II. Bacterial Diseases**

1.  **Bacterial Wilt (Ralstonia solanacearum):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Characterized by rapid, sudden wilting of the entire plant, often without prior yellowing. Leaves may remain green initially but quickly dry up. When affected stems are cut, a brown discoloration of the vascular tissue is visible, and a milky bacterial ooze may exude when placed in water.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural (Most Critical):** There is no effective chemical control once the disease is established. Focus on preventive measures: use disease-free certified seed tubers, implement strict crop rotation (at least 5 years with non-host crops), practice strict sanitation (disinfect tools and equipment), and immediately remove and destroy infected plants. Avoid planting in fields with a history of bacterial wilt.

**III. Nematodes**

1.  **Root-knot Nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Damage to roots impairs water and nutrient uptake, leading to stunted growth, yellowing, wilting, and premature drying of plants, especially under stress conditions. Characteristic galls (knots) are visible on the roots.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops (e.g., cereals, marigold), and use resistant potato varieties if available.
        *   **Chemical (Soil Application/Seed Treatment):**
            *   Apply **Fluopyram** as a soil drench or in-furrow application at 625 ml/acre.
            *   Alternatively, use granular **Fosthiazate** as a soil application at 10 kg/acre.

**IV. Physiological/Environmental Factors**

1.  **Water Stress (Drought):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Wilting, curling, and drying of leaves, typically starting from the margins and progressing inwards.
    *   **Management:** Ensure adequate and timely irrigation, especially during critical growth stages (tuber initiation and bulking). Use mulching to conserve soil moisture.

2.  **Heat Stress:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Can cause scorching of leaf margins, wilting, and premature senescence (drying) of the plant.
    *   **Management:** Provide adequate irrigation, consider planting heat-tolerant varieties, and adjust planting dates to avoid peak heat periods.

3.  **Nutrient Deficiencies (e.g., Potassium):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Severe deficiencies, particularly of Potassium, can lead to yellowing and necrosis (drying) of leaf margins, especially on older leaves.
    *   **Management:** Conduct regular soil testing to identify nutrient deficiencies. Apply balanced fertilizers as per soil test recommendations. For Potassium deficiency, apply **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** or **Sulphate of Potash (SOP)** as advised by soil analysis.

**Integrated Pest and Disease Management (IPM) Approach:**
It is crucial to adopt an Integrated Pest and Disease Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural practices, resistant varieties, and judicious use of chemicals, for sustainable and effective control of "drying up" symptoms in potato. Always follow label instructions for chemical application rates and safety precautions.
