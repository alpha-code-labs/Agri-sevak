This is not known to affect Potato.

In potato cultivation, the primary economic yield comes from the tubers, which are modified underground stems. While potato plants do flower and produce small fruits (botanically berries), the retention of these flowers or fruits is generally not a concern for commercial tuber production. In fact, excessive flowering and fruiting can sometimes divert energy away from tuber development.

The term "Tinda/Boll dropping" specifically refers to fruit/boll abscission in crops like Tinda (a cucurbit) or cotton (boll), and is not applicable to potato.
