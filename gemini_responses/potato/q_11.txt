Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing pests in potato cultivation in Haryana.

Let's address your query regarding Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies in Potato:

### Control of Beetles in Potato

Beetles can be significant pests of potato, causing damage to foliage and sometimes tubers. The most common beetle pests in potato in our region include Flea Beetles and Blister Beetles.

**1. Flea Beetles (e.g., *Phyllotreta spp.*, *Epitrix spp.*):**
These small, jumping beetles feed on leaves, creating numerous small, round holes, giving the leaves a "shot-hole" appearance. Severe infestations can stunt plant growth and reduce yield.

**2. Blister Beetles (e.g., *Mylabris spp.*, *Epicauta spp.*):**
These beetles are larger and often appear in swarms, causing rapid defoliation of potato plants, especially during the flowering stage.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Beetles:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting potatoes in the same field year after year to break the pest cycle.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy potato volunteer plants and weeds that can harbor pests.
    *   **Timely Planting:** Planting early can sometimes help plants establish before peak pest populations.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure balanced fertilization to promote vigorous plant growth, making plants more tolerant to pest damage.

*   **Biological Control:**
    *   Natural enemies like parasitic wasps and predatory beetles can help manage flea beetle populations, but their impact alone may not be sufficient for severe infestations.

*   **Chemical Control (for severe infestations):**
    When beetle populations reach economic threshold levels, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always follow label instructions and safety precautions.

    *   For Flea Beetles:
        *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at 125-150 ml per acre in 200-400 litres of water.
        *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at 40-50 g per acre in 200-400 litres of water.
        *   **Fipronil 5% SC:** Apply at 400-600 ml per acre in 200-400 litres of water.

    *   For Blister Beetles and other defoliating beetles:
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** Apply at 100-125 ml per acre in 200-400 litres of water.
        *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** Apply at 60 ml per acre in 200-400 litres of water.
        *   **Cypermethrin 25% EC:** Apply at 60-80 ml per acre in 200-400 litres of water.

### Weevils in Potato

Weevils are generally **not known to be major pests of potato** in Haryana. While some polyphagous weevil species might occasionally be found, they do not typically cause significant economic damage to potato crops in our region. The Sweet Potato Weevil, for instance, is a major pest of sweet potato but not of potato (*Solanum tuberosum*).

### Sawflies in Potato

This is not known to affect Potato. Sawflies are primarily pests of trees, shrubs, and some other herbaceous plants (like cereals or brassicas) but are **not known to be pests of potato** (*Solanum tuberosum*) in Haryana or elsewhere.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.
*   Ensure thorough spray coverage for effective pest control.
*   Observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) for all chemical applications to ensure the safety of the produce.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and current pest situation.
