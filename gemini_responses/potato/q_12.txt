Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing scale insects and mealybugs in potato cultivation in Haryana.

While scale insects and mealybugs are not typically considered major field pests of potato in Haryana compared to aphids or jassids, they can occasionally infest potato plants, especially under specific environmental conditions or if present on volunteer plants or nearby crops. Mealybugs can also be a concern in potato storage.

An Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is recommended for effective and sustainable control.

### Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Scale Insects and Mealybugs in Potato:

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**

*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infested plant debris, volunteer potato plants, and weeds that can harbor these pests.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation to break the pest cycle.
*   **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect potato plants, especially the undersides of leaves and stem bases, for early signs of infestation. Early detection is crucial for effective management.
*   **Pruning:** If only a few plants or parts are infested, prune and destroy the affected parts to prevent spread.
*   **Water Spray:** For minor infestations, a strong jet of water can dislodge mealybugs from plants.

**2. Biological Control:**

*   Encourage natural enemies such as ladybird beetles (coccinellids), lacewings, and parasitic wasps, which prey on or parasitize scale insects and mealybugs. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

**3. Chemical Control (If infestation is severe and other methods are insufficient):**

When chemical intervention is necessary, use CIBRC approved insecticides. Systemic insecticides are often more effective against these pests due to their waxy protective covering. Ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and stem junctions where these pests tend to aggregate.

*   **For Scale Insects and Mealybugs (Sap-sucking pests):**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at a rate of 100-125 ml per acre.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at a rate of 40 g per acre.
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply at a rate of 50-100 g per acre.
    *   **Dimethoate 30% EC:** Apply at a rate of 500 ml per acre.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Timing of Application:** For scale insects, the crawler stage (young, mobile stage) is most vulnerable to insecticides. For mealybugs, repeated applications at appropriate intervals might be necessary due to their overlapping generations and protective waxy coating.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure complete and thorough spray coverage, targeting the areas where pests are present.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.
*   **Safety:** Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label, including dosage, application method, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and safety precautions. Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).
*   **Consult Experts:** For persistent or severe infestations, it is advisable to consult with local agricultural extension officers or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions.
