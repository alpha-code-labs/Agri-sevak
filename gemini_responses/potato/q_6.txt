As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling viral diseases in Potato in Haryana:

Firstly, regarding one of the listed conditions:
*   **Tristeza:** This is not known to affect Potato. Citrus Tristeza Virus (CTV) primarily affects citrus species.

For the other viral diseases mentioned (Leaf curl, Mosaic, Yellow vein clearing, Stripe, and Stunt virus), it is crucial to understand that there is no direct chemical cure for viral diseases once a potato plant is infected. Control strategies primarily focus on preventing infection and managing the vectors that transmit these viruses.

Here are the recommended control measures:

**I. Non-Chemical and Cultural Control Measures:**

*   **Use Certified Virus-Free Seed Tubers:** This is the most critical step. Always procure seed tubers from certified sources that guarantee freedom from major potato viruses (e.g., Potato Leaf Roll Virus - PLRV, Potato Virus Y - PVY, Potato Virus X - PVX, Potato Spindle Tuber Viroid - PSTVd).
*   **Plant Resistant/Tolerant Varieties:** Where available and suitable for Haryana's agro-climatic conditions, choose potato varieties known to be resistant or tolerant to specific prevalent viruses.
*   **Roguing:** Regularly inspect the field and promptly remove and destroy (bury deep or burn) any plants showing symptoms of viral infection. This reduces the source of inoculum for further spread.
*   **Vector Control (Aphids):** Many potato viruses (e.g., PLRV, PVY, PVA) are primarily transmitted by aphids. Effective aphid management is paramount.
    *   Monitor aphid populations regularly using yellow sticky traps or direct plant inspection.
    *   Remove weeds from and around the potato fields, as they can act as alternate hosts for both viruses and their vectors.
*   **Maintain Field Hygiene:** Practice good sanitation to minimize potential sources of infection.
*   **Optimal Nutrient and Water Management:** Ensure balanced fertilization and adequate irrigation to promote vigorous plant growth, which can help plants tolerate stress and potentially reduce symptom severity.
*   **Avoid Mechanical Transmission:** Some viruses (e.g., PVX, PVY) can be transmitted mechanically through sap on farm tools, machinery, or hands. Disinfect tools regularly, especially when moving between fields or different sections of a field.

**II. Chemical Control Measures (for Vector Management):**

Chemical control focuses on managing the insect vectors, primarily aphids, to prevent the spread of viruses from infected to healthy plants. These chemicals do not cure the viral infection in already infected plants.

*   **Seed Treatment:**
    *   Treat seed tubers with systemic insecticides before planting to provide early protection against aphid vectors.
        *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** 3-4 ml per kg of seed tubers.
        *   **Thiamethoxam 30% FS:** 10-12 ml per kg of seed tubers.
*   **Foliar Sprays (for Aphid Control during the growing season):**
    *   Apply foliar insecticides as soon as aphid populations reach economic threshold levels or as a preventive measure in high-risk areas, typically starting 30-45 days after planting.
        *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** 125-150 ml per acre (in 200-250 litres of water).
        *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** 50-100 g per acre (in 200-250 litres of water).
        *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** 100-125 g per acre (in 200-250 litres of water).
        *   **Flonicamid 50% WG:** 60 g per acre (in 200-250 litres of water).
        *   **Pymetrozine 50% WG:** 120 g per acre (in 200-250 litres of water).

It is crucial to adopt an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining these cultural, biological, and chemical methods for effective and sustainable control of viral diseases in potato. Always follow the instructions on the product label for safe and effective use of pesticides.
