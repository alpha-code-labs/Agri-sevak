Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the critical role of balanced nutrition in achieving high yields and quality tubers in potato cultivation. Macro-nutrient deficiencies, particularly Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K), can severely impact your potato crop.

The most accurate way to determine nutrient requirements is through **soil testing**. I strongly advise all farmers to get their soil tested before planting. This allows for precise recommendations tailored to your field's specific needs. However, based on general recommendations for potato cultivation in Haryana, here's how to address these macro-nutrient deficiencies:

**General NPK Recommendations for Potato in Haryana (without soil test):**
For a good potato crop, a typical recommendation is:
*   **Nitrogen (N):** 120-150 kg per acre
*   **Phosphorus (P2O5):** 60-80 kg per acre
*   **Potassium (K2O):** 80-100 kg per acre

Let's break down how to address deficiencies for each nutrient:

### 1. Addressing Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

Nitrogen is crucial for vegetative growth, leaf development, and overall plant vigor.

**Symptoms of N Deficiency:**
*   General yellowing (chlorosis) of older leaves, starting from the tips and margins.
*   Stunted plant growth with thin, weak stems.
*   Reduced number and size of tubers.

**Correction Measures:**

*   **Basal Application (at planting):**
    *   Apply 1/2 to 2/3 of the total recommended Nitrogen at the time of planting.
    *   Use **Urea** (46% N) at a rate of approximately 130-160 kg per acre (if using DAP, adjust Urea quantity as DAP also provides N).
*   **Top Dressing (at earthing up, 25-45 days after planting):**
    *   Apply the remaining 1/3 to 1/2 of the total recommended Nitrogen.
    *   Use **Urea** at a rate of approximately 130-160 kg per acre.
*   **Foliar Spray (for quick correction or mild deficiency):**
    *   Spray a 1-2% solution of **Urea** (10-20 g of Urea per litre of water). Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, especially during critical growth stages.
    *   Alternatively, **Potassium Nitrate** (13% N, 45% K2O) can be used at 1-2% solution (10-20 g/L) if K deficiency is also suspected.

### 2. Addressing Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

Phosphorus is vital for root development, energy transfer, tuber initiation, and overall plant maturity.

**Symptoms of P Deficiency:**
*   Dark green or purplish discoloration of leaves, especially on the underside of older leaves.
*   Stunted growth, poor root development, and delayed maturity.
*   Reduced tuber formation and yield.

**Correction Measures:**

*   **Basal Application (at planting):**
    *   Phosphorus is relatively immobile in the soil, so the entire recommended quantity should be applied at planting.
    *   Use **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5) at a rate of approximately 130-174 kg per acre. (Remember to reduce the basal **Urea** application accordingly, as DAP provides N).
    *   Alternatively, **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5) can be used at a rate of approximately 375-500 kg per acre.
*   **Foliar Spray (for mild deficiency or supplemental feeding):**
    *   Spray a 0.5-1% solution of **Monoammonium Phosphate (MAP)** (12% N, 61% P2O5) (5-10 g of MAP per litre of water). Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals.

### 3. Addressing Potassium (K) Deficiency

Potassium is essential for water regulation, disease resistance, starch accumulation in tubers, and overall tuber quality.

**Symptoms of K Deficiency:**
*   Yellowing and scorching (browning) of leaf margins, especially on older leaves.
*   Weak stems, lodging, and increased susceptibility to diseases.
*   Poor tuber development, reduced starch content, and lower storage quality.

**Correction Measures:**

*   **Basal Application (at planting):**
    *   Apply 1/2 of the total recommended Potassium at the time of planting.
    *   Use **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** (60% K2O) at a rate of approximately 67-84 kg per acre.
*   **Top Dressing (at earthing up, 25-45 days after planting):**
    *   Apply the remaining 1/2 of the total recommended Potassium.
    *   Use **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** at a rate of approximately 67-84 kg per acre.
    *   Alternatively, **Sulphate of Potash (SOP)** (50% K2O) can be used, especially if chloride sensitivity is a concern or for improved tuber quality, at a rate of approximately 80-100 kg per acre (split application).
*   **Foliar Spray (for quick correction or supplemental feeding):**
    *   Spray a 1-2% solution of **Potassium Nitrate** (13% N, 45% K2O) (10-20 g of Potassium Nitrate per litre of water). Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals.
    *   Alternatively, a 0.5-1% solution of **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** (5-10 g of MOP per litre of water) can be used, but be cautious with higher concentrations to avoid leaf burn.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Soil Testing is Key:** The recommendations above are general. A soil test provides precise information on nutrient availability and pH, allowing for optimized fertilizer application and preventing over-application, which can be wasteful and harmful.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure all macro and micro-nutrients are available in adequate amounts. Deficiency of one nutrient can hinder the uptake and utilization of others.
*   **Application Timing:** Proper timing of fertilizer application is crucial for nutrient uptake and utilization by the potato plant.
*   **Irrigation:** Ensure adequate and timely irrigation, as water is essential for nutrient dissolution and uptake by roots.
