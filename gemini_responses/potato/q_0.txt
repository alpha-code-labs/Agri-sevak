Namaste, Kisan Bhaiyon! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the challenges you face in protecting your potato crop from diseases. Effective management of fungal diseases is crucial for a healthy and profitable harvest.

Let's address the specific fungal diseases you've mentioned for potato cultivation in Haryana:

### 1. Alternaria (Early Blight)

This is a common and significant fungal disease of potato caused by *Alternaria solani*. It typically appears on older leaves first, causing small, dark brown spots with concentric rings, often described as a "bull's-eye" pattern. Severe infection can lead to defoliation and reduced tuber size.

**Cultural Practices:**
*   Use disease-free seed tubers.
*   Maintain proper plant spacing to ensure good air circulation.
*   Practice crop rotation with non-solanaceous crops for at least 2-3 years.
*   Ensure balanced fertilization, avoiding excessive nitrogen.
*   Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest.

**Chemical Control (Preventive and Curative):**
Fungicide application should begin when symptoms first appear or when conditions are favorable for disease development (warm, humid weather). Repeat applications at 7-10 day intervals as per product label.

*   **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2-2.5 kg/acre (or 2-2.5 g/L of water).
*   **Chlorothalonil** (75% WP) at 2 kg/acre (or 2 g/L of water).
*   **Propineb** (70% WP) at 2-2.5 kg/acre (or 2-2.5 g/L of water).
*   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC) at 200 ml/acre (or 0.5 ml/L of water).
*   **Difenoconazole** (25% EC) at 100 ml/acre (or 0.25 ml/L of water).
*   **Pyraclostrobin + Metiram** (5% + 55% WG) at 1.5 kg/acre (or 3 g/L of water).

### 2. Anthracnose

This is not known to affect Potato as a primary foliar disease in the way it affects other crops. While *Colletotrichum coccodes* can cause black dot root rot and stem canker in potatoes, it is not typically referred to as "Anthracnose" in the context of a major foliar fungal disease requiring specific foliar fungicide applications for this name.

### 3. Blast

This is not known to affect Potato. The term "Blast" is primarily associated with diseases in cereal crops like rice.

### 4. Blight (Late Blight)

This refers to Late Blight, caused by *Phytophthora infestans*, an oomycete (water mold) that is one of the most destructive diseases of potato worldwide, including Haryana. It can cause rapid defoliation and tuber rot, especially under cool, moist conditions. Symptoms include water-soaked lesions on leaves, which turn brown/black, often with a fuzzy white growth (sporangia) on the underside in humid conditions.

**Cultural Practices:**
*   Use disease-free, certified seed tubers.
*   Plant resistant or tolerant varieties if available.
*   Avoid planting in low-lying areas where humidity can persist.
*   Ensure proper hilling to protect tubers from spores washing down from infected foliage.
*   Destroy volunteer potato plants and infected plant debris.
*   Avoid overhead irrigation late in the day to allow foliage to dry before nightfall.

**Chemical Control (Preventive and Curative):**
Fungicide application is critical for Late Blight management, especially during periods of high humidity and moderate temperatures (10-25°C). A spray schedule should be maintained, starting preventively if conditions are favorable, or immediately upon first symptom appearance.

*   **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2-2.5 kg/acre (or 2-2.5 g/L of water) - *Contact fungicide, good for prevention.*
*   **Chlorothalonil** (75% WP) at 2 kg/acre (or 2 g/L of water) - *Contact fungicide, good for prevention.*
*   **Propineb** (70% WP) at 2-2.5 kg/acre (or 2-2.5 g/L of water) - *Contact fungicide, good for prevention.*
*   **Dimethomorph + Mancozeb** (9% + 60% WP) at 1-1.25 kg/acre (or 2.5-3 g/L of water) - *Systemic + Contact, good for prevention and early curative.*
*   **Cymoxanil + Mancozeb** (8% + 64% WP) at 1.25 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L of water) - *Systemic + Contact, good for prevention and early curative.*
*   **Fenamidone + Mancozeb** (10% + 50% WG) at 1 kg/acre (or 2 g/L of water) - *Systemic + Contact, good for prevention and early curative.*
*   **Fluazinam** (50% SC) at 200 ml/acre (or 0.5 ml/L of water) - *Contact, multi-site action, good for resistance management.*
*   **Propamocarb Hydrochloride** (72.2% SL) at 2-2.5 L/acre (or 5-6 ml/L of water) - *Systemic, good for prevention and early curative.*
*   **Fluopicolide + Propamocarb Hydrochloride** (4.44% + 44.4% SC) at 600 ml/acre (or 1.5 ml/L of water) - *Systemic, excellent for prevention and curative action.*
*   **Mandipropamid** (23.4% SC) at 200 ml/acre (or 0.5 ml/L of water) - *Translaminar, good for prevention and early curative.*

### 5. Brown spot

This is not a distinct disease but rather a general symptom. Often, "brown spots" on potato leaves are indicative of Early Blight (Alternaria) or early stages of Late Blight. Please refer to the control measures for **Alternaria (Early Blight)** and **Blight (Late Blight)** above.

### 6. Downy Mildew

While Late Blight (*Phytophthora infestans*) is an oomycete and shares some characteristics with downy mildews, it is specifically referred to as Late Blight in potato. True "Downy Mildew" caused by obligate biotrophic fungi (e.g., *Peronospora*, *Plasmopara*) is not a primary or significant disease of potato. Please refer to the control measures for **Blight (Late Blight)** above.

### 7. Powdery Mildew

This is not known to affect Potato as a significant disease. Potato plants are generally not susceptible to powdery mildew.

### 8. Grey Mildew

This is not known to affect Potato. This is not a standard disease name for potato.

**General Recommendations for Fungal Disease Management:**

*   **Integrated Pest Management (IPM):** Always combine cultural practices with judicious use of chemicals.
*   **Rotation of Fungicides:** To prevent the development of fungicide resistance, rotate fungicides with different modes of action. Do not rely solely on one type of chemical.
*   **Timely Application:** Apply fungicides preventively or at the very first sign of disease, especially for Late Blight, as it can spread very rapidly.
*   **Proper Spray Coverage:** Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage, including the undersides of leaves, for effective control.
*   **Adjuvants:** Consider using a suitable spreader/sticker (adjuvant) with your fungicide spray to improve efficacy, especially during rainy periods.
*   **Consult Local Experts:** Always consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for the most current recommendations and specific product availability in your area.

Remember, healthy plants are more resilient to diseases. By following these scientific recommendations, you can effectively manage fungal diseases in your potato crop and ensure a good yield. Jai Kisan!
