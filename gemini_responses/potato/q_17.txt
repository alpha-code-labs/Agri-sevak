Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following doses for organic manures and bio-stimulants for Potato cultivation in Haryana to enhance soil health and crop productivity:

*   **Farm Yard Manure (FYM):**
    *   Apply **20-25 tonnes per acre** at least 2-3 weeks before planting. Ensure it is well-decomposed and thoroughly incorporated into the soil during land preparation. This improves soil structure, water holding capacity, and provides a slow release of essential nutrients.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   Apply **2-4 tonnes per acre** during land preparation or at the time of planting. Vermicompost is richer in nutrients than FYM and also contains beneficial microorganisms, promoting better root development and nutrient uptake.

*   **Sagarika (IFFCO):**
    Sagarika is a seaweed extract-based product that acts as a plant growth promoter and bio-stimulant, not a bulk manure. It is available in liquid (Sagarika Z) and granular (Sagarika G) forms.

    *   **Sagarika Z (Liquid):**
        *   For foliar application: Mix **2.5-3 ml per litre of water** and spray at critical growth stages. Typically, 2-3 sprays are recommended:
            *   First spray: 30-40 days after planting (at tuber initiation).
            *   Second spray: 15-20 days after the first spray (during tuber bulking).
            *   (Optional) Third spray: If required, during later tuber development.
    *   **Sagarika G (Granular):**
        *   For soil application: Apply **8-10 kg per acre** at the time of planting or during earthing up. This helps in improving nutrient availability and overall plant vigour.

These recommendations, when integrated with balanced chemical fertilizer application and good agricultural practices, will contribute significantly to healthy potato crop growth and yield in Haryana.
