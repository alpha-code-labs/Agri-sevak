As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I must clarify that the most common and traditional method for potato cultivation in Haryana is by planting **seed tubers**, not by transplanting seedlings. However, advanced methods like True Potato Seed (TPS) technology or tissue culture plantlets do involve transplantation. Assuming your question pertains to these methods, here is the scientifically verified advice:

### Ideal Transplantation Time for Potato (TPS/Tissue Culture Plantlets)

For Haryana, the main potato growing season is Rabi. To ensure optimal growth and yield, transplantation should coincide with the favorable climatic conditions:

*   **Main Crop:** Mid-September to Mid-October. This period offers suitable temperatures for tuberization and plant growth.
*   **Early Crop:** Late August to Early September. This allows for an earlier harvest, often fetching better market prices.
*   **Late Crop:** Late October to Early November. This extends the growing season, but care must be taken to protect against frost in later stages.

### Ideal Transplantation Distance for Potato (TPS/Tissue Culture Plantlets)

Maintaining proper spacing is crucial for adequate light penetration, air circulation, nutrient uptake, and tuber development.

*   **Row-to-Row Distance:** 60-75 cm
*   **Plant-to-Plant Distance:** 15-25 cm (A slightly wider spacing of 20-25 cm can be beneficial for plantlets to allow for better initial establishment and subsequent earthing up).

### Ideal Transplantation Process for Potato (TPS/Tissue Culture Plantlets)

The process involves careful handling and specific cultural practices to ensure successful establishment and growth.

1.  **Nursery Preparation (for TPS Seedlings):**
    *   Raise seedlings in well-prepared nursery beds or trays using a sterile, well-draining potting mix (e.g., coco-peat, vermiculite, perlite).
    *   Ensure adequate light, moisture, and protection from pests and diseases.
    *   Seedlings are typically ready for transplanting when they are 4-6 weeks old and have developed 4-6 true leaves.

2.  **Hardening (for Tissue Culture Plantlets and TPS Seedlings):**
    *   Gradually expose the plantlets/seedlings to ambient field conditions (reduced humidity, increased light, cooler temperatures) for 7-10 days before transplanting. This process helps them adapt to the harsher field environment and reduces transplant shock.

3.  **Field Preparation:**
    *   Prepare a fine, well-pulverized seedbed by ploughing and harrowing.
    *   Ensure excellent drainage to prevent waterlogging, which is detrimental to potato.
    *   Incorporate well-rotted farmyard manure (FYM) or compost at a rate of 20-25 tonnes/acre during the final ploughing.
    *   Apply basal doses of fertilizers (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium) as per soil test recommendations.
    *   Form ridges and furrows. Ridges are typically 15-20 cm high.

4.  **Transplanting:**
    *   Transplant during the cooler parts of the day, preferably late afternoon or evening, to minimize stress from heat and direct sunlight.
    *   Carefully remove seedlings/plantlets from the nursery/trays, ensuring minimal disturbance to the root system.
    *   Plant them gently on the side of the ridge (or in the furrow, depending on the specific hilling strategy) at the recommended spacing.
    *   Ensure the root ball is well covered with soil, and the plantlet is upright. Avoid planting too deep or too shallow.

5.  **Post-Transplantation Care:**
    *   **Immediate Irrigation:** Water the field immediately after transplanting to settle the soil around the roots and help the plantlets establish.
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the field free of weeds, especially during the initial establishment phase, as weeds compete for nutrients and moisture.
    *   **Earthing Up (Hilling):** This is a critical practice for potato.
        *   The first earthing up is typically done 20-25 days after transplanting, covering the base of the plants.
        *   A second earthing up is performed 40-45 days after transplanting, creating higher ridges to protect developing tubers from light (preventing greening) and mechanical damage, and to provide support to the plants.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Follow a balanced fertilizer schedule based on soil tests and crop growth stages.
    *   **Pest and Disease Management:** Regularly monitor the crop for pests and diseases and implement integrated pest management (IPM) strategies as needed.
