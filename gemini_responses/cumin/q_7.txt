As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling diseases in Cumin in Haryana:

**Regarding Dieback and Twig Blight in Cumin:**

While "Dieback" and "Twig blight" are not standard disease names specifically used for Cumin, the symptoms of drying and dying of plant parts, including stems and umbels, are characteristic of **Cumin Blight**, primarily caused by *Alternaria burnsii*. This disease is a major concern for Cumin cultivation in Haryana, leading to significant yield losses if not managed effectively. The control measures provided below are for Cumin Blight, which addresses the symptoms you've described.

**Control Measures for Cumin Blight (Addressing Dieback and Twig Blight symptoms):**

**I. Cultural Practices:**

*   **Use Disease-Free Seeds:** Always use certified, healthy, and disease-free seeds.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops for at least 2-3 years to reduce inoculum in the soil.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Maintain optimal plant spacing to ensure good air circulation, which helps reduce humidity and disease spread.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced nutrition to plants. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can make plants more susceptible to fungal diseases.
*   **Timely Irrigation:** Irrigate judiciously, preferably in the morning, to allow foliage to dry before evening. Avoid overhead irrigation during disease-favorable conditions.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest to reduce the primary source of inoculum for the next season.

**II. Chemical Control (Fungicides):**

Fungicide application should be initiated at the first appearance of symptoms or when weather conditions are favorable for disease development (high humidity, moderate temperatures). It is crucial to rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

*   **For initial stages or as a protective spray:**
    *   Spray with **Mancozeb** 75% WP at 2.5 kg per acre (or 5 g per litre of water).
*   **For systemic action and curative effect:**
    *   Spray with **Propiconazole** 25% EC at 250 ml per acre (or 0.5 ml per litre of water).
    *   Alternatively, spray with **Tebuconazole** 25% WG at 250 ml per acre (or 0.5 ml per litre of water).
    *   Another effective option is **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC at 200 ml per acre (or 0.4 ml per litre of water).

**Note:** For effective control, 2-3 sprays may be required at 10-15 day intervals, depending on disease severity and weather conditions. Always ensure thorough coverage of the plant foliage.

**Regarding Tikka Disease in Cumin:**

This is not known to affect Cumin. "Tikka disease" is a common name primarily associated with leaf spot diseases in Groundnut (Peanut) caused by *Cercospora arachidicola* and *Cercosporidium personatum*. Cumin is not susceptible to Tikka disease.
