As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following fertilizer doses for Cumin cultivation in Haryana. Please note that these are general recommendations, and a **soil test is highly recommended** to determine precise nutrient requirements for your specific field conditions.

**General NPK Recommendation for Cumin (without soil test):**
*   Nitrogen (N): 20 kg/acre
*   Phosphorus (P2O5): 15-20 kg/acre
*   Potassium (K2O): 0-10 kg/acre (depending on soil test)
*   Sulphur (S): 10-15 kg/acre (crucial for aromatic crops like Cumin)

Here's how to achieve these recommendations using the specified fertilizers:

### 1. Basal Application (at the time of sowing):

*   **Phosphorus and Sulphur:**
    *   The most efficient way to provide both P and S is through **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)**.
    *   **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5, 11% S): **100-125 kg/acre**
        *   This will provide approximately 16-20 kg P2O5 and 11-13.75 kg Sulphur, meeting the crop's requirements.
*   **Nitrogen (Partial Dose):**
    *   **Urea** (46% N): **20-25 kg/acre**
        *   This provides about 9-11.5 kg N as a basal dose.
*   **Potassium (if required by soil test or as a general measure):**
    *   **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** (60% K2O): **15-17 kg/acre**
        *   This provides about 9-10 kg K2O.

**Alternative for Phosphorus (if SSP is not used):**

*   **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5): **35-45 kg/acre**
    *   This will provide 15-20 kg P2O5 and 6-8 kg N.
    *   If using **DAP**, you will need to supplement Sulphur separately and adjust **Urea** dose for Nitrogen.
    *   **Sulphur (if DAP is used):**
        *   **Bentonite Sulphur** (90% S) or **Elemental Sulphur** (90% S): **10-15 kg/acre** (applied at sowing).

### 2. Top-Dressing (25-30 days after sowing):

*   **Nitrogen:**
    *   **Urea** (46% N): **20-25 kg/acre**
        *   This provides the remaining 9-11.5 kg N.

### 3. Nano Fertilizers (Foliar Application):

Nano fertilizers are designed for foliar application to enhance nutrient use efficiency and supplement soil-applied nutrients. They are not a complete replacement for basal fertilizer application.

*   **Nano-Urea (Liquid):**
    *   **Dose:** **2-4 ml/L** of water.
    *   **Application:** Typically 2 sprays are recommended.
        *   First spray: At the branching stage (around 30-40 days after sowing).
        *   Second spray: At the pre-flowering stage (around 50-60 days after sowing).
    *   Use sufficient water volume to ensure good foliage coverage (e.g., 200-250 L/acre).
*   **Nano-DAP (Liquid):**
    *   **Dose:** **2-4 ml/L** of water.
    *   **Application:** Typically 2 sprays are recommended.
        *   First spray: At the branching stage (around 30-40 days after sowing).
        *   Second spray: At the pre-flowering stage (around 50-60 days after sowing).
    *   Use sufficient water volume to ensure good foliage coverage (e.g., 200-250 L/acre).

### 4. NPK Compound Fertilizers:

*   NPK compound fertilizers come in various ratios (e.g., 12:32:16, 10:26:26, 19:19:19).
*   If using an NPK compound, select one that best matches the P and K requirements, and then adjust the **Urea** dose to meet the remaining Nitrogen requirement.
*   **Example (for NPK 12:32:16):** To provide 20 kg P2O5, you would need approximately **60-65 kg/acre** of NPK 12:32:16. This would also supply about 7-8 kg N and 9-10 kg K2O. You would then need to supplement the remaining N (12-13 kg) with **Urea** (25-28 kg/acre) and ensure Sulphur is provided (e.g., through **Bentonite Sulphur**).

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Soil Testing:** Always conduct a soil test to get precise recommendations for your field. This helps in optimizing fertilizer use and preventing nutrient imbalances.
*   **Application Method:** Ensure uniform application of granular fertilizers. For foliar sprays, use a fine mist nozzle for better coverage.
*   **Watering:** Ensure adequate soil moisture after applying granular fertilizers for better nutrient uptake.

This comprehensive approach will help ensure optimal nutrient availability for healthy Cumin growth and good yield in Haryana.
