As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified seed and soil treatment processes for Cumin cultivation in Haryana to manage common diseases like damping-off, wilt, and blight.

### Recommended Seed Treatment Process for Cumin

Seed treatment is a critical first step to protect cumin seedlings from seed-borne and soil-borne pathogens during the vulnerable early stages of growth.

*   **Fungicidal Treatment (Choose ONE of the following options):**
    *   **Option 1 (Systemic + Contact):** Treat seeds with a combination product containing **Carbendazim** 12% + **Mancozeb** 63% WP at a rate of 2-3 g per kg of seed.
    *   **Option 2 (Broad Spectrum Contact):** Treat seeds with **Thiram** 75% WS at a rate of 2.5-3 g per kg of seed.
    *   **Option 3 (Systemic + Contact):** Treat seeds with a combination product containing **Carboxin** 37.5% + **Thiram** 37.5% DS at a rate of 2.5 g per kg of seed.
    *   **Option 4 (Specific for Oomycetes):** If diseases like downy mildew or severe damping-off are historically problematic, treat seeds with **Metalaxyl** 35% WS at a rate of 6 g per kg of seed.

*   **Biological Treatment (Recommended after fungicidal treatment, or as a standalone organic option):**
    *   After applying the chemical fungicide (if used), or directly, treat seeds with **Trichoderma viride** (or **Trichoderma harzianum**) 1% WP at a rate of 5-10 g per kg of seed.
    *   Alternatively, **Pseudomonas fluorescens** 1% WP can be used at 10 g per kg of seed for additional disease suppression and plant growth promotion.

**Process for Seed Treatment:**
1.  First, uniformly coat the seeds with the chosen chemical fungicide.
2.  Allow the treated seeds to dry slightly in the shade.
3.  Then, apply the biological agent (e.g., *Trichoderma*) to the seeds, ensuring an even coating.
4.  Completely dry the seeds in the shade before sowing. This sequential application helps ensure the efficacy of both treatments.

### Recommended Soil Treatment Process for Cumin

Soil treatment primarily focuses on managing soil-borne diseases, particularly cumin wilt (*Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cumini*) and damping-off, which can cause significant losses.

*   **Biological Soil Treatment (Highly Recommended):**
    *   **Trichoderma viride** (or **Trichoderma harzianum**) 1% WP: Mix 2.5-5 kg of the bio-fungicide with 100 kg of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost. Keep this mixture moist and covered in a shaded area for 7-10 days to allow the *Trichoderma* to multiply.
    *   **Application:** Apply this enriched FYM mixture uniformly to the soil at the time of final land preparation, before sowing, covering 1 acre. This establishes a protective microbial barrier against soil-borne pathogens.

*   **Chemical Soil Treatment (If severe disease history or high inoculum pressure is known):**
    *   **Drenching at sowing/post-emergence (for damping-off/wilt):**
        *   Drench the soil around the base of the plants with a solution of **Carbendazim** 50% WP at a concentration of 1-2 g per litre of water, either immediately after sowing or at the first sign of disease. Ensure the soil has adequate moisture before drenching. This is typically used for spot treatment or in problematic areas.
        *   Alternatively, **Propamocarb hydrochloride** 72.2% SL can be used at 2-3 ml per litre of water for drenching, which is particularly effective against oomycete pathogens causing damping-off.

**Process for Soil Treatment:**
1.  **Pre-sowing:** Incorporate the *Trichoderma*-enriched FYM into the soil during the last ploughing or land preparation.
2.  **At/Post-sowing (if needed):** If symptoms of damping-off or wilt appear, apply chemical drenching as a targeted measure.
