As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding the various rot types affecting Cumin, a crucial crop in our region. While the terms you've listed (Root, Stem, Foot, Collar, Crown, Neck, Black, Fruit, Seed, and Seedling rot) describe symptoms, they are primarily caused by a few key fungal diseases in Cumin. Effective management requires an integrated approach combining cultural practices and judicious use of CIBRC-approved fungicides.

Here's a comprehensive guide to control these rot types in Cumin:

**I. General Preventative Measures (Applicable to all Rot Types):**

These cultural practices are fundamental for reducing the incidence and spread of most rot diseases:

*   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid continuous cultivation of Cumin or other susceptible crops (e.g., fennel, coriander) in the same field. A rotation of 3-4 years with non-host crops like cereals (wheat, barley) or legumes can significantly reduce soil-borne pathogen inoculum.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available and suitable for Haryana's agro-climatic conditions, choose Cumin varieties known for their resistance or tolerance to major diseases like Fusarium Wilt. Consult HAU recommendations for the latest varieties.
*   **Field Sanitation:**
    *   Remove and destroy infected plant debris from the previous season.
    *   Control weeds, as they can act as alternate hosts for some pathogens.
*   **Timely Sowing:** Sow Cumin at the recommended time for your region (typically late October to mid-November in Haryana) to avoid periods of high disease pressure.
*   **Optimal Plant Spacing:** Maintain recommended plant-to-plant and row-to-row spacing to ensure good air circulation, which reduces humidity around the plants and discourages fungal growth.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush, succulent growth more susceptible to disease. Provide balanced nutrients based on soil test recommendations.
*   **Irrigation Management:**
    *   Avoid over-irrigation, especially during cooler, humid periods.
    *   Use furrow irrigation instead of flood irrigation where possible, to keep the plant base dry.
    *   Irrigate in the morning to allow foliage to dry before nightfall.
*   **Deep Ploughing/Soil Solarization:** Deep ploughing during summer can expose soil-borne pathogens to high temperatures, reducing their viability. Soil solarization (covering moist soil with clear plastic sheets during hot summer months) can also be effective against soil-borne pathogens.

**II. Specific Disease Management (Addressing Rot Symptoms):**

The various rot types you mentioned are primarily caused by the following diseases in Cumin:

1.  **Fusarium Wilt (Causes Root Rot, Stem Rot, Foot Rot, Collar Rot, Crown Rot, Neck Rot):**
    *   This is the most devastating disease of Cumin, caused by *Fusarium oxysporum* f. sp. *cumini*. It leads to yellowing, wilting, and eventual death of the plant, with internal vascular discoloration at the root and stem base.
    *   **Cultural:** Implement all general preventative measures, especially crop rotation and resistant varieties.
    *   **Chemical (Seed Treatment):** Treat seeds before sowing to protect seedlings from early infection.
        *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 2 g/kg seed.
        *   **Thiram** 75% WS at 2.5 g/kg seed.
        *   **Tebuconazole** 2% DS at 2.5 g/kg seed.
    *   **Chemical (Soil Drenching - for localized outbreaks):**
        *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 1 g/L water, applied around the base of affected plants.

2.  **Damping-off (Causes Seed Rot, Seedling Rot):**
    *   Caused by soil-borne fungi like *Pythium* spp. and *Rhizoctonia solani*. It leads to poor seed germination (seed rot) or collapse of young seedlings at the soil line (seedling rot).
    *   **Cultural:** Ensure good drainage in the seedbed. Avoid sowing too deep or in overly wet soil.
    *   **Chemical (Seed Treatment):** This is the most effective control measure.
        *   **Thiram** 75% WS at 2.5 g/kg seed.
        *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 2 g/kg seed.
        *   **Metalaxyl** 35% WS at 2 g/kg seed (especially effective against *Pythium*).

3.  **Alternaria Blight (Can contribute to Fruit Rot, Seed Rot, and general blighting/blackening):**
    *   Caused by *Alternaria burnsii*. Primarily affects leaves, stems, and umbels, causing dark, concentric spots. Severe infection can lead to blighting of flowers and developing seeds, resulting in shriveled or rotted seeds/fruits. The dark lesions can be perceived as "Black Rot" symptoms.
    *   **Cultural:** Field sanitation, removal of infected debris.
    *   **Chemical (Foliar Spray):** Start spraying at the first appearance of symptoms or at flowering stage, and repeat at 10-15 day intervals depending on disease severity.
        *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP at 2.5 kg/acre (dissolved in 500-750 L water).
        *   **Propiconazole** 25% EC at 200 ml/acre (dissolved in 200-400 L water).
        *   **Tebuconazole** 25.9% EC at 250 ml/acre (dissolved in 200-400 L water).
        *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC at 200 ml/acre (dissolved in 200-400 L water).
        *   **Hexaconazole** 5% SC at 400 ml/acre (dissolved in 200-400 L water).

4.  **Sclerotinia Rot (Causes Stem Rot, Collar Rot):**
    *   Caused by *Sclerotinia sclerotiorum*. Characterized by water-soaked lesions at the stem base or on stems, often covered with white cottony fungal growth and later developing black, hard sclerotia.
    *   **Cultural:** Deep ploughing to bury sclerotia, crop rotation with non-host crops (e.g., cereals), removal of infected plants.
    *   **Chemical (Foliar Spray/Soil Drench):**
        *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 1 g/L water (for drenching or early foliar spray).
        *   **Tebuconazole** 25.9% EC at 250 ml/acre (foliar spray).

By implementing these integrated management strategies, you can effectively control the various rot types and ensure a healthy Cumin crop. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions for chemical application rates and safety precautions.
