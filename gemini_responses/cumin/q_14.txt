Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding soil pests like termites and root-knot nematodes in cumin. These pests can significantly reduce yield and quality. Here's a scientifically verified approach for their control in Haryana:

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Principles:**
For effective and sustainable control, an integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods is recommended. Always conduct a soil test to confirm the presence and severity of nematode infestation before applying nematicides.

### **1. Termite Control in Cumin**

Termites (Odontotermes obesus, Microtermes obesi) can cause significant damage by feeding on roots and stems, leading to wilting and plant death.

**A. Cultural and Preventive Measures:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove crop residues, stubble, and weeds from the field, as these can serve as food sources and breeding grounds for termites.
*   **Deep Plowing:** Deep plowing during summer exposes termite colonies to sunlight and predators, reducing their population.
*   **Organic Matter Management:** Avoid incorporating undecomposed organic matter directly into the soil, as it can attract termites. Ensure proper decomposition before application.
*   **Irrigation Management:** Maintain adequate soil moisture, as termites prefer dry conditions.

**B. Chemical Control (Pre-sowing / At Sowing):**
For severe infestations, chemical treatment is necessary.
*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Fipronil 0.3% GR** at a rate of 10-15 kg/acre during field preparation or at the time of sowing. Mix it thoroughly into the top 10-15 cm of soil.

### **2. Nematode (Root-knot) Control in Cumin**

Root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.) are a major threat to cumin, causing characteristic galls or knots on roots, leading to stunted growth, yellowing, and reduced yield.

**A. Cultural and Preventive Measures:**
*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate cumin with non-host crops like sorghum, pearl millet, or marigold (Tagetes erecta) for at least 2-3 years. Marigold is known to have nematicidal properties.
*   **Summer Deep Plowing/Solarization:** Expose the soil to intense summer heat by deep plowing. Solarization (covering moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets during hot months) can also effectively reduce nematode populations.
*   **Organic Matter Addition:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost (10-15 tonnes/acre) into the soil. This improves soil health and promotes beneficial microorganisms that can suppress nematodes.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** While specific resistant varieties for cumin against root-knot nematodes are not widely available, choosing healthy, certified seeds is crucial.

**B. Biological Control:**
*   **Bio-nematicides:**
    *   Apply **Purpureocillium lilacinum** (formerly *Paecilomyces lilacinus*) or *Trichoderma harzianum* based formulations at 2.5 kg/acre. Mix with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed FYM or sand and broadcast evenly before sowing, followed by light irrigation. These fungi parasitize nematode eggs and juveniles.

**C. Chemical Control (Pre-sowing / At Sowing):**
For confirmed high nematode populations, chemical nematicides can be used.
*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Carbofuran 3% G** at a rate of 10-13 kg/acre during field preparation or at the time of sowing. Incorporate it thoroughly into the soil.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label for safe and effective use.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) while handling chemicals.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and pest severity.
*   Prioritize cultural and biological methods as part of a sustainable pest management strategy.
