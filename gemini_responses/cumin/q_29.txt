This is not known to affect Cumin. "Tinda" refers to a type of gourd, and "Boll" refers to the fruit capsule of cotton. Cumin produces flowers that develop into schizocarps (fruits), not tinda or bolls.

However, flower drop and fruit drop can be significant issues in Cumin, leading to reduced yield. Here's how to control them:

**Causes of Flower and Fruit Drop in Cumin:**

Flower and fruit drop in Cumin are often physiological responses to stress or nutrient imbalances. Common causes include:
*   **Environmental Stress:** High temperatures (especially during flowering and fruit set), sudden temperature fluctuations, water stress (both deficit and excess moisture), high humidity, or strong winds.
*   **Nutritional Deficiencies:** Lack of essential micronutrients like Boron and Calcium, or macronutrients like Phosphorus and Potassium.
*   **Poor Pollination:** Insufficient pollinator activity or adverse weather conditions during the pollination period.
*   **Pest and Disease Infestations:** Severe infestations can weaken the plant, leading to stress and subsequent dropping.
*   **Hormonal Imbalance:** An imbalance of plant hormones (e.g., high ethylene levels, low auxins) can trigger abscission.

**Control Measures for Flower and Fruit Drop in Cumin:**

Effective management involves a combination of good agronomic practices and targeted chemical interventions.

**A. General Agronomic Practices:**

1.  **Optimal Irrigation:**
    *   Maintain consistent soil moisture, especially during the critical stages of flowering and fruit development.
    *   Avoid both waterlogging (which can lead to root rot and stress) and severe drought stress.
    *   Irrigate judiciously based on soil type, weather conditions, and crop stage.
2.  **Balanced Nutrition:**
    *   Conduct soil testing to identify any nutrient deficiencies before sowing.
    *   Apply recommended doses of macro (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium) and micronutrients.
    *   Pay particular attention to micronutrients like Boron and Calcium, which are crucial for flower and fruit retention.
3.  **Weed Management:**
    *   Keep the field free of weeds throughout the crop cycle to reduce competition for water, nutrients, and light.
4.  **Proper Plant Spacing:**
    *   Ensure adequate plant spacing as per recommended practices to allow for good air circulation and light penetration, reducing plant stress.
5.  **Pest and Disease Management:**
    *   Timely identification and control of pests (e.g., aphids, thrips) and diseases (e.g., blight, powdery mildew) that can weaken the plant and indirectly cause flower/fruit drop.

**B. Chemical Interventions (CIBRC Approved, Technical Names, Metric Units):**

1.  **Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs):**
    *   To prevent flower and fruit drop, a foliar spray of **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA)** can be highly effective.
        *   **Dosage:** 5-10 mg/L of water (or 5-10 ppm).
        *   **Timing:** Apply at the pre-flowering stage and/or early fruit set stage. Repeat if necessary, strictly following product label instructions.
2.  **Micronutrient Sprays:**
    *   **Boron:** If Boron deficiency is suspected or confirmed by soil/plant analysis, a foliar spray can be beneficial.
        *   **Chemical:** **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (containing 20% Boron) or **Boric Acid** (containing 17% Boron).
        *   **Dosage:** 1-1.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Timing:** Apply at pre-flowering or early flowering stage.
    *   **Calcium:** For Calcium deficiency, a foliar spray can help.
        *   **Chemical:** **Calcium Nitrate**.
        *   **Dosage:** 2-3 g/L of water.
        *   **Timing:** Apply during flowering and fruit development stages.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the product label for safe and effective use of any chemical.
*   Ensure proper spray coverage for optimal results.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension specialists at HAU, Hisar, for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and soil test reports.
