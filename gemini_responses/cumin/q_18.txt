As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the use of Growth Regulators/Hormones in Cumin for Haryana.

It is crucial to understand the specific roles and recommendations for each substance:

*   **Ethrel (Ethephon)**
    *   This is not commonly recommended as a growth regulator for general yield enhancement or specific developmental stages in Cumin cultivation in Haryana. Its primary applications in other crops relate to ripening or flower induction, which are not standard practices for Cumin in this context.
    *   Therefore, for the purpose of growth regulation in Cumin, **Ethrel (Ethephon)** is not known to be a recommended practice.

*   **2,4-D**
    *   **2,4-D** is primarily known and used as a selective herbicide for broadleaf weed control. While it is a synthetic auxin (a type of plant hormone), its application as a *growth regulator* in Cumin is highly risky and not recommended due to the crop's sensitivity and the potential for severe phytotoxicity even at very low doses. Its use in Cumin is generally avoided or done with extreme caution for weed control, not for growth regulation.
    *   Therefore, for the purpose of growth regulation in Cumin, **2,4-D** is not known to be a recommended practice.

*   **Boron**
    *   Boron is an essential micronutrient critical for various physiological processes in Cumin, especially for flowering, pollen viability, fertilization, and seed development. While not a "hormone" in the same sense as Ethrel or 2,4-D, it is vital for healthy growth and yield. Boron deficiency can significantly impact Cumin production.
    *   **Recommended Dose for Foliar Application:**
        *   Apply **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate, containing 10.5-11.3% Boron) at a concentration of 0.1-0.2% (1-2 g/L of water).
        *   Alternatively, use **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (containing 20% Boron) at a concentration of 0.05-0.1% (0.5-1 g/L of water).
        *   **Application Timing:** Spray 200-400 litres of solution per acre during the pre-flowering to early flowering stage (around 45-60 days after sowing) to ensure adequate Boron availability for flower and seed development. A second spray can be given 15-20 days after the first if deficiency symptoms persist or if soil tests indicate low Boron levels.
