Mites, including Red Spider Mite (*Tetranychus urticae*) and Rust Mite (*Aceria cumini*), are significant pests of Cumin in Haryana, especially during dry and warm weather conditions. Effective management requires an integrated approach.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Mites in Cumin:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Proper Irrigation:** Maintain adequate soil moisture, as mites thrive in dry conditions. Overhead irrigation can help dislodge mites.
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the field free of weeds, as many weeds can act as alternate hosts for mites.
    *   **Timely Sowing:** Adhere to recommended sowing dates to avoid peak mite activity periods.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Conserve natural enemies like predatory mites (*Amblyseius* species), ladybird beetles, and lacewings, which feed on pest mites. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

3.  **Chemical Control (Acaricides):**
    When mite populations reach economic threshold levels, chemical control becomes necessary. Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where mites are often found. Rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

    **For Red Spider Mite (Tetranychus urticae):**
    Apply any one of the following CIBRC approved acaricides:
    *   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** Apply at 0.5 - 0.6 ml/L of water (100-125 ml/acre in 200-250 L of water).
    *   **Propargite 57% EC:** Apply at 1.0 - 1.25 ml/L of water (200-250 ml/acre in 200-250 L of water).
    *   **Fenpyroximate 5% SC:** Apply at 0.5 ml/L of water (100-125 ml/acre in 200-250 L of water).
    *   **Abamectin 1.8% EC:** Apply at 0.4 ml/L of water (80-100 ml/acre in 200-250 L of water).

    **For Rust Mite (Aceria cumini):**
    Apply any one of the following CIBRC approved acaricides:
    *   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP:** Apply at 2.0 - 2.5 g/L of water (400-500 g/acre in 200-250 L of water). Sulphur is particularly effective against rust mites and also helps in managing powdery mildew.
    *   **Propargite 57% EC:** Apply at 1.0 - 1.25 ml/L of water (200-250 ml/acre in 200-250 L of water).
    *   **Abamectin 1.8% EC:** Apply at 0.4 ml/L of water (80-100 ml/acre in 200-250 L of water).

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label for dosage, application method, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Ensure good spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves, as mites are often found there.
*   Monitor the crop regularly for mite infestation and apply acaricides at the initial stages of infestation for better control.
*   Rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in mite populations.
