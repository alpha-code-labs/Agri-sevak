As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), here is the scientifically verified advice regarding the maturity signs, harvesting time, and cutting process for Cumin (Jeera) in Haryana:

**Maturity Signs for Cumin:**

*   The crop typically matures in **100-120 days** after sowing, depending on the variety and prevailing weather conditions.
*   The most prominent sign is the change in color of the plants from green to yellowish-brown or brownish.
*   The leaves start drying and shedding.
*   The umbels (flower clusters) and capsules containing the seeds turn yellowish-brown.
*   The seeds inside the capsules become hard and attain their characteristic aroma and color.
*   When about **70-80% of the umbels** on the plant have matured and changed color, the crop is ready for harvest. Harvesting too early can result in immature, shriveled seeds, while delaying too much can lead to shattering losses.

**Harvesting Time for Cumin:**

*   The optimal harvesting time in Haryana is generally from **late February to mid-March**, depending on the sowing date (which is typically in November).
*   Harvesting should ideally be done in the **morning hours** after the dew has dried, or in the late afternoon, to minimize shattering losses.
*   It is crucial to harvest when the plants are still slightly moist but not wet, as overly dry plants are prone to shattering.

**Cutting Process for Cumin:**

*   Cumin is primarily harvested manually in Haryana.
*   The plants should be cut close to the ground level using a sickle.
*   After cutting, the harvested plants are gathered into small bundles.
*   These bundles are then tied and stacked upright in the field or transported to a clean, dry threshing floor.
*   The bundles are allowed to dry under the sun for **5-7 days** until they are completely dry and brittle. This drying process is crucial for easy threshing and to prevent mold development during storage.
*   Once thoroughly dried, the seeds are separated from the plants by threshing. This can be done by beating the bundles with sticks or by using a small-scale thresher.
*   The threshed material is then winnowed to separate the clean cumin seeds from the chaff.
*   The cleaned seeds should be further dried to a moisture content of **8-10%** before storage to ensure good quality and prevent spoilage.
