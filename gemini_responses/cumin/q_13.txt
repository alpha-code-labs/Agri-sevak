As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm the following regarding your query about Cumin cultivation in Haryana:

*   **Fruit fly:** This is not known to affect Cumin. Fruit flies primarily infest fleshy fruits and some vegetables, not the dry schizocarp fruits of Cumin.
*   **Ber fly (*Carpomyia vesuviana*):** This is not known to affect Cumin. The Ber fly is a highly specific pest of Ber (*Ziziphus mauritiana*) and does not infest Cumin crops.
