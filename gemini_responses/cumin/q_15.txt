As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned conditions in Cumin in Haryana:

### Control Measures for Pests in Cumin

#### Grasshopper

Grasshoppers can cause significant defoliation, especially in young cumin plants, by feeding on leaves and tender shoots.

*   **Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Keep the field and surrounding areas free of weeds, which can serve as alternate hosts and breeding sites.
    *   **Deep Ploughing:** Ploughing the field after harvest can expose grasshopper eggs laid in the soil to predators and adverse weather conditions, reducing the next generation's population.
    *   **Hand Picking:** In cases of low infestation, especially in small fields, grasshoppers can be hand-picked and destroyed.
    *   **Bird Perches:** Install bird perches in the field to encourage predatory birds, which feed on grasshoppers.

*   **Chemical Control (Apply only when infestation is severe and economic threshold is reached):**
    *   **Malathion** 50% EC at 1.25 litres per acre in 500 litres of water.
    *   **Quinalphos** 25% EC at 1.0 litre per acre in 500 litres of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 200-250 ml per acre in 200-400 litres of water.
