Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following cultivation practices for Cumin to ensure optimal yield and quality in Haryana:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   **Line Sowing** is highly recommended over broadcasting. This method facilitates better intercultural operations like weeding, thinning, and irrigation, and also allows for efficient pest and disease management.
    *   The field should be well-prepared with fine tilth.
    *   Seeds should be sown in lines using a seed drill or by making shallow furrows.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   Cumin seeds are small and require shallow planting. The ideal planting depth is **1.5 to 2.0 cm**. Deeper planting can significantly reduce germination rates.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   For line sowing, maintain a row-to-row spacing of **25 to 30 cm**.
    *   After germination, thinning should be carried out to maintain a plant-to-plant spacing of **10 to 15 cm** within the rows. This ensures adequate light penetration, air circulation, and nutrient availability for individual plants.

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   For optimal plant stand and yield, a seed dose of **8 to 10 kg per acre** is recommended when using the line sowing method. Ensure good quality, certified seeds are used for better germination and vigor.
