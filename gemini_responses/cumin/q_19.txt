Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the critical importance of balanced nutrition for optimal Cumin yield and quality. Macro-nutrient deficiencies can significantly impact your crop. Here's how to address Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium deficiencies in Cumin:

It is highly recommended to conduct a soil test before sowing to determine the exact nutrient status of your field. This allows for precise fertilizer application, preventing both deficiencies and over-application.

### Addressing Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

Nitrogen is crucial for vegetative growth, leaf development, and overall plant vigor.

*   **Symptoms:** General yellowing (chlorosis) of older leaves, stunted growth, thin stems, and reduced branching.
*   **Recommended Application:**
    *   For Cumin, a general recommendation is 20-30 kg Nitrogen per acre.
    *   Apply half of the recommended Nitrogen as a basal dose at the time of sowing.
    *   Apply the remaining half as a top-dressing approximately 30-45 days after sowing (DAS), coinciding with the first irrigation.
*   **Chemicals and Rates:**
    *   **Urea** (46% N):
        *   If your soil test indicates a need for 25 kg N per acre, apply approximately 27 kg **Urea** per acre as basal and another 27 kg **Urea** per acre as top-dressing.
    *   For immediate corrective action on visible deficiency, a foliar spray of 1-2% **Urea** solution can be applied (10-20 g **Urea** per litre of water), ensuring complete leaf coverage. Repeat if necessary after 7-10 days.

### Addressing Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

Phosphorus is vital for root development, flowering, seed formation, and energy transfer within the plant.

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, dark green or purplish discoloration of older leaves (less common in Cumin), poor root development, and delayed maturity.
*   **Recommended Application:**
    *   For Cumin, a general recommendation is 15-20 kg P2O5 per acre.
    *   Phosphorus is relatively immobile in the soil, so it is crucial to apply the entire recommended dose as a basal application at the time of sowing, preferably drilled below the seed.
*   **Chemicals and Rates:**
    *   **Diammonium phosphate** (18% N, 46% P2O5):
        *   If your soil test indicates a need for 20 kg P2O5 per acre, apply approximately 43.5 kg **Diammonium phosphate** per acre as a basal dose. This will also supply some Nitrogen.
    *   **Single superphosphate** (16% P2O5):
        *   If your soil test indicates a need for 20 kg P2O5 per acre, apply approximately 125 kg **Single superphosphate** per acre as a basal dose.

### Addressing Potassium (K) Deficiency

Potassium (Potash) enhances disease resistance, improves water use efficiency, strengthens stems, and is crucial for seed filling and overall quality.

*   **Symptoms:** Yellowing and scorching (browning) of leaf margins, especially on older leaves, weak stems, poor seed development, and increased susceptibility to diseases.
*   **Recommended Application:**
    *   For Cumin, a general recommendation is 15-20 kg K2O per acre.
    *   Apply the entire recommended dose as a basal application at the time of sowing.
*   **Chemicals and Rates:**
    *   **Muriate of potash** (60% K2O):
        *   If your soil test indicates a need for 20 kg K2O per acre, apply approximately 33.3 kg **Muriate of potash** per acre as a basal dose.
    *   For immediate corrective action on visible deficiency, a foliar spray of 1-2% **Muriate of potash** solution can be applied (10-20 g **Muriate of potash** per litre of water), ensuring complete leaf coverage. Repeat if necessary after 7-10 days.

### General Recommendations:

*   **Soil Testing:** Always prioritize soil testing to get precise recommendations for your specific field.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management (INM):** Supplement chemical fertilizers with organic manures (Farm Yard Manure, compost) to improve soil health and nutrient availability.
*   **Proper Application:** Ensure fertilizers are applied uniformly and at the correct depth and time for maximum efficiency.
*   **Irrigation:** Adequate and timely irrigation is essential for nutrient uptake by the plants.

By following these scientifically verified recommendations, you can effectively address macro-nutrient deficiencies in your Cumin crop and ensure a healthy, productive harvest.
