As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm the following regarding the conditions you've inquired about for Cumin cultivation:

*   **Scab:** This is not known to affect Cumin.
*   **Canker:** This is not known to affect Cumin.
*   **Gummosis:** This is not known to affect Cumin.
*   **Lichen:** This is not known to affect Cumin.

Cumin (Cuminum cyminum) is primarily affected by diseases such as Fusarium wilt, Alternaria blight, powdery mildew, and root rot, which are the focus of disease management strategies in Haryana. The conditions you listed are typically associated with other crop types or are not recognized as pathogens or conditions directly impacting Cumin plants.
