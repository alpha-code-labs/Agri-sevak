As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Cumin in Haryana.

It is crucial to adopt an Integrated Disease Management (IDM) approach, combining cultural practices with timely and judicious application of CIBRC-approved fungicides. Always ensure proper spray coverage and rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

Here's how to control the specified fungal diseases in Cumin:

### General Cultural Practices for Disease Management:
*   **Use disease-free seeds:** Source seeds from reputable suppliers.
*   **Crop rotation:** Avoid continuous cultivation of Cumin in the same field.
*   **Proper spacing:** Maintain adequate plant spacing to ensure good air circulation, reducing humidity.
*   **Field sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest.
*   **Balanced nutrition:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can make plants more susceptible to certain diseases.
*   **Timely sowing:** Sow at the recommended time for your region to avoid peak disease periods.

### Specific Disease Control Measures:

1.  **Alternaria (Alternaria Blight/Leaf Spot)**
    This is a major fungal disease of Cumin caused by *Alternaria burnsii*.
    *   **Symptoms:** Small, dark brown to black spots appear on leaves, stems, and umbels, which enlarge and coalesce, leading to blight and drying of affected parts.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   **Cultural:** Use resistant varieties if available, practice crop rotation, and remove infected plant debris.
        *   **Chemical:**
            *   Spray with **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2.0-2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5-3.0 g/L water).
            *   Alternatively, spray with **Propiconazole** (25% EC) at 200-250 ml/acre (or 0.5 ml/L water).
            *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC) at 200 ml/acre (or 0.5 ml/L water) can also be effective.
            *   **Tebuconazole** (25.9% EC) at 250 ml/acre (or 0.5 ml/L water).
        *   Initiate spraying at the first appearance of symptoms and repeat at 10-15 day intervals, depending on disease severity.

2.  **Anthracnose**
    This is not known to affect Cumin.

3.  **Blast**
    This is not known to affect Cumin.

4.  **Blight (General)**
    Apart from Alternaria Blight (addressed above), other distinct "blight" diseases are not commonly recognized as major threats to Cumin in Haryana. Therefore, the control measures for Alternaria Blight are generally sufficient for blight-like symptoms.

5.  **Brown spot**
    This is not known to affect Cumin.

6.  **Downy Mildew**
    This disease is caused by *Peronospora umbelliferarum*.
    *   **Symptoms:** Yellowish, irregular patches appear on the upper surface of leaves, while a purplish-grey, downy fungal growth is visible on the corresponding lower surface. Severe infection can lead to stunted growth and reduced yield.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   **Cultural:** Ensure good field drainage, avoid overhead irrigation, and remove infected plant parts.
        *   **Chemical:**
            *   Spray with **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2.0-2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5-3.0 g/L water).
            *   **Metalaxyl + Mancozeb** (8% + 64% WP) at 500 g/acre (or 2.0 g/L water).
            *   **Dimethomorph + Mancozeb** (9% + 60% WP) at 1.0 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L water).
        *   Apply fungicides preventively if conditions are favorable (cool, moist weather) or at the first sign of disease.

7.  **Powdery Mildew**
    This is a significant disease of Cumin, caused by *Erysiphe polygoni* or *Leveillula taurica*.
    *   **Symptoms:** White, powdery patches appear on the leaves, stems, and umbels. These patches enlarge and coalesce, covering the entire plant surface. Severely infected plants show yellowing, drying, and premature defoliation, leading to significant yield loss.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   **Cultural:** Use resistant varieties if available, maintain proper plant spacing, and avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization.
        *   **Chemical:**
            *   Dusting with **Sulfur** (Wettable Sulfur 80% WP) at 2.0-2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5-3.0 g/L water).
            *   Spray with **Dinocap** (48% EC) at 250-300 ml/acre (or 0.5-0.6 ml/L water).
            *   **Myclobutanil** (10% WP) at 120-150 g/acre (or 0.25-0.3 g/L water).
            *   **Penconazole** (10% EC) at 200-250 ml/acre (or 0.4-0.5 ml/L water).
            *   **Tebuconazole** (25.9% EC) at 250 ml/acre (or 0.5 ml/L water).
        *   Begin spraying as soon as the first symptoms appear, especially during dry, cool weather conditions, and repeat at 10-15 day intervals.

8.  **Grey mildew**
    This is not known to affect Cumin.

Always read and follow the instructions on the fungicide label for correct dosage, application method, and pre-harvest interval. For specific local recommendations, please consult your nearest Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or agricultural extension officer.
