As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I advise on the integrated management of sucking pests in Cumin, focusing on scientifically verified methods suitable for Haryana.

**General Management Principles:**

1.  **Regular Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your Cumin crop, especially the undersides of leaves and tender shoots, for the presence of pests. Early detection is key for effective control.
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the field free of weeds, as many weeds act as alternate hosts for these pests.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush growth that attracts sucking pests.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation to break pest cycles.
3.  **Biological Control:** Encourage natural enemies like ladybird beetles, lacewings, and parasitic wasps, which prey on aphids and whiteflies. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides if natural enemy populations are high.
4.  **Yellow Sticky Traps:** Install yellow sticky traps (10-15 traps per acre) to monitor and trap adult whiteflies, leafhoppers, and winged aphids.

**Specific Pest Information:**

*   **Psylla:** This is not known to affect Cumin.

**Chemical Control for Aphids, Leafhopper, Whitefly, and Thrips:**

When pest populations reach economic threshold levels, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Apply insecticides preferably in the evening or early morning hours.

Here are some CIBRC approved technical chemicals for the control of sucking pests in Cumin:

*   **For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips:**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** 125 ml per acre (diluted in 200-250 litres of water).
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** 100 g per acre (diluted in 200-250 litres of water).
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** 80-100 g per acre (diluted in 200-250 litres of water).
    *   **Flonicamid 50% WG:** 60 g per acre (diluted in 200-250 litres of water).
    *   **Fipronil 5% SC:** 400-600 ml per acre (diluted in 200-250 litres of water).

*   **Primarily for Aphids and Leafhoppers:**
    *   **Dimethoate 30% EC:** 330 ml per acre (diluted in 200-250 litres of water).

*   **Primarily for Whiteflies (especially nymphs) and Mites:**
    *   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** 200 ml per acre (diluted in 200-250 litres of water).
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** 320 ml per acre (diluted in 200-250 litres of water).

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Read the Label:** Always read and follow the instructions on the insecticide label for correct dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   **Safety:** Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and application.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Be mindful of the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) for each chemical to ensure the safety of the harvested produce.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pest resistance. Avoid repeated use of the same chemical group.
