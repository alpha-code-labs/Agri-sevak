Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding Scale insects and Mealybugs in Cumin. Both these pests are sap-suckers and can significantly impact cumin yield if not managed effectively. Here's a scientifically verified approach for their control:

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Approach:**

Effective control involves a combination of practices:

1.  **Regular Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your cumin fields, especially the undersides of leaves, stems, and flower heads, for early signs of these pests. Look for cottony masses (mealybugs) or small, immobile bumps (scales).
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy severely infested plant parts or weeds that might harbor these pests.
    *   **Balanced Nutrition:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, as it can lead to lush, soft growth that is more attractive to sap-sucking insects.
    *   **Water Management:** Ensure proper irrigation to avoid plant stress, which can make plants more susceptible.
3.  **Biological Control:** Conserve natural enemies like ladybird beetles, lacewings, and parasitic wasps, which prey on or parasitize mealybugs and scale insects. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

**Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved):**

When pest populations are high and cultural/biological methods are insufficient, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always use CIBRC approved technical chemical names and follow recommended dosages. Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and stems where these pests often hide. Adding a good quality spreading agent/sticker to the spray solution can enhance efficacy.

Here are some recommended insecticides:

*   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply 125-150 ml per acre (or 0.5-0.6 ml per litre of water).
*   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply 50-100 g per acre (or 0.2-0.4 g per litre of water).
*   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply 500-600 ml per acre (or 2-2.4 ml per litre of water). This is an insect growth regulator, effective against nymphs and preventing molting.
*   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:** Apply 200-250 ml per acre (or 0.8-1 ml per litre of water). This is a dual-systemic insecticide, moving both upwards and downwards in the plant.
*   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply 50-100 g per acre (or 0.2-0.4 g per litre of water).

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Rotation:** To prevent the development of insecticide resistance, rotate between different classes of insecticides (those with different modes of action).
*   **Timing:** Apply insecticides when pest populations are manageable, preferably in the early morning or late evening to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) like gloves, mask, and protective clothing while handling and spraying chemicals. Read and follow the instructions on the product label carefully, including the pre-harvest interval (PHI).
