Namaste! The "drying up" symptoms you observe in Cumin, affecting branches, leaves, fruits, and flowers, are a serious concern and can significantly impact yield. In Haryana, these symptoms are primarily associated with specific fungal diseases and, to a lesser extent, pest infestations or abiotic stresses. Accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective management.

Here are the most common causes of "drying up" in Cumin in our region and their recommended management strategies:

### 1. Fusarium Wilt (Ukhata)

This is the most devastating disease causing sudden wilting and drying of Cumin plants.
*   **Symptoms:** Plants suddenly wilt, turn yellow, and dry up, often in patches. The wilting may start from one side of the plant. If you cut the stem near the base, you might observe brown discoloration in the vascular tissue.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Cultural Practices:**
        *   Practice a long crop rotation (at least 3-4 years) with non-host crops like cereals.
        *   Deep summer ploughing helps expose fungal spores to sunlight.
        *   Use resistant or tolerant varieties if available and suitable for your area.
        *   Ensure balanced nutrition and avoid waterlogging, as stressed plants are more susceptible.
    *   **Seed Treatment:** This is critical for prevention.
        *   Treat seeds with **Carbendazim** 50% WP @ 2 g/kg seed.
        *   Alternatively, use **Thiram** 75% WS @ 2.5 g/kg seed.
        *   For biological control, treat seeds with **Trichoderma viride** @ 4 g/kg seed.
    *   **Soil Drenching (if early symptoms appear):**
        *   Drench the soil around affected plants with **Carbendazim** 50% WP @ 1 kg/acre in 200-400 L of water.
        *   Alternatively, drench with **Propiconazole** 25% EC @ 1 ml/L water.
        *   Apply **Trichoderma viride** @ 2.5 kg/acre mixed with 50 kg of Farm Yard Manure (FYM) before sowing or as a drench around the root zone.

### 2. Alternaria Blight (Jhulas Rog)

This disease can cause significant drying of foliage and reproductive parts.
*   **Symptoms:** Small, circular to irregular brown spots with concentric rings appear on leaves, stems, and umbels. Severe infection leads to blighting, drying, and premature defoliation, affecting flowers and developing fruits, causing them to dry up.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Cultural Practices:**
        *   Use disease-free seeds.
        *   Maintain proper plant spacing to ensure good air circulation.
        *   Practice field sanitation by removing and destroying infected plant debris.
        *   Avoid overhead irrigation late in the day, which can prolong leaf wetness.
    *   **Foliar Sprays (preventive and curative):**
        *   Start spraying at the first appearance of symptoms or preventively during susceptible stages. Repeat at 10-15 day intervals.
        *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP @ 2.5 g/L water.
        *   **Propiconazole** 25% EC @ 1 ml/L water.
        *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC @ 0.5 ml/L water.
        *   **Tebuconazole** 250 EC @ 1 ml/L water.

### 3. Powdery Mildew

While primarily a white powdery growth, severe infections can lead to leaf yellowing and drying.
*   **Symptoms:** White, powdery patches appear on leaves, stems, and umbels. Severely infected leaves may turn yellow, curl, and dry prematurely.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Cultural Practices:**
        *   Use resistant varieties if available.
        *   Ensure proper plant spacing.
    *   **Foliar Sprays:**
        *   **Wettable Sulphur** 80% WP @ 2.5-3 g/L water.
        *   **Dinocarb** 48% EC @ 0.5 ml/L water.
        *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC @ 0.5 ml/L water.
        *   **Tebuconazole** 250 EC @ 1 ml/L water.

### 4. Aphids and Thrips (Sucking Pests)

Severe infestations can cause significant stress, leading to yellowing and drying of plant parts.
*   **Symptoms:** Curling, yellowing, and drying of leaves, stunted growth, presence of honeydew and sooty mold. Heavy feeding can lead to overall plant decline and drying, especially during flowering and fruit development.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Cultural Practices:**
        *   Remove weeds from around the field, as they can harbor pests.
        *   Use yellow sticky traps to monitor and trap adult pests.
    *   **Biological Control:**
        *   Conserve natural enemies like ladybird beetles and lacewings.
    *   **Chemical Control (if severe):**
        *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL @ 0.25 ml/L water.
        *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG @ 0.2 g/L water.
        *   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP @ 0.2 g/L water.

### 5. Root-knot Nematodes

These microscopic worms damage roots, impairing water and nutrient uptake, which can lead to wilting and drying symptoms, often predisposing plants to wilt diseases.
*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, yellowing, wilting, and drying of plants, poor yield. Galls (swellings) on roots are a characteristic sign.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Cultural Practices:**
        *   Crop rotation with non-host crops (e.g., cereals, marigold).
        *   Deep summer ploughing.
        *   Incorporation of organic amendments like neem cake @ 200 kg/acre.
    *   **Biological Control:**
        *   Apply **Paecilomyces lilacinus** or **Purpureocillium lilacinum** @ 2.5 kg/acre mixed with 50 kg FYM at the time of sowing.

### General Recommendations:

*   **Accurate Diagnosis:** It is crucial to correctly identify the specific cause of drying. If unsure, collect samples and consult with HAU experts for precise identification.
*   **Integrated Pest and Disease Management (IPM):** Always combine cultural, biological, and chemical methods for sustainable and effective control.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Prioritize the use of disease-resistant or tolerant Cumin varieties recommended for Haryana.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure your Cumin crop receives balanced nutrients to enhance its natural resistance to diseases and pests.
*   **Proper Irrigation:** Avoid both drought stress and waterlogging, as both can weaken plants and make them susceptible to drying.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy diseased plant debris to reduce inoculum sources.

By implementing these scientifically verified strategies, you can effectively address the "drying up" problem in your Cumin crop.
