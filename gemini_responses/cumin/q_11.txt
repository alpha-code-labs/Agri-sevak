As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the control of Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies in Cumin cultivation in Haryana:

### Control of Beetles in Cumin

While several types of beetles exist, the most commonly observed beetle pest in Cumin, particularly during the flowering stage, is the **Blister Beetle (Mylabris pustulata)**. Other general beetles are not typically considered major pests of Cumin.

**Blister Beetles:**
*   **Damage:** Blister beetles feed on the flowers, including petals and pollen, which can lead to reduced seed setting and yield loss if the infestation is severe.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Manual Collection:** For small infestations, especially in the early stages, manual collection of beetles in the morning or evening and their destruction can be an effective non-chemical method.
    *   **Chemical Control:** If the infestation is high and poses a significant threat to the crop, chemical intervention may be necessary. Apply insecticides preferably in the evening.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC**: Apply at a rate of 200-250 ml per acre, mixed in 200-400 litres of water.
        *   **Malathion 50% EC**: Apply at a rate of 1.0-1.25 litres per acre, mixed in 500 litres of water.

### Control of Weevils in Cumin

Weevils are generally **not known to be significant field pests of Cumin** in Haryana. While some weevil species are storage pests of grains, they do not typically cause economic damage to standing Cumin crops. Therefore, specific field control measures for weevils in Cumin are usually not required.

### Control of Sawflies in Cumin

Sawflies are **not known to affect Cumin**. They are primarily pests of other crop families (e.g., crucifers, cereals) or trees. There are no reported instances of sawfly infestations causing damage to Cumin crops in Haryana. Therefore, no specific control measures are recommended for sawflies in Cumin.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always monitor your crop regularly for pest incidence.
*   Apply pesticides only when necessary and strictly follow the manufacturer's instructions regarding dosage, application method, and pre-harvest interval.
*   Consider integrated pest management (IPM) approaches, which combine cultural, biological, and chemical methods for sustainable pest control.
