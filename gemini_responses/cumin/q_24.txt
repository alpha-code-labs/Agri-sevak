Cumin (Cuminum cyminum) is generally **not recommended for transplantation** due to its delicate taproot system and poor establishment success after transplanting. It is highly sensitive to root disturbance, which can lead to significant yield reduction or plant mortality.

Therefore, the ideal and scientifically recommended method for cumin cultivation is **direct sowing**. Below are the ideal parameters for direct sowing in Haryana:

**1. Ideal Sowing Time (Equivalent to 'Transplantation Time' if it were viable):**
*   The optimal period for direct sowing cumin in Haryana is from **mid-October to mid-November**.
    *   Early sowing (before mid-October) can increase susceptibility to blight disease.
    *   Late sowing (after mid-November) can lead to higher incidence of powdery mildew and reduced yields due to shorter growing periods and exposure to higher temperatures during critical development stages.

**2. Ideal Sowing Distance (Equivalent to 'Transplantation Distance' if it were viable):**
*   **Row-to-row spacing:** **25-30 cm**
*   **Plant-to-plant spacing:** **5-10 cm** (achieved through thinning after emergence)

**3. Ideal Sowing Process (Instead of 'Transplantation Process'):**
*   **Land Preparation:** Prepare a fine, well-pulverized seedbed free of clods and weeds. Ensure good drainage.
*   **Seed Rate:** Use a seed rate of **12-15 kg per acre** for optimal plant stand.
*   **Sowing Method:**
    *   Sow seeds in shallow furrows at a depth of **1-2 cm**. Deeper sowing can hinder germination.
    *   Row sowing is preferred over broadcasting as it facilitates inter-cultivation, weeding, and other management practices.
*   **Thinning:** Approximately **3-4 weeks after sowing**, when plants have developed 2-3 true leaves, thin them to maintain the desired plant-to-plant spacing of 5-10 cm. This ensures adequate space, light, and nutrient availability for individual plants.
*   **First Irrigation:** Apply a light irrigation immediately after sowing to ensure proper germination. Subsequent irrigations should be given as per soil moisture status and crop requirement.
