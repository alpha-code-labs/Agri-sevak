As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding rust diseases in Cumin for Haryana.

It is important to clarify which rust diseases are known to affect Cumin.

*   **Black Rust (*Puccinia graminis*)**: This is not known to affect Cumin. It primarily affects cereal crops like wheat, barley, and oats.
*   **Brown Rust (*Puccinia recondita*)**: This is not known to affect Cumin. It primarily affects cereal crops, especially wheat.
*   **Yellow Rust (*Puccinia striiformis*)**: This is not known to affect Cumin. It primarily affects cereal crops like wheat and barley.
*   **White Rust (*Albugo candida*)**: This is not known to affect Cumin. It primarily affects cruciferous crops (e.g., mustard, radish) and some other plant families.
*   **Red Rust**: While "Red Rust" can be a general term, the primary and most significant rust disease affecting Cumin is **Cumin Rust**, caused by the fungus *Puccinia cumini*. This is the disease we need to focus on for control in Cumin.

### Control of Cumin Rust (*Puccinia cumini*)

Cumin Rust is a serious disease that can cause significant yield losses. Integrated disease management, combining cultural practices and timely chemical applications, is crucial for effective control.

**I. Cultural Practices:**

1.  **Use Disease-Free Seeds:** Always use certified, healthy seeds from a reputable source to prevent primary infection.
2.  **Early Sowing:** Sowing cumin early in the season can help the crop escape the peak period of disease development, as the disease often becomes severe with rising temperatures and humidity later in the season.
3.  **Proper Spacing:** Maintain adequate plant spacing to ensure good air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce humidity and fungal growth.
4.  **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, as it can lead to lush, succulent growth that is more susceptible to rust infection. Maintain a balanced nutrient supply.
5.  **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest to reduce the inoculum for the next season.
6.  **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-umbelliferous crops to break the disease cycle.

**II. Chemical Control (Fungicides):**

Fungicides should be applied preventively or at the very first appearance of symptoms. Repeat applications may be necessary depending on disease severity and weather conditions. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions for specific product use.

Here are CIBRC approved technical chemical names and their recommended dosages for rust control in Cumin:

*   **Propiconazole** (25% EC): Apply at a rate of **200-250 ml per acre** in 200-250 litres of water.
*   **Difenoconazole** (25% EC): Apply at a rate of **100-150 ml per acre** in 200-250 litres of water.
*   **Tebuconazole** (25.9% EC): Apply at a rate of **250-300 ml per acre** in 200-250 litres of water.
*   **Mancozeb** (75% WP): Apply at a rate of **2.0-2.5 kg per acre** in 500-600 litres of water, or **2.0-2.5 g per litre** of water. This can be used as a preventive spray.
*   **Sulphur** (Wettable Powder 80% WP): Apply at a rate of **2.0-2.5 kg per acre** in 500-600 litres of water, or **2.0-2.5 g per litre** of water. This is often used as a preventive measure or at early stages.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Timing:** The first spray should ideally be given preventively if rust is historically a problem in your area, or immediately upon the appearance of the first rust pustules.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough coverage of the plant foliage for effective control.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of fungicide resistance. For example, alternate between a triazole (e.g., Propiconazole, Tebuconazole) and a dithiocarbamate (e.g., Mancozeb).
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and application of fungicides. Follow all safety guidelines and pre-harvest intervals (PHI) mentioned on the product label.

For specific local recommendations and current disease outbreaks, it is always advisable to consult with the plant pathology department at HAU, Hisar, or your local agricultural extension officer.
