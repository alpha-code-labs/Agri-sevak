As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Cucumber, keeping in mind CIBRC approved chemicals and practices suitable for Haryana.

It is crucial to adopt an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, which includes cultural practices, biological control, and judicious use of chemical pesticides only when necessary. Always consult your local agricultural extension officer for the most current and specific recommendations for your region and crop stage.

Here's how to control the specified pests:

### 1. Borers (Primarily Fruit Borers like Melon Fruit Fly and Melon Worm)

In cucumber, the primary "borer" type damage is often caused by the larvae of the Melon Fruit Fly (*Bactrocera cucurbitae*) which bore into the developing fruits, or sometimes the Melon Worm (*Diaphania indica*) which can also bore into fruits in addition to feeding on leaves.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Collect and destroy infested fruits regularly to break the pest cycle.
    *   Use pheromone traps (e.g., cucurbit lure traps) to monitor and mass trap male fruit flies.
    *   Bagging of fruits can protect them from fruit fly oviposition.
*   **Chemical Control (Apply when pest incidence crosses economic threshold level):**
    *   For Melon Fruit Fly (Bait Spray): Prepare a bait spray by mixing 100 g jaggery or sugar with 10 ml of **Malathion** 50% EC in 1 litre of water. Spray this mixture on small patches of leaves (not the entire plant) at 7-10 day intervals, especially during fruit development.
    *   For Fruit Borers/Melon Worm:
        *   **Spinosad** 45% SC: 160 ml per acre (approx. 0.32 ml/L of water).
        *   **Cyantraniliprole** 10.26% OD: 180 ml per acre (approx. 0.36 ml/L of water).

### 2. Caterpillars (General Defoliators like Tobacco Caterpillar, Semiloopers)

Various lepidopteran larvae (caterpillars) can feed on cucumber leaves, causing defoliation.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Regular monitoring for egg masses and young larvae. Hand-picking and destroying them can be effective in small areas.
    *   Maintain field hygiene.
*   **Biological Control:**
    *   Encourage natural enemies like parasitic wasps and predatory bugs.
*   **Chemical Control (Apply when pest incidence crosses economic threshold level):**
    *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG: 88 g per acre (approx. 0.176 g/L of water).
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC: 60 ml per acre (approx. 0.12 ml/L of water).
    *   **Bacillus thuringiensis** (Bt) formulations: 500-1000 g per acre (approx. 1-2 g/L of water), effective against young larvae.

### 3. Diamondback Moth

This is not known to affect Cucumber. Diamondback moth (*Plutella xylostella*) is a specific pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower, mustard).

### 4. Leaf Folder (Assuming Melon Worm, *Diaphania indica*)

While specific "leaf folders" like those in rice are not common in cucumber, the Melon Worm (*Diaphania indica*) is a significant pest that folds leaves, webs them together, and feeds inside, in addition to damaging flowers and fruits.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Regular field scouting to detect early signs of leaf folding or webbing.
    *   Remove and destroy infested leaves or plant parts.
*   **Chemical Control (Apply when pest incidence crosses economic threshold level):**
    *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG: 88 g per acre (approx. 0.176 g/L of water).
    *   **Spinosad** 45% SC: 160 ml per acre (approx. 0.32 ml/L of water).
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC: 60 ml per acre (approx. 0.12 ml/L of water).

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Spray Volume:** For most foliar sprays, use 400-500 litres of water per acre to ensure thorough coverage. Adjust the per litre dosage accordingly.
*   **Safety:** Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label, including dosage, timing, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and safety precautions. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.
*   **Pollinators:** Be mindful of pollinator activity, especially during flowering. Apply insecticides in the late evening or early morning when pollinators are less active, or choose pollinator-friendly options where available.
