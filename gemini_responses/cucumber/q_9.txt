Mites (Red spider mite and Rust mite) are indeed significant pests of cucumber in Haryana, causing considerable damage if not managed effectively.

**Symptoms of Mite Infestation:**

*   **Red Spider Mite (Tetranychus urticae):** Small, reddish-brown mites visible on the underside of leaves. They cause yellowing, stippling (tiny white or yellow spots), and bronzing of leaves. In severe infestations, fine webbing may be observed on the underside of leaves and between leaves and stems. Leaves may eventually dry up and fall.
*   **Rust Mite (Eriophyid mites, e.g., Aculops lycopersici, though more common in tomato, other species can affect cucurbits):** These mites are microscopic and not visible to the naked eye. Their feeding causes bronzing, russeting, or a "rusty" appearance on leaves and stems. Leaves may become leathery, curled, and stunted. Fruit can also be affected, showing rough, bronzed patches.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Mites in Cucumber:**

A holistic approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods is recommended.

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Regular Monitoring:** Inspect plants frequently, especially the underside of leaves, for early signs of mites.
    *   **Water Spray:** A strong jet of water can dislodge mites from the plants, especially in early stages of infestation.
    *   **Remove Infested Leaves:** Prune and destroy severely infested leaves or plants to reduce mite populations.
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the field and surrounding areas free of weeds, as many weeds can serve as alternate hosts for mites.
    *   **Proper Irrigation and Nutrition:** Healthy plants are more tolerant to pest damage. Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can promote mite reproduction.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate cucumber with non-host crops to break the pest cycle.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   **Predatory Mites:** Naturally occurring predatory mites (e.g., *Amblyseius* species) can feed on pest mites. Conserve these natural enemies by avoiding broad-spectrum pesticides. Commercial release of predatory mites can be considered if available and economically viable.

3.  **Chemical Control:**
    While mites are a serious pest of cucumber, based on current CIBRC (Central Insecticides Board & Registration Committee) records, there are no acaricides explicitly approved for the control of mites (Red spider mite and Rust mite) on cucumber. It is crucial to use only CIBRC-approved chemicals for specific crop-pest combinations to ensure safety, efficacy, and compliance with regulations.

    Therefore, it is strongly advised to consult with your local Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or the extension specialists at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU), Hisar, for the most up-to-date and specific recommendations regarding chemical control options that may be approved or recommended based on local research and evolving CIBRC guidelines. They can provide guidance on any recent approvals or specific recommendations for your region.
