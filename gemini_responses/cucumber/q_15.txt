As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Cucumber in Haryana:

### Grasshopper

Grasshoppers are polyphagous pests that can cause significant damage to cucumber plants by feeding on leaves, stems, and young fruits.

**Control Measures:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Maintain field sanitation by removing weeds and crop residues that can serve as breeding grounds.
    *   Deep ploughing after harvest can expose grasshopper eggs to predators and adverse weather conditions.
2.  **Chemical Control (if infestation is severe):**
    *   **Malathion** 50% EC: Apply at 1.0 - 1.5 L per acre (2-3 ml/L of water).
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: Apply at 200 - 250 ml per acre (0.4-0.5 ml/L of water).
    *   **Fipronil** 5% SC: Apply at 600 - 800 ml per acre (1.2-1.6 ml/L of water).
    *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: Apply at 1.0 - 1.25 L per acre (2-2.5 ml/L of water).

### Painted bug (Bagrada hilaris)

This is not known to affect Cucumber. Painted bug is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops like mustard, cabbage, and cauliflower.

### Red cotton bug (Dysdercus cingulatus)

This is not known to affect Cucumber. Red cotton bug is primarily a pest of cotton, okra, and other malvaceous plants, feeding on developing seeds.

### Black ants

Black ants are generally not direct primary pests of cucumber plants, but they can cause indirect damage by:
*   Tending and protecting sap-sucking pests like aphids and mealybugs, which excrete honeydew that ants feed on. This can lead to increased populations of these primary pests.
*   Occasionally damaging young seedlings or roots, or creating nests that disturb root systems.

**Control Measures:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Maintain good field hygiene to reduce alternative food sources for ants.
    *   Remove weeds that might harbor other pests tended by ants.
2.  **Control of Primary Pests:**
    *   If ants are present due to the presence of aphids or mealybugs, focus on controlling these sap-sucking pests. Once their food source (honeydew) is removed, the ants will naturally disperse.
3.  **Direct Chemical Control (if ants are directly damaging seedlings or their presence is problematic):**
    *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: As a drench around ant nests or along ant trails at the base of plants, use 2.5 ml/L of water. Avoid direct contact with edible parts of the plant.
    *   **Fipronil** 5% SC: Can be used as a drench or spot spray around ant activity areas at 1.2-1.6 ml/L of water.
    *   Ant baits containing **Fipronil** or **Hydramethylnon** can be strategically placed *outside* the immediate crop area to target ant colonies, ensuring they do not contaminate the crop. Always follow product label instructions for safe and effective use.

**Important Note:** Always read and follow the instructions on the product label for specific dosage, application method, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and safety precautions. Consult with your local agricultural extension officer for the most current and specific recommendations for your region.
