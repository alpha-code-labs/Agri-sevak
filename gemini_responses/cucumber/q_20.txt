Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the critical role micronutrients play in ensuring healthy growth and high yields in cucumber cultivation. Before addressing any deficiency, it is paramount to conduct a comprehensive soil test. This provides accurate information about the nutrient status of your soil and helps in making precise recommendations, preventing both deficiencies and toxicities.

Here's how to address common micronutrient deficiencies in cucumber:

### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Stunted plant growth, small and narrow leaves (often called "little leaf"), interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) primarily on younger leaves, and sometimes a rosetting appearance of leaves.

**Management:**
*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Zinc sulfate heptahydrate** at 10-25 kg/acre as a basal application or broadcast before sowing/planting.
*   **Foliar Application:**
    *   Spray a 0.5% solution of **Zinc sulfate heptahydrate** (5 g/L of water).
    *   Alternatively, use **Zinc EDTA** (chelated zinc) at 0.1-0.2% solution (1-2 g/L of water).
    *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, starting from 3-4 true leaf stage.

### 2. Iron (Fe) / Ferrous Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Pronounced interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on young leaves, while the veins remain distinctly green. In severe cases, the entire leaf may turn yellow or even white. This is common in high pH soils prevalent in Haryana.

**Management:**
*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Soil application of iron is often less effective in high pH soils. However, if used, apply **Ferrous sulfate** at 20-50 kg/acre or **Iron EDTA** at 5-10 kg/acre.
*   **Foliar Application (most effective for quick correction):**
    *   Spray a 0.5-1% solution of **Ferrous sulfate** (5-10 g/L of water) with a suitable wetting agent.
    *   Alternatively, use **Iron EDTA** (chelated iron) at 0.1-0.2% solution (1-2 g/L of water).
    *   Repeat sprays at 7-10 day intervals until symptoms disappear.

### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Stunted growth, death of growing points (terminal buds), brittle and thickened leaves, cracking of stems and petioles, poor fruit set, and malformed or hollow fruits.

**Management:**
*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate) at 2-4 kg/acre. Apply carefully as the margin between deficiency and toxicity is narrow.
*   **Foliar Application:**
    *   Spray a 0.1-0.2% solution of **Borax** (1-2 g/L of water) or **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (Solubor) at the same concentration.
    *   Apply before flowering and repeat during fruit development if needed.

### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Blossom end rot in fruits (a common and significant issue in cucumber, where the blossom end of the fruit becomes water-soaked, then shrivels and turns black), stunted growth, death of growing points, distorted young leaves, and marginal necrosis (browning of leaf edges).

**Management:**
*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Gypsum** (Calcium sulfate dihydrate) at 200-500 kg/acre, especially in soils with low calcium or high sodium.
    *   Incorporate **Calcium nitrate** as part of your fertigation program or as a basal application at 10-20 kg/acre.
*   **Foliar Application:**
    *   Spray a 0.5-1% solution of **Calcium chloride** (5-10 g/L of water) or **Calcium nitrate** (5-10 g/L of water).
    *   Start spraying at fruit set and repeat every 7-10 days, especially during periods of rapid fruit development or high temperatures.

### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on older leaves, while the veins remain green. In severe cases, leaves may develop a purplish tint and premature defoliation can occur.

**Management:**
*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Magnesium sulfate** (Epsom salt) at 10-20 kg/acre.
    *   If soil pH needs adjustment and magnesium is low, apply **Dolomite** (Calcium magnesium carbonate) at 100-200 kg/acre.
*   **Foliar Application:**
    *   Spray a 0.5-1% solution of **Magnesium sulfate** (5-10 g/L of water).
    *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals.

### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, often appearing as a mottled or speckled pattern. Stunted growth and sometimes necrotic spots may develop on leaves.

**Management:**
*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Manganese sulfate** at 5-10 kg/acre.
*   **Foliar Application:**
    *   Spray a 0.25-0.5% solution of **Manganese sulfate** (2.5-5 g/L of water).
    *   Alternatively, use **Manganese EDTA** (chelated manganese) at 0.1-0.2% solution (1-2 g/L of water).
    *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Soil Testing:** Always start with a soil test to confirm deficiencies and determine precise application rates.
*   **Timing:** Foliar applications are most effective when applied in the early morning or late evening to avoid rapid drying and maximize absorption.
*   **Wetting Agents:** Always use a non-ionic wetting agent with foliar sprays to improve coverage and absorption.
*   **Multiple Applications:** For severe deficiencies, multiple foliar applications at recommended intervals may be necessary.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management:** Combine these specific treatments with a balanced primary and secondary nutrient program for overall plant health.
*   **Water Quality:** Ensure the water used for spraying is of good quality and has an appropriate pH.
