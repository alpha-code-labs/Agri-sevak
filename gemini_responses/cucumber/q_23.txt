As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified seed and soil treatment processes for Cucumber cultivation in Haryana to ensure healthy plant establishment and mitigate early disease and pest challenges.

### Recommended Seed Treatment Process for Cucumber

Seed treatment is crucial for protecting germinating seeds and young seedlings from seed-borne and early soil-borne pathogens, particularly those causing damping-off.

*   **Fungicide Treatment:**
    *   To protect against a broad spectrum of fungal pathogens causing damping-off and seedling blight, treat seeds with:
        *   **Thiram** 75% WS @ 2.5-3.0 g per kg of seed.
        *   OR **Captan** 50% WP @ 2.5-3.0 g per kg of seed.
    *   *Application:* Mix the chosen fungicide thoroughly with the cucumber seeds just before sowing. Ensure uniform coating of the seeds.
*   **Biological Agent (Optional, but Recommended for Enhanced Protection):**
    *   For additional protection against soil-borne diseases and to promote early root development, apply:
        *   *Trichoderma viride* (or *Trichoderma harzianum*) @ 4-5 g per kg of seed.
    *   *Application:* If using both chemical and biological treatments, apply the chemical fungicide first, allow it to dry slightly, and then apply the biological agent. If only biological treatment is preferred, mix thoroughly with seeds just before sowing.

### Recommended Soil Treatment Process for Cucumber

Soil treatment aims to manage soil-borne diseases and pests, particularly nematodes, which can severely impact cucumber yields.

*   **For Soil-borne Fungal Diseases (e.g., Damping-off, Fusarium Wilt):**
    *   **Biological Agent:**
        *   *Trichoderma viride* (or *Trichoderma harzianum*) @ 2.5 kg per acre.
    *   *Application:* Mix the *Trichoderma* formulation with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed Farmyard Manure (FYM) or compost. Keep the mixture moist in a shaded area for 7-10 days to allow the fungus to multiply. Then, broadcast this enriched mixture evenly over the field and incorporate it into the soil during the final land preparation, ideally 7-10 days before sowing or transplanting.
*   **For Nematode Management (e.g., Root-knot Nematodes):**
    *   **Biological Agent:**
        *   *Paecilomyces lilacinus* (or *Purpureocillium lilacinum*) @ 2.5 kg per acre.
    *   *Application:* Similar to *Trichoderma*, mix *Paecilomyces lilacinus* with 50-100 kg of FYM/compost, keep moist for 7-10 days, and then broadcast and incorporate into the soil during final land preparation.
    *   **Chemical Nematicide (if severe nematode infestation is anticipated or confirmed based on soil testing or previous crop history):**
        *   **Cadusafos** 10% G @ 10 kg per acre.
        *   *Application:* Broadcast evenly and incorporate into the soil to a depth of 10-15 cm during final land preparation, just before sowing or transplanting.
        *   OR **Fluopyram** 34.48% SC @ 125-150 ml per acre.
        *   *Application:* Apply as a soil drench or through drip irrigation around the root zone at the time of sowing/transplanting or within 7-10 days after.

Always ensure proper soil moisture for optimal efficacy of both biological and chemical treatments. Consult with local agricultural extension services for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and pest/disease history.
