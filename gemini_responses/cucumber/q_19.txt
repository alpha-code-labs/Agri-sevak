Addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium) in cucumber is crucial for healthy growth and optimal yield. As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I strongly recommend a scientific approach, starting with a soil test.

**General Recommendation:**
Before any application, it is highly recommended to conduct a **soil test** through a certified laboratory. This will provide precise information on the existing nutrient levels in your field and help determine the exact quantities of fertilizers required, preventing over-application and nutrient imbalances.

Here's how to address specific macro-nutrient deficiencies in cucumber:

### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   General yellowing or pale green colour of older leaves, progressing to younger leaves.
*   Stunted growth and reduced plant vigour.
*   Smaller leaves and fewer fruits.

**Correction Methods:**

*   **Soil Application (Basal or Top Dressing):**
    *   Apply **Urea** (46% N) at 50-75 kg/acre in 2-3 split doses during the growing season. The first dose can be at planting/sowing, followed by subsequent doses at vegetative growth and fruit development stages.
    *   Alternatively, **Calcium Nitrate** (15.5% N) can be used at 100-150 kg/acre in split doses, especially beneficial in soils requiring calcium.
*   **Foliar Application (for quick correction of mild to moderate deficiency):**
    *   Spray **Urea** (low biuret grade) at a concentration of 10-15 g/L of water. Apply during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening). Repeat after 7-10 days if symptoms persist.

### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   Dark green or bluish-green leaves, sometimes with a purplish tint on the undersides of older leaves.
*   Stunted growth, poor root development.
*   Delayed flowering and maturity.
*   Reduced fruit set and yield.

**Correction Methods:**

*   **Soil Application (Basal application, as P is less mobile in soil):**
    *   Apply **Single Super Phosphate** (16% P2O5) at 100-150 kg/acre as a basal application before planting or sowing.
    *   Alternatively, **Di-Ammonium Phosphate** (18% N, 46% P2O5) can be applied at 40-60 kg/acre as a basal dose. This also provides some nitrogen.
*   **Foliar Application (less effective for severe deficiency, but can provide a temporary boost):**
    *   Spray **Monoammonium Phosphate** (12% N, 61% P2O5) at a concentration of 5-10 g/L of water.

### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   Yellowing and browning (scorching) of leaf margins, starting from older leaves.
*   Weak stems and lodging.
*   Poor fruit quality (misshapen, soft, poor shelf life).
*   Increased susceptibility to diseases and stress.

**Correction Methods:**

*   **Soil Application (Basal or Top Dressing):**
    *   Apply **Muriate of Potash** (Potassium Chloride, 60% K2O) at 40-60 kg/acre in 2-3 split doses.
    *   Alternatively, **Sulphate of Potash** (Potassium Sulphate, 50% K2O) can be used at 50-70 kg/acre in split doses, especially beneficial in saline soils or where sulfur is also needed.
*   **Foliar Application (for quick correction):**
    *   Spray **Potassium Nitrate** (13% N, 45% K2O) at a concentration of 5-10 g/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, **Potassium Sulphate** (50% K2O) can be sprayed at 5-10 g/L of water.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Timing:** For soil applications, ensure fertilizers are applied at appropriate growth stages. For foliar sprays, apply during cooler parts of the day to avoid leaf burn and maximize absorption.
*   **Watering:** Always ensure adequate soil moisture after applying granular fertilizers to the soil for proper dissolution and nutrient uptake by roots.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management (INM):** Supplement chemical fertilizers with organic manures like Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or vermicompost to improve soil health, microbial activity, and nutrient retention.
*   **Consultation:** For specific recommendations tailored to your farm, always consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts after obtaining a soil test report.
