As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned conditions in Cucumber cultivation in Haryana:

### Control of Scab in Cucumber

**Scab (Cucumber Scab - *Cladosporium cucumerinum*)**
This is a common fungal disease affecting cucumber, especially under cool, moist conditions. It causes sunken, olive-green spots on leaves, stems, and fruits. On fruits, these lesions can become deep, leading to malformation and reduced marketability.

**Control Measures:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Plant resistant cucumber varieties if available.
    *   Practice crop rotation with non-cucurbit crops for at least 2-3 years to reduce pathogen inoculum in the soil.
    *   Ensure good field sanitation by promptly removing and destroying infected plant debris.
    *   Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day, to minimize leaf wetness periods.
    *   Provide adequate plant spacing to improve air circulation within the canopy.

2.  **Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
    *   Apply fungicides preventively or at the first sign of symptoms, strictly following label instructions for dosage and spray interval.
    *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L of water).
    *   **Chlorothalonil** (75% WP) at 1.5-2 kg/acre (or 1.5-2 g/L of water).
    *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC) at 200 ml/acre (or 0.5 ml/L of water).
    *   **Difenoconazole** (25% EC) at 100 ml/acre (or 0.25 ml/L of water).
    *   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in the pathogen population.

### Control of Canker in Cucumber

This is not known to affect Cucumber. Canker is primarily a disease of woody plants and fruit trees, causing deep, sunken lesions on stems and branches. While some bacterial or fungal diseases can cause stem lesions on cucumber, they are not typically referred to as "canker" in the standard pathological sense for this crop.

### Control of Gummosis in Cucumber

This is not known to affect Cucumber. Gummosis is the exudation of gum from wounds or cankers, commonly observed in fruit trees (e.g., citrus, stone fruits) in response to stress, disease, or injury. While some cucurbit diseases like Gummy Stem Blight can cause a gummy exudate on stems, the term "gummosis" as a primary disease is not applicable to cucumber.

### Control of Lichen in Cucumber

This is not known to affect Cucumber. Lichens are symbiotic organisms (fungus and alga/cyanobacterium) that grow on surfaces like tree bark, rocks, or soil. They are epiphytes and are not parasitic; they do not grow on or cause disease in herbaceous plants like cucumber.
