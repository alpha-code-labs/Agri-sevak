As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following cultivation practices for Cucumber in Haryana:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   Cucumber can be direct-seeded or transplanted. Direct seeding is generally preferred.
    *   Sow seeds on ridges or raised beds to ensure good drainage and aeration, especially during monsoon or in areas with heavy soils.
    *   Plant in rows.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   Sow seeds at a depth of 2.0 to 3.0 cm.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   Maintain a row-to-row spacing of 1.5 to 2.5 meters.
    *   Maintain a plant-to-plant spacing of 0.5 to 1.0 meter.
    *   A common recommended spacing is 2.0 meters between rows and 0.6 meters between plants within a row.

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   For direct seeding, a seed dose of 2.0 to 3.0 kg per acre is generally recommended, depending on the variety and seed size.
