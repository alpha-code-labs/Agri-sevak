These organic manures are highly beneficial for Cucumber cultivation, improving soil health, nutrient availability, and plant vigour.

Here are the recommended doses:

*   **Farmyard Manure (FYM):** Apply 15-20 tonnes per acre during land preparation, at least 2-3 weeks before sowing or transplanting. Ensure the FYM is well-decomposed.
*   **Vermicompost:** Apply 4-6 tonnes per acre during land preparation, or as a top-dressing around the plants during early growth stages.
*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract):**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Mix 2-4 ml of **Sagarika** per litre of water and spray at the 2-3 leaf stage. Repeat the application at flowering and early fruit development stages.
    *   **Soil Drench/Drip Application:** Apply 1-2 litres of **Sagarika** per acre mixed with irrigation water during early vegetative growth and again at flowering.
