As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Cucumber in Haryana.

It is crucial to adopt an Integrated Disease Management (IDM) approach, combining cultural practices with judicious use of fungicides, to ensure sustainable and effective disease control.

**General Cultural Practices for Disease Management:**

*   **Resistant Varieties:** Whenever possible, choose cucumber varieties known to have resistance or tolerance to common fungal diseases prevalent in your area.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice a 2-3 year crop rotation with non-cucurbit crops to break the disease cycle and reduce inoculum build-up in the soil.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris promptly to prevent the spread of spores.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to improve air circulation within the canopy, reducing humidity and fungal growth.
*   **Irrigation Management:** Use drip irrigation or irrigate in the morning to allow foliage to dry quickly, minimizing leaf wetness periods. Avoid overhead irrigation, especially in the evening.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Maintain balanced plant nutrition to promote vigorous growth and enhance natural resistance. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can make plants more susceptible.

**Specific Fungal Diseases and Their Control in Cucumber:**

**1. Alternaria Leaf Spot (Caused by *Alternaria cucumerina*)**
Symptoms include small, circular, water-soaked spots that enlarge, become brown, and develop concentric rings (target-like spots) on leaves.

*   **Fungicides:**
    *   **Mancozeb**: 2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Chlorothalonil**: 2 g/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin**: 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Tebuconazole**: 0.75 ml/L of water.

**2. Anthracnose (Caused by *Colletotrichum orbiculare*)**
Symptoms appear as angular, water-soaked spots on leaves that turn brown to black. On fruits, sunken, circular lesions with dark margins and pinkish spore masses may develop.

*   **Fungicides:**
    *   **Mancozeb**: 2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Chlorothalonil**: 2 g/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin**: 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Tebuconazole**: 0.75 ml/L of water.

**3. Blight (Specifically Gummy Stem Blight, caused by *Didymella bryoniae*)**
This disease causes leaf spots, stem cankers (often with gummy exudates), and fruit rot. Lesions on stems can girdle the plant.

*   **Fungicides:**
    *   **Chlorothalonil**: 2 g/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin**: 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Tebuconazole**: 0.75 ml/L of water.
    *   **Difenoconazole**: 0.5 ml/L of water.

**4. Downy Mildew (Caused by *Pseudoperonospora cubensis*)**
Symptoms begin as angular, yellowish spots on the upper leaf surface, delimited by veins. A purplish-grey, fuzzy growth (spores) can be seen on the underside of the leaves, especially in humid conditions.

*   **Fungicides:**
    *   **Mancozeb**: 2.5 g/L of water (preventive).
    *   **Chlorothalonil**: 2 g/L of water (preventive).
    *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride**: 2.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Cymoxanil + Mancozeb**: 2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Fenamidone + Propamocarb hydrochloride**: 2.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Fluopicolide + Propamocarb hydrochloride**: 2.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Dimethomorph**: 1 g/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin**: 0.5 ml/L of water.

**5. Powdery Mildew (Caused by *Podosphaera xanthii* and *Erysiphe cichoracearum*)**
Characterized by white, powdery patches on the upper and lower surfaces of leaves, stems, and sometimes fruits. Infected leaves may turn yellow, brown, and eventually die.

*   **Fungicides:**
    *   **Sulphur** (Wettable Powder): 2-3 g/L of water.
    *   **Myclobutanil**: 0.4 g/L of water.
    *   **Penconazole**: 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin**: 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Difenoconazole**: 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Tebuconazole**: 0.75 ml/L of water.
    *   **Fluxapyroxad + Pyraclostrobin**: 0.5 ml/L of water.

*   **Brown spot:** This is not known to affect Cucumber as a distinct disease.
*   **Grey mildew:** This is not known to affect Cucumber.

**Important Considerations for Fungicide Application:**

*   **Rotation of Fungicides:** To prevent the development of fungicide resistance, always rotate fungicides with different Modes of Action (MoA) groups. Do not use the same fungicide or fungicides from the same MoA group repeatedly.
*   **Timing:** Apply fungicides preventively or at the very first sign of disease symptoms for best efficacy.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough spray coverage of all plant parts, especially the undersides of leaves where many fungal spores reside.
*   **Safety:** Always read and follow the instructions on the fungicide label, including dosage, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and safety precautions. Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).
