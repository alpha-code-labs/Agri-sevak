As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified recommendations for the use of growth regulators and micronutrients in Cucumber cultivation in Haryana:

It is crucial to follow recommended doses precisely, as incorrect application can lead to adverse effects on plant growth and yield. Always ensure thorough coverage of the foliage during spraying.

1.  **Ethephon**
    *   **Purpose:** To promote the production of female flowers, which leads to an increased number of fruits and higher yields, especially in monoecious and gynoecious cucumber varieties.
    *   **Recommended Dose:** 150-250 mg of **Ethephon** (active ingredient) per liter of water (0.15-0.25 g/L).
    *   **Application Timing:** The first spray should be applied when the plant has 2-4 true leaves. A second spray can be given 7-10 days after the first, if necessary, depending on the variety and desired effect.

2.  **2,4-D (2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid)**
    *   **Recommendation:** This is not known to be recommended as a growth regulator for Cucumber in Haryana. While 2,4-D is a synthetic auxin, its primary use in agriculture is as a selective herbicide. Even at very low concentrations, its application as a growth regulator for cucumber is not a standard practice and carries a significant risk of phytotoxicity and adverse effects on the crop.

3.  **Boron**
    *   **Purpose:** Boron is an essential micronutrient vital for pollen germination, pollen tube growth, cell wall formation, sugar transport, and overall fruit development. Its deficiency can lead to poor fruit set, deformed fruits, and reduced yield.
    *   **Recommended Dose:** 1-2 g of **Boric acid** (containing approximately 17% Boron) per liter of water (0.1% - 0.2% solution). Alternatively, a CIBRC-approved Boron fertilizer containing Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate (20% Boron) can be used at an equivalent dose.
    *   **Application Timing:** The first spray should be applied at the pre-flowering stage. A second spray can be given at the early fruit setting stage to ensure adequate Boron availability during critical reproductive phases.
