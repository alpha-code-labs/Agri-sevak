As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding dropping in cucumber:

Firstly, regarding "Tinda/Boll dropping":
*   This is not known to affect Cucumber. "Boll dropping" is a term typically associated with cotton, and "Tinda dropping" refers to the fruit drop in Indian round gourd (Tinda), not cucumber.

Regarding "Flower drop" and "Fruit drop" in Cucumber, these are primarily physiological issues rather than a single disease or pest. They can be caused by a combination of environmental stresses, nutritional imbalances, and poor pollination.

**Common Causes of Flower and Fruit Drop in Cucumber:**

1.  **Environmental Stress:**
    *   **Temperature Extremes:** Both very high (>35°C) and very low (<15°C) temperatures can lead to poor pollen viability, reduced fertilization, and stress-induced shedding.
    *   **Water Stress:** Inconsistent watering, including both drought (under-watering) and waterlogging (over-watering), can severely stress the plant.
    *   **Humidity:** Extremely low or high humidity can affect pollen viability and stigma receptivity.
    *   **Light Intensity:** Insufficient light can weaken the plant and reduce its capacity to support developing fruits.

2.  **Nutritional Imbalances:**
    *   **Boron Deficiency:** Boron is crucial for pollen germination, pollen tube growth, and fruit set.
    *   **Calcium Deficiency:** Calcium is essential for cell wall integrity and fruit development.
    *   **Nitrogen Excess:** Too much nitrogen can promote excessive vegetative growth at the expense of reproductive development, leading to flower drop.
    *   **Potassium Deficiency:** Potassium is vital for overall plant health and fruit development.

3.  **Poor Pollination:**
    *   Lack of natural pollinators (e.g., bees) or adverse weather conditions affecting pollinator activity.
    *   Insufficient male flowers (in non-parthenocarpic varieties).

4.  **Pest and Disease Pressure:**
    *   Severe infestations of sucking pests (aphids, thrips, whiteflies) can weaken the plant.
    *   Root diseases can impair water and nutrient uptake, leading to overall plant stress.

5.  **Genetic Factors:** Some cucumber varieties may be more prone to flower or fruit drop under certain conditions.

**Control Measures for Flower and Fruit Drop in Cucumber:**

The primary approach is to identify and mitigate the underlying causes through good agricultural practices.

1.  **Optimal Environmental Management:**
    *   **Planting Time:** Choose appropriate planting times to avoid extreme temperatures during flowering and fruiting.
    *   **Watering:** Maintain consistent soil moisture. Use drip irrigation for efficient water management, avoiding both waterlogging and drought stress.
    *   **Temperature and Humidity (Protected Cultivation):** Ensure proper ventilation and temperature control (e.g., 20-30°C) and maintain relative humidity between 60-70%.
    *   **Light:** Ensure plants receive adequate sunlight. Avoid overcrowding.

2.  **Balanced Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Soil Testing:** Conduct regular soil tests to determine nutrient status and apply fertilizers based on recommendations.
    *   **Balanced Fertilization:** Provide a balanced supply of macro and micronutrients. Avoid excessive nitrogen application, especially during the flowering stage.
    *   **Micronutrient Correction:**
        *   For Boron deficiency: Foliar spray of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** at 1-2 g/L of water.
        *   For Calcium deficiency: Foliar spray of **Calcium nitrate** at 5-10 g/L of water.

3.  **Enhance Pollination:**
    *   **Pollinator Protection:** Avoid spraying insecticides during flowering to protect natural pollinators like bees.
    *   **Bee Hives:** Introduce bee hives in the field or protected cultivation for improved pollination.
    *   **Hand Pollination:** In small-scale cultivation or protected environments, hand pollination can be done for varieties requiring it.

4.  **Integrated Pest and Disease Management (IPM):**
    *   Regularly scout for pests and diseases.
    *   Implement timely and appropriate control measures using CIBRC approved pesticides/fungicides only when necessary, to keep plants healthy and reduce stress.

By addressing these factors, you can significantly reduce flower and fruit drop in cucumber and ensure a healthy yield.
