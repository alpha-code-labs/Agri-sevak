As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach for controlling sucking pests in Cucumber, focusing on prevention, monitoring, and judicious use of chemicals.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Sucking Pests in Cucumber:**

**1. Cultural Control Measures:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Regularly remove weeds from and around the cucumber field, as they can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting cucurbits continuously in the same field. Rotate with non-host crops to break the pest cycle.
*   **Yellow Sticky Traps:** Install yellow sticky traps (15-20 traps per acre) at canopy height for monitoring and mass trapping of adult whiteflies, aphids, and leafhoppers.
*   **Reflective Mulches:** Use silver-colored reflective mulches (e.g., silver-black plastic mulch) around the plants, especially in the early stages, to deter whiteflies and aphids.
*   **Proper Spacing and Nutrition:** Maintain optimal plant spacing and provide balanced nutrition to ensure vigorous plant growth, which can better withstand pest damage.
*   **Water Management:** Avoid water stress, as stressed plants are more susceptible to pest attacks.

**2. Biological Control Measures:**
*   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Protect and encourage natural predators like ladybird beetles, lacewings, syrphid fly larvae, and parasitic wasps, which feed on aphids, whiteflies, and other soft-bodied insects. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.
*   **Biopesticides:** In cases of low to moderate infestation, consider using neem-based formulations or entomopathogenic fungi like *Beauveria bassiana* or *Verticillium lecanii* (as per label recommendations) for whiteflies and aphids.

**3. Chemical Control Measures (when pest incidence is high and other methods are insufficient):**
Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Apply sprays during the cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening). Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage, especially the undersides of leaves where many sucking pests reside.

For Aphids, Leafhopper, Whitefly, and Thrips:

*   **For early infestation/low to moderate pest pressure:**
    *   **Azadirachtin 1500 ppm EC:** 5 ml/L of water (or 1000-1250 ml/acre).
    *   **Azadirachtin 3000 ppm EC:** 3 ml/L of water (or 600-750 ml/acre).
    *   *Note: Neem-based formulations are effective as repellents and growth disruptors, especially in early stages.*

*   **For moderate to high pest pressure:**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** 0.5 ml/L of water (or 100-125 ml/acre).
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** 0.2 g/L of water (or 40-50 g/acre).
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** 0.2 g/L of water (or 40-50 g/acre).
    *   **Diafenthiuron 50% WP:** 1.2-1.5 g/L of water (or 240-300 g/acre). *Effective against whiteflies, thrips, and also mites.*
    *   **Flonicamid 50% WG:** 0.3 g/L of water (or 60-75 g/acre). *Primarily effective against aphids and whiteflies.*
    *   **Dinotefuran 20% SG:** 0.3 g/L of water (or 60-75 g/acre).

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the insecticide label for specific dosages, pre-harvest intervals (PHI), and safety precautions.
*   Ensure proper spray volume to achieve good coverage. A typical spray volume for cucumber is 200-250 litres of water per acre, depending on plant size.

**Regarding Psylla:**
This is not known to affect Cucumber. Psyllids are generally host-specific and are not considered a significant pest of cucumber in Haryana or elsewhere.
