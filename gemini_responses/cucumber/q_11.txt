As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling beetles, weevils, and sawflies in cucumber cultivation in Haryana:

### Control of Beetles in Cucumber

Beetles, particularly cucumber beetles (striped and spotted) and flea beetles, are common and significant pests of cucumber in Haryana. They cause damage by feeding on leaves, stems, flowers, and fruits, leading to defoliation, scarring, and reduced yield. They can also transmit diseases like bacterial wilt.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Beetles:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting cucurbits in the same field consecutively.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove crop residues and weeds that can harbor pests.
    *   **Timely Planting:** Plant early to avoid peak pest populations.
    *   **Mulching:** Use reflective mulches to deter beetles.

2.  **Chemical Control:**
    When beetle populations are high and causing economic damage, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always follow label instructions, safety precautions, and pre-harvest intervals (PHI). Alternate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

    *   **For sucking and chewing beetles (e.g., cucumber beetles):**
        *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at a rate of 0.5 ml per litre of water (or 100-125 ml per acre in 200-250 litres of water).
        *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at a rate of 0.25 g per litre of water (or 50-80 g per acre in 200-250 litres of water).
        *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply at a rate of 0.25 g per litre of water (or 50-60 g per acre in 200-250 litres of water).

    *   **For chewing beetles (e.g., flea beetles, cucumber beetles):**
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** Apply at a rate of 0.5 ml per litre of water (or 100-150 ml per acre in 200-250 litres of water).
        *   **Fipronil 5% SC:** Apply at a rate of 1.0-1.5 ml per litre of water (or 200-300 ml per acre in 200-250 litres of water).

    Ensure thorough coverage of the plant foliage during spraying.

### Control of Weevils in Cucumber

Weevils are generally **not known to be significant primary pests of cucumber** in Haryana. While some polyphagous weevils might occasionally feed on cucurbits, they rarely cause economic damage that warrants specific control measures. If observed, the broad-spectrum insecticides recommended for beetles (e.g., **Lambda-cyhalothrin**, **Fipronil**) would likely provide incidental control.

### Control of Sawflies in Cucumber

This is not known to affect Cucumber. Sawflies are not recognized as pests of cucumber.

For specific field conditions and further guidance, farmers are advised to consult with local agricultural extension specialists or experts at Haryana Agricultural University.
