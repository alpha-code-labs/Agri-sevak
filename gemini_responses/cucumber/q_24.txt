As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following for ideal cucumber transplantation in Haryana:

### Ideal Transplantation Time

Cucumber is a warm-season crop and can be grown in different seasons in Haryana, depending on the variety and cultivation method.

*   **Spring-Summer Crop (Open Field):**
    *   **Transplantation:** Mid-February to Mid-March. This allows the crop to establish before the peak summer heat and mature before the monsoon.
*   **Rainy Season Crop (Open Field):**
    *   **Transplantation:** Mid-June to Mid-July. Ensure good drainage and select varieties tolerant to humidity.
*   **Autumn-Winter Crop (Protected Cultivation - Polyhouse/Net house):**
    *   **Transplantation:** September to October. This allows for cultivation during cooler months under protected conditions, extending the growing season.

### Ideal Transplantation Distance

The spacing depends on the cultivation method (ground vs. trellised) and variety.

*   **Open Field (Ground Cultivation):**
    *   **Row to Row:** 1.5 - 2.0 meters
    *   **Plant to Plant:** 0.5 - 0.75 meters
*   **Open Field (Trellised/Staked Cultivation):**
    *   **Row to Row:** 1.2 - 1.5 meters
    *   **Plant to Plant:** 0.4 - 0.6 meters
*   **Protected Cultivation (Polyhouse/Net house - Trellised):**
    *   **Single Row System:**
        *   **Row to Row:** 0.8 - 1.0 meter
        *   **Plant to Plant:** 0.4 - 0.5 meter
    *   **Double Row System (Paired Rows):**
        *   **Between Paired Rows:** 0.6 - 0.75 meter
        *   **Between Sets of Paired Rows:** 1.2 - 1.5 meters
        *   **Plant to Plant (within a row):** 0.4 - 0.5 meter

### Ideal Transplantation Process

A meticulous approach to transplantation minimizes shock and ensures healthy plant establishment.

1.  **Seedling Preparation:**
    *   Sow cucumber seeds in nursery trays or raised beds filled with a well-drained, sterile potting mix (e.g., cocopeat + vermicompost + perlite) 3-4 weeks before the intended transplant date.
    *   Ensure adequate moisture and protection from extreme weather during the nursery stage. Seedlings should have 2-3 true leaves and be about 10-15 cm tall at transplanting.
2.  **Hardening Off:**
    *   About 7-10 days before transplanting, gradually expose the seedlings to outdoor conditions (reduced watering, increased sunlight, wind) to acclimatize them to the field environment. This process, known as hardening off, significantly reduces transplant shock.
3.  **Field Preparation:**
    *   Prepare the main field thoroughly by deep ploughing and harrowing to achieve a fine, loose tilth.
    *   Incorporate 20-25 tonnes per acre of well-rotted Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost during land preparation.
    *   Form raised beds or furrows according to the chosen spacing. Raised beds are particularly beneficial for rainy season cultivation to prevent waterlogging.
    *   Pre-irrigate the beds/furrows 1-2 days before transplanting to ensure adequate soil moisture.
4.  **Transplanting:**
    *   Choose a cool part of the day, preferably late afternoon or evening, to minimize heat stress on the seedlings.
    *   Carefully remove seedlings from the nursery trays/beds, ensuring the root ball remains intact to avoid root damage.
    *   Dig a hole slightly larger than the root ball at the desired spacing.
    *   Place the seedling in the hole, ensuring the top of the root ball is level with the soil surface. Avoid planting too deep or too shallow.
    *   Gently firm the soil around the base of the plant to remove air pockets.
5.  **Post-Transplant Care:**
    *   Immediately irrigate the transplanted seedlings to settle the soil around the roots and provide initial moisture.
    *   Monitor the plants closely for the first few days for signs of wilting or stress.
    *   Provide light shade if temperatures are exceptionally high during the initial establishment phase.
    *   Avoid disturbing the roots during subsequent cultural operations.
