As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling these pests in Cucumber in Haryana:

Regarding **Ber fly**:
This is not known to affect Cucumber. The Ber fly (*Carpomyia vesuviana*) is a specific pest of Ber (*Ziziphus mauritiana*).

Regarding **Fruit fly** (*Bactrocera cucurbitae* - Melon Fruit Fly) in Cucumber:
The melon fruit fly is a major pest of cucurbit crops, including cucumber, causing significant damage by laying eggs in young fruits, leading to rotting and premature fruit drop. An integrated approach is recommended for effective control.

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Regularly collect and destroy all infested, fallen, and damaged fruits by burying them deep in the soil or burning them. This prevents the completion of the life cycle.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** After harvest, deep ploughing helps expose pupae in the soil to predators and adverse weather conditions.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid continuous cultivation of cucurbit crops in the same field to break the pest cycle.
*   **Early Harvesting:** Harvest fruits at an immature stage to avoid egg-laying by the fruit fly.

**2. Mechanical Methods:**
*   **Pheromone Traps:** Install **Methyl Eugenol** based pheromone traps at a density of 4-5 traps per acre. These traps attract and kill male fruit flies, reducing the breeding population. Replace the lures every 2-3 weeks.
*   **Bagging:** For small-scale cultivation, individual fruits can be covered with paper or cloth bags to prevent egg-laying.

**3. Chemical Control (Use only when infestation is severe and other methods are insufficient):**
*   **Poison Bait Spray:**
    *   Prepare a bait by mixing 100 g of jaggery or molasses with 10 ml of **Malathion 50% EC** in 1 litre of water.
    *   Apply this bait in small drops on leaves (not directly on fruits) at 10-15 spots per acre, preferably in the evening. This attracts and kills adult fruit flies.
*   **Foliar Sprays (if infestation is high):**
    *   **Malathion 50% EC:** 2 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Dimethoate 30% EC:** 2 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Spinosad 45% SC:** 0.16 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Deltamethrin 2.8% EC:** 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Cypermethrin 25% EC:** 0.4 ml per litre of water.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully.
*   Observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) for any chemical applied to ensure fruit safety.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Rotate different classes of insecticides to prevent the development of resistance.
