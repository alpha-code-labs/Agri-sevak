As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling various rot types in Cucumber, keeping in mind the conditions in Haryana and using CIBRC approved chemicals.

Many "rot" types are symptoms caused by a range of fungal or oomycete pathogens, often soil-borne. Effective control involves an integrated approach combining cultural practices and judicious use of fungicides.

### General Cultural and Preventive Measures (Applicable to most rot types):

1.  **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting cucumbers or other cucurbits in the same field for at least 2-3 years to reduce pathogen build-up in the soil.
2.  **Soil Preparation:** Ensure good soil drainage. Raised beds can be beneficial in areas prone to waterlogging.
3.  **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris promptly. Clean tools and equipment to prevent pathogen spread.
4.  **Seed Selection:** Use certified, disease-free seeds.
5.  **Planting Density:** Maintain adequate spacing between plants to ensure good air circulation, which reduces humidity and fungal growth.
6.  **Irrigation Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day. Drip irrigation is preferred to keep foliage dry and prevent splashing of soil-borne pathogens. Avoid overwatering.
7.  **Mulching:** Use organic mulches (e.g., straw) to prevent direct contact of fruits and lower stems with the soil, reducing infection risk.
8.  **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced fertilizers. Excessive nitrogen can lead to lush growth, making plants more susceptible.

### Specific Rot Types and Their Control:

Many of the listed rot types (Root, Stem, Foot, Collar, Crown, Neck, Seed, Seedling rot) are often caused by a group of common soil-borne pathogens like *Pythium spp.*, *Phytophthora spp.*, *Rhizoctonia solani*, and *Fusarium spp.* Black Rot is typically caused by *Didymella bryoniae* (Gummy Stem Blight), and Fruit Rot can be caused by several pathogens.

#### 1. Damping-Off, Seed Rot, Seedling Rot, Root Rot, Stem Rot, Foot Rot, Collar Rot, Crown Rot, Neck Rot (Primarily caused by *Pythium*, *Phytophthora*, *Rhizoctonia*, *Fusarium*)

These rots manifest as poor seed germination, pre- or post-emergence seedling death (damping-off), reddish-brown lesions on roots and lower stems, wilting, and eventual collapse of the plant.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Seed Treatment:**
    *   **Thiram** 75% WS @ 2-3 g/kg seed
    *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP @ 2 g/kg seed
    *   **Metalaxyl-M** 31.8% ES @ 3 ml/kg seed (effective against *Pythium* and *Phytophthora*)
    *   **Tebuconazole** 2% DS @ 2 g/kg seed
    *   **Trichoderma viride** 1% WP @ 4-5 g/kg seed (bio-fungicide, apply just before sowing)

*   **Soil Drench / Application (Nursery or Field):**
    *   **Propamocarb Hydrochloride** 72.2% SL @ 2-3 ml/L water (drench around the base of plants, especially for *Pythium* and *Phytophthora*)
    *   **Metalaxyl-M** 31.8% ES @ 2-3 ml/L water (drench)
    *   **Copper Oxychloride** 50% WP @ 2-3 g/L water (drench)
    *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP @ 1-2 g/L water (drench)
    *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP @ 2-2.5 g/L water (drench)
    *   **Trichoderma viride** 1% WP @ 2.5 kg/acre mixed with 50-100 kg of Farm Yard Manure (FYM) and applied to the soil before planting, or as a drench @ 5 g/L water.

#### 2. Black Rot / Gummy Stem Blight (Caused by *Didymella bryoniae* / *Stagonosporopsis cucurbitacearum*)

This disease causes water-soaked lesions on leaves, stems (often with a characteristic gummy exudate), tendrils, and fruit. Stem lesions can girdle the stem, leading to wilting and collapse (stem rot, neck rot). Fruit rot appears as dark, sunken lesions.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Foliar Spray (can also help manage stem and neck rot symptoms):**
    *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC @ 0.5-1 ml/L water
    *   **Tebuconazole** 25% WG @ 0.75-1 g/L water
    *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP @ 2-2.5 g/L water
    *   **Chlorothalonil** 75% WP @ 1.5-2 g/L water
    *   **Carbendazim** 12% + **Mancozeb** 63% WP @ 2 g/L water

#### 3. Fruit Rot (General, including *Pythium*, *Phytophthora*, *Didymella*, *Sclerotinia*)

Fruit rot can be caused by various pathogens, leading to water-soaked lesions on the fruit that rapidly expand, causing soft decay, often with visible fungal growth.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural:**
    *   Ensure fruits do not come into direct contact with the soil by using mulches or supporting plants.
    *   Harvest fruits promptly.
*   **Chemical (often overlaps with foliar sprays for other diseases):**
    *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC @ 0.5-1 ml/L water
    *   **Propamocarb Hydrochloride** 72.2% SL @ 2-3 ml/L water (if *Pythium* or *Phytophthora* are suspected)
    *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP @ 2-2.5 g/L water
    *   **Copper Oxychloride** 50% WP @ 2-3 g/L water

#### 4. White Mold / Sclerotinia Rot (Caused by *Sclerotinia sclerotiorum*)

This rot appears as water-soaked lesions on stems, leaves, and fruits, often at the soil line or in dense canopy areas. It is characterized by white, cottony fungal growth, eventually forming hard, black, seed-like structures called sclerotia.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural:**
    *   Ensure good air circulation by proper plant spacing and pruning.
    *   Remove and destroy infected plant debris and sclerotia from the field.
*   **Chemical:**
    *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP @ 1-2 g/L water (foliar spray or drench)
    *   **Tebuconazole** 25% WG @ 0.75-1 g/L water (foliar spray)
    *   **Boscalid** 50% WG @ 0.75-1 g/L water (foliar spray)

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the label instructions for any chemical product regarding dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest intervals (PHI).
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in pathogens.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension services or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and current disease pressure.
