As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling termites and root-knot nematodes in cucumber cultivation in Haryana. Both these soil pests can cause significant damage if not managed effectively.

### Control of Termites (Odontotermes obesus, Microtermes obesi) in Cucumber

Termites can cause severe damage by feeding on the roots and stem base, leading to wilting, poor plant growth, and ultimately plant death.

**1. Cultural and Preventive Measures:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove all crop residues, stubble, and woody debris from the field before planting, as these can serve as food sources for termites.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** Ploughing the field deeply during summer can expose termite colonies to sunlight and predators, disrupting their activity.
*   **Proper Irrigation:** Maintain adequate soil moisture, as termites generally prefer drier conditions. However, avoid waterlogging.

**2. Chemical Control (Pre-planting/At-planting):**
For effective control, soil treatment is crucial before or at the time of planting.

*   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC:**
    *   **Dosage:** 2.5 Litres per acre.
    *   **Application:** Mix the recommended quantity with 200-400 Litres of water and apply as a soil drench in the planting rows or broadcast evenly over the field before final land preparation. Incorporate into the soil immediately.
*   **Fipronil 0.3% GR:**
    *   **Dosage:** 10-15 kg per acre.
    *   **Application:** Broadcast evenly over the field and incorporate into the soil to a depth of 10-15 cm before planting.

### Control of Nematodes (Root-knot Nematodes - Meloidogyne spp.) in Cucumber

Root-knot nematodes are microscopic worms that infect plant roots, causing characteristic galls or knots. This impairs water and nutrient uptake, leading to stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, wilting, and reduced yield.

**1. Cultural and Preventive Measures:**
*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate cucumber with non-host crops like cereals (wheat, maize, sorghum) for at least 2-3 years. Avoid continuous cultivation of susceptible crops like tomato, brinjal, okra, and gourds.
*   **Summer Solarization:** During the hot summer months (May-June), plough the field, irrigate it, and then cover the moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets (100-150 micron thickness) for 4-6 weeks. The high temperatures generated under the plastic can kill nematodes.
*   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or neem cake (200-400 kg per acre) into the soil. Neem cake has nematicidal properties and improves soil health.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** If available and suitable for your region, consider planting cucumber varieties known to have resistance or tolerance to root-knot nematodes.

**2. Chemical Control (Pre-planting/At-planting):**
Chemical nematicides can be used for effective control, especially in heavily infested fields.

*   **Fluensulfone 2% GR:**
    *   **Dosage:** 10-15 kg per acre.
    *   **Application:** Apply uniformly in the soil at the time of planting or transplanting and incorporate it into the soil.
*   **Ethoprophos 10% GR:**
    *   **Dosage:** 10-15 kg per acre.
    *   **Application:** Apply uniformly in the soil at the time of planting or transplanting and incorporate it into the soil.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label carefully, including safety precautions and pre-harvest intervals.
*   Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during chemical application.
*   Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods, is recommended for sustainable and effective pest control.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions.
