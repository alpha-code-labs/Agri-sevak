As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for weed control in cucumber in Haryana:

First, regarding **Orobanche**:
This is not known to affect Cucumber. Orobanche (Broomrape) is a parasitic weed primarily affecting solanaceous crops (like tomato, brinjal, potato) and some legumes, but not cucurbits like cucumber.

For the control of other specified weeds (Broadleaf, Narrowleaf, Amarbail, Bathu, Congress grass, and Phalaris minor) in Cucumber, an integrated approach combining cultural, mechanical, and judicious chemical methods is recommended. Cucumber is sensitive to many herbicides, so careful application is crucial.

**1. Pre-Emergence Weed Control (for Broadleaf, Narrowleaf, Bathu, Congress grass, Phalaris minor, and partial suppression of Amarbail):**

*   **Pendimethalin** (30% EC): Apply 3.3 - 5.0 Litres per acre, mixed in 200-250 Litres of water, as a pre-emergence spray within 1-3 days after sowing of seeds or transplanting of seedlings. Ensure good soil moisture for optimal efficacy. This herbicide provides control of germinating annual broadleaf and narrowleaf weeds.

**2. Post-Emergence Weed Control:**

*   **For Narrowleaf Weeds (Grasses like Phalaris minor):**
    *   **Quizalofop-ethyl** (12.5% EC): Apply 400 ml per acre, mixed in 200-250 Litres of water, when grassy weeds are at the 2-4 leaf stage. This is a selective graminicide and is safe for cucumber.
    *   Alternatively, **Fenoxaprop-p-ethyl** (10% EC): Apply 250 ml per acre, mixed in 200-250 Litres of water, when grassy weeds are at the 2-4 leaf stage.
    *   Ensure thorough coverage of the weeds.

*   **For Broadleaf Weeds (like Bathu, Congress grass):**
    *   Chemical options for post-emergence broadleaf weed control in cucumber are very limited and carry a high risk of crop injury. Therefore, **manual weeding** is the most recommended and safest method for controlling broadleaf weeds in cucumber. Perform weeding when weeds are young, typically 20-25 days after sowing/transplanting, and repeat as necessary.

*   **For Amarbail (Cuscuta spp.):**
    *   **Prevention is key:** Use clean, certified seeds free from Amarbail seeds.
    *   **Manual Removal:** If Amarbail infestation is observed, immediately remove the affected cucumber plants along with the parasitic weed before it sets seeds. This is crucial to prevent its spread.
    *   **Pendimethalin** (as mentioned in pre-emergence) can offer some suppression of germinating Amarbail seeds, but it is not fully effective against established infestations.

**3. Cultural and Mechanical Methods (Essential for Integrated Weed Management):**

*   **Hand Weeding and Hoeing:** This remains the most effective method for controlling a wide spectrum of weeds, especially broadleaf weeds and Amarbail, in cucumber. Perform 1-2 hand weedings, depending on weed pressure, during the early growth stages of the crop.
*   **Mulching:** Using organic mulches (straw, dry leaves) or plastic mulches can significantly suppress weed growth by blocking sunlight and reducing germination.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate cucumber with non-host crops or crops that allow for different weed control strategies to break the weed cycle.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Keep field bunds and surrounding areas free of weeds to prevent seed dispersal into the cucumber field.
*   **Clean Equipment:** Ensure farm machinery is clean before entering the field to avoid introducing weed seeds.

Always read and follow the label instructions of any chemical product before use. For specific local recommendations or if you observe unusual weed infestations, please consult with the agricultural extension specialists at HAU, Hisar.
