As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following for ideal Beet Root transplantation in Haryana:

### Ideal Transplantation Time, Distance, and Process for Beet Root

**1. Ideal Transplantation Time:**
Beet Root is a cool-season crop. For optimal growth and yield in Haryana, transplanting should be done during the cooler months.
*   **Main Season:** October to November.
    *   *Nursery Sowing:* Seeds should be sown in a nursery bed or trays 3-4 weeks prior to the intended transplanting date (i.e., September to early October).

**2. Ideal Transplantation Distance:**
Proper spacing is crucial for root development, air circulation, and ease of cultural operations.
*   **Row to Row:** 30 cm to 45 cm
*   **Plant to Plant:** 10 cm to 15 cm

**3. Ideal Transplantation Process:**
A well-executed transplantation process minimizes shock and ensures good establishment of seedlings.

*   **Nursery Preparation and Seedling Raising:**
    *   Prepare a raised nursery bed or use seedling trays with a well-drained, fertile potting mix.
    *   Sow seeds thinly at a depth of 1-2 cm.
    *   Keep the nursery bed consistently moist.
    *   Seedlings are ready for transplanting when they are 3-4 weeks old and have developed 4-6 true leaves.

*   **Field Preparation:**
    *   Prepare the main field to a fine tilth by ploughing and harrowing.
    *   Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost (20-25 tonnes/acre) during land preparation.
    *   Ensure the field has good drainage.
    *   Form ridges and furrows or prepare flat beds as per your irrigation method.

*   **Hardening of Seedlings:**
    *   About 5-7 days before transplanting, gradually expose the seedlings to outdoor conditions (reduced watering, increased sunlight) to acclimatize them to the harsher field environment. This reduces transplant shock.

*   **Transplanting Procedure:**
    *   Water the nursery bed thoroughly a few hours before uprooting the seedlings to ensure the root ball remains intact and to minimize damage.
    *   Transplant seedlings preferably in the late afternoon or on a cloudy day to avoid direct sun exposure and heat stress.
    *   Make holes in the prepared field at the recommended spacing (30-45 cm between rows, 10-15 cm between plants).
    *   Carefully lift seedlings, ideally with a small ball of earth around their roots.
    *   Place each seedling in a hole, ensuring it is set at the same depth as it was in the nursery. Avoid burying the crown.
    *   Gently firm the soil around the base of each seedling to ensure good root-to-soil contact.

*   **Post-Transplantation Care:**
    *   Immediately irrigate the field after transplanting to settle the soil around the roots and provide essential moisture.
    *   Monitor the transplanted seedlings for wilting or stress and provide light irrigation as needed during the initial establishment phase.
