Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I advise you on addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium) in Beet Root cultivation in Haryana.

The most crucial first step is always a **soil test**. This provides precise information on the nutrient status of your specific field, allowing for tailored and efficient fertilizer application, preventing both deficiencies and over-application.

Here's how to address common macro-nutrient deficiencies:

### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** General yellowing of older leaves, stunted growth, pale green foliage, reduced leaf size.

**Correction:**
*   **Basal Application:** Apply at the time of sowing/transplanting.
    *   **Urea:** 40-60 kg/acre (as part of the total N requirement, often split).
*   **Top Dressing:** Apply 20-30 days after sowing/transplanting, and again if needed.
    *   **Urea:** 30-40 kg/acre.
*   **Foliar Spray (for quick recovery):**
    *   **Urea:** 10-20 g/L of water (1-2% solution). Spray during cooler parts of the day.

### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Purplish discoloration of older leaves, stunted growth, poor root development, delayed maturity.

**Correction:**
*   **Basal Application:** Phosphorus is less mobile in the soil, so it's best applied at or before sowing/transplanting and incorporated into the soil.
    *   **Single Superphosphate (SSP):** 250-375 kg/acre (to supply 40-60 kg P2O5/acre).
    *   **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP):** 85-130 kg/acre (to supply 40-60 kg P2O5/acre).

### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Yellowing and browning (scorching) of leaf margins, especially on older leaves; weak stems; poor root development; increased susceptibility to diseases.

**Correction:**
*   **Basal Application:** Apply at or before sowing/transplanting.
    *   **Muriate of Potash (Potassium Chloride):** 100-135 kg/acre (to supply 60-80 kg K2O/acre).
    *   **Sulphate of Potash (Potassium Sulphate):** 120-160 kg/acre (to supply 60-80 kg K2O/acre).

**General Recommendations:**
*   **Soil Testing is Paramount:** Always conduct a soil test every 2-3 years to get precise recommendations for your specific field conditions.
*   **Balanced Fertilization:** Ensure a balanced application of all macro and micro-nutrients based on soil test results to achieve optimal yield and quality.
*   **Application Method:** For basal application, broadcast and incorporate fertilizers into the soil. For top dressing, apply near the plant rows and lightly incorporate, followed by irrigation.
*   **Irrigation:** Adequate moisture is essential for nutrient uptake by plants.

Please remember that these are general guidelines. A specific recommendation can only be given after analyzing your soil test report.
