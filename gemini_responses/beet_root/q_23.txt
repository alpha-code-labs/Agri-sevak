Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified seed and soil treatment processes for Beet Root cultivation in Haryana to ensure healthy plant establishment and robust growth.

### Recommended Seed Treatment Process for Beet Root:

Seed treatment is crucial for protecting young seedlings from early-season diseases and pests, ensuring better germination and stand establishment.

1.  **Fungal Disease Protection (Damping-off, Seedling Blight, Root Rot):**
    *   **Option 1 (Broad-spectrum contact fungicide):** Treat seeds with **Thiram** @ 2.5 grams per kilogram of seed.
    *   **Option 2 (Systemic fungicide for internal and external pathogens):** Treat seeds with **Carbendazim** @ 1 gram per kilogram of seed.
    *   **Option 3 (For *Pythium* and *Phytophthora* related damping-off):** Treat seeds with **Metalaxyl** @ 4 grams per kilogram of seed.
    *   *Method:* Mix the fungicide thoroughly with the seeds in a suitable container or seed treating drum until each seed is uniformly coated.

2.  **Insect Pest Protection (Early Sucking Pests):**
    *   **Option 1 (Systemic insecticide):** Treat seeds with **Imidacloprid** (48% FS formulation) @ 7 milliliters per kilogram of seed.
    *   **Option 2 (Systemic insecticide):** Treat seeds with **Thiamethoxam** (70% WS formulation) @ 4 grams per kilogram of seed.
    *   *Method:* Apply the insecticide after the fungicide treatment (if both are used) and ensure uniform coating.

3.  **Bio-fertilizer Application (Nutrient Mobilization):**
    *   Treat seeds with **Azotobacter** and **PSB (Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria)** @ 10-20 grams each per kilogram of seed.
    *   *Method:* Prepare a slurry of the bio-fertilizers with a small amount of water. Mix the seeds with this slurry gently to ensure uniform coating. Allow the seeds to air dry in shade before sowing. This step should be done just before sowing, preferably after chemical treatments.

### Recommended Soil Treatment Process for Beet Root:

Soil treatment aims to manage soil-borne diseases, pests, and improve soil fertility, providing a conducive environment for root development.

1.  **Fungal Disease Management (Damping-off, Root Rot, Sclerotinia Rot):**
    *   **Biological Control:** Incorporate **Trichoderma viride** @ 2.5 kilograms per acre into the soil. Mix it thoroughly with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost and broadcast evenly, then incorporate into the soil 7-10 days before sowing.
    *   **Chemical Control (if severe disease history):** Apply **Carbendazim** @ 500 grams per acre as a soil drench or mix with sand and broadcast before sowing, followed by light irrigation.

2.  **Nematode Management (Root-knot Nematodes):**
    *   **Biological Control:** Incorporate **Paecilomyces lilacinus** @ 2.5 kilograms per acre into the soil. Mix it with 50-100 kg of FYM/compost and incorporate into the soil before sowing.
    *   **Chemical Control (if severe infestation):**
        *   **Option 1:** Apply **Fluensulfone** (480 SC) @ 1-2 liters per acre as a pre-plant soil incorporation or post-plant drench.
        *   **Option 2 (Use with caution and as per local recommendations):** Apply **Carbofuran** (3% G) @ 10-12 kilograms per acre at the time of sowing or transplanting.

3.  **Soil-borne Insect Pest Management (Cutworms, Grubs, Termites):**
    *   **Option 1:** Apply **Chlorpyrifos** (20% EC) @ 2 liters per acre. Mix it with irrigation water or sand and broadcast evenly before sowing, followed by light irrigation.
    *   **Option 2:** Apply **Fipronil** (0.3% GR) @ 5 kilograms per acre. Broadcast and incorporate into the soil before sowing.

4.  **Bio-fertilizer Application (Soil Health and Nutrient Availability):**
    *   Incorporate **Azotobacter**, **PSB (Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria)**, and **KMB (Potash Mobilizing Bacteria)** @ 2.5 kilograms each per acre into the soil. Mix these bio-fertilizers with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed FYM/compost and broadcast evenly, then incorporate into the soil before sowing.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions when handling any chemical.
*   Ensure proper soil moisture for effective action of both chemical and biological treatments.
*   An integrated pest and disease management approach, combining cultural practices, biological methods, and judicious use of chemicals, is always recommended for sustainable agriculture.
*   Consult your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and pest/disease history.
