Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU), Hisar, I can confirm that Wilt, including Fusarium wilt, is a known and significant disease affecting Beet Root (Chukandar) cultivation in Haryana. This condition is primarily caused by soil-borne fungal pathogens such as *Fusarium oxysporum* f. sp. *betae* and *Rhizoctonia solani*. These pathogens infect the roots, leading to blockages in the water-conducting tissues, resulting in wilting, yellowing of leaves, stunted growth, and eventually plant death. "Parawilt" in a general sense refers to sudden wilting, which can be pathogen-induced or due to other stress factors. Our focus will be on managing the primary pathogen-induced wilts.

Effective control of wilt in Beet Root requires an integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods.

**Integrated Management Strategies:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting Beet Root or other susceptible crops (like spinach, sugar beet) in the same field for at least 2-3 years. Rotate with non-host crops such as cereals (wheat, maize) or legumes.
    *   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available, select Beet Root varieties known for their resistance or tolerance to wilt diseases.
    *   **Soil Health and Drainage:** Ensure good soil drainage to prevent waterlogging, which favors fungal growth. Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost to improve soil structure and microbial activity.
    *   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris immediately to reduce the inoculum in the soil. Clean farm tools and equipment thoroughly after use in infected fields.
    *   **Optimum Nutrition:** Provide balanced fertilization. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can make plants more susceptible.
    *   **Timely Sowing:** Sow seeds at the recommended time to avoid periods of high disease pressure.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   **Bio-fungicides:** Application of beneficial microorganisms can suppress soil-borne pathogens.

3.  **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Seed Treatment:** Treating seeds before sowing is crucial for protecting young seedlings from early infection.
        *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: 2-3 g per kg of seed.
        *   **Thiophenate Methyl** 70% WP: 2-3 g per kg of seed.
        *   **Trichoderma viride** 1% WP (or 2% WP): 4-5 g per kg of seed.

    *   **Soil Application / Drenching (for standing crop or before planting in infested soil):**
        *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: 1-2 g per litre of water. Drench around the root zone of affected plants (approx. 200-250 ml solution per plant).
        *   **Thiophenate Methyl** 70% WP: 1-1.5 g per litre of water. Drench around the root zone.
        *   **Copper Oxychloride** 50% WP: 2-3 g per litre of water. Drench around the root zone.
        *   **Propiconazole** 25% EC: 1 ml per litre of water. Drench around the root zone.
        *   **Trichoderma viride** 1% WP (or 2% WP): 5 kg per acre mixed with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost. Apply to the soil before planting or as a drench (5-10 g per litre of water).
        *   **Pseudomonas fluorescens** 1% WP: 5 kg per acre mixed with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed FYM or compost. Apply to the soil before planting or as a drench (5-10 g per litre of water).

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label for safe and effective use.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) while handling chemicals.
*   For severe infestations, a combination of biological and chemical methods may be necessary.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions.

By adopting these scientifically verified practices, you can effectively manage wilt diseases in your Beet Root crop and ensure a healthy harvest.
