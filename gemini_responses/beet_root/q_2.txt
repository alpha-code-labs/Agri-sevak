Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice regarding rust diseases in Beet Root.

It is important to clarify that while the term "rust" is used broadly, specific rust pathogens affect specific crops.

1.  **Black Rust (Stem Rust):** This is primarily caused by *Puccinia graminis* and affects cereal crops like wheat. **This is not known to affect Beet Root.**
2.  **Brown Rust (Leaf Rust):** This is primarily caused by *Puccinia recondita* (wheat) or *Puccinia hordei* (barley) and affects cereal crops. **This is not known to affect Beet Root.**
3.  **Yellow Rust (Stripe Rust):** This is primarily caused by *Puccinia striiformis* and affects cereal crops like wheat and barley. **This is not known to affect Beet Root.**
4.  **White Rust:** This is caused by *Albugo* species, which are oomycetes (water molds), not true rust fungi, and primarily affect cruciferous vegetables (e.g., mustard, radish). **This is not known to affect Beet Root.**
5.  **Red Rust:** This term can sometimes be used generally. The primary true rust disease affecting Beet Root (and other *Beta vulgaris* crops like sugar beet) is **Beet Rust**, caused by *Uromyces betae*. The pustules of this rust are typically orange-brown to reddish-brown.

Therefore, we will focus on the control of **Beet Rust (*Uromyces betae*)** in Beet Root.

### Control Measures for Beet Rust (*Uromyces betae*) in Beet Root:

**A. Cultural Practices:**

*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice a rotation with non-host crops for at least 2-3 years to reduce inoculum in the soil from infected plant debris.
*   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest to prevent the carry-over of fungal spores.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** If available and suitable for your region in Haryana, choose beet varieties known to have resistance or tolerance to rust.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to improve air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce leaf wetness and humidity, conditions favorable for rust development.
*   **Balanced Fertilization:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush, susceptible growth. Maintain a balanced nutrient supply.

**B. Chemical Control (Fungicides):**

Fungicides should be applied preventively or at the very early stages of disease development for best results. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions for dosage, application method, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).

*   **Difenoconazole**
    *   Dosage: 0.5 ml per litre of water (or 100-150 ml per acre, depending on spray volume).
*   **Propiconazole**
    *   Dosage: 1 ml per litre of water (or 200-250 ml per acre, depending on spray volume).
*   **Tebuconazole**
    *   Dosage: 0.75-1 ml per litre of water (or 150-200 ml per acre, depending on spray volume).
*   **Azoxystrobin**
    *   Dosage: 0.5-1 ml per litre of water (or 150-200 ml per acre, depending on spray volume).
*   **Mancozeb** (Protective fungicide, often used in rotation or as a tank mix)
    *   Dosage: 2-2.5 grams per litre of water (or 500-600 grams per acre, depending on spray volume).

It is advisable to rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in the pathogen. For specific recommendations tailored to your farm, please consult with the local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts.
