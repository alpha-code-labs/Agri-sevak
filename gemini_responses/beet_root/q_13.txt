As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm the following regarding your query:

*   **Fruit fly:** This is not known to be a significant pest affecting Beet Root. While some generalist flies might occasionally infest damaged plant parts, major fruit fly species (like those attacking fruits or cucurbits) are not primary pests of Beet Root.
*   **Ber fly (*Carpomyia vesuviana*):** This is not known to affect Beet Root. Ber fly is a specific pest of Ber (Indian Jujube).
