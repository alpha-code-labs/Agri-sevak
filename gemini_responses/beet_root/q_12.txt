Scale insects and Mealybugs are common sucking pests that can significantly impact Beet Root cultivation in Haryana. They feed on plant sap, leading to stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, and reduced yield. Early detection and timely intervention are crucial for effective management.

Here's a scientifically verified approach to control these pests:

**I. Cultural and Mechanical Control Measures:**

*   **Regular Scouting:** Frequently inspect your Beet Root plants, especially the undersides of leaves and stem joints, for the presence of scale insects (which appear as small, immobile bumps) and mealybugs (which look like white, cottony masses).
*   **Manual Removal:** For small infestations, physically remove and destroy infested leaves or plants. A strong jet of water can also dislodge some pests.
*   **Weed Management:** Keep the field free of weeds, as many weeds can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to improve air circulation and reduce humidity, which can discourage pest proliferation.
*   **Ant Management:** Control ants, as they often protect mealybugs and scales for their honeydew secretions.

**II. Chemical Control Measures (Use only CIBRC approved chemicals and follow label instructions carefully):**

When infestations are severe and cultural methods are insufficient, chemical control may be necessary. Systemic insecticides are often effective as they are absorbed by the plant and move through its sap, reaching the feeding pests.

*   **For Scale Insects and Mealybugs:**
    *   **Buprofezin** (25% SC): Apply at a rate of 500-600 ml per acre, mixed in 200-250 litres of water. This is an insect growth regulator, effective against nymphs.
    *   **Spirotetramat** (150 OD): Apply at a rate of 200-250 ml per acre, mixed in 200-250 litres of water. This is a systemic insecticide with excellent translaminar and phloem mobility.
    *   **Imidacloprid** (17.8% SL): Apply at a rate of 125-150 ml per acre, mixed in 200-250 litres of water. This is a systemic neonicotinoid insecticide.
    *   **Thiamethoxam** (25% WG): Apply at a rate of 100 g per acre, mixed in 200-250 litres of water. This is another systemic neonicotinoid insecticide.
    *   **Acetamiprid** (20% SP): Apply at a rate of 50-100 g per acre, mixed in 200-250 litres of water. This is a systemic neonicotinoid insecticide.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Thorough Coverage:** Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and in dense foliage where these pests tend to hide.
*   **Rotation of Chemicals:** To prevent the development of pesticide resistance, rotate the use of insecticides with different modes of action.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always observe the specified pre-harvest interval (PHI) mentioned on the pesticide label to ensure the safety of the produce.
*   **Safety Precautions:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, and protective clothing while handling and spraying pesticides.
*   **Consult Experts:** For specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions, always consult with your local agricultural extension officer or scientists at HAU, Hisar.
