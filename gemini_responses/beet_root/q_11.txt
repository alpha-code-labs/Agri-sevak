As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Beetles and Weevils in Beet Root, and address the query regarding Sawflies.

**General Management Principles:**
Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is crucial for sustainable pest control. This includes:
*   **Regular Scouting:** Inspect your beet root plants frequently, especially young seedlings, for signs of pest damage or the presence of insects. Early detection allows for timely intervention.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove crop residues and weeds, which can harbor pests.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate beet root with non-host crops to break pest life cycles.
*   **Physical Removal:** For small infestations, hand-picking larger beetles or weevils can be effective.

**1. Beetles and Weevils (e.g., Flea Beetles, Blister Beetles, Root Weevils):**
Beetles and weevils can cause significant damage to beet root by feeding on leaves, stems, and sometimes roots. Flea beetles create small "shot-hole" damage on leaves, while blister beetles can defoliate plants rapidly. Adult weevils feed on foliage, and their larvae (root weevils) can damage roots.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Maintain good field hygiene by removing weeds, which can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
    *   Ensure proper plant spacing and nutrition to promote vigorous growth, making plants more tolerant to pest damage.
    *   Use row covers for young plants to physically exclude pests during critical growth stages.

*   **Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved):**
    When pest populations are high and causing economic damage, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always follow label instructions for dosage, application method, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).

    *   **For foliar feeding beetles and adult weevils:**
        *   **Malathion 50% EC:** Apply at a rate of 1.5 ml per litre of water (or 750 ml per acre in 500 litres of water).
        *   **Quinalphos 25% EC:** Apply at a rate of 2.0 ml per litre of water (or 800 ml per acre in 400 litres of water).

    *   **Application Notes:**
        *   Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage, especially the undersides of leaves where pests might hide.
        *   Apply insecticides preferably in the evening or early morning to minimize impact on beneficial insects and reduce drift.
        *   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

**2. Sawflies:**
This is not known to affect Beet Root. Sawflies are generally not considered a significant pest of Beet Root in Haryana or other parts of India.
