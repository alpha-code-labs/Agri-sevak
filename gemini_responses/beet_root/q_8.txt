As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling sucking pests in Beet Root in Haryana.

Firstly, regarding Psylla, this is not known to affect Beet Root.

For the control of Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips in Beet Root, an integrated pest management (IPM) approach is recommended, combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Principles:**

1.  **Regular Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your beet root crop for the presence of these pests, especially on the undersides of leaves and growing points. Early detection is crucial for effective management.
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Maintain field sanitation by removing weeds, which can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
    *   Ensure proper plant spacing to improve air circulation and reduce humidity, which can discourage pest build-up.
    *   Use yellow sticky traps (10-15 traps per acre) to monitor and trap adult whiteflies and thrips.
3.  **Biological Control:** Encourage natural enemies like ladybird beetles, lacewings, and parasitic wasps, which prey on aphids and whiteflies. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

**Chemical Control (when pest populations exceed economic threshold levels):**

When chemical intervention becomes necessary, use CIBRC approved insecticides and follow the recommended dosages and application guidelines. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

Here are some effective chemical options:

*   **For Aphids, Leafhoppers, and Whiteflies:**
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: Apply at 125-150 ml per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water.
    *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: Apply at 50-100 g per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water.
    *   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP: Apply at 50-100 g per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water.
    *   **Buprofezin** 25% SC: Apply at 500-600 ml per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water (highly effective against whitefly nymphs).

*   **For Thrips:**
    *   **Fipronil** 5% SC: Apply at 400-600 ml per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water.
    *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: Apply at 50-100 g per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water.
    *   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP: Apply at 50-100 g per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water.
    *   **Spiromesifen** 22.9% SC: Apply at 125-150 ml per acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water (also effective against whiteflies and mites).

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Spray Coverage:** Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where these pests often reside.
*   **Water Volume:** Use adequate water volume (typically 200-300 litres per acre for field crops) to ensure proper dilution and coverage.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying. Follow the instructions on the product label carefully, including pre-harvest intervals (PHI).
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pest resistance. Avoid repeated use of the same chemical group.

For specific local recommendations and current pest situations, it is always advisable to consult with your local agricultural extension officer or the Department of Entomology at HAU, Hisar.
