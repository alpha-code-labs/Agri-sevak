Mites, including Red spider mite (e.g., *Tetranychus urticae*) and Rust mite (various eriophyid mites), are indeed known to affect Beet Root, causing significant damage if not managed properly. These pests thrive in hot, dry conditions and can multiply rapidly.

Here's a scientifically verified approach for their control in Beet Root, suitable for Haryana conditions:

**Symptoms of Mite Infestation:**
*   **Red Spider Mite:** Fine webbing on the underside of leaves, yellowing or bronzing of leaves, stippling (tiny white or yellow spots) on the upper leaf surface, and premature leaf drop. Mites themselves are tiny, reddish-brown, and visible with a hand lens.
*   **Rust Mite:** Leaves may appear rusty, bronzed, or leathery. Growth can be stunted, and leaves may curl downwards. These mites are microscopic and require a powerful microscope for identification.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategy:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the field free of weeds, as many weeds serve as alternate hosts for mites.
    *   **Proper Irrigation:** Ensure adequate and timely irrigation. Mites prefer dry, dusty conditions. Overhead irrigation can help dislodge mites and increase humidity, which is unfavorable for them.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate Beet Root with non-host crops to break the pest cycle.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy severely infested plant debris after harvest.

2.  **Chemical Control (Acaricides):**
    When mite populations reach damaging levels, chemical intervention becomes necessary. Always ensure thorough coverage, especially on the underside of leaves where mites primarily reside. Rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

    Apply any of the following CIBRC approved acaricides:

    *   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:**
        *   Dosage: 125 ml per acre (mixed in 200-250 litres of water).
    *   **Fenpyroximate 5% EC:**
        *   Dosage: 300-400 ml per acre (mixed in 200-250 litres of water).
    *   **Propargite 57% EC:**
        *   Dosage: 1.0 - 1.5 litres per acre (mixed in 200-250 litres of water).

**Important Considerations for Spraying:**
*   **Timing:** Spray early in the morning or late in the evening to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure complete and uniform coverage of the foliage, particularly the undersides of the leaves, as mites are predominantly found there.
*   **Water Volume:** Use sufficient water volume (200-250 litres per acre for field crops) to ensure good coverage.
*   **Resistance Management:** Do not use the same chemical repeatedly. Rotate between different groups of acaricides to prevent mites from developing resistance.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying. Follow all instructions and safety precautions mentioned on the product label.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Observe the specified pre-harvest interval for each chemical to ensure the produce is safe for consumption.

Regular monitoring of your Beet Root crop for early signs of mite infestation is crucial for timely and effective management.
