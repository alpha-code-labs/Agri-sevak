As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend the following fertilizer schedule for Beet Root cultivation in Haryana. Please note that these are general guidelines, and a soil test is highly recommended to determine the precise nutrient requirements for your specific field conditions.

**General Nutrient Requirement for Beet Root (per acre):**
*   **Nitrogen (N):** 100-120 kg
*   **Phosphorus (P2O5):** 50-60 kg
*   **Potassium (K2O):** 60-80 kg
*   **Sulphur (S):** 20-25 kg

**Recommended Fertilizer Doses (per acre):**

**1. Basal Application (at the time of sowing):**

*   **DAP (Diammonium Phosphate):** 100-120 kg/acre
    *   *This provides approximately 18-21.6 kg of Nitrogen (N) and 46-55.2 kg of Phosphorus (P2O5).*
*   **Muriate of Potash (MOP) / Potassium Chloride:** 100-120 kg/acre
    *   *This provides approximately 60-72 kg of Potassium (K2O).*
*   **Elemental Sulphur (90%):** 20-25 kg/acre
    *   *Apply if soil test indicates Sulphur deficiency or if Single Super Phosphate (SSP) is not used as a primary P source.*

**2. Nitrogen Top-dressing (split applications):**

*   **Urea:** 175-200 kg/acre
    *   *The remaining Nitrogen requirement (after accounting for N from DAP) should be met through Urea, split into 2-3 applications.*
    *   **First Top-dressing (30-40 days after sowing):** 85-100 kg **Urea** per acre.
    *   **Second Top-dressing (60-70 days after sowing):** 85-100 kg **Urea** per acre.

**3. Nano-Fertilizers (Foliar Application):**

*   **Nano-Urea (Liquid):** 2-4 ml/L of water
    *   *Apply 2 sprays at 15-20 day intervals, starting 30-40 days after sowing, as a supplementary source of Nitrogen. Typically, 250-500 ml per acre per spray, depending on the spray volume.*
*   **Nano-DAP (Liquid):** 2-4 ml/L of water
    *   *Apply 1-2 sprays, 45-60 days after sowing, as a supplementary source of Phosphorus and Nitrogen. Typically, 250-500 ml per acre per spray, depending on the spray volume.*

**4. NPK (Complex Fertilizers):**

*   If using a complex NPK fertilizer as a basal application instead of separate DAP, MOP, and some Urea:
    *   **NPK (e.g., 12:32:16 or 10:26:26):** 150-200 kg/acre
    *   *Note: If using NPK complex, adjust subsequent Urea and Potash applications based on the specific NPK grade used and soil test results to meet the total nutrient requirements.*

**5. SSP (Single Super Phosphate):**

*   If **SSP** is chosen as the primary source of Phosphorus and Sulphur instead of DAP:
    *   **SSP:** 300-375 kg/acre
    *   *This provides approximately 48-60 kg of Phosphorus (P2O5) and 33-41 kg of Sulphur (S).*
    *   *In this case, the basal **DAP** would be omitted. The **Urea** requirement for top-dressing would increase by approximately 45 kg/acre (to compensate for the N that would have come from DAP).*

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Soil Testing:** Always conduct a soil test before applying fertilizers to understand the existing nutrient status of your soil. This will help in fine-tuning the fertilizer doses and avoiding over or under-application.
*   **Application Method:** Ensure uniform application of granular fertilizers. Foliar sprays should be done during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening).
*   **Watering:** Adequate irrigation is crucial for nutrient uptake by the plants.
*   **Crop Stage:** Adjust fertilizer application based on the crop's growth stage and visual symptoms of nutrient deficiencies.
