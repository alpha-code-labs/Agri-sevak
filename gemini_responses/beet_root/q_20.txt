Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the critical role of micronutrients in ensuring healthy growth and optimal yield of Beet Root. Addressing micronutrient deficiencies requires a scientific approach, starting with proper diagnosis.

**Crucial First Step: Soil Testing**
Before applying any micronutrient, it is highly recommended to conduct a comprehensive soil test. This will accurately identify which specific micronutrients are deficient in your field and to what extent, allowing for precise and economical application. Random application can lead to imbalances or toxicity.

Based on general observations and scientific recommendations for Beet Root cultivation in Haryana, here's how to address potential deficiencies of Zinc, Iron, Boron, Calcium, Magnesium, and Manganese:

### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, small and narrow leaves, interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, sometimes bronzing.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** (21% Zn) at 10-25 kg/acre, broadcast uniformly and mix into the soil before sowing or transplanting. This application is generally effective for 2-3 years.
    *   **Foliar Application:** For immediate correction, spray a 0.5% solution of **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** (5 g/L of water) or a 0.1% solution of **Zinc EDTA** (1 g/L of water) at the early vegetative stage and repeat after 15-20 days if symptoms persist.

### 2. Iron (Fe) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Pronounced interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, with veins remaining green. In severe cases, leaves may turn almost white.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** In highly calcareous or alkaline soils where iron availability is low, apply **Ferrous Sulphate Heptahydrate** (19% Fe) at 20-50 kg/acre, or **Ferrous EDTA** at 5-10 kg/acre, mixed with organic manure.
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray a 0.5-1% solution of **Ferrous Sulphate Heptahydrate** (5-10 g/L of water) or a 0.1-0.2% solution of **Ferrous EDTA** (1-2 g/L of water) on affected plants. Repeat every 7-10 days until symptoms disappear.

### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, internal black spots, heart rot (browning and rotting of the root crown), cracking of petioles, and malformed leaves. This is particularly critical for root crops like Beet Root.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Borax** (Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate, 10.5-11.3% B) at 4-8 kg/acre or **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (20% B) at 1-2 kg/acre, mixed with fertilizer or sand, before sowing.
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray a 0.1-0.2% solution of **Borax** (1-2 g/L of water) or a 0.1% solution of **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (1 g/L of water) at the 4-6 leaf stage and repeat at root development stage if needed.

### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, tip burn on young leaves, poor root development, internal browning of roots, and reduced storage quality.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** If soil test indicates low calcium, apply **Calcium Nitrate** at 10-20 kg/acre before sowing or as a side-dressing. For general soil health and calcium supply, **Gypsum** (Calcium Sulphate Dihydrate) can be applied, especially in sodic soils.
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray a 0.5-1% solution of **Calcium Nitrate** (5-10 g/L of water) or a 0.2-0.4% solution of **Calcium Chloride** (2-4 g/L of water) during the vegetative and root development stages.

### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, with veins remaining green. Leaves may develop a purplish or reddish tint in severe cases.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Magnesium Sulphate Heptahydrate** (Epsom salt, 9.6% Mg) at 10-20 kg/acre before sowing or as a side-dressing.
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray a 0.5-1% solution of **Magnesium Sulphate Heptahydrate** (5-10 g/L of water) on affected foliage. Repeat after 10-15 days if symptoms persist.

### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, often accompanied by small necrotic (dead) spots. Growth may be stunted.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Manganese Sulphate Monohydrate** (30.5% Mn) at 10-20 kg/acre, mixed with organic manure, especially in alkaline soils.
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray a 0.5% solution of **Manganese Sulphate Monohydrate** (5 g/L of water) on affected plants. Repeat after 10-15 days if necessary.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Timing:** Foliar applications are most effective when plants are actively growing and symptoms are mild.
*   **Water Quality:** Use clean water for spraying.
*   **Spreader/Sticker:** Adding a non-ionic spreader/sticker to foliar sprays can improve coverage and absorption.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management:** Combine micronutrient applications with balanced NPK fertilization and organic matter addition for sustainable soil health.

Always consult your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions.
