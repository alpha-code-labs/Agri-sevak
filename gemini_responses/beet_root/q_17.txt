As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following doses of organic manures for Beet Root cultivation in Haryana, based on scientific principles and local conditions. It is always advisable to conduct a soil test to determine specific nutrient deficiencies and tailor the application rates accordingly.

Here are the recommended doses:

*   **Farm Yard Manure (FYM):**
    *   Apply 15-20 tonnes per acre (approximately 15,000-20,000 kg per acre) during land preparation, at least 2-3 weeks before sowing. Ensure the FYM is well-decomposed to avoid nutrient immobilization and weed issues.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   Apply 4-5 tonnes per acre (approximately 4,000-5,000 kg per acre) during land preparation, mixed thoroughly into the soil. Vermicompost can also be used as a partial substitute for FYM, or as a top dressing at later stages if needed, though pre-sowing incorporation is most effective for root crops.

*   **Sagarika (or similar seaweed extract-based bio-stimulants):**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Apply 2.5-5 ml per litre of water.
        *   First spray: 20-25 days after sowing.
        *   Second spray: 40-45 days after sowing (at root development stage).
        *   Third spray (optional): If growth appears stunted or for enhanced yield, around 60-65 days after sowing.
    *   **Soil Application/Drench:** If applying through irrigation or as a drench, use 1-2 litres per acre, preferably during early growth stages to promote root development.

These organic inputs significantly improve soil health, structure, water retention, and nutrient availability, leading to healthier Beet Root crops and better yields.
