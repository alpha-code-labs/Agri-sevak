As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned conditions in Beet Root in Haryana:

**1. Grasshopper:**
Grasshoppers are polyphagous pests that can cause significant defoliation in Beet Root by feeding on leaves and tender shoots.
*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Maintain field sanitation by removing weeds and crop residues that can serve as breeding sites.
    *   Deep ploughing during the off-season can expose grasshopper eggs to predators and adverse weather conditions, reducing their population.
*   **Chemical Control (Apply when nymphs or adults are observed causing economic damage):**
    *   **Malathion** 50% EC at 1.25 litres per acre in 500 litres of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 200-250 ml per acre in 200-400 litres of water.

**2. Painted bug:**
This is not known to affect Beet Root.

**3. Red cotton bug:**

**4. Black ants:**
