As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling soil pests in Beet Root in Haryana:

### Control of Soil Pests in Beet Root

Effective management of soil pests like termites and root-knot nematodes in Beet Root requires an integrated approach combining cultural practices and judicious use of CIBRC approved chemicals.

#### 1. Termites

Termites can cause significant damage to the roots and developing beetroots, leading to wilting, reduced plant vigour, and yield loss.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Ensure proper field sanitation by removing crop residues, stubble, and woody debris that can serve as termite food sources.
    *   Deep ploughing before sowing can help expose and disrupt termite colonies.
    *   Avoid leaving heaps of organic matter or wood near the field, as these can attract termites.

*   **Chemical Control (Pre-sowing/At Sowing):**
    *   **Soil Treatment:** Apply one of the following chemicals uniformly to the soil and incorporate it thoroughly before sowing or at the time of sowing.
        *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: 2.0-2.5 L per acre, mixed with irrigation water or applied as a drench to the soil.
        *   **Fipronil** 0.3% G: 6.0-8.0 kg per acre, broadcast and incorporated into the soil.

#### 2. Nematodes (Root-knot Nematodes - *Meloidogyne* spp.)

Root-knot nematodes are a major concern for Beet Root, causing characteristic galls or swellings on the roots, stunted growth, nutrient deficiency symptoms, and significant yield reduction.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Implement a strict crop rotation program. Rotate Beet Root with non-host crops like cereals (e.g., wheat, maize, sorghum) or specific trap crops like marigolds (Tagetes spp.) for at least 2-3 years to reduce nematode populations.
    *   **Solarization:** During the hot summer months (May-June), prepare the field, moisten the soil, and cover it with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks. This raises soil temperature to levels lethal for nematodes.
    *   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost at 10-15 tonnes per acre. This improves soil health, enhances beneficial microbial activity, and can suppress nematode populations.
    *   **Resistant Varieties:** If available and suitable for Haryana's agro-climatic conditions, consider planting nematode-resistant Beet Root varieties.

*   **Chemical Control (Pre-sowing/At Sowing):**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply one of the following chemicals uniformly to the soil and incorporate it thoroughly before sowing or at the time of sowing.
        *   **Cadusafos** 10% G: 10.0 kg per acre, broadcast and incorporated into the soil.
        *   **Carbofuran** 3% G: 10.0-13.0 kg per acre, broadcast and incorporated into the soil. (Note: Use with extreme caution and strictly follow label instructions due to its toxicity profile).
        *   **Ethoprophos** 10% G: 10.0 kg per acre, broadcast and incorporated into the soil.

*   **Biological Control:**
    *   **Bio-nematicides:** Apply formulations containing beneficial fungi like *Purpureocillium lilacinum* (formerly *Paecilomyces lilacinus*) or bacteria like *Bacillus subtilis*. These can be applied as soil amendments or seed treatments. Follow the manufacturer's recommended dosage, typically 2.0-4.0 kg or L per acre for soil application.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the product label for precise dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest intervals.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of any chemical.
*   For specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and current pest pressure, it is advisable to consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts.
