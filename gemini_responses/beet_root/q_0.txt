As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Beet Root in Haryana. It is crucial to integrate cultural practices with judicious use of CIBRC approved fungicides for effective and sustainable disease management.

### General Principles for Fungal Disease Management in Beet Root:

1.  **Crop Rotation:** Practice 2-3 year crop rotation with non-host crops to reduce pathogen inoculum in the soil.
2.  **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest to prevent carry-over of pathogens.
3.  **Resistant Varieties:** Where available, choose beet root varieties known for resistance or tolerance to common fungal diseases.
4.  **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to improve air circulation and reduce humidity within the canopy, which discourages fungal growth.
5.  **Irrigation Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day. Drip irrigation or furrow irrigation is preferred to keep foliage dry.
6.  **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced fertilization. Excessive nitrogen can lead to lush growth, making plants more susceptible to certain diseases.

### Specific Fungal Diseases and Their Control in Beet Root:

#### 1. Alternaria (Alternaria Leaf Spot)

*   **Occurrence in Beet Root:** Yes, *Alternaria alternata* can cause leaf spots on beet root.
*   **Symptoms:** Small, dark, circular spots with concentric rings, often surrounded by a yellow halo. Severe infection can lead to defoliation.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Cultural:** Implement crop rotation and remove infected plant debris.
    *   **Chemical (Foliar Spray):**
        *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2.0-2.5 kg/acre.
        *   **Chlorothalonil** (75% WP) at 1.5-2.0 kg/acre.
        *   **Propiconazole** (25% EC) at 200-250 ml/acre.
        *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC) at 200 ml/acre.

#### 2. Anthracnose

*   **Occurrence in Beet Root:** Yes, *Colletotrichum dematium* has been reported, though it is not a major widespread disease of beet root in Haryana.
*   **Symptoms:** Irregular, water-soaked lesions that turn brown to black, often with dark fruiting bodies visible under humid conditions.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Cultural:** Use disease-free seeds and practice good field sanitation.
    *   **Chemical (Foliar Spray):**
        *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2.0-2.5 kg/acre.
        *   **Carbendazim** (50% WP) at 250-300 g/acre.

#### 4. Blight (General Blight, e.g., Cercospora Leaf Spot, Phoma Blight)

*   **Occurrence in Beet Root:** Yes, various blights, particularly Cercospora Leaf Spot (*Cercospora beticola*) and Phoma Blight (*Phoma betae*), are significant diseases of beet root.
*   **Symptoms:**
    *   **Cercospora Blight:** Small, circular spots with tan centers and reddish-purple borders, leading to extensive leaf damage and defoliation.
    *   **Phoma Blight:** Larger, irregular spots, often on older leaves, sometimes with concentric rings. Can also cause damping-off and root rot.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Cultural:** Use disease-free seeds, practice crop rotation, ensure proper plant spacing, and remove infected plant debris.
    *   **Chemical (Foliar Spray):**
        *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2.0-2.5 kg/acre.
        *   **Chlorothalonil** (75% WP) at 1.5-2.0 kg/acre.
        *   **Propiconazole** (25% EC) at 200-250 ml/acre.
        *   **Difenoconazole** (25% EC) at 100-150 ml/acre.
        *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC) at 200 ml/acre.

#### 5. Brown spot (Cercospora Leaf Spot)

*   **Occurrence in Beet Root:** Yes, *Cercospora beticola* is a major and widespread disease of beet root, often referred to as brown spot due to its appearance.
*   **Symptoms:** Small, circular spots with tan centers and distinct reddish-purple borders. In severe cases, spots coalesce, leading to extensive leaf necrosis and defoliation.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Cultural:** Same as for Blight (Cercospora).
    *   **Chemical (Foliar Spray):**
        *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2.0-2.5 kg/acre.
        *   **Chlorothalonil** (75% WP) at 1.5-2.0 kg/acre.
        *   **Propiconazole** (25% EC) at 200-250 ml/acre.
        *   **Difenoconazole** (25% EC) at 100-150 ml/acre.
        *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC) at 200 ml/acre.

#### 6. Downy Mildew

*   **Occurrence in Beet Root:** Yes, *Peronospora farinosa f.sp. betae* (syn. *Peronospora schachtii*) is a significant disease of beet root.
*   **Symptoms:** Yellowish-green spots on the upper surface of older leaves, corresponding to a greyish-purple, fuzzy fungal growth on the lower leaf surface. Infected leaves may become distorted and eventually die.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Cultural:** Use disease-free seeds, ensure proper plant spacing, and manage irrigation to reduce leaf wetness.
    *   **Chemical (Foliar Spray):**
        *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2.0-2.5 kg/acre (as a protective spray).

        *   **Hexaconazole** (5% EC) at 200-250 ml/acre.
        *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC) at 200 ml/acre.

#### 8. Grey Mildew

*   **Occurrence in Beet Root:** This is not known to affect Beet Root. The term "Grey Mildew" is not a recognized disease name for beet root. (Note: Grey mold, caused by *Botrytis cinerea*, can affect beet root, but it is distinct from "mildew").

**Important Considerations for Chemical Application:**

*   **Water Volume:** Always mix the recommended quantity of fungicide in 200-400 litres of water per acre for thorough coverage.
*   **Rotation of Chemicals:** To prevent the development of fungicide resistance, rotate fungicides with different modes of action.
*   **Timing:** Apply fungicides preventively or at the very first sign of disease symptoms for optimal efficacy.
*   **Safety:** Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the product label, including dosage, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI). Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).
