As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), here is the scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Beet Root in Haryana:

*   **Borers:** This is not known to affect Beet Root.
*   **Diamondback moth:** This is not known to affect Beet Root.
*   **Leaf folder:** This is not known to affect Beet Root.

**Control of Caterpillars in Beet Root:**

Various caterpillar species can cause significant defoliation in beet root. An integrated pest management (IPM) approach is recommended for effective and sustainable control.

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Methods:**
*   **Regular Monitoring:** Frequently scout your fields to detect egg masses and young larvae on the leaves. Early detection allows for timely intervention.
*   **Hand-picking:** In small areas or for initial infestations, manually remove and destroy visible caterpillars and egg masses.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Keep the field free of weeds, which can act as alternate hosts for caterpillars.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** After harvest, deep ploughing can expose pupae and larvae to predators and sunlight, reducing subsequent pest populations.

**2. Biological Control:**
*   **Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt):** Apply formulations of *Bacillus thuringiensis* (Bt) at the initial stages of larval development. Bt is a biological insecticide that specifically targets lepidopteran larvae.
    *   **Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki** (5% WP): 1-2 kg per acre (as per product label).

**3. Chemical Control (when pest population exceeds Economic Threshold Level - ETL):**
When the caterpillar population is high and causing significant damage, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development. Use the following CIBRC approved technical chemicals:

*   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC: 60 ml per acre
*   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG: 88 g per acre
*   **Flubendiamide** 20% WG: 50 g per acre
*   **Indoxacarb** 14.5% SC: 200 ml per acre
*   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: 100-120 ml per acre
*   **Spinosad** 45% SC: 64 ml per acre

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label carefully, including dosage, timing, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Ensure proper spray coverage for effective control.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during application.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions.
