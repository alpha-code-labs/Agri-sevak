Here are the recommended cultivation practices for Beet Root in Haryana:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   Beet Root is primarily grown by direct sowing of seeds.
    *   Line sowing is highly recommended over broadcasting for better crop management, uniform growth, and ease of intercultural operations like weeding and thinning.
    *   Sowing can also be done on raised beds, especially in areas prone to waterlogging, to ensure proper drainage and root development.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   Seeds should be sown at a shallow depth of 1.5 to 2.5 cm. Deeper sowing can hinder germination and emergence.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   **Row-to-row spacing:** Maintain a distance of 30 to 45 cm between rows.
    *   **Plant-to-plant spacing:** After germination, thin the seedlings to achieve a plant-to-plant spacing of 10 to 15 cm within the row. This ensures adequate space for root development and prevents overcrowding.

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   An average seed rate of 6 to 8 kg per acre is recommended for direct sowing. This accounts for potential germination losses and allows for subsequent thinning to achieve the desired plant stand.
