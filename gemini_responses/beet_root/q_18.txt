As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the use of Ethrel, 2,4-D, and Boron in Beet Root cultivation in Haryana:

It is crucial to understand the specific roles and recommendations for each substance, as their application varies significantly.

*   **Ethrel (Ethephon)**
    *   Ethrel (Ethephon) is a plant growth regulator that releases ethylene. While ethylene plays various roles in plant physiology, its general application for enhancing root development or yield in commercial Beet Root cultivation in Haryana is **not a standard recommended practice**. Its use is more commonly associated with fruit ripening or flower induction in other crops. Therefore, we do not recommend its routine application for growth regulation in Beet Root.

*   **2,4-D**
    *   **This is not known to be recommended for use as a growth regulator in Beet Root.**
    *   **2,4-D** is primarily a selective herbicide used to control broadleaf weeds. Beet Root is a broadleaf crop, and applying **2,4-D** to Beet Root, even at very low concentrations, would cause severe phytotoxicity, leading to crop damage or death. Therefore, **2,4-D** is strictly **not recommended** for use as a growth regulator in Beet Root cultivation.

*   **Boron**
    *   Boron is an essential micronutrient for Beet Root. Deficiency of Boron can lead to "heart rot" or "canker," characterized by internal blackening and cracking of the roots, significantly reducing yield and quality. Therefore, Boron application is highly recommended, especially in soils prone to deficiency.
    *   **Recommended Doses:**
        *   **Foliar Application:**
            *   Apply a foliar spray of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (e.g., Solubor, containing 20% elemental Boron) at a concentration of 0.1-0.2% (1-2 g/L of water).
            *   Alternatively, use **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate, containing 11% elemental Boron) at a concentration of 0.2-0.4% (2-4 g/L of water).
            *   Spray 200-400 litres of solution per acre, ensuring thorough coverage.
            *   Apply 1-2 sprays, starting at the 4-6 leaf stage and repeating after 3-4 weeks if deficiency symptoms persist or are anticipated.
        *   **Soil Application (Pre-sowing or at sowing):**
            *   Apply 1-2 kg of elemental Boron per acre. This can be achieved by applying:
                *   Approximately 5-10 kg of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** per acre, or
                *   Approximately 10-20 kg of **Borax** per acre.
            *   Mix the Boron fertilizer thoroughly with the soil before sowing or apply as a band application at sowing. Soil application is particularly effective in areas with known Boron deficiency.
