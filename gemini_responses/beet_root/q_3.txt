As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide scientifically verified advice for controlling various rot types in Beet Root, focusing on conditions prevalent in Haryana, India.

It's important to understand that many of the "rot" types you've listed are symptoms caused by a few key fungal pathogens, rather than distinct diseases themselves. The primary pathogens causing rot in Beet Root are *Rhizoctonia solani*, *Pythium ultimum*, *Aphanomyces cochlioides*, *Phoma betae*, and *Sclerotium rolfsii*.

Here's how to control these conditions:

### 1. Seed Rot and Seedling Rot (Damping-off)

These conditions are primarily caused by *Pythium ultimum*, *Rhizoctonia solani*, and *Aphanomyces cochlioides*, leading to poor germination, pre-emergence, and post-emergence seedling death. *Phoma betae* can also contribute.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Seed Treatment:** This is the most critical step for preventing seed rot and seedling damping-off.
    *   For broad-spectrum control against *Pythium*, *Rhizoctonia*, and other seed-borne fungi:
        *   **Thiram** @ 2-3 g/kg seed.
        *   **Captan** @ 2-3 g/kg seed.
    *   For specific control against Oomycetes like *Pythium* and *Aphanomyces*:
        *   **Metalaxyl** (e.g., as Metalaxyl 35% WS) @ 1-2 g/kg seed.
    *   For enhanced protection, a combination treatment can be highly effective, e.g., **Thiram** @ 2 g/kg seed + **Metalaxyl** @ 1 g/kg seed.

### 2. Root Rot, Collar Rot, Crown Rot, Foot Rot, Neck Rot, and Black Root Rot

These are often symptoms of established infections by pathogens like *Rhizoctonia solani*, *Aphanomyces cochlioides* (causing Black Root Rot), *Phoma betae*, *Sclerotium rolfsii*, and *Fusarium* species. These pathogens attack the root, hypocotyl, and crown region, leading to wilting, yellowing, stunting, and eventual plant death.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Practices (Preventive):**
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting beet root in the same field for at least 2-3 years, especially after susceptible crops.
    *   **Soil Drainage:** Ensure good soil drainage to prevent waterlogging, which favors many rot pathogens.
    *   **Balanced Nutrition:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can make plants more susceptible.
    *   **Weed Control:** Remove weeds that can act as alternate hosts for pathogens.
    *   **Deep Ploughing:** Helps bury crop residues and reduce pathogen inoculum.
    *   **Solarization:** In summer, covering the soil with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks can reduce soil-borne pathogen load.
*   **Chemical Control (Soil Drench/Application):**
    *   For *Rhizoctonia solani* and *Sclerotium rolfsii*:
        *   **Validamycin** @ 2-3 ml/L water as a soil drench around the base of affected plants.
        *   **Pencycuron** @ 0.5-1 kg/acre as a soil application or drench.
    *   For *Aphanomyces cochlioides* (Black Root Rot) and *Pythium*:
        *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride** @ 2-3 ml/L water as a soil drench.
    *   For broad-spectrum fungal control, including *Phoma betae* and *Fusarium* species:
        *   **Carbendazim** @ 0.5-1 g/L water as a soil drench.
        *   **Tebuconazole** @ 0.5-1 ml/L water as a soil drench.

### 3. Stem Rot

While a distinct "stem rot" disease is less common in Beet Root compared to root and crown issues, the base of the stem (hypocotyl) can be affected as part of the root/collar/crown rot complex, particularly by *Rhizoctonia solani* and *Sclerotium rolfsii*. The control measures listed for Root Rot, Collar Rot, and Crown Rot will be effective against these symptoms if they extend to the stem base.

### 4. Black Rot

In the context of Beet Root, "Black Rot" typically refers to **Black Root Rot** caused by *Aphanomyces cochlioides*. The control measures for this pathogen are included under "Root Rot, Collar Rot, Crown Rot, etc." above, specifically using **Metalaxyl** for seed treatment and **Propamocarb hydrochloride** for soil drench. It is important to note that the bacterial "Black Rot" caused by *Xanthomonas campestris* pv. *campestris* is primarily a disease of cruciferous crops and is not known to be a significant issue in Beet Root.

### 5. Fruit Rot

This is not known to affect Beet Root, as the edible part of the plant is a root, not a fruit.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the chemical product label for specific dosage, application methods, and safety precautions.
*   Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods, is recommended for sustainable disease control.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension specialists for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and current disease pressure.
