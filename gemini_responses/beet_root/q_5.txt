As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned conditions in Beet Root in Haryana:

### Control of Scab in Beet Root

Scab in beet root is primarily caused by soil-borne bacteria, mainly *Streptomyces scabies*, which can lead to rough, corky lesions on the root surface, reducing marketability.

**Integrated Management Strategies:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Implement a strict crop rotation program, avoiding susceptible crops (like potato, radish, carrot) for at least 3-4 years in the same field.
    *   **Soil pH Management:** Scab thrives in alkaline soils (pH > 6.0). Where feasible and suitable for beet growth, maintaining a slightly acidic soil pH (5.2-6.0) can help suppress the pathogen.
    *   **Organic Matter:** Incorporate well-decomposed organic matter into the soil to improve soil health and microbial diversity, which can naturally suppress pathogens.
    *   **Water Management:** Ensure consistent soil moisture, especially during root development, as fluctuating moisture can exacerbate scab. Avoid water stress.
    *   **Resistant Varieties:** If available, choose beet varieties known to have some resistance or tolerance to scab.

2.  **Chemical Control (Seed Treatment & Soil Amendments):**
    *   Direct chemical control for *Streptomyces* in the soil for established plants is limited. However, seed treatment can protect seedlings from early infection by various soil-borne pathogens.
    *   **Seed Treatment:**
        *   **Thiram**: Treat seeds at 2-3 g/kg of seed.
        *   **Carbendazim**: Treat seeds at 1-2 g/kg of seed.
    *   **Biological Control:**
        *   **Trichoderma viride**: Apply as a soil amendment at 2.5 kg/acre, mixed with 50-100 kg of Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost, before sowing.

### Control of Canker in Beet Root

In beet root, "canker" often refers to crown and root rot diseases, particularly those caused by fungi like *Phoma betae* (causing Phoma rot or black leg) or *Rhizoctonia solani*. These can lead to sunken, necrotic lesions on the crown or root.

**Integrated Management Strategies:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Certified Seeds:** Always use certified, disease-free seeds to prevent seed-borne infections.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate beet with non-host crops for at least 3-4 years to reduce pathogen build-up in the soil.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris to reduce inoculum sources.
    *   **Proper Drainage:** Ensure good soil drainage to prevent waterlogging, which favors many root rot pathogens.
    *   **Avoid Injury:** Minimize mechanical injury to roots and crowns during cultivation, as wounds can serve as entry points for pathogens.
    *   **Balanced Nutrition:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can promote lush growth susceptible to disease.

2.  **Chemical Control (Seed Treatment & Foliar/Soil Application):**
    *   **Seed Treatment:**
        *   **Thiram**: Treat seeds at 2-3 g/kg of seed.
        *   **Carbendazim**: Treat seeds at 1-2 g/kg of seed.
    *   **Foliar/Soil Application (if symptoms appear on crown/leaves):**
        *   **Mancozeb**: For foliar application to manage associated leaf spots that can spread to the crown, use 2.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Copper Oxychloride**: For foliar application, use 2.5-3 g/L of water.

### Control of Gummosis in Beet Root

This is not known to affect Beet Root. Gummosis is typically a condition affecting woody plants and fruit trees, characterized by the oozing of gum from the bark or fruit. Beet roots do not exhibit this symptom.

### Control of Lichen in Beet Root

This is not known to affect Beet Root. Lichens are symbiotic organisms (fungus and alga) that grow on surfaces like tree bark, rocks, or soil. They are non-parasitic and do not cause disease or harm to living plants, including beet roots. Their presence is often an indicator of good air quality.
