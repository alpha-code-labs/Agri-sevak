As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling soil pests in Sapota (Chikoo) orchards in Haryana:

Both termites and root-knot nematodes are significant soil pests that can severely impact Sapota health and productivity, especially in young orchards. Effective management requires an integrated approach.

### 1. Control of Termites (White Ants) in Sapota

Termites attack the roots and collar region of Sapota plants, leading to wilting, stunted growth, and eventually plant death, particularly in young trees.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural/Preventive:**
    *   Ensure good field sanitation by removing dead wood, stumps, and other organic debris from the orchard, which can serve as food sources for termites.
    *   Avoid direct contact of organic matter (like farmyard manure) with the tree trunk.
    *   Maintain proper irrigation to avoid excessively dry soil conditions, which can favor termite activity.
    *   Deep ploughing before planting can expose and destroy termite colonies.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **For New Plantings (Pit Treatment):**
        *   Mix **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** at 20 ml per pit with the soil before planting the sapling.
        *   Alternatively, use **Fipronil 5% SC** at 10 ml per pit, mixed with the soil.
    *   **For Established Trees (Drenching):**
        *   Drench the soil around the root zone of affected or susceptible trees with **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** at 50-100 ml per tree, diluted in 5-10 litres of water.
        *   Alternatively, use **Fipronil 5% SC** at 20-40 ml per tree, diluted in 5-10 litres of water, as a soil drench.
        *   Apply these treatments during periods of active termite infestation or as a preventive measure, especially during dry spells.

### 2. Control of Nematodes (Root-knot Nematodes - *Meloidogyne* spp.) in Sapota

Root-knot nematodes are microscopic worms that infect the roots, causing characteristic galls or knots. These galls impair the plant's ability to absorb water and nutrients, leading to stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, reduced fruit yield, and increased susceptibility to other diseases.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural/Preventive:**
    *   Use only healthy, nematode-free planting material from certified nurseries.
    *   Solarization of nursery beds (covering moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets during hot summer months for 4-6 weeks) can significantly reduce nematode populations.
    *   Incorporate organic amendments like well-decomposed farmyard manure or neem cake. Neem cake, applied at 250-500 kg per acre (or 1-2 kg per tree), has nematicidal properties and helps improve soil health.
    *   Avoid planting susceptible intercrops in the Sapota orchard.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Carbofuran 3% G**: Apply 30-50 grams per tree uniformly around the root zone. Lightly incorporate the granules into the soil and follow with a light irrigation. This application should be done when nematode populations are detected or during critical growth stages of the plant.

### General Recommendations:

*   **Integrated Pest Management (IPM):** Always integrate cultural, biological, and chemical methods for sustainable pest management.
*   **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your Sapota trees for signs of pest damage to allow for timely intervention.
*   **Safety Precautions:** When using any chemical pesticide, always read and strictly follow the instructions on the product label. Use appropriate personal protective equipment (gloves, mask, protective clothing) and ensure safe storage and disposal of chemicals.
*   **Consultation:** For specific field conditions and tailored advice, it is always recommended to consult with local HAU extension specialists.
