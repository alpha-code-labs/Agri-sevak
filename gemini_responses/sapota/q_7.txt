As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Dieback, Twig blight, and Tikka disease in Sapota (Chikoo) in Haryana.

### **Dieback and Twig Blight in Sapota**

Dieback and Twig blight are common issues in Sapota, often caused by fungal pathogens such as *Botryodiplodia theobromae* and *Colletotrichum gloeosporioides*. These conditions are frequently exacerbated by environmental stresses like nutrient deficiencies, water stress (both excess and deficit), and mechanical injuries.

**Control Measures:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Pruning:** Regularly inspect trees and prune out all affected, dead, or diseased branches and twigs. Ensure cuts are made well into the healthy wood to remove all infected tissue.
    *   **Sanitation:** Collect and immediately destroy all pruned material by burning or deep burial to prevent the spread of fungal spores.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure balanced fertilization based on soil test reports. Healthy, well-nourished trees are more resistant to diseases.
    *   **Water Management:** Provide adequate irrigation, especially during dry periods, but avoid waterlogging, which can stress the roots and predispose the tree to disease.
    *   **Wound Protection:** After pruning large branches, apply a protective paste (e.g., Bordeaux paste or a fungicidal paste containing **Copper Oxychloride**) to the cut surfaces to prevent pathogen entry.

2.  **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
    For preventive measures or at the first sign of symptoms, spray the trees thoroughly. Repeat applications may be necessary depending on disease severity and prevailing weather conditions.

    *   **Option 1 (Systemic + Contact combination):**
        *   Spray with a mixture of **Carbendazim** (1 gram per litre of water) and **Mancozeb** (2 grams per litre of water).
    *   **Option 2 (Contact Fungicide):**
        *   Spray with **Copper Oxychloride** (3 grams per litre of water).
    *   **Option 3 (Systemic Fungicides):**
        *   Spray with **Propiconazole** (0.5 ml per litre of water).
        *   Alternatively, spray with **Tebuconazole** (0.75 ml per litre of water).
        *   Alternatively, spray with **Azoxystrobin** (0.5 ml per litre of water).

### **Tikka Disease in Sapota**

This is not known to affect Sapota. Tikka disease is a specific leaf spot disease primarily associated with groundnut (peanut) crops, caused by *Cercospora arachidicola* and *Cercosporidium personatum*.

If you are observing leaf spots or similar symptoms on your Sapota trees, it is likely a different type of leaf spot disease. For accurate diagnosis and specific control recommendations, it is advisable to provide detailed observations or samples to the plant pathology department at HAU, Hisar.
