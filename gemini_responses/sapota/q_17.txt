As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following doses for organic manures and biostimulants in Sapota (Chikoo) cultivation, based on scientific principles and suitability for Haryana's conditions:

It is crucial to conduct a soil test to determine the specific nutrient requirements of your orchard. The following recommendations are general guidelines and can be adjusted based on soil test results and tree age/health.

### Recommended Doses of Organic Manures and Biostimulants for Sapota

1.  **Farm Yard Manure (FYM)**
    *   **Dose:**
        *   **Young Trees (1-3 years):** 10-20 kg per plant per year.
        *   **Bearing Trees (4 years and above):** 50-100 kg per plant per year.
    *   **Application:** Apply well-decomposed FYM in a ring around the tree canopy, about 30-60 cm away from the trunk, and incorporate it lightly into the soil.
    *   **Frequency:** Annually, preferably during the pre-monsoon period (May-June) or post-monsoon (September-October).

2.  **Vermicompost**
    *   **Dose:**
        *   **Young Trees (1-3 years):** 5-10 kg per plant per year.
        *   **Bearing Trees (4 years and above):** 15-25 kg per plant per year.
    *   **Application:** Similar to FYM, apply in a ring around the tree canopy and lightly incorporate into the soil. Vermicompost can also be used as a top dressing.
    *   **Frequency:** Annually, similar to FYM. Due to its higher nutrient concentration and microbial activity, it can be applied in split doses (e.g., half pre-monsoon, half post-monsoon) for sustained benefits.

3.  **Sagarika (IFFCO)**
    *   Sagarika is a seaweed extract-based biostimulant, rich in plant growth regulators, micronutrients, and amino acids. It is not a bulk organic manure like FYM or vermicompost but enhances nutrient uptake and plant vigor.
    *   **Dose:**
        *   **Foliar Spray (Liquid Sagarika):**
            *   **2.5-5 ml per Litre** of water.
            *   Ensure complete coverage of the foliage.
        *   **Soil Application (Granular Sagarika):**
            *   **8-10 kg per acre** (broadcast or applied near the root zone). For individual trees, approximately 100-200 g per mature tree, mixed into the soil around the base.
    *   **Application:**
        *   **Foliar:** Spray during critical growth stages such as pre-flowering, fruit set, and fruit development.
        *   **Soil:** Apply granular form near the root zone and irrigate immediately.
    *   **Frequency:**
        *   **Foliar:** 2-3 sprays per year, typically at intervals of 20-30 days during active growth and fruiting periods.
        *   **Soil:** 1-2 applications per year, usually during the main growing season.

**General Recommendations:**

*   **Soil Testing:** Always start with a soil test to understand your soil's current nutrient status and pH. This will help in tailoring the exact nutrient management plan.
*   **Integration:** For best results, integrate the use of organic manures with balanced chemical fertilizers based on soil test recommendations. Organic manures improve soil structure, water retention, and microbial activity, making chemical fertilizers more efficient.
*   **Watering:** Ensure adequate moisture in the soil after applying organic manures to facilitate decomposition and nutrient release.
