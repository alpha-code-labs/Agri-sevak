As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling physical damage in Sapota (Chikoo) in Haryana:

### 1. Fruit Bursting (Fruit Cracking)

**Causes:** Fruit bursting is primarily a physiological disorder caused by sudden fluctuations in soil moisture (a dry spell followed by heavy rain or irrigation), high temperatures, and deficiencies of essential micronutrients like Boron and Calcium.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Consistent Irrigation:** Maintain uniform soil moisture throughout the fruit development period. Avoid extremes of drought followed by sudden heavy watering. Implement drip irrigation for precise water management.
*   **Mulching:** Apply a thick layer (10-15 cm) of organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves, sugarcane trash) around the tree base. This helps conserve soil moisture, regulate soil temperature, and reduce moisture fluctuations.
*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Boron Deficiency:** If Boron deficiency is suspected or confirmed by soil/leaf analysis, apply a foliar spray of **Borax (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate)** at 1-2 g/L water, or **Boric acid** at 1 g/L water. Apply at fruit set and repeat after 30 days.
    *   **Calcium Deficiency:** To ensure adequate Calcium supply, which strengthens cell walls, apply a foliar spray of **Calcium nitrate** at 5-10 g/L water during the fruit development stage.

### 2. Leaf Burning/Melting

**Causes:** This condition is typically a result of severe heat stress, intense direct sunlight (sunburn), and/or water scarcity, leading to desiccation and collapse of leaf tissues.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Adequate and Consistent Irrigation:** Ensure the trees receive sufficient water, especially during the hot summer months in Haryana. Water deeply and regularly to prevent water stress.
*   **Mulching:** Apply organic mulch around the tree basin to reduce soil temperature, conserve soil moisture, and minimize evaporation.
*   **Shade Provision:** For young trees or during periods of extreme heat waves, provide temporary partial shade using shade nets (e.g., 30-50% shade) to protect foliage from direct, intense sunlight.
*   **Windbreaks:** Plant suitable windbreak trees (e.g., *Casuarina equisetifolia*, *Populus deltoides*) around the orchard periphery to protect Sapota trees from hot, dry winds that exacerbate water loss and heat stress.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure balanced nutrition to improve overall plant vigor and stress tolerance. Foliar application of **Potassium nitrate** at 10-15 g/L water can help improve the plant's resilience to drought and heat stress.

### 3. Hardness in Fruit

**Causes:** "Hardness in fruit" typically refers to fruits that fail to soften properly after harvest, remaining firm and unpalatable. This can be due to premature harvesting, improper post-harvest handling, or certain physiological factors affecting the ripening process.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Optimal Harvest Maturity:** Harvest fruits at the correct stage of physiological maturity. Indicators for Sapota include a dull appearance of the fruit skin, slight yellowing, and the absence of milky latex when the skin is scratched. Harvesting immature fruits will result in poor ripening and hard texture.
*   **Post-harvest Ripening:**
    *   Sapota is a climacteric fruit and ripens after harvest. For uniform and accelerated ripening, fruits can be treated with **Ethephon** (40% SL formulation) at 0.5-1 ml/L water. Fruits can be dipped or sprayed for a short duration (e.g., 5-10 minutes), then stored in a well-ventilated area at ambient temperature (20-25°C).
*   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure adequate **Potassium** supply during fruit development, as it plays a crucial role in fruit quality, sugar accumulation, and the ripening process. Soil application of **Potassium sulphate** or **Potassium nitrate** should be done as per soil test recommendations to support optimal fruit development.
