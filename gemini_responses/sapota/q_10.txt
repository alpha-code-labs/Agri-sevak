As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in Sapota (Manilkara zapota) in Haryana:

**1. Borers (Stem Borer, Shoot Borer, Fruit Borer):**
Borers can cause significant damage to Sapota trees, leading to wilting, dieback, and reduced fruit quality.
*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Regularly inspect trees for signs of borer attack such as boreholes, frass (excreta), gummosis, or wilting shoots.
    *   Prune and destroy affected branches or shoots showing signs of infestation.
    *   Maintain orchard hygiene by removing dead or decaying plant material that can harbor borers.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   For stem borers, inject a solution of **Chlorpyrifos** (2.5 ml/L of water) into the boreholes and plug them with mud or cotton. Alternatively, swab the affected trunk area with the same solution.
    *   For shoot and fruit borers, especially during early stages of infestation, spray with:
        *   **Chlorantraniliprole** at 0.3 ml/L of water.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** at 0.5 ml/L of water.

**2. Caterpillars (Defoliating Caterpillars, Fruit-eating Caterpillars):**
Various caterpillar species can damage Sapota leaves by feeding on them (defoliating caterpillars) or bore into fruits (fruit-eating caterpillars).
*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   In small orchards, hand-pick and destroy caterpillars.
    *   Remove and destroy webs or folded leaves containing larvae.
*   **Biological Control:**
    *   Spray with **Bacillus thuringiensis** (Bt) formulation at 1-2 g/L or ml/L of water, which is effective against young larvae and is an eco-friendly option.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   For severe infestations, spray with:
        *   **Chlorantraniliprole** at 0.3 ml/L of water.
        *   **Emamectin benzoate** at 0.25 g/L of water.
        *   **Flubendiamide** at 0.2 ml/L of water.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** at 0.5 ml/L of water.

**3. Diamondback Moth:**
This is not known to affect Sapota. Diamondback moth (*Plutella xylostella*) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower, mustard).

**4. Leaf Folder:**
Leaf folders are lepidopteran larvae that fold and web together leaves, feeding from within the protective fold, which can reduce photosynthetic efficiency.
*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Remove and destroy folded leaves containing larvae to reduce pest population.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Spray with:
        *   **Chlorantraniliprole** at 0.3 ml/L of water.
        *   **Emamectin benzoate** at 0.25 g/L of water.
        *   **Flubendiamide** at 0.2 ml/L of water.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** at 0.5 ml/L of water.

**General Recommendations:**
*   Always ensure thorough coverage of the plant during spraying.
*   Follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions mentioned on the pesticide label.
*   Observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) for any chemical applied, especially on fruiting trees, to ensure fruit safety.
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pest resistance.
*   For specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions, it is advisable to consult with local agricultural extension officers.
