Mites, including Red Spider Mite (*Tetranychus urticae*) and various Rust Mites (Eriophyidae family), are significant pests of Sapota (Chikoo) in Haryana, especially during dry and warm periods. They can cause considerable damage if not managed effectively.

**Symptoms of Mite Infestation:**

*   **Red Spider Mite:** Fine webbing on leaves, especially on the underside. Leaves may show yellowish or reddish-brown speckles, leading to bronzing, premature defoliation, and reduced fruit quality.
*   **Rust Mite:** Causes a rusty or bronzed appearance on leaves and fruits. Leaves may become leathery, distorted, or curled. Fruits can develop a rough, russeted surface, affecting marketability.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Mites in Sapota:**

1.  **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect the underside of leaves and young shoots for mites, their eggs, and webbing. Early detection is key for effective control.
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Proper Irrigation:** Ensure adequate soil moisture, as water-stressed plants are more susceptible to mite infestations.
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the orchard floor free of weeds, which can act as alternate hosts for mites.
    *   **Pruning:** Improve air circulation within the canopy through judicious pruning, which can create less favorable conditions for mites.
3.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Conserve natural enemies such as predatory mites (*Amblyseius* spp.), ladybird beetles, and lacewings, which feed on pest mites. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.
4.  **Chemical Control:**
    When mite populations are high and causing economic damage, chemical control may be necessary. Always rotate miticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development. Apply sprays thoroughly, ensuring good coverage of the underside of leaves.

    CIBRC approved miticides for Sapota include:

    *   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** Apply at 0.5 - 1.0 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Propargite 57% EC:** Apply at 1.0 - 1.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP:** Apply at 2.0 - 3.0 g per litre of water. This is particularly effective against rust mites and also helps control red spider mites, especially in cooler weather.
    *   **Abamectin 1.9% EC:** Apply at 0.5 - 0.75 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Fenpyroximate 5% SC:** Apply at 0.5 - 1.0 ml per litre of water.

    **Important Considerations:**
    *   Always read and follow the label instructions for the specific product being used, including pre-harvest intervals (PHI).
    *   Ensure complete coverage of the plant, especially the undersides of leaves where mites are most prevalent.
    *   Rotate between different classes of miticides to prevent the development of resistance.
