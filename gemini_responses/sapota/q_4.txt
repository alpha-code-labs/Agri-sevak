Wilt (including Parawilt) is a significant concern in Sapota (Manilkara zapota) cultivation in Haryana, often leading to considerable yield losses and tree mortality. It can be caused by various factors, including fungal pathogens (e.g., *Fusarium* species) and physiological stress (e.g., waterlogging, root damage). An integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods is crucial for effective management.

Here's how to control Wilt in Sapota:

**I. Cultural and Horticultural Practices:**

1.  **Improve Drainage:** Ensure excellent soil drainage. Sapota trees are highly susceptible to waterlogging, which can predispose them to wilt and parawilt. Avoid planting in low-lying areas prone to water accumulation.
2.  **Avoid Root Injury:** Be extremely careful during intercultural operations (e.g., weeding, tilling) to prevent damage to the root system, as wounds can serve as entry points for pathogens.
3.  **Maintain Tree Vigor:** Provide balanced nutrition through regular application of farmyard manure (FYM) and recommended fertilizers based on soil tests. Healthy trees are more resilient to diseases.
4.  **Pruning and Sanitation:** Remove and destroy any infected branches or plant parts immediately to prevent the spread of pathogens.
5.  **Disease-Free Planting Material:** Always use healthy, certified disease-free saplings from reputable nurseries.
6.  **Proper Irrigation:** Irrigate judiciously, especially during dry periods, to avoid both water stress and overwatering.
7.  **Soil Solarization:** In nursery beds or before planting new trees in affected areas, soil solarization during hot summer months can help reduce soil-borne pathogen inoculum.

**II. Biological Control:**

1.  **Beneficial Microbes:** Apply antagonistic fungi to the soil around the root zone.
    *   **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum**: Apply 2.5 kg of formulation mixed with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) per acre. This should be done twice a year, especially before monsoon and post-monsoon. For individual trees, apply 50-100 g of the mixture per tree.

**III. Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved):**

Chemical control should be used as a targeted measure, especially when cultural and biological methods are insufficient or in cases of severe infection. Drenching the soil around the root zone is the most effective method for soil-borne wilt pathogens.

1.  **Systemic Fungicides:**
    *   **Carbendazim 50% WP**: Drench the soil around the base of the affected tree with a solution of 1-2 grams per litre of water. Apply 5-10 litres of solution per tree depending on its age and size. Repeat after 15-20 days if necessary.
    *   **Thiophanate Methyl 70% WP**: Drench the soil around the base of the affected tree with a solution of 1-2 grams per litre of water. Apply 5-10 litres of solution per tree depending on its age and size. Repeat after 15-20 days if necessary.

2.  **Contact Fungicides (as a protective measure or in combination):**
    *   **Copper Oxychloride 50% WP**: Drench the soil around the base of the tree with a solution of 2-3 grams per litre of water. This can be used as a preventive measure or in rotation with systemic fungicides.

**Integrated Management Strategy:**

For optimal control, it is recommended to adopt an integrated approach:
*   Start with robust cultural practices to prevent the disease.
*   Regularly apply biological agents like *Trichoderma* to build soil health and suppress pathogens.
*   Use chemical fungicides as a curative measure for existing infections, rotating between different active ingredients to prevent resistance development.

Regular monitoring of your Sapota orchard for early signs of wilt is crucial for timely intervention and effective management.
