Here are the recommended cultivation practices for Sapota (Manilkara zapota) in Haryana:

Sapota is primarily propagated vegetatively for commercial fruit production, mainly through grafting (e.g., approach grafting, inarching) or budding (e.g., forkert budding). Seeds are generally used for raising rootstock, not for direct planting of fruit-bearing trees.

*   **Sowing method/pattern:**
    *   Commercial cultivation involves planting healthy, 1-2 year old grafted or budded saplings.
    *   The most common planting pattern is the **Square System**, where trees are planted at equal distances from each other in rows and columns, forming squares. This allows for easy inter-cultivation operations.
    *   Pits of 1 x 1 x 1 meter (length x width x depth) should be dug during summer (May-June) and left open for 15-20 days to expose them to sunlight, which helps in pest and disease control.
    *   Before monsoon, fill the pits with a mixture of topsoil, 20-25 kg farmyard manure (FYM) or compost, 1 kg neem cake, and 1 kg single super phosphate.
    *   Plant the saplings during the monsoon season (July-August) or in February-March.

*   **Planting depth:**
    *   Plant the grafted sapling in the center of the prepared pit.
    *   Ensure that the **graft union remains 10-15 cm above the soil level** to prevent scion rooting and potential rootstock-related issues.
    *   The root ball of the sapling should be at the same depth as it was in the nursery bag.
    *   Gently firm the soil around the plant and provide immediate irrigation.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   The recommended spacing for Sapota in Haryana typically ranges from **8 x 8 meters to 10 x 10 meters** depending on the variety, soil fertility, and management practices.
    *   For standard varieties and good growth conditions, a spacing of **10 x 10 meters** is often preferred, accommodating approximately 100 trees per hectare.
    *   For high-density planting (HDP) with specific varieties and pruning regimes, spacing can be reduced to 6 x 6 meters or 8 x 4 meters, but this requires intensive management.

*   **Seed dose:**
    *   This is not applicable for commercial Sapota cultivation as fruit-bearing trees are propagated vegetatively using grafted or budded saplings, not by direct seed sowing.
    *   Seeds are primarily used for raising rootstock in nurseries. The "seed dose" for rootstock production would depend on the desired number of rootstock seedlings.
