As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an integrated approach for weed management in Sapota orchards, combining cultural practices with judicious use of CIBRC-approved herbicides.

**General Principles for Weed Management in Sapota Orchards:**

1.  **Integrated Approach:** Combine manual, mechanical, and chemical methods for sustainable weed control.
2.  **Timing is Crucial:** Apply herbicides when weeds are young and actively growing for maximum efficacy. Pre-emergence herbicides should be applied to clean soil before weed germination.
3.  **Safety Precautions:** When using non-selective herbicides, always use a protective hood or shield to prevent spray drift onto the Sapota tree trunk, foliage, or roots. Avoid spraying during windy conditions.

**1. Cultural Methods:**

*   **Manual Weeding/Hoeing:** Regular manual removal of weeds, especially around the base of young trees, is highly effective. This is particularly important for parasitic weeds like Amarbail.
*   **Mulching:** Applying organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves, wood chips) around the tree basin helps suppress weed growth, conserve soil moisture, and regulate soil temperature.
*   **Intercropping/Cover Crops:** In the inter-row spaces, short-duration, shallow-rooted leguminous crops can be grown to suppress weeds and improve soil health.

**2. Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved Herbicides):**

**A. For General Broadleaf and Narrowleaf Weeds (including Bathu, Congress Grass, Phalaris minor):**

*   **Pre-emergence Herbicides (Apply to clean soil before weed emergence):**
    *   **Pendimethalin 30% EC**: Apply 3.3 - 5.0 L per acre in 200-300 L of water. This provides control of germinating annual grasses and some broadleaf weeds.
    *   **Diuron 80% WP**: Apply 1.0 - 2.0 kg per acre in 200-300 L of water. Effective against a wide range of germinating broadleaf and grass weeds.
    *   **Oxyfluorfen 23.5% EC**: Apply 1.0 L per acre in 200-300 L of water. Provides pre-emergence and early post-emergence control of many annual broadleaf and grass weeds.

*   **Post-emergence Herbicides (Non-selective, apply as directed spray, avoiding contact with tree trunk/foliage):**
    *   **Glyphosate 41% SL**: Apply 2.5 - 3.75 L per acre in 200-300 L of water when weeds are young and actively growing. This is a systemic herbicide effective against most annual and perennial weeds.
    *   **Paraquat dichloride 24% SL**: Apply 2.0 - 3.0 L per acre in 200-300 L of water. This is a contact herbicide providing quick knockdown of green weed foliage.
    *   **Glufosinate ammonium 13.5% SL**: Apply 3.0 - 3.7 L per acre in 200-300 L of water. A contact herbicide with some systemic action, effective against a broad spectrum of weeds.

**B. Specific for Amarbail (Cuscuta spp.):**

Amarbail is a parasitic weed and requires specific attention.

*   **Manual Removal:** This is the most effective method. Regularly inspect trees and manually remove Amarbail strands as soon as they are noticed, before they establish firmly and produce seeds. Remove and destroy the removed plant material away from the orchard.
*   **Pre-emergence Control:** Application of **Pendimethalin 30% EC** (as mentioned above) to the soil surface before Amarbail seed germination can help reduce its emergence.
*   **Spot Application (Extreme Caution):** For localized, heavy infestations, a very careful spot application of non-selective herbicides can be considered. Use a shielded sprayer to prevent any contact with the Sapota tree.
    *   **Glyphosate 41% SL**: 20-30 ml per L of water.
    *   **Paraquat dichloride 24% SL**: 10-15 ml per L of water.
    *   This method is risky and should only be used as a last resort by trained personnel.

**3. Orobanche:**

*   This is not known to affect Sapota. Orobanche species are root parasites primarily of herbaceous dicotyledonous crops (e.g., mustard, brinjal, tomato, tobacco) and are not typically a direct problem for woody perennial fruit trees like Sapota.
