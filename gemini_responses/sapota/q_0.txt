As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Sapota (Chikoo) in Haryana:

It is crucial to adopt an integrated approach combining cultural practices with timely and appropriate chemical interventions. Always ensure thorough spray coverage for effective control.

### Control of Fungal Diseases in Sapota:

1.  **Alternaria (Alternaria Leaf Spot/Fruit Rot)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Irregular to circular brown spots on leaves, often with concentric rings. Can also affect fruits, causing dark, sunken lesions.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   Remove and destroy infected plant debris.
        *   Spray with one of the following fungicides:
            *   **Mancozeb** (2.5 g/L of water)
            *   **Chlorothalonil** (2 g/L of water)
            *   **Propiconazole** (0.5 ml/L of water)
            *   **Difenoconazole** (0.5 ml/L of water)

2.  **Anthracnose (Leaf Spot, Twig Blight, Fruit Rot)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Dark, sunken lesions on leaves, twigs, and fruits. On fruits, it causes black, circular spots that can lead to rot. Twig blight causes dieback of young shoots.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   Prune and destroy infected twigs and fruits.
        *   Maintain good orchard sanitation.
        *   Spray with one of the following fungicides:
            *   **Carbendazim** (1 g/L of water)
            *   **Mancozeb** (2.5 g/L of water)
            *   **Propiconazole** (0.5 ml/L of water)
            *   **Azoxystrobin** (0.5 ml/L of water)
            *   **Tebuconazole** (0.75 ml/L of water)
            *   **Copper Oxychloride** (3 g/L of water) - particularly effective for twig blight and cankers.

3.  **Blast**
    *   This is not known to affect Sapota.

4.  **Blight**
    *   "Blight" is a general term. In Sapota, blight-like symptoms are often associated with severe Anthracnose (twig blight) or other leaf spot diseases.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   Follow the control measures for Anthracnose and other leaf spot diseases as described above.
        *   Ensure proper air circulation through pruning.

5.  **Brown Spot (e.g., *Phyllosticta sapotae*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Irregular to circular brown spots on leaves, which may coalesce and cause defoliation.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   Remove fallen infected leaves.
        *   Spray with one of the following fungicides:
            *   **Mancozeb** (2.5 g/L of water)
            *   **Carbendazim** (1 g/L of water)
            *   **Hexaconazole** (0.5 ml/L of water)

6.  **Downy Mildew**
    *   This is not known to affect Sapota.

7.  **Powdery Mildew (*Oidium manilkarae*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** White, powdery patches on young leaves, shoots, and sometimes flowers and fruits. Infected parts may become distorted or stunted.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   Prune affected parts to reduce inoculum.
        *   Spray with one of the following fungicides:
            *   **Sulphur** (Wettable Sulphur) (2-3 g/L of water) - *Note: Avoid spraying sulphur when temperatures are very high (>32°C) to prevent phytotoxicity.*
            *   **Hexaconazole** (0.5 ml/L of water)
            *   **Propiconazole** (0.5 ml/L of water)
            *   **Difenoconazole** (0.5 ml/L of water)
            *   **Kresoxim-methyl** (0.5 ml/L of water)

8.  **Grey Mildew**
    *   This is not known to affect Sapota.

**General Recommendations for Fungal Disease Management:**
*   **Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy all fallen leaves, twigs, and diseased fruits from the orchard.
*   **Pruning:** Prune trees to ensure good air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce humidity and fungal growth.
*   **Nutrition:** Maintain balanced nutrient levels in the soil to promote healthy, vigorous trees that are more resistant to diseases.
*   **Water Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation late in the day, which can prolong leaf wetness and favor fungal development. Drip irrigation is preferred.
*   **Rotation of Fungicides:** To prevent the development of fungicide resistance, rotate between different classes of fungicides (e.g., contact and systemic, or different modes of action).

Always read and follow the instructions on the fungicide label for safe and effective use, including pre-harvest intervals (PHI).
