As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding Sapota (Chikoo) maturity, harvesting, and cutting processes:

### Maturity Signs for Sapota

Identifying the correct stage of maturity is crucial for optimal fruit quality and shelf life. Sapota is a climacteric fruit, meaning it continues to ripen after harvest. Harvest should occur when the fruit is physiologically mature but still firm. Key maturity signs include:

*   **Colour Change:** The skin colour changes from a distinct green to a dull, light brown or potato-like appearance. The green tinge should largely disappear.
*   **Latex Test:** This is the most reliable indicator. Scratch the fruit skin gently.
    *   **Immature fruit:** Will exude a significant amount of sticky, white latex (milky sap).
    *   **Mature fruit:** Will show very little to no latex, or the latex will appear watery and less sticky.
*   **Skin Texture:** The rough, gritty feel of immature fruit skin becomes smoother and slightly waxy.
*   **Ease of Detachment:** Mature fruits detach relatively easily from the stalk with a gentle twist. Immature fruits hold firmly.
*   **Appearance of Lenticels:** The brown, corky spots (lenticels) on the fruit surface become more prominent and distinct.
*   **Fruit Size:** The fruit reaches its characteristic size for the specific variety.

### Harvesting Time for Sapota

Sapota trees bear fruit almost throughout the year in flushes, but there are usually two main harvesting seasons in India, which apply to Haryana's climate:

*   **Main Season:** February to June
*   **Lean Season:** September to November

Harvesting is a continuous process as fruits on the same tree mature at different rates. Multiple pickings (typically 4-5) are required during each season. It is essential to monitor the trees regularly (every 7-10 days) to pick only mature fruits.

### Cutting Process (Harvesting Method) for Sapota

Proper harvesting technique is vital to prevent damage and extend shelf life.

*   **Tools:** Use sharp secateurs, a sharp knife, or a specialized harvesting tool (e.g., a long pole with a net and blade for higher fruits). Avoid pulling fruits by hand, as this can damage the fruit or the tree branch.
*   **Method:**
    *   Cut the fruit with a small portion (about 0.5-1 cm) of the stalk (pedicel) attached. This prevents the latex from oozing out and contaminating the fruit surface, which can lead to discolouration and fungal infections.
    *   Handle fruits gently to avoid bruising, cuts, or abrasions, as these are entry points for pathogens and accelerate spoilage.
*   **Collection:** Place harvested fruits carefully into padded baskets or crates. Do not drop fruits or pile them too high, as this can cause compression damage.
*   **Post-Harvest:** After harvesting, fruits should be kept in a cool, shaded place to prevent sunscald and reduce field heat before further handling or packing.
