As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified irrigation management practices for Sapota (Chikoo) cultivation in Haryana:

Sapota is a relatively hardy fruit crop, but precise irrigation management is crucial for maximizing growth, flowering, fruit set, and yield, especially under Haryana's climatic conditions. While established trees exhibit some drought tolerance, strategic irrigation significantly boosts productivity.

### General Principles:
*   **Avoid Waterlogging:** Sapota roots are highly susceptible to waterlogging, which can lead to root rot and tree decline. Ensure excellent soil drainage.
*   **Critical Growth Stages:** Water availability is most critical during flowering, fruit set, and the subsequent fruit development period.
*   **Soil Type:** Lighter soils (e.g., sandy loam) require more frequent but lighter irrigations compared to heavier soils (e.g., clay loam) which can hold moisture for longer.

### 1. First Irrigation:

*   **After Planting (Young Saplings):**
    *   **Timing:** The first irrigation is paramount and must be given immediately after transplanting young saplings from the nursery to the main field. This helps settle the soil around the roots, eliminates air pockets, and ensures rapid establishment.
    *   **Quantity:** Apply 10-15 litres of water per plant, ensuring the entire root ball and surrounding soil are thoroughly wetted.
*   **For Established Trees (After Dry Spell/Dormancy):**
    *   **Timing:** If the trees have undergone a prolonged dry period or an induced water stress period (often practiced to promote uniform flowering), the first irrigation of the season or after this stress period should be given to rehydrate the tree, stimulate new vegetative growth, and support flowering.
    *   **Quantity:** Sufficient to wet the active root zone to a depth of 50-75 mm, adjusted based on soil type and tree size.

### 2. Second Irrigation and Subsequent Irrigations:

*   **After Planting (Young Saplings):**
    *   **Timing:** The second irrigation is typically administered 7-10 days after the first, depending on the prevailing soil moisture status and weather conditions. Continue irrigating at similar intervals until the sapling is well-established and shows signs of new growth.
*   **For Established Trees:**
    *   **Frequency:** Subsequent irrigation frequency is highly dependent on the tree's age, current growth stage, soil type, and environmental factors (temperature, humidity, rainfall).
    *   **Critical Stages:**
        *   **Flowering and Fruit Set:** Maintaining adequate soil moisture during these stages is crucial to prevent excessive flower and fruit drop, which can severely impact yield.
        *   **Fruit Development:** This is the most critical period for water demand. Water stress during fruit development leads to smaller fruit size, reduced overall yield, and compromised fruit quality. Regular irrigation is essential to ensure continuous fruit growth.
    *   **General Recommendation (Basin/Flood Irrigation):** During dry periods, bearing trees generally require irrigation every 10-15 days. Reduce irrigation frequency significantly during the winter months or during the monsoon season if rainfall is sufficient.
    *   **Soil Moisture Monitoring:** The most accurate method to determine irrigation timing is by regularly monitoring soil moisture. This can be done using simple methods like the "feel and appearance" method or by employing instruments such as tensiometers or soil moisture sensors. Irrigate when approximately 50-60% of the available soil moisture in the root zone has been depleted.

### 3. Sprinkler Use (Including Micro-Irrigation Systems):

While traditional overhead sprinklers can be used, they are generally less efficient for orchard crops like Sapota due to significant evaporation losses, wind drift, and a higher potential for increasing foliar diseases if applied improperly. **Micro-irrigation systems, particularly drip irrigation, are highly recommended for Sapota cultivation in Haryana due to their superior water use efficiency and suitability for perennial fruit crops.**

*   **Drip Irrigation (Highly Recommended):**
    *   **Advantages:**
        *   **High Water Use Efficiency:** Achieves 90-95% efficiency by delivering water precisely to the root zone, minimizing losses.
        *   **Uniform Water Distribution:** Ensures each tree receives the exact amount of water required.
        *   **Reduced Weed Growth:** Water is applied only to the plant's root zone, suppressing weed growth in inter-row spaces.
        *   **Fertigation Capability:** Allows for the efficient application of water-soluble fertilizers directly to the root zone along with irrigation water, enhancing nutrient uptake.
        *   **Energy and Labour Saving:** Reduces pumping costs and manual labour associated with traditional irrigation methods.
        *   **Suitable for Undulating Terrain:** Can be effectively installed on uneven or sloping land.
    *   **Design and Operation:**
        *   **Drippers:** Use 2-4 drippers per mature tree, strategically placed within the canopy drip line.
        *   **Discharge Rate:** Drippers typically have a discharge rate ranging from 2 to 8 litres per hour (LPH).
        *   **Frequency:** With drip irrigation, frequent (daily or alternate-day) and short-duration irrigations are generally more effective than infrequent, heavy applications.
        *   **Water Quantity (Drip):**
            *   **Young Trees (1-3 years):** Approximately 10-20 litres per plant per day, adjusted based on prevailing weather conditions and soil type.
            *   **Bearing Trees:** Approximately 40-80 litres per plant per day, depending on tree size, canopy spread, and season (higher in hot summer months, lower in cooler winter months).
        *   **Filtration:** An efficient filtration system is essential to prevent clogging of drippers, ensuring system longevity and performance.
    *   **Scheduling:** Drip irrigation schedules should be precisely calculated based on crop evapotranspiration (ETc) and regular monitoring of soil moisture levels.

*   **Micro-Sprinklers:**
    *   These are small sprinklers that deliver water over a limited, localized area, often used as an alternative to drippers, especially for younger trees or where a slightly wider wetted area is desired. They offer better coverage than single drippers but are still more efficient than traditional overhead sprinklers.
    *   **Advantages:** Similar to drip irrigation but provide a larger wetted area, which can be beneficial for broader root development in the early stages of tree growth.
    *   **Disadvantages:** Slightly higher evaporation losses compared to drip irrigation due to a larger wetted surface area.

By adopting these scientifically sound irrigation practices, particularly the implementation of micro-irrigation systems like drip, Sapota growers in Haryana can achieve higher yields, superior fruit quality, and significant water savings, contributing to sustainable agricultural practices.
