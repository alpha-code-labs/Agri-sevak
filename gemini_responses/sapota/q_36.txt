As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified practices to improve yield, fruit quality, and storage life for Sapota (Manilkara zapota) in Haryana:

### I. Improving Yield

1.  **Variety Selection:**
    *   Choose high-yielding varieties well-suited to Haryana's agro-climatic conditions, such as Kalipatti, Cricket Ball, Co.1, Co.2, PKM-1, and PKM-2. Kalipatti is particularly known for good yield and quality.
2.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Soil Testing:** Conduct regular soil tests to determine specific nutrient deficiencies and tailor fertilizer applications.
    *   **Macronutrients:**
        *   **Bearing trees (4-10 years):** Apply 500-1000 g Nitrogen (N), 250-500 g Phosphorus (P2O5), and 250-500 g Potassium (K2O) per tree per year.
        *   **Mature trees (>10 years):** Apply 1000-1500 g N, 500-750 g P2O5, and 500-750 g K2O per tree per year.
        *   Apply N and K in 2-3 split doses (e.g., pre-monsoon and post-monsoon). P can be applied once.
    *   **Micronutrients:**
        *   Foliar spray of **Zinc sulphate** (0.5% i.e., 5 g/L) + **Boric acid** (0.2% i.e., 2 g/L) during flowering and fruit set can address common deficiencies and improve fruit set.
3.  **Water Management:**
    *   Provide consistent irrigation, especially during flowering and fruit development. Drip irrigation is highly recommended for efficient water use. Avoid both water stress and waterlogging.
4.  **Pruning:**
    *   Perform light annual pruning after harvest to remove dead, diseased, criss-crossing, or unproductive branches. This encourages new growth and better light penetration, leading to improved flowering and fruit set.
5.  **Fruit Drop Management:**
    *   To reduce pre-harvest fruit drop, a foliar spray of **Naphthalene acetic acid** (NAA) at 10-20 ppm (10-20 mg/L) can be applied at the pea-size stage of fruits.

### II. Improving Fruit Quality

1.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Potassium (K):** Ensure adequate K supply as it is crucial for fruit size, sweetness (Total Soluble Solids - TSS), and overall fruit development.
    *   **Calcium (Ca):** Important for cell wall integrity, leading to firmer fruits and reduced physiological disorders.
    *   **Boron (B):** Essential for sugar translocation and fruit development.
    *   **Foliar Sprays:**
        *   Apply **Potassium nitrate** (1-2% i.e., 10-20 g/L) during fruit development to enhance size and sweetness.
        *   Spray **Calcium nitrate** (0.5-1% i.e., 5-10 g/L) during fruit development for improved firmness.
        *   A foliar spray of **Boric acid** (0.1-0.2% i.e., 1-2 g/L) during flowering and early fruit set can improve fruit quality.
2.  **Water Management:**
    *   Consistent soil moisture throughout fruit development prevents fruit cracking and ensures uniform fruit sizing and quality.
3.  **Fruit Thinning:**
    *   If fruit set is excessively heavy, manually thin excess fruits when they are small. This allows the remaining fruits to grow larger and develop better quality.
4.  **Pest and Disease Control:**
    *   Implement general pest and disease management practices to prevent damage to fruits, which can significantly reduce their market quality. Focus on preventing issues like fruit borer damage or fungal spots.

### III. Improving Storage Life

1.  **Harvesting at Proper Maturity:**
    *   Harvest fruits when they are physiologically mature but still firm. Indicators include a dullness of the skin, slight yellowing between the scales, and easy detachment from the stalk. Immature fruits shrivel, while over-mature fruits soften too quickly.
2.  **Gentle Handling:**
    *   Sapota fruits are delicate. Avoid dropping, bruising, or any mechanical injury during harvesting, sorting, and packing. Use padded containers.
3.  **Pre-cooling:**
    *   Rapidly cool fruits to remove field heat immediately after harvest. This slows down respiration and ripening. Hydro-cooling or forced-air cooling to 13-15°C is recommended.
4.  **Post-harvest Treatments:**
    *   **Washing:** Wash fruits with clean water to remove latex, dirt, and surface microorganisms.
    *   **Fungicide Dip:** To control post-harvest rots, dip fruits in a solution of **Carbendazim** (0.05-0.1% i.e., 0.5-1 g/L) or **Thiophanate methyl** (0.05-0.1% i.e., 0.5-1 g/L) for 2-5 minutes.
    *   **Growth Regulator Dip:** Dipping fruits in **Gibberellic acid** (GA3) at 50-100 ppm (50-100 mg/L) can help delay ripening and extend shelf life.
5.  **Storage Conditions:**
    *   **Temperature:** Store fruits at an optimal temperature of 13-15°C. Temperatures below 10°C can cause chilling injury (skin discoloration, failure to ripen, off-flavors).
    *   **Relative Humidity (RH):** Maintain a high RH of 90-95% to prevent moisture loss and shriveling.
6.  **Packaging:**
    *   Pack fruits in well-ventilated corrugated fiberboard (CFB) cartons with cushioning material (e.g., shredded paper, newspaper) to prevent bruising. Individual wrapping of fruits in newspaper or perforated plastic film can also reduce moisture loss and spread of decay.
7.  **Ethylene Management:**
    *   Sapota is a climacteric fruit and sensitive to ethylene. Store away from ethylene-producing fruits (e.g., ripe bananas, apples). Ethylene absorbents (e.g., potassium permanganate sachets) can be used in storage to reduce ethylene levels.
