As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Scab, Canker, Gummosis, and Lichen in Sapota (Manilkara zapota) in Haryana:

### Control Measures for Sapota Conditions:

**1. Scab:**
This is not known to affect Sapota as a specific disease. While general fungal infections can cause various lesions, "Scab" (e.g., caused by *Venturia* species) is not a characteristic disease of Sapota.

**2. Canker:**
Canker in Sapota can be caused by various fungal or bacterial pathogens, leading to sunken lesions on branches and trunk, often accompanied by gum exudation.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Prune affected branches well below the cankered area during dry weather. Ensure pruning tools are sterilized with a 1% sodium hypochlorite solution or 70% alcohol between cuts.
    *   Avoid mechanical injuries to the trunk and branches.
    *   Maintain proper tree vigor through balanced nutrition and irrigation.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   After pruning, apply a fungicidal paste to the cut surfaces.
    *   For active cankers, scrape off the affected bark until healthy tissue is exposed, then apply a paste of:
        *   **Copper oxychloride** (50% WP) at 50 g per litre of water.
    *   As a prophylactic spray, especially after pruning or during periods conducive to disease:
        *   **Copper oxychloride** (50% WP) at 3 g/L of water.
        *   **Carbendazim** (50% WP) at 1 g/L of water.

**3. Gummosis:**
Gummosis is the exudation of gum from the bark, often a symptom of stress, mechanical injury, or fungal infections (e.g., *Phytophthora* species) which can lead to canker.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Improve soil drainage, as waterlogging can predispose trees to gummosis.
    *   Avoid mechanical injuries to the trunk and roots.
    *   Ensure proper nutrient management and irrigation to reduce tree stress.
    *   Remove weeds around the tree base to improve air circulation.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   For affected areas, scrape off the gum and discolored bark until healthy tissue is visible. Paint the wound with a fungicidal paste:
        *   **Copper oxychloride** (50% WP) at 50 g per litre of water.
    *   For *Phytophthora*-induced gummosis, a soil drench or foliar spray can be effective:
        *   **Fosetyl-aluminium** (80% WP) at 2.5 g/L of water (as a drench around the tree base or foliar spray).
        *   **Propiconazole** (25% EC) at 1 ml/L of water (as a foliar spray or painted on scraped trunk).

**4. Lichen:**
Lichens are symbiotic organisms (fungus and alga) that grow on the bark of trees. They are generally non-parasitic and do not directly harm the tree. Heavy growth can sometimes indicate poor tree vigor or high humidity.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Improve tree vigor through proper fertilization, irrigation, and pest/disease management. A healthy, vigorously growing tree often sheds lichens naturally.
    *   Prune dense canopy to improve air circulation and light penetration, which can discourage lichen growth.
    *   In cases of very heavy growth, lichens can be gently brushed off the bark using a stiff brush, especially during the dry season.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Chemical control is generally not necessary as lichens are not parasitic. However, a general prophylactic spray of copper-based fungicides can help reduce their growth indirectly:
        *   **Copper oxychloride** (50% WP) at 3 g/L of water.
        *   **Bordeaux mixture** (1%) can also be used during dormant periods.
