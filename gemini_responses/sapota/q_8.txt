Namaste, Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding sucking pests in Sapota (Chikoo) orchards. These pests, including Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, Thrips, and Psylla, can cause significant damage by feeding on plant sap, leading to stunted growth, leaf curling, premature fruit drop, and transmission of viral diseases.

Effective management requires an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical control methods.

### Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Sucking Pests in Sapota

1.  **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your Sapota trees, especially new flushes, tender leaves, and the undersides of leaves, for the presence of pests. Yellow sticky traps can be used to monitor whiteflies and leafhoppers.
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy infested plant parts, water shoots, and unwanted branches to improve air circulation and reduce pest harborage.
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the orchard floor free of weeds, as they can act as alternate hosts for many sucking pests.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush, tender growth that is more attractive to sucking pests. Maintain balanced nutrition.
    *   **Water Management:** Ensure proper irrigation to reduce plant stress, making trees less susceptible to pest attacks.
3.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Encourage natural enemies like ladybird beetles, lacewings, hoverfly larvae, and parasitic wasps, which prey on aphids, whiteflies, and other soft-bodied insects. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.
    *   **Azadirachtin** (Neem-based formulations) can be used as a botanical insecticide, which has repellent and anti-feedant properties, and is relatively safe for beneficial insects.

### Chemical Control (When necessary)

When pest populations reach economic threshold levels, chemical intervention may be required. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Apply sprays during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy. Ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves.

For the control of Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, Thrips, and Psylla in Sapota, the following CIBRC approved technical chemicals can be used:

*   **For general sucking pests (Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, Thrips, Psylla):**
    *   **Azadirachtin** (1500 ppm): 3-5 ml per litre of water. (Effective as a preventive and early-stage treatment, also suitable for organic farming).
    *   **Imidacloprid** (17.8% SL): 0.3-0.5 ml per litre of water. (Systemic insecticide, highly effective against a wide range of sucking pests).
    *   **Thiamethoxam** (25% WG): 0.2-0.4 g per litre of water. (Systemic insecticide, provides quick knockdown and long residual control).
    *   **Acetamiprid** (20% SP): 0.2-0.4 g per litre of water. (Systemic insecticide, effective against resistant whiteflies and other sucking pests).
    *   **Dimethoate** (30% EC): 1.0-1.5 ml per litre of water. (Contact and systemic action, effective against aphids, leafhoppers, and thrips).

*   **For specific control of Whiteflies and Aphids:**
    *   **Flonicamid** (50% WG): 0.3-0.4 g per litre of water. (Specific action against aphids and whiteflies, acts as a feeding inhibitor).
    *   **Pymetrozine** (50% WG): 0.3-0.4 g per litre of water. (Specific action against aphids and whiteflies, causes cessation of feeding).
    *   **Buprofezin** (25% SC): 1.25 ml per litre of water. (Insect Growth Regulator, primarily effective against whitefly nymphs and mealybugs by inhibiting chitin synthesis).

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Rotation:** Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, and protective clothing while handling and spraying chemicals.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Observe the recommended pre-harvest interval for each chemical to ensure the safety of the fruit for consumption.
*   **Spray Coverage:** Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where many sucking pests reside.
*   **Water Quality:** Use clean water for spraying.

By adopting an integrated approach, you can effectively manage sucking pests in your Sapota orchard, ensuring healthy trees and good yields. For specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions, please consult with your local agricultural extension officer.
