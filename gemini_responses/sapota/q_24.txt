As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend the following for Sapota transplantation in Haryana:

### Ideal Transplantation Time

The ideal time for transplanting Sapota saplings in Haryana is during the monsoon season, when humidity is high and soil moisture is abundant.

*   **Primary Window:** July to September (Monsoon season). This period ensures better establishment due to natural rainfall and moderate temperatures.
*   **Secondary Window:** February to March (Late winter/Early spring). If irrigation facilities are assured, this period can also be suitable, allowing the plant to establish before the intense summer heat.

### Transplantation Distance

Sapota trees grow into large, spreading canopies, so adequate spacing is crucial for proper growth, light penetration, and air circulation.

*   **Standard Spacing:** 8 meters x 8 meters (plant to plant and row to row). This allows for optimal development of individual trees.
*   **High-Density Planting (HDP):** For specific dwarf or semi-dwarf varieties, or with intensive pruning, HDP can be considered at 6 meters x 6 meters, but this requires more skilled management and regular pruning. For general advice, 8x8 m is recommended.

### Transplantation Process

A well-executed transplantation process is vital for the successful establishment and long-term health of Sapota trees.

1.  **Pit Preparation (15-30 days before planting):**
    *   Dig pits of 1 meter x 1 meter x 1 meter (length x width x depth) at the marked spacing.
    *   Allow the pits to remain open for 15-30 days to expose the soil to sunlight, which helps in killing soil-borne pests and pathogens.
    *   Refill the pits with a mixture of:
        *   Topsoil (from the pit)
        *   20-30 kg of well-decomposed Farmyard Manure (FYM) or compost.
        *   1 kg of **Single Superphosphate** (SSP).
        *   *Optional (for termite control):* 50-100 g of **Chlorpyrifos** 1.5% Dusting Powder (DP) or **Fipronil** 0.3% Granules (GR) mixed thoroughly with the soil at the bottom of the pit, especially if termite infestation is a known issue in the area.

2.  **Selection of Saplings:**
    *   Obtain healthy, vigorous, 1-2 year old grafted saplings from a reputable nursery.
    *   Ensure the graft union is strong and clearly visible.
    *   The saplings should be free from pests and diseases.

3.  **Planting the Sapling:**
    *   Carefully remove the sapling from its polybag or container, ensuring the root ball remains intact and undisturbed.
    *   Place the sapling in the center of the prepared pit.
    *   Ensure that the graft union is positioned 10-15 cm above the ground level to prevent scion rooting and ensure the benefits of the rootstock.
    *   Fill the pit with the remaining prepared soil mixture, gently firming the soil around the root ball to remove any air pockets.
    *   Create a small basin or ring around the plant for efficient water retention.

4.  **Post-Planting Care:**
    *   **Immediate Watering:** Water the sapling immediately after planting to settle the soil around the roots.
    *   **Staking:** Provide a sturdy stake to support the young plant, especially in windy areas, to prevent damage to the root system.
    *   **Mulching:** Apply a 10-15 cm layer of organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves, sugarcane trash) around the base of the plant, keeping it slightly away from the stem. This helps conserve soil moisture, regulate soil temperature, and suppress weed growth.
    *   **Protection:** Protect young saplings from direct harsh sunlight during the initial establishment phase, especially if planted outside the monsoon season.
    *   **Pruning:** Remove any dead, diseased, or crossing branches to encourage healthy growth.
