As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend the following doses for Growth Regulators and Boron in Sapota (Manilkara zapota) based on scientific verification and suitability for Haryana's conditions:

### Growth Regulators/Hormones and Micronutrient in Sapota

**1. For Fruit Ripening and Uniform Colour Development:**

*   **Chemical:** **Ethephon** (e.g., as a 39% SL formulation)
*   **Dose:** 100-250 ppm (parts per million)
    *   **Application:** Spray fruits 7-10 days before anticipated harvest. For a 39% SL formulation, this translates to approximately 0.25-0.65 mL of product per litre of water. Ensure thorough coverage of the fruits.

**2. For Fruit Drop Control and Improved Fruit Retention:**

*   **Chemical:** **2,4-D Sodium Salt**
*   **Dose:** 5-10 ppm (parts per million)
    *   **Application:** Spray at the pea-size stage of fruits. It is crucial to use very low concentrations, as higher doses of 2,4-D act as a herbicide and can cause severe damage. For a 80% WP formulation, 5 ppm is approximately 0.006 g per litre of water. Dilute carefully.

**3. For Boron Deficiency Correction, Improved Fruit Set, and Quality:**

*   **Chemical:** **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate, containing approximately 11% Boron) OR **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (containing approximately 20.5% Boron, e.g., Solubor)
*   **Dose (Foliar Spray):** 0.1-0.2% solution
    *   **Application:**
        *   If using **Borax**: Dissolve 1-2 grams of **Borax** per litre of water.
        *   If using **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate**: Dissolve 0.5-1 gram of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** per litre of water.
    *   **Timing:** Spray during flowering and fruit development stages (e.g., pre-bloom, post-fruit set, and during fruit enlargement) to ensure adequate Boron supply.
*   **Dose (Soil Application):** 100-200 grams of **Borax** per mature tree per year.
    *   **Application:** Apply evenly around the tree basin and incorporate into the soil, preferably before the monsoon or during the dormant season. Soil application should be based on soil test recommendations.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always use clean water for spraying.
*   Ensure uniform coverage of the plant parts.
*   Adhere strictly to the recommended doses, especially for growth regulators, as higher concentrations can be detrimental.
*   Consult a local agricultural expert or HAU extension specialist for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and soil test results.
*   Always read and follow the instructions and safety precautions on the product label.
