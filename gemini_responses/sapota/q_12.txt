Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling Scale insects and Mealybugs in Sapota (Chikoo) orchards in Haryana. These sap-sucking pests can cause significant damage if not managed effectively.

Here's a comprehensive approach:

**I. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Principles:**

1.  **Regular Monitoring:** Frequently inspect your Sapota trees, especially tender shoots, leaf axils, fruits, and the underside of leaves, for early signs of scale insects (small, immobile bumps, often waxy or cottony) and mealybugs (white, powdery, soft-bodied insects).
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy severely infested branches, twigs, and fruits. This reduces the pest population and improves air circulation.
    *   **Orchard Hygiene:** Keep the orchard clean by removing weeds and plant debris, which can harbor pests.
    *   **Avoid Excessive Nitrogen:** High nitrogen fertilization can lead to lush, soft growth that is more attractive to sap-sucking pests.
    *   **Ant Control:** Control ants, as they often protect mealybugs and scales from natural enemies in exchange for honeydew. Apply sticky bands on tree trunks or use ant baits.
3.  **Biological Control:** Encourage natural enemies such as ladybird beetles (e.g., *Cryptolaemus montrouzieri* for mealybugs), lacewings, and parasitic wasps. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

**II. Chemical Control Measures:**

When pest populations are high and cultural/biological methods are insufficient, chemical intervention becomes necessary. Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the underside of leaves, in leaf axils, and on fruits where these pests tend to aggregate.

**A. For Scale Insects and Mealybugs (Commonly effective chemicals):**

1.  **Horticultural Mineral Oil (HMO):**
    *   **Technical Chemical Name:** **Horticultural Mineral Oil** (often referred to as White Oil)
    *   **Dosage:** 10-20 ml/L of water.
    *   **Application:** Effective against all stages, especially crawlers and adults, by suffocating them. Apply during cooler parts of the day and avoid spraying during very hot weather (above 30°C) or when trees are under moisture stress. Can be used as a dormant oil spray or during active growth at lower concentrations.
2.  **Buprofezin 25% SC:**
    *   **Technical Chemical Name:** **Buprofezin**
    *   **Dosage:** 1.25 ml/L of water.
    *   **Application:** An insect growth regulator that interferes with chitin synthesis, primarily effective against nymphs (young stages) of scales and mealybugs. It has a long residual effect.
3.  **Spirotetramat 150 OD:**
    *   **Technical Chemical Name:** **Spirotetramat**
    *   **Dosage:** 0.75 ml/L of water.
    *   **Application:** A systemic insecticide with translaminar and two-way systemic movement, providing excellent control of sap-sucking pests, including scales and mealybugs. It affects all developmental stages.
4.  **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:**
    *   **Technical Chemical Name:** **Imidacloprid**
    *   **Dosage:** 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Application:** A systemic neonicotinoid insecticide, highly effective against sap-sucking pests. It is absorbed by the plant and ingested by the pests as they feed.
5.  **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:**
    *   **Technical Chemical Name:** **Thiamethoxam**
    *   **Dosage:** 0.3 g/L of water.
    *   **Application:** Another systemic neonicotinoid insecticide, effective against a wide range of sap-sucking pests, including mealybugs and scale crawlers.

**III. Important Considerations:**

*   **Rotation of Chemicals:** To prevent the development of pesticide resistance, rotate insecticides with different modes of action. Do not use the same chemical repeatedly.
*   **Timing of Application:** For scale insects, target the crawler stage (young, mobile stage) as they are most vulnerable. For mealybugs, spray when populations are building up.
*   **Thorough Coverage:** Ensure complete coverage of the plant, including the undersides of leaves, stems, and fruit surfaces, as these pests often hide in protected areas.
*   **Safety Precautions:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, and protective clothing while handling and spraying chemicals. Follow the instructions on the product label carefully regarding dosage, application method, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   **Consult Local Experts:** For specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and current pest pressure, it is always advisable to consult with local agricultural extension officers or HAU experts.

By adopting these scientifically verified practices, you can effectively manage scale insects and mealybugs in your Sapota orchard.
