As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified fertilizer schedule for Sapota (Manilkara zapota) cultivation in Haryana. Please note that these are general guidelines, and a **soil test** is crucial for precise recommendations tailored to your specific field conditions.

### General NPK Recommendation (per tree per year)

The nutrient requirement for Sapota trees varies significantly with age. The following doses are for Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P2O5), and Potassium (K2O) in grams per tree per year:

*   **Young Trees (1-3 years):**
    *   **Year 1:** 50 g N, 25 g P2O5, 25 g K2O
    *   **Year 2:** 100 g N, 50 g P2O5, 50 g K2O
    *   **Year 3:** 200 g N, 100 g P2O5, 100 g K2O
*   **Bearing Trees (4-9 years):** Gradually increase the dose to reach 500 g N, 250 g P2O5, 250 g K2O by year 9.
*   **Mature Bearing Trees (10+ years):** 1000 g N, 500 g P2O5, 500 g K2O

### Specific Fertilizer Doses (for Mature Bearing Trees, 10+ years, per tree per year)

To achieve the recommended 1000 g N, 500 g P2O5, and 500 g K2O, along with Sulphur, you can use a combination of the following fertilizers:

*   **Urea (46% N):**
    *   Approximately **1.5 - 2.0 kg** per tree per year.
    *   *Note:* The exact quantity will depend on the amount of N supplied by DAP or NPK complex fertilizers.
*   **DAP (Di-Ammonium Phosphate, 18% N, 46% P2O5):**
    *   Approximately **1.0 - 1.2 kg** per tree per year.
    *   This will supply most of the P2O5 requirement and a portion of the N.
*   **SSP (Single Super Phosphate, 16% P2O5, ~11% Sulphur):**
    *   As an alternative to DAP for Phosphorus, or to supplement Sulphur: Approximately **3.0 - 3.5 kg** per tree per year.
    *   If using SSP, adjust **Urea** dose as SSP provides no N.
*   **Muriate of Potash (MOP, 60% K2O):**
    *   Approximately **0.8 - 1.0 kg** per tree per year.
*   **Sulphur (Elemental Sulphur 90%):**
    *   If not adequately supplied by SSP, apply **100 - 200 g** per tree per year.
*   **NPK (Complex Fertilizers, e.g., 15:15:15 or 19:19:19):**
    *   If using complex NPK fertilizers, the dose would be approximately **2.5 - 3.5 kg** per tree per year for a balanced NPK (e.g., 15:15:15).
    *   *Note:* Adjust the quantity based on the specific NPK ratio and the total N, P2O5, K2O requirement. You may still need to supplement with additional **Urea** or **Muriate of Potash** to meet the full N and K requirements.

### Nano-Fertilizers

Nano-fertilizers are designed for foliar application and can supplement or partially replace conventional fertilizers, improving nutrient use efficiency.

*   **Nano-Urea (4% N):**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Application:** 2-3 foliar sprays during active vegetative growth stages (e.g., pre-flowering, post-fruit set).
*   **Nano-DAP (8% N, 16% P2O5):**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Application:** 2-3 foliar sprays during flowering and fruit development stages.

### Application Timing and Method

*   **Basal Application:** For mature trees, the annual fertilizer dose should be split into two equal applications.
    *   **First Application:** During June-July (after monsoon onset).
    *   **Second Application:** During October-November (post-monsoon).
*   **Method:** Apply fertilizers in a ring around the tree canopy, 30-60 cm away from the trunk, and incorporate them into the soil by light digging. Ensure adequate moisture after application.
*   **Foliar Application:** Nano-fertilizers should be sprayed evenly on the foliage, preferably in the morning or late afternoon.

### Important Considerations

*   **Soil Testing:** This is the most critical step. A soil test report from HAU or a certified lab will provide precise recommendations for your specific soil type and nutrient deficiencies. Haryana soils can vary significantly in pH and nutrient status.
*   **Micronutrients:** Sapota often requires micronutrients like Zinc, Iron, Manganese, and Boron, especially in alkaline soils common in Haryana. Based on soil test results, apply micronutrient mixtures or specific micronutrient fertilizers (e.g., Zinc Sulphate, Ferrous Sulphate) as recommended.
*   **Organic Manures:** Supplementing chemical fertilizers with 20-50 kg of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost per tree per year is highly beneficial for soil health and nutrient availability.
*   **Water Management:** Efficient irrigation is essential for nutrient uptake. Ensure proper soil moisture, especially during critical growth stages.
