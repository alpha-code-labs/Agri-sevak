As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend a scientifically sound approach to address macro-nutrient deficiencies (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium) in Sapota (Manilkara zapota). The most crucial first step is always a **soil test** to accurately determine the existing nutrient levels in your specific field. This will allow for precise and efficient fertilizer application.

However, based on common deficiency symptoms and general recommendations for Sapota cultivation in Haryana, here's how to address these macro-nutrient deficiencies:

**General Guidelines for Nutrient Application in Sapota:**

*   **Soil Testing:** Conduct a soil test every 2-3 years. This is the most reliable method to determine the exact nutrient status and pH of your soil, guiding precise fertilizer recommendations.
*   **Application Timing:** For bearing trees, apply fertilizers in two split doses:
    *   **First Dose:** During May-June (pre-monsoon).
    *   **Second Dose:** During September-October (post-monsoon).
*   **Application Method:** Apply fertilizers in a ring around the tree, 30-60 cm away from the trunk, within the drip line. Mix the fertilizer thoroughly with the soil and ensure proper irrigation immediately after application to facilitate nutrient uptake.
*   **Organic Matter:** Supplement chemical fertilizers with well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost (10-20 kg per tree for young trees, 50-100 kg for bearing trees annually) to improve soil health and nutrient availability.

**1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency:**

*   **Symptoms:** General yellowing (chlorosis) of older leaves, stunted growth, reduced shoot development, poor flowering, and smaller fruits. Leaves may appear pale green to yellow.
*   **Recommended Fertilizers and Dosage (per tree per year):**
    *   **Young trees (1-3 years):** 100-300 g of **Urea** (46% N) or 200-600 g of **Calcium Ammonium Nitrate** (25% N).
    *   **Bearing trees (4+ years):** 500-1000 g of **Urea** (46% N) or 1000-2000 g of **Calcium Ammonium Nitrate** (25% N).
    *   *Note:* If using **Di-Ammonium Phosphate** (DAP), account for its nitrogen content (18% N) when calculating the total nitrogen requirement.
*   **Application:** Apply in two equal split doses as per the general guidelines.

**2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency:**

*   **Symptoms:** Dark green or purplish discoloration of older leaves, stunted root growth, delayed maturity, poor flowering, and reduced fruit development. Leaves may appear stiff and brittle.
*   **Recommended Fertilizers and Dosage (per tree per year, based on P2O5):**
    *   **Young trees (1-3 years):** 150-300 g of **Single Super Phosphate** (16% P2O5) or 60-120 g of **Di-Ammonium Phosphate** (46% P2O5).
    *   **Bearing trees (4+ years):** 500-1000 g of **Single Super Phosphate** (16% P2O5) or 200-400 g of **Di-Ammonium Phosphate** (46% P2O5).
*   **Application:** Phosphorus is less mobile in soil. It is often recommended to apply the full annual dose at once, preferably during the pre-monsoon period, and incorporate it well into the soil.

**3. Potassium (K) Deficiency:**

*   **Symptoms:** Yellowing and browning (scorching) of leaf margins and tips, especially on older leaves. Reduced fruit size, poor fruit quality, and increased susceptibility to pests and diseases.
*   **Recommended Fertilizers and Dosage (per tree per year, based on K2O):**
    *   **Young trees (1-3 years):** 50-100 g of **Muriate of Potash** (Potassium Chloride, 60% K2O) or 60-120 g of **Sulphate of Potash** (Potassium Sulphate, 50% K2O).
    *   **Bearing trees (4+ years):** 250-500 g of **Muriate of Potash** (Potassium Chloride, 60% K2O) or 300-600 g of **Sulphate of Potash** (Potassium Sulphate, 50% K2O).
*   **Application:** Apply in two equal split doses as per the general guidelines.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Always strive for balanced nutrition. Excessive application of one nutrient can lead to imbalances and induce deficiencies of other nutrients.
*   **Irrigation:** Ensure adequate and timely irrigation, especially after fertilizer application, to help dissolve and move nutrients into the root zone for uptake.
*   **Foliar Application:** For quick correction of mild deficiencies, water-soluble NPK fertilizers can be applied as foliar sprays. However, soil application is generally more effective for macro-nutrients.

Always consult your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts with your soil test report for tailored recommendations specific to your farm conditions.
