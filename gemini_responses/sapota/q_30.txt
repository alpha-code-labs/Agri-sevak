As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend the following scientifically verified strategies for managing growth issues in Sapota (Manilkara zapota), keeping in mind the agro-climatic conditions of Haryana:

### 1. Slow Growth

Slow growth in Sapota is often indicative of underlying stress or nutritional deficiencies.

*   **Soil Health and Nutrition:**
    *   Conduct a comprehensive soil test to determine nutrient status and pH.
    *   Based on soil test results, apply balanced fertilizers. For general slow growth, ensure adequate supply of macronutrients (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium) and micronutrients.
    *   Incorporate well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost at 10-15 kg per tree annually to improve soil structure and nutrient availability.
    *   **Chemicals (as per soil test):**
        *   For Nitrogen deficiency: Apply **Urea** (46% N) at 100-200 g per tree, split into 2-3 applications.
        *   For Phosphorus deficiency: Apply **Single Super Phosphate** (SSP, 16% P2O5) at 200-400 g per tree.
        *   For Potassium deficiency: Apply **Muriate of Potash** (MOP, 60% K2O) at 100-200 g per tree.
        *   For general micronutrient boost: Foliar spray of a commercial micronutrient mixture containing **Zinc sulfate**, **Ferrous sulfate**, **Manganese sulfate**, and **Borax** (for Boron) at recommended concentrations (e.g., 0.5% solution).
*   **Water Management:**
    *   Ensure consistent and adequate irrigation, especially during dry periods and fruit development stages. Avoid both water stress and waterlogging.
*   **Pruning:**
    *   Remove dead, diseased, or crossing branches to improve air circulation and direct energy towards healthy growth. Light pruning can stimulate new vegetative flushes.
*   **Growth Promoters (Use judiciously):**
    *   If nutrient deficiencies and cultural practices are addressed and growth is still very slow, a foliar spray of **Gibberellic acid** (GA3) at 25-50 ppm (25-50 mg/L) can be applied during active growth phases to promote vegetative growth.

### 2. Yellow Growth (Chlorosis)

Yellowing of leaves (chlorosis) is typically a symptom of nutrient deficiency, often exacerbated by high soil pH common in parts of Haryana.

*   **Identify Specific Deficiency:**
    *   **Nitrogen (N) deficiency:** General yellowing of older leaves.
    *   **Iron (Fe) deficiency:** Interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins, veins remain green) on younger leaves.
    *   **Zinc (Zn) deficiency:** Small, narrow, yellowish leaves, often with rosetting (shortened internodes).
    *   **Manganese (Mn) deficiency:** Similar to iron, but often more mottled, on younger leaves.
    *   **Magnesium (Mg) deficiency:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, starting from margins.
*   **Management based on deficiency:**
    *   **For Nitrogen deficiency:** Foliar spray of **Urea** (2% solution, 20 g/L) or soil application as mentioned above.
    *   **For Iron deficiency:** Foliar spray of **Ferrous sulfate** (0.5% solution, 5 g/L) or soil application of **Ferrous sulfate** at 50-100 g per tree. In alkaline soils, chelated forms like **Fe-EDTA** (0.1% solution, 1 g/L) are more effective as foliar sprays.
    *   **For Zinc deficiency:** Foliar spray of **Zinc sulfate** (0.5% solution, 5 g/L) or soil application of **Zinc sulfate** at 50-100 g per tree. Chelated forms like **Zn-EDTA** (0.1% solution, 1 g/L) can also be used as foliar sprays.
    *   **For Manganese deficiency:** Foliar spray of **Manganese sulfate** (0.5% solution, 5 g/L).
    *   **For Magnesium deficiency:** Foliar spray of **Magnesium sulfate** (1% solution, 10 g/L).
*   **Soil pH Correction:**
    *   If high soil pH is locking up micronutrients, incorporate organic matter (FYM, compost) regularly. In severe cases, application of **Sulfur** (elemental sulfur) at 250-500 g per tree can help lower pH gradually over time.

### 3. Excessive Height

Excessive vegetative growth and height can make cultural operations difficult and reduce fruit production.

*   **Pruning and Training:**
    *   Regular pruning is essential to maintain a manageable tree height and open canopy.
    *   Perform heading back cuts on main branches to control vertical growth and encourage lateral branching.
    *   Remove water sprouts and suckers regularly.
*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Avoid excessive application of Nitrogen fertilizers, which promote vegetative growth.
    *   Ensure a balanced NPK ratio, with relatively higher Phosphorus and Potassium to encourage reproductive growth over vegetative growth.
*   **Plant Growth Regulators:**
    *   To effectively control excessive height and promote flowering/fruiting, apply **Paclobutrazol**.
    *   **Paclobutrazol** (23% SC formulation) can be applied as a soil drench around the tree base. The dosage varies with tree age and size, typically ranging from 2.5-10 ml active ingredient per tree. For a 5-10 year old tree, a common recommendation is 5-10 ml of the 23% SC formulation diluted in 5-10 litres of water, applied during September-October to induce flowering in the subsequent season. Always follow manufacturer's specific instructions and CIBRC guidelines for dosage and timing.

### 4. Excessive Flowering

While generally not a major problem in Sapota, excessive flowering can sometimes lead to overbearing, resulting in smaller fruits or poor fruit quality if not managed. Sapota trees usually exhibit natural flower and fruit drop.

*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Ensure balanced nutrition to support both flowering and subsequent fruit development. Deficiencies or excesses can sometimes trigger stress-induced flowering.
*   **Water Management:**
    *   Maintain consistent soil moisture. Severe drought stress can sometimes induce heavy flowering as a survival mechanism.
*   **Thinning (if leading to overbearing):**
    *   If excessive flowering leads to an extremely heavy fruit set that the tree cannot sustain, resulting in small, poor-quality fruits, manual fruit thinning may be considered after fruit set. This is more common than flower thinning in Sapota.
*   **Chemical Thinning (Rarely recommended for Sapota flowers):**
    *   Chemical thinning of flowers is generally not a standard practice for Sapota as the tree naturally sheds excess flowers and fruits. If absolutely necessary due to severe overbearing potential, **Naphthalene acetic acid** (NAA) at very low concentrations (e.g., 10-20 ppm, 10-20 mg/L) can be explored, but this requires careful calibration and is not routinely advised for Sapota flowers due to potential for over-thinning or adverse effects. Focus on cultural practices first.

Always remember to consult with local agricultural extension specialists for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and to ensure compliance with the latest CIBRC guidelines.
