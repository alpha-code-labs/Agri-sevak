As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend the following scientifically verified seed and soil treatment processes for Sapota (Manilkara zapota) cultivation in Haryana.

**I. Seed Treatment Process for Sapota**

While Sapota is primarily propagated vegetatively (grafting, budding) for commercial orchards to ensure true-to-type plants and early fruiting, seeds are used for raising rootstock. If you are using seeds for rootstock, the following treatment is recommended to protect against seed-borne and soil-borne pathogens, especially damping-off disease during germination.

1.  **Fungicidal Seed Treatment:**
    *   Mix the Sapota seeds with a fungicide before sowing.
    *   **Option 1 (Chemical):** Treat seeds with **Carbendazim** 50% WP at a rate of **2 grams per kilogram of seeds**.
    *   **Option 2 (Combination Chemical):** Treat seeds with a combination product of **Carbendazim** 12% + **Mancozeb** 63% WP at a rate of **2.5 grams per kilogram of seeds**.
    *   **Option 3 (Bio-fungicide):** Treat seeds with **Trichoderma viride** (a bio-fungicide) at a rate of **4 grams per kilogram of seeds**.
    *   **Process:** Place the required amount of seeds in a container, add the fungicide, and shake vigorously or mix thoroughly until the seeds are uniformly coated. Allow the seeds to dry in the shade before sowing.

**II. Soil Treatment Process for Sapota**

Soil treatment is crucial both before planting and for maintaining established orchards to manage soil-borne diseases, pests, and improve soil health.

**A. Pre-Planting Soil Treatment (Pit Treatment)**

Before planting Sapota grafts/budded plants, prepare the pits (typically 1m x 1m x 1m) and treat the soil to ensure a healthy start.

1.  **Bio-Fungicide and Bio-Nematicide Application:**
    *   Mix **50 grams of Trichoderma viride** and **50 grams of Purpureocillium lilacinum** (a bio-nematicide) with **10-15 kg of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM)** or compost.
    *   Incorporate this mixture thoroughly into the soil used to refill each planting pit. This helps suppress soil-borne fungal diseases and nematodes.

2.  **Termite Management (if known to be an issue):**
    *   If termites are a known problem in the area, drench the planting pit with an insecticide solution before refilling.
    *   Drench the pit with **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at a concentration of **2.5 ml per litre of water**. Use approximately **5-10 litres of this solution per pit**, ensuring the pit soil is thoroughly wetted.

**B. Post-Planting / Established Orchard Soil Treatment**

For existing Sapota trees, regular soil treatments can help manage pests and diseases and promote tree health.

1.  **General Soil Health and Disease Suppression:**
    *   **Bio-Fungicide Application:** Apply **Trichoderma viride** at a rate of **2.5 kg per acre**, mixed with **50-100 kg of FYM** or compost. Spread this mixture evenly around the base of the trees within the drip line and lightly incorporate it into the soil. This should be done annually, preferably during monsoon or post-monsoon.
    *   **Bio-Nematicide Application:** If nematodes are a concern, apply **Purpureocillium lilacinum** at a rate of **2.5 kg per acre**, mixed with **50-100 kg of FYM** or compost, similar to the Trichoderma application.

2.  **Termite Control:**
    *   If termite activity is observed around the base of the trees or in the soil, drench the affected area.
    *   Drench the soil around the tree base with **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at a concentration of **2.5 ml per litre of water**. Apply **5-10 litres of solution per tree**, depending on the tree size and severity of infestation.
    *   Alternatively, apply **Fipronil** 0.3% G (granules) at a rate of **20-30 kg per acre** by broadcasting it around the tree base and lightly incorporating it into the soil, followed by irrigation.

3.  **Root Rot Management (if observed):**
    *   If symptoms of root rot (e.g., yellowing, wilting, decline) are observed, drench the soil around the affected tree.
    *   Drench the soil with **Carbendazim** 50% WP at a rate of **2 grams per litre of water**. Apply **5-10 litres of solution per tree** to the root zone.
    *   Alternatively, for specific root rot pathogens like Phytophthora, drench with **Propamocarb hydrochloride** 72.2% SL at a rate of **2.5 ml per litre of water**.

Always ensure proper safety measures, including wearing gloves and protective clothing, when handling chemicals. Follow the instructions on the product label for specific application rates and safety precautions.
