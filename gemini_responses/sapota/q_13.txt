As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing these pests in Sapota (Chikoo) in Haryana.

**Regarding Ber Fly (*Carpomyia vesuviana*)**

This is not known to affect Sapota. The Ber fly is a specific pest primarily affecting Ber (*Ziziphus mauritiana*) fruits.

**Regarding Fruit Fly (*Bactrocera spp.*) in Sapota**

Fruit flies, particularly species like *Bactrocera dorsalis* (Oriental fruit fly), are significant pests of Sapota. Effective management requires an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach.

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**

*   **Orchard Sanitation:** This is the most critical step. Regularly collect and destroy all fallen, infested, or damaged fruits by burying them deep (at least 60 cm) or burning them. This breaks the life cycle of the pest.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** After harvest, deep ploughing around the trees can expose and kill pupae in the soil.
*   **Bagging Fruits:** For small-scale orchards or high-value fruits, individual fruit bagging (using paper or cloth bags) can prevent egg-laying by fruit flies.

**2. Monitoring and Mass Trapping:**

*   **Pheromone Traps (Methyl Eugenol Traps):** Install male annihilation traps containing methyl eugenol lure (a powerful attractant for male fruit flies) at a density of 10-15 traps per acre.
    *   Replace the lure every 2-3 weeks.
    *   These traps help monitor the population and also reduce the male population, thereby disrupting mating.

**3. Bait Sprays:**

*   Bait sprays are highly effective and reduce the amount of insecticide applied to the entire tree. They attract and kill fruit flies.
*   Prepare a bait solution using a protein source (e.g., protein hydrolysate or jaggery) mixed with an insecticide.
*   **Recipe:** Mix 20 g of protein hydrolysate or 100 g of jaggery per litre of water. To this, add one of the following CIBRC approved insecticides:
    *   **Malathion 50% EC:** 2 ml/L of water.
    *   **Deltamethrin 2.8% EC:** 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Spinosad 45% SC:** 0.16 ml/L of water.
*   **Application:** Apply this bait solution as small spots (about 1 square meter) on the tree trunk or on non-bearing branches, preferably in the morning. Do not spray the entire canopy.
*   Repeat application every 7-10 days, especially during fruit development and ripening stages.

**4. Chemical Control (as a last resort and if infestation is severe):**

*   If the infestation is very high and other methods are insufficient, targeted insecticidal sprays may be necessary. Always adhere to the recommended dosage and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   **Recommended CIBRC approved insecticides:**
    *   **Malathion 50% EC:** 1.0 - 1.5 ml/L of water (or 1.0 - 1.5 L per acre in 500-600 L of water).
    *   **Deltamethrin 2.8% EC:** 0.5 ml/L of water (or 200 ml per acre in 400 L of water).
    *   **Spinosad 45% SC:** 0.16 ml/L of water (or 60-75 ml per acre in 400-500 L of water).
*   **Timing:** Apply sprays when fruits are developing and susceptible to attack, but ensure to observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) to avoid residues in harvested fruits. Consult the product label for specific PHI.
*   **Application:** Ensure thorough coverage of the fruit-bearing canopy.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always check the label of the chosen insecticide for the specific PHI and strictly adhere to it to ensure fruit safety.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) while handling and applying pesticides. Follow all safety instructions on the product label.
