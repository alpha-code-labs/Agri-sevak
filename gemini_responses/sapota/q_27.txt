As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the suitable climate, soil type, and drainage requirements for Sapota (Chikoo) cultivation in Haryana:

### Suitable Climate for Sapota

Sapota is a tropical fruit and thrives best in warm and humid conditions.

*   **Temperature:** It prefers a temperature range of 11°C to 34°C. Temperatures below 0°C (frost) are detrimental, especially to young plants, and can cause severe damage or even death. High temperatures coupled with dry winds can also affect fruit set and development.
*   **Humidity:** High humidity is favorable for its growth and fruit development.
*   **Rainfall:** An annual rainfall of 1200-2500 mm is ideal, but it can tolerate drier conditions if irrigation is provided. It is relatively drought-tolerant once established but requires adequate water during flowering and fruiting.
*   **Sunlight:** Requires full sun exposure for optimal growth and fruit production.

### Suitable Soil Type for Sapota

Sapota is adaptable to a wide range of soils but performs best in specific types.

*   **Texture:** Deep, well-drained, sandy loam to clay loam soils are most suitable. It can also grow in sandy soils and lateritic soils, provided they have good fertility and drainage.
*   **Depth:** The soil should be deep (at least 1.5 to 2 meters) to allow for extensive root development.
*   **pH:** A soil pH range of 6.0 to 8.0 is considered ideal. It can tolerate slightly alkaline and saline conditions better than many other fruit crops, but extreme conditions should be avoided.
*   **Organic Matter:** Soils rich in organic matter promote vigorous growth and higher yields.

### Drainage Requirement for Sapota

Proper drainage is critical for Sapota cultivation.

*   **Waterlogging:** Sapota plants are highly sensitive to waterlogging. They cannot tolerate standing water around their root zone for extended periods, as this leads to root rot, poor growth, and eventually plant death.
*   **Internal Drainage:** The soil must have excellent internal drainage to ensure that excess water percolates away quickly.
*   **Surface Drainage:** In areas prone to heavy rainfall or irrigation, good surface drainage is also essential to prevent water accumulation. Raised beds or proper land leveling can be beneficial in such situations.
