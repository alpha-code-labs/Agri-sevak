As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I must emphasize that there is no direct chemical cure for established viral infections in plants. The primary strategy for managing viral diseases in perennial crops like Sapota (Chikoo) focuses on prevention, vector control, and cultural practices.

Regarding the specific viruses mentioned:

*   **Tristeza virus is not known to affect Sapota.** It is primarily a disease of citrus.
*   **Stripe virus is not known to affect Sapota.** This term is more commonly associated with diseases in cereal crops.

For viral diseases that can cause symptoms like leaf curl, mosaic, yellow vein clearing, and stunting in Sapota, the control measures are largely indirect and focus on managing the spread of the virus. These symptoms are often caused by various viruses transmitted by insect vectors.

Here's a comprehensive approach to control viral diseases in Sapota:

**I. Cultural and Horticultural Practices (Prevention is Key):**

1.  **Use Healthy Planting Material:** Always source saplings from certified nurseries that guarantee virus-free stock. This is the most critical step.
2.  **Rogueing of Infected Plants:** Immediately remove and destroy (burn or bury deep) any plants showing clear symptoms of viral infection (stunting, severe mosaic, leaf distortion, yellowing). This prevents the virus from spreading to healthy plants.
3.  **Vector Control:** Most plant viruses are transmitted by insect vectors such as aphids, whiteflies, leafhoppers, and thrips. Effective control of these vectors is crucial.
4.  **Weed Management:** Keep the orchard free of weeds, as many weeds can act as alternate hosts for both viruses and their insect vectors.
5.  **Sanitation:** Disinfect pruning tools with a 10% bleach solution or 70% alcohol after working on each tree, especially if viral symptoms are suspected.
6.  **Nutrient Management:** Ensure balanced fertilization and proper irrigation to maintain plant vigor, which can help trees tolerate stress better.
7.  **Avoid Intercropping Susceptible Hosts:** Do not intercrop Sapota with other crops known to be highly susceptible to common viral diseases or their vectors.

**II. Chemical Control (Vector Management):**

Since there are no viricides, chemical control focuses on managing the insect vectors that transmit the viruses. Apply insecticides when vector populations are observed or when symptoms begin to appear on a few plants, indicating vector activity. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

Here are some CIBRC approved technical chemicals for controlling common vectors in fruit crops:

*   **For Aphids, Whiteflies, and Leafhoppers:**
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: Apply at 0.5-1.0 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: Apply at 0.2-0.4 g per litre of water.
    *   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP: Apply at 0.2-0.4 g per litre of water.

*   **For Whiteflies (especially nymphs and eggs) and Mealybugs:**
    *   **Buprofezin** 25% SC: Apply at 1.25 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Spiromesifen** 22.9% SC: Apply at 0.5-0.75 ml per litre of water.

*   **For Thrips:**
    *   **Fipronil** 5% SC: Apply at 1.0-1.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Spinosad** 45% SC: Apply at 0.16 ml per litre of water.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label for specific dosages, application methods, and safety precautions.
*   Apply insecticides during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   Ensure thorough coverage of the plant, especially the undersides of leaves where many vectors reside.
*   Monitor your orchard regularly for signs of viral diseases and insect pests to enable timely intervention.

By implementing these integrated management strategies, you can significantly reduce the incidence and spread of viral diseases in your Sapota orchard.
