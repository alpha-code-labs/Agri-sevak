As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling beetles, weevils, and sawflies in Sapota (Chikoo) in Haryana:

**1. Beetles:**
While many types of beetles exist, the most significant beetle pest affecting Sapota in our region is the **Stem Borer** (*Plocaederus obesus*). General defoliating beetles are not typically a major concern for Sapota.

*   **Symptoms of Stem Borer:**
    *   Presence of boreholes on the main trunk or branches.
    *   Accumulation of frass (excreta and wood dust) near the boreholes or at the base of the tree.
    *   Wilting and drying of affected branches or the entire tree in severe cases.

*   **Control Measures for Stem Borer:**
    *   **Cultural/Mechanical Control:**
        *   Regularly inspect trees for signs of infestation.
        *   Prune and destroy severely infested branches to prevent further spread.
        *   If boreholes are visible, try to extract the grubs using a hooked wire.
    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   Injecting insecticide into the boreholes is an effective method.
        *   Inject 2-5 ml of **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** directly into each active borehole.
        *   Immediately after injection, seal the borehole with wet mud or putty to prevent the chemical from evaporating and to ensure the pest is exposed to the fumigant action.
        *   This treatment should be done carefully, ensuring proper safety measures are followed.
