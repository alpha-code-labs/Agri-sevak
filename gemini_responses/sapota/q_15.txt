As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in Sapota (Chikoo) orchards in Haryana:

### Control of Grasshopper in Sapota

Grasshoppers can cause significant defoliation, especially on young leaves and shoots, and may also feed on developing fruits.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Maintain field sanitation by removing weeds and debris that can serve as breeding grounds.
    *   Deep ploughing during off-season can expose grasshopper eggs to predators and harsh weather, reducing their population.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   For severe infestations, consider spraying with:
        *   **Malathion 50% EC**: 1.5 - 2 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC**: 2.5 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC**: 0.5 ml per litre of water.

### Control of Painted Bug in Sapota

This is not known to affect Sapota. Painted bug (Bagrada hilaris) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops like mustard, cabbage, and cauliflower.

### Control of Red Cotton Bug in Sapota

This is not known to affect Sapota. Red cotton bug (Dysdercus cingulatus) is primarily a pest of cotton and other malvaceous plants.

### Control of Black Ants in Sapota

Black ants can be a nuisance, often protecting sap-sucking pests like aphids and mealybugs, and sometimes feeding on plant exudates or even young fruits.

*   **Cultural and Physical Control:**
    *   Maintain cleanliness around the trees, removing any food sources.
    *   Apply sticky bands around the tree trunk to prevent ants from climbing up and accessing the canopy.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   For controlling ant populations, especially those tending to other pests or nesting around the tree base:
        *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC**: 2.5 ml per litre of water. This can be sprayed on ant trails, nests, or drenched around the base of the tree.
        *   **Fipronil 5% SC**: 1.5 - 2 ml per litre of water. Can be used as a spray on ant trails or around the base of the tree.
        *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL**: 0.5 ml per litre of water. Can be used as a drench around the base of the tree or sprayed on ant activity areas.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully, including dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during chemical application.
*   Apply pesticides during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   Consider Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approaches, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods for sustainable pest control.
