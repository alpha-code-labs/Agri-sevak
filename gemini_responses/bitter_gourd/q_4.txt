As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified strategies for controlling Wilt (including Parawilt) in Bitter Gourd in Haryana:

**I. Wilt (Pathogen-induced - Fungal and Bacterial)**

Wilt in bitter gourd can be caused by various pathogens, primarily fungi (e.g., *Fusarium oxysporum*) or bacteria (*Ralstonia solanacearum*). An integrated approach is essential for effective management.

**A. Cultural and Agronomic Practices:**
*   **Crop Rotation:** Implement a 3-4 year crop rotation with non-cucurbit crops (e.g., cereals, pulses) to reduce the build-up of soil-borne pathogens.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available and suitable for Haryana's agro-climatic conditions, select and use wilt-resistant or tolerant bitter gourd varieties. Consult HAU for specific recommendations.
*   **Soil Solarization:** During the hot summer months (May-June), prepare the field, moisten the soil, and cover it with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks. This helps to reduce the inoculum of soil-borne pathogens.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Promptly identify, remove, and destroy infected plants along with their root systems to prevent further spread of the disease.
*   **Proper Drainage:** Ensure good field drainage to avoid waterlogging, which can stress plants and create conditions favorable for pathogen development.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced fertilization based on soil test reports to promote vigorous plant growth and enhance natural resistance. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can make plants more susceptible.
*   **Avoid Root Injury:** Minimize root damage during intercultural operations (e.g., weeding, hoeing), as wounds can serve as entry points for pathogens.

**B. Biological Control:**
*   **Seed Treatment:** Treat bitter gourd seeds with bio-control agents before sowing.
    *   **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum**: 4-5 g/kg seed.
    *   **Pseudomonas fluorescens**: 10 g/kg seed.
*   **Soil Application:** Apply bio-control agents to the soil at the time of planting or as a drench.
    *   **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum**: 2.5 kg/acre mixed with 50 kg of well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost, applied before planting or as a drench around the root zone.
    *   **Pseudomonas fluorescens**: 2.5 kg/acre mixed with 50 kg of FYM or compost.

**C. Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved Technical Chemicals):**
*   **For Fungal Wilt (e.g., Fusarium Wilt):**
    *   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds before sowing.
        *   **Carbendazim**: 1-2 g/kg seed.
        *   **Thiram**: 2-3 g/kg seed.
    *   **Soil Drench:** At the first sign of disease, drench the soil around the base of affected plants.
        *   **Carbendazim**: 1 g/L of water. Apply 200-250 ml of this solution per plant. Repeat after 10-15 days if necessary, based on disease severity.
*   **For Bacterial Wilt:**
    *   Chemical control is generally less effective once bacterial wilt is well-established. Focus on preventive measures.
    *   **Soil Drench (Preventive/Early Stage):**
        *   **Streptomycin sulphate** (90%) + **Tetracycline hydrochloride** (10%) mixture: 0.5 g/L of water. Apply 200-250 ml of this solution per plant as a preventive measure or at very early stages of disease appearance.

**II. Parawilt (Physiological Disorder)**

Parawilt is a non-pathogenic condition in bitter gourd, often triggered by sudden environmental stresses, particularly related to extreme fluctuations in soil moisture, high temperatures, or root damage. It is not caused by a pathogen.

**Management Strategies:**
*   **Consistent Soil Moisture:** Maintain uniform soil moisture levels. Avoid both waterlogging (excessive moisture) and severe drought stress (lack of moisture). Implement regular, light irrigation, especially during critical growth stages and dry periods.
*   **Mulching:** Apply organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves, crop residues) around the base of plants. This helps conserve soil moisture, regulate soil temperature, suppress weeds, and reduce soil erosion.
*   **Improve Soil Organic Matter:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost into the soil during field preparation. This improves soil structure, water-holding capacity, and overall soil health, making plants more resilient to environmental stresses.
*   **Avoid Root Disturbance:** Exercise caution during weeding and other intercultural operations to prevent damage to the root system, as root injury can predispose plants to parawilt.
*   **Shade Nets (in extreme heat):** In areas experiencing very high temperatures during the growing season, temporary use of shade nets can help reduce heat stress on plants, thereby mitigating parawilt incidence.

An integrated approach combining these cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods is most effective for comprehensive management of both wilt and parawilt in bitter gourd. Regular field monitoring is crucial for early detection and timely intervention.
