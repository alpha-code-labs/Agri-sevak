Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU), Hisar, I understand the challenges posed by mites in Bitter Gourd cultivation. Both Red spider mite (*Tetranychus urticae*) and Rust mites (Eriophyid mites) can cause significant damage if not managed effectively. Here is a scientifically verified approach for their control:

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Mites in Bitter Gourd:**

1.  **Regular Monitoring:** Frequently inspect the underside of leaves, especially during dry and warm weather, for the presence of mites, their webs (for red spider mites), or characteristic bronzing/rusting symptoms (for rust mites). Early detection is key.
2.  **Water Management:** Maintain adequate soil moisture. Overhead irrigation or frequent sprinkling can help dislodge mites and increase humidity, which is unfavorable for spider mites.
3.  **Weed Control:** Remove weeds in and around the bitter gourd field, as many weeds can act as alternate hosts for mites.
4.  **Pruning:** Remove severely infested leaves or plant parts to reduce the mite population.
5.  **Biological Control:** Encourage natural enemies like predatory mites (e.g., *Amblyseius* species), ladybird beetles, and lacewings, which feed on pest mites. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

**Chemical Control (Acaricides):**

When mite populations reach damaging levels, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always ensure thorough coverage, especially on the underside of leaves where mites reside. Rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

For effective control of Red spider mite and Rust mite, consider the following CIBRC approved acaricides:

*   **For Red Spider Mite:**
    *   **Spiromesifen** 240 SC: Apply at 0.5 - 0.75 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Fenpyroximate** 5 EC: Apply at 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Propargite** 57 EC: Apply at 2.0 - 2.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Abamectin** 1.9 EC: Apply at 0.4 - 0.5 ml per litre of water.

*   **For Rust Mite (and also effective against Red Spider Mite):**
    *   **Wettable Sulphur** 80 WP: Apply at 2.0 - 3.0 grams per litre of water. Sulphur is particularly effective against eriophyid mites (rust mites) and also helps in controlling powdery mildew.
    *   **Fenazaquin** 10 EC: Apply at 0.5 ml per litre of water.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Spray Volume:** Ensure sufficient spray volume (typically 400-500 litres per acre, depending on crop canopy) to achieve thorough coverage of the foliage, especially the undersides of leaves.
*   **Rotation:** Always rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in mite populations.
*   **Safety:** Always read and follow the instructions on the product label, including dosage, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and safety precautions. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during application.
*   **Repeat Application:** Mite control often requires repeat applications at recommended intervals (e.g., 7-10 days) to target newly hatched mites, especially during severe infestations.

By combining these cultural, biological, and chemical methods, you can effectively manage mite populations in your Bitter Gourd crop.
