As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in Bitter Gourd in Haryana:

### Control of Fruit Fly (*Bactrocera cucurbitae*) in Bitter Gourd

Fruit fly is a major pest of Bitter Gourd, causing significant damage by laying eggs in developing fruits, leading to rotting and premature fruit drop. An Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is recommended for effective control.

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Regularly collect and destroy all fallen, damaged, and infested fruits. Bury them deep in the soil (at least 60 cm) or immerse them in water to prevent adult emergence.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** After harvest, deep ploughing of the field helps expose and destroy pupae present in the soil.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting cucurbit crops in successive seasons in the same field.

**2. Mechanical/Physical Methods:**
*   **Fruit Bagging:** For small-scale cultivation, individual fruits can be covered with paper or cloth bags once they start developing to prevent the female fly from laying eggs.
*   **Pheromone Traps:** Install Cue-lure traps at a density of 4-5 traps per acre to monitor and mass trap male fruit flies. Replace the lures every 2-3 weeks.
*   **Protein Bait Sprays:** Prepare a bait by mixing 100 g of jaggery or molasses with 1 litre of water and adding an insecticide. Apply this mixture as spots on leaves (not as a full cover spray) at 7-10 day intervals, especially during the fruit development stage.

**3. Chemical Control (as part of bait sprays or direct sprays):**
For bait sprays, mix one of the following CIBRC approved insecticides with the jaggery/molasses solution (10 g jaggery/molasses per litre of water):
*   **Malathion** 50% EC at 2 ml/L of water.
*   **Spinosad** 45% SC at 0.25 ml/L of water.

*Note: Apply these bait sprays as spot applications on leaves, targeting areas where fruit flies are likely to feed, rather than a full cover spray.*

In cases of severe infestation, a full cover spray might be considered, ensuring to observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) for any chemical application:
*   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 0.5 ml/L of water.
*   **Deltamethrin** 2.8% EC at 0.5 ml/L of water.

### Control of Ber Fly (*Carpomyia vesuviana*) in Bitter Gourd

This is not known to affect Bitter Gourd. The Ber fly (*Carpomyia vesuviana*) is a specific pest of Ber (*Ziziphus mauritiana*) fruits and does not infest cucurbit crops like Bitter Gourd.
