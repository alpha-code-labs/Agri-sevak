As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), here is the scientifically verified advice regarding the maturity signs, harvesting time, and cutting process for Bitter Gourd (Karela) in Haryana:

### Maturity Signs for Bitter Gourd

Bitter gourd fruits should be harvested at an immature stage before they start to ripen and turn yellow. Key maturity signs include:

*   **Size:** The fruit should have attained the characteristic size and shape for the specific variety being grown (e.g., long, short, thick, thin).
*   **Colour:** The fruit should exhibit a uniform, bright green colour. Avoid fruits that show any signs of yellowing, as this indicates over-maturity and a decline in quality and bitterness.
*   **Texture:** The fruit should be firm and crisp to the touch.
*   **Surface:** The characteristic warts or ridges on the fruit surface should be well-developed and prominent.
*   **Seed Development:** At the ideal harvesting stage, the seeds inside should be small, soft, and white. If seeds are large, hard, and reddish, the fruit is over-mature.

### Harvesting Time for Bitter Gourd

Timely harvesting is crucial for maintaining fruit quality and ensuring continuous yield.

*   **First Harvest:** Harvesting typically begins 60-70 days after sowing, or approximately 15-20 days after fruit set (pollination).
*   **Harvesting Frequency:** Fruits should be harvested frequently, usually every 2-3 days, or even daily during peak production periods, especially in hot weather. This encourages the plant to produce more fruits and prevents fruits from becoming over-mature.
*   **Time of Day:** It is best to harvest bitter gourd in the early morning hours. This helps to retain the fruit's turgidity, freshness, and extends its shelf life.

### Cutting Process for Bitter Gourd

Proper cutting technique is essential to prevent damage to both the fruit and the vine, ensuring sustained production.

*   **Tools:** Use a sharp knife, pruning shears, or secateurs. This ensures a clean cut and minimizes damage.
*   **Method:**
    *   Locate the pedicel (fruit stalk) where it attaches to the main vine or branch.
    *   Cut the pedicel cleanly, leaving a small portion (about 1-2 cm) attached to the fruit. This helps to prevent rot and maintain freshness.
    *   Avoid pulling or twisting the fruit off the vine, as this can damage the plant, leading to wounds that can be entry points for diseases and reduce future yields.
*   **Handling:** Handle the harvested fruits gently to prevent bruising, which can reduce marketability and shelf life. Place them carefully into clean containers.
