As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following cultivation practices for Bitter Gourd in Haryana:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   Bitter Gourd is primarily propagated by direct seeding.
    *   Sowing is typically done on ridges or raised beds to ensure proper drainage and aeration, especially during the monsoon season.
    *   For commercial cultivation, a pit method or furrow method is often employed. Pits of 30 cm diameter and 30 cm depth are prepared, and 2-3 seeds are sown per pit.
    *   Trellising (providing support for vines to climb) is highly recommended for better yield, fruit quality, and ease of harvesting. This can be done using bamboo stakes, wires, or nylon nets.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   Seeds should be sown at a depth of **2-3 cm**. Deeper sowing can hinder germination.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   Spacing recommendations vary slightly based on the variety (vining habit) and whether trellising is adopted.
    *   **For Trellised Cultivation:**
        *   Row-to-row spacing: **1.5 - 2.5 meters**
        *   Plant-to-plant spacing: **0.6 - 1.0 meter**
    *   **For Bushy/Ground Cultivation (less common for commercial production):**
        *   Row-to-row spacing: **1.5 - 2.0 meters**
        *   Plant-to-plant spacing: **0.9 - 1.2 meters**
    *   Thinning should be done after germination to maintain 1-2 healthy plants per pit/hill.

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   The recommended seed dose for Bitter Gourd is typically **3-5 kg per acre** for open-pollinated varieties.
    *   For hybrid varieties, the seed rate might be slightly lower, around **1.5-2.5 kg per acre**, due to higher germination percentage and vigor.
