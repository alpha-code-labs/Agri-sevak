As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling rust diseases in Bitter Gourd in Haryana.

Regarding Black, Brown, Yellow, and Red rusts:
*   This is not known to affect Bitter Gourd. These specific types of rust are primarily associated with other crops like cereals and are not significant diseases of Bitter Gourd.

However, Bitter Gourd is susceptible to White Rust, caused by *Albugo* species. Here's how to control White Rust:

**Symptoms of White Rust:**
*   White, shiny, raised pustules primarily on the underside of leaves.
*   Corresponding yellow spots on the upper surface of leaves.
*   In severe cases, pustules can also appear on stems, petioles, and fruits, leading to distortion and reduced yield.

**Control Measures for White Rust in Bitter Gourd:**

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Practices:**
*   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris and weeds (especially those belonging to the cucurbit family or other susceptible hosts) from and around the field to reduce inoculum sources.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-cucurbit crops for at least 2-3 years to break the disease cycle.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available, choose bitter gourd varieties known to have resistance or tolerance to White Rust.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Maintain adequate plant spacing to ensure good air circulation, which helps reduce humidity and leaf wetness, unfavorable for fungal growth.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced fertilizers. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can promote lush, susceptible growth.
*   **Irrigation Management:** Use drip irrigation instead of overhead irrigation to minimize leaf wetness. If overhead irrigation is used, do it in the morning to allow leaves to dry quickly.

**2. Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
Apply fungicides preventively or at the first sign of symptoms. Always follow label instructions for dosage, application interval, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).

*   **Mancozeb 75% WP:** Apply at a rate of 2.5 kg per acre (or 2.5-3 g per litre of water) as a foliar spray. Repeat at 7-10 day intervals if disease pressure persists.
*   **Metalaxyl 8% + Mancozeb 64% WP:** Apply at a rate of 2.5 kg per acre (or 2.5 g per litre of water) as a foliar spray. This combination provides both systemic and contact action.
*   **Propineb 70% WP:** Apply at a rate of 2.5 kg per acre (or 2.5-3 g per litre of water) as a foliar spray.
*   **Dimethomorph 9% + Mancozeb 60% WP:** Apply at a rate of 1.5-2 kg per acre (or 1.5-2 g per litre of water) as a foliar spray.
*   **Cymoxanil 8% + Mancozeb 64% WP:** Apply at a rate of 1.5-2 kg per acre (or 1.5-2 g per litre of water) as a foliar spray.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of fungicide resistance.
*   Ensure thorough coverage of both upper and lower leaf surfaces during spraying.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension officers for the most current recommendations and specific product availability in your area of Haryana.
