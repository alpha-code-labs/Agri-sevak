As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling soil pests like termites and root-knot nematodes in Bitter Gourd (Karela) in Haryana.

Both termites and root-knot nematodes are significant soil-borne pests that can severely impact bitter gourd yield and quality. An Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods, is recommended for effective and sustainable control.

### Control Measures for Termites:

Termites primarily damage roots and the base of the stem, leading to wilting and plant death.

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Methods:**
*   Ensure proper field sanitation and remove crop residues that can serve as food sources for termites.
*   Deep ploughing before planting can expose termite colonies to predators and desiccation.
*   Avoid leaving woody debris or stumps in the field.

**2. Chemical Control (Pre-planting/At planting):**
For effective control, apply CIBRC approved insecticides to the soil before or at the time of planting.
*   **Fipronil 0.3% GR:** Apply 6.6 - 10 kg per acre by broadcasting and mixing into the soil before planting, or apply in furrows at the time of planting.
*   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC:** Drench the soil around the plant base with a solution of 2.5 ml per litre of water, using approximately 2-2.5 litres of the product per acre, diluted in sufficient water. This can be done at planting or as a prophylactic measure.

### Control Measures for Root-Knot Nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.):

Root-knot nematodes cause characteristic galls or knots on the roots, impairing nutrient and water uptake, leading to stunted growth, yellowing, and reduced yield.

**1. Cultural and Biological Methods:**
*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate bitter gourd with non-host crops like cereals (e.g., maize, sorghum, wheat) for at least 2-3 years to reduce nematode populations in the soil.
*   **Summer Ploughing/Solarization:** Deep ploughing during hot summer months exposes nematodes to high temperatures and desiccation. Soil solarization (covering moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks during peak summer) can significantly reduce nematode populations.
*   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporate well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost at 10-15 tonnes per acre. Neem cake (200-400 kg per acre) can also be highly effective due to its nematicidal properties.
*   **Bio-nematicides:** Apply beneficial fungi like *Purpureocillium lilacinum* (formerly *Paecilomyces lilacinus*) or *Trichoderma harzianum* as soil application or seed treatment. Follow manufacturer's recommended dosage, typically 2-4 kg/acre for soil application.

**2. Chemical Control (Pre-planting/At planting):**
For severe infestations, CIBRC approved nematicides can be used.
*   **Fluensulfone 2% GR:** Apply 10 kg per acre by broadcasting and mixing into the soil before planting, or apply in furrows at the time of planting.
*   **Fipronil 0.3% GR:** While primarily for termites, it also offers some suppression of nematodes when applied at the recommended rates for termite control (6.6 - 10 kg per acre).

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the label instructions of any pesticide carefully, including dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and pest pressure.
