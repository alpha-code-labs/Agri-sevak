Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I understand the critical importance of balanced nutrition for optimal yield and quality in Bitter Gourd (Karela). Addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium) effectively requires a scientific approach.

**Crucial First Step: Soil Testing**
Before applying any fertilizers, it is paramount to conduct a comprehensive soil test. This provides an accurate assessment of the existing nutrient levels in your field and helps in determining the precise quantities of fertilizers required, preventing both under-application and over-application, which can be detrimental to the crop and the environment. Please contact your nearest Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or HAU extension center for soil testing services.

Based on general recommendations for Bitter Gourd cultivation in Haryana, and assuming a moderate to severe deficiency, here's how to address Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium deficiencies:

---

### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

Nitrogen is vital for vegetative growth, leaf development, and overall plant vigor.

*   **Symptoms:** General yellowing (chlorosis) of older leaves, stunted growth, reduced branching, and pale green foliage.
*   **Recommended Solutions:**
    *   **Soil Application (Basal & Top-dressing):**
        *   For basal application (at planting), a portion of nitrogen can be supplied through **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)** or **Monoammonium Phosphate (MAP)**, which also provide phosphorus.
        *   For top-dressing, apply **Urea** in splits.
        *   **Dosage Example (adjust based on soil test):** If your soil test indicates a need for 80 kg N per acre, you might apply:
            *   **Basal:** Approximately 20-25 kg N per acre, often supplied through **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (e.g., 50-60 kg **DAP** per acre, which provides ~9-11 kg N).
            *   **Top-dressing:** The remaining N (e.g., 55-60 kg N) should be applied in 2-3 splits.
                *   First split: 25-30 kg **Urea** per acre (approx. 11-14 kg N) at 3-4 weeks after planting.
                *   Second split: 25-30 kg **Urea** per acre (approx. 11-14 kg N) at flowering/early fruit set.
                *   Third split (if needed): 20-25 kg **Urea** per acre at peak fruiting.
    *   **Foliar Application (for quick correction):**
        *   For immediate relief from severe deficiency, spray a 1-2% **Urea** solution (10-20 g of **Urea** per litre of water). Apply during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to avoid leaf scorch. Repeat after 7-10 days if symptoms persist.

### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

Phosphorus is crucial for root development, flowering, fruit set, and energy transfer within the plant.

*   **Symptoms:** Dark green or purplish discoloration of older leaves, stunted growth, poor root development, delayed flowering, and reduced fruit set.
*   **Recommended Solutions:**
    *   **Soil Application (Basal):** Phosphorus is relatively immobile in the soil, so it is best applied as a basal dose at the time of planting.
        *   **Dosage Example (adjust based on soil test):** If your soil test indicates a need for 60 kg P2O5 per acre, you might apply:
            *   **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP):** Approximately 130 kg **DAP** per acre (provides 60 kg P2O5 and 23 kg N). If using DAP, adjust the basal N from Urea accordingly.
            *   **Single Super Phosphate (SSP):** Approximately 375 kg **SSP** per acre (provides 60 kg P2O5). This is a good option if only P is deficient or if sulfur is also needed.
            *   **Monoammonium Phosphate (MAP):** Approximately 115 kg **MAP** per acre (provides 60 kg P2O5 and 13 kg N).
    *   **Foliar Application:** While less effective for long-term correction, foliar sprays can provide temporary relief.
        *   Spray a 0.5-1% solution of **Monoammonium Phosphate (MAP)** (5-10 g of **MAP** per litre of water) at pre-flowering or early fruit set stages.

### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency

Potassium is essential for water regulation, disease resistance, fruit development, and overall fruit quality (size, taste, shelf-life).

*   **Symptoms:** Yellowing and browning/scorching of leaf margins (especially older leaves), weak stems, poor fruit development, and reduced disease resistance.
*   **Recommended Solutions:**
    *   **Soil Application (Basal & Top-dressing):**
        *   **Dosage Example (adjust based on soil test):** If your soil test indicates a need for 60 kg K2O per acre, you might apply:
            *   **Basal:** Approximately 30 kg K2O per acre, supplied through **Muriate of Potash (MOP)**. This would be about 50 kg **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** per acre.
            *   **Top-dressing:** The remaining 30 kg K2O per acre should be applied in 1-2 splits.
                *   First split: 25-30 kg **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** per acre at flowering.
                *   Second split: 25-30 kg **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** per acre at early fruit development.
            *   Alternatively, **Sulphate of Potash (SOP)** can be used, especially if sulfur is also deficient or in saline conditions. Approximately 60 kg **Sulphate of Potash (SOP)** per acre for 30 kg K2O.
    *   **Foliar Application (for quick correction and fruit quality):**
        *   Spray a 1-2% **Potassium Nitrate** solution (10-20 g of **Potassium Nitrate** per litre of water) at fruit development stages to improve fruit size and quality. Repeat every 10-15 days as needed.

### General Recommendations for Integrated Nutrient Management:

*   **Organic Matter:** Incorporate well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost (10-15 tonnes per acre) during land preparation. Organic matter improves soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability.
*   **Irrigation:** Ensure proper irrigation practices. Both water stress and waterlogging can hinder nutrient uptake.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Always aim for balanced nutrition. Over-application of one nutrient can induce deficiency of another.
*   **Timing:** Apply fertilizers at critical growth stages (basal, vegetative growth, flowering, fruit development) for maximum efficiency.

By following these scientifically verified guidelines and prioritizing soil testing, you can effectively manage macro-nutrient deficiencies in your Bitter Gourd crop and achieve healthy yields.
