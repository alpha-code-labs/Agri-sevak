As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following doses of organic manures for Bitter Gourd cultivation in Haryana. These recommendations are based on scientific research and best practices for enhancing soil health and crop productivity.

*   **Farm Yard Manure (FYM):**
    *   Apply 15-20 tonnes per acre of well-decomposed FYM.
    *   Incorporate it thoroughly into the soil during the final land preparation, approximately 2-3 weeks before transplanting or sowing.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   Apply 4-5 tonnes per acre.
    *   Vermicompost can be incorporated into the soil during land preparation or applied as a top-dressing around the plants during early growth stages. It can be used as a supplement to FYM or as a partial replacement, given its higher nutrient concentration.

*   **Sagarika:**
    *   Sagarika is a seaweed extract-based bio-stimulant, not a bulk manure. It enhances nutrient uptake and plant growth.
    *   **Foliar Application:** Mix **2.5-3 ml of Sagarika per litre of water** and spray at critical growth stages (e.g., vegetative growth, pre-flowering, and fruit development).
    *   **Soil Drench/Drip Application:** Apply **1-2 litres per acre** mixed with irrigation water, particularly during early growth and fruit development stages.
    *   Repeat applications 2-3 times during the crop cycle, depending on crop vigour and requirement.
