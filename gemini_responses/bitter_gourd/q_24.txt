As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following for bitter gourd cultivation in Haryana:

### Ideal Transplantation Time

Bitter gourd is a warm-season crop and thrives in the climatic conditions of Haryana during two main periods:

*   **Spring-Summer Season:**
    *   **Nursery Sowing:** January end to February.
    *   **Transplantation:** February end to March, when seedlings are 3-4 weeks old and have 2-4 true leaves.
*   **Rainy (Kharif) Season:**
    *   **Nursery Sowing:** June to July.
    *   **Transplantation:** July to August, when seedlings are 3-4 weeks old.

### Ideal Transplantation Distance

Proper spacing is crucial for good air circulation, light penetration, and ease of cultural operations, especially when trellising.

*   **Row-to-Row Distance:** 2.0 - 2.5 meters
*   **Plant-to-Plant Distance:** 60 - 90 cm

This spacing allows for optimal growth and yield, particularly when plants are trained on a trellis system.

### Transplantation Process

A well-executed transplantation process minimizes shock and ensures healthy establishment of the crop.

1.  **Nursery Raising:**
    *   Sow bitter gourd seeds in pro-trays or raised nursery beds filled with a well-drained, fertile potting mix.
    *   Sow seeds 1-2 cm deep, placing 1-2 seeds per cell/spot.
    *   Keep the nursery moist and provide adequate warmth for germination.
    *   Seedlings are ready for transplanting when they are 3-4 weeks old and have developed 2-4 true leaves.

2.  **Field Preparation:**
    *   Prepare the main field by deep ploughing and harrowing to achieve a fine, loose tilth.
    *   Incorporate 20-25 tonnes/acre of well-rotted Farmyard Manure (FYM) or compost during land preparation.
    *   Form ridges and furrows or prepare raised beds according to your irrigation method (e.g., drip irrigation or furrow irrigation).

3.  **Hardening Off:**
    *   About 7-10 days before transplanting, gradually expose the seedlings to outdoor conditions. This involves reducing watering slightly and increasing their exposure to sunlight and wind. This process helps seedlings adapt to the harsher field environment and reduces transplant shock.

4.  **Transplanting:**
    *   Choose a cool part of the day for transplanting, preferably late afternoon or evening, or on a cloudy day, to minimize stress on the seedlings.
    *   Dig holes at the recommended spacing (2.0-2.5 m row-to-row and 60-90 cm plant-to-plant).
    *   Carefully remove seedlings from the pro-trays or nursery beds, ensuring the root ball remains intact.
    *   Place each seedling gently into the prepared hole, ensuring that the soil level around the seedling is the same as it was in the nursery.
    *   Gently firm the soil around the base of each seedling to ensure good root-to-soil contact.

5.  **Post-Transplantation Care:**
    *   Immediately after transplanting, provide a light irrigation to settle the soil around the roots and reduce transplant shock.
    *   As the plants grow, provide support (stakes or a trellis system) for the vining growth habit of bitter gourd.
    *   Maintain regular irrigation, especially during dry periods, and manage weeds effectively.
