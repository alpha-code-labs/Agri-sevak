As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified seed and soil treatment processes for Bitter Gourd cultivation in Haryana to ensure healthy plant establishment and mitigate early pest and disease pressure.

### Recommended Seed Treatment for Bitter Gourd

Seed treatment is crucial for protecting germinating seeds and young seedlings from seed-borne and early soil-borne pathogens, as well as initial sucking pest attacks.

1.  **Fungicidal Seed Treatment:**
    *   To protect against damping-off, seedling blight, and other seed-borne fungal diseases.
    *   Apply one of the following:
        *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 2 grams per kilogram of seed.
        *   **Thiram** 75% WS at 2.5-3 grams per kilogram of seed.
        *   A combination of **Carbendazim** 1 gram + **Thiram** 2 grams per kilogram of seed.
        *   For specific protection against oomycete diseases (e.g., *Pythium*), use **Metalaxyl** 35% WS at 6 grams per kilogram of seed.

2.  **Insecticidal Seed Treatment:**
    *   To provide early protection against sucking pests like aphids, jassids, and whiteflies for the initial 20-30 days after germination.
    *   Apply one of the following after fungicidal treatment (or use a pre-mixed formulation if available and approved):
        *   **Imidacloprid** 70% WS at 5-7 grams per kilogram of seed.
        *   **Thiamethoxam** 30% FS at 4-5 milliliters per kilogram of seed.

**Application Method:** Mix the recommended quantity of fungicide/insecticide with a small amount of water to make a slurry. Coat the seeds uniformly with this slurry and allow them to dry in the shade before sowing.

### Recommended Soil Treatment for Bitter Gourd

Soil treatment aims to manage soil-borne diseases, nematodes, and early soil pests, creating a conducive environment for root development.

1.  **Biological Soil Treatment (Recommended for general soil health and disease/nematode suppression):**
    *   **For Fungal Diseases (e.g., damping-off, root rot, wilt) and Nematodes:**
        *   Apply **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum** (bio-fungicide) at 2.5 kilograms per acre.
        *   Apply **Purpureocillium lilacinum** (bio-nematicide) at 2.5 kilograms per acre.
    *   **Application Method:** Mix the biological agents with 50-100 kilograms of well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost. Keep the mixture moist for 7-10 days in a shaded area, then broadcast uniformly in the field and incorporate into the soil before sowing or transplanting.

2.  **Chemical Soil Treatment (If severe pest/disease pressure is anticipated or observed):**
    *   **For Soil-borne Fungal Diseases (e.g., damping-off, root rot):**
        *   Drench the soil with **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 500 grams per acre at the time of sowing/transplanting or as a preventive measure.
        *   For oomycete diseases, drench with **Propamocarb hydrochloride** 72.2% SL at 1-1.5 liters per acre.
    *   **For Nematodes (e.g., Root-knot nematodes):**
        *   Apply **Fluopyram** 34.48% SC at 625 milliliters per acre as a drench or through drip irrigation at the time of sowing/transplanting.

**Application Method:** For drenching, dissolve the recommended quantity of chemical in sufficient water and apply it around the root zone of the plants or in the planting furrows. Ensure even distribution.
