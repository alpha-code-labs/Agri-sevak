Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU), Hisar, I understand your concern regarding flower and fruit drop in Bitter Gourd. This is a common issue that can significantly impact yield.

Firstly, regarding "Tinda/Boll dropping":
*   **This is not known to affect Bitter Gourd.** Bitter Gourd (Momordica charantia) does not produce "Tinda" (which is Indian Round Gourd, *Praecitrullus fistulosus*) or "Bolls" (which are associated with cotton). The issue in Bitter Gourd is specifically flower and fruit drop.

Flower and fruit drop in Bitter Gourd can be attributed to a combination of environmental, nutritional, and physiological factors. Here's a comprehensive approach to control it:

**1. Cultural and Management Practices:**

*   **Optimal Irrigation:** Both water stress (drought) and waterlogging can lead to dropping. Maintain consistent soil moisture, especially during flowering and fruit development. Irrigate deeply but infrequently, preferably in the morning or evening.
*   **Temperature Management:** Extreme temperatures (very high or very low) can cause flower and fruit abortion.
    *   Ensure planting is done during optimal seasons for Haryana.
    *   Use mulching (e.g., straw, plastic mulch) to regulate soil temperature and conserve moisture.
*   **Pollination Enhancement:** Poor pollination is a major cause of fruit drop.
    *   Encourage natural pollinators like bees by avoiding insecticide sprays during peak flowering hours.
    *   If natural pollination is insufficient, hand pollination can be done in the early morning hours (6-9 AM) by transferring pollen from male flowers to female flowers.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:**
    *   Conduct a soil test to determine nutrient deficiencies.
    *   Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can promote vegetative growth at the expense of reproductive growth.
    *   Ensure adequate supply of Phosphorus and Potassium, which are crucial for flowering and fruiting.
*   **Pruning:** Remove old, diseased, or excessive vegetative growth to redirect the plant's energy towards fruit development and reduce competition for resources.

**2. Nutritional Sprays (Micronutrients):**

Deficiencies of certain micronutrients are directly linked to flower and fruit drop. Foliar sprays can quickly correct these deficiencies.

*   **Boron:** Essential for pollen germination, pollen tube growth, and fruit set.
    *   Spray **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (e.g., Solubor) at 1-1.5 g/L of water at the pre-flowering and early fruit set stages.
*   **Zinc:** Important for enzyme activity and hormone synthesis, which influence fruit development.
    *   Spray **Zinc sulphate** (heptahydrate) at 2-3 g/L of water, or chelated zinc at 0.5-1 g/L of water, at the vegetative growth stage and again at pre-flowering.

**3. Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs):**

Certain plant growth regulators can help prevent abscission (dropping) by influencing hormonal balance within the plant.

*   **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA):** An auxin that helps in fruit retention and prevents premature shedding.
    *   Spray **Naphthalene Acetic Acid** at a concentration of 10-20 mg/L (ppm) (i.e., 0.01-0.02 g/L) of water. Apply at the pre-flowering stage and again at the early fruit set stage (when fruits are pea-sized). Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions for all chemical products.
*   Ensure proper spray coverage for effective absorption.
*   Integrated pest and disease management is also crucial, as severe infestations can stress the plant and contribute to dropping.

By implementing these scientifically verified practices, you can significantly reduce flower and fruit drop and improve the yield of your Bitter Gourd crop.
