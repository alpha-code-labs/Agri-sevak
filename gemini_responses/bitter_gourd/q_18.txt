As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified recommendations for the use of growth regulators and micronutrients in Bitter Gourd cultivation in Haryana:

It is important to note that the use of growth regulators should be precise, as incorrect doses can lead to adverse effects. Always ensure uniform spray coverage.

*   **Ethephon** (for sex modification and increased female flowers):
    *   **Purpose:** To promote the production of female flowers, leading to an increased fruit set and higher yield.
    *   **Dose:** 0.4 ml of Ethephon 39% SL per liter of water (approximately 150 ppm active ingredient).
    *   **Timing:** Apply the first spray when the plant has 2-4 true leaves. A second spray can be given 7-10 days after the first, if needed.

*   **2,4-D (2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid):**
    *   **Recommendation:** 2,4-D is primarily a broadleaf herbicide. While it can act as an auxin at extremely low concentrations, its use as a growth regulator in sensitive crops like Bitter Gourd is generally **not recommended** by HAU due to the very narrow margin between an effective dose and a phytotoxic (damaging) dose. There is a high risk of causing severe damage to the crop. Safer and more effective alternatives like Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA) are preferred for fruit setting if an auxin is required.

*   **Boron** (as a micronutrient for fruit set and development):
    *   **Purpose:** Boron is an essential micronutrient crucial for pollen germination, pollen tube growth, fertilization, and overall fruit development. Its deficiency can lead to poor fruit set and malformed fruits.
    *   **Dose:** 1 gram of **Boric Acid** (17% Boron) per liter of water (0.1% solution).
    *   **Timing:** Apply as a foliar spray before flowering and during the early flowering stage to ensure adequate boron availability for pollination and fruit set.
