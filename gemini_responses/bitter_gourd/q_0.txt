As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Bitter Gourd in Haryana:

It is crucial to adopt an Integrated Disease Management (IDM) approach, combining cultural practices with timely and judicious application of CIBRC-approved fungicides. Always read and follow the label instructions for dosage, application method, and safety precautions.

### Control of Fungal Diseases in Bitter Gourd:

**1. Alternaria Leaf Spot (Alternaria cucumerina)**
This disease is common in Bitter Gourd, causing small, circular, water-soaked spots that enlarge and become angular with concentric rings, often surrounded by a yellow halo.
*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Use disease-free seeds.
    *   Practice crop rotation with non-cucurbit crops.
    *   Ensure proper plant spacing for good air circulation.
    *   Remove and destroy infected plant debris.
*   **Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
    *   **Mancozeb:** 2-2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Chlorothalonil:** 2 g/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin:** 0.5-1 ml/L of water.
    *   **Tebuconazole:** 0.75-1 ml/L of water.

**2. Anthracnose (Colletotrichum orbiculare)**
Anthracnose is a significant disease in Bitter Gourd, causing dark, sunken lesions on leaves, stems, and fruits. On fruits, these lesions can be circular and sunken with pinkish spore masses in humid conditions.
*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Use resistant varieties if available.
    *   Practice good field sanitation and remove infected plant parts.
    *   Avoid overhead irrigation, which can spread spores.
*   **Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
    *   **Mancozeb:** 2-2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Chlorothalonil:** 2 g/L of water.
    *   **Carbendazim:** 0.5-1 g/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin:** 0.5-1 ml/L of water.
    *   **Difenoconazole:** 0.5 ml/L of water.

**3. Blast**
This is not known to affect Bitter Gourd. Blast disease primarily affects cereal crops like rice and wheat.

**4. Blight (General Leaf Blight/Early Blight)**
In Bitter Gourd, "Blight" often refers to symptoms caused by *Alternaria* (Early Blight) or other leaf spot pathogens. The control measures are similar to those for Alternaria Leaf Spot.
*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Maintain field hygiene.
    *   Ensure balanced nutrition to improve plant vigor.
*   **Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
    *   **Mancozeb:** 2-2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Chlorothalonil:** 2 g/L of water.
    *   **Propineb:** 2-2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin:** 0.5-1 ml/L of water.

**5. Brown Spot**
"Brown spot" is a general term for various leaf spot diseases. In cucurbits, it can be caused by *Alternaria* or *Cercospora* species. Control measures are similar to those for Alternaria Leaf Spot.
*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Remove and destroy infected leaves.
    *   Avoid excessive humidity around plants.
*   **Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
    *   **Mancozeb:** 2-2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Chlorothalonil:** 2 g/L of water.
    *   **Carbendazim:** 0.5-1 g/L of water.

**6. Downy Mildew (Pseudoperonospora cubensis)**
Downy mildew is a highly destructive disease in Bitter Gourd, causing angular, yellowish spots on the upper leaf surface and purplish-grey, fuzzy growth on the lower surface.
*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Plant resistant varieties if available.
    *   Ensure good air circulation by proper spacing and pruning.
    *   Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day.
*   **Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
    *   **Mancozeb:** 2-2.5 g/L of water (as a protectant).
    *   **Propineb:** 2-2.5 g/L of water (as a protectant).
    *   **Cymoxanil + Mancozeb:** 2.5-3 g/L of water (combination product).
    *   **Fenamidone + Propamocarb:** 2-2.5 ml/L of water (combination product).
    *   **Dimethomorph + Mancozeb:** 2.5-3 g/L of water (combination product).
    *   **Fluopicolide + Propamocarb:** 1.5-2 ml/L of water (combination product).
    *   **Amectoctradin + Dimethomorph:** 1.5-2 ml/L of water (combination product).
    *   **Azoxystrobin:** 0.5-1 ml/L of water.

**7. Powdery Mildew (Podosphaera xanthii, Erysiphe cichoracearum)**
Powdery mildew is very common in Bitter Gourd, characterized by white, powdery patches on leaves, stems, and sometimes fruits, leading to reduced photosynthesis and yield.
*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Plant resistant varieties.
    *   Ensure good air circulation.
    *   Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can promote lush, susceptible growth.
*   **Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
    *   **Sulphur (Wettable Powder):** 2-3 g/L of water.
    *   **Myclobutanil:** 0.4-0.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Penconazole:** 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Hexaconazole:** 0.5-1 ml/L of water.
    *   **Tebuconazole:** 0.75-1 ml/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin:** 0.5-1 ml/L of water.

**8. Grey Mildew**
This is not known to affect Bitter Gourd. "Grey mould" caused by *Botrytis* can occur, but it is distinct from a "mildew" and typically affects fruits or senescing tissues.

**General Recommendations for Fungicide Application:**

*   **Timing:** Apply fungicides preventively or at the very first sign of disease symptoms. Early detection and intervention are key.
*   **Rotation:** Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of fungicide resistance in pathogens.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough coverage of all plant parts, especially the undersides of leaves where many fungal spores reside.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and application.
*   **Water Quality:** Use clean water for spraying.
*   **Adjuvants:** Consider using a spreading agent (sticker/spreader) to improve fungicide efficacy, especially during rainy periods.
