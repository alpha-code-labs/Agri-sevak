Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the challenges posed by sucking pests in Bitter Gourd cultivation. Effective management requires an integrated approach.

Here's a scientifically verified strategy to control Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips in Bitter Gourd:

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Approach**

1.  **Regular Monitoring:**
    *   Inspect plants regularly, especially the undersides of leaves and growing tips, for the presence of pests and their damage symptoms. Early detection is key.
    *   Use yellow sticky traps (10-15 traps per acre) to monitor adult whiteflies, aphids, and leafhoppers.

2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy weed hosts around the field, as they can harbor these pests.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid continuous cultivation of cucurbits in the same field.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush growth, making plants more attractive to sucking pests.
    *   **Water Management:** Ensure proper irrigation to avoid water stress, which can weaken plants and make them more susceptible.
    *   **Resistant Varieties:** If available and suitable for your region, choose bitter gourd varieties known for tolerance or resistance to these pests or the viruses they transmit.

3.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Conserve natural enemies like ladybird beetles, lacewings, hoverfly larvae, and parasitic wasps (e.g., *Encarsia formosa* for whiteflies). Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.
    *   Consider releasing commercially available biological control agents if pest pressure is high and conditions are suitable.

4.  **Mechanical Control:**
    *   For small infestations, especially in early stages, physically remove infested leaves or wash off aphids with a strong stream of water.
    *   Install insect-proof nets (50-mesh) over young plants or nurseries to prevent pest entry.

**Chemical Control (for Aphids, Leafhopper, Whitefly, Thrips)**

When pest populations reach economic threshold levels and other methods are insufficient, judicious use of CIBRC-approved insecticides is necessary. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development. Apply sprays preferably in the evening or early morning.

Here are some recommended technical chemicals and their dosages:

*   **For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips:**
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: 0.5 - 0.75 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: 0.2 - 0.3 g per litre of water.
    *   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP: 0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water.

*   **Specifically for Whiteflies (especially nymphs) and Thrips:**
    *   **Buprofezin** 25% SC: 1.25 - 1.5 ml per litre of water (targets nymphs and eggs, acts as an Insect Growth Regulator).
    *   **Diafenthiuron** 50% WP/SC: 1.0 - 1.25 g per litre of water (effective against whiteflies, thrips, and mites).
    *   **Fipronil** 5% SC: 1.5 - 2.0 ml per litre of water (effective against thrips, leafhoppers, and some aphids).

**Regarding Psylla:**

This is not known to affect Bitter Gourd. Psyllids are generally host-specific and are not considered a significant pest of bitter gourd (Momordica charantia).

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the insecticide label, including dosage, application method, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and application.
*   Consult your local agricultural extension officer or HAU expert for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and current pest situation.
