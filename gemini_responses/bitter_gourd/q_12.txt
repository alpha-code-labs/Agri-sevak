Dear Farmer,

Scale insects and Mealybugs are significant sucking pests that can severely affect Bitter Gourd cultivation in Haryana, leading to stunted growth, reduced yield, and sooty mold development. Effective management requires a combination of cultural, biological, and chemical approaches.

Here's how to control them:

**General Management Principles:**

1.  **Regular Monitoring:** Frequently inspect your Bitter Gourd plants, especially the undersides of leaves, stems, and fruit calyx, for early signs of infestation.
2.  **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy severely infested plant parts or entire plants to prevent further spread. Keep the field free of weeds, which can harbor pests.
3.  **Pruning:** Prune off heavily infested leaves, stems, or fruits and dispose of them properly (e.g., burying deep or burning).
4.  **Water Spray:** For mild infestations, a strong jet of water can dislodge mealybugs from plants.
5.  **Encourage Natural Enemies:** Preserve and encourage beneficial insects like ladybird beetles, lacewings, and parasitic wasps, which are natural predators and parasitoids of scale insects and mealybugs. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficials.

**Chemical Control (Use only when necessary and follow label instructions carefully):**

When infestations are severe and other methods are insufficient, chemical control may be required. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and in protected areas where these pests hide.

Here are some CIBRC-approved technical chemicals effective against both Scale insects and Mealybugs in Bitter Gourd:

*   **For Scale Insects and Mealybugs:**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at a rate of 0.5 - 0.75 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at a rate of 0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water.
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at a rate of 1.25 - 1.5 ml per litre of water. This is particularly effective against the nymphal stages of these pests.
    *   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:** Apply at a rate of 0.75 - 1 ml per litre of water. This is a systemic insecticide that moves within the plant, providing good control.
    *   **Horticultural Mineral Oil (HMO):** Apply at a rate of 10 - 20 ml per litre of water. This works by suffocating the pests. It is particularly effective against crawlers and early nymphal stages. Ensure good coverage and avoid spraying during very hot conditions.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Spray Coverage:** Ensure complete coverage of the plant, especially the undersides of leaves and stem joints, where these pests tend to congregate.
*   **Rotation:** Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) like gloves, masks, and protective clothing while handling and spraying chemicals. Follow the manufacturer's instructions regarding dosage, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and safety precautions.
*   **Timing:** Apply insecticides during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.

By adopting an integrated approach combining these methods, you can effectively manage scale insects and mealybugs in your Bitter Gourd crop.
