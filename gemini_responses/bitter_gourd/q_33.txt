As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an integrated weed management approach for Bitter Gourd, combining cultural practices with judicious use of CIBRC approved herbicides.

**Orobanche:**
This is not known to affect Bitter Gourd.

**General Weed Management (Broadleaf, Narrowleaf, Amarbail, Bathu, Congress grass, Phalaris minor):**

**1. Cultural and Manual Methods:**
*   **Field Preparation:** Thorough ploughing and harrowing before planting can significantly reduce the initial weed seed bank.
*   **Manual Weeding:** This is the most effective method, especially for parasitic weeds like Amarbail (Cuscuta) and for broadleaf weeds where selective post-emergence herbicides are limited. Perform 2-3 manual weedings at 15-20, 30-35, and 45-50 days after sowing (DAS) or as needed.
*   **Inter-cultivation:** Shallow inter-cultivation can help control young weeds between rows.
*   **Mulching:** Using organic mulches (e.g., straw, dry leaves) or plastic mulches can effectively suppress weed growth, conserve soil moisture, and regulate soil temperature.

**2. Chemical Control (Herbicides):**

**A. Pre-emergence Herbicides (Applied before crop and weed emergence):**
These herbicides provide initial control of germinating broadleaf and narrowleaf weeds. Apply within 1-3 days after sowing/transplanting on a moist soil surface.
*   **Pendimethalin** 30% EC: Apply at 1.0 kg a.i. per acre (equivalent to 3.3 litres of commercial product) in 200-300 litres of water. This is effective against many annual broadleaf weeds (e.g., Bathu, Congress grass) and narrowleaf weeds (e.g., Phalaris minor).

**B. Post-emergence Herbicides (Applied after crop and weed emergence):**
*   **For Narrowleaf Weeds (Grasses like Phalaris minor):**
    *   **Quizalofop-ethyl** 5% EC: Apply at 50 g a.i. per acre (equivalent to 1.0 litre of commercial product) in 200-300 litres of water, when grasses are at the 2-4 leaf stage.
    *   **Fluazifop-p-butyl** 13.4% EC: Apply at 125-150 g a.i. per acre (equivalent to 930-1120 ml of commercial product) in 200-300 litres of water, when grasses are at the 2-4 leaf stage.
    These are selective graminicides and are generally safe for Bitter Gourd.

*   **For Broadleaf Weeds (Bathu, Congress grass):**
    *   **Selective post-emergence herbicides for broadleaf weeds are very limited and generally not recommended for Bitter Gourd due to potential phytotoxicity.** Manual weeding remains the most reliable and recommended method for controlling broadleaf weeds in a standing Bitter Gourd crop.

*   **For Amarbail (Cuscuta):**
    *   Once Amarbail is established, chemical control in a standing Bitter Gourd crop is extremely difficult without harming the crop.
    *   **Manual removal of affected plant parts or entire infested plants is the most practical and recommended method.** Early detection and removal before it spreads are critical. Ensure all removed Cuscuta biomass is destroyed to prevent re-infestation.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always ensure uniform spray coverage.
*   Use appropriate spray nozzles (e.g., flat fan nozzle for herbicides).
*   Read and strictly follow the label instructions of the herbicide carefully for dosage, application timing, and safety precautions.
*   Rotate herbicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of herbicide resistance.
