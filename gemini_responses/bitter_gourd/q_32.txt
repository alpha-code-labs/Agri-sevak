Namaste! The symptom of "drying up" in Bitter Gourd, affecting branches, leaves, fruits, and flowers, is a serious concern and can be attributed to several factors, including diseases, pests, and physiological stresses. As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend a thorough examination of the affected plants to accurately diagnose the specific cause.

Here are the common causes and their scientifically verified management strategies for Haryana conditions:

### A. Fungal Diseases

Fungal pathogens are a very common cause of wilting and drying in cucurbits.

1.  **Fusarium Wilt (Caused by *Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. momordicae*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Yellowing and wilting of leaves, often starting from older leaves and progressing upwards. The plant eventually dries up. A characteristic brown discoloration can be observed in the vascular tissue when the stem is cut longitudinally.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural Practices:**
            *   Practice long crop rotations (3-4 years) with non-host crops.
            *   Use resistant or tolerant varieties if available.
            *   Ensure good field sanitation and remove infected plant debris.
            *   Soil solarization during summer can reduce pathogen inoculum.
        *   **Chemical Control:**
            *   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds with **Carbendazim** at 2 g/kg of seed.
            *   **Soil Drenching:** Drench the soil around the base of affected plants with:
                *   **Carbendazim** at 1 g/L of water.
                *   **Thiophanate-methyl** at 1 g/L of water.
            *   **Biological Control:** Apply bio-fungicides like *Trichoderma viride* or *Pseudomonas fluorescens* as a soil drench or mix with farmyard manure (FYM) at 2.5 kg/acre.

2.  **Phytophthora Blight and Fruit Rot (Caused by *Phytophthora capsici*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Water-soaked lesions on leaves, stems, and fruits that rapidly expand, leading to blight. Stem lesions can girdle the stem, causing wilting and drying of the vine above the lesion. Fruits develop large, water-soaked spots that turn brown and rot, eventually drying up.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural Practices:**
            *   Ensure excellent drainage in the field. Avoid waterlogging.
            *   Avoid overhead irrigation, especially during humid conditions. Use drip irrigation if possible.
            *   Practice crop rotation with non-cucurbit crops.
            *   Remove and destroy infected plant parts and fruits.
        *   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray/Drench):**
            *   **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water.
            *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride** at 2.5 ml/L of water (as drench or spray).
            *   **Dimethomorph + Mancozeb** (pre-mix) at 2.5 g/L of water.
            *   **Fenamidone + Propamocarb hydrochloride** (pre-mix) at 2 ml/L of water.

3.  **Gummy Stem Blight (Caused by *Didymella bryoniae*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Water-soaked spots on leaves that expand into V-shaped lesions. Stem cankers with characteristic gummy exudate, leading to wilting and drying of vines. Fruit rot can also occur.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural Practices:**
            *   Use disease-free seeds.
            *   Practice crop rotation.
            *   Sanitation: Remove and destroy infected plant debris.
        *   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
            *   **Chlorothalonil** at 2 g/L of water.
            *   **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water.
            *   **Azoxystrobin + Difenoconazole** (pre-mix) at 1 ml/L of water.

4.  **Anthracnose (Caused by *Colletotrichum orbiculare*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Circular to angular dark spots on leaves, often coalescing, leading to drying and shredding of leaves. Elongated, sunken lesions on stems and petioles can girdle them, causing drying of the distal parts. Sunken, dark spots on fruits.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural Practices:**
            *   Use resistant varieties if available.
            *   Practice crop rotation.
            *   Remove and destroy infected plant material.
        *   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
            *   **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water.
            *   **Chlorothalonil** at 2 g/L of water.
            *   **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5 ml/L of water.

### B. Bacterial Diseases

1.  **Bacterial Wilt (Caused by *Erwinia tracheiphila*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Sudden wilting of individual leaves or entire vines, often without prior yellowing. If a cut stem is squeezed or placed in water, a milky, sticky ooze (bacterial exudate) can be observed. The affected parts rapidly dry up. This disease is vectored by cucumber beetles.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural Practices:**
            *   Control cucumber beetles, which transmit the disease.
            *   Remove and destroy infected plants immediately to prevent spread.
            *   Practice crop rotation.
        *   **Chemical Control (Focus on Vector Control):**
            *   Since there are no effective bactericides for systemic infection, focus on controlling the beetle vectors.
            *   Spray with **Imidacloprid** at 0.3 ml/L of water to control cucumber beetles.

### C. Pests

1.  **Fruit Flies (e.g., *Bactrocera cucurbitae*, *Bactrocera dorsalis*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Female flies lay eggs in young fruits. The maggots feed inside, causing the fruits to become distorted, rot internally, and eventually dry up and drop prematurely.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural Practices:**
            *   Collect and destroy all infested and fallen fruits daily by burying them deep or burning.
            *   Bagging of individual fruits when they are young can protect them.
        *   **Mechanical Control:**
            *   Install pheromone traps (e.g., Cue-lure for *B. cucurbitae* or Methyl Eugenol for *B. dorsalis*) at 4-5 traps per acre.
        *   **Chemical Control:**
            *   **Bait Sprays:** Prepare a bait by mixing **Malathion** 50% EC at 2 ml/L of water with 10 g/L of jaggery or molasses. Spray this bait on small patches of leaves, not the entire plant, especially in the evening.
            *   **Foliar Sprays (if infestation is severe):**
                *   **Cyantraniliprole** at 0.9 ml/L of water.
                *   **Spinosad** at 0.3 ml/L of water.

### D. Physiological Conditions

1.  **Water Stress (Drought or Waterlogging)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Leaves wilt, turn yellow or brown, and eventually dry up. Flowers and young fruits may drop. Both insufficient water (drought) and excessive water (waterlogging, leading to root rot) can cause similar symptoms due to impaired water uptake.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Ensure consistent and adequate irrigation, especially during flowering and fruiting stages.
        *   Improve soil drainage to prevent waterlogging.
        *   Apply mulch (straw, dry leaves) around plants to conserve soil moisture and regulate soil temperature.

2.  **Nutrient Deficiencies**
    *   **Symptoms:** Specific nutrient deficiencies can lead to leaf discoloration, necrosis, and drying. For example, severe potassium deficiency can cause scorching of leaf margins, and calcium deficiency can lead to blossom end rot in fruits, which then dry up.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Conduct a soil test to identify specific nutrient deficiencies.
        *   Apply a balanced fertilizer program based on soil test recommendations.
        *   Foliar application of specific micronutrients (e.g., Boron, Calcium) if a deficiency is confirmed.

3.  **Heat Stress/Sun Scorch**
    *   **Symptoms:** During periods of intense heat and direct sunlight, especially in summer, leaves can develop bleached or scorched areas, leading to drying. Fruits exposed to direct sun can also suffer from sunscald.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Provide partial shade during peak summer months using shade nets (e.g., 30-50% shade net).
        *   Maintain adequate soil moisture to help plants cope with heat.

**Integrated Pest and Disease Management (IPM) Approach:**
It is crucial to adopt an IPM approach, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods for sustainable and effective management of these issues. Always follow label instructions for chemical applications, including dosage, timing, and pre-harvest intervals.

Please observe your plants closely to identify the specific symptoms and then apply the most appropriate management strategy. If you can provide more specific details or images, I can offer a more precise diagnosis.
