Namaste, Kisan bhaiyon! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I am here to provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing pests in your Bitter Gourd crop.

Let's address your concerns regarding Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies:

### 1. Beetles

Beetles, such as the Red Pumpkin Beetle (Aulacophora foveicollis) and Epilachna Beetle (Henosepilachna vigintioctopunctata), are common pests of Bitter Gourd in Haryana. They cause damage by feeding on leaves, flowers, and young fruits, leading to defoliation and reduced yield.

**Control Measures:**

**A. Cultural and Mechanical Practices:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Keep the field free of weeds and crop debris, which can harbor pests.
*   **Hand-picking:** Regularly inspect your crop and hand-pick adult beetles, grubs, and egg masses, especially in the early stages of infestation.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation to break the pest cycle.
*   **Timely Sowing:** Adjust sowing time to avoid peak pest incidence periods if possible.

**B. Chemical Control (Apply only when necessary and follow safety guidelines):**
For effective control of beetles, consider the following CIBRC approved insecticides:

*   **Malathion 50% EC:** Apply at a rate of 1.0 - 1.25 L per acre (or 2 - 2.5 ml per litre of water).
*   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** Apply at a rate of 100 - 120 ml per acre (or 0.2 - 0.24 ml per litre of water).
*   **Carbaryl 50% WP:** Apply at a rate of 1.0 - 1.2 kg per acre (or 2 - 2.4 g per litre of water).

**Important Considerations for Chemical Application:**
*   Always use the recommended dosage.
*   Ensure thorough coverage of the plant foliage.
*   Spray during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   Observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) specified for each chemical to ensure the safety of the produce.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying.
