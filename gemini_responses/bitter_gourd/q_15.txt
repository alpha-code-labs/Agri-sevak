As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the specified pests in Bitter Gourd in Haryana:

### Grasshopper Control in Bitter Gourd

Grasshoppers are polyphagous pests that can cause significant defoliation in bitter gourd, especially during early growth stages.

**1. Cultural Control:**
*   Regular monitoring of the crop for early detection.
*   Hand-picking and destroying grasshoppers in small infestations, particularly during morning hours when they are less active.
*   Maintaining field hygiene by removing weeds and crop residues that can serve as breeding grounds.

**2. Chemical Control:**
For severe infestations, chemical intervention may be necessary. Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.
*   **Malathion** 50% EC: Apply at 2-3 ml/L of water or 1.0 - 1.5 L/acre.
*   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: Apply at 0.4-0.5 ml/L of water or 200-250 ml/acre.
*   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: Apply at 2-2.5 ml/L of water or 1.0 - 1.25 L/acre.

### Painted Bug Control in Bitter Gourd

This is not known to affect Bitter Gourd. Painted bug (Bagrada hilaris) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., mustard, cabbage, cauliflower).

### Red Cotton Bug Control in Bitter Gourd

This is not known to affect Bitter Gourd. Red cotton bug (Dysdercus cingulatus) is primarily a pest of cotton and other malvaceous plants.

### Black Ants Control in Bitter Gourd

Black ants are generally not primary pests of bitter gourd that cause direct damage to the plant tissue. They are often secondary pests, attracted to the honeydew secreted by other sucking insects like aphids, whiteflies, or mealybugs. They can also protect these honeydew-producing pests from natural enemies.

**1. Understanding the Role:**
*   First, identify if there are any primary sucking pests present on the bitter gourd plants. Controlling these primary pests will often reduce the ant population naturally.
*   If ants are directly causing damage (e.g., disturbing seeds, girdling young seedlings, or significantly interfering with plant growth) or actively protecting other pests, then direct control measures can be considered.

**2. Control Measures:**
*   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: For drenching ant nests or around the base of plants if they are causing direct damage or protecting other pests. Use 4-5 ml/L of water for drenching.
*   **Fipronil** 0.3% GR: For soil application around the base of plants at 5-10 kg/acre, especially if ants are disturbing seeds or roots. This should be applied as a granular formulation to the soil.

Always follow the instructions on the product label for safe and effective application, including pre-harvest intervals (PHI) and safety precautions.
