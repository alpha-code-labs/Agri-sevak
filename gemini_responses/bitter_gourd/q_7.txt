As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling diseases in Bitter Gourd in Haryana:

**1. Dieback and Twig Blight in Bitter Gourd**

Dieback and Twig Blight are often symptoms of underlying fungal infections rather than specific diseases themselves. In Bitter Gourd, these symptoms are commonly associated with diseases like Gummy Stem Blight (*Didymella bryoniae*) and Anthracnose (*Colletotrichum orbiculare*), which can cause lesions on stems, petioles, and twigs, leading to wilting and dieback of affected parts.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Practice a 2-3 year crop rotation with non-cucurbit crops to reduce pathogen inoculum in the soil.
    *   **Sanitation:** Promptly remove and destroy all infected plant debris, including fallen leaves and diseased stems, to prevent the spread of spores.
    *   **Seed Treatment:** Use disease-free seeds or treat seeds with recommended fungicides.
    *   **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to improve air circulation, which helps reduce humidity and fungal growth.
    *   **Irrigation Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day. Drip irrigation is preferred to keep foliage dry.
    *   **Pruning:** Prune lower leaves and branches that touch the soil to reduce splash dispersal of spores.

*   **Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
    For effective control, apply fungicides preventively or at the first sign of symptoms. Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

    *   **Mancozeb 75% WP**: Apply at a rate of 2.5 g/L of water. (Contact fungicide, protective action)
    *   **Chlorothalonil 75% WP**: Apply at a rate of 2 g/L of water. (Contact fungicide, protective action)
    *   **Carbendazim 50% WP**: Apply at a rate of 1 g/L of water. (Systemic fungicide, protective and curative action)
    *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC**: Apply at a rate of 0.5 ml/L of water. (Systemic fungicide, broad-spectrum)
    *   **Tebuconazole 250 EC**: Apply at a rate of 1 ml/L of water. (Systemic fungicide, protective and curative action)

    Ensure thorough coverage of the plant foliage and stems during spraying. Repeat applications as per product label recommendations, typically every 7-10 days, depending on disease severity and weather conditions.

**2. Tikka Disease in Bitter Gourd**

This is not known to affect Bitter Gourd. Tikka disease is primarily a foliar disease of groundnut (peanut) caused by *Cercospora arachidicola* and *Phaeoisariopsis personata*.
