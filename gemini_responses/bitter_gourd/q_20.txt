Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the critical role of micronutrients in ensuring healthy growth and optimal yield of Bitter Gourd (Karela). Deficiencies in these essential elements can significantly impact plant vigour and fruit quality.

Before applying any corrective measures, it is highly recommended to conduct a comprehensive soil test. This will accurately identify the specific nutrient deficiencies and their severity, allowing for targeted and efficient management. Visual symptoms can be indicative, but soil testing provides scientific confirmation.

Here's how to address the common micronutrient deficiencies in Bitter Gourd:

### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Stunted growth, small and narrow leaves (often called 'little leaf'), interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, and sometimes bronzing of older leaves.

**Correction:**
*   **Soil Application (Pre-sowing or at planting):**
    *   Apply **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (21% Zn) at 10-25 kg/acre.
    *   Alternatively, apply **Zinc sulphate monohydrate** (33% Zn) at 5-10 kg/acre.
*   **Foliar Application (During active growth, repeat if necessary):**
    *   Spray a solution of **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (21% Zn) at 5 g/L of water (0.5% solution).
    *   Alternatively, use **Zinc EDTA** (12% Zn) at 1 g/L of water (0.1% solution).

### 2. Iron (Fe) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Pronounced interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins, with veins remaining green) on young leaves, which can progress to almost white leaves in severe cases. Growth is often stunted.

**Correction:**
*   **Soil Application (Less effective in high pH soils common in Haryana):**
    *   Apply **Ferrous sulphate** (19% Fe) at 10-25 kg/acre.
    *   For better availability in alkaline soils, consider **Iron EDTA** (12% Fe) at 5-10 kg/acre.
*   **Foliar Application (Most effective for quick correction):**
    *   Spray a solution of **Ferrous sulphate** (19% Fe) at 5-10 g/L of water (0.5-1% solution).
    *   Alternatively, use **Iron EDTA** (12% Fe) at 1 g/L of water (0.1% solution). Repeat applications may be needed.

### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Stunted growth, thickening and cracking of stems, brittle leaves, poor fruit set, deformed or malformed fruits, and sometimes internal browning of fruits. Growing points may die back.

**Correction:**
*   **Soil Application (Pre-sowing or at planting):**
    *   Apply **Borax** (10.5% B) at 4-8 kg/acre.
    *   Alternatively, use **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (20% B) at 2-4 kg/acre.
*   **Foliar Application (During flowering and fruit development):**
    *   Spray a solution of **Borax** (10.5% B) at 1-2 g/L of water (0.1-0.2% solution).
    *   Alternatively, use **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (20% B) at 1 g/L of water (0.1% solution).

### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Stunted growth, distorted new leaves, tip burn on young leaves, weak stems, and in severe cases, blossom end rot on fruits (though less common in bitter gourd than in other cucurbits or solanaceous crops, it can occur).

**Correction:**
*   **Soil Application (Pre-sowing or at planting):**
    *   Apply **Gypsum** (Calcium sulphate) as per soil test recommendations, especially if soil pH is high.
    *   Apply **Calcium nitrate** at 10-20 kg/acre.
*   **Foliar Application (During active growth and fruit development):**
    *   Spray a solution of **Calcium chloride** at 5 g/L of water (0.5% solution).
    *   Alternatively, use **Calcium nitrate** at 5-10 g/L of water (0.5-1% solution).

### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves (yellowing between veins, with veins remaining green), often starting from the leaf margins and progressing inwards. Leaves may become brittle and curl upwards.

**Correction:**
*   **Soil Application (Pre-sowing or at planting):**
    *   Apply **Magnesium sulphate** (Epsom salt) at 10-25 kg/acre.
*   **Foliar Application (During active growth, repeat if necessary):**
    *   Spray a solution of **Magnesium sulphate** at 5-10 g/L of water (0.5-1% solution).

### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, similar to iron deficiency but often with small necrotic (dead) spots appearing within the yellowed areas. Growth is generally stunted.

**Correction:**
*   **Soil Application (Less effective in high pH soils):**
    *   Apply **Manganese sulphate** at 10-20 kg/acre.
*   **Foliar Application (Most effective for quick correction):**
    *   Spray a solution of **Manganese sulphate** at 5 g/L of water (0.5% solution).
    *   Alternatively, use **Manganese EDTA** (12% Mn) at 1 g/L of water (0.1% solution).

### General Recommendations and Precautions:

*   **Timing:** Foliar applications are best done in the early morning or late evening to avoid scorching of leaves and ensure better absorption.
*   **Water Quality:** Use clean water for spraying.
*   **Compatibility:** Always check the compatibility of different chemicals before mixing them for foliar application. It is generally advisable to apply micronutrients separately unless compatibility is confirmed.
*   **Repeated Applications:** For severe deficiencies, multiple foliar applications at 7-10 day intervals may be required until symptoms disappear.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management:** Combine micronutrient applications with balanced NPK fertilization and organic matter addition for long-term soil health and nutrient availability.

By following these scientifically verified recommendations, you can effectively manage micronutrient deficiencies in your Bitter Gourd crop and achieve healthy growth and bountiful harvests.
