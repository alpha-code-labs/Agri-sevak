As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following fertilizer schedule for Bitter Gourd cultivation in Haryana. Please note that these are general recommendations, and a soil test is always the most accurate way to determine specific nutrient requirements for your field.

**General NPK Recommendation for Bitter Gourd:**
For optimal yield and quality, Bitter Gourd typically requires approximately 90 kg Nitrogen (N), 50 kg Phosphorus (P2O5), and 50 kg Potassium (K2O) per acre. Additionally, Sulphur (S) is beneficial.

**Fertilizer Application Schedule:**

**1. Basal Application (at the time of planting/sowing):**
Apply the entire dose of Phosphorus, Potassium, Sulphur, and one-third of the total Nitrogen requirement.

*   **Phosphorus (P2O5) & Nitrogen (N):**
    *   **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)**: 110 kg/acre (This provides approximately 20 kg N and 50 kg P2O5).
    *   *Alternatively, if you prefer Single Super Phosphate for Phosphorus and Sulphur:*
        *   **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)**: 315 kg/acre (This provides approximately 50 kg P2O5 and 35 kg S). If using SSP, you will need to adjust the Urea dose for basal N accordingly (see below).
*   **Potassium (K2O):**
    *   **Muriate of Potash (MOP)**: 85 kg/acre (This provides approximately 51 kg K2O).
*   **Nitrogen (N) (remaining for basal):**
    *   If using **DAP**: You need an additional ~10 kg N for the basal dose (30 kg total basal N - 20 kg N from DAP).
        *   **Urea**: 20-25 kg/acre.
    *   If using **SSP**: You need ~30 kg N for the basal dose.
        *   **Urea**: 65 kg/acre.
*   **Sulphur (S):**
    *   If you used **DAP** and not **SSP**, apply:
        *   **Bentonite Sulphur (90%)**: 20-25 kg/acre. (If using SSP, the Sulphur requirement is largely met).

**2. Top Dressing (Remaining Nitrogen):**
The remaining two-thirds of the Nitrogen (approximately 60 kg N/acre) should be applied in 2-3 split doses.

*   **First Top Dressing (30-45 days after sowing/planting):**
    *   **Urea**: 65 kg/acre (to provide approximately 30 kg N).
*   **Second Top Dressing (60-75 days after sowing/planting, or at flowering/early fruiting stage):**
    *   **Urea**: 65 kg/acre (to provide approximately 30 kg N).

**3. Nano Fertilizers (Foliar Application - Supplementary):**
Nano fertilizers are excellent for supplementing nutrient uptake and improving efficiency, especially during critical growth stages. They are not a complete replacement for conventional fertilizers but enhance their effectiveness.

*   **Nano-Urea**:
    *   **Dose**: 2-4 ml/L of water.
    *   **Application**: 2-3 sprays during the vegetative growth phase and early fruiting stage.
*   **Nano-DAP**:
    *   **Dose**: 2-4 ml/L of water.
    *   **Application**: 1-2 sprays during the pre-flowering and fruiting stages.

**4. NPK Complex Fertilizers:**
If you prefer using NPK complex fertilizers (e.g., 12:32:16, 10:26:26, 19:19:19), calculate the required quantity to meet the NPK targets mentioned above. You may need to supplement with additional **Urea** or **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** to balance the nutrient requirements. For example, if using **NPK (12:32:16)**, you would need approximately 155 kg/acre to meet the P2O5 requirement, which would then supply about 18.6 kg N and 24.8 kg K2O, requiring further supplementation.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Soil Testing:** Always conduct a soil test to get precise recommendations tailored to your field's nutrient status.
*   **Organic Matter:** Incorporating farmyard manure (FYM) or compost (10-15 tonnes/acre) during land preparation significantly improves soil health and nutrient availability, reducing the need for chemical fertilizers.
*   **Irrigation:** Ensure adequate and timely irrigation, as nutrient uptake is highly dependent on soil moisture.
*   **Method of Application:** For basal application, broadcast fertilizers evenly and incorporate them into the soil before planting. For top dressing, apply fertilizers near the plant base and lightly irrigate.
