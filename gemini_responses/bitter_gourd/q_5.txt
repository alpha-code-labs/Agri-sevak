Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing these conditions in Bitter Gourd (Karela) in Haryana.

It is crucial to correctly identify the specific disease or condition before applying any control measures. Always follow the instructions on the pesticide label for dosage, application method, and safety precautions.

Here's how to address the conditions you've mentioned:

### 1. Scab (Bitter Gourd)

Scab, caused by the fungus *Cladosporium cucumerinum*, is a known disease of bitter gourd and other cucurbits. It can cause significant damage to fruits, leaves, and stems.

**Symptoms:**
*   Small, water-soaked spots on leaves, which turn angular and greyish-white with a yellow halo.
*   Sunken, circular lesions on fruits, often with a gummy exudate, leading to malformation.
*   Lesions can also appear on stems and petioles.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Use disease-free seeds or treat seeds with a recommended fungicide.
    *   Practice crop rotation with non-cucurbit crops for at least 2-3 years.
    *   Ensure proper plant spacing to improve air circulation and reduce humidity.
    *   Remove and destroy infected plant debris to reduce inoculum.
    *   Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day, to keep foliage dry.
    *   Consider planting resistant or tolerant varieties if available.

*   **Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
    *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP): Apply at 2.0-2.5 kg/acre or 2.0-2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Chlorothalonil** (75% WP): Apply at 500 g/acre or 2.0 g/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC): Apply at 200 ml/acre or 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Difenoconazole** (25% EC): Apply at 100 ml/acre or 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

### 2. Canker (Bitter Gourd)

While "canker" is a broad term, in bitter gourd, canker-like symptoms on stems and branches are often associated with diseases like Gummy Stem Blight (*Didymella bryoniae*) or certain bacterial infections.

**Symptoms:**
*   Water-soaked lesions on stems, often near the soil line or nodes, which later become sunken and dark.
*   Cracking of the stem tissue, sometimes with gummy exudation (especially in Gummy Stem Blight).
*   Wilting of vines and eventual plant collapse.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Use disease-free seeds or treat seeds with hot water or fungicides.
    *   Practice strict field sanitation, removing and destroying infected plant material.
    *   Ensure good drainage and avoid waterlogging.
    *   Avoid mechanical injuries to plants, as these can create entry points for pathogens.
    *   Crop rotation with non-cucurbit crops is essential.

*   **Chemical Control (Fungicides/Bactericides):**
    *   For fungal cankers (e.g., Gummy Stem Blight):
        *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC): Apply at 200 ml/acre or 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Difenoconazole** (25% EC): Apply at 100 ml/acre or 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP): Apply at 2.0-2.5 kg/acre or 2.0-2.5 g/L of water.
    *   For suspected bacterial cankers/lesions:
        *   **Copper Oxychloride** (50% WP): Apply at 750-1000 g/acre or 2.5-3.0 g/L of water.

### 3. Gummosis (Bitter Gourd)

Gummosis, characterized by the exudation of gum, is not a primary disease of bitter gourd itself. However, it can occur as a symptom of severe stress, mechanical injury, or certain fungal infections, particularly Gummy Stem Blight (as mentioned under Canker).

**Control Measures:**

*   **If Gummosis is a symptom of Gummy Stem Blight:** Refer to the control measures listed above for "Canker" (specifically the fungal canker section).
*   **If Gummosis is due to mechanical injury or environmental stress:**
    *   Identify and rectify the source of injury (e.g., pruning wounds, insect damage).
    *   Ensure optimal growing conditions, including proper irrigation, nutrition, and soil health, to reduce plant stress.
    *   Protect plants from extreme weather conditions.

### 4. Lichen (Bitter Gourd)

This is not known to affect Bitter Gourd. Lichens are symbiotic organisms (fungus and alga) that typically grow on the bark of perennial trees and shrubs, rocks, or other stable surfaces. Bitter gourd is an annual vine with a relatively short life cycle and does not develop woody stems that would support lichen growth. Lichens are generally harmless to plants and do not parasitize them.

For any further clarification or specific disease diagnosis, please feel free to consult with the plant pathology department at HAU, Hisar, or your local agricultural extension officer.
