Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I am pleased to provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing pests in Bitter Gourd in Haryana.

It is crucial to adopt an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods for sustainable and effective pest control.

### 1. Control of Borers (Melon Fruit Fly - *Bactrocera cucurbitae*)

The Melon Fruit Fly is a major pest of bitter gourd, causing significant damage by boring into the fruits.

*   **Cultural and Mechanical Practices:**
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Regularly collect and destroy all fallen, damaged, and infested fruits by burying them deep in the soil or burning them. This breaks the pest's life cycle.
    *   **Deep Ploughing:** After harvest, deep ploughing helps expose pupae to predators and sunlight, reducing future populations.
    *   **Bagging:** Covering young fruits with paper or cloth bags can protect them from fruit fly oviposition.
    *   **Pheromone Traps:** Install cucurbit fruit fly pheromone traps (e.g., with cue-lure) at a rate of 10-12 traps per acre to monitor and mass trap male flies. Replace lures every 2-3 weeks.

*   **Chemical Control (Bait Sprays):**
    *   Prepare a bait spray by mixing an insecticide with a protein source (like jaggery or molasses). This attracts adult fruit flies.
    *   **Malathion 50% EC:** Mix 2 ml/L of water with 10 g jaggery or sugar. Apply as spot sprays on the underside of leaves, especially on the periphery of the field, during morning hours. Do not spray on the entire crop.

### 2. Control of Borers (Caterpillar Borers), Caterpillars, and Leaf folders

These pests, primarily the Pumpkin Caterpillar (*Diaphania indica*), can cause damage by feeding on leaves (leaf folder), boring into stems, and damaging fruits (fruit borer). Other general caterpillars may also feed on leaves.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Hand Picking:** Regularly inspect plants and hand-pick visible larvae and egg masses, especially in the early stages of infestation. Destroy them by crushing or immersing in soapy water.
    *   **Removal of Infested Parts:** Remove and destroy folded leaves or shoots containing larvae to prevent further spread.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-cucurbit crops to break the pest cycle.

*   **Biological Control:**
    *   **Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) formulations:** Apply *Bacillus thuringiensis* (Bt) formulations, which are biological insecticides effective against young caterpillars.
        *   **Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) wettable powder:** As per product label, typically 1-2 kg/acre or 1-2 g/L of water.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   For effective control of caterpillar borers, leaf folders, and other caterpillars, consider the following CIBRC approved insecticides. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** 60 ml/acre
    *   **Flubendiamide 20% WG:** 50 g/acre
    *   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG:** 80-100 g/acre
    *   **Spinosad 45% SC:** 60-75 ml/acre
    *   **Indoxacarb 14.5% SC:** 200 ml/acre
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** 200-250 ml/acre (Use judiciously, as it can affect beneficial insects.)

### 3. Diamondback moth

This is not known to affect Bitter Gourd. The Diamondback moth (*Plutella xylostella*) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower, mustard) and does not infest cucurbit crops like Bitter Gourd.

**General Advice for Pesticide Application:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully, including dosage, timing, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and application.
*   Ensure thorough spray coverage for effective pest control.
*   Avoid spraying during flowering to protect pollinators, or spray during non-foraging hours (early morning or late evening).
*   Consult your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions.
