Protecting pumpkin crops from wild animals is a significant challenge for farmers in Haryana. The primary methods involve physical barriers and cultural practices, as specific chemical repellents for large wild animals are not widely approved by CIBRC for direct field application in this context. Here are scientifically verified methods to protect your pumpkin crop:

*   **Physical Fencing:**
    *   **Electric Fencing:** This is highly effective against larger animals such as wild boars (सूअर), nilgai (नीलगाय), and deer (हिरण). A multi-strand electric fence, properly installed and maintained with adequate earthing, provides a strong psychological and physical deterrent. Regular checks are essential to ensure it remains functional.
    *   **Barbed Wire Fencing:** Multiple strands of barbed wire, installed at varying heights, can deter some animals. For better effectiveness, it can be combined with other deterrents.
    *   **Mesh Fencing:** For smaller animals or to prevent burrowing, a sturdy mesh fence buried partially underground (e.g., 30-45 cm deep) can be effective.
*   **Trenching:** Digging a deep trench (e.g., 1-1.5 meters deep and 0.5-1 meter wide) around the field can create a barrier, especially against wild boars, making it difficult for them to enter. This method is often more effective when combined with a fence.
*   **Guard Dogs:** Trained guard dogs can be a very effective deterrent. Their presence, barking, and territorial behavior can scare away many wild animals. This method requires proper care, feeding, and training of the dogs.
*   **Auditory and Visual Deterrents:**
    *   **Noise Makers:** Devices that produce loud noises (e.g., gas guns, firecrackers – used with caution and adherence to local regulations) can temporarily scare animals. However, animals often habituate to these over time, reducing their long-term effectiveness.
    *   **Reflective Tapes/Objects:** Shiny objects or reflective tapes can create visual disturbances, especially at night. Their long-term effectiveness is often limited as animals can get used to them.
    *   **Flashing Lights:** Solar-powered flashing lights, particularly those mimicking predator eyes, can deter nocturnal animals.
*   **Prompt Harvesting and Field Sanitation:**
    *   Harvest pumpkins as soon as they reach maturity. Leaving ripe fruits in the field for extended periods significantly attracts wild animals.
    *   Promptly remove any fallen, damaged, or overripe fruits from the field to reduce attractants.
    *   Keep the field and surrounding areas free of weeds and debris, which can provide cover and hiding spots for animals.
*   **Community-Based Approaches:**
    *   Cooperation among farmers in a village or a cluster of fields for synchronized protection efforts (e.g., collective fencing, patrolling, coordinated deterrent deployment) can be significantly more effective than individual efforts.

While some repellents exist, CIBRC (Central Insecticides Board & Registration Committee) primarily approves pesticides for insects, fungi, weeds, and rodents. Specific technical chemical names approved by CIBRC for direct agricultural field application as repellents against large wild mammals (like wild boar, nilgai, deer) are not widely available or recommended for general use in this context. Therefore, physical and cultural methods remain the most reliable and scientifically verified approaches for protecting pumpkin crops from wild animals in Haryana.
