नमस्ते! "Drying up" of branches, leaves, fruits, and flowers in pumpkin is a general symptom that can be caused by a variety of factors, both biotic (diseases, pests) and abiotic (environmental stresses). As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I advise a systematic approach to diagnose the exact cause before implementing any management strategy.

Here are the common causes and their management strategies relevant to pumpkin cultivation in Haryana:

### I. Abiotic Stresses (Non-Biological Causes)

These are often the first to consider as they are widespread.

1.  **Water Stress:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Leaves wilt, turn yellow, and dry out. Fruits may shrivel.
    *   **Causes:** Insufficient irrigation (drought), or conversely, waterlogging leading to root damage and inability to absorb water.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Ensure consistent and adequate irrigation, especially during flowering and fruiting stages.
        *   Avoid over-irrigation and ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging.
        *   Mulching can help conserve soil moisture and regulate soil temperature.

2.  **Heat Stress/Sunscald:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Leaves may scorch, turn brown, and dry. Fruits develop bleached, sunken areas that can become papery and dry.
    *   **Causes:** Prolonged exposure to high temperatures and intense direct sunlight.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Provide partial shade during peak summer months, especially for young plants and developing fruits.
        *   Ensure adequate soil moisture to help plants cope with heat.

3.  **Nutrient Deficiencies/Toxicities:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Specific nutrient deficiencies can cause leaf discoloration, necrosis, and drying. For example, severe potassium deficiency can cause marginal leaf scorch.
    *   **Causes:** Imbalanced soil nutrients.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Conduct soil testing to determine nutrient status.
        *   Apply balanced fertilizers based on soil test recommendations.
        *   Foliar application of micronutrients if specific deficiencies are identified.

4.  **Soil Salinity:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, marginal leaf burn, wilting, and drying of leaves.
    *   **Causes:** High salt concentration in the soil, common in some parts of Haryana.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Use good quality irrigation water.
        *   Improve soil drainage.
        *   Incorporate organic matter to improve soil structure and reduce salinity effects.
        *   Leaching with good quality water (if available and drainage is good).

### II. Biotic Stresses (Diseases and Pests)

These require careful observation for specific signs and symptoms.

#### A. Fungal Diseases

1.  **Fusarium Wilt (Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cucurbitacearum):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Wilting and yellowing of leaves, often starting on one side of the plant or a single vine. The wilting progresses, leading to drying and death of the entire plant. Vascular tissue inside the stem may show brown discoloration when cut.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural:** Use resistant varieties. Practice long crop rotations (3-4 years) with non-cucurbit crops. Ensure good field sanitation.
        *   **Chemical (Seed Treatment/Drench):**
            *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP @ 2 g/kg seed (for seed treatment) or 1-2 g/L water (for drenching).
            *   **Thiophanate-methyl** 70% WP @ 1-2 g/L water (for drenching).

2.  **Phytophthora Blight (Phytophthora capsici):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Rapid wilting and collapse of entire plants, often starting from the crown or roots. Water-soaked lesions on stems, leaves, and fruits that quickly expand and rot, leading to drying.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural:** Ensure excellent drainage. Avoid planting in low-lying areas prone to waterlogging. Practice crop rotation.
        *   **Chemical (Foliar/Drench):**
            *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride** 72.2% SL @ 2.5 ml/L water.
            *   **Metalaxyl-M + Mancozeb** 64% WP (8% + 56%) @ 2.5 g/L water.
            *   **Fenamidone + Mancozeb** 60% WG (10% + 50%) @ 3 g/L water.

3.  **Gummy Stem Blight (Didymella bryoniae / Stagonosporopsis cucurbitacearum):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Water-soaked spots on leaves that turn brown and dry. Stem lesions with gummy exudates, leading to girdling and wilting/drying of vines. Fruit rot can also occur.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural:** Use disease-free seeds. Practice crop rotation. Remove and destroy infected plant debris.
        *   **Chemical (Foliar):**
            *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC @ 0.5-1 ml/L water.
            *   **Pyraclostrobin + Metiram** 55% WG (5% + 50%) @ 1.5-2 g/L water.
            *   **Chlorothalonil** 75% WP @ 2 g/L water.

4.  **Powdery Mildew (Podosphaera xanthii, Erysiphe cichoracearum):**
    *   **Symptoms:** White, powdery patches on leaves and stems. Severe infection leads to yellowing, browning, and premature drying of leaves, reducing photosynthesis and fruit quality.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural:** Use resistant varieties. Ensure good air circulation.
        *   **Chemical (Foliar):**
            *   **Sulphur** 80% WP @ 2-3 g/L water (avoid application during very hot weather).
            *   **Myclobutanil** 10% WP @ 0.5 g/L water.
            *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC @ 0.5-1 ml/L water.
            *   **Difenoconazole** 25% EC @ 0.5 ml/L water.

5.  **Downy Mildew (Pseudoperonospora cubensis):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Angular yellow spots on the upper surface of leaves, turning brown and necrotic, giving a "dried" appearance. Purplish-grey fuzzy growth on the underside of leaves, especially in humid conditions. Severe infection leads to rapid defoliation.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural:** Use resistant varieties. Ensure good air circulation.
        *   **Chemical (Foliar):**
            *   **Metalaxyl-M + Mancozeb** 64% WP (8% + 56%) @ 2.5 g/L water.

            *   **Cymoxanil + Mancozeb** 60% WP (8% + 52%) @ 2.5 g/L water.

#### B. Bacterial Diseases

1.  **Bacterial Wilt (Erwinia tracheiphila / Pantoea stewartii):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Rapid, sudden wilting of individual leaves or entire vines, followed by drying and death. A characteristic milky, sticky ooze can be observed when a cut stem is squeezed or pulled apart. Transmitted by cucumber beetles.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural:** Control cucumber beetles (the vectors). Remove and destroy infected plants immediately. Practice crop rotation.
        *   **Chemical:** No effective bactericide for established wilt. Focus on vector control.
            *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL @ 0.5 ml/L water (for cucumber beetle control).
            *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG @ 0.2 g/L water (for cucumber beetle control).

#### C. Viral Diseases

*   **Symptoms:** While primarily causing mosaic, mottling, and distortion, severe viral infections (e.g., Cucumber Mosaic Virus, Zucchini Yellow Mosaic Virus) can lead to stunted growth, premature senescence, and drying of leaves/vines, especially under stress.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Cultural:** Use virus-free seeds/seedlings. Control insect vectors (aphids, whiteflies) that transmit viruses. Remove and destroy infected plants.
    *   **Chemical:** No direct chemical cure for viruses. Focus on vector control using appropriate insecticides (as listed for sucking pests below).

#### D. Insect Pests

1.  **Stem Borers (e.g., Melon Worm, Squash Vine Borer):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Sudden wilting and drying of vines, often with frass (sawdust-like excrement) visible near the base of the stem or at entry holes.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural:** Monitor plants regularly. Remove and destroy infested vines. Practice crop rotation.
        *   **Chemical (Foliar/Drench):**
            *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC @ 0.3 ml/L water.
            *   **Flubendiamide** 20% WG @ 0.5 g/L water.
            *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG @ 0.4 g/L water.

2.  **Sucking Pests (Aphids, Whiteflies, Thrips, Spider Mites):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Severe infestations can cause leaves to curl, yellow, and eventually dry out due to sap depletion. Spider mites cause stippling, bronzing, and drying of leaves, often with fine webbing on the undersides.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural:** Monitor regularly. Use yellow sticky traps. Encourage natural enemies.
        *   **Chemical (Foliar):**
            *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL @ 0.5 ml/L water (for aphids, whiteflies).
            *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG @ 0.2 g/L water (for aphids, whiteflies, thrips).
            *   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP @ 0.2 g/L water (for aphids, whiteflies).
            *   **Spiromesifen** 22.9% SC @ 0.5 ml/L water (for spider mites).
            *   **Fenpyroximate** 5% EC @ 1 ml/L water (for spider mites).

3.  **Root-knot Nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, yellowing, wilting, and drying of plants, especially under stress, due to damaged roots. Galls (swellings) on roots are diagnostic.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops (e.g., marigold, cereals). Incorporate organic matter. Use resistant varieties if available.
        *   **Chemical (Soil Application):**
            *   **Fluopyram** 17.7% SC @ 250 ml/acre (drenching/soil application).
            *   **Carbofuran** 3% CG @ 10 kg/acre (granular, soil application at planting, check current CIBRC restrictions for pumpkin).

### Conclusion

To effectively address "drying up" in pumpkin, it is crucial to:
1.  **Observe carefully:** Look for specific patterns, discoloration, lesions, presence of pests, or root symptoms.
2.  **Consider environmental factors:** Review recent weather conditions and irrigation practices.
3.  **Implement Integrated Pest and Disease Management (IPDM):** Combine cultural practices, resistant varieties, biological control, and judicious use of CIBRC-approved chemicals only when necessary and after proper diagnosis. Always follow label instructions for dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
