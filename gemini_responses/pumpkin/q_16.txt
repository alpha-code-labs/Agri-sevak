As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following fertilizer schedule for Pumpkin cultivation in Haryana. Please note that these are general recommendations; a soil test is always the most accurate way to determine specific nutrient requirements for your field.

**General NPK Recommendation for Pumpkin (per acre):**
*   **Nitrogen (N):** 80-100 kg/acre
*   **Phosphorus (P2O5):** 60-80 kg/acre
*   **Potassium (K2O):** 60-80 kg/acre

Based on these recommendations, here are the doses for specific fertilizers:

---

**Option 1: Using Urea, DAP, Potash, and Sulphur**

This option provides a balanced nutrient supply using commonly available fertilizers.

**A. Basal Application (at the time of sowing/planting):**
*   **DAP**: 175 kg/acre (This supplies approximately 31.5 kg N and 80.5 kg P2O5)
*   **Potash (Muriate of Potash)**: 135 kg/acre (This supplies approximately 81 kg K2O)
*   **Urea**: 50 kg/acre (This supplies approximately 23 kg N)
*   **Bentonite Sulphur (90%)**: 20-25 kg/acre (This supplies 18-22.5 kg S, crucial for oilseed crops and general plant health)

**B. Top Dressing (Split Applications for Nitrogen):**
*   **First Top Dressing (3-4 weeks after sowing, at active vegetative growth):**
    *   **Urea**: 50 kg/acre (This supplies approximately 23 kg N)
*   **Second Top Dressing (at flowering/early fruit set stage):**
    *   **Urea**: 50 kg/acre (This supplies approximately 23 kg N)

**Total Fertilizers for Option 1 (per acre):**
*   **Urea**: 150 kg
*   **DAP**: 175 kg
*   **Potash (Muriate of Potash)**: 135 kg
*   **Bentonite Sulphur (90%)**: 20-25 kg

**Option 2: Using NPK Complex Fertilizers (as an alternative for basal application)**

If you prefer using NPK complex fertilizers, here's an alternative:

**A. Basal Application (at the time of sowing/planting):**
*   **NPK (12:32:16)**: 250 kg/acre (This supplies 30 kg N, 80 kg P2O5, and 40 kg K2O)
*   **Potash (Muriate of Potash)**: 70 kg/acre (To supplement K, providing an additional 42 kg K2O, bringing total K2O to 82 kg/acre)
*   **Bentonite Sulphur (90%)**: 20-25 kg/acre

**B. Top Dressing (Split Applications for Nitrogen):**
*   **First Top Dressing (3-4 weeks after sowing):**
    *   **Urea**: 75 kg/acre
*   **Second Top Dressing (at flowering/early fruit set stage):**
    *   **Urea**: 75 kg/acre

**Total Fertilizers for Option 2 (per acre):**
*   **NPK (12:32:16)**: 250 kg
*   **Urea**: 150 kg
*   **Potash (Muriate of Potash)**: 70 kg
*   **Bentonite Sulphur (90%)**: 20-25 kg

**Specific Fertilizers and their Role:**

*   **Urea**: Primary source of Nitrogen (46% N), essential for vegetative growth, leaf development, and overall plant vigor.
*   **DAP (Diammonium Phosphate)**: Provides both Phosphorus (46% P2O5) and Nitrogen (18% N). Phosphorus is crucial for root development, flowering, and fruit set.
*   **SSP (Single Super Phosphate)**: An alternative to DAP for Phosphorus (16% P2O5) and also provides Sulphur (11% S) and Calcium (19.5% Ca). If using SSP to meet P requirements (e.g., 500 kg SSP/acre for 80 kg P2O5), it will also supply sufficient Sulphur, and the Urea requirement will be higher as SSP provides no N.
*   **Potash (Muriate of Potash - MOP)**: Primary source of Potassium (60% K2O), vital for fruit development, disease resistance, water regulation, and overall plant health.
*   **Sulphur (Bentonite Sulphur 90%)**: Essential secondary nutrient for protein synthesis, enzyme activity, and improving crop quality.

**Nano Fertilizers (for supplementing granular fertilizers):**

Nano fertilizers offer efficient nutrient delivery through foliar application and can partially replace conventional granular fertilizers.

*   **Nano-Urea**:
    *   **Dose**: 2-4 ml/L of water.
    *   **Application**: 2-3 foliar sprays at critical growth stages (e.g., 3-4 weeks after sowing, pre-flowering, and during fruit development).
    *   **Benefit**: Can reduce the requirement of granular **Urea** by 45-90 kg/acre, depending on the number of sprays and crop response.
*   **Nano-DAP**:
    *   **Dose**: 2-5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Application**: 2 foliar sprays, typically at pre-flowering and early fruit development stages.
    *   **Benefit**: Can reduce the requirement of granular **DAP** by approximately 50 kg/acre.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Soil Testing:** Always prioritize soil test-based recommendations. These general guidelines are for fields where a soil test report is unavailable.
*   **Farm Yard Manure (FYM) / Compost:** Incorporate 10-15 tonnes/acre of well-decomposed FYM or compost during land preparation. This improves soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability, reducing the need for chemical fertilizers.
*   **Micronutrients:** Pumpkin can be sensitive to micronutrient deficiencies, especially Zinc (Zn) and Boron (B). If soil tests indicate deficiency or symptoms appear:
    *   **Zinc Sulphate (21%)**: 10-15 kg/acre as basal application, or foliar spray of **Zinc EDTA (12%)** at 0.5 g/L.
    *   **Borax (10.5%)**: 5-10 kg/acre as basal application, or foliar spray of **Boron (20%)** at 1 g/L.
*   **Water Management:** Ensure proper irrigation, especially during flowering and fruit development, as nutrient uptake is highly dependent on soil moisture.
*   **Application Method:** Basal fertilizers should be broadcast and incorporated into the soil before sowing. Top-dressed **Urea** should be applied near the plant base and lightly irrigated.
