As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I advise on weed control in Pumpkin (Cucurbita moschata) based on scientific verification and CIBRC approved practices for Haryana. Effective weed management is crucial in pumpkin, especially during the initial 4-6 weeks after sowing, as it is highly sensitive to weed competition.

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Weed Control (Foundation of Integrated Weed Management):**

*   **Field Preparation:** Thorough ploughing and harrowing before sowing helps in exposing weed seeds to the sun and burying others deep, reducing the initial weed flush.
*   **Clean Seed:** Always use certified, weed-free pumpkin seeds to prevent the introduction of new weed species, especially parasitic ones like Amarbail.
*   **Mulching:** Application of plastic mulch (black or silver) is highly effective. It suppresses weed growth, conserves soil moisture, and helps regulate soil temperature. Organic mulches (straw, dry leaves) can also be used.
*   **Hand Weeding/Hoeing:** This is the most effective method, especially for broadleaf weeds, parasitic weeds, and weeds growing close to the crop.
    *   Perform 2-3 hand weedings: The first at 20-25 days after sowing (DAS) and subsequent ones at 40-45 DAS, or as needed, depending on weed pressure.
    *   For parasitic weeds like Amarbail and Orobanche, hand removal of infested plants or cutting off infested parts before they set seed is critical.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate pumpkin with non-host crops (e.g., cereals) to break the life cycle of specific weeds, especially parasitic ones.

**2. Chemical Weed Control (Herbicides):**

*   **Pre-emergence Herbicides (for Broadleaf, Narrowleaf weeds, Bathu, Phalaris minor, and some control of Congress grass):**
    *   Apply these herbicides within 3 days of sowing, after seed placement but before crop and weed emergence. Ensure adequate soil moisture for efficacy.
    *   **Pendimethalin 30% EC:** Apply **3.3 - 5.0 L/acre** in 200-300 L of water. This provides good control of many annual grasses and broadleaf weeds.
    *   **Fluchloralin 45% EC:** Apply **2.2 - 3.3 L/acre** in 200-300 L of water. This can be applied as pre-plant incorporation or pre-emergence.

*   **Post-emergence Herbicides (for Narrowleaf weeds/Grasses like Phalaris minor):**
    *   These are selective herbicides for grass control in broadleaf crops like pumpkin. Apply when grasses are at the 2-4 leaf stage.
    *   **Quizalofop-ethyl 5% EC:** Apply **1.0 - 2.0 L/acre** in 200-300 L of water.
    *   **Fluazifop-P-butyl 13.4% EC:** Apply **0.9 - 1.8 L/acre** in 200-300 L of water.

**3. Specific Weed Management:**

*   **Amarbail (Cuscuta spp. - Parasitic Weed):**
    *   Prevention is paramount: Use clean seeds and avoid bringing contaminated fodder or soil.
    *   **Cultural/Mechanical:** Hand removal of infested pumpkin plants or cutting off the infested parts before the Amarbail sets seed is the most effective and safe method in a standing crop. Solarization during fallow periods can reduce the seed bank.
    *   **Chemical:** There are no selective post-emergence herbicides approved and safe for controlling Amarbail in a standing pumpkin crop.

*   **Bathu (Chenopodium album - Broadleaf Weed):**
    *   Effectively controlled by pre-emergence herbicides like **Pendimethalin** and **Fluchloralin**.
    *   Hand weeding and hoeing are also very effective against Bathu.

*   **Congress Grass (Parthenium hysterophorus - Broadleaf Weed):**
    *   **Cultural/Mechanical:** Hand pulling of young plants (wearing gloves to avoid allergic reactions) before flowering and seed set is crucial.
    *   **Chemical:** Pre-emergence application of **Pendimethalin** can offer some suppression. There are no selective post-emergence herbicides safe for pumpkin that effectively control Parthenium. Spot application of non-selective herbicides like Glyphosate can be done in non-cropped areas or before planting, but never in a standing pumpkin crop.

*   **Orobanche (Orobanche spp. - Parasitic Weed):**
    *   While *Orobanche aegyptiaca* can parasitize cucurbits, it is generally not as common or severe a problem in pumpkin in Haryana as it is in crops like mustard or tomato.
    *   **Cultural/Mechanical:** Crop rotation with non-host crops (e.g., cereals), trap crops, and catch crops can help reduce its incidence. Hand pulling of Orobanche shoots before they flower and set seed is the only safe method in a standing pumpkin crop, though damage to the host plant would have already occurred. Solarization of infested fields during summer fallow can reduce seed viability.
    *   **Chemical:** There are no selective herbicides approved and safe for controlling Orobanche in a standing pumpkin crop.

*   **Phalaris minor (Little Seed Canary Grass - Narrowleaf Weed):**
    *   Effectively controlled by pre-emergence herbicides like **Pendimethalin**.
    *   Post-emergence graminicides like **Quizalofop-ethyl** or **Fluazifop-P-butyl** provide excellent selective control in pumpkin.

**4. General Precautions:**

*   Always read and follow the label instructions of any herbicide carefully.
*   Use the correct dosage and water volume.
*   Ensure uniform spray coverage.
*   Avoid spraying on windy days to prevent drift to non-target crops.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application.
*   Integrate chemical control with cultural and mechanical methods for sustainable weed management.
