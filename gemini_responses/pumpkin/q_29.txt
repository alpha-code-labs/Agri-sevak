Dear Farmer,

The issue of "dropping" in pumpkins, which includes flower drop and fruit drop, is a common physiological problem that can significantly reduce yield. It is important to understand that "Tinda" is a different cucurbit crop (Indian round gourd), and "Boll dropping" is a term typically associated with cotton. For your pumpkin crop, we will focus on the causes and control of flower and fruit drop.

Flower and fruit drop in pumpkins are often due to a combination of environmental stresses, nutritional imbalances, and poor pollination. Here are the scientifically verified control measures:

**I. Cultural and Environmental Management:**

1.  **Ensure Adequate Pollination:**
    *   Pumpkins require insect pollination, primarily by bees, to set fruit.
    *   Avoid spraying broad-spectrum insecticides during the flowering period to protect pollinators.
    *   Consider placing bee hives near your field to enhance pollination.
    *   In small plots, hand pollination can be done by transferring pollen from male flowers to female flowers (which have a small swelling at their base) in the morning hours.

2.  **Maintain Consistent Soil Moisture:**
    *   Both drought stress and waterlogging can lead to flower and fruit drop.
    *   Provide regular and uniform irrigation, especially during flowering and fruit development stages. The soil should be moist but not waterlogged.

3.  **Manage Temperature Extremes:**
    *   Very high temperatures (above 35-40°C) can reduce pollen viability and hinder fruit set.
    *   Very low temperatures can also negatively impact growth and pollination.
    *   Ensure proper plant spacing to allow for good air circulation and reduce heat stress.

4.  **Balanced Nutrition:**
    *   Conduct a soil test to determine nutrient deficiencies.
    *   Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can promote vegetative growth at the expense of reproductive growth.
    *   Ensure adequate supply of phosphorus and potassium.

**II. Nutritional and Hormonal Interventions (CIBRC Approved):**

1.  **Boron Deficiency Correction:** Boron is crucial for pollen germination and fruit set.
    *   Foliar spray with **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** at 1-1.5 g/L of water. Apply at the pre-flowering and early fruit set stages.

2.  **Calcium Deficiency Correction:** Calcium is vital for cell wall development and fruit integrity.
    *   Foliar spray with **Calcium nitrate** at 5-10 g/L of water. Apply during flowering and early fruit development.

3.  **Plant Growth Regulator Application:** Auxins can help prevent premature fruit drop by delaying abscission.
    *   Foliar spray with **Naphthalene Acetic Acid** (NAA) 4.5% SL formulation at 0.5-1 ml/L of water. Apply at the time of flowering and again when fruits are small (pea to marble size). Always follow the manufacturer's instructions for specific product concentrations and application timings.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label for safe and effective use of any chemical.
*   Apply foliar sprays in the early morning or late evening to avoid scorching and maximize absorption.
*   Ensure good spray coverage on the foliage.

By implementing these measures, you can significantly reduce flower and fruit drop and improve the yield of your pumpkin crop.
