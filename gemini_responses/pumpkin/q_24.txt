As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend the following for ideal pumpkin transplantation in Haryana:

### Ideal Transplantation Time for Pumpkin

Pumpkins are warm-season crops and thrive in frost-free conditions. In Haryana, there are two primary seasons for successful pumpkin cultivation:

*   **Spring-Summer Season:**
    *   **Transplantation:** February to March.
    *   This allows the crop to establish before the intense summer heat and mature before the monsoon.
*   **Monsoon (Kharif) Season:**
    *   **Transplantation:** June to July.
    *   This utilizes the monsoon rains for initial growth, with harvesting typically occurring in autumn.

### Ideal Transplantation Distance for Pumpkin

Pumpkin plants are vigorous vining crops and require ample space for optimal growth, fruit development, and air circulation.

*   **Row-to-Row Distance:** 2.5 to 3.5 meters (m)
*   **Plant-to-Plant Distance:** 0.75 to 1.5 meters (m)
    *   *Note:* The exact spacing can vary slightly depending on the specific variety (bush vs. vining type) and the fertility of the soil. For most common vining varieties, a spacing of 3 m x 1 m is generally ideal.

### Ideal Transplantation Process for Pumpkin

Successful transplantation ensures a healthy start for the pumpkin crop.

1.  **Nursery Raising:**
    *   Sow pumpkin seeds in pro-trays or raised nursery beds 3-4 weeks before the intended transplanting date.
    *   Ensure the growing medium is well-drained and rich in organic matter.
    *   Provide adequate water and protection from extreme weather.
    *   Seedlings should have 2-4 true leaves and a well-developed root system at the time of transplanting.
2.  **Field Preparation:**
    *   Prepare the main field by deep ploughing and harrowing to achieve a fine tilth.
    *   Incorporate 20-25 tonnes per acre of well-rotted Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost during land preparation.
    *   Form ridges and furrows or raised beds according to the desired spacing. This helps in better drainage and irrigation management.
3.  **Hardening Off Seedlings:**
    *   About 7-10 days before transplanting, gradually expose the seedlings to outdoor conditions (reduced watering, increased sunlight) to acclimatize them to the field environment. This reduces transplant shock.
4.  **Transplanting Operation:**
    *   Transplant seedlings preferably in the late afternoon or evening, or on a cloudy day, to minimize stress from direct sunlight.
    *   Carefully remove seedlings from the nursery trays/beds, ensuring the root ball remains intact.
    *   Plant the seedlings into the prepared holes/beds at the same depth they were growing in the nursery.
    *   Gently firm the soil around the base of each seedling to ensure good root-to-soil contact.
5.  **Post-Transplantation Care:**
    *   Immediately after transplanting, provide light irrigation to settle the soil around the roots.
    *   Monitor the transplanted seedlings closely for wilting or pest/disease incidence.
    *   Maintain adequate moisture in the soil, but avoid waterlogging.
