Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I understand your concern regarding the various rot types in pumpkin. These conditions are indeed a significant threat to pumpkin cultivation in Haryana. Effective management requires an integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods.

Here's a comprehensive guide to control all types of rot (Root, Stem, Foot, Collar, Crown, Neck, Black, Fruit, Seed, and Seedling rot) in pumpkin:

**I. Cultural and Agronomic Practices (Prevention is Key):**

1.  **Site Selection and Soil Preparation:**
    *   Choose well-drained fields. Avoid low-lying areas prone to waterlogging.
    *   Prepare raised beds (15-20 cm high) to improve drainage around the root zone and prevent direct contact of fruits with wet soil.
    *   Ensure good soil aeration by deep ploughing and incorporating organic matter.
2.  **Crop Rotation:**
    *   Practice a 3-4 year crop rotation with non-cucurbit crops (e.g., cereals, maize, pulses) to break the disease cycle and reduce pathogen inoculum in the soil.
3.  **Seed Selection:**
    *   Use certified, disease-free seeds from reputable sources.
    *   Consider resistant or tolerant varieties if available for specific rot diseases in your region.
4.  **Planting Density:**
    *   Maintain optimal plant spacing to ensure good air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce humidity and fungal growth.
5.  **Irrigation Management:**
    *   Avoid overhead irrigation, especially during fruit development, as it can splash soil-borne pathogens onto plants and create a humid environment conducive to disease.
    *   Prefer drip irrigation or furrow irrigation.
    *   Irrigate in the morning to allow foliage to dry before evening. Avoid over-irrigation.
6.  **Nutrition Management:**
    *   Provide balanced nutrition. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can lead to lush, succulent growth more susceptible to disease.
7.  **Weed Control:**
    *   Keep fields free of weeds, as they can act as alternate hosts for pathogens and impede air circulation.
8.  **Sanitation:**
    *   Promptly remove and destroy (burn or bury deep) all infected plant debris, fruits, and volunteer plants from the field.
    *   Clean farm tools and equipment regularly.
9.  **Mulching:**
    *   Use organic mulches (e.g., straw) or plastic mulches to prevent direct contact of fruits with soil, reduce soil splash, and conserve moisture.

**II. Biological Control:**

*   Application of beneficial microbial antagonists can help suppress soil-borne pathogens.
    *   **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum**: Apply as a seed treatment (4-6 g/kg seed) or soil application (2.5 kg/acre mixed with 50-100 kg farmyard manure) at the time of planting. These fungi colonize roots and compete with pathogens, and some strains produce antifungal compounds.

**III. Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved Technical Chemicals):**

Chemical control should be used judiciously and as part of an integrated strategy. Always follow label instructions for dosage and safety.

**A. Seed Treatment (for Seed Rot and Seedling Rot/Damping-off):**

*   Treat seeds before sowing to protect against soil-borne pathogens causing seed rot and damping-off.
    *   **Thiram** @ 2-3 g/kg seed
    *   **Captan** @ 2-3 g/kg seed
    *   **Carbendazim** @ 1-2 g/kg seed
    *   **Metalaxyl** @ 6 g/kg seed (specifically for *Pythium* and *Phytophthora*)
    *   A combination of **Metalaxyl + Mancozeb** @ 3-4 g/kg seed is also highly effective.

**B. Soil Drench / Basal Application (for Root, Stem, Foot, Collar, Crown Rots):**

*   Apply fungicides as a drench around the base of the plants, especially if symptoms appear or conditions are favorable for disease.
    *   **Propamocarb Hydrochloride** @ 2-3 ml/L water (drench 200-300 ml solution per plant)
    *   **Metalaxyl-M + Mancozeb** @ 2-2.5 g/L water (drench 200-300 ml solution per plant)
    *   **Fosetyl-aluminium** @ 2-3 g/L water (drench 200-300 ml solution per plant)
    *   **Carbendazim** @ 1-1.5 g/L water (drench 200-300 ml solution per plant)
    *   **Tebuconazole** @ 1-1.5 ml/L water (drench 200-300 ml solution per plant)

**C. Foliar Spray (for Black Rot, Fruit Rot, Stem Rot, Neck Rot):**

*   Initiate sprays preventively during periods of high humidity or when the first symptoms appear. Repeat at 7-14 day intervals depending on disease pressure and fungicide persistence.
    *   **Mancozeb** @ 2-2.5 g/L water
    *   **Chlorothalonil** @ 2 g/L water
    *   **Azoxystrobin** @ 0.5-1 ml/L water
    *   **Pyraclostrobin + Metiram** @ 1.5-2 g/L water
    *   **Tebuconazole** @ 0.75-1 ml/L water
    *   **Difenoconazole** @ 0.5 ml/L water
    *   **Copper Oxychloride** @ 2.5-3 g/L water (can also help with some bacterial soft rots)
    *   **Metalaxyl-M + Mancozeb** @ 2-2.5 g/L water (effective against *Phytophthora* and *Pythium* causing fruit/stem rots)

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Rotation of Fungicides:** To prevent the development of fungicide resistance, rotate fungicides with different modes of action.
*   **Timing:** Timely application is crucial. Preventive sprays are often more effective than curative ones.
*   **Adjuvants:** Use a suitable spreader-sticker (adjuvant) with foliar sprays to improve coverage and efficacy.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.

By implementing these integrated strategies, you can significantly reduce the incidence and severity of various rot diseases in your pumpkin crop. For specific local recommendations or if the problem persists, please consult with the plant pathology department at HAU, Hisar.
