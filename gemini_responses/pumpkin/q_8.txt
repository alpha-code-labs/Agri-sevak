As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling sucking pests (Aphids, Leafhopper, Whitefly, and Thrips) in Pumpkin in Haryana.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Sucking Pests in Pumpkin:**

Effective control of sucking pests involves a combination of cultural, biological, and chemical methods.

1.  **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your pumpkin plants, especially the undersides of leaves and new shoots, for the presence of pests. Early detection is key to effective management.
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the field and surrounding areas free of weeds, as they can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation to break the pest cycle.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure balanced fertilization, as excessive nitrogen can make plants more attractive to sucking pests.
    *   **Water Management:** Provide adequate irrigation to reduce plant stress.
    *   **Yellow Sticky Traps:** Install yellow sticky traps (10-12 traps per acre) to monitor and trap adult whiteflies and leafhoppers.
    *   **Reflective Mulches:** Using silver-colored reflective mulches can deter some sucking pests, especially during early crop stages.
3.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Conserve natural enemies like ladybird beetles, lacewings, and parasitic wasps, which prey on aphids and whiteflies. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

**Chemical Control (When necessary):**

When pest populations reach economic threshold levels, chemical intervention may be required. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves.

**For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips:**

The following CIBRC-approved technical chemicals are effective against these sucking pests in pumpkin:

*   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at a rate of **0.5 - 0.75 ml/L** of water.
*   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at a rate of **0.2 - 0.4 g/L** of water.
*   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply at a rate of **0.2 - 0.4 g/L** of water.
*   **Flonicamid 50% WG:** (Primarily for Aphids) Apply at a rate of **0.3 g/L** of water.
*   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** (Primarily for Whitefly nymphs) Apply at a rate of **1.25 ml/L** of water.
*   **Diafenthiuron 50% WP:** (Effective against Whiteflies, Thrips, and Mites) Apply at a rate of **1.0 - 1.25 g/L** of water.
*   **Azadirachtin 1500 ppm EC:** (Botanical insecticide, effective for early infestations and IPM) Apply at a rate of **3 - 5 ml/L** of water.
*   **Dimethoate 30% EC:** Apply at a rate of **1.5 - 2.0 ml/L** of water.

**Regarding Psylla:**

Psylla is not a common or major pest of Pumpkin in Haryana. Therefore, specific control measures for Psylla are generally not required. The recommended treatments for other sucking pests would adequately manage any incidental psyllid populations if they were to occur.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the insecticide label carefully, including dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and application.
*   Calibrate your sprayer to ensure accurate application rates.
*   Consult your local agricultural extension officer at HAU for the most current and specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and pest situation.
