As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies in Pumpkin cultivation in Haryana.

**1. Beetles in Pumpkin**

Beetles, particularly cucumber beetles (striped and spotted) and flea beetles, are significant pests of pumpkin in Haryana, causing damage from seedling stage to fruit development.

*   **Damage:**
    *   **Cucumber Beetles:** Adults feed on leaves, stems, and fruits, causing defoliation, scarring, and transmitting bacterial wilt disease. Larvae feed on roots and stems, weakening plants.
    *   **Flea Beetles:** Adults chew small, round holes (shot-holes) in leaves, especially on young seedlings, which can stunt growth or even kill plants.

*   **Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Beetles:**

    *   **Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
        *   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting pumpkins or other cucurbits in the same field year after year.
        *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy crop residues after harvest to reduce overwintering pest populations.
        *   **Timely Planting:** Plant early to allow plants to establish before peak beetle activity.
        *   **Weed Management:** Keep fields free of weeds, which can serve as alternate hosts for beetles.
        *   **Physical Barriers:** Use row covers over young seedlings to protect them from early beetle attacks. Remove covers during flowering for pollination.
        *   **Hand Picking:** In small areas, hand-pick adult beetles, especially in the early morning when they are less active.

    *   **Chemical Control (Use CIBRC approved chemicals only):**
        For effective control, especially during early stages or heavy infestations, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always follow label instructions, safety precautions, and pre-harvest intervals (PHI).

        *   **Seed Treatment (for early protection against cucumber beetles and flea beetles):**
            *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** 3-5 g per kg of seed.
            *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** 5-7 ml per kg of seed.

        *   **Foliar Sprays (for adult beetles):**
            *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** 100-125 g per acre (0.25-0.3 g/L of water).
            *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** 100-125 ml per acre (0.25-0.3 ml/L of water).
            *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** 100-125 g per acre (0.25-0.3 g/L of water).
            *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** 100-125 ml per acre (0.25-0.3 ml/L of water).
            *   **Fipronil 5% SC:** 600-800 ml per acre (1.5-2 ml/L of water).
            *   **Malathion 50% EC:** 1.0-1.5 L per acre (2.5-3.75 ml/L of water).
            *   **Carbaryl 50% WP:** 1.0-1.5 kg per acre (2.5-3.75 g/L of water).

        *   *Note: Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage. Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.*

**2. Weevils in Pumpkin**

This is not known to affect Pumpkin as a significant field pest in Haryana. While some generalist weevils might occasionally feed on various plants, they are not recognized as a primary or economically damaging pest of pumpkin requiring specific control measures.

**3. Sawflies in Pumpkin**

This is not known to affect Pumpkin. Sawflies are primarily pests of trees, shrubs, and some specific field crops (e.g., mustard), but they are not a known pest of cucurbits like pumpkin.

**General Precautions:**

*   Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the pesticide label, including dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Avoid spraying during peak pollinator activity (e.g., mid-day) to protect beneficial insects, especially honeybees, which are crucial for pumpkin pollination.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension specialists for the most current and specific recommendations for your region and crop stage.
