As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling soil pests like termites and root-knot nematodes in pumpkin cultivation in Haryana. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is always the recommended approach, combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods.

### **General Principles for Soil Pest Management in Pumpkin:**

*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove all crop residues, weeds, and debris from the field.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** Exposes soil pests to predators and harsh weather conditions.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate pumpkins with non-host crops (e.g., cereals like maize, sorghum, or specific trap crops) to break pest cycles.
*   **Organic Matter:** Incorporate well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost, which improves soil health and promotes beneficial microorganisms.

### **1. Control of Termites (e.g., *Odontotermes obesus*, *Microtermes obesi*)**

Termites can cause significant damage by feeding on roots, stem bases, and even fruits touching the soil, leading to wilting, stunted growth, and plant death.

**a) Cultural and Mechanical Methods:**
*   **Removal of Debris:** Clear the field of any woody debris, stubble, or old roots that can serve as food sources for termites.
*   **Proper Irrigation:** Maintain adequate soil moisture, as termites prefer drier conditions.
*   **Avoid Undisturbed Soil:** Regular tillage can disrupt termite colonies.

**b) Chemical Control (Pre-sowing / At Sowing):**
For severe infestations, chemical treatment can be applied as a preventive measure.

*   **Soil Treatment (Pre-sowing/At planting):**
    *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC:** Apply 2.5 Litres per acre mixed with 400-500 Litres of water and drench the soil, or mix with sand/soil and broadcast evenly before planting.
    *   **Fipronil 0.3% GR:** Apply 10-15 kg per acre by broadcasting and mixing into the soil before planting.
    *   **Fipronil 5% SC:** Apply 400-600 ml per acre as a soil drench around the root zone at planting or during early growth stages.

### **2. Control of Nematodes (Root-knot Nematodes - *Meloidogyne* spp.)**

Root-knot nematodes are a major problem in pumpkin, causing characteristic galls or swellings on the roots. This impairs water and nutrient uptake, leading to stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, wilting, reduced fruit size, and significant yield loss.

**a) Cultural and Mechanical Methods:**
*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate with non-host crops like marigold (*Tagetes erecta*), mustard, or cereals (e.g., wheat, barley) for at least 2-3 years. Marigold is particularly effective as a trap crop.
*   **Summer Solarization:** During hot summer months (May-June), plough the field, irrigate lightly, cover with a transparent polyethylene sheet (100-gauge thick) for 4-6 weeks. The high temperature generated under the sheet kills nematodes and other soil-borne pathogens.
*   **Use of Healthy Seedlings:** Ensure that seedlings are free from nematode infestation if transplanting.
*   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporate well-decomposed FYM (20-25 tonnes/acre) or compost.
    *   **Neem Cake:** Apply **Neem Cake** at 200-400 kg per acre and mix thoroughly into the soil 2-3 weeks before planting. Neem cake releases compounds that are toxic to nematodes and also promotes beneficial soil microbes.

**b) Biological Control:**
*   **Bio-nematicides:**
    *   **Purpureocillium lilacinum (formerly Paecilomyces lilacinus):** Apply 2.5-5 kg per acre (or 25-50 g per plant) mixed with FYM or compost and apply to the soil around the root zone at planting or during early growth. This fungus parasitizes nematode eggs and females.
    *   **Trichoderma viride/harzianum:** While primarily a fungicide, *Trichoderma* spp. can also help suppress nematodes by improving soil health and competing with pathogens. Apply 2.5-5 kg per acre mixed with FYM.

**c) Chemical Control (For severe infestations):**
Chemical nematicides should be used judiciously and as a last resort, integrated with other methods.

*   **Soil Application (At planting):**
    *   **Carbofuran 3% GR:** Apply 10-15 kg per acre by broadcasting evenly in the soil and mixing well before planting, or apply in furrows at the time of sowing/planting. Ensure proper safety precautions during application.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label for specific dosages, application methods, and safety precautions.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and pest pressure.
*   Prioritize cultural and biological methods as part of an IPM strategy to minimize reliance on chemical pesticides and promote sustainable agriculture.
