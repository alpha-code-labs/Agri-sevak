Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide you with scientifically verified advice on addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium) in Pumpkin cultivation in Haryana. These deficiencies significantly impact yield and fruit quality.

**General Diagnostic Approach:**
The most accurate way to diagnose macro-nutrient deficiencies is through **soil testing**. Visual symptoms can be indicative, but a soil test provides precise information on nutrient availability and helps determine the exact fertilizer requirements. It is highly recommended to conduct a soil test before planting and periodically during the crop cycle.

### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   General yellowing (chlorosis) of older leaves, starting from the tips and margins, progressing inwards.
*   Stunted plant growth with thin, spindly stems.
*   Reduced fruit set and smaller fruits.

**Correction:**
Based on soil test recommendations, nitrogen can be supplied through soil application or foliar sprays for a quick response.

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Urea** (46% N) at a rate of 50-100 kg/acre, split into 2-3 applications. The first application can be at planting/transplanting, followed by top-dressing at vegetative growth and fruit set stages.
    *   Alternatively, **Calcium Ammonium Nitrate (CAN)** (25% N) can be applied at 90-180 kg/acre, split similarly.
    *   Ensure proper incorporation into the soil and irrigation after application.

*   **Foliar Application (for quick recovery or mild deficiency):**
    *   Spray a 1-2% solution of **Urea** (10-20 g/L of water) on the foliage. Repeat after 7-10 days if necessary. Avoid spraying during hot midday sun.

### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   Dark green or purplish discoloration of older leaves, especially on the undersides.
*   Stunted growth, poor root development.
*   Delayed maturity, poor flowering, and reduced fruit set.

**Correction:**
Phosphorus is best applied as a basal dose, as it is less mobile in the soil.

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5) at a rate of 100-200 kg/acre, incorporated into the soil before planting.
    *   Alternatively, **Di-Ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5) can be applied at 50-100 kg/acre as a basal dose. If using DAP, adjust nitrogen application accordingly.
    *   Placement near the root zone (band placement) can improve phosphorus uptake.

### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   Yellowing and browning (scorching or necrosis) of leaf margins, particularly on older leaves.
*   Weak stems and susceptibility to lodging.
*   Poor fruit development, reduced fruit size, quality, and shelf life.

**Correction:**
Potassium can be applied as a basal dose or as top-dressing.

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** / **Potassium Chloride** (60% K2O) at a rate of 40-80 kg/acre. This can be applied as a basal dose or split into two applications (at planting and during fruit development).
    *   Alternatively, **Sulphate of Potash (SOP)** / **Potassium Sulphate** (50% K2O) can be used at 50-100 kg/acre, especially in soils where sulfur is also deficient or where chloride sensitivity is a concern (though less common for pumpkin).

**General Recommendations for Nutrient Management:**

*   **Soil Testing is Key:** Always base your fertilizer applications on a recent soil test report from a reputable lab. This prevents over-application, saves costs, and protects the environment.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management (INM):** Incorporate organic manures like Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost (10-15 tonnes/acre) into the soil before planting. This improves soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability, reducing reliance on synthetic fertilizers.
*   **Proper Irrigation:** Ensure adequate and timely irrigation, as water stress can hinder nutrient uptake even if nutrients are present in the soil.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** While addressing specific deficiencies, ensure a balanced supply of all essential nutrients (macro and micro) for optimal plant health and productivity.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively manage macro-nutrient deficiencies in your pumpkin crop and achieve healthy growth and good yields.
