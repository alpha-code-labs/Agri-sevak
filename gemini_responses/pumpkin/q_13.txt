As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fruit fly and addressing the query about Ber fly in Pumpkin in Haryana.

### Control of Fruit Fly in Pumpkin

Fruit flies, primarily the Melon Fruit Fly (*Bactrocera cucurbitae*), are a significant pest of cucurbits, including pumpkin, in Haryana. Effective management requires an integrated approach combining cultural, mechanical, and chemical methods.

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Regularly collect and destroy (bury deep or burn) all infested, fallen, and damaged fruits to break the life cycle of the pest.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** After harvest, deep ploughing helps expose pupae in the soil to predators and adverse weather conditions.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid continuous cultivation of cucurbit crops in the same field.

**2. Mechanical/Physical Methods:**
*   **Pheromone Traps:** Install specific cucurbit fruit fly pheromone traps (e.g., Methyl Eugenol traps for male annihilation technique) at a density of 4-5 traps per acre. Replace the lures every 2-3 weeks for continuous effectiveness.
*   **Fruit Bagging:** For high-value or small-scale cultivation, individual fruits can be covered with paper or cloth bags to prevent egg-laying by the flies.

**3. Chemical Control:**
Chemical control should be used judiciously, preferably as bait sprays, to minimize impact on beneficial insects and the environment.

*   **Bait Sprays:** These are highly effective for fruit fly management. Mix the insecticide with a bait (like jaggery or molasses) to attract and kill adult flies. Apply droplets on leaves, not directly on fruits, preferably in the morning.
    *   **Malathion** 50 EC @ 2 ml/L of water + 10 g jaggery/molasses per litre.
    *   **Dimethoate** 30 EC @ 1.5 ml/L of water + 10 g jaggery/molasses per litre.
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8 SL @ 0.5 ml/L of water + 10 g jaggery/molasses per litre.

*   **Direct Sprays (if infestation is severe and bait sprays are insufficient):**
    *   **Spinosad** 45 SC @ 0.25 ml/L of water.
    *   **Cyantraniliprole** 10.26 OD @ 1.8 ml/L of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5 EC @ 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Deltamethrin** 2.8 EC @ 0.5 ml/L of water.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always follow the manufacturer's instructions regarding dosage, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in the pest population.
*   Ensure thorough coverage of the plant canopy during spraying.

### Ber Fly in Pumpkin

This is not known to affect Pumpkin. Ber fly (*Carpomyia vesuviana*) is a host-specific pest primarily affecting Ber (*Ziziphus mauritiana*) fruits.
