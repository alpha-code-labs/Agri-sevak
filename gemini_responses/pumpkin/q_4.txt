Wilt (including Parawilt) is a significant problem affecting Pumpkin in Haryana, causing substantial yield losses. This condition can be caused by various pathogens, including fungi (e.g., *Fusarium* species), bacteria (*Erwinia tracheiphila* causing bacterial wilt), and oomycetes (*Phytophthora capsici* often associated with parawilt). An integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods is essential for effective control.

Here's how to control Wilt (including Parawilt) in Pumpkin:

**I. Cultural and Agronomic Practices (Foundation of Control):**

1.  **Crop Rotation:** Implement a 3-4 year crop rotation with non-cucurbit crops (e.g., cereals, maize, pulses) to reduce pathogen inoculum in the soil.
2.  **Resistant Varieties:** Where available and suitable for Haryana's agro-climatic conditions, choose pumpkin varieties known for resistance or tolerance to wilt diseases.
3.  **Soil Solarization:** During hot summer months (May-June), cover moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks. This raises soil temperature, effectively killing many soil-borne pathogens, including wilt-causing fungi and oomycetes.
4.  **Raised Beds and Improved Drainage:** Plant pumpkins on raised beds to prevent waterlogging, which is crucial for managing *Phytophthora* (parawilt) and other root rot pathogens. Ensure good field drainage.
5.  **Irrigation Management:**
    *   Avoid overhead irrigation, which can splash soil-borne pathogens onto plants and create humid conditions favorable for disease development.
    *   Use drip irrigation to deliver water directly to the root zone, keeping foliage dry and minimizing soil splash.
    *   Irrigate in the morning to allow foliage to dry quickly.
    *   Avoid over-irrigation.
6.  **Sanitation:**
    *   Remove and destroy infected plant debris promptly to reduce inoculum sources.
    *   Clean farm tools and equipment thoroughly after working in infected areas to prevent pathogen spread.
7.  **Healthy Seedlings:** Use certified disease-free seeds or healthy seedlings from reputable nurseries.
8.  **Nutrient Management:** Provide balanced nutrition to plants to enhance their vigor and natural resistance to diseases. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can lead to lush, susceptible growth.
9.  **Weed Control:** Keep fields free of weeds, as they can act as alternative hosts for pathogens and compete for nutrients.

**II. Chemical Control (Use CIBRC approved technical chemicals only):**

**A. Seed Treatment (for general wilt prevention):**
To protect young seedlings from soil-borne pathogens, treat seeds before sowing.

*   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: 1-2 g per kg of seed.
*   **Thiram** 75% WS: 2-3 g per kg of seed.

**B. For Phytophthora Blight/Parawilt (Soil Drench/Foliar Application):**
These fungicides are effective against oomycete pathogens like *Phytophthora capsici*. Apply as a soil drench around the base of the plant or as a foliar spray, especially during periods favorable for disease development (high humidity, wet conditions).

*   **Propamocarb Hydrochloride** 72.2% SL: 2-3 ml per litre of water (as drench or foliar spray).
*   **Metalaxyl-M** 4% + **Mancozeb** 64% WP: 2.5 g per litre of water (as drench or foliar spray).
*   **Fosetyl-Aluminium** 80% WP: 2.5-3 g per litre of water (as foliar spray).
*   **Dimethomorph** 50% WP: 0.8-1 g per litre of water (as foliar spray).
*   **Mancozeb** 75% WP: 2-2.5 g per litre of water (as a protective spray, often in rotation or combination).

**C. For Bacterial Wilt (Vector Control):**
Bacterial wilt is primarily spread by cucumber beetles. Controlling the insect vector is the most effective way to manage this disease.

*   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: 0.5-0.75 ml per litre of water (foliar spray for beetle control).
*   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: 0.2-0.4 g per litre of water (foliar spray for beetle control).

**III. Important Considerations:**

*   **Diagnosis:** Accurate diagnosis of the specific wilt pathogen is crucial for selecting the most effective control measures. Consult with HAU experts or local agricultural extension services for proper identification.
*   **Application Timing:** Apply fungicides preventively or at the very first sign of disease for best results.
*   **Rotation of Chemicals:** To prevent the development of fungicide resistance, rotate fungicides with different modes of action.
*   **Adherence to Label Instructions:** Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the pesticide label regarding dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   **Integrated Pest Management (IPM):** Combine all suitable methods for sustainable and effective disease management.

By implementing these scientifically verified practices, pumpkin growers in Haryana can significantly reduce the incidence and severity of wilt diseases, including parawilt, and ensure healthy yields.
