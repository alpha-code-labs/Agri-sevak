As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified recommendations for the use of growth regulators and micronutrients in pumpkin cultivation in Haryana:

It is crucial to follow recommended doses precisely, as incorrect application can lead to adverse effects on plant growth and yield. Always ensure thorough mixing and uniform spray coverage.

*   **Ethephon (Ethrel)**
    *   **Purpose:** To increase the number of female flowers, leading to higher fruit set and yield in pumpkin.
    *   **Recommended Dose:** Apply **Ethephon** (39% SL formulation) at a concentration of 0.1-0.2 ml per litre of water (i.e., 1-2 ml per 10 litres of water).
    *   **Timing:** The first spray should be done at the 2-4 true leaf stage of the plant. A second spray can be given about 7-10 days after the first, if needed, depending on the desired sex expression.

*   **2,4-D (2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid)**
    *   **This is not generally recommended for use as a growth regulator in Pumpkin by HAU.**
    *   **Explanation:** While 2,4-D is a well-known herbicide, its use as a growth regulator in pumpkin for purposes like fruit set is **not generally recommended by HAU**. The margin between a growth-regulating dose and a phytotoxic (herbicidal) dose is extremely narrow, making accurate application very challenging for farmers and posing a high risk of severe crop damage. Safer and more effective alternatives are available for improving fruit set and yield.

*   **Boron**
    *   **Purpose:** Boron is an essential micronutrient vital for pollen germination, pollen tube growth, fruit set, and overall fruit development. Its deficiency can lead to poor fruit set, malformed fruits, and reduced yield.
    *   **Recommended Dose (Foliar Spray):** Apply **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (e.g., Solubor, containing 20.5% Boron) at a concentration of 1-2 g per litre of water.
    *   **Timing:** The first spray should be given at the pre-flowering stage, just before the onset of flowering. A second spray can be applied during the peak flowering and early fruit development stage, approximately 10-15 days after the first spray, especially if signs of poor fruit set or boron deficiency are observed.

Always consult with local agricultural extension officers or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and pumpkin variety.
