As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Pumpkin in Haryana:

**General Management Principles for Fungal Diseases:**

1.  **Resistant Varieties:** Where available, choose pumpkin varieties known for resistance or tolerance to common fungal diseases.
2.  **Crop Rotation:** Practice a 2-3 year crop rotation, avoiding planting cucurbits (e.g., pumpkin, gourds, melons) in the same field consecutively.
3.  **Field Sanitation:** Promptly remove and destroy infected plant debris (leaves, stems, fruits) to reduce inoculum sources.
4.  **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to improve air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce humidity and leaf wetness.
5.  **Irrigation Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation late in the day. Drip irrigation is preferred to minimize leaf wetness, especially during periods conducive to fungal growth.
6.  **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced fertilization. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can lead to lush, tender growth that is more susceptible to certain diseases.

**Specific Disease Control Measures:**

**1. Alternaria Leaf Spot/Blight (Alternaria cucumerina)**
This disease causes small, circular, brown spots on leaves, which enlarge and may develop concentric rings. Severe infection can lead to defoliation.

*   **Preventive Sprays (start at first sign of disease or when conditions are favorable for disease development):**
    *   **Mancozeb** at 2.0-2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L of water).
    *   **Chlorothalonil** at 1.0-1.25 kg/acre (or 2.0-2.5 g/L of water).
    *   **Azoxystrobin** at 200 ml/acre (or 0.5 ml/L of water).
    *   **Tebuconazole** at 250-300 ml/acre (or 0.5-0.6 ml/L of water).
*   **Rotation:** Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

**2. Anthracnose (Colletotrichum orbiculare)**
Symptoms include dark, sunken lesions on leaves, stems, and fruits, often with a water-soaked appearance. On fruits, lesions can be circular and deep.

*   **Preventive Sprays:**
    *   **Mancozeb** at 2.0-2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L of water).
    *   **Chlorothalonil** at 1.0-1.25 kg/acre (or 2.0-2.5 g/L of water).
    *   **Carbendazim** at 250-500 g/acre (or 0.5-1.0 g/L of water).
    *   **Azoxystrobin** at 200 ml/acre (or 0.5 ml/L of water).
*   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds with **Carbendazim** at 2 g/kg of seed to prevent primary infection from contaminated seeds.

**3. Downy Mildew (Pseudoperonospora cubensis)**
Characterized by angular, yellowish spots on the upper leaf surface, often delimited by veins. In humid conditions, purplish-grey fuzzy growth can be observed on the underside of the leaves.

*   **Preventive Sprays (critical during humid and cool weather):**
    *   **Mancozeb** at 2.0-2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L of water).
    *   **Chlorothalonil** at 1.0-1.25 kg/acre (or 2.0-2.5 g/L of water).
    *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride** at 1.5-2.0 L/acre (or 3.0-4.0 ml/L of water).
    *   **Cymoxanil + Mancozeb** (pre-mix) at 600-800 g/acre (or 1.2-1.6 g/L of water).
    *   **Dimethomorph + Mancozeb** (pre-mix) at 1.0-1.25 kg/acre (or 2.0-2.5 g/L of water).
    *   **Azoxystrobin** at 200 ml/acre (or 0.5 ml/L of water).
*   **Rotation:** Rotate fungicides from different chemical groups (e.g., multi-site protectants with systemic fungicides) to manage resistance effectively.

**4. Powdery Mildew (Podosphaera xanthii, Erysiphe cichoracearum)**
Appears as white, powdery patches on the upper and lower surfaces of leaves, stems, and petioles. Severe infection leads to premature defoliation and reduced fruit quality.

*   **Preventive Sprays (start at first sign of disease):**
    *   **Sulphur** (wettable powder) at 1.5-2.0 kg/acre (or 3.0-4.0 g/L of water).
    *   **Myclobutanil** at 200-250 ml/acre (or 0.4-0.5 ml/L of water).
    *   **Hexaconazole** at 200-300 ml/acre (or 0.4-0.6 ml/L of water).
    *   **Difenoconazole** at 100-150 ml/acre (or 0.2-0.3 ml/L of water).
    *   **Azoxystrobin** at 200 ml/acre (or 0.5 ml/L of water).
*   **Timing:** Early application is crucial for effective control, as established infections are harder to manage.

**Diseases Not Known to Affect Pumpkin:**

*   **Blast:** This is not known to affect Pumpkin.
*   **Brown spot:** This is not known to affect Pumpkin as a distinct major disease.
*   **Grey mildew:** This is not known to affect Pumpkin.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and strictly follow the label instructions of the specific product for correct dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Ensure proper spray coverage, especially on the underside of leaves where some pathogens reside.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension specialists or HAU experts for the most current recommendations and to confirm disease diagnosis in your specific field.
