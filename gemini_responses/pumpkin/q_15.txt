As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Pumpkin cultivation in Haryana:

### Grasshopper

Grasshoppers are polyphagous pests that can feed on the leaves of pumpkin plants, especially during their early growth stages, causing defoliation.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Maintain good field sanitation by removing weeds and crop residues, which can serve as breeding grounds and shelter for grasshoppers.
    *   Deep ploughing after harvest can expose eggs to predators and adverse weather conditions, reducing subsequent populations.
*   **Chemical Control (if infestation is severe, particularly on young plants):**
    *   **Malathion** 50% EC at 1.25 L per hectare (or 2.5 ml per litre of water for spot application).
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 200-250 ml per hectare (or 0.4-0.5 ml per litre of water).
    *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 1.25 L per hectare (or 2.5 ml per litre of water).

### Painted bug

This is not known to affect Pumpkin. The painted bug (Bagrada hilaris) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops like mustard, cabbage, and cauliflower.

### Red cotton bug

This is not known to affect Pumpkin. The red cotton bug (Dysdercus cingulatus) is a specific pest of cotton, feeding on developing bolls and seeds.

### Black ants

Black ants are generally not direct pests that cause significant damage to pumpkin plants by feeding on them. Their presence in pumpkin fields is often associated with:

*   **Honeydew-producing pests:** Ants protect sap-sucking insects like aphids, whiteflies, or mealybugs to feed on the honeydew they excrete. In such cases, controlling the primary sap-sucking pests will effectively reduce ant populations.
*   **Seed predation:** Ants can carry away sown seeds, especially before germination, leading to poor stand establishment.
*   **Nuisance:** High populations can be a general nuisance during field operations.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Maintain good field sanitation and remove weeds that might harbor other pests or ant nests.
*   **Chemical Control (if necessary, especially for seed predation or if they are tending other pests):**
    *   If ants are tending honeydew-producing pests (e.g., aphids, whiteflies), focus on controlling those primary pests. For instance, **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL at 0.5 ml per litre of water can control sucking pests, which will indirectly deter ants.
    *   For direct ant control, especially if they are removing seeds or if nests are a significant nuisance:
        *   For soil application or drenching around nests: **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 2.5 ml per litre of water.
        *   For granular application around nests or as a bait carrier: **Fipronil** 0.3% GR at 10-15 kg per acre.
