As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm that the specific rust diseases you've mentioned (Black, Brown, Yellow, White, and Red rust) are **not known to be significant or common diseases affecting Pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo, Cucurbita maxima, Cucurbita moschata)**.

These rust types are primarily associated with other crops, such as cereals (wheat, barley for Black, Brown, Yellow rust) or crucifers (White rust). While cucurbits can occasionally be affected by some general rust species, the specific types listed are not typically found on pumpkins, nor do they cause economically significant damage to pumpkin crops in Haryana or elsewhere.

Therefore, specific control measures for these rusts on pumpkin are not required or recommended.
