Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I will provide scientifically verified advice for managing borers, caterpillars, Diamondback moth, and leaf folders in Pumpkin cultivation in Haryana.

It is crucial to adopt an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods for sustainable and effective pest control.

### General Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Principles:

1.  **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your pumpkin plants (at least twice a week) for signs of egg masses, young larvae, folded leaves, boreholes in stems or fruits, and any other pest damage. Early detection is key to effective control.
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy all infested plant parts (leaves, stems, fruits) immediately. This reduces the pest population and prevents further spread.
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the field free of weeds, as many weeds can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid continuous cultivation of cucurbit crops in the same field to break the pest life cycle.
    *   **Deep Ploughing:** After harvest, deep ploughing helps expose pupae and larvae to natural enemies and harsh weather conditions.
3.  **Biological Control:** Encourage natural enemies such as parasitic wasps, predatory bugs, and birds. Use biopesticides like *Bacillus thuringiensis* (Bt) for young larvae, which are safe for beneficial insects and the environment.
4.  **Mechanical Control:** For small infestations, hand-picking of visible larvae and egg masses can be effective.

### Specific Control Measures:

#### 1. Borers (Fruit Borers, Stem Borers - Lepidopteran)

Various caterpillar species can act as borers in pumpkin fruits and stems.
*   **Cultural:** Remove and destroy infested fruits and stems.
*   **Biological:** Apply **Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki** (Bt) formulations at 1-2 g/L or 2-3 ml/L of water, especially effective against young larvae.
*   **Chemical (for severe infestations):**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC at 0.3 ml/L of water.
    *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG at 0.2-0.25 g/L of water.
    *   **Flubendiamide** 20% WG at 0.25-0.3 g/L of water.
    *   **Indoxacarb** 14.5% SC at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Cyantraniliprole** 10.26% OD at 1.2 ml/L of water.

#### 2. Caterpillars (General Leaf and Fruit Feeders)

This category includes various leaf-feeding and fruit-feeding caterpillars.
*   **Cultural:** Hand-picking of egg masses and young larvae in small areas.
*   **Biological:** Apply **Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki** (Bt) formulations at 1-2 g/L or 2-3 ml/L of water, particularly effective against young larvae.
*   **Chemical (for severe infestations):**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC at 0.3 ml/L of water.
    *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG at 0.2-0.25 g/L of water.
    *   **Flubendiamide** 20% WG at 0.25-0.3 g/L of water.
    *   **Indoxacarb** 14.5% SC at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 0.5 ml/L of water (use judiciously to protect beneficial insects).
    *   **Novaluron** 10% EC at 1.0 ml/L of water (an Insect Growth Regulator, effective on young larvae).

#### 3. Diamondback moth

*   This is not known to affect Pumpkin. Diamondback moth (*Plutella xylostella*) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower, mustard).

#### 4. Leaf folder (e.g., Pumpkin Caterpillar/Melon Worm - *Diaphania indica*)

*   **Cultural:** Hand-pick and destroy folded leaves containing larvae.
*   **Biological:** Apply **Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki** (Bt) formulations at 1-2 g/L or 2-3 ml/L of water, especially effective against young larvae before they fold the leaves completely.
*   **Chemical (for severe infestations):**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC at 0.3 ml/L of water.
    *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG at 0.2-0.25 g/L of water.
    *   **Flubendiamide** 20% WG at 0.25-0.3 g/L of water.
    *   **Indoxacarb** 14.5% SC at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Cyantraniliprole** 10.26% OD at 1.2 ml/L of water.

### Important Considerations for Chemical Application:

*   **Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the pesticide label** regarding dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and on fruits, where pests often hide.
*   **Rotate insecticides with different modes of action** to prevent the development of pesticide resistance in pest populations.
*   Apply insecticides preferably in the evening or early morning to minimize harm to pollinators and beneficial insects.
*   Consult with your local Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and the prevailing pest situation.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively manage these pests and ensure a healthy pumpkin crop.
