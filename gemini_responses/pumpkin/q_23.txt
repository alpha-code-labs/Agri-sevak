As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified seed and soil treatment processes for Pumpkin cultivation in Haryana:

### Seed Treatment for Pumpkin

Seed treatment is crucial for protecting young seedlings from seed-borne and early soil-borne diseases and pests, ensuring better germination and stand establishment.

*   **For Fungal Diseases (e.g., Damping-off, Seedling Blight):**
    *   Treat seeds with a fungicide like **Thiram** 75% WS @ 2.5-3 grams per kilogram of seed.
    *   Alternatively, **Carbendazim** 50% WP @ 2 grams per kilogram of seed can be used.
    *   For an organic approach or enhanced protection, treat seeds with a biological fungicide like **Trichoderma viride** @ 4-5 grams per kilogram of seed. This can be done after chemical treatment (if used) or as a standalone treatment.
*   **For Early Sucking Pests (e.g., Aphids, Jassids, Whiteflies):**
    *   Treat seeds with an insecticide like **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL @ 5-7 milliliters per kilogram of seed. This provides systemic protection to seedlings during their initial growth stages.

**Method:** Mix the recommended quantity of fungicide and/or insecticide thoroughly with the seeds in a plastic bag or container until the seeds are uniformly coated. Allow the seeds to dry slightly in the shade before sowing.

### Soil Treatment for Pumpkin

Soil treatment aims to manage soil-borne pathogens, nematodes, and insect pests that can affect pumpkin plants throughout their growth cycle.

*   **For Soil-borne Fungal Diseases (e.g., Damping-off, Fusarium Wilt, Pythium Rot):**
    *   **Biological Treatment:** Incorporate **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum** @ 2.5 kilograms per acre, mixed with 50-100 kilograms of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost, into the soil during the last ploughing or before transplanting. This helps in suppressing pathogenic fungi.
    *   **Chemical Drench (for severe cases or localized treatment):** If symptoms of damping-off or wilt appear, drench the soil around the base of affected plants with **Carbendazim** 50% WP @ 1-2 grams per liter of water.
*   **For Nematodes (e.g., Root-knot Nematodes):**
    *   **Biological Treatment:** Apply **Purpureocillium lilacinum** (formerly *Paecilomyces lilacinus*) @ 2.5 kilograms per acre, mixed with FYM, and incorporate into the soil at the time of planting or sowing.
    *   **Chemical Treatment (if severe infestation):** Apply **Fipronil** 0.3% GR @ 10-15 kilograms per acre, incorporated into the soil at the time of sowing or transplanting. This also provides control against some soil insects.
*   **For Soil-borne Insect Pests (e.g., White Grubs, Cutworms, Termites):**
    *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC @ 2-4 liters per acre, mixed with irrigation water or applied as a drench to the soil before sowing or transplanting.
    *   Alternatively, **Fipronil** 0.3% GR @ 10-15 kilograms per acre can be incorporated into the soil before sowing/planting, which also helps with nematodes.

**General Recommendations:**
*   Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions mentioned on the product label.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Integrated Pest Management (IPM) practices, including crop rotation, use of resistant varieties, and proper field sanitation, are essential for long-term pest and disease management.
