As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), here are the scientifically verified recommendations for the application of organic manures in Pumpkin cultivation in Haryana:

*   **Farmyard Manure (FYM):**
    *   **Dose:** 15-20 tonnes per acre.
    *   **Application:** Apply well-decomposed FYM uniformly across the field and incorporate it thoroughly into the soil at least 2-3 weeks before sowing or transplanting. This provides a slow-release source of nutrients and improves soil structure.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   **Dose:** 4-5 tonnes per acre.
    *   **Application:** Vermicompost can be used as a substitute for or in conjunction with FYM. Incorporate it into the soil during field preparation, similar to FYM, or apply it in the planting pits. It can also be used as a top-dressing around the plants during early growth stages.

*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract):**
    *   **Dose:**
        *   **Foliar Spray:** 2-3 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Soil Drench/Drip Application:** 500 ml - 1 litre per acre.
    *   **Application:**
        *   **Foliar Spray:** Apply as a foliar spray at critical growth stages:
            *   First spray: 20-25 days after sowing/transplanting (during active vegetative growth).
            *   Second spray: At pre-flowering stage.
            *   Third spray: At fruit setting stage.
        *   **Soil Drench/Drip:** Can be applied through irrigation systems or as a drench around the root zone during early vegetative growth and at flowering.
    *   **Note:** **Sagarika** is a bio-stimulant derived from seaweed extract (e.g., *Ascophyllum nodosum*) and helps in enhancing nutrient uptake, promoting root development, and improving overall plant vigour and yield.
