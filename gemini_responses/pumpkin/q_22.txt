As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), here are the recommended cultivation practices for Pumpkin in Haryana:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   Pumpkins are primarily direct-seeded in the field. Transplanting is generally avoided to prevent transplant shock, though it can be done with care for early establishment.
    *   Seeds are typically sown on ridges or beds to ensure proper drainage and prevent waterlogging, especially during the monsoon season. A pit method can also be adopted where 2-3 seeds are sown per pit.
    *   For commercial cultivation, planting on one side of a ridge or on raised beds is common.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   Seeds should be planted at a depth of 2.0 - 3.0 cm. Deeper planting can hinder germination, while shallower planting can expose seeds to birds or desiccation.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   Pumpkin plants are vining and require ample space for optimal growth and fruit development.
    *   **Row-to-row spacing:** 2.0 - 3.0 meters
    *   **Plant-to-plant spacing:** 1.0 - 1.5 meters
    *   This spacing allows for proper air circulation, sunlight penetration, and ease of cultural operations.

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   The recommended seed dose for pumpkin is typically 2.5 - 3.5 kg per acre. This can vary slightly depending on the specific variety and seed size.
