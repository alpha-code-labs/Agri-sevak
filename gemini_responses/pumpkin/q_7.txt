As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I must provide scientifically verified advice.

Regarding the diseases mentioned for Pumpkin:

*   **Dieback:** This is not known to affect Pumpkin as a specific disease. While general decline and death of plant parts (which could be described as dieback) can occur due to various factors like severe fungal infections (e.g., powdery mildew, downy mildew, Fusarium wilt), viral diseases, or environmental stress, "Dieback" as a named disease is not typically associated with pumpkins.
*   **Twig blight:** This is not known to affect Pumpkin. "Twig blight" is a disease primarily affecting woody plants and trees, not herbaceous vines like pumpkin.
*   **Tikka disease:** This is not known to affect Pumpkin. Tikka disease is a specific leaf spot disease primarily affecting groundnut (peanut).
