As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Dieback, Twig blight, and Tikka disease in Castor in Haryana:

**1. Dieback in Castor**
Dieback in Castor is characterized by the drying back of branches, starting from the tip and progressing downwards. It can be caused by various fungal pathogens (e.g., *Fusarium* spp., *Phytophthora* spp., *Botryodiplodia theobromae*) or physiological stress.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Prune and remove all affected branches well below the diseased portion. Ensure pruning tools are sterilized between cuts to prevent spread.
    *   Destroy the pruned material by burning to eliminate inoculum.
    *   Ensure proper field sanitation and avoid waterlogging, which can predispose plants to root diseases that lead to dieback.
    *   Maintain optimal plant nutrition to enhance plant vigor and resistance.

*   **Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
    *   For systemic protection and curative action:
        *   Spray with **Carbendazim** at 0.5-1 g/L of water.
        *   Alternatively, spray with **Thiophanate-methyl** at 0.5-1 g/L of water.
    *   For broad-spectrum contact protection:
        *   Spray with **Mancozeb** at 2-2.5 g/L of water.
    *   For *Phytophthora*-related dieback (if suspected):
        *   Spray with **Propamocarb hydrochloride** at 1.5-2 ml/L of water.
        *   Alternatively, spray with a combination product of **Metalaxyl + Mancozeb** at 2-2.5 g/L of water.
    *   Apply a paste of **Copper oxychloride** (30 g in 100 ml water) on large pruning wounds to prevent secondary infections.

**2. Twig Blight in Castor**
Twig blight in Castor involves the wilting and drying of twigs, often starting from the tip, leading to blighting. It is commonly caused by fungi such as *Botryodiplodia theobromae* or *Phomopsis* species.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Regularly inspect plants and promptly prune and remove all infected twigs.
    *   Destroy the diseased plant material to reduce the source of infection.
    *   Ensure good air circulation within the canopy by appropriate plant spacing.

*   **Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
    *   For systemic control:
        *   Spray with **Carbendazim** at 0.5-1 g/L of water.
        *   Alternatively, spray with **Thiophanate-methyl** at 0.5-1 g/L of water.
    *   For protective and contact action:
        *   Spray with **Mancozeb** at 2-2.5 g/L of water.
        *   Alternatively, spray with **Copper oxychloride** at 2.5-3 g/L of water.
    *   Ensure thorough coverage of the plant, especially the affected twigs and surrounding healthy tissue.

**3. Tikka disease**
This is not known to affect Castor. Tikka disease is a common name specifically associated with leaf spot diseases in Groundnut (Peanut), caused by *Cercospora arachidicola* and *Phaeoisariopsis personata*. While *Cercospora* species can cause leaf spots on Castor (*Cercospora ricinella*), the specific term "Tikka disease" is not used for Castor.
