As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the use of growth regulators/hormones and Boron in Castor cultivation in Haryana:

1.  **Ethrel (Ethephon):**
    *   **Purpose:** To increase the proportion of female flowers, thereby enhancing yield.
    *   **Recommended Dose:**
        *   **Ethephon** (39% SL formulation): 1.0 - 1.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Application:** Foliar spray. The first spray should be done at 45-60 days after sowing, and a second spray can be given 15-20 days later if required, targeting the pre-flowering to early flowering stage.

2.  **2,4-D:**
    *   This is not known to affect Castor as a growth regulator. 2,4-D is primarily a selective herbicide and its application, even at very low concentrations, is not recommended as a growth regulator for Castor due to the high risk of phytotoxicity and its herbicidal action on the crop.

3.  **Boron:**
    *   **Purpose:** Boron is an essential micronutrient crucial for pollen viability, flower development, and seed set, directly impacting yield. While not a hormone, its deficiency severely impairs reproductive growth.
    *   **Recommended Dose:**
        *   **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (containing approximately 20% Boron): 1.0 - 2.0 g per litre of water.
    *   **Application:** Foliar spray. Apply at the pre-flowering and/or early flowering stage to ensure adequate supply during critical reproductive phases.
