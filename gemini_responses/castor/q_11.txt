As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in Castor in Haryana:

### Control of Beetles in Castor

Beetles, particularly leaf-eating beetles and blister beetles, can cause significant damage to Castor plants by feeding on leaves and flowers.

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   **Hand-picking:** For larger beetles like blister beetles, manual collection and destruction, especially during early morning or late evening, can be effective in small areas.

**2. Chemical Control:**
When beetle infestation is severe and causing economic damage, chemical intervention may be necessary. Apply the insecticide uniformly, ensuring good coverage of the foliage.

*   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5 EC:** Apply at a rate of **200-250 ml per acre** in 200-250 litres of water.
*   **Quinalphos 25 EC:** Apply at a rate of **1.0 L per acre** in 200-250 litres of water.
