As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend the following doses for organic manures and bio-stimulants for Castor cultivation in Haryana to enhance soil fertility and crop productivity:

*   **Farm Yard Manure (FYM):**
    *   Apply 10-15 tonnes per acre.
    *   Ensure it is well-decomposed and incorporate it into the soil 2-3 weeks before sowing. This improves soil structure, water retention, and provides a slow release of essential nutrients.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   Apply 2-4 tonnes per acre.
    *   It can be applied at the time of sowing by mixing it into the soil, or as a top-dressing during early growth stages. Vermicompost is richer in nutrients than FYM and also contains beneficial microbes.

*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract):**
    *   **Granular Form (e.g., Sagarika G):** Apply 8-10 kg per acre at the time of sowing or during early vegetative growth by broadcasting and light incorporation into the soil.
    *   **Liquid Form (e.g., Sagarika Z+):**
        *   **Foliar Spray:** Mix 2.5-3 ml per litre of water and spray during critical growth stages (e.g., vegetative growth, pre-flowering, and pod development). Typically, 2-3 sprays are recommended throughout the crop cycle.
        *   **Soil Drench/Drip Application:** Apply 1-2 litres per acre mixed with irrigation water during early growth stages.

These organic inputs contribute significantly to soil health, nutrient availability, and overall plant vigour, leading to better yields in Castor.
