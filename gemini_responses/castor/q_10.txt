As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling borers, caterpillars, Diamondback moth, and leaf folders in Castor in Haryana:

**1. Borers (e.g., Castor Shoot and Capsule Borer - *Dichocrocis punctiferalis*):**
This pest primarily damages shoots and capsules, leading to drying of shoots and reduced capsule formation.

*   **Cultural/Mechanical Control:**
    *   Regularly inspect plants and collect and destroy infested shoots and capsules showing bore holes and frass.
    *   Prune and destroy affected plant parts during early stages of infestation.
*   **Chemical Control:** (Apply when infestation is noticed, typically at flowering/capsule formation stage)
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC**: 60 ml per acre (0.3 ml per liter of water).
    *   **Flubendiamide 20% WG**: 100 g per acre (0.5 g per liter of water).
    *   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG**: 80 g per acre (0.4 g per liter of water).

**2. Caterpillars (e.g., Castor Semilooper - *Achaea janata*, Tobacco Caterpillar - *Spodoptera litura*, Bihar Hairy Caterpillar - *Spilosoma obliqua*):**
These caterpillars defoliate the plants, causing significant yield loss if not managed timely.

*   **Cultural/Mechanical Control:**
    *   Hand-pick and destroy egg masses and early instar larvae, especially when they are gregarious.
    *   Deep ploughing after harvest can expose pupae to natural enemies and adverse weather conditions.
*   **Biological Control:**
    *   Spray formulations of *Bacillus thuringiensis* (Bt) at recommended doses, particularly effective against early instar larvae.
*   **Chemical Control:** (Apply when larvae are young and actively feeding)
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC**: 60 ml per acre (0.3 ml per liter of water).
    *   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG**: 80 g per acre (0.4 g per liter of water).
    *   **Indoxacarb 14.5% SC**: 200 ml per acre (1 ml per liter of water).
    *   **Quinalphos 25% EC**: 800 ml per acre (4 ml per liter of water).

**3. Diamondback moth (*Plutella xylostella*):**
This is not known to affect Castor. Diamondback moth is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower, mustard).

**4. Leaf folder (e.g., larvae of *Euproctis fraterna* or other general lepidopteran leaf folders):**
Leaf folders roll or fold leaves and feed from within, affecting photosynthetic activity.

*   **Cultural/Mechanical Control:**
    *   Collect and destroy folded leaves containing larvae to reduce pest population.
*   **Chemical Control:** (Apply when leaf folding is observed)
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC**: 60 ml per acre (0.3 ml per liter of water).
    *   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG**: 80 g per acre (0.4 g per liter of water).
    *   **Quinalphos 25% EC**: 800 ml per acre (4 ml per liter of water).

**General Application Notes:**
*   For all chemical sprays, ensure thorough coverage of the foliage by using an adequate volume of water (typically 200 liters per acre for field crops).
*   Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the pesticide label for safe and effective use, including dosage, application method, and pre-harvest intervals (PHI).
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance in pest populations.
