As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following for Castor transplantation in Haryana:

### Ideal Transplantation Time

The ideal time for transplanting Castor in Haryana is during the **Kharif season**, which typically falls from **Mid-July to Mid-August**. If irrigation facilities are assured, transplanting can be extended up to September.

### Ideal Transplantation Distance

The optimal spacing depends on the variety's growth habit (determinate/compact vs. indeterminate/spreading) and irrigation availability.

*   **For determinate or compact varieties:**
    *   Row-to-row: 90 cm
    *   Plant-to-plant: 45-60 cm
*   **For indeterminate or spreading varieties (often grown under irrigated conditions):**
    *   Row-to-row: 120 cm
    *   Plant-to-plant: 60-90 cm

### Transplantation Process

While direct sowing is common for Castor, if transplanting is opted for, the following process should be followed:

1.  **Nursery Raising:**
    *   Prepare raised nursery beds (approximately 1 meter wide and of convenient length) with well-drained soil mixed with well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost.
    *   Sow Castor seeds 2-3 cm deep, maintaining a spacing of 10-15 cm between seeds within rows and 15-20 cm between rows.
    *   Cover the seeds with a thin layer of soil and water gently but thoroughly.
    *   Maintain adequate moisture in the nursery beds. Seedlings will be ready for transplanting in 25-30 days, typically when they have developed 4-5 true leaves.

2.  **Main Field Preparation:**
    *   Plough the main field 2-3 times to achieve a fine tilth.
    *   Incorporate 10-15 tonnes of well-decomposed FYM or compost per acre during the last ploughing.
    *   Level the field and prepare it for irrigation and marking the desired spacing.

3.  **Transplanting Operation:**
    *   Water the nursery beds thoroughly a day before transplanting to facilitate easy uprooting of seedlings without damaging the root system.
    *   Transplant seedlings when they are 25-30 days old.
    *   Perform transplanting preferably in the late afternoon or evening to minimize transplanting shock due to high daytime temperatures.
    *   Make holes at the recommended spacing (as mentioned above).
    *   Carefully place one seedling per hole, ensuring the roots are not bent or damaged.
    *   Gently firm the soil around the base of each seedling to ensure good root-to-soil contact.
    *   Immediately irrigate the field after transplanting to help the seedlings establish.

4.  **Post-Transplant Care:**
    *   Monitor the field closely for 7-10 days after transplanting.
    *   Undertake gap filling (replacing any dead or unhealthy seedlings) within this period to maintain the desired plant population.
    *   Ensure adequate moisture is available, especially during the initial establishment phase.
