As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I advise on addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies in Castor based on scientific principles and local conditions. The most effective way to determine nutrient requirements is through a comprehensive soil test. However, if visual symptoms appear, the following corrective measures can be taken:

### General Recommendations for Castor (based on soil test values):
For optimal growth, Castor typically requires:
*   Nitrogen (N): 40-60 kg/acre
*   Phosphorus (P2O5): 20-40 kg/acre
*   Potassium (K2O): 20-30 kg/acre

### Addressing Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   General yellowing (chlorosis) of older leaves, starting from the tips and margins.
*   Stunted plant growth and reduced branching.
*   Pale green foliage overall.

**Corrective Measures:**
*   **Soil Application:** If deficiency symptoms appear, a top-dressing of Nitrogen can be applied.
    *   Apply 20-30 kg **Urea** per acre. This can be split into two equal doses, applied at 30-40 days after sowing (DAS) and 60-70 DAS, ensuring adequate soil moisture for nutrient uptake.

### Addressing Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   Purplish discoloration of leaves, especially on the underside of older leaves and stems.
*   Stunted growth, poor root development, and delayed maturity.
*   Leaves may appear dull and dark green initially, then turn purplish.

**Corrective Measures:**
*   Phosphorus is less mobile in the soil, so basal application is most effective. If deficiency is severe and observed early:
    *   **Soil Application (Basal/Early Top-dressing):** Apply 40-90 kg **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)** per acre as a basal application at the time of sowing. If deficiency is observed later, a light top-dressing of 20-30 kg **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)** per acre can be applied and incorporated into the soil, though its effectiveness will be slower.
    *   Alternatively, 125-250 kg **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** per acre can be used as a basal application.
*   **Foliar Application (for quick, temporary relief):** For immediate relief from severe deficiency, a foliar spray can be applied.
    *   Spray a 1% solution of **Monoammonium Phosphate (MAP)** (10 g/L of water) on the foliage. Repeat after 10-15 days if necessary.

### Addressing Potassium (K) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   Yellowing and browning (scorching) of leaf margins, particularly on older leaves.
*   Weak stems, lodging, and poor seed filling.
*   Reduced disease resistance.

**Corrective Measures:**
*   **Soil Application:** Potassium can be applied as a basal dose or as a top-dressing if deficiency is observed.
    *   Apply 30-50 kg **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** per acre. This can be applied as a basal dose or split into two top-dressings (e.g., half at 30-40 DAS, half at 60-70 DAS) if deficiency symptoms appear.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Soil Testing:** Always conduct a soil test before sowing to determine the exact nutrient status and tailor fertilizer recommendations. This is the most accurate and economical approach.
*   **Balanced Fertilization:** Ensure a balanced application of all macro and micro-nutrients, as an excess of one can induce deficiency of another.
*   **Application Method:** Ensure proper incorporation of soil-applied fertilizers and uniform coverage for foliar sprays.
*   **Moisture:** Adequate soil moisture is crucial for nutrient uptake by plants.
