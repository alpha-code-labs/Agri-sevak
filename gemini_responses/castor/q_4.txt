As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Wilt and Parawilt in Castor in Haryana:

It is important to distinguish between Wilt (primarily caused by a fungal pathogen) and Parawilt (a physiological disorder) as their management strategies differ.

### 1. Control of Wilt (Fusarium Wilt)

Wilt in Castor is predominantly caused by the fungus *Fusarium oxysporum* f. sp. *ricini*.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Resistant Varieties:** Cultivate wilt-resistant or tolerant varieties suitable for Haryana conditions. Consult HAU recommendations for the latest suitable varieties.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Practice a long crop rotation (3-4 years) with non-host crops to reduce soil inoculum.
    *   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris from the field to prevent the build-up of fungal spores.
    *   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure balanced fertilization, avoiding excessive nitrogen, which can make plants more susceptible.
    *   **Soil Drainage:** Improve soil drainage to prevent waterlogging, which favors fungal growth.
    *   **Soil Solarization:** During the hot summer months, cover the soil with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks to reduce pathogen load.

*   **Biological Control:**
    *   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds with bio-control agents before sowing.
        *   **Trichoderma viride**: 4-5 g/kg seed.
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   **Trichoderma viride**: 2.5 kg/acre mixed with 50 kg of well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost, applied at the time of sowing or transplanting.

*   **Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved Technical Chemicals):**
    *   **Seed Treatment:**
        *   **Carbendazim**: 1-2 g/kg seed.
        *   **Thiram**: 2.5 g/kg seed.
        *   **Carboxin** + **Thiram**: 2 g/kg seed (as a combination product).
        *   Treating seeds with these fungicides helps protect seedlings from early infection.
    *   **Soil Drench (if disease symptoms appear):**
        *   **Carbendazim**: Drench the soil around the base of affected plants with a solution of 1 g/L water. Apply 200-250 ml of the solution per plant. This should be done at the initial stage of disease appearance.

### 2. Control of Parawilt

Parawilt is a physiological disorder, not caused by a pathogen. It is often triggered by sudden changes in soil moisture, typically after a prolonged dry spell followed by heavy irrigation or rainfall, especially during high temperatures. Plants may recover partially or fully.

*   **Cultural Practices (No chemical control is effective as it's not a disease):**
    *   **Irrigation Management:** Maintain consistent soil moisture, especially during critical growth stages like flowering and capsule development. Avoid long dry spells followed by sudden, heavy irrigation. Provide light and frequent irrigations if possible.
    *   **Mulching:** Apply organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves) around the base of plants to conserve soil moisture, regulate soil temperature, and reduce evaporation.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure balanced nutrition, particularly adequate potassium, which plays a crucial role in plant water regulation and stress tolerance.
    *   **Avoid Waterlogging:** Ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging, which can also stress the plants.
