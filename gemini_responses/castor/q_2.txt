Greetings, dear farmer,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for managing rust diseases in Castor, specifically addressing the types you have mentioned.

It is important to clarify that not all rust diseases affect Castor.

1.  **Black Rust (Stem Rust), Brown Rust (Leaf Rust), and Yellow Rust (Stripe Rust):**
    These rust diseases are primarily known to affect cereal crops like wheat, barley, and rye.
    **This is not known to affect Castor.**

2.  **White Rust:**
    White rust in Castor is caused by the oomycete *Albugo ricini*. It is characterized by white, shiny, blister-like pustules primarily on the underside of leaves, which can also appear on stems and inflorescences.

    **Control Measures for White Rust (*Albugo ricini*):**
    *   **Cultural Practices:**
        *   Remove and destroy infected plant debris to reduce inoculum.
        *   Maintain proper plant spacing to improve air circulation.
        *   Practice crop rotation.
    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   For effective control, especially at the appearance of initial symptoms, consider fungicides with systemic and contact action.
        *   **Metalaxyl 8% + Mancozeb 64% WP**: Apply at 2.5 g/L of water (or 500 g/acre in 200 L of water).
        *   **Mancozeb 75% WP**: Apply at 2.5 g/L of water (or 500 g/acre in 200 L of water) as a protective spray.
        *   **Propineb 70% WP**: Apply at 2.5 g/L of water (or 500 g/acre in 200 L of water).

3.  **Red Rust (Castor Rust):**
    The primary true rust disease affecting Castor is caused by *Melampsora ricini*. The pustules are typically orange to reddish-brown, appearing mainly on the underside of leaves, leading to defoliation in severe cases. This is commonly referred to as Castor Rust.

    **Control Measures for Red Rust (*Melampsora ricini*):**
    *   **Cultural Practices:**
        *   Use resistant or tolerant varieties if available.
        *   Remove and destroy infected plant parts and crop residues.
        *   Ensure good field sanitation.
    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   Fungicides should be applied preventively or at the first sign of disease symptoms. Repeat applications may be necessary based on disease severity and weather conditions.
        *   **Propiconazole 25% EC**: Apply at 1 ml/L of water (or 200 ml/acre in 200 L of water).
        *   **Difenoconazole 25% EC**: Apply at 0.5 ml/L of water (or 100 ml/acre in 200 L of water).
        *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC**: Apply at 0.5 ml/L of water (or 100 ml/acre in 200 L of water).
        *   **Tebuconazole 25% WG**: Apply at 0.75 g/L of water (or 150 g/acre in 200 L of water).
        *   **Mancozeb 75% WP**: Apply at 2.5 g/L of water (or 500 g/acre in 200 L of water) as a protective spray.

**General Recommendations:**
*   Always ensure thorough spray coverage of the foliage, especially the undersides of leaves where rust pustules often develop.
*   Follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions when handling and applying any chemical.
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
