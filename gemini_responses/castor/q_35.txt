As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the maturity signs, harvesting time, and cutting process for Castor in Haryana:

Castor (Ricinus communis) is an indeterminate crop, meaning it flowers and sets capsules over an extended period, necessitating multiple pickings.

### Maturity Signs for Castor

*   **Colour Change:** The most prominent sign is the change in capsule colour from green to yellowish-brown or brown.
*   **Drying of Spines:** The spines on the capsules become dry and brittle.
*   **Capsule Hardness:** Mature capsules will feel hard to the touch.
*   **Stalk Drying:** The stalk of the spike (raceme) supporting the capsules will also begin to dry and turn yellowish-brown.
*   **Initial Splitting (Dehiscence):** While harvesting should ideally occur before significant shattering, a few capsules on the spike might show initial signs of splitting, indicating full maturity.

### Harvesting Time for Castor

*   **First Picking:** Harvesting typically commences 90-120 days after sowing, depending on the variety and prevailing environmental conditions. The primary spike, which matures first, is harvested.
*   **Subsequent Pickings:** Due to its indeterminate growth habit, castor requires multiple pickings (usually 3-5, sometimes more) at intervals of 15-25 days. These pickings target the secondary, tertiary, and subsequent spikes as they mature.
*   **Optimal Stage:** Harvest when approximately 50-60% of the capsules on a particular spike have matured (turned yellowish-brown to brown) to minimize shattering losses and ensure good seed quality.

### Cutting Process for Castor

*   **Manual Harvesting:** Castor is predominantly harvested manually in Haryana.
*   **Method:** The entire mature spike (raceme) is cut from the plant using a sharp knife or sickle. Care should be taken to avoid damaging the main stem or developing younger spikes.
*   **Collection:** The harvested spikes are collected and spread in a thin layer on a clean, dry surface (e.g., tarpaulin, concrete yard) under direct sunlight for drying.
*   **Drying:** Sun-drying for 3-7 days helps the capsules to dry thoroughly and facilitates dehiscence (splitting open) for easy seed extraction.
*   **Threshing:** Once dried, the capsules are threshed either by beating them with sticks or by using mechanical castor threshers to separate the seeds.
*   **Cleaning and Storage:** The threshed seeds are then cleaned to remove debris and immature capsules, dried to an appropriate moisture content (typically 8-9%) to prevent spoilage, and stored in a cool, dry place.
