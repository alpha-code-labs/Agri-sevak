As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for Castor cultivation in Haryana:

*   **Scab:** This is not known to affect Castor.
*   **Canker:** This is not known to affect Castor.
*   **Gummosis:** This is not known to affect Castor.
*   **Lichen:** This is not known to affect Castor as a disease or pest. Lichens are symbiotic organisms (fungus and alga) that grow superficially on the bark of plants. They are generally harmless epiphytes and do not parasitize or damage the plant. Their presence often indicates good air quality and a stable environment. No control measures are typically required or recommended for lichens on Castor.
