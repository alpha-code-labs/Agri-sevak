As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for improving yield, fruit quality, and storage life of Castor (Ricinus communis) in Haryana:

### Improving Yield for Castor

1.  **Variety Selection:**
    *   Choose high-yielding, disease-resistant hybrid varieties specifically recommended for Haryana's agro-climatic conditions. Consult HAU's latest recommendations for suitable hybrids.
2.  **Optimal Sowing Time:**
    *   For Kharif season, sow during July-August. Timely sowing ensures optimal growth and avoids late-season pest/disease pressure.
3.  **Plant Spacing:**
    *   Maintain appropriate plant spacing to ensure proper light interception, nutrient uptake, and air circulation. A common recommendation is 90 cm between rows and 45 cm between plants, or 120 cm x 60 cm for spreading varieties.
4.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Basal Application:** Apply 60-80 kg Nitrogen, 40-60 kg Phosphorus, and 30-40 kg Potassium per acre at the time of sowing.
    *   **Nitrogen Split Application:** Apply half of the Nitrogen as basal, and the remaining half in two equal splits at 30-45 days after sowing and at the flowering stage.
    *   **Micronutrients:** If deficiencies are observed or suspected based on soil tests, apply **Zinc sulfate** at 25 kg/acre as basal, or foliar spray of **Zinc EDTA** at 0.5 g/L and **Borax** at 1 g/L at pre-flowering and capsule development stages.
5.  **Water Management:**
    *   Castor is relatively drought-tolerant, but critical irrigation at flowering and capsule development stages significantly boosts yield. Avoid waterlogging.
6.  **Weed Management:**
    *   Weed competition is severe in the initial 45-60 days.
    *   **Pre-emergence:** Apply **Pendimethalin** at 1 kg a.i./acre (approx. 2.5-3.3 L of 30% EC) or **Fluchloralin** at 0.75-1 kg a.i./acre (approx. 2-2.5 L of 45% EC) within 3 days of sowing.
    *   **Post-emergence:** Supplement with 1-2 manual weedings, especially during the critical period.
7.  **Pest and Disease Management:**
    *   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds with **Carbendazim** at 1-2 g/kg seed + **Imidacloprid** at 5-7 g/kg seed to protect against early-season diseases and sucking pests.
    *   **Sucking Pests (Jassids, Whiteflies):** Spray **Imidacloprid** at 0.3-0.5 ml/L or **Thiamethoxam** at 0.2-0.3 g/L as needed.
    *   **Defoliators (Semilooper, Capsule Borer):** Spray **Chlorpyrifos** at 2 ml/L or **Lambda-cyhalothrin** at 0.5 ml/L upon economic threshold level.
    *   **Diseases (Alternaria Blight, Powdery Mildew):** Spray **Mancozeb** at 2 g/L or **Propiconazole** at 1 ml/L as a preventive or curative measure.
8.  **Plant Growth Regulators:**
    *   To reduce flower drop and improve fruit set, spray **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA)** at 10-20 ppm (10-20 mg/L) at the peak flowering stage.

### Improving Fruit Quality for Castor

1.  **Balanced Nutrition:**
    *   Adequate supply of Potassium (K) and Boron (B) is crucial for oil synthesis and proper seed development, directly impacting oil content and seed size.
2.  **Optimal Water Management:**
    *   Avoid water stress, especially during the capsule filling stage, as it can lead to shriveled seeds and reduced oil content.
3.  **Effective Pest and Disease Control:**
    *   Healthy plants, free from pest and disease damage, produce well-developed capsules and seeds with higher oil content and better quality.
4.  **Timely Harvesting:**
    *   Harvest capsules when they are physiologically mature (turn yellowish-brown) but before they start shattering. This prevents loss of mature seeds and maintains oil quality. Immature harvesting leads to lower oil content and poor quality.

### Improving Storage Life for Castor

1.  **Proper Drying:**
    *   Thoroughly dry the harvested castor capsules/seeds to a safe moisture content of 8-9% before storage. Inadequate drying leads to mold growth, heating, and quality deterioration. Sun drying is a common and effective method.
2.  **Cleaning and Grading:**
    *   Remove all foreign matter (chaff, dust, stones), immature seeds, broken seeds, and damaged capsules. Clean seeds store better and longer.
3.  **Storage Conditions:**
    *   Store dried and cleaned castor seeds in cool, dry, and well-ventilated godowns or storage structures. High temperature and humidity promote insect activity and mold growth.
    *   Ensure proper aeration to prevent moisture accumulation.
4.  **Pest Management in Storage:**
    *   **Sanitation:** Thoroughly clean and disinfect storage structures before storing new produce. Remove old grain residues, dust, and debris.
    *   **Structural Treatment:** Spray the walls, floor, and ceiling of empty godowns with **Malathion** 50% EC at 10 ml/L of water, 2-3 weeks before storing the produce.
    *   **Fumigation (for large-scale storage):** If insect infestation is observed in stored produce, fumigate with **Aluminium phosphide** tablets at 1-2 tablets per tonne of produce for 5-7 days under airtight conditions. Ensure proper safety precautions and professional supervision during fumigation.
    *   **Regular Inspection:** Periodically inspect stored seeds for any signs of insect infestation or mold growth. Take immediate corrective actions if problems are detected.
5.  **Appropriate Packaging:**
    *   Store seeds in clean, dry, and pest-proof bags (e.g., jute bags, woven polypropylene bags) stacked on wooden pallets to prevent direct contact with the floor and allow air circulation.
