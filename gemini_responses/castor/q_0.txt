As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Castor in Haryana.

It is crucial to initiate control measures at the first sign of disease symptoms. Always ensure thorough coverage of the plant foliage during spraying. Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Always read and strictly follow the label instructions of the specific product you are using.

Here's how to control the specified fungal diseases in Castor:

### 1. Alternaria (Alternaria Leaf Spot)
This disease is known to affect Castor (*Alternaria ricini*).
*   **Mancozeb** (75% WP): 2.5 g/L of water.
*   **Chlorothalonil** (75% WP): 2 g/L of water.
*   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC): 0.5-1 ml/L of water.

### 2. Anthracnose
This disease is known to affect Castor (*Colletotrichum ricini*).
*   **Carbendazim** (50% WP): 1 g/L of water.
*   **Mancozeb** (75% WP): 2.5 g/L of water.
*   **Thiophanate Methyl** (70% WP): 1 g/L of water.

### 3. Blast
This is not known to affect Castor.

### 4. Blight (General Fungal Blights, e.g., *Cercospora* or *Alternaria* related)
Various blights are known to affect Castor.
*   **Mancozeb** (75% WP): 2.5 g/L of water.
*   **Chlorothalonil** (75% WP): 2 g/L of water.
*   **Propiconazole** (25% EC): 0.5 ml/L of water.

### 5. Brown Spot
This condition, often caused by *Cercospora ricinella* or *Alternaria ricini*, is known to affect Castor.
*   **Mancozeb** (75% WP): 2.5 g/L of water.
*   **Carbendazim** (50% WP): 1 g/L of water.
*   **Tebuconazole** (25.9% EC): 0.75 ml/L of water.

### 6. Downy Mildew / Powdery Mildew
Both diseases are known to affect Castor (*Peronospora ricini* for Downy Mildew and *Oidium ricini* for Powdery Mildew).

#### For Downy Mildew:
*   **Mancozeb** (75% WP): 2.5 g/L of water (as a protective spray).
*   **Metalaxyl + Mancozeb** (e.g., 8% + 64% WP): 2.5 g/L of water.
*   **Dimethomorph** (50% WP): 1 g/L of water.

#### For Powdery Mildew:
*   **Sulphur** (80% WP): 2-3 g/L of water.
*   **Tebuconazole** (25.9% EC): 0.75 ml/L of water.
*   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC): 0.5-1 ml/L of water.

### 7. Grey Mildew (Grey Mold)
This condition, often caused by *Botrytis ricini*, is known to affect Castor.
*   **Carbendazim** (50% WP): 1 g/L of water.
*   **Thiophanate Methyl** (70% WP): 1 g/L of water.
*   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC): 0.5-1 ml/L of water.

**General Recommendations:**
*   Repeat sprays at 10-15 day intervals, depending on disease severity and prevailing weather conditions.
*   For specific local conditions and the most current recommendations, it is always advisable to consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts.
