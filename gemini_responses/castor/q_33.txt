Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I am pleased to provide you with scientifically verified recommendations for weed control in Castor (Ricinus communis) in Haryana. Effective weed management is crucial for maximizing Castor yields.

**General Weed Management Principles in Castor:**

An integrated approach combining cultural and chemical methods is most effective.

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Timely Hand Weeding:** Perform 1-2 hand weedings at 20-25 and 40-45 days after sowing (DAS). This is highly effective for all types of weeds.
    *   **Inter-cultivation:** Use mechanical cultivators between rows to remove weeds and aerate the soil.
    *   **Clean Seed:** Always use certified, weed-free Castor seeds to prevent the introduction of new weed species.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate Castor with non-host crops to break the weed cycle.

**Specific Weed Control Strategies:**

Here's how to address the specific weeds you've mentioned:

**1. Broad Leaf Weeds (BLW) and Narrow Leaf Weeds (NLW) (General Control):**

For broad-spectrum control of most annual broadleaf and narrow leaf weeds:

*   **Pre-emergence Application (within 3 days of sowing):**
    *   Apply **Pendimethalin 30% EC** at 1.0 kg active ingredient per acre (approximately 3.3 Litres of formulation per acre) mixed in 200-250 Litres of water. Ensure uniform spray on moist soil.

*   **Post-emergence Application (for Narrow Leaf Weeds/Grasses):**
    *   If grassy weeds emerge after the pre-emergence application, or if no pre-emergence herbicide was used:
    *   Apply **Quizalofop-ethyl 10% EC** at 50 g active ingredient per acre (approximately 500 ml of formulation per acre) mixed in 200-250 Litres of water. Apply at 20-30 DAS when grasses are at the 2-4 leaf stage.

**2. Amarbail (Cuscuta spp.):**

Amarbail is a parasitic weed that can severely affect Castor.

*   **Cultural:**
    *   Use only clean, Cuscuta-free Castor seeds.
    *   Manually remove and destroy Cuscuta patches before they flower and set seed. This is the most effective method.
    *   Avoid movement of soil or farm machinery from infested areas to clean fields.
*   **Chemical:**
    *   The pre-emergence application of **Pendimethalin 30% EC** (as mentioned above) can offer some suppression of Cuscuta germination.
    *   No selective post-emergence herbicide is widely recommended and CIBRC approved for in-crop control of Cuscuta in Castor without causing phytotoxicity to the crop. Manual removal remains the primary recommendation.

**3. Bathu (Chenopodium album):**

Bathu is a common broadleaf weed.

*   **Cultural:**
    *   Hand weeding and inter-cultivation are highly effective.
*   **Chemical:**
    *   The pre-emergence application of **Pendimethalin 30% EC** (as mentioned above) provides good control of Bathu.
    *   For post-emergence control, hand weeding is the safest and most effective method in Castor, as selective post-emergence herbicides for broadleaf weeds in broadleaf crops like Castor are limited.

**4. Congress Grass (Parthenium hysterophorus):**

Congress grass is an invasive broadleaf weed.

*   **Cultural:**
    *   Manual removal of young Parthenium plants before flowering is effective. Always wear gloves and protective clothing as it can cause allergic reactions.
    *   Encourage competitive vegetation in non-cropped areas.
*   **Chemical:**
    *   The pre-emergence application of **Pendimethalin 30% EC** (as mentioned above) can offer some initial control.
    *   For severe infestations, manual removal remains the most practical in-crop solution for Castor.

**5. Orobanche (Orobanche spp.):**

This is not known to affect Castor. Orobanche is primarily a parasitic weed of crops like mustard, tobacco, and some vegetables.

**6. Phalaris minor:**

While Phalaris minor is primarily a weed of Rabi crops like wheat, if it emerges in Castor (which is less common), it can be controlled as a general narrow leaf weed.

*   **Cultural:**
    *   Hand weeding is effective.
*   **Chemical:**
    *   The post-emergence application of **Quizalofop-ethyl 10% EC** (as mentioned above) will effectively control Phalaris minor if present.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the herbicide label carefully.
*   Ensure proper calibration of spray equipment for accurate dosage.
*   Apply herbicides uniformly in adequate water volume.
*   Consider soil moisture conditions for optimal herbicide efficacy.
