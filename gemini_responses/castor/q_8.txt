As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an integrated approach for the effective management of sucking pests in Castor, focusing on scientifically verified methods suitable for Haryana's agro-climatic conditions.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategy for Sucking Pests in Castor:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Timely Sowing:** Sow castor at the recommended time to avoid peak pest incidence.
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the field free from weeds, which can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
    *   **Balanced Fertilization:** Avoid excessive nitrogenous fertilizers, as they can lead to lush growth, making plants more susceptible to sucking pests.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation to break the pest cycle.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Protect and encourage natural predators like ladybird beetles, lacewings, and syrphid fly larvae, which feed on aphids and whiteflies. Parasitoids also play a role.
    *   **Biopesticides:** Consider using neem-based formulations (e.g., Azadirachtin 1500 ppm @ 5 ml/L of water) at early stages of infestation, especially for aphids and whiteflies.

3.  **Chemical Control:**
    *   Apply insecticides only when the pest population reaches the Economic Threshold Level (ETL).
    *   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
    *   Ensure thorough coverage of the plant, especially the undersides of leaves where many sucking pests reside.
    *   Use the recommended dosage in 200-400 liters of water per acre, depending on the crop canopy.

**Specific Chemical Recommendations for Sucking Pests in Castor (CIBRC Approved):**

*   **For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips:**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** 100-125 ml/acre
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** 40-50 g/acre
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** 80-100 g/acre
    *   **Dimethoate 30% EC:** 300-400 ml/acre (primarily effective against aphids and leafhoppers)

*   **For Whiteflies (especially nymphs):**
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** 400-600 ml/acre
    *   **Diafenthiuron 50% WP/SC:** 250-300 g/acre (for WP) or 250-300 ml/acre (for SC)

*   **For Thrips and Leafhoppers:**
    *   **Fipronil 5% SC:** 400-600 ml/acre
    *   **Spinosad 45% SC:** 60-80 ml/acre (also effective against some lepidopteran pests)

*   **For Aphids and Whiteflies:**
    *   **Flonicamid 50% WG:** 60-80 g/acre

**Regarding Psylla:**
This is not known to be a major or commonly reported pest of Castor in Haryana. However, if observed, the insecticides recommended for other sucking pests (e.g., Imidacloprid, Thiamethoxam) would generally provide adequate control.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the insecticide label carefully.
*   Observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) for any insecticide applied.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension specialists for the most current and specific recommendations for your area.
