Mites, including Red spider mite (*Tetranychus urticae*) and Rust mite (*Aceria ricini*), are significant pests of Castor in Haryana, causing damage by sucking sap, leading to yellowing, bronzing, leaf distortion, and reduced yield.

Here's how to control them:

**I. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   **Regular Monitoring:** Regularly inspect the underside of leaves for mite presence, especially during dry and warm weather, which favors mite multiplication.
*   **Water Spray:** In small infestations or early stages, a strong jet of water can dislodge mites from the plant surface.
*   **Weed Management:** Remove weeds around the castor field as they can act as alternate hosts for mites.

**II. Chemical Control (Acaricides):**
For effective control, especially during moderate to severe infestations, the following CIBRC approved acaricides can be used. Always ensure thorough coverage of the underside of the leaves where mites primarily reside. Rotate chemicals to prevent resistance development.

*   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** Apply at a rate of **0.5 - 0.75 ml per liter of water**.
*   **Propargite 57% EC:** Apply at a rate of **1.0 - 1.5 ml per liter of water**.
*   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP:** Apply at a rate of **2.0 - 3.0 grams per liter of water**. This is particularly effective against rust mites and also helps in managing powdery mildew.
*   **Fenpyroximate 5% EC:** Apply at a rate of **0.5 - 1.0 ml per liter of water**.
*   **Abamectin 1.9% EC:** Apply at a rate of **0.5 - 0.75 ml per liter of water**.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully.
*   Ensure proper safety gear (gloves, mask, protective clothing) is used during mixing and spraying.
*   Spray during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   Consult your local agricultural extension officer for the most current and specific recommendations for your region and crop stage.
