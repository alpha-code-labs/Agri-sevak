As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Castor in Haryana:

### Control of Pests in Castor

**1. Grasshopper**
Grasshoppers are polyphagous pests that can cause significant defoliation in castor, especially in young plants.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Deep ploughing during summer exposes grasshopper eggs to predators and harsh weather, reducing their population.
    *   Hand-picking and destroying nymphs and adults can be effective for small infestations.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   For effective control, spray with CIBRC approved insecticides when infestations are observed:
        *   **Malathion 50% EC** at 2.5 ml/L of water (or 1.25 L/acre).
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC** at 0.5 ml/L of water (or 200-250 ml/acre).

**2. Painted bug (Bagrada hilaris)**
This is not known to affect Castor as a primary pest. It is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops.

**3. Red cotton bug (Dysdercus cingulatus)**
This is not known to affect Castor. It is primarily a pest of cotton and other Malvaceous plants.

**4. Black ants**
This is not known to affect Castor as a direct pest requiring specific control measures. Black ants are generally not direct pests of castor; they might be present if there are other honeydew-producing insects (like aphids or mealybugs) on the plant, in which case the control should focus on the primary sap-sucking pest.
