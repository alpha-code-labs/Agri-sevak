As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following fertilizer doses for Castor cultivation in Haryana. Please note that these are general recommendations, and a soil test is always advisable for precise nutrient management tailored to your specific field conditions.

**General Nutrient Recommendations for Castor (per acre):**
*   **Nitrogen (N):** 60-80 kg
*   **Phosphorus (P2O5):** 30-40 kg
*   **Potassium (K2O):** 20-30 kg (especially on light soils or where soil test indicates deficiency)
*   **Sulphur (S):** 20 kg (crucial for oilseed crops)

**Recommended Doses of Specific Fertilizers:**

1.  **Urea**
    *   **Application:** Nitrogen should be applied in two split doses.
    *   **Dose:**
        *   If no **Diammonium Phosphate** is used: Apply 65-87 kg of **Urea** (providing 30-40 kg N) as basal application at sowing.
        *   Apply another 65-87 kg of **Urea** (providing 30-40 kg N) as top-dressing at 30-45 days after sowing (DAS).
        *   Total **Urea** per acre: 130-174 kg.
        *   If **Diammonium Phosphate** is used, adjust the **Urea** dose to compensate for the Nitrogen supplied by **Diammonium Phosphate**.

2.  **Nano-Urea**
    *   **Application:** Foliar spray.
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml of **Nano-Urea** per litre of water.
    *   Apply 2-3 sprays at critical growth stages (e.g., branching, flowering, and capsule formation).
    *   **Note:** **Nano-Urea** can reduce the requirement for conventional **Urea** by up to 50% when used effectively as a supplement.

3.  **DAP (Diammonium Phosphate)**
    *   **Application:** Basal application at sowing.
    *   **Dose:** Apply 65-87 kg of **Diammonium Phosphate** per acre.
    *   **Nutrient Contribution:** This will provide 30-40 kg P2O5 and 11.7-15.7 kg N. Adjust the **Urea** dose accordingly to meet the total N requirement.

4.  **Nano-DAP**
    *   **Application:** Foliar spray.
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml of **Nano-DAP** per litre of water.
    *   Apply 2-3 sprays at critical growth stages (e.g., branching, flowering, and capsule formation).
    *   **Note:** **Nano-DAP** can supplement or partially replace conventional Phosphorus fertilizers.

5.  **NPK (Complex Fertilizers)**
    *   **Application:** Basal application at sowing.
    *   **Dose:** If using complex NPK fertilizers (e.g., 12:32:16, 10:26:26), ensure that the total N, P2O5, and K2O supplied per acre meets the recommended doses.
    *   **Example:** To provide 32 kg P2O5, apply 100 kg of **12:32:16 NPK** per acre. Supplement any remaining N and K requirements with **Urea** and **Muriate of Potash** respectively.

6.  **SSP (Single Super Phosphate)**
    *   **Application:** Basal application at sowing.
    *   **Dose:** Apply 187-250 kg of **Single Super Phosphate** per acre.
    *   **Nutrient Contribution:** This will provide 30-40 kg P2O5 and 22-30 kg Sulphur, generally meeting the Sulphur requirement.

7.  **Potash (Muriate of Potash)**
    *   **Application:** Basal application at sowing.
    *   **Dose:** Apply 33-50 kg of **Muriate of Potash** per acre.
    *   **Nutrient Contribution:** This will provide 20-30 kg K2O.

8.  **Sulphur**
    *   **Total Requirement:** 20 kg S per acre.
    *   **Sources & Application:**
        *   If **Single Super Phosphate** is used, it typically meets the Sulphur requirement (as 187-250 kg **SSP** provides 22-30 kg S).
        *   If **Diammonium Phosphate** is used, supplement with 22 kg of **Elemental Sulphur** (90% S) or 154 kg of **Gypsum** (13% S) per acre as basal application.
