Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding Scale insects and Mealybugs in Castor. Both these pests are significant sap-suckers that can severely impact the yield and health of your Castor crop. Effective management requires a combination of cultural practices and timely chemical intervention.

Here's a scientifically verified approach to control Scale insects and Mealybugs in Castor:

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategy:**

1.  **Regular Monitoring:** Frequently inspect your Castor plants, especially the undersides of leaves, stems, and leaf axils, for early signs of these pests. Early detection is crucial for effective control.
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy heavily infested plant parts (leaves, stems) to reduce pest populations.
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the field free of weeds, as they can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
    *   **Encourage Natural Enemies:** Protect and encourage beneficial insects like ladybird beetles, lacewings, and parasitic wasps, which naturally prey on scale insects and mealybugs. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficials.

**Chemical Control (When Infestation is Severe):**

For effective chemical control, ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and stem junctions where these pests tend to aggregate. Use a sticker/spreader for better efficacy, particularly against mealybugs with their waxy coating.

Choose one of the following CIBRC approved technical chemicals:

*   **For Systemic Action (absorbed by the plant, effective against hidden pests):**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at a rate of **0.5 - 1.0 ml per litre of water**.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at a rate of **0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water**.
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply at a rate of **0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water**.

*   **For Insect Growth Regulator (IGR) Action (disrupts pest development, particularly effective against nymphs):**
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at a rate of **1.0 - 1.25 ml per litre of water**. This is highly effective against the nymphal stages of both scale insects and mealybugs.

*   **For Contact and Systemic Action (for quick knockdown in severe infestations):**
    *   **Dimethoate 30% EC:** Apply at a rate of **1.0 - 1.5 ml per litre of water**.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully, including dosage, application method, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in pests.
*   Spray during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) while handling and spraying pesticides.

By implementing these measures, you can effectively manage Scale insects and Mealybugs and protect your Castor crop. For any further specific queries, please consult your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts.
