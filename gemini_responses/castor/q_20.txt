As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I understand the critical role of micronutrients in Castor cultivation for optimal yield and quality in Haryana. Addressing these deficiencies requires a scientific approach based on soil testing and plant symptomology.

Here's how to address the specified micronutrient deficiencies in Castor:

**General Recommendation:** Always conduct a soil test to confirm the deficiency and determine the precise requirement. Foliar applications are generally more efficient for quick correction of deficiencies, especially for mobile nutrients, while soil applications provide a more sustained supply. For foliar sprays, ensure good coverage and use 200-250 litres of water per acre.

### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, small leaves (little leaf), interveinal chlorosis, particularly on younger leaves, and shortened internodes.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 10-25 kg/acre of **Zinc sulfate heptahydrate** (21% Zn) at the time of sowing or before planting.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Spray 0.5% solution (5 g/L of water) of **Zinc sulfate heptahydrate** at 30-45 days after sowing, and repeat if necessary after 15-20 days.

### 2. Iron (Fe) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Pronounced interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on young leaves, with veins remaining green. In severe cases, entire leaves may turn yellow or white.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Spray 0.5-1% solution (5-10 g/L of water) of **Ferrous sulfate heptahydrate**. For severe deficiencies, a chelated form like **Iron EDTA** at 0.1% solution (1 g/L of water) can be used. Apply at the appearance of symptoms and repeat after 10-15 days if needed. Soil application of iron is generally not effective due to rapid fixation in alkaline soils common in Haryana.

### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, thickening and brittleness of young leaves, cracking of stems and petioles, poor flower and fruit set, and malformed capsules.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 4-8 kg/acre of **Borax** (10.5-11.3% B) or 1-2 kg/acre of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (20.5% B) at the time of sowing.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Spray 0.1-0.2% solution (1-2 g/L of water) of **Borax** or 0.05-0.1% solution (0.5-1 g/L of water) of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** at pre-flowering stage.

### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, distortion of young leaves, necrosis (death) of growing points (apical buds), and poor root development.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Spray 0.5-1% solution (5-10 g/L of water) of **Calcium nitrate** or 0.2-0.5% solution (2-5 g/L of water) of **Calcium chloride** at the onset of symptoms. Repeat after 10-15 days if necessary.
    *   **Soil Application:** For long-term correction in acidic soils, liming is recommended. In neutral to alkaline soils, **Calcium nitrate** can be applied as a side dressing.

### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, starting from the leaf margins and progressing inwards, often giving a "herringbone" pattern. Leaves may become brittle and prematurely senesce.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 10-20 kg/acre of **Magnesium sulfate** at the time of sowing or as a side dressing.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Spray 0.5-1% solution (5-10 g/L of water) of **Magnesium sulfate** at the appearance of symptoms and repeat after 15-20 days if needed.

### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, similar to iron deficiency but often with small necrotic spots appearing in the chlorotic areas. Growth may be stunted.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 5-10 kg/acre of **Manganese sulfate monohydrate** at the time of sowing.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Spray 0.5% solution (5 g/L of water) of **Manganese sulfate monohydrate** at the appearance of symptoms. Repeat after 10-15 days if necessary.

Always ensure proper calibration of spray equipment and follow safety guidelines when handling chemicals. Consult your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's soil conditions.
