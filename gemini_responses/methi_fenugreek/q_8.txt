As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach for controlling sucking pests in Methi (Fenugreek) to ensure sustainable production and minimize pesticide residues.

Regarding Psylla, this is not known to affect Methi (Fenugreek) as a significant pest.

For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips, the following strategies are recommended:

**I. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies:**

1.  **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your Methi crop, especially the undersides of leaves and tender shoots, for the presence of pests. Early detection is key for effective management.
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the field free of weeds, as many weeds act as alternate hosts for these pests.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation to break the pest cycle.
    *   **Optimum Spacing and Nutrition:** Ensure proper plant spacing and balanced nutrition to promote healthy, vigorous plants that are more tolerant to pest damage.
    *   **Water Management:** Avoid water stress, which can make plants more susceptible.
3.  **Physical Methods:**
    *   **Yellow Sticky Traps:** Install yellow sticky traps (10-15 traps per acre) to monitor and mass-trap adult whiteflies, leafhoppers, and thrips.
4.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Encourage natural enemies such as ladybird beetles, lacewings, hoverfly larvae, and parasitic wasps, which prey on aphids and whiteflies. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.
    *   Consider using entomopathogenic fungi like *Beauveria bassiana* or *Verticillium lecanii* if available and suitable for your local conditions, especially for whiteflies and thrips.

**II. Chemical Control (as a last resort, following IPM principles):**

When pest populations reach economic threshold levels and other methods are insufficient, chemical control may be necessary. Always prioritize chemicals with lower toxicity and shorter Pre-Harvest Intervals (PHI) for leafy vegetables like Methi.

**Important Notes:**
*   **Always read and follow the label instructions** for specific crop approval, dosage, and safety precautions.
*   **Rotate insecticides with different modes of action** to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.
*   **Strictly observe the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI)** mentioned on the label, especially for leafy vegetables consumed fresh.
*   Apply insecticides preferably in the morning or evening to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage, especially the undersides of leaves where pests often reside.
*   Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application.

**Recommended CIBRC Approved Technical Chemicals (for Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, Thrips):**

*   **For early infestation/low population (Biological/Botanical):**
    *   **Azadirachtin** (1500 ppm or 3000 ppm): 2.5 - 5 ml per litre of water. (Acts as an antifeedant, repellent, and insect growth regulator, effective against nymphs and adults).

*   **For moderate to high infestation:**
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: 0.5 - 0.75 ml per litre of water. (Systemic, effective against a broad range of sucking pests).
    *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: 0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water. (Systemic, effective against a broad range of sucking pests).
    *   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP: 0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water. (Systemic, effective against aphids, whiteflies, thrips).
    *   **Flonicamid** 50% WG: 0.3 g per litre of water. (Selective aphicide, also effective against whiteflies).
    *   **Buprofezin** 25% SC: 1.25 ml per litre of water. (Primarily targets whitefly nymphs, acts as an insect growth regulator).
    *   **Spiromesifen** 22.9% SC: 0.5 ml per litre of water. (Effective against whiteflies and mites).

Consult your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for the most current and specific recommendations for your region and crop stage.
