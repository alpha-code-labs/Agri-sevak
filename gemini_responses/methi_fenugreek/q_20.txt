Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU), Hisar, I advise you to first conduct a soil test to accurately diagnose specific micronutrient deficiencies in your field. This will help in precise and economical application of fertilizers. However, based on common deficiencies observed in Haryana soils and their impact on crops like Methi (Fenugreek), here's how to address the potential deficiencies:

**General Recommendation:** For foliar sprays, always add a good quality spreading agent/sticker at recommended rates to ensure better absorption. Spray during the cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening).

### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

Zinc deficiency is widespread in Haryana soils and significantly affects crop growth.
*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, yellowing between veins (interveinal chlorosis) on younger leaves, and reduced leaf size.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (21% Zn) at 5 g/L of water (0.5% solution).
        *   Alternatively, spray **Zinc EDTA** (12% Zn) at 1 g/L of water (0.1% solution).
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, starting when symptoms appear.
    *   **Soil Application (for severe or recurring deficiency):**
        *   Apply **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (21% Zn) at 10-15 kg/acre.
        *   Alternatively, apply **Zinc sulphate monohydrate** (33% Zn) at 7-10 kg/acre.
        *   Apply before sowing, once every 2-3 years.

### 2. Iron (Fe) / Ferrous Deficiency

Iron deficiency is common in alkaline and calcareous soils, leading to severe chlorosis.
*   **Symptoms:** Prominent yellowing between veins on younger leaves, which can turn almost white in severe cases, while veins remain green.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray **Ferrous sulphate** (19% Fe) at 5-10 g/L of water (0.5-1% solution).
        *   Alternatively, spray **Ferrous EDTA** (12% Fe) at 1-2 g/L of water (0.1-0.2% solution).
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 7-10 day intervals, starting immediately after symptoms are noticed.
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   For severe cases, **Ferrous sulphate** (19% Fe) can be applied at 20-25 kg/acre, but foliar application is generally more effective for quick correction.

### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

Boron is crucial for cell wall formation, flowering, and seed development.
*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, thickening and cracking of stems, malformed or brittle leaves, poor flowering, and reduced seed set.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (20% B) at 1-2 g/L of water (0.1-0.2% solution).
        *   Alternatively, spray **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate, 10.5% B) at 2-3 g/L of water (0.2-0.3% solution).
        *   Apply one spray at the pre-flowering stage.
    *   **Soil Application (for severe or recurring deficiency):**
        *   Apply **Borax** (10.5% B) at 2-4 kg/acre before sowing, once every 3-4 years.

### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

Calcium is a secondary macronutrient vital for cell wall structure and overall plant vigor.
*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, distorted or curled new leaves, tip burn on young leaves, and poor root development.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray **Calcium nitrate** at 5-10 g/L of water (0.5-1% solution).
        *   Alternatively, spray **Calcium chloride** at 5 g/L of water (0.5% solution).
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays as needed.
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   Apply **Calcium nitrate** at 10-20 kg/acre as a basal dose or top dressing. For general soil calcium improvement, especially in acidic soils, **Gypsum** (Calcium sulphate) can be used, but its primary role in Haryana is often for sodic soil reclamation.

### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

Magnesium is a secondary macronutrient and a central component of chlorophyll.
*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on older leaves, often with a reddish or purplish tint, while veins remain green.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray **Magnesium sulphate** (Epsom salt, 9.6% Mg) at 5-10 g/L of water (0.5-1% solution).
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals.
    *   **Soil Application (for severe or recurring deficiency):**
        *   Apply **Magnesium sulphate** (9.6% Mg) at 10-20 kg/acre before sowing.

### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

Manganese is involved in photosynthesis and enzyme activation.
*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, often accompanied by small necrotic (dead) spots, and stunted growth.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray **Manganese sulphate** (28-30% Mn) at 5 g/L of water (0.5% solution).
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, starting when symptoms appear.
    *   **Soil Application (for severe or recurring deficiency):**
        *   Apply **Manganese sulphate** (28-30% Mn) at 5-10 kg/acre before sowing.

Always consult with your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions.
