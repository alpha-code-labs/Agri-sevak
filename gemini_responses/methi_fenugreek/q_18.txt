As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the use of growth regulators/hormones in Methi (Fenugreek) for Haryana conditions:

*   **Ethephon** (commonly known by brand names like Ethrel):
    *   The application of **Ethephon** as a growth regulator for enhancing vegetative growth or yield in Methi (Fenugreek) is generally not recommended. Its beneficial effects for this purpose are not well-established in scientific literature for Methi cultivation. It is primarily used for fruit ripening or flower induction in other crops.

*   **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid** (commonly known as 2,4-D):
    *   **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid** is a synthetic auxin that, at the concentrations typically used in agriculture, acts as a selective herbicide for broadleaf weeds. Methi (Fenugreek) is a broadleaf crop. Therefore, applying **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid** to Methi would cause severe phytotoxicity, leading to crop damage or death. Its use as a growth regulator in Methi is strictly not recommended.

*   **Boron** (as a micronutrient):
    *   **Boron** is an essential micronutrient for Methi, playing a crucial role in cell wall formation, sugar transport, flowering, and seed development. Its application is beneficial, especially in boron-deficient soils, to improve flowering and seed set.
    *   **Recommended Dose (Foliar Spray):**
        *   Apply a 0.2% solution of **Sodium tetraborate decahydrate** (Borax) at the pre-flowering stage.
        *   This translates to **2 g of Sodium tetraborate decahydrate per liter of water**.
        *   Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage. The spray volume should be sufficient to ensure thorough coverage of the crop canopy (typically 200-250 liters per acre).
