Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding mite infestations in Methi (Fenugreek). Both Red Spider Mite (Tetranychus urticae) and Rust Mite (Aceria spp.) can cause significant damage to your crop, leading to reduced yield and quality. Here's a scientifically verified approach to manage them:

**Symptoms of Mite Infestation:**

*   **Red Spider Mite:** Initial symptoms include yellow speckles on leaves, which later turn bronze. Fine webbing may be visible on the underside of leaves, especially in severe infestations. Leaves may curl downwards and eventually dry up.
*   **Rust Mite:** These mites are microscopic and cause bronzing, russeting, or a "dusty" appearance on leaves and stems. Leaves may become distorted, thickened, or stunted. Damage is often mistaken for nutrient deficiency or disease.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Mites in Methi:**

A combination of cultural practices and judicious chemical application is crucial for effective and sustainable mite control.

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Weed Management:** Remove weeds regularly, as they can act as alternate hosts for mites.
    *   **Proper Irrigation:** Ensure adequate and timely irrigation. Water stress can make plants more susceptible to mite attacks. Overhead irrigation (if feasible and not promoting fungal diseases) can help wash off mites.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation to break the pest cycle.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy severely infested plant parts or crop residues after harvest.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Conserve natural enemies like predatory mites (e.g., Amblyseius spp.), ladybird beetles, and lacewings, which feed on pest mites. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

3.  **Chemical Control (Acaricides):**
    When mite populations reach damaging levels, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always ensure thorough coverage, especially on the underside of leaves where mites reside. Rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

    The following CIBRC approved technical chemicals are effective against both Red Spider Mite and Rust Mite in Methi:

    *   **Sulphur 80% WP (Wettable Powder):**
        *   Dosage: **2.5 - 3.0 kg/acre** (or **2.5 - 3.0 g/L** of water).
        *   *Note: Sulphur is particularly effective against rust mites and also helps in controlling powdery mildew. Avoid spraying when temperatures are very high (>35°C) as it can cause phytotoxicity.*

    *   **Propargite 57% EC (Emulsifiable Concentrate):**
        *   Dosage: **1.0 - 1.25 L/acre** (or **2.0 - 2.5 ml/L** of water).

    *   **Fenpyroximate 5% EC (Emulsifiable Concentrate):**
        *   Dosage: **300 - 400 ml/acre** (or **0.6 - 0.8 ml/L** of water).

    *   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC (Suspension Concentrate):**
        *   Dosage: **120 - 160 ml/acre** (or **0.25 - 0.35 ml/L** of water).

    *   **Abamectin 1.9% EC (Emulsifiable Concentrate):**
        *   Dosage: **150 - 200 ml/acre** (or **0.3 - 0.4 ml/L** of water).

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Spray Volume:** Use sufficient water volume (typically 200-250 litres per acre for field crops) to ensure complete coverage of the foliage.
*   **Timing:** Apply acaricides when mite populations are building up, not when damage is already severe. Early morning or late evening sprays are recommended.
*   **Safety:** Always read and follow the instructions on the product label, including dosage, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and safety precautions (wearing protective gear like gloves, mask, and goggles).
*   **Resistance Management:** Do not use the same chemical repeatedly. Rotate between different classes of acaricides to prevent mites from developing resistance.

By implementing these measures, you can effectively manage mite infestations and ensure a healthy Methi crop. For any further specific queries, please consult your local agricultural extension officer.
