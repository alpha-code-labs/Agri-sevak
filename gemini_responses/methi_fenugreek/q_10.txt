As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in Methi (Fenugreek) in Haryana:

---

**1. Borers:**
This is not known to affect Methi (Fenugreek). Borers are generally not considered a significant pest of fenugreek.

**2. Caterpillars (e.g., Tobacco Caterpillar, Gram Pod Borer, Semiloopers):**
Various caterpillar species can cause significant defoliation by feeding on the leaves of Methi, leading to reduced yield and quality.

*   **Management Strategies:**
    *   **Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
        *   Regular monitoring of the crop for early detection of caterpillar infestation.
        *   Hand-picking and destroying larvae in the initial stages of infestation, especially in small plots.
        *   Maintaining field sanitation to remove host weeds.
    *   **Biological Control:**
        *   Application of bio-pesticides containing **Bacillus thuringiensis** (Bt) formulations at a dose of 500-1000 g/acre mixed in 200-250 liters of water, especially effective against young larvae.
        *   Conserve natural enemies like parasitic wasps and predatory bugs.
    *   **Chemical Control (Apply only if infestation is severe and economic threshold is reached):**
        *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC: 60 ml/acre mixed in 200-250 liters of water.
        *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG: 80-100 g/acre mixed in 200-250 liters of water.
        *   **Indoxacarb** 14.5% SC: 200 ml/acre mixed in 200-250 liters of water.
        *   **Novaluron** 10% EC: 300-400 ml/acre mixed in 200-250 liters of water.

**3. Diamondback Moth (*Plutella xylostella*):**
This is not known to affect Methi (Fenugreek). Diamondback moth is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower, mustard) and does not infest fenugreek, which belongs to the legume family.

**4. Leaf Folder:**
Leaf folder larvae roll the leaves and feed from within, causing damage to the photosynthetic area and affecting plant growth and yield.

*   **Management Strategies:**
    *   **Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
        *   Regular field surveillance to detect rolled leaves and larvae.
        *   Hand-picking and destroying infested leaves in the early stages.
        *   Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush growth favorable for leaf folders.
    *   **Biological Control:**
        *   Application of bio-pesticides containing **Bacillus thuringiensis** (Bt) formulations at a dose of 500-1000 g/acre mixed in 200-250 liters of water, particularly effective against young larvae.
        *   Encourage natural enemies like spiders and predatory insects.
    *   **Chemical Control (Apply only if infestation is severe and economic threshold is reached):**
        *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC: 60 ml/acre mixed in 200-250 liters of water.
        *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG: 80-100 g/acre mixed in 200-250 liters of water.
        *   **Indoxacarb** 14.5% SC: 200 ml/acre mixed in 200-250 liters of water.
        *   **Novaluron** 10% EC: 300-400 ml/acre mixed in 200-250 liters of water.

**General Recommendations for Pest Management in Methi:**

*   **Integrated Pest Management (IPM):** Always adopt an IPM approach, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods for sustainable pest control.
*   **Proper Application:** Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the underside of leaves where pests often reside. Use appropriate spray volume (200-250 liters of water per acre) for effective coverage.
*   **Safety Precautions:** Always wear personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals. Follow label instructions carefully, including dosage and pre-harvest interval (PHI) to ensure food safety.
*   **Rotation:** Practice crop rotation to break the pest life cycle.
*   **Consultation:** For the most current and specific recommendations tailored to your local conditions and specific pest pressure, always consult with your local agricultural extension officer or experts at HAU.
