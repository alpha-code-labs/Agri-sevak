Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling various rot types in Methi (Fenugreek) in Haryana.

Rot diseases in Methi, including Root, Stem, Foot, Collar, Crown, Neck, Seed, and Seedling rot, are primarily caused by soil-borne fungal pathogens such as *Rhizoctonia solani*, *Pythium spp.*, *Fusarium spp.*, *Sclerotinia sclerotiorum*, and *Macrophomina phaseolina*. These pathogens thrive in conditions of high soil moisture and poor drainage.

**General Control Measures for Rot Types (Root, Stem, Foot, Collar, Crown, Neck, Seed, and Seedling Rot):**

**I. Cultural and Agronomic Practices (Preventive Measures):**

1.  **Field Selection and Preparation:**
    *   Choose well-drained fields. Avoid low-lying areas prone to waterlogging.
    *   Deep ploughing during summer can expose fungal sclerotia and spores to sunlight, reducing their viability.
2.  **Crop Rotation:**
    *   Practice crop rotation with non-host crops (e.g., cereals like wheat, maize) for at least 2-3 years to reduce pathogen inoculum in the soil. Avoid continuous cultivation of Methi or other susceptible legumes.
3.  **Sowing Time and Density:**
    *   Sow at the recommended time to avoid periods of high humidity and temperature that favor disease development.
    *   Maintain optimal plant spacing to ensure good air circulation, which reduces humidity around the plant base.
4.  **Water Management:**
    *   Avoid over-irrigation, especially during the seedling and early growth stages.
    *   Use furrow irrigation instead of flood irrigation where possible, to keep the plant base drier.
    *   Irrigate in the morning to allow foliage and soil surface to dry before nightfall.
5.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Maintain balanced nutrition. Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush, succulent growth more susceptible to rot.
6.  **Sanitation:**
    *   Remove and destroy infected plant debris from the field to reduce the source of inoculum.
    *   Solarization of soil during summer can help reduce pathogen load.

**II. Chemical Control Measures:**

**A. Seed Treatment (Essential for Seed Rot and Seedling Rot/Damping-off):**
Treating seeds before sowing is the most critical step to protect against seed-borne and early soil-borne pathogens.

*   **For broad-spectrum fungal control (Rhizoctonia, Fusarium, Sclerotinia):**
    *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 2 g/kg seed.
    *   **Thiram** 75% WS at 2.5-3 g/kg seed.
    *   **Captan** 75% WS at 2.5-3 g/kg seed.
*   **For Oomycetes (Pythium spp. causing damping-off):**
    *   **Metalaxyl** 35% WS at 2 g/kg seed.
*   **Combination treatment for wider spectrum:**
    *   **Carbendazim** 12% + **Mancozeb** 63% WP at 2.5 g/kg seed.

**B. Soil Drenching / Foliar Spray (For Root, Stem, Foot, Collar, Crown, Neck Rots in standing crop):**
If symptoms appear in the field, drenching the soil around the base of affected plants can be effective.

*   **For general fungal rots (Rhizoctonia, Fusarium, Sclerotinia):**
    *   Drench the soil around the base of affected plants with **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 1 g/L water.
    *   Alternatively, drench with **Propiconazole** 25% EC at 1 ml/L water.
*   **For Oomycetes (Pythium spp.) and other rots:**
    *   Drench with **Metalaxyl** 8% + **Mancozeb** 64% WP at 2 g/L water.
*   **For Charcoal Rot (Macrophomina phaseolina):**
    *   Drench with **Hexaconazole** 5% SC at 1-2 ml/L water.

**Regarding other specific rot types mentioned:**

*   **Black Rot:** This is not known to affect Methi (Fenugreek) as a distinct disease. Black rot is primarily a bacterial disease of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower) caused by *Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris*. While some fungal rots might cause blackening, "Black Rot" itself is not a disease of Methi.
*   **Fruit Rot:** This is not known to affect Methi (Fenugreek) as a primary disease. Methi is grown for its leaves and seeds (pods are botanically fruits), but "fruit rot" is not a common or distinct disease term for Methi. The general measures for fungal rots will help maintain overall plant health, including pods.

Always follow the instructions on the pesticide label for safe and effective application, including pre-harvest intervals. For specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions, it is advisable to consult with the local agricultural extension office or HAU experts.
