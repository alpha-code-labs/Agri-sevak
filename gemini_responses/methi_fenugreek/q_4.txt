Wilt (including Parawilt) is a significant concern in Methi (Fenugreek) cultivation, leading to considerable yield losses. An integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods is recommended for effective management.

**Integrated Management Strategy for Wilt (including Parawilt) in Methi:**

**1. Cultural and Agronomic Practices (Crucial for both Wilt and Parawilt):**
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice a 2-3 year crop rotation with non-host crops like cereals (e.g., wheat, maize) to reduce soil-borne inoculum of wilt pathogens. Avoid continuous cultivation of Methi or other susceptible legumes.
*   **Deep Summer Ploughing:** Plough the field deeply during summer months to expose soil-borne pathogens to solar radiation, which helps in reducing their population.
*   **Soil Solarization:** In small areas, covering the moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks during peak summer can significantly reduce pathogen load.
*   **Proper Drainage:** Ensure excellent field drainage to prevent waterlogging, which is a primary predisposing factor for Parawilt and can exacerbate fungal wilt.
*   **Judicious Irrigation:** Avoid excessive irrigation, especially during critical growth stages. Irrigate only when necessary, based on soil moisture status, to prevent water stress (both excess and deficit) that can trigger Parawilt.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Apply balanced fertilizers. Adequate potassium (K) can enhance plant vigor and resistance to stress, potentially reducing susceptibility to wilt.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available and recommended for the region, cultivate wilt-resistant or tolerant Methi varieties.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris and diseased plants from the field to prevent the spread of pathogens.

**2. Biological Control:**
*   **Seed Treatment:** Treat Methi seeds with bio-control agents before sowing.
    *   **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum**: Apply at a rate of 5-10 grams per kilogram of seed. Mix the bio-agent with a small amount of water to form a slurry and coat the seeds evenly.
*   **Soil Application:**
    *   **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum**: Mix 2.5 kilograms of the bio-agent with 50-100 kilograms of well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost. Keep the mixture moist for 7-10 days in a shaded place, then broadcast it uniformly over one acre of land before sowing or at the time of last ploughing.

**3. Chemical Control:**
*   **Seed Treatment (Most Effective for Fungal Wilt):**
    *   **Carbendazim**: Treat seeds with **Carbendazim** at 1-2 grams per kilogram of seed.
    *   **Thiram**: Treat seeds with **Thiram** at 2-3 grams per kilogram of seed.
    *   **Combination Treatment**: A combination of **Carbendazim** (1 g/kg seed) and **Thiram** (2 g/kg seed) can provide broader spectrum protection against various seed-borne and soil-borne pathogens.
    *   **Mancozeb**: Can be used as a general seed dresser at 2.5 grams per kilogram of seed, offering protection against some seed-borne diseases.
*   **Soil Drenching (for established plants in affected patches):**
    *   **Carbendazim**: If wilt symptoms appear in patches after emergence, drench the soil around the affected plants with a solution of **Carbendazim** at 1-2 grams per litre of water. Repeat if necessary, following label instructions.

By implementing these integrated measures, farmers can significantly reduce the incidence and severity of Wilt and Parawilt in Methi, ensuring healthier crops and better yields.
