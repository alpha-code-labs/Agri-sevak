As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Methi (Fenugreek) in Haryana:

**1. Grasshopper**
Grasshoppers are polyphagous pests that can cause significant damage to Methi by feeding on its leaves.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Undertake deep ploughing during the off-season to expose grasshopper eggs to predators and adverse weather conditions.
    *   Maintain good field sanitation by removing weeds and crop residues that can serve as alternate hosts or breeding sites.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Spray with **Malathion 50 EC** at a rate of 1.0 - 1.5 L per acre, mixed in 200-400 L of water.
    *   Alternatively, spray with **Quinalphos 25 EC** at a rate of 1.0 - 1.5 L per acre, mixed in 200-400 L of water.
    *   *Note:* Always observe the recommended pre-harvest interval (PHI) for the chosen insecticide, typically 7 days for leafy vegetables like Methi, to ensure the produce is safe for consumption.

**2. Painted bug**
This is not known to affect Methi (Fenugreek). Painted bug (Bagrada hilaris) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., mustard, cabbage, radish).

**3. Red cotton bug**
This is not known to affect Methi (Fenugreek). Red cotton bug (Dysdercus cingulatus) is primarily a pest of cotton and other malvaceous plants, feeding on developing seeds.

**4. Black ants**
This is not known to affect Methi (Fenugreek) as a direct pest causing significant damage to the crop itself. Black ants are generally not considered primary pests of Methi. Their presence might indicate the presence of other sap-sucking pests (like aphids, which they tend for honeydew), or they might be foraging for food. If their presence is a nuisance, general field hygiene and removal of food sources are usually sufficient.
