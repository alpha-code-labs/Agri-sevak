As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for improving yield, fruit (seed) quality, and storage life of Methi (Fenugreek) in Haryana:

### I. Improving Yield for Methi (Fenugreek)

To maximize the yield of Methi, focus on optimal agronomic practices and nutrient management:

1.  **Variety Selection:** Choose high-yielding, disease-resistant varieties recommended for Haryana, such as Hisar Mukta, Hisar Sonali, or Hisar Suvarna.
2.  **Optimal Sowing Time:** Sow during the first fortnight of October for optimal growth and yield in Haryana.
3.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Farm Yard Manure (FYM):** Incorporate 8-10 tonnes of well-decomposed FYM per acre during field preparation.
    *   **Macronutrients:**
        *   Apply 20 kg Nitrogen (N), 40-60 kg Phosphorus (P2O5), and 20 kg Potassium (K2O) per acre.
        *   Half of the Nitrogen and full dose of Phosphorus and Potassium should be applied as basal at the time of sowing. The remaining half of Nitrogen can be top-dressed after the first cutting (if taken for fodder) or at the flowering stage for seed crop.
        *   **Chemicals:**
            *   For Nitrogen: **Urea** (approximately 43 kg/acre for 20 kg N).
            *   For Phosphorus: **Di-ammonium phosphate (DAP)** (approximately 87-130 kg/acre for 40-60 kg P2O5) or **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (approximately 250-375 kg/acre for 40-60 kg P2O5).
            *   For Potassium: **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** (approximately 33 kg/acre for 20 kg K2O, if soil test indicates deficiency).
    *   **Micronutrients:**
        *   **Zinc (Zn):** Apply 10-20 kg of **Zinc sulphate** per acre as a basal application, or a foliar spray of 0.5% **Zinc sulphate** (5 g/L water) at pre-flowering stage if deficiency symptoms appear.
        *   **Boron (B):** Apply 5-10 kg of **Borax** (Disodium tetraborate decahydrate) per acre as a basal application, or a foliar spray of 0.2% **Borax** (2 g/L water) at the pre-flowering stage.
4.  **Water Management:** Provide 3-4 irrigations depending on soil type and weather conditions. Critical stages for irrigation are branching, flowering, and pod development. Avoid waterlogging.
5.  **Weed Management:**
    *   Perform 1-2 manual weedings within 30-45 days after sowing.
    *   **Chemical:** For pre-emergence weed control, apply **Pendimethalin** at 1.0-1.5 kg active ingredient per acre (e.g., 3.3-5 L of 30% EC formulation) within 2-3 days after sowing, before weed emergence.
6.  **Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs):**
    *   **Chemical:** To enhance flowering and pod setting, a foliar spray of **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA)** at 20-40 ppm (0.02-0.04 g/L water) can be applied at the pre-flowering stage.

### II. Improving Fruit (Seed) Quality for Methi (Fenugreek)

For Methi, "fruit quality" primarily refers to the quality of the seeds (size, plumpness, color, aroma, and viability).

1.  **Balanced Nutrition:** Adequate supply of Phosphorus, Potassium, and Boron is crucial for proper seed development, leading to plump and well-filled seeds. Refer to the nutrient management section above.
2.  **Optimal Water Management:** Ensure adequate moisture during the pod development and seed filling stages. Water stress during these periods can lead to shriveled and poor-quality seeds.
3.  **Timely Harvesting:** Harvest the crop when pods turn yellowish-brown and seeds are fully mature but before they start shattering. Premature harvesting leads to immature, shriveled seeds, while delayed harvesting results in shattering losses and discolored seeds.
4.  **Proper Drying:** After harvesting, dry the pods/plants in the sun for 3-4 days to reduce moisture content before threshing. This prevents fungal growth and maintains seed color and viability.

### III. Improving Storage Life for Methi (Fenugreek)

The storage life of Methi primarily refers to its seeds. Proper post-harvest handling and storage conditions are vital to prevent spoilage and maintain viability.

1.  **Thorough Drying:** This is the most critical step. Dry the seeds to a safe moisture content of 8-10% before storage. Higher moisture content promotes fungal growth, insect infestation, and loss of viability.
2.  **Cleaning and Grading:** Clean the seeds thoroughly to remove all impurities such as chaff, dust, broken seeds, and weed seeds. Grading can further separate healthy, plump seeds from shriveled ones.
3.  **Storage Environment:**
    *   Store seeds in a cool, dry, dark, and well-ventilated place.
    *   Use airtight containers or bags (e.g., jute bags lined with polythene) to protect against moisture re-absorption and pests.
    *   Ensure the storage area is free from rodents and birds.
4.  **Pest Management in Storage:**
    *   **Fumigation:** For large-scale storage, fumigation can be done using **Aluminium phosphide** tablets. Use 1-2 tablets (3g each) per tonne of grain, ensuring the storage structure is airtight for effective fumigation. Follow safety guidelines strictly.
    *   **Protectants:** For bag storage, seeds can be mixed with **Malathion** 5% dust at a rate of 250 g per 100 kg of seeds. Ensure even mixing.
    *   Regularly inspect stored seeds for any signs of pest infestation or fungal growth.
