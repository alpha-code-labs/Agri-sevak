As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following fertilizer doses for Methi (Fenugreek) cultivation in Haryana. These recommendations are based on scientific research and aim for optimal yield and quality, while considering Methi's nature as a legume.

**General Nutrient Requirement for Methi (Fenugreek):**
For optimal growth and yield, Methi typically requires:
*   Nitrogen (N): 15-20 kg/acre
*   Phosphorus (P2O5): 40-60 kg/acre
*   Potassium (K2O): 20-30 kg/acre
*   Sulphur (S): 20 kg/acre

These nutrients can be supplied using various fertilizers as detailed below. It is highly recommended to conduct a soil test for precise recommendations tailored to your specific field conditions.

**Basal Application (at the time of sowing):**

*   **DAP (Di-ammonium Phosphate)**:
    *   Recommended dose: **90-100 kg/acre**.
    *   This provides approximately 16-18 kg of Nitrogen (N) and 41-46 kg of Phosphorus (P2O5) per acre, effectively covering most of the phosphorus requirement and a significant portion of the nitrogen starter dose.

*   **SSP (Single Super Phosphate)**:
    *   If DAP is not used, SSP can be a primary source of Phosphorus and Sulphur.
    *   Recommended dose: **250 kg/acre**.
    *   This provides approximately 40 kg of Phosphorus (P2O5) and 27.5 kg of Sulphur (S) per acre. If using SSP, additional Urea will be required to meet the full Nitrogen requirement.

*   **Urea**:
    *   If **DAP** is used at 90-100 kg/acre, a supplementary dose of **10-15 kg/acre** of Urea may be applied at sowing to meet the full starter N requirement.
    *   If **SSP** is used, a higher dose of **40-45 kg/acre** of Urea will be required at sowing to meet the full N requirement.
    *   A light top-dressing of **10-15 kg/acre** of Urea can be given 30-40 days after sowing, especially if initial growth is poor or soil nitrogen is low (based on soil test).

*   **Potash (Muriate of Potash - MOP)**:
    *   Recommended dose: **35-40 kg/acre**.
    *   This provides approximately 21-24 kg of Potassium (K2O) per acre. Apply at the time of sowing.

*   **Sulphur (Bentonite Sulphur 90%)**:
    *   Sulphur is crucial for Methi, especially for seed quality, oil content, and yield.
    *   Recommended dose: **20-25 kg/acre**.
    *   Apply at the time of sowing. If **SSP** is used, it provides sufficient sulphur, and additional Bentonite Sulphur may not be needed.

*   **NPK (Complex Fertilizers, e.g., 12:32:16)**:
    *   As an alternative to individual fertilizers, a complex NPK fertilizer can be used.
    *   Recommended dose: **125 kg/acre** of NPK (12:32:16).
    *   This provides approximately 15 kg N, 40 kg P2O5, and 20 kg K2O per acre. A supplementary dose of **10-15 kg/acre** of Urea and **20-25 kg/acre** of Sulphur (if not using SSP) would still be beneficial to meet the full nutrient requirements.

**Foliar Application (Supplementary):**
Nano fertilizers are designed for foliar application to supplement nutrient uptake and are not a complete replacement for basal granular fertilizers.

*   **Nano-Urea**:
    *   Recommended dose: **2-4 ml/L** of water.
    *   Apply as a foliar spray at critical growth stages, typically 30-40 days after sowing and again before flowering, if required, to supplement nitrogen nutrition.

*   **Nano-DAP**:
    *   Recommended dose: **2-4 ml/L** of water.
    *   Apply as a foliar spray at critical growth stages, typically 30-40 days after sowing and again before flowering, to supplement phosphorus and nitrogen nutrition. It can also be used for seed treatment.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Soil Testing:** Always conduct a soil test to determine the exact nutrient status of your field. This will allow for precise and economical fertilizer application, preventing over- or under-application.
*   **Application Method:** All granular basal fertilizers should be broadcast evenly and thoroughly incorporated into the soil before sowing for best results.
*   **Watering:** Ensure adequate soil moisture at the time of fertilizer application and subsequent irrigation for proper nutrient uptake.
