Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I advise that addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies in Methi (Fenugreek) requires a scientific approach, ideally beginning with a soil test to accurately diagnose the specific nutrient status of your field. However, based on visual symptoms, here's how you can address Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium deficiencies:

**General Principles:**
*   **Soil Testing:** Always the first and most crucial step for precise nutrient management.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management (INM):** Combine chemical fertilizers with organic manures (Farm Yard Manure, compost) and bio-fertilizers (Rhizobium for Methi) for sustainable soil health and nutrient availability.
*   **Foliar vs. Soil Application:** Foliar applications provide quick relief for immediate symptoms but are generally temporary. Soil applications are essential for long-term correction and building soil fertility.

### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   General yellowing or pale green colour of older leaves.
*   Stunted growth and reduced leaf size.
*   Poor branching and overall vigour.

**Correction Measures:**
Methi is a legume and fixes atmospheric nitrogen through root nodules. Therefore, excessive nitrogen application can inhibit nodulation. However, a starter dose is often beneficial, and if deficiency symptoms appear, targeted application is needed.

*   **Foliar Application (for quick relief):**
    *   Spray 0.5-1.0% solution of **Urea** (5-10 g/L of water).
    *   Alternatively, spray 0.5-1.0% solution of **Potassium Nitrate** (5-10 g/L of water), which also provides potassium.
    *   Apply 200-300 litres of spray solution per acre, ensuring good leaf coverage. Repeat after 7-10 days if symptoms persist.
*   **Soil Application (if severe and early in growth):**
    *   Apply 10-15 kg/acre of **Urea** as a top-dressing, ensuring it is lightly incorporated into the soil and followed by irrigation. This should be done cautiously to avoid inhibiting nodulation.

### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   Purplish or reddish discoloration on the underside of older leaves and stems.
*   Stunted growth, particularly root development.
*   Delayed maturity and poor seed formation.
*   Leaves may appear dull and dark green initially, then develop purplish tints.

**Correction Measures:**
Phosphorus is less mobile in the soil, so soil application is generally more effective for long-term correction.

*   **Foliar Application (for quick boost):**
    *   Spray 0.5-1.0% solution of **Mono-ammonium Phosphate (MAP)** (5-10 g/L of water).
    *   Alternatively, spray 0.5-1.0% solution of **Potassium Phosphate** (e.g., Mono Potassium Phosphate) (5-10 g/L of water), which also provides potassium.
    *   Apply 200-300 litres of spray solution per acre. Repeat after 7-10 days if necessary.
*   **Soil Application (for long-term correction):**
    *   If deficiency is observed early in the crop cycle and soil test confirms low P, a light top-dressing of 20-30 kg/acre of **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** can be applied and lightly incorporated, followed by irrigation. However, phosphorus is most efficiently utilized when applied basally at sowing.

### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   Yellowing and browning (scorching or necrosis) of leaf margins, especially on older leaves.
*   Weak stems, lodging, and reduced resistance to diseases and stress.
*   Poor development of seeds/pods.

**Correction Measures:**

*   **Foliar Application (for quick relief):**
    *   Spray 0.5-1.0% solution of **Potassium Nitrate** (5-10 g/L of water).
    *   Alternatively, spray 0.5-1.0% solution of **Sulphate of Potash (SOP)** / **Potassium Sulphate** (5-10 g/L of water).
    *   Apply 200-300 litres of spray solution per acre. Repeat after 7-10 days if symptoms persist.
*   **Soil Application (for long-term correction):**
    *   Apply 15-25 kg/acre of **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** / **Potassium Chloride** or **Sulphate of Potash (SOP)** / **Potassium Sulphate** as a top-dressing. Ensure it is lightly incorporated into the soil and followed by irrigation.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Timing of Foliar Sprays:** Apply foliar sprays during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to prevent leaf scorching and maximize absorption.
*   **Water Quality:** Use clean water for spraying.
*   **Organic Matter:** Regular addition of organic matter (FYM, compost) improves soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability, reducing the incidence of deficiencies.
*   **Bio-fertilizers:** Inoculation with **Rhizobium** bio-fertilizer at sowing is highly recommended for Methi to enhance nitrogen fixation.

Always consult your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts with your soil test reports for the most precise and tailored recommendations for your specific field conditions.
