Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm that Scale insects and Mealybugs can occasionally infest Methi (Fenugreek), especially under favorable conditions or in fields with a history of these pests. While not always primary pests, their presence can significantly impact plant health and yield.

Here's a scientifically verified approach to control Scale insects and Mealybugs in Methi:

**1. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Approach:**
A combination of cultural, biological, and chemical methods is most effective for sustainable control.

*   **Regular Scouting:** Frequently inspect your Methi plants, especially the undersides of leaves and stem joints, for early signs of these pests. Early detection is key to effective management.
*   **Manual Removal:** For small infestations, physically remove and destroy infested leaves or plant parts. A strong jet of water can dislodge mealybugs.
*   **Weed Management:** Keep the field free of weeds, as they can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
*   **Proper Plant Nutrition:** Ensure balanced fertilization. Over-fertilization with nitrogen can sometimes make plants more susceptible to sucking pests.
*   **Biological Control:** Encourage natural enemies like ladybird beetles, lacewings, and parasitic wasps, which prey on mealybugs and scale insects. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

**2. Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved Technical Chemicals):**
When infestations are severe and other methods are insufficient, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always follow the recommended dosages and safety precautions, including wearing protective gear and observing the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI).

For effective control of Scale insects and Mealybugs in Methi, consider the following CIBRC approved technical chemicals:

*   **For Mealybugs and Scale Insects:**
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at a rate of **1.0 - 1.25 litres per acre** (or **2.0 - 2.5 ml per litre** of water). This is an insect growth regulator that interferes with molting.
    *   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:** Apply at a rate of **200 - 250 ml per acre** (or **0.4 - 0.5 ml per litre** of water). This is a systemic insecticide effective against various sucking pests, including mealybugs and scales.
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at a rate of **100 - 125 ml per acre** (or **0.2 - 0.25 ml per litre** of water). This is a systemic neonicotinoid insecticide effective against sucking pests.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at a rate of **100 g per acre** (or **0.2 g per litre** of water). Another systemic neonicotinoid effective against sucking pests.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Rotation of Chemicals:** To prevent the development of resistance, rotate insecticides with different modes of action. Do not use the same chemical repeatedly.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and stem joints where these pests tend to hide.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always check the label for the specific Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) for the chosen chemical on leafy vegetables like Methi. This is the minimum time required between the last spray and harvest to ensure the produce is safe for consumption.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying. Follow all instructions on the product label.
