As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Methi (Fenugreek) in Haryana.

**General Cultural Practices for Fungal Disease Management:**

*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice a 2-3 year crop rotation with non-host crops to break the disease cycle.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest to reduce inoculum for the next season.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available, choose disease-resistant or tolerant varieties suitable for the Haryana region.
*   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds with recommended fungicides before sowing to prevent seed-borne diseases.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Maintain adequate plant spacing to ensure good air circulation, which reduces humidity and fungal growth.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can promote lush growth susceptible to diseases.
*   **Irrigation Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation late in the day, as wet foliage overnight can favor fungal development. Irrigate in the morning.

**Specific Control Measures for Fungal Diseases in Methi (Fenugreek):**

### 1. Alternaria Leaf Spot/Blight (Caused by *Alternaria* species)

This disease causes small, circular to irregular brown spots with concentric rings, often leading to blighting of leaves.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Spray with **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L of water).
    *   Alternatively, spray with **Chlorothalonil** (75% WP) at 2 kg/acre (or 2 g/L of water).
    *   For systemic action, use **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC) at 200 ml/acre (or 0.2 ml/L of water).

### 2. Anthracnose (Caused by *Colletotrichum* species)

Symptoms include dark, sunken lesions on leaves, stems, and pods, often with pinkish spore masses in humid conditions.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Spray with **Carbendazim** (50% WP) at 500 g/acre (or 0.5 g/L of water).
    *   Alternatively, spray with **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L of water).
    *   For broad-spectrum control, **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC) at 200 ml/acre (or 0.2 ml/L of water) can be effective.

### 3. Blast

This is not known to affect Methi (Fenugreek).

### 4. Blight / Brown Spot (Often caused by *Cercospora* species or *Alternaria* species)

While Alternaria blight is covered above, *Cercospora leaf spot* (often appearing as brown spots or blight) is also common, causing circular to angular brown spots with distinct margins.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Spray with **Carbendazim** (50% WP) at 500 g/acre (or 0.5 g/L of water).
    *   Alternatively, spray with **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L of water).
    *   **Chlorothalonil** (75% WP) at 2 kg/acre (or 2 g/L of water) is also effective.

### 5. Downy Mildew (Caused by *Peronospora trigonellae*)

Characterized by yellowish patches on the upper leaf surface and a grayish-purple, fuzzy growth on the corresponding lower surface.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Spray with a combination product of **Metalaxyl 8% + Mancozeb 64% WP** at 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L of water).
    *   Alternatively, spray with **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L of water) as a protectant.
    *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC) at 200 ml/acre (or 0.2 ml/L of water) also provides control.

### 6. Powdery Mildew (Caused by *Erysiphe polygoni* or *Leveillula taurica*)

Appears as white, powdery patches on leaves, stems, and sometimes pods, leading to yellowing and premature defoliation.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Spray with **Sulphur** (80% WP) at 2 kg/acre (or 2 g/L of water). Ensure good coverage.
    *   Alternatively, spray with **Tebuconazole** (25.9% EC) at 250-300 ml/acre (or 0.25-0.3 ml/L of water).
    *   **Myclobutanil** (10% WP) at 400-500 g/acre (or 0.4-0.5 g/L of water) is also highly effective.
    *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC) at 200 ml/acre (or 0.2 ml/L of water) can also be used.

### 7. Grey Mildew

This is not known to affect Methi (Fenugreek). (Note: Grey mold, caused by *Botrytis cinerea*, is a different disease and is not typically referred to as "grey mildew").

**Important Considerations for Chemical Application:**

*   Always read and follow the label instructions for any pesticide product.
*   Ensure thorough coverage of the plant foliage during spraying.
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
*   Observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) specified on the label before harvesting the crop.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension specialists for the most current and specific recommendations for your farm.
