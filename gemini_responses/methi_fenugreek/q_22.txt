As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following cultivation practices for Methi (Fenugreek) in Haryana:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   For optimal growth, ease of intercultural operations (like weeding), and better yield, **row sowing** is highly recommended.
    *   Broadcasting can be done for leafy vegetable production, but row sowing is generally superior for both leafy greens and seed production.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   Seeds should be sown at a shallow depth of **2-3 cm**. Deeper sowing can lead to poor germination and emergence.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   **Row-to-row spacing:** Maintain a distance of **20-30 cm** between rows. For leafy vegetable production, 20-25 cm is often preferred, while for seed production, 25-30 cm allows for better plant development.
    *   **Plant-to-plant spacing:** After emergence, thin the plants to maintain a distance of **5-10 cm** within the row. This ensures adequate space for individual plant growth and reduces competition.

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   **For leafy vegetable (vegetable purpose):** A higher seed rate is used to obtain a dense stand for multiple cuttings. Recommended seed dose is **40-50 kg per acre**.
    *   **For seed production:** A lower seed rate is used to allow individual plants to develop fully and produce more seeds. Recommended seed dose is **20-25 kg per acre**.
