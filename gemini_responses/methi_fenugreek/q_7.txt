As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I must provide scientifically verified advice specific to Methi (Fenugreek) in Haryana.

Based on current scientific understanding and documented plant pathology for Methi (Fenugreek):

*   **Dieback:** This is not known to affect Methi (Fenugreek). Dieback is typically a term used for the progressive death of twigs and branches in woody plants, which is not characteristic of herbaceous crops like Methi.
*   **Twig blight:** This is not known to affect Methi (Fenugreek). Similar to dieback, twig blight refers to diseases affecting the twigs of woody plants, which Methi does not possess.
*   **Tikka disease:** This is not known to affect Methi (Fenugreek). Tikka disease is a specific and well-known leaf spot disease primarily affecting Groundnut (Peanut). While Methi can suffer from leaf spot diseases (e.g., Cercospora leaf spot, Alternaria leaf spot), they are distinct from "Tikka disease."
