As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling soil pests like termites and root-knot nematodes in Methi (Fenugreek) in Haryana.

Both termites and root-knot nematodes are significant soil pests that can severely impact Methi yield and plant health. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods, is recommended for effective and sustainable control.

### Control of Termites in Methi (Fenugreek)

Termites (e.g., *Odontotermes obesus*, *Microtermes obesi*) can cause significant damage by feeding on roots and stems, leading to wilting and plant death.

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Deep Ploughing:** Deep summer ploughing helps expose termite colonies to the sun and predators.
*   **Removal of Crop Residues:** Remove stubble and other organic debris from the field, as these can serve as food sources for termites.
*   **Proper Irrigation:** Maintain adequate soil moisture, as termites prefer dry conditions. Avoid water stress in plants.

**2. Chemical Control (Pre-sowing/Sowing):**
*   **Soil Treatment:**
    *   Apply **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** at 2.5 litres per acre, mixed in 400-500 litres of water, and drench the soil or apply through irrigation before sowing.
    *   Alternatively, broadcast **Fipronil 0.3% GR** at 10-15 kg per acre and incorporate it into the soil before sowing.

**3. Chemical Control (Post-emergence, if infestation observed):**
*   **Spot Drenching:** For localized infestations, drench the soil around the base of affected plants with **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** at 4 ml per litre of water.

### Control of Nematodes (Root-knot) in Methi (Fenugreek)

Root-knot nematodes (*Meloidogyne* spp.) cause characteristic galls or knots on roots, leading to stunted growth, yellowing, wilting, and reduced yield.

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops like cereals (e.g., maize, sorghum, wheat) for at least 2-3 years to reduce nematode populations in the soil. Avoid continuous cultivation of susceptible crops.
*   **Summer Ploughing:** Deep summer ploughing during hot months exposes nematode eggs and larvae to direct sunlight, desiccating and killing them.
*   **Organic Matter Incorporation:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost into the soil. This improves soil health and promotes beneficial microorganisms that can suppress nematodes.
*   **Solarization:** In small plots, soil solarization (covering moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets during hot summer months for 4-6 weeks) can effectively reduce nematode populations.

**2. Biological Control:**
*   **Bio-nematicides:** Apply biological agents like *Paecilomyces lilacinus* or *Purpureocillium lilacinum* (available as commercial formulations) as soil application or seed treatment as per manufacturer's recommendations. These fungi parasitize nematode eggs and females.

**3. Chemical Control (at sowing):**
*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Carbofuran 3% G** at 10-15 kg per acre in furrows at the time of sowing and lightly cover with soil.
    *   Alternatively, **Neem cake** can be applied at 200-400 kg per acre and incorporated into the soil 2-3 weeks before sowing. Neem cake has nematicidal properties and also improves soil fertility.
    *   **Fipronil 0.3% GR** at 10-15 kg per acre, broadcast and incorporated into the soil before sowing, can also offer some suppression against nematodes in addition to termite control.

Always follow the instructions on the product label for safe and effective use of chemical pesticides.
