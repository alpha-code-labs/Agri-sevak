As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified seed and soil treatment processes for Methi (Fenugreek) cultivation in Haryana:

### Recommended Seed Treatment Process for Methi (Fenugreek)

Seed treatment is crucial for protecting Methi seeds from seed-borne and early soil-borne diseases, providing initial protection against sucking pests, and enhancing nutrient uptake through biological means.

**Order of Application:** Fungicide $\rightarrow$ Insecticide $\rightarrow$ Bio-fertilizer/Bio-fungicide

1.  **Fungicidal Treatment:**
    *   **Purpose:** To protect against damping-off, root rot, and other seed-borne fungal diseases.
    *   **Chemicals:**
        *   **Carbendazim 50% WP** at 2 g per kg of seed.
        *   OR **Thiram 75% WS** at 2.5 g per kg of seed.
        *   OR **Carboxin 37.5% + Thiram 37.5% DS** at 2.5 g per kg of seed.
    *   **Application:** Mix the chosen fungicide thoroughly with the seeds until they are uniformly coated. Allow the seeds to dry in the shade before proceeding.

2.  **Insecticidal Treatment (Optional, but recommended if early pest incidence is expected):**
    *   **Purpose:** To provide early protection against sucking pests like aphids and thrips during the seedling stage.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   **Imidacloprid 70% WS** at 5-7 g per kg of seed.
    *   **Application:** Apply this after the fungicidal treatment. Mix thoroughly with the seeds and allow them to dry completely in the shade.

3.  **Bio-fertilizer Treatment:**
    *   **Purpose:** Essential for nitrogen fixation in legumes, improving soil fertility and promoting healthy plant growth.
    *   **Biological:**
        *   **Rhizobium culture** at 200-250 g for 10-15 kg of seed.
    *   **Application:** Prepare a slurry by dissolving 100 g of jaggery (gur) in 1 litre of water, then mix the **Rhizobium culture** into this solution. Coat the fungicide and insecticide-treated seeds uniformly with this slurry. Dry the seeds thoroughly in the shade before sowing.

4.  **Bio-fungicide Treatment (Optional, for enhanced disease suppression):**
    *   **Purpose:** Provides additional protection against soil-borne fungal pathogens and promotes plant health.
    *   **Biological:**
        *   **Trichoderma viride** at 5-10 g per kg of seed.
    *   **Application:** This can be applied along with the **Rhizobium culture** slurry or separately after all chemical treatments, ensuring the seeds are uniformly coated and dried in the shade.

### Recommended Soil Treatment Process for Methi (Fenugreek)

Soil treatment focuses on managing soil-borne diseases, nematodes, weeds, and providing essential nutrients for optimal crop growth.

1.  **Basal Fertilization (Pre-sowing):**
    *   **Purpose:** To provide essential macro-nutrients for initial plant establishment and growth.
    *   **Recommendation:** Apply fertilizers based on soil test reports. In the absence of a soil test, a general recommendation for Methi in Haryana is:
        *   Nitrogen (N): 20 kg/acre
        *   Phosphorus (P2O5): 40 kg/acre
        *   Potassium (K2O): 20 kg/acre
    *   **Application:** Broadcast the recommended quantities of fertilizers uniformly over the field and incorporate them into the soil during the final land preparation before sowing.

2.  **Weed Management (Pre-emergence Herbicide):**
    *   **Purpose:** To control broadleaf and grassy weeds that compete with Methi seedlings in the early stages.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   **Pendimethalin 30% EC** at 1.0-1.3 L per acre (mixed in 200-300 L of water).
    *   **Application:** Apply uniformly to the soil surface within 0-3 days after sowing, but before weed emergence. Ensure adequate soil moisture at the time of application for effective weed control.

3.  **Soil-borne Disease and Nematode Management (Pre-sowing/Pre-planting):**
    *   **Purpose:** To suppress soil-borne fungal pathogens (e.g., root rot, wilt) and offer some control against nematodes.
    *   **Biological:**
        *   **Trichoderma viride** at 2.5 kg per acre.
    *   **Application:** Mix 2.5 kg of **Trichoderma viride** with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost. Keep this mixture moist in a shaded place for 7-10 days, turning it occasionally to allow the fungus to multiply. Broadcast this enriched FYM uniformly over the field and incorporate it into the soil during the last ploughing, ideally 7-10 days before sowing. This method helps in building up beneficial microbial populations in the soil.
    *   *Note:* For severe nematode infestations, consult with HAU experts for specific recommendations, as chemical nematicides require careful consideration of CIBRC guidelines and environmental impact. **Trichoderma viride** provides a sustainable approach to managing soil health and suppressing various soil-borne issues.
