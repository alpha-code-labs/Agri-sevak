As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm the following regarding your query:

*   **Fruit fly:** This is not known to affect Methi (Fenugreek). Fruit flies primarily infest fleshy fruits and are not a pest of Methi pods.
*   **Ber fly (*Carpomyia vesuviana*):** This is not known to affect Methi (Fenugreek). The Ber fly is a highly specific pest of Ber (Indian Jujube) fruits and does not infest Methi.

Therefore, no control measures are required for these specific pests in Methi. If you are observing damage to Methi pods, it might be due to other pod borers or pests, which would require a different identification and management strategy.
