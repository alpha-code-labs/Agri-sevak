As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies in Methi (Fenugreek) in Haryana:

1.  **Sawflies:**
    This is not known to affect Methi (Fenugreek).

2.  **Weevils:**
    Weevils are not commonly known as significant field pests of Methi (Fenugreek) in Haryana.

3.  **Beetles:**
    Beetles, particularly flea beetles (which feed on young leaves, causing shot-hole damage) and blister beetles (which feed on flowers and leaves), can occasionally affect Methi. An Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is recommended for their control:

    *   **Cultural Practices:**
        *   Ensure timely sowing to avoid peak pest periods.
        *   Maintain field sanitation by removing weeds and crop residues that can harbor pests.
        *   Practice crop rotation to break pest cycles.

    *   **Mechanical Control:**
        *   For small infestations of larger beetles like blister beetles, hand-picking and destroying them can be effective.

    *   **Botanical Control:**
        *   For early stages or minor infestations, especially against flea beetles, consider applying neem-based formulations.
        *   **Azadirachtin 1500 ppm** at 2.5-5 ml per litre of water.

    *   **Chemical Control (Use only if infestation is severe and economic threshold is crossed, observing pre-harvest intervals):**
        *   **For Flea Beetles:**
            *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL** at 0.5 ml per litre of water.
            *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG** at 0.2 g per litre of water.
        *   **For Blister Beetles and other leaf-feeding beetles:**
            *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC** at 0.5 ml per litre of water.
            *   **Cypermethrin 25% EC** at 0.5 ml per litre of water.

    Always ensure thorough coverage of the foliage during spray application. It is crucial to consult your local agricultural extension officer for the most current recommendations and to ensure adherence to specific pre-harvest intervals (PHI) for Methi, especially when it is grown for leafy consumption.
