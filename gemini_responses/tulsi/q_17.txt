Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend the following doses of organic manures for healthy Tulsi cultivation in Haryana, keeping in mind the importance of soil health and the medicinal value of the plant:

**1. Farmyard Manure (FYM):**
Well-decomposed FYM is crucial for improving soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability.

*   **Field Cultivation:** Apply **10-15 tonnes per acre** (approximately 1-1.5 kg per square meter). This should be thoroughly incorporated into the soil 2-3 weeks before planting.
*   **Pot Cultivation:** Mix 25-30% well-decomposed FYM with your potting mix (garden soil, sand, and other components).

**2. Vermicompost:**
Vermicompost is richer in nutrients and beneficial microbes than FYM, promoting robust plant growth.

*   **Field Cultivation:** Apply **3-5 tonnes per acre** (approximately 300-500 g per square meter) at the time of planting or as a top dressing during active growth.
*   **Pot Cultivation:** Mix 15-20% vermicompost with your potting mix. For established plants, apply 100-200 g per pot as a top dressing every 2-3 months.

**3. Sagarika (Liquid Seaweed Extract):**
Sagarika, a biostimulant derived from red and brown seaweeds, enhances nutrient uptake, promotes root development, and improves plant vigor and stress tolerance.

*   **Foliar Spray:** Dilute **2-3 ml of Sagarika per litre of water**. Spray uniformly on the foliage during active growth stages. A typical schedule would be:
    *   First spray: 30 days after planting/transplanting.
    *   Second spray: 60 days after planting/transplanting.
*   **Soil Drench/Drip Irrigation:** For larger areas, **1-2 litres per acre** can be mixed with irrigation water and applied directly to the soil.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always ensure the FYM and vermicompost are well-decomposed to avoid pest issues and nutrient imbalances.
*   Regular soil testing is recommended to fine-tune nutrient management and ensure optimal soil health for Tulsi.
*   These organic inputs contribute significantly to the overall health and medicinal potency of Tulsi plants.
