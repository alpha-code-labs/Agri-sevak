Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing plant health in Tulsi (Ocimum sanctum/tenuiflorum).

Here's how to control Dieback, Twig Blight, and address Tikka disease in Tulsi:

### Control of Dieback and Twig Blight in Tulsi

Dieback and Twig Blight are often caused by various fungal pathogens (e.g., *Colletotrichum*, *Phomopsis*, *Alternaria*) and can be exacerbated by environmental stress, poor drainage, or mechanical injury. The control measures for both are largely similar.

**1. Cultural and Horticultural Practices:**

*   **Pruning:** Immediately prune all affected twigs and branches. Make cuts several inches into healthy, green wood below the visible symptoms. Use sterilized pruning tools (e.g., by dipping in a 10% bleach solution or rubbing alcohol) to prevent disease spread.
*   **Sanitation:** Collect and destroy all pruned plant material (burn or bury deeply) to eliminate inoculum sources. Do not compost diseased material.
*   **Air Circulation:** Ensure adequate spacing between plants to promote good air circulation, which helps reduce humidity around the foliage and inhibits fungal growth.
*   **Water Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day, as prolonged leaf wetness favors fungal development. Water at the base of the plant in the morning. Ensure good soil drainage to prevent waterlogging, which stresses plants and makes them more susceptible.
*   **Nutrition:** Provide balanced nutrition to maintain plant vigor. Healthy plants are more resistant to diseases. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can lead to lush, tender growth more susceptible to infection.

**2. Chemical Control (Fungicides):**

For effective chemical control, it is crucial to apply fungicides thoroughly, ensuring complete coverage of the plant, especially after pruning. Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

*   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: Apply at a rate of **1 g/L** of water.
*   **Mancozeb** 75% WP: Apply at a rate of **2.5 g/L** of water.
*   **Copper Oxychloride** 50% WP: Apply at a rate of **3 g/L** of water.
*   **Propiconazole** 25% EC: Apply at a rate of **1 ml/L** of water.
*   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC: Apply at a rate of **0.5 ml/L** of water.

**Application Schedule:**
*   Initiate spraying immediately upon observing symptoms, especially after pruning.
*   Repeat applications at 10-15 day intervals, depending on disease severity and prevailing weather conditions (e.g., high humidity, prolonged wetness).

### Tikka Disease in Tulsi

This is not known to affect Tulsi. Tikka disease is a specific term primarily used for a leaf spot disease of groundnut (peanut) caused by *Cercospora arachidicola* and *Cercosporidium personatum*. While *Cercospora* species can cause leaf spots on various plants, including *Ocimum* species, the specific nomenclature "Tikka disease" is not associated with Tulsi.
