As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the suitable climate, soil type, and drainage requirements for Tulsi (Ocimum sanctum/tenuiflorum) in Haryana:

**Climate:**
*   **Temperature:** Tulsi thrives in warm, tropical to sub-tropical climates. Optimal growth occurs between 20°C to 30°C. It is highly sensitive to frost and cold temperatures below 10°C can severely damage or kill the plant.
*   **Sunlight:** Requires abundant sunlight. Full sun exposure (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight per day) is ideal for robust growth and good essential oil production.
*   **Rainfall:** Prefers moderate rainfall. While it can tolerate some drought, consistent moisture (not waterlogging) during its growing period is beneficial.

**Soil Type:**
*   **Texture:** Adaptable to a range of soils but prefers well-drained, fertile, light-textured soils such as sandy-loam to loamy soils. Heavy clay soils should be avoided or amended.
*   **pH:** Slightly acidic to neutral soil pH, ideally ranging from 6.0 to 7.5, is most suitable for optimal nutrient uptake and growth.
*   **Organic Matter:** Rich in organic matter. Incorporating well-decomposed farmyard manure or compost significantly improves soil structure, fertility, and water-holding capacity.

**Drainage Requirement:**
*   **Crucial:** Excellent drainage is paramount for Tulsi. It is highly susceptible to root rot in waterlogged conditions. The soil must allow water to drain freely and quickly.
*   **Avoid Waterlogging:** Standing water around the roots for even short periods can lead to fungal diseases and plant death. Raised beds can be beneficial in areas with heavy soils or poor natural drainage.
