Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing pests in Tulsi (Ocimum sanctum/tenuiflorum) in Haryana.

Here's how to control the mentioned pests:

### 1. Grasshopper

Grasshoppers are generalist feeders and can cause defoliation in Tulsi plants.

*   **Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
    *   For small infestations, hand-picking the grasshoppers and their egg masses (found in the soil) can be effective.
    *   Maintain a clean surrounding by removing weeds and tall grasses, which can serve as breeding grounds and shelter for grasshoppers.
    *   Tilling the soil around the plants during autumn or early spring can expose and destroy egg pods.

*   **Chemical Control (for severe infestations):**
    *   Apply **Malathion 50% EC** at a concentration of 2.5 ml per litre of water, or 1.25 litres per acre. Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.
    *   Always follow the label instructions for application rates and pre-harvest intervals, especially since Tulsi is used for medicinal purposes.

### 2. Painted Bug (Bagrada hilaris)

This is not known to affect Tulsi. The painted bug is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops (Brassicaceae family) like mustard, cabbage, and radish.

### 3. Red Cotton Bug (Dysdercus cingulatus)

This is not known to affect Tulsi. The red cotton bug primarily infests cotton and other plants belonging to the Malvaceae family, feeding on developing seeds. It is not a common or significant pest of Tulsi.

### 4. Black Ants

Black ants are generally not direct pests of Tulsi, meaning they do not feed on the plant itself to cause damage. Their presence is usually indicative of other issues or activities:

*   **Honeydew Farming:** Ants are often attracted to Tulsi plants if there are other sap-sucking insects present, such as aphids or mealybugs. These insects excrete a sugary substance called honeydew, which ants feed on. In such cases, the primary problem is the sap-sucking insect, not the ants.
    *   **Control:** If ants are present due to honeydew, focus on controlling the primary sap-sucking pests. For aphids or mealybugs, you can use a strong jet of water to dislodge them or apply neem-based formulations.
*   **Nesting or Foraging:** Ants might be nesting in the soil around the plant or simply foraging for food.
    *   **Control:**
        *   Maintain good sanitation around the plants, removing any food sources that might attract ants.
        *   You can create physical barriers around the base of the plant using sticky traps or diatomaceous earth to deter ants from climbing.
        *   If ant nests are problematic in the immediate vicinity, you can use ant baits containing active ingredients like **Fipronil 0.01%** or **Hydramethylnon 0.75%** placed away from the plant, following label instructions. Do not apply these directly to the Tulsi plant.

Always prioritize cultural and mechanical methods for pest control in Tulsi, especially given its medicinal value. Use chemical controls judiciously and only when necessary, strictly adhering to recommended dosages and safety guidelines.
