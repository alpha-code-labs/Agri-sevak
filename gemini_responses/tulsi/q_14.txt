Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding soil pests in Tulsi (Holy Basil), a plant of immense cultural and medicinal value. Effective and safe management is crucial.

Here's scientifically verified advice for controlling termites and nematodes in Tulsi:

### **1. Termite Control in Tulsi**

Termites can cause significant damage by feeding on the roots and stem base, leading to wilting and eventual plant death.

**A. Cultural and Preventive Measures:**

*   **Site Selection:** Avoid planting Tulsi in areas previously known for severe termite infestation.
*   **Soil Preparation:** Ensure good drainage. Remove any dead wood, stumps, or organic debris from the planting area that could attract termites.
*   **Watering:** Avoid overwatering, as consistently moist soil can sometimes attract termites.
*   **Physical Barriers:** If planting in pots, ensure the pots are not directly on soil that might be infested. Use raised beds if possible.

**B. Chemical Control (for severe infestations):**

For established plants, a soil drench around the base can be effective.

*   **Fipronil 5% SC** (Suspension Concentrate)
    *   **Dosage:** 1.5 - 2.0 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Application:** Drench the soil around the base of the Tulsi plant thoroughly, ensuring the solution penetrates the root zone. Apply when the soil is moist but not waterlogged. Repeat if necessary, typically after 2-3 weeks, depending on the severity and persistence of the infestation.

### **2. Nematode (Root-Knot) Control in Tulsi**

Root-knot nematodes (*Meloidogyne* species) are microscopic worms that infect plant roots, causing galls or knots. These galls impair the plant's ability to absorb water and nutrients, leading to stunted growth, yellowing leaves, and reduced vigour.

**Important Note:** Due to Tulsi's medicinal use, the application of synthetic chemical nematicides is generally **not recommended** as it can lead to undesirable residues in the plant. Our focus will be on integrated pest management (IPM) strategies, emphasizing cultural, organic, and biological methods.

**A. Cultural and Preventive Measures:**

*   **Healthy Planting Material:** Always start with healthy, nematode-free seedlings or cuttings.
*   **Soil Solarization:** If preparing a new bed, especially in summer, cover the moist soil with a transparent polyethylene sheet for 4-6 weeks. The sun's heat trapped under the sheet can kill nematodes and other soil-borne pathogens.
*   **Crop Rotation:** If growing Tulsi in a larger area, rotate with non-host crops (e.g., marigolds, certain grasses) to reduce nematode populations in the soil. Marigolds (Tagetes spp.) are known to have nematicidal properties when grown as a trap crop.
*   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy severely infested plants and their root systems to prevent further spread.

**B. Organic Amendments and Biological Control:**

These methods enhance soil health and naturally suppress nematode populations.

*   **Neem Cake:** Incorporate **Neem Cake** (powdered form) into the soil around the Tulsi plants.
    *   **Dosage:** 100-200 grams per plant, mixed into the topsoil.
    *   **Application:** Neem cake releases compounds that are toxic to nematodes and also improves soil fertility. Apply every 2-3 months.
*   **Mustard Cake:** Similar to neem cake, **Mustard Cake** can also be used.
    *   **Dosage:** 100-150 grams per plant.
    *   **Application:** Mix into the soil around the plant.
*   **Farmyard Manure (FYM) / Compost:** Regular application of well-decomposed FYM or compost improves soil structure, enhances microbial activity, and can suppress nematode populations.
*   **Bio-nematicides:**
    *   **Purpureocillium lilacinum** (formerly *Paecilomyces lilacinus*)
        *   **Dosage:** As per product instructions, typically 2-5 kg per acre or 10-20 grams per plant for soil application.
        *   **Application:** Mix with well-decomposed FYM or compost and apply around the root zone, or use as a soil drench. This fungus parasitizes nematode eggs and females.
    *   **Trichoderma viride / harzianum**
        *   **Dosage:** As per product instructions, typically 2-5 kg per acre or 10-20 grams per plant.
        *   **Application:** Mix with FYM/compost and apply to the soil. *Trichoderma* species are beneficial fungi that compete with and antagonize plant pathogens, including some nematodes, and improve plant vigour.

Always ensure proper identification of the pest before applying any control measures. For specific guidance tailored to your exact field conditions, it is always advisable to consult with local agricultural extension officers or HAU experts.
