As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm the following regarding the conditions you've mentioned for Tulsi (Holy Basil - *Ocimum tenuiflorum*):

*   **Scab:** This is not known to affect Tulsi.
*   **Canker:** This is not known to affect Tulsi. While Tulsi can experience stem blights or rots caused by various fungi, the specific condition known as "Canker" is not a recognized disease of Tulsi.
*   **Gummosis:** This is not known to affect Tulsi. Gummosis is typically associated with woody fruit trees and is not a characteristic response of Tulsi.
*   **Lichen:** This is not known to affect Tulsi as a harmful condition requiring control. Lichens are symbiotic organisms that grow on surfaces and are generally harmless epiphytes, not parasites. They do not draw nutrients from the plant. Their presence on Tulsi stems would be highly unusual and not indicative of a plant health problem.
