Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide scientifically verified advice on addressing micronutrient deficiencies in Tulsi (Ocimum sanctum/tenuiflorum) for the Haryana region.

It is important to note that all the micronutrients you listed (Zinc, Iron, Boron, Calcium, Magnesium, and Manganese) are essential for the healthy growth and development of Tulsi, just like any other plant. Therefore, deficiencies in any of these can indeed affect Tulsi.

**General Approach to Addressing Micronutrient Deficiencies in Tulsi:**

1.  **Diagnosis is Key:** Visual symptoms can be indicative, but accurate diagnosis requires **soil testing** and, if possible, **plant tissue analysis**. HAU strongly recommends regular soil testing to determine the exact nutrient status of your soil and tailor recommendations accordingly.
2.  **Integrated Nutrient Management:** Combine soil application for long-term correction with foliar sprays for quick relief of symptoms.
3.  **Organic Matter:** Incorporating well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost improves soil structure, water retention, and micronutrient availability.

Here's how to address specific micronutrient deficiencies in Tulsi:

### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, small and narrow leaves (often called 'little leaf'), interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, and a rosetted appearance of leaves at the shoot tip.
*   **Addressing the Deficiency:**
    *   **Soil Application (Preventive/Corrective):**
        *   Apply **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** at 10-25 kg/acre, mixed with soil before planting or as a top dressing. The exact dose depends on soil test results.
    *   **Foliar Spray (Quick Correction):**
        *   Spray **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** at 0.5% concentration (5 grams per litre of water) or **Zinc EDTA** at 0.1% concentration (1 gram per litre of water). Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, preferably in the morning or late afternoon.

### 2. Iron (Fe) / Ferrous Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Pronounced interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, with veins remaining distinctly green. In severe cases, the entire leaf may turn pale yellow or almost white. Common in alkaline soils.
*   **Addressing the Deficiency:**
    *   **Soil Application (Less effective in high pH soils):**
        *   Apply **Ferrous sulphate heptahydrate** at 25-50 kg/acre. This is often less effective in high pH soils prevalent in Haryana.
    *   **Foliar Spray (More effective for quick relief):**
        *   Spray **Ferrous sulphate heptahydrate** at 0.5-1% concentration (5-10 grams per litre of water) or **Ferrous EDTA** at 0.1% concentration (1 gram per litre of water). Repeat sprays as needed, typically at 7-10 day intervals until symptoms disappear.

### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Death of growing points (shoot tips), stunted growth, thickened and brittle leaves, cracking of stems, poor flowering, and reduced seed set.
*   **Addressing the Deficiency:**
    *   **Soil Application (Preventive/Corrective):**
        *   Apply **Borax (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate)** at 4-8 kg/acre, mixed with soil.
    *   **Foliar Spray (Quick Correction):**
        *   Spray **Borax (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate)** at 0.1-0.2% concentration (1-2 grams per litre of water) or **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** at 0.1% concentration (1 gram per litre of water). Apply at critical growth stages, especially before flowering.

### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Death of growing points (shoot and root tips), young leaves become distorted, curled, or develop water-soaked areas. Overall stunted growth.
*   **Addressing the Deficiency:**
    *   **Soil Application (Long-term correction):**
        *   If soil pH is low and calcium is deficient, apply **Calcium carbonate** (lime) or **Gypsum (Calcium sulphate dihydrate)** as per soil test recommendations. For direct calcium supply, **Calcium nitrate** can be applied at 50-100 kg/acre.
    *   **Foliar Spray (Quick Correction):**
        *   Spray **Calcium nitrate** at 0.5-1% concentration (5-10 grams per litre of water) or **Calcium chloride** at 0.5% concentration (5 grams per litre of water). Apply to young, developing leaves.

### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves (yellowing between veins, with veins remaining green). Leaves may become brittle and sometimes develop a reddish-purple tint.
*   **Addressing the Deficiency:**
    *   **Soil Application (Preventive/Corrective):**
        *   Apply **Magnesium sulphate heptahydrate** at 10-20 kg/acre, mixed with soil.
    *   **Foliar Spray (Quick Correction):**
        *   Spray **Magnesium sulphate heptahydrate** at 1-2% concentration (10-20 grams per litre of water). Repeat if symptoms persist after 10-15 days.

### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, often with a finer network of green veins compared to iron deficiency. In severe cases, small necrotic (dead) spots may appear on the chlorotic areas.
*   **Addressing the Deficiency:**
    *   **Soil Application (Preventive/Corrective):**
        *   Apply **Manganese sulphate monohydrate** at 10-20 kg/acre.
    *   **Foliar Spray (Quick Correction):**
        *   Spray **Manganese sulphate monohydrate** at 0.5% concentration (5 grams per litre of water) or **Manganese EDTA** at 0.1% concentration (1 gram per litre of water). Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always ensure thorough coverage of the plant foliage during foliar sprays.
*   Use clean water for preparing spray solutions.
*   Avoid spraying during hot midday sun to prevent leaf scorching. Early morning or late afternoon is ideal.
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label for safe and effective use.
