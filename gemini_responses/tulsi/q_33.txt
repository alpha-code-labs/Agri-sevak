As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I must emphasize that Tulsi (Ocimum tenuiflorum/sanctum) is a valuable medicinal and aromatic plant. Therefore, weed control strategies must prioritize methods that do not leave harmful residues, ensuring the safety and quality of the harvested product. Chemical herbicide use in Tulsi is highly restricted and generally not recommended for direct application to the crop.

Here's how to control the specified weeds in Tulsi:

### 1. Orobanche (Broomrape)

This is not known to affect Tulsi. Orobanche (Broomrape) species are root parasitic weeds that primarily affect crops like tobacco, tomato, mustard, and legumes. Tulsi, belonging to the Lamiaceae family, is not a typical host for Orobanche.

### 2. Amarbail (Cuscuta spp.)

Amarbail (Cuscuta spp.) is a parasitic weed that can severely damage host plants by drawing nutrients. While it has a broad host range, its occurrence on Tulsi should be managed proactively. Chemical control of Amarbail in standing crops like Tulsi is extremely challenging and generally not feasible without harming the host plant. The most effective methods are:

*   **Manual Removal:** Carefully hand-pull or cut the infested Tulsi plants along with the Amarbail strands as soon as it is observed, before it flowers and sets seeds. Ensure all detached Amarbail fragments are removed from the field and destroyed (e.g., by burning) to prevent re-infestation.
*   **Preventive Measures:** Use clean Tulsi seeds/planting material. Avoid bringing soil or plant debris from infested areas. Practice crop rotation with non-host crops if Amarbail is a persistent problem in the field.

### 3. Broadleaf, Narrowleaf, Bathu (Chenopodium album), Congress grass (Parthenium hysterophorus), and Phalaris minor

For these common weeds, the primary and most recommended control methods in Tulsi cultivation are non-chemical:

*   **Manual Weeding:** This is the most effective and safest method. Perform weeding regularly, especially during the initial 30-60 days after planting, when competition is most critical. Two to three hand weedings may be required depending on weed pressure.
*   **Hoeing:** Shallow hoeing can effectively remove young weeds and aerate the soil. Be careful not to damage Tulsi roots.
*   **Mulching:** Applying organic mulch (e.g., straw, dried leaves, black plastic mulch) around Tulsi plants can suppress weed growth, conserve soil moisture, and regulate soil temperature. Ensure the mulch layer is thick enough (5-10 cm) to be effective.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Maintain optimal plant spacing for Tulsi to allow for canopy closure, which can naturally suppress weed growth by shading.
*   **Clean Cultivation:** Ensure the field is free of weeds before planting Tulsi. Use clean irrigation water and avoid bringing weed seeds into the field through farm machinery or tools.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate Tulsi with crops that have different weed management strategies or are less susceptible to the specific weed spectrum.

### Chemical Control (Pre-planting / Non-crop areas only)

**Direct application of herbicides on standing Tulsi crops is generally NOT recommended due to the risk of phytotoxicity and residue accumulation in the medicinal product.** There are no CIBRC-approved selective herbicides for post-emergence application in Tulsi.

However, for severe weed infestation *before* planting Tulsi, or for managing weeds in non-cropped areas surrounding the Tulsi field, a non-selective herbicide can be used with extreme caution:

*   **Glyphosate (41% SL):** Apply at 1.0-1.5 kg a.i./acre (2.5-3.75 L of 41% SL formulation per acre) mixed in 200-300 litres of water, as a pre-plant application to clear the field of existing weeds. Ensure a minimum waiting period of 7-10 days after application before planting Tulsi. **DO NOT apply near or on growing Tulsi plants.**

Always prioritize integrated weed management, combining cultural, mechanical, and preventive measures to ensure sustainable and residue-free Tulsi production.
