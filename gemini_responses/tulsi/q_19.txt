Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can confirm that macronutrient deficiencies (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium) are common issues that can significantly impact the health and growth of Tulsi (Holy Basil) plants. Addressing these deficiencies promptly and correctly is crucial for robust plant development and optimal medicinal properties.

Here's how to identify and address these deficiencies in Tulsi, keeping in mind CIBRC approved chemicals and metric units:

**General Approach:**
Before applying any fertilizers, it is highly recommended to conduct a **soil test**. This provides precise information about the nutrient status of your soil and helps in formulating an accurate fertilization plan, preventing over-application and nutrient imbalances.

### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   General yellowing (chlorosis) of older leaves, starting from the tips and margins, progressing inwards.
*   Stunted growth and reduced leaf size.
*   Pale green appearance of the entire plant.
*   Premature leaf drop.

**Remedy:**
Nitrogen is essential for vegetative growth and chlorophyll production.

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   For individual plants (in pots or small beds): Apply 1-2 grams of **Urea** per plant, mixed lightly into the soil around the base, followed by immediate watering. Alternatively, 2-3 grams of **Calcium Nitrate** or **Ammonium Sulfate** can be used. Repeat every 2-4 weeks if symptoms persist and soil test confirms deficiency.
    *   For larger areas (field cultivation): Apply 20-40 kg of **Urea** per acre in split doses (e.g., half at planting, half 3-4 weeks later). Adjust based on soil test recommendations.
*   **Foliar Application (for quick recovery):**
    *   Dissolve 5-10 grams of **Urea** in 1 litre of water (0.5-1% solution). Spray this solution evenly on the leaves during early morning or late evening to avoid leaf burn. Repeat every 7-10 days until symptoms subside.

### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   Stunted growth, particularly of roots.
*   Dark green or purplish discoloration of older leaves, especially on the undersides and stems.
*   Delayed maturity and poor flowering/seed production.
*   Leaves may appear stiff or leathery.

**Remedy:**
Phosphorus is vital for root development, energy transfer, and flowering.

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   For individual plants: Apply 2-5 grams of **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** or 1-2 grams of **Di-Ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** per plant. Mix into the soil and water thoroughly. Phosphorus is less mobile in soil, so it's best applied as a basal dose or incorporated into the root zone.
    *   For larger areas: Apply 50-100 kg of **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** or 20-40 kg of **Di-Ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** per acre as a basal application, incorporated into the soil before planting or sowing.

### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   Yellowing and browning/scorching (necrosis) of leaf margins and tips, typically on older leaves.
*   Weak stems and lodging (falling over).
*   Reduced disease resistance.
*   Poor flower and seed development.
*   Overall stunted growth.

**Remedy:**
Potassium is crucial for water regulation, disease resistance, and overall plant vigor.

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   For individual plants: Apply 1-2 grams of **Muriate of Potash (Potassium Chloride)** or **Sulfate of Potash (Potassium Sulfate)** per plant, mixed into the soil and watered. Repeat every 3-6 weeks if needed.
    *   For larger areas: Apply 20-40 kg of **Muriate of Potash (Potassium Chloride)** or **Sulfate of Potash (Potassium Sulfate)** per acre, either as a basal application or split into two top-dressings.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Soil pH:** Ensure your soil pH is within the optimal range for Tulsi (typically 6.0-7.5) as extreme pH can lock up nutrients, making them unavailable to the plant even if present in the soil.
*   **Organic Matter:** Regular incorporation of well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost can significantly improve soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability, providing a slow-release source of all macronutrients.
*   **Watering:** Always water thoroughly after applying granular fertilizers to the soil to help dissolve them and move them into the root zone.
*   **Observation:** Continuously monitor your Tulsi plants for signs of improvement or new deficiencies, and adjust your fertilization program accordingly.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively address macronutrient deficiencies in your Tulsi plants and ensure their healthy and vigorous growth.
