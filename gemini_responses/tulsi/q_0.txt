As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an Integrated Disease Management (IDM) approach for controlling fungal diseases in Tulsi (Holy Basil). This includes cultural practices, sanitation, and judicious use of CIBRC-approved fungicides when necessary.

Here's how to control the specified fungal diseases in Tulsi:

### General Cultural Practices for Fungal Disease Management:

1.  **Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy infected leaves, stems, and plant debris to reduce inoculum sources.
2.  **Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to promote good air circulation, which helps reduce humidity around the plants and inhibits fungal growth.
3.  **Watering:** Water plants at the base in the morning hours. Avoid overhead irrigation, especially in the evening, to allow foliage to dry quickly.
4.  **Nutrition:** Provide balanced nutrition to maintain plant vigor, as stressed plants are more susceptible to diseases.
5.  **Pruning:** Prune lower leaves or dense growth to improve air circulation within the canopy.

### Specific Disease Control Measures:

#### 1. Alternaria (Alternaria Leaf Spot/Blight)

*   **Symptoms:** Characterized by dark, concentric rings (target spots) on leaves, often leading to blight and defoliation.
*   **Control:**
    *   **Cultural:** Implement general cultural practices as mentioned above.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   Apply **Mancozeb** 75% WP at 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L of water).
        *   Alternatively, apply **Chlorothalonil** 75% WP at 2.0 kg/acre (or 2.0 g/L of water).
        *   For systemic action, **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC can be used at 0.5 ml/L of water.

#### 2. Anthracnose

*   **Symptoms:** Irregular, dark, sunken lesions on leaves, stems, and sometimes flowers, often with pinkish spore masses in humid conditions. Can cause dieback.
*   **Control:**
    *   **Cultural:** Remove and destroy infected plant parts immediately.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   Apply **Mancozeb** 75% WP at 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L of water).
        *   Alternatively, **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 0.5 g/L of water can be effective.
        *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC at 0.5 ml/L of water also provides good control.

#### 3. Blast

*   **This is not known to affect Tulsi.** Blast disease is primarily associated with rice and some other cereals.

#### 4. Blight (General Leaf Blight, often caused by Alternaria or other fungi)

*   **Symptoms:** Large, irregular necrotic areas on leaves, leading to wilting and defoliation.
*   **Control:**
    *   **Cultural:** As per general practices.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   Apply **Mancozeb** 75% WP at 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L of water).
        *   Alternatively, **Chlorothalonil** 75% WP at 2.0 kg/acre (or 2.0 g/L of water).
        *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC at 0.5 ml/L of water can also be used.

#### 5. Brown Spot

*   **Symptoms:** Various fungi can cause brown spots on leaves, leading to reduced photosynthesis and aesthetic damage.
*   **Control:**
    *   **Cultural:** As per general practices.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   Apply **Mancozeb** 75% WP at 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L of water).
        *   Alternatively, **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 0.5 g/L of water.

#### 6. Downy Mildew

*   **Symptoms:** Yellowish, angular spots on the upper leaf surface, with corresponding purplish-grey, fuzzy fungal growth on the lower leaf surface.
*   **Control:**
    *   **Cultural:** Ensure good air circulation and avoid overhead irrigation. Remove infected leaves.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   Apply **Mancozeb** 75% WP at 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L of water).
        *   Alternatively, **Propineb** 70% WP at 2.5 g/L of water.
        *   Combination products like **Metalaxyl 8% + Mancozeb 64% WP** at 2.5 g/L of water are highly effective.

#### 7. Powdery Mildew

*   **Symptoms:** White, powdery patches on the surface of leaves, stems, and sometimes flowers, primarily on the upper side.
*   **Control:**
    *   **Cultural:** Improve air circulation and remove severely infected leaves.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   Apply **Sulphur** 80% WP at 2.0 g/L of water.
        *   Alternatively, **Myclobutanil** 10% WP at 0.4 g/L of water.
        *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC at 0.5 ml/L of water also provides control.

#### 8. Grey Mildew (Often refers to Ramularia Leaf Spot or similar)

*   **Symptoms:** Irregular greyish-brown spots on leaves, sometimes with a fuzzy appearance, often more prominent on the underside.
*   **Control:**
    *   **Cultural:** As per general practices.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   Apply **Mancozeb** 75% WP at 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L of water).
        *   Alternatively, **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 0.5 g/L of water.

### Important Considerations for Chemical Application:

*   **Read the Label:** Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the fungicide label for correct dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   **Rotation:** Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of fungicide resistance in pathogens.
*   **Timing:** Apply fungicides preventively if disease conditions are favorable, or at the very first sign of disease symptoms for best efficacy.
*   **Safety:** Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and application.

For any specific or severe outbreaks, it is advisable to consult with local agricultural extension specialists for precise diagnosis and tailored recommendations.
