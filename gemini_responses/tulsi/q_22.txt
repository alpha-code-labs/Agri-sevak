As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), here are the recommended cultivation practices for Tulsi (*Ocimum sanctum* / *Ocimum tenuiflorum*) in Haryana:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   Tulsi is primarily propagated through seeds. Due to the very small size of the seeds, it is highly recommended to raise seedlings in a nursery before transplanting them to the main field.
    *   **Nursery Preparation:** Prepare raised nursery beds (typically 1 meter wide, 15-20 cm high, and of a convenient length) with well-drained soil enriched with well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost.
    *   **Sowing in Nursery:** Sow the seeds thinly and uniformly, either by broadcasting or in shallow lines (approximately 10 cm apart). Lightly cover the seeds with a thin layer of fine soil or sand. Water gently using a rose can to avoid disturbing the seeds.
    *   **Transplanting:** Seedlings are typically ready for transplanting to the main field when they are 6-8 weeks old and have attained a height of 10-15 cm.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   **In Nursery:** Tulsi seeds are very small and require shallow planting. They should be covered with no more than 0.5 cm of fine soil or sand.
    *   **In Main Field (Transplanting):** When transplanting seedlings, ensure they are planted at the same depth they were growing in the nursery. The root ball should be well covered with soil, and the plant should be firmed gently.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   For optimal growth, yield, and ease of intercultural operations, a spacing of 45 cm between rows and 20-30 cm between plants within a row is recommended.
    *   A common and effective spacing pattern is 45 cm x 30 cm.

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   To raise a sufficient number of seedlings for one acre of the main field, a seed rate of 200-300 g of good quality seeds is generally required for the nursery.
