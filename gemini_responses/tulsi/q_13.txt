As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I must provide scientifically accurate information.

**Fruit fly and Ber fly are not known to affect Tulsi.**

*   **Fruit flies** (e.g., *Bactrocera* species) primarily infest fleshy fruits of various horticultural crops. Tulsi (Holy Basil, *Ocimum tenuiflorum*) produces small, dry nutlets, not fleshy fruits, and is not a known host for fruit flies.
*   **Ber fly** (*Carpomyia vesuviana*) is a highly specific pest primarily affecting Ber (*Ziziphus mauritiana*) and other *Ziziphus* species. It does not infest Tulsi.
