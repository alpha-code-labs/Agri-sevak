As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the maturity signs, harvesting time, and cutting process for Tulsi (Holy Basil) in Haryana:

Tulsi is primarily harvested for its leaves and tender stems, which are rich in essential oils and medicinal compounds. Proper harvesting techniques are crucial for maximizing yield and maintaining plant health.

### Maturity Signs for Tulsi

The maturity of Tulsi for harvesting is indicated by:

1.  **Vegetative Growth:** The plant should have achieved significant vegetative growth, with a good number of healthy, fully expanded leaves.
2.  **Plant Height:** Typically, the plant reaches a height of 30-45 cm, indicating sufficient biomass for the first harvest.
3.  **Early Flowering Stage:** For optimal essential oil content and leaf yield, Tulsi is often harvested at the initiation of flowering or when about 50% of the plants have started to flower. Harvesting before full flowering prevents the plant from diverting too much energy into seed production, thus maintaining leaf quality and promoting further vegetative growth.
4.  **Aroma Intensity:** The leaves should emit a strong, characteristic aroma, indicating a good concentration of essential oils.

### Harvesting Time for Tulsi

The optimal harvesting time depends on the specific variety and growing conditions, but general guidelines are:

1.  **First Harvest:** The first harvest is usually ready **60-90 days** after planting or sowing, once the plants have established well and shown good vegetative growth.
2.  **Subsequent Harvests:** Subsequent harvests can be taken every **45-60 days** thereafter, depending on the rate of regrowth and environmental conditions. Tulsi can typically provide 3-5 harvests in a year under good management.
3.  **Time of Day:** It is generally recommended to harvest Tulsi in the **morning hours**, after the dew has dried but before the intense heat of the day. This is believed to help retain the essential oil content and freshness of the leaves.

### Cutting Process for Tulsi

The correct cutting process is vital for promoting vigorous regrowth and ensuring sustained yields:

1.  **Tools:** Use sharp, clean secateurs, scissors, or a knife to make clean cuts. This prevents damage to the plant and reduces the risk of disease entry.
2.  **Cutting Height:** Harvest the upper 15-20 cm of the plant, leaving a stubble height of **15-20 cm** from the ground. This ensures that enough nodes and leaves remain on the plant to facilitate rapid regrowth and branching.
3.  **Parts to Harvest:** Harvest the leaves and tender, non-woody stems. Avoid cutting into the woody base of the plant, as this can hinder regrowth.
4.  **Encourage Branching:** Cutting the main stem encourages the development of lateral branches, leading to a bushier plant and higher leaf yield in subsequent harvests.
5.  **Post-Harvest Care:** After harvesting, it is beneficial to provide a light irrigation and, if necessary, a balanced fertilizer application to support the plant's recovery and promote new growth.
