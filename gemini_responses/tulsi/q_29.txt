This is not known to affect Tulsi. Tulsi (Holy Basil) does not produce fruits in the conventional sense, nor does it produce tinda or bolls. While Tulsi does flower, and premature shedding of flowers can occur due to general plant stress (such as water imbalance, nutrient deficiency, or extreme temperatures), "Flower drop" is not recognized as a specific disease or condition affecting Tulsi in the same manner as "fruit drop" or "boll dropping" in other crops.
