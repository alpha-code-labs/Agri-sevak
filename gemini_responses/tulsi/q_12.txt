Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist from HAU, Hisar, I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling Scale insects and Mealybugs on Tulsi (Holy Basil). These sap-sucking pests can significantly weaken the plant if not managed properly.

Here's how to control them:

**1. Identification and Monitoring:**
*   **Mealybugs:** Look for white, cottony masses, usually in leaf axils, on stems, or on the undersides of leaves. They are soft-bodied and covered in a waxy, powdery secretion.
*   **Scale Insects:** These appear as small, immobile bumps (often brown, black, or white) on stems and leaves. They have a hard, waxy shell that protects them. You might also notice sticky honeydew and sooty mold growth.

**2. Cultural and Mechanical Control (First Line of Defense):**
*   **Pruning:** Immediately prune and destroy heavily infested leaves and stems. This reduces the pest population significantly.
*   **Manual Removal:** For light infestations, use a cotton swab dipped in rubbing alcohol to gently wipe off mealybugs and scale insects.
*   **Strong Water Spray:** Use a strong jet of water to dislodge pests from the plant. Repeat this every few days. Ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves.
*   **Isolation:** If possible, isolate infested plants to prevent spread to healthy ones.

**3. Organic/Botanical Control:**
*   **Neem Oil (Azadirachtin):** This is an excellent botanical insecticide that acts as an antifeedant, repellent, and insect growth regulator.
    *   Mix **Azadirachtin** (e.g., 1500 ppm or 3000 ppm formulation) at a rate of **5-10 ml per litre of water**.
    *   Spray thoroughly, ensuring complete coverage of all plant parts, especially the undersides of leaves and stem crevices.
    *   Repeat every 7-10 days, especially during active infestation.

**4. Chemical Control (If infestation is severe and other methods are insufficient):**
When using chemical pesticides, always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (gloves, mask) and follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully. Apply during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to avoid phytotoxicity and maximize efficacy.

*   **For Mealybugs and Scale Nymphs (Crawlers):**
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** This is an insect growth regulator that is very effective against nymphs of mealybugs and scale insects by inhibiting chitin synthesis.
        *   Apply **Buprofezin** at a rate of **1.25 ml to 1.5 ml per litre of water**.
        *   Ensure thorough coverage. Repeat application after 10-14 days if necessary.

*   **For Established Mealybugs and Scale Insects (Systemic Action):**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** This is a systemic insecticide that is absorbed by the plant and moves throughout its tissues, killing sap-sucking pests when they feed.
        *   Apply **Imidacloprid** at a rate of **0.5 ml to 0.75 ml per litre of water**.
        *   Spray thoroughly, covering all parts of the plant.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Another systemic insecticide effective against a wide range of sucking pests.
        *   Apply **Thiamethoxam** at a rate of **0.2 g to 0.3 g per litre of water**.
        *   Ensure good coverage.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Thorough Coverage:** Both mealybugs and scale insects are often hidden or protected by waxy coatings. Ensure the spray solution reaches all parts of the plant, especially the undersides of leaves and stem junctions.
*   **Rotation:** To prevent the development of resistance, rotate between different classes of insecticides if multiple applications are needed.
*   **Safety:** Since Tulsi leaves are often consumed or used for medicinal purposes, prioritize cultural, mechanical, and organic methods. If chemical control is necessary, observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) if specified for similar crops, although Tulsi specific PHI might not be available. It's generally advisable to avoid harvesting leaves for at least 7-10 days after chemical application.

By following these integrated pest management strategies, you can effectively control scale insects and mealybugs on your Tulsi plants.
