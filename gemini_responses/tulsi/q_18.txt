As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the use of growth regulators and Boron in Tulsi (Holy Basil) for Haryana conditions:

It is important to note that the use of growth regulators should always be based on specific objectives and conducted with caution, as improper application can lead to adverse effects.

Here are the recommendations:

*   **Ethephon (Ethrel)**
    *   **This is not a standard, widely recommended growth regulator for general application in Tulsi in Haryana for routine yield or quality enhancement.** While **Ethephon** can influence plant processes like flowering, branching, and essential oil content in various crops, its specific application as a routine growth regulator for Tulsi in commercial cultivation in Haryana is not a common or established practice. Research might explore its effects for specific purposes, but for general growth regulation, it is not typically advised for farmers.

*   **2,4-D**
    *   **This is not known to affect Tulsi positively as a growth regulator.** **2,4-D** is primarily a synthetic auxin herbicide. At the concentrations typically used as a growth regulator in other specific applications (e.g., fruit thinning), it is extremely low and precise. However, for Tulsi, **2,4-D** is generally considered a potent herbicide and its application, even at very low concentrations, carries a high risk of phytotoxicity and damage to the crop. Therefore, it is **not recommended** for use as a growth regulator in Tulsi.

*   **Boron**
    *   Boron is an essential micronutrient crucial for cell wall formation, sugar transport, and pollen viability. While not a growth regulator in the same category as auxins or ethylene releasers, its deficiency can severely limit growth and yield.
    *   **Recommendation for Boron application (Foliar Spray):**
        *   For correcting Boron deficiency or ensuring adequate supply, a foliar spray is generally recommended.
        *   **Technical Chemical Name:** **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (e.g., Solubor) or **Sodium tetraborate decahydrate** (e.g., Borax).
        *   **Dose:** 1.0 - 1.5 g of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** per litre of water (or 2.0 - 3.0 g of **Sodium tetraborate decahydrate** per litre of water).
        *   **Application:** Spray evenly to cover the foliage.
        *   **Timing:** Apply during active vegetative growth, typically 30-45 days after planting/sowing, and repeat if deficiency symptoms persist or based on soil test recommendations.
        *   **Frequency:** One to two sprays during the crop cycle, depending on soil test results and visual deficiency symptoms.

Always ensure proper diagnosis of nutrient deficiencies through soil and plant tissue analysis before applying micronutrients. For any specific concerns or advanced applications, it is advisable to consult with HAU experts directly.
