As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following for ideal Tulsi transplantation in Haryana:

### Ideal Transplantation Time for Tulsi

Tulsi thrives in warm, humid conditions and is sensitive to frost. Based on Haryana's climate, the ideal transplantation times are:

*   **Spring/Early Summer:** April to May (for seedlings sown in February-March). This allows the plants to establish before the peak summer heat and benefit from early monsoon showers.
*   **Monsoon Season:** July to August (for seedlings sown in May-June). This is often preferred as the natural rainfall helps in better establishment and reduces the need for frequent irrigation during the initial phase.

### Ideal Transplantation Distance for Tulsi

Proper spacing is crucial for good air circulation, light penetration, and overall plant health, leading to better yield.

*   **Row-to-Row Distance:** 45 cm
*   **Plant-to-Plant Distance:** 30 cm

This spacing allows for optimal growth and facilitates inter-cultural operations.

### Ideal Transplantation Process for Tulsi

1.  **Seedling Preparation:**
    *   Sow Tulsi seeds in well-prepared nursery beds or seedling trays filled with a rich, well-drained potting mix.
    *   Seeds are typically sown 0.5 cm deep.
    *   Keep the nursery moist. Germination usually occurs within 7-10 days.
    *   Seedlings are ready for transplanting when they are 4-6 weeks old, have developed 4-6 true leaves, and are about 10-15 cm tall.

2.  **Field Preparation:**
    *   Select a site that receives full sunlight for at least 6-8 hours a day.
    *   The soil should be well-drained, fertile, and have a pH between 6.0 and 7.5.
    *   Plough the field 2-3 times to achieve a fine tilth.
    *   Incorporate 10-15 tonnes per acre of well-rotted Farmyard Manure (FYM) or compost during the last ploughing.
    *   Form raised beds if the soil has poor drainage to prevent waterlogging.

3.  **Transplanting:**
    *   Water the nursery bed thoroughly a few hours before transplanting to make it easier to lift the seedlings without damaging the roots.
    *   Carefully lift the seedlings, ensuring a small ball of earth remains attached to the roots to minimize transplant shock.
    *   Dig small holes in the prepared field at the recommended spacing (45 cm x 30 cm).
    *   Place one seedling per hole, ensuring the root collar (where the stem meets the roots) is at the soil surface level.
    *   Gently firm the soil around the base of each seedling to remove air pockets.

4.  **Post-Transplantation Care:**
    *   Immediately after transplanting, water the seedlings thoroughly to help them settle and reduce transplant shock.
    *   If transplanting during a hot period, provide temporary shade for the first 3-5 days to protect the young plants from intense sun.
    *   Maintain consistent moisture in the soil, especially during the establishment phase, but avoid overwatering which can lead to root rot.
    *   Monitor for any signs of pests or diseases, although Tulsi is generally quite hardy.
