As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide scientifically verified advice for managing plant health in Tulsi (Ocimum sanctum/tenuiflorum).

Let's address each of the conditions you've mentioned:

### 1. Fruit Bursting in Tulsi

This is not known to affect Tulsi. Tulsi produces small, dry nutlets (achenes) within its calyx, not fleshy fruits that are prone to bursting due to water imbalances or rapid growth.

### 2. Leaf Burning/Melting in Tulsi

Leaf burning (scorching, browning of margins) and leaf melting (tissue breakdown, becoming mushy) are typically symptoms of abiotic stress or physiological disorders.

**Causes:**

*   **Sunscald/Heat Stress:** Intense direct sunlight, especially during hot summer afternoons in Haryana, can cause leaves to scorch, turn brown, and become crispy.
*   **Water Stress:**
    *   **Drought:** Insufficient water leads to desiccation, causing leaf margins to dry and burn.
    *   **Waterlogging:** Excess water can damage roots, impairing water uptake and leading to symptoms similar to drought stress, including leaf yellowing, wilting, and eventual "melting" or collapse of tissue due as roots rot.
*   **Nutrient Imbalance/Toxicity:**
    *   **Salinity:** High salt content in soil or irrigation water can cause marginal leaf burn.
    *   **Specific Nutrient Toxicities:** E.g., Boron toxicity can cause marginal necrosis.
    *   **Nutrient Deficiencies:** Severe deficiencies of certain nutrients (e.g., Potassium) can sometimes manifest as marginal leaf necrosis.
*   **Chemical Phytotoxicity:** Over-application or improper dilution of fertilizers, pesticides, or herbicides can cause chemical burn on leaves.
*   **Wind Burn:** Strong, hot, dry winds can rapidly desiccate leaves, leading to browning and crisping.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural and Environmental Management:**
    *   **Shade Management:** Provide partial shade (e.g., 30-50% shade net) during the peak summer months (April-June) to protect plants from intense solar radiation and high temperatures.
    *   **Water Management:**
        *   Maintain consistent soil moisture. Water deeply and regularly, especially during dry periods.
        *   Ensure excellent drainage to prevent waterlogging. Avoid planting in areas with poor drainage.
        *   Check the quality of irrigation water for high salinity.
    *   **Mulching:** Apply a 5-10 cm layer of organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves, wood chips) around the base of the plants. This helps conserve soil moisture, regulate soil temperature, and reduce weed competition.
    *   **Wind Protection:** Plant windbreaks or locate Tulsi in sheltered areas to protect from strong, hot, dry winds.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Conduct a soil test to identify any specific nutrient deficiencies or toxicities. Based on the results, apply balanced fertilizers. Avoid excessive application of chemical fertilizers.
    *   **Proper Chemical Application:** Always follow recommended dosages and application methods for any pesticides or fertilizers to prevent phytotoxicity. Avoid spraying during hot, sunny periods.

*   **Chemical Control (for improving resilience and recovery from stress):**
    *   **Potassium nitrate**: Foliar spray at 10-20 g/L (1-2%) during periods of anticipated heat or drought stress to improve plant resilience and water use efficiency.
    *   **Potassium silicate**: Foliar spray at 1-2 ml/L (of a liquid formulation, follow product label for specific concentration) to enhance cell wall strength and improve tolerance to heat, drought, and salinity stress.
    *   **Amino acid** based formulations: Foliar spray at 2-3 ml/L to aid in plant recovery from stress and promote overall vigor.
    *   **Micronutrient Correction (if deficiency is identified by soil test):**
        *   **Zinc sulphate**: Foliar spray at 5 g/L (0.5%) for zinc deficiency.
        *   **Ferrous sulphate**: Foliar spray at 5 g/L (0.5%) for iron deficiency.
        *   **Borax**: Foliar spray at 1-2 g/L (0.1-0.2%) for boron deficiency (use with extreme caution, as excess boron is highly toxic and can cause leaf burn).

### 3. Hardness in Fruit in Tulsi

This is not known to affect Tulsi. As mentioned, Tulsi produces small, dry nutlets (seeds), which are naturally hard when mature. "Hardness" is not a recognized physiological disorder for these structures. If you are referring to difficulty in seed germination, that would be related to seed dormancy, which is a different issue.
