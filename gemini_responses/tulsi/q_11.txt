Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing pests in Tulsi (Holy Basil) in Haryana.

Tulsi is generally quite resilient to many pests due to its natural essential oils. However, occasional infestations can occur.

Regarding your specific concerns:

*   **Sawflies:** This is not known to affect Tulsi.
*   **Weevils:** This is not known to affect Tulsi as a primary pest.

For **Beetles**, various leaf-feeding beetles can occasionally infest Tulsi, causing defoliation. Here's how to manage them:

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Beetles in Tulsi:**

1.  **Cultural and Mechanical Control (First Line of Defence):**
    *   **Regular Monitoring:** Inspect your Tulsi plants frequently for any signs of beetle feeding or presence.
    *   **Hand-picking:** For small infestations, manually remove beetles and their larvae from the plants and destroy them. This is highly effective for home gardens.
    *   **Maintain Plant Health:** Healthy plants are more resistant to pest attacks. Ensure proper watering, sunlight, and nutrient availability.
    *   **Sanitation:** Remove any fallen leaves or plant debris around the Tulsi plants, as these can harbour pests.

2.  **Biological/Botanical Control (Preferred for Tulsi due to its medicinal use):**
    *   If the infestation is persistent or widespread, consider using botanical insecticides.
    *   **Azadirachtin** (Neem-based formulations): This is a natural insecticide derived from the Neem tree. It acts as an antifeedant, repellent, and growth disruptor for many insects, including beetles.
        *   **Dosage:** Use a formulation containing **Azadirachtin** (e.g., 1500 ppm or 3000 ppm) at a rate of 2.5-5 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Application:** Spray thoroughly, ensuring coverage on both sides of the leaves, preferably in the evening. Repeat every 7-10 days if needed.

3.  **Chemical Control (Use with Extreme Caution and as a Last Resort):**
    *   Given that Tulsi is often used for medicinal and religious purposes, chemical pesticide application should be avoided if possible. If the infestation is severe and non-chemical methods have failed, and the plant is not intended for immediate consumption, a CIBRC-approved chemical can be considered.
    *   **Malathion 50% EC:** This is a broad-spectrum organophosphate insecticide effective against chewing pests like beetles.
        *   **Dosage:** 1.5-2 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Application:** Spray thoroughly, ensuring good coverage.
        *   **Important Caution:** If using **Malathion**, observe a minimum pre-harvest interval (PHI) of 7-10 days before consuming or using any part of the plant. It is strongly advised to avoid chemical sprays on Tulsi intended for medicinal or direct consumption.

Always read and follow the instructions and safety precautions on the pesticide label before use. For Tulsi, prioritizing non-chemical and botanical methods is highly recommended to maintain its purity and medicinal value.
