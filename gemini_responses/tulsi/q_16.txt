Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following fertilizer schedule for Tulsi (Holy Basil) cultivation in Haryana. Please remember that **soil testing is the most crucial first step** to determine the exact nutrient deficiencies in your specific field. The recommendations below are general guidelines for average soil conditions.

Tulsi is a medicinal plant, and excessive fertilization, especially with nitrogen, can sometimes reduce the concentration of its active compounds (essential oils). Therefore, a balanced and moderate approach is recommended.

**General Nutrient Targets (per acre):**
*   Nitrogen (N): 40-50 kg
*   Phosphorus (P2O5): 20-25 kg
*   Potassium (K2O): 20-25 kg
*   Sulphur (S): 10-15 kg

**Recommended Fertilizer Doses for Tulsi (per acre):**

**1. Basal Application (at the time of planting/sowing):**
Apply the following fertilizers and thoroughly mix them into the soil before planting.

*   **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP):** 50 kg
    *   *(Provides approximately 9 kg N and 23 kg P2O5)*
*   **Muriate of Potash (MOP):** 40 kg
    *   *(Provides approximately 24 kg K2O)*
*   **Sulphur (elemental Sulphur 90% WDG):** 10 kg
    *   *(Provides approximately 9 kg S)*
*   **Urea:** 25 kg
    *   *(Provides approximately 11.5 kg N)*

    *Alternatively, if your soil test indicates very low Phosphorus and Sulphur, you may consider using:*
    *   **Single Super Phosphate (SSP):** 150 kg (instead of DAP and elemental Sulphur)
        *   *(Provides approximately 24 kg P2O5 and 16.5 kg S)*
    *   And adjust **Urea** to 45-55 kg for basal application (along with **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** 40 kg).

**2. Top Dressing (30-45 days after planting or after the first harvest):**
Broadcast the following fertilizer evenly around the plants and lightly incorporate it into the soil, followed by irrigation.

*   **Urea:** 45-55 kg
    *   *(Provides approximately 20.7-25.3 kg N)*

**3. Nano Fertilizers (Foliar Application):**
Nano fertilizers offer efficient nutrient delivery and can supplement soil-applied fertilizers, especially during critical growth stages.

*   **Nano-Urea (liquid):**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Application:** 2-3 foliar sprays at 15-20 day intervals, starting approximately 30 days after planting.
*   **Nano-DAP (liquid):**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Application:** 1-2 foliar sprays, particularly beneficial during early vegetative growth and at the onset of flowering.

**4. NPK Fertilizers (Compound Fertilizers):**
If you prefer using compound NPK fertilizers, the dose will depend on the specific grade (e.g., 12:32:16, 19:19:19).
*   For a balanced NPK grade like **19:19:19**, you may apply 50-75 kg per acre as a basal dose.
*   However, it is often more precise to use straight fertilizers (Urea, DAP, MOP, SSP) to meet the specific nutrient requirements of Tulsi as outlined above. If using NPK, you will need to adjust subsequent **Urea** applications to meet the remaining nitrogen demand.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Soil Testing:** Always prioritize soil testing. The recommendations above are general; your soil test report will provide precise needs. HAU, Hisar, offers comprehensive soil testing services.
*   **Organic Matter:** Incorporating well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost (5-10 tonnes per acre) during land preparation significantly improves soil health and nutrient availability, reducing the need for chemical fertilizers.
*   **Irrigation:** Ensure adequate and timely irrigation after fertilizer application for proper nutrient uptake.
*   **Avoid Excessive Nitrogen:** While nitrogen promotes vegetative growth, too much can negatively impact the essential oil content and medicinal quality of Tulsi. Stick to the recommended doses.
