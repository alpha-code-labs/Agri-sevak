Yes, Wilt (primarily Fusarium wilt) and conditions leading to sudden wilting (often termed Parawilt, associated with severe root rot) are known to affect Tulsi (*Ocimum tenuiflorum* / *Ocimum sanctum*).

**Causative Agents:**
*   **Wilt:** Primarily caused by soil-borne fungi like *Fusarium oxysporum*. This pathogen invades the roots and blocks the vascular system, leading to yellowing, stunting, and eventual wilting of the plant.
*   **Parawilt:** This term often refers to a sudden, rapid wilting. While not a specific disease, it can be caused by severe root rot pathogens such as *Pythium* spp. or *Phytophthora* spp., which destroy the root system, or an advanced stage of *Fusarium* wilt, especially under stress conditions.

**Control Measures:**

An integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods is most effective for managing wilt in Tulsi.

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Soil Solarization:** Before planting, cover the soil with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks during hot summer months (May-June) to raise soil temperature and kill soil-borne pathogens.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting Tulsi or other susceptible crops in the same field year after year. Rotate with non-host crops for at least 2-3 years.
*   **Proper Drainage:** Ensure good soil drainage to prevent waterlogging, which favors root rot pathogens. Plant on raised beds if drainage is poor.
*   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plants immediately to prevent the spread of pathogens. Clean tools and equipment after use in infected areas.
*   **Sterilized Growing Media:** For nursery raising, use sterilized potting mix or soil.

**2. Biological Control:**
*   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds with bio-control agents before sowing.
    *   *Trichoderma viride* or *Trichoderma harzianum*: 10 g/kg of seeds.
    *   *Pseudomonas fluorescens*: 10 g/kg of seeds.
*   **Soil Application/Drenching:**
    *   *Trichoderma viride* or *Trichoderma harzianum*: Mix 2.5 kg of formulation with 50 kg of Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost and apply per acre, or drench with a solution of 5-10 g/L of water around the root zone.
    *   *Pseudomonas fluorescens*: Mix 2.5 kg of formulation with 50 kg of FYM or compost and apply per acre, or drench with a solution of 5-10 g/L of water around the root zone.

**3. Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved Technical Chemicals):**
For severe cases or as a preventive measure in high-risk areas, chemical control can be integrated. Always follow label instructions for application rates and safety precautions.

*   **Seed Treatment:**
    *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: 2 g/kg of seeds.
    *   **Thiophanate Methyl** 70% WP: 2 g/kg of seeds.
*   **Soil Drenching (at early signs of wilting or as a preventive measure):**
    *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: 1-2 g/L of water, drench around the base of the plant (approx. 100-200 ml per plant depending on size).
    *   **Thiophanate Methyl** 70% WP: 1-1.5 g/L of water, drench around the base of the plant.
    *   **Propamocarb Hydrochloride** 72.2% SL: 2-3 ml/L of water, drench around the base of the plant (effective against *Pythium* and *Phytophthora*).
    *   **Metalaxyl** 8% + **Mancozeb** 64% WP: 2-2.5 g/L of water, drench around the base of the plant (effective against *Pythium* and *Phytophthora*).
    *   **Copper Oxychloride** 50% WP: 2.5-3 g/L of water, drench around the base of the plant.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Early detection and intervention are crucial for effective management.
*   Always ensure proper application techniques and safety measures, including wearing appropriate personal protective equipment.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension services for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions in Haryana.
