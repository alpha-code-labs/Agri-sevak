Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding various rot types in Tulsi (Holy Basil). These rot diseases are indeed a significant challenge, especially under conditions of high humidity, poor drainage, and improper cultural practices.

Tulsi is susceptible to a range of fungal and oomycete pathogens that cause root, stem, foot, collar, crown, neck, seed, and seedling rots. While "Black Rot" or "Fruit Rot" might not be the most common specific disease names for Tulsi, general fungal decay can manifest in these ways on different plant parts, including the seed-bearing structures. Therefore, an integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods is essential for effective control.

Here's a comprehensive strategy:

### I. Cultural Practices (Prevention is Key)

1.  **Soil Management:**
    *   Ensure well-drained soil. Amend heavy clay soils with organic matter (e.g., well-rotted farmyard manure, compost) and sand to improve drainage and aeration.
    *   Consider growing Tulsi in raised beds, especially in areas prone to waterlogging.
2.  **Watering:**
    *   Avoid overwatering. Water only when the topsoil feels dry to touch.
    *   Water at the base of the plant, avoiding overhead irrigation, which can create a humid microclimate conducive to disease development.
    *   Water in the morning to allow foliage to dry before evening.
3.  **Planting Density and Spacing:**
    *   Provide adequate spacing between plants to ensure good air circulation, which helps reduce humidity around the foliage and stem base.
4.  **Sanitation:**
    *   Remove and destroy all infected plant parts (leaves, stems, roots) immediately to prevent the spread of pathogens. Do not compost diseased material.
    *   Clean and sterilize gardening tools regularly, especially after working with infected plants.
5.  **Seed Selection and Treatment:**
    *   Always use healthy, certified, disease-free seeds.
    *   Practice crop rotation if growing Tulsi in fields, avoiding planting Tulsi or other susceptible crops in the same spot year after year.
6.  **Nutrition:**
    *   Provide balanced nutrition to enhance plant vigor and natural resistance. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can lead to lush, soft growth more susceptible to disease.
7.  **Sunlight:**
    *   Ensure Tulsi plants receive adequate sunlight, as shade can increase humidity and favor disease development.

### II. Biological Control

Biological agents can be highly effective in preventing soil-borne diseases by colonizing the root zone and suppressing pathogen growth.

*   **Seed Treatment:**
    *   **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum**: Treat seeds at 5-10 g/kg of seed before sowing.
*   **Soil Application/Drench:**
    *   **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum**: Mix 2.5 kg of formulation with 50 kg of well-decomposed farmyard manure and apply per acre, or drench the soil around the plants with a solution of 5-10 g/L of water.
    *   **Pseudomonas fluorescens**: Apply as a soil drench at 5-10 ml/L of water, or mix 2.5 kg with 50 kg FYM per acre.

### III. Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved Technical Chemicals)

For severe infections or as a preventive measure in high-risk conditions, chemical fungicides can be used. Always follow label instructions for dosage and safety.

**A. For Seed and Seedling Rot (Seed Treatment):**

To protect seeds from soil-borne pathogens causing seed rot and damping-off (seedling rot), treat seeds before sowing.

*   **Carbendazim 50% WP**: 1-2 g/kg of seed.
*   **Thiram 75% WS**: 2-3 g/kg of seed.
*   **Captan 50% WP**: 2-3 g/kg of seed.

**B. For Root, Stem, Foot, Collar, Crown, Neck, and General Rots (Soil Drench/Foliar Spray):**

These applications target established plants affected by various rot types. Soil drenching is particularly effective for soil-borne pathogens.

*   **For Oomycete Rots (e.g., *Pythium*, *Phytophthora* causing damping-off, root, collar, stem rot):**
    *   **Metalaxyl-M 3.3% + Mancozeb 33% WP**: Drench the soil around the base of the plant at 2.5-3 g/L of water. Repeat if necessary, observing the plant's health.
    *   **Propamocarb Hydrochloride 72.2% SL**: Drench the soil at 2-3 ml/L of water.
    *   **Fosetyl-Al 80% WP**: Drench the soil or spray foliage at 2-3 g/L of water.

*   **For Fungal Rots (e.g., *Rhizoctonia*, *Fusarium*, *Sclerotium* causing root, stem, collar, seedling rot):**
    *   **Carbendazim 50% WP**: Drench the soil around the affected plants at 1-1.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Thiophenate Methyl 70% WP**: Drench the soil at 1-1.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Mancozeb 75% WP**: As a soil drench or foliar spray at 2-2.5 g/L of water, particularly useful for broad-spectrum protection.
    *   **Validamycin 3% L**: Drench the soil at 2-3 ml/L of water, especially effective against *Rhizoctonia* species.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Diagnosis:** While these recommendations cover a broad range of rot types, observing specific symptoms can sometimes help in identifying the primary pathogen and selecting the most targeted chemical.
*   **Application Timing:** Apply fungicides preventively if conditions are highly favorable for disease development, or at the first sign of symptoms.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Since Tulsi is often consumed, be mindful of the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) for any chemical applied. For home gardens, prioritizing cultural and biological methods is often preferred.

By implementing these integrated strategies, you can effectively manage and control various rot diseases in your Tulsi plants.
