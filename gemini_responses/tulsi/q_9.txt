Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm that Mites, including Red Spider Mites (Tetranychus urticae) and various Rust Mites (e.g., Aculops spp.), are indeed common and problematic pests for Tulsi (Ocimum tenuiflorum), especially during hot and dry periods in Haryana. They can significantly reduce plant vigour and leaf quality.

Here's a scientifically verified approach to control mites in Tulsi:

**Symptoms of Mite Infestation:**

*   **Red Spider Mites:** Look for fine webbing on the underside of leaves, tiny reddish-brown dots (the mites themselves), yellowing, bronzing, and eventual drying of leaves.
*   **Rust Mites:** These are microscopic and cause symptoms like leaf curling, distortion, bronzing, and a "rusty" appearance on the leaves, often without visible mites or webbing.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategy:**

A combination of cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods is most effective for sustainable mite control in Tulsi.

**1. Cultural Practices:**

*   **Regular Water Spray:** Periodically spray a strong jet of water on the underside of Tulsi leaves, especially during dry weather. This helps dislodge mites and increases humidity, which mites dislike.
*   **Pruning:** Regularly inspect your plants. Remove and destroy heavily infested leaves or branches to reduce the mite population.
*   **Weed Control:** Keep the area around Tulsi plants free of weeds, as they can act as alternate hosts for mites.
*   **Proper Nutrition:** Ensure balanced fertilization. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can promote lush, soft growth that is more attractive to mites.
*   **Good Air Circulation:** Ensure adequate spacing between plants to improve air circulation, which can help deter mites.

**2. Biological and Botanical Control:**

*   **Neem Oil:** A natural botanical insecticide/miticide. Mix 3-5 ml of 1% EC Neem oil per litre of water. Spray thoroughly, ensuring coverage on both upper and lower leaf surfaces. Repeat every 5-7 days, especially during active infestation. While not a synthetic chemical, it's a highly recommended organic option for edible plants.
*   **Predatory Mites:** In larger cultivation areas, introducing natural enemies like predatory mites (e.g., *Amblyseius* species) can be effective. However, this is less practical for small home gardens.

**3. Chemical Control (Acaricides/Miticides):**

**Important Note:** Since Tulsi leaves are often consumed, it is crucial to use chemical controls judiciously. Always adhere to recommended dosages, observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) mentioned on the product label, and prioritize safer options. For home gardens, non-chemical methods or wettable sulphur are generally preferred.

Here are CIBRC (Central Insecticides Board & Registration Committee) approved technical chemical names for mite control, along with their recommended dosages:

*   **Wettable Sulphur (80% WP):**
    *   Dosage: **2.0 - 2.5 grams per litre of water.**
    *   Application: Effective against both spider mites and rust mites. It also has fungicidal properties. Ensure thorough coverage, especially on the underside of leaves. Repeat every 7-10 days if infestation persists. Apply during cooler parts of the day to avoid phytotoxicity.

*   **Spiromesifen (22.9% SC):**
    *   Dosage: **0.5 - 0.7 ml per litre of water.**
    *   Application: A highly effective ovicidal and larvicidal miticide. Apply thoroughly, covering all leaf surfaces.

*   **Fenpyroximate (5% SC):**
    *   Dosage: **1.0 - 1.5 ml per litre of water.**
    *   Application: A contact and stomach action miticide, effective against all life stages. Ensure good coverage.

*   **Abamectin (1.9% EC):**
    *   Dosage: **0.4 - 0.5 ml per litre of water.**
    *   Application: A translaminar miticide, effective against various mites. Apply thoroughly, ensuring coverage of both upper and lower leaf surfaces.

*   **Propargite (57% EC):**
    *   Dosage: **1.0 - 1.5 ml per litre of water.**
    *   Application: A broad-spectrum miticide with contact action. Ensure complete coverage.

**General Recommendations for Chemical Application:**

*   **Read the Label:** Always read and strictly follow the instructions, precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI) mentioned on the product label.
*   **Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):** Wear appropriate PPE (gloves, mask, eye protection) during mixing and application.
*   **Rotation:** Rotate different classes of miticides to prevent the development of resistance in mite populations.
*   **Timing:** Apply sprays during the cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize evaporation, improve efficacy, and reduce the risk of phytotoxicity.
*   **Spot Treatment:** For small infestations, consider spot treatment of affected areas rather than spraying the entire plant.

By implementing these strategies, you can effectively manage mite populations and ensure healthy Tulsi plants.
