This is not known to affect Onion.

Onion (Allium cepa) is primarily cultivated for its bulb, which is a modified stem. The terms "Flower drop," "Fruit drop," and "Tinda/Boll dropping" are typically associated with fruit-bearing crops (like tomato, chilli, cotton, tinda, etc.) where the flower or fruit is the economic part or directly contributes to the economic yield.

While onions do produce flowers and subsequently seeds (if grown for seed production), the "dropping" of flowers or seed capsules is not a commonly recognized or significant issue impacting bulb yield in commercial onion cultivation. The term "Tinda/Boll dropping" is entirely unrelated to onion.
