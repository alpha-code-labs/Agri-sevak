Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the challenges posed by environmental stresses to onion cultivation in Haryana. Protecting your onion crop from extreme cold, frost, heat (Loo), and intense sunlight is crucial for a healthy yield. Here is scientifically verified advice:

### 1. Protection from Extreme Cold and Frost

Extreme cold and frost can cause significant damage to onion leaves and bulbs, leading to reduced yield and quality.

*   **Irrigation:** Apply a light irrigation to the field in the late afternoon or early evening before a predicted frost event. Water has a higher specific heat capacity than air, and the latent heat released as water freezes can slightly raise the temperature around the plants, protecting them. This also increases humidity, which can reduce frost damage.
*   **Mulching:** For smaller areas or nurseries, apply a layer of organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves) around the base of the plants. This insulates the soil, keeping it warmer and protecting shallow roots.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure adequate **Potassium** (K) nutrition. Potassium plays a vital role in improving plant tolerance to cold stress.
    *   Foliar spray of **Potassium Nitrate** (13-0-45) at 0.5-1.0% concentration (5-10 g/L of water) can be applied before or after a cold spell to help plants recover and build tolerance.
*   **Windbreaks:** Planting natural windbreaks (e.g., taller crops like mustard or wheat on the windward side) or using artificial barriers can reduce the direct impact of cold winds.
*   **Smudging (Smoke Cover):** In specific situations and for smaller areas, creating a smoke cover by burning biomass on the upwind side of the field can help trap heat and prevent temperature drops at ground level. However, this needs careful management and consideration of air quality.

### 2. Protection from Heat (Loo) and Intense Sunlight

High temperatures, especially accompanied by hot, dry winds (Loo), and intense sunlight can lead to scorching, wilting, and reduced bulb development.

*   **Irrigation:** Maintain optimal soil moisture through frequent, light irrigations during hot periods. This helps in evaporative cooling of the plant canopy and prevents wilting. Avoid water stress at all costs.
*   **Mulching:** Apply organic mulch (e.g., straw, crop residues) to the soil surface. This helps in reducing soil temperature, conserving soil moisture, and preventing direct sun exposure to the soil, which can damage shallow roots.
*   **Shade Nets:** For high-value onion nurseries or small plots, installing 30-50% shade nets can significantly reduce temperature and intense sunlight, protecting young plants. This is generally not practical for large-scale field cultivation.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure balanced nutrition, particularly adequate **Potassium** (K) and **Calcium** (Ca), which contribute to cell wall strength and turgor maintenance, improving heat tolerance.
    *   Foliar spray of **Potassium Nitrate** (13-0-45) at 0.5-1.0% concentration (5-10 g/L of water) can help plants cope with heat stress.
    *   Foliar spray of **Calcium Nitrate** (15.5-0-0-18.8Ca) at 0.5% concentration (5 g/L of water) can also be beneficial.
*   **Planting Density:** Maintain optimal plant spacing. Overly dense planting can lead to competition for water and nutrients, while very sparse planting exposes more soil to direct sun.
*   **Biostimulants:** Some amino acid-based formulations or seaweed extracts can help plants recover from stress by promoting metabolic activity. While specific technical chemical names for these are not typically CIBRC-approved as pesticides, general formulations are available as plant growth promoters. Consult your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations on such products.

By implementing these practices, you can significantly mitigate the adverse effects of environmental stresses on your onion crop and ensure a healthy harvest. Always remember to consult with your local HAU extension scientist for specific advice tailored to your field conditions.
