As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm that "drying up" of plant parts, specifically leaves, flower stalks, and umbels (which contain the seeds, not typical fruits), is a common and concerning symptom in onion cultivation in Haryana. This condition can be caused by a variety of factors, including fungal diseases, insect pests, and physiological stresses. Accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective management.

Here are the common causes of drying up in onion and their scientifically verified management strategies:

### 1. Fungal Diseases

Fungal pathogens are a major cause of drying up symptoms in onion, especially during periods of high humidity and moderate temperatures.

*   **Purple Blotch (Alternaria porri) and Stemphylium Blight (Stemphylium vesicarium):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Initially, small, water-soaked lesions appear on leaves, which enlarge, turn purple to brown, and often develop a yellow halo. These lesions coalesce, leading to extensive blighting and drying of leaves from the tip downwards. Flower stalks can also be affected, causing them to collapse and the umbels to dry prematurely.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural Practices:** Use disease-free seeds/bulbs, maintain proper plant spacing for good air circulation, ensure good field sanitation by removing crop residues, and avoid overhead irrigation late in the day.
        *   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):** Apply fungicides preventively or at the first sign of disease, rotating different modes of action to prevent resistance.
            *   **Mancozeb** (2.5 kg/acre)
            *   **Chlorothalonil** (1.0 kg/acre)
            *   **Azoxystrobin** (200 ml/acre)
            *   **Difenoconazole** (100 ml/acre)
            *   **Propiconazole** (200 ml/acre)
            *   **Pyraclostrobin** (150-200 ml/acre)
            *   **Fluxapyroxad + Pyraclostrobin** (300 ml/acre)
            *   **Azoxystrobin + Difenoconazole** (200 ml/acre)

*   **Downy Mildew (Peronospora destructor):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Pale green to yellow spots or streaks appear on older leaves. In humid conditions, a characteristic purplish mold may be visible on the lesions. Infected leaves become pale, collapse, and dry from the tip. Flower stalks can also be affected, leading to their drying.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural Practices:** Use resistant varieties if available, ensure good air circulation, and avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization.
        *   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):** Start spraying preventively during cool, humid weather conditions.
            *   **Metalaxyl-M + Mancozeb** (1.0 kg/acre)
            *   **Cymoxanil + Mancozeb** (1.2 kg/acre)
            *   **Dimethomorph** (200 ml/acre)
            *   **Fluopicolide + Propamocarb hydrochloride** (300 ml/acre)

*   **Fusarium Basal Rot (Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cepae):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Yellowing and dieback of leaves from the tip downwards, often starting with older leaves. The plant eventually wilts and dries. Bulbs show a soft, watery rot at the base, often with pinkish fungal growth.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural Practices:** Use resistant varieties, practice crop rotation (3-4 years), avoid injuring bulbs during cultivation, and ensure proper drainage.
        *   **Seed Treatment:**
            *   **Carbendazim** (2 g/kg seed)
            *   **Thiophanate Methyl** (2 g/kg seed)
            *   **Trichoderma viride** (4 g/kg seed)
        *   **Soil Drench (at transplanting or early growth):**
            *   **Carbendazim** (1.0 g/L water)
            *   **Thiophanate Methyl** (1.0 g/L water)

### 2. Insect Pests

Certain insect pests can cause significant damage leading to drying up of onion foliage.

*   **Thrips (Thrips tabaci):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Thrips feed by rasping the leaf surface and sucking the sap, causing characteristic silvery streaks or patches on leaves. This is followed by browning and drying of leaf tips. Severe infestations lead to distorted growth, stunted plants, and premature drying of foliage and flower stalks.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural Practices:** Remove onion crop residues, destroy weeds that can harbor thrips, and use overhead irrigation to dislodge thrips.
        *   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):** Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance. Apply early in the morning or late in the evening for best efficacy.
            *   **Fipronil** (400 ml/acre)
            *   **Imidacloprid** (100-125 ml/acre)
            *   **Thiamethoxam** (100 g/acre)
            *   **Spinosad** (60-75 ml/acre)
            *   **Acetamiprid** (100 g/acre)
            *   **Cyantraniliprole** (180 ml/acre)

### 3. Physiological/Environmental Stress

Non-pathogenic factors can also lead to drying up symptoms.

*   **Water Stress:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Leaves wilt, turn yellow, and eventually dry out. Both insufficient water (drought) and excessive water (waterlogging) can cause similar symptoms by impairing root function and nutrient uptake.
    *   **Management:** Ensure consistent and adequate irrigation. Avoid both water scarcity and waterlogging. Use drip irrigation for efficient water management.

*   **Nutrient Deficiencies (e.g., Potassium):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Leaf tips turn yellow, then brown and dry (often referred to as tip burn).
    *   **Management:** Conduct soil testing to identify specific nutrient deficiencies. Apply balanced fertilizers as per recommendations. For potassium deficiency, apply **Muriate of Potash (Potassium Chloride)** or **Sulphate of Potash (Potassium Sulphate)** as per soil test results.

*   **Heat Stress/Sun Scorch:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Leaves develop bleached or scorched areas, particularly on exposed surfaces, leading to drying. This is common during periods of intense heat and low humidity.
    *   **Management:** Ensure adequate soil moisture to help plants cope with high temperatures. Consider planting heat-tolerant varieties.

### General Recommendations:

*   **Integrated Pest Management (IPM):** Always combine cultural, biological, and chemical methods for sustainable and effective management.
*   **Scouting:** Regularly monitor your crop for early signs of diseases and pests to enable timely intervention.
*   **Diagnosis:** If you are unsure about the exact cause, collect samples and consult with HAU experts for accurate diagnosis and specific recommendations.
*   **Adherence to Labels:** Always read and strictly follow the instructions on pesticide labels for correct dosage, application method, pre-harvest interval, and safety precautions.
