### Control of Fungal Diseases in Onion

**1. Alternaria (Purple Blotch)**
This is a significant fungal disease in onion, caused by *Alternaria porri*.
*   **Symptoms:** Small, water-soaked lesions appear on leaves, which enlarge, turn purple, and develop characteristic concentric rings. Severe infection can lead to blighting and premature drying of leaves.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Preventive Sprays (start when symptoms first appear or during humid conditions):**
        *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP: 2-2.5 kg per acre (or 2-2.5 g/L of water).
        *   **Chlorothalonil** 75% WP: 1.5-2 kg per acre (or 1.5-2 g/L of water).
    *   **Curative/Systemic Sprays (for established infections):**
        *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC: 200 ml per acre (or 0.5 ml/L of water).
        *   **Propiconazole** 25% EC: 200-250 ml per acre (or 0.5-0.6 ml/L of water).
        *   **Difenoconazole** 25% EC: 100-150 ml per acre (or 0.25-0.4 ml/L of water).
        *   **Pyraclostrobin** 20% WG: 150-200 ml per acre (or 0.4-0.5 ml/L of water).
        *   **Tebuconazole** 25% WG: 250-300 g per acre (or 0.6-0.75 g/L of water).
        *   **Fluxapyroxad + Pyraclostrobin** (e.g., 6.25% + 6.25% SC): 300-400 ml per acre (or 0.75-1 ml/L of water).
        *   **Azoxystrobin + Difenoconazole** (e.g., 11% + 18.2% SC): 200-300 ml per acre (or 0.5-0.75 ml/L of water).

**2. Anthracnose (Onion Smudge)**
This disease is caused by *Colletotrichum circinans*. While it can occur in the field, it is more commonly a post-harvest issue affecting the outer scales.
*   **Symptoms:** Small, dark green to black spots or concentric rings on the outer scales, especially near the neck of the bulb.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Field Application (if severe):**
        *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP: 2-2.5 kg per acre (or 2-2.5 g/L of water).
        *   **Chlorothalonil** 75% WP: 1.5-2 kg per acre (or 1.5-2 g/L of water).
        *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC: 200 ml per acre (or 0.5 ml/L of water).
    *   **Seed Treatment (for prevention):**
        *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: 1-1.5 g per kg of seed.

**3. Blast**
This is not known to affect Onion.

**4. Blight (e.g., Stemphylium Blight)**
Stemphylium blight, caused by *Stemphylium vesicarium*, is another common blight disease in onion, often occurring alongside or confused with Purple Blotch.
*   **Symptoms:** Small, light yellow to brown, water-soaked lesions that enlarge, become elongated, and turn purplish-brown. Severe infection leads to blighting and drying of leaves.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   The fungicides recommended for Alternaria (Purple Blotch) are generally effective against Stemphylium Blight as well.
        *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP: 2-2.5 kg per acre (or 2-2.5 g/L of water).
        *   **Chlorothalonil** 75% WP: 1.5-2 kg per acre (or 1.5-2 g/L of water).
        *   **Propiconazole** 25% EC: 200-250 ml per acre (or 0.5-0.6 ml/L of water).
        *   **Difenoconazole** 25% EC: 100-150 ml per acre (or 0.25-0.4 ml/L of water).
        *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC: 200 ml per acre (or 0.5 ml/L of water).
        *   **Pyraclostrobin** 20% WG: 150-200 ml per acre (or 0.4-0.5 ml/L of water).
        *   **Tebuconazole** 25% WG: 250-300 g per acre (or 0.6-0.75 g/L of water).
        *   **Fluxapyroxad + Pyraclostrobin** (e.g., 6.25% + 6.25% SC): 300-400 ml per acre (or 0.75-1 ml/L of water).
        *   **Azoxystrobin + Difenoconazole** (e.g., 11% + 18.2% SC): 200-300 ml per acre (or 0.5-0.75 ml/L of water).

**5. Brown spot**
This is not known to affect Onion as a specific disease name. Many fungal diseases can cause brown spots as a symptom, but "Brown spot" itself is not a recognized disease of onion.

**6. Downy Mildew**
This is a serious disease of onion, caused by *Peronospora destructor*.
*   **Symptoms:** Pale green to yellow spots or streaks on older leaves, often covered with a characteristic purplish-grey fuzzy growth (sporangiophores) during cool, humid conditions. Infected leaves may collapse from the tip.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Preventive Sprays (crucial, especially during cool, moist weather):**
        *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP: 2-2.5 kg per acre (or 2-2.5 g/L of water).
        *   **Chlorothalonil** 75% WP: 1.5-2 kg per acre (or 1.5-2 g/L of water).
        *   **Propineb** 70% WP: 1.5-2 kg per acre (or 3.75-5 g/L of water).
    *   **Curative/Systemic Sprays (for established infections, often specific for Oomycetes):**
        *   **Dimethomorph** 50% WP: 250-300 g per acre (or 0.6-0.75 g/L of water).
        *   **Cymoxanil + Mancozeb** (e.g., 8% + 64% WP): 600-750 g per acre (or 1.5-2 g/L of water).
        *   **Fenamidone + Mancozeb** (e.g., 10% + 50% WG): 1 kg per acre (or 2.5 g/L of water).
        *   **Iprovalicarb + Propineb** (e.g., 5.5% + 61.25% WP): 1.5-2 kg per acre (or 3.75-5 g/L of water).
        *   **Fluopicolide + Propamocarb Hydrochloride** (e.g., 6.25% + 62.5% SC): 600-750 ml per acre (or 1.5-2 ml/L of water).
        *   **Mandipropamid** 23.4% SC: 200-250 ml per acre (or 0.5-0.6 ml/L of water).
        *   **Amisulbrom** 20% SC: 200-250 ml per acre (or 0.5-0.6 ml/L of water).

**General Recommendations for Integrated Disease Management:**

*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice a minimum 3-year crop rotation with non-allium crops to reduce pathogen inoculum in the soil.
*   **Healthy Planting Material:** Use certified, disease-free seeds or bulbs. Consider seed treatment with recommended fungicides.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest. Avoid leaving volunteer onion plants.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Maintain adequate plant spacing to ensure good air circulation, which helps reduce humidity and fungal growth.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced fertilizers. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can lead to lush growth more susceptible to diseases.
*   **Irrigation Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation late in the day, especially during periods conducive to fungal diseases. Drip irrigation is preferred.
*   **Weed Control:** Keep the field free of weeds, as they can act as alternate hosts for pathogens and impede air circulation.
*   **Fungicide Rotation:** To prevent the development of fungicide resistance, always rotate fungicides with different modes of action. Do not rely on a single chemical.
*   **Timely Application:** Apply fungicides preventively or at the very first sign of disease for best results. Follow the recommended spray intervals.

Always read and follow the instructions on the product label for specific dosages, application methods, and safety precautions. For any specific concerns or severe outbreaks, please consult your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts.
