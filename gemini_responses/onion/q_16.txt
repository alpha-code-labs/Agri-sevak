As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend the following fertilizer schedule for Onion cultivation in Haryana. Please note that these are general recommendations, and a soil test is always advisable for precise nutrient management tailored to your specific field conditions.

**General Fertilizer Recommendation for Onion (N:P:K:S): 120:60:60:25 kg/acre**

This translates to the following fertilizer doses:

### **A. Basal Application (at the time of transplanting):**

Apply the following fertilizers uniformly and incorporate them into the soil before transplanting:

*   **DAP (Di-Ammonium Phosphate):** 130 kg/acre (This provides approximately 23 kg Nitrogen and 60 kg Phosphorus (P2O5)).
*   **Potash (Muriate of Potash - MOP):** 100 kg/acre (This provides approximately 60 kg Potassium (K2O)).
*   **Sulphur (Elemental Sulphur 90%):** 28 kg/acre (This provides approximately 25 kg Sulphur).
*   **Urea:** 36 kg/acre (This provides the remaining basal Nitrogen, approximately 17 kg N).

### **B. Top Dressing (Remaining Nitrogen):**

The remaining 80 kg Nitrogen per acre should be applied in two equal splits during the crop growth period.

*   **1st Top Dressing (30-40 days after transplanting):**
    *   **Urea:** 87 kg/acre (This provides approximately 40 kg Nitrogen).
    *   *Alternatively, or as a supplement:* **Nano-Urea:** 2-4 ml/L water (e.g., 400-1000 ml per acre in 200-250 L water). Apply as a foliar spray. This can partially replace 25-50% of the conventional Urea in this split.
    *   *As a supplement:* **Nano-DAP:** 2-4 ml/L water (e.g., 400-1000 ml per acre in 200-250 L water). Apply as a foliar spray if an early phosphorus boost is required.

*   **2nd Top Dressing (60-70 days after transplanting):**
    *   **Urea:** 87 kg/acre (This provides approximately 40 kg Nitrogen).
    *   *Alternatively, or as a supplement:* **Nano-Urea:** 2-4 ml/L water (e.g., 400-1000 ml per acre in 200-250 L water). Apply as a foliar spray. This can partially replace 25-50% of the conventional Urea in this split.

### **C. Alternative Fertilizer Options:**

*   **SSP (Single Super Phosphate):** If you prefer to use SSP instead of DAP for Phosphorus and Sulphur:
    *   **Basal Application:**
        *   **SSP:** 375 kg/acre (This provides approximately 60 kg Phosphorus (P2O5) and 41 kg Sulphur).
        *   **Potash (Muriate of Potash - MOP):** 100 kg/acre (This provides approximately 60 kg Potassium (K2O)).
        *   **Urea:** 87 kg/acre (This provides approximately 40 kg Nitrogen).
    *   *Top dressing with Urea and Nano-Urea/Nano-DAP remains the same as above.*

*   **NPK (Complex Fertilizers):** If using complex NPK fertilizers (e.g., 12:32:16, 19:19:19) for basal application, the doses of individual fertilizers (Urea, DAP, Potash) will need to be adjusted to meet the N, P, K requirements.
    *   For example, if using **NPK (12:32:16)** for basal application to provide 60 kg P2O5:
        *   **NPK (12:32:16):** 187.5 kg/acre (This provides approximately 22.5 kg N, 60 kg P2O5, and 30 kg K2O).
        *   **Urea:** 38 kg/acre (To provide the remaining basal N, approximately 17.5 kg N).
        *   **Potash (Muriate of Potash - MOP):** 50 kg/acre (To provide the remaining basal K2O, approximately 30 kg K2O).
        *   **Sulphur (Elemental Sulphur 90%):** 28 kg/acre (This provides approximately 25 kg Sulphur).
    *   *Top dressing with Urea and Nano-Urea/Nano-DAP remains the same as above.*

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Soil Testing:** Always conduct a soil test to determine the exact nutrient status of your field. This will help in fine-tuning the fertilizer doses for optimal results and to avoid over-application.
*   **Irrigation:** Ensure adequate moisture in the soil after fertilizer application, especially for basal doses and top-dressing, to facilitate nutrient uptake.
*   **Micronutrients:** If soil tests indicate deficiencies, consider applying micronutrients like Zinc, Boron, or Manganese as per recommendations.
