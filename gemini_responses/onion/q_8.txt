As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling sucking pests in onion in Haryana:

**Regarding Psylla:**
This is not known to affect Onion.

For the control of Aphids, Leafhopper, Whitefly, and Thrips in Onion, an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is recommended, combining cultural practices with judicious use of CIBRC approved chemical insecticides.

**General Management Practices:**
*   **Regular Monitoring:** Regularly scout fields to detect pest infestations early.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove crop residues and weeds that can harbor pests.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can make plants more attractive to sucking pests.
*   **Water Management:** Ensure proper irrigation to reduce plant stress.
*   **Encourage Natural Enemies:** Protect and encourage beneficial insects like ladybird beetles, lacewings, and syrphid flies, which prey on aphids and thrips.

**Chemical Control (Apply when pest populations reach economic threshold levels):**
Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Ensure thorough spray coverage.

*   **For Thrips, Aphids, Leafhoppers, and Whiteflies:**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply 125-150 ml per acre in 200-250 L of water. Effective against a broad spectrum of sucking pests.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply 50-100 g per acre in 200-250 L of water. Provides excellent control of thrips, aphids, and whiteflies.
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply 50-100 g per acre in 200-250 L of water. Highly effective against aphids and whiteflies, also controls thrips.
    *   **Fipronil 5% SC:** Apply 300-400 ml per acre in 200-250 L of water. Particularly effective against thrips, also controls aphids.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** Apply 200-250 ml per acre in 200-250 L of water. A broad-spectrum insecticide effective against thrips, aphids, and leafhoppers.
    *   **Flupyradifurone 17.09% SL:** Apply 200 ml per acre in 200-250 L of water. A newer insecticide effective against a wide range of sucking pests including aphids, whiteflies, and leafhoppers.
    *   **Cyantraniliprole 10.26% OD:** Apply 180 ml per acre in 200-250 L of water. Effective against thrips, aphids, and leafhoppers.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the insecticide label for correct dosage, application method, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and safety precautions.
*   Spray during the cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to enhance efficacy and minimize drift.
*   Ensure proper safety gear (gloves, mask, protective clothing) is used during handling and application of chemicals.
