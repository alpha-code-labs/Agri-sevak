As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified recommendations for the use of growth regulators and micronutrients in Onion cultivation in Haryana:

It is crucial to understand the specific purpose and application rates for each compound to ensure optimal results and prevent any adverse effects.

*   **Ethephon** (Growth Regulator for Maturity and Uniformity)
    *   **Purpose:** To promote early and uniform bulb maturity, facilitate neck fall, and improve bulb size and quality.
    *   **Recommended Dose:** Apply **Ethephon** (39% SL formulation) at 160-320 ml per acre, dissolved in 200-250 litres of water. This typically corresponds to a concentration of 250-500 ppm.
    *   **Timing:** Apply as a foliar spray approximately 3-4 weeks before the anticipated harvest, when about 50% of the plants show neck fall. Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.

*   **2,4-D** (Herbicide)
    *   **Recommendation:** This is not recommended for use as a growth regulator in Onion.
    *   **Reason:** 2,4-D is a synthetic auxin primarily used as a selective herbicide in many crops. Onion is highly sensitive to 2,4-D, and even very low concentrations or drift can cause severe phytotoxicity, leading to malformed bulbs, reduced yield, and significant crop damage. Therefore, its application as a growth regulator in onion is strongly discouraged.

*   **Boron** (Micronutrient)
    *   **Purpose:** Boron is an essential micronutrient vital for cell wall formation, sugar transport, cell division, and pollen viability. Its deficiency can lead to stunted growth, hollow or cracked bulbs, and poor seed development.
    *   **Recommended Dose (Foliar Application):** Apply **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (containing 20% Boron) at 100-200 g per acre, dissolved in 200-250 litres of water. This provides a solution concentration of approximately 0.04-0.08%.
    *   **Timing:** Apply as a foliar spray during the active vegetative growth phase and again during bulb development. If deficiency symptoms are observed or soil tests indicate low boron levels, multiple applications may be beneficial.
    *   **Recommended Dose (Soil Application):** If soil tests indicate severe boron deficiency, **Disodium tetraborate decahydrate** (Borax, containing 10.5-11.3% Boron) can be applied at 1-2 kg per acre, mixed with fertilizer, before planting or as a side dressing. However, foliar application is generally preferred for quick correction and efficient uptake.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the specific instructions and safety precautions on the product label.
*   Ensure proper spray coverage for foliar applications.
*   Avoid spraying during hot periods of the day or when rain is expected shortly after application.
*   For any specific field conditions or uncertainties, it is always advisable to consult with local agricultural extension officers or HAU experts.
