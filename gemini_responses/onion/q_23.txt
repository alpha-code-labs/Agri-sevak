As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified seed and soil treatment processes for Onion cultivation in Haryana to ensure healthy crop establishment and mitigate early-season pest and disease challenges.

It is crucial to adopt an Integrated Pest and Disease Management (IPDM) approach, where chemical treatments are judiciously combined with biological methods and good agricultural practices.

### Recommended Seed Treatment Process for Onion

Seed treatment is vital for protecting germinating seeds and young seedlings from seed-borne and soil-borne pathogens, as well as early-season insect pests.

1.  **Fungicidal Seed Treatment (Mandatory):**
    This protects against damping-off, basal rot, and other seed-borne fungal diseases.
    *   **Option 1 (Broad-spectrum):** Treat seeds with **Carbendazim 50% WP** at a rate of **2 grams per kilogram of seed**.
    *   **Option 2 (For specific fungal complexes including Oomycetes):** Treat seeds with **Thiram 75% WS** at a rate of **2.5-3 grams per kilogram of seed**. If damping-off caused by oomycetes (e.g., *Pythium*, *Phytophthora*) is a known issue, **Metalaxyl 35% WS** can be used at **6 grams per kilogram of seed**.
    *   **Method:** Mix the required quantity of fungicide thoroughly with the onion seeds in a suitable container or seed treatment drum until the seeds are uniformly coated. Allow the seeds to dry slightly in the shade before sowing.

2.  **Insecticidal Seed Treatment (If early sucking pests like thrips are a concern):**
    This provides early protection against sucking pests.
    *   Treat seeds with **Imidacloprid 70% WS** at a rate of **7 grams per kilogram of seed**.
    *   **Method:** Apply after fungicidal treatment. Mix thoroughly until seeds are uniformly coated. Allow to dry in shade.

3.  **Biological Seed Treatment (Recommended for enhanced protection and plant vigour):**
    *   Treat seeds with **Trichoderma viride 1% WP** at a rate of **4-5 grams per kilogram of seed**.
    *   **Method:** This should ideally be done just before sowing, after any chemical treatments. Mix the bio-agent with a small amount of water to make a slurry, then coat the seeds evenly. Dry in shade. *Note: If using biological agents, ensure they are compatible with the chosen chemical treatments, or apply them separately just before sowing.*

### Recommended Soil Treatment Process for Onion

Soil treatment aims to manage soil-borne diseases and pests that can affect onion plants throughout their growth cycle.

1.  **Biological Soil Treatment (Highly Recommended):**
    This is a foundational step for managing soil-borne diseases and improving soil health.
    *   Apply **Trichoderma viride 1% WP** at a rate of **2-4 kilograms per acre**.
    *   **Method:** Mix the required quantity of **Trichoderma viride** with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost. Keep the mixture moist and covered for 7-10 days in a shaded area to allow the *Trichoderma* to multiply. Broadcast this enriched FYM/compost evenly over the field and incorporate it into the soil during the final land preparation, at least 7-10 days before transplanting or sowing.

2.  **Fungicidal Soil Treatment (If severe soil-borne disease history):**
    For areas with a known history of severe damping-off, basal rot, or white rot.
    *   **Option 1 (Broad-spectrum):** Apply **Carbendazim 50% WP** at a rate of **1-2 kilograms per acre**.
    *   **Method:** Mix the fungicide with 50-100 kg of sand or dry soil and broadcast evenly over the field, incorporating it into the soil during land preparation. Alternatively, drench the nursery beds or transplanting pits with a solution of **Carbendazim 50% WP** at **1-2 grams per litre of water**.
    *   **Option 2 (For Oomycete-related diseases):** If diseases like damping-off or white rot caused by *Sclerotium* or *Pythium* are prevalent, apply **Metalaxyl 8% + Mancozeb 64% WP** at a rate of **2.5 kilograms per acre**.
    *   **Method:** Mix with sand/FYM and broadcast, or drench at **2.5 grams per litre of water**.

3.  **Nematicidal Soil Treatment (If Root-Knot Nematodes are a confirmed problem):**
    Root-knot nematodes (*Meloidogyne* spp.) can cause significant damage to onion roots.
    *   Apply **Fluensulfone 2% GR** at a rate of **10 kilograms per acre**.
    *   **Method:** Apply the granular nematicide evenly in the soil at the time of transplanting or sowing and incorporate it into the root zone.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label for specific dosage, application methods, and safety precautions.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Ensure proper soil moisture for effective action of both chemical and biological treatments.
*   These recommendations are general; specific local conditions and pest/disease pressure may require adjustments. Consult with local agricultural extension specialists for tailored advice.
