As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following doses of organic manures and biostimulants for onion cultivation in Haryana:

1.  **Farmyard Manure (FYM):**
    *   Apply 15-20 tonnes per acre of well-decomposed FYM.
    *   It should be incorporated into the soil at least 2-3 weeks before transplanting onion seedlings or sowing seeds. This improves soil structure, water holding capacity, and provides essential macro and micronutrients.

2.  **Vermicompost:**
    *   Apply 4-5 tonnes per acre of high-quality vermicompost.
    *   Similar to FYM, it should be incorporated into the soil before transplanting/sowing. Vermicompost is richer in nutrients and microbial activity compared to FYM, promoting better plant growth and soil health.

3.  **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract Biostimulant):**
    *   Sagarika is a seaweed extract-based biostimulant, not a bulk organic manure like FYM or vermicompost. It enhances nutrient uptake, promotes root development, and improves overall plant vigor.
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Mix **2.5-3.0 ml of Sagarika per litre of water**.
        *   Spray 2-3 times during the crop cycle:
            *   First spray: 20-25 days after transplanting/sowing.
            *   Second spray: 40-45 days after transplanting/sowing (at bulb initiation stage).
            *   Third spray (optional): At bulb development stage, if required.
    *   **Soil Application/Drench:**
        *   Apply **500 ml to 1 litre of Sagarika per acre** mixed with irrigation water or as a drench around the root zone, especially during early growth stages or at bulb initiation.
