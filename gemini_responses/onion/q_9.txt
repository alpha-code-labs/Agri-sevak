Mites, including Red spider mite (Tetranychus urticae) and Onion rust mite (Aceria tulipae), are significant pests of onion in Haryana, causing considerable damage if not managed effectively. The Onion rust mite, in particular, is a serious pest that can cause stunting, twisting, and silvery streaks on leaves, leading to reduced bulb size and yield.

Effective control requires an integrated approach:

**I. Cultural and Mechanical Control (Integrated Pest Management - IPM):**

1.  **Regular Monitoring:** Frequently inspect onion fields, especially the undersides of leaves, for early signs of mite infestation (fine webbing, silvery streaks, stippling, or the mites themselves). Early detection is crucial for effective management.
2.  **Weed Management:** Keep the field and surrounding areas free of weeds, as many weeds serve as alternate hosts for mites.
3.  **Proper Irrigation:** Ensure adequate and timely irrigation. Water stress can exacerbate mite infestations. Overhead irrigation can sometimes help dislodge mites, but care must be taken to avoid creating conditions favorable for fungal diseases.
4.  **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops to break the pest cycle.
5.  **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy severely infested plant debris after harvest to reduce overwintering populations.

**II. Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved Acaricides):**

When mite populations reach economic threshold levels, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves, where mites often reside. Rotate different classes of acaricides to prevent the development of resistance.

Here are some CIBRC approved technical chemical names for mite control in onion:

*   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:**
    *   Dosage: 0.5 ml per litre of water (or 125 ml per acre).
*   **Propargite 57% EC:**
    *   Dosage: 2 ml per litre of water (or 500 ml per acre).
*   **Fenpyroximate 5% EC:**
    *   Dosage: 1 ml per litre of water (or 250 ml per acre).
*   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP:**
    *   Dosage: 6 g per litre of water (or 1.5 kg per acre). This is particularly effective against rust mites and also helps in managing powdery mildew.
*   **Abamectin 1.9% EC:**
    *   Dosage: 0.6 ml per litre of water (or 150 ml per acre).

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Spray Volume:** Ensure adequate spray volume (typically 200-250 litres per acre) for thorough coverage.
*   **Rotation:** Rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.
*   **Safety:** Always read and follow the instructions on the product label, including dosage, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and safety precautions (wearing protective gear).
*   **Timing:** Apply acaricides when mites are first observed and before populations build up significantly. Repeat application may be necessary based on infestation severity and product label recommendations.
