Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding soil pests like termites and nematodes in onion cultivation. These pests can significantly reduce yield and quality if not managed effectively. Here's a scientifically verified approach for their control in Haryana:

It is crucial to adopt an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural practices with judicious use of CIBRC-approved chemical controls. Always ensure proper diagnosis of the pest problem before applying any control measures.

### 1. Control of Termites (Deemak) in Onion

Termites can cause significant damage by feeding on roots and bulbs, leading to wilting and plant death.

**Cultural Practices:**
*   **Deep Ploughing:** Expose termite colonies to sunlight and predators by deep ploughing during summer.
*   **Removal of Crop Residues:** Clear fields of stubble, weeds, and other organic debris that can serve as food sources or shelter for termites.
*   **Proper Irrigation:** Maintain adequate soil moisture, as termites prefer dry conditions.
*   **Avoid Farmyard Manure with Termites:** Do not use farmyard manure that is infested with termites.

**Chemical Control (Pre-planting/Soil Treatment):**
For effective control, chemical treatment should ideally be done before planting or at the time of land preparation.

*   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC**: Apply 2.5 litres per acre. Mix the recommended quantity with 200-400 litres of water and drench the soil thoroughly before planting, or mix with the last ploughing/harrowing to ensure uniform incorporation into the soil.
*   **Fipronil 0.3% GR**: Apply 10-15 kg per acre. Broadcast uniformly over the soil surface and incorporate it into the top 10-15 cm of soil before transplanting onion seedlings.

### 2. Control of Nematodes (Root-knot Nematodes - Gaath Kripmi) in Onion

Root-knot nematodes (primarily *Meloidogyne* species) cause galls or swellings on onion roots, leading to stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, reduced bulb size, and overall poor plant vigour.

**Cultural Practices:**
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice rotation with non-host crops like cereals (wheat, maize, sorghum) for at least 2-3 years. Avoid continuous cultivation of susceptible crops.
*   **Solarization of Nursery Beds:** For raising onion seedlings, cover nursery beds with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks during hot summer months to kill nematodes and other soil-borne pathogens.
*   **Use of Healthy Seedlings:** Always use healthy, nematode-free seedlings for transplanting.
*   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure or neem cake (200-400 kg per acre) into the soil, as it can suppress nematode populations.
*   **Summer Ploughing:** Deep ploughing during summer exposes nematode eggs and larvae to heat and desiccation.

**Chemical Control (At Planting/Transplanting):**
Chemical nematicides can be applied at the time of planting or transplanting to protect young plants.

*   **Carbofuran 3% CG**: Apply 10-13 kg per acre. Apply granules in furrows at the time of planting/transplanting and lightly incorporate into the soil, ensuring good contact with the root zone.
*   **Fluensulfone 2% GR**: Apply 8-10 kg per acre. Broadcast uniformly over the soil surface and incorporate into the soil before planting or apply in furrows at transplanting.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Soil Testing:** It is highly recommended to get your soil tested for nematode populations to confirm their presence and severity before applying nematicides.
*   **Safety Precautions:** Always read and follow the instructions on the chemical label carefully. Use appropriate personal protective equipment (gloves, mask, protective clothing) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   **Environmental Impact:** Use chemicals judiciously to minimize environmental impact and ensure food safety.
