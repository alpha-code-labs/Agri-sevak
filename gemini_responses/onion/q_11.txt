As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling these pests in Onion in Haryana:

### Sawflies

This is not known to affect Onion.

### Beetles and Weevils

While not primary pests like thrips or onion maggots, certain beetles (e.g., flea beetles, wireworms - larvae of click beetles) and weevils (e.g., onion weevil) can occasionally cause damage to onion crops, especially during early growth stages or in specific field conditions.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove crop residues and weeds that can harbor pests.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting onions in fields that previously had severe beetle or weevil infestations, or fields recently under grasses (which can harbor wireworms).
    *   **Timely Sowing:** Ensure optimal planting time to promote vigorous growth, making plants more resilient to pest damage.
    *   **Soil Preparation:** Thorough ploughing can expose and kill soil-dwelling pests like wireworms.

2.  **Monitoring:**
    *   Regularly inspect onion seedlings and plants for signs of feeding damage (e.g., shot-holes from flea beetles, wilting due to root damage from wireworms, or larval tunneling).
    *   Monitor soil for wireworm presence before planting, especially in high-risk areas.

**Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved for Onion in India):**

If pest incidence is high and causing economic damage, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always follow label instructions for dosage, application method, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).

For general chewing pests like beetles and weevils, the following insecticides can be considered:

*   **For Foliar Feeding Beetles/Weevils (e.g., Flea Beetles):**
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: Apply at 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water (or 200-250 ml/acre in 200-250 L water).
    *   **Cypermethrin** 25% EC: Apply at 0.5 ml/L of water (or 100-120 ml/acre in 200-250 L water).
    *   **Fipronil** 5% SC: Apply at 1.5-2.0 ml/L of water (or 300-400 ml/acre in 200-250 L water).

*   **For Soil-Dwelling Pests (e.g., Wireworms):**
    *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: As a soil drench at the base of plants, apply 2.0-2.5 L/acre mixed in sufficient water (e.g., 400-500 L) for thorough coverage. This is typically done at planting or early growth stages if wireworm damage is anticipated or observed.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always ensure thorough spray coverage for effective control.
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
*   Adhere strictly to the recommended pre-harvest interval (PHI) to ensure the safety of the produce.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and current pest pressure.
