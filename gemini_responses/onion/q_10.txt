Namaste Kisan bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I will provide scientifically verified advice for managing the mentioned pests in Onion crops in Haryana.

It is crucial to adopt an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods for sustainable and effective control.

Here's how to control the pests you've mentioned:

### 1. Borers (Primarily Onion Maggot - *Delia antiqua*)

Onion maggots are a significant pest, especially during the seedling stage. The maggots bore into the base of the plant and the developing bulb, causing wilting, yellowing, stunted growth, and eventual plant death or bulb rot.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Borers:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Practice crop rotation, avoiding planting onions in the same field year after year.
    *   Remove and destroy infested plants and crop residues immediately.
    *   Ensure proper field sanitation.
    *   Avoid planting onions near fields that had onions or other alliums the previous season.
*   **Chemical Control (as per CIBRC approval):**
    *   **Seed Treatment:**
        *   **Thiamethoxam** 30% FS @ 10 g per kg of seed. This provides early protection against soil-borne pests.
    *   **Soil Application/Drench:**
        *   **Fipronil** 0.3% GR @ 20-30 kg per acre, applied at the time of planting or transplanting, mixed with soil.
        *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC @ 60 ml per acre, as a drench application around the base of the plants, especially effective against early stage borers and cutworms.

### 2. Caterpillars (e.g., Armyworms - *Spodoptera litura*, Cutworms - *Agrotis ipsilon*)

Various caterpillar species can cause significant damage by feeding on onion foliage, leading to defoliation and reduced yield. Cutworms can sever young seedlings at the soil line.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Caterpillars:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Regular field monitoring to detect early infestations.
    *   Hand-picking of larger caterpillars in small areas.
    *   Deep ploughing after harvest to expose pupae.
*   **Biological Control:**
    *   Use of bio-pesticides containing *Bacillus thuringiensis* (Bt) formulations, which are effective against young caterpillars.
*   **Chemical Control (as per CIBRC approval):**
    *   **Foliar Spray:**
        *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG @ 80-100 g per acre.
        *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC @ 60 ml per acre.
        *   **Flubendiamide** 20% WG @ 50 g per acre.
        *   **Indoxacarb** 14.5% SC @ 200 ml per acre.
        *   **Spinetoram** 11.7% SC @ 160-180 ml per acre.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC @ 200-250 ml per acre (for quick knockdown of active caterpillars).
        *   **Novaluron** 10% EC @ 300 ml per acre (an insect growth regulator, effective on younger instars).

### 3. Diamondback Moth (*Plutella xylostella*)

This is not known to affect Onion. Diamondback moth is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower, mustard).

### 4. Leaf Folder

This is not known to affect Onion. Onion leaves are tubular and do not typically support the feeding or folding behavior characteristic of leaf folder pests, which are common in crops with broad leaves like rice or maize.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read the label of the pesticide carefully before use and follow the recommended dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and the latest CIBRC guidelines.
