As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Onion crops in Haryana:

### Grasshopper Control in Onion

Grasshoppers can cause significant damage by feeding on onion foliage, especially in young plants. Integrated pest management strategies are recommended:

*   **Cultural/Mechanical Control:**
    *   Regular monitoring of fields, especially during early crop stages.
    *   Hand-picking and destroying grasshoppers, particularly in small areas.
    *   Deep ploughing after harvest can expose and destroy eggs laid in the soil.
*   **Chemical Control (if infestation is severe):**
    *   **Malathion** 50% EC at 1.0 - 1.5 L per acre in 200-400 L of water.
    *   **Quinalphos** 25% EC at 1.0 - 1.5 L per acre in 200-400 L of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 200 - 250 ml per acre in 200-400 L of water.

### Painted Bug Control in Onion

This is not known to affect Onion. Painted bug (Bagrada hilaris) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., mustard, cabbage, cauliflower).

### Red Cotton Bug Control in Onion

This is not known to affect Onion. Red cotton bug (Dysdercus cingulatus) is a specific pest of cotton and other malvaceous plants.

### Black Ants Control in Onion

Black ants are generally not primary pests of onion. They might be present in the field, sometimes associated with honeydew-producing sucking pests (like aphids or thrips), or they might disturb germinating seeds or roots by tunneling. If they are causing direct damage or protecting other pests, control measures can be considered:

*   **Targeted Chemical Control (if necessary):**
    *   Locate ant nests and drench them with a solution of **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 2.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   Alternatively, for localized infestations, granular formulations like **Fipronil** 0.3% GR can be applied around the nests at 5-10 kg per acre, followed by light irrigation.

Always ensure proper safety precautions, wear protective gear, and follow the instructions on the product label when using any chemical pesticides.
