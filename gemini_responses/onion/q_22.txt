As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following cultivation practices for Onion in Haryana, based on scientific research and local conditions:

### Recommended Cultivation Practices for Onion

**1. Sowing Method/Pattern:**

*   **Nursery Raising and Transplanting:** This is the most recommended and widely adopted method for commercial onion cultivation in Haryana.
    *   Seeds are sown in well-prepared, raised nursery beds (typically 1.0-1.2 m wide and of convenient length).
    *   Seedlings are ready for transplanting into the main field when they are 6-8 weeks old, generally having 3-5 true leaves and a height of 15-20 cm.
    *   Transplanting ensures better stand establishment, uniform bulb size, and higher yields compared to direct seeding.
*   **Direct Seeding:** While possible, it is less common for commercial bulb production due to challenges in weed management, uneven stand, and potentially lower yields. If practiced, seeds are typically drilled in rows.

**2. Planting Depth:**

*   **For Transplanted Seedlings:** Seedlings should be planted shallowly, ensuring that the base of the seedling (where the roots meet the stem) is just covered with soil. Deep planting can lead to elongated bulbs, delayed maturity, and reduced yield.
*   **For Direct Seeding:** Seeds should be sown at a depth of 1.0 - 1.5 cm. Shallow sowing is critical for good germination and emergence.

**3. Spacing:**

*   Optimal spacing is crucial for proper bulb development, uniform size, and maximizing yield.
*   **For Transplanted Seedlings:**
    *   **Row-to-row:** 15 cm to 20 cm.
    *   **Plant-to-plant:** 10 cm.
    *   A common and effective spacing is 15 cm (row-to-row) x 10 cm (plant-to-plant) for medium-sized bulbs, or 20 cm x 10 cm for larger bulbs.
*   **For Direct Seeding:**
    *   **Row-to-row:** 20-30 cm.
    *   **Plant-to-plant:** After emergence, thinning is essential to achieve a final plant-to-plant spacing of 10 cm within the row.

**4. Seed Dose:**

*   **For Nursery Raising (leading to transplanting):**
    *   A seed rate of **8-10 kg/acre** is generally recommended to raise sufficient seedlings for one acre of the main field.
*   **For Direct Seeding:**
    *   A higher seed rate of **12-15 kg/acre** is typically required due to potential germination variability and the need for subsequent thinning.
