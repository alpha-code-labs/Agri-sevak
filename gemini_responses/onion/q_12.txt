As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Scale insects and Mealybugs in Onion in Haryana:

### Scale Insects in Onion

Scale insects are not commonly observed as a significant field pest of onion in Haryana. While they can occasionally infest onions, particularly in storage, they are not a primary concern for field cultivation. There are no specific CIBRC approved chemical recommendations for the control of scale insects on onion.

### Mealybugs in Onion

Mealybugs (e.g., *Phenacoccus solenopsis*) can occasionally infest onion crops in Haryana, especially under warm and humid conditions. They cause damage by sucking sap from leaves and bulbs, leading to stunted growth, yellowing, and reduced yield. They also excrete honeydew, which promotes the growth of sooty mold, interfering with photosynthesis.

**Control Measures for Mealybugs:**

**1. Cultural Control:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infested plant debris and weeds, which can harbor mealybugs.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation to break the pest cycle.
*   **Healthy Planting Material:** Use mealybug-free onion sets or seedlings.
*   **Avoid Excessive Nitrogen:** High nitrogen fertilization can promote succulent growth, making plants more attractive to mealybugs.
*   **Water Management:** Avoid water stress, which can make plants more susceptible.

**2. Biological Control:**
*   Conserve natural enemies such as ladybird beetles (*Cryptolaemus montrouzieri*), lacewings, and parasitic wasps, which can help keep mealybug populations in check.

**3. Chemical Control:**
While there are no specific CIBRC approved chemical recommendations explicitly for "Mealybugs on Onion," systemic insecticides approved for other sucking pests like "Aphids on Onion" are generally effective against mealybugs due to their mode of action and systemic nature. These chemicals are absorbed by the plant and move through its tissues, killing pests that feed on the sap.

When using chemical control, ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and in leaf axils where mealybugs tend to congregate. Always rotate chemicals with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

*   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL**: Apply at a rate of **50-75 ml/acre** in 200-300 litres of water. (Approved for Aphids on Onion)
*   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG**: Apply at a rate of **80 g/acre** in 200-300 litres of water. (Approved for Aphids on Onion)
*   **Acetamiprid 20% SP**: Apply at a rate of **50-80 g/acre** in 200-300 litres of water. (Approved for Aphids on Onion)
*   **Flonicamid 50% WG**: Apply at a rate of **60 g/acre** in 200-300 litres of water. (Approved for Aphids on Onion)

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully.
*   Observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) specified on the label before harvesting.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and application.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension services for the most current and specific recommendations for your region.
