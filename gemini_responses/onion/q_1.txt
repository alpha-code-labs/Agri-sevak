As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding smut diseases in Onion for Haryana.

First, let's clarify which of these smut diseases are known to affect Onion:

*   **False Smut:** This is not known to affect Onion.
*   **Kernel Smut:** This is not known to affect Onion.
*   **Loose Smut:** This is not known to affect Onion.

However, **Black Smut** (caused by *Urocystis cepulae* or *Urocystis magica*), also commonly known as Onion Smut, is a significant disease of onion, particularly in cooler, moist conditions. It can cause significant losses, especially in direct-seeded crops.

Control measures for Black Smut in Onion are primarily preventive and involve a combination of cultural practices and chemical seed treatment:

### Cultural Practices

1.  **Crop Rotation:** Practice a long crop rotation of at least 3-4 years with non-host crops (e.g., cereals, legumes) to reduce the build-up of soil-borne spores.
2.  **Disease-Free Seed/Sets:** Always use certified disease-free seeds or sets from reputable sources.
3.  **Sanitation:** Avoid planting onions in fields known to have a history of smut. Clean equipment thoroughly after working in infested fields.
4.  **Deep Plowing:** Deep plowing can help bury spores, reducing their viability and exposure to the soil surface.
5.  **Optimal Planting Time:** Planting during periods less favorable for disease development (e.g., warmer, drier conditions if possible) can help, though this is often dictated by crop cycle.

### Chemical Control (Seed Treatment)

Seed treatment is the most effective method to control Black Smut, especially when direct seeding. Treat onion seeds before sowing with one of the following CIBRC approved fungicides:

*   **Thiram:** 2-3 g per kg of seed.
*   **Carboxin:** 2 g per kg of seed.
*   **Tebuconazole:** 1-1.5 ml per kg of seed.
*   **Difenoconazole:** 1 ml per kg of seed.
*   **Fludioxonil + Metalaxyl-M:** (Combination product) as per manufacturer's recommendation, typically 1-2 ml per kg of seed.
*   **Mancozeb:** 2.5 g per kg of seed.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Ensure thorough mixing of the fungicide with the seeds for uniform coverage.
*   Follow all safety precautions mentioned on the fungicide label while handling and applying chemicals.
*   Always consult with local agricultural extension services or HAU experts for the most current recommendations specific to your region in Haryana, as recommendations can be updated based on new research and product availability.
