Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU), Hisar, I understand your concerns regarding improving onion yield, fruit quality, and storage life. Here is scientifically verified advice tailored for Haryana conditions:

### I. Improving Onion Yield

To maximize onion yield, focus on robust plant growth and optimal bulb development.

1.  **Variety Selection:**
    *   Choose high-yielding, disease-resistant varieties suitable for Haryana's climate, such as HAU-recommended varieties like Hisar Onion 1, Hisar Onion 2, Pusa Red, Agrifound Light Red, or Bhima Super.

2.  **Soil Management:**
    *   Ensure well-drained sandy loam to clay loam soil with a pH of 6.0-7.5.
    *   Deep ploughing (20-30 cm) followed by 2-3 harrowing sessions to achieve a fine tilth.
    *   Incorporate 20-25 tonnes/acre of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost during land preparation.

3.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Basal Application (at transplanting):**
        *   **Di-ammonium Phosphate** (DAP): 50 kg/acre
        *   **Muriate of Potash** (MOP): 40 kg/acre
        *   **Sulphur** (elemental sulphur): 8-10 kg/acre
        *   **Zinc sulphate:** 10 kg/acre
    *   **Top Dressing (Nitrogen):**
        *   **Urea:** 50 kg/acre at 30 days after transplanting (DAT).
        *   **Urea:** Another 50 kg/acre at 45-60 DAT (before bulb initiation).
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate): 0.2% solution (2 g/L) at bulb initiation stage to improve nutrient uptake and bulb development.

4.  **Water Management:**
    *   Onions require consistent moisture, especially during bulb initiation and development.
    *   Critical stages for irrigation are immediately after transplanting, 30-45 DAT, and during bulb enlargement.
    *   Drip irrigation is highly recommended for efficient water use and uniform moisture.
    *   Stop irrigation 15-20 days before harvest to facilitate proper curing and prevent storage rots.

5.  **Weed Management:**
    *   The critical period for weed competition is 15-45 DAT.
    *   **Pre-emergence:** Apply **Pendimethalin** 1.0 kg a.i./acre (e.g., 3.3 L of 30% EC) within 3 days of transplanting.
    *   **Post-emergence:**
        *   For broadleaf weeds: **Oxyfluorfen** 0.2 kg a.i./acre (e.g., 1.0 L of 23.5% EC) at 15-20 DAT.
        *   For grassy weeds: **Quizalofop-p-ethyl** 0.05 kg a.i./acre (e.g., 0.5 L of 10% EC) at 20-30 DAT.

6.  **Planting Density:**
    *   Maintain optimal spacing of 10-12 cm row-to-row and 7-10 cm plant-to-plant for proper bulb development and air circulation.

### II. Improving Onion Fruit Quality

High-quality onions are firm, uniformly sized, well-shaped, and have good pungency and colour.

1.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Potassium:** Adequate **Muriate of Potash** (MOP) or **Sulphate of Potash** (SOP) (40-50 kg/acre) is crucial for increasing bulb size, firmness, and Total Soluble Solids (TSS), which contributes to flavour and pungency.
    *   **Sulphur:** Essential for the characteristic pungency and flavour of onions. Ensure 8-10 kg elemental sulphur/acre is applied.
    *   **Boron:** Foliar application of **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate) 0.2% (2 g/L) at bulb initiation promotes uniform bulb development and reduces cracking.
    *   **Calcium:** Foliar spray of **Calcium nitrate** 0.5% (5 g/L) during bulb development can improve cell wall strength, leading to firmer bulbs.

2.  **Water Management:**
    *   Consistent moisture during bulb development is key. Avoid extreme fluctuations (wet-dry cycles) which can lead to splitting, irregular shapes, or premature bolting.

3.  **Pest and Disease Management:**
    *   **Thrips:** These pests cause silvery streaks on leaves, reducing photosynthetic efficiency and leading to smaller, poor-quality bulbs. Control with foliar sprays of **Thiamethoxam** 0.25 g/L or **Fipronil** 1.5 ml/L.
    *   **Purple Blotch (*Alternaria porri*):** Causes purplish lesions on leaves, leading to premature defoliation and affecting bulb size and quality. Control with **Mancozeb** 2.5 g/L or **Azoxystrobin** 0.5 ml/L.
    *   **Downy Mildew (*Peronospora destructor*):** Appears as yellowish patches on leaves, leading to premature defoliation. Control with **Metalaxyl + Mancozeb** 2.5 g/L.

4.  **Harvesting at Proper Maturity:**
    *   Harvest when 60-70% of the tops have fallen over and the necks are soft. Immature bulbs are soft, have poor colour, and do not store well. Over-mature bulbs may split or be prone to disease.

### III. Improving Onion Storage Life

Good storage life depends on proper pre-harvest management, harvesting, and post-harvest handling.

1.  **Variety Selection:**
    *   Choose varieties specifically known for good keeping quality, such as Agrifound Light Red, N-2-4-1, or Bhima Super.

2.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Potassium:** Crucial for developing thick, tight outer scales and reducing the incidence of storage rots. Ensure adequate **Muriate of Potash** (MOP) or **Sulphate of Potash** (SOP) application.
    *   **Calcium:** Improves cell wall integrity, making bulbs more resistant to physical damage and pathogen entry during storage. Foliar spray of **Calcium nitrate** 0.5% (5 g/L) during bulb development is beneficial.
    *   **Avoid excessive late-season Nitrogen (Urea) application**, as it promotes vegetative growth, delays maturity, and significantly reduces storage life.

3.  **Harvesting and Curing:**
    *   **Maturity:** Harvest at physiological maturity (60-70% neck fall).
    *   **Field Curing:** After lifting, leave bulbs in the field for 3-7 days with the tops covering the bulbs to protect them from direct sunscald. This allows the neck to dry, outer scales to toughen, and reduces moisture content.
    *   **Artificial Curing:** If weather conditions are unfavourable for field curing, cure bulbs in a well-ventilated shed at 25-30°C with good air circulation for 1-2 weeks.
    *   **Neck Trimming:** After curing, trim the necks to 2-3 cm and roots close to the bulb.

4.  **Post-harvest Handling:**
    *   **Gentle Handling:** Avoid bruising or cutting bulbs during harvesting and handling, as these create entry points for storage pathogens.
    *   **Sorting and Grading:** Before storage, meticulously sort and remove all diseased, damaged, immature, sprouted, or soft bulbs. Only healthy, well-cured bulbs should be stored.

5.  **Storage Conditions:**
    *   **Ventilation:** Store onions in well-ventilated structures (e.g., traditional bamboo/wooden racks, improved ventilated storage structures) to ensure continuous airflow.
    *   **Temperature and Humidity:** Optimal storage conditions are typically 25-30°C and 65-70% relative humidity. High humidity promotes sprouting and rooting, while very low humidity can lead to excessive moisture loss.
    *   **Light:** Store in dark or dim light conditions to prevent greening and sprouting.

6.  **Pest and Disease Management (Pre-storage):**
    *   Effective control of **Thrips** during crop growth reduces damage that can serve as entry points for storage rots.
    *   Managing foliar diseases like **Purple Blotch** and **Downy Mildew** during the growing season reduces the inoculum load that can cause post-harvest rots.
    *   For long-term storage, a post-curing fungicidal dip (e.g., **Carbendazim** 0.1% solution for 5-10 minutes) can be considered to reduce storage rots like *Aspergillus niger* (black mould) and *Botrytis allii* (neck rot), but cultural practices remain paramount.

By diligently following these scientific recommendations, you can significantly improve the yield, quality, and storage life of your onion crop, leading to better returns. For specific local advice, please consult your nearest Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or HAU extension specialist.
