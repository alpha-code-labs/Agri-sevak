Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I am pleased to provide you with the scientifically verified recommendations for ideal onion transplantation in Haryana.

Onion (Allium cepa L.) is a crucial crop, and proper transplantation practices are key to achieving high yields and quality bulbs.

### Ideal Transplantation Time for Onion in Haryana

The ideal transplantation time largely depends on the onion growing season:

*   **Rabi Season (Main Crop):** This is the most common and recommended season for onion cultivation in Haryana.
    *   **Nursery Sowing:** October - November
    *   **Transplantation:** Mid-December to Mid-January (when seedlings are 6-8 weeks old). This timing allows the crop to mature before the onset of extreme summer heat and monsoon rains.
*   **Kharif Season (Monsoon Crop):** Less common due to challenges with heavy rains and diseases, but can be attempted with suitable varieties.
    *   **Nursery Sowing:** May - June
    *   **Transplantation:** July - August
*   **Late Kharif Season:**
    *   **Nursery Sowing:** August - September
    *   **Transplantation:** October - November

### Ideal Transplantation Distance for Onion

Maintaining optimal spacing is crucial for proper bulb development, air circulation, and ease of intercultural operations.

*   **Row to Row Distance:** 15-20 cm
*   **Plant to Plant Distance:** 10-15 cm

This spacing allows for adequate light penetration and nutrient uptake, leading to uniform bulb size and higher yields.

### Ideal Transplantation Process for Onion

A meticulous transplantation process ensures minimal shock to seedlings and robust plant establishment.

1.  **Seedling Preparation:**
    *   **Age and Size:** Use healthy seedlings that are 6-8 weeks old, approximately 15-20 cm tall, and have 3-5 true leaves. Over-aged or under-aged seedlings perform poorly.
    *   **Hardening Off:** Gradually reduce irrigation to the nursery beds for about 7-10 days before transplanting. This process, known as hardening off, makes the seedlings more resilient to transplant shock.
    *   **Uprooting:** Water the nursery bed thoroughly a few hours before uprooting to minimize root damage. Gently pull out seedlings, avoiding injury to the roots and stem.

2.  **Field Preparation:**
    *   **Soil Type:** Onions thrive in well-drained, fertile, sandy loam to clay loam soils with a pH of 6.0-7.0.
    *   **Ploughing:** Plough the field 2-3 times to a depth of 15-20 cm, followed by harrowing to achieve a fine tilth.
    *   **Organic Matter:** Incorporate 20-25 tonnes/acre of well-rotted Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost during the last ploughing.
    *   **Bed/Furrow Preparation:** Prepare raised beds (1.0-1.2 meters wide) or flatbeds depending on your irrigation method (drip or flood irrigation). Raised beds are generally preferred for better drainage and aeration.
    *   **Basal Fertilization:** Apply basal doses of fertilizers as per soil test recommendations. A general recommendation for Haryana is 50 kg/acre Nitrogen, 60 kg/acre Phosphorus, and 40 kg/acre Potassium.

3.  **Actual Transplanting:**
    *   **Timing:** Transplant seedlings preferably in the late afternoon or evening, or on a cloudy day, to reduce wilting and transplant shock.
    *   **Method:** Make small holes at the recommended spacing (15-20 cm row to row, 10-15 cm plant to plant) using a marker or by hand.
    *   **Depth:** Plant seedlings shallowly, ensuring that only the base of the bulb and roots are covered (about 1-2 cm deep). Deep planting can hinder bulb formation and lead to elongated necks.
    *   **Firming:** Gently firm the soil around the base of each seedling to ensure good root-to-soil contact.

4.  **Post-Transplant Care:**
    *   **Immediate Irrigation:** Provide a light irrigation immediately after transplanting to settle the soil around the roots and help the seedlings establish.
    *   **Gap Filling:** Inspect the field after 7-10 days and replace any dead or unhealthy seedlings with healthy ones from the nursery.
    *   **Weeding:** Keep the field free of weeds, especially during the initial stages, as onions are poor competitors with weeds.
    *   **Subsequent Irrigation:** Maintain adequate soil moisture, but avoid waterlogging. Irrigate as needed, typically every 7-10 days depending on soil type and weather conditions.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure a successful onion crop establishment and pave the way for a bountiful harvest.
