Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I understand the critical importance of balanced nutrition for optimal onion yield and quality in Haryana. Addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies effectively requires a scientific approach, always beginning with a soil test to determine precise requirements.

Here's how to address Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium deficiencies in Onion:

### General Recommendation: Soil Testing is Paramount

Before applying any fertilizers, it is crucial to conduct a soil test. This will provide an accurate assessment of the existing nutrient levels in your field and allow for precise, need-based fertilizer application, preventing both deficiencies and excesses. The following recommendations are general guidelines for typical Haryana soils; adjust based on your soil test report.

### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

Nitrogen is vital for vegetative growth and overall plant vigor.

*   **Symptoms:** Yellowing of older leaves (starting from the tips), stunted growth, reduced leaf size, and pale green foliage. In severe cases, the entire plant may appear yellowish and growth is severely hampered, leading to smaller bulbs.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Basal Application:** A portion of Nitrogen is applied at the time of planting/transplanting.
    *   **Top Dressing:** The remaining Nitrogen is applied in split doses during the growth period, as Onion has a continuous demand for N.
    *   **Recommended Fertilizers and Rates (General Guideline for 100-120 kg N/acre):**
        *   Apply 1/3rd of the total Nitrogen requirement as basal, often through **Diammonium Phosphate** (which also provides Phosphorus).
        *   Apply the remaining 2/3rd Nitrogen in 2-3 split doses as top dressing at 30, 45, and 60 days after transplanting (DAT) or sowing.
        *   **Example Application (for 100 kg N/acre target, assuming some N from DAP):**
            *   **Basal:** Approximately 100-130 kg of **Diammonium Phosphate** per acre (provides 18-23 kg N and 46-60 kg P2O5).
            *   **Top Dressing:** Approximately 170-200 kg of **Urea** per acre, split into 2-3 applications. For instance, 60-70 kg **Urea** at 30 DAT, another 60-70 kg **Urea** at 45 DAT, and the final 50-60 kg **Urea** at 60 DAT.
        *   Alternatively, **Calcium Ammonium Nitrate (CAN)** can be used as a top-dressing fertilizer, providing N in both nitrate and ammoniacal forms.

### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

Phosphorus is essential for root development, energy transfer, and early plant establishment.

*   **Symptoms:** Dark green or purplish discoloration of older leaves, stunted growth, poor root development, delayed maturity, and reduced bulb size. Leaves may appear stiff and upright.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Basal Application:** Phosphorus is largely immobile in the soil, so it is best applied as a basal dose and incorporated into the soil before planting or transplanting.
    *   **Recommended Fertilizers and Rates (General Guideline for 40-60 kg P2O5/acre):**
        *   Apply the entire Phosphorus requirement as a basal dose.
        *   **Example Application:**
            *   Approximately 100-130 kg of **Diammonium Phosphate** per acre (provides 46-60 kg P2O5 and 18-23 kg N).
            *   Alternatively, if only Phosphorus is needed, approximately 250-375 kg of **Single Super Phosphate** per acre (provides 40-60 kg P2O5 and also Sulfur).

### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency

Potassium (Potash) is crucial for water regulation, disease resistance, bulb development, and improving storage quality.

*   **Symptoms:** Scorching or browning of leaf margins (edges) on older leaves, starting from the tips and progressing inwards. Leaves may become flaccid, growth is stunted, and bulbs are often small with poor storage quality and a thick neck.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Basal or Split Application:** Potassium can be applied as a basal dose or in two splits (half basal, half at bulb initiation stage).
    *   **Recommended Fertilizers and Rates (General Guideline for 40-60 kg K2O/acre):**
        *   **Example Application:**
            *   Approximately 65-100 kg of **Muriate of Potash** per acre (provides 40-60 kg K2O).
            *   Alternatively, approximately 80-120 kg of **Sulphate of Potash** per acre (provides 40-60 kg K2O and also Sulfur, which is beneficial for Onion).

Always remember to integrate these fertilizer applications with good agricultural practices, including proper irrigation, weed control, and pest management, for a healthy and productive onion crop.
