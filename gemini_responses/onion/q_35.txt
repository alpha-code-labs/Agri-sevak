As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding onion maturity, harvesting, and cutting processes for conditions prevalent in Haryana:

### Maturity Signs for Onion

The correct time for harvesting onions is crucial for good yield, quality, and storage life. Look for the following maturity signs:

*   **Toppling of Tops (Neck Fall):** This is the most reliable indicator. The leaves (tops) start to fall over and bend at the neck, indicating that the bulb has stopped growing and is maturing. Harvesting should ideally begin when 50-75% of the plants show this characteristic neck fall.
*   **Yellowing of Leaves:** The foliage begins to turn yellow, starting from the tips and progressing downwards.
*   **Softening of Neck:** The neck of the onion bulb (where the leaves emerge) becomes soft and pliable.
*   **Bulb Development:** The bulbs reach their characteristic size and shape for the variety.
*   **Outer Scales:** The outer scales of the bulb become papery, dry, and firm.

### Harvesting Time for Onion

*   **Optimal Timing:** Harvest when 50-75% of the tops have fallen over and the leaves have started to yellow. Harvesting too early can result in smaller bulbs, thick necks, and poor storage quality. Harvesting too late can lead to secondary root growth, splitting of outer scales, and increased susceptibility to diseases.
*   **Weather Conditions:** Choose a dry, sunny period for harvesting. Avoid harvesting during or immediately after rain, as wet conditions can promote rot and reduce storage life.
*   **Crop Duration:** Depending on the variety and planting time, onions typically mature in 3-4 months (90-120 days) after transplanting. For the Rabi crop in Haryana, harvesting usually occurs from April to May.

### Cutting Process (Post-Harvest Handling)

The post-harvest handling, including cutting and curing, is critical for extending the storage life of onions.

1.  **Loosening/Undercutting:** If the soil is hard, it is advisable to loosen the soil around the bulbs using a spade or a blade harrow before pulling. This prevents damage to the bulbs during harvesting.
2.  **Pulling:** Gently pull the mature onion bulbs from the soil. Care should be taken to avoid bruising or injuring the bulbs, as this can lead to entry points for pathogens and reduce storage quality.
3.  **Field Curing (Initial Drying):**
    *   After pulling, lay the bulbs in rows in the field for 2-3 days (or up to a week) with the tops covering the bulbs. This protects the bulbs from direct sunscald.
    *   This initial drying allows the neck to dry, the outer scales to firm up, and some nutrients to transfer from the leaves to the bulb.
4.  **Topping (Cutting Leaves and Roots):**
    *   Once the necks are dry and the outer scales are firm, the leaves (tops) and roots should be cut.
    *   **Tops:** Cut the leaves about 2.5-3.0 cm above the bulb neck. Do not cut too close to the bulb, as this can expose the inner scales and lead to rot.
    *   **Roots:** Trim the roots close to the basal plate.
    *   Use sharp, clean tools for cutting to ensure clean cuts and minimize the risk of disease transmission.
5.  **Curing (Final Curing):**
    *   After topping, the bulbs should undergo a final curing process. This is essential for long-term storage.
    *   Spread the topped bulbs in a single layer or in shallow crates in a well-ventilated, shaded area (e.g., under a shed, in a dedicated storage structure).
    *   Cure for 10-15 days at ambient temperatures (typically 25-30°C) and relative humidity (60-70%).
    *   Proper curing dries the outer scales completely, seals the neck, and reduces moisture content, which helps prevent sprouting, rot, and moisture loss during storage.

Following these steps will ensure a good quality harvest with extended storage potential.
