As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I will address your concerns regarding "physical damage" in onion, clarifying the terminology where necessary for scientific accuracy. Onion produces bulbs, not botanical fruits.

Here's how to control the conditions you've described:

### 1. Fruit Bursting (Interpreted as Bulb Splitting/Cracking)

"Fruit bursting" is not a standard term for onion. However, onion bulbs can suffer from **splitting or cracking**, which is a physiological disorder.

**Causes:**
*   **Inconsistent Soil Moisture:** Rapid growth due to heavy irrigation or rainfall after a dry spell is a primary cause.
*   **Nutrient Imbalance:** Deficiency of certain micronutrients like Boron can sometimes contribute.
*   **Genetic Predisposition:** Some varieties are more susceptible.
*   **Timely Harvesting:** Delaying harvest can sometimes lead to splitting.

**Control Measures:**
*   **Consistent Irrigation:** Maintain uniform soil moisture throughout the growing season, especially during bulb development. Avoid sudden heavy irrigation after prolonged dry periods.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure adequate and balanced nutrient supply.
*   **Variety Selection:** Choose onion varieties known to be less prone to splitting.
*   **Timely Harvesting:** Harvest bulbs at physiological maturity to prevent over-ripening and subsequent splitting.

**Chemicals (if Boron deficiency is suspected):**
*   **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (e.g., Solubor):
    *   Foliar spray: 1-2 g/L of water, applied during bulb initiation.
    *   Soil application: 5-10 kg/acre, mixed with fertilizer before planting, if soil test indicates deficiency.

### 2. Leaf Burning/Melting

These are general symptoms that can arise from various abiotic (non-living) stresses.

**Causes & Control for Leaf Burning:**
*   **Sunscald/Heat Stress:**
    *   **Control:** Ensure adequate and consistent irrigation, especially during hot periods. Proper plant spacing can improve air circulation and reduce localized heat. Mulching can help keep soil temperatures stable.
*   **Chemical Burn:**
    *   **Control:** Always use the correct dilution rates for pesticides, herbicides, and foliar fertilizers. Avoid spraying during high temperatures or strong sunlight, as this increases the risk of phytotoxicity. Ensure spray equipment is calibrated correctly.
*   **Nutrient Deficiency (e.g., Potassium):** Potassium deficiency can cause leaf tip burn.
    *   **Control:** Apply potassium fertilizers based on soil test recommendations.
    *   **Potassium chloride** (Muriate of Potash): Soil application at 40-60 kg/acre, as per soil test.
    *   **Potassium sulphate** (Sulphate of Potash): Foliar spray at 5-10 g/L of water, if deficiency symptoms appear.
*   **Water Stress (Drought):**
    *   **Control:** Provide timely and adequate irrigation.

**Causes & Control for Leaf Melting:**
*   **Waterlogging:**
    *   **Control:** Ensure good soil drainage. Avoid over-irrigation, especially in heavy soils. Improve field drainage by creating raised beds or furrows if necessary.
*   **Severe Heat Stress:** Prolonged exposure to very high temperatures can lead to tissue collapse and a "melted" appearance.
    *   **Control:** Similar to sunscald, ensure adequate water supply and consider mulching.

### 3. Hardness in Fruit (Interpreted as Undesirable Bulb Hardness/Woodiness)

"Hardness in fruit" is not a standard term for onion. However, undesirable hardness or woodiness in the bulb, particularly in the neck region, is often associated with **premature bolting** (formation of a flower stalk) or poor bulb development.

**Causes:**
*   **Premature Bolting:**
    *   **Temperature Fluctuations:** Exposure of young plants to prolonged cold temperatures followed by warm temperatures is a primary trigger.
    *   **Variety Susceptibility:** Some varieties are more prone to bolting.
    *   **Stress:** Water or nutrient stress can also induce bolting.
*   **Poor Bulb Development:**
    *   **Water Stress:** Insufficient water during bulb formation.
    *   **Nutrient Deficiencies:** Lack of essential nutrients.
    *   **High Planting Density:** Overcrowding can lead to smaller, harder bulbs.
    *   **High Temperatures:** Very high temperatures during bulbing can hinder proper development.

**Control Measures:**
*   **Variety Selection:** Choose onion varieties that are well-adapted to the local climate and photoperiod (day length) and are less prone to bolting.
*   **Optimal Planting Time:** Plant at the recommended time for your region to avoid exposing young plants to bolting-inducing temperatures.
*   **Consistent Moisture and Nutrition:** Maintain optimal soil moisture and provide balanced nutrition throughout the growth cycle to support healthy bulb development.
*   **Proper Plant Spacing:** Adhere to recommended plant spacing to allow for adequate light, nutrients, and water for each plant.
*   **Timely Harvesting:** Harvest bulbs when they reach physiological maturity and before bolting becomes severe.

**Chemicals:**
*   There are no direct chemical controls to prevent "hardness" in onion bulbs. Management practices focused on variety selection, environmental control, and proper cultural practices are key.
