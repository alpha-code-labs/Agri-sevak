As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding rust diseases in Mustard for Haryana, India:

It is important to clarify that among the rust diseases you listed, only White Rust is a significant and common disease affecting Mustard (rapeseed-mustard crops) in Haryana. Black, Brown, Yellow, and Red rust are primarily diseases of cereal crops (like wheat, barley) and are not known to affect Mustard.

Therefore, the control measures will focus on White Rust.

**White Rust (Albugo candida) Control in Mustard:**

White rust is caused by an oomycete pathogen, *Albugo candida*. It manifests as white, raised pustules primarily on the underside of leaves, stems, and floral parts, leading to hypertrophy and distortion (staghead formation) of inflorescences.

**Integrated Management Strategies:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Resistant Varieties:** Cultivate resistant or tolerant varieties recommended for Haryana. Consult HAU or ICAR-DRMR (Directorate of Rapeseed-Mustard Research) for the latest recommendations.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-cruciferous crops to reduce inoculum build-up in the soil.
    *   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest to reduce primary inoculum for the next season.
    *   **Optimum Sowing Time:** Adhere to the recommended sowing time to avoid conditions highly conducive for disease development.
    *   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure balanced fertilizer application, as excessive nitrogen can sometimes favor disease development.

2.  **Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
    Fungicides should be applied preventively or at the very early stages of disease appearance for effective control. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions.

    *   **Seed Treatment:**
        *   Treat seeds with **Metalaxyl** 35 WS at 6 g/kg of seed. This provides early protection against systemic infection.

    *   **Foliar Spray (if disease appears):**
        *   Spray with **Metalaxyl + Mancozeb** (e.g., 8% + 64% WP formulation) at 2.5 kg/acre in 500-600 liters of water.
        *   Alternatively, spray with **Mancozeb** 75 WP at 800 g/acre in 200-400 liters of water.
        *   Another option is **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC at 200 ml/acre in 200-400 liters of water.
        *   For severe infections, a second spray may be required 10-15 days after the first, using an alternating fungicide if possible to prevent resistance development.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always use CIBRC (Central Insecticides Board & Registration Committee) approved chemicals.
*   Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage during spraying.
*   Monitor fields regularly for early detection of symptoms.
*   Consult local agricultural extension services or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and the latest approved chemicals.

**Regarding other rusts mentioned:**

*   **Black Rust (Stem Rust):** This is not known to affect Mustard. It primarily affects wheat, barley, and rye.
*   **Brown Rust (Leaf Rust):** This is not known to affect Mustard. It primarily affects wheat.
*   **Yellow Rust (Stripe Rust):** This is not known to affect Mustard. It primarily affects wheat and barley.
*   **Red Rust:** This is not known to affect Mustard. The term "red rust" is sometimes used for other rusts or algal diseases on different crops, but not as a specific rust disease of mustard.
