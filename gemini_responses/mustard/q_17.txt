As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend the following doses for organic manures and plant growth stimulants in Mustard cultivation in Haryana:

**1. Farmyard Manure (FYM):**
*   Apply well-decomposed FYM at the rate of **5-10 tonnes per acre** (12.5-25 tonnes per hectare) during land preparation, at least 2-3 weeks before sowing. Incorporate it thoroughly into the soil.

**2. Vermicompost:**
*   Apply vermicompost at the rate of **1-2 tonnes per acre** (2.5-5 tonnes per hectare) during land preparation, similar to FYM, and mix it well with the soil.

**3. Sagarika (Seaweed Extract based Plant Growth Stimulant):**
*   Sagarika is a seaweed extract-based product and functions as a plant growth stimulant, not a bulk organic manure. It is typically applied as a foliar spray or soil drench.
    *   **Foliar Spray:**
        *   First spray: 30-40 days after sowing (at rosette stage).
        *   Second spray: At flowering initiation.
        *   Dose: **2.5-5 ml per litre of water** (or 500-1000 ml per acre, depending on spray volume). Ensure complete coverage of the foliage.
    *   **Soil Application (Drench/Drip):**
        *   Dose: **1-2 litres per acre** mixed with irrigation water or applied as a drench around the root zone. This can be done at critical growth stages.
