As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I advise on addressing micronutrient deficiencies in Mustard (Brassica juncea) based on scientific evidence and CIBRC-approved practices for Haryana.

**Crucial First Step: Diagnosis**
Before applying any micronutrient, it is paramount to conduct a soil test and, if possible, a plant tissue analysis. Visual symptoms can be misleading and may overlap with other nutrient deficiencies or stresses. HAU recommends regular soil testing to determine the exact nutrient status of your fields.

Here's how to address specific micronutrient deficiencies in Mustard:

### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

Zinc is vital for enzyme activity, protein synthesis, and growth regulation. Deficiency leads to stunted growth, small leaves (little leaf), and interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves.

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (21% Zn) at 10-12.5 kg/acre, or **Zinc sulphate monohydrate** (33% Zn) at 6-8 kg/acre, mixed with basal fertilizers at the time of sowing.
*   **Foliar Application (for quick correction):**
    *   Spray **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** at 5 g/L of water (0.5% solution) or **Chelated Zinc (EDTA)** at 1 g/L of water (0.1% solution) at 45-60 days after sowing (DAS). Repeat if symptoms persist after 15-20 days.

### 2. Iron (Fe) / Ferrous Deficiency

Iron is essential for chlorophyll formation and photosynthesis. Deficiency causes distinct interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, while veins remain green.

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Ferrous sulphate** (19% Fe) at 10-12.5 kg/acre, mixed with basal fertilizers. This is less common for soil application unless severe deficiency is confirmed.
*   **Foliar Application (most effective for quick relief):**
    *   Spray **Ferrous sulphate** at 5 g/L of water (0.5% solution) or **Chelated Iron (Fe-EDTA)** at 1 g/L of water (0.1% solution) at 45-60 DAS. Repeat at 10-15 day intervals if symptoms persist.

### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

Boron is crucial for cell wall formation, sugar transport, pollen germination, and seed development. Deficiency can lead to stunted growth, cracking of stems, hollow stems, poor flowering, and reduced pod and seed set.

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Borax (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate)** (10.5-11.3% B) at 2-4 kg/acre, or **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (20% B) at 1-2 kg/acre, mixed with basal fertilizers at sowing.
*   **Foliar Application:**
    *   Spray **Borax (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate)** at 2 g/L of water (0.2% solution) or **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** at 1 g/L of water (0.1% solution) at the pre-flowering or early flowering stage.

### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

Calcium is vital for cell wall structure, membrane integrity, and root growth. Deficiency typically affects young, developing tissues, leading to necrosis of young leaves and growing points, and stunted root growth.

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Gypsum (Calcium sulphate)** at 200-400 kg/acre (also provides sulfur and improves soil structure) or **Calcium nitrate** at 10-15 kg/acre at sowing.
*   **Foliar Application:**
    *   Spray **Calcium chloride** at 5 g/L of water (0.5% solution) or **Calcium nitrate** at 5 g/L of water (0.5% solution) at the flowering and early pod development stages.

### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

Magnesium is the central atom in the chlorophyll molecule and is essential for photosynthesis. Deficiency causes interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, with veins remaining green, and sometimes purplish discoloration in severe cases.

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Magnesium sulphate** at 10-15 kg/acre at the time of sowing.
*   **Foliar Application:**
    *   Spray **Magnesium sulphate** at 5 g/L of water (0.5% solution) at 45-60 DAS. Repeat if necessary.

### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

Manganese is involved in photosynthesis, respiration, and nitrogen metabolism. Deficiency results in interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, often with small necrotic spots, and stunted growth.

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Manganese sulphate** at 10-12.5 kg/acre at the time of sowing. (Less common for soil application unless severe deficiency is confirmed).
*   **Foliar Application:**
    *   Spray **Manganese sulphate** at 5 g/L of water (0.5% solution) at 45-60 DAS. Repeat at 10-15 day intervals if symptoms persist.

### General Recommendations and Precautions:

*   **Water Volume:** For foliar sprays, ensure adequate water volume (typically 200 litres per acre for field crops) to ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.
*   **Timing of Spray:** Foliar applications are best done in the early morning or late afternoon to avoid high temperatures, which can lead to leaf scorching and reduced absorption.
*   **Compatibility:** Always check the compatibility of different chemicals before mixing them for foliar application. A small jar test is recommended.
*   **Soil pH:** Micronutrient availability is highly influenced by soil pH. Maintaining an optimal soil pH (6.0-7.5 for most crops) is crucial for nutrient uptake.
*   **Organic Matter:** Incorporating organic matter into the soil improves soil health and enhances the availability of micronutrients.

Always consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions.
