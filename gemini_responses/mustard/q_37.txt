Protecting mustard crops from wild animals is a significant challenge for farmers in Haryana. While there are no specific CIBRC-approved chemical repellents widely recommended for deterring large wild animals from mustard, a combination of physical, mechanical, and community-based methods can be effective.

Here are the recommended methods:

*   **Physical Barriers:**
    *   **Barbed Wire Fencing:** Erecting a multi-strand (5-7 strands) barbed wire fence around the field can deter stray cattle, goats, and some larger wild animals.
    *   **Electric Fencing:** A highly effective method against a wide range of animals including Nilgai (blue bull), wild boar, and stray cattle. It requires proper installation, earthing, and regular maintenance. Solar-powered electric fences are a sustainable option. Ensure all safety standards are met during installation and operation.
    *   **Thorn Fencing:** Using thorny branches (e.g., *Prosopis juliflora* or local thorny bushes) as a dense fence can provide a low-cost deterrent, especially against smaller animals.
    *   **Trenches:** Digging deep and wide trenches (e.g., 1-1.5 meters deep and 1 meter wide) around the field can effectively deter ground-dwelling animals like wild boar from entering.

*   **Scaring Devices and Human Presence:**
    *   **Human Watch:** Deploying watchmen, especially during critical crop stages (sowing, flowering, pod formation), is one of the most effective methods, though labour-intensive.
    *   **Scarecrows:** Traditional scarecrows can provide a temporary deterrent. Their effectiveness can be improved by regularly changing their location or appearance to prevent animals from habituating.
    *   **Noise Makers:** Using devices that produce loud noises (e.g., drums, firecrackers with caution and local permission, or gas guns if available and permitted) can temporarily scare animals away.
    *   **Reflective Tapes/CDs:** Hanging shiny, reflective tapes or old CDs can deter some animals, particularly birds, by creating visual disturbances.
    *   **Light and Sound Systems:** Automated systems that emit bright lights and loud sounds at irregular intervals during the night can be effective against nocturnal animals.

*   **Habitat Management:**
    *   **Clearing Field Edges:** Removing bushes, tall weeds, and other dense vegetation around the field reduces hiding places and cover for wild animals, making the area less attractive to them.

*   **Community-Based Approaches:**
    *   **Coordinated Guarding:** Farmers in a village or a cluster of adjacent fields can collectively organize guarding shifts, sharing the responsibility and cost, which is more sustainable than individual efforts.
    *   **Village-level Committees:** Forming local committees to address the wild animal menace can facilitate coordinated efforts, resource sharing, and liaison with local authorities for broader solutions.

*   **Chemical Repellents:**
    *   CIBRC-approved chemical repellents specifically for deterring large wild animals from mustard crops are generally not available or recommended due to limited efficacy, high cost, and potential environmental concerns. Therefore, non-chemical methods are the primary focus.
