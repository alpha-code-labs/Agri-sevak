As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned conditions in Mustard in Haryana:

### 1. Pod Shattering (Referred to as "Fruit Bursting")

Pod shattering is a significant concern in mustard, leading to substantial yield losses, especially during harvesting.

**Causes:**
*   Genetic predisposition of the variety.
*   Delayed harvesting, allowing pods to become overly dry and brittle.
*   Fluctuations in weather conditions, such as dry spells followed by rain or high winds at maturity.
*   Low humidity during the ripening phase.

**Control Measures:**
*   **Timely Harvesting:** Harvest the crop when 70-80% of the pods on the main stem turn yellow and the seeds are firm. Harvesting in the early morning when there is dew can help reduce shattering.
*   **Variety Selection:** Choose shatter-resistant or tolerant varieties recommended by HAU for cultivation in Haryana.
*   **Proper Threshing:** Ensure careful handling during drying and threshing to minimize mechanical damage and shattering.
*   **Irrigation Management:** Avoid severe water stress followed by sudden irrigation during the pod development stage, which can lead to uneven maturity and increased shattering.

### 2. Leaf Burning/Melting

Leaf burning or scorching in mustard is typically a symptom of environmental stress or nutrient imbalance.

**Causes:**
*   **High Temperature Stress (Sun Scorch):** Especially during the reproductive and maturity stages if temperatures rise sharply.
*   **Drought Stress:** Insufficient soil moisture.
*   **Salinity Stress:** High salt concentration in soil or irrigation water.
*   **Nutrient Imbalances:** Severe deficiencies (e.g., Potassium) or toxicities (e.g., Boron toxicity from excessive application).
*   **Herbicide Phytotoxicity:** Incorrect application rate, timing, or drift of herbicides.

**Control Measures:**
*   **Adequate Irrigation:** Provide timely and adequate irrigation, especially during critical growth stages (flowering and pod formation), to prevent drought stress.
*   **Balanced Nutrient Management:** Conduct soil testing and apply fertilizers based on recommendations. Ensure balanced nutrition, particularly adequate potassium. Avoid excessive application of micronutrients like boron unless a deficiency is confirmed.
*   **Timely Sowing:** Sow the crop at the optimal time to avoid the reproductive and maturity stages coinciding with peak summer heat.
*   **Variety Selection:** Opt for heat and drought-tolerant varieties recommended by HAU.
*   **Proper Herbicide Application:** Adhere strictly to recommended dosages, timings, and application methods for all agrochemicals to prevent phytotoxicity.
*   **Foliar Sprays (Supportive):**
    *   Foliar application of **Potassium Nitrate** (1-2% solution) can help improve the plant's tolerance to drought and heat stress.
    *   Foliar application of **Potassium Silicate** (0.5-1% solution) can strengthen cell walls and enhance resistance to various stresses.
    *   Foliar application of **Amino Acid** based formulations or **Seaweed Extract** based biostimulants can help plants recover from and cope with environmental stresses.

### 3. Hardness in Fruit

This is not known to affect Mustard as a specific physical damage or physiological disorder. Mustard pods (siliquae) are naturally firm when immature and become dry and brittle upon maturity. If this refers to difficulty in threshing, it is usually related to the moisture content of the pods at harvest or the efficiency of the threshing equipment.
