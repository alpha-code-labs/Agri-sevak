As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I advise on protecting your Mustard crop from environmental stresses based on scientific principles and practices suitable for Haryana.

Mustard is a Rabi crop, and while generally hardy, it can suffer significant yield losses due to extreme weather events. Proactive management is key.

### Protecting Mustard from Extreme Cold and Frost

Extreme cold and frost primarily affect mustard during its flowering and pod development stages (typically December to February).

*   **Irrigation:** A light irrigation (2.5-5 cm) in the evening before an expected frost can significantly raise the soil temperature and release latent heat, protecting the crop. Ensure the soil is not waterlogged.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure adequate potassium (K) application as part of your fertilizer schedule. Potassium improves cell wall strength and overall plant vigour, enhancing cold tolerance.
*   **Foliar Sprays:**
    *   **Thiourea:** Spray 500 g of **Thiourea** dissolved in 200-250 litres of water per acre at the pre-flowering stage. If cold conditions persist, a second spray can be given after 15 days. This helps in improving cold tolerance, reducing flower drop, and promoting pod setting.
    *   **Potassium Nitrate:** Spray a 0.5-1.0% solution (5-10 g/L) of **Potassium Nitrate** at the pre-flowering stage. This helps in osmotic adjustment and enhances the plant's ability to withstand cold stress.
    *   **Sulphur:** Foliar application of water-soluble **Sulphur** (e.g., 80% WP) at 2.5 kg/acre (mixed in 200-250 L water) can improve overall plant vigour and stress tolerance.

### Protecting Mustard from Heat/Loo and Intense Sunlight

Heat stress, hot winds (Loo), and intense sunlight are particularly damaging during the flowering, pod formation, and seed filling stages, especially if the season extends into late February or March.

*   **Timely Irrigation:** Provide light and frequent irrigations during critical stages (flowering, pod formation) to maintain soil moisture and cool the canopy, especially if hot winds (Loo) or high temperatures are expected. This helps maintain turgor and reduces heat load on the plant.
*   **Mulching:** Use crop residues (e.g., wheat straw) or other organic materials as mulch between rows. This helps conserve soil moisture, moderate soil temperature, and reduce evaporation.
*   **Foliar Sprays:**
    *   **Potassium Nitrate:** Spray a 0.5-1.0% solution (5-10 g/L) of **Potassium Nitrate** at the flowering and early pod development stages. This helps in osmotic adjustment, reduces the adverse effects of heat stress, and improves pod filling.
    *   **Thiourea:** Spray 500 g of **Thiourea** dissolved in 200-250 litres of water per acre at the flowering stage. This can help mitigate the adverse effects of heat stress on pollen viability and pod setting, leading to better yield.
    *   **Kaolin Clay:** Spray a 5-6% solution (50-60 g/L) of **Kaolin Clay** (as a wettable powder) to form a reflective film on the leaves. This physically reflects sunlight, reduces leaf temperature, and protects the crop from intense sunlight and heat stress. Apply during the hottest part of the day or when intense sunlight is expected.

### General Management Practices

*   **Sowing Time:** Adhere strictly to the recommended sowing window for mustard in Haryana. Timely sowing ensures the crop completes its critical growth stages before the onset of severe cold or premature heat.
*   **Variety Selection:** Choose mustard varieties known for their tolerance to temperature fluctuations and suitability for your specific agro-climatic zone in Haryana.

By implementing these scientifically verified practices, you can significantly reduce the impact of environmental stresses on your mustard crop and ensure a healthy yield.
