As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I must provide scientifically verified advice.

1.  **Dieback:** This is not known to affect Mustard. Dieback is typically a term used for woody plants, trees, and shrubs, referring to the progressive death of twigs, branches, and roots, often caused by fungi or environmental stress. Mustard is an herbaceous annual crop and does not typically suffer from a disease specifically termed "Dieback."

2.  **Twig blight:** This is not known to affect Mustard. Similar to Dieback, "Twig blight" is a term primarily associated with woody plants, trees, and shrubs, affecting their twigs. Mustard plants do not have "twigs" in this context.

3.  **Tikka disease:** This is not known to affect Mustard. Tikka disease is a well-known and significant disease of Groundnut (Peanut), caused by *Cercospora arachidicola* and *Phaeoisariopsis personata*. It does not affect Mustard crops.
