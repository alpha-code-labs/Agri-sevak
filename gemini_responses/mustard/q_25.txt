As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for irrigation management in Mustard (Raya/Sarson) in Haryana:

Mustard is a relatively drought-tolerant crop, but timely and adequate irrigation at critical growth stages is crucial for maximizing yield and oil content. The total water requirement for mustard typically ranges from 250-350 mm, depending on soil type, climate, and rainfall.

### Irrigation Management in Mustard

**1. First Irrigation:**

*   **Timing:** The first irrigation is most critical and should be applied at the **rosette/branching stage**, which usually occurs around **30-40 days after sowing (DAS)**.
    *   *Rationale:* This stage is vital for vegetative growth, development of a strong root system, and initiation of branches that will bear flowers and pods. Water stress at this stage can severely impact branching and overall plant vigor.
*   **Factors Influencing Timing:**
    *   **Soil Type:** In light-textured sandy soils, irrigation might be needed slightly earlier (around 30 DAS) due to lower water holding capacity. In heavier soils, it might be delayed slightly.
    *   **Sowing Time:** Early sown crops might require irrigation sooner than late-sown crops if winter rains are delayed.
    *   **Winter Rains:** If significant winter rainfall occurs around 30-40 DAS, the first irrigation can be delayed or even skipped.
*   **Method and Quantity:**
    *   Apply a light irrigation of **5-7 cm depth**. Over-irrigation at this stage can lead to waterlogging, nutrient leaching, and increased susceptibility to diseases.
    *   Ensure uniform application, especially if using surface irrigation methods like border strips or furrows.

**2. Second Irrigation:**

*   **Timing:** The second irrigation, if required, is crucial at the **pod formation and seed filling stage**, typically around **60-75 DAS**.
    *   *Rationale:* This stage is critical for the development of pods and the accumulation of oil and dry matter in the seeds. Water stress during this period directly reduces seed size, number of seeds per pod, and oil content, leading to significant yield losses.
*   **Factors Influencing Timing:**
    *   **Soil Moisture Status:** Assess the soil moisture by visual inspection or using a tensiometer. If the soil feels dry at 15-30 cm depth, irrigation is needed.
    *   **Previous Rainfall:** If good rainfall occurred after the first irrigation and before the pod formation stage, the second irrigation might be delayed or its intensity reduced.
    *   **Crop Condition:** Observe the crop for signs of wilting, especially during the afternoon.
*   **Method and Quantity:**
    *   Apply a light to moderate irrigation of **5-7 cm depth**.
    *   Avoid heavy irrigation during flowering, as it can lead to flower drop and poor pollination. However, ensuring adequate moisture *before* flowering and during pod formation is key.

**3. Sprinkler Use in Mustard:**

Sprinkler irrigation is highly recommended for mustard cultivation in Haryana, especially in areas with limited water availability, light-textured soils, or undulating topography.

*   **Advantages:**
    *   **Water Saving:** Sprinklers can save **25-40% water** compared to traditional surface irrigation methods, as they minimize conveyance losses and apply water more uniformly.
    *   **Uniform Application:** Ensures even distribution of water across the field, leading to uniform crop growth and yield.
    *   **Suitable for Light Soils:** Ideal for sandy soils where surface irrigation can lead to high percolation losses.
    *   **Reduced Soil Erosion:** Minimizes soil erosion, especially on slopy lands.
    *   **Nutrient Use Efficiency:** Can be used for fertigation (applying fertilizers through irrigation water), improving nutrient use efficiency.
    *   **Temperature Regulation:** Light sprinkler irrigation during hot, dry spells can help in lowering canopy temperature, which is beneficial during flowering.
*   **Recommendations for Sprinkler Irrigation:**
    *   **Pressure:** Maintain optimal operating pressure as recommended by the sprinkler system manufacturer (typically 1.5-2.5 kg/cm² for portable systems).
    *   **Nozzle Size:** Use appropriate nozzle sizes to ensure fine droplets and uniform coverage.
    *   **Irrigation Depth:** Apply water in light, frequent spells. For a 5-7 cm irrigation, this might involve running the system for a few hours per set, depending on the discharge rate of the sprinklers.
    *   **Timing:** Follow the critical stages mentioned above (30-40 DAS and 60-75 DAS).
    *   **Avoid during Strong Winds:** Do not operate sprinklers during strong winds, as it can severely affect water distribution uniformity.

In summary, judicious irrigation at the branching and pod formation stages, coupled with efficient methods like sprinklers, can significantly enhance mustard productivity and water use efficiency in Haryana. Always monitor soil moisture and consider rainfall patterns before applying irrigation.
