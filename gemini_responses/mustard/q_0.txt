As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Mustard in Haryana:

**General Management Principles for Fungal Diseases in Mustard:**

Effective management of fungal diseases involves an integrated approach combining cultural practices and timely chemical interventions.

*   **Resistant Varieties:** Whenever possible, choose mustard varieties known to be resistant or tolerant to common fungal diseases prevalent in your area.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice a 2-3 year crop rotation with non-cruciferous crops to reduce the build-up of disease inoculum in the soil.
*   **Timely Sowing:** Adhere to recommended sowing dates for your region, as early or late sowing can sometimes increase disease susceptibility.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush growth and increased susceptibility to certain fungal diseases. Ensure balanced application of NPK and micronutrients.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected crop debris after harvest to reduce primary inoculum for the next season.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Maintain optimal plant spacing to ensure good air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce humidity and fungal growth.

**Specific Control Measures for Fungal Diseases in Mustard:**

### 1. Alternaria Blight (Alternaria brassicae, Alternaria brassicicola)

This is a major fungal disease of mustard in Haryana.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Apply at the appearance of initial symptoms (usually at flowering/pod formation stage) and repeat after 10-15 days if necessary.
    *   **Mancozeb 75% WP:** 2.0-2.5 kg/acre (mixed in 500-600 L of water) or 3.0-4.0 g/L of water.
    *   **Propiconazole 25% EC:** 200-250 ml/acre (mixed in 200-250 L of water) or 1.0 ml/L of water.
    *   **Tebuconazole 25.9% EC:** 250-300 ml/acre (mixed in 250-300 L of water) or 1.0 ml/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:** 200 ml/acre (mixed in 200 L of water) or 1.0 ml/L of water.

### 2. Downy Mildew (Peronospora parasitica)

This is a common and significant disease, especially in cool, moist conditions.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Apply preventively or at the first sign of disease, especially if weather conditions are favorable.
    *   **Metalaxyl-M 4% + Mancozeb 64% WP:** 500 g/acre (mixed in 250 L of water) or 2.0 g/L of water.
    *   **Mancozeb 75% WP:** 2.0-2.5 kg/acre (mixed in 500-600 L of water) or 3.0-4.0 g/L of water.

### 3. Powdery Mildew (Erysiphe cruciferarum)

This disease is more prevalent in dry, warm weather conditions.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Apply at the first appearance of white powdery patches on leaves and stems.
    *   **Sulphur 80% WP:** 1.5-2.0 kg/acre (mixed in 500-600 L of water) or 3.0-4.0 g/L of water.
    *   **Difenoconazole 25% EC:** 100-150 ml/acre (mixed in 200 L of water) or 0.5-0.75 ml/L of water.
    *   **Tebuconazole 25.9% EC:** 250-300 ml/acre (mixed in 250-300 L of water) or 1.0 ml/L of water.

### 4. Blight (White Rust and Sclerotinia Stem Rot)

The term "Blight" can refer to various symptoms. For mustard, two important diseases causing blight-like symptoms are White Rust and Sclerotinia Stem Rot.

*   **White Rust (Albugo candida):**
    *   This disease causes white pustules on leaves and can lead to hypertrophy (swelling) of floral parts, forming "stag-head" symptoms.
    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   **Metalaxyl-M 4% + Mancozeb 64% WP:** 500 g/acre (mixed in 250 L of water) or 2.0 g/L of water.
        *   **Mancozeb 75% WP:** 2.0-2.5 kg/acre (mixed in 500-600 L of water) or 3.0-4.0 g/L of water.

*   **Sclerotinia Stem Rot (Sclerotinia sclerotiorum):**
    *   This disease causes water-soaked lesions on stems, leading to wilting and premature ripening. Black sclerotia (resting bodies) are often visible inside the stem.
    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   Apply fungicides preventively or at early flowering stage, especially if the disease has been a problem in previous years or if conditions are cool and moist.
        *   **Carbendazim 50% WP:** 250-500 g/acre (mixed in 250-500 L of water) or 0.5-1.0 g/L of water.
        *   **Tebuconazole 25.9% EC:** 250-300 ml/acre (mixed in 250-300 L of water) or 1.0 ml/L of water.

**Diseases Not Known to Affect Mustard:**

*   **Anthracnose:** This is not known to affect Mustard significantly as a primary disease in Haryana.
*   **Blast:** This is not known to affect Mustard.
*   **Brown spot:** This is not known to affect Mustard.
*   **Grey mildew:** This is not known to affect Mustard by this name. If you are referring to Grey mold (Botrytis cinerea), it can occasionally affect mustard, but is not a primary disease in Haryana.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label for specific dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of fungicide resistance.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension specialists for the most current recommendations and to confirm disease diagnosis.
