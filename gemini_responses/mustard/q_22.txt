As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), here are the recommended cultivation practices for Mustard in Haryana:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   **Row Sowing:** This is the most recommended method as it facilitates inter-cultivation operations like weeding, thinning, and spraying.
    *   The rows should be oriented in an East-West direction for better light interception, especially during winter.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   **2-3 cm:** Mustard seeds are small and require shallow planting for optimal germination and emergence. Deeper planting can lead to poor stand establishment.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   **Row-to-Row Spacing:** 30-45 cm. For timely sown mustard, 30 cm is generally recommended. For late-sown conditions or specific varieties, 45 cm might be advised.
    *   **Plant-to-Plant Spacing:** After thinning (typically 2-3 weeks after sowing), maintain a plant-to-plant distance of 10-15 cm. This ensures adequate space for individual plant development and reduces competition.

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   **2.5 kg/acre:** For timely sown Indian Mustard (Raya) varieties.
    *   **3 kg/acre:** For Gobhi Sarson varieties or under conditions where germination might be slightly compromised, or for late-sown conditions to ensure a good plant stand.
