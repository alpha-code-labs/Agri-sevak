As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding "Dropping (Flower drop, Fruit drop, and Tinda/Boll dropping)" in Mustard for Haryana.

Firstly, it is important to clarify that "Tinda" and "Boll" are not parts of the Mustard plant. Tinda refers to Indian round gourd (Praecitrullus fistulosus), and Boll refers to the fruit of cotton (Gossypium spp.). Therefore, "Tinda/Boll dropping" is not applicable to Mustard.

However, flower drop and silique (often referred to as 'fruit' or 'pod') drop can occur in Mustard (Brassica juncea/rapa). This is primarily a physiological issue, often triggered by various environmental stresses and nutrient deficiencies rather than a specific disease or pest.

**Common Causes of Flower and Silique Drop in Mustard:**
*   **Environmental Stress:** High temperatures (especially during flowering and silique development), water stress (drought or waterlogging), or frost.
*   **Nutrient Deficiencies:** Particularly Boron deficiency, which is common in many soils.
*   **Poor Pollination:** Inadequate pollination can lead to unfertilized flowers dropping.
*   **Pest/Disease Infestation:** Severe infestations can indirectly weaken the plant, leading to increased dropping.

**Control Measures for Flower and Silique Drop in Mustard:**

To mitigate flower and silique drop, a combination of good agricultural practices and targeted nutrient/hormone application is recommended:

*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Boron:** If Boron deficiency is suspected or confirmed through soil testing, foliar application of Boron can be highly effective.
        *   Spray **Disodium tetraborate decahydrate (Borax)** at 0.2% concentration (2 g/L of water) or **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate (Solubor)** at 0.15% concentration (1.5 g/L of water).
        *   Apply at the pre-flowering stage and repeat at the early silique development stage. Use 200-250 L of water per acre for thorough coverage.

*   **Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs):**
    *   **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA):** Application of NAA can help in reducing flower and silique drop by preventing abscission.
        *   Spray **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA)** at a concentration of 10-20 ppm (parts per million). For example, if using a 4.5% SL formulation, this typically translates to 45-90 ml per acre, mixed in 200-250 L of water.
        *   Apply at the peak flowering stage.

*   **Agronomic Practices:**
    *   **Optimal Sowing Time:** Sow mustard at the recommended time for your region to avoid extreme temperatures during critical flowering and silique development stages.
    *   **Irrigation Management:** Ensure adequate and timely irrigation, especially during flowering and silique formation. Avoid both drought stress and waterlogging.
    *   **Balanced Fertilization:** Provide balanced nutrition as per soil test recommendations, including macro and micronutrients.
    *   **Pest and Disease Control:** Effectively manage pests (e.g., aphids) and diseases to reduce overall plant stress, which can indirectly contribute to dropping.

This comprehensive approach will help in minimizing flower and silique drop and maximizing yield in mustard.
