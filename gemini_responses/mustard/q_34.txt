As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I advise that reducing the harmful effects of weedicides/herbicides in mustard cultivation primarily involves precise application and adherence to recommended practices. Herbicide injury to mustard can significantly impact yield. Here are the key measures to minimize such adverse effects:

*   **1. Correct Herbicide Selection:**
    *   Always use herbicides specifically recommended and registered for mustard (Brassica juncea/rapa) in Haryana. Using off-label herbicides or those meant for other crops can cause severe phytotoxicity.
    *   For example, for pre-emergence weed control, **Pendimethalin** is commonly used. For post-emergence control of grassy weeds, **Quizalofop-ethyl** is an option.

*   **2. Accurate Dosage:**
    *   Strictly follow the recommended dosage rates provided on the herbicide label. Overdosing is a primary cause of crop injury.
    *   For instance, **Pendimethalin** is typically applied at 1.0 kg/acre (active ingredient) or 3.3 L/acre of 30% EC formulation.
    *   **Quizalofop-ethyl** is typically applied at 50 g/acre (active ingredient) or 400 ml/acre of 5% EC formulation.

*   **3. Timely Application:**
    *   Apply herbicides at the correct crop growth stage as specified on the label.
    *   **Pendimethalin** should be applied within 0-3 days after sowing (pre-emergence).
    *   **Quizalofop-ethyl** should be applied post-emergence when grassy weeds are at the 2-4 leaf stage and mustard crop is at the 2-6 leaf stage. Applying too early or too late can reduce efficacy and increase crop injury risk.

*   **4. Proper Application Technique:**
    *   **Uniform Coverage:** Ensure even spray distribution across the field. Use appropriate nozzles (e.g., flat fan nozzles) that produce uniform droplet size.
    *   **Water Volume:** Use the recommended volume of water (typically 200-300 L/acre) to ensure proper coverage and dilution.
    *   **Weather Conditions:** Avoid spraying during high winds (to prevent drift onto non-target plants or uneven application), extreme temperatures (above 30°C or below 10°C), or when rain is expected within 6-8 hours. High temperatures can increase herbicide absorption and phytotoxicity.

*   **5. Sprayer Calibration and Cleaning:**
    *   **Calibration:** Regularly calibrate your sprayer to ensure it delivers the correct volume of spray solution per unit area. This is crucial for accurate dosage.
    *   **Cleaning:** Thoroughly clean the sprayer tank, nozzles, and hoses after each use, especially when switching between different types of herbicides. Residues from previous applications (e.g., 2,4-D used in wheat) can severely damage mustard. Use a dedicated sprayer for herbicides if possible, or follow a rigorous cleaning protocol.

*   **6. Crop Health and Environmental Conditions:**
    *   Apply herbicides to healthy, vigorously growing mustard crops. Crops under stress (due to drought, waterlogging, nutrient deficiency, or pest/disease attack) are more susceptible to herbicide injury.
    *   Ensure adequate soil moisture at the time of application, especially for soil-applied herbicides like **Pendimethalin**, for optimal efficacy and reduced crop stress.

*   **7. Water Quality:**
    *   Use clean water for mixing herbicides. Turbid or hard water can sometimes reduce herbicide efficacy or alter its properties, potentially leading to poor weed control or increased crop injury.
