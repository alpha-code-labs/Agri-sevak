Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice on addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium) in Mustard (Raya/Sarson) cultivation in Haryana.

It is crucial to conduct a soil test before applying any fertilizers to determine the exact nutrient status of your field. However, based on general recommendations for Mustard in Haryana, here's how to address these deficiencies:

### Addressing Macro-nutrient Deficiencies in Mustard

**1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency:**
Nitrogen is vital for vegetative growth, leaf development, and overall plant vigor.
*   **Symptoms:** General yellowing of older leaves (chlorosis), stunted growth, thin stems, and reduced branching.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   Apply Nitrogen in split doses. A common recommendation for irrigated mustard is 60-80 kg N per acre.
    *   **At Sowing:** Apply half of the recommended Nitrogen.
    *   **At First Irrigation (25-30 days after sowing):** Apply the remaining half of the Nitrogen.
    *   **Chemical Source:**
        *   **Urea** (46% N): Apply 130-175 kg **Urea** per acre in two equal splits (e.g., 65-87.5 kg at sowing and 65-87.5 kg at first irrigation).

**2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency:**
Phosphorus is essential for root development, flowering, seed formation, and energy transfer within the plant.
*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, dark green or purplish discoloration of leaves (especially older ones), delayed maturity, and poor root development.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   Phosphorus is generally applied as a basal dose at the time of sowing, as it is less mobile in the soil. A common recommendation is 20-24 kg P2O5 per acre.
    *   **Chemical Sources:**
        *   **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5): Apply 45-52 kg **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** per acre at sowing. This will also contribute some Nitrogen.
        *   **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5): Apply 125-150 kg **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** per acre at sowing.

**3. Potassium (K) Deficiency:**
Potassium plays a crucial role in water regulation, disease resistance, photosynthesis, and overall plant strength and seed filling.
*   **Symptoms:** Yellowing and browning (scorching) of leaf margins, especially on older leaves, weak stems, lodging, poor seed development, and increased susceptibility to diseases.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   Potassium is also generally applied as a basal dose at the time of sowing. A common recommendation is 12-16 kg K2O per acre.
    *   **Chemical Source:**
        *   **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** (60% K2O): Apply 20-27 kg **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** per acre at sowing.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Soil Testing:** Always prioritize soil testing to get precise recommendations for your specific field conditions. This helps in applying nutrients judiciously and avoiding over-application, which can be harmful and uneconomical.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management:** Combine chemical fertilizers with organic manures (Farm Yard Manure, compost) to improve soil health and nutrient availability.
*   **Application Method:** Ensure uniform application of fertilizers for optimal uptake by plants.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively address macro-nutrient deficiencies and ensure healthy growth and good yield in your Mustard crop.
