As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in Mustard in Haryana:

### Borers

This is not known to affect Mustard as a distinct major pest category (e.g., stem borers like those found in maize or sugarcane). While some caterpillars might bore into pods in later stages, dedicated "borers" are not primary pests of mustard.

### Caterpillars (e.g., Tobacco Caterpillar, Cabbage Butterfly, Mustard Sawfly, Bihar Hairy Caterpillar)

Caterpillars are significant defoliators of mustard. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategies are crucial.

**Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   Regular monitoring of the crop for early detection of larvae.
*   Hand-picking and destroying larger caterpillars and egg masses, especially in early stages and smaller fields.
*   Maintaining field hygiene and removing weeds that can act as alternate hosts.

**Biological Control:**
*   Encourage natural enemies like parasitic wasps and predatory birds.
*   Application of **Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)** formulations, which are effective against young larvae.
    *   **Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) wettable powder:** 500-1000 g/acre mixed in 200 litres of water.

**Chemical Control (when pest population exceeds economic threshold):**
*   **Emamectin Benzoate 5% SG:** 220 g/acre mixed in 200 litres of water.
*   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** 60 ml/acre mixed in 200 litres of water.
*   **Indoxacarb 14.5% SC:** 200 ml/acre mixed in 200 litres of water.

### Diamondback Moth (DBM - *Plutella xylostella*)

DBM can be a serious pest, especially in areas where cruciferous vegetables are also grown.

**Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   Crop rotation with non-cruciferous crops.
*   Removal of crop residues after harvest.
*   Installation of pheromone traps at 5 traps/acre to monitor and mass trap male moths.

**Biological Control:**
*   Application of **Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)** formulations, particularly effective against young larvae.
    *   **Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) wettable powder:** 500-1000 g/acre mixed in 200 litres of water.

**Chemical Control (when pest population exceeds economic threshold):**
*   **Emamectin Benzoate 5% SG:** 220 g/acre mixed in 200 litres of water.
*   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** 60 ml/acre mixed in 200 litres of water.
*   **Spinetoram 11.7% SC:** 150-170 ml/acre mixed in 200 litres of water.

### Leaf Folder (*Crocidolomia binotalis*)

Leaf folders cause damage by folding leaves and feeding from within, leading to reduced photosynthetic area.

**Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   Regular monitoring for folded leaves and larvae.
*   Hand-picking and destroying folded leaves containing larvae in early stages.

**Chemical Control (when pest population exceeds economic threshold):**
*   **Emamectin Benzoate 5% SG:** 220 g/acre mixed in 200 litres of water.
*   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** 60 ml/acre mixed in 200 litres of water.
*   **Indoxacarb 14.5% SC:** 200 ml/acre mixed in 200 litres of water.

**General Recommendations for Chemical Application:**
*   Always ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the underside of leaves where pests often reside.
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
*   Apply insecticides preferably in the evening or early morning to minimize impact on beneficial insects and pollinators.
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label for safe and effective use.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension officers for specific recommendations based on current pest pressure and local conditions.
