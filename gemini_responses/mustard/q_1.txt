As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm the following regarding smut diseases in Mustard:

This is not known to affect Mustard. The smut diseases you mentioned (Black smut, False smut, Kernel smut, and Loose smut) are primarily diseases of cereal crops like wheat, barley, oats, and rice, and are not known to affect mustard (Brassica juncea) in Haryana or elsewhere. Mustard is generally affected by other fungal diseases such as Alternaria blight, White rust, and Downy mildew.
