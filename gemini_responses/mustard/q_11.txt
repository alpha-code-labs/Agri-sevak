Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies in your Mustard crop in Haryana. Effective management requires timely identification and appropriate intervention.

Here are the recommended control measures:

### 1. Control of Beetles (e.g., Flea Beetles, Blister Beetles)

**Flea Beetles** are primarily a pest of young seedlings, causing shot-hole damage to leaves. **Blister Beetles** typically appear during the flowering stage and feed on flowers and pods.

*   **For Flea Beetles (at seedling stage):**
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: 50-70 ml per acre
    *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: 40 g per acre
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: 100 ml per acre
*   **For Blister Beetles (at flowering stage):**
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: 100 ml per acre
    *   **Cypermethrin** 25% EC: 100 ml per acre

### 2. Control of Weevils (e.g., Cabbage Seedpod Weevil)

The **Cabbage Seedpod Weevil** is a significant pest that damages developing seeds inside the pods, leading to yield loss. Damage is typically observed during the pod formation stage.

*   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: 100 ml per acre
*   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: 500 ml per acre (Use with caution and as a last resort due to its broad-spectrum nature)

### 3. Control of Sawflies (e.g., Mustard Sawfly)

The **Mustard Sawfly** is a very common and destructive pest, especially during the early vegetative stages. Its larvae feed voraciously on leaves, causing significant defoliation.

*   **Quinalphos** 25% EC: 500 ml per acre
*   **Malathion** 50% EC: 500 ml per acre
*   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: 100 ml per acre
*   **Indoxacarb** 14.5% SC: 200 ml per acre

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Timely Application:** Apply insecticides when pest incidence reaches the Economic Threshold Level (ETL) to prevent significant damage.
*   **Water Volume:** Ensure proper coverage by using an adequate volume of water (typically 200-250 litres per acre for spray solutions).
*   **Safety Precautions:** Always wear protective clothing (gloves, mask, goggles) while handling and spraying chemicals. Read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully.
*   **Integrated Pest Management (IPM):** For sustainable pest control, integrate cultural practices (e.g., timely sowing, field sanitation), biological control, and chemical control.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation to break the pest life cycle.
