As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling weeds in Mustard (Raya/Sarson) in Haryana. Effective weed management is crucial for maximizing mustard yield.

**Integrated Weed Management (IWM) Principles:**
For sustainable and effective weed control, it is recommended to adopt an Integrated Weed Management approach, combining cultural, mechanical, and chemical methods.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Use clean, certified mustard seeds free from weed seeds, especially Amarbail and Orobanche.
    *   Timely sowing of mustard helps the crop establish a competitive advantage over weeds.
    *   Proper seedbed preparation and optimum plant spacing.
    *   Crop rotation with non-host crops (e.g., wheat, rice) can help reduce the build-up of specific problematic weeds like Orobanche.
    *   Manual weeding or inter-cultivation can be effective for small areas or as a supplementary measure, especially for parasitic weeds.

**Chemical Control Measures:**

**1. Pre-emergence Herbicide (Applied within 0-3 days of sowing):**
This targets germinating weeds before they emerge from the soil, providing broad-spectrum control.

*   For Broadleaf Weeds (e.g., Bathu, Congress grass) and Narrowleaf Weeds (e.g., Phalaris minor), and for initial suppression of Amarbail and Orobanche:
    *   **Pendimethalin 30% EC** at **3.3 litres per acre** in 200-300 litres of water.
    *   Apply evenly on moist soil immediately after sowing or within 3 days.

**2. Post-emergence Herbicides (Applied 20-30 days after sowing, when weeds are 2-4 leaf stage):**
These are applied after the crop and weeds have emerged. Choose the appropriate herbicide based on the predominant weed type.

*   **For Broadleaf Weeds (including Bathu, Congress grass, Pyaazi, Krishnaneel):**
    *   **Metribuzin 70% WP** at **100-140 grams per acre** in 200-300 litres of water. Apply carefully, as mustard can be sensitive to higher doses.
    *   **Pyrazosulfuron ethyl 10% WP** at **80-100 grams per acre** in 200-300 litres of water.
    *   **Imazethapyr 10% SL** at **400-500 ml per acre** in 200-300 litres of water. (Note: Some mustard varieties show better tolerance to Imazethapyr. Consult your seed provider or HAU for variety-specific recommendations).

*   **For Narrowleaf Weeds / Grassy Weeds (including Phalaris minor, Wild Oats):**
    *   **Quizalofop-ethyl 5% EC** at **800-1000 ml per acre** in 200-300 litres of water.
    *   **Clodinafop-propargyl 25% EC** at **240 ml per acre** in 200-300 litres of water.
    *   **Fenoxaprop-p-ethyl 10% EC** at **500-600 ml per acre** in 200-300 litres of water.

**3. Specific Parasitic Weeds:**

*   **Amarbail (Cuscuta spp.):**
    *   **Prevention is paramount:** Use only certified, Amarbail-free mustard seeds. Avoid sowing in fields known to be infested.
    *   **Pre-emergence:** **Pendimethalin 30% EC** (as mentioned above) can provide some reduction in Amarbail germination.
    *   **Post-emergence:** Once Amarbail has established on the mustard crop, chemical control is extremely difficult without causing significant damage to the mustard. Manual removal of Amarbail patches is the most effective method for control in infested areas. Remove and destroy the parasitic weed before it sets seeds.

*   **Orobanche (Broomrape):**
    *   **Prevention is critical:** Use clean seeds. Practice strict crop rotation with non-host crops (e.g., cereals like wheat, barley, or legumes like chickpea). Deep ploughing can help reduce the seed bank.
    *   **Pre-emergence:** **Pendimethalin 30% EC** (as mentioned above) can offer some suppression of Orobanche seed germination.
    *   **Post-emergence:** There is no CIBRC approved herbicide for effective post-emergence control of Orobanche in mustard without causing unacceptable crop injury. Manual removal of Orobanche shoots before they flower and set seeds is crucial to prevent further spread and reduce the seed bank in the soil.

**General Application Guidelines:**

*   Always use a flat fan nozzle for uniform spray coverage.
*   Ensure adequate soil moisture at the time of herbicide application, especially for pre-emergence herbicides.
*   Apply herbicides when weeds are young and actively growing for best results.
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the herbicide label carefully before use.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application.
