Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding soil pests in Mustard. Effective management of these pests is crucial for ensuring a healthy crop and good yield. Here's scientifically verified advice for controlling termites and nematodes in Mustard:

It is important to adopt an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods for sustainable control.

### 1. Termites (Dimag)

Termites are a significant soil pest, especially in light, sandy soils and during dry periods. They feed on the roots and stem base, leading to wilting, stunted growth, and eventual plant death.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove all crop residues, stubble, and woody debris from the field before sowing.
    *   **Deep Plowing:** Deep summer plowing exposes termite colonies to the sun and predators, reducing their population.
    *   **Irrigation:** Adequate moisture in the soil can deter termite activity.
    *   **Farmyard Manure (FYM):** Ensure well-decomposed FYM is used, as undecomposed organic matter can attract termites.
*   **Chemical Control (at sowing or pre-sowing):**
    *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC:** Apply 2.0 - 2.5 L per acre by mixing it with 200-400 L of water and drenching the soil or applying through irrigation water before sowing or at the time of sowing.
    *   **Fipronil 0.3% GR:** Apply 6.0 - 8.0 kg per acre by broadcasting and mixing thoroughly into the soil at the time of sowing.

### 2. Nematodes (Root-knot Nematodes / Mool Granthi Krumi)

Root-knot nematodes (*Meloidogyne* species) are microscopic roundworms that infect plant roots, causing characteristic galls or knots. This damage impairs water and nutrient uptake, leading to stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, reduced vigor, and significant yield losses.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate Mustard with non-host crops like cereals (e.g., wheat, barley) for at least 2-3 years. Avoid continuous cultivation of susceptible crops.
    *   **Summer Plowing:** Deep plowing during hot summer months exposes nematode eggs and larvae to desiccation and sunlight, reducing their population.
    *   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporate well-decomposed Farmyard Manure (FYM) or compost, and especially **Neem cake** at 200-400 kg per acre into the soil 2-3 weeks before sowing. Neem cake has nematicidal properties.
    *   **Resistant Varieties:** If available and recommended for your region, choose nematode-resistant Mustard varieties.
*   **Chemical Control (at sowing):**
    *   **Carbofuran 3% GR:** Apply 10 - 15 kg per acre by broadcasting and mixing thoroughly into the soil at the time of sowing.
    *   **Phorate 10% GR:** Apply 4 kg per acre by broadcasting and mixing thoroughly into the soil at the time of sowing.

**Important Note:** Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully regarding dosage, application method, safety precautions, and waiting periods. Consult your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions.
