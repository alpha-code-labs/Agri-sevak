Mites, including Red Spider Mite (*Tetranychus urticae*) and Rust Mite (*Aceria brassicae*), are significant pests of Mustard in Haryana, especially during dry and warm weather conditions. Effective control requires an integrated approach.

**Symptoms of Mite Infestation:**

*   **Red Spider Mite:** Initial symptoms include yellowish-white spots on the upper surface of leaves. As infestation progresses, leaves turn bronze or reddish-brown, curl downwards, and may show fine silken webbing on the underside. Severely infested leaves dry up and shed prematurely.
*   **Rust Mite:** Infested leaves become thickened, brittle, curled, and distorted. The plant growth is stunted, and the leaves may develop a rusty or silvery appearance, particularly on the underside. Flower buds and pods can also be affected, leading to reduced yield.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Mites in Mustard:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Timely Sowing:** Sowing at the recommended time can help plants escape peak mite activity periods.
    *   **Weed Management:** Remove weeds from and around the field, as they can serve as alternate hosts for mites.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can make plants more succulent and attractive to mites. Maintain balanced nutrition.
    *   **Irrigation:** Provide adequate irrigation, as water stress can exacerbate mite problems. Overhead irrigation can sometimes help wash off mites.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Conserve natural enemies such as predatory mites (e.g., *Amblyseius* spp.), ladybird beetles, and lacewings, which prey on mites. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

3.  **Chemical Control:**
    When mite infestation reaches economic threshold levels (e.g., 5-10 mites per leaf or visible damage), chemical intervention may be necessary. Always ensure thorough coverage, especially on the underside of leaves where mites reside. Rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

    The following CIBRC approved acaricides are recommended for mite control in Mustard:

    *   **Propargite 57% EC:** 1.25 L per acre (mixed in 200-250 L of water).
    *   **Ethion 50% EC:** 1.25 L per acre (mixed in 200-250 L of water).
    *   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** 112.5 ml per acre (mixed in 200-250 L of water).
    *   **Fenpyroximate 5% SC:** 250-300 ml per acre (mixed in 200-250 L of water).
    *   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP:** 2.0-2.5 kg per acre (mixed in 200-250 L of water). This also helps in controlling powdery mildew.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Spray Technique:** Ensure complete coverage of the plant, particularly the undersides of leaves, as mites are often found there. Use a high-volume sprayer for best results.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying. Follow the instructions on the product label regarding dosage, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and safety precautions.
*   **Resistance Management:** Do not use the same chemical repeatedly. Alternate between different groups of acaricides to prevent mites from developing resistance.
*   **Monitoring:** Regularly scout your fields to detect mite infestations early, allowing for timely intervention.
