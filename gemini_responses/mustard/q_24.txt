As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I must clarify that **Mustard (Brassica juncea, Brassica campestris, etc.) is predominantly a direct-sown crop and is generally not recommended for transplantation in commercial cultivation in Haryana.**

The primary reasons for this established agricultural practice are:

*   **Taproot System:** Mustard develops a strong, deep taproot system that is highly sensitive to disturbance. Transplanting can cause significant damage to this root, leading to severe transplant shock, poor establishment, stunted growth, and ultimately, a substantial reduction in yield.
*   **Stress Susceptibility:** Mustard seedlings are delicate and highly susceptible to stress during the transplanting process, resulting in high mortality rates and uneven stands.
*   **Cost and Labor Efficiency:** Direct sowing is a more economical and less labor-intensive method for large-scale mustard cultivation compared to raising seedlings in nurseries and then transplanting them.
*   **Rapid Establishment:** Mustard seeds germinate and establish quickly when direct-sown, making transplanting an unnecessary and often detrimental practice.

**Therefore, there is no 'ideal transplantation time, distance, or process' recommended for mustard as a standard agricultural practice for optimal yield and efficiency.**

*However, if one were to consider transplanting for very specific, limited purposes (e.g., gap filling in a direct-sown field where a few plants have failed, or small-scale experimental plots where individual plant care is paramount), the following considerations would apply, though these are not standard recommendations for commercial production:*

*   **Transplantation Time:**
    *   Seedlings should be transplanted when they are very young, typically 3-4 weeks old, having 2-4 true leaves. Older seedlings suffer significantly more from transplant shock.
    *   Transplant during the cooler parts of the day, preferably late afternoon or evening, to minimize heat and moisture stress.
    *   Ensure the soil in both the nursery and the field is adequately moist before and after transplanting.

*   **Distance:**
    *   If transplanted, the spacing would ideally mimic recommended direct-sown spacing to allow for proper plant development, light interception, and air circulation.
    *   **Row-to-row distance:** 30-45 cm
    *   **Plant-to-plant distance:** 10-15 cm

*   **Process:**
    *   **Nursery Preparation:** Raise seedlings in trays or small beds with well-drained, fertile soil. Ensure adequate moisture.
    *   **Hardening Off:** Gradually expose seedlings to outdoor conditions (reduced water, increased sunlight) for a few days before transplanting to acclimate them to field conditions.
    *   **Extraction:** Carefully lift seedlings with their root ball as intact as possible to minimize root damage. Using a trowel or specialized tool is crucial.
    *   **Planting:** Create holes in the field at the desired spacing. Place the seedling gently, ensuring the root collar is at the same level as it was in the nursery. Firm the soil gently around the base of the plant.
    *   **Immediate Irrigation:** Water immediately after transplanting to settle the soil around the roots and reduce transplant shock.
    *   **Post-Transplant Care:** Monitor transplanted seedlings closely for wilting and provide light, frequent irrigation until they are well-established.

**In conclusion, for optimal yield and efficient cultivation of mustard in Haryana, direct sowing is the universally recommended and scientifically sound practice.**
