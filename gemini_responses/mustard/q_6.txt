As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding viral diseases in Mustard for Haryana.

First, let's address the specific viral diseases you've mentioned:

*   **Leaf curl:** This is known to affect Mustard.
*   **Mosaic:** This is known to affect Mustard (e.g., Turnip Mosaic Virus, Cauliflower Mosaic Virus).
*   **Yellow vein clearing:** This is not known to affect Mustard as a specific, primary viral disease. While some viral infections might cause vein yellowing, "Yellow Vein Clearing Virus" is not a recognized distinct disease of mustard.
*   **Stripe:** This is not known to affect Mustard.
*   **Tristeza:** This is not known to affect Mustard. (It is primarily a disease of citrus).
*   **Stunt virus:** While various viral infections can lead to stunting in mustard, "Stunt virus" is not a specific, named viral disease of mustard.

For the viral diseases that *do* affect Mustard (Leaf curl and Mosaic), it is crucial to understand that there are no direct chemical treatments (viricides) available to cure a plant once it is infected with a virus. Therefore, control strategies focus primarily on prevention and managing the vectors that transmit these viruses.

Here are the recommended control measures for viral diseases like Leaf curl and Mosaic in Mustard:

1.  **Use Resistant Varieties:**
    *   The most effective long-term solution is to cultivate mustard varieties that are known to be resistant or tolerant to common viral diseases prevalent in the region. Consult with HAU or local agricultural extension for recommended varieties.

2.  **Vector Control:**
    *   Many mustard viruses (especially mosaic and leaf curl) are transmitted by insect vectors such as aphids and whiteflies. Controlling these vectors is paramount.
    *   **Early Detection and Monitoring:** Regularly scout fields for the presence of aphids and whiteflies.
    *   **Chemical Control (as per CIBRC approval):**
        *   For Aphids:
            *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL at 125 ml/acre (for foliar spray) or 5-7 ml/kg seed (for seed treatment).
            *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG at 50 g/acre (for foliar spray) or 3 g/kg seed (for seed treatment).
            *   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP at 50-100 g/acre.
            *   **Flonicamid** 50% WG at 60 g/acre.
        *   For Whiteflies (if present and transmitting leaf curl):
            *   **Buprofezin** 25% SC at 600 ml/acre.
            *   **Diafenthiuron** 50% WP at 250 g/acre.
            *   **Spiromesifen** 22.9% SC at 125 ml/acre.
            *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL at 125 ml/acre.
            *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG at 50 g/acre.
    *   **Note:** Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development. Apply sprays during cooler parts of the day.

3.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Removal of Infected Plants (Roguing):** Promptly remove and destroy any plants showing symptoms of viral infection to prevent further spread within the field.
    *   **Weed Management:** Many weeds act as alternate hosts for viruses and their insect vectors. Keep the field and surrounding areas free of weeds.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops to break the disease cycle.
    *   **Optimum Plant Spacing:** Maintain recommended plant spacing to ensure good air circulation and reduce plant-to-plant contact, which can limit vector movement.
    *   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure balanced fertilization to promote vigorous plant growth, which can help plants tolerate stress, though it won't prevent infection. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can make plants more attractive to aphids.
    *   **Sanitation:** Remove crop residues after harvest to eliminate potential sources of inoculum and overwintering vectors.

4.  **Seed Treatment:**
    *   While seed treatment doesn't directly control viruses, treating seeds with systemic insecticides (e.g., **Imidacloprid** or **Thiamethoxam**) can provide early protection against sucking pests like aphids, thereby reducing early viral transmission.

By implementing these integrated management strategies, you can significantly reduce the incidence and spread of viral diseases in your mustard crop.
