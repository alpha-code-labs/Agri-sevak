As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the use of growth regulators and micronutrients in Mustard cultivation in Haryana:

It is crucial to understand the specific role and impact of each substance on the Mustard crop.

*   **Ethephon (formerly known by brand name Ethrel)**
    *   **Ethephon** is primarily known for its role in fruit ripening, defoliation, and inducing male sterility in hybrid seed production in various crops.
    *   However, its use as a general growth regulator for enhancing yield in commercial Mustard production is **not a standard recommendation** by Haryana Agricultural University. Its application for general growth promotion or yield increase in Mustard is not typically advised under normal cultivation practices in Haryana.

*   **2,4-D**
    *   **2,4-D** (2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) is a synthetic auxin, but it is predominantly used as a selective herbicide for controlling broadleaf weeds.
    *   Mustard (Brassica juncea) is itself a broadleaf crop and is highly susceptible to **2,4-D**.
    *   Applying **2,4-D** to Mustard will cause severe phytotoxicity, leading to significant damage, deformation, or even death of the crop.
    *   Therefore, **2,4-D is strictly NOT recommended as a growth regulator for Mustard** under any circumstances. Its application would be detrimental to the crop.

*   **Boron**
    *   Boron is an essential micronutrient for Mustard, playing a critical role in pollen germination, fertilization, pod setting, and seed development. Boron deficiency is common in many soils of Haryana and can significantly reduce Mustard yield.
    *   **Recommendation:** Foliar application of Boron is highly recommended, especially in soils with known or suspected Boron deficiency.
    *   **Technical Chemical Name:** **Borax (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate)** or **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (e.g., Solubor).
    *   **Recommended Dose and Timing:**
        *   **First Spray:** Apply 400-500 g of **Borax (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate)** per acre dissolved in 200-250 litres of water at the pre-flowering stage (when flower buds start appearing). This corresponds to approximately a 0.16-0.2% solution.
        *   **Second Spray (if needed):** If severe deficiency symptoms persist or for maximizing yield in high-yielding varieties, a second spray can be given at the pod development stage using the same dose.
    *   **Alternatively, if using Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate (e.g., Solubor, which has higher Boron content):** Apply 200-250 g per acre dissolved in 200-250 litres of water at the same stages.

Always ensure thorough coverage of the foliage during spraying for optimal absorption.
