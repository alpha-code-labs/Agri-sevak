As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for improving yield, fruit quality (seed quality), and storage life for Mustard in Haryana:

### Improving Yield for Mustard

1.  **Variety Selection:** Choose high-yielding, disease-resistant varieties recommended for Haryana conditions. Consult HAU recommendations for the latest suitable varieties.
2.  **Optimal Sowing Time:** Sow mustard during the optimal window, typically from the last week of October to mid-November, to ensure proper growth and avoid extreme temperatures during critical stages.
3.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Nitrogen (N):** Apply 60-80 kg N per acre. Apply half at sowing and the remaining half at the first irrigation (around 30-35 days after sowing).
    *   **Phosphorus (P):** Apply 20-24 kg P2O5 per acre at the time of sowing.
    *   **Potassium (K):** Apply 12-16 kg K2O per acre at the time of sowing, especially on light soils or where soil tests indicate deficiency.
    *   **Sulphur (S):** Crucial for oilseed crops. Apply 20 kg S per acre at sowing, preferably through **Gypsum** or **Bentonite Sulphur**.
    *   **Boron (B):** Apply 250 g **Borax** (10.5% B) per acre as a foliar spray at the pre-flowering stage (bud initiation) to improve flowering and pod setting. Alternatively, apply 1 kg **Borax** per acre as a soil application at sowing in boron-deficient soils.
    *   **Zinc (Zn):** If soil tests indicate deficiency, apply 10 kg **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** (21% Zn) per acre as a soil application at sowing, or 500 g **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** per acre as a foliar spray at 30-40 days after sowing.
4.  **Irrigation Management:** Provide 1-2 irrigations. The first irrigation is critical at the pre-flowering stage (30-40 days after sowing), and the second at the pod development stage if soil moisture is insufficient. Avoid waterlogging.
5.  **Weed Management:** Control weeds effectively, especially during the first 30-60 days after sowing, which is the critical period of crop-weed competition.
    *   Pre-emergence application: **Pendimethalin** 1.0 kg a.i. per acre (e.g., 3.3 L of 30% EC formulation) immediately after sowing or within 3 days.
    *   Post-emergence application (for broad-leaf weeds): **Metribuzin** 100-150 g a.i. per acre (e.g., 200-300 g of 70% WP formulation) at 20-25 days after sowing.
6.  **Pest and Disease Management:** Timely management of major pests and diseases like aphids, Alternaria blight, and white rust is essential to prevent yield losses.
    *   **Aphids:** For severe infestation, spray **Imidacloprid** 0.2 ml/L or **Thiamethoxam** 0.2 g/L.
    *   **Alternaria Blight/White Rust:** For disease management, spray **Mancozeb** 2.5 g/L or **Azoxystrobin** 0.5 ml/L at the appearance of symptoms and repeat if necessary.

### Improving Fruit Quality (Seed Quality and Oil Content)

1.  **Sulphur Application:** Adequate Sulphur is paramount for oil synthesis in mustard. Ensure the recommended dose of 20 kg S per acre is applied.
2.  **Boron Application:** Boron deficiency can lead to poor seed setting and shriveled seeds. Foliar application of **Borax** (250 g per acre) at the pre-flowering stage significantly improves seed filling and oil content.
3.  **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure balanced application of N, P, K, and micronutrients as per soil test recommendations. Over-application of Nitrogen can sometimes reduce oil content, so adhere to recommended doses.
4.  **Timely Irrigation:** Avoid moisture stress, especially during the flowering and pod development stages, as it can negatively impact seed size and oil accumulation.
5.  **Pest and Disease Control:** Healthy plants produce better quality seeds with higher oil content. Effective management of pests and diseases prevents damage to developing seeds.
6.  **Timely Harvesting:** Harvest the crop when 70-75% of the pods turn yellow and seeds become firm and dark. Delayed harvesting can lead to shattering losses and reduced seed quality.

### Improving Storage Life for Mustard Seeds

1.  **Proper Drying:** This is the most critical step. Dry mustard seeds to a safe moisture content of 8-9% before storage. Higher moisture content promotes mold growth and insect infestation.
2.  **Cleaning and Grading:** Thoroughly clean the harvested seeds to remove chaff, dirt, weed seeds, and damaged seeds. This reduces the inoculum for pests and diseases.
3.  **Storage Structure:** Store seeds in clean, dry, cool, and well-ventilated storage structures. Ensure the storage area is free from cracks and crevices that can harbor pests.
4.  **Airtight Containers:** For small quantities, store seeds in airtight containers (e.g., metal bins, plastic drums) to prevent moisture re-absorption and pest entry.
5.  **Pest Management in Storage:**
    *   **Sanitation:** Clean the storage area thoroughly before storing new produce. Remove old grain residues.
    *   **Fumigation (if necessary):** For large-scale storage and severe infestation, fumigation can be done by trained personnel using CIBRC-approved fumigants like **Aluminium Phosphide** tablets (e.g., 3 tablets of 3g each per tonne of grain for 5-7 days, under airtight conditions). This should only be done by professionals due to its highly toxic nature.
    *   **Insecticides (Surface treatment):** For empty godowns, spray the walls and floor with **Malathion** 50% EC at 10 ml/L of water, 2-3 weeks before storing grains.
6.  **Regular Inspection:** Periodically inspect stored seeds for signs of moisture, mold growth, or insect infestation. Take corrective measures immediately if any issues are observed.
