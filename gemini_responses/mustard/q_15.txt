As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I advise on the control of pests in Mustard, emphasizing integrated pest management (IPM) principles. Always scout your fields regularly and apply control measures only when pest populations reach economic threshold levels.

Here's the scientifically verified advice for the mentioned pests:

### Grasshopper

Grasshoppers can occasionally cause damage to mustard, especially during early growth stages.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Maintain field sanitation by removing weeds and crop residues that can serve as breeding grounds.
    *   Deep ploughing after harvest can expose and destroy eggs laid in the soil.
*   **Chemical Control (if infestation is severe):**
    *   **Malathion** 50% EC: 1.25 L per acre in 500 L of water.
    *   **Quinalphos** 25% EC: 1.0 L per acre in 500 L of water.

### Painted Bug (Bagrada hilaris)

The Painted Bug is a significant pest of mustard in Haryana, causing damage by sucking sap from leaves, stems, and pods, leading to wilting and reduced yield.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Remove cruciferous weeds (e.g., wild radish, wild mustard) from the field and surrounding areas, as they act as alternate hosts.
    *   Early sowing of mustard can sometimes help escape peak infestation periods.
    *   Destroy crop residues immediately after harvest to reduce carry-over populations.
*   **Chemical Control (when pest population exceeds economic threshold):**
    *   **Dimethoate** 30% EC: 400 ml per acre in 200-400 L of water.
    *   **Malathion** 50% EC: 500 ml per acre in 200-400 L of water.
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: 100-125 ml per acre in 200-400 L of water.
    *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: 40-50 g per acre in 200-400 L of water.
    *   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP: 50-60 g per acre in 200-400 L of water.

### Red Cotton Bug

This is not known to affect Mustard. The Red Cotton Bug (Dysdercus cingulatus) is primarily a pest of cotton and other malvaceous crops, feeding on developing seeds. It is not considered a pest of economic significance in mustard.

### Black Ants

This is not known to affect Mustard. Black ants are generally not direct pests of mustard. They might be observed in mustard fields if other sap-sucking pests like aphids are present, as ants are attracted to the honeydew secreted by aphids. In such cases, controlling the primary pest (e.g., aphids) would indirectly manage the ant population.
