As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling sucking pests in Mustard in Haryana.

First, regarding **Psylla**: This is not known to affect Mustard. Psyllids are primarily pests of woody plants and are not typically found on Brassica crops like mustard.

For the control of other sucking pests like **Aphids, Leafhopper, Whitefly, and Thrips** in Mustard, an integrated pest management (IPM) approach is most effective.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Timely Sowing:** Sow mustard varieties at the recommended time to avoid peak pest infestation periods.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, as it can lead to lush growth that attracts sucking pests.
    *   **Weed Control:** Keep fields free of weeds, which can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove crop residues after harvest to reduce overwintering pest populations.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Protect and encourage natural predators like ladybird beetles, syrphid fly larvae, lacewings, and parasitoids (e.g., *Diaeretiella rapae* for aphids). Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides when natural enemy populations are high.

3.  **Chemical Control (Based on CIBRC Approved Technical Chemicals for Haryana):**
    Apply insecticides only when pest populations reach economic threshold levels, typically when 10-15% of plants are infested with aphids or other sucking pests. Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves.

    Here are some CIBRC approved technical chemicals and their recommended dosages:

    *   For **Aphids, Leafhopper, Whitefly, and Thrips**:
        *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL**: 125-150 ml per acre
        *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG**: 40-50 g per acre
        *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP**: 50-100 g per acre
        *   **Dinotefuran 20% SG**: 80 g per acre

    *   Specifically for **Aphids**:
        *   **Flonicamid 50% WG**: 60 g per acre
        *   **Dimethoate 30% EC**: 330 ml per acre

    **Important Considerations for Chemical Application:**
    *   Always use the recommended quantity of water, typically 200-250 litres per acre, for effective spray coverage.
    *   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.
    *   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully, including safety precautions and pre-harvest intervals (PHI).
    *   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying.
