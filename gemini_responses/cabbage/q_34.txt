Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding the potential harmful effects of weedicides/herbicides on your cabbage crop. While herbicides are valuable tools for weed management, their improper use can indeed lead to phytotoxicity, stunting, or reduced yield in cabbage. The key to minimizing these risks lies in adopting an Integrated Weed Management (IWM) approach and strictly adhering to scientific recommendations.

Here's how you can reduce the harmful effects of weedicides/herbicides in cabbage:

**1. Adopt Integrated Weed Management (IWM):**
Herbicides should be part of a broader strategy, not the sole method.
*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Timely Land Preparation:** Thorough ploughing and harrowing can reduce initial weed load.
    *   **Healthy Seedlings:** Use vigorous, disease-free seedlings for transplanting to ensure quick establishment and better competition with weeds.
    *   **Optimum Spacing:** Maintain recommended plant spacing to allow cabbage plants to grow robustly and shade out weeds.
    *   **Mulching:** Organic mulches (straw, crop residues) can suppress weed growth and conserve soil moisture.
*   **Mechanical Methods:**
    *   **Hand Weeding:** This remains the most effective and safest method for weed control in cabbage, especially for small holdings. Perform 1-2 hand weedings at 20-30 and 40-50 days after transplanting.
    *   **Intercultivation:** Shallow intercultivation between rows can control young weeds without disturbing the crop roots.

**2. Choose the Right Herbicide:**
*   Select only CIBRC (Central Insecticides Board & Registration Committee) approved herbicides specifically recommended for cabbage. Using non-selective herbicides or those not approved for cabbage can cause severe damage.

**3. Ensure Accurate Dosage:**
*   Strictly follow the recommended dosage rates. Overdosing is a primary cause of phytotoxicity. Underdosing can lead to poor weed control and promote herbicide resistance.

**4. Apply at the Correct Timing:**
*   **Pre-emergence (PRE) Herbicides:** These are applied to the soil surface *before* weeds emerge and *after* cabbage transplanting. They form a chemical barrier that kills germinating weeds. This timing generally poses less risk to the established cabbage plants.
*   **Post-emergence (POST) Herbicides:** These are applied *after* weeds have emerged. For cabbage, post-emergence herbicides are primarily used for grassy weeds, as broadleaf weed control options are very limited and carry a high risk of crop injury.

**5. Implement Proper Application Techniques:**
*   **Uniform Coverage:** Ensure even spray distribution over the target area. Uneven application can lead to patches of uncontrolled weeds or areas of crop injury.
*   **Appropriate Nozzles:** Use flat fan nozzles for herbicide application to ensure uniform coverage and minimize drift.
*   **Adequate Water Volume:** Use the recommended water volume (typically 200-250 L/acre) to ensure proper herbicide activation and coverage.
*   **Avoid Drift:** Do not spray during windy conditions to prevent herbicide drift onto non-target crops or sensitive areas.
*   **Sprayer Calibration:** Regularly calibrate your sprayer to ensure it delivers the correct amount of herbicide per unit area.

**6. Consider Environmental Conditions:**
*   **Temperature:** Avoid spraying during extreme temperatures (very hot or very cold) as this can increase crop stress and susceptibility to herbicide injury.
*   **Moisture:** For pre-emergence herbicides, light soil moisture is crucial for activation. For post-emergence herbicides, avoid application if rain is expected within a few hours.
*   **Crop Stress:** Do not apply herbicides when the cabbage crop is under stress (e.g., water stress, nutrient deficiency, pest/disease attack), as stressed plants are more vulnerable to herbicide damage.

**7. Recommended CIBRC Approved Herbicides for Cabbage in Haryana:**

*   **For Pre-emergence Weed Control (within 3 days of transplanting):**
    *   **Pendimethalin** (30% EC): Apply **1.0 kg a.i./acre** (approximately **3.3 litres** of the commercial product) mixed in **200-250 litres of water** per acre. This controls a wide range of annual grasses and broadleaf weeds.
    *   **Oxyfluorfen** (23.5% EC): Apply **0.23 kg a.i./acre** (approximately **1.0 litre** of the commercial product) mixed in **200-250 litres of water** per acre. Effective against many broadleaf weeds and some grasses.

*   **For Post-emergence Grassy Weed Control (when grasses are at 2-4 leaf stage):**
    *   **Quizalofop-ethyl** (5% EC): Apply **50-100 g a.i./acre** (approximately **250-500 ml** of the commercial product) mixed in **200-250 litres of water** per acre. This is highly selective for grassy weeds and safe for cabbage.
    *   **Fluazifop-P-butyl** (25% EC): Apply **125-250 g a.i./acre** (approximately **500-1000 ml** of the commercial product) mixed in **200-250 litres of water** per acre. Also selective for grassy weeds.

**Important Precautions:**
*   Always read and follow the label instructions of the herbicide product carefully.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application.
*   Clean the sprayer thoroughly after use, especially if it was used for other types of pesticides.
*   Store herbicides safely, away from food, feed, and out of reach of children and animals.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively manage weeds in your cabbage crop while significantly reducing the risk of harmful effects from herbicides, ensuring a healthy and productive harvest. For any specific concerns or further guidance, please consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts.
