As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), here are the scientifically verified recommendations for seed and soil treatment processes for Cabbage in Haryana:

### Seed Treatment for Cabbage

Seed treatment is crucial for protecting young seedlings from seed-borne and soil-borne diseases and early insect pests, ensuring better germination and stand establishment.

*   **For fungal diseases (e.g., damping-off, blackleg):**
    *   Treat seeds with **Thiram** at 2-3 g per kg of seed.
    *   Alternatively, use **Captan** at 2-3 g per kg of seed.
    *   For systemic protection against damping-off, **Metalaxyl** at 1-2 g per kg of seed can be used, often in combination with other fungicides.
    *   For an organic approach or integrated pest management, treat seeds with *Trichoderma viride* at 5-10 g per kg of seed. If using chemical fungicides, apply *Trichoderma* after chemical treatment or as a separate application.
*   **For early season insect pests (e.g., flea beetles, sucking pests):**
    *   Treat seeds with **Imidacloprid** at 5-7 ml per kg of seed.
    *   Alternatively, use **Thiamethoxam** at 4-5 g per kg of seed. This provides systemic protection to young seedlings during their vulnerable initial growth phase.

### Soil Treatment for Cabbage

Soil treatment aims to manage soil-borne diseases, nematodes, and some insect pests before or at planting, creating a healthier environment for root development.

*   **For soil-borne fungal diseases (e.g., damping-off, root rot, clubroot):**
    *   **Nursery/Field Drenching:** Before or at transplanting, drench the soil with **Carbendazim** at 1 g per litre of water OR **Propamocarb hydrochloride** at 2-3 ml per litre of water.
    *   **For Clubroot Management (if history of disease in the field):**
        *   Apply **Flusulfamide** at 10-15 kg per acre as a pre-plant soil incorporation.
        *   Adjust soil pH to 7.0-7.2 by applying lime (calcium carbonate) at 200-400 kg per acre, 2-3 months before planting. This helps suppress clubroot development significantly.
    *   **Bio-fungicide Application:** Incorporate *Trichoderma viride* or *Pseudomonas fluorescens* at 2-4 kg per acre, mixed with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM), into the soil 7-10 days before planting.
*   **For Nematode Management (e.g., root-knot nematodes):**
    *   **At planting/transplanting:**
        *   Apply **Carbofuran** 3G granules at 10-15 kg per acre, broadcast and incorporated into the soil or applied in furrows.
        *   Alternatively, apply **Phorate** 10G granules at 4-6 kg per acre, broadcast and incorporated or applied in furrows.
        *   For a liquid option, **Fluensulfone** can be applied at 2 litres per acre via drenching or drip irrigation.

Always ensure proper safety measures, including wearing personal protective equipment, when handling and applying any chemical treatments. Follow the manufacturer's instructions and local agricultural guidelines for best results and environmental safety.
