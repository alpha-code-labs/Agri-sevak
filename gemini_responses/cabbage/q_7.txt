As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I must provide scientifically verified advice specific to Cabbage cultivation in Haryana.

Regarding your query:

1.  **Dieback**: This is not known to affect Cabbage. Dieback is a condition primarily associated with woody plants, trees, and shrubs, characterized by the progressive death of twigs and branches from the tips. Cabbage is an herbaceous plant and does not develop twigs or branches in this manner.

2.  **Twig blight**: This is not known to affect Cabbage. Similar to dieback, twig blight refers to the rapid browning and death of twigs and shoots, a condition typically found in woody plants. Cabbage, being an herbaceous crop, does not have twigs.

3.  **Tikka disease**: This is not known to affect Cabbage. Tikka disease is a specific and well-known leaf spot disease primarily affecting groundnut (peanut) crops, caused by *Cercospora* and *Passalora* species. It is not a recognized disease of Cabbage.
