As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Cabbage in Haryana:

It is crucial to implement an Integrated Disease Management (IDM) approach, combining cultural practices with judicious use of fungicides.

**General Cultural Practices for Fungal Disease Management in Cabbage:**
*   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting cabbage or other cruciferous crops in the same field for at least 2-3 years.
*   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris from the field.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available, choose cabbage varieties known to have resistance or tolerance to common fungal diseases.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to improve air circulation and reduce humidity within the canopy.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced fertilizers to promote healthy plant growth, avoiding excessive nitrogen which can make plants more susceptible.
*   **Irrigation Management:** Use drip irrigation or irrigate in the morning to allow foliage to dry quickly, reducing leaf wetness periods.

Here are the specific recommendations for the listed diseases:

### 1. Alternaria (Alternaria Leaf Spot / Early Blight)
This disease is caused by *Alternaria brassicicola* and *Alternaria japonica* and is common in Cabbage.
**Symptoms:** Small, dark, circular spots with concentric rings (target-spot appearance) on older leaves, which enlarge and may cause defoliation.
**Control Measures:**
*   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds with hot water (50°C for 25-30 minutes) or fungicides like **Thiram** (2 g/kg seed).
*   **Foliar Sprays:**
    *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L of water).
    *   **Chlorothalonil** (75% WP) at 2 kg/acre (or 2 g/L of water).
    *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC) at 200 ml/acre (or 0.5 ml/L of water).
    *   **Propineb** (70% WP) at 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L of water).
    *   **Tebuconazole** (25.9% EC) at 250 ml/acre (or 0.5 ml/L of water).
    *   Apply sprays at 10-15 day intervals, starting from the appearance of initial symptoms.

### 2. Anthracnose
This disease is caused by *Colletotrichum higginsianum* and can affect Cabbage.
**Symptoms:** Small, water-soaked spots on leaves, stems, and pods, which enlarge and turn dark brown to black, often with a sunken appearance.
**Control Measures:**
*   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds with hot water (50°C for 25-30 minutes) or fungicides like **Carbendazim** (2 g/kg seed).
*   **Foliar Sprays:**
    *   **Carbendazim** (50% WP) at 500 g/acre (or 1 g/L of water).
    *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L of water).
    *   **Chlorothalonil** (75% WP) at 2 kg/acre (or 2 g/L of water).
    *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC) at 200 ml/acre (or 0.5 ml/L of water).
    *   Apply sprays at 10-15 day intervals, especially during warm, humid conditions.

### 3. Blast
This is not known to affect Cabbage.

### 4. Blight
This is not known to affect Cabbage as a distinct fungal disease, separate from Alternaria leaf spot (sometimes referred to as early blight).

### 5. Brown spot
This is not known to affect Cabbage.

### 6. Downy Mildew
This disease is caused by *Hyaloperonospora parasitica* and is a significant problem in Cabbage.
**Symptoms:** Yellowish-brown spots on the upper surface of leaves, with a characteristic white to greyish-purple fuzzy growth (sporangiophores) on the underside, especially in humid conditions.
**Control Measures:**
*   **Foliar Sprays:**
    *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L of water) - effective as a preventive.
    *   Combination products are highly effective:
        *   **Metalaxyl + Mancozeb** (e.g., 8% + 64% WP) at 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L of water).
        *   **Dimethomorph + Mancozeb** (e.g., 9% + 60% WP) at 1 kg/acre (or 2 g/L of water).
        *   **Cymoxanil + Mancozeb** (e.g., 8% + 64% WP) at 1.5 kg/acre (or 3 g/L of water).
        *   **Fenamidone + Mancozeb** (e.g., 10% + 50% WG) at 1.25 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L of water).
    *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride** (72.2% SL) at 2.5 L/acre (or 5 ml/L of water).
    *   Initiate sprays as soon as symptoms appear or when conditions are favorable for disease development (cool, moist weather). Repeat at 7-10 day intervals.

### 7. Powdery Mildew
This is not known to affect Cabbage.

### 8. Grey mildew
This is not known to affect Cabbage. (Note: Grey mould, caused by *Botrytis cinerea*, is a different disease and not referred to as "Grey mildew").
