As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following doses for organic manures and bio-stimulants for Cabbage cultivation in Haryana:

**1. Farm Yard Manure (FYM):**
*   Apply 15-20 tonnes of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) per acre during land preparation, incorporating it thoroughly into the soil.

**2. Vermicompost:**
*   Alternatively, or as a supplement to FYM, apply 4-5 tonnes of vermicompost per acre during land preparation. Vermicompost can also be used as a top dressing at 1-2 tonnes per acre during the early growth stages.

**3. Sagarika (Seaweed Extract Bio-stimulant):**
Sagarika is a seaweed extract-based bio-stimulant that enhances nutrient uptake and plant growth. It is not a bulk organic manure but a growth promoter.

*   **Foliar Application (Liquid Sagarika):**
    *   Mix **Sagarika (liquid)** at a rate of 2.5-3 ml per litre of water.
    *   Spray 2-3 times during the crop cycle:
        *   First spray: 20-25 days after transplanting.
        *   Second spray: At the time of head initiation/formation.
        *   Third spray (optional): 15-20 days after the second spray, depending on crop vigour.

*   **Soil Application (Granular Sagarika):**
    *   Apply **Sagarika (granular)** at a rate of 8-10 kg per acre.
    *   This can be applied as a basal dose during land preparation or as a top dressing during early growth stages, followed by light irrigation.
