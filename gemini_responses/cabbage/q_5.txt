As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the conditions you've mentioned for Cabbage cultivation in Haryana:

1.  **Scab:**
    This is not known to affect Cabbage.

2.  **Canker (specifically Blackleg disease caused by *Phoma lingam*):**
    Canker, particularly in the form of Blackleg disease, is a significant concern for Cabbage. It causes sunken lesions (cankers) on the stem base, roots, and leaves, leading to wilting and plant death. Control measures include:

    *   **Cultural Practices:**
        *   Use certified disease-free seeds.
        *   Practice a long crop rotation (at least 3-4 years) with non-brassica crops to reduce pathogen inoculum in the soil.
        *   Remove and destroy all infected plant debris immediately after harvest.
        *   Ensure proper field sanitation and good drainage.
        *   Avoid overhead irrigation, which can splash spores and spread the disease.

    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   **Seed Treatment:**
            *   Treat seeds with **Thiram** (75% WP) at 2.5-3 g per kg of seed.
            *   Alternatively, treat seeds with **Carbendazim** (50% WP) at 2 g per kg of seed.
        *   **Foliar Spray/Soil Drench (if symptoms appear):**
            *   Spray with **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2.5 g per litre of water.
            *   Alternatively, spray with **Propiconazole** (25% EC) at 1 ml per litre of water.
            *   For systemic action, **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC) can be used at 0.5-1 ml per litre of water.

3.  **Gummosis:**
    This is not known to affect Cabbage. Gummosis is primarily a symptom observed in woody perennial plants, not herbaceous annuals like Cabbage.

4.  **Lichen:**
    This is not known to affect Cabbage. Lichens are symbiotic organisms that grow on surfaces like tree bark, rocks, or soil and are not parasitic to herbaceous plants like Cabbage. They do not cause disease or damage to Cabbage plants.
