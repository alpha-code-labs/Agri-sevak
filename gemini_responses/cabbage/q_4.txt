As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling wilting conditions in Cabbage in Haryana.

The primary wilting disease affecting Cabbage is **Fusarium Wilt**, caused by the fungus *Fusarium oxysporum* f. sp. *conglutinans*.

Regarding "Parawilt": This is not known to affect Cabbage as a specific disease entity. "Parawilt" is a term primarily used for a sudden wilting phenomenon in cotton, often associated with high temperatures and water stress, not a specific pathogen in Cabbage. However, sudden wilting in Cabbage can occur due to severe physiological stress (e.g., waterlogging, drought, heat stress, root damage) or other root diseases.

Here are the control measures for Fusarium Wilt in Cabbage:

**I. Cultural and Agronomic Practices (Most Effective for Fusarium Wilt):**

*   **Resistant Varieties:** Whenever possible, use cabbage varieties known to be resistant or tolerant to Fusarium wilt. Consult with local seed suppliers or HAU recommendations for suitable varieties in Haryana.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice a long crop rotation of at least 3-4 years with non-brassica crops (e.g., maize, wheat, pulses). Avoid planting cabbage or other brassicas in the same field repeatedly.
*   **Soil Solarization:** In hot summer months, cover the prepared field with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks. This helps to reduce soil-borne pathogen inoculum, including *Fusarium*.
*   **Proper Drainage:** Ensure good field drainage to prevent waterlogging, which can stress plants and favor disease development.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced fertilization. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can make plants more susceptible. Ensure adequate potassium and calcium.
*   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris and severely diseased plants from the field to reduce inoculum sources.
*   **Avoid Root Injury:** Minimize root damage during transplanting and intercultural operations, as wounds can provide entry points for the pathogen.

**II. Biological Control:**

*   **Bio-fungicides:**
    *   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds with *Trichoderma viride* or *Trichoderma harzianum* at 5-10 g/kg of seed before sowing.
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply *Trichoderma viride* or *Trichoderma harzianum* at 2.5 kg/acre mixed with 50-100 kg of farmyard manure (FYM) or compost, and incorporate into the soil before transplanting.

**III. Chemical Control (as preventive measures or early intervention):**

*   **Seed Treatment:**
    *   Treat seeds with **Carbendazim** at 2 g/kg of seed.
    *   Alternatively, treat seeds with **Thiram** at 2-3 g/kg of seed.
*   **Nursery Bed Drenching/Seedling Root Dip:**
    *   Before transplanting, drench the nursery beds or dip the roots of seedlings in a solution of **Carbendazim** at 1-2 g/L of water. This provides initial protection to the young plants.
*   **Soil Drench (Post-transplanting - limited efficacy once disease is established):**
    *   In areas with a history of severe wilt, a soil drench with **Carbendazim** at 1-2 g/L of water can be applied around the base of plants, preferably at the early stages of disease appearance. However, chemical control is generally less effective for established soil-borne wilt diseases.

**For sudden wilting due to physiological stress (not Fusarium Wilt):**

*   Ensure consistent and adequate irrigation, especially during dry periods.
*   Use mulching to conserve soil moisture and regulate soil temperature.
*   Protect plants from extreme heat stress if possible.
*   Avoid compaction of soil around the root zone.

By implementing these integrated management strategies, you can effectively control Fusarium Wilt and minimize wilting issues in your Cabbage crop.
