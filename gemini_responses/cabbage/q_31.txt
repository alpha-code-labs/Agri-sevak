As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I will address your concerns regarding physical damage in cabbage, clarifying the terminology for scientific accuracy. These issues are primarily physiological disorders influenced by environmental factors and cultural practices.

### 1. Head Splitting (referred to as "Fruit bursting")

This is a common physiological disorder in cabbage, where the mature head splits open. Cabbage forms a head, not a fruit.

*   **Causes:** Head splitting is primarily caused by rapid growth due to sudden availability of moisture (e.g., heavy rainfall or irrigation) after a dry spell, or fluctuations in temperature, especially when the heads are over-mature. The inner leaves grow faster than the outer leaves can expand, leading to internal pressure and splitting.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Maintain uniform soil moisture:** Ensure consistent irrigation, avoiding extremes of drought followed by heavy watering, especially during head development.
    *   **Timely harvesting:** Harvest heads promptly when they reach optimal maturity and firmness. Over-mature heads are more prone to splitting.
    *   **Select appropriate varieties:** Choose cabbage varieties known for their resistance to head splitting. Consult HAU recommendations for suitable varieties in Haryana.
    *   **Root pruning (as an emergency measure):** In cases where heads are nearing maturity and heavy rain is anticipated, a spade can be used to cut some roots on one side of the plant, about 10-15 cm from the stem. This reduces water uptake and can delay splitting.
    *   No specific chemical control is available for head splitting.

### 2. Leaf Scorch/Sunburn (referred to as "Leaf burning/melting")

This condition refers to damage to cabbage leaves due to environmental stress.

*   **Causes:** Leaf scorch occurs when cabbage leaves are exposed to excessive heat and intense sunlight, often combined with water stress. High temperatures can damage leaf tissues, leading to browning, drying, and in severe cases, a "melting" or collapse of the tissue. It can also be exacerbated by nutrient imbalances or improper pesticide application during hot weather.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Adequate and consistent irrigation:** Ensure plants receive sufficient water, especially during hot periods, to prevent water stress.
    *   **Proper plant spacing:** Maintain recommended plant spacing to allow for good canopy development, which can provide some self-shading to lower leaves.
    *   **Mulching:** Apply organic mulch (e.g., straw, crop residues) around the base of plants to help keep the soil cool and retain moisture.
    *   **Avoid spraying during peak heat:** Do not apply pesticides or foliar fertilizers during the hottest part of the day, as this can increase the risk of phytotoxicity and leaf burn.
    *   **Balanced nutrition:** Ensure plants have access to balanced nutrients, as deficiencies can make plants more susceptible to stress.
    *   No specific chemical control is available for leaf scorch/sunburn. Management focuses on cultural practices.

### 3. Excessive Hardness or Woody Texture in the Head (referred to as "Hardness in fruit")

Cabbage heads are naturally firm. However, "excessive hardness" or a woody texture, particularly in the core, can be a quality issue. Cabbage forms a head, not a fruit.

*   **Causes:** This condition is often associated with:
    *   **Over-maturity:** Heads left too long in the field become very dense and can develop a tough, fibrous core.
    *   **Variety characteristics:** Some varieties naturally produce firmer heads than others.
    *   **Environmental stress:** Prolonged drought or high temperatures during head formation can sometimes lead to tougher tissues.
    *   **Bolting:** Premature flowering (bolting) can cause the central stem to elongate and become woody, affecting head quality.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Timely harvesting:** Harvest heads at their optimum maturity when they are firm but before they become excessively dense or show signs of over-maturity.
    *   **Select suitable varieties:** Choose varieties known for good texture and quality, suitable for the local climate and market preference.
    *   **Maintain optimal growing conditions:** Provide consistent water and balanced nutrition throughout the growing season to promote healthy head development.
    *   **Manage bolting:** Select heat-tolerant varieties for warmer seasons and avoid planting too early in cold conditions, which can induce bolting.
    *   No specific chemical control is available for managing head hardness or woody texture. It is primarily managed through variety selection and cultural practices.
