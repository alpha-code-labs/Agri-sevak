As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for weed control in Cabbage in Haryana.

First, let's address the specific weeds mentioned:

*   **Amarbail (Cuscuta spp.):** Amarbail (dodder) is not a common or significant parasitic weed of Cabbage in Haryana. Therefore, specific chemical control measures are generally not required or recommended for this crop.
*   **Orobanche (Orobanche spp.):** Orobanche (Broomrape) is a parasitic weed primarily affecting solanaceous crops (like tomato, brinjal, potato) and some oilseeds (like mustard, sunflower). This is not known to affect Cabbage.

For the other weeds (Broad leaf weeds, Narrow leaf weeds, Bathu, Congress grass, and Phalaris minor), effective management strategies are crucial for optimal Cabbage yield.

**Integrated Weed Management (IWM) in Cabbage:**

An integrated approach combining cultural, mechanical, and chemical methods is most effective for weed control.

**A. Cultural and Mechanical Methods:**

1.  **Land Preparation:** Thorough ploughing and harrowing before transplanting help to reduce the initial weed seed bank in the soil.
2.  **Healthy Seedlings:** Use healthy, vigorous, and weed-free Cabbage seedlings for transplanting.
3.  **Proper Spacing:** Maintain recommended plant spacing to allow for canopy closure, which can suppress late-emerging weeds by shading.
4.  **Hand Weeding/Inter-cultivation:** This is highly effective, especially during the critical period of weed competition (first 30-45 days after transplanting).
    *   Perform the first hand weeding or inter-cultivation around 20-25 days after transplanting.
    *   A second hand weeding or inter-cultivation may be required around 40-45 days after transplanting, depending on weed pressure.
5.  **Mulching:** Using organic mulches (e.g., straw, crop residues) can effectively suppress weed growth, conserve soil moisture, and regulate soil temperature.

**B. Chemical Weed Control:**

Chemical control should be used judiciously and as part of an IWM strategy. Always ensure proper application techniques and safety precautions.

**1. Pre-emergence Application (within 3 days of transplanting):**
This application targets germinating broadleaf and narrowleaf weeds before they emerge.

*   **For broad-spectrum control of annual grasses and broadleaf weeds:**
    *   Apply **Pendimethalin** 30% EC at 1.3 - 1.5 L/acre.
    *   Mix the recommended quantity of herbicide in 200-250 L of water and spray evenly on the moist soil surface within 3 days of transplanting Cabbage seedlings. Ensure good soil moisture for optimal efficacy.

**2. Post-emergence Application (for specific weed types):**
These herbicides are primarily effective against grassy weeds and should be applied when weeds are actively growing.

*   **For control of narrowleaf weeds (grassy weeds like Phalaris minor):**
    *   Apply **Quizalofop-ethyl** 5% EC at 400 - 500 ml/acre.
    *   OR
    *   Apply **Fluazifop-P-butyl** 13.4% EC at 400 - 500 ml/acre.
    *   Mix the recommended quantity of herbicide in 200-250 L of water and spray when grassy weeds are at the 2-4 leaf stage (typically 20-30 days after transplanting). Ensure thorough coverage of the weeds.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the herbicide label for dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval.
*   Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of herbicides.
*   Ensure proper calibration of spray equipment for uniform application and to avoid over or under-dosing.
*   Avoid spraying on windy days to prevent herbicide drift to non-target crops or areas.
*   Rotate herbicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of herbicide resistance in weeds.
