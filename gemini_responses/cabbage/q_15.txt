As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Cabbage in Haryana:

### Control Measures for Pests in Cabbage

#### 1. Grasshopper

Grasshoppers can cause significant defoliation in cabbage.

*   **Mechanical Control:** For small infestations, hand-picking and destroying grasshoppers can be effective, especially in the early morning or late evening when they are less active.
*   **Chemical Control:** In case of severe infestation, apply insecticides.
    *   **Malathion 50 EC** at 2-3 ml per litre of water (or 1.0-1.5 litres per acre).
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5 EC** at 0.5 ml per litre of water.

#### 2. Painted Bug (Bagrada hilaris)

The painted bug is a serious pest of cruciferous crops like cabbage, causing damage by sucking sap from leaves and tender shoots, leading to wilting and stunted growth.

*   **Cultural Control:** Maintain field sanitation by removing cruciferous weeds (e.g., wild mustard, radish) from the field and surrounding areas, as these can serve as alternate hosts.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Dimethoate 30 EC** at 1.0-1.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8 SL** at 0.25-0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25 WG** at 0.2 g per litre of water.

#### 3. Red Cotton Bug (Dysdercus cingulatus)

This is not known to affect Cabbage. The red cotton bug is primarily a pest of cotton and other plants belonging to the Malvaceae family.

#### 4. Black Ants

Black ants are generally not direct pests of cabbage by feeding on the plant. However, they can be problematic if they are "farming" other sucking pests like aphids or mealybugs for their honeydew, thereby protecting these pests from natural enemies and exacerbating the infestation. They can also occasionally damage roots if nests are built too close to the plants.

*   **Cultural Control:** Keep the field clean and free of debris that can provide shelter for ant nests.
*   **Integrated Control:** If ants are present due to aphid or mealybug infestations, controlling the primary sucking pest will often reduce ant activity.
*   **Chemical Control (for direct ant control if problematic):**
    *   For drenching ant nests or around the base of affected plants, use **Chlorpyrifos 20 EC** at 2-3 ml per litre of water.
    *   Alternatively, **Fipronil 0.3 GR** can be applied as a spot treatment or broadcast at 5-10 kg per acre, targeting ant trails or nests.

Always ensure thorough coverage during spray applications and adhere to the recommended pre-harvest intervals (PHI) for each chemical. It is advisable to rotate insecticides to prevent the development of resistance.
