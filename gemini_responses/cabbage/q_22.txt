As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), here are the recommended cultivation practices for Cabbage in Haryana:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   Cabbage is primarily grown by transplanting seedlings. Seeds are first sown in a well-prepared nursery bed.
    *   The nursery beds should be raised, approximately 15 cm high, 1 meter wide, and of convenient length.
    *   Seeds are sown thinly in lines 5-7 cm apart, or broadcast evenly, and then lightly covered with a thin layer of soil or sand.
    *   Seedlings are ready for transplanting to the main field when they are 4-6 weeks old and have 4-5 true leaves.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   **Nursery Sowing:** Seeds should be sown shallowly, about 0.5-1.0 cm deep.
    *   **Transplanting:** Seedlings should be planted to the same depth they were growing in the nursery, ensuring the root ball is adequately covered with soil. Avoid planting too deep or too shallow.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   Optimal spacing is crucial for proper head development and yield.
    *   **Row to Row:** 45-60 cm
    *   **Plant to Plant:** 30-45 cm
    *   Closer spacing (e.g., 45 cm x 30 cm) can result in smaller heads but potentially higher total yield, while wider spacing (e.g., 60 cm x 45 cm) leads to larger heads.

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   For raising seedlings sufficient to plant one acre of land, the recommended seed dose is **200-250 grams per acre**.
