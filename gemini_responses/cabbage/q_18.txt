As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the use of growth regulators and Boron in Cabbage cultivation in Haryana:

1.  **Ethephon (Ethrel):**
    This is not known to be recommended as a growth regulator for enhancing head formation or yield in Cabbage. Its primary uses in other crops relate to fruit ripening, flowering, or abscission, which are not relevant for Cabbage head production. Applying **Ethephon** to Cabbage for head development is not a standard practice and may lead to undesirable effects.

2.  **2,4-D:**
    This is not known to affect Cabbage beneficially as a growth regulator. **2,4-D** is a potent broadleaf herbicide and even at very low concentrations, it can cause severe phytotoxicity, deformities, and yield loss in Cabbage. Its use as a growth regulator in Cabbage is strictly discouraged.

3.  **Boron:**
    Boron is an essential micronutrient for Cabbage. Deficiency can lead to hollow stem, internal browning, and poor head formation. Its application is highly recommended if soil tests indicate low boron levels or if deficiency symptoms are observed.

    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Apply 1-2 g/L of **Borax (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate)** (containing 10.5% Boron) or 0.5-1 g/L of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (containing 20% Boron) in 200 litres of water per acre.
        *   Apply at the head initiation stage and repeat after 15-20 days if deficiency persists or soil boron levels are very low.
    *   **Soil Application (Basal):**
        *   If soil tests indicate severe boron deficiency, apply 4-6 kg/acre of **Borax (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate)** as a basal application before transplanting. This should be mixed thoroughly with the soil.
