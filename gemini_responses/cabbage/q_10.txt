As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach for effective and sustainable control of borers, caterpillars, Diamondback moth, and leaf folders in Cabbage. This involves a combination of cultural, biological, and chemical methods.

**General Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Recommendations:**

*   **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your cabbage fields for pest presence, egg masses, and larval damage. Early detection is key.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy crop residues, weeds, and volunteer plants that can harbor pests.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate cabbage with non-cruciferous crops to break pest life cycles.
*   **Biological Control:** Encourage natural enemies like parasitic wasps and predatory insects.
*   **Pheromone Traps:** Use pheromone traps for monitoring and mass trapping of adult moths, especially for *Spodoptera litura* (Tobacco Caterpillar).
*   **Resistant Varieties:** If available and suitable for Haryana conditions, consider using pest-tolerant varieties.

**Specific Control Measures (CIBRC Approved Chemicals):**

When pest populations exceed economic thresholds, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance, especially for Diamondback Moth.

### 1. Borers (e.g., Cabbage Webworm) and Leaf Folder

These pests bore into stems, heads, or fold leaves and feed within.

*   **Biological:**
    *   **Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki (Bt)**: 1-2 kg/acre (or 1-2 g/L of water). Apply in the evening for best results.
*   **Chemical (Systemic/Contact Insecticides):**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC**: 60 ml/acre.
    *   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG**: 80-100 g/acre.
    *   **Flubendiamide 20% WG**: 50 g/acre.
    *   **Indoxacarb 14.5% SC**: 200 ml/acre.
    *   **Lufenuron 5.4% EC**: 240-300 ml/acre.

### 2. Caterpillars (General, e.g., Cabbage Butterfly, Tobacco Caterpillar)

This category includes various lepidopteran larvae that feed on cabbage leaves.

*   **Biological:**
    *   **Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki (Bt)**: 1-2 kg/acre (or 1-2 g/L of water).
*   **Chemical (Larvicides):**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC**: 60 ml/acre.
    *   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG**: 80-100 g/acre.
    *   **Flubendiamide 20% WG**: 50 g/acre.
    *   **Indoxacarb 14.5% SC**: 200 ml/acre.
    *   **Lufenuron 5.4% EC**: 240-300 ml/acre.
    *   **Novaluron 10% EC**: 300 ml/acre.
    *   **Spinetoram 11.7% SC**: 160-180 ml/acre.

### 3. Diamondback Moth (*Plutella xylostella*)

This is a highly destructive pest known for developing resistance quickly. **Rotation of insecticides with different modes of action is critical.**

*   **Biological:**
    *   **Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki (Bt)**: 1-2 kg/acre (or 1-2 g/L of water).
*   **Chemical (Larvicides - Rotate these compounds):**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC**: 60 ml/acre.
    *   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG**: 80-100 g/acre.
    *   **Flubendiamide 20% WG**: 50 g/acre.
    *   **Indoxacarb 14.5% SC**: 200 ml/acre.
    *   **Lufenuron 5.4% EC**: 240-300 ml/acre.
    *   **Novaluron 10% EC**: 300 ml/acre.
    *   **Spinetoram 11.7% SC**: 160-180 ml/acre.
    *   **Cyantraniliprole 10.26% OD**: 180 ml/acre.

**Important Considerations for Chemical Application:**

*   **Water Volume:** Ensure thorough coverage by using an adequate spray volume, typically 200-250 litres of water per acre.
*   **Timing:** Spray during the cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always observe the specified pre-harvest interval on the product label to ensure food safety.
*   **Safety:** Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying.
*   **Label Instructions:** Always read and strictly follow the instructions, precautions, and dosage recommendations provided on the insecticide product label.

By implementing these scientifically verified strategies, you can effectively manage these pests and ensure a healthy cabbage crop.
