As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding Cabbage maturity, harvesting, and cutting processes:

**Maturity Signs for Cabbage:**

*   **Head Firmness:** The primary indicator of maturity is the firmness and compactness of the head. A mature cabbage head will feel solid and dense when gently squeezed. Immature heads will feel loose and spongy.
*   **Head Size:** The head should reach the characteristic size and weight for the specific variety being grown.
*   **Color:** The head should exhibit a uniform, characteristic color (green, red, or purple, depending on the variety).
*   **Outer Leaves:** The outer wrapper leaves may start to show slight yellowing or curling, but the head itself should remain fresh and vibrant.
*   **Time to Maturity:** While not a direct sign, most varieties mature within 60-120 days after transplanting, depending on the variety (early, mid, or late season).

**Harvesting Time for Cabbage:**

*   **Optimal Stage:** Harvest when the heads are fully developed, firm, and compact, but *before* they begin to split or bolt (send up a flower stalk). Over-mature heads are prone to splitting, especially after rain or irrigation.
*   **Timing of Day:** Harvesting is best done in the early morning after the dew has dried, or in the late afternoon. This helps in maintaining freshness and reducing field heat.
*   **Yield:** Depending on the variety and cultivation practices, a good yield in Haryana can range from 20,000 to 30,000 kg per acre.

**Cutting Process for Cabbage:**

*   **Tools:** Use a sharp, clean knife or a specialized harvesting tool.
*   **Cutting Point:** Cut the stem just below the head, ensuring a clean cut.
*   **Wrapper Leaves:** Leave 2-4 healthy wrapper leaves attached to the head. These leaves protect the head from physical damage and dehydration during handling and transport.
*   **Trimming:** Remove any diseased, damaged, or excessively loose outer leaves before packing.
*   **Post-Harvest:** After cutting, the heads should be handled carefully to avoid bruising and immediately moved to a cool, shaded area to reduce field heat and extend shelf life.
