Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding Scale insects and Mealybugs in Cabbage. Both are sucking pests that can significantly impact crop health and yield if not managed effectively. Here's a scientifically verified approach for their control:

It is crucial to adopt an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods for sustainable control.

### General Management Principles for Sucking Pests:

1.  **Regular Scouting:** Regularly inspect your cabbage fields, especially the undersides of leaves and leaf axils, for early signs of pest infestation. Early detection is key to effective control.
2.  **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infested plant debris and weeds, which can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
3.  **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation to break the pest cycle.
4.  **Balanced Nutrition:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush growth that is more attractive to sucking pests.

### Control of Mealybugs in Cabbage

Mealybugs are common pests of cabbage, often found in protected areas like leaf axils and under loose leaves.

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   **Water Spray:** For small infestations, a strong jet of water can dislodge mealybugs from plants.
*   **Manual Removal:** Hand-pick and destroy heavily infested leaves or plants, especially in early stages.
*   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy heavily infested plant parts.

**2. Biological Control:**
*   Encourage natural enemies such as ladybird beetles (e.g., *Cryptolaemus montrouzieri*), lacewings, and parasitic wasps (e.g., *Anagyrus lopezi*). Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

**3. Chemical Control (as a last resort, when infestation is severe):**
When chemical intervention is necessary, ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and in leaf axils where mealybugs hide. Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

*   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply 500-600 ml per acre (or 1.0-1.2 ml per litre of water). This is an insect growth regulator, effective against nymphs.
*   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:** Apply 200-250 ml per acre (or 0.4-0.5 ml per litre of water). This is a systemic insecticide that moves both upwards and downwards in the plant.
*   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply 100 g per acre (or 0.2 g per litre of water). This is a systemic neonicotinoid insecticide.
*   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply 50-100 g per acre (or 0.1-0.2 g per litre of water). This is another systemic neonicotinoid insecticide.
*   **Pyriproxyfen 10% EC:** Apply 500 ml per acre (or 1.0 ml per litre of water). This is a juvenile hormone mimic, effective against nymphs and preventing adult emergence.

### Control of Scale Insects in Cabbage

While less common than mealybugs, scale insects can occasionally infest cabbage. Their control strategies are similar to those for mealybugs due to their sucking nature.

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   **Manual Removal:** For localized infestations, gently scrape off scale insects with a soft brush or cloth.
*   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy heavily infested leaves or plants.

**2. Biological Control:**
*   Natural enemies like parasitic wasps and predatory beetles can help manage scale insect populations.

**3. Chemical Control (when necessary):**
Chemical control is most effective against the crawler stage (young, mobile nymphs) of scale insects. Systemic insecticides are generally preferred as they are absorbed by the plant and ingested by the feeding scales.

The same systemic insecticides recommended for mealybugs are generally effective against scale insects, particularly their crawler and early nymphal stages. Ensure thorough spray coverage.

*   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply 500-600 ml per acre (or 1.0-1.2 ml per litre of water).
*   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:** Apply 200-250 ml per acre (or 0.4-0.5 ml per litre of water).
*   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply 100 g per acre (or 0.2 g per litre of water).
*   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply 50-100 g per acre (or 0.1-0.2 g per litre of water).
*   **Pyriproxyfen 10% EC:** Apply 500 ml per acre (or 1.0 ml per litre of water).

### Important Considerations:

*   **Water Volume:** Always use an adequate volume of water (typically 400-500 litres per acre for cabbage) to ensure proper spray coverage.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) while handling and applying pesticides.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Strictly observe the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) mentioned on the pesticide label to ensure the safety of the produce.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance in pest populations.
