Mites, including Red spider mite (*Tetranychus urticae*) and various Rust mites (Eriophyid mites), are known to affect Cabbage, causing damage by sucking sap from the leaves, leading to bronzing, yellowing, and reduced plant vigour.

For effective control of mites in Cabbage, consider the following scientifically verified recommendations:

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Approach:**
*   **Scouting:** Regularly inspect the underside of leaves for mites, especially during dry and warm weather. Look for fine webbing (spider mites) or bronzing/rusting of leaves (rust mites).
*   **Water Management:** Ensure proper irrigation. Water stress can make plants more susceptible to mite infestations. Overhead irrigation can sometimes help wash off mites.

**Chemical Control (Acaricides):**
When mite populations are high and causing economic damage, chemical control is necessary. Rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development. Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the underside of leaves where mites reside.

Apply any of the following CIBRC approved technical chemicals:

*   **Spiromesifen** (e.g., 22.9% SC formulation): Apply at 0.6 - 0.75 ml per litre of water, or 120 - 150 ml per acre.
*   **Fenpyroximate** (e.g., 5% SC formulation): Apply at 1.25 - 1.5 ml per litre of water, or 250 - 300 ml per acre.
*   **Propargite** (e.g., 57% EC formulation): Apply at 5 - 7.5 ml per litre of water, or 1.0 - 1.5 litres per acre.
*   **Abamectin** (e.g., 1.9% EC formulation): Apply at 0.75 - 1 ml per litre of water, or 150 - 200 ml per acre.
*   **Wettable Sulphur** (e.g., 80% WP formulation): Apply at 10 - 15 g per litre of water, or 2 - 3 kg per acre. This is particularly effective against rust mites and can be used in early stages or as part of a rotation.
*   **Pyridaben** (e.g., 10% WP formulation): Apply at 1.25 - 1.5 g per litre of water, or 250 - 300 g per acre.
*   **Fenazaquin** (e.g., 10% EC formulation): Apply at 1.25 - 1.5 ml per litre of water, or 250 - 300 ml per acre.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the label instructions for the specific product being used, including pre-harvest intervals (PHI) and safety precautions.
*   Use sufficient water volume (typically 200 litres per acre for ground sprays) to ensure complete coverage of the foliage.
*   Repeat application may be necessary after 7-10 days if the infestation persists, using a different group of acaricide to manage resistance.
*   Consider the use of sticky traps or yellow pan traps for monitoring adult mites, though visual inspection is primary for these pests.
