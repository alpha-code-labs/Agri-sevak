As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I emphasize the critical role of micronutrients for optimal growth, yield, and quality of Cabbage in Haryana. Deficiencies can significantly impact crop health and economic returns. Always confirm deficiencies through soil and plant tissue analysis before applying corrective measures.

Here's how to address specific micronutrient deficiencies in Cabbage:

### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

Zinc deficiency leads to stunted growth, small and narrow leaves (little leaf), and interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves.

*   **Foliar Application:**
    *   Spray **Zinc sulfate heptahydrate** (21% Zn) @ 2.5-5 g/L of water.
    *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, starting 20-30 days after transplanting or at the first sign of deficiency.
*   **Soil Application:**
    *   If soil test indicates severe deficiency, apply **Zinc sulfate heptahydrate** (21% Zn) @ 10-25 kg/acre as a basal application before transplanting.

### 2. Iron (Fe) Deficiency

Iron deficiency causes distinct interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on the youngest leaves, while veins remain green. In severe cases, the entire leaf may turn yellow or white.

*   **Foliar Application (Preferred):**
    *   Spray **Ferrous sulfate heptahydrate** (19% Fe) @ 5 g/L of water.
    *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, targeting the young, affected leaves.
*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Soil application of iron is generally less effective due to rapid fixation in alkaline soils common in Haryana. Foliar application is preferred for quick correction.

### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

Boron deficiency is particularly critical for Cabbage, leading to "hollow stem," internal browning of the head, stunted growth, and malformed or small heads.

*   **Foliar Application:**
    *   Spray **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (20% B) @ 1-1.5 g/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, spray **Sodium tetraborate decahydrate** (Borax, 10.5% B) @ 2-3 g/L of water.
    *   Apply at the head initiation stage and repeat if symptoms persist.
*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Sodium tetraborate decahydrate** (Borax, 10.5% B) @ 4-6 kg/acre as a basal application, especially in sandy soils or where deficiency is a known issue.

### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

Calcium deficiency often manifests as "tip burn" in Cabbage, where the margins of the inner wrapper leaves or head leaves turn brown or black, leading to decay.

*   **Foliar Application:**
    *   Spray **Calcium chloride** (77% Ca) @ 5 g/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, spray **Calcium nitrate** (19% Ca) @ 5-10 g/L of water.
    *   Start spraying from the head formation stage, applying 2-3 sprays at 7-10 day intervals to prevent tip burn. Ensure good coverage of the developing head.

### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

Magnesium deficiency typically appears on older leaves first, causing interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) with veins remaining green. In severe cases, leaves may develop a purplish or reddish tint.

*   **Foliar Application:**
    *   Spray **Magnesium sulfate heptahydrate** (9.6% Mg) @ 5 g/L of water.
    *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, targeting the affected older leaves.
*   **Soil Application:**
    *   If soil test indicates deficiency, apply **Magnesium sulfate heptahydrate** (9.6% Mg) @ 10-20 kg/acre as a basal application.

### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

Manganese deficiency causes interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, similar to iron, but often with small necrotic (dead) spots appearing later. Growth may be stunted.

*   **Foliar Application (Preferred):**
    *   Spray **Manganese sulfate monohydrate** (30.5% Mn) @ 2.5-5 g/L of water.
    *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, targeting the young, affected leaves.
*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Soil application of manganese is generally less effective due to rapid fixation in alkaline soils. Foliar application is preferred for quick correction.

### General Recommendations:

*   **Soil Testing:** Regular soil testing is paramount to identify existing deficiencies and guide nutrient management plans.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management:** Combine soil and foliar applications as needed, along with proper organic matter management, to maintain soil health and nutrient availability.
*   **pH Management:** Soil pH significantly affects micronutrient availability. Maintain an optimal soil pH range (typically 6.0-7.0 for Cabbage) for better nutrient uptake.
*   **Adjuvants:** Always use a good quality spreading agent/sticker with foliar sprays to ensure better absorption and efficacy.
*   **Timing:** Apply foliar sprays during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to avoid scorching and improve absorption.
