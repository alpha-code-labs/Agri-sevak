Namaste, Kisan Bhaiyon! As a Senior Agronomist from Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I am here to provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies in your Cabbage crop. These pests can cause significant damage if not managed effectively.

Here's how you can control them:

### 1. Control of Beetles (e.g., Flea Beetles)

Flea beetles are common pests of cabbage, especially during the seedling stage, causing numerous small holes in the leaves, which can stunt growth.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Ensure good field sanitation and remove weeds that can host these pests.
    *   Planting healthy, vigorous seedlings can help them tolerate some damage.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   For seed treatment to protect young seedlings:
        *   **Imidacloprid** 600 FS at 5-7 ml per kg of seed.
        *   **Thiamethoxam** 70 WS at 3-5 g per kg of seed.
    *   For foliar spray when damage is observed:
        *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL at 0.5-1 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG at 0.2-0.4 g per litre of water.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 0.5-1 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Cypermethrin** 25% EC at 0.5-1 ml per litre of water.

### 2. Control of Weevils (e.g., Cabbage Stem Weevil, Turnip Gall Weevil)

Weevils can cause damage by boring into stems, petioles, or roots, leading to galls, wilting, and stunted growth. Adults feed on leaves.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Practice crop rotation to break the pest cycle.
    *   Remove and destroy infested plant residues after harvest.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Control is challenging once larvae are inside the plant. Focus on preventing adult egg-laying and targeting early larval stages.
    *   For foliar spray targeting adult weevils:
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 0.5-1 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 2-2.5 ml per litre of water (can be used as a soil drench around the base of plants if stem/root infestation is suspected, following label recommendations).
    *   Seed treatment with **Imidacloprid** or **Thiamethoxam** (as mentioned for beetles) can offer some early protection against feeding adults.

### 3. Control of Sawflies (e.g., Cabbage Sawfly)

Cabbage sawfly larvae are voracious feeders, causing defoliation by eating holes in leaves, especially in young plants.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Regular monitoring and hand-picking of larvae in small areas can be effective.
    *   Maintain field hygiene.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   When infestation is significant:
        *   **Malathion** 50% EC at 1.5-2 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Quinalphos** 25% EC at 2 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 2-2.5 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 0.5-1 ml per litre of water.

**Important Considerations for all Pest Control:**

*   **Integrated Pest Management (IPM):** Always combine cultural practices with chemical control for sustainable pest management.
*   **Timely Application:** Apply pesticides at the right time, preferably in the morning or evening, and ensure thorough coverage.
*   **Safety Precautions:** Always wear protective clothing (gloves, mask, goggles) while handling and spraying pesticides. Follow the instructions on the product label carefully.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate different classes of insecticides to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Observe the recommended pre-harvest interval for each chemical to ensure the safety of the produce.
