As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide scientifically verified advice on addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies in Cabbage for Haryana.

Addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium/Potash) in Cabbage is crucial for healthy growth and good head formation. The most accurate way to determine specific nutrient needs is through a **soil test** conducted before planting. This will provide precise recommendations for your field.

However, based on general observations and common deficiencies in Haryana, here's how to address N, P, and K deficiencies:

### General Recommendation:
*   **Always conduct a soil test** before planting to determine the exact nutrient status of your soil and get precise recommendations. This will prevent over-application and ensure efficient nutrient use.

### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   General yellowing of older leaves, starting from the tips and moving inwards.
*   Stunted plant growth and reduced leaf size.
*   Pale green to yellowish overall plant appearance.
*   Small, loose heads.

**Addressing Deficiency:**
Nitrogen is highly mobile in the soil, so split applications are often recommended.
*   **Basal Application (at planting):**
    *   Apply 25-30 kg of Nitrogen per acre using fertilizers like:
        *   **Urea** (approx. 55-65 kg/acre)
        *   **Diammonium phosphate (DAP)** (provides N and P, adjust other N sources accordingly)
        *   **Ammonium sulfate** (approx. 125-150 kg/acre)
*   **Top-dressing (20-30 days after transplanting and again 40-50 days after transplanting):**
    *   Apply 25-30 kg of Nitrogen per acre per application using:
        *   **Urea** (approx. 55-65 kg/acre)
        *   **Calcium nitrate** (approx. 150-190 kg/acre)
*   **Foliar Application (for quick correction of mild deficiency):**
    *   Spray 1-2% solution of **Urea** (10-20 g/L of water) or **Potassium nitrate** (5-10 g/L of water, also provides K) at weekly intervals until symptoms disappear. Ensure good coverage.

### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   Stunted growth, especially root development.
*   Leaves may turn dark green, sometimes with a purplish tint on the underside, particularly on older leaves.
*   Delayed maturity and poor head formation.

**Addressing Deficiency:**
Phosphorus is relatively immobile in the soil, so it's best applied basally.
*   **Basal Application (at planting):**
    *   Apply 25-30 kg of Phosphorus (P2O5) per acre using fertilizers like:
        *   **Single superphosphate (SSP)** (approx. 150-190 kg/acre)
        *   **Diammonium phosphate (DAP)** (approx. 55-65 kg/acre, also provides N)
        *   **Triple superphosphate (TSP)** (approx. 55-65 kg/acre)
*   **Note:** Foliar application of phosphorus is generally less effective for correcting severe deficiencies due to poor absorption.

### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   Yellowing and scorching (browning) of leaf margins, especially on older leaves.
*   Leaves may appear dull and bluish-green.
*   Weak stems and poor head development, leading to loose or small heads.
*   Increased susceptibility to diseases.

**Addressing Deficiency:**
Potassium can be applied basally and as top-dressing.
*   **Basal Application (at planting):**
    *   Apply 25-30 kg of Potassium (K2O) per acre using fertilizers like:
        *   **Muriate of potash (MOP)** / **Potassium chloride** (approx. 40-50 kg/acre)
        *   **Sulfate of potash (SOP)** / **Potassium sulfate** (approx. 50-60 kg/acre)
*   **Top-dressing (30-40 days after transplanting, if soil test indicates high requirement):**
    *   Apply 15-20 kg of Potassium (K2O) per acre using:
        *   **Muriate of potash (MOP)** / **Potassium chloride** (approx. 25-35 kg/acre)
        *   **Sulfate of potash (SOP)** / **Potassium sulfate** (approx. 30-40 kg/acre)
*   **Foliar Application (for quick correction of mild deficiency):**
    *   Spray 1% solution of **Potassium nitrate** (10 g/L of water) or **Sulfate of potash (SOP)** (10 g/L of water) at weekly intervals.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Timing:** Apply fertilizers at the right growth stages for maximum uptake and efficiency.
*   **Irrigation:** Ensure adequate moisture in the soil after fertilizer application to facilitate nutrient dissolution and uptake.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management:** Combine chemical fertilizers with organic manures (Farm Yard Manure, compost) to improve soil health and nutrient availability over the long term.

Always refer to the specific recommendations from your soil test report for the most accurate and efficient nutrient management plan for your Cabbage crop.
