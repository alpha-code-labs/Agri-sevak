As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm the following regarding rust diseases in Cabbage:

Black rust, Brown rust, Yellow rust, and Red rust are primarily diseases of cereals and other specific crops. **These are not known to affect Cabbage.**

However, **White Rust** is a common and significant disease of Cabbage and other cruciferous crops, caused by the oomycete *Albugo candida*. Here's how to control it:

**Control Measures for White Rust (*Albugo candida*) in Cabbage:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting cabbage or other cruciferous crops in the same field for at least 2-3 years.
    *   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest to reduce inoculum.
    *   **Weed Management:** Control cruciferous weeds in and around the field, as they can act as alternate hosts.
    *   **Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to improve air circulation and reduce humidity within the canopy.
    *   **Irrigation:** Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day, to minimize leaf wetness duration.
    *   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available and suitable for local conditions, choose resistant or tolerant cabbage varieties.

2.  **Chemical Control:**
    Apply fungicides preventively or at the first sign of disease symptoms. Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.

    *   **Mancozeb:** Apply at a rate of 2-2.5 kg/acre (or 2-2.5 g/L of water for foliar spray).
    *   **Metalaxyl + Mancozeb:** Apply at a rate of 2-2.5 kg/acre (or 2-2.5 g/L of water for foliar spray).
    *   **Cymoxanil + Mancozeb:** Apply at a rate of 1.5-2 kg/acre (or 1.5-2 g/L of water for foliar spray).
    *   **Propineb:** Apply at a rate of 2-2.5 kg/acre (or 2-2.5 g/L of water for foliar spray).

    Always follow the manufacturer's instructions regarding dosage, spray interval, and pre-harvest interval (PHI) for safe and effective use. Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
