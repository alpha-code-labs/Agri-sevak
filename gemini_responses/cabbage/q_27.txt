As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the suitable climate, soil type, and drainage requirements for cabbage cultivation in Haryana:

**Climate:**
*   Cabbage is a cool-season crop and thrives in moderate temperatures.
*   The optimum temperature range for vegetative growth and head formation is between 15°C and 20°C.
*   Temperatures below 5°C can stunt growth, while prolonged exposure to temperatures above 25°C can lead to loose heads, premature bolting (flowering), and reduced quality.
*   In Haryana, this makes it an ideal crop for the Rabi season (winter months), typically planted from September to November for harvest during winter and early spring.

**Soil Type:**
*   Cabbage prefers well-drained, fertile, sandy loam to clay loam soils.
*   The soil should be rich in organic matter to ensure good water retention and nutrient availability.
*   An ideal soil pH range for cabbage cultivation is between 6.0 and 7.0 (slightly acidic to neutral). While it can tolerate a slightly wider range (5.5 to 7.5), maintaining the optimal pH is crucial for nutrient uptake.

**Drainage Requirement:**
*   Cabbage requires excellent drainage. It is highly sensitive to waterlogging.
*   Poor drainage or waterlogged conditions can lead to root rot, nutrient deficiencies, stunted growth, and significantly reduced yield and quality.
*   In areas with heavy soils or a high water table, cultivation on raised beds is strongly recommended to ensure adequate drainage and aeration around the root zone.
