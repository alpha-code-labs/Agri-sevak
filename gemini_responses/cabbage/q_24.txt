As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following for ideal cabbage transplantation in Haryana:

### Ideal Transplantation Time

Cabbage is a cool-season crop. For optimal growth and head formation in Haryana, the ideal transplantation period is:

*   **Main Season:** Late September to November. This allows the crop to mature during the cooler winter months.
*   **Early Varieties:** Can be transplanted from late August to early September.
*   **Late Varieties:** Can be extended up to December in areas with milder winters.

### Ideal Transplantation Distance

The spacing depends on the variety (early, mid, late) and the desired head size. General recommendations are:

*   **Row-to-Row Distance:** 45 cm to 60 cm
*   **Plant-to-Plant Distance:** 30 cm to 45 cm

A common and effective spacing for most varieties is **45 cm (row-to-row) x 30 cm (plant-to-plant)**. For larger varieties or if larger heads are desired, increase spacing to **60 cm x 45 cm**.

### Ideal Transplantation Process

1.  **Seedling Age:** Transplant seedlings when they are 4-6 weeks old, or when they have developed 4-6 true leaves and are about 10-15 cm tall.
2.  **Hardening Off:** Before transplanting, harden off the seedlings for 7-10 days. This involves gradually exposing them to outdoor conditions (reduced watering, increased sunlight) to make them more resilient to transplant shock.
3.  **Field Preparation:** Prepare the field thoroughly by ploughing, harrowing, and levelling. Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost. Ensure good drainage. Raised beds can be beneficial, especially in areas prone to waterlogging.
4.  **Timing of Transplant:** Transplant seedlings preferably in the late afternoon or evening, or on a cloudy day. This reduces the stress on the young plants from direct sunlight and high temperatures.
5.  **Method:**
    *   Make small holes at the recommended spacing.
    *   Gently remove seedlings from the nursery bed or trays, ensuring minimal damage to the root system.
    *   Plant the seedlings at the same depth they were growing in the nursery. Avoid planting too deep or too shallow.
    *   Firm the soil gently around the base of each seedling to ensure good root-to-soil contact and remove air pockets.
6.  **Post-Transplant Care:**
    *   Immediately after transplanting, provide a light irrigation to help the soil settle around the roots and reduce transplant shock.
    *   Protect young seedlings from strong winds and intense sun for the first few days if necessary, especially during warmer periods.
    *   Monitor for pests and diseases and take appropriate action as needed.
