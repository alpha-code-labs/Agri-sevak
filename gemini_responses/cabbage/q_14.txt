As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an integrated approach for managing soil pests like termites and root-knot nematodes in cabbage, combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods.

### General Recommendations:

*   **Soil Testing:** Before planting, conduct a soil test to assess nematode population levels and soil health.
*   **Integrated Pest Management (IPM):** Always prioritize cultural and biological methods, resorting to chemical control only when necessary and following recommended dosages and safety precautions.

### 1. Control of Termites (Dimag) in Cabbage

Termites can cause significant damage by feeding on roots and the base of the stem, leading to wilting and plant death, especially in young seedlings.

**A. Cultural and Mechanical Methods:**

*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove all crop residues, stubble, and woody debris from the field before planting, as these can serve as food sources and breeding sites for termites.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** Plough the field deeply during summer to expose termite colonies to sunlight and predators, disrupting their nests.
*   **Irrigation:** Maintain adequate soil moisture, as termites prefer dry conditions.

**B. Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved):**

*   **Pre-planting Soil Treatment:**
    *   Apply **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 2.5 litres per acre, mixed with 200-400 litres of water, and drench the soil thoroughly before transplanting.
    *   Alternatively, broadcast **Fipronil** 0.3% GR at 6-8 kg per acre and incorporate it into the soil during the last ploughing.
*   **Post-planting (if infestation is observed):**
    *   Drench the soil around the base of affected plants with **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 2.5 ml per litre of water. Ensure the drench reaches the root zone.

### 2. Control of Nematodes (Root-knot Nematodes - *Meloidogyne* spp.) in Cabbage

Root-knot nematodes are a major problem in cabbage, causing characteristic galls or knots on roots, leading to stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, reduced water and nutrient uptake, and significant yield losses.

**A. Cultural and Biological Methods:**

*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice rotation with non-host crops such as cereals (maize, sorghum, wheat) or marigold (Tagetes spp.) for at least 2-3 years. Marigold acts as a trap crop and releases nematicidal compounds.
*   **Solarization:** During the hot summer months, cover the prepared field with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks. This raises soil temperature, killing nematodes and other soil-borne pathogens.
*   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost at 10-15 tonnes per acre, or neem cake at 200-400 kg per acre, into the soil before planting. These amendments improve soil health and release compounds toxic to nematodes.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available, choose cabbage varieties known to have some level of resistance or tolerance to root-knot nematodes.
*   **Bio-nematicides:**
    *   Apply **Purpureocillium lilacinum** (formerly *Paecilomyces lilacinus*) or **Trichoderma harzianum** formulations at 2-4 kg per acre, mixed with FYM or compost, and broadcast into the soil before planting or drench around seedlings. These fungi parasitize nematode eggs and juveniles.
    *   Dip seedling roots in a solution of **Purpureocillium lilacinum** or **Trichoderma harzianum** before transplanting.

**B. Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved):**

*   **Pre-planting Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Fluopyram** 17.7% SC at 250 ml per acre as a soil drench or through drip irrigation before or at the time of transplanting.
    *   Alternatively, broadcast **Ethoprophos** 10% GR at 10 kg per acre and incorporate it into the soil during the last ploughing.
    *   Another option is to broadcast **Cadusafos** 10% GR at 10 kg per acre and incorporate it into the soil before planting.

### Important Precautions:

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Avoid spraying during windy conditions to prevent drift.
*   Dispose of empty containers safely as per guidelines.
*   Maintain proper pre-harvest intervals (PHI) for all chemical applications.
