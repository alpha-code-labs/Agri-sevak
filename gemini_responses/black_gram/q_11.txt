As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling beetles, weevils, and sawflies in Black Gram (Urdbean) in Haryana.

### Control of Beetles in Black Gram

Beetles such as flea beetles, leaf beetles (e.g., galerucid beetles), and blister beetles can cause significant damage to Black Gram by feeding on leaves, flowers, and pods. Control measures should be initiated upon reaching economic threshold levels.

**Recommended Chemical Control:**

*   For early-stage defoliating beetles (flea beetles, leaf beetles):
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL @ 125 ml/acre
    *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG @ 50 g/acre
*   For general defoliating beetles and blister beetles (feeding on flowers/pods):
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC @ 100-125 ml/acre
    *   **Cypermethrin** 25% EC @ 100-120 ml/acre
    *   **Quinalphos** 25% EC @ 600 ml/acre

### Control of Weevils in Black Gram

Weevils, particularly stem weevils and pod weevils (e.g., *Apion* species), can cause damage by boring into stems or feeding inside developing pods.

**Recommended Chemical Control:**

*   For stem weevils (early stage, if observed):
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC @ 60 ml/acre
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC @ 100-125 ml/acre
*   For pod weevils/pod borers (during flowering and pod development):
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC @ 60 ml/acre
    *   **Indoxacarb** 14.5% SC @ 200 ml/acre
    *   **Emamectin Benzoate** 5% SG @ 80 g/acre
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC @ 100-125 ml/acre

### Sawflies

This is not known to affect Black Gram.

**General Recommendations for Application:**

*   Always monitor your crop regularly for pest incidence.
*   Apply insecticides only when pest populations reach economic threshold levels.
*   Ensure thorough spray coverage, typically using 200-250 litres of water per acre.
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pest resistance.
*   Adhere strictly to the recommended dosage and pre-harvest interval (PHI) mentioned on the product label.
