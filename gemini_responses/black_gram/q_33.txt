As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an Integrated Weed Management (IWM) approach for effective and sustainable weed control in Black Gram (Urdbean). This combines cultural, mechanical, and chemical methods.

**I. Integrated Weed Management (IWM) Principles for Black Gram:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Clean Seed:** Always use certified, weed-free Black Gram seeds to prevent the introduction of new weed species.
    *   **Timely Sowing:** Sowing at the optimal time allows the crop to establish quickly and compete better with weeds.
    *   **Proper Seedbed Preparation:** Thorough land preparation can reduce the initial weed flush.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate Black Gram with non-host crops or crops that allow for different weed control strategies (e.g., cereals).
    *   **Optimum Plant Density:** Maintain recommended plant spacing and density to ensure good canopy cover, which helps suppress weed growth.

2.  **Mechanical Methods:**
    *   **Hand Weeding:** This is highly effective, especially for initial weed control and for parasitic weeds. Two hand weedings, one at 20-25 days after sowing (DAS) and another at 40-45 DAS, are generally recommended.
    *   **Inter-cultivation:** Using a hoe or cultivator between rows can effectively remove weeds, particularly in the early stages of crop growth.

**II. Chemical Weed Control in Black Gram:**

Chemical control should be used as a supplement to cultural and mechanical methods. Always ensure uniform spray coverage and use the recommended water volume (typically 200-300 L/acre).

**A. Pre-emergence Herbicides (Applied within 0-3 days after sowing):**
These herbicides are applied to the soil surface after sowing but before the emergence of the crop and weeds. They are effective against germinating broadleaf and narrowleaf weeds.

*   **Pendimethalin** 30% EC: Apply 1.0 kg a.i./acre (approximately 3.3 L of formulation per acre) in 200-300 L of water. This provides good control of many annual grasses and broadleaf weeds. It also offers some suppression of *Cuscuta* (Amarbail) germination.
*   **Fluchloralin** 45% EC: Apply 0.675 kg a.i./acre (approximately 1.5 L of formulation per acre) in 200-300 L of water. It can be applied as a pre-plant incorporation (PPI) or pre-emergence.

**B. Post-emergence Herbicides (Applied when weeds are at 2-4 leaf stage, typically 15-25 DAS):**
These herbicides are applied after the emergence of both the crop and weeds.

*   **For Broadleaf and some Narrowleaf Weeds:**
    *   **Imazethapyr** 10% SL: Apply 75-100 g a.i./acre (approximately 750-1000 ml of formulation per acre) in 200-300 L of water. This is effective against a wide range of broadleaf weeds and some grasses.
    *   **Imazamox** 35% + **Imazethapyr** 35% WG: Apply 80 g of formulation per acre in 200-300 L of water. This combination provides broad-spectrum control of many broadleaf and narrowleaf weeds.
    *   **Bentazone** 48% SL: Apply 0.75-1.0 kg a.i./acre (approximately 1.5-2.0 L of formulation per acre) in 200-300 L of water. Primarily effective against broadleaf weeds.
    *   **Chlorimuron-ethyl** 25% WP: Apply 9-10 g a.i./acre (approximately 36-40 g of formulation per acre) in 200-300 L of water. Primarily effective against broadleaf weeds.

*   **For Narrowleaf Weeds (Grasses) only:**
    *   **Quizalofop-ethyl** 5% EC: Apply 50 g a.i./acre (approximately 1.0 L of formulation per acre) in 200-300 L of water. Highly effective against annual and perennial grasses.
    *   **Fenoxaprop-p-ethyl** 9% EC: Apply 45-50 g a.i./acre (approximately 500-550 ml of formulation per acre) in 200-300 L of water. Also highly effective against annual and perennial grasses.

**III. Specific Weed Control Recommendations:**

1.  **Broadleaf Weeds (e.g., Bathu, Congress grass):**
    *   **Pre-emergence:** **Pendimethalin** 30% EC (1.0 kg a.i./acre) or **Fluchloralin** 45% EC (0.675 kg a.i./acre).
    *   **Post-emergence:** **Imazethapyr** 10% SL (75-100 g a.i./acre), **Imazamox** 35% + **Imazethapyr** 35% WG (80 g/acre), **Bentazone** 48% SL (0.75-1.0 kg a.i./acre), or **Chlorimuron-ethyl** 25% WP (9-10 g a.i./acre).
    *   For Congress grass (*Parthenium hysterophorus*), hand pulling with gloves before flowering is also effective, especially for small patches.

2.  **Narrowleaf Weeds (e.g., Phalaris minor):**
    *   **Pre-emergence:** **Pendimethalin** 30% EC (1.0 kg a.i./acre).
    *   **Post-emergence:** **Quizalofop-ethyl** 5% EC (50 g a.i./acre), **Fenoxaprop-p-ethyl** 9% EC (45-50 g a.i./acre), or **Imazethapyr** 10% SL (75-100 g a.i./acre).

3.  **Amarbail (Cuscuta spp.):**
    *   **Cultural:** Use clean, Cuscuta-free seed. Avoid planting Black Gram in fields known to be heavily infested. Hand-weeding of initial patches before the parasite spreads is crucial.
    *   **Chemical:** **Pendimethalin** 30% EC (1.0 kg a.i./acre) as a pre-emergence application can offer some suppression of Cuscuta germination. There are no effective selective post-emergence herbicides for in-crop control of Cuscuta in Black Gram without causing significant crop injury.

4.  **Orobanche (Orobanche spp.):**
    *   **Cultural:** Crop rotation with non-host crops (e.g., cereals) and deep ploughing can help reduce the seed bank.
    *   **Chemical:** There are no CIBRC approved selective chemical control measures for *in-crop* application in Black Gram that effectively control Orobanche without causing significant damage to the crop. Research is ongoing, but currently, no reliable chemical solution is available for farmers.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the label instructions of the herbicide product.
*   Use appropriate safety gear during herbicide application.
*   Calibrate your sprayer to ensure correct dosage and uniform application.
*   Avoid spraying on windy days to prevent drift.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension specialists for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions.
