As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice to improve yield, fruit quality, and storage life for Black Gram (Urd bean) in Haryana.

### I. Improving Yield

To maximize Black Gram yield, focus on optimal agronomic practices and timely management:

*   **1. Variety Selection:**
    *   Choose high-yielding, disease-resistant varieties recommended for Haryana, such as UH-1, IPU 2-43, Pant U-31, Shekhar-2, PU-19, PU-30, Mash-114, Mash-338. Consult your local KVK (Krishi Vigyan Kendra) or HAU extension services for the latest recommendations.

*   **2. Seed Treatment:**
    *   Treat seeds with a fungicide and insecticide to protect against early seedling diseases and pests.
        *   For fungal diseases (e.g., damping-off, root rot): **Carbendazim** 1 g/kg seed + **Thiram** 2 g/kg seed OR **Tebuconazole** 1.25 ml/kg seed.
        *   For sucking pests (e.g., whitefly, thrips) in early stages: **Imidacloprid** 5 g/kg seed.
    *   Inoculate seeds with Rhizobium culture (5-10 g/kg seed) and PSB (Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria) culture (5-10 g/kg seed) for improved nitrogen fixation and phosphorus availability.

*   **3. Sowing Time and Method:**
    *   **Kharif (Monsoon) Season:** Mid-July to early August is ideal.
    *   **Spring/Summer Season:** Mid-February to mid-March (where feasible and irrigation is assured).
    *   Maintain proper spacing: 30 cm row-to-row and 10 cm plant-to-plant.
    *   Seed rate: 15-20 kg/acre for Kharif, 20-25 kg/acre for spring/summer.

*   **4. Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Fertilizers:** Apply 15 kg Nitrogen, 40 kg Phosphorus, and 20 kg Potassium per acre.
        *   This translates to approximately 35 kg DAP (Di-ammonium Phosphate) + 35 kg MOP (Muriate of Potash) per acre at the time of sowing. If DAP is not used, apply 35 kg Single Super Phosphate (SSP) + 15 kg Urea + 35 kg MOP per acre.
    *   **Micronutrients:** Black gram often responds well to zinc and sulphur.
        *   Apply **Zinc Sulphate** (21%) at 10 kg/acre or **Zinc Sulphate** (33%) at 6 kg/acre as basal application.
        *   Apply **Sulphur** (Bentonite Sulphur 90%) at 8-10 kg/acre as basal application.
        *   Foliar spray of 0.5% **Zinc Sulphate** and 0.5% **Ferrous Sulphate** at flowering stage can boost yield.

*   **5. Irrigation:**
    *   Black gram is largely rainfed in Kharif. However, supplemental irrigation during dry spells, especially at flowering and pod development stages, can significantly improve yield.
    *   For spring/summer crop, 2-3 irrigations are crucial: at branching, flowering, and pod filling stages.

*   **6. Weed Management:**
    *   Weeds can cause significant yield losses (up to 50-70%).
    *   **Pre-emergence herbicide:** Apply **Pendimethalin** 30% EC at 1.0-1.3 L/acre or **Fluchloralin** 45% EC at 0.8-1.0 L/acre within 3 days of sowing.
    *   **Post-emergence herbicide:** If weeds emerge, apply **Imazethapyr** 10% SL at 100 ml/acre or **Quizalofop-ethyl** 5% EC at 400 ml/acre (for grassy weeds) at 15-20 days after sowing. Always use with a non-ionic surfactant.
    *   One hand weeding at 20-25 days after sowing is highly effective.

*   **7. Pest and Disease Management:**
    *   **Major Pests:** Pod borer, whitefly, jassids, thrips.
        *   For sucking pests (whitefly, jassids, thrips): Foliar spray of **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL at 125 ml/acre or **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG at 50 g/acre.
        *   For pod borer: Foliar spray of **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC at 60 ml/acre or **Emamectin Benzoate** 5% SG at 88 g/acre at flowering/pod initiation.
    *   **Major Diseases:** Yellow Mosaic Virus (YMV), powdery mildew, leaf spot, root rot.
        *   YMV is transmitted by whiteflies; manage whiteflies as above. Use resistant varieties.
        *   For powdery mildew: Spray **Wettable Sulphur** 80% WP at 2.5 kg/acre or **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC at 200 ml/acre.
        *   For leaf spot: Spray **Mancozeb** 75% WP at 800 g/acre or **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 200 g/acre.

### II. Improving Fruit Quality (Grain Quality)

Fruit quality in Black Gram primarily refers to the physical and nutritional quality of the grains.

*   **1. Balanced Nutrition:**
    *   Adequate supply of Phosphorus and Potassium, along with micronutrients like Zinc and Sulphur, is crucial for good grain filling and quality. Refer to the nutrient management section above.
    *   Foliar application of 2% Urea solution (2 kg Urea in 100 L water) at pre-flowering and pod development stages can improve protein content and grain size.

*   **2. Timely Irrigation:**
    *   Ensuring sufficient moisture during the pod development and grain filling stages prevents shriveling and ensures plump, well-developed grains. Water stress during these critical periods can severely reduce grain size and quality.

*   **3. Effective Pest and Disease Control:**
    *   Pest damage (e.g., pod borers) and disease infections (e.g., leaf spots, rusts) directly impact grain quality by reducing photosynthetic efficiency and damaging pods/grains. Healthy plants produce superior quality grains.

*   **4. Harvesting at Physiological Maturity:**
    *   Harvest when 75-80% of the pods have matured and turned blackish-brown. Premature harvesting leads to shriveled, immature grains, while delayed harvesting can result in shattering losses and quality deterioration due to adverse weather.

### III. Improving Storage Life

Proper post-harvest handling and storage are critical to extend the shelf life of Black Gram.

*   **1. Proper Drying:**
    *   After harvesting, dry the pods/grains thoroughly in the sun until the moisture content is reduced to 8-10%. Inadequate drying is the primary cause of storage losses due to mold growth and insect infestation.
    *   Spread grains thinly on a clean, dry surface and turn regularly. Avoid direct contact with soil.

*   **2. Cleaning and Grading:**
    *   Clean the grains to remove all foreign matter (chaff, dust, stones, immature pods, weed seeds). Grading for uniform size also helps in better storage and market value.

*   **3. Pest Management in Storage:**
    *   **Storage Pests:** Pulse beetle (Callosobruchus maculatus) is the most destructive pest.
    *   **Sanitation:** Clean the storage area thoroughly before storing new produce. Remove old grain residues.
    *   **Airtight Storage:** Store grains in airtight containers (metal bins, plastic drums) to restrict oxygen, which inhibits insect activity and fungal growth.
    *   **Fumigation (for large quantities):** If infestation is observed or anticipated in bulk storage, fumigation can be done by trained personnel using **Aluminium Phosphide** tablets (1-2 tablets of 3g per tonne of grain) for 5-7 days. Ensure proper sealing and safety precautions.
    *   **Neem Seed Kernel Extract (NSKE):** For small-scale storage, mixing dried neem leaves or applying neem oil (1-2 ml/kg grain) can act as a natural repellent.
    *   **Sun Drying of Storage Containers:** Periodically sun-dry the storage containers and grains to reduce moisture and kill any developing pests.

*   **4. Temperature and Humidity Control:**
    *   Store grains in a cool, dry, well-ventilated place. High temperature and humidity promote pest and mold development.

By implementing these integrated management practices, you can significantly improve the yield, fruit quality, and storage life of your Black Gram crop in Haryana. For specific local conditions and further guidance, please consult the experts at HAU or your nearest KVK.
