As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Black Gram (Urdbean) in Haryana:

It is crucial to regularly scout your fields to identify pests early and apply control measures at the appropriate time, ideally when pest populations reach economic threshold levels.

### Control Measures for Black Gram Pests:

#### 1. Borers (e.g., Gram Pod Borer - *Helicoverpa armigera*, Spotted Pod Borer - *Maruca vitrata*) and Caterpillars (e.g., Tobacco Caterpillar - *Spodoptera litura*, Bihar Hairy Caterpillar - *Spilosoma obliqua*):

These lepidopteran pests cause significant damage by feeding on leaves, flowers, and pods. For effective control, consider the following CIBRC approved insecticides:

*   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC: Apply at 60 ml per acre.
*   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG: Apply at 80-100 g per acre.
*   **Indoxacarb** 14.5% SC: Apply at 200 ml per acre.
*   **Flubendiamide** 20% WG: Apply at 50 g per acre.
*   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: Apply at 100-120 ml per acre.

Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the underside of leaves and developing pods.

#### 2. Diamondback Moth (*Plutella xylostella*):

This is not known to affect Black Gram. Diamondback moth is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops like cabbage, cauliflower, and mustard.

#### 3. Leaf Folder:

Leaf folders are also lepidopteran larvae that fold leaves and feed from within. The insecticides recommended for borers and caterpillars are generally effective against leaf folders as well:

*   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC: Apply at 60 ml per acre.
*   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG: Apply at 80-100 g per acre.
*   **Indoxacarb** 14.5% SC: Apply at 200 ml per acre.

Always read and follow the instructions on the product label for safe and effective use, including pre-harvest intervals. Use appropriate personal protective equipment during application.
