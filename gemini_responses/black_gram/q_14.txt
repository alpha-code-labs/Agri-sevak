As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling soil pests like termites and nematodes (root-knot) in Black Gram (Urad Dal) in Haryana.

Both termites and root-knot nematodes are significant soil pests that can cause considerable damage to Black Gram, leading to reduced plant vigour and yield losses. Effective management requires a combination of cultural practices and judicious use of CIBRC-approved chemical interventions.

### Control of Termites

Termites primarily damage roots and the base of the stem, leading to wilting and plant death.

1.  **Pre-sowing Soil Treatment:**
    *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC**: Apply 2.5 litres per acre, mixed with 200-400 litres of water, as a drench or spray on the soil surface before sowing. Ensure thorough incorporation into the soil during field preparation.
    *   **Fipronil 0.3% GR**: Broadcast 6-8 kg per acre and incorporate into the soil during the final ploughing before sowing.

2.  **At Sowing / Post-emergence (if infestation observed):**
    *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC**: If termite damage is observed after emergence, drench the soil around the base of affected plants with a solution of 2.5 ml per litre of water.

### Control of Nematodes (Root-knot)

Root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.) cause characteristic galls or knots on the roots, impairing water and nutrient uptake, leading to stunted growth, yellowing, and reduced yield.

1.  **Cultural Practices (Essential for Nematode Management):**
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate Black Gram with non-host crops like cereals (e.g., sorghum, maize) or marigold.
    *   **Summer Ploughing:** Deep ploughing during hot summer months exposes nematode eggs and larvae to sunlight, desiccating and killing them.
    *   **Use of Organic Manures:** Incorporating well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost improves soil health and can enhance natural nematode antagonists.

2.  **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Seed Treatment (for early protection):**
        *   **Carbosulfan 25% EC**: Treat seeds at the rate of 20 ml per kg of seed before sowing. This provides initial protection to germinating seedlings.

    *   **Soil Application (at sowing):**
        *   **Carbofuran 3% G**: Apply 10-15 kg per acre in furrows at the time of sowing. Ensure proper mixing with the soil.
        *   **Phorate 10% G**: Apply 10-15 kg per acre in furrows at the time of sowing. *Note: Phorate is highly toxic; handle with extreme care and follow all safety guidelines.*
        *   **Carbosulfan 6% G**: Apply 6-8 kg per acre in furrows at the time of sowing.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label for specific dosages, application methods, and safety precautions.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods, is recommended for sustainable and effective pest control.
