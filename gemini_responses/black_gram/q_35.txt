Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I am pleased to provide you with the scientifically verified information regarding the maturity signs, harvesting time, and cutting process for Black Gram (Urd bean) in Haryana.

### Maturity Signs for Black Gram

The following signs indicate that your Black Gram crop is ready for harvest:

*   **Pod Colour Change:** The most prominent sign is the change in pod colour from green to black or dark brown.
*   **Leaf Senescence:** The leaves will start turning yellow and begin to shed, indicating the plant is nearing the end of its life cycle.
*   **Pod Dryness:** The pods will become dry and brittle to the touch.
*   **Seed Hardness:** The seeds inside the pods will be hard, firm, and have attained their characteristic dark colour.
*   **Overall Plant Drying:** The entire plant will show signs of drying, though some greenness might persist in the stem.

### Harvesting Time for Black Gram

*   The optimal time for harvesting Black Gram is when **75-80% of the pods have matured and dried**, and the seeds inside are hard.
*   Harvesting too early can result in immature, shriveled grains and reduced yield.
*   Delaying harvest can lead to significant shattering losses, especially in dry and windy conditions, as the dry pods tend to burst open.
*   Typically, Black Gram varieties grown in Haryana mature in **70-90 days** after sowing, depending on the specific variety and prevailing weather conditions.

### Cutting Process for Black Gram

The cutting process can be done manually or, in some cases, mechanically.

*   **Manual Harvesting:**
    *   The plants are cut close to the ground using sickles.
    *   The harvested plants are then tied into small bundles.
    *   These bundles are left in the field or transported to a clean, dry area for sun-drying for **2-3 days**. This ensures uniform drying of all pods and grains, which is crucial for efficient threshing and good grain quality.
    *   After adequate drying, threshing is performed either manually (by beating the bundles with sticks or trampling under bullocks) or using small, appropriate threshing machines.
    *   The threshed grains are then winnowed to separate the chaff and cleaned.

*   **Mechanical Harvesting (Less Common for Black Gram):**
    *   While combine harvesters can be used for large, uniformly mature fields, they are less commonly employed for Black Gram in Haryana due to its indeterminate growth habit and staggered maturity, which can lead to higher losses.
    *   If a combine harvester is used, it should be set to appropriate parameters to minimize shattering and grain damage.

Always ensure the harvested grains are properly dried to a moisture content of **8-10%** before storage to prevent pest infestation and fungal growth.
