Sucking pests like aphids, leafhoppers, whiteflies, and thrips can cause significant damage to Black Gram (Urdbean) by directly feeding on plant sap, leading to stunted growth, leaf curling, and reduced yield. They are also notorious for transmitting viral diseases, which can be devastating. Effective and timely management is crucial for a healthy crop.

**Regarding Psylla:** This is not known to affect Black Gram.

For the other sucking pests, an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is highly recommended, combining various strategies for sustainable control:

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Timely Sowing:** Adhere to the recommended sowing window for Black Gram in Haryana to avoid peak pest incidence periods.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Regularly remove weeds from and around the field, as they can serve as alternate hosts for these pests.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush, tender growth that is more attractive to sucking pests.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** If available and suitable for your region, choose Black Gram varieties known for their tolerance or resistance to sucking pests or the viral diseases they transmit.

**2. Biological Control:**
*   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Protect beneficial insects such as ladybird beetles, lacewings, and syrphid fly larvae, which are natural predators of aphids and whiteflies. Avoid indiscriminate use of broad-spectrum insecticides.
*   **Biopesticides:** At early stages of infestation, consider using neem-based formulations (e.g., Azadirachtin 1500 ppm or 3000 ppm) at 2-3 ml/L of water. These act as antifeedants and repellents.

**3. Chemical Control (When pest population crosses Economic Threshold Level - ETL):**
Regular monitoring of your field is essential. If the pest population reaches damaging levels (e.g., 5-10 aphids/plant, 2-3 whiteflies/leaf, or significant activity of leafhoppers or thrips), chemical intervention may be necessary. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.

Here are some CIBRC-approved technical chemicals for controlling sucking pests in Black Gram:

*   **For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips:**
    *   **Imidacloprid** (17.8% SL) at 125-150 ml per acre (mixed in 200-250 litres of water).
    *   **Thiamethoxam** (25% WG) at 50-100 g per acre (mixed in 200-250 litres of water).
    *   **Acetamiprid** (20% SP) at 50-100 g per acre (mixed in 200-250 litres of water).
    *   **Flonicamid** (50% WG) at 60 g per acre (mixed in 200-250 litres of water), particularly effective against aphids and whiteflies.

*   **Specifically for Whiteflies:**
    *   **Buprofezin** (25% SC) at 500-600 ml per acre (mixed in 200-250 litres of water), primarily targets nymphs.
    *   **Spiromesifen** (22.9% SC) at 125 ml per acre (mixed in 200-250 litres of water), effective against whiteflies and mites.

*   **For Thrips and Leafhoppers:**
    *   **Fipronil** (5% SC) at 400-600 ml per acre (mixed in 200-250 litres of water).
    *   **Dimethoate** (30% EC) at 330 ml per acre (mixed in 200-250 litres of water).

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Timing of Application:** Apply insecticides early in the morning or late in the evening to minimize drift, reduce evaporation, and protect pollinators.
*   **Thorough Coverage:** Ensure complete spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where many sucking pests reside.
*   **Safety First:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, mask, and protective clothing during mixing and spraying. Read and strictly follow the instructions and safety precautions mentioned on the product label.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Be mindful of the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) for each chemical to ensure the safety of the harvested produce for consumption.
