As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I must clarify the specific rust diseases affecting Black Gram (Urdbean) based on scientifically verified information for Haryana.

Regarding the specific rust diseases you have mentioned:

*   **Black Rust (Stem Rust):** This is not known to affect Black Gram. Black rust primarily affects cereal crops like wheat.
*   **Brown Rust (Leaf Rust):** This is not known to affect Black Gram. Brown rust primarily affects cereal crops like wheat.
*   **Yellow Rust (Stripe Rust):** This is not known to affect Black Gram. Yellow rust primarily affects cereal crops like wheat and barley.
*   **White Rust:** This is not known to affect Black Gram. White rust (caused by *Albugo* species) typically affects cruciferous crops and some other plant families, but not Black Gram.
*   **Red Rust:** This is not known to affect Black Gram as a distinct disease entity. "Red rust" can sometimes refer to algal rust on perennial crops or be a general term, but it is not a specific fungal rust disease of Black Gram.

**Regarding Rust Disease in Black Gram (Urdbean Rust):**

While the specific rusts you listed do not affect Black Gram, the crop is susceptible to a distinct rust disease known as **Urdbean Rust**, caused by the fungus *Uromyces appendiculatus* var. *appendiculatus* (or *Uromyces vignae*). This is a common and significant disease in Black Gram cultivation in Haryana.

**Symptoms of Urdbean Rust:**
The disease typically appears as small, circular to oval, reddish-brown pustules (uredinia) primarily on the lower surface of leaves. As the disease progresses, these pustules can also appear on petioles, stems, and even pods. Severe infection leads to premature defoliation, reduced photosynthetic activity, and significant yield losses.

**Control Measures for Urdbean Rust:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available and suitable for your region, planting rust-resistant or tolerant varieties is the most effective and economical control method. Consult with HAU extension services for recommended varieties.
    *   **Timely Sowing:** Sowing at the recommended time can help the crop escape peak disease periods.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid continuous cultivation of Black Gram or other susceptible pulse crops in the same field.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest to reduce inoculum for the next season.

2.  **Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
    When the disease appears, especially during humid weather conditions, timely application of fungicides is crucial. Always ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.

    *   **Systemic Fungicides:**
        *   **Propiconazole** 25% EC: Apply at 500 ml/acre.
        *   **Difenoconazole** 25% EC: Apply at 120 ml/acre.
        *   **Tebuconazole** 25.9% EC: Apply at 250 ml/acre.
        *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC: Apply at 200 ml/acre.

    *   **Contact/Protective Fungicides:**
        *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP: Apply at 800 g/acre. This can be used as a preventive spray or in early stages of the disease.

    **Application Strategy:**
    *   Initiate spraying upon the first appearance of rust symptoms.
    *   Repeat applications at 10-15 day intervals, depending on disease severity and weather conditions, typically 2-3 sprays may be required.
    *   Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions when handling and applying fungicides.
