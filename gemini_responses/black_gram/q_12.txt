Both Scale insects and Mealybugs are sucking pests that can affect Black Gram (Urdbean), leading to stunted growth, yellowing, and reduced yield. Effective management requires timely intervention and thorough application.

Here are the scientifically verified control measures using CIBRC approved technical chemicals for Haryana:

**General Control Measures for Scale Insects and Mealybugs:**

*   **Early Detection:** Regularly monitor your crop for the presence of these pests, especially on the undersides of leaves, stems, and in leaf axils.
*   **Thorough Coverage:** Ensure complete spray coverage, particularly targeting the hidden areas where these pests tend to congregate. A high-volume sprayer is often recommended.
*   **Rotation of Chemicals:** To prevent the development of resistance, it is advisable to rotate insecticides with different modes of action if multiple applications are needed.

**Chemical Control Options:**

For effective control of both Scale insects and Mealybugs in Black Gram, the following systemic insecticides are recommended:

*   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at a rate of **125 ml per acre**. This systemic insecticide is absorbed by the plant and provides control against sucking pests.
*   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at a rate of **50 g per acre**. This is another highly effective systemic insecticide against a wide range of sucking pests.
*   **Dimethoate 30% EC:** Apply at a rate of **660 ml per acre**. This is a broad-spectrum systemic and contact insecticide effective against various sucking pests, including scales and mealybugs.
*   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at a rate of **500 ml per acre**. This is an insect growth regulator (IGR) that is particularly effective against the nymphal stages of mealybugs by inhibiting chitin synthesis, leading to their mortality during molting. It also has ovicidal properties.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label for specific dosage, application methods, and safety precautions.
*   Ensure proper safety gear (gloves, mask, protective clothing) is used during mixing and spraying.
*   Observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) specified on the label before harvesting.
