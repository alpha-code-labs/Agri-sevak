As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling viral diseases in Black Gram (Vigna mungo) in Haryana.

It is crucial to understand that there is no direct chemical cure for viral diseases once a plant is infected. Therefore, control strategies primarily focus on prevention, managing the insect vectors that transmit these viruses, and using resistant varieties.

Let's address the specific conditions mentioned:

*   **Tristeza:** This is not known to affect Black Gram. Citrus Tristeza Virus (CTV) is a well-known virus primarily affecting citrus species.
*   **Stripe:** While "Stripe virus" is not a commonly recognized distinct viral disease of Black Gram, if symptoms resembling stripes appear, they are likely indicative of a viral infection. The general control measures for viral diseases, focusing on vector management and cultural practices, should be applied.
*   **Leaf curl, Mosaic, Yellow vein clearing, and Stunt virus:** These are common symptoms or manifestations of significant viral diseases affecting Black Gram in Haryana, primarily:
    *   **Mungbean Yellow Mosaic Virus (MYMV) / Mungbean Yellow Mosaic India Virus (MYMIV):** These cause yellowing, mosaic patterns, and yellow vein clearing, leading to reduced pod formation and yield. They are transmitted by whiteflies.
    *   **Urdbean Leaf Crinkle Virus (ULCV):** This causes severe crinkling, curling, stunting, and malformation of leaves, leading to significant yield losses. It is transmitted by aphids and through sap.

**Control Measures for Viral Diseases (MYMV, MYMIV, ULCV, and other viral infections causing leaf curl, mosaic, yellow vein clearing, and stunting):**

1.  **Use of Resistant/Tolerant Varieties:**
    *   This is the most effective and economical method. Consult HAU or local agricultural extension for recommended varieties suitable for Haryana that show resistance or tolerance to MYMV/MYMIV and ULCV.

2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Timely Sowing:** Sow black gram at the recommended time to avoid peak periods of vector (whitefly and aphid) activity.
    *   **Rogueing:** Regularly inspect the field and promptly remove and destroy (bury or burn) any plants showing symptoms of viral infection (yellowing, mosaic, crinkling, stunting). This reduces the source of inoculum.
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the field and surrounding areas free of weeds, as many weeds can act as alternate hosts for viruses and their insect vectors.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops to break the disease cycle.
    *   **Border Cropping:** Planting tall crops like maize or sorghum as a border crop can act as a physical barrier, reducing vector movement into the black gram field.

3.  **Vector Management (Insecticides):**
    *   Controlling the insect vectors (whiteflies and aphids) is crucial to prevent the spread of viral diseases.

    *   **A. Seed Treatment (for early protection against sucking pests):**
        *   Treat seeds with systemic insecticides before sowing to provide initial protection against whiteflies and aphids.
        *   **Imidacloprid** 70 WS: 5-7 g per kg of seed.
        *   **Thiamethoxam** 70 WS: 3-5 g per kg of seed.

    *   **B. Foliar Sprays (upon appearance of vectors or initial symptoms):**
        *   Monitor the crop regularly for the presence of whiteflies and aphids. Apply insecticides when pest populations reach economic threshold levels or when initial symptoms of viral diseases appear in scattered plants. Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.

        *   **For Whiteflies (transmitting MYMV/MYMIV):**
            *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8 SL: 125 ml per acre (diluted in 200-250 litres of water).
            *   **Thiamethoxam** 25 WG: 100 g per acre (diluted in 200-250 litres of water).
            *   **Acetamiprid** 20 SP: 80-100 g per acre (diluted in 200-250 litres of water).
            *   **Diafenthiuron** 50 WP: 250 g per acre (diluted in 200-250 litres of water).
            *   **Buprofezin** 25 SC: 320 ml per acre (diluted in 200-250 litres of water).

        *   **For Aphids (transmitting ULCV):**
            *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8 SL: 125 ml per acre (diluted in 200-250 litres of water).
            *   **Thiamethoxam** 25 WG: 100 g per acre (diluted in 200-250 litres of water).
            *   **Acetamiprid** 20 SP: 80-100 g per acre (diluted in 200-250 litres of water).
            *   **Dimethoate** 30 EC: 200-250 ml per acre (diluted in 200-250 litres of water).

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the insecticide label for safe and effective use, including pre-harvest intervals.
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance in insect vectors.
*   Consult with your local HAU extension specialist for the most current recommendations and specific varieties suitable for your region within Haryana.
