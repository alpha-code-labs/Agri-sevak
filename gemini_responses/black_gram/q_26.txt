As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified information regarding specialized practices in Black Gram (Urdbean) cultivation for Haryana:

*   **Pruning:** This is not known to affect Black Gram. Black Gram is a bushy, annual legume crop where pruning is not a standard or recommended practice for enhancing yield or managing plant growth.
*   **Desuckering:** This is not known to affect Black Gram. Black Gram does not produce suckers in a manner that requires desuckering for its cultivation.
*   **Mulching:** Mulching can be a beneficial practice in Black Gram cultivation, especially for moisture conservation and weed management.
    *   **Benefits:**
        *   **Moisture Conservation:** Reduces evaporation from the soil surface, conserving soil moisture, which is crucial for rainfed Black Gram crops in Haryana.
        *   **Weed Suppression:** Acts as a physical barrier, suppressing weed growth and reducing competition for nutrients and water.
        *   **Soil Temperature Regulation:** Helps moderate soil temperature, protecting roots from extreme heat or cold.
        *   **Soil Health Improvement:** Organic mulches decompose over time, adding organic matter and improving soil structure and fertility.
    *   **Materials:** Crop residues (e.g., wheat straw, rice straw), dry leaves, or plastic mulches can be used.
    *   **Application:** Apply a layer of mulch (5-10 cm thick for organic mulches) after sowing or after the first weeding, ensuring it does not smother young seedlings.
*   **Grafting:** This is not known to affect Black Gram. Black Gram is an annual crop primarily propagated by seeds, and grafting is not a practice used in its cultivation.
*   **Pollination:** Black Gram (Vigna mungo) is predominantly a self-pollinated crop.
    *   **Mechanism:** The flowers are cleistogamous to some extent, meaning pollination and fertilization often occur before the flower fully opens.
    *   **External Factors:** While insects (like bees) may visit Black Gram flowers, their contribution to pollination is generally minimal, and the crop does not rely on external agents for successful fruit set.
    *   **Specialized Practices:** No specialized pollination practices (such as hand pollination or introduction of pollinators) are required or recommended for Black Gram cultivation to ensure yield.
