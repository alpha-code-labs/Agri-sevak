Mites, including Red Spider Mite (Tetranychus urticae) and Rust Mite (Polyphagotarsonemus latus), are significant pests of Black Gram (Urad Dal) in Haryana, especially during dry and warm weather conditions. Effective control requires an integrated approach.

**Symptoms of Mite Infestation:**

*   **Red Spider Mite:** Initial symptoms include yellowish-white speckles on the upper leaf surface. As infestation progresses, leaves turn bronze or reddish-brown, and fine silken webs may be visible on the underside of leaves, especially in severe cases. Leaves may eventually dry and drop.
*   **Rust Mite:** These mites are microscopic and not easily visible to the naked eye. Symptoms include downward curling and puckering of leaves, bronzing or russeting of the leaf surface, and stunted plant growth. Often, these symptoms can be mistaken for viral diseases.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Mites in Black Gram:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Regular Monitoring:** Frequently inspect the underside of leaves for mites and their damage, especially during dry periods.
    *   **Weed Management:** Remove weeds from and around the field, as many weeds serve as alternate hosts for mites.
    *   **Proper Irrigation:** Avoid water stress, as it can exacerbate mite problems. Maintain adequate soil moisture.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation to break the pest cycle.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Encourage natural enemies such as predatory mites (e.g., *Amblyseius* species), ladybird beetles, and lacewings by minimizing the use of broad-spectrum insecticides.

3.  **Chemical Control (Acaricides):**
    *   When mite populations reach damaging levels, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always ensure thorough coverage, especially on the underside of leaves where mites reside. Rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

    *   **For Red Spider Mite and Rust Mite:**
        *   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** Apply at 125 ml/acre.
        *   **Propargite 57% EC:** Apply at 1.0 - 1.25 L/acre.
        *   **Fenpyroximate 5% SC:** Apply at 250 - 300 ml/acre.
        *   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP:** Apply at 2.0 - 2.5 kg/acre. This is particularly effective against rust mites and also helps in managing powdery mildew.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label for dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying.
*   Spray during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to maximize efficacy and minimize drift.
*   Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage, especially the undersides of leaves.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer for the most current recommendations and to confirm the specific pest identification.
