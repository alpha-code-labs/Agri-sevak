Here are the recommended cultivation practices for Black Gram (Urd bean) in Haryana:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   **Line Sowing:** This is highly recommended for Black Gram. Sowing in lines facilitates inter-cultivation operations, weeding, spraying, and harvesting, leading to better crop management and yield.
    *   **Direction:** Sowing in an East-West direction is often preferred to ensure maximum sunlight interception by the plants.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   **3-5 cm:** Seeds should be sown at a shallow depth of 3 to 5 cm. Deeper sowing can lead to poor germination and emergence.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   **Row-to-Row:** Maintain a distance of **30 cm** between rows.
    *   **Plant-to-Plant:** Maintain a distance of **10 cm** within the row.

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   For Kharif season: **15-20 kg/acre**
    *   For Spring/Summer season (where applicable): **20-25 kg/acre** (slightly higher due to potentially harsher conditions and need for quicker establishment).
