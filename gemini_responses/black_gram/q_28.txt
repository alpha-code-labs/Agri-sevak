As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the critical importance of protecting Black Gram (Urad Dal) from environmental stresses, which can significantly impact yield and quality in Haryana. Black Gram, while a warm-season crop, is sensitive to extreme fluctuations in temperature and moisture.

Here's scientifically verified advice to mitigate the impact of extreme cold, frost, heat/Loo, and intense sunlight on Black Gram:

### 1. Protection from Extreme Cold and Frost

Black Gram is highly susceptible to cold and frost, especially during flowering and pod development stages.

*   **Adjust Sowing Time:** Plan your sowing schedule to ensure that the sensitive flowering and pod-filling stages do not coincide with the peak winter months (December-January) when frost is most likely. For the Rabi season, this means avoiding very late sowings.
*   **Light Irrigation:** If frost is predicted, apply a light irrigation to the field in the late afternoon. Water has a higher specific heat capacity and releases latent heat as it cools, which can raise the ambient temperature around the plants by a few degrees, preventing frost damage.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure adequate **Potassium** (K) application as part of your balanced fertilizer program. Potassium improves the plant's ability to withstand cold stress by enhancing cell wall strength and osmoregulation.
*   **Foliar Sprays:**
    *   Spray with a 0.5-1% solution of **Potassium Nitrate** (5-10 g/L water) before the onset of cold waves or immediately after a cold spell. This helps in improving the plant's physiological resilience.
    *   A foliar spray of 0.05% **Thiourea** (0.5 g/L water) can also be effective in inducing cold tolerance and reducing flower drop.

### 2. Protection from Heat/Loo (Hot Winds) and Intense Sunlight

High temperatures (above 40°C), hot dry winds (Loo), and intense sunlight, particularly during flowering and pod development, can lead to flower abortion, poor pod set, and reduced grain filling.

*   **Adjust Sowing Time:** For the Kharif season, ensure timely sowing to allow the crop to complete its critical reproductive stages before the most intense heat of late summer. For spring/summer sowings, select varieties with shorter durations to avoid peak heat.
*   **Timely and Adequate Irrigation:** Maintain optimal soil moisture, especially during flowering and pod development. Irrigation helps in cooling the plant canopy through evapotranspiration and prevents wilting. Avoid water stress at all costs during these critical phases.
*   **Mulching:** Apply organic mulch (e.g., straw, crop residues) between rows. Mulching helps in conserving soil moisture, reducing soil temperature, and suppressing weed growth, all of which contribute to mitigating heat stress.
*   **Foliar Sprays:**
    *   Spray with a 0.5-1% solution of **Potassium Nitrate** (5-10 g/L water) during periods of high temperature or when hot winds are expected. This helps in maintaining turgor and improving heat tolerance.
    *   A foliar spray of 0.05% **Thiourea** (0.5 g/L water) can significantly reduce flower drop and improve pod setting under heat stress conditions.
    *   Apply a 3-6% solution of **Kaolin Clay** (30-60 g/L water) as a reflective coating on the leaves. This acts as a physical anti-transpirant, reducing leaf temperature and sunburn by reflecting solar radiation.
    *   Foliar application of **Salicylic Acid** at 100-200 ppm (0.1-0.2 g/L water) can enhance the plant's systemic acquired resistance and improve tolerance to heat stress.

By implementing these scientifically backed strategies, farmers in Haryana can significantly reduce the adverse impacts of environmental stresses on Black Gram cultivation, leading to healthier crops and better yields. Always consult with your local HAU extension specialist for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions.
