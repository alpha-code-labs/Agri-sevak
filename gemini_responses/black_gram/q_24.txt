As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I must clarify that **Black Gram (*Vigna mungo*) is predominantly a direct-seeded crop, and transplantation is generally not recommended as a standard practice.**

Black Gram has a delicate root system, and transplanting can cause significant root disturbance and transplant shock, leading to:
*   Reduced plant vigor
*   Delayed maturity
*   Lower yields

Therefore, the "ideal" process for Black Gram cultivation in Haryana is direct seeding.

However, if for specific reasons such as gap filling in a directly sown field or under very specific experimental conditions, transplantation *must* be considered, here are general guidelines, with the strong caveat that it is not the preferred method:

**1. Ideal Transplantation Time (if absolutely necessary):**
*   Seedlings should be very young, typically **10-15 days old** from germination. Older seedlings experience greater transplant shock.
*   Transplant preferably in the **late afternoon or evening** to allow plants to recover overnight before facing the heat of the day.
*   Ensure the soil in the main field is adequately moist at the time of transplanting.

**2. Ideal Transplantation Distance:**
The spacing for transplanted Black Gram would follow the recommendations for direct-seeded crops to ensure optimal light interception and nutrient uptake:
*   **Row-to-Row Distance:** 30-45 cm
*   **Plant-to-Plant Distance:** 10-15 cm

**3. Ideal Transplantation Process (if absolutely necessary):**
*   **Nursery Raising:**
    *   Raise seedlings in nursery beds or trays using a well-drained, fertile potting mix.
    *   Sow seeds at a shallow depth (1-2 cm).
    *   Ensure consistent moisture for uniform germination and growth.
*   **Preparation of Main Field:**
    *   Prepare the field to a fine tilth, similar to direct seeding.
    *   Ensure adequate moisture in the field before transplanting.
*   **Transplanting:**
    *   Carefully lift the seedlings from the nursery, minimizing root damage. If using trays, gently push out the root ball.
    *   Plant one seedling per hill at the recommended spacing.
    *   Ensure the seedling is planted at the same depth it was in the nursery.
    *   Gently firm the soil around the base of the seedling to ensure good root-to-soil contact.
*   **Post-Transplantation Care:**
    *   Immediately irrigate the field lightly after transplanting to help settle the soil around the roots and reduce shock.
    *   Monitor for wilting and provide light irrigation if necessary during the first few days.
    *   Avoid any stress (water, nutrient, pest) during the initial establishment phase.

**In summary, for optimal Black Gram cultivation in Haryana, direct seeding is the recommended and most efficient method. Transplantation should be avoided unless absolutely necessary for specific remedial actions like gap filling.**
