As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for managing growth issues in Black Gram (Vigna mungo) in Haryana.

**General Agronomic Principles for Healthy Growth:**
Before addressing specific issues, ensure fundamental agronomic practices are in place, as these form the foundation for robust plant growth:
*   **Soil Testing:** Conduct regular soil tests to determine nutrient status, pH, and organic matter content. This is the most crucial step for targeted nutrient management.
*   **Variety Selection:** Choose high-yielding, disease-resistant varieties recommended for Haryana conditions, known for their adaptability and performance.
*   **Timely Sowing:** Adhere to the optimal sowing window for your region to avoid temperature and moisture stresses during critical growth stages.
*   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds with recommended fungicides and insecticides to protect against early-season soil-borne pathogens and insect pests.
*   **Weed Management:** Timely and effective weed control is essential to minimize competition for nutrients, water, and light, which can severely stunt growth.
*   **Water Management:** Provide adequate irrigation during critical growth stages (especially flowering and pod development) and ensure proper drainage to prevent waterlogging, which can lead to root damage and nutrient deficiencies.

**1. Slow Growth:**
Slow growth in Black Gram can be indicative of various underlying issues, primarily nutrient deficiencies, environmental stress, or early pest/disease pressure.

*   **Potential Causes:**
    *   Nutrient deficiencies (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Zinc, Iron, Sulphur).
    *   Water stress (drought or waterlogging).
    *   Soil compaction or poor soil health (low organic matter).
    *   Low temperatures or poor seed quality.
    *   Early incidence of pests or diseases.

*   **Management Strategies:**
    *   **Nutrient Management (based on soil test results):**
        *   **Phosphorus:** Apply **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** at 40-50 kg/acre or **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** at 100-125 kg/acre as a basal dose at sowing.
        *   **Zinc:** If deficient, apply **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** at 25 kg/acre as a basal dose, or foliar spray 0.5% solution (5 g/L) of **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** at 20-30 days after sowing (DAS) and repeat after 10-15 days if symptoms persist.
        *   **Sulphur:** Apply **Elemental sulphur** at 8-10 kg/acre or **Gypsum** at 100-120 kg/acre as a basal dose, especially in light-textured soils.
        *   **Nitrogen:** While Black Gram fixes atmospheric nitrogen, a starter dose of 10-15 kg/acre of **Urea** can be applied at sowing if soil N is very low.
    *   **Water Management:** Ensure optimal soil moisture. Irrigate during dry spells and improve drainage in waterlogged areas.
    *   **Soil Health:** Incorporate farmyard manure or compost to improve soil organic matter and structure. Avoid heavy machinery movement to prevent soil compaction.
    *   **Pest/Disease Scouting:** Regularly inspect plants for early signs of insect pests or diseases and take appropriate action as per HAU recommendations.

**2. Yellow Growth (Chlorosis):**
Yellowing of leaves (chlorosis) can be a symptom of nutrient deficiencies, water stress, or viral infections.

*   **Potential Causes:**
    *   **Nutrient Deficiencies:** Nitrogen (general yellowing, older leaves first), Iron (interveinal chlorosis, younger leaves first, common in alkaline soils), Zinc (stunted growth, yellowing), Sulphur (general yellowing, younger leaves first).
    *   **Waterlogging:** Impairs root function and nutrient uptake due to anaerobic conditions.
    *   **Mungbean Yellow Mosaic Virus (MYMV):** Characterized by bright yellow patches or mottling on leaves, transmitted by whiteflies.

*   **Management Strategies:**
    *   **Nutrient Management (based on soil test results):**
        *   **Iron Deficiency:** Foliar spray 0.5% solution (5 g/L) of **Ferrous sulphate heptahydrate** at 10-15 day intervals until symptoms disappear.
        *   **Zinc Deficiency:** As mentioned under slow growth.
        *   **Sulphur Deficiency:** As mentioned under slow growth.
        *   **Nitrogen Deficiency:** If severe and confirmed, a foliar spray of 1-2% **Urea** solution (10-20 g/L) can be applied, though generally less common in established legumes.
    *   **Water Management:** Ensure proper drainage to prevent waterlogging.
    *   **MYMV Management:**
        *   Use resistant varieties recommended by HAU.
        *   Control whitefly vectors:
            *   Foliar spray of **Imidacloprid** 0.3-0.5 ml/L or **Thiamethoxam** 0.2-0.25 g/L at the appearance of whiteflies. Repeat if necessary based on pest pressure.

**3. Excessive Height:**
Excessive height in Black Gram is generally not a major concern leading to significant yield loss or lodging, unlike in cereals. It is often a result of specific environmental or management factors.

*   **Potential Causes:**
    *   High plant density.
    *   Excessive nitrogen application.
    *   Shading from weeds or intercropping.
    *   Certain varietal characteristics.

*   **Management Strategies:**
    *   **Optimal Plant Spacing:** Adhere to recommended plant-to-plant and row-to-row spacing for the chosen variety to ensure adequate light penetration and air circulation.
    *   **Nitrogen Management:** Avoid excessive application of nitrogen fertilizers. Black Gram, being a legume, fixes atmospheric nitrogen, and only a starter dose is typically required.
    *   **Weed Control:** Timely and effective weed management prevents competition for light, which can cause plants to stretch.
    *   **Variety Selection:** Choose varieties known for their compact or semi-erect growth habit if excessive height is a recurring issue in your field.
    *   **Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs):** This is not known to be a common or recommended practice for Black Gram in Haryana, as the benefits typically do not outweigh the costs or potential risks, and specific CIBRC-approved PGRs for height reduction in Black Gram are not routinely advised for this crop.

**4. Excessive Flowering (and poor pod set):**
While abundant flowering seems positive, if it's not followed by good pod set, it indicates a problem, often related to nutrient balance or environmental stress.

*   **Potential Causes:**
    *   Nutrient imbalances (especially Phosphorus, Potassium, Boron).
    *   High temperatures during flowering leading to flower drop.
    *   Water stress (either deficit or excess) during reproductive stages.
    *   Pest damage to flowers (e.g., thrips, pod borers).

*   **Management Strategies:**
    *   **Nutrient Management (based on soil test results):**
        *   **Phosphorus and Potassium:** Ensure adequate basal application of **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** or **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** and **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** as per soil test recommendations.
        *   **Boron:** If deficiency is suspected or confirmed, foliar spray 0.2% solution (2 g/L) of **Borax** or **Solubor** at the pre-flowering stage.
    *   **Water Management:** Maintain optimal soil moisture during flowering and pod development. Avoid water stress during these critical stages.
    *   **Temperature Management:** While direct control of temperature is difficult, timely sowing can help avoid peak high temperatures during the critical flowering period.
    *   **Pest Control:**
        *   **Thrips:** Monitor for thrips during flowering. If infestation is significant, spray **Imidacloprid** 0.3-0.5 ml/L or **Fipronil** 1.0-1.5 ml/L.
        *   **Pod Borers:** If pod borer activity is observed during flowering and pod formation, spray **Chlorantraniliprole** 0.1-0.15 ml/L or **Emamectin benzoate** 0.2 g/L.
