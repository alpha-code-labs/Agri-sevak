As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following doses of organic manures for Black Gram (Urd bean) cultivation in Haryana, based on scientific principles for improving soil health and crop productivity:

*   **Farmyard Manure (FYM):**
    *   Apply 5-10 tonnes per acre.
    *   Ensure the FYM is well-decomposed (at least 3-6 months old) to avoid nutrient immobilization and weed issues.
    *   It should be spread evenly across the field and thoroughly incorporated into the soil 2-3 weeks before sowing. This improves soil structure, water retention, and provides a slow-release source of macro and micronutrients.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   Apply 2-4 tonnes per acre.
    *   Vermicompost is richer in nutrients and beneficial microorganisms compared to FYM.
    *   It can be applied at the time of field preparation and incorporated into the soil, or as a top dressing during early growth stages.

*   **Sagarika:**
    *   Sagarika is a seaweed extract-based bio-stimulant, not a bulk organic manure like FYM or vermicompost. It enhances nutrient uptake, promotes root development, and improves plant vigour and stress tolerance.
    *   **Foliar Application (Liquid Sagarika):**
        *   Mix 2-3 ml of liquid Sagarika per litre of water.
        *   Apply as a foliar spray at critical growth stages:
            *   First spray: 20-30 days after sowing (at branching stage).
            *   Second spray: At pre-flowering stage.
            *   Third spray (optional): At pod development stage.
    *   **Soil Application (Granular Sagarika, e.g., Sagarika Z+):**
        *   If using granular forms, apply 8-16 kg per acre.
        *   This can be applied as a basal dose at the time of sowing or broadcasting and incorporated into the soil.

**General Recommendation:**
For optimal results, it is always advisable to get a soil test done to understand the specific nutrient status of your field. This allows for a more precise and balanced nutrient management plan, integrating organic manures with appropriate chemical fertilizers if required, to achieve maximum yield and maintain soil health.
