Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I emphasize that addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies in Black Gram (Urd bean) effectively begins with a thorough soil test. This provides precise information about your field's nutrient status, allowing for targeted and efficient fertilizer application.

Black Gram, being a leguminous crop, has specific nutrient requirements. While it fixes atmospheric nitrogen, balanced nutrition of Phosphorus and Potassium, along with an initial dose of Nitrogen, is crucial for optimal growth and yield.

Here's how to address macro-nutrient deficiencies:

### General Recommendations for Black Gram

*   **Soil Testing:** Always conduct a soil test before sowing to determine the exact nutrient status and tailor fertilizer recommendations.
*   **Balanced Fertilization:** Even if one nutrient is deficient, ensure other essential nutrients are available in adequate amounts for the plant to utilize the applied fertilizers efficiently.
*   **Biofertilizers:** Inoculation with Rhizobium culture is highly recommended for Black Gram to enhance nitrogen fixation. Apply 200-250 g of Rhizobium culture per 10-15 kg of seeds.

### Addressing Specific Macro-nutrient Deficiencies

#### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

Black Gram, being a legume, meets a significant portion of its nitrogen requirement through symbiotic nitrogen fixation. However, an initial dose of nitrogen is beneficial for early vigor before nodulation is fully established.

*   **Symptoms:** Pale green to yellowish leaves (especially older leaves), stunted growth, reduced branching, and overall poor plant vigor.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Basal Application (if not applied or insufficient):**
        *   Apply 15-20 kg Nitrogen per acre at the time of sowing. This can be achieved through:
            *   **Urea**: 30-45 kg/acre (provides 13.8-20.7 kg N/acre)
            *   **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)**: 35-45 kg/acre (provides 6.3-8.1 kg N/acre, along with Phosphorus)
    *   **Foliar Application (if severe deficiency appears after initial growth, indicating poor nodulation or very low soil N):**
        *   Spray 0.5-1.0% solution of **Urea** (5-10 g/L water). Use 200 L of solution per acre (1-2 kg Urea/acre). Apply during cooler parts of the day to avoid leaf burn. This is a temporary measure; addressing the root cause (e.g., poor nodulation) is essential.

#### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

Phosphorus is vital for root development, flowering, pod formation, and overall energy transfer within the plant.

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, dark green leaves that may sometimes develop a purplish tinge (less common in legumes), delayed flowering, poor root development, and reduced pod set.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Basal Application (most effective, as Phosphorus is immobile in soil):**
        *   Apply 40-60 kg P2O5 per acre at the time of sowing. This can be achieved through:
            *   **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)**: 85-130 kg/acre (provides 39-60 kg P2O5 and 15-23 kg N)
            *   **Single Superphosphate (SSP)**: 250-375 kg/acre (provides 40-60 kg P2O5)
    *   **Foliar Application (for immediate, temporary relief, but basal application is key):**
        *   Spray 1-2% solution of **Monoammonium Phosphate (MAP)** (10-20 g/L water). Use 200 L of solution per acre (2-4 kg MAP/acre).

#### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency

Potassium plays a crucial role in water regulation, nutrient transport, enzyme activation, disease resistance, and overall plant vigor.

*   **Symptoms:** Yellowing and scorching (browning) of leaf margins, especially on older leaves. Leaves may appear crinkled or curled. Plants may have weak stems and reduced resistance to lodging and diseases.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Basal Application:**
        *   Apply 20 kg K2O per acre at the time of sowing. This can be achieved through:
            *   **Muriate of Potash (MOP) / Potassium Chloride**: 35 kg/acre (provides 21 kg K2O)
            *   **Sulphate of Potash (SOP) / Potassium Sulphate**: 40 kg/acre (provides 20 kg K2O)
    *   **Foliar Application (for immediate relief):**
        *   Spray 0.5-1.0% solution of **Muriate of Potash (MOP) / Potassium Chloride** (5-10 g/L water) or **Sulphate of Potash (SOP) / Potassium Sulphate** (5-10 g/L water). Use 200 L of solution per acre (1-2 kg MOP/SOP per acre).

Remember, timely identification of deficiency symptoms and prompt corrective action, guided by soil test reports, are key to ensuring a healthy Black Gram crop and maximizing your yields. For any specific concerns, please consult your local agricultural extension officer.
