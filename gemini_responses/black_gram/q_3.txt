As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling various rot types in Black Gram (Urd bean) relevant to Haryana.

First, let's address the specific rot types you've mentioned:

*   **Black Rot:** This is not known to affect Black Gram.
*   **Fruit Rot:** This is not known to affect Black Gram. (Black Gram produces pods, and while pod rot can occur, "fruit rot" is not a standard disease term for it).
*   **Neck Rot:** While some stem rot symptoms can extend to the upper stem, "Neck Rot" as a distinct primary disease is not commonly recognized for Black Gram.

The other rot types – Root, Stem, Foot, Collar, Crown, Seed, and Seedling rot – are indeed significant issues in Black Gram cultivation. These are often caused by a complex of soil-borne fungal pathogens, primarily *Rhizoctonia solani*, *Sclerotium rolfsii*, *Fusarium oxysporum*, and *Macrophomina phaseolina*. These pathogens can cause damping-off (seedling rot), wilting, and eventual plant death.

Effective control requires an integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods.

### Integrated Management Strategies for Rot Diseases in Black Gram:

#### 1. Cultural Practices:
These practices aim to reduce pathogen inoculum and create an unfavorable environment for disease development.

*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice a 2-3 year rotation with non-host crops (e.g., cereals like wheat, maize) to reduce soil-borne inoculum. Avoid continuous cultivation of pulses.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris from the field after harvest.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** Expose soil-borne pathogens to sunlight during summer ploughing, which helps in reducing their population.
*   **Proper Drainage:** Ensure good field drainage to prevent waterlogging, which favors the development of many rot pathogens. Raised beds can be beneficial in areas prone to waterlogging.
*   **Optimum Sowing Time:** Sow seeds at the recommended time to avoid periods of high humidity and temperature that favor disease development.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced fertilizers. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can lead to lush growth susceptible to disease. Potash and phosphorus can improve plant vigor and resistance.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available, choose Black Gram varieties known for their tolerance or resistance to major rot diseases. Consult HAU for recommended varieties for Haryana.
*   **Optimum Plant Spacing:** Maintain recommended plant spacing to ensure good air circulation and reduce humidity within the canopy.

#### 2. Biological Control:
Enhancing beneficial microbial activity in the soil can suppress pathogenic fungi.

*   **Trichoderma Application:**
    *   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds with *Trichoderma viride* or *Trichoderma harzianum* @ 4-6 g/kg seed before sowing.
    *   **Soil Application:** Mix *Trichoderma viride* or *Trichoderma harzianum* @ 2.5 kg/acre with 50-100 kg of farmyard manure (FYM) or compost, and apply to the soil at the time of sowing or last ploughing.

#### 3. Chemical Control:
Chemical interventions are crucial, especially through seed treatment, to protect seeds and young seedlings.

*   **Seed Treatment (Most Critical Step):**
    Treating seeds before sowing is highly effective in preventing seed rot and seedling rot (damping-off) and providing initial protection against root and collar rots.
    *   **Carbendazim 50% WP:** @ 1-2 g/kg seed.
    *   **Thiram 75% WS:** @ 2-3 g/kg seed.
    *   **Carboxin 37.5% + Thiram 37.5% WS:** @ 2-3 g/kg seed. This combination provides broad-spectrum protection.
    *   **Tebuconazole 2% DS:** @ 1-1.5 g/kg seed.
    *   **Metalaxyl-M 31.8% ES:** @ 3 ml/kg seed (particularly effective against *Pythium* and *Phytophthora* species, which can cause damping-off).

*   **Soil Drenching (for established plants showing symptoms):**
    If symptoms of collar rot, foot rot, or root rot appear in the field, drenching the soil around the base of the affected plants can help.
    *   **Carbendazim 50% WP:** @ 1-2 g/L of water. Drench the soil around the base of the plants with approximately 200-250 L of solution per acre, depending on plant density and disease severity.
    *   **Validamycin 3% L:** @ 2-3 ml/L of water. Drench the soil around the base of the plants. This is particularly effective against *Rhizoctonia* species.
    *   **Pencycuron 23% SC:** @ 1-1.5 ml/L of water. Drench the soil around the base of the plants, specifically targeting *Rhizoctonia solani*.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the chemical label for dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in pathogens.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for the most current recommendations and specific product availability in your region.
