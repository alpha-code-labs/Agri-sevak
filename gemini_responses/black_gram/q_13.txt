As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm the following regarding your query:

*   **Fruit fly:** This is not known to affect Black Gram. Fruit flies (e.g., *Bactrocera* species) primarily infest fleshy fruits like mango, guava, cucurbits, etc., and are not significant pests of Black Gram pods.
*   **Ber fly:** This is not known to affect Black Gram. The Ber fruit fly (*Carpomyia vesuviana*) is a specific pest of Ber (Indian Jujube) fruits and does not infest Black Gram.
