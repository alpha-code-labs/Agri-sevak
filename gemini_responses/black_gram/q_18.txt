As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the use of Growth Regulators/Hormones in Black Gram (Urdbean) for Haryana:

*   **Ethephon (Ethrel is a trade name):**
    *   The use of **Ethephon** as a general growth regulator for yield enhancement in Black Gram is not a standard recommended practice by HAU or ICAR for farmers in Haryana. While it can be used for specific purposes like synchronous maturity or defoliation in some crops, its routine application for Black Gram as a growth regulator is not advised due to potential phytotoxicity and lack of consistent yield benefits under typical Haryana conditions. Therefore, no specific dose is recommended for this purpose.

*   **2,4-D:**
    *   **2,4-D** is a synthetic auxin primarily used as a selective herbicide for broadleaf weeds. Black Gram is a broadleaf crop, and the application of **2,4-D**, even at very low concentrations, is highly phytotoxic and detrimental to the crop. It can cause severe deformities, growth inhibition, and significant yield losses. Therefore, **2,4-D** is strictly *not recommended* for use as a growth regulator or for any other purpose in Black Gram.

*   **Boron:**
    *   Boron is an essential micronutrient crucial for flowering, pollen viability, and fruit/seed development in Black Gram. Foliar application of Boron is recommended, especially in areas prone to micronutrient deficiencies or when soil tests indicate low Boron levels.
    *   **Recommended Dose:**
        *   Foliar spray of **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate, containing 10.5-11% Boron) at 0.1% concentration (1 g/L of water).
        *   Alternatively, **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (Solubor, containing 17-20% Boron) at 0.05% concentration (0.5 g/L of water).
        *   **Timing:** Apply at the pre-flowering or early flowering stage. Use 200-250 litres of water per acre for thorough coverage.
