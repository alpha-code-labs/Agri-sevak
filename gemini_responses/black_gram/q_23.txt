As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified seed and soil treatment processes for Black Gram (Vigna mungo) cultivation in Haryana:

### Recommended Seed Treatment Process for Black Gram

Seed treatment is crucial for protecting young seedlings from seed-borne and soil-borne diseases and early-season insect pests, ensuring better germination and stand establishment.

1.  **Fungicidal Treatment:** To protect against seed-borne and soil-borne fungal diseases like damping-off, root rot, and collar rot.
    *   Option 1: Treat seeds with **Carbendazim** 12% + **Mancozeb** 63% WP (combination product) at 2.5 g/kg seed.
    *   Option 2: Alternatively, use **Thiram** 75% WS at 2.5 g/kg seed.
    *   Option 3: For specific root rot management, **Tebuconazole** 2% DS can be used at 1.25 g/kg seed.

2.  **Insecticidal Treatment (Optional, if early pest incidence is expected):** To protect against early season sucking pests like aphids, jassids, and thrips, which can cause significant damage to young seedlings.
    *   Option 1: Treat seeds with **Imidacloprid** 600 FS at 5-7 ml/kg seed.
    *   Option 2: Alternatively, use **Thiamethoxam** 30% FS at 10 ml/kg seed.

3.  **Bio-fertilizer Treatment:** Essential for improving nutrient availability and promoting plant growth, especially nitrogen fixation in legumes. Apply this treatment just before sowing.
    *   **Rhizobium** culture: 200 g per 10-15 kg seed.
    *   **PSB (Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria)** culture: 200 g per 10-15 kg seed.

**Application Sequence:**
*   First, treat the seeds with the chosen fungicide.
*   If using an insecticide, apply it after the fungicide.
*   Finally, apply the bio-fertilizers.
*   Allow the treated seeds to dry in the shade for a short period before sowing. This sequence ensures proper coating and viability of the bio-fertilizers.

### Recommended Soil Treatment Process for Black Gram

Soil treatment focuses on managing soil-borne diseases, pests, and improving soil health for optimal crop growth.

1.  **For Soil-borne Fungal Diseases (e.g., Root Rot, Wilt):**
    *   **Biological Control:** Apply **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum** (bio-fungicide) at 2.5 kg/acre. Mix the bio-fungicide thoroughly with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost. Broadcast this mixture evenly over the field and incorporate it into the soil during the final land preparation, ideally 7-10 days before sowing.

2.  **For Termites and White Grubs (if historically problematic in the field):**
    *   **Chemical Control:** Apply **Fipronil** 0.3% GR at 8-10 kg/acre. Broadcast the granules evenly across the field and incorporate them into the soil at the time of field preparation.

3.  **For Nematode Management (if nematode infestation is confirmed):**
    *   **Biological Control:** Apply **Paecilomyces lilacinus** (bio-nematicide) at 2.5 kg/acre. Mix it with 50-100 kg of FYM/compost and incorporate into the soil before sowing.
    *   *Note: Chemical nematicides are generally not recommended for routine use due to their toxicity and environmental impact. Their application should only be considered under severe, confirmed infestations and strict expert supervision.*
