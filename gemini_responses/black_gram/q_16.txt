As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified fertilizer doses for Black Gram (Urad Dal) in Haryana. These recommendations are general guidelines; a soil test is always advisable for precise nutrient management.

Black Gram, being a leguminous crop, fixes atmospheric nitrogen, thus requiring a lower initial nitrogen dose compared to non-legumes. Phosphorus, Potassium, and Sulphur are crucial for its growth and yield.

**General Nutrient Recommendation for Black Gram in Haryana:**
*   **Nitrogen (N):** 15-20 kg/acre
*   **Phosphorus (P2O5):** 40-60 kg/acre
*   **Potassium (K2O):** 20 kg/acre (apply based on soil test results)
*   **Sulphur (S):** 20 kg/acre

### **1. Basal Application (at the time of sowing):**

You can choose one of the following options to meet the N, P, K, and S requirements:

**Option A: Using Diammonium Phosphate (DAP) as the primary P source**

*   **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP):** 87 - 130 kg/acre
    *   *This provides 15.6 - 23.4 kg Nitrogen (N) and 40 - 60 kg Phosphorus (P2O5) per acre. The nitrogen supplied by DAP is generally sufficient as a starter dose for Black Gram.*
*   **Muriate of Potash (MOP):** 33 kg/acre
    *   *This provides 20 kg Potassium (K2O) per acre. Apply if soil test indicates deficiency.*
*   **Sulphur (S):**
    *   **Elemental Sulphur (90%):** 22 kg/acre OR
    *   **Gypsum:** 111 kg/acre
    *   *Either of these will provide approximately 20 kg Sulphur (S) per acre.*

**Option B: Using Single Super Phosphate (SSP) as the primary P and S source**

*   **Single Super Phosphate (SSP):** 250 - 375 kg/acre
    *   *This provides 40 - 60 kg Phosphorus (P2O5) and 27.5 - 41.25 kg Sulphur (S) per acre. The Sulphur requirement is met by SSP.*
*   **Urea:** 33 - 43 kg/acre
    *   *This provides 15 - 20 kg Nitrogen (N) per acre.*
*   **Muriate of Potash (MOP):** 33 kg/acre
    *   *This provides 20 kg Potassium (K2O) per acre. Apply if soil test indicates deficiency.*

**Option C: Using NPK Compound Fertilizers**

*   **NPK (12:32:16) Compound Fertilizer:** 125 - 188 kg/acre
    *   *This provides 15 - 22.5 kg Nitrogen (N), 40 - 60 kg Phosphorus (P2O5), and 20 - 30 kg Potassium (K2O) per acre.*
*   **Sulphur (S):**
    *   **Elemental Sulphur (90%):** 22 kg/acre OR
    *   **Gypsum:** 111 kg/acre
    *   *Either of these will provide approximately 20 kg Sulphur (S) per acre, as most NPK compound fertilizers do not contain sufficient Sulphur for Black Gram.*

### **2. Foliar Application (Supplementary):**

Nano-fertilizers are recommended as supplementary foliar sprays at critical growth stages to enhance nutrient use efficiency and yield.

*   **Nano-Urea:**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml/L of water.
    *   **Application:** 1-2 sprays.
        *   First spray: At the pre-flowering stage (around 30-40 days after sowing).
        *   Second spray: At the pod development stage (around 50-60 days after sowing).
*   **Nano-DAP:**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml/L of water.
    *   **Application:** 1-2 sprays.
        *   First spray: At the pre-flowering stage.
        *   Second spray: At the pod development stage.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Soil Testing:** Always conduct a soil test to determine the exact nutrient status of your field. This will help in fine-tuning the fertilizer doses and avoiding over or under-application.
*   **Micronutrients:** In addition to NPK and S, Zinc deficiency is common in Haryana soils. If a soil test indicates Zinc deficiency, apply **Zinc Sulphate (33% Zn)** at 10 kg/acre as a basal application or a foliar spray of 0.5% solution (5g/L water) at 30 and 45 days after sowing.
*   **Application Method:** Basal fertilizers should be broadcast evenly and incorporated into the soil before sowing or applied in furrows at the time of sowing. Foliar sprays should be done in the morning or evening hours.
