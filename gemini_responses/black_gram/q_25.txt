As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I advise on the following irrigation management practices for Black Gram (Urad Dal) in Haryana:

Black gram is a relatively drought-tolerant crop, but timely and judicious irrigation at critical growth stages is crucial for maximizing yield, especially given the varying rainfall patterns in Haryana. Over-irrigation must be avoided as black gram is highly sensitive to waterlogging.

**General Principles:**
*   Ensure good field drainage to prevent waterlogging.
*   The most critical stages for irrigation are flowering and pod development.

**First Irrigation:**
*   **Timing:** The first irrigation is typically required around **25-30 days after sowing (DAS)**. This coincides with the branching and early vegetative growth stage.
*   **Considerations:**
    *   If there are sufficient pre-sowing rains or adequate soil moisture at sowing, this irrigation might be delayed or even skipped.
    *   If a dry spell occurs after sowing and soil moisture is depleting, this irrigation becomes essential for robust vegetative growth.
    *   Avoid irrigation immediately after sowing unless absolutely necessary for germination, as it can lead to soil crusting and hinder seedling emergence.

**Second Irrigation and Subsequent Irrigations:**
*   **Timing:** The most critical irrigation for black gram is usually given around **45-50 DAS**. This period corresponds to the pre-flowering to early flowering stage, which is vital for flower initiation, pod setting, and ultimately, yield.
*   **Third Irrigation (if needed):** If there is a prolonged dry spell and the crop experiences moisture stress, a third light irrigation may be beneficial during the **pod filling stage (around 60-70 DAS)**. This helps in proper seed development and ensures plump, well-filled pods.
*   **Frequency:** The total number of irrigations (typically 1-3, apart from monsoon rains) depends heavily on:
    *   Rainfall received during the crop cycle.
    *   Soil type (sandy soils require more frequent but lighter irrigations than heavier clay soils).
    *   Prevailing weather conditions (temperature, humidity).
*   **Water Quantity:** Apply light irrigations, typically around **40-50 mm** depth, to ensure adequate moisture without causing waterlogging.

**Sprinkler Use:**
Sprinkler irrigation is highly recommended for black gram cultivation in Haryana due to its numerous advantages:

*   **Water Use Efficiency:** Sprinklers apply water uniformly and efficiently, significantly reducing water wastage compared to traditional flood irrigation. This is vital for water conservation in the region.
*   **Prevention of Waterlogging:** It allows for precise control over the amount of water applied, preventing over-irrigation and the waterlogging conditions that black gram is sensitive to.
*   **Improved Germination:** Light sprinkler irrigation can aid in uniform seed germination without causing soil crusting, which can be an issue with flood irrigation.
*   **Nutrient Retention:** Minimizes the leaching of essential nutrients from the root zone.
*   **Microclimate Modification:** Can help in moderating canopy temperature during hot periods.
*   **Application:**
    *   Use low-pressure sprinklers or micro-sprinklers for optimal results.
    *   Apply water at a rate that the soil can absorb without runoff.
    *   The timing for sprinkler application should follow the critical stages mentioned above: 25-30 DAS, 45-50 DAS, and 60-70 DAS (if required).
