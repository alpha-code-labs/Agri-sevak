As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I will provide scientifically verified advice for controlling these conditions in Black Gram (Urdbean) in Haryana.

It is important to understand that "physical damage" can be a broad term. I will address each specific condition you mentioned:

### 1. Fruit Bursting (Pod Shattering)

Pod shattering is a significant issue in Black Gram, leading to considerable yield losses.

*   **Causes:** This is primarily a genetic trait, but it is exacerbated by environmental factors such as rapid drying of pods after rain, fluctuating humidity, and delayed harvesting. Boron deficiency can sometimes contribute to poor pod wall integrity.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Varietal Selection:** Choose improved varieties recommended by HAU that possess genetic resistance or tolerance to pod shattering.
    *   **Timely Harvesting:** Harvest the crop when 70-80% of the pods have matured and changed colour (typically blackish-brown). Avoid delaying harvest, especially during periods of high temperature fluctuations or intermittent rainfall, as this increases the risk of shattering.
    *   **Irrigation Management:** Ensure adequate moisture during pod development but reduce irrigation as the crop approaches maturity to promote uniform drying and prevent rapid re-wetting of pods.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** If soil tests indicate Boron deficiency, which can affect cell wall integrity and pod development:
        *   Apply **Borax (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate)** at 10-15 kg/acre as a soil application before sowing.
        *   Alternatively, a foliar spray of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (20% B) at 1-1.5 g/L water can be applied at the pre-flowering and pod development stages.

### 2. Leaf Burning/Melting

"Leaf burning" or "melting" is a symptom rather than a specific condition and can be caused by various abiotic (environmental) or biotic (disease/pest) factors. Accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective management.

*   **Potential Causes:**
    *   **Abiotic Stresses:**
        *   **Heat Stress:** Extremely high temperatures can cause scorching.
        *   **Drought Stress:** Severe water scarcity leads to desiccation and burning of leaf margins.
        *   **Waterlogging:** Can cause root damage, leading to leaf yellowing and necrosis (burning).
        *   **Nutrient Toxicity/Deficiency:** E.g., salinity, boron toxicity, severe potassium deficiency.
        *   **Chemical Phytotoxicity:** Improper application of herbicides (drift), insecticides, or fungicides (wrong dose, wrong time, incompatible mixtures) can cause chemical burns.
        *   **Sun Scald:** Sudden exposure to intense sunlight after a period of cloudy weather.
    *   **Biotic Stresses:**
        *   **Fungal Diseases:** Severe infections of diseases like Anthracnose, Cercospora leaf spot, or Rust can lead to extensive necrosis and a "burnt" appearance.
        *   **Bacterial Diseases:** Bacterial blight can cause water-soaked lesions that turn necrotic.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Accurate Diagnosis:** Carefully observe the pattern of damage, recent weather conditions, and any field activities (e.g., spraying) to identify the specific cause. If unsure, consult with HAU experts.
    *   **Abiotic Stress Management:**
        *   **Heat/Drought:** Provide timely and adequate irrigation, especially during critical growth stages. Consider mulching to conserve soil moisture and moderate soil temperature.
        *   **Chemical Phytotoxicity:** Always adhere to recommended doses and application guidelines for all agrochemicals. Avoid spraying during high temperatures or strong winds. Ensure proper calibration of sprayers.
        *   **Nutrient Imbalance:** Conduct soil testing to identify specific deficiencies or toxicities and apply balanced fertilizers as per recommendations.
    *   **Biotic Stress Management (if disease is identified):**
        *   **Fungal Diseases:** If a fungal infection is confirmed, apply appropriate fungicides. For example:
            *   **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L water.
            *   **Carbendazim** at 0.5 g/L water.
            *   **Propiconazole** at 1 ml/L water.
        *   **Bacterial Diseases:** If bacterial blight is confirmed:
            *   **Streptomycin sulphate 90% + Tetracycline hydrochloride 10% SP** (antibiotic mixture) at 6 g/10 L water.
            *   **Copper oxychloride** at 2.5 g/L water.

### 3. Hardness in Fruit (Referring to Seed Hardness/Hard-to-Cook Phenomenon)

This term typically refers to issues related to seed quality rather than the pod (fruit) itself in the field.

*   **Potential Causes:**
    *   **Hard Seed Coat (Physical Dormancy):** This is a genetic trait where the seed coat is impermeable to water, preventing uniform germination. This is a seed quality issue affecting planting, not a "fruit" issue during growth.
    *   **Hard-to-Cook (HTC) Phenomenon:** This occurs post-harvest during storage, especially under high temperature and high humidity conditions. It makes the seeds difficult to cook and reduces their market value. This is a storage quality issue.
    *   **Drought Stress:** Severe drought during the pod filling stage can lead to smaller, denser, and potentially harder seeds.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Hard Seed Coat (for planting):**
        *   **Varietal Selection:** Choose varieties known to have a lower percentage of hard seeds for better germination uniformity.
        *   **Seed Treatment:** Mechanical scarification (light scratching of the seed coat) can improve germination, but this is typically done by seed producers or before sowing.
    *   **Hard-to-Cook (Post-harvest):**
        *   **Proper Storage:** Store harvested and dried Black Gram seeds in cool, dry conditions (low temperature and low humidity) to prevent the development of the Hard-to-Cook phenomenon.
    *   **Drought Stress (during crop growth):**
        *   **Timely Irrigation:** Ensure adequate moisture availability, especially during the critical pod development and seed filling stages, to promote proper seed development and quality. Avoid prolonged drought periods.
