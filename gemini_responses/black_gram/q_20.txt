As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I advise that addressing micronutrient deficiencies in Black Gram (Urdbean) is crucial for optimal growth and yield. The first and most important step is always a comprehensive soil test to accurately diagnose specific deficiencies and their severity. Based on the soil test results, the following scientifically verified recommendations can be adopted for Haryana conditions:

**General Recommendations:**
*   **Soil Testing:** Always conduct a soil test before applying any micronutrients to determine the exact deficiency and required dosage.
*   **Foliar Application:** Foliar sprays are generally more efficient for quick correction of micronutrient deficiencies, especially during critical growth stages.
*   **Timing:** Apply foliar sprays during cool parts of the day (morning or late afternoon) to maximize absorption and minimize leaf scorching.
*   **Water Quality:** Use clean water for preparing spray solutions.

Here's how to address specific micronutrient deficiencies:

### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, small leaves (little leaf symptom), delayed maturity.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.5% solution of **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (5 g/L water) or 0.1% solution of **Zinc EDTA** (1 g/L water). Apply 2-3 times at 10-15 day intervals, starting 30-40 days after sowing or upon appearance of symptoms.
    *   **Soil Application:** If soil test indicates severe deficiency, apply 10-25 kg/acre of **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** at the time of sowing, once every 2-3 years.

### 2. Iron (Fe) / Ferrous Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Severe interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, which may turn almost white, while veins remain green.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.5-1.0% solution of **Ferrous sulphate heptahydrate** (5-10 g/L water) or 0.1% solution of **Ferrous EDTA** (1 g/L water). Apply 2-3 times at 10-15 day intervals, starting when symptoms appear. Foliar application is generally more effective in alkaline soils of Haryana where soil-applied iron quickly becomes unavailable.
    *   **Soil Application:** Not commonly recommended for pulses in Haryana due to high soil pH limiting iron availability.

### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, death of growing points, malformed leaves, poor flower and pod set, hollow stems, and sometimes cracking of pods.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.1-0.2% solution of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (1-2 g/L water) or 0.2% solution of **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate) (2 g/L water). Apply at pre-flowering and pod development stages.
    *   **Soil Application:** If severe deficiency is confirmed by soil test, apply 0.5-1 kg/acre of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** or 1-2 kg/acre of **Borax** at sowing, once every 3-4 years. **Caution:** Boron has a narrow range between deficiency and toxicity; avoid over-application.

### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Death of growing points, young leaves distorted or curled, poor root development, and poor pod filling.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.5-1.0% solution of **Calcium chloride** (5-10 g/L water) or **Calcium nitrate** (5-10 g/L water). Apply during flowering and pod development stages.
    *   **Soil Application:** For general soil health improvement and calcium supply, especially in sodic soils prevalent in parts of Haryana, apply **Gypsum** (Calcium sulphate dihydrate) at 200-500 kg/acre as per soil test recommendations.

### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves (veins remain green), leaves may become brittle and curl upwards.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.5-1.0% solution of **Magnesium sulphate heptahydrate** (5-10 g/L water). Apply when symptoms appear, repeat if necessary.
    *   **Soil Application:** If soil test indicates deficiency, apply 10-20 kg/acre of **Magnesium sulphate heptahydrate** at sowing.

### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, often appearing as a "netting" pattern, sometimes with brown spots.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.5% solution of **Manganese sulphate monohydrate** (5 g/L water). Apply 2-3 times at 10-15 day intervals, starting when symptoms appear.
    *   **Soil Application:** In soils with confirmed deficiency, especially high pH soils where Mn availability is low, apply 10-20 kg/acre of **Manganese sulphate monohydrate** at sowing.

Always consult with local agricultural extension specialists for precise recommendations tailored to your specific field conditions and soil test reports.
