As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Black Gram (Vigna mungo) in Haryana.

Let's address each condition you've listed:

*   **Alternaria Leaf Spot:** This is known to affect Black Gram.
*   **Anthracnose:** This is known to affect Black Gram.
*   **Blast:** This is not known to affect Black Gram as a primary disease.
*   **Blight (e.g., Alternaria Blight, Cercospora Blight):** Various blights are known to affect Black Gram.
*   **Brown Spot (e.g., Cercospora Leaf Spot):** This is known to affect Black Gram.
*   **Downy Mildew:** This is not known to affect Black Gram as a significant disease.
*   **Powdery Mildew:** This is known to affect Black Gram and is a major concern.
*   **Grey Mildew:** This is not known to affect Black Gram.

For the diseases that affect Black Gram (Alternaria Leaf Spot, Anthracnose, Blight, Brown Spot, and Powdery Mildew), an integrated approach combining cultural practices and timely chemical intervention is most effective.

### General Management Practices (Cultural Control):

1.  **Resistant Varieties:** Whenever possible, choose Black Gram varieties known for their resistance or tolerance to common fungal diseases in your region. Consult HAU's latest recommendations for suitable varieties.
2.  **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops to reduce inoculum build-up in the soil.
3.  **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest to reduce primary inoculum sources.
4.  **Optimum Plant Spacing:** Ensure proper plant spacing to allow for good air circulation, which helps reduce humidity and fungal growth.
5.  **Balanced Nutrition:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, as it can make plants more susceptible to fungal diseases. Provide balanced nutrients based on soil test recommendations.
6.  **Timely Sowing:** Sow at the recommended time to avoid periods of high disease pressure.

### Chemical Control:

Chemical control involves both seed treatment for early protection and foliar sprays for managing established infections.

#### 1. Seed Treatment:

Seed treatment is crucial for protecting seedlings from soil-borne and seed-borne pathogens, providing early vigor and disease resistance.

*   **Carbendazim** 12% + **Mancozeb** 63% WP @ 2.5-3.0 g/kg seed
*   **Thiram** 75% WS @ 2.5-3.0 g/kg seed
*   **Carbendazim** 50% WP @ 1.0-2.0 g/kg seed

#### 2. Foliar Sprays:

Foliar sprays should be applied preventively if disease conditions are favorable, or at the first appearance of symptoms. Repeat sprays may be necessary depending on disease severity and weather conditions. Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.

**For Alternaria Leaf Spot, Anthracnose, Blight, and Brown Spot:**
These diseases often respond to broad-spectrum fungicides.

*   **Mancozeb** 75% WP @ 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L water)
*   **Chlorothalonil** 75% WP @ 2.0 kg/acre (or 2.0 g/L water)
*   **Carbendazim** 50% WP @ 500 g/acre (or 0.5 g/L water)
*   **Thiophanate Methyl** 70% WP @ 500 g/acre (or 0.5 g/L water)
*   **Propiconazole** 25% EC @ 200 ml/acre (or 0.2 ml/L water)
*   **Tebuconazole** 25% EC @ 200-300 ml/acre (or 0.2-0.3 ml/L water)
*   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC @ 200 ml/acre (or 0.2 ml/L water)
*   **Pyraclostrobin** 13.3% + **Metiram** 55% WG @ 1.5 kg/acre (or 1.5 g/L water)
*   **Azoxystrobin** 18.2% + **Difenoconazole** 11.4% SC @ 200 ml/acre (or 0.2 ml/L water)

**For Powdery Mildew:**
This disease is particularly common and can be effectively managed with specific fungicides.

*   **Sulphur** 80% WP @ 2.0-2.5 kg/acre (or 2.0-2.5 g/L water)
*   **Carbendazim** 50% WP @ 500 g/acre (or 0.5 g/L water)
*   **Thiophanate Methyl** 70% WP @ 500 g/acre (or 0.5 g/L water)
*   **Propiconazole** 25% EC @ 200 ml/acre (or 0.2 ml/L water)
*   **Tebuconazole** 25% EC @ 200-300 ml/acre (or 0.2-0.3 ml/L water)
*   **Myclobutanil** 10% WP @ 200 g/acre (or 0.2 g/L water)
*   **Penconazole** 10% EC @ 100 ml/acre (or 0.1 ml/L water)

### Important Considerations:

*   **Rotation of Fungicides:** To prevent the development of fungicide resistance, it is crucial to rotate fungicides with different modes of action. Do not rely solely on one chemical group.
*   **Timing of Application:** Early detection and timely application are key to effective disease management.
*   **Water Volume:** Ensure adequate water volume for thorough spray coverage, typically 200-300 litres per acre, depending on crop canopy.
*   **Safety Precautions:** Always read and follow the instructions on the fungicide label, including recommended dosage, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and personal protective equipment (PPE).

For specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and the prevailing disease situation, it is always advisable to consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts.
