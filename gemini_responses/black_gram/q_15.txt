As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in Black Gram (Urad Dal) in Haryana:

### Control of Grasshopper in Black Gram

Grasshoppers are polyphagous pests that can cause significant defoliation in Black Gram, especially during early crop stages.

**Cultural Control:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Keep the field and surrounding areas free of weeds, which can serve as alternate hosts for grasshoppers.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** Deep summer ploughing helps expose grasshopper eggs laid in the soil to predators and harsh weather conditions, reducing their population in the subsequent season.

**Chemical Control:**
If grasshopper infestation is severe (e.g., more than 2-3 grasshoppers per square meter or significant defoliation), chemical intervention may be necessary. Apply the insecticide as a foliar spray, ensuring good coverage.

*   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5 EC: 200-250 ml per acre in 200-400 litres of water.
*   **Quinalphos** 25 EC: 1000-1500 ml per acre in 200-400 litres of water.

### Control of Painted bug, Red cotton bug, and Black ants in Black Gram

*   **Painted bug (Bagrada hilaris):** This is not known to affect Black Gram as a significant pest. It is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops like mustard, radish, and cabbage.
*   **Red cotton bug (Dysdercus cingulatus):** This is not known to affect Black Gram. It is primarily a pest of cotton and other malvaceous plants.
*   **Black ants:** This is not known to affect Black Gram as a direct pest causing economic damage. Ants are generally not considered primary pests of Black Gram.
