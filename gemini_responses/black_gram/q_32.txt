Drying up (drying branches, leaves, fruits, and flowers) in Black Gram (Vigna mungo) is a symptom that can be caused by a variety of factors, including fungal diseases, insect pests, and abiotic stresses. Accurate identification of the underlying cause is crucial for effective management.

Here's how to address the common causes of "drying up" in Black Gram:

### 1. Fungal Diseases

Several fungal diseases can lead to wilting and drying of plant parts.

*   **Wilt/Root Rot/Collar Rot (e.g., Fusarium wilt, Sclerotium rolfsii, Rhizoctonia solani):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Plants show sudden wilting, yellowing, and drying of leaves, often starting from the lower leaves or one side of the plant. The entire plant may eventually dry up. Roots or the collar region (stem base) may show discoloration or rotting.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Preventive:** Use resistant varieties, practice crop rotation, ensure good drainage. Seed treatment is highly recommended.
        *   **Chemical Control (for standing crop, if symptoms are localized and early):**
            *   Drench the soil around affected plants with a fungicide solution.
            *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 1-2 g/L of water.
            *   **Propiconazole** 25% EC at 1 ml/L of water.
            *   **Tebuconazole** 250 EC at 1 ml/L of water.
*   **Anthracnose (Colletotrichum truncatum):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Dark, sunken lesions with reddish-brown margins appear on leaves, stems, and pods, leading to drying and defoliation. Pods may shrivel and dry prematurely.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Preventive:** Use disease-free seeds, practice crop rotation, remove plant debris.
        *   **Chemical Control:**
            *   Spray with a systemic or contact fungicide.
            *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 1-2 g/L of water.
            *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP at 2-2.5 g/L of water.
            *   **Propiconazole** 25% EC at 1 ml/L of water.
*   **Powdery Mildew (Erysiphe polygoni):**
    *   **Symptoms:** White, powdery patches appear on leaves, stems, and pods. Severe infection leads to yellowing, premature drying, and defoliation, affecting pod development.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Chemical Control:**
            *   Spray with a suitable fungicide.
            *   **Sulphur** 80% WP at 2-2.5 g/L of water.
            *   **Myclobutanil** 10% WP at 0.5 g/L of water.
            *   **Hexaconazole** 5% EC at 1 ml/L of water.

### 2. Insect Pests

Severe infestations of certain insect pests can cause significant damage leading to drying of plant parts.

*   **Sucking Pests (Aphids, Jassids, Thrips, Whiteflies):**
    *   **Symptoms:** These pests suck sap from leaves, stems, and flowers, causing curling, crinkling, yellowing, and eventual drying of affected parts. Severe infestations can lead to stunted growth and premature drying of the entire plant. Whiteflies also transmit Yellow Mosaic Virus (YMV), which causes yellowing and stunting, indirectly affecting plant health.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Preventive:** Monitor fields regularly, use yellow sticky traps for whiteflies.
        *   **Chemical Control:**
            *   Spray with a systemic insecticide.
            *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL at 0.5 ml/L of water.
            *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG at 0.2 g/L of water.
            *   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP at 0.2 g/L of water.
            *   **Flonicamid** 50% WG at 0.3 g/L of water.
*   **Stem Fly (Ophiomyia phaseoli) / Girdle Beetle (Oberea brevis):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Stem fly larvae bore into the stem, causing the central shoot to wilt and dry. Girdle beetle larvae girdle the stem, leading to wilting and drying of the plant parts above the girdle.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Chemical Control (early stage):**
            *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC at 0.3 ml/L of water.
            *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG at 0.2 g/L of water (as a foliar spray or seed treatment).

### 3. Abiotic Stresses

These are non-biological factors that can cause drying. Chemical solutions are not applicable here, but management practices are crucial.

*   **Drought Stress:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Leaves wilt, turn yellow, and eventually dry up, often starting from the margins. Flowers and pods may drop prematurely.
    *   **Management:** Provide timely and adequate irrigation, especially during critical growth stages (flowering and pod development).
*   **Waterlogging:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Roots are deprived of oxygen, leading to root rot, yellowing, wilting, and drying of the entire plant.
    *   **Management:** Ensure proper field drainage. Avoid sowing in low-lying areas prone to water accumulation.
*   **Heat Stress:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Scorching of leaves, flower drop, and poor pod set, leading to premature drying of plant parts.
    *   **Management:** Choose heat-tolerant varieties, adjust sowing time to avoid peak heat periods.

### General Recommendations:

*   **Accurate Diagnosis:** Before applying any chemical, it is essential to correctly identify the specific disease or pest causing the drying. Consult with local agricultural experts or HAU extension services if unsure.
*   **Integrated Pest and Disease Management (IPDM):** Combine cultural practices (crop rotation, resistant varieties, field sanitation), biological control, and judicious use of chemicals.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris to reduce inoculum sources.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure the crop receives adequate and balanced nutrients to enhance its natural resistance.
*   **Water Management:** Maintain optimal soil moisture levels.
*   **Follow Label Instructions:** Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the chemical product label for dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   **Rotate Chemicals:** To prevent the development of resistance, rotate fungicides and insecticides with different modes of action.
