As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the suitable climate, soil type, and drainage requirements for Black Gram (Urd bean) in Haryana:

**Climate:**
*   Black Gram is primarily a warm-season crop, well-suited for the Kharif season in Haryana.
*   **Temperature:** It thrives in warm temperatures, with an optimal range for growth and development between 25°C and 35°C. Temperatures below 15°C or above 40°C can adversely affect growth and pod setting.
*   **Rainfall:** Requires moderate rainfall, typically 600-900 mm, well-distributed throughout its growing period. Excessive rainfall, especially during flowering and pod development, can be detrimental.
*   **Humidity:** Prefers moderate to high humidity during its vegetative growth phase.

**Soil Type:**
*   Black Gram is adaptable but performs best in well-drained, fertile soils.
*   **Texture:** Ideal soil types include loamy to sandy loam soils. It can also be grown on medium black soils, provided they have good drainage.
*   **pH:** Prefers a soil pH range of 6.0 to 7.5 (slightly acidic to neutral).
*   **Avoidance:** Highly alkaline, saline, or waterlogged soils are unsuitable as they severely impede growth and yield.

**Drainage Requirement:**
*   **Critical:** Black Gram is highly sensitive to waterlogging.
*   **Excellent Drainage:** It requires excellent soil drainage. Standing water, even for a short duration (e.g., 24-48 hours), can cause significant damage to the root system, leading to yellowing, wilting, and severe yield reduction.
*   **Field Preparation:** Proper land preparation, including leveling and ensuring adequate surface drainage, is crucial, especially in areas prone to heavy rainfall during the Kharif season. Raised beds or ridges can be beneficial in such conditions to prevent water accumulation around the root zone.
