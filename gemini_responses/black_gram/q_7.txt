As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm the following regarding the diseases mentioned for Black Gram (Vigna mungo):

*   **Dieback:** This is not known to affect Black Gram as a specific disease. Dieback typically refers to the progressive death of twigs and branches, starting from the tips, and is more commonly associated with woody plants or perennial crops. In herbaceous annuals like Black Gram, general plant decline or wilting might be observed due to various factors (e.g., root rot, stem rot, nutrient deficiencies, water stress), but "Dieback" is not a recognized primary disease name.

*   **Twig blight:** This is not known to affect Black Gram. Twig blight is a disease primarily affecting woody plants, trees, and shrubs, causing the death of twigs. Black Gram is an herbaceous plant and does not have "twigs" in the conventional sense.

*   **Tikka disease:** This is not known to affect Black Gram. Tikka disease is a well-known and specific leaf spot disease of Groundnut (Peanut), caused by *Cercospora arachidicola* and *Phaeoisariopsis personata*. It does not affect Black Gram. Black Gram has its own set of leaf spot diseases (e.g., Cercospora leaf spot, Alternaria leaf spot, Anthracnose), but Tikka disease is not one of them.
