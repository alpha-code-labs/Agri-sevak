As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Dieback, Twig blight, and Tikka disease in DatePalm in Haryana.

### Control of Dieback and Twig Blight in DatePalm

Dieback and Twig blight are often symptoms of various stresses or fungal infections, commonly caused by pathogens like *Lasiodiplodia theobromae* (formerly *Botryodiplodia theobromae*) or *Fusarium* species, especially under conditions of stress (e.g., water stress, nutrient deficiency, wounds).

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**

*   **Pruning:**
    *   Immediately remove all affected branches, twigs, and fronds. Cut well into the healthy wood (at least 15-30 cm beyond the visible symptoms) to ensure complete removal of the pathogen.
    *   Sterilize pruning tools (e.g., with 10% bleach solution or methylated spirit) before and after each cut to prevent disease spread.
    *   Destroy all pruned material by burning or burying it away from the orchard.
*   **Wound Protection:**
    *   Apply a protective fungicidal paste (e.g., Bordeaux paste or a paste made with a systemic fungicide) to large pruning cuts to prevent new infections.
*   **Orchard Sanitation:**
    *   Regularly remove dead plant material, fallen leaves, and weeds from the base of the palms to reduce inoculum sources.
*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Ensure balanced fertilization based on soil test reports to maintain tree vigour and improve resistance to stress and diseases.
*   **Irrigation Management:**
    *   Provide adequate and timely irrigation, especially during dry periods, to avoid water stress, which can predispose palms to dieback. Avoid overwatering, which can lead to root rot.

**2. Chemical Control (Fungicides):**

For effective management, especially if the disease is widespread or persistent, fungicidal applications can be beneficial.

*   **Foliar Spray/Drench:**
    *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: Apply at a rate of 1 gram per litre of water. Spray thoroughly to cover the affected parts and surrounding healthy foliage, or drench around the base of the palm for systemic action.
    *   **Propiconazole** 25% EC: Apply at a rate of 1 ml per litre of water. Ensure good coverage of the canopy.
    *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC: Apply at a rate of 0.5-1 ml per litre of water. This broad-spectrum fungicide can be effective against various fungal pathogens.

*   **Application Frequency:**
    *   Repeat applications as per the product label recommendations, typically every 10-15 days, depending on disease severity and environmental conditions, until symptoms subside.

### Control of Tikka Disease in DatePalm

This is not known to affect DatePalm. Tikka disease is primarily a leaf spot disease of groundnut (peanut) caused by *Cercospora arachidicola* and *Phaeoisariopsis personata*. DatePalm is not a host for these pathogens.
