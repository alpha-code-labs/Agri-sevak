नमस्ते! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in DatePalm (Phoenix dactylifera) in Haryana.

DatePalm can be affected by various fungal diseases, especially under conditions of high humidity or during specific growth stages. Effective management involves a combination of cultural practices and timely application of CIBRC-approved fungicides.

Here's the guidance for the diseases you've mentioned:

1.  **Alternaria Leaf Spot/Blight (*Alternaria alternata*)**
    This disease causes small, dark brown to black spots on leaves, which can enlarge and coalesce, leading to blight symptoms and premature drying of fronds.

2.  **Anthracnose (*Colletotrichum gloeosporioides*)**
    Anthracnose can affect leaves, fruits, and inflorescences, causing sunken, dark lesions. Under humid conditions, pinkish spore masses may be visible on these lesions.

3.  **Blight (General Fungal Blight)**
    Various fungi can cause blight symptoms on DatePalm leaves and fronds, leading to necrosis and dieback. This often overlaps with diseases like Alternaria leaf spot.

4.  **Brown Spot (*Cercospora* spp.)**
    Characterized by small, circular to irregular brown spots on leaves, often with a yellowish halo. Severe infections can lead to defoliation.

**Control Measures for Alternaria, Anthracnose, Blight, and Brown Spot:**

**A. Cultural Practices (Preventive and Management):**

*   **Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy infected leaves, fronds, and fallen plant debris from the orchard. This significantly reduces the source of fungal inoculum.
*   **Pruning:** Ensure proper and timely pruning of old and diseased fronds to improve air circulation within the canopy. This helps reduce humidity, which is conducive to fungal growth.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Maintain optimal plant health through balanced fertilization. Healthy plants are generally more resilient to disease attacks.
*   **Irrigation:** Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day, as it can keep foliage wet for extended periods, promoting fungal development. Drip irrigation is preferred.
*   **Spacing:** Maintain adequate plant spacing to ensure good air movement throughout the orchard.

**B. Chemical Control (Fungicides):**

Apply fungicides preventively during periods conducive to disease development (e.g., high humidity, monsoon season) or at the first sign of symptoms. Always ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.

*   **For broad-spectrum protection and contact action:**
    *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP at 2.5 kg per acre (or 2.5 grams per litre of water).
    *   **Copper Oxychloride** 50% WP at 3 kg per acre (or 3 grams per litre of water).

*   **For systemic action and curative properties:**
    *   **Carbendazim** 12% + **Mancozeb** 63% WP at 2.5 kg per acre (or 2.5 grams per litre of water).
    *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC at 0.5-1 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Propiconazole** 25% EC at 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Tebuconazole** 25.9% EC at 0.75-1 ml per litre of water.

**Important:** Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in fungal populations. Always read and strictly follow the label instructions of any pesticide product for correct dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).

**Regarding other diseases mentioned:**

*   **Blast:** This is not known to affect DatePalm as a specific disease name.
*   **Downy Mildew:** This is not known to affect DatePalm as a significant disease.
*   **Powdery Mildew:** This is not known to affect DatePalm as a significant disease.
*   **Grey Mildew:** This is not known to affect DatePalm.
