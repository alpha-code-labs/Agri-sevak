As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned conditions in Date Palm in Haryana:

### Scab

This is not known to affect DatePalm.

### Canker

This is not known to affect DatePalm.

### Gummosis

Gummosis in Date Palm is typically a symptom rather than a specific disease itself. It involves the exudation of gum from the trunk or other parts of the palm. It can be caused by various factors, including fungal infections, physiological stress, or mechanical injuries.

**Control Measures:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy severely affected fronds or fruit stalks to reduce inoculum.
    *   **Wound Care:** Avoid mechanical injuries to the trunk and fronds. If wounds occur, clean them and apply a protective fungicidal paste.
    *   **Proper Irrigation:** Ensure adequate but not excessive irrigation. Waterlogging can stress palms and predispose them to disease.
    *   **Drainage:** Improve soil drainage to prevent water accumulation around the base of the palm.
    *   **Nutrition:** Provide balanced nutrition to maintain palm vigor, making them more resistant to stress and disease.

2.  **Chemical Control (if fungal infection is suspected):**
    *   If gummosis is associated with fungal lesions (e.g., discolored bark, rotting tissue), physical removal of the affected tissue followed by fungicidal application is recommended.
    *   **Scraping:** Carefully scrape off the affected bark and gum until healthy tissue is exposed. Disinfect tools between palms.
    *   **Application:** Apply a fungicidal paste or spray to the scraped area and surrounding healthy tissue.
    *   **Fungicides:**
        *   **Copper Oxychloride:** Apply as a paste (mix 50 g of **Copper Oxychloride** with a small amount of water to form a thick paste) directly to the scraped area. For general trunk spray, use 3 g/L of water.
        *   **Mancozeb:** For general protective spray, use 2.5 g/L of water, ensuring good coverage of the trunk and crown.
        *   **Carbendazim:** For systemic action, drench the base of the palm or spray the trunk with 1 g/L of water.
        *   **Propiconazole:** For systemic action, spray the affected areas and trunk at 0.5 ml/L of water.

    *   **Frequency:** Repeat applications as per product label or based on disease severity, typically every 15-30 days during periods of high humidity or disease pressure.

### Lichen

Lichens are symbiotic organisms (a fungus and an alga) that grow on the surface of tree trunks and branches. They are epiphytes, meaning they grow *on* the plant but do not parasitize it or draw nutrients from it. They are generally considered harmless to the Date Palm and are often an indicator of good air quality.

**Control Measures:**

*   **No Control Required:** For the health of the Date Palm, control of lichens is generally not necessary as they do not cause any damage to the tree.
*   **Aesthetic Removal (if desired):** If removal is desired for aesthetic reasons, it can be done gently:
    *   **Physical Removal:** Gently scrub the affected areas with a soft brush and water.
    *   **Very Dilute Copper Spray:** In cases of very dense growth and if aesthetic removal is strongly desired, a very dilute solution of a copper-based fungicide can be used, but with caution, as it is not for tree health.
        *   **Copper Oxychloride:** Apply a very dilute solution at 1 g/L of water, ensuring thorough coverage. This may help in detaching the lichens over time.

It is important to reiterate that lichens are benign and their presence does not indicate a problem with the Date Palm's health.
