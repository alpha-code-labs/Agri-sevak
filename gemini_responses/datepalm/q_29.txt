Regarding "Tinda/Boll dropping": This is not known to affect DatePalm, as DatePalms produce dates (drupes), not tinda or bolls.

However, flower drop and fruit drop are significant concerns in DatePalm cultivation in Haryana. These can be caused by a combination of factors including poor pollination, nutritional deficiencies, environmental stress (e.g., extreme temperatures, water stress), and hormonal imbalances. Effective control involves an integrated approach:

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Pollination:** Date palms are dioecious (separate male and female trees). Ensure timely and adequate hand pollination for optimal fruit set. Use fresh, viable pollen from healthy male trees. This is the most critical step for good fruit set.
*   **Water Management:** Provide consistent and adequate irrigation, especially during critical stages like flowering, fruit set, and fruit development. Avoid both water stress (drought) and waterlogging.
*   **Bunch Management:** Thinning of fruit bunches and individual fruits within a bunch can reduce competition for nutrients and water, leading to better fruit retention, improved fruit size, and quality. This typically involves removing excess strands or fruits from the center of the bunch.
*   **Weed Control:** Keep the area around the date palm trees free of weeds to reduce competition for water and nutrients.

**2. Nutritional Management:**
*   **Balanced Fertilization:** Ensure the tree receives a balanced supply of macro and micronutrients. Soil and leaf analysis can help determine specific deficiencies.
*   **Micronutrient Application:** Deficiencies of Boron and Zinc are often linked to flower and fruit drop.
    *   **Boron:** Apply **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate) at 10-15 kg/acre annually, or foliar spray **Boric Acid** (17% Boron) at 1-1.5 g/L of water during pre-flowering and fruit set stages.
    *   **Zinc:** Apply **Zinc Sulphate** (21% Zinc) at 20-25 kg/acre annually, or foliar spray **Zinc Sulphate** at 2-3 g/L of water during active growth periods.
*   **Potassium and Calcium:** Adequate levels of Potassium and Calcium are also crucial for fruit development and retention. Ensure these are supplied as part of the regular fertilization schedule.

**3. Hormonal Management (Plant Growth Regulators - PGRs):**
*   PGRs can be used to regulate fruit set and prevent premature fruit drop.
    *   **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA):** An auxin that can help prevent premature fruit drop. Apply as a foliar spray at 10-20 ppm (parts per million) during the fruit set stage (e.g., 2-3 weeks after pollination). For a commercial formulation containing 4.5% **Naphthalene Acetic Acid**, this would typically be around 0.2-0.4 ml/L of water. *Always follow the specific product label instructions for dosage and timing.*
    *   **Gibberellic Acid (GA3):** Can improve fruit set and size, though its primary role is less directly for drop prevention than NAA. If used, typical concentrations are 25-50 ppm (e.g., 0.25-0.5 g/L of a 10% **Gibberellic Acid** formulation). *Consult specific product labels for recommendations.*

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always conduct a soil and leaf analysis to identify specific nutrient deficiencies before applying fertilizers.
*   Apply chemicals strictly according to label instructions and recommended dosages.
*   The timing of application for PGRs is critical for their effectiveness.
*   Monitor trees regularly for any signs of stress, pests, or diseases, as severe infestations can also contribute to dropping.
