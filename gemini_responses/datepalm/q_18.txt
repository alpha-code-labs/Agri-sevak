As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified recommendations for the use of growth regulators and micronutrients in Date Palm cultivation in Haryana:

It is crucial to apply these chemicals at the correct stage and concentration to achieve the desired effects and avoid phytotoxicity. Always ensure thorough coverage and use appropriate spray equipment.

### Recommended Doses of Growth Regulators/Hormones and Boron in Date Palm:

1.  **Ethephon (for fruit ripening and uniform maturity)**
    *   **Purpose:** To promote uniform ripening, degreening, and improve fruit quality, especially for early harvest or processing.
    *   **Recommended Dose:** Apply **Ethephon** at a concentration of 250-500 ppm (parts per million) as a foliar spray.
        *   *Application Timing:* Typically applied 1-2 weeks before the anticipated harvest date, when fruits start to show signs of colour change (e.g., from green to yellow/reddish).
    *   **Note:** The exact timing and concentration may vary slightly depending on the cultivar and desired ripening stage.

2.  **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (for fruit retention and size enhancement)**
    *   **Purpose:** At very low concentrations, **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid** acts as a synthetic auxin to reduce premature fruit drop and increase fruit size.
    *   **Recommended Dose:** Apply **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid** (acid equivalent) at a concentration of 10-20 ppm as a foliar spray.
        *   *Application Timing:* Usually applied 2-3 weeks after successful pollination and fruit set, when fruits are still very small.
    *   **Caution:** Higher concentrations can cause phytotoxicity and fruit thinning, which is generally not desired for fruit retention. Accurate measurement is critical.

3.  **Boron (as a micronutrient for fruit set and development)**
    *   **Purpose:** Boron is an essential micronutrient vital for pollen germination, pollen tube growth, fruit set, and overall fruit development. Deficiency can lead to poor fruit set, fruit drop, and malformed fruits.
    *   **Recommended Dose:** Apply **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (a highly soluble source of Boron) at a concentration of 5-10 g per litre of water (0.5-1.0% solution) as a foliar spray.
        *   *Application Timing:*
            *   First spray: Before flowering (at the time of spathe emergence/bud break).
            *   Second spray: After fruit set, approximately 2-3 weeks after pollination.
    *   **Note:** Soil application of Boron can also be done based on soil test reports, typically 10-20 kg of Borax (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate) per acre, once every 2-3 years, but foliar application provides a quicker response for immediate needs.

Always consult with local agricultural extension services or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and cultivar. Ensure all safety precautions are followed during handling and application of these chemicals.
