As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I emphasize that precise fertilizer recommendations for Date Palm (Phoenix dactylifera) are best determined by a comprehensive soil test report from your specific field. The following recommendations are general guidelines for healthy, mature bearing Date Palm trees in Haryana and should be adjusted based on soil analysis.

**General Fertilizer Recommendations for Mature Bearing Date Palm Trees (8+ years old):**

The annual nutrient requirement for a mature bearing Date Palm tree is typically:
*   Nitrogen (N): 1.0 - 1.5 kg per tree
*   Phosphorus (P2O5): 0.5 - 0.75 kg per tree
*   Potassium (K2O): 1.0 - 1.5 kg per tree
*   Sulphur (S): 100 - 200 g per tree

**Specific Fertilizer Doses (per mature bearing tree per year):**

1.  **Nitrogen (N):**
    *   **Urea** (46% N): 2.17 - 3.26 kg per tree.
    *   **Nano-Urea** (Liquid, 4% N): Primarily for foliar application as a supplement. Apply 2-4 ml/L of water, 2-3 times during critical growth stages (e.g., pre-flowering, fruit set, fruit development). This supplements granular urea and does not fully replace the basal dose for mature trees.

2.  **Phosphorus (P):**
    *   **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5): 1.08 - 1.63 kg per tree. (Note: This will also contribute 0.19 - 0.29 kg of Nitrogen, which should be accounted for in the total N calculation).
    *   **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5, 11% S): 3.12 - 4.68 kg per tree. (This is a good option if Sulphur is also needed).
    *   **Nano-DAP** (Liquid, 8% N, 16% P2O5): Primarily for foliar application as a supplement. Apply 2-4 ml/L of water, 2-3 times during critical growth stages (e.g., pre-flowering, fruit set, fruit development). This supplements granular P and does not fully replace the basal dose for mature trees.

3.  **Potassium (K):**
    *   **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** (60% K2O): 1.67 - 2.5 kg per tree.
    *   **Sulphate of Potash (SOP)** (50% K2O, 18% S): 2.0 - 3.0 kg per tree. (Preferred in saline soils or where Sulphur is also deficient).

4.  **Sulphur (S):**
    *   If using **SSP** or **Sulphate of Potash**, the Sulphur requirement is often met.
    *   If additional Sulphur is needed, apply **Elemental Sulphur** (90% S): 100 - 200 g per tree.

5.  **NPK Compound Fertilizers:**
    *   These are available in various ratios (e.g., 19:19:19, 10:26:26). Their use depends on specific soil test recommendations. If a balanced NPK is required, for example, to supply 1 kg N, 1 kg P2O5, and 1 kg K2O, you would need approximately 5.26 kg of **NPK (19:19:19)**. It is often more precise to apply individual fertilizers based on specific nutrient needs.

**Application Timing and Method:**

*   **Split Application:** Fertilizers should be applied in 2-3 splits to ensure continuous nutrient availability and minimize losses.
    *   **First Split (February - March):** Before flowering/start of active growth. Apply 1/2 of the total Nitrogen, all Phosphorus, 1/2 of the total Potassium, and all Sulphur.
    *   **Second Split (May - June):** After fruit set/during fruit development. Apply the remaining 1/2 of the total Nitrogen and 1/2 of the total Potassium.
*   **Method:** Granular fertilizers should be broadcast in a ring around the tree, 1-2 meters from the trunk, within the drip line, and lightly incorporated into the soil. Ensure adequate irrigation immediately after application.
*   **Foliar Application:** **Nano-Urea** and **Nano-DAP** should be applied as foliar sprays during critical growth stages (e.g., pre-flowering, fruit set, fruit development) as per product instructions.

**Recommendations for Young (Non-Bearing) Date Palm Trees:**

Fertilizer doses should be gradually increased as the trees grow:
*   **Year 1:** 1/4th of the mature tree dose.
*   **Year 2-3:** 1/2 of the mature tree dose.
*   **Year 4-7:** 3/4th of the mature tree dose.
*   **Year 8 onwards:** Full mature tree dose.

**Other Important Considerations:**

*   **Organic Matter:** Supplement chemical fertilizers with 20-30 kg of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost per tree per year, preferably applied during October-November. This improves soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability.
*   **Micronutrients:** Date palms can be susceptible to deficiencies of Boron (B), Zinc (Zn), Iron (Fe), and Manganese (Mn). A soil test will identify these needs. If deficiencies are detected, apply appropriate micronutrient fertilizers as soil application or foliar sprays.
*   **Water Management:** Efficient irrigation is crucial for nutrient uptake and overall tree health.

Always prioritize soil testing for the most accurate and efficient fertilizer management plan for your Date Palm orchard.
