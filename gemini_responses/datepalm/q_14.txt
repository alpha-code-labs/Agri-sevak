As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the critical importance of managing soil pests for the healthy growth and productivity of Date Palms in Haryana. Termites and nematodes, particularly root-knot nematodes, can cause significant damage if not controlled effectively.

Here is scientifically verified advice for controlling these soil pests in Date Palm:

### **1. Control of Termites (Dimak)**

Termites are a major threat, especially to young Date Palm plants, by feeding on roots and the base of the trunk, leading to weakening, poor nutrient uptake, and even plant death.

**Symptoms of Damage:**
*   Presence of mud channels on the trunk and around the base of the plant.
*   Hollowing of the stem base and roots.
*   Stunted growth, yellowing, and wilting of leaves.
*   Easy uprooting of affected plants.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Maintain good field sanitation by removing dead wood, stumps, and other organic debris from the vicinity of the palms, as these can serve as breeding grounds for termites.
    *   Avoid direct contact of organic manure or compost with the main stem of the palm.
    *   Ensure proper irrigation to avoid water stress, which can make plants more susceptible.

*   **Chemical Control (Soil Drenching/Application):**
    *   For existing infestations or as a prophylactic measure, drenching the soil around the base of the palm is effective.
    *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC:** Apply at a rate of **2.5-5 litres per acre**, mixed with sufficient water (e.g., 500-1000 litres) and drenched around the root zone of the palms.
    *   **Fipronil 5% SC:** Apply at a rate of **1-1.5 litres per acre**, mixed with water and drenched around the base of the palms.

### **2. Control of Nematodes (Root-Knot Nematodes - *Meloidogyne* spp.)**

Root-knot nematodes are microscopic worms that infect the roots, causing characteristic galls or knots. This damage impairs the plant's ability to absorb water and nutrients, leading to stunted growth and reduced yield.

**Symptoms of Damage:**
*   Presence of galls or swellings (knots) on the roots, which are visible upon uprooting or careful inspection.
*   Stunted growth, yellowing of leaves (chlorosis), and general decline in plant vigour.
*   Reduced fruit size and yield.
*   Increased susceptibility to other root diseases.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Use only healthy, certified, and nematode-free planting material (tissue culture plants are generally preferred).
    *   Practice good field sanitation and remove infected plant debris.
    *   Solarization of nursery beds or small areas before planting can reduce nematode populations.
    *   Incorporate organic matter like well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or neem cake, which can improve soil health and promote beneficial microorganisms that suppress nematodes.

*   **Biological Control:**
    *   Application of bio-nematicides can be highly effective as part of an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategy.
    *   **Purpureocillium lilacinum** (formerly *Paecilomyces lilacinus*) based formulation: Apply **2-4 kg per acre**, mixed with 100-200 kg of well-decomposed FYM or compost, and broadcasted around the root zone, followed by light irrigation.
    *   **Bacillus firmus** based formulation: Apply **2-4 litres per acre**, mixed with water and drenched around the root zone.

*   **Chemical Control (Nematicides):**
    *   For severe infestations, chemical nematicides can be used.
    *   **Fluensulfone 2% GR:** Apply at a rate of **10-15 kg per acre**, broadcasted evenly around the root zone of the palms and lightly incorporated into the soil, followed by irrigation.
    *   **Fipronil 0.3% GR:** Apply at a rate of **10-15 kg per acre**, broadcasted around the root zone and incorporated into the soil, followed by irrigation. (This can also offer some control against termites).

**General Recommendations and Precautions:**

*   **Integrated Pest Management (IPM):** Always adopt an IPM approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods for sustainable and effective pest control.
*   **Soil Testing:** It is highly recommended to conduct soil testing to confirm the presence and population density of nematodes before applying nematicides.
*   **Application Timing:** Apply chemicals when soil moisture is adequate, and follow up with irrigation if necessary to ensure proper distribution and uptake.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, and protective clothing while handling and applying any pesticides. Read and strictly follow the instructions and safety precautions mentioned on the product label.
*   **Consultation:** For specific field conditions or severe infestations, it is advisable to consult with HAU experts or local agricultural extension officers for tailored recommendations.
