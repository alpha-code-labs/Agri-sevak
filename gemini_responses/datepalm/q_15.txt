Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist from HAU, Hisar, I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing these conditions in DatePalm cultivation in Haryana.

Here's how to control the mentioned pests:

### 1. Grasshopper

Grasshoppers can cause damage by feeding on young leaves and shoots, especially in nurseries or newly established plantations.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Maintain field sanitation by removing weeds and crop residues that can serve as breeding grounds.
    *   Deep ploughing during off-season can expose grasshopper eggs to predators and adverse weather conditions, reducing their population.
*   **Chemical Control (if infestation is severe):**
    *   **Malathion** 50% EC: Apply at 1.0-1.5 litres per 500-750 litres of water per acre as a foliar spray.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: Apply at 200-250 ml per 500-750 litres of water per acre as a foliar spray.
    *   **Quinalphos** 25% EC: Apply at 1.0-1.5 litres per 500-750 litres of water per acre as a foliar spray.

### 2. Painted Bug

This is not known to affect DatePalm as a significant pest. Painted bugs (Bagrada hilaris / Bagrada cruciferarum) are primarily pests of cruciferous crops like mustard, cabbage, and radish.

### 3. Red Cotton Bug

This is not known to affect DatePalm. Red cotton bugs (Dysdercus cingulatus) are primarily pests of cotton and other malvaceous plants, feeding on developing seeds.

### 4. Black Ants

Black ants are generally not direct pests of DatePalm, meaning they do not feed on the plant tissue. However, they can be a nuisance, protect other sap-sucking pests (like mealybugs or scale insects) for their honeydew, or nest at the base of the palm.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Keep the area around the base of the palm clean and free of debris, which can serve as nesting sites.
    *   Ensure proper irrigation to avoid overly dry soil conditions that ants might prefer for nesting.
*   **Chemical Control (if ants are a nuisance or tending other pests):**
    *   **Fipronil** 0.01% GR (granular bait): Apply 10-15 kg per acre around the base of the palm or directly into ant trails and nests. Ants will carry the bait back to their colony, affecting the entire population.
    *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: For drenching ant nests, mix 2.5 ml per litre of water and drench the visible ant nests or around the base of the palm where ant activity is high. Use this method carefully to avoid excessive soil contamination.
    *   If ants are present due to honeydew-producing pests (e.g., mealybugs, scale insects), the primary focus should be on controlling these sap-sucking pests. Once the primary pest is controlled, the ants will naturally disperse. For such cases, systemic insecticides like **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL can be used as a drench (as per label recommendations for DatePalm, if approved) to control the sap-suckers.

Always follow the label instructions for any chemical pesticide regarding dosage, application method, and safety precautions. It is also advisable to consult with local agricultural extension officers for the most current recommendations and approvals specific to your region and crop stage.
