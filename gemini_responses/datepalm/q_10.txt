As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in DatePalm, keeping in mind the conditions in Haryana.

It is crucial to correctly identify the specific pest causing the damage, as control measures can vary significantly. Always consult with your local agricultural extension officer for precise diagnosis and recommendations.

Here's how to control the mentioned pests:

### 1. Borers in DatePalm

Date palms in our region can be affected by various borers, primarily the Red Palm Weevil (Rhynchophorus ferrugineus) and larvae of the Rhinoceros Beetle (Oryctes rhinoceros). These pests bore into the trunk, crown, or base of the palm, causing significant damage.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Borers:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Maintain good orchard hygiene by removing dead fronds and debris.
    *   Avoid making wounds on the trunk, as these can attract adult weevils for egg-laying. If pruning is necessary, apply a wound dressing immediately.
    *   Regularly inspect palms for signs of borer activity (e.g., oozing sap, chewed fibers, boreholes, presence of grubs or adults).
*   **Mechanical/Physical Control:**
    *   For Red Palm Weevil, use pheromone traps (e.g., aggregation pheromones) to monitor and mass-trap adult weevils. Place traps at a density of 4-5 traps per acre.
    *   For Rhinoceros Beetle, collect and destroy adults and grubs from breeding sites (e.g., decaying organic matter, compost pits).
*   **Chemical Control (for severe infestations or prophylactic treatment):**
    *   **Trunk Injection/Drenching (for Red Palm Weevil and other stem borers):**
        *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: 10-15 ml per litre of water, injected into boreholes or drenched around the base of the palm.
        *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: 1-2 ml per litre of water, injected into boreholes or drenched around the base of the palm.
    *   **Soil Application (for Rhinoceros Beetle grubs and root borers):**
        *   **Fipronil** 0.3% GR: 25-30 kg per acre, applied to the soil around the base of the palm and lightly irrigated.
        *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: 5 ml per litre of water, drenched around the base of the palm.

### 2. Caterpillars in DatePalm

Various lepidopteran larvae (caterpillars) can feed on date palm leaves, spathes, and fruits, causing defoliation or damage to developing fruits.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Caterpillars:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Regular monitoring of palms for early signs of caterpillar feeding.
    *   Remove and destroy infested leaves or fruit bunches if the infestation is localized.
*   **Biological Control:**
    *   Encourage natural enemies like parasitic wasps and predatory birds.
    *   **Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki** (Bt) (e.g., 1-2 g per litre of water): A biological insecticide effective against young caterpillars. Apply thoroughly to foliage.
*   **Chemical Control (for moderate to severe infestations):**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC: 0.3 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG: 0.2-0.4 g per litre of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Indoxacarb** 14.5% SC: 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Flubendiamide** 20% WG: 0.2-0.3 g per litre of water.

### 3. Diamondback Moth (Plutella xylostella) in DatePalm

This is not known to affect DatePalm. Diamondback moth is a major pest primarily of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower, mustard).

### 4. Leaf folder in DatePalm

While specific 'leaf folder' insect species (like those commonly found in rice or pulses) are not primary pests of DatePalm, certain caterpillars or other lepidopteran larvae might cause leaves to fold, tie together, or create shelters as they feed. In such cases, the damage is caused by general leaf-feeding caterpillars.

**Control measures for such leaf-folding damage would be the same as those recommended for general Caterpillars in DatePalm (refer to point 2 above).**

**General Advice:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully, including dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
*   Apply chemicals during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   Consult with HAU experts or your local Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) for the most current and specific recommendations for your farm.
