As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following doses of organic manures for Date Palm cultivation in Haryana, based on scientific principles and best practices for enhancing soil health and plant productivity.

It is crucial to incorporate these organic manures into the soil around the tree basin, ensuring they are well mixed with the topsoil. Regular soil testing is always recommended for precise nutrient management.

### Recommended Doses of Organic Manures for Date Palm:

*   **Farm Yard Manure (FYM)**
    *   **Young Plants (1-3 years after planting):** 10-20 kg per plant per year.
    *   **Bearing Plants (4 years and onwards):** 25-50 kg per plant per year.
    *   **Application:** Apply the full dose once a year, preferably before the monsoon season (June-July), or split into two equal doses (e.g., March-April and September-October). Ensure it is thoroughly mixed into the soil around the root zone.

*   **Vermicompost**
    *   **Young Plants (1-3 years after planting):** 2-5 kg per plant per year.
    *   **Bearing Plants (4 years and onwards):** 5-10 kg per plant per year.
    *   **Application:** Similar to FYM, apply once a year before monsoon or split into two doses. Vermicompost is richer in nutrients than FYM, hence the lower recommended dose.

*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract based product)**
    *   **Nature:** This is a liquid organic input derived from seaweed, rich in plant growth regulators, micronutrients, and amino acids.
    *   **Foliar Spray:**
        *   **Dose:** 2-3 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Application:** Spray uniformly on the foliage until runoff.
        *   **Timing:** Apply at critical growth stages such as pre-flowering, fruit set, and during fruit development. Typically, 2-3 sprays per year are beneficial.
    *   **Soil Drench/Fertigation:**
        *   **Dose:** 500 ml to 1 litre per plant, diluted in sufficient water, applied around the root zone. Alternatively, 2-4 litres per acre via drip irrigation.
        *   **Timing:** Apply 2-3 times a year, coinciding with major growth flushes or nutrient uptake periods.

These organic inputs significantly improve soil structure, water retention capacity, microbial activity, and nutrient availability, leading to healthier Date Palm trees and better fruit yield and quality.
