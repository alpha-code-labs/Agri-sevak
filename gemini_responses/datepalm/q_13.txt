Greetings from Haryana Agricultural University (HAU), Hisar. As a Senior Agronomist, I will provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling fruit flies and address your query regarding Ber fly in DatePalm.

### Control of Fruit Fly in DatePalm

Fruit flies, primarily species of *Bactrocera* (e.g., *Bactrocera dorsalis*), can infest DatePalm fruits, especially during ripening stages. An Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is recommended for effective control.

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**

*   **Field Sanitation:** Regularly collect and destroy all fallen, damaged, and infested fruits by burying them deep in the soil or composting them in sealed pits. This is crucial to break the pest's life cycle.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** After harvest, deep ploughing around the base of the trees can expose pupae in the soil to predators and adverse weather conditions.
*   **Bagging:** For smaller trees or valuable bunches, individual fruit bunches can be covered with insect-proof bags (e.g., paper or cloth bags) before ripening to prevent egg-laying.

**2. Monitoring and Mass Trapping:**

*   **Pheromone Traps:** Install methyl eugenol-based pheromone traps at a density of 10-15 traps per acre. These traps attract and kill male fruit flies, helping to monitor population levels and reduce their numbers. Replace the lure every 2-3 weeks.

**3. Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved Technical Chemicals):**

Chemical intervention should be considered when pest populations are high or cultural methods are insufficient. Always follow label instructions and observe pre-harvest intervals (PHI).

*   **Poison Bait Sprays:** This is a highly effective and targeted method. Mix an insecticide with a protein source (e.g., protein hydrolysate or jaggery solution). Apply this bait in small patches on the tree trunk or on non-bearing branches, not directly on the fruits.
    *   Mix **Malathion** 50% EC at 2 ml/L of water with 20 g/L of jaggery or 10 g/L of protein hydrolysate. Apply this mixture at 250 ml per tree on 5-6 trees per acre, targeting the lower canopy or trunk.
*   **Foliar Sprays (if infestation is severe):**
    *   Spray with **Dimethoate** 30% EC at 1.7 ml/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, spray with **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   Ensure thorough coverage of the fruit bunches. Apply sprays preferably in the evening to minimize impact on beneficial insects.

### Control of Ber Fly in DatePalm

This is not known to affect DatePalm.

The Ber fly (*Carpomyia vesuviana*) is a highly host-specific pest primarily known to infest fruits of *Ziziphus* species (Ber or Indian Jujube). It is not reported to infest DatePalm (*Phoenix dactylifera*). Therefore, specific control measures for Ber fly are not required for DatePalm cultivation.
