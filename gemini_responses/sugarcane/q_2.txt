As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding rust diseases in Sugarcane for Haryana, India:

*   **Black Rust (Puccinia graminis):** This is not known to affect Sugarcane. It primarily affects wheat and other cereals.
*   **Brown Rust (Puccinia recondita):** This is not known to affect Sugarcane. It primarily affects wheat.
*   **Yellow Rust (Puccinia striiformis):** This is not known to affect Sugarcane. It primarily affects wheat and barley.
*   **White Rust (Albugo candida):** This is not known to affect Sugarcane. It primarily affects cruciferous crops and some other vegetables.
*   **Red Rust (Puccinia kuehnii or Puccinia melanocephala):** This is a significant disease of Sugarcane and requires careful management.

**Control Measures for Red Rust in Sugarcane:**

Red rust is a fungal disease that can cause significant yield losses in susceptible sugarcane varieties, especially during periods of high humidity and moderate temperatures. An integrated pest management (IPM) approach is crucial for its effective control.

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Resistant Varieties:** The most effective and economical method is to cultivate rust-resistant sugarcane varieties. Consult with HAU experts or your local Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) for the latest recommendations on suitable resistant varieties for your specific region in Haryana.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest to reduce the primary source of inoculum for the next crop.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure proper nutrient management. Avoid excessive nitrogen application, which can make plants more succulent and susceptible. Adequate potassium application can enhance plant resistance to diseases.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Maintain optimal plant spacing to ensure good air circulation within the sugarcane canopy. This helps reduce leaf wetness duration, which is critical for fungal spore germination and infection.
*   **Irrigation Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation late in the day, as this can prolong leaf wetness and create conditions favorable for disease development.

**2. Chemical Control:**
Fungicides can be used as a preventive measure or at the early stages of disease development, especially in susceptible varieties or when environmental conditions are highly conducive for rust outbreaks.

*   **Foliar Spray:**
    *   **Propiconazole** 25% EC: Apply at a rate of 500 ml per acre, mixed in 200-250 litres of water. This application should be done at the first appearance of symptoms or when conditions favor disease development. A repeat application may be necessary after 15-20 days if disease pressure persists.
    *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC: Apply at a rate of 200 ml per acre, mixed in 200-250 litres of water. This can also be used as an effective option, especially for its protective and curative action. Repeat application after 15-20 days if required.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and strictly follow the label instructions of the chemical product for correct dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Ensure thorough spray coverage of the foliage for effective disease control.
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in the pathogen population.
*   For specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and the current disease situation, it is always advisable to consult with HAU experts or your local agricultural extension officer.
