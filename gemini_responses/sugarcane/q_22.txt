As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following cultivation practices for Sugarcane in Haryana:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   Sugarcane is primarily propagated vegetatively using setts (pieces of cane stalk).
    *   The most common and recommended method is **Furrow Planting**. Furrows are opened, and setts are placed end-to-end or with a slight overlap.
    *   **Trench Planting** can also be adopted, especially for wider spacing or where mechanical harvesting is planned, as it provides better anchorage and reduces lodging.
    *   **Paired Row Planting** (e.g., 60 cm between paired rows and 120 cm between the next pair) can be beneficial for intercropping and efficient resource utilization.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   The setts should be planted at a depth of **5-7 cm** in the furrows. This ensures adequate moisture for germination and protection from birds and drying winds, while not being too deep to hinder sprouting.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   **Row-to-Row Spacing:**
        *   For conventional planting, a spacing of **75-90 cm** between rows is generally recommended.
        *   For wider row planting or intercropping, spacing can be increased to **120 cm** or paired rows (e.g., 60/120 cm).
    *   **Sett-to-Sett Spacing (within the row):**
        *   Setts are typically placed **end-to-end** or with a slight overlap (about 2-3 cm) to ensure a uniform plant stand.

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   The seed dose depends on the type of sett used (single-bud, two-bud, or three-bud) and the desired plant population.
    *   For **two-bud setts**, which are commonly used, a seed rate of **35,000 - 45,000 setts per acre** is recommended.
    *   This typically translates to approximately **6-8 tonnes of healthy, disease-free cane** per acre required for planting material.
    *   For **single-bud setts** (often used in sett-treaters or nurseries), the number of setts per acre would be higher, around 60,000 - 75,000.
