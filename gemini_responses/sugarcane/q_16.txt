As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following fertilizer schedule for Sugarcane in Haryana. It is crucial to emphasize that **soil testing is the most accurate method** to determine precise nutrient requirements for your specific field. The recommendations below are general guidelines for a planting crop under typical Haryana soil conditions.

### General Fertilizer Recommendations for Sugarcane (Planting Crop) in Haryana:

Based on HAU recommendations, a typical Sugarcane crop requires approximately 150-200 kg Nitrogen (N), 60-80 kg Phosphorus (P2O5), and 60-80 kg Potassium (K2O) per acre. Sulphur (S) at 20-30 kg per acre is also highly beneficial.

Here's how to achieve these nutrient levels using the specified fertilizers:

#### 1. Nitrogen (N) Fertilizers:

*   **Urea** (46% N):
    *   **Total Dose:** 325-435 kg per acre.
    *   **Application:** Apply in 3 split doses:
        *   **First Dose (Basal):** 1/3rd of the total Urea (approx. 110-145 kg/acre) at the time of planting.
        *   **Second Dose:** 1/3rd of the total Urea (approx. 110-145 kg/acre) at 60-90 Days After Planting (DAP) or at the first earthing up.
        *   **Third Dose:** 1/3rd of the total Urea (approx. 110-145 kg/acre) at 90-120 DAP or at the second earthing up/final earthing up.
*   **Nano-Urea** (Liquid):
    *   **Application:** Foliar spray, supplementary to basal Urea application.
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Timing:** 2-4 sprays, starting from 60-75 DAP, with subsequent sprays at 15-20 day intervals. Each spray typically uses 250-500 ml of Nano-Urea per acre (mixed in 100-200 litres of water).

#### 2. Phosphorus (P) Fertilizers:

*   **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5):
    *   **Total Dose:** 130-175 kg per acre.
    *   **Application:** Apply the entire dose as basal at the time of planting.
    *   *Note:* If using DAP, adjust the **Urea** dose downwards as DAP also provides Nitrogen (e.g., 150 kg DAP provides approximately 27 kg N).
*   **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5, 11% S):
    *   **Total Dose:** 375-500 kg per acre.
    *   **Application:** Apply the entire dose as basal at the time of planting.
    *   *Note:* SSP is a good choice if your soil also requires Sulphur, as it provides a significant amount of S. If using SSP, you might not need additional Sulphur fertilizer.
*   **Nano-DAP** (Liquid):
    *   **Application:** Foliar spray, supplementary to basal P application.
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Timing:** 2-4 sprays, starting from 60-75 DAP, with subsequent sprays at 15-20 day intervals. Each spray typically uses 250-500 ml of Nano-DAP per acre (mixed in 100-200 litres of water).

#### 3. Potassium (K) Fertilizer:

*   **Muriate of Potash (MOP) / Potash** (60% K2O):
    *   **Total Dose:** 100-135 kg per acre.
    *   **Application:** Apply the entire dose as basal at planting, or split into two doses (50% basal, 50% at earthing up).
    *   *Note:* For ratoon crops or soils known to be deficient in Potassium, the dose may be increased to 150-200 kg per acre.

#### 4. Sulphur (S) Fertilizer:

*   **Bentonite Sulphur** (90% S):
    *   **Total Dose:** 20-35 kg per acre.
    *   **Application:** Apply the entire dose as basal at the time of planting.
    *   *Note:* If **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** is used as the Phosphorus source, it will largely fulfill the Sulphur requirement (375-500 kg SSP provides 41-55 kg S). In such cases, additional Bentonite Sulphur may not be needed.

#### 5. NPK Complex Fertilizers:

*   **NPK (e.g., 12:32:16, 10:26:26, 19:19:19):**
    *   **Application:** These can be used as a basal application at planting.
    *   **Dose:** Typically 150-250 kg per acre, depending on the specific NPK ratio and soil test results.
    *   *Note:* If using NPK complex fertilizers, calculate the amount of N, P2O5, and K2O supplied by them and adjust the doses of straight fertilizers (Urea, DAP/SSP, MOP) accordingly to meet the total recommended nutrient requirements. For example, 200 kg of NPK (12:32:16) provides 24 kg N, 64 kg P2O5, and 32 kg K2O.

### Important Considerations:

*   **Soil Testing:** Always conduct a soil test to get precise recommendations for your field, including micronutrients.
*   **Ratoon Crop:** For ratoon crops, generally increase the Nitrogen and Potassium doses by 25% compared to the plant crop, applied immediately after harvesting the plant crop.
*   **Micronutrients:** Haryana soils are often deficient in Zinc and Iron. Consider applying:
    *   **Zinc Sulphate** (21% Zn): 10-15 kg per acre as basal, or 0.5% foliar spray (500 g in 100 litres of water).
    *   **Ferrous Sulphate** (19% Fe): 20-25 kg per acre as basal, or 0.5% foliar spray (500 g in 100 litres of water).
*   **Irrigation:** Ensure adequate moisture in the soil at the time of fertilizer application and follow up with irrigation if needed, especially for basal applications, to ensure nutrient availability.

This comprehensive approach will help ensure optimal nutrient supply for healthy Sugarcane growth and yield in Haryana.
