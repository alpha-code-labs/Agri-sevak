As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified practices for sugarcane transplantation in Haryana:

Sugarcane is traditionally planted using setts. However, transplanting seedlings (raised from single-bud setts in a nursery) is a modern technique gaining popularity due to its advantages like saving seed material, better germination, and uniform crop stand.

### Ideal Transplantation Time

The ideal transplantation time for sugarcane in Haryana depends on the planting season:

*   **Spring Planting:**
    *   **Nursery Raising:** Start nursery preparation in **December to January**.
    *   **Transplantation:** Transplant 6-8 week old seedlings to the main field during **February to March**. This is the most common planting season in Haryana.
*   **Autumn Planting:**
    *   **Nursery Raising:** Start nursery preparation in **July to August**.
    *   **Transplantation:** Transplant 6-8 week old seedlings to the main field during **September to October**. This season often results in higher yields and allows for better utilization of resources.

### Ideal Transplantation Distance

Maintaining optimal spacing is crucial for proper growth, light interception, and nutrient utilization.

*   **Row-to-Row Distance:**
    *   For conventional planting: **75 cm to 90 cm**.
    *   For wider row planting (e.g., Sustainable Sugarcane Initiative - SSI, or for intercropping): **120 cm**.
*   **Plant-to-Plant Distance (within the row):**
    *   For transplanted seedlings: **30 cm to 45 cm**. This spacing allows for adequate tillering and development of individual plants.

### Transplantation Process

The transplantation process involves two main stages: nursery raising and main field preparation followed by the actual transplanting.

**1. Nursery Raising:**

*   **Sett Preparation:** Select healthy, disease-free cane stalks. Cut single-bud setts (approximately 15-20 cm long) ensuring the bud is intact and undamaged.
*   **Sett Treatment:** Treat the single-bud setts with appropriate fungicide and insecticide solutions to protect against diseases and pests. (Specific chemical names are not provided as per rule 2).
*   **Planting in Nursery:** Plant the treated single-bud setts in polybags (e.g., 10 cm x 15 cm size) or pro-trays filled with a well-drained potting mixture (e.g., soil, sand, and well-decomposed farmyard manure/compost in a 1:1:1 ratio).
*   **Nursery Care:** Maintain adequate moisture by regular watering. Provide partial shade initially to protect young sprouts from harsh sunlight.
*   **Seedling Readiness:** Seedlings are typically ready for transplanting in 6-8 weeks when they have developed 3-4 leaves and are about 20-30 cm tall.

**2. Main Field Preparation:**

*   **Land Preparation:** Plough the field deeply (25-30 cm), followed by 2-3 harrowing and planking operations to achieve a fine, friable tilth.
*   **Organic Manure Application:** Incorporate 10-15 tonnes of well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost per acre during land preparation.
*   **Furrow Formation:** Form furrows at the desired row-to-row spacing (e.g., 75 cm to 90 cm) across the field.

**3. Transplanting Operation:**

*   **Hardening of Seedlings:** Reduce watering in the nursery 7-10 days before transplanting to harden the seedlings, making them more resilient to field conditions.
*   **Field Irrigation:** Lightly irrigate the furrows in the main field a few hours before transplanting.
*   **Transplanting:** Carefully remove the seedlings from the polybags or trays, ensuring minimal disturbance to the root ball. Plant the seedlings upright in the furrows at the recommended plant-to-plant distance (30 cm to 45 cm). Ensure the base of the seedling is at the same level as it was in the nursery.
*   **Post-Transplant Irrigation:** Immediately provide a light irrigation after transplanting to settle the soil around the roots and prevent transplant shock.
*   **Gap Filling:** Monitor the field for 10-15 days after transplanting. If any seedlings fail to establish, replace them with healthy seedlings from the nursery to maintain a uniform plant stand.
