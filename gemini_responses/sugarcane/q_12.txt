As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an integrated approach for effective control of Scale insects and Mealybugs in Sugarcane. These pests can cause significant damage by sucking sap, leading to stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, and reduced sugar recovery.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategy:**

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   **Use Healthy Planting Material:** Always select and plant healthy, pest-free setts. Inspect setts thoroughly before planting.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy infested plant debris, stubbles, and alternate weed hosts from and around the sugarcane field.
*   **Detrashing:** Periodically remove dry and infested leaf sheaths, especially from the lower parts of the cane. This exposes the hidden pests to natural enemies and makes chemical sprays more effective.
*   **Avoid Ratooning Heavily Infested Fields:** If a plant crop is severely infested, it is advisable not to ratoon it, as the pest population will carry over to the ratoon crop.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush growth that favors pest multiplication. Maintain balanced nutrition.

**2. Biological Control:**
*   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Encourage and conserve natural predators like ladybird beetles (e.g., *Scymnus* spp., *Chilocorus* spp.), lacewings, and parasitic wasps (e.g., *Anagyrus dactylopii* for mealybugs, various encyrtids for scales). Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.
*   **Augmentative Release:** In areas where available and recommended, mass-reared natural enemies can be released to suppress pest populations.

**3. Chemical Control (for severe infestations, as a last resort):**
When pest populations are high and causing economic damage, chemical intervention may be necessary. Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and within leaf sheaths where these pests reside. High volume sprays are often required.

*   **For Scale Insects:**
    *   **Chlorpyriphos 20% EC**: Apply 1.25 litres per acre in 400-500 litres of water as a drench or thorough spray.
    *   **Dimethoate 30% EC**: Apply 660 ml per acre in 400-500 litres of water as a thorough spray.
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL**: Apply 125 ml per acre in 400-500 litres of water as a thorough spray.

*   **For Mealybugs:**
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC**: Apply 500-600 ml per acre in 400-500 litres of water as a thorough spray, targeting nymphs.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG**: Apply 80 grams per acre in 400-500 litres of water as a thorough spray.
    *   **Chlorpyriphos 20% EC**: Apply 1.25 litres per acre in 400-500 litres of water as a thorough spray.
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL**: Apply 125 ml per acre in 400-500 litres of water as a thorough spray.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and strictly follow the label instructions of the insecticide, including dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance in pest populations.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension specialists or HAU experts for the most current and specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions in Haryana.
