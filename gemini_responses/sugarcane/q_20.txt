As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I emphasize that accurate diagnosis through soil and plant tissue analysis is paramount before applying any micronutrient. Blind application can lead to imbalances or toxicity. However, based on common deficiencies observed in Haryana's sugarcane fields, here's how to address the specified micronutrient deficiencies:

---

### General Recommendations for Micronutrient Management:

*   **Soil Testing:** Always conduct a comprehensive soil test to confirm the deficiency and determine the precise requirement. HAU's soil testing labs can provide detailed reports and recommendations.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management:** Micronutrient application should be part of an integrated nutrient management plan, considering the overall soil health and crop needs.
*   **Timing:** Foliar applications are generally most effective during active growth phases, such as tillering and grand growth.

### Addressing Specific Micronutrient Deficiencies in Sugarcane:

#### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency:

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, small and narrow leaves (little leaf), interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, often with reddish-brown spots.
*   **Recommended Chemicals & Application:**
    *   **Soil Application (Preventive/Corrective):**
        *   Apply 20-25 kg/acre of **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (21% Zn) or 10-12 kg/acre of **Zinc sulphate monohydrate** (33% Zn) at the time of planting or during early tillering.
    *   **Foliar Application (Corrective):**
        *   Spray a 0.5% solution (5 g/L of water) of **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** or 0.1-0.2% solution (1-2 g/L of water) of **Zinc EDTA** (12% Zn). Apply 2-3 sprays at 15-day intervals, starting from the tillering stage.

#### 2. Iron (Fe) Deficiency:

*   **Symptoms:** Severe interveinal chlorosis (yellowing) of young leaves, with veins remaining green, eventually turning almost white in severe cases. Growth is stunted.
*   **Recommended Chemicals & Application:**
    *   **Soil Application (Less effective in high pH soils common in Haryana):**
        *   Apply 20-25 kg/acre of **Ferrous sulphate heptahydrate** (19% Fe) if soil pH is below 7.5.
    *   **Foliar Application (Most effective for quick correction, especially in alkaline soils):**
        *   Spray a 0.5-1.0% solution (5-10 g/L of water) of **Ferrous sulphate heptahydrate** or 0.1-0.2% solution (1-2 g/L of water) of **Ferrous EDTA** (12% Fe). Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, targeting young foliage.

#### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency:

*   **Symptoms:** Death of the growing point (meristematic tissue), distorted and brittle young leaves, internal tissue breakdown, hollow stalks, and poor sugar recovery.
*   **Recommended Chemicals & Application:**
    *   **Soil Application (Preventive):**
        *   Apply 4-6 kg/acre of **Sodium tetraborate decahydrate** (Borax, 10.5% B) at planting. *Caution: Boron can be toxic in excess, so precise application based on soil test is crucial.*
    *   **Foliar Application (Corrective):**
        *   Spray a 0.1-0.2% solution (1-2 g/L of water) of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (20% B) or **Sodium tetraborate decahydrate**. Apply 1-2 sprays during the tillering to grand growth phase.

#### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency:

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, distorted or necrotic (dead) young leaves, poor root development, and water-soaked appearance of young tissues.
*   **Recommended Chemicals & Application:**
    *   **Soil Application (Preventive/Corrective):**
        *   For general calcium supply and soil amendment, especially in sodic soils, apply **Gypsum** (Calcium sulphate dihydrate) as per soil test recommendations (typically 200-500 kg/acre).
        *   For direct calcium supply, apply 20-30 kg/acre of **Calcium nitrate** at planting or during early growth.
    *   **Foliar Application (Corrective):**
        *   Spray a 0.5-1.0% solution (5-10 g/L of water) of **Calcium nitrate** or **Calcium chloride**. Apply 2-3 sprays at 15-day intervals, targeting young leaves.

#### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency:

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) of older leaves, with veins remaining green. In severe cases, leaves may develop a purplish tinge or reddish-brown spots.
*   **Recommended Chemicals & Application:**
    *   **Soil Application (Preventive/Corrective):**
        *   Apply 20-25 kg/acre of **Magnesium sulphate heptahydrate** (Epsom salt, 9.6% Mg) at planting or during early growth.
    *   **Foliar Application (Corrective):**
        *   Spray a 1.0-2.0% solution (10-20 g/L of water) of **Magnesium sulphate heptahydrate**. Apply 2-3 sprays at 15-day intervals, targeting affected foliage.

#### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency:

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis of younger leaves, similar to iron deficiency but often with a finer network of green veins. Necrotic spots may appear along the veins in severe cases.
*   **Recommended Chemicals & Application:**
    *   **Soil Application (Less effective in high pH soils):**
        *   Apply 10-15 kg/acre of **Manganese sulphate monohydrate** (30.5% Mn) if soil pH is suitable.
    *   **Foliar Application (Most effective for quick correction, especially in alkaline soils):**
        *   Spray a 0.5% solution (5 g/L of water) of **Manganese sulphate monohydrate**. Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, targeting young foliage.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Water Quality:** Use clean water for foliar sprays.
*   **Adjuvants:** Consider adding a non-ionic spreader/sticker to foliar sprays to improve coverage and absorption.
*   **Compatibility:** Do not mix micronutrient sprays with incompatible pesticides or fertilizers without checking compatibility.
*   **Repeat Applications:** For severe deficiencies, repeat applications may be necessary.
*   **Consult HAU Experts:** For specific field conditions and tailored advice, always consult with the agronomists at Haryana Agricultural University or your local KVK (Krishi Vigyan Kendra).
