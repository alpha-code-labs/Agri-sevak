Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding soil pests in sugarcane. Termites and nematodes, particularly root-knot nematodes, can cause significant yield losses if not managed effectively. Here's a scientifically verified approach for their control in Haryana:

It is crucial to adopt an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods for sustainable and effective control.

### **1. Control of Termites (Dimag)**

Termites primarily damage germinating buds, setts, and roots, leading to poor germination and stunted growth.

**A. Cultural and Mechanical Methods:**
*   **Deep Ploughing:** Expose termite colonies to sunlight and predators by deep ploughing during summer.
*   **Removal of Residues:** Clear all crop residues, stubble, and woody debris from the field, as these serve as food sources for termites.
*   **Well-decomposed FYM:** Use only well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost, as undecomposed organic matter can attract termites.
*   **Proper Irrigation:** Maintain adequate soil moisture, as termites prefer dry conditions.

**B. Chemical Control (Soil Application):**
Apply these chemicals at the time of planting or during earthing up, ensuring proper mixing with the soil or drenching.

*   **Fipronil 0.3% GR:** Apply 25-33 kg/acre in furrows at planting or broadcast and incorporate into the soil during earthing up.
*   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC:** Mix 2.0-2.5 L/acre with 400-500 L of water and apply as a drench in furrows at planting or along the rows during earthing up.

### **2. Control of Nematodes (Root-knot Nematodes - *Meloidogyne* spp.)**

Nematodes attack the roots, forming galls (knots) that impair water and nutrient uptake, leading to stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, and reduced cane yield and quality.

**A. Cultural and Biological Methods:**
*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate sugarcane with non-host crops like marigold, mustard, or sunnhemp. Marigold and sunnhemp can act as trap crops or biofumigants.
*   **Summer Ploughing:** Deep ploughing during hot summer months exposes nematodes to high temperatures and desiccation, reducing their population.
*   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) at 10-15 tonnes/acre or **Neem cake** at 200-400 kg/acre into the soil before planting. Neem cake has nematicidal properties and enhances beneficial soil microbes.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available, choose sugarcane varieties known to be tolerant or resistant to common nematode species in your region.
*   **Bio-nematicides:** Apply biological agents like *Paecilomyces lilacinus* or *Purpureocillium lilacinum* as soil application or sett treatment as per manufacturer's recommendations.

**B. Chemical Control (Soil Application):**
Chemical nematicides should be used judiciously and as part of an IPM strategy.

*   **Carbofuran 3% CG:** Apply 33 kg/acre in furrows at planting or broadcast and incorporate into the soil during earthing up.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Soil Testing:** Before planting, it is advisable to get your soil tested for nematode population levels to determine the severity of the infestation.
*   **Safety Precautions:** Always read and follow the instructions on the chemical label carefully. Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) like gloves, masks, and protective clothing during application.
*   **Environmental Safety:** Avoid chemical runoff into water bodies.

By implementing these scientifically sound practices, you can effectively manage soil pests in your sugarcane fields and ensure a healthy, productive crop. For any further specific queries, please consult your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts.
