Namaste! The symptom of "drying up" (drying of plant parts) in sugarcane can be caused by a variety of factors, including abiotic stresses, pest infestations, and diseases. It is crucial to correctly identify the underlying cause to implement effective management strategies.

Please note that sugarcane does not produce typical "branches" or "fruits." This advice addresses the drying of stalks, tillers, leaves, and the tassel (flower).

Here's how to address drying up in sugarcane:

### I. Abiotic Stresses

These are non-living factors that can cause physiological stress leading to drying.

1.  **Water Stress (Drought or Waterlogging):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Wilting, yellowing, and drying of leaves from the tip and margins, stunted growth, reduced tillering. Waterlogging can also cause root damage leading to similar above-ground symptoms.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Ensure adequate and timely irrigation based on the crop stage, soil type, and weather conditions.
        *   Implement water-saving techniques like drip irrigation or furrow irrigation.
        *   Improve soil drainage in areas prone to waterlogging by creating proper channels or raised beds.
        *   Apply mulches (e.g., sugarcane trash) to conserve soil moisture and regulate soil temperature.

2.  **Nutrient Deficiencies:**
    *   **Potassium Deficiency:**
        *   **Symptoms:** Yellowing and scorching of older leaf margins, progressing inwards. Leaves may appear reddish-brown and dry prematurely.
        *   **Management:**
            *   Conduct soil testing to confirm deficiency.
            *   Foliar spray of **Potassium sulphate** (0.5-1.0% solution) at weekly intervals.
            *   Soil application of recommended potassium fertilizers based on soil test results.
    *   **Boron Deficiency:**
        *   **Symptoms:** Malformation of young leaves, necrosis (death) of growing points, stunted growth, and drying of the top portion of the plant.
        *   **Management:**
            *   Conduct soil testing.
            *   Foliar spray of **Borax** (0.1-0.2% solution) or **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (0.1% solution).

3.  **Soil Salinity/Alkalinity:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, leaf tip burn, yellowing, reduced tillering, and overall drying symptoms due to physiological drought.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Conduct soil analysis to determine salinity/alkalinity levels.
        *   Apply soil amendments like **Gypsum** for sodic soils.
        *   Leach salts from the root zone with good quality irrigation water.
        *   Cultivate salt-tolerant sugarcane varieties.

### II. Pest Infestations

Certain pests can cause significant damage leading to drying of plant parts.

1.  **Sugarcane Borers (Early Shoot Borer, Top Borer, Internode Borer):**
    *   **Symptoms:**
        *   **Early Shoot Borer (*Chilo infuscatellus*):** Causes "dead heart" (drying of the central shoot) in young plants.
        *   **Top Borer (*Scirpophaga excerptalis*):** Causes "dead heart" in older plants, shot-hole symptoms on leaves, and drying of the top leaves and growing point.
        *   **Internode Borer (*Chilo sacchariphagus indicus*):** Damages internodes, leading to drying of affected stalks and reduced juice quality.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Mechanical removal and destruction of "dead hearts" and affected shoots.
        *   Release of biological control agents like *Trichogramma chilonis* or *Trichogramma japonicum* egg parasitoids.
        *   Chemical control (granular application or drenching):
            *   **Chlorantraniliprole** (0.4% G) @ 7.5 kg/acre.
            *   **Fipronil** (0.3% G) @ 10-12.5 kg/acre.
            *   **Cartap hydrochloride** (4% G) @ 10 kg/acre.

2.  **Termites:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Wilting and drying of entire clumps, especially in patches. Inspection reveals hollowed-out setts, roots, and lower portions of stalks.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Pre-treatment of setts before planting: Dip setts in a solution of **Chlorpyrifos** (20% EC) @ 2.5 ml/L water for 10-15 minutes.
        *   Soil drenching at planting or during early stages: **Chlorpyrifos** (20% EC) @ 2.5 L/acre or **Fipronil** (5% SC) @ 400-500 ml/acre.

### III. Diseases

Several fungal and phytoplasmal diseases can cause drying symptoms.

1.  **Red Rot (*Colletotrichum falcatum* / *Glomerella tucumanensis*):**
    *   **Symptoms:** One of the most destructive diseases. Initial symptoms include drying of leaves from the top downwards, often starting with the third or fourth leaf. The midrib of affected leaves may show reddish discoloration. Internally, the stalk shows characteristic reddening with white cross-bands.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Use resistant or tolerant sugarcane varieties.
        *   Plant healthy, disease-free setts.
        *   Hot water treatment of setts (50°C for 2 hours) or moist hot air treatment (54°C for 4 hours) to eliminate inoculum.
        *   Remove and destroy infected clumps immediately.
        *   Sett treatment with fungicides: Dip setts in a solution of **Carbendazim** (50% WP) @ 0.1% (1 g/L water) for 10-15 minutes.

2.  **Wilt (*Fusarium moniliforme* / *Gibberella fujikuroi*):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Sudden wilting and drying of entire clumps, often confused with red rot. However, internal symptoms differ; stalks become hollow and pithy, and may show a dull reddish or purplish discoloration without the distinct white cross-bands of red rot.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Use resistant varieties.
        *   Plant healthy, disease-free setts.
        *   Hot water treatment of setts.
        *   Remove and destroy infected clumps.
        *   Sett treatment with fungicides: Dip setts in a solution of **Carbendazim** (50% WP) @ 0.1% (1 g/L water) for 10-15 minutes.

3.  **Grassy Shoot Disease (GSD) (Phytoplasma):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Characterized by profuse tillering, stunting, yellowing, and drying of leaves, especially in severe cases. The affected plants produce numerous thin, chlorotic shoots resembling grass.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Use healthy, disease-free setts from certified nurseries.
        *   Hot water treatment of setts (50°C for 2 hours) or moist hot air treatment (54°C for 4 hours).
        *   Rogue out and destroy infected clumps promptly.
        *   Use resistant varieties.

4.  **Leaf Scorch (*Stagonospora sacchari*):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Small, reddish-brown spots appear on leaves, which enlarge and coalesce, forming large necrotic areas. This leads to extensive drying and shredding of leaves, particularly under humid conditions.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Use resistant varieties.
        *   Remove and destroy severely infected leaves.
        *   Fungicide sprays (if severe): **Mancozeb** (75% WP) @ 2.5 kg/acre in 500-750 L of water.

### General Recommendations for Integrated Management:

*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy all crop residues, weeds, and infected plant parts to reduce inoculum/pest reservoirs.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Always choose sugarcane varieties recommended for Haryana that are resistant or tolerant to major pests and diseases.
*   **Healthy Planting Material:** Use only healthy, disease-free setts from reliable sources or certified nurseries. Sett treatment is highly recommended.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure balanced application of macro and micronutrients based on soil test reports to maintain plant vigor and resistance.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate sugarcane with non-host crops to break the pest and disease cycles.
*   **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your field for early signs of stress, pests, or diseases to allow for timely intervention.

By carefully observing the specific symptoms and considering the environmental conditions, you can pinpoint the cause of drying up and apply the most appropriate and scientifically verified management strategies.
