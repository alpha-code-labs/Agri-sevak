As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies in Sugarcane in Haryana:

### Control of Beetles (specifically White Grubs) in Sugarcane

White grubs are the most significant beetle pest affecting sugarcane roots in Haryana. The adult beetles emerge during the monsoon season and lay eggs in the soil, with the grubs feeding on the roots, leading to wilting and death of plants.

**Cultural Control:**
*   Deep ploughing during summer exposes grubs and pupae to predators and sun.
*   Collection and destruction of adult beetles (which are attracted to light) during their emergence period can reduce subsequent grub populations.
*   Avoid planting sugarcane in fields with a history of severe white grub infestation.

**Chemical Control (for White Grubs):**
For effective control, apply insecticides at the time of planting or during earthing up, ensuring the chemical reaches the root zone.

*   **Fipronil** 0.3% GR: Apply 25-33 kg/acre as a soil application at planting or during earthing up.
*   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: Apply 2.0 L/acre mixed with irrigation water or as a drenching application around the root zone.
*   **Chlorantraniliprole** 0.4% GR: Apply 7.5 kg/acre as a soil application at planting or during earthing up.

### Control of Weevils in Sugarcane

Weevils are generally not considered a major pest of sugarcane in Haryana. Specific control recommendations for weevils in sugarcane are not typically issued by HAU due to their minor economic impact. If localized infestations occur, it is advisable to consult with HAU experts for specific identification and recommendation.

### Control of Sawflies in Sugarcane

This is not known to affect Sugarcane.
