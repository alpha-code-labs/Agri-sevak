Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, I understand your concern regarding Wilt and Parawilt in sugarcane, which can significantly impact yield in Haryana. It's crucial to adopt an integrated approach for effective management.

First, let's briefly understand the two conditions:

*   **Wilt (Fungal Wilt):** Primarily caused by the fungus *Fusarium sacchari*. It's a vascular disease where the fungus blocks the water-conducting tissues, leading to gradual wilting, drying of leaves from top downwards, and internal reddish discoloration of the stalk. It's often exacerbated by poor drainage and nutrient deficiencies.
*   **Parawilt (Physiological Wilt):** This is a non-pathogenic, physiological disorder, often triggered by sudden changes in environmental conditions, particularly a sudden dry spell after a period of good moisture, or waterlogging followed by drought. It causes sudden, irreversible wilting of the entire plant without any internal discoloration or fungal growth.

Here's a comprehensive strategy for their control:

### Integrated Management Strategies for Wilt and Parawilt in Sugarcane

**1. Varietal Selection:**
*   Plant resistant or tolerant varieties recommended for Haryana. Consult HAU's latest recommendations for your specific region.

**2. Healthy Seed Material:**
*   Always use healthy, disease-free setts (seed cane) from a reliable source. Avoid using setts from fields with a history of wilt.
*   **Sett Treatment (Crucial for Wilt Prevention):**
    *   **Chemical Sett Treatment:** Dip the setts in a fungicidal solution for 10-15 minutes before planting.
        *   **Carbendazim** 1 g/L of water
        *   **Thiophanate methyl** 1 g/L of water
    *   **Biological Sett Treatment:** Treat setts with a bio-fungicide.
        *   **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum** 10 g/kg of setts. This can be done after chemical treatment (if used, allow setts to dry slightly before applying Trichoderma) or as a standalone treatment.

**3. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid continuous cultivation of sugarcane in the same field, especially if wilt has been observed. Rotate with non-host crops like paddy, wheat, or legumes for at least 2-3 years.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris and stubble after harvest to reduce inoculum load in the soil.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:**
    *   Ensure adequate and balanced application of NPK fertilizers based on soil test recommendations.
    *   **Potassium (K) application is particularly important** as it enhances plant vigor and resistance to both biotic (wilt) and abiotic (parawilt) stresses.
*   **Water Management:**
    *   **For Wilt:** Ensure proper field drainage to prevent waterlogging, which favors fungal growth.
    *   **For Parawilt:** Provide timely and adequate irrigation, especially during critical growth stages and periods of high temperature or dry spells. Avoid sudden moisture stress.
*   **Soil Health:** Incorporate organic matter (farmyard manure, compost, green manure) to improve soil structure, water holding capacity, and microbial activity, which can suppress soil-borne pathogens.

**4. Biological Soil Application (for Wilt):**
*   For fields with a history of wilt, apply bio-control agents to the soil.
    *   **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum** 2.5 kg/acre mixed with 50-100 kg of farmyard manure or compost, applied at the time of planting or during earthing up.

**5. Specific Measures for Parawilt:**
*   **Timely Irrigation:** As mentioned, consistent moisture availability is key. Avoid long gaps between irrigations, especially during hot and dry periods.
*   **Potassium and Silicon Application:** Adequate potassium helps in osmoregulation and stress tolerance. Silicon application can also improve plant resilience to drought stress.
*   **Mulching:** Applying organic mulch (e.g., sugarcane trash) can help conserve soil moisture and regulate soil temperature, reducing the risk of parawilt.

By implementing these integrated strategies, you can significantly reduce the incidence and severity of both Wilt and Parawilt in your sugarcane fields. Regular field monitoring is also essential to detect symptoms early and take prompt action.
