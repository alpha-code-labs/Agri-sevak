As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Sugarcane in Haryana:

### Control Measures for Pests in Sugarcane

1.  **Grasshopper:**
    Grasshoppers can cause significant defoliation, especially in young sugarcane crops. Integrated pest management strategies are recommended.

    *   **Cultural Control:**
        *   Monitor fields regularly, especially during the early growth stages.
        *   Mechanical collection and destruction of nymphs and adults can be effective in small areas or early infestations.
    *   **Chemical Control:**
        In case of severe infestation, the following CIBRC approved insecticides can be used:
        *   **Malathion** 50% EC: Apply 1.0 - 1.25 L per acre mixed in 200-400 L of water.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: Apply 200-250 ml per acre mixed in 200-400 L of water.
        *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: Apply 1.0 - 1.25 L per acre mixed in 200-400 L of water.
        *   **Fipronil** 5% SC: Apply 400-600 ml per acre mixed in 200-400 L of water.

2.  **Painted bug (Bagrada hilaris):**
    This is not known to affect Sugarcane. Painted bug is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops like mustard, cabbage, and radish.

3.  **Red cotton bug (Dysdercus cingulatus):**
    This is not known to affect Sugarcane. Red cotton bug is a major pest of cotton and other malvaceous plants, feeding on developing seeds.

4.  **Black ants:**
    Black ants are generally not primary pests of sugarcane. They are often found in sugarcane fields due to their association with honeydew-producing insects like aphids, mealybugs, or scale insects, which they protect from natural enemies. Direct damage to sugarcane by black ants is rare, but they can sometimes interfere with young plant establishment or be a nuisance.

    *   **Primary Strategy:**
        *   The most effective way to manage ants in sugarcane is to control the primary honeydew-producing sap-sucking pests (e.g., aphids, mealybugs, scale insects) that attract them. Once the source of honeydew is removed, ant populations will naturally decline.
    *   **Direct Chemical Control (if ants are causing significant direct issues, e.g., damaging setts or young shoots):**
        *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: Apply 1.0 - 1.25 L per acre as a drench around the base of affected plants or through irrigation water, especially during planting for sett protection.
        *   **Fipronil** 0.3% GR: Apply 10-15 kg per acre as a soil application, particularly effective against ants and other soil pests.

Always ensure proper safety measures, wear protective gear, and follow the instructions on the product label for safe and effective application of any chemical.
