This is not known to affect Sugarcane.

Fruit flies (Tephritidae family) and Ber fly (*Carpomyia vesuviana*) are primarily pests of fruit crops, where they damage the developing fruits. Sugarcane is a grass crop, and its economic part is the stem (stalk), not a fruit. Therefore, these pests do not infest sugarcane.

For sugarcane, common insect pests in Haryana include:
*   Sugarcane borers (e.g., Top borer, Stalk borer, Root borer)
*   Pyrilla
*   Whiteflies
*   Mealybugs
*   Termites

If you are observing damage in your sugarcane crop, please provide more details or samples for accurate identification of the pest or disease, so that appropriate control measures can be recommended.
