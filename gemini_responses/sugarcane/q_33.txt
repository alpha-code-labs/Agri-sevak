As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend an integrated approach for effective weed management in sugarcane, combining cultural, mechanical, and chemical methods.

Here's a scientifically verified guide for controlling the mentioned weeds in sugarcane:

### Integrated Weed Management Strategy

1.  **Cultural Practices:** Use healthy, weed-free setts, proper land preparation, timely planting, and adequate spacing to promote vigorous crop growth that can outcompete weeds.
2.  **Mechanical Methods:** Inter-row cultivation (hoeing, earthing up) is highly effective, especially in the early stages, to remove weeds and aerate the soil.
3.  **Chemical Control:** Herbicides play a crucial role, especially for large areas and persistent weeds.

### Chemical Control Recommendations

**A. Pre-emergence Application (within 3 days of planting, on moist soil):**
These herbicides control germinating broadleaf and narrowleaf weeds, including *Bathu*, *Congress grass*, and *Phalaris minor*.

*   **For Broadleaf and Narrowleaf Weeds:**
    *   **Atrazine** (50% WP) at 2.0-3.0 kg/acre in 400-500 L of water. (Lower dose for light soils, higher for heavy soils).
    *   **Metribuzin** (70% WP) at 1.0 kg/acre in 400-500 L of water.
    *   **Pendimethalin** (30% EC) at 1.0-1.3 L/acre in 400-500 L of water.
    *   **Diuron** (80% WP) at 1.0-1.2 kg/acre in 400-500 L of water.
    *   **Oxyfluorfen** (23.5% EC) at 200-300 ml/acre in 400-500 L of water.
    *   **Tank Mix Option:** **Atrazine** (1.5 kg/acre) + **Pendimethalin** (1.0 L/acre) in 400-500 L of water for broader spectrum control.

**B. Post-emergence Application (when weeds are at 2-4 leaf stage, typically 30-45 days after planting):**
These herbicides target emerged weeds. Ensure good soil moisture for optimal efficacy.

*   **For Broadleaf Weeds (including Bathu, Congress grass):**
    *   **2,4-D sodium salt** (80% WP) at 1.0 kg/acre in 400-500 L of water.
    *   **2,4-D amine salt** (58% SL) at 1.0 L/acre in 400-500 L of water.
    *   **Metribuzin** (70% WP) at 500 g/acre in 400-500 L of water (effective on small broadleaf weeds).
    *   **Amicarbazone** (70% WG) at 700 g/acre in 400-500 L of water.

*   **For Narrowleaf Weeds (including Phalaris minor) and some Broadleaf Weeds:**
    *   **Topramezone** (33.6% SC) at 25-30 ml/acre with a suitable surfactant in 200-300 L of water.
    *   **Quizalofop-ethyl** (5% EC) at 400-500 ml/acre in 200-300 L of water (grass-specific).
    *   **Fenoxaprop-p-ethyl** (9% EC) at 500-600 ml/acre in 200-300 L of water (grass-specific).

*   **For Mixed Weed Flora (Broadleaf and Narrowleaf):**
    *   **Tank Mix Option:** **Atrazine** (1.0 kg/acre) + **2,4-D sodium salt** (500 g/acre) in 400-500 L of water.
    *   **Tank Mix Option:** **Metribuzin** (500 g/acre) + **2,4-D sodium salt** (500 g/acre) in 400-500 L of water.

### Specific Weed Conditions

*   **Amarbail (Cuscuta):** This is not known to be a significant weed problem in sugarcane fields in Haryana.
*   **Orobanche:** This is not known to affect Sugarcane.

### Important Considerations

*   **Water Volume:** Always use the recommended water volume for uniform spray coverage.
*   **Spray Nozzle:** Use a flat fan nozzle for herbicide application.
*   **Soil Moisture:** Pre-emergence herbicides require adequate soil moisture for activation.
*   **Weed Stage:** Post-emergence herbicides are most effective when weeds are young and actively growing.
*   **Crop Stage:** Ensure the sugarcane crop is at the recommended stage for post-emergence applications to avoid phytotoxicity.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) and follow label instructions for safe handling and application of chemicals.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate herbicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of herbicide resistance in weeds.
