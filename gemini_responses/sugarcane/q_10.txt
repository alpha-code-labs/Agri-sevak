As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for managing pests in Sugarcane in Haryana:

### Control of Borers in Sugarcane

Sugarcane borers are a major pest complex in Haryana, including Top Borer (*Scirpophaga excerptalis*), Stalk Borer (*Chilo auricilius*), and Root Borer (*Emmalocera depressella*).

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Timely planting:** Plant sugarcane at the recommended time to avoid peak pest incidence.
    *   **Removal of dead hearts:** Regularly remove and destroy shoots affected by early shoot borer and top borer (dead hearts) to reduce pest population.
    *   **Detrashing:** Remove dry and senescent leaves at 120 and 180 days after planting to expose borers and reduce their hiding places.
    *   **Balanced fertilization:** Avoid excessive nitrogen application, which can make the crop more susceptible.
    *   **Proper irrigation:** Maintain optimal soil moisture.
    *   **Collection and destruction of egg masses:** Regularly scout for and destroy egg masses of borers.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Release of parasitoids like *Trichogramma chilonis* or *T. japonicum* egg parasitoids (50,000 parasitoids/acre, 4-6 releases at 10-15 day intervals) can be effective against early shoot borer and top borer.
    *   Application of entomopathogenic fungi like *Beauveria bassiana* can also be considered.

3.  **Chemical Control (Apply only when pest incidence crosses Economic Threshold Level):**
    *   **For Early Shoot Borer and Top Borer:**
        *   Spray application:
            *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC at 150 ml/acre.
            *   **Flubendiamide** 20% WG at 125 g/acre.
            *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG at 80 g/acre.
            *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 250 ml/acre.
        *   Granular application (for soil application at planting or earthing up):
            *   **Fipronil** 0.3% GR at 25-33 kg/acre.
            *   **Cartap hydrochloride** 4% GR at 25 kg/acre.
    *   **For Stalk Borer:**
        *   Spray application:
            *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC at 150 ml/acre.
            *   **Flubendiamide** 20% WG at 125 g/acre.
            *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG at 80 g/acre.
        *   Granular application (at earthing up):
            *   **Cartap hydrochloride** 4% GR at 25 kg/acre.
    *   **For Root Borer:**
        *   Granular application (at planting or earthing up):
            *   **Fipronil** 0.3% GR at 25-33 kg/acre.

### Control of Caterpillars (General Defoliators like Armyworms) in Sugarcane

While borers are the primary caterpillar pests, general defoliating caterpillars like armyworms (*Mythimna separata*) can occasionally cause damage, especially in young crops.

**Chemical Control (if significant defoliation occurs):**
*   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC at 150 ml/acre.
*   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG at 80 g/acre.
*   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 250 ml/acre.
