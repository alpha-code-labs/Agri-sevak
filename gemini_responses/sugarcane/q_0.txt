As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Sugarcane in Haryana:

First, let's address the diseases listed that are not commonly known to significantly affect Sugarcane:

*   **Alternaria:** This is not known to affect Sugarcane significantly as a major disease.
*   **Blast:** This is not known to affect Sugarcane. (Blast is primarily a disease of rice).
*   **Powdery mildew:** This is not known to affect Sugarcane as a major disease.
*   **Grey mildew:** This is not known to affect Sugarcane.

Now, let's discuss the control measures for the fungal diseases that are known to affect Sugarcane:

### 1. Anthracnose (Primarily Red Rot caused by *Colletotrichum falcatum*)

Anthracnose symptoms on sugarcane leaves can be caused by *Colletotrichum falcatum*, the same fungus responsible for Red Rot, the most devastating disease of sugarcane. Control measures primarily focus on managing Red Rot.

**Cultural Practices:**
*   Plant resistant or moderately resistant sugarcane varieties. This is the most crucial step.
*   Use healthy, disease-free setts (planting material).
*   Treat setts with hot water (50°C for 2 hours) or hot air (54°C for 4 hours) before planting, if facilities are available.
*   Rogue out and destroy infected clumps immediately upon identification.
*   Avoid ratooning (allowing regrowth from stubble) in fields with a history of Red Rot.
*   Ensure proper field sanitation and drainage.

**Chemical Control (for sett treatment):**
*   Dip setts in a solution of **Carbendazim** 0.1% (1 g/L water) for 10-15 minutes before planting.
*   Alternatively, dip setts in a solution of **Thiophanate methyl** 0.1% (1 g/L water) for 10-15 minutes.

### 2. Blight and Brown Spot (*Cercospora longipes* and other leaf spot fungi)

"Blight" is a general term for rapid and extensive browning, death, and wilting of plant tissues. In sugarcane, various fungi can cause leaf spots and blighting symptoms, with Brown Spot (*Cercospora longipes*) being a common one. Other fungi like *Stagonospora sacchari* (Ring Spot) and *Leptosphaeria sacchari* (Leaf Scorch) can also cause similar symptoms.

**Cultural Practices:**
*   Plant resistant or tolerant varieties.
*   Maintain proper plant spacing to ensure good air circulation.
*   Provide balanced nutrition to plants, avoiding excessive nitrogen.
*   Remove and destroy severely infected leaves or plant debris.

**Chemical Control (Foliar Sprays):**
*   Spray with **Mancozeb** at 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L water).
*   Alternatively, spray with **Chlorothalonil** at 2 kg/acre (or 2 g/L water).
*   For systemic action, spray with **Propiconazole** at 500 ml/acre (or 1 ml/L water).
*   Another systemic option is **Azoxystrobin** at 200 ml/acre (or 0.5 ml/L water).
*   **Tebuconazole** can also be used at 300 ml/acre (or 0.75 ml/L water).
*   **Copper oxychloride** can be used at 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L water).
*   Apply fungicides at the first appearance of symptoms and repeat every 10-15 days if the disease persists, especially during humid conditions.

### 3. Downy Mildew (*Peronosclerospora sacchari*)

Downy mildew is characterized by white streaks on leaves, often leading to stunted growth and poor cane development.

**Cultural Practices:**
*   Plant resistant varieties.
*   Use disease-free setts for planting.
*   Rogue out and destroy infected plants as soon as they are noticed to prevent further spread.
*   Ensure good field hygiene.

**Chemical Control (Foliar Sprays):**
*   Spray with a combination product of **Metalaxyl + Mancozeb** at 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L water).
*   Alternatively, spray with **Propamocarb hydrochloride** at 2 ml/L water.
*   **Fosetyl-aluminium** can also be used at 2.5 g/L water.
*   Initiate sprays upon the appearance of initial symptoms and repeat as necessary, typically at 10-15 day intervals, especially during periods conducive to disease development.

**General Recommendations:**
*   Always follow an Integrated Disease Management (IDM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods for sustainable control.
*   Consult your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for specific variety recommendations and the most current disease situation in your area.
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the fungicide label for correct dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
