As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling sucking pests in Sugarcane in Haryana.

First, regarding your list of pests:
*   Aphids, Leafhoppers (including Pyrilla), Whiteflies, and Thrips are known to affect Sugarcane in Haryana and can cause significant damage.
*   **Psylla:** This is not known to affect Sugarcane.

Here's an integrated approach for managing the common sucking pests (Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips) in Sugarcane:

**I. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Principles:**

1.  **Monitoring:** Regularly scout your fields to detect pest infestations early. Look for characteristic symptoms like honeydew, sooty mould, yellowing leaves, or the presence of the pests themselves on the underside of leaves.
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Maintain field sanitation by removing weeds, which can act as alternate hosts for pests.
    *   Ensure proper nutrient management, as excessive nitrogen can sometimes lead to lush growth that attracts sucking pests.
    *   Use resistant or tolerant sugarcane varieties if available and suitable for your region.
3.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Conserve natural enemies like ladybird beetles, lacewings, and parasitic wasps, which prey on aphids, whiteflies, and leafhoppers. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides if natural enemy populations are high.
    *   For Pyrilla (Sugarcane Leafhopper), release of its egg parasitoid, *Epiricania melanoleuca*, can be highly effective.

**II. Chemical Control (When pest populations exceed economic threshold levels):**

When chemical intervention is necessary, choose CIBRC-approved insecticides and ensure thorough coverage, especially on the underside of leaves where these pests often reside. Always use sufficient water volume (typically 200-400 litres per acre depending on crop stage and canopy density) for effective spray.

Here are some recommended insecticides:

*   **For Aphids, Leafhoppers (Pyrilla), and Whiteflies:**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** 125 - 150 ml per acre
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** 100 g per acre
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** 100 - 125 g per acre
    *   **Flonicamid 50% WG:** 60 g per acre

*   **For Thrips (and also effective against Leafhoppers and Whiteflies):**
    *   **Fipronil 5% SC:** 400 - 600 ml per acre

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Rotation of Chemicals:** To prevent the development of insecticide resistance, it is crucial to rotate insecticides with different modes of action if multiple sprays are required. Do not use the same chemical group repeatedly.
*   **Timing of Application:** Apply insecticides when pests are in their early nymphal stages for better efficacy.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying. Follow the instructions on the product label carefully regarding dosage, application method, and pre-harvest interval.
*   **Consultation:** For specific pest outbreaks or unusual symptoms, it is always advisable to consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for precise recommendations.
