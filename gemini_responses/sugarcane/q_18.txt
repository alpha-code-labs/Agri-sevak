As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified recommendations for the use of growth regulators and micronutrients in Sugarcane in Haryana:

### Recommended Doses of Growth Regulators/Hormones and Micronutrients in Sugarcane

*   **Ethephon** (commonly known by brand name Ethrel)
    *   **Purpose:** Used as a ripening agent to enhance sugar recovery in mature sugarcane. It should be applied 4-6 weeks before the anticipated harvest.
    *   **Recommended Dose:** Apply **Ethephon** 39% SL at 1.25 - 2.5 L per acre (equivalent to 500-1000 g active ingredient per acre) in 200-300 L of water. Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.

*   **2,4-D**
    *   **Purpose:** While **2,4-D** is a synthetic auxin and can act as a growth regulator, its primary and widely recommended use in sugarcane in Haryana is as a herbicide for broadleaf weed control. Its specific recommendation as a *growth regulator* (e.g., for flowering control or yield enhancement) is not a standard practice or widely recommended by HAU for sugarcane cultivation in Haryana. Therefore, a specific dose for its use as a growth regulator is not provided.

*   **Boron** (as a micronutrient)
    *   **Purpose:** Boron is an essential micronutrient for sugarcane, playing a crucial role in cell wall formation, sugar translocation, and pollen viability. Deficiency can lead to stunted growth, hollow stalks, and reduced sugar content.
    *   **Recommended Dose (Foliar Application):**
        *   Apply **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate, 10.5% Boron) at 1-2 kg per acre dissolved in 200-300 L of water (0.5% - 1.0% solution).
        *   Alternatively, use **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (20.5% Boron) at 0.5-1 kg per acre dissolved in 200-300 L of water (0.25% - 0.5% solution).
        *   **Timing:** Apply during the tillering stage or grand growth phase, especially if deficiency symptoms are observed or soil tests indicate low Boron levels.
    *   **Recommended Dose (Soil Application):**
        *   If soil tests indicate severe Boron deficiency, apply **Borax** at 10-15 kg per acre as a basal application at the time of planting or ratooning.
