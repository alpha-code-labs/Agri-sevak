As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling viral diseases in Sugarcane in Haryana:

It is important to understand that direct chemical control for viral diseases is generally not possible. Management focuses on preventing infection, using resistant varieties, and controlling the vectors that transmit these viruses.

Let's address each condition you've mentioned:

*   **Sugarcane Mosaic (Sugarcane Mosaic Virus - SCMV):**
    This is a significant viral disease of sugarcane, characterized by light green or yellowish streaks and mottling on the leaves, often forming a mosaic pattern. It can lead to reduced growth and yield. SCMV is primarily transmitted by aphids.

    *   **Management:**
        *   **Use healthy seed material:** Plant only certified, disease-free setts from a reputable source. Avoid using setts from fields with mosaic symptoms.
        *   **Resistant varieties:** Cultivate sugarcane varieties known to be resistant or tolerant to SCMV. Consult HAU for recommended varieties suitable for Haryana.
        *   **Rogueing:** Regularly inspect fields and remove (rogue out) and destroy infected plants, especially in the early stages of crop growth, to reduce the source of inoculum.
        *   **Vector control (Aphids):** Control aphid populations, which transmit the virus.
            *   **Foliar spray:**
                *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL at 125 ml/acre (in 200-400 L water)
                *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG at 50 g/acre (in 200-400 L water)
                *   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP at 100 g/acre (in 200-400 L water)
            *   **Seed treatment (for early protection):**
                *   **Imidacloprid** 600 FS at 7 ml/kg of setts.

*   **Stripe (Sugarcane Streak Virus - SSV):**
    Sugarcane Streak Virus causes characteristic narrow, broken, chlorotic (yellowish) streaks or stripes on the leaves, running parallel to the veins. Infected plants may show stunting and reduced tillering. SSV is transmitted by specific leafhopper species.

    *   **Management:**
        *   **Use healthy seed material:** Plant only certified, disease-free setts.
        *   **Resistant varieties:** Opt for sugarcane varieties known to be resistant to SSV.
        *   **Rogueing:** Remove and destroy infected plants promptly.
        *   **Vector control (Leafhoppers):** Control leafhopper populations.
            *   **Foliar spray:**
                *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL at 125 ml/acre (in 200-400 L water)
                *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG at 50 g/acre (in 200-400 L water)
                *   **Fipronil** 5% SC at 600-800 ml/acre (in 200-400 L water)

*   **Leaf curl:**
    A specific "Sugarcane Leaf Curl Virus" is not commonly recognized as a distinct disease of sugarcane. However, symptoms of leaf rolling or curling can be associated with other conditions, including:
    *   **Sugarcane Yellow Leaf Virus (SCYLV):** This virus causes yellowing of the midrib and older leaves, which may also show rolling or curling, particularly towards the tip. It can lead to reduced growth and yield. SCYLV is transmitted by aphids.
    *   **Environmental stress:** Water stress, nutrient deficiencies, or herbicide injury can also cause leaf curling.
    *   **Management for SCYLV (if suspected):**
        *   **Use healthy seed material:** Plant only certified, disease-free setts. Hot water treatment (50°C for 2 hours) of setts can help reduce the incidence of some diseases, though its efficacy against SCYLV in setts can vary.
        *   **Resistant varieties:** Choose varieties known to be tolerant or resistant to SCYLV.
        *   **Rogueing:** Remove and destroy infected plants.
        *   **Vector control (Aphids):** As mentioned for Sugarcane Mosaic Virus.
            *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL at 125 ml/acre
            *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG at 50 g/acre
            *   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP at 100 g/acre

*   **Stunt virus:**
    A specific "Sugarcane Stunt Virus" is not a commonly recognized name for a sugarcane disease. However, stunting is a common symptom of several sugarcane diseases, including:
    *   **Sugarcane Streak Virus (SSV):** As described above, infected plants often show stunting.
    *   **Sugarcane Yellow Leaf Virus (SCYLV):** Severe infections can lead to stunting.
    *   **Sugarcane Grassy Shoot Disease (SCGSD):** While caused by a phytoplasma (not a virus), it is a major stunting disease characterized by excessive tillering, grassy appearance, and severe stunting.
    *   **Management:** The management strategies for stunting symptoms would depend on the underlying cause. For viral causes like SSV and SCYLV, follow the recommendations provided above. For SCGSD, hot water treatment of setts (50°C for 2 hours) is highly effective, along with using healthy setts and resistant varieties.

*   **Yellow vein clearing:**
    This is not known to affect Sugarcane. This symptom is typically associated with viral diseases in other crops like Okra (Okra Yellow Vein Mosaic Virus).

*   **Tristeza:**
    This is not known to affect Sugarcane. Tristeza is a major viral disease of citrus (Citrus Tristeza Virus).

**General Principles for Viral Disease Management in Sugarcane:**

1.  **Certified Seed Cane:** Always use healthy, certified seed cane (setts) from reliable sources. This is the most critical step in preventing viral diseases.
2.  **Resistant Varieties:** Plant sugarcane varieties that are known to be resistant or tolerant to the prevalent viral diseases in your region. Consult HAU for the latest recommendations.
3.  **Sanitation:** Maintain field hygiene by removing and destroying infected plants (rogueing) and weeds that can harbor viruses or their vectors.
4.  **Vector Control:** Implement timely control measures for insect vectors (aphids, leafhoppers) that transmit viruses.
5.  **Crop Rotation:** While sugarcane is a long-duration crop, practicing crop rotation in surrounding areas can help reduce pest populations and disease inoculum.
6.  **Hot Water Treatment:** For some diseases (like Grassy Shoot Disease, which causes stunting), hot water treatment of setts (e.g., 50°C for 2 hours) can be effective in eliminating the pathogen.
