Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I would like to provide you with scientifically verified advice regarding smut diseases in Sugarcane.

It is important to clarify that among the diseases you mentioned, only **Sugarcane Smut (often referred to as Black Smut or Whip Smut)** is known to affect sugarcane. The other smut diseases, namely False Smut, Kernel Smut, and Loose Smut, are primarily diseases of other cereal crops and are not known to affect sugarcane.

### Control Measures for Sugarcane Smut (*Sporisorium scitamineum*)

Sugarcane smut is a serious fungal disease that can significantly reduce yield. Effective management relies on an integrated approach combining cultural practices and chemical control.

**I. Cultural and Mechanical Control Measures:**

*   **Planting Resistant Varieties:** This is the most crucial and effective method for managing sugarcane smut. Always select and plant smut-resistant or moderately resistant varieties recommended by HAU for your region in Haryana. Consult your local agricultural extension office or HAU for the latest recommendations.
*   **Use Healthy Seed Material:** Obtain seed cane (setts) only from healthy, disease-free fields. Avoid using seed from fields with a history of smut infection.
*   **Hot Water Treatment (HWT) or Hot Air Treatment (HAT):** For seed cane, treating setts with hot water (e.g., 50°C for 2 hours) or hot air (e.g., 54°C for 4 hours) can help eliminate internal fungal spores. This should be done under expert supervision.
*   **Roguing of Infected Clumps:** Regularly inspect your fields, especially during the early growth stages (30-90 days after planting). Identify and carefully remove (rogue) any plants showing the characteristic "whip-like" smut sori before they burst and release spores. The rogued plants should be immediately buried deep in the soil or burned away from the field to prevent further spread.
*   **Avoid Ratooning Infected Fields:** If a plant crop is heavily infected with smut, it is advisable not to take a ratoon crop from that field, as the disease will persist and intensify in the ratoon.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy all infected plant debris after harvest.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops for at least one season to reduce the inoculum load in the soil.

**II. Chemical Control Measures (Sett Treatment):**

Chemical treatment of setts before planting can provide protection against primary infection. Always use CIBRC (Central Insecticides Board & Registration Committee) approved chemicals and follow the recommended dosages strictly.

*   **Fungicide Sett Treatment:** Dip the sugarcane setts in a fungicidal solution before planting.
    *   **Option 1:**
        *   **Technical Chemical Name:** **Carboxin 37.5% + Thiram 37.5% WS**
        *   **Dosage:** 200 grams per 100 litres of water.
        *   **Method:** Dip the setts for 10-15 minutes in this solution before planting.
    *   **Option 2:**
        *   **Technical Chemical Name:** **Tebuconazole 2% DS**
        *   **Dosage:** 100 grams per 100 litres of water.
        *   **Method:** Dip the setts for 10-15 minutes in this solution before planting.
    *   **Option 3:**
        *   **Technical Chemical Name:** **Triadimefon 25% WP**
        *   **Dosage:** 100 grams per 100 litres of water.
        *   **Method:** Dip the setts for 10-15 minutes in this solution before planting.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the fungicide label carefully.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Consult with HAU experts or your local agricultural extension worker for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and the latest approved practices.

### Regarding other Smut Diseases:

*   **False Smut:** This is not known to affect Sugarcane. It is primarily a disease of rice.
*   **Kernel Smut:** This is not known to affect Sugarcane. It is primarily a disease of sorghum and other cereals.
*   **Loose Smut:** This is not known to affect Sugarcane. It is primarily a disease of wheat and barley.

By implementing these integrated management strategies, you can effectively control sugarcane smut and ensure a healthy and productive crop.
