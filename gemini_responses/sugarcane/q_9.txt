Mites, including Red spider mite (Oligonychus coffeae) and Rust mite (Phyllocoptruta saccharina), are known to affect Sugarcane, particularly during dry and hot weather conditions. Effective control involves an integrated approach.

Here's how to control Mites in Sugarcane:

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Maintain optimal irrigation:** Water stress can exacerbate mite infestations. Ensure adequate moisture in the field.
*   **Field sanitation:** Remove weeds and crop residues that can harbor mites.
*   **Avoid excessive nitrogen:** Over-fertilization with nitrogen can lead to lush, succulent growth that is more attractive to mites.

**2. Chemical Control (Acaricides):**
When mite populations reach economic threshold levels, chemical intervention may be necessary. Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where mites often reside.

*   **Spiromesifen** 22.9% SC: Apply 125 ml per acre in 200-300 litres of water.
*   **Propargite** 57% EC: Apply 1.0 - 1.25 litres per acre in 200-300 litres of water.
*   **Fenpyroximate** 5% SC: Apply 300-400 ml per acre in 200-300 litres of water.
*   **Wettable Sulphur** 80% WP: Apply 1.5 - 2.0 kg per acre in 200-300 litres of water. (This is particularly effective against rust mites and also provides general mite suppression).
*   **Abamectin** 1.9% EC: Apply 150-200 ml per acre in 200-300 litres of water.
*   **Hexythiazox** 5.45% EC: Apply 200-250 ml per acre in 200-300 litres of water. (This is a mite growth regulator, effective against eggs and nymphs).

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Rotation of chemicals:** To prevent the development of resistance, rotate acaricides with different modes of action.
*   **Timing of application:** Apply acaricides when mite populations are building up, before they cause significant damage.
*   **Repeat application:** Depending on the severity of infestation and the residual action of the chosen chemical, a second application after 10-15 days might be necessary.

Always follow the instructions on the product label for safe and effective use. For specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions, it is advisable to consult with local agricultural extension specialists.
