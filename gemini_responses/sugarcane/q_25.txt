As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice on irrigation management for Sugarcane in Haryana:

Sugarcane is a long-duration, high-water-requiring crop, and efficient irrigation management is crucial for maximizing yield and sugar recovery. The timing and amount of irrigation depend on soil type, weather conditions, and the crop's growth stage.

### **1. First Irrigation**

The first irrigation is critical for ensuring good germination and establishment of the sugarcane crop.

*   **Timing:**
    *   If the field was prepared with a pre-sowing irrigation (palewa) and planting was done in optimum moisture, the first irrigation should be given around **3-4 weeks after planting**.
    *   If planting was done in dry soil followed by irrigation, or if the soil dries out quickly after planting, a light irrigation may be required sooner, within **7-10 days** of planting, to aid germination.
*   **Purpose:** It helps in dissolving the soil nutrients, making them available to the germinating buds, and softening the soil for shoot emergence.
*   **Method:** It should be a light to moderate irrigation (approximately **50-60 mm** of water) to avoid crust formation on the soil surface, which can hinder shoot emergence. Ensure uniform water distribution across the field.

### **2. Second Irrigation and Subsequent Irrigations**

Following the first irrigation, subsequent irrigations are vital for supporting the crop through its various growth stages, especially the tillering and grand growth phases.

*   **Second Irrigation:**
    *   Typically given **2-3 weeks after the first irrigation**, coinciding with the early tillering phase. This supports the development of primary tillers.
*   **Subsequent Irrigations (Frequency and Amount):**
    *   **Critical Stages:** Sugarcane has high water demand during the tillering phase (60-120 days after planting) and the grand growth phase (120-270 days after planting), where cane elongation occurs rapidly.
    *   **Summer Months (April-June):** During hot and dry periods, irrigations may be required every **7-10 days**.
    *   **Monsoon and Cooler Months (July-October):** Irrigation frequency can be extended to **15-20 days** or more, depending on rainfall and soil moisture status.
    *   **Maturity Phase (270 days onwards):** Irrigation should be gradually reduced and stopped about **4-6 weeks before harvest** to promote sugar accumulation and improve juice quality.
    *   **Amount:** Each irrigation should apply approximately **60-75 mm** of water, ensuring the root zone is adequately wetted without causing waterlogging.
    *   **Soil Type:** Lighter soils (sandy loams) require more frequent but lighter irrigations, while heavier soils (clay loams) can sustain longer intervals between irrigations due to higher water retention capacity.

### **3. Sprinkler Use**

Sprinkler irrigation offers several advantages for sugarcane cultivation, particularly in water-scarce regions of Haryana.

*   **Advantages:**
    *   **Water Saving:** Can save **20-30%** of water compared to traditional flood irrigation, leading to higher water use efficiency.
    *   **Uniform Application:** Provides more uniform water distribution, especially on undulating or uneven terrain, preventing waterlogging in some areas and drought stress in others.
    *   **Reduced Soil Erosion:** Gentle application minimizes soil erosion and nutrient leaching.
    *   **Fertigation:** Allows for the application of water-soluble fertilizers along with irrigation water, improving nutrient uptake efficiency.
*   **Suitability for Sugarcane:**
    *   **Early Growth Stages:** Highly effective and recommended for germination, establishment, and early tillering phases (up to 120 days after planting) when the crop canopy is not too dense.
    *   **Ratoon Crop:** Beneficial for the initial growth of ratoon crops, ensuring quick sprouting and establishment.
    *   **Water Scarcity:** Particularly valuable in areas with limited water availability or where canal water supply is erratic.
*   **Considerations:**
    *   **Initial Cost:** The initial investment for a sprinkler system can be higher than traditional methods.
    *   **Wind Drift:** Water distribution can be affected by strong winds, leading to uneven application.
    *   **Crop Height:** As the sugarcane crop grows tall and forms a dense canopy, the effectiveness of overhead sprinklers can decrease due to interception and difficulty in moving equipment. For mature cane, drip irrigation is often a more suitable micro-irrigation alternative if adopted.

By adopting these scientifically sound irrigation practices, sugarcane growers in Haryana can optimize water use, enhance crop productivity, and ensure sustainable cultivation.
