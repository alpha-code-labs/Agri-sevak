As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I must provide scientifically verified advice specific to sugarcane cultivation in Haryana.

Regarding your query:

*   **Dieback:** This is not known to affect Sugarcane. Dieback typically refers to the progressive death of twigs and branches, starting from the tips, which is characteristic of woody plants. Sugarcane is a grass and does not exhibit dieback in this manner.
*   **Twig blight:** This is not known to affect Sugarcane. Sugarcane does not have "twigs," and therefore, "twig blight" is not a relevant condition for this crop.
*   **Tikka disease:** This is not known to affect Sugarcane. Tikka disease (also known as leaf spot) is a prominent disease of groundnut (peanut) and is not associated with sugarcane. Sugarcane has its own set of leaf spot diseases, but "Tikka disease" is not one of them.
