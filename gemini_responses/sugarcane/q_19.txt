As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I strongly recommend a proactive and scientifically-backed approach to nutrient management in sugarcane. The first and most crucial step is **soil testing** to accurately determine the existing nutrient levels and pH of your field. This will provide precise recommendations for fertilizer application.

However, if visual symptoms indicate a deficiency, the following general guidelines can be followed for addressing Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K) deficiencies in sugarcane in Haryana:

### General Principles:
*   **Soil Testing:** Always conduct a soil test before applying fertilizers to ensure balanced nutrition and avoid over-application, which can be detrimental and uneconomical.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management:** Combine chemical fertilizers with organic manures (Farm Yard Manure, compost, press mud) for long-term soil health and nutrient availability.

### Addressing Nitrogen (N) Deficiency:
Nitrogen deficiency typically manifests as general yellowing of older leaves, stunted growth, and thin stalks.

*   **Soil Application (Top-dressing):**
    *   Apply **Urea** (46% N) at a rate of 50-75 kg per acre as a top-dressing. This can be split into 2-3 applications, especially during the grand growth phase (60-120 days after planting/ratooning).
    *   Alternatively, **Calcium Ammonium Nitrate (CAN)** (25% N) can be applied at 90-135 kg per acre.
    *   **Ammonium Sulphate** (20.6% N) can be used at 120-180 kg per acre, especially in sulfur-deficient soils.
*   **Foliar Application (for quick correction):**
    *   Spray a 2% solution of **Urea** (20 g of Urea per litre of water). Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, ensuring good leaf coverage.

### Addressing Phosphorus (P) Deficiency:
Phosphorus deficiency leads to stunted growth, thin stalks, dark green or purplish discoloration of older leaves, and poor root development.

*   **Soil Application (Basal or Placement):**
    *   Phosphorus is best applied at planting or ratooning as it is less mobile in the soil.
    *   Apply **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5) at 250-300 kg per acre.
    *   Alternatively, **Di-Ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5) can be applied at 100-130 kg per acre. If using DAP, adjust Nitrogen application accordingly.
    *   For standing crop showing deficiency, placement of SSP or DAP near the root zone can be attempted, followed by light irrigation.
*   **Foliar Application (for quick correction/supplementation):**
    *   Spray a 1-2% solution of **Di-Ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (10-20 g of DAP per litre of water).
    *   Alternatively, a 1-2% solution of **Monoammonium Phosphate (MAP)** (10-20 g of MAP per litre of water) can be used. Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals.

### Addressing Potassium (K) Deficiency:
Potassium deficiency symptoms include yellowing and scorching of leaf margins, especially on older leaves, lodging of stalks, and reduced sugar content.

*   **Soil Application (Basal or Split):**
    *   Apply **Muriate of Potash (Potassium Chloride)** (60% K2O) at 80-100 kg per acre. This can be applied basally or split into two doses: one at planting/ratooning and the second during the grand growth phase.
    *   Alternatively, **Sulphate of Potash (Potassium Sulphate)** (50% K2O) can be applied at 95-120 kg per acre, especially beneficial in sulfur-deficient soils.
*   **Foliar Application (for quick correction/supplementation):**
    *   Spray a 1-2% solution of **Muriate of Potash (Potassium Chloride)** (10-20 g of MOP per litre of water).
    *   Alternatively, a 1-2% solution of **Potassium Nitrate** (10-20 g of Potassium Nitrate per litre of water) can be used. Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals.

### Important Considerations:
*   **Timing:** Apply fertilizers at appropriate growth stages for maximum efficiency. Nitrogen is crucial during tillering and grand growth, while P and K are important from planting/ratooning.
*   **Method of Application:** Ensure proper placement of granular fertilizers (e.g., near the root zone) and thorough coverage for foliar sprays.
*   **Irrigation:** Adequate moisture is essential for nutrient uptake. Irrigate after soil application of fertilizers.
*   **Organic Matter:** Incorporating organic matter improves soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability.
