As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified seed (sett) and soil treatment processes for sugarcane cultivation in Haryana:

### Recommended Seed Treatment (Sett Treatment) for Sugarcane

The primary objective of sett treatment is to protect against sett-borne diseases and early shoot borers, and to promote healthy germination.

*   **Preparation of Setts:** Use healthy, disease-free setts from a reliable source. Cut setts with 2-3 buds each.
*   **Dipping Solution:** Prepare a solution by mixing the following in 100 litres of water. The setts should be dipped in this solution for 10-15 minutes just before planting.

    *   **For Fungal Disease Protection (e.g., Red Rot, Smut, Wilt):**
        *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: 100 grams
        *   *OR*
        *   **Thiophanate methyl** 70% WP: 100 grams

    *   **For Insect Pest Protection (e.g., Early Shoot Borer, Sucking Pests):**
        *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: 200 ml
        *   *OR*
        *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC: 100 ml

    *   **For Growth Promotion and Nutrient Mobilization (Bio-fertilizers/Bio-fungicides - highly recommended for Integrated Nutrient Management):**
        *   **Acetobacter diazotrophicus** (liquid formulation): 1 litre
        *   **PSB (Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria)** (liquid formulation): 1 litre
        *   **Trichoderma viride** (liquid formulation): 1 litre
        *(These bio-agents can be combined with the chemical treatment solution, or setts can be dipped in a separate bio-agent solution after chemical treatment for optimal results.)*

### Recommended Soil Treatment for Sugarcane

Soil treatment aims to manage soil-borne pests like termites and white grubs, and to suppress soil-borne diseases, thereby improving overall soil health.

*   **Application Method:** Apply the chosen treatment in the furrows at the time of planting or broadcast and incorporate into the soil before planting.

    *   **For Termite and White Grub Management:**
        *   **Fipronil** 0.3% GR: 25 kg per acre, applied uniformly in the furrows at planting.
        *   *OR*
        *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: 2 litres per acre, mixed with 200-300 litres of water and drenched in the furrows.

    *   **For Soil-borne Fungal Disease Suppression (e.g., Damping-off, Root Rot) and Soil Health Improvement:**
        *   **Trichoderma viride** (carrier-based formulation): 2.5 kg per acre, mixed thoroughly with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed Farmyard Manure (FYM) or compost. This mixture should be broadcasted evenly over the field and incorporated into the soil before planting, or applied in the furrows at planting.

    *   **For Nematode Management (if a problem is identified):**
        *   **Paecilomyces lilacinus** (carrier-based formulation): 2.5 kg per acre, mixed with 50-100 kg of FYM and applied in furrows or broadcasted before planting.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always ensure proper soil moisture for effective action of both chemical and biological treatments.
*   Follow all safety precautions and wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) while handling chemicals.
*   Integrated Pest Management (IPM) and Integrated Nutrient Management (INM) approaches are highly encouraged for sustainable sugarcane cultivation.
