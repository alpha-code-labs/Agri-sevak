As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following doses for organic manures and bio-stimulants in Sugarcane cultivation in Haryana:

*   **Farmyard Manure (FYM):**
    *   Apply 10-12 tonnes per acre during land preparation, about 2-3 weeks before planting. Ensure it is well-decomposed.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   Apply 4-5 tonnes per acre during land preparation or at the time of planting.

*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract Bio-stimulant):**
    *   Please note that Sagarika is a seaweed extract-based bio-stimulant, not a bulk organic manure like FYM or vermicompost. It enhances nutrient uptake and plant growth.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Mix 2-4 ml per litre of water and spray at critical growth stages (e.g., tillering and grand growth stages).
    *   **Soil Drench/Fertigation:** Apply 2-3 litres per acre, mixed with irrigation water or as a drench, preferably during early growth stages.
