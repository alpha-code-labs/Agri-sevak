As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified management strategies for growth issues in Sugarcane in Haryana:

**General Principles for Healthy Sugarcane Growth:**
Before addressing specific issues, it's crucial to ensure fundamental good agricultural practices are in place:
*   **Soil Testing:** Regularly conduct soil tests to understand nutrient status and pH. This is the foundation for any nutrient management plan.
*   **Variety Selection:** Choose high-yielding, disease-resistant varieties suitable for Haryana's agro-climatic conditions and your specific field.
*   **Proper Land Preparation:** Ensure good tilth, drainage, and aeration.
*   **Timely Planting:** Adhere to recommended planting windows for your region.
*   **Weed Management:** Control weeds effectively as they compete for nutrients and water.

**1. Slow Growth:**
Slow growth in sugarcane can be indicative of various underlying issues, primarily nutrient deficiencies, water stress, or soil health problems.

*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Based on soil test reports, apply balanced fertilizers.
    *   For general growth promotion, ensure adequate supply of macro and micronutrients.
    *   If nitrogen deficiency is suspected (pale green to yellow leaves, stunted growth), apply:
        *   **Urea** at 40-50 kg/acre as a top dressing, split into 2-3 applications during the active growth phase.
    *   If phosphorus deficiency is suspected (purplish discoloration, thin stalks), apply:
        *   **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** at 50-60 kg/acre at planting or early growth.
    *   If potassium deficiency is suspected (yellowing/browning of leaf margins, lodging), apply:
        *   **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** at 40-50 kg/acre, split into applications.
*   **Water Management:**
    *   Ensure optimal irrigation, avoiding both water stress and waterlogging. Sugarcane requires consistent moisture, especially during the grand growth phase.
    *   Improve drainage in fields prone to waterlogging.
*   **Soil Health:**
    *   Incorporate organic matter (farmyard manure, compost, green manure) to improve soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability.
    *   Avoid soil compaction by minimizing heavy machinery movement, especially when the soil is wet.

**2. Yellow Growth (Chlorosis):**
Yellowing of sugarcane leaves (chlorosis) is often a symptom of nutrient deficiencies, particularly nitrogen and certain micronutrients, or waterlogging.

*   **Nitrogen Deficiency:**
    *   General yellowing of older leaves, progressing to younger leaves.
    *   Apply:
        *   **Urea** at 40-50 kg/acre as a top dressing.
*   **Iron Deficiency:**
    *   Interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) of younger leaves, while veins remain green. Common in high pH soils.
    *   Foliar spray with:
        *   **Ferrous Sulphate** at 0.5% solution (5 g/L water) with 0.1% citric acid (1 g/L water) or a suitable wetting agent. Repeat if necessary.
*   **Zinc Deficiency:**
    *   Whitish-yellow streaks on younger leaves, reduced leaf size.
    *   Foliar spray with:
        *   **Zinc Sulphate** at 0.5% solution (5 g/L water).
    *   Soil application of:
        *   **Zinc Sulphate** at 10-15 kg/acre at planting.
*   **Manganese Deficiency:**
    *   Interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, often with a striped appearance.
    *   Foliar spray with:
        *   **Manganese Sulphate** at 0.5% solution (5 g/L water).
*   **Waterlogging:**
    *   Yellowing can also be caused by poor root aeration due to waterlogging. Improve field drainage.

**3. Excessive Height:**
Excessive height, often leading to lodging, is primarily due to over-fertilization with nitrogen and/or high plant density.

*   **Nitrogen Management:**
    *   Strictly follow recommended nitrogen application rates based on soil test and crop stage. Avoid excessive nitrogen, especially during the later growth stages.
    *   Split nitrogen applications to match crop demand and reduce luxury consumption.
*   **Plant Density:**
    *   Maintain optimal plant spacing as per HAU recommendations for your chosen variety. Overcrowding leads to etiolation (stretching for light) and weaker stalks.
*   **Variety Selection:**
    *   If lodging is a persistent issue, consider varieties known for better lodging resistance, if available and suitable for your region.
*   **No specific CIBRC approved chemical is widely recommended for height reduction in sugarcane in India as a standard practice.** Focus on cultural and nutritional management.

**4. Excessive Flowering (Arrowing):**
Excessive flowering (arrowing) diverts energy from sugar accumulation, reducing cane yield and juice quality.

*   **Variety Selection:**
    *   Prioritize planting non-arrowing or late-arrowing sugarcane varieties recommended by HAU for Haryana. This is the most effective preventive measure.
*   **Planting Time:**
    *   Adjust planting dates to avoid exposing the crop to environmental conditions (e.g., specific photoperiods or stress periods) that induce flowering. Consult HAU recommendations for optimal planting windows.
*   **Water Management:**
    *   Maintain consistent soil moisture, especially during the period when flower initiation typically occurs (often around September-October in North India). Avoid severe drought stress followed by irrigation, which can trigger flowering.
*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Ensure balanced nutrition. While high nitrogen can sometimes contribute to flowering under stress, avoiding extremes is key.
    *   Some studies suggest that foliar application of **Urea** (2-3% solution) or **Potassium Nitrate** (1-2% solution) *after* arrowing has commenced can sometimes help to promote vegetative growth and reduce the negative impact on sugar accumulation, but prevention is better. This is a remedial measure, not a preventive one for flowering itself.
*   **No specific CIBRC approved chemical is widely recommended for suppressing flowering in sugarcane in India as a standard practice.** Focus on cultural and varietal management.

By implementing these scientifically verified practices, sugarcane growers in Haryana can effectively manage common growth issues and optimize their crop's productivity and sugar recovery. Always consult your local agricultural extension office or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions.
