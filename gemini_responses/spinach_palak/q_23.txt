As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified seed and soil treatment processes for Spinach (Palak) to ensure healthy crop establishment and mitigate common pest and disease issues in Haryana:

### Seed Treatment Process for Spinach (Palak)

Seed treatment is crucial for protecting young seedlings from seed-borne and early soil-borne diseases, particularly damping-off and seedling blight.

*   **Fungal Disease Prevention (Damping-off, Seedling Blight):**
    *   **Chemical Treatment:** Treat spinach seeds with a fungicide before sowing.
        *   **Thiram** 75% WS at 2.5 g per kg of seed.
        *   *Method:* Mix the required quantity of fungicide thoroughly with the seeds in a suitable container or seed treating drum until all seeds are uniformly coated.
    *   **Biological Treatment (Alternative or Complementary):**
        *   **Trichoderma viride** 1% WP at 5-10 g per kg of seed.
        *   *Method:* Mix the bio-fungicide with the seeds just before sowing. This helps in suppressing soil-borne pathogens and promoting early root development.

### Soil Treatment Process for Spinach (Palak)

Soil treatment aims to manage soil-borne diseases, nematodes, and early soil insect pests, providing a healthy environment for root development.

*   **Soil-borne Disease Management (Damping-off, Root Rot):**
    *   **Biological Treatment (Recommended for general prevention and soil health):**
        *   **Trichoderma viride** 1% WP at 2.5 kg per acre.
        *   *Method:* Mix the recommended quantity of **Trichoderma viride** with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost. Allow this mixture to sit for 7-10 days in a shaded area, keeping it moist. Broadcast this enriched FYM mixture evenly across the field and incorporate it into the soil 7-10 days before sowing or transplanting. This helps in building a beneficial microbial population that suppresses pathogenic fungi.

*   **Nematode and Soil Pest Management (If required or known problem):**
    *   **For Soil Insect Pests (e.g., Cutworms) and some Nematodes:**
        *   **Fipronil** 0.3% G at 10-15 kg per acre.
        *   *Method:* Apply the granular insecticide evenly in the soil at the time of final land preparation or sowing and incorporate it into the topsoil. This provides protection against early soil insect pests and offers some control over nematodes.
    *   **For Specific Nematode Problems (If severe and confirmed):**
        *   **Purpureocillium lilacinum** 1% WP (a bio-nematicide) at 2.5 kg per acre.
        *   *Method:* Similar to **Trichoderma viride**, mix with 50-100 kg of FYM/compost, allow to multiply for 7-10 days, and then broadcast and incorporate into the soil before sowing.

**Note:** Always ensure proper soil moisture for effective action of both chemical and biological treatments. Follow all safety precautions and label instructions when handling any agricultural chemicals.
