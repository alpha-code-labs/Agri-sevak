As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling viral diseases in Spinach (Palak) in Haryana:

First, let's address the specific viruses mentioned:

*   **Stripe virus:** This is not known to affect Spinach (Palak).
*   **Tristeza virus:** This is not known to affect Spinach (Palak).

For Leaf curl, Mosaic, Yellow vein clearing, and Stunt virus, which are common viral disease symptoms or types affecting Spinach, it is crucial to understand that there are no direct chemical cures for viral diseases once a plant is infected. Control strategies focus primarily on prevention and managing the vectors (insects that transmit the viruses).

Here are the recommended control measures:

**I. Cultural Practices and Prevention:**

*   **Use Resistant Varieties:** Whenever possible, select and plant spinach varieties known to be resistant or tolerant to common viral diseases in your region. Consult HAU or local agricultural extension for recommended varieties.
*   **Healthy Seeds:** Always use certified, virus-free seeds from reputable sources.
*   **Roguing:** Regularly inspect your field and promptly remove and destroy (bury deep or burn) any infected plants showing symptoms like leaf curling, mosaic patterns, yellowing, or stunting. This prevents the spread of the virus to healthy plants.
*   **Weed Management:** Keep the field and surrounding areas free of weeds, as many weeds can act as alternate hosts for viruses and their insect vectors.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops to break the disease cycle.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove all crop residues after harvest.
*   **Physical Barriers:** For small-scale cultivation, using insect-proof nets or row covers can help exclude insect vectors.

**II. Vector Management (Insect Control):**

Most viral diseases in spinach are transmitted by sucking insects like aphids and whiteflies. Controlling these vectors is critical to prevent virus spread. Apply insecticides when vector populations are observed and reach economic threshold levels. Always follow label instructions for dosage and safety.

*   **For Aphids:**
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: 0.5-1 ml/L of water (for foliar spray) or 100-125 ml/acre (for drenching/soil application).
    *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: 0.2-0.4 g/L of water.
    *   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP: 0.2-0.4 g/L of water.
    *   **Flonicamid** 50% WG: 0.3 g/L of water.
    *   **Azadirachtin** 1500 ppm: 2.5-5 ml/L of water (for organic approach).

*   **For Whiteflies:**
    *   **Spiromesifen** 22.9% SC: 0.6-0.8 ml/L of water.
    *   **Buprofezin** 25% SC: 1.25 ml/L of water.
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: 0.5-1 ml/L of water.
    *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: 0.2-0.4 g/L of water.
    *   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP: 0.2-0.4 g/L of water.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Integrated Pest Management (IPM):** Combine cultural, biological, and chemical methods for sustainable and effective control.
*   **Timing of Application:** Apply insecticides early in the morning or late in the evening to minimize harm to beneficial insects and ensure better efficacy.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always observe the specified pre-harvest interval for any chemical applied to spinach to ensure the produce is safe for consumption.
*   **Consult Local Experts:** For specific recommendations tailored to your exact field conditions and current pest pressure, always consult with the agricultural extension specialists at HAU or your local Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK).
