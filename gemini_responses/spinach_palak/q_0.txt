As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Spinach (Palak) in Haryana.

It is crucial to adopt an Integrated Disease Management (IDM) approach, combining cultural practices with judicious use of CIBRC-approved fungicides when necessary.

**General Cultural Practices for Fungal Disease Prevention:**

*   **Resistant Varieties:** Whenever possible, choose spinach varieties known to be resistant or tolerant to common fungal diseases prevalent in your area.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice a 2-3 year crop rotation with non-host crops to reduce pathogen build-up in the soil.
*   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris immediately after harvest to reduce inoculum sources.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to improve air circulation and reduce humidity within the canopy, which discourages fungal growth.
*   **Water Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day. Drip irrigation or furrow irrigation is preferred. If overhead irrigation is used, do it in the morning to allow foliage to dry quickly.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced fertilization. Excessive nitrogen can lead to lush, susceptible growth.
*   **Weed Control:** Keep the field free of weeds, as they can act as alternate hosts for some pathogens and impede air circulation.

**Specific Control Measures for Fungal Diseases in Spinach (Palak):**

### 1. Alternaria Leaf Spot (Caused by *Alternaria spp.*)

**Symptoms:** Small, circular to irregular spots, often with concentric rings (target-like appearance), turning brown to black, primarily on older leaves.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural:** Implement general cultural practices as mentioned above.
*   **Chemical:**
    *   Spray with **Mancozeb** at 2.5 kg/acre (dissolved in 500-600 L of water).
    *   Alternatively, spray with **Chlorothalonil** at 2 kg/acre (dissolved in 500-600 L of water).
    *   For systemic action, **Azoxystrobin** at 200 ml/acre (dissolved in 500-600 L of water) can be used.

### 2. Anthracnose (Caused by *Colletotrichum dematium*)

**Symptoms:** Small, water-soaked spots that enlarge and turn tan to brown, often with dark borders. In severe cases, lesions may coalesce, leading to blighting of leaves.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural:** Use disease-free seeds. Practice good field sanitation.
*   **Chemical:**
    *   Spray with **Mancozeb** at 2.5 kg/acre (dissolved in 500-600 L of water).
    *   Alternatively, spray with **Chlorothalonil** at 2 kg/acre (dissolved in 500-600 L of water).
    *   **Azoxystrobin** at 200 ml/acre (dissolved in 500-600 L of water) can also be effective.

### 3. Blast

This is not known to affect Spinach (Palak).

### 4. Blight (e.g., Cercospora Leaf Spot)

**Symptoms:** Blight is a general term, but in spinach, *Cercospora beticola* causes Cercospora leaf spot, which can lead to blighting. Symptoms include small, circular spots with tan to grey centers and reddish-purple borders, which can coalesce and cause large areas of the leaf to die.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural:** Use resistant varieties if available. Practice crop rotation and good sanitation.
*   **Chemical:**
    *   Spray with **Mancozeb** at 2.5 kg/acre (dissolved in 500-600 L of water).
    *   Alternatively, **Chlorothalonil** at 2 kg/acre (dissolved in 500-600 L of water).
    *   Systemic fungicides like **Difenoconazole** at 100 ml/acre (dissolved in 500-600 L of water) or **Propiconazole** at 200 ml/acre (dissolved in 500-600 L of water) can also be used.

### 5. Brown Spot

Brown spot symptoms in spinach are often caused by pathogens like *Alternaria spp.* or *Cercospora spp.* Please refer to the control measures for **Alternaria Leaf Spot** and **Blight (Cercospora Leaf Spot)** for effective management.

### 6. Downy Mildew (Caused by *Peronospora farinosa f. sp. spinaciae*)

**Symptoms:** Yellowish spots on the upper surface of leaves, often angular and delimited by veins. On the corresponding lower surface, a greyish-purple, fuzzy fungal growth is visible, especially in humid conditions.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural:** Use resistant varieties. Ensure good air circulation. Avoid overhead irrigation late in the day.
*   **Chemical:**
    *   Spray with **Mancozeb** at 2.5 kg/acre (dissolved in 500-600 L of water) as a protectant.
    *   For systemic control, **Dimethomorph** at 250 g/acre (dissolved in 500-600 L of water) or **Fluopicolide** at 100 ml/acre (dissolved in 500-600 L of water) can be used.
    *   Combination products like **Cymoxanil + Mancozeb** (e.g., 600 g/acre of a 8% + 64% WP formulation) are highly effective.
    *   **Propineb** at 2.5 kg/acre (dissolved in 500-600 L of water) is another good protectant.
    *   **Azoxystrobin** at 200 ml/acre (dissolved in 500-600 L of water) or **Pyraclostrobin** at 200 ml/acre (dissolved in 500-600 L of water) also provide good control.

### 7. Powdery Mildew (Caused by *Erysiphe cichoracearum* or *Podosphaera xanthii*)

**Symptoms:** White, powdery patches primarily on the upper surface of leaves, which can spread to cover the entire leaf, leading to yellowing and premature defoliation.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural:** Maintain good air circulation.
*   **Chemical:**
    *   Spray with **Wettable Sulphur** at 2 kg/acre (dissolved in 500-600 L of water). Ensure good coverage.
    *   Alternatively, **Myclobutanil** at 100 ml/acre (dissolved in 500-600 L of water) or **Penconazole** at 100 ml/acre (dissolved in 500-600 L of water) can be used.
    *   **Azoxystrobin** at 200 ml/acre (dissolved in 500-600 L of water) or **Pyraclostrobin** at 200 ml/acre (dissolved in 500-600 L of water) are also effective.

### 8. Grey Mildew

This is not known to affect Spinach (Palak).

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the label instructions for any chemical product regarding dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in pathogens.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and current disease pressure.
