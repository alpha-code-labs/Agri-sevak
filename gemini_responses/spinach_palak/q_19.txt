Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU), Hisar, I advise you to first conduct a comprehensive soil test of your field. This is the most accurate way to determine the exact nutrient status and tailor recommendations specifically for your soil and crop. However, based on general observations and common deficiencies in Haryana, here's how to address macro-nutrient deficiencies in Spinach (Palak):

### General Recommendation:
Always conduct a soil test to determine the precise nutrient requirements. The following recommendations are general guidelines for deficiency correction.

### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   General yellowing of older leaves, starting from the tips and moving inwards.
*   Stunted growth and reduced leaf size.
*   Pale green to yellowish appearance of the entire plant.

**Correction:**
*   **Basal Application (if not applied sufficiently):**
    *   Apply **Urea** at 50-60 kg/acre.
*   **Top-dressing (for existing deficiency):**
    *   Apply **Urea** at 25-30 kg/acre, 20-25 days after sowing or transplanting, and again after each cutting if multiple harvests are planned. Ensure proper irrigation after application.

### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   Dark green or purplish discoloration of older leaves, especially on the undersides.
*   Stunted growth, poor root development, and delayed maturity.
*   Leaves may appear stiff and upright.

**Correction:**
*   **Basal Application (most effective as P is less mobile in soil):**
    *   Apply **Di-ammonium Phosphate** at 50-60 kg/acre.
    *   Alternatively, apply **Single Super Phosphate** at 150-180 kg/acre.
    *   Ensure the fertilizer is thoroughly mixed into the soil before sowing or transplanting.

### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   Yellowing and browning (scorching) of leaf margins, particularly on older leaves.
*   Weak stems and reduced resistance to diseases and environmental stress.
*   Overall stunted growth and poor quality of leaves.

**Correction:**
*   **Basal Application (if not applied sufficiently):**
    *   Apply **Potassium Chloride** (Muriate of Potash) at 35-45 kg/acre.
*   **Top-dressing (for existing deficiency):**
    *   Apply **Potassium Chloride** (Muriate of Potash) at 20-25 kg/acre, 20-25 days after sowing or transplanting, especially if soil test indicates low levels.
    *   Alternatively, **Potassium Sulphate** can be used at similar rates if chloride sensitivity is a concern, though less common for spinach.

**Important Note:**
Always ensure proper irrigation after fertilizer application to facilitate nutrient uptake and prevent burning of plants. For precise recommendations, please consult your local agricultural extension officer or the experts at HAU, Hisar, with your soil test report.
