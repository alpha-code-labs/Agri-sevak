As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in Spinach (Palak) in Haryana:

### **1. Grasshopper Control in Spinach (Palak)**

Grasshoppers are polyphagous pests that can cause significant damage to spinach leaves by chewing them.

*   **Cultural Methods:**
    *   Regular field monitoring is crucial. For small infestations, hand-picking and destroying grasshoppers can be effective.
    *   Maintain good field sanitation by removing weeds from and around the spinach field, as weeds can serve as alternate hosts and breeding sites for grasshoppers.
    *   Deep ploughing after harvest can expose grasshopper eggs to predators and adverse weather conditions.

*   **Chemical Control (Use only if infestation is severe and cultural methods are insufficient):**
    *   **Malathion** 50% EC: Apply at 1.0 - 1.5 L per acre mixed in 200-300 L of water. Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: Apply at 100-125 ml per acre mixed in 200-300 L of water.
    *   **Azadirachtin** 1500 ppm (Neem oil-based formulation): Apply at 2.0 - 2.5 L per acre mixed in 200-300 L of water. This is a suitable option for early stages of infestation or for organic farming practices, offering repellent and anti-feedant properties.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always observe the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) specified on the product label, especially for spinach which is a leafy vegetable consumed fresh.
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.
*   Always read and strictly follow the instructions and safety precautions provided on the pesticide label.

### **2. Painted Bug Control in Spinach (Palak)**

Painted bug (Bagrada hilaris) primarily affects cruciferous crops (e.g., mustard, cabbage, radish). While it can occasionally be found on other plants, it is not a primary or significant pest of spinach. However, if observed, control measures for sucking pests can be applied.

*   **Cultural Methods:**
    *   Remove cruciferous weeds from the vicinity of spinach fields, as these can act as hosts for painted bugs.
    *   Regular monitoring can help detect early infestations.

*   **Chemical Control (If infestation occurs):**
    *   **Malathion** 50% EC: Apply at 1.0 - 1.5 L per acre mixed in 200-300 L of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: Apply at 100-125 ml per acre mixed in 200-300 L of water.
    *   **Azadirachtin** 1500 ppm: Apply at 2.0 - 2.5 L per acre mixed in 200-300 L of water for early stage control.

### **3. Red Cotton Bug in Spinach (Palak)**

This is not known to affect Spinach (Palak). Red cotton bug (Dysdercus cingulatus) is primarily a pest of cotton and other malvaceous plants, feeding on developing seeds.

### **4. Black Ants in Spinach (Palak)**

This is not known to affect Spinach (Palak) as a direct pest causing damage to the leaves. Black ants are generally not considered a primary pest of spinach. They might be present in the field, often associated with other issues like aphid infestations (feeding on honeydew) or nesting in the soil. If ants are abundant, it is advisable to check for the presence of aphids or other sap-sucking insects. Controlling the primary pest (e.g., aphids) will usually lead to a reduction in ant activity.
