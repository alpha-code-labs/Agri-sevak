Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide you with the scientifically verified advice regarding the ideal transplantation time, distance, and process for Spinach (Palak) in Haryana. While spinach is predominantly direct-sown, transplanting can be a viable option for specific cultivation strategies, such as achieving an early start or managing nursery conditions.

Here is the detailed information:

### Ideal Transplantation Time for Spinach (Palak)

Spinach is a cool-season crop. For successful establishment and growth after transplanting in Haryana, the ideal period aligns with the Rabi season:

*   **Main Season:** From **September end to February**.
*   **Specific Windows:**
    *   **Early Crop:** Transplanting can begin from **late September to October** to get an early harvest.
    *   **Mid-Season:** Continue transplanting through **November and December**.
    *   **Late Season:** Transplanting can extend up to **January and early February** for a spring harvest before temperatures rise significantly.

### Ideal Transplantation Distance for Spinach (Palak)

Proper spacing is crucial for good plant growth, air circulation, and ease of harvesting multiple cuttings.

*   **Row-to-Row Distance:** **20-30 cm**
*   **Plant-to-Plant Distance:** **10-15 cm**

This spacing allows for optimal development of individual plants and facilitates cultural operations.

### Ideal Transplantation Process for Spinach (Palak)

The transplantation process involves several key steps to ensure high survival rates and vigorous growth:

1.  **Nursery Raising:**
    *   Prepare a well-drained nursery bed or use seedling trays filled with a good quality potting mix.
    *   Sow spinach seeds thinly at a depth of about 1-2 cm.
    *   Keep the nursery bed consistently moist but not waterlogged.
    *   Seedlings are typically ready for transplanting in **3-4 weeks** when they have developed **3-4 true leaves** and are about 8-10 cm tall.

2.  **Main Field Preparation:**
    *   Prepare the main field to a fine tilth by ploughing and harrowing.
    *   Incorporate **10-15 tonnes per acre** of well-rotted Farmyard Manure (FYM) or compost during land preparation to enrich the soil.
    *   Ensure the field is leveled and free of weeds.
    *   Prepare beds or furrows as per your irrigation method (e.g., flatbeds for flood irrigation or raised beds for drip irrigation).

3.  **Transplanting Operation:**
    *   **Water the nursery bed thoroughly** a few hours before uprooting the seedlings. This makes it easier to lift seedlings with minimal root damage and a small ball of earth.
    *   Carefully lift the seedlings, holding them by their leaves rather than the delicate stem.
    *   Dig small holes in the prepared main field at the recommended spacing (20-30 cm row-to-row and 10-15 cm plant-to-plant).
    *   Place one seedling per hole, ensuring it is planted at the same depth as it was in the nursery.
    *   Gently firm the soil around the base of each seedling to ensure good root-to-soil contact and remove air pockets.
    *   **Immediately irrigate the field** after transplanting. This helps the seedlings settle in and reduces transplanting shock.

4.  **Post-Transplantation Care:**
    *   Maintain adequate soil moisture, especially during the first few days after transplanting, to aid establishment.
    *   Monitor for any signs of wilting or stress.
    *   Protect young seedlings from strong winds or intense sun immediately after transplanting if conditions are harsh.
    *   Regularly check for pests and diseases and take appropriate action as per HAU recommendations.

By following these guidelines, you can successfully transplant spinach and achieve a healthy, productive crop.
