As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), here is the scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in Spinach (Palak) in Haryana:

**1. Borers:**
This is not known to affect Spinach (Palak).

**2. Caterpillars (including general leaf-eating caterpillars):**
Caterpillars can cause significant damage to spinach leaves by feeding on them. An Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is highly recommended for effective and sustainable control.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Regularly monitor your spinach fields to detect early signs of infestation (egg masses, young larvae, feeding damage).
    *   In small plots, hand-pick visible larvae and egg masses and destroy them.
    *   Remove and destroy severely infested plant parts to prevent further spread.

*   **Biological Control:**
    *   Apply bio-pesticides containing **Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki (Bt)** at a concentration of 1-2 g/L of water. This is particularly effective against young larvae and is safe for consumption after a short period. Apply in the evening for best results.

*   **Chemical Control (Use only if infestation is severe and after consulting local agricultural extension for specific recommendations and pre-harvest intervals):**
    *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG at 0.2-0.4 g/L of water.
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC at 0.15-0.2 ml/L of water.
    *   **Flubendiamide** 20% WG at 0.2-0.3 g/L of water.
    *   **Indoxacarb** 14.5% SC at 0.5 ml/L of water.

    *Always ensure to strictly follow the recommended pre-harvest interval (PHI) mentioned on the product label, especially for leafy vegetables like spinach, to ensure food safety.*

**3. Diamondback moth:**
This is not known to affect Spinach (Palak).

**4. Leaf folder:**
Leaf folders are a type of caterpillar that fold or roll leaves to feed and pupate inside. The control measures for leaf folders are generally similar to those for other leaf-eating caterpillars. Please refer to the comprehensive control strategies listed under "Caterpillars" above.
