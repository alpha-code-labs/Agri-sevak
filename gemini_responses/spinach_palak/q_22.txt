As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), here are the recommended cultivation practices for Spinach (Palak) in Haryana:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   Spinach can be sown by **broadcasting** for quick, dense stands, especially if multiple cuttings are planned.
    *   However, **line sowing** is highly recommended. It facilitates better aeration, light penetration, weeding, and harvesting operations.
*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   Seeds should be sown shallowly at a depth of **1.5 - 2.5 cm**.
*   **Spacing:**
    *   For line sowing, maintain a row-to-row spacing of **20 - 30 cm**.
    *   Within the row, aim for a plant-to-plant spacing of **5 - 10 cm** after thinning, if necessary, to allow for optimal growth.
*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   The recommended seed dose is **10 - 15 kg per acre**. A slightly higher dose (up to 15 kg/acre) can be used if multiple cuttings are desired or if germination rates are expected to be lower.
