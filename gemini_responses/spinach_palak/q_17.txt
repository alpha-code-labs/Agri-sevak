As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following doses of organic inputs for Spinach (Palak) cultivation in Haryana, ensuring optimal growth and soil health:

*   **Farm Yard Manure (FYM):**
    *   Apply **10-15 tonnes per acre** during land preparation. Ensure it is well-decomposed and thoroughly incorporated into the soil at least 2-3 weeks before sowing.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   Apply **4-5 tonnes per acre** during land preparation, incorporated into the soil.
    *   Alternatively, if using in conjunction with FYM, apply **2-3 tonnes per acre** along with a reduced dose of FYM (e.g., 5-7 tonnes per acre).

*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract):**
    *   Sagarika is a plant growth stimulant derived from seaweed, not a bulk manure like FYM or vermicompost. It enhances nutrient uptake and plant vigour.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Mix **2.5-5 ml per litre of water** and spray uniformly on the foliage. Apply 2-3 sprays during the crop cycle, typically at 15-20 days after sowing and subsequent sprays at 15-day intervals.
    *   **Soil Drench/Drip Application:** Apply **1-2 litres per acre** mixed with irrigation water, preferably during early growth stages.
