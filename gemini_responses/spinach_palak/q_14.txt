As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide scientifically verified advice for controlling soil pests like termites and nematodes in Spinach (Palak) in Haryana. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is crucial for sustainable and effective control, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods.

**General Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Principles for Soil Pests:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove crop residues and weeds that can harbor pests.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** Exposes soil pests to predators and harsh weather conditions, especially during summer fallow.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate spinach with non-host crops (e.g., cereals like wheat, maize, or specific trap crops) to break pest life cycles.
*   **Soil Health:** Incorporate well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost to improve soil structure and promote beneficial microbial activity, which can suppress pest populations.

**1. Termites (Deemak) Control in Spinach (Palak):**

Termites can cause significant damage by feeding on the roots and stem base, leading to wilting, stunted growth, and eventual plant death.

*   **Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
    *   Regular monitoring of fields for termite mounds or activity.
    *   Destroying termite mounds in and around the field.
    *   Avoiding accumulation of undecomposed organic matter near the crop, as this can attract termites.
    *   Ensure proper irrigation to maintain soil moisture, as termites prefer dry conditions.

*   **Chemical Control (Soil Application):**
    *   For effective control, apply a CIBRC-approved insecticide to the soil before sowing or at the time of sowing.
    *   **Fipronil 0.3% GR** at a rate of **10 kg/acre** mixed with the soil during land preparation or applied in furrows at sowing. Ensure uniform mixing in the top 10-15 cm of soil.

**2. Nematodes (Root-knot Nematodes - Meloidogyne spp.) Control in Spinach (Palak):**

Root-knot nematodes are microscopic worms that infect plant roots, causing characteristic galls or knots. This damage impairs water and nutrient uptake, leading to stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, reduced yield, and increased susceptibility to other diseases.

*   **Cultural and Biological Control:**
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate spinach with non-host crops such as marigold (Tagetes spp.), mustard, or cereals (wheat, barley) for at least 2-3 years to significantly reduce nematode populations in the soil.
    *   **Solarization:** During fallow periods in hot summer months (May-June), cover the moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks. This raises soil temperature to levels lethal for nematodes.
    *   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporate well-decomposed FYM, neem cake (**200-400 kg/acre**), or other organic matter into the soil. Neem cake has nematicidal properties and promotes beneficial soil microbes that can antagonize nematodes.
    *   **Bio-nematicides:** Apply biological agents that parasitize or antagonize nematodes.
        *   **Paecilomyces lilacinus** (e.g., 1% WP formulation) at a rate of **2.5 kg/acre** mixed with 50-100 kg of FYM or sand and applied to the soil before sowing or at planting.
        *   **Trichoderma harzianum** (e.g., 1% WP formulation) can also be used similarly for overall soil health and disease suppression, which indirectly helps against nematodes.

*   **Chemical Control (Soil Application):**
    *   Chemical nematicides should be used judiciously and as a last resort, strictly adhering to label instructions and safety precautions. Options for spinach are limited and require careful consideration of specific product approvals and pre-harvest intervals (PHI).
    *   **Carbofuran 3% GR** at a rate of **10 kg/acre** can be applied to the soil at the time of sowing or transplanting.
        *   **Strict Caution:** Carbofuran is a highly toxic chemical. Ensure proper protective gear (gloves, mask) during application. Observe the recommended Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) strictly to avoid residues in edible parts. Consult your local agricultural extension officer for the most current recommendations and safety guidelines specific to your region and crop.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label carefully, including dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Consult your local Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or agricultural extension officer for the most up-to-date and specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and the latest CIBRC approvals in Haryana.
