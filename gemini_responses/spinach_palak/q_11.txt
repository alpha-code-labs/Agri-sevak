Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies in your Spinach (Palak) crop. These pests can cause significant damage by feeding on leaves, stems, and roots, impacting yield and quality.

Here's a scientifically verified approach for their control:

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Principles:**

Before resorting to chemical control, it is always advisable to adopt integrated pest management practices:

1.  **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy crop residues and weeds, which can harbor pests.
2.  **Crop Rotation:** Rotate spinach with non-host crops to break the pest life cycle.
3.  **Timely Sowing:** Adjust sowing dates to avoid peak pest periods if possible.
4.  **Regular Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your spinach crop for early signs of pest infestation. Hand-picking of larger larvae (e.g., sawfly larvae, blister beetles) can be effective in small plots.

**Chemical Control:**

If the pest infestation crosses the economic threshold and cultural practices are insufficient, chemical control may be necessary. Always ensure thorough coverage of the foliage during spraying.

Here are some CIBRC approved technical chemical names effective against Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies in Spinach:

*   **Malathion 50% EC:** Apply at a rate of **1.0 - 1.5 litres per acre** (or 2-3 ml per litre of water). This is effective against a broad spectrum of chewing insects including sawflies and various beetles.
*   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** Apply at a rate of **200 - 250 ml per acre** (or 0.4-0.5 ml per litre of water). This synthetic pyrethroid provides quick knockdown action against beetles, weevils, and sawflies.
*   **Cypermethrin 25% EC:** Apply at a rate of **200 - 250 ml per acre** (or 0.4-0.5 ml per litre of water). Similar to lambda-cyhalothrin, it is effective against a range of chewing pests.
*   **Quinalphos 25% EC:** Apply at a rate of **1.0 - 1.5 litres per acre** (or 2-3 ml per litre of water). This organophosphate insecticide is effective against sawflies and various beetles.
*   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** Apply at a rate of **60 ml per acre** (or 0.12 ml per litre of water). While primarily known for lepidopteran pests, it also shows good efficacy against certain beetles and sawflies, with a favorable safety profile.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Spinach is a leafy vegetable consumed fresh. It is crucial to strictly adhere to the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) mentioned on the product label for any insecticide used. This is the minimum time required between the last spray and harvesting to ensure the produce is safe for consumption.
*   **Safety Precautions:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (gloves, mask, protective clothing) while handling and spraying pesticides.
*   **Sprayer Calibration:** Ensure your sprayer is properly calibrated to achieve uniform coverage and avoid under or over-dosing.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pest resistance.
