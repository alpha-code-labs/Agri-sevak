Mites, including Red Spider Mite (*Tetranychus urticae*) and various Rust Mites, are significant pests of Spinach (Palak) in Haryana, especially during warm and dry periods. They can cause considerable damage, reducing yield and quality.

**Symptoms of Mite Infestation:**
*   **Red Spider Mite:** Small, reddish-brown mites visible on the underside of leaves. Fine webbing may be present, especially in severe infestations. Leaves show yellow or silvery stippling (tiny dots) on the upper surface, eventually turning bronze or reddish-brown and drying up.
*   **Rust Mite:** These are microscopic and not visible to the naked eye. Symptoms include bronzing or russeting of leaves, leaf curling, distortion, and stunted plant growth. The affected leaves may appear leathery or thickened.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies:**

1.  **Regular Monitoring:** Inspect the underside of leaves regularly, especially during dry weather, to detect infestations early.
2.  **Water Management:** Overhead irrigation or strong water sprays can help dislodge mites and reduce their populations, particularly in early stages. Maintain adequate soil moisture to keep plants healthy and less susceptible.
3.  **Weed Control:** Many weeds act as alternate hosts for mites. Keep the field and surrounding areas free of weeds.
4.  **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting spinach or other susceptible crops continuously in the same field.
5.  **Nutrient Management:** Ensure balanced fertilization. Excessive nitrogen can sometimes make plants more attractive to mites.

**Chemical Control (Acaricides):**

When mite populations are high and causing economic damage, chemical control may be necessary. Always ensure thorough coverage of the foliage, especially the underside of the leaves where mites reside. Rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

**Recommended CIBRC Approved Acaricides for Spinach (Palak):**

*   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP:**
    *   Dosage: **5 grams per litre of water** (or **2.5 kg per acre** in 500 litres of water).
    *   Effective against both spider mites and rust mites. It also has fungicidal properties.
    *   Generally has a shorter Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI).

*   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:**
    *   Dosage: **0.5 - 0.6 ml per litre of water** (or **125 - 150 ml per acre** in 200-250 litres of water).
    *   Highly effective against all life stages of spider mites.

*   **Fenpyroximate 5% EC:**
    *   Dosage: **0.8 - 1.2 ml per litre of water** (or **200 - 300 ml per acre** in 200-250 litres of water).
    *   Provides quick knockdown and residual control against spider mites.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Spinach is a leafy vegetable harvested frequently. Always check the product label for the specific Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) before spraying. This is the minimum number of days that must pass between the last pesticide application and harvest to ensure the produce is safe for consumption.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, mask, and protective clothing while handling and spraying pesticides.
*   **Label Instructions:** Strictly follow the instructions, dosage, and safety precautions mentioned on the product label.
*   **Spray Timing:** Spray early in the morning or late in the evening to minimize drift and maximize efficacy. Avoid spraying during hot midday hours.
