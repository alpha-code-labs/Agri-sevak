As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the critical importance of balanced nutrition for optimal Spinach (Palak) yield and quality in Haryana. Micronutrient deficiencies can significantly impact crop health. Here's how to address the specified deficiencies:

It is crucial to conduct a soil test to accurately diagnose specific deficiencies before applying any micronutrients. This ensures targeted application and avoids potential toxicity from over-application.

### Addressing Micro-nutrient Deficiencies in Spinach (Palak)

#### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, small leaves (little leaf), interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, often with a bronzing effect.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray 0.5% solution of **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (5 g/L water) or 0.1% solution of **Zinc EDTA** (1 g/L water) at 15-20 days after sowing/transplanting, and repeat after 15 days if symptoms persist.
    *   **Soil Application (Preventive/Severe Deficiency):**
        *   Apply **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** at 10-25 kg/acre as a basal application, depending on soil test recommendations.

#### 2. Iron (Fe) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Pronounced interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, with veins remaining green, eventually leading to complete yellowing or whitening of the entire leaf.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Foliar Application (Most Effective):**
        *   Spray 0.5-1% solution of **Ferrous sulphate heptahydrate** (5-10 g/L water) or 0.1% solution of **Ferrous EDTA** (1 g/L water) when symptoms appear. Repeat after 7-10 days if necessary.
    *   *Note: Soil application of iron is often less effective in alkaline soils common in Haryana due to rapid fixation.*

#### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, thickening and brittleness of young leaves, malformed or distorted leaves, sometimes internal breakdown of tissue.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray 0.1-0.2% solution of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (1-2 g/L water) at early growth stages.
    *   **Soil Application (Preventive):**
        *   Apply **Borax** at 4-6 kg/acre as a basal application, based on soil test recommendations.
    *   *Caution: Boron can be toxic if over-applied. Always adhere to recommended rates.*

#### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Young leaves are distorted, stunted, or show marginal necrosis (death of tissue) and tip burn. Growing points may die back.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray 0.5% solution of **Calcium chloride** (5 g/L water) or 0.5-1% solution of **Calcium nitrate** (5-10 g/L water) when symptoms are observed. Repeat after 10-15 days if needed.
    *   *Note: Calcium deficiency is rare in Haryana soils unless pH is very low or water stress is severe. Soil application of gypsum can address long-term issues if soil test indicates low calcium and high sodium.*

#### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, starting from the leaf margins and progressing inwards, often giving a mottled appearance. Leaves may become brittle.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray 1-2% solution of **Magnesium sulphate heptahydrate** (10-20 g/L water) when symptoms appear.
    *   **Soil Application (Preventive/Severe Deficiency):**
        *   Apply **Magnesium sulphate heptahydrate** at 10-20 kg/acre as a basal application, based on soil test recommendations.

#### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, similar to iron deficiency but often with a finer network of green veins. In severe cases, brown necrotic spots may appear.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Foliar Application (Most Effective):**
        *   Spray 0.5% solution of **Manganese sulphate monohydrate** (5 g/L water) or 0.1% solution of **Manganese EDTA** (1 g/L water) when symptoms are observed. Repeat after 10-15 days if necessary.
    *   *Note: Foliar application is generally more efficient than soil application in alkaline soils.*

### General Recommendations:

*   **Soil Testing:** Always prioritize soil testing to accurately diagnose deficiencies and determine the precise amount of micronutrients required.
*   **Timing of Spray:** Apply foliar sprays during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to prevent leaf scorching and improve absorption.
*   **Spreader/Sticker:** For foliar applications, consider adding a non-ionic spreader/sticker to improve spray coverage and nutrient uptake.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management:** Combine micronutrient applications with balanced use of macro-nutrients (N, P, K) and organic manures for sustainable soil health and crop productivity.
