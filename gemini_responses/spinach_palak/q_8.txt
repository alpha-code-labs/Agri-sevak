Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling sucking pests in Spinach (Palak) in Haryana.

Effective management of sucking pests like Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips in Spinach requires an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Sucking Pests in Spinach:**

1.  **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your spinach crop, especially the undersides of leaves and tender shoots, for the presence of pests. Early detection is key to effective control.
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the field and surrounding areas free of weeds, as they can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation to break the pest life cycle.
    *   **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to improve air circulation and reduce humidity, which can discourage pest build-up.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, as it can lead to lush, tender growth that is more attractive to sucking pests.
    *   **Yellow Sticky Traps:** Install yellow sticky traps (10-15 traps per acre) to monitor and trap adult whiteflies, leafhoppers, and winged aphids.
3.  **Biological Control:** Encourage natural enemies like ladybird beetles, lacewings, and parasitic wasps, which prey on aphids and whiteflies. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

**Chemical Control (When necessary):**

When pest populations reach economic threshold levels and cultural/biological methods are insufficient, chemical control may be required. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development. Observe the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) strictly, especially for leafy vegetables like spinach.

For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips, the following CIBRC approved technical chemicals can be used:

*   **Imidacloprid** (17.8% SL): Apply at a rate of **0.5 ml per litre of water** or **100 ml per acre** (in 200 litres of water). Effective against aphids, leafhoppers, and whiteflies.
*   **Thiamethoxam** (25% WG): Apply at a rate of **0.2 g per litre of water** or **40 g per acre** (in 200 litres of water). Effective against aphids, leafhoppers, whiteflies, and thrips.
*   **Acetamiprid** (20% SP): Apply at a rate of **0.3 g per litre of water** or **60 g per acre** (in 200 litres of water). Effective against aphids, whiteflies, and thrips.
*   **Flonicamid** (50% WG): Apply at a rate of **0.35 g per litre of water** or **70 g per acre** (in 200 litres of water). Highly effective against aphids and also controls whiteflies.
*   **Spiromesifen** (22.9% SC): Apply at a rate of **0.75 ml per litre of water** or **150 ml per acre** (in 200 litres of water). Primarily effective against whiteflies and mites, with some activity on thrips.

**Regarding Psylla:**
This is not known to affect Spinach (Palak).

**Important Considerations for Chemical Application:**

*   **Timing:** Spray during the cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough coverage of the plant, especially the undersides of leaves where pests often reside.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always check and strictly adhere to the PHI mentioned on the insecticide label to ensure the produce is safe for consumption. For spinach, this is particularly critical due to its short growing cycle and direct consumption.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including gloves, mask, and protective clothing while handling and spraying pesticides.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent pests from developing resistance. Do not use the same chemical repeatedly.
