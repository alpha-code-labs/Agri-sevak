As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following fertilizer doses for Spinach (Palak) cultivation in Haryana. These recommendations are based on scientific research and aim to optimize yield and quality.

**General NPK Recommendation for Spinach (Palak) per acre:**
*   **Nitrogen (N):** 80 kg
*   **Phosphorus (P2O5):** 40 kg
*   **Potassium (K2O):** 40 kg

**Application Strategy:**
*   **Basal Application (at sowing):** All Phosphorus (P) and Potassium (K), along with one-third (1/3rd) of the total Nitrogen (N).
*   **Top Dressing:** The remaining two-thirds (2/3rd) of Nitrogen (N) should be applied in 2-3 split doses after each cutting, starting from the first cutting.

**Specific Fertilizer Recommendations:**

1.  **Urea (46% N)**
    *   **Role:** Primary source of Nitrogen for vigorous leafy growth.
    *   **Dose:**
        *   If **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** is used for Phosphorus: Total **140 kg Urea per acre**.
            *   **Basal:** Apply 47 kg/acre at the time of sowing.
            *   **Top Dressing:** Apply 47 kg/acre after the first cutting, and 46 kg/acre after the second cutting (if multiple cuttings are planned).
        *   If **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** is used for Phosphorus: Total **174 kg Urea per acre**.
            *   **Basal:** Apply 58 kg/acre at the time of sowing.
            *   **Top Dressing:** Apply 58 kg/acre after the first cutting, and 58 kg/acre after the second cutting (if multiple cuttings are planned).

2.  **Nano-Urea (Liquid, 4% N)**
    *   **Role:** Supplemental foliar source of Nitrogen, enhancing nutrient use efficiency and reducing conventional Urea requirement.
    *   **Dose:** Apply 2-4 ml of **Nano-Urea** per litre of water. Conduct 2-3 foliar sprays at 15-20 day intervals, starting 20-25 days after sowing. Ensure good leaf coverage.

3.  **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP) (18% N, 46% P2O5)**
    *   **Role:** Provides Phosphorus for root development and early plant vigor, along with some Nitrogen.
    *   **Dose:** Apply **87 kg Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP) per acre** as a basal application at the time of sowing.

4.  **Nano-DAP (Liquid, 8% N, 16% P2O5)**
    *   **Role:** Supplemental foliar source of Nitrogen and Phosphorus, particularly beneficial during critical growth stages.
    *   **Dose:** Apply 2-4 ml of **Nano-DAP** per litre of water. Conduct 2-3 foliar sprays at 15-20 day intervals, starting 20-25 days after sowing.

5.  **NPK (Complex Fertilizers)**
    *   **Role:** Provides a balanced supply of Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium.
    *   **Dose:** While specific NPK complex fertilizers can be used, it is generally recommended to apply nutrients through individual sources for precise management. If using a complex fertilizer like **12:32:16**, apply **125 kg NPK (12:32:16) per acre** as a basal dose. This will provide approximately 15 kg N, 40 kg P2O5, and 20 kg K2O. You will then need to supplement with additional **Urea** (approx. 65 kg N) and **Muriate of Potash** (approx. 20 kg K2O) to meet the full recommended nutrient requirements.

6.  **Single Super Phosphate (SSP) (16% P2O5, 11% S)**
    *   **Role:** Provides Phosphorus and Sulphur.
    *   **Dose:** If used as the primary Phosphorus source instead of DAP: Apply **250 kg Single Super Phosphate (SSP) per acre** as a basal application at the time of sowing.

7.  **Potash (Muriate of Potash / Sulphate of Potash)**
    *   **Role:** Provides Potassium for overall plant health, disease resistance, and water regulation.
    *   **Dose:**
        *   Using **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** (60% K2O): Apply **67 kg Muriate of Potash per acre** as a basal application at the time of sowing.
        *   Using **Sulphate of Potash (SOP)** (50% K2O, 17.5% S): Apply **80 kg Sulphate of Potash per acre** as a basal application at the time of sowing.

8.  **Sulphur**
    *   **Role:** Essential micronutrient for protein synthesis and chlorophyll formation.
    *   **Dose:** If Sulphur is not adequately supplied by **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** or **Sulphate of Potash (SOP)**, or if soil test indicates a deficiency, apply **20-25 kg Elemental Sulphur (90% S) per acre** as a basal application.

**Important Note:**
These recommendations are general guidelines. For precise fertilizer application, it is highly recommended to conduct a soil test to determine the exact nutrient status of your field. This will allow for tailored fertilizer management, optimizing nutrient use and minimizing environmental impact.
