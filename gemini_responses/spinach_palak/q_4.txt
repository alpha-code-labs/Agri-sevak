Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

Wilt and Parawilt are significant concerns for Spinach (Palak) cultivation in Haryana, potentially leading to substantial yield losses. As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend an integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods for effective control.

**Understanding Wilt and Parawilt:**

*   **Wilt:** Primarily caused by soil-borne fungal pathogens like *Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. spinaciae* or other root rot pathogens such as *Pythium* and *Rhizoctonia*. These pathogens infect the roots, block the water-conducting tissues, and cause the plant to wilt and eventually die.
*   **Parawilt:** This term often refers to a sudden wilting of plants that may not be directly caused by a specific pathogen. It is frequently associated with environmental stresses such as sudden temperature fluctuations, waterlogging, poor drainage, root damage, or nutrient imbalances. For true parawilt (non-pathogenic), chemical treatments are generally ineffective, and management focuses on cultural practices.

**Integrated Management Strategy:**

**1. Cultural and Agronomic Practices (Prevention is Key):**

*   **Site Selection and Drainage:** Choose well-drained fields. Avoid low-lying areas prone to waterlogging, which is a major contributor to both root rot and parawilt. Improve soil drainage by incorporating organic matter.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice a 2-3 year crop rotation with non-host crops (e.g., cereals, maize) to reduce the build-up of soil-borne pathogens. Avoid continuous cultivation of spinach or other susceptible vegetables in the same field.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** If locally adapted and resistant varieties are available, prioritize their use. Consult with HAU extension services for recommendations.
*   **Seed Selection:** Use healthy, certified seeds from reputable sources.
*   **Water Management:** Irrigate judiciously. Avoid overwatering, especially during cooler periods, as excessive moisture favors fungal growth and can induce parawilt. Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the topsoil to dry slightly between irrigations.
*   **Soil Health:** Maintain good soil health by incorporating well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost. This improves soil structure, drainage, and microbial activity, which can suppress pathogens.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure balanced fertilization based on soil test reports. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can make plants more susceptible to diseases.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris immediately to prevent the spread of pathogens.
*   **Soil Solarization:** In summer, covering the moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks can significantly reduce soil-borne pathogen populations.

**2. Biological Control:**

*   **Seed Treatment:**
    *   Treat seeds with **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum** @ 4-5 g/kg seed before sowing. This bio-fungicide colonizes the root zone and suppresses pathogenic fungi.
*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Mix **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum** @ 2.5 kg/acre with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed FYM or compost. Keep the mixture moist for 7-10 days in a shaded area, then broadcast it evenly in the field before sowing or transplanting.

**3. Chemical Control (Judicious Use):**

*   **Seed Treatment:**
    *   To protect seedlings from early infection, treat seeds with:
        *   **Carbendazim** @ 1-2 g/kg seed.
        *   **Thiram** @ 2-3 g/kg seed.
        *   *Note: Do not mix chemical and biological seed treatments. If using both, apply biological treatment after chemical treatment, or choose one based on disease pressure.*
*   **Soil Drench (for established plants showing symptoms):**
    *   For fungal wilts and root rots, drench the soil around the base of the affected plants with:
        *   **Carbendazim** @ 0.5-1 g/L of water. Apply 50-100 ml solution per plant, ensuring it reaches the root zone.
        *   If *Pythium* (often associated with damping-off and root rot leading to wilt) is suspected, use **Propamocarb hydrochloride** @ 2-3 ml/L of water as a soil drench.

Remember, an integrated approach is most effective. Prioritize cultural and biological methods, and use chemicals only when necessary and as per recommended dosages. Always read the label instructions carefully before using any pesticide.
