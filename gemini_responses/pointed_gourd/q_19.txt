Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I advise you on addressing macronutrient deficiencies (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium/Potash) in Pointed Gourd (Parwal).

**Crucial First Step: Soil Testing**
Before applying any fertilizers, it is highly recommended to conduct a soil test. This will accurately determine the existing nutrient levels in your field and help in precise fertilizer recommendations, preventing over-application and nutrient imbalances. The following recommendations are general guidelines to address visible deficiency symptoms.

### Addressing Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   General yellowing (chlorosis) of older leaves, starting from the tips and moving inwards.
*   Stunted plant growth with thin, weak stems.
*   Reduced branching and fewer flowers/fruits.

**Correction Measures:**

1.  **Soil Application (for sustained supply):**
    *   Apply **Urea** (46% N) at 20-30 kg/acre as a top-dressing. Ensure proper irrigation after application for better absorption.
    *   Alternatively, if phosphorus is also required, **Calcium Ammonium Nitrate** (CAN - 25% N) can be used.

2.  **Foliar Application (for quick boost):**
    *   Spray a 1-2% solution of **Urea** (10-20 grams of **Urea** per litre of water).
    *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 7-10 day intervals until symptoms subside. Spray during morning or late afternoon hours.

### Addressing Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   Dark green to purplish discoloration of leaves, especially on the undersides and margins of older leaves.
*   Severely stunted growth, poor root development, and delayed maturity.
*   Reduced flowering and fruit set.

**Correction Measures:**

1.  **Soil Application (for long-term correction):**
    *   Phosphorus is less mobile in the soil, so basal application is most effective. If deficiency is observed later, apply **Diammonium Phosphate** (DAP - 18% N, 46% P2O5) at 25-35 kg/acre.
    *   Alternatively, **Single Superphosphate** (SSP - 16% P2O5) can be applied at 60-80 kg/acre. Incorporate into the soil and irrigate.

2.  **Foliar Application (for temporary relief and quick uptake):**
    *   Spray a 0.5-1% solution of **Monoammonium Phosphate** (MAP - 12% N, 61% P2O5) or **Potassium Dihydrogen Phosphate** (MKP - 0% N, 52% P2O5, 34% K2O) (5-10 grams per litre of water).
    *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals.

### Addressing Potassium (K) Deficiency (Potash)

**Symptoms:**
*   Yellowing and browning (scorching) of leaf margins, particularly on older leaves, while the inner part of the leaf remains green.
*   Weak stems, poor fruit development, and reduced fruit quality.
*   Increased susceptibility to diseases and lodging.

**Correction Measures:**

1.  **Soil Application (for sustained supply):**
    *   Apply **Muriate of Potash** (Potassium Chloride - 60% K2O) at 20-30 kg/acre as a top-dressing.
    *   Alternatively, **Sulphate of Potash** (Potassium Sulphate - 50% K2O, 17.5% S) can be used, especially if sulfur is also deficient. Ensure proper irrigation after application.

2.  **Foliar Application (for quick boost):**
    *   Spray a 0.5-1% solution of **Potassium Nitrate** (13% N, 45% K2O) or **Potassium Dihydrogen Phosphate** (MKP - 0% N, 52% P2O5, 34% K2O) (5-10 grams per litre of water).
    *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 7-10 day intervals until symptoms improve.

**General Advice:**
*   Always ensure adequate soil moisture after applying soil fertilizers to facilitate nutrient uptake.
*   Foliar sprays are best applied during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late afternoon) to prevent leaf scorching and maximize absorption.
*   Maintain good soil drainage and aeration, as waterlogging can hinder nutrient uptake.
