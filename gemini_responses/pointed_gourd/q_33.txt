As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an integrated weed management approach for Pointed Gourd (Parwal) to effectively control the diverse range of weeds you have mentioned. This involves a combination of cultural practices and judicious use of CIBRC-approved herbicides.

### Integrated Weed Management in Pointed Gourd

**A. Cultural and Mechanical Methods:**

1.  **Manual Weeding and Hoeing:** This is the most effective method, especially during the early stages of crop growth. Perform 2-3 manual weedings at 20-25, 40-45, and 60-65 days after planting.
2.  **Mulching:** Applying organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves) or plastic mulch can significantly suppress weed growth, conserve soil moisture, and regulate soil temperature.
3.  **Clean Cultivation:** Ensure the field is free of weeds before planting. Remove weeds from field bunds and irrigation channels to prevent seed dispersal.
4.  **Crop Rotation:** Rotate Pointed Gourd with non-host crops or crops that allow for different weed control strategies to break the weed cycle, especially for parasitic weeds.
5.  **Use Clean Planting Material:** Ensure that the planting material (root cuttings/slips) is free from weed seeds or parasitic weed attachments.

**B. Herbicidal Control:**

Herbicides should be used as a supplement to cultural practices. Always ensure proper application techniques, correct dosages, and safety precautions.

**1. For Broadleaf Weeds (e.g., Bathu, Congress grass) and Narrowleaf Weeds (e.g., Phalaris minor):**

*   **Pre-emergence Herbicides:** These are applied to the soil surface after planting but before the emergence of weeds and the crop. They require adequate soil moisture for activation.
    *   **Pendimethalin** (30% EC): Apply 3.3 litres per acre in 200-250 litres of water within 1-3 days of planting Pointed Gourd. This provides good control of germinating broadleaf and narrowleaf weeds. It also offers some suppression of germinating Amarbail seeds.
    *   **Fluchloralin** (45% EC): Apply 2.2 litres per acre in 200-250 litres of water as a pre-plant incorporation (mixed into the soil before planting) or as a pre-emergence spray within 1-3 days of planting.

*   **Post-emergence Herbicides (specifically for Narrowleaf Weeds/Grasses like Phalaris minor):**
    *   **Quizalofop-ethyl** (5% EC): Apply 500 ml per acre in 200-250 litres of water when grass weeds are at the 2-4 leaf stage. This herbicide is selective for grasses and generally safe for Pointed Gourd.
    *   **Haloxyfop-methyl** (10.5% EC): Apply 500 ml per acre in 200-250 litres of water when grass weeds are at the 2-4 leaf stage. This is another effective selective herbicide for grass control.

**2. For Parasitic Weeds:**

*   **Amarbail (Cuscuta):**
    *   Effective chemical control *in-crop* without harming Pointed Gourd is very challenging once Amarbail is established.
    *   **Prevention is key:** Use clean seeds/planting material, remove Amarbail from field borders and nearby host plants.
    *   **Manual Removal:** Immediately remove and destroy any Amarbail patches as soon as they are noticed, before they produce seeds.
    *   **Pendimethalin** (as mentioned above) can offer some pre-emergence suppression of Amarbail seed germination.

*   **Orobanche (Broomrape):**
    *   Effective chemical control for Orobanche *in-crop* in Pointed Gourd is not available.
    *   **Cultural Methods are Crucial:**
        *   **Manual Removal:** Regularly remove Orobanche spikes before they flower and set seeds. This is critical to reduce the seed bank in the soil.
        *   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate with non-host crops (e.g., cereals) for several years.
        *   **Trap Cropping/Catch Cropping:** Planting crops that stimulate Orobanche germination but are not parasitized (trap crops) or are parasitized but removed before Orobanche flowers (catch crops) can help reduce the seed bank.

**3. For Congress Grass (Parthenium hysterophorus):**

*   **Pre-emergence:** **Pendimethalin** (as mentioned above) can provide good control of germinating Parthenium.
*   **Post-emergence:** For established Parthenium plants *in-crop*, manual removal is the safest and most recommended method, as most selective broadleaf herbicides are phytotoxic to Pointed Gourd.

**4. Non-Selective Herbicides (for inter-row application or before planting):**

These herbicides kill all green vegetation they come into contact with and must be used with extreme caution to avoid contact with the Pointed Gourd crop. They are useful for clearing pathways, field borders, or for pre-planting weed control.

*   **Glyphosate** (41% SL): Apply 2.0-4.0 litres per acre in 200-250 litres of water. Use a hooded sprayer for shielded application between rows to prevent drift onto the crop.
*   **Paraquat dichloride** (24% SL): Apply 2.0-4.0 litres per acre in 200-250 litres of water. This is a contact herbicide, effective for quick knockdown. Use a hooded sprayer for shielded application.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Timing:** Adhere strictly to the recommended application timings (pre-emergence, post-emergence at specific weed stages).
*   **Soil Moisture:** Pre-emergence herbicides require adequate soil moisture for activation. Irrigate if the soil is dry after application.
*   **Spray Volume:** Use sufficient water volume (200-250 litres per acre) for uniform coverage.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (gloves, mask, protective clothing) during herbicide handling and application. Read and follow the label instructions carefully.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate herbicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of herbicide resistance in weeds.

By combining these methods, you can achieve effective and sustainable weed control in your Pointed Gourd cultivation.
