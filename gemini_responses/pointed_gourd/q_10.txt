As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for the control of pests in Pointed Gourd (Parwal) in Haryana.

It is crucial to adopt an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, mechanical, biological, and judicious chemical methods for sustainable pest control.

### General Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Principles:

*   **Field Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy infested plant parts, fallen fruits, and weeds which can harbor pests.
*   **Monitoring:** Regularly scout the field to detect pest infestations early.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation to break pest cycles.
*   **Supportive Cropping:** Grow trap crops or border crops if suitable for specific pests.
*   **Biological Control:** Encourage natural enemies of pests.

### Specific Pest Control Recommendations:

#### 1. Borers (Fruit Borers, Stem Borers)

Pointed gourd is primarily affected by fruit borers (e.g., *Diaphania indica* - pumpkin caterpillar/melon worm, which can bore into fruits). Stem borers are less common but can occur.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Collect and destroy all infested fruits and plant parts to prevent further spread.
    *   Deep ploughing after harvest can expose pupae to predators and harsh weather.
*   **Biological Control:**
    *   Release of egg parasitoids like *Trichogramma chilonis* @ 50,000 eggs/acre, 3-4 times at weekly intervals, starting from flowering.
*   **Chemical Control (Apply when infestation is observed, especially at flowering and fruiting stages):**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC @ 60 ml/acre
    *   **Flubendiamide** 20% WG @ 60 g/acre
    *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG @ 80-100 g/acre
    *   **Cyantraniliprole** 10.26% OD @ 180 ml/acre
    *   **Spinosad** 45% SC @ 64 ml/acre

#### 2. Caterpillars and Leaf folders

Various caterpillars can infest pointed gourd, feeding on leaves, flowers, and fruits. The pumpkin caterpillar (*Diaphania indica*) can also web leaves together, which might be perceived as leaf folding. The control measures for these are often similar to fruit borers.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Hand-picking and destroying larger caterpillars in small areas.
    *   Maintain field hygiene.
*   **Chemical Control (Apply when significant leaf damage or caterpillar presence is observed):**
    *   **Indoxacarb** 14.5% SC @ 200 ml/acre
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC @ 200-250 ml/acre
    *   **Quinalphos** 25% EC @ 800-1000 ml/acre
    *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC @ 1000-1250 ml/acre
    *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG @ 80-100 g/acre (also effective against caterpillars)

#### 3. Diamondback moth

This is not known to affect Pointed Gourd.

### Important Considerations for Chemical Application:

*   Always use the recommended dosage and ensure thorough spray coverage, typically using 200-250 liters of water per acre.
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
*   Observe the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) for each chemical to ensure the safety of the produce.
*   Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying.
*   Consult local agricultural extension workers for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions.
