Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding the various rot types affecting Pointed Gourd (Parwal). Pointed Gourd is susceptible to a range of rot diseases, including Root, Stem, Foot, Collar, Crown, Neck, Black, Fruit, Seed, and Seedling rot, primarily caused by various fungal and oomycete pathogens like *Pythium*, *Phytophthora*, *Fusarium*, *Rhizoctonia*, *Sclerotium*, and *Colletotrichum*.

Effective control requires an Integrated Disease Management (IDM) approach, combining cultural practices, biological methods, and judicious use of CIBRC-approved chemical fungicides.

Here's a comprehensive strategy to manage all rot types in Pointed Gourd:

**I. Cultural Practices (Preventive Measures):**

1.  **Site Selection and Soil Preparation:**
    *   Choose well-drained fields. Avoid low-lying areas prone to waterlogging.
    *   Prepare raised beds or ridges to improve drainage around the plant base.
    *   Ensure good soil aeration by deep ploughing.
2.  **Crop Rotation:**
    *   Practice a 2-3 year crop rotation with non-cucurbit crops to reduce pathogen build-up in the soil.
    *   Avoid planting Pointed Gourd in fields where cucurbits or other susceptible crops have recently been grown.
3.  **Use of Healthy Planting Material:**
    *   Pointed Gourd is primarily propagated by vine cuttings. Always use healthy, disease-free cuttings from vigorous mother plants.
    *   If using seeds, ensure they are certified disease-free.
4.  **Water Management:**
    *   Avoid over-irrigation and waterlogging, especially around the plant base.
    *   Irrigate in the morning to allow foliage and soil surface to dry before evening.
    *   Use drip irrigation if possible, to minimize wetting of foliage and stems.
5.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Provide balanced nutrition. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can lead to lush, susceptible growth.
    *   Ensure adequate potassium and calcium, which can improve plant resistance.
6.  **Field Sanitation:**
    *   Promptly remove and destroy infected plant parts (leaves, stems, fruits) and entire diseased plants to prevent further spread.
    *   Clear plant debris after harvest.
7.  **Weed Control:**
    *   Manage weeds effectively as they can act as alternate hosts for pathogens and impede air circulation.
8.  **Proper Spacing:**
    *   Maintain recommended plant spacing to ensure good air circulation, which helps in drying foliage and reducing humidity.

**II. Biological Control:**

Biological agents can be highly effective in preventing soil-borne rot diseases.

*   **For Seed/Vine Cutting Treatment and Soil Application:**
    *   Treat vine cuttings by dipping them in a solution of **Trichoderma viride** 1% WP at 10 grams per litre of water for 30 minutes before planting.
    *   Mix **Trichoderma viride** 1% WP or **Trichoderma harzianum** 1% WP at 2.5 kg per acre with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost. Keep the mixture moist for 7-10 days in a shaded area, then broadcast and incorporate into the soil before planting.
    *   Alternatively, use **Pseudomonas fluorescens** 1% WP at 2.5 kg per acre mixed with FYM as described above, or for vine cutting treatment at 10 grams per litre of water.

**III. Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved Technical Chemical Names):**

Chemical interventions should be used as part of an IDM strategy, especially when disease pressure is high. Always follow label instructions for dosage and safety.

**A. For Seed Rot, Seedling Rot (Damping-off), Root Rot, Collar Rot, Foot Rot (Preventive):**

1.  **Vine Cutting Treatment (for Pointed Gourd propagation):**
    *   Dip vine cuttings in a solution of **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 2 grams per litre of water for 30 minutes before planting.
    *   Alternatively, use **Metalaxyl-M** 35% WS at 3-4 grams per litre of water for 30 minutes, especially if oomycete pathogens (*Pythium*, *Phytophthora*) are suspected.
2.  **Soil Drenching (at planting or early growth stage):**
    *   Drench the soil around the plant base with **Propamocarb hydrochloride** 72.2% SL at 2-3 ml per litre of water.
    *   Alternatively, use a combination product of **Metalaxyl-M 4% + Mancozeb 64% WP** at 2-2.5 grams per litre of water.
    *   For general fungal control, drench with **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 1-1.5 grams per litre of water.
    *   For oomycete-related rots, **Fosetyl-aluminium** 80% WP can be drenched at 2.5 grams per litre of water.

**B. For Stem Rot, Black Rot, Fruit Rot, Crown Rot, Neck Rot (Curative and Preventive):**

These often require foliar sprays and targeted drenching.

1.  **Foliar Spray/Targeted Drenching:**
    *   Apply a spray of **Mancozeb** 75% WP at 2-2.5 grams per litre of water. This is a broad-spectrum contact fungicide effective against many fungal rots.
    *   For systemic action and broader spectrum, spray **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC at 0.5-1 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Chlorothalonil** 75% WP at 2 grams per litre of water can be used as a protective spray.
    *   **Propineb** 70% WP at 2.5 grams per litre of water is another good contact fungicide option.
    *   For bacterial components or general broad-spectrum control, **Copper Oxychloride** 50% WP can be sprayed at 2.5-3 grams per litre of water.
    *   In case of severe stem or crown rot, a targeted drenching with **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 1-1.5 grams per litre of water or **Metalaxyl-M 4% + Mancozeb 64% WP** at 2-2.5 grams per litre of water around the affected plant base can be beneficial.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Diagnosis:** Accurate identification of the specific pathogen causing the rot can help in selecting the most effective control measure.
*   **Rotation of Chemicals:** To prevent the development of fungicide resistance, rotate fungicides with different modes of action.
*   **Adherence to PHI:** Always observe the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) for any chemical applied to ensure the safety of the produce.
*   **Safety:** Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) while handling and applying chemicals.

By implementing these integrated strategies, you can effectively manage and control various rot diseases in your Pointed Gourd crop, ensuring healthy growth and good yield.
