As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in Pointed Gourd (Parwal) in Haryana:

Effective pest management in Pointed Gourd relies on an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, mechanical, and judicious chemical methods.

### Control of Beetles in Pointed Gourd

Beetles, particularly the Red Pumpkin Beetle (Aulacophora foveicollis) and Epilachna Beetle (Epilachna vigintioctopunctata), are common pests of Pointed Gourd. The Red Pumpkin Beetle adults feed on leaves, flowers, and fruits, while its grubs damage roots. Epilachna beetles (both adults and grubs) scrape the chlorophyll from leaves, leaving a characteristic lacy appearance.

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Methods:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy crop residues and weeds that can harbor pests.
*   **Early Sowing:** Sowing early can help plants establish before peak pest populations.
*   **Hand Picking:** Regularly inspect plants and hand-pick adult beetles and grubs, especially in small plots, and destroy them.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate Pointed Gourd with non-cucurbit crops to break the pest cycle.

**2. Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved Technical Chemicals):**
For severe infestations, especially during the early stages of crop growth, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always follow label instructions for dosage and pre-harvest interval (PHI).

*   **For Red Pumpkin Beetle and Epilachna Beetle:**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at 0.5-0.75 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at 0.2-0.4 g per litre of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** Apply at 1 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Fipronil 5% SC:** Apply at 2 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Malathion 50% EC:** Apply at 2 ml per litre of water.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always ensure thorough spray coverage for effective pest control.
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
*   Observe the recommended pre-harvest interval (PHI) for any chemical applied to ensure the safety of the produce.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) while handling and applying pesticides.
