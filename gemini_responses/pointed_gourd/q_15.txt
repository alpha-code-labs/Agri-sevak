As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Pointed Gourd in Haryana:

**1. Grasshopper:**
Grasshoppers are generalist feeders and can cause significant damage to Pointed Gourd by feeding on leaves and tender shoots.

*   **Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
    *   Regular monitoring of the field, especially during early crop stages.
    *   Hand-picking of nymphs and adults in small infestations.
    *   Maintaining field sanitation to reduce breeding sites.
*   **Chemical Control (as per CIBRC approved technical chemicals):**
    *   For effective control, spray when infestation is observed:
        *   **Malathion 50% EC**: 1.25 L per acre (or 2.5 ml per litre of water).
        *   **Quinalphos 25% EC**: 1.0 L per acre (or 2.0 ml per litre of water).
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC**: 200-250 ml per acre (or 0.4-0.5 ml per litre of water).
        *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC**: 1.0 L per acre (or 2.0 ml per litre of water).

**2. Painted bug:**
This is not known to affect Pointed Gourd.

**3. Red cotton bug:**
This is not known to affect Pointed Gourd.

**4. Black ants:**
Black ants are generally not direct pests of Pointed Gourd, but they can be a nuisance, protect sap-sucking pests (like aphids and mealybugs) for their honeydew, and their nesting activity can sometimes disturb plant roots.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Maintain good field sanitation and remove any debris that might serve as nesting sites.
    *   If ants are protecting other sap-sucking pests, control of the primary pest will often reduce ant activity.
*   **Chemical Control (as per CIBRC approved technical chemicals):**
    *   For drenching around the base of affected plants or directly into ant nests:
        *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC**: 2.0 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL**: 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   For soil application around nests or affected areas:
        *   **Fipronil 0.3% GR**: 5-10 kg per acre.
