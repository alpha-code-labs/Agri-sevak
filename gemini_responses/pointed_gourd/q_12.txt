Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm that Scale insects and Mealybugs are indeed significant sap-sucking pests that can affect Pointed Gourd (Parwal) cultivation in Haryana, leading to reduced plant vigour, stunted growth, and decreased yield. Effective management requires an integrated approach.

Here is a scientifically verified approach to control Scale insects and Mealybugs in Pointed Gourd:

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategy:**

1.  **Regular Monitoring:** Regularly inspect plants, especially the undersides of leaves, stems, and fruit, for early signs of infestation. Early detection is crucial for effective control.
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy severely infested plant parts (leaves, stems, fruits) to reduce pest populations.
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the field free of weeds, as they can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
    *   **Ant Control:** Ants often protect mealybugs and scales to feed on their honeydew. Managing ant populations around the plants can help reduce mealybug and scale infestations.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can promote lush, succulent growth that is more attractive to sap-sucking pests.
3.  **Biological Control:** Encourage natural enemies such as ladybird beetles, lacewings, and parasitic wasps, which prey on or parasitize mealybugs and scales. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.
4.  **Mechanical Control:** For small infestations, mealybugs and scales can be dislodged using a strong jet of water or by wiping them off with a cloth dipped in soapy water.

**Chemical Control (When infestation is severe and other methods are insufficient):**

When chemical intervention is necessary, choose CIBRC-approved insecticides and ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and stem junctions where these pests tend to aggregate. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

Here are some CIBRC-approved technical chemical names effective against Scale insects and Mealybugs:

*   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** An insect growth regulator that interferes with the molting process of nymphs.
    *   **Dosage:** 1.0 - 1.25 ml per litre of water.
*   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** A systemic neonicotinoid insecticide that is highly effective against sap-sucking pests.
    *   **Dosage:** 0.5 - 0.7 ml per litre of water.
*   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Another systemic neonicotinoid, effective through contact and stomach action.
    *   **Dosage:** 0.2 - 0.3 g per litre of water.
*   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:** A systemic insecticide with unique two-way movement (xylem and phloem), providing excellent control of hidden pests.
    *   **Dosage:** 0.75 - 1.0 ml per litre of water.
*   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** A systemic neonicotinoid with translaminar action, effective against a wide range of sucking pests.
    *   **Dosage:** 0.2 - 0.3 g per litre of water.
*   **Azadirachtin (Neem-based formulations, e.g., 1500 ppm):** A botanical insecticide that acts as an antifeedant, repellent, and insect growth regulator, particularly useful for early infestations or as part of an organic approach.
    *   **Dosage:** 3.0 - 5.0 ml per litre of water.
*   **Horticultural Mineral Oil (HMO):** Can be used to smother scales and mealybugs, especially their crawler stages.
    *   **Dosage:** 10 - 20 ml per litre of water (ensure proper emulsification).

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Thorough Coverage:** Ensure the spray solution reaches all parts of the plant, especially the undersides of leaves and stem crevices where pests hide.
*   **Timing of Application:** Apply insecticides during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   **Safety Precautions:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, and protective clothing while handling and applying pesticides.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Strictly adhere to the pre-harvest interval mentioned on the product label to ensure the safety of the produce for consumption.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance in pest populations.

By implementing these strategies, you can effectively manage Scale insects and Mealybugs in your Pointed Gourd crop and ensure healthy yields. For specific product recommendations and current approvals, always consult your local agricultural extension officer or the latest CIBRC guidelines.
