As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Pointed Gourd (Parwal) in Haryana.

**General Management Practices for Fungal Diseases:**

Before resorting to chemical control, it is crucial to implement good cultural practices to minimize disease incidence:
*   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting pointed gourd or other cucurbits in the same field year after year. Rotate with non-host crops.
*   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris, leaves, and fruits immediately to reduce inoculum sources.
*   **Spacing:** Maintain adequate plant spacing to ensure good air circulation, which helps reduce humidity and fungal growth.
*   **Irrigation:** Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day. Drip irrigation or furrow irrigation is preferred. If overhead irrigation is used, do it in the morning to allow foliage to dry quickly.
*   **Nutrition:** Provide balanced nutrition. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can lead to lush, susceptible growth.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available, choose disease-resistant or tolerant varieties.
*   **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect plants for early signs of disease to enable timely intervention.

Here's how to control the specific fungal diseases you've mentioned:

### Diseases Affecting Pointed Gourd:

**1. Alternaria (Leaf Spot / Early Blight)**
This disease causes small, circular to irregular spots on leaves, which often enlarge and develop concentric rings, giving a "target-board" appearance. Severe infection can lead to defoliation.

**Chemical Control:**
*   **Mancozeb** (75% WP): 2.0-2.5 g/L water
*   **Chlorothalonil** (75% WP): 2.0 g/L water
*   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC): 0.5-1.0 ml/L water
*   **Tebuconazole** (25.9% EC): 0.75-1.0 ml/L water
*   **Copper Oxychloride** (50% WP): 2.5-3.0 g/L water

**2. Anthracnose**
Anthracnose causes dark, sunken lesions on leaves, stems, and fruits. On fruits, these lesions can be circular and watery, often leading to fruit rot.

**Chemical Control:**
*   **Carbendazim** (50% WP): 0.5-1.0 g/L water
*   **Mancozeb** (75% WP): 2.0-2.5 g/L water
*   **Chlorothalonil** (75% WP): 2.0 g/L water
*   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC): 0.5-1.0 ml/L water
*   **Tebuconazole** (25.9% EC): 0.75-1.0 ml/L water

**3. Blight (General Leaf Blight Symptoms) & Brown Spot**
"Blight" is a general term often referring to rapid browning and death of plant tissues, while "Brown spot" describes lesions with a brownish discoloration. In pointed gourd, these symptoms can be caused by various fungi, including *Alternaria* species or other leaf spot pathogens. The control measures are similar to those for Alternaria and Anthracnose.

**Chemical Control:**
*   **Mancozeb** (75% WP): 2.0-2.5 g/L water
*   **Chlorothalonil** (75% WP): 2.0 g/L water
*   **Copper Oxychloride** (50% WP): 2.5-3.0 g/L water
*   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC): 0.5-1.0 ml/L water
*   **Tebuconazole** (25.9% EC): 0.75-1.0 ml/L water

**4. Downy Mildew**
Downy mildew appears as angular, yellowish spots on the upper surface of leaves, often delimited by veins. On the underside, a purplish-grey, fuzzy growth (spores) can be observed, especially in humid conditions. It can cause rapid defoliation.

**Chemical Control:**
*   **Mancozeb** (75% WP): 2.0-2.5 g/L water (for protective sprays)
*   **Propamocarb hydrochloride** (72.2% SL): 2.0-2.5 ml/L water
*   **Cymoxanil + Mancozeb** (8% + 64% WP): 2.5-3.0 g/L water
*   **Fenamidone + Propamocarb hydrochloride** (10% + 37.5% SC): 2.0 ml/L water
*   **Fluopicolide + Propamocarb hydrochloride** (6% + 60% SC): 1.5-2.0 ml/L water
*   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC): 0.5-1.0 ml/L water

**5. Powdery Mildew**
Powdery mildew is characterized by white, powdery patches on the upper and lower surfaces of leaves, stems, and sometimes fruits. Severe infection can lead to stunted growth, reduced yield, and poor fruit quality.

**Chemical Control:**
*   **Sulphur** (80% WP/WDG): 2.0-3.0 g/L water
*   **Myclobutanil** (10% WP): 0.4-0.6 g/L water
*   **Penconazole** (10% EC): 0.5 ml/L water
*   **Hexaconazole** (5% EC): 0.5-1.0 ml/L water
*   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC): 0.5-1.0 ml/L water
*   **Tebuconazole** (25.9% EC): 0.75-1.0 ml/L water

### Diseases Not Known to Affect Pointed Gourd:

**1. Blast**
This is not known to affect Pointed Gourd. Blast is primarily a disease of cereals like rice, wheat, and millets.

**2. Grey Mildew**
This is not known to affect Pointed Gourd. Grey mildew is a specific disease primarily affecting cotton.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Rotation of Fungicides:** To prevent the development of fungicide resistance, it is crucial to rotate fungicides with different modes of action. Do not use the same chemical repeatedly.
*   **Timing of Application:** Apply fungicides preventively or at the very first sign of disease for best efficacy.
*   **Adherence to Label Instructions:** Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the fungicide label regarding dosage, application method, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and safety precautions.
*   **Safety:** Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying.
*   **Consult Local Experts:** For specific recommendations tailored to your local conditions and current disease pressure, always consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts.
