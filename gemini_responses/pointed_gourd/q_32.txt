"Drying up" (सूखना) in Pointed Gourd (परवल) is a general symptom that can be caused by various factors, including diseases, pests, and environmental stresses. A precise diagnosis is crucial for effective management. Please observe the specific patterns of drying, affected plant parts, and any other associated symptoms.

Here are the common causes and their management strategies:

### **I. Wilting Diseases (Fungal and Bacterial Wilts)**

These are among the most common causes of drying branches, leaves, and entire plants.

**Symptoms:**
*   Initial yellowing and wilting of leaves, often starting from one side of the plant or a particular branch.
*   Leaves may remain attached but turn brown and dry.
*   Vascular discoloration (browning of internal stem tissues) when the stem is cut open near the base.
*   Sudden collapse and drying of the entire plant.

**Management:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting pointed gourd or other cucurbits in the same field for at least 3-4 years.
    *   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris immediately.
    *   **Soil Health:** Improve soil drainage and aeration. Avoid waterlogging.
    *   **Resistant Varieties:** If available, choose varieties known for wilt resistance.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum**: Apply 2.5-5 kg/acre mixed with 50-100 kg of Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost before planting, or drench around the root zone at 5-10 g/L of water.

3.  **Chemical Control (after confirming diagnosis):**
    *   **For Fungal Wilts (e.g., Fusarium Wilt):**
        *   Drench the soil around the base of the affected plants with a solution of **Carbendazim** 12% + **Mancozeb** 63% WP at 2 g/L of water, or **Thiophanate-methyl** 70% WP at 1-1.5 g/L of water. Repeat after 10-15 days if necessary.
    *   **For Bacterial Wilts:**
        *   Drench the soil with **Streptomycin sulfate** 9% + **Tetracycline hydrochloride** 1% SP at 0.5-1 g/L of water.
        *   Alternatively, spray **Copper oxychloride** 50% WP at 2-3 g/L of water on foliage and drench the soil.

### **II. Root-Knot Nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.)**

Nematodes damage roots, impairing water and nutrient uptake, leading to wilting and drying symptoms, especially during stress.

**Symptoms:**
*   Stunted growth, yellowing, and wilting of plants, even with adequate moisture.
*   Presence of galls (swellings) on the roots, which are visible upon uprooting the plant.
*   Reduced fruit set and yield.

**Management:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate with non-host crops like cereals (wheat, maize) for 2-3 years.
    *   **Summer Ploughing:** Deep ploughing during summer exposes nematodes to heat, reducing their population.
    *   **Solarization:** Cover the soil with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks during hot summer months.
    *   **Marigold Intercropping:** Planting marigolds (Tagetes spp.) as a trap crop can help reduce nematode populations.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   **Paecilomyces lilacinus** or **Purpureocillium lilacinum**: Apply 2.5-5 kg/acre mixed with 50-100 kg of FYM or compost before planting, or drench around the root zone at 5-10 g/L of water.

3.  **Chemical Control:**
    *   Apply **Fluopyram** 17.7% SC as a soil drench at 625 ml/acre at the time of planting or early growth stage.

### **III. Mite Infestation (e.g., Two-spotted spider mite)**

Severe mite infestations can cause significant damage, leading to drying of leaves.

**Symptoms:**
*   Fine white or yellow stippling on the upper surface of leaves.
*   Bronzing or reddish-brown discoloration of leaves.
*   Fine webbing on the underside of leaves and between branches in severe cases.
*   Leaves become brittle, curl, and eventually dry up and fall off.

**Management:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Water Sprays:** Strong jets of water can dislodge mites from the underside of leaves.
    *   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy heavily infested leaves or plant parts.
    *   **Weed Control:** Keep the field free of weeds, which can act as alternate hosts for mites.

2.  **Chemical Control (Acaricides):**
    *   Spray **Spiromesifen** 22.9% SC at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, use **Fenpyroximate** 5% EC at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   Or, **Propargite** 57% EC at 1-1.5 ml/L of water.
    *   Or, **Abamectin** 1.9% EC at 0.3-0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   Ensure thorough coverage, especially on the underside of leaves. Rotate acaricides to prevent resistance development.

### **IV. Anthracnose (Colletotrichum lagenarium)**

This fungal disease can cause lesions on leaves, stems, and fruits, leading to dieback and drying.

**Symptoms:**
*   Dark, sunken spots on leaves, stems, and fruits.
*   Lesions on stems can girdle them, causing wilting and drying of the distal parts.
*   Leaves may turn yellow, brown, and dry up.

**Management:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris.
    *   **Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing for good air circulation.
    *   **Seed Treatment:** Use disease-free seeds or treat seeds with fungicides.

2.  **Chemical Control:**
    *   Spray **Mancozeb** 75% WP at 2-2.5 g/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, use **Chlorothalonil** 75% WP at 2 g/L of water.
    *   Or, **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC at 0.5-1 ml/L of water.
    *   A combination product like **Carbendazim** 12% + **Mancozeb** 63% WP at 2 g/L of water can also be effective.

### **V. Water Stress (Drought or Waterlogging)**

Both insufficient and excessive water can lead to drying symptoms.

**Symptoms:**
*   **Drought:** General wilting, yellowing, and drying of leaves, starting from older leaves. Stunted growth.
*   **Waterlogging:** Yellowing, wilting, and drying due to root rot and lack of oxygen. Plants may appear to be wilting even when the soil is wet.

**Management:**

1.  **Irrigation Management:**
    *   **Proper Scheduling:** Provide consistent and adequate irrigation, especially during flowering and fruiting stages.
    *   **Drainage:** Ensure good drainage in the field to prevent waterlogging. Raised beds can be beneficial in areas prone to waterlogging.
    *   **Mulching:** Apply organic mulch around the plants to conserve soil moisture and regulate soil temperature.

### **VI. Stem Borers**

Larvae of certain insects bore into the stems, disrupting water and nutrient flow, causing wilting and drying of affected branches.

**Symptoms:**
*   Sudden wilting and drying of individual branches or vines.
*   Presence of entry holes on the stem, often with frass (excrement) extruded from the hole.
*   Hollowed-out stems when cut open.

**Management:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect plants for signs of borer activity.
    *   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy infested branches immediately to prevent further spread.
    *   **Sanitation:** Clear plant debris after harvest.

2.  **Chemical Control:**
    *   Inject a solution of **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC at 0.3 ml/L of water into the borer holes.
    *   Alternatively, spray **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG at 0.4 g/L of water, targeting the affected stems.

**General Advice:**

*   **Early Diagnosis:** The key to effective management is early and accurate diagnosis. Carefully examine the entire plant, including roots, stems, and leaves.
*   **Integrated Pest and Disease Management (IPDM):** Always combine cultural, biological, and chemical methods for sustainable control.
*   **Consult Experts:** If you are unsure about the cause, collect samples of affected plants and consult with the plant pathology or entomology experts at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU), Hisar, or your nearest Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) for precise identification and recommendations.

By carefully observing the symptoms and implementing the appropriate management strategies, you can effectively address the drying up problem in your pointed gourd crop.
