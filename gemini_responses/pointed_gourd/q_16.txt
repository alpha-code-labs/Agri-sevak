As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend the following fertilizer schedule for Pointed Gourd (Parwal) in Haryana. Please note that these are general recommendations, and a soil test report is crucial for precise nutrient management.

**General Nutrient Recommendation (per acre per year):**
For Pointed Gourd, a perennial crop, the typical nutrient requirement is:
*   Nitrogen (N): 80-100 kg
*   Phosphorus (P2O5): 60-80 kg
*   Potassium (K2O): 60-80 kg
*   Sulphur (S): 10-15 kg

Based on these requirements, here is a breakdown of the recommended doses for the specified fertilizers:

**1. Basal Application (at planting or at the start of the new growth cycle after pruning):**
Apply the following fertilizers per acre, mixed well into the soil before planting or around the base of established plants after pruning:

*   **DAP (Di-Ammonium Phosphate):** 130-175 kg (Provides 23-31.5 kg N and 60-80 kg P2O5)
*   **Potash (Muriate of Potash - MOP):** 100-135 kg (Provides 60-80 kg K2O)
*   **Sulphur (Bentonite Sulphur 90%):** 10-17 kg (Provides 9-15 kg S)
*   **Urea:** 15-20 kg (To supplement initial N requirement, if using DAP. If using SSP, more Urea might be needed basally.)

**Alternatively, if using SSP for Phosphorus and Sulphur:**

*   **SSP (Single Super Phosphate):** 375-500 kg (Provides 60-80 kg P2O5 and 41-55 kg S)
*   **Potash (Muriate of Potash - MOP):** 100-135 kg (Provides 60-80 kg K2O)
*   **Urea:** 50-60 kg (To meet the initial N requirement, as SSP provides no N)

**2. Top-Dressing (for Nitrogen):**
The remaining Nitrogen should be applied in 2-3 split doses during the active growth and fruiting periods, typically at 2-3 month intervals after the basal application.

*   **Urea:** 60-75 kg per acre per application.
    *   Apply 2-3 such applications, depending on the crop vigor and yield. For example, if 80 kg N is the target and 25 kg N was applied basally (from DAP + Urea), then 55 kg N remains. This can be split into two applications of approximately 60 kg **Urea** each (providing 27.6 kg N per application).

**3. NPK Complex Fertilizers:**
If using NPK complex fertilizers (e.g., 12:32:16, 10:26:26, 19:19:19), adjust the doses of individual fertilizers accordingly to meet the N, P, and K requirements. For example:
*   To provide 60 kg P2O5 using **NPK 12:32:16**, you would need approximately 187.5 kg of **NPK 12:32:16** per acre. This would also provide 22.5 kg N and 30 kg K2O. You would then need to supplement the remaining N and K using **Urea** and **Potash**.

**4. Nano-Fertilizers (Foliar Application):**
Nano-fertilizers are supplementary and highly efficient for foliar nutrient uptake. They can reduce the requirement for conventional fertilizers by 10-20% when used effectively.

*   **Nano-Urea:**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Application:** Spray 2-3 times during the vegetative growth and early fruiting stages.
*   **Nano-DAP:**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Application:** Spray 1-2 times during the pre-flowering and flowering stages.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Soil Testing:** Always conduct a soil test to determine the exact nutrient status of your field. This will help in fine-tuning the fertilizer doses and avoiding over or under-application.
*   **Organic Manures:** Incorporate 10-15 tonnes of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost per acre annually to improve soil health and nutrient availability.
*   **Micronutrients:** Based on soil test reports, apply micronutrients like Zinc, Boron, and Iron if deficiencies are observed.
