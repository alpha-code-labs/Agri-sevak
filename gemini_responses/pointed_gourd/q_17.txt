As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, here are the recommended doses for organic manures in Pointed Gourd cultivation in Haryana:

For optimal growth and yield of Pointed Gourd, the following organic manure applications are recommended:

*   **Farmyard Manure (FYM):** Apply 20 tonnes per acre during land preparation, thoroughly incorporating it into the soil.
*   **Vermicompost:** Apply 4-5 tonnes per acre during land preparation, or as a top-dressing in split doses during the crop's growth cycle.
*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract based bio-stimulant):**
    *   **Granular (Soil Application):** Apply **8-10 kg per acre** at the time of planting or as a basal dose.
    *   **Liquid (Foliar Spray):** Mix **2-3 ml per litre** of water and spray at critical growth stages (e.g., vegetative growth, flowering, fruit development). A total of 2-3 sprays are generally beneficial.
