As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned conditions in Pointed Gourd (Parwal) in Haryana:

**1. Scab:**
This is not known to affect Pointed Gourd as a significant or commonly reported disease.

**2. Canker and Gummosis:**
Canker and Gummosis are often symptoms of the same underlying fungal diseases in pointed gourd, primarily Gummy Stem Blight (*Didymella bryoniae* / *Stagonosporopsis cucurbitacearum*) and sometimes Anthracnose (*Colletotrichum orbiculare*). Gummy Stem Blight causes stem cankers, often with a characteristic gummy exudate (gummosis), and can also affect leaves and fruits. Anthracnose causes sunken lesions on stems, leaves, and fruits, which can also be described as cankers.

**Control Measures for Canker and Gummosis (Gummy Stem Blight and Anthracnose):**

**A. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice a 2-3 year crop rotation with non-cucurbit crops to reduce pathogen inoculum in the soil.
*   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris, including leaves, stems, and fruits, immediately after harvest or during the growing season.
*   **Seed Selection:** Use certified disease-free seeds or treat seeds with recommended fungicides.
*   **Spacing and Ventilation:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to promote good air circulation, which helps reduce humidity and fungal growth.
*   **Irrigation Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day, as wet foliage for extended periods favors disease development. Drip irrigation is preferred.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Maintain balanced fertilization to promote vigorous plant growth and enhance natural resistance.

**B. Chemical Control (CIBRC approved technical names):**
For effective control, a combination of protectant and systemic fungicides, applied preventively or at the first sign of symptoms, is recommended. Always rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

*   **For Gummy Stem Blight and Anthracnose:**
    *   **Mancozeb:** Apply 2.0-2.5 kg per acre (or 2.0-2.5 g/L of water) as a foliar spray.
    *   **Chlorothalonil:** Apply 2.0-2.5 kg per acre (or 2.0-2.5 g/L of water) as a foliar spray.
    *   **Azoxystrobin:** Apply 200 ml per acre (or 0.5 ml/L of water) as a foliar spray.
    *   **Difenoconazole:** Apply 200 ml per acre (or 0.5 ml/L of water) as a foliar spray.
    *   **Tebuconazole:** Apply 300-400 ml per acre (or 0.75-1.0 ml/L of water) as a foliar spray.
    *   **Copper Oxychloride:** Apply 1.0-1.2 kg per acre (or 2.5-3.0 g/L of water) as a foliar spray.

**Important Note:** Always read and follow the label instructions for any chemical product regarding dosage, application timing, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and safety precautions.

**3. Lichen:**
This is not known to affect Pointed Gourd as a disease or pest. Lichens are symbiotic organisms that typically grow on the bark of perennial woody plants or other inert surfaces. They are epiphytic and do not parasitize or cause harm to herbaceous plants like pointed gourd. If observed, they are likely growing on support structures or older, senescent parts of the plant and do not require control measures.
