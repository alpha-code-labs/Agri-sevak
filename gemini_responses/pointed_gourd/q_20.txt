Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

Addressing micronutrient deficiencies is crucial for healthy growth and optimal yield in Pointed Gourd (Parwal). As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I strongly recommend conducting a soil test first to accurately identify the specific deficiencies and their severity in your field. This will help in precise application and avoid unnecessary expenses or potential toxicity.

Once deficiencies are confirmed, you can adopt the following strategies:

**General Recommendations:**
*   **Foliar Application:** Often preferred for quick correction, especially for mobile nutrients or when soil conditions limit uptake. Apply sprays during morning or late afternoon hours to avoid leaf scorching and maximize absorption.
*   **Soil Application:** Suitable for long-term correction and severe deficiencies. Incorporate into the soil before planting or as a side-dressing.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management:** Regular addition of organic matter (Farm Yard Manure, compost) significantly improves soil health and micronutrient availability.

Here's how to address specific micronutrient deficiencies in Pointed Gourd:

### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted plant growth, small and narrow leaves, interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, and sometimes a 'rosetting' appearance.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.2-0.5% solution of **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (2-5 g/L of water) or 0.1% solution of **Zinc EDTA** (1 g/L of water). Repeat after 15-20 days if symptoms persist.
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 10-25 kg/acre of **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** as a basal dose before planting or as a side-dressing.

### 2. Iron (Fe) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Prominent interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, which can turn almost white in severe cases, while veins remain green.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.5-1.0% solution of **Ferrous sulphate heptahydrate** (5-10 g/L of water) or 0.1-0.2% solution of **Ferrous EDTA** (1-2 g/L of water). Repeat at 10-15 day intervals until symptoms disappear.
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 20-50 kg/acre of **Ferrous sulphate heptahydrate** or 5-10 kg/acre of **Ferrous EDTA** as a basal dose. Note: Iron availability is often poor in high pH (alkaline) soils common in Haryana, making foliar application more effective.

### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, thickening and cracking of stems, poor fruit set, malformed or cracked fruits, and death of growing points.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.1-0.2% solution of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (1-2 g/L of water) or **Borax** (1-2 g/L of water). Apply at flowering and fruit development stages.
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 2-4 kg/acre of **Borax** or **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** as a basal dose. Be cautious with boron application as excessive amounts can be toxic.

### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, death of growing points, marginal necrosis (browning) of young leaves, and sometimes poor fruit development. While blossom end rot is less common in pointed gourd than in other cucurbits, calcium is vital for cell wall integrity.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.5-1.0% solution of **Calcium nitrate** (5-10 g/L of water). Apply during active growth and fruit development.
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 10-20 kg/acre of **Calcium nitrate** or 200-500 kg/acre of **Gypsum** (Calcium sulphate) if soil test indicates severe deficiency and soil amendment is also required.

### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on older leaves, with veins remaining green. In severe cases, leaves may develop a purplish tint.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.5-1.0% solution of **Magnesium sulphate heptahydrate** (5-10 g/L of water). Repeat after 15-20 days if needed.
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 10-20 kg/acre of **Magnesium sulphate heptahydrate** as a basal dose.

### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, often similar to iron deficiency but sometimes accompanied by small necrotic (dead) spots.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.2-0.5% solution of **Manganese sulphate monohydrate** (2-5 g/L of water) or 0.1% solution of **Manganese EDTA** (1 g/L of water).
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 5-10 kg/acre of **Manganese sulphate monohydrate** as a basal dose.

**Important Note:** Always ensure thorough coverage during foliar sprays. For best results, consult your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts with your soil test report for tailored recommendations.
