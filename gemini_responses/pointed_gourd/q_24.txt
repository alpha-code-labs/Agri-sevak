As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for Pointed Gourd (Parwal) cultivation in Haryana:

### Ideal Transplantation Time, Distance, and Process for Pointed Gourd

Pointed gourd is a perennial, dioecious, and warm-season crop well-suited to the agro-climatic conditions of Haryana.

#### 1. Ideal Transplantation Time

The ideal time for transplanting pointed gourd in Haryana depends on the planting material and desired harvest season:

*   **Spring-Summer Crop:**
    *   **Rooted Cuttings/Seedlings:** February to March, after the danger of frost has completely passed. This allows the plants to establish before the peak summer heat and produce fruits from April-May onwards.
*   **Rainy Season Crop:**
    *   **Rooted Cuttings/Seedlings:** June to July, coinciding with the onset of the monsoon. This planting allows for fruit production during the late rainy season and autumn.

#### 2. Ideal Transplantation Distance

Proper spacing is crucial for vine growth, air circulation, and ease of harvesting.

*   **Pit System (Common for perennial cultivation):**
    *   **Row to Row:** 2.5 - 3 meters
    *   **Pit to Pit (within a row):** 1.5 - 2 meters
*   **Furrow System (Less common for perennial, but can be used):**
    *   **Row to Row:** 2 - 2.5 meters
    *   **Plant to Plant (within a row):** 1 - 1.5 meters

This spacing allows for adequate vine spread, especially when grown on a trellis or pandal system.

#### 3. Ideal Transplantation Process

The transplantation process typically involves using rooted cuttings (vine cuttings) or sometimes seedlings raised in a nursery. Rooted cuttings are generally preferred for faster establishment and genetic purity.

1.  **Preparation of Planting Material:**
    *   **Rooted Cuttings:** Use 15-20 cm long healthy, semi-hardwood vine cuttings with 2-3 nodes. These are usually rooted in polybags or nursery beds for 3-4 weeks before transplanting. Ensure a good root ball has developed.
    *   **Seedlings:** If using seeds, raise seedlings in nursery trays or beds and transplant when they are 3-4 weeks old and have 2-3 true leaves.

2.  **Field Preparation:**
    *   **Land Preparation:** Plough the field thoroughly 2-3 times to achieve a fine tilth. Level the field to ensure uniform irrigation.
    *   **Organic Manure:** Incorporate well-rotted Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost at a rate of 10-15 tonnes per acre during the last ploughing.
    *   **Pit/Furrow Preparation:**
        *   **For Pit System:** Dig pits of size 45 cm x 45 cm x 45 cm at the recommended spacing. Fill each pit with a mixture of topsoil, 5-10 kg of well-rotted FYM, and a small amount of basal fertilizers (e.g., 50 g **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)** and 25 g **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** per pit, mixed thoroughly).
        *   **For Furrow System:** Prepare furrows at the recommended spacing.

3.  **Transplanting:**
    *   **Timing:** Transplant preferably in the late afternoon or on a cloudy day to minimize transplant shock.
    *   **Procedure:**
        *   Carefully remove the rooted cutting or seedling from the polybag/nursery bed, ensuring the root ball remains intact.
        *   Place the plant gently in the center of the prepared pit or furrow.
        *   Ensure the top of the root ball is level with the surrounding soil surface.
        *   Gently firm the soil around the base of the plant to remove air pockets.

4.  **Immediate Post-Transplantation Care:**
    *   **Watering:** Immediately after transplanting, provide light irrigation to settle the soil around the roots.
    *   **Support System:** Pointed gourd is a climbing vine. Plan and install a support system (trellis, pandal, or bamboo stakes) shortly after transplanting to guide the vines upwards and ensure good fruit development and ease of harvesting.

5.  **Weed Management:** Keep the transplanted area free from weeds, especially during the initial establishment phase.
