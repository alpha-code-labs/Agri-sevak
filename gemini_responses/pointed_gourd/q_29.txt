Namaste Kisan Bhai,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding dropping of flowers and fruits in Pointed Gourd (*Parwal*). Please note that "Tinda/Boll dropping" is not a term applicable to Pointed Gourd; "Tinda" refers to Indian Round Gourd, and "Boll" to cotton. However, the principles for preventing flower and fruit drop are relevant to your query.

Flower and fruit dropping in Pointed Gourd is primarily a physiological disorder, often triggered by a combination of environmental stresses, nutritional imbalances, and inadequate pollination. It is crucial to address these underlying causes for effective control.

Here's a scientifically verified approach to control flower and fruit dropping in Pointed Gourd:

**I. Agronomic and Cultural Management (Foundation for prevention):**

1.  **Balanced Nutrition:**
    *   Ensure adequate supply of macro and micronutrients. Deficiencies, especially of Boron and Calcium, are common causes of flower and fruit drop.
    *   Apply recommended doses of NPK fertilizers based on soil test reports.
    *   **Boron:** Crucial for pollen germination, fruit set, and development.
    *   **Calcium:** Essential for cell wall integrity and fruit development.
2.  **Optimal Water Management:**
    *   Both water stress (drought) and waterlogging can lead to dropping.
    *   Maintain consistent soil moisture, especially during flowering and fruiting stages. Irrigate regularly, but avoid over-irrigation.
3.  **Effective Pollination:**
    *   Pointed Gourd is dioecious (male and female flowers on separate plants). Ensure a proper male-to-female plant ratio (typically 10-15% male plants) in your field.
    *   Encourage pollinator activity (e.g., honeybees) by avoiding insecticide sprays during peak flowering times.
    *   For small-scale cultivation or if natural pollination is insufficient, hand pollination can be done by transferring pollen from male flowers to female flowers in the morning.
4.  **Temperature and Humidity Management:**
    *   Extreme temperatures (very high or very low) and sudden fluctuations can cause stress, leading to dropping.
    *   High humidity can sometimes hinder pollen dispersal, while very low humidity can dry out pollen.
5.  **Pest and Disease Control:**
    *   Severe infestation by pests (e.g., fruit flies, borers) or diseases can weaken the plant, indirectly leading to flower and fruit drop. Implement integrated pest and disease management practices.
6.  **Pruning and Training:**
    *   Proper training of vines on trellises or pandals can improve air circulation, light penetration, and reduce stress on the plant, leading to better fruit retention.

**II. Chemical Interventions (CIBRC Approved):**

Once the cultural practices are optimized, specific plant growth regulators and micronutrients can be used to further reduce dropping.

1.  **Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs):**
    *   **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA):** This auxin helps in preventing abscission (dropping) of flowers and young fruits by strengthening the attachment of the fruit to the plant.
        *   **Application:** Spray **Naphthalene Acetic Acid** (e.g., 4.5% SL formulation) at a concentration of 10-20 ppm (parts per million). This typically translates to **0.2-0.4 ml of 4.5% NAA SL per litre of water**.
        *   **Timing:** Apply at the initiation of flowering and repeat after 15-20 days, especially if dropping persists. Ensure thorough coverage of flowers and young fruits.

2.  **Micronutrient Supplementation (Foliar Sprays):**
    *   **Boron:**
        *   **Application:** Spray **Borax** (10.5% Boron) at **1-2 g/L of water** or **Solubor** (20% Boron) at **0.5-1 g/L of water**.
        *   **Timing:** Apply before flowering and again at the early fruit set stage.
    *   **Calcium:**
        *   **Application:** Spray **Calcium Nitrate** (19% Calcium) at **5-10 g/L of water**.
        *   **Timing:** Apply during flowering and early fruit development stages.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read the label instructions of any chemical product before use and follow the recommended dosage and safety precautions.
*   Ensure good spray coverage for effective absorption.
*   The best approach is an integrated one, combining good agronomic practices with targeted chemical interventions when necessary.

By implementing these measures, you should observe a significant reduction in flower and fruit dropping, leading to better yields in your Pointed Gourd crop.
