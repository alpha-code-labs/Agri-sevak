As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling soil pests like termites and root-knot nematodes in Pointed Gourd (Parwal) in Haryana.

Both termites and root-knot nematodes are significant soil-borne pests that can severely impact pointed gourd yield and plant health. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods, is recommended for effective and sustainable control.

### Control of Termites

Termites can cause damage by feeding on roots and underground stems, leading to wilting and plant death.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Ensure proper field sanitation by removing all plant debris, stubble, and wood pieces from the field before planting.
    *   Avoid leaving organic matter like undecomposed farmyard manure (FYM) in direct contact with planting pits, as it can attract termites.
    *   Deep ploughing during summer can expose termite colonies to predators and sunlight, reducing their population.

*   **Chemical Control (Pre-planting / At planting):**
    *   **Soil Treatment:**
        *   Apply **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** at 2.5 litres per acre mixed with 500-1000 litres of water and drench the soil before planting or at the time of planting in the furrows/pits.
        *   Alternatively, apply **Fipronil 0.3% GR** at 6-8 kg per acre by broadcasting and incorporating into the soil before planting.

### Control of Nematodes (Root-knot Nematodes)

Root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.) are microscopic worms that infect plant roots, causing galls or knots, leading to stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, reduced yield, and increased susceptibility to other diseases.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate pointed gourd with non-host crops like cereals (wheat, maize, sorghum) or marigold (Tagetes spp.) which have nematicidal properties. Avoid continuous cultivation of susceptible crops.
    *   **Summer Ploughing:** Deep ploughing during hot summer months exposes nematode eggs and larvae to high temperatures and sunlight, reducing their population.
    *   **Solarization:** Cover the moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks during peak summer to raise soil temperature and kill nematodes.
    *   **Organic Matter Incorporation:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM), compost, or neem cake (200-400 kg/acre) into the soil. Neem cake has nematicidal properties and enhances beneficial microbial activity.
    *   **Resistant Varieties:** If available and suitable for your region, choose pointed gourd varieties known for resistance or tolerance to root-knot nematodes.

*   **Biological Control:**
    *   Apply bio-nematicides containing beneficial fungi like **Paecilomyces lilacinus** or **Purpureocillium lilacinum** (e.g., 2-4 kg/acre) mixed with well-decomposed FYM or compost and apply to the soil before planting or at the time of planting. These fungi parasitize nematode eggs and females.

*   **Chemical Control (At planting / Post-planting):**
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   Apply **Carbofuran 3% G** at 10-13 kg per acre by broadcasting and incorporating into the soil at the time of planting or as a side-dressing after planting.
        *   Alternatively, apply **Fluensulfone 2% GR** at 10-15 kg per acre by broadcasting and incorporating into the soil before planting or at the time of planting.
        *   Another option is **Cadusafos 10% GR** at 4-6 kg per acre, applied as a soil incorporation before planting or at planting.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the product label for dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) while handling chemicals.
*   Consult your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and the latest CIBRC approved products and dosages.
