Mites, including Red spider mite (*Tetranychus urticae*) and Rust mite (*Aculops lycopersici* or other eriophyid mites), are significant pests of Pointed Gourd in Haryana, causing considerable damage if not managed effectively. As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend an integrated approach for their control.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Mites in Pointed Gourd:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Regular Monitoring:** Frequently inspect the underside of leaves for mite presence, webbing (red spider mite), or bronzing/russeting (rust mite). Early detection is crucial.
    *   **Weed Management:** Remove weeds in and around the field, as they can act as alternate hosts for mites.
    *   **Proper Irrigation:** Maintain adequate soil moisture. Dusty conditions favor mite multiplication. Overhead irrigation can sometimes help dislodge mites, but be mindful of fungal disease risks.
    *   **Pruning:** Remove severely infested leaves or plant parts during early stages of infestation to reduce pest load.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Avoid indiscriminate use of broad-spectrum insecticides that harm natural predators like predatory mites (*Amblyseius* spp.), ladybird beetles, and lacewings, which naturally feed on pest mites.

3.  **Chemical Control (Acaricides):**
    When mite populations reach damaging levels, chemical intervention with CIBRC-approved acaricides is necessary. Always ensure thorough coverage, especially on the underside of leaves where mites primarily reside. Rotate different groups of acaricides to prevent resistance development.

    Here are some CIBRC-approved technical chemical names effective against mites in cucurbits:

    *   **For Red Spider Mite and Rust Mite:**
        *   **Abamectin 1.9% EC:** Apply at a rate of **0.4 - 0.5 ml per liter of water**. It has translaminar action, providing control on both sides of the leaf.
        *   **Fenpyroximate 5% EC:** Apply at a rate of **0.75 - 1.0 ml per liter of water**. It is effective against various mite stages.

    *   **Primarily for Red Spider Mite:**
        *   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** Apply at a rate of **0.5 ml per liter of water**. It is effective against all developmental stages of mites.
        *   **Propargite 57% EC:** Apply at a rate of **2.5 - 3.0 ml per liter of water**. This is a widely used and effective acaricide for spider mites.

    *   **Primarily for Rust Mite (and also suppresses spider mites):**
        *   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP:** Apply at a rate of **3.0 - 5.0 grams per liter of water**. It is an economical option, particularly effective against rust mites, and also has fungicidal properties. Avoid application during very hot weather (above 30-32°C) as it can cause phytotoxicity.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Rotation:** Always rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in mite populations.
*   **Thorough Coverage:** Mites are often found on the underside of leaves. Ensure the spray solution thoroughly covers all plant parts, especially the undersides of leaves.
*   **Repeat Application:** Mite control often requires repeat applications at recommended intervals, especially during severe infestations, as acaricides may not kill all life stages (e.g., eggs).
*   **Safety:** Always read and follow the instructions on the product label, including dosage, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and safety precautions (wearing protective gear).
*   **Consult Local Experts:** For specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions, always consult with local agricultural extension officers or HAU experts.
