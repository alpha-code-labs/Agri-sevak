As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following cultivation practices for Pointed Gourd (*Trichosanthes dioica*) in Haryana:

Pointed gourd is primarily propagated vegetatively due to issues with seed germination, variability in fruit quality, and an undesirable male-to-female plant ratio when propagated by seeds. Therefore, the recommendations below focus on vegetative propagation, which is the standard and most effective method.

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   **Primary Method (Vegetative Propagation):** Pointed gourd is predominantly propagated using hardened stem cuttings or root suckers.
        *   **Vine Cuttings:** Select healthy, mature, pencil-thick stem cuttings, 15-20 cm long, having 3-5 nodes. These can be planted directly in the field or rooted in nursery beds/polybags before transplanting.
        *   **Root Suckers:** Healthy root suckers can also be used for propagation.
    *   **Planting Pattern:** Cuttings or suckers are typically planted in pits or on raised beds/ridges. For commercial cultivation, a trellis system is highly recommended for better yield, fruit quality, and ease of harvesting.
    *   **Seed Propagation (Not Recommended for Commercial Cultivation):** While possible, seed propagation is generally not recommended for commercial purposes due to poor germination, genetic variability, and the challenge of maintaining an optimal male-to-female plant ratio. If seeds were to be used (e.g., for breeding), they would typically be sown in nursery beds and seedlings transplanted.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   **For Vine Cuttings/Root Suckers:** Plant the cuttings or suckers at a depth of 15-20 cm, ensuring that at least 2-3 nodes are buried in the soil. This promotes better rooting and establishment.
    *   **For Seeds (if used):** If seeds are used, they should be sown at a shallow depth of 1-2 cm.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   Spacing depends on the training system adopted. A trellis system is highly recommended for optimal growth and yield.
    *   **For Trellis System:**
        *   Row to Row: 2.5 - 3.0 meters
        *   Plant to Plant: 2.0 - 2.5 meters
    *   **In Pits:** If planting in pits, 2-3 cuttings/suckers are typically planted per pit.
    *   **Male-Female Ratio:** It is crucial to maintain an appropriate male to female plant ratio for effective pollination. A ratio of approximately 1 male plant for every 10-15 female plants is generally recommended.

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   As Pointed Gourd is primarily propagated vegetatively, there is no standard "seed dose" recommended for commercial cultivation.
    *   **Equivalent for Vegetative Propagation:** Approximately 1600-2000 healthy vine cuttings or root suckers are required per acre, depending on the specific spacing adopted.
