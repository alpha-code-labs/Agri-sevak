As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling sucking pests (Aphids, Leafhopper, Whitefly, Thrips, and Psylla) in Pointed Gourd (Parwal) in Haryana. These pests can cause significant damage by sucking sap, leading to stunted growth, leaf curling, reduced yield, and transmission of viral diseases.

An Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is recommended for effective and sustainable control.

### Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategy

**1. Cultural Control Measures:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Regularly remove weeds from and around the field, as they can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-cucurbit crops to break the pest life cycle.
*   **Optimum Plant Spacing:** Ensure proper plant spacing to allow for good air circulation, which can reduce pest build-up.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, as it can lead to lush, soft growth that is more attractive to sucking pests. Maintain balanced nutrition.
*   **Water Management:** Provide adequate and timely irrigation to keep plants healthy and more tolerant to pest damage.
*   **Use of Yellow Sticky Traps:** Install yellow sticky traps (10-15 traps per acre) at canopy height to monitor and trap adult whiteflies, aphids, and leafhoppers.

**2. Biological Control Measures:**
*   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Encourage the presence of natural predators like ladybird beetles, lacewings, hoverflies, and parasitic wasps (e.g., *Encarsia formosa* for whiteflies), which feed on or parasitize these sucking pests. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.
*   **Biopesticides:** Consider using neem-based formulations (e.g., Azadirachtin 1500 ppm or 3000 ppm) at early stages of infestation. These act as antifeedants and growth regulators. Apply at a rate of 2-5 ml/L of water.

**3. Chemical Control Measures (As a Last Resort):**
When pest populations reach economic threshold levels and cultural/biological methods are insufficient, chemical control may be necessary. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Apply sprays preferably in the evening or early morning.

**For effective control of Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, Thrips, and Psylla, consider the following CIBRC approved technical chemicals:**

*   **For broad-spectrum control of Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, Thrips, and Psylla:**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at a rate of 0.5 - 0.75 ml per litre of water (or 100 - 125 ml per acre).
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at a rate of 0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water (or 50 - 100 g per acre).
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply at a rate of 0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water (or 50 - 100 g per acre).

*   **For specific control of Whiteflies and Thrips, and for resistance management:**
    *   **Diafenthiuron 50% WP:** Apply at a rate of 1.0 - 1.2 g per litre of water (or 400 - 600 g per acre). This chemical also has some miticidal activity.
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Primarily effective against whitefly nymphs and hoppers by inhibiting chitin synthesis. Apply at a rate of 1.25 - 1.5 ml per litre of water (or 500 - 600 ml per acre).

**General Precautions:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully, including dosage, application method, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, and protective clothing during mixing and spraying.
*   Avoid spraying during flowering to protect pollinators. If spraying is essential, do it in the late evening when pollinators are less active.
*   Ensure thorough coverage of the plant, especially the undersides of leaves where many sucking pests reside.
*   Consult your local Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or HAU extension specialist for the most current recommendations and specific pest situations in your area.
