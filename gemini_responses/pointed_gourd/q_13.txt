As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in Pointed Gourd in Haryana:

### Control of Fruit Fly in Pointed Gourd

Fruit fly (*Bactrocera cucurbitae*) is a major pest of Pointed Gourd and other cucurbits, causing significant damage by laying eggs in young fruits, leading to rotting and fruit drop.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategies are recommended:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Regularly collect and destroy all fallen, damaged, or infested fruits by burying them deep in the soil or burning them. This breaks the life cycle of the pest.
    *   **Deep Ploughing:** After harvest, deep ploughing helps expose and kill pupae in the soil.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid continuous cultivation of cucurbit crops in the same field.

2.  **Mechanical Methods:**
    *   **Fruit Bagging:** For small-scale cultivation, individual fruits can be covered with paper or cloth bags to prevent egg-laying.

3.  **Pheromone Traps:**
    *   Install **Cuelure** pheromone traps at a density of 5-10 traps per acre. These traps attract and kill male fruit flies, reducing the population and disrupting mating. Replace the lure every 2-3 weeks.

4.  **Bait Sprays:**
    *   Prepare bait sprays by mixing an insecticide with a food attractant (like jaggery or protein hydrolysate). Apply these baits as small droplets on leaves (not directly on fruits) or on non-crop plants around the field, preferably in the morning.
    *   **Option 1:** Mix **Malathion** 50 EC at 2 ml/L of water with 10 g/L of jaggery or molasses.
    *   **Option 2:** Mix **Spinosad** 45 SC at 0.25 ml/L of water with 10 g/L of jaggery or molasses.

5.  **Chemical Sprays (as a last resort for severe infestations):**
    *   If infestation is high and other methods are insufficient, apply insecticides during the fruit development stage, ensuring proper coverage. Always observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI).
    *   **Option 1:** Spray **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5 EC at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Option 2:** Spray **Deltamethrin** 2.8 EC at 1 ml/L of water.

### Control of Ber Fly in Pointed Gourd

This is not known to affect Pointed Gourd. Ber fly (*Carpomyia vesuviana*) is a specific pest of Ber (Jujube) and does not infest cucurbit crops like Pointed Gourd.
