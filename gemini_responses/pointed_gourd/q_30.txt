As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for managing growth issues in Pointed Gourd (Parwal) in Haryana:

It is crucial to conduct a soil test before applying any fertilizers or micronutrients to accurately diagnose deficiencies and avoid imbalances.

### Management of Growth Issues in Pointed Gourd:

#### 1. Slow Growth:
Slow growth is often indicative of nutrient deficiencies, poor soil health, or suboptimal environmental conditions.

*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Soil Testing:** Essential to determine specific nutrient deficiencies (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, Micronutrients).
    *   **Balanced Fertilization:** Apply NPK fertilizers as per soil test recommendations. A general recommendation for Pointed Gourd is 80-100 kg Nitrogen, 60 kg Phosphorus, and 60 kg Potassium per acre, applied in splits.
        *   For Nitrogen: Apply **Urea** (46% N) at 40-50 kg/acre as basal, and the remaining in 2-3 splits during vegetative growth.
        *   For Phosphorus: Apply **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5) at 130 kg/acre or **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5) at 375 kg/acre as basal.
        *   For Potassium: Apply **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** (60% K2O) at 100 kg/acre as basal.
    *   **Micronutrient Application:** If soil test indicates deficiency:
        *   **Zinc:** Apply **Zinc sulphate** (21% Zn) at 10 kg/acre as soil application or 5 g/L as foliar spray.
        *   **Iron:** Apply **Ferrous sulphate** (19% Fe) at 10 kg/acre as soil application or 5 g/L as foliar spray.
*   **Soil Health Improvement:**
    *   Incorporate well-decomposed Farmyard Manure (FYM) or compost at 8-10 tonnes/acre during land preparation to improve soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability.
*   **Water Management:** Ensure adequate and timely irrigation, especially during dry spells. Avoid both water stress and waterlogging.
*   **Weed Control:** Regularly remove weeds to reduce competition for nutrients and water.

#### 2. Yellow Growth (Chlorosis):
Yellowing of leaves (chlorosis) is a common symptom of nutrient deficiencies, particularly Nitrogen, Iron, Zinc, or Magnesium.

*   **Diagnosis:** Observe the pattern of yellowing (e.g., older vs. younger leaves, interveinal vs. general) and confirm with a soil test.
*   **Specific Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Nitrogen Deficiency (General yellowing, older leaves first):**
        *   Foliar spray of **Urea** (10-15 g/L) at weekly intervals until recovery.
        *   Soil application of **Urea** as per recommendations.
    *   **Iron Deficiency (Interveinal chlorosis, younger leaves):**
        *   Foliar spray of **Ferrous sulphate** (5 g/L) mixed with citric acid (2.5 g/L) to enhance absorption. Repeat at 7-10 day intervals if needed.
        *   Soil application of **Ferrous sulphate** at 10 kg/acre in severe cases.
    *   **Zinc Deficiency (Interveinal chlorosis, stunted growth, younger leaves):**
        *   Foliar spray of **Zinc sulphate** (5 g/L). Repeat after 10-15 days if necessary.
        *   Soil application of **Zinc sulphate** at 10 kg/acre.
    *   **Magnesium Deficiency (Interveinal chlorosis, older leaves):**
        *   Foliar spray of **Magnesium sulphate** (5 g/L). Repeat after 10-15 days if necessary.
*   **Drainage:** If waterlogging is causing root damage and nutrient uptake issues, improve field drainage.

#### 3. Excessive Height (Leggy Growth):
Excessive vegetative growth at the expense of fruiting is often due to high nitrogen levels or insufficient light.

*   **Training and Pruning:**
    *   **Trellising:** Pointed Gourd is a vine crop and should be trained on a trellis, pandal, or wire system to support growth, improve light penetration, and facilitate harvesting.
    *   **Pinching:** Pinching the terminal growing points of main vines can encourage lateral branching and fruit production.
    *   **Pruning:** Regularly remove old, diseased, or unproductive branches and excessive vegetative growth to redirect energy towards fruit development.
*   **Nutrient Balance:**
    *   Avoid excessive application of Nitrogen fertilizers, which promotes vegetative growth.
    *   Ensure adequate levels of Phosphorus and Potassium, which are crucial for flowering and fruiting.

#### 4. Excessive Flowering (but poor fruit set/development):
Excessive flowering, especially if accompanied by poor fruit set or development, indicates nutrient imbalances or stress.

*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Micronutrients for Flowering and Fruiting:** Ensure adequate supply of Boron and Zinc, which are critical for pollen viability, fertilization, and fruit development.
        *   **Boron:** Foliar spray of **Borax** (10.5% B) at 2 g/L or **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (20.5% B) at 1 g/L at pre-flowering and fruit set stages.
        *   **Zinc:** Foliar spray of **Zinc sulphate** (5 g/L) at pre-flowering stage.
    *   **Balanced NPK:** Ensure optimal NPK ratios. High nitrogen can sometimes lead to excessive vegetative growth at the expense of reproductive growth, while adequate P and K are essential for flowering and fruiting.
*   **Pollination Management:**
    *   **Male Plants:** Pointed Gourd is dioecious (separate male and female plants). Ensure a sufficient number of male plants (typically 1 male plant for every 10-15 female plants) for effective pollination.
    *   **Pollinator Activity:** Encourage natural pollinators like bees by avoiding insecticide sprays during flowering hours.
*   **Water Management:** Maintain consistent soil moisture during flowering and fruit development. Water stress can lead to flower drop.
*   **Temperature:** Protect plants from extreme temperatures (both very high and very low) during flowering, as these can negatively impact pollen viability and fruit set.
