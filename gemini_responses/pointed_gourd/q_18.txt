As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified recommendations for the use of growth regulators and essential micronutrients in Pointed Gourd (Parwal) in Haryana:

*   **Ethephon**
    *   **Purpose:** To promote female flower production, leading to increased fruit set and yield.
    *   **Recommended Dose:** Foliar spray of **Ethephon** (39% SL formulation) at **0.5-0.7 ml per liter of water**.
    *   **Application Timing:** Apply at the 2-4 true leaf stage, and repeat after 7-10 days if needed, ensuring thorough coverage of the foliage.

*   **2,4-D**
    *   While 2,4-D is a synthetic auxin, its primary use in agriculture is as a selective herbicide. Its application as a growth regulator in Pointed Gourd is not a recommended practice in Haryana due to the extremely narrow margin between hormonal and herbicidal concentrations, posing a high risk of phytotoxicity and crop damage. There are no established recommendations for its beneficial use as a growth regulator in this crop.

*   **Boron**
    *   **Purpose:** Boron is an essential micronutrient crucial for pollen germination, pollen tube growth, cell wall formation, and overall fruit development. Boron deficiency can lead to poor fruit set, flower drop, and malformed fruits.
    *   **Recommended Dose:** Foliar spray of **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate, containing 11.3% Boron) at **1-2 grams per liter of water** (0.1-0.2% solution).
    *   **Application Timing:** Apply at the pre-flowering stage and again at the early fruit set stage to ensure adequate availability during critical reproductive phases.
