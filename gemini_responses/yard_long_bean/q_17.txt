As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following doses of organic manures and bio-stimulants for Yard Long Bean cultivation in Haryana, based on scientific principles and local conditions:

**1. Farm Yard Manure (FYM):**
*   **Dose:** 10-15 tonnes per acre.
*   **Application:** Incorporate thoroughly into the soil during land preparation, at least 2-3 weeks before sowing or transplanting. This provides a broad spectrum of nutrients and improves soil structure and water retention.

**2. Vermicompost:**
*   **Dose:** 2-3 tonnes per acre.
*   **Application:** Can be applied basally during land preparation, similar to FYM, or as a top dressing around the plants at critical growth stages (e.g., flowering, pod development) to provide a steady supply of readily available nutrients.

**3. Sagarika (Seaweed Extract based bio-stimulant):**
*   **Dose:**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** 2.5-5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Soil Drench/Drip Irrigation:** 500 ml per acre.
*   **Application:**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Apply at critical growth stages such as vegetative growth, pre-flowering, and during pod development. Typically, 2-3 sprays are recommended at 15-20 day intervals.
    *   **Soil Drench/Drip Irrigation:** Apply during early vegetative growth and repeat during flowering/fruiting stages.
*   **Note:** While FYM and Vermicompost are bulk organic manures, **Sagarika** is a concentrated seaweed extract-based bio-stimulant that enhances plant growth, nutrient uptake, and stress tolerance. It complements the nutrient supply from FYM and Vermicompost.
