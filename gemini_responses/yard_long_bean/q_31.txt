As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling physical damage in Yard Long Bean (Vigna unguiculata subsp. sesquipedalis) under Haryana conditions:

### Control of Physical Damage in Yard Long Bean

**1. Fruit Bursting (Cracking)**

Fruit bursting is primarily a physiological disorder often linked to inconsistent moisture supply and nutrient imbalances.

*   **Irrigation Management:**
    *   Maintain consistent soil moisture throughout the growing season, especially during fruit development.
    *   Avoid sudden fluctuations between dry spells and heavy irrigation or rainfall, which can lead to rapid water uptake and fruit expansion, causing the skin to crack.
    *   Consider drip irrigation for precise and uniform water delivery.
*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Ensure adequate supply of Calcium and Boron, which are crucial for cell wall integrity and elasticity.
    *   **Calcium Application:**
        *   Foliar spray: Apply **Calcium Nitrate** at 5-10 g/L of water (0.5-1.0% solution) during the fruit development stage. Repeat every 10-15 days if symptoms persist or are anticipated.
        *   Soil application: Based on soil test recommendations, apply **Calcium Nitrate** or gypsum (Calcium Sulfate) as a basal dose or side dressing.
    *   **Boron Application:**
        *   Foliar spray: Apply **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** at 1-2 g/L of water (0.1-0.2% solution) at flowering and early fruit set stages.
        *   Soil application: Based on soil test, apply **Borax** at 10-15 kg/acre as a basal application before sowing.
*   **Mulching:**
    *   Apply organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves) around the base of plants to help conserve soil moisture, regulate soil temperature, and reduce moisture fluctuations.
*   **Variety Selection:**
    *   If possible, choose varieties known to be less susceptible to fruit cracking.

**2. Leaf Burning/Melting**

Leaf burning or melting can be caused by various environmental stresses or improper agricultural practices.

*   **Heat and Sun Stress:**
    *   Provide partial shade during the peak summer months (April-June) when temperatures are very high, especially for young plants. This can be achieved using shade nets (25-30% shade).
    *   Ensure adequate and timely irrigation to prevent water stress, which exacerbates heat damage.
*   **Chemical Burn:**
    *   Always follow the recommended dosage and application instructions for all pesticides, herbicides, and foliar fertilizers.
    *   Avoid spraying during the hottest part of the day or when the sun is intense, as this can increase the risk of phytotoxicity. Spraying in the early morning or late evening is preferable.
    *   Ensure proper calibration of spray equipment.
*   **Waterlogging/Root Stress:**
    *   Ensure good soil drainage to prevent waterlogging, which can damage roots and impair water uptake, leading to leaf wilting and subsequent burning.
    *   Avoid over-irrigation.
*   **Salinity:**
    *   If soil or irrigation water salinity is an issue, use good quality irrigation water.
    *   Adopt practices like leaching with good quality water and incorporating organic matter or gypsum (Calcium Sulfate) to improve soil structure and reduce salinity effects.
*   **Nutrient Toxicity:**
    *   Adhere strictly to recommended fertilizer application rates based on soil tests to avoid nutrient toxicities.

**3. Hardness in Fruit**

Hardness in Yard Long Bean fruits is primarily a post-maturity issue and is not typically controlled by chemical means.

*   **Timely Harvesting:**
    *   This is the most critical control measure. Harvest pods when they are young, tender, succulent, and before the seeds fully develop and become prominent.
    *   Delaying harvest allows the pods to mature, accumulate more fiber, and become tough and hard.
    *   Harvesting should be done frequently, typically every 2-3 days, depending on the variety and growing conditions.
*   **Consistent Irrigation:**
    *   Maintain adequate and consistent soil moisture to promote continuous, tender growth of pods. Water stress can accelerate maturity and lead to premature hardening.
*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Ensure balanced nutrition for overall plant health, which supports the production of tender fruits.
*   **Variety Selection:**
    *   Some varieties may naturally become fibrous faster than others. Choose varieties known for their tenderness and extended harvest window.
