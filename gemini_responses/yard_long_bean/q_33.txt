As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an integrated weed management approach for Yard Long Bean (Vigna unguiculata subsp. sesquipedalis) to effectively control the mentioned weeds. This involves a combination of cultural practices and judicious use of CIBRC-approved herbicides.

**I. Cultural and Mechanical Methods:**

*   **Field Preparation:** Thorough land preparation, including deep ploughing and harrowing, helps in reducing the initial weed seed bank.
*   **Clean Seeds:** Always use certified, weed-free seeds to prevent the introduction of new weed species.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Maintain optimal plant spacing to allow for better crop growth and canopy closure, which can naturally suppress weed growth.
*   **Manual Weeding/Hoeing:** One or two manual weedings at 20-25 and 40-45 days after sowing are highly effective for controlling broadleaf weeds, narrowleaf weeds, and parasitic weeds like Amarbail. This is often the most reliable method for sensitive crops like Yard Long Bean.
*   **Inter-cultivation:** Shallow inter-cultivation between rows can control young weeds and improve soil aeration.

**II. Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved Herbicides for Haryana):**

**A. For Broadleaf Weeds (e.g., Bathu, Congress grass) and Narrowleaf Weeds (e.g., Phalaris minor, other grasses):**

*   **Pre-emergence Application:**
    *   Apply within 0-3 days after sowing (DAS) to a moist soil surface. Ensure uniform coverage.
    *   **Pendimethalin** 30% EC at 3.3 litres per acre, mixed in 200-250 litres of water. This provides good control of germinating broadleaf and narrowleaf weeds. It also offers some suppression against Amarbail.

**B. For Narrowleaf Weeds (Grasses like Phalaris minor):**

*   **Post-emergence Application:**
    *   If grassy weeds emerge after the pre-emergence application, or if pre-emergence application was missed, a selective post-emergence graminicide can be used when weeds are at the 2-4 leaf stage (typically 20-30 DAS).
    *   **Quizalofop-ethyl** 10% EC at 400 ml per acre, mixed in 200-250 litres of water.
    *   **Fenoxaprop-p-ethyl** 10% EC at 250 ml per acre, mixed in 200-250 litres of water.

**C. Specific Weed Management:**

*   **Amarbail (Cuscuta spp.):**
    *   **Prevention:** Use clean seeds and prevent the introduction of Amarbail seeds into the field.
    *   **Pre-emergence:** **Pendimethalin** application as mentioned above can offer some initial suppression of germinating Amarbail seeds.
    *   **Manual Removal:** The most effective method is to manually remove and destroy Amarbail patches as soon as they are observed, before they spread and produce seeds. This is critical to prevent its proliferation.
*   **Orobanche (Broomrape):**
    *   This is not known to be a primary host for severe Orobanche infestation in Haryana, and specific chemical control is not widely recommended or effective in Yard Long Bean without significant crop damage.
    *   **Cultural Practices:** Focus on crop rotation with non-host crops, deep ploughing, and manual removal of Orobanche spikes before seed setting if observed.
*   **Bathu (Chenopodium album) and Congress grass (Parthenium hysterophorus):**
    *   These are broadleaf weeds effectively controlled by the pre-emergence application of **Pendimethalin** and subsequent manual weeding.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always ensure uniform spray coverage.
*   Use appropriate spray nozzles (flat fan nozzle for herbicides).
*   Read and strictly follow the label instructions of the herbicide carefully for dosage, application timing, and safety precautions.
*   Avoid spraying herbicides during windy conditions to prevent drift.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension specialists for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and soil type.
