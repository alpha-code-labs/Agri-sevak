Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon, as a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU), Hisar, I understand the challenges posed by environmental stresses on your Yard Long Bean (Lobia) crop. Yard Long Bean is a warm-season crop, and extreme weather conditions can significantly impact its growth and yield. Here's scientifically verified advice to protect your crop:

### 1. Protection from Extreme Cold and Frost

Yard Long Bean is highly sensitive to cold temperatures and frost. Even mild frost can cause severe damage.

*   **Adjust Sowing Time:** The most effective strategy is to avoid planting during periods when frost is likely. In Haryana, this typically means avoiding sowing that would lead to the crop being in its sensitive stages during December-January. Optimal sowing times are generally February-March (spring) or June-July (monsoon).
*   **Site Selection:** Choose fields that are naturally sheltered from cold winds, or consider planting windbreaks (e.g., taller crops like mustard or wheat on the northern side) if possible.
*   **Mulching:** Apply a thick layer (5-10 cm) of organic mulch such as straw, dry leaves, or crop residues around the base of the plants. This insulates the soil, retains warmth, and protects the root zone from freezing.
*   **Irrigation:** A light irrigation before a predicted frost event can slightly raise the soil temperature and increase humidity around the plants, which can reduce frost damage. Ensure the soil is moist, not waterlogged.
*   **Protective Covers:** For young plants or during unexpected cold snaps, use temporary covers. You can use plastic sheets, agro-textile covers (row covers), or even straw/grass to cover the plants overnight. Ensure these covers are removed during the day to allow sunlight and air circulation.

### 2. Protection from Heat (Loo) and Intense Sunlight

Yard Long Bean thrives in warm conditions but extreme heat (above 38-40°C), hot dry winds (Loo), and intense sunlight can cause flower drop, poor pod set, leaf scorching, and wilting.

*   **Sowing Time and Variety Selection:** If planting during periods that might experience high temperatures, select heat-tolerant varieties. Adjust sowing schedules to avoid the peak of summer heat if possible.
*   **Irrigation Management:** Maintain consistent and adequate soil moisture, especially during the critical flowering and pod development stages. Frequent, light irrigation during hot periods can help cool the plant canopy and prevent water stress. Drip irrigation is highly efficient.
*   **Mulching:** Organic mulch helps conserve soil moisture, reduces soil temperature fluctuations, and suppresses weeds, all of which contribute to better heat tolerance.
*   **Shade Nets:** During periods of extreme heat and intense sunlight, providing partial shade can significantly reduce stress. Using 25-35% shade nets over the crop can prevent leaf scorching, reduce flower drop, and improve pod setting.
*   **Windbreaks:** Plant taller crops (e.g., maize, sorghum) or erect physical barriers on the windward side of the field to reduce the direct impact of hot, dry winds (Loo), which can desiccate plants rapidly.
*   **Foliar Sprays:**
    *   **Kaolin clay:** Spraying a 5% solution of **Kaolin clay** (50 g/L of water) can create a reflective white film on the leaves. This reflects sunlight, reduces leaf temperature, and protects against sun scorching. Apply during periods of intense heat and sunlight, repeating every 10-15 days as needed.
    *   **Potassium nitrate:** A foliar spray of 1-2% **Potassium nitrate** (10-20 g/L of water) can enhance the plant's ability to cope with heat stress by improving water use efficiency and osmoregulation. Apply during the pre-flowering and early pod development stages to help reduce flower drop and improve pod set under stress.

By implementing these practices, you can significantly mitigate the adverse effects of environmental stresses and ensure a healthier, more productive Yard Long Bean crop.
