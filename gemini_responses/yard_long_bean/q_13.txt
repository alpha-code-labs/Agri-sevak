As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in Yard Long Bean in Haryana.

### Control of Fruit Fly in Yard Long Bean

Fruit flies, particularly the Melon Fruit Fly (*Bactrocera cucurbitae*), can be a significant pest of Yard Long Bean, as they lay eggs in the developing pods, leading to maggot infestation and damage. An Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is recommended.

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Methods:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Regularly collect and destroy all infested, fallen, or damaged pods by burying them deep in the soil or burning them. This breaks the life cycle of the pest.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** After harvest, deep ploughing helps expose pupae in the soil to predators and adverse weather conditions.
*   **Bagging:** For small-scale cultivation, individual pods can be covered with paper or cloth bags to prevent egg-laying.
*   **Pheromone Traps:** Install specific fruit fly pheromone traps (e.g., Cue-lure traps) at a density of 10-12 traps per acre. Replace the lure every 2-3 weeks. These traps help monitor the pest population and can also reduce male populations.

**2. Chemical Control (as part of IPM):**
When pest incidence is high, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always follow label instructions and observe pre-harvest intervals (PHI).

*   **Bait Sprays:** These are highly effective for fruit fly control.
    *   Prepare a bait solution by mixing 100 g of jaggery (gur) or protein hydrolysate with 10 L of water. Add 20 ml of **Malathion 50% EC** (containing the technical chemical **Malathion**) to this solution.
    *   Spray this bait solution in small patches (e.g., 50 ml per patch) on the foliage, preferably on non-bearing leaves, at 7-10 day intervals, especially during morning hours.
    *   Alternatively, use **Spinosad 45% SC** (containing the technical chemical **Spinosad**) at 0.25 ml/L mixed with 10 g/L jaggery or protein hydrolysate as a spot spray.

*   **Foliar Sprays (if bait sprays are insufficient):**
    *   Spray with **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC** (containing the technical chemical **Lambda-cyhalothrin**) at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, use **Deltamethrin 2.8% EC** (containing the technical chemical **Deltamethrin**) at 1.0 ml/L of water.
    *   Another option is **Cyantraniliprole 10.26% OD** (containing the technical chemical **Cyantraniliprole**) at 1.8 ml/L of water.

### Control of Ber Fly in Yard Long Bean

This is not known to affect Yard Long Bean. The Ber fruit fly (*Carpomyia vesuviana*) is a specific pest of Ber (*Ziziphus mauritiana*) and does not infest Yard Long Bean.
