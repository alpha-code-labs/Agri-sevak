As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the suitable climate, soil type, and drainage requirements for Yard Long Bean (Vigna unguiculata subsp. sesquipedalis) in Haryana:

### Climate Requirements:

*   **Temperature:** Yard Long Bean is a warm-season crop that thrives in tropical and subtropical climates.
    *   **Optimal Temperature:** 25-35°C.
    *   **Minimum Temperature:** Growth is severely hampered below 15°C.
    *   **Maximum Temperature:** Can tolerate temperatures up to 40°C, but extreme heat can affect pod set and quality.
*   **Rainfall:** Requires moderate rainfall.
    *   **Annual Rainfall:** 600-1200 mm, well-distributed throughout the growing season, is ideal.
    *   **Irrigation:** Essential during dry spells, especially during flowering and pod development, which is common in Haryana's climate.
*   **Humidity:** Prefers moderate to high humidity.
*   **Sunlight:** Requires full sun exposure for optimal growth and yield, typically 6-8 hours of direct sunlight per day.
*   **Suitability for Haryana:** Well-suited for the kharif (monsoon) and late summer/early autumn seasons in Haryana, where temperatures are warm and conducive to its growth.

### Soil Type Requirements:

*   **Texture:** Yard Long Bean performs best in a wide range of well-drained soils.
    *   **Ideal:** Sandy loam to loamy soils are preferred.
    *   **Avoid:** Heavy clay soils that are prone to waterlogging.
*   **pH Level:**
    *   **Optimal pH:** Slightly acidic to neutral, with a range of 6.0 to 7.5.
    *   **Tolerance:** Can tolerate a slightly wider range but yields may be affected outside the optimal.
*   **Organic Matter:** Rich in organic matter is highly beneficial for good soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability.
*   **Nutrient Status:** Requires fertile soil. While it is a legume and fixes atmospheric nitrogen, initial nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium are crucial for establishment and vigorous growth.

### Drainage Requirements:

*   **Importance:** Excellent drainage is paramount for Yard Long Bean cultivation.
    *   **Waterlogging:** The crop is highly sensitive to waterlogging. Standing water, even for short periods, can lead to root rot, nutrient deficiency, stunted growth, and ultimately plant death.
*   **Achieving Good Drainage:**
    *   **Soil Structure:** Ensure the soil has a good crumbly structure to allow for proper water infiltration and aeration.
    *   **Raised Beds:** In areas with heavy soils or a high water table, cultivation on raised beds (15-30 cm high) is highly recommended to prevent waterlogging around the root zone.
    *   **Site Selection:** Choose fields that do not accumulate water during heavy rains.
    *   **Irrigation Management:** Apply irrigation judiciously, avoiding overwatering, and ensuring excess water can drain away freely.
