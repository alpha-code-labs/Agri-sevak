As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following for the ideal transplantation of Yard Long Bean in Haryana:

### Ideal Transplantation Time

Yard Long Bean is a warm-season crop and thrives in hot, humid conditions. Transplantation should be avoided during periods of frost or extreme cold.

*   **Spring-Summer Crop:** February to March (for early harvest).
*   **Monsoon (Kharif) Crop:** June to July (main growing season).
*   **Autumn Crop:** September (for a late crop, provided frost does not set in too early).

### Ideal Transplantation Distance

Proper spacing is crucial for good air circulation, light penetration, and ease of harvesting, especially since Yard Long Bean is a climbing vine.

*   **Row-to-Row Distance:** 1.0 - 1.5 meters (100-150 cm).
*   **Plant-to-Plant Distance:** 30 - 60 cm within the row.

### Transplantation Process

While Yard Long Bean is often direct-seeded, transplanting can be beneficial for early establishment, better stand uniformity, and managing nursery conditions.

1.  **Nursery Raising:**
    *   Sow seeds in nursery beds, pro-trays, or small polybags 2-3 weeks before the intended transplanting date.
    *   Use a well-drained, fertile potting mix.
    *   Sow 1-2 seeds per cell/spot at a depth of about 2-3 cm.
    *   Ensure adequate moisture and provide partial shade initially, gradually exposing them to more sunlight.
2.  **Seedling Age:**
    *   Transplant seedlings when they are 2-3 weeks old, typically having 2-4 true leaves, and are healthy and vigorous. Overly old or leggy seedlings suffer more transplant shock.
3.  **Hardening Off:**
    *   About 5-7 days before transplanting, gradually expose the seedlings to outdoor conditions (reduced watering, increased sunlight, wind) to acclimatize them to the field environment. This reduces transplant shock.
4.  **Field Preparation:**
    *   Prepare the main field thoroughly by ploughing and harrowing to achieve a fine tilth.
    *   Incorporate 15-20 tonnes of well-rotted Farmyard Manure (FYM) or compost per acre during land preparation.
    *   Form ridges and furrows or prepare flatbeds according to your irrigation method and field conditions.
5.  **Transplanting:**
    *   Transplant seedlings preferably in the late afternoon or on a cloudy day to minimize stress from direct sun.
    *   Dig holes at the recommended spacing (30-60 cm apart within rows, with rows 1.0-1.5 m apart).
    *   Carefully remove seedlings from the nursery, ensuring the root ball remains intact to prevent root damage.
    *   Place the seedling in the hole, ensuring the root collar (where the stem meets the roots) is at the soil surface level.
    *   Gently firm the soil around the base of each seedling to ensure good root-to-soil contact.
    *   Immediately irrigate the field after transplanting to settle the soil around the roots and provide essential moisture.
6.  **Support System:**
    *   As Yard Long Bean is a climbing vine, provide a support system (trellis, stakes, wires, or bamboo poles) shortly after transplanting or when the vines begin to grow. This is crucial for optimal yield, pod quality, and ease of harvesting.
