Protecting Yard Long Bean from wild animals is a significant challenge for farmers in Haryana. The primary methods focus on physical barriers and deterrents, as broad-spectrum chemical repellents for wild animals are generally not the recommended or CIBRC-approved approach for crop protection in this context.

Here are scientifically verified methods to protect Yard Long Bean from wild animals:

*   **Physical Fencing:**
    *   **Mesh or Barbed Wire Fencing:** Install sturdy fences around the cultivation area. The height and gauge of the wire should be appropriate to deter animals like Nilgai, wild boar, and monkeys. For Nilgai, a fence of at least 2.0-2.5 meters height is often required. Ensure the fence is well-maintained and extends below ground level to prevent burrowing animals.
    *   **Electric Fencing:** Low-voltage electric fences can be highly effective against larger animals like Nilgai and wild boar. These must be installed as per safety guidelines and local regulations to prevent harm to humans and non-target animals. Regular checks are essential to ensure functionality.
    *   **Netting:** For protection against birds and smaller animals (e.g., rodents, some monkeys), overhead or side netting can be used, especially during the fruiting stage. Use durable, UV-stabilized nets with appropriate mesh size.

*   **Deterrents:**
    *   **Scarecrows and Reflective Devices:** Traditional scarecrows, combined with reflective tapes, old CDs, or shiny objects, can deter birds and some smaller mammals. Their position should be changed frequently (every 2-3 days) to prevent animals from habituating.
    *   **Sound Devices:** Using sound cannons or devices that emit loud noises (e.g., distress calls of predators, firecrackers at intervals) can temporarily scare away animals. However, their effectiveness diminishes over time due to habituation, so they should be used intermittently and in combination with other methods.
    *   **Human Presence:** Regular patrolling and human presence in the field, especially during vulnerable periods (e.g., early morning, late evening, and night), can deter many wild animals.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Timely Harvesting:** Harvest pods as soon as they reach maturity to reduce the period of attraction for animals. Overripe or fallen pods can attract various animals.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove fallen pods, weeds, and crop residues that might attract rodents and other animals seeking food or shelter. Maintain a clean perimeter around the field.

*   **Chemical Repellents:**
    *   It is important to note that there are no widely recommended or CIBRC-approved *technical chemical names* specifically for repelling a broad spectrum of wild animals (like Nilgai, monkeys, wild boar) from standing crops like Yard Long Bean in India. Most CIBRC-approved chemicals are for pest control (insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, rodenticides for killing rodents). Therefore, chemical repellents are generally not a primary or feasible method for this specific problem under current regulations and recommendations.
