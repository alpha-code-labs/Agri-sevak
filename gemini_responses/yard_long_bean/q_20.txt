Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the critical role of micronutrients in ensuring healthy growth and optimal yield of Yard Long Bean (Vigna unguiculata subsp. sesquipedalis). Micronutrient deficiencies can significantly impact plant health, flowering, and pod development.

The most scientific approach to address any nutrient deficiency is through **soil testing**. A comprehensive soil test will accurately identify which micronutrients are deficient and to what extent, allowing for precise and efficient application. Visual symptoms can also guide diagnosis, but soil testing provides confirmation.

Here's how to address the specific micronutrient deficiencies in Yard Long Bean:

### General Recommendations:

*   **Soil Application:** Best for long-term correction and building up soil reserves. Apply before sowing or as a basal dose.
*   **Foliar Application:** Provides a quick fix for acute deficiencies, as nutrients are absorbed directly by leaves. Apply during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late afternoon) to prevent leaf scorching and maximize absorption. Ensure good spray coverage.
*   **Water Quality:** Use clean water for all spray solutions.

### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, small leaves (often called "little leaf"), interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, sometimes bronzing or purplish discoloration. Poor pod development.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 2.5 kg of **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (21% Zn) per acre as a basal dose before sowing or at the time of sowing.
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Prepare a 0.5% solution by dissolving 5 g of **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (21% Zn) per litre of water. To neutralize acidity and prevent leaf burn, add 2.5 g of **Calcium hydroxide** (slaked lime) per litre of water.
        *   Alternatively, use **Zinc EDTA** (12% Zn) at a concentration of 1 g per litre of water.
        *   Apply 2-3 foliar sprays at 10-15 day intervals, starting when symptoms appear or at the early vegetative stage.

### 2. Iron (Fe) / Ferrous Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Pronounced interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on young leaves, with veins remaining distinctly green. In severe cases, the entire leaf may turn yellow or even white.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 10-20 kg of **Ferrous sulphate** (19% Fe) per acre, especially in high pH soils.
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Prepare a 0.5% solution by dissolving 5 g of **Ferrous sulphate** (19% Fe) per litre of water. Add 2.5 g of **Calcium hydroxide** (slaked lime) per litre of water to neutralize acidity.
        *   Alternatively, use **Iron EDTA** (12% Fe) at a concentration of 1 g per litre of water.
        *   Apply 2-3 foliar sprays at 10-15 day intervals, starting when symptoms appear.

### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growing points, distorted or thickened new leaves, cracking of stems and petioles, poor flower and pod set, malformed or hollow pods.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 1-2 kg of **Borax** (10.5% B) per acre as a basal dose.
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Prepare a 0.1-0.2% solution by dissolving 1-2 g of **Borax** (10.5% B) or **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (20% B) per litre of water.
        *   Apply 1-2 foliar sprays, particularly at the pre-flowering and early pod development stages, to ensure good fruit set.

### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, distorted or curled new leaves, tip burn of young leaves, poor root development. While less common in Yard Long Bean, severe deficiency can affect pod quality.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** If soil test indicates low calcium, apply **Gypsum** (calcium sulphate) at 250-500 kg per acre, or **Calcium nitrate** as per soil test recommendations.
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Prepare a 0.5% solution by dissolving 5 g of **Calcium chloride** or **Calcium nitrate** per litre of water.
        *   Apply 2-3 foliar sprays, especially during flowering and early pod development stages.

### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on older leaves, with veins remaining green. In severe cases, leaves may develop a reddish-purple tint and eventually become necrotic.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 10-20 kg of **Magnesium sulphate** per acre as a basal dose.
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Prepare a 0.5-1% solution by dissolving 5-10 g of **Magnesium sulphate** per litre of water.
        *   Apply 2-3 foliar sprays at 10-15 day intervals, starting when symptoms appear.

### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, similar to iron deficiency but often with small, scattered necrotic (dead) spots appearing later. Growth may be stunted.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 5-10 kg of **Manganese sulphate** (30.5% Mn) per acre as a basal dose.
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Prepare a 0.5% solution by dissolving 5 g of **Manganese sulphate** (30.5% Mn) per litre of water. Add 2.5 g of **Calcium hydroxide** (slaked lime) per litre of water to neutralize acidity.
        *   Apply 2-3 foliar sprays at 10-15 day intervals, starting when symptoms appear.

### Important Considerations:

*   **Soil pH:** The availability of micronutrients is highly dependent on soil pH. In Haryana, many soils are alkaline, which can reduce the availability of iron, manganese, and zinc. Maintaining optimal soil pH (6.0-7.0 for Yard Long Bean) through organic matter addition and proper soil management is crucial.
*   **Organic Matter:** Incorporating well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost significantly improves soil health and micronutrient availability.
*   **Over-application:** Micronutrients are required in very small quantities. Over-application can lead to toxicity, which can be more damaging than deficiency. Always adhere to recommended dosages.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management:** Combine soil and foliar applications with good agronomic practices for sustainable nutrient management.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively manage micronutrient deficiencies in your Yard Long Bean crop and ensure a healthy, productive harvest.
