Mites, including Red spider mite (*Tetranychus urticae*) and Rust mite (*Aculops lycopersici* or similar species affecting legumes), are indeed significant pests of Yard Long Bean (*Vigna unguiculata subsp. sesquipedalis*) in Haryana, causing considerable damage by sucking sap, leading to leaf discoloration, bronzing, defoliation, and reduced yield. Effective management requires an integrated approach.

### Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies:

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Regular Monitoring:** Inspect plants frequently, especially the undersides of leaves, for early signs of mite infestation.
    *   **Water Spray:** In cases of low to moderate infestation, a strong jet of water can dislodge mites from the plant foliage.
    *   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy heavily infested leaves or plant parts to reduce mite populations and prevent further spread.
    *   **Weed Management:** Control weeds in and around the field, as they can serve as alternate hosts for mites.
    *   **Proper Irrigation:** Ensure adequate soil moisture, as water-stressed plants are more susceptible to mite attacks. Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can promote lush growth attractive to mites.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Conserve natural enemies such as predatory mites (e.g., *Amblyseius* spp.), ladybird beetles, lacewings, and minute pirate bugs, which prey on various mite species. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

### Chemical Control (Acaricides):

When cultural and biological methods are insufficient, and mite populations reach damaging levels, chemical control using CIBRC-approved acaricides can be employed. Always rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where mites primarily reside.

**Recommended Acaricides:**

*   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** Apply at a rate of **0.5 - 0.75 ml per litre of water**. This acaricide is effective against all life stages of mites.
*   **Fenpyroximate 5% EC:** Apply at a rate of **0.5 - 1.0 ml per litre of water**. It acts by contact and stomach action, providing quick knockdown.
*   **Propargite 57% EC:** Apply at a rate of **1.0 - 1.5 ml per litre of water**. This is a contact acaricide effective against motile stages of mites.
*   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP:** Apply at a rate of **2.0 - 3.0 g per litre of water**. This is a broad-spectrum fungicide and acaricide, particularly effective against rust mites and also helps in managing powdery mildew.
*   **Abamectin 1.9% EC:** Apply at a rate of **0.3 - 0.5 ml per litre of water**. It has translaminar action, providing residual control against mites.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the product label for specific dosage, application timing, safety precautions, and Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) to ensure food safety and environmental protection.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including gloves, mask, and protective clothing during mixing and application.
*   Avoid spraying during peak flowering periods to protect pollinators, or apply in the late evening or early morning when pollinator activity is low.
*   Rotate different classes of acaricides to prevent the development of resistance in mite populations.
