Namaste Kisan Bhai/Behan,

As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I understand your concern regarding Scale insects and Mealybugs on your Yard Long Bean (Lobia) crop. Both are sap-sucking pests that can significantly reduce yield if not managed effectively. Here's a scientifically verified approach for their control:

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Principles:**

1.  **Regular Monitoring:** Inspect your plants frequently, especially the undersides of leaves, stem joints, and new shoots, for early signs of infestation.
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Remove and destroy heavily infested plant parts (leaves, stems) to prevent further spread.
    *   Ensure proper plant spacing for good air circulation, which can deter pest establishment.
    *   Manage weeds effectively, as they can harbor these pests.
    *   Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can promote lush, soft growth attractive to sucking pests.
3.  **Mechanical Control:** For small infestations, a strong jet of water can dislodge many pests. Use a soft brush or cotton swab dipped in soapy water to remove mealybugs and scales manually.
4.  **Biological Control:** Encourage natural enemies like ladybird beetles, lacewings, and parasitic wasps, which prey on scales and mealybugs. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.
5.  **Ant Management:** Ants often protect mealybugs and scales to feed on their honeydew. Control ant populations around your plants to reduce pest proliferation.

**Chemical Control (Use only when necessary and as a last resort, following safety guidelines):**

When infestations are severe and other methods are insufficient, CIBRC-approved insecticides can be used. Always read the label carefully before application and follow recommended dosages and safety precautions.

**For Scale Insects and Mealybugs:**

*   **Imidacloprid** (17.8% SL): 0.5-0.75 ml per litre of water.
*   **Thiamethoxam** (25% WG): 0.2-0.4 g per litre of water.
*   **Buprofezin** (25% SC): 1.25-1.5 ml per litre of water. This is an Insect Growth Regulator (IGR) and is particularly effective against nymphs.
*   **Spirotetramat** (11.01% + Imidacloprid 11.01% SC): 0.75-1 ml per litre of water (a combination product for broad-spectrum sucking pest control).
*   **Horticultural Mineral Oil (HMO)** (e.g., 80% EC): 10-20 ml per litre of water. This works by suffocating the pests. Apply thoroughly, ensuring good coverage. Avoid application during very hot periods (above 30°C) or when plants are under moisture stress.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and in leaf axils where these pests tend to hide.
*   **Rotation:** Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always observe the specified Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) mentioned on the insecticide label to ensure the safety of harvested beans.
*   **Safety:** Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) like gloves, mask, and protective clothing during mixing and spraying.

By adopting an integrated approach, you can effectively manage Scale insects and Mealybugs in your Yard Long Bean crop and ensure a healthy harvest.
