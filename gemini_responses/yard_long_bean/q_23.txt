Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU), Hisar, I recommend the following scientifically verified seed and soil treatment processes for Yard Long Bean (Lobia/Chawli) cultivation in Haryana to ensure healthy crop establishment and optimal yield.

### Recommended Seed Treatment Process for Yard Long Bean

Seed treatment is crucial for protecting seeds and young seedlings from seed-borne and early soil-borne diseases, as well as initial pest attacks, leading to better germination and stand establishment.

1.  **Biological Nitrogen Fixation (Essential for Legumes):**
    *   Treat seeds with a specific *Rhizobium* inoculant for legumes. This helps in atmospheric nitrogen fixation, reducing the need for synthetic nitrogen fertilizers.
    *   **Process:** Mix 200-250 g of **Rhizobium** inoculant with 10-15 kg of seeds using a small amount of jaggery solution (gur) or rice starch as a sticker. Dry the seeds in shade before sowing.
    *   **Timing:** Apply just before sowing.

2.  **Fungicidal Treatment (for Damping-off, Root Rot, Seedling Blight):**
    *   To protect against common fungal diseases that affect germination and early seedling growth.
    *   **Option 1 (Broad-spectrum):**
        *   Treat seeds with **Carbendazim 50% WP** at 2 g per kg of seed.
    *   **Option 2 (Contact fungicide):**
        *   Treat seeds with **Thiram 75% WS** at 2.5-3 g per kg of seed.
    *   **Option 3 (Combination for broader spectrum):**
        *   Treat seeds with **Carbendazim 12% + Mancozeb 63% WP** at 2.5 g per kg of seed.
    *   **Option 4 (For Oomycete diseases like Pythium):**
        *   Treat seeds with **Metalaxyl 35% WS** at 6 g per kg of seed.
    *   **Biological Fungicide:**
        *   Alternatively, or in addition to chemical fungicides (applied after chemical treatment has dried), treat seeds with **Trichoderma viride 1% WP** at 4-5 g per kg of seed. This promotes plant growth and suppresses soil-borne pathogens.

3.  **Insecticidal Treatment (Optional, for early sucking pests):**
    *   If there is a known history of early sucking pest infestation (e.g., aphids, jassids) in the region, an insecticide seed treatment can provide initial protection.
    *   **Option 1:**
        *   Treat seeds with **Imidacloprid 600 FS** at 5-7 ml per kg of seed.
    *   **Option 2:**
        *   Treat seeds with **Thiamethoxam 30% FS** at 10 ml per kg of seed.

**Order of Application for Seed Treatment:**
When using multiple treatments, follow this sequence:
1.  Fungicide (chemical)
2.  Insecticide (chemical)
3.  Biologicals (**Rhizobium**, **Trichoderma**) - apply these last, just before sowing, ensuring the chemical treatments have dried to maintain the viability of the biological organisms.

### Recommended Soil Treatment Process for Yard Long Bean

Soil treatment aims to manage soil-borne diseases, nematodes, and improve overall soil health for robust plant growth.

1.  **For Soil-borne Diseases (Root Rot, Wilt, Damping-off):**
    *   **Biological Control (Recommended):**
        *   Incorporate **Trichoderma viride 1% WP** at 2.5 kg per acre into the soil. Mix it thoroughly with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed Farmyard Manure (FYM) or compost and apply it uniformly during the last ploughing or at the time of sowing.
    *   **Chemical Control (If severe disease history):**
        *   Apply **Carbendazim 50% WP** at 500 g per acre mixed with sand or FYM and broadcast evenly before sowing, or as a drench around the root zone after germination.
        *   For specific Oomycete diseases, a drench application of **Propamocarb hydrochloride 72.2% SL** at 2-3 ml per litre of water can be done around the root zone.

2.  **For Nematodes (Root-Knot Nematodes):**
    *   Nematodes can cause significant yield losses in Yard Long Bean.
    *   **Organic/Biological Approach (Recommended):**
        *   Incorporate **Neem cake** at 200-400 kg per acre into the soil 2-3 weeks before sowing. Neem cake has nematicidal properties and improves soil health.
        *   Apply **Paecilomyces lilacinus 1% WP** or **Purpureocillium lilacinum 1% WP** at 2.5 kg per acre, mixed with FYM, at the time of sowing. These are bio-nematicides that parasitize nematode eggs and juveniles.
    *   **Chemical Control (If severe infestation and biologicals are insufficient):**
        *   Apply **Fluensulfone 2% GR** at 10 kg per acre as a pre-plant incorporation.
        *   Alternatively, apply **Cadusafos 10% GR** at 10 kg per acre in furrows at the time of sowing.

3.  **For Enhanced Nutrient Availability:**
    *   Incorporate **Phosphorus Solubilizing Bacteria (PSB)** and **Potassium Mobilizing Bacteria (KMB)** at 2.5 kg per acre each, mixed with FYM, at the time of sowing. These beneficial microbes help in making essential nutrients available to the plants.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always ensure proper moisture levels in the soil for effective action of both chemical and biological treatments.
*   Read and follow the instructions on the product labels carefully for safe and effective application.
*   For specific local conditions or severe pest/disease outbreaks, it is always advisable to consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for tailored advice.

By adopting these recommended practices, you can significantly improve the health and productivity of your Yard Long Bean crop.
