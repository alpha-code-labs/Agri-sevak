As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in Yard Long Bean in Haryana:

It is crucial to adopt an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods for sustainable and effective pest control.

### Control of Borers and Caterpillars

Borers (primarily pod borers like *Maruca vitrata* and *Helicoverpa armigera*) and various defoliating caterpillars are significant pests of Yard Long Bean.

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infested plant parts and crop residues after harvest to reduce pest carryover.
*   **Timely Sowing:** Adjust sowing time to avoid peak pest incidence periods.
*   **Intercropping:** Intercrop with non-host plants to disrupt pest movement and increase natural enemy populations.
*   **Trap Cropping:** Plant trap crops like marigold (for *Helicoverpa*) around the field.

**2. Biological Control:**
*   Conserve natural enemies such as parasitic wasps (e.g., *Trichogramma* spp. for egg parasitism) and predatory insects (e.g., ladybird beetles, lacewings).
*   Application of bio-pesticides like *Bacillus thuringiensis* (Bt) formulations can be effective against young caterpillars, especially for organic farming.

**3. Chemical Control:**
When pest incidence crosses economic threshold levels, judicious application of CIBRC approved insecticides is recommended. Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage and pods.

*   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** Apply at 60 ml per acre.
*   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG:** Apply at 80-100 g per acre.
*   **Flubendiamide 20% WG:** Apply at 50 g per acre.
*   **Indoxacarb 14.5% SC:** Apply at 200 ml per acre.
*   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** Apply at 100-120 ml per acre.

### Diamondback Moth

This is not known to affect Yard Long Bean. Diamondback moth (*Plutella xylostella*) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower, mustard).

### Control of Leaf Folder

Leaf folders (e.g., *Hedylepta indicata*) can cause significant damage by folding leaves and feeding inside, reducing photosynthetic area.

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Monitoring:** Regularly scout the field for folded leaves and the presence of larvae.
*   **Hand Picking:** In small areas, hand-pick and destroy folded leaves containing larvae.

**2. Chemical Control:**
If infestation is severe, apply CIBRC approved insecticides.

*   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** Apply at 60 ml per acre.
*   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG:** Apply at 80-100 g per acre.
*   **Quinalphos 25% EC:** Apply at 500-600 ml per acre.
*   **Profenofos 50% EC:** Apply at 500 ml per acre.

**General Recommendations for Chemical Application:**
*   Always use the recommended dosage and ensure proper spray volume (typically 200-250 litres of water per acre for field crops) for effective coverage.
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.
*   Apply insecticides preferably in the morning or late afternoon to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   Observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) for each chemical to ensure the safety of the produce.
*   Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension officers for the most current and specific recommendations for your region within Haryana.
