As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Yard Long Bean in Haryana:

### Control of Pests in Yard Long Bean

**1. Grasshopper**
Grasshoppers are polyphagous pests that can cause significant defoliation in Yard Long Bean.
*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Maintain field sanitation by removing weeds and crop residues that can serve as breeding grounds.
    *   Deep ploughing after harvest can expose eggs to predators and adverse weather conditions.
*   **Chemical Control (Apply when infestation is observed, preferably in the morning or evening):**
    *   **Malathion** 50% EC: 1.25 L per acre in 250-300 L of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: 200-250 ml per acre in 200-300 L of water.
    *   **Cypermethrin** 25% EC: 200-240 ml per acre in 200-300 L of water.
    *   **Deltamethrin** 2.8% EC: 200-250 ml per acre in 200-300 L of water.

**2. Painted bug (Bagrada hilaris)**
This is not known to affect Yard Long Bean. Painted bug is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., mustard, cabbage).

**3. Red cotton bug (Dysdercus cingulatus)**
This is not known to affect Yard Long Bean. Red cotton bug is primarily a pest of cotton and other malvaceous plants.

**4. Black ants**
Black ants themselves are generally not direct pests of Yard Long Bean plants. However, their presence in large numbers often indicates an infestation of sap-sucking pests like aphids, mealybugs, or whiteflies, as ants "farm" these pests for their honeydew secretions.
*   **Indirect Control (Primary Recommendation):**
    *   The most effective way to manage black ants in this context is to control the primary sap-sucking pests that they are tending. Once the honeydew source is eliminated, the ants will disperse.
    *   For sap-sucking pests, consider insecticides like **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL (0.5 ml/L water) or **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG (0.2 g/L water) if aphids or other sucking pests are present.
*   **Direct Control (If ants are directly causing damage or are a nuisance):**
    *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: 2.5 ml per L of water, used for drenching around the base of affected plants or directly into ant nests.
    *   **Fipronil** 0.3% GR: 5-10 kg per acre, applied as granules around the base of plants or along ant trails.
    *   **Malathion** 50% EC: 2 ml per L of water, sprayed around the base of plants or ant trails.
