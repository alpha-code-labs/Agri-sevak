As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the use of growth regulators and Boron in Yard Long Bean (Vigna unguiculata subsp. sesquipedalis) for Haryana conditions:

Here are the recommendations for the specified compounds:

*   **Ethephon:**
    *   **Purpose:** Ethephon is used to promote female flower production, which can lead to increased pod set and yield in Yard Long Bean.
    *   **Recommended Dose:** Apply **0.15 - 0.25 g of Ethephon per litre of water** (equivalent to 150-250 ppm).
    *   **Application Timing:** Foliar spray at the 2-4 true leaf stage and/or at the initiation of flowering. Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.

*   **2,4-D:**
    *   While **2,4-D** is a CIBRC approved chemical, its use as a growth regulator in Yard Long Bean is generally not recommended. At concentrations typically used for growth regulation in some other crops, it poses a high risk of phytotoxicity (plant damage) and malformation in legumes like Yard Long Bean, as its primary action is that of an herbicide. There are no established safe and beneficial recommendations for its use as a growth regulator in Yard Long Bean in standard agricultural practices.

*   **Boron (as Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate):**
    *   **Purpose:** Boron is an essential micronutrient crucial for pollen germination, flower fertilization, and pod development. Its deficiency can lead to poor flower retention and reduced pod set.
    *   **Recommended Dose:** Apply **1 - 2 g of Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate per litre of water** (providing 0.1% - 0.2% Boron solution).
    *   **Application Timing:** Foliar spray at the pre-flowering stage and again during peak flowering to ensure adequate Boron availability for reproductive development.
