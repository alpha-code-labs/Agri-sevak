As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified strategies for controlling beetles and weevils in Yard Long Bean (Vigna unguiculata subsp. sesquipedalis) in Haryana.

**General Management Practices (Integrated Pest Management - IPM):**

1.  **Regular Monitoring:** Regularly inspect plants for early signs of pest infestation, especially on young leaves, flowers, and developing pods.
2.  **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy crop residues after harvest, as these can harbor pests. Keep the field free of weeds, which can act as alternate hosts.
3.  **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-leguminous crops to break the pest life cycle.
4.  **Timely Sowing:** Sow the crop at the recommended time to avoid peak pest incidence periods.
5.  **Physical Removal:** For small infestations, hand-pick beetles and weevils and destroy them.
6.  **Promote Natural Enemies:** Encourage beneficial insects like ladybird beetles, lacewings, and parasitic wasps, which prey on or parasitize pest insects. Avoid indiscriminate use of broad-spectrum insecticides that can harm these beneficials.

**Specific Control for Beetles and Weevils:**

When pest populations reach economic threshold levels and cultural/biological methods are insufficient, chemical control may be necessary. Always follow label instructions for dosage, application method, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).

*   **For Leaf-feeding Beetles (e.g., Flea Beetles, Leaf Beetles) and Weevils:**
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: Apply at 0.5 ml per liter of water (or 200-250 ml per acre).
    *   **Cypermethrin** 25% EC: Apply at 0.5 ml per liter of water (or 200-250 ml per acre).
    *   **Malathion** 50% EC: Apply at 2 ml per liter of water (or 800-1000 ml per acre).
    *   **Dimethoate** 30% EC: Apply at 1.7 ml per liter of water (or 600-700 ml per acre).
    *   **Acephate** 75% SP: Apply at 1.0 g per liter of water (or 300-400 g per acre).
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: Apply at 0.5 ml per liter of water (or 125-250 ml per acre), particularly effective against flea beetles and sucking pests.
    *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: Apply at 0.2 g per liter of water (or 80-100 g per acre), also effective against flea beetles and sucking pests.

**Regarding Sawflies:**

This is not known to affect Yard Long Bean as a significant pest in Haryana or other parts of India. Sawflies are primarily pests of cruciferous crops (e.g., mustard) and are not typically a concern for Yard Long Bean cultivation.
