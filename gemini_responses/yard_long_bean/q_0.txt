Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I advise on the control of fungal diseases in Yard Long Bean (Lobia/Barbati). Effective management relies on an Integrated Disease Management (IDM) approach, combining cultural practices with timely and judicious application of CIBRC-approved fungicides.

**General Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention:**
*   **Use disease-free and certified seeds.**
*   **Practice crop rotation** with non-leguminous crops to break disease cycles.
*   **Ensure proper plant spacing** to improve air circulation and reduce humidity within the canopy.
*   **Maintain field sanitation** by removing and destroying infected plant debris.
*   **Provide balanced nutrition** to enhance plant vigor and resistance.
*   **Avoid overhead irrigation late in the day** to minimize leaf wetness duration.

Here's the specific advice for the fungal diseases you mentioned:

*   **Alternaria Leaf Spot (Alternaria spp.)**
    This disease is known to affect Yard Long Bean, causing dark, concentric spots on leaves.
    *   For control, spray with:
        *   **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Chlorothalonil** at 2.0 g/L of water.
        *   **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Pyraclostrobin** at 0.5 ml/L of water.

*   **Anthracnose (Colletotrichum lindemuthianum)**
    Anthracnose is a significant disease of Yard Long Bean, causing sunken lesions on pods, stems, and leaves.
    *   For control, spray with:
        *   **Carbendazim** at 1.0 g/L of water.
        *   **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Chlorothalonil** at 2.0 g/L of water.
        *   **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5 ml/L of water.

*   **Blast**
    This is not known to affect Yard Long Bean.

*   **Fungal Blight (e.g., Ascochyta Blight, Web Blight)**
    Various fungal blights can affect Yard Long Bean, leading to leaf spots, stem lesions, and defoliation.
    *   For control, spray with:
        *   **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Chlorothalonil** at 2.0 g/L of water.
        *   **Carbendazim** at 1.0 g/L of water.
        *   **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5 ml/L of water.

*   **Brown Spot (Cercospora Leaf Spot)**
    This disease is known to affect Yard Long Bean, causing small, circular brown spots on leaves.
    *   For control, spray with:
        *   **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Chlorothalonil** at 2.0 g/L of water.
        *   **Carbendazim** at 1.0 g/L of water.
        *   **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5 ml/L of water.

*   **Downy Mildew (Peronospora spp.)**
    Downy mildew can affect Yard Long Bean, appearing as yellowish patches on the upper leaf surface and a grayish-purple fuzzy growth on the underside.
    *   For control, spray with:
        *   **Metalaxyl-M + Mancozeb** (combination product) at 2.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Cymoxanil + Mancozeb** (combination product) at 2.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride** at 2.0 ml/L of water.
        *   **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5 ml/L of water.

*   **Powdery Mildew (Erysiphe polygoni, Oidium spp.)**
    Powdery mildew is a common disease in Yard Long Bean, characterized by white, powdery patches on leaves, stems, and pods.
    *   For control, spray with:
        *   **Wettable Sulphur** at 2.0-3.0 g/L of water.
        *   **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Kresoxim-methyl** at 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Tebuconazole** at 0.75 ml/L of water.
        *   **Hexaconazole** at 0.5 ml/L of water.

*   **Grey Mildew**
    This is not known to affect Yard Long Bean.

Always ensure thorough coverage during spraying and follow the manufacturer's instructions regarding dosage, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and safety precautions. Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
