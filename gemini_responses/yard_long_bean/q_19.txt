Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice to address macro-nutrient deficiencies in Yard Long Bean (Vigna unguiculata subsp. sesquipedalis) for the Haryana region.

First and foremost, it is crucial to conduct a **soil test** to accurately determine the existing nutrient levels in your field. This will help in precise fertilizer application, preventing over-application and ensuring optimal plant health and yield. Visual symptoms can be indicative, but a soil test provides definitive data.

Here's how to address deficiencies of Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K):

### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   General yellowing (chlorosis) of older leaves, starting from the tips and margins.
*   Stunted growth and reduced vigor.
*   Pale green foliage overall.
*   Reduced branching and fewer pods.

**Correction:**
*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Urea** (46% N) at a rate of 20-30 kg/acre as a top dressing, preferably split into two applications: one at 20-25 days after sowing and another at flowering stage. Ensure proper irrigation after application.
*   **Foliar Application (for quick correction):**
    *   Spray a 1-2% solution of **Urea** (10-20 g/L of water) during the vegetative growth phase. Repeat after 10-15 days if symptoms persist. Ensure complete coverage of the foliage.

### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   Dark green or purplish discoloration of older leaves, especially on the undersides.
*   Stunted growth, poor root development, and delayed maturity.
*   Reduced flowering and pod formation.
*   Leaves may appear stiff and upright.

**Correction:**
*   **Soil Application (Basal):**
    *   Apply **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5) at a rate of 50-60 kg/acre at the time of sowing.
    *   Alternatively, apply **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5) at a rate of 150-200 kg/acre at the time of sowing. Mix thoroughly with the soil before planting.
*   **Foliar Application (for quick boost, less common for P):**
    *   Spray a 0.5-1% solution of **Monoammonium Phosphate (MAP)** (12% N, 61% P2O5) or **Potassium Dihydrogen Phosphate (MKP)** (0% N, 52% P2O5, 34% K2O) (5-10 g/L of water) during early vegetative growth.

### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   Yellowing and browning (scorching or necrosis) of leaf margins, particularly on older leaves.
*   Weak stems, leading to lodging.
*   Poor fruit development, small and shriveled pods.
*   Increased susceptibility to diseases and pests.

**Correction:**
*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Muriate of Potash (Potassium Chloride)** (60% K2O) at a rate of 20-30 kg/acre, either as a basal application at sowing or as a top dressing at the flowering stage.
    *   Alternatively, **Sulphate of Potash (Potassium Sulphate)** (50% K2O) can be used at a similar rate, especially if sulfur is also deficient.
*   **Foliar Application (for quick correction):**
    *   Spray a 0.5-1% solution of **Potassium Nitrate** (13% N, 45% K2O) or **Potassium Sulphate** (5-10 g/L of water) at the pre-flowering and pod development stages.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always ensure uniform application of fertilizers.
*   Irrigate the field adequately after soil application of fertilizers to facilitate nutrient uptake.
*   For foliar sprays, use a good quality spreader/sticker to enhance absorption.
*   Monitor your crop regularly for any signs of nutrient stress and adjust your fertilization program based on observations and further soil tests.

By following these recommendations, you can effectively manage macro-nutrient deficiencies in your Yard Long Bean crop and ensure healthy growth and good yields.
