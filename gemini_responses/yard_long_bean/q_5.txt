As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned conditions in Yard Long Bean (Vigna unguiculata subsp. sesquipedalis) in Haryana:

### Control of Scab in Yard Long Bean

Scab in Yard Long Bean is primarily caused by fungi such as *Cladosporium vignae* or *Elsinoë phaseoli*. It manifests as small, circular, dark brown spots, often sunken on pods, and can also affect leaves and stems.

**Integrated Management Strategies:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Use disease-free seeds and resistant varieties if available.
    *   Practice crop rotation with non-host crops for at least 2-3 years.
    *   Ensure proper plant spacing to improve air circulation and reduce humidity within the canopy.
    *   Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest to reduce inoculum for the next season.

2.  **Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved):**
    *   At the first appearance of symptoms, or preventively during humid conditions conducive to disease development, apply a foliar spray of:
        *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP): 2.5 g/L of water (or 2 kg/acre).
        *   **Chlorothalonil** (75% WP): 2 g/L of water (or 1.5 kg/acre).
    *   Repeat the application at 10-15 day intervals if the disease persists or conditions remain favorable.

### Control of Canker in Yard Long Bean

While "canker" is a broad term, in Yard Long Bean, it often refers to stem and pod lesions caused by diseases like Anthracnose (*Colletotrichum lindemuthianum*). Symptoms include dark, sunken lesions with reddish-brown borders on stems, pods, and leaves.

**Integrated Management Strategies:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Use certified disease-free seeds.
    *   Plant resistant varieties.
    *   Practice crop rotation with non-leguminous crops.
    *   Avoid overhead irrigation, which can splash spores and create humid conditions.
    *   Sanitation: Remove and destroy infected plant parts promptly.

2.  **Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved):**
    *   For preventive control or at the onset of symptoms, apply a foliar spray of:
        *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP): 2.5 g/L of water (or 2 kg/acre).
        *   **Carbendazim** (50% WP): 1 g/L of water (or 500 g/acre).
        *   **Thiophanate-methyl** (70% WP): 1 g/L of water (or 500 g/acre).
    *   Ensure thorough coverage of the plant. Repeat applications every 10-15 days, especially during periods of high humidity and rainfall.

### Control of Gummosis in Yard Long Bean

This is not known to affect Yard Long Bean. Gummosis is primarily a symptom of disease or stress in woody plants, particularly fruit trees, and is not a characteristic condition of herbaceous annual vines like Yard Long Bean.

### Control of Lichen in Yard Long Bean

This is not known to affect Yard Long Bean. Lichens are symbiotic organisms (fungus and alga) that grow on surfaces like tree bark, rocks, or soil. They are epiphytes and do not parasitize or harm the plant they grow on. They are not a disease or pest of Yard Long Bean and do not require control measures.
