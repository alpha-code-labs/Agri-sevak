Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling soil pests like termites and root-knot nematodes in Yard Long Bean (Vigna unguiculata subsp. sesquipedalis) in Haryana. Both these pests are known to affect Yard Long Bean and can significantly reduce yield if not managed properly.

Here's how to control them:

### 1. Control of Termites (e.g., *Odontotermes obesus*, *Microtermes obesi*)

Termites can cause significant damage by feeding on the roots and stem base of Yard Long Bean plants, leading to wilting and plant death, especially in dry conditions.

**Cultural and Preventive Measures:**
*   Ensure good field sanitation by removing crop residues, stubble, and any woody debris that can serve as food or shelter for termites.
*   Deep ploughing before sowing can expose termite colonies to predators and sunlight, disrupting their activity.
*   Avoid leaving organic matter like farmyard manure uncomposted on the soil surface, as it can attract termites.

**Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved):**
For effective chemical control, apply insecticides to the soil at the time of sowing or transplanting, or as a drench around affected plants.

*   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC:**
    *   Apply 2.5 litres per acre mixed with irrigation water or as a soil drench. For individual plant drenching, mix 2.5 ml per litre of water and apply around the base of the plant.
*   **Fipronil 0.3% GR:**
    *   Apply 6-10 kg per acre as a soil application at the time of sowing or transplanting, incorporating it into the soil.

### 2. Control of Nematodes (Root-knot Nematodes - *Meloidogyne* spp.)

Root-knot nematodes are a major pest of Yard Long Bean, causing characteristic galls or swellings on the roots. This damage impairs water and nutrient uptake, leading to stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, reduced flowering, and significant yield loss.

**Cultural and Preventive Measures:**
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops like cereals (e.g., maize, wheat, sorghum) for at least 2-3 years to reduce nematode populations in the soil.
*   **Solarization:** During hot summer months, cover the moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks to raise soil temperature and kill nematodes.
*   **Organic Matter Addition:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure or compost (20-30 tonnes per acre) into the soil. This improves soil health and promotes beneficial microorganisms that can suppress nematode populations.
*   **Use of Resistant Varieties:** If available, choose Yard Long Bean varieties known to have resistance or tolerance to root-knot nematodes.

**Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved):**
Nematicides can be applied to the soil before or at the time of sowing/planting.

*   **Fluensulfone 2% GR:**
    *   Apply 20-30 kg per acre as a soil application, incorporating it thoroughly into the soil before sowing or transplanting.
*   **Carbofuran 3% CG:**
    *   Apply 10-15 kg per acre as a soil application at the time of sowing or transplanting, ensuring it is mixed well with the soil.
*   **Phorate 10% CG:**
    *   Apply 4-6 kg per acre as a soil application at the time of sowing or transplanting, incorporating it into the soil.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label carefully, including dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) while handling and applying chemicals.
*   Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods, is the most sustainable and effective strategy for long-term pest control.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions.
