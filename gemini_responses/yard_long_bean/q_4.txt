Wilt, including Fusarium wilt and bacterial wilt, can significantly affect Yard Long Bean (Vigna unguiculata subsp. sesquipedalis) in Haryana. While "Parawilt" is a term more commonly associated with cotton, general wilting symptoms in Yard Long Bean are typically caused by soil-borne fungal or bacterial pathogens. Effective control requires an integrated approach.

Here's how to control wilt in Yard Long Bean:

**I. Cultural and Agronomic Practices (Preventive Measures):**

*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice a 3-4 year crop rotation with non-host crops like cereals (e.g., maize, sorghum) to reduce pathogen inoculum in the soil. Avoid planting beans or other susceptible legumes consecutively.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available and suitable for Haryana conditions, select and plant varieties known to have resistance or tolerance to Fusarium wilt or bacterial wilt. Consult HAU recommendations for specific varieties.
*   **Soil Solarization:** During the hot summer months (May-June), after harvesting the previous crop, deep plough the field, irrigate it, and cover it tightly with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks. This raises soil temperature, killing many soil-borne pathogens, including wilt-causing fungi and bacteria.
*   **Improved Drainage:** Ensure proper field drainage to prevent waterlogging, which can stress plants and create anaerobic conditions favorable for some root rot and wilt pathogens.
*   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris from the field to prevent the build-up and spread of pathogens.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced fertilization based on soil test reports. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can make plants more susceptible to diseases. Adequate potassium can improve plant vigor and resistance.
*   **Timely Sowing:** Sow seeds at the recommended time to ensure optimal plant growth and reduce stress.
*   **Avoid Mechanical Injury:** Minimize root damage during intercultural operations, as wounds can serve as entry points for pathogens.

**II. Biological Control:**

*   **Seed Treatment:**
    *   Treat seeds with **Trichoderma viride** or **Pseudomonas fluorescens** at 5-10 g/kg seed before sowing. These bio-agents colonize the root zone, suppressing the growth of wilt-causing pathogens.
*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Trichoderma viride** or **Pseudomonas fluorescens** to the soil at 2.5 kg/acre, mixed with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost. Apply this mixture near the root zone at the time of sowing or transplanting, or as a drench.

**III. Chemical Control:**

*   **Seed Treatment (Crucial for early protection):**
    *   Treat seeds with a systemic fungicide like **Carbendazim** at 1-2 g/kg seed, or **Thiophanate-methyl** at 2 g/kg seed.
    *   Alternatively, a combination of **Carbendazim** (1 g/kg seed) and **Thiram** (2 g/kg seed) can provide broader spectrum protection.
    *   Ensure proper mixing for uniform coating of seeds.
*   **Soil Drench (For early stage infection):**
    *   If wilting symptoms appear in isolated plants during the early growth stages, drench the soil around the affected plants with a solution of **Carbendazim** at 1-2 g/L of water or **Thiophanate-methyl** at 1-1.5 g/L of water. This can help in containing the spread.
    *   For suspected bacterial wilt, chemical control is generally less effective once the disease is established. However, some copper-based formulations might be considered as a drench, but their efficacy is limited. Consult with HAU experts for specific recommendations if bacterial wilt is confirmed.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions when using any chemical or biological product.
*   Integrated management, combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods, provides the most sustainable and effective control against wilt diseases.
*   Regular field monitoring is essential to detect symptoms early and implement timely control measures.
