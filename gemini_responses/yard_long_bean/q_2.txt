Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I would like to clarify that the specific categorization of "Black, Brown, Yellow, White, and Red rust" as distinct diseases is primarily associated with cereal crops like wheat or other specific plant families.

For Yard Long Bean (Lobia/Cowpea), the common rust disease is caused by the fungus *Uromyces appendiculatus*. This disease typically manifests as small, reddish-brown pustules on the leaves, stems, and sometimes pods. The control measures provided below are for this common rust disease affecting Yard Long Bean.

Here's how to control rust disease in Yard Long Bean:

**I. Cultural and Preventive Measures:**

1.  **Resistant Varieties:** Whenever possible, choose and plant rust-resistant varieties suitable for the Haryana region. Consult with your local KVK (Krishi Vigyan Kendra) for recommendations.
2.  **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting Yard Long Bean or other susceptible legumes in the same field for at least 2-3 years. Rotate with non-host crops like cereals or vegetables from different families.
3.  **Sanitation:** After harvest, collect and destroy all infected plant debris by burning or deep burying. This reduces the inoculum for the next season.
4.  **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to improve air circulation within the canopy, which helps in reducing leaf wetness duration and fungal growth.
5.  **Irrigation Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day, as prolonged leaf wetness promotes rust development. Drip irrigation is preferred. If overhead irrigation is unavoidable, do it in the morning to allow leaves to dry quickly.
6.  **Weed Control:** Keep the field free of weeds, as some weeds can act as alternate hosts for the rust fungus.

**II. Chemical Control (Fungicides):**

Chemical control should be initiated at the first sign of disease symptoms or if weather conditions are highly favorable for rust development (moderate temperatures and high humidity). Always ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.

*   **Mancozeb** 75% WP: Apply at a rate of 2.0-2.5 kg per acre (or 2.5-3.0 grams per litre of water).
*   **Chlorothalonil** 75% WP: Apply at a rate of 1.5-2.0 kg per acre (or 2.0-2.5 grams per litre of water).
*   **Propiconazole** 25% EC: Apply at a rate of 200-250 ml per acre (or 0.5 ml per litre of water).
*   **Tebuconazole** 25% EC: Apply at a rate of 250-300 ml per acre (or 0.6-0.75 ml per litre of water).
*   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC: Apply at a rate of 200 ml per acre (or 0.5 ml per litre of water).
*   **Azoxystrobin 18.2% + Difenoconazole 11.4% SC:** Apply at a rate of 200 ml per acre (or 0.5 ml per litre of water).
*   **Tebuconazole 50% + Trifloxystrobin 25% WG:** Apply at a rate of 120-160 grams per acre (or 0.3-0.4 grams per litre of water).

**Application Schedule:**

*   Start spraying as soon as the first rust pustules are observed.
*   Repeat applications at 10-15 day intervals, depending on disease severity and prevailing weather conditions.
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the fungicide label for specific dosage, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and safety precautions.
