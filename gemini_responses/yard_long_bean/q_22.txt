As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), here are the recommended cultivation practices for Yard Long Bean (Vigna unguiculata subsp. sesquipedalis) suitable for Haryana conditions:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   Yard Long Bean is typically direct-seeded.
    *   It can be sown on flat beds in rows or on the sides of ridges/raised beds.
    *   As it is a climbing vine, providing support (trellising, stakes, or wire mesh) is crucial for optimal growth, yield, and ease of harvesting. Sowing should be planned keeping the support system in mind.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   Seeds should be planted at a depth of 2-3 cm. Deeper planting can hinder germination, especially in heavy soils.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   **Row-to-Row Spacing:** 75-90 cm
    *   **Plant-to-Plant Spacing:** 30-45 cm
    *   This spacing allows for good air circulation, light penetration, and facilitates trellising and harvesting.

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   The recommended seed dose is 8-12 kg/acre, depending on the variety, seed size, and desired plant population. Ensure good quality seeds with high germination percentage.
