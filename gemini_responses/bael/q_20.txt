Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I understand the importance of balanced nutrition for optimal Bael (Aegle marmelos) growth and fruit production. Micronutrient deficiencies can significantly impact plant health and yield. The first and most crucial step is to conduct a comprehensive soil test to accurately identify the specific deficiencies and their severity in your orchard. Based on the soil test results, you can then apply the appropriate corrective measures.

Here's how to address the common micronutrient deficiencies in Bael, using CIBRC approved technical chemical names and metric units:

### General Recommendations:
*   Always ensure proper soil moisture before applying soil amendments.
*   For foliar sprays, apply during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late afternoon) and ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.
*   Adding a non-ionic wetting agent (0.5 ml/L) to foliar sprays can improve absorption.
*   Repeat foliar applications at 15-20 day intervals if symptoms persist, but do not exceed 2-3 sprays per season unless severe deficiency is observed.

### Specific Micronutrient Deficiencies:

1.  **Zinc (Zn) Deficiency:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Small, narrow leaves (little leaf), rosetting of leaves, interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves.
    *   **Correction:**
        *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (21% Zn) at 10-20 kg/acre, once a year, preferably before the monsoon or during dormant season, mixed with farmyard manure.
        *   **Foliar Spray:** Spray **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (21% Zn) at 5 g/L of water (0.5% solution) or **Zinc EDTA** (12% Zn) at 1 g/L of water (0.1% solution).

2.  **Iron (Fe) Deficiency:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Pronounced interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on young leaves, with veins remaining green. In severe cases, leaves may turn completely yellow or white.
    *   **Correction:**
        *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Ferrous sulphate** (19% Fe) at 20-30 kg/acre, once a year, mixed with farmyard manure, especially in alkaline soils.
        *   **Foliar Spray:** Spray **Ferrous sulphate** (19% Fe) at 5 g/L of water (0.5% solution) or **Iron EDTA** (12% Fe) at 1 g/L of water (0.1% solution). Iron EDTA is generally more effective in alkaline conditions.

3.  **Boron (B) Deficiency:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Dieback of growing points, stunted growth, cracking or corkiness of fruits, poor fruit set, and sometimes internal browning of fruit flesh.
    *   **Correction:**
        *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Borax** (10.5% B) at 5-10 kg/acre, once a year, mixed with farmyard manure.
        *   **Foliar Spray:** Spray **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (20% B) at 1-1.5 g/L of water (0.1-0.15% solution) before flowering and after fruit set.

4.  **Calcium (Ca) Deficiency:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, distorted or curled young leaves, tip burn on young leaves, poor root development. While blossom end rot is common in some fruits, Bael typically shows general growth issues.
    *   **Correction:**
        *   **Soil Application:** If soil pH is low, apply **Agricultural lime** as per soil test recommendations. If pH is high, **Gypsum** can be used if calcium is low and sulfur is needed.
        *   **Foliar Spray:** Spray **Calcium nitrate** (15.5% N, 19% Ca) at 5 g/L of water (0.5% solution).

5.  **Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, starting from the leaf margins and progressing inwards, with veins remaining green. Leaves may become brittle.
    *   **Correction:**
        *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Magnesium sulphate** (9.6% Mg) at 10-20 kg/acre, once a year, mixed with farmyard manure.
        *   **Foliar Spray:** Spray **Magnesium sulphate** (9.6% Mg) at 5 g/L of water (0.5% solution).

6.  **Manganese (Mn) Deficiency:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, often appearing as a mottled or speckled yellowing, similar to iron deficiency but usually less severe and more diffuse.
    *   **Correction:**
        *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Manganese sulphate** (30.5% Mn) at 10-15 kg/acre, once a year, mixed with farmyard manure.
        *   **Foliar Spray:** Spray **Manganese sulphate** (30.5% Mn) at 3-4 g/L of water (0.3-0.4% solution).

Remember, consistent monitoring of your Bael plants and regular soil testing are key to maintaining their health and productivity.
