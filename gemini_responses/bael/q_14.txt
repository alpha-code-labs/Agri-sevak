As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling soil pests in Bael (Aegle marmelos) in Haryana. An integrated pest management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods, is crucial for sustainable control.

### 1. Termites (e.g., *Odontotermes obesus*, *Microtermes obesi*)

Termites are a significant threat to Bael, especially young plants. They feed on roots, the collar region, and can hollow out the main stem, leading to wilting, stunted growth, and eventual death of the plant. Mud galleries on the trunk and branches are characteristic signs of their presence.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural and Mechanical:**
    *   Remove all dead wood, stumps, and debris from the orchard.
    *   Avoid direct contact of organic matter (like farmyard manure) with the main stem of the Bael tree.
    *   Ensure proper irrigation to avoid water stress, as stressed plants are more susceptible.
    *   Locate and destroy termite mounds in and around the orchard.
*   **Chemical Control (Soil Drenching/Application):**
    *   For established trees, drench the soil around the base of the tree with an insecticide solution. For young plants, apply before planting or as a prophylactic measure.
    *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC:** Apply at 2.5 ml per liter of water, drenching the soil around the base of the tree. For general soil treatment in an infested area, use 5 liters per acre mixed with sufficient water.
    *   **Fipronil 5% SC:** Apply at 1-2 ml per liter of water, drenching the soil around the base of the tree.
    *   **Fipronil 0.3% GR:** Apply 10-15 kg per acre by broadcasting around the base of the trees and lightly incorporating into the soil.

### 2. Nematodes (Root-Knot Nematodes - *Meloidogyne* spp.)

Root-knot nematodes are a major concern, causing characteristic galls or knots on the roots of Bael trees. This damage impairs water and nutrient uptake, leading to stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, premature leaf drop, reduced fruit size and yield, and general decline in plant vigor.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural and Biological:**
    *   **Soil Solarization:** For nursery beds, cover moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks during hot summer months to reduce nematode populations.
    *   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost.
    *   **Neem Cake:** Apply 1-2 kg of **Neem Cake** per tree, mixed into the soil around the root zone. Neem cake has nematicidal properties and also improves soil health.
    *   **Bio-nematicides:** Apply microbial antagonists.
        *   **Purpureocillium lilacinum (formerly Paecilomyces lilacinus):** Apply 2-4 kg per acre or 50-100 g per tree, mixed with 25-50 kg of FYM/compost and applied to the root zone.
        *   **Trichoderma harzianum:** Apply 2-4 kg per acre or 50-100 g per tree, mixed with 25-50 kg of FYM/compost and applied to the root zone.
*   **Chemical Control (Granular Application/Drenching):**
    *   Apply nematicides around the root zone of affected trees and lightly incorporate into the soil, followed by light irrigation.
    *   **Fluensulfone 2% GR:** Apply 20-30 kg per acre, or 200-300 g per tree for established trees.
    *   **Cadusafos 10% GR:** Apply 10-15 kg per acre, or 100-150 g per tree for established trees.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label carefully, including safety precautions and pre-harvest intervals.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during application.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension specialists for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and current CIBRC guidelines.
