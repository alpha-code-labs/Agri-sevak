Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies in Bael (Aegle marmelos) orchards in Haryana.

While Bael is generally hardy, certain insect pests, including some beetles and weevils, can occasionally cause damage. Specific sawfly infestations on Bael are less commonly reported, but generalist defoliating sawflies could potentially affect the crop.

An Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is recommended for effective and sustainable control.

### Integrated Pest Management for Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies in Bael

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**

*   **Orchard Sanitation:** Regularly remove fallen fruits, leaves, and plant debris from the orchard floor. This reduces breeding sites and overwintering habitats for many pests, especially weevils and some beetles.
*   **Weed Management:** Keep the area around Bael trees free of weeds, as they can harbor pests.
*   **Pruning:** Remove any infested or damaged branches. Proper pruning improves air circulation and sunlight penetration, making the environment less favorable for pests.
*   **Hand-picking:** For localized and minor infestations of larger beetles, weevil adults, or sawfly larvae, hand-picking and destroying them can be an effective method.
*   **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your Bael trees, especially young leaves, flowers, and developing fruits, for signs of pest activity (e.g., chewed leaves, boreholes, presence of adults or larvae). Early detection is key for effective management.

**2. Chemical Control (Use only when necessary and as a last resort, following safety guidelines):**

When pest populations are high and causing significant damage, chemical intervention may be required. Always ensure thorough coverage of the foliage and fruits. Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

For controlling defoliating beetles, weevils, and sawfly larvae, the following CIBRC approved technical chemicals can be considered:

*   **For Chewing Pests (Beetles, Weevils, Sawfly Larvae):**
    *   **Chlorpyrifos 50% EC:** Apply at a rate of 2.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Cypermethrin 25% EC:** Apply at a rate of 0.5 - 1.0 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** Apply at a rate of 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG:** Apply at a rate of 0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water. This is particularly effective against larvae.

*   **For Systemic Action (e.g., if weevils are boring into stems or fruits, or for general defoliators):**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at a rate of 0.5 - 0.7 ml per litre of water. While primarily for sucking pests, it can be effective against chewing insects that feed on treated plant parts.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Timing of Application:** Apply insecticides during the early stages of infestation for best results. Avoid spraying during flowering to protect pollinators.
*   **Safety Precautions:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, and protective clothing while handling and applying pesticides. Follow the instructions on the product label carefully.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Observe the specified pre-harvest interval for each chemical to ensure the safety of the fruit for consumption.
*   **Consult Local Experts:** For specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and the current pest situation, it is always advisable to consult with the local agricultural extension officers or experts at HAU, Hisar.

By implementing these strategies, you can effectively manage beetle, weevil, and sawfly populations in your Bael orchard.
