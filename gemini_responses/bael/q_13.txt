As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing pests in Bael cultivation in Haryana.

Here's how to control Fruit fly and Ber fly in Bael:

### Control of Fruit Fly in Bael

Fruit flies, primarily species like *Bactrocera dorsalis*, are significant pests of Bael, causing damage by laying eggs in developing fruits, leading to rotting and premature fruit drop. An Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is recommended for effective control.

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Orchard Sanitation:** Regularly collect and destroy all fallen, damaged, and infested fruits by burying them deep in the soil (at least 60 cm) or composting them in sealed pits. This breaks the life cycle of the pest.
    *   **Deep Ploughing:** After harvest, deep ploughing of the orchard soil helps expose and destroy pupae present in the soil.

2.  **Monitoring and Mass Trapping:**
    *   **Pheromone Traps:** Install **Methyl eugenol** based pheromone traps at a density of 5-10 traps per acre, starting from fruit set. These traps attract and kill male fruit flies, reducing the breeding population. Replace the lure every 2-3 weeks.

3.  **Bait Sprays:**
    *   Prepare bait sprays by mixing an insecticide with a protein source (like jaggery or protein hydrolysate) that attracts fruit flies. Apply these as spot sprays on tree trunks or on a few leaves, not as a full canopy spray.
    *   Mix **Malathion** 50% EC @ 2 ml/L of water with 20 g/L of jaggery or protein hydrolysate.
    *   Alternatively, use **Spinosad** 45% SC @ 0.25 ml/L of water with 20 g/L of jaggery or protein hydrolysate.
    *   Apply these baits once every 7-10 days, especially during the fruit development stage.

4.  **Chemical Sprays (as a last resort for severe infestations):**
    *   If the infestation is severe and other methods are insufficient, chemical sprays can be considered, ensuring to observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI).
    *   Spray with **Dimethoate** 30% EC @ 1.7 ml/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, use **Deltamethrin** 2.8% EC @ 1 ml/L of water.
    *   Ensure thorough coverage of the fruit-bearing canopy.

### Control of Ber Fly in Bael

This is not known to affect Bael. The Ber fly (*Carpomyia vesuviana*) is a specific pest of Ber (*Ziziphus mauritiana*) and related *Ziziphus* species, and is not reported to infest Bael (*Aegle marmelos*).
