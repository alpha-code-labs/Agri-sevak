As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Bael (Aegle marmelos) in Haryana.

Effective management of fungal diseases in Bael requires an integrated approach combining cultural practices and timely application of CIBRC approved fungicides.

**General Cultural Practices for Fungal Disease Management:**

*   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant parts (leaves, twigs, fruits) to reduce inoculum.
*   **Pruning:** Prune diseased, dead, or overcrowded branches to improve air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce humidity and fungal growth. Ensure pruning tools are sterilized.
*   **Nutrition:** Maintain optimal plant nutrition to enhance plant vigor and resistance.
*   **Water Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation late in the day, which can leave foliage wet for extended periods, promoting fungal development.

**Specific Fungal Diseases and Their Control in Bael:**

1.  **Alternaria Leaf Spot and Fruit Rot (Caused by *Alternaria alternata*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Irregular, dark brown spots with concentric rings on leaves, often leading to defoliation. On fruits, sunken, dark lesions can develop, leading to rot.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   **Prophylactic Spray:**
            *   **Mancozeb** @ 2.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Systemic/Curative Spray (at first sign of disease):**
            *   **Azoxystrobin** @ 0.5-1 ml/L of water.
            *   **Tebuconazole** @ 0.75-1 ml/L of water.
        *   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

2.  **Anthracnose (Leaf Spot, Twig Blight, Fruit Rot) (Caused by *Colletotrichum gloeosporioides*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Dark, sunken lesions on leaves, twigs, and fruits. On twigs, it can cause dieback. On fruits, it leads to dark, circular, sunken spots that can coalesce and cause extensive rot, especially during ripening. This disease is often responsible for "blight" symptoms on twigs and leaves.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy infected twigs and branches.
        *   **Prophylactic Spray (before monsoon or at flowering/fruit set):**
            *   **Copper oxychloride** @ 2.5-3 g/L of water.
            *   **Mancozeb** @ 2.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Systemic/Curative Spray (at first sign of disease):**
            *   **Carbendazim** @ 1 g/L of water.
            *   **Azoxystrobin** @ 0.5-1 ml/L of water.
            *   **Tebuconazole** @ 0.75-1 ml/L of water.
        *   Ensure good coverage, especially on young leaves and developing fruits.

3.  **Powdery Mildew (Caused by *Oidium* species)**
    *   **Symptoms:** White, powdery patches on the surface of young leaves, shoots, and sometimes fruits. Infected leaves may curl, distort, and drop prematurely.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   **Prophylactic/Early Stage Spray:**
            *   **Wettable Sulphur** @ 2-3 g/L of water (avoid spraying when temperatures are very high, above 30°C, to prevent phytotoxicity).
        *   **Systemic/Curative Spray (at first sign of disease):**
            *   **Hexaconazole** @ 0.5 ml/L of water.
            *   **Propiconazole** @ 0.5 ml/L of water.
            *   **Tebuconazole** @ 0.75-1 ml/L of water.

**Regarding other listed conditions:**

*   **Blast:** This is not known to affect Bael as a distinct pathological entity (e.g., Rice Blast).
*   **Blight:** While 'blight' is a general symptom (e.g., twig blight caused by Anthracnose), a specific 'Blight disease' independent of other known pathogens is not commonly reported for Bael. Control measures for Anthracnose will manage blight symptoms caused by *Colletotrichum*.
*   **Brown spot:** This is a general descriptive term for symptoms. Brown spots on Bael are typically caused by diseases like Alternaria leaf spot or early stages of Anthracnose. Control measures for these specific diseases will address brown spot symptoms.
*   **Downy Mildew:** This is not known to affect Bael.
*   **Grey Mildew:** This is not known to affect Bael.

**Important Considerations for Fungicide Application:**

*   **Timing:** Apply fungicides preventively during periods conducive to disease development (e.g., high humidity, rainy season) or at the very first appearance of symptoms.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough coverage of all plant parts, including the undersides of leaves.
*   **Rotation:** Always rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of fungicide resistance in pathogens.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Strictly adhere to the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) mentioned on the fungicide label to ensure fruit safety.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying, and follow all safety instructions on the product label.
