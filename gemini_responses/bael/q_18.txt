As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified recommendations for the use of growth regulators and hormones in Bael cultivation in Haryana:

*   **Ethephon** (Ethrel is a brand name for Ethephon)
    *   **Purpose:** Primarily used for uniform fruit ripening in Bael. It promotes ethylene production, which accelerates the ripening process.
    *   **Recommended Dose:** For inducing uniform ripening, spray fruits with **Ethephon** at a concentration of 250-500 mg/L (0.25-0.5 g/L) of water, approximately 7-10 days before the anticipated harvest. Ensure thorough coverage of the fruits.

*   **2,4-D**
    *   This is not commonly recommended or known to affect Bael beneficially as a growth regulator in standard horticultural practices. Its primary use in agriculture is as a herbicide, and its application as a growth regulator requires extremely precise, very low concentrations, which can be detrimental if misapplied.

*   **Boron**
    *   **Purpose:** Boron is an essential micronutrient vital for pollen germination, fruit set, cell wall formation, and sugar transport in Bael. Deficiency can lead to poor fruit set, fruit malformation, and reduced yield.
    *   **Recommended Dose (Foliar Application):** To correct Boron deficiency or as a prophylactic measure, spray the foliage with **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate) at a concentration of 1-2 g/L of water (0.1-0.2%) or **Boric acid** at 1 g/L of water (0.1%). Apply during critical stages like pre-flowering and fruit development.
    *   **Recommended Dose (Soil Application):** For soil application, especially in Boron deficient soils (based on soil test reports), apply 100-200 g of **Borax** per mature Bael tree, mixed with farmyard manure, once a year before the monsoon or during the dormant season. For general orchard application, 10-20 kg of **Borax** per acre can be broadcasted and incorporated into the soil.
