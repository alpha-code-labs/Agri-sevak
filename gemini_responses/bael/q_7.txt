As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling diseases in Bael:

### Control of Dieback and Twig Blight in Bael

Dieback and Twig blight are common and often related fungal diseases affecting Bael, primarily caused by pathogens like *Colletotrichum gloeosporioides* (anamorph of *Glomerella cingulata*) and *Diplodia natalensis*. These diseases lead to the drying and death of twigs and branches, progressing downwards. Effective management involves a combination of cultural practices and timely fungicidal applications.

**1. Cultural Practices:**

*   **Pruning:** Regularly inspect trees and promptly remove all affected twigs and branches showing symptoms of dieback or blight. Prune well into the healthy wood, at least 15-20 cm below the visible symptoms, to ensure complete removal of the pathogen.
*   **Sanitation:** Collect and immediately destroy all pruned material by burning to eliminate inoculum sources and prevent further spread of the disease.
*   **Wound Protection:** After pruning larger branches, apply a fungicidal paste to the cut surfaces. A paste can be prepared by mixing a fungicide like **Copper oxychloride** with linseed oil or water to a thick consistency. This prevents the entry of pathogens through fresh wounds.
*   **Orchard Hygiene:** Maintain good orchard hygiene by removing fallen leaves and debris.
*   **Nutrient and Water Management:** Ensure the trees receive balanced nutrition and adequate water, especially during dry periods, to enhance their vigor and natural resistance to diseases. Avoid waterlogging.

**2. Chemical Control (Fungicidal Sprays):**

Timely application of CIBRC approved fungicides is crucial, especially during periods conducive to disease development (e.g., high humidity, post-monsoon).

*   **Pre-monsoon and Post-monsoon Sprays:**
    *   Spray with **Copper oxychloride** (50% WP) at a concentration of 3 g/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, spray with **Carbendazim** (50% WP) at a concentration of 1 g/L of water.
    *   Another effective option is **Propiconazole** (25% EC) at a concentration of 1 ml/L of water.
    *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP) can also be used at a concentration of 2.5 g/L of water.
*   **Application:** Ensure thorough coverage of the entire tree canopy, including the undersides of leaves and branches. Repeat sprays at 10-15 day intervals if disease pressure is high or environmental conditions remain favorable for disease development.

### Tikka Disease in Bael

This is not known to affect Bael. Tikka disease is primarily a leaf spot disease of groundnut (*Arachis hypogaea*).
