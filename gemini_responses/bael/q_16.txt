As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following fertilizer schedule for Bael (Aegle marmelos) cultivation in Haryana. Please note that these are general guidelines, and a soil test is highly recommended for precise nutrient management tailored to your specific field conditions.

**General Principles for Fertilizer Application:**

*   **Soil Testing:** Always conduct a soil test to determine the exact nutrient status of your soil. This will help in optimizing fertilizer doses and preventing nutrient imbalances.
*   **Application Timing:** For better nutrient utilization, apply fertilizers in two split doses. A common practice is to apply half the dose in February-March (pre-monsoon) and the remaining half in July-August (post-monsoon/early fruit development).
*   **Application Method:** Spread the fertilizers uniformly in a ring around the tree, starting 30-60 cm away from the trunk and extending up to the drip line. Incorporate the fertilizers lightly into the soil and follow with irrigation.

### Recommended Fertilizer Doses for Bael:

#### 1. Young Non-Bearing Trees (1-3 years)

For young trees, gradually increase the NPK dose annually. The following elemental NPK recommendations can be met using a combination of straight fertilizers:

*   **Year 1:** 100 g Nitrogen (N), 50 g Phosphorus (P2O5), 100 g Potassium (K2O) per tree per year.
*   **Year 2:** 200 g Nitrogen (N), 100 g Phosphorus (P2O5), 200 g Potassium (K2O) per tree per year.
*   **Year 3:** 300 g Nitrogen (N), 150 g Phosphorus (P2O5), 300 g Potassium (K2O) per tree per year.

*Approximate conversion to conventional fertilizers (example for Year 1):*
*   **Urea:** Approximately 175 g per tree
*   **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP):** Approximately 110 g per tree
*   **Muriate of Potash (MOP):** Approximately 170 g per tree

#### 2. Bearing Trees (4 years and above)

For healthy and productive bearing Bael trees, the general recommendation is 500-1000 g Nitrogen (N), 250-500 g Phosphorus (P2O5), and 500-1000 g Potassium (K2O) per tree per year. These can be supplied using the following conventional fertilizers:

*   **Urea (46% N):** 1.1 kg to 2.2 kg per tree per year. (This dose accounts for the Nitrogen supplied by **Diammonium Phosphate**).
*   **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP) (18% N, 46% P2O5):** 0.5 kg to 1.1 kg per tree per year.
*   **Muriate of Potash (MOP) (60% K2O):** 0.8 kg to 1.7 kg per tree per year.
*   **Single Super Phosphate (SSP) (16% P2O5, 11% S):** If **Diammonium Phosphate** is not used, or if Sulphur is specifically needed, **Single Super Phosphate** can be applied at 1.6 kg to 3.2 kg per tree per year to meet the Phosphorus requirement. If **Single Super Phosphate** is used, the **Urea** dose will need to be adjusted upwards to compensate for the Nitrogen not supplied by **Diammonium Phosphate**.

#### 3. NPK (Complex Fertilizers)

*   Various grades of NPK complex fertilizers (e.g., 10:26:26, 12:32:16, 19:19:19) can be used as per soil test recommendations to meet specific NPK requirements. The dose will vary significantly based on the grade and the target NPK. For example, to supply 500-1000g of each N, P2O5, K2O, approximately 2.6 kg to 5.3 kg of **NPK 19:19:19** per tree per year would be needed. However, using straight fertilizers often provides more flexibility and can be more economical.

#### 4. Nano-Urea and Nano-DAP (Foliar Application)

*   Nano-fertilizers are primarily used as supplements to conventional soil-applied fertilizers, especially for mature trees, and are not typically a complete replacement.
*   **Nano-Urea (Liquid 4% N):** Apply 2-4 ml per litre of water as a foliar spray. Two sprays are generally recommended: one at the pre-flowering stage and another at the fruit development stage.
*   **Nano-DAP (Liquid 8% N, 16% P2O5):** Apply 2-4 ml per litre of water as a foliar spray. Two sprays are generally recommended: one at the pre-flowering stage and another at the fruit development stage.

#### 5. Sulphur

*   Sulphur is an essential secondary nutrient for overall plant health and fruit quality. If not adequately supplied through **Single Super Phosphate** or other sources, it should be supplemented.
*   **Elemental Sulphur (90% S):** 50-100 g per tree per year, applied along with other basal fertilizers.
*   **Sulphate of Potash (SOP) (50% K2O, 18% S):** Can be used as an alternative to **Muriate of Potash** if Sulphur deficiency is observed or if chloride-free potassium is preferred. The dose would be 1.0 kg to 2.0 kg per tree per year to meet the K2O requirement, which would also supply Sulphur.

Always monitor your trees for signs of nutrient deficiencies or excesses and adjust your fertilizer program accordingly.
