As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm the following regarding rust diseases in Bael (*Aegle marmelos*):

*   **Black rust:** This is not known to affect Bael.
*   **Brown rust:** This is not known to affect Bael.
*   **Yellow rust:** This is not known to affect Bael.
*   **White rust:** This is not known to affect Bael.
*   **Red rust:** This is not known to affect Bael.

Bael is generally considered a hardy tree and is not commonly affected by these specific rust diseases in Haryana or other regions. Therefore, specific control measures for these rusts are not typically required for Bael cultivation.
