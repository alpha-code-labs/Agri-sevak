Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing pests in Bael (Aegle marmelos) in Haryana.

Here's how to control the mentioned pests:

### 1. Grasshopper

Grasshoppers can cause defoliation, especially on young plants.

*   **Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
    *   Regular monitoring of the orchard for early detection.
    *   Hand-picking and destroying grasshopper nymphs and adults, especially in small orchards.
    *   Deep ploughing during winter can expose and destroy grasshopper eggs laid in the soil.
    *   Encourage natural predators like birds by installing bird perches.

*   **Chemical Control (if infestation is severe):**
    *   **Malathion 50% EC:** Apply at 2.0 - 3.0 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** Apply at 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Quinalphos 25% EC:** Apply at 2.0 - 3.0 ml per litre of water.

### 2. Painted bug

This is not known to affect Bael. The painted bug (Bagrada hilaris) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops like mustard, cabbage, and radish.

### 3. Red cotton bug

This is not known to affect Bael. The red cotton bug (Dysdercus cingulatus) is primarily a pest of cotton and other malvaceous plants.

### 4. Black ants

Black ants are often secondary pests, attracted to the honeydew secreted by sap-sucking insects like aphids, mealybugs, or scales. They can also cause direct damage to young shoots or flowers in some cases.

*   **Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
    *   Maintain good orchard sanitation by removing weeds and debris that can harbor ants.
    *   Prune branches that touch the ground or other structures to prevent ants from easily accessing the tree canopy.
    *   If ants are tending to sap-sucking pests, the primary focus should be on controlling those pests.

*   **Chemical Control (if infestation is problematic):**
    *   **For controlling sap-sucking pests (if present and attracting ants):**
        *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **For direct ant control (e.g., ant nests, trails on the ground or tree trunk):**
        *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC:** For drenching ant nests or treating the base of the tree, apply at 5.0 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Fipronil 5% SC:** For drenching around the base of the tree or treating ant trails, apply at 1.0 - 1.5 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** For direct spray on ant trails or nests, apply at 0.5 ml per litre of water.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully, including dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during application.
*   Observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) for any applied chemicals to ensure the safety of the fruit.
*   Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approaches, combining cultural, mechanical, and biological methods with judicious use of chemicals, are always recommended for sustainable pest control.
