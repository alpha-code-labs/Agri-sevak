As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following for Bael transplantation in Haryana:

### Ideal Transplantation Time

The ideal time for transplanting Bael plants in Haryana is during the monsoon season or late winter/early spring:

*   **Monsoon Season:** July to August. This period benefits from natural rainfall, which aids in the establishment of the young plants.
*   **Late Winter/Early Spring:** February to March. This allows the plants to establish before the intense summer heat.

### Ideal Transplantation Distance

Bael trees are known for their robust growth and wide canopy. Proper spacing is crucial for optimal growth, light penetration, and ease of orchard management.

*   **Standard Spacing:** A spacing of **7 meters x 7 meters** (row to row and plant to plant) is generally recommended for Bael.
*   **Alternative Spacing:** For very vigorous varieties or specific management practices, **8 meters x 8 meters** can also be considered.

### Ideal Transplantation Process

The transplantation process involves several key steps to ensure successful establishment of Bael plants:

1.  **Pit Preparation:**
    *   Dig pits of **60 cm x 60 cm x 60 cm** size at the marked spacing at least 15-30 days before planting.
    *   Separate the topsoil from the subsoil.
    *   Allow the pits to remain open for a few days to expose them to sunlight and air, which helps in pest and disease control.
    *   Fill each pit with a mixture of topsoil, **15-20 kg** of well-decomposed Farmyard Manure (FYM) or compost, and **1 kg** of neem cake. Optionally, **100 g** of single super phosphate can be mixed in the bottom layer.

2.  **Plant Selection:**
    *   Use healthy, vigorous, and disease-free grafted plants (budded or inarched) from a reputable nursery. Grafted plants are preferred over seedlings for early fruiting and true-to-type characteristics.
    *   Ensure the plants are well-rooted in their polybags or containers.

3.  **Planting:**
    *   On the day of planting, make a small hole in the center of the prepared pit, large enough to accommodate the root ball of the plant.
    *   Carefully remove the plant from its polybag or container, ensuring the root ball remains intact and undisturbed.
    *   Place the plant in the center of the hole, ensuring that the graft union (if applicable) is about **10-15 cm** above the soil level.
    *   Backfill the pit with the remaining soil mixture, gently firming the soil around the base of the plant to remove air pockets.
    *   Create a small basin or ring around the plant for efficient irrigation.

4.  **Post-Planting Care:**
    *   Immediately after planting, irrigate the plant thoroughly to settle the soil around the roots.
    *   Provide staking to young plants if necessary, especially in windy areas, to prevent them from falling over.
    *   Protect young plants from direct sun during extreme summer months by providing temporary shade.
    *   Regularly monitor for pests and diseases and take appropriate measures.
    *   Keep the area around the plant weed-free.
