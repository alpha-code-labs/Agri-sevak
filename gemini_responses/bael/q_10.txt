As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for the control of pests in Bael (Aegle marmelos) in Haryana:

**1. Borers (Shoot and Fruit Borers):**
Borers can cause significant damage by tunneling into shoots, branches, and fruits, leading to wilting, dieback, and fruit spoilage.
*   **Cultural Control:** Regularly inspect Bael trees. Prune and destroy any affected shoots or branches showing signs of wilting, boreholes, or frass. Collect and destroy infested fruits promptly.
*   **Chemical Control:** For effective control, apply systemic insecticides when damage is observed.
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC** at 0.3 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG** at 0.2 g per litre of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC** at 1 ml per litre of water (effective against adult borers and surface feeding larvae).

**2. Caterpillars (Defoliating Caterpillars):**
Various species of caterpillars can feed on Bael leaves, leading to defoliation and reduced photosynthetic capacity.
*   **Chemical Control:** Apply insecticides targeting lepidopteran pests when caterpillar feeding is observed.
    *   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG** at 0.2 g per litre of water.
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC** at 0.3 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Flubendiamide 20% WG** at 0.5 g per litre of water.
    *   For biological control, especially against young larvae: **Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki** at 1-2 g per litre of water.

**3. Diamondback Moth:**
This is not known to affect Bael. Diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower, mustard).

**4. Leaf Folder:**
Leaf folders cause damage by folding leaves and feeding within the protective fold, hindering photosynthesis and overall plant health.
*   **Chemical Control:** Apply insecticides targeting lepidopteran pests when leaf folding is observed. Ensure thorough spray coverage to penetrate the folded leaves for effective control.
    *   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG** at 0.2 g per litre of water.
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC** at 0.3 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Indoxacarb 14.5% SC** at 0.5 ml per litre of water.

**General Recommendations:**
*   Always ensure thorough spray coverage for effective pest control.
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.
*   Strictly follow all safety precautions and label instructions when handling and applying pesticides.
*   Observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) for any applied pesticide, especially if fruits are nearing maturity, to ensure food safety.
