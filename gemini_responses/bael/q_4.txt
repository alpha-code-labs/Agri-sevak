Wilt, including Parawilt, is a serious concern for Bael cultivation in Haryana, often leading to significant plant mortality and yield losses. The primary cause of wilt in Bael is typically a fungal pathogen, *Fusarium oxysporum* f. sp. *belii*, which affects the vascular system. "Parawilt" often refers to a sudden wilting that can be triggered by a combination of factors including root damage, nutrient imbalances, water stress, or early stages of fungal infection, making an integrated management approach crucial.

Here's a scientifically verified approach for its control:

### Integrated Management Strategy for Wilt in Bael

An integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods is most effective for managing wilt.

#### 1. Cultural Practices:
*   **Resistant Rootstock/Varieties:** Where available, planting Bael on resistant rootstocks or using tolerant varieties can significantly reduce disease incidence. Consult with HAU for region-specific recommendations.
*   **Site Selection and Soil Preparation:**
    *   Choose well-drained soils. Avoid heavy clay soils prone to waterlogging.
    *   Improve soil structure and drainage by incorporating ample organic matter (e.g., well-decomposed farmyard manure or compost) at 10-15 kg per plant during planting.
    *   Ensure proper land leveling to prevent water stagnation around the tree base.
*   **Water Management:**
    *   Avoid over-irrigation, especially during the monsoon season or in heavy soils.
    *   Apply irrigation judiciously, ensuring the soil dries out slightly between irrigations.
    *   Use drip irrigation to deliver water directly to the root zone and minimize soil moisture fluctuations.
*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Maintain balanced nutrition. Potassium deficiency can sometimes exacerbate wilt symptoms. Conduct soil testing to determine specific nutrient requirements.
    *   Avoid excessive nitrogen application, which can promote lush growth susceptible to disease.
*   **Sanitation:**
    *   Remove and destroy severely infected plants or plant parts immediately to prevent the spread of inoculum.
    *   Disinfect pruning tools with a 1% sodium hypochlorite solution or 70% alcohol before moving from one tree to another.
    *   Avoid planting Bael in fields with a history of severe wilt for at least 3-5 years.
*   **Weed Control:** Keep the area around the tree base free of weeds, which can compete for nutrients and harbor pests or diseases.

#### 2. Biological Control:
Biological agents can help suppress the pathogen in the soil and promote plant health.
*   **Soil Application:**
    *   **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum**: Apply 50-100 g of bio-fungicide formulation (containing 2x10^6 CFU/g) per plant, mixed with 5-10 kg of well-decomposed farmyard manure or compost. Apply near the root zone at the time of planting and annually thereafter.
    *   **Pseudomonas fluorescens**: Apply 50-100 g of bio-bactericide formulation (containing 2x10^8 CFU/g) per plant, mixed with 5-10 kg of well-decomposed farmyard manure or compost. This can be used in conjunction with *Trichoderma*.
*   **Drenching:**
    *   Prepare a suspension of **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum** at 5-10 g/L of water and drench the soil around the affected plants. Repeat every 2-3 months, especially during periods of high humidity or stress.

#### 3. Chemical Control:
Chemical fungicides should be used judiciously, primarily as soil drenching treatments, especially at the first sign of symptoms. Always follow label instructions for application rates and safety precautions.

*   **For Soil Drenching (at the base of the plant):**
    *   **Carbendazim 50% WP**: Drench the soil around the affected plant with a solution of **Carbendazim** at 1-2 g/L of water. For a mature tree, apply 10-15 litres of the solution depending on the canopy size. Repeat after 15-20 days if symptoms persist.
    *   **Thiophanate-methyl 70% WP**: Drench the soil around the affected plant with a solution of **Thiophanate-methyl** at 1-2 g/L of water. Apply 10-15 litres per mature tree. Repeat after 15-20 days if necessary.
    *   **Propiconazole 25% EC**: Drench the soil around the affected plant with a solution of **Propiconazole** at 0.5-1 ml/L of water. Apply 10-15 litres per mature tree. Repeat after 15-20 days if necessary.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Early Detection:** Monitor plants regularly for early symptoms like yellowing of leaves, drooping, or wilting of branches. Early intervention is key to successful management.
*   **Rotation of Chemicals:** To prevent the development of fungicide resistance, rotate between different classes of fungicides (e.g., Carbendazim and Propiconazole).
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) while handling and applying chemicals.

By implementing these integrated strategies, Bael growers in Haryana can effectively manage wilt and parawilt, ensuring healthier trees and better yields.
