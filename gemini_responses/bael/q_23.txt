As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified seed and soil treatment processes for Bael (Aegle marmelos) cultivation in Haryana:

### Seed Treatment Process for Bael

Seed treatment is crucial for protecting Bael seeds from seed-borne pathogens and improving germination, especially in nursery conditions where damping-off can be a significant issue.

**Objective:** To prevent fungal diseases (e.g., damping-off, seedling blight) and enhance seedling vigor.

**Recommended Treatments:**

1.  **Biological Treatment (Preferred for organic cultivation and IPM):**
    *   **Process:** Mix the seeds thoroughly with the biological agent before sowing.
    *   **Agents and Dosages:**
        *   **Trichoderma viride** (Bio-fungicide): 5-10 g per kg of Bael seeds.
        *   **Pseudomonas fluorescens** (Bio-fungicide): 10 g per kg of Bael seeds.
    *   **Method:** Prepare a slurry by mixing the bio-agent with a small amount of water. Coat the seeds evenly and allow them to dry in the shade before sowing.

2.  **Chemical Treatment (If biological options are not sufficient or disease pressure is high):**
    *   **Process:** Mix the seeds thoroughly with the fungicide before sowing.
    *   **Agents and Dosages:**
        *   **Carbendazim** (Fungicide): 1-2 g per kg of Bael seeds.
        *   **Thiram** (Fungicide): 2-3 g per kg of Bael seeds.
    *   **Method:** Mix the fungicide powder directly with the seeds in a container or plastic bag until all seeds are uniformly coated. Sow immediately after treatment.

### Soil Treatment Process for Bael

Soil treatment aims to control soil-borne diseases, nematodes, and insect pests (like termites) that can affect Bael plants, particularly during the nursery stage and initial establishment in the field.

**A. Nursery Soil Treatment (for raising seedlings in beds or polybags):**

**Objective:** To prevent damping-off, root rot, and early nematode infestation.

**Recommended Treatments:**

1.  **Biological Treatment (Preferred for organic cultivation and IPM):**
    *   **Process:** Mix the bio-agent with the nursery soil/potting mix before sowing/planting, or apply as a drench.
    *   **Agents and Dosages:**
        *   **Trichoderma viride** (Bio-fungicide): 2.5 kg per cubic meter of nursery soil/potting mix, or 5-10 g per square meter of nursery bed, mixed thoroughly. Alternatively, drench with a solution of 5 g/L water.
        *   **Pseudomonas fluorescens** (Bio-fungicide): 2.5 kg per cubic meter of nursery soil/potting mix, or 5-10 g per square meter of nursery bed, mixed thoroughly. Alternatively, drench with a solution of 10 g/L water.
    *   **Method:** Mix the bio-agent with well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost (1:10 ratio) and incorporate into the soil 7-10 days before sowing/planting. For drenching, apply the solution around the base of seedlings.

2.  **Chemical Treatment (If biological options are not sufficient or disease pressure is high):**
    *   **Process:** Apply as a soil drench.
    *   **Agent and Dosage:**
        *   **Carbendazim** (Fungicide): 1-2 g per liter of water.
    *   **Method:** Drench the nursery beds or polybags with the solution immediately after sowing or transplanting, and repeat if necessary, especially if symptoms of damping-off or root rot appear.

**B. Field Soil Treatment (for planting Bael saplings):**

**Objective:** To protect newly planted saplings from root rot, nematodes, and termites.

**Recommended Treatments:**

1.  **Biological Treatment (Preferred for organic cultivation and IPM):**
    *   **Process:** Apply the bio-agent in the planting pit or around the base of established plants.
    *   **Agents and Dosages:**
        *   **Trichoderma viride** (Bio-fungicide): 50-100 g per planting pit, mixed with soil and FYM. For established trees, 250-500 g per tree, mixed with FYM and applied in the root zone.
        *   **Pseudomonas fluorescens** (Bio-fungicide): 50-100 g per planting pit, mixed with soil and FYM. For established trees, 250-500 g per tree, mixed with FYM and applied in the root zone.
        *   **Purpureocillium lilacinum** (Bio-nematicide): 50-100 g per planting pit, mixed with soil and FYM, especially in areas with known nematode problems. For established trees, 250-500 g per tree, mixed with FYM and applied in the root zone.
    *   **Method:** Mix the bio-agent with well-decomposed FYM or compost (1:10 ratio) and apply in the planting pit before placing the sapling. For existing trees, apply in a trench dug around the root zone and cover with soil. Ensure adequate soil moisture.

2.  **Chemical Treatment (If biological options are not sufficient or pest/disease pressure is high):**
    *   **Process:** Apply in the planting pit or as a drench.
    *   **Agents and Dosages:**
        *   **For Fungal Diseases (e.g., Root Rot):**
            *   **Carbendazim** (Fungicide): 2-3 g per liter of water, as a drench around the base of the plant, or 50-100 g per planting pit mixed with soil.
        *   **For Termites (Pre-planting treatment):**
            *   **Chlorpyrifos** (Insecticide): 2.5 ml per liter of water.
            *   **Method:** Drench the planting pit thoroughly with 5-10 liters of the solution before planting the sapling. Ensure the soil is moist. This provides a protective barrier against termites for young plants.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always ensure proper drainage in both nursery beds and field planting sites to prevent waterlogging, which exacerbates root rot diseases.
*   Maintain good field sanitation and remove diseased plant material.
*   For chemical treatments, always read and follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions on the product label.
*   Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining biological, cultural, and judicious chemical methods, is highly recommended for sustainable Bael cultivation.
