Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following doses of organic manures for Bael (Aegle marmelos) cultivation in Haryana to ensure healthy growth and good yield:

### Recommended Doses of Organic Manures for Bael

**1. Farm Yard Manure (FYM)**
FYM is a fundamental organic amendment, providing essential nutrients and improving soil structure.
*   **Young Plants (1-3 years old):**
    *   **10-20 kg** per plant per year.
*   **Bearing Plants (4 years and above):**
    *   **25-50 kg** per plant per year.
*   **Application:** Apply in a ring around the tree canopy, 30-60 cm away from the trunk, and mix thoroughly with the soil. It can be applied in a single dose during September-October or split into two doses (September-October and January-February).

**2. Vermicompost**
Vermicompost is a nutrient-rich organic fertilizer produced by earthworms, offering a more concentrated form of nutrients than FYM.
*   **Young Plants (1-3 years old):**
    *   **2-5 kg** per plant per year.
*   **Bearing Plants (4 years and above):**
    *   **5-10 kg** per plant per year.
*   **Application:** Can be applied along with FYM or as a partial replacement. Apply in the same manner as FYM, typically during September-October or January-February.

**3. Sagarika (Seaweed Extract based Biostimulant)**
Sagarika is a commercially available biostimulant derived from seaweed (Ascophyllum nodosum), known to enhance plant growth, nutrient uptake, and stress tolerance.
*   **Granular (Soil Application):**
    *   **Young Plants:** **50-100 g** per plant.
    *   **Bearing Plants:** **100-200 g** per plant.
    *   **Frequency:** Apply once or twice a year, during active growth phases (e.g., pre-flowering, fruit development), near the root zone and mix with soil.
*   **Liquid (Foliar Spray):**
    *   **Concentration:** **2.5-5 ml** per litre of water.
    *   **Frequency:** 2-3 sprays during critical growth stages such as vegetative flush, pre-flowering, fruit set, and fruit development.

**General Recommendations:**
*   Always ensure proper irrigation immediately after applying organic manures to facilitate nutrient dissolution and uptake by the roots.
*   Regular soil testing is highly recommended to understand the specific nutrient status of your orchard and to fine-tune the manure application rates for optimal plant health and productivity.
