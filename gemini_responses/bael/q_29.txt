As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling dropping in Bael (Aegle marmelos).

Firstly, it's important to clarify that Bael is a fruit tree and does not produce "Tinda" (Indian round gourd) or "Bolls" (cotton fruit). The advice below pertains specifically to flower and fruit drop in Bael.

Flower and fruit drop in Bael can be attributed to several physiological, nutritional, and environmental factors. Understanding these causes is crucial for effective management.

**Common Causes of Flower and Fruit Drop in Bael:**

1.  **Physiological Drop:** Natural shedding of excess flowers and young fruits is a common phenomenon in many fruit trees, including Bael, to regulate the crop load and ensure the development of a manageable number of fruits.
2.  **Nutritional Deficiencies:** Lack of essential micronutrients like Boron and Zinc, or an imbalance of macronutrients (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium), can severely impact flower and fruit retention.
3.  **Water Stress:** Both insufficient (drought) and excessive (waterlogging) soil moisture can stress the plant, leading to abscission of flowers and young fruits.
4.  **Hormonal Imbalance:** An imbalance of plant hormones, particularly low levels of auxins and gibberellins, or high levels of abscisic acid and ethylene, can trigger the formation of an abscission layer, leading to dropping.
5.  **Environmental Stress:** High temperatures, strong winds, sudden temperature fluctuations, or prolonged cloudy weather during flowering can contribute to dropping.
6.  **Pest and Disease Damage:** While less common as a direct cause of dropping, severe infestations or infections can weaken the tree, indirectly leading to flower and fruit drop.

**Control Measures for Flower and Fruit Drop in Bael:**

To effectively manage dropping, an integrated approach focusing on optimal plant health and specific interventions is recommended:

1.  **Nutritional Management:**
    *   **Balanced Fertilization:** Ensure the tree receives adequate and balanced NPK (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium) based on soil test recommendations. For mature Bael trees, a general recommendation is 250-500 g Nitrogen, 125-250 g Phosphorus, and 250-500 g Potassium per tree per year, applied in split doses.
    *   **Micronutrient Application:** Deficiencies of Boron and Zinc are often linked to poor fruit set and retention.
        *   Foliar spray of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** at 1-1.5 g/L water or **Boric acid** at 1 g/L water, applied at the pre-flowering and early fruit set stages.
        *   Foliar spray of **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** at 3-5 g/L water, applied at the pre-flowering and early fruit set stages.
        *   Alternatively, use CIBRC-approved multi-micronutrient formulations containing Zinc, Boron, Iron, Manganese, and Copper as per manufacturer's recommendations (e.g., 2-3 ml/L or 2-3 g/L water).

2.  **Water Management:**
    *   **Optimal Irrigation:** Maintain consistent soil moisture, especially during the critical stages of flowering and fruit development. Avoid both drought stress and waterlogging. Irrigate deeply when the topsoil begins to dry, but allow for proper drainage.
    *   **Mulching:** Apply a layer of organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves, crop residues) 10-15 cm thick around the base of the tree, keeping it away from the trunk. This helps conserve soil moisture, regulate soil temperature, and suppress weeds.

3.  **Hormonal Regulation (Plant Growth Regulators - PGRs):**
    *   **Naphthalene acetic acid (NAA):** This synthetic auxin helps prevent the formation of the abscission layer, thereby reducing fruit drop.
        *   Foliar spray of **Naphthalene acetic acid** at 10-20 mg/L (0.01-0.02 g/L water) at full bloom and again 15-20 days later when fruits are pea-sized.
    *   **Gibberellic acid (GA3):** Can improve fruit set and retention.
        *   Foliar spray of **Gibberellic acid** at 25-50 mg/L (0.025-0.05 g/L water) at the pre-flowering and early fruit set stages.

4.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Windbreaks:** If your orchard is exposed to strong winds, planting windbreak trees around the periphery can significantly reduce physical stress on flowers and young fruits, thereby minimizing wind-induced drop.
    *   **Pruning:** Light pruning to remove dead, diseased, or overcrowded branches can improve air circulation and light penetration, contributing to overall tree vigor and health.

5.  **Pest and Disease Management:**
    *   Regularly monitor your Bael trees for any signs of pests or diseases. While not a primary cause of dropping, severe infestations or infections can weaken the tree and indirectly lead to flower and fruit drop. Implement timely and appropriate control measures using CIBRC-approved pesticides or fungicides as per HAU recommendations, if necessary.

By implementing these scientifically verified practices, you can significantly reduce flower and fruit drop in your Bael trees and ensure a healthier, more productive yield.
