As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide scientifically verified advice on addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies in Bael (Aegle marmelos) for the conditions prevalent in Haryana.

The most crucial first step in addressing any nutrient deficiency is a **soil test**. A comprehensive soil analysis will accurately determine the existing nutrient levels and pH, allowing for precise and efficient fertilizer recommendations, preventing over-application and nutrient imbalances. The following recommendations are general guidelines for bearing Bael trees and should be adjusted based on soil test results and tree age. Young trees require proportionally less.

### General Recommendations for Macro-nutrient Application in Bael

*   **Application Method:** Fertilizers should generally be applied in a ring around the tree, 30-60 cm away from the trunk, extending to the drip line. Lightly incorporate the fertilizer into the soil and irrigate immediately.
*   **Timing:** For bearing trees, it is advisable to apply fertilizers in 2-3 split doses. A common practice is to apply one dose after fruit harvest (e.g., May-June) and another before flowering (e.g., January-February).

### Addressing Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

Nitrogen deficiency is characterized by general yellowing (chlorosis) of older leaves, stunted growth, and reduced fruit set and size.

*   **Remedy (Soil Application per bearing tree per year):**
    *   Apply 200-400 g of actual Nitrogen (N) per tree. This can be supplied through:
        *   **Urea**: 450-900 g per tree, applied in 2-3 split doses.
        *   **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)**: If Phosphorus is also deficient, DAP can contribute Nitrogen (18% N).

### Addressing Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

Phosphorus deficiency can manifest as stunted growth, dark green or purplish discoloration of older leaves, poor root development, delayed maturity, and reduced fruit quality and yield.

*   **Remedy (Soil Application per bearing tree per year):**
    *   Apply 100-250 g of actual Phosphorus (P2O5) per tree. This can be supplied through:
        *   **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)**: 220-550 g per tree, typically applied as a basal dose or in early splits.
        *   **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)**: 625-1560 g per tree, typically applied as a basal dose.

### Addressing Potassium (K) Deficiency

Potassium deficiency symptoms include scorching or browning of leaf margins (especially older leaves), poor fruit development, reduced fruit size, and lower resistance to diseases and stress.

*   **Remedy (Soil Application per bearing tree per year):**
    *   Apply 100-250 g of actual Potassium (K2O) per tree. This can be supplied through:
        *   **Muriate of Potash (MOP)**: 170-420 g per tree, applied in 2 split doses.

### Additional Considerations:

*   **Organic Matter:** Regular incorporation of farmyard manure (FYM) or compost (10-20 kg per tree per year for mature trees) significantly improves soil health, nutrient retention, and microbial activity, enhancing nutrient availability.
*   **Irrigation:** Adequate and timely irrigation is essential for nutrient uptake by the roots.
*   **pH Management:** Ensure soil pH is within the optimal range (6.0-7.5) for Bael, as extreme pH can lock up nutrients, making them unavailable to the plant even if present in the soil.

Always consult your latest soil test report for precise recommendations tailored to your specific field conditions.
