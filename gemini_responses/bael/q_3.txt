Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding the various rot diseases in Bael (Aegle marmelos). These rots, including Root, Stem, Foot, Collar, Crown, Neck, Black, Fruit, Seed, and Seedling rot, are primarily caused by a complex of fungal and oomycete pathogens, often exacerbated by environmental factors like excessive moisture.

Effective control requires an Integrated Disease Management (IDM) approach, combining cultural practices, biological methods, and judicious use of CIBRC-approved chemicals.

### Integrated Disease Management for Rot Control in Bael:

**1. Cultural and Horticultural Practices (Prevention is Key):**

*   **Site Selection and Soil Management:**
    *   Plant Bael in well-drained soils. Avoid heavy clay soils prone to waterlogging.
    *   If soil drainage is poor, plant on raised beds or mounds to prevent water accumulation around the root zone and collar region.
*   **Water Management:**
    *   Avoid over-irrigation, especially during periods of high humidity or cool weather.
    *   Use drip irrigation to deliver water directly to the root zone, minimizing wetting of the stem base and foliage.
    *   Ensure proper drainage in the orchard to prevent standing water.
*   **Sanitation:**
    *   Regularly inspect plants for any signs of rot.
    *   Promptly remove and destroy all infected plant parts (leaves, branches, fruits, fallen debris) to reduce inoculum sources.
    *   Sterilize pruning tools between cuts, especially when working on infected trees.
*   **Pruning:**
    *   Prune trees to ensure good air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce humidity and fungal growth.
    *   Remove dead or diseased branches.
*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Provide balanced nutrition to enhance plant vigor and natural resistance. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can promote lush, susceptible growth.
*   **Weed Control:**
    *   Keep the area around the base of the Bael trees free of weeds to improve air circulation and reduce humidity.
*   **Avoid Injury:**
    *   Prevent mechanical injuries to the roots, stem, and collar region during cultivation, as these can serve as entry points for pathogens.

**2. Biological Control:**

*   **For Soil-borne Rots (Root, Collar, Stem, Seedling Rot):**
    *   **Trichoderma viride:** Apply as a soil drench (5-10 g/L water) around the base of the plants or mix with farmyard manure (1-2 kg/acre) and incorporate into the soil.
    *   **Pseudomonas fluorescens:** Apply as a soil drench (5-10 ml/L water) or mix with farmyard manure (1-2 kg/acre) and incorporate into the soil.
    *   **For Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds with **Trichoderma viride** or **Pseudomonas fluorescens** (4-5 g or ml/kg seed) before sowing to protect against seed and seedling rots.

**3. Chemical Control (Using CIBRC Approved Technical Names):**

*   **For Root Rot, Collar Rot, Foot Rot, Stem Rot, Crown Rot, Neck Rot:**
    *   **Soil Drenching:** Apply around the base of the affected plants, ensuring the solution penetrates the root zone.
        *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride 72.2% SL:** 2-3 ml/L water.
        *   **Metalaxyl 8% + Mancozeb 64% WP:** 2.5 g/L water.
        *   **Fosetyl-aluminium 80% WP:** 2.5 g/L water.
        *   **Carbendazim 50% WP:** 1-2 g/L water.
        *   **Thiophanate-methyl 70% WP:** 1-1.5 g/L water.
    *   Repeat application after 10-15 days if symptoms persist or conditions remain favorable for disease development.

*   **For Fruit Rot and Black Rot:**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Ensure thorough coverage of fruits and foliage. Start sprays preventively during susceptible stages (flowering, fruit set) or at the first sign of disease.
        *   **Mancozeb 75% WP:** 2.5 g/L water.
        *   **Carbendazim 50% WP:** 1-1.5 g/L water.
        *   **Propiconazole 25% EC:** 0.5 ml/L water.
        *   **Hexaconazole 5% SC:** 1 ml/L water.
        *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:** 0.5 ml/L water.
        *   **Tebuconazole 25.9% EC:** 0.75 ml/L water.
    *   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

*   **For Seed Rot and Seedling Rot (Damping-off):**
    *   **Seed Treatment (before sowing):**
        *   **Captan 50% WP:** 2-3 g/kg seed.
        *   **Thiram 75% WS:** 2-3 g/kg seed.
        *   **Carbendazim 50% WP:** 1-2 g/kg seed.
    *   **Soil Drench (for nursery beds, if damping-off occurs):**
        *   **Metalaxyl 8% + Mancozeb 64% WP:** 2.5 g/L water.
        *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride 72.2% SL:** 2-3 ml/L water.
        *   **Carbendazim 50% WP:** 1-2 g/L water.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the product label for dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest intervals (PHI).
*   The timing of application is crucial for effective disease control.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension specialist for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and the prevailing disease pressure in your area.

By implementing these integrated strategies, you can effectively manage and control various rot diseases in your Bael orchard.
