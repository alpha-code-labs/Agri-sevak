As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), here are the recommended cultivation practices for Bael (Aegle marmelos) in Haryana, focusing on seed propagation:

While Bael can be propagated by seeds, for commercial cultivation, vegetative methods like budding or grafting are often preferred to ensure true-to-type plants, early fruiting, and uniform quality. However, for raising rootstock or if specific varieties are not available vegetatively, seed propagation is commonly used.

**Cultivation Practices for Bael (Seed Propagation):**

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   Bael seeds are typically sown in nursery beds or individual polybags (15 cm x 25 cm) for raising seedlings.
    *   For nursery beds, seeds can be sown in lines approximately 10-15 cm apart, or broadcast thinly. Line sowing is generally preferred as it facilitates weeding, irrigation, and management of seedlings.
    *   In polybags, sow 1-2 seeds per bag.
    *   It is crucial to sow fresh seeds, as their viability decreases rapidly with storage.
*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   Sow the seeds at a shallow depth of **1-2 cm**. Deeper sowing can hinder germination.
*   **Spacing (for main field planting of seedlings/grafts):**
    *   Once the seedlings are ready (usually 1-2 years old for rootstock, or budded/grafted plants), they are transplanted to the main field.
    *   The recommended spacing for Bael trees in the main field is generally **7 meters x 7 meters** to **8 meters x 8 meters**. This spacing allows for optimal canopy development, light penetration, and ease of cultural operations.
*   **Seed Dose (for raising seedlings in nursery):**
    *   The quantity of seeds required depends on the desired number of plants and the germination percentage, which can be variable (often 50-70%).
    *   To plant one acre (approximately 0.4 hectares) with a spacing of 7m x 7m, you would need about 204 plants.
    *   To ensure a sufficient number of healthy seedlings for one acre, it is advisable to sow seeds extracted from approximately **2-3 kg of fresh Bael fruits**, accounting for germination failure and the selection of vigorous seedlings for transplanting.
