As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding Bael fruit maturity, harvesting, and cutting processes for Haryana:

### Maturity Signs for Bael (Aegle marmelos)

Identifying the correct maturity stage is crucial for optimal fruit quality and shelf life. Look for the following indicators:

*   **Color Change:** The most prominent sign is the change in fruit skin color from a dark green to a dull yellowish-green or pale yellow. Some varieties may show a more pronounced yellowing.
*   **Hardness:** The fruit becomes very hard and woody to the touch.
*   **Sound:** When tapped gently with a finger, a mature Bael fruit produces a distinct hollow sound.
*   **Size:** The fruit attains its full characteristic size and weight for the specific variety.
*   **Days from Flowering:** Bael fruits typically take 10-11 months from flowering to reach full maturity.

### Harvesting Time for Bael

In Haryana, Bael trees generally flower during April-May. Considering the 10-11 month maturation period, the harvesting season typically falls in:

*   **Months:** March to May of the following year.
*   **Peak Season:** April-May is generally the peak harvesting period when most fruits reach optimal maturity.

### Cutting Process for Bael

Proper harvesting techniques are essential to prevent damage to the fruit and the tree, ensuring better post-harvest quality.

*   **Tools:** Use sharp and clean harvesting tools such as secateurs, pruning shears, or a sharp knife. This ensures a clean cut and minimizes damage to the fruit stalk and the tree branch.
*   **Cutting Point:** Cut the fruit stalk (pedicel) leaving a small portion (approximately 1-2 cm) attached to the fruit. This small piece of stalk helps in better storage and reduces the risk of pathogen entry through the stem end, thereby extending shelf life.
*   **Careful Handling:** Bael fruits are hard but can crack or get bruised if dropped or handled roughly. Harvested fruits should be carefully placed in padded containers to prevent physical damage.
*   **Avoid Pulling:** Do not pull the fruit directly from the branch, as this can damage the fruit stalk, the fruit itself, or even the fruiting branch, potentially affecting future yields.
