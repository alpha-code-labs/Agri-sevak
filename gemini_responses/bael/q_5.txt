As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Scab, Canker, Gummosis, and Lichen in Bael (Aegle marmelos) in Haryana:

### Control Measures for Diseases and Conditions in Bael

**1. Scab**
Bael can be affected by scab, often caused by fungal pathogens similar to those causing citrus scab.
*   **Symptoms:** Raised, corky lesions on leaves, twigs, and fruits.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   Prune and destroy infected twigs and leaves to reduce inoculum.
    *   Ensure proper air circulation within the canopy.
    *   Apply fungicides preventively during periods of new flush growth and fruit set.
    *   **Fungicides:**
        *   **Copper oxychloride**: Spray at 3 g/L of water.
        *   **Mancozeb**: Spray at 2 g/L of water.

**2. Canker**
Bael is susceptible to bacterial canker, primarily caused by *Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri*.
*   **Symptoms:** Raised, corky lesions with a water-soaked margin, often surrounded by a yellow halo, on leaves, stems, and fruits.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   Prune and destroy all infected branches, twigs, and leaves. Disinfect pruning tools with a 10% bleach solution or methylated spirit after each cut.
    *   Avoid working in the orchard when trees are wet, as this can spread the bacteria.
    *   Protect trees from injuries caused by wind, insects, or mechanical means, as wounds provide entry points for the bacteria.
    *   **Bactericides:**
        *   **Copper oxychloride**: Spray at 3 g/L of water. Repeat sprays may be necessary, especially after new flushes or rainfall.

**3. Gummosis**
Gummosis is a common problem in Bael, often associated with *Phytophthora* species or other fungal pathogens, or even physiological stress.
*   **Symptoms:** Exudation of gum from the bark, often accompanied by bark discoloration, cracking, and cankers on the trunk and main branches.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   Improve soil drainage around the tree base. Avoid waterlogging.
    *   Avoid mechanical injuries to the trunk and roots.
    *   Keep the area around the tree base clean and free of weeds.
    *   **Treatment of affected areas:**
        *   Carefully scrape off the affected bark until healthy tissue is exposed.
        *   Apply a fungicidal paste to the scraped area.
        *   **Copper oxychloride**: Prepare a paste by mixing 100 g of **Copper oxychloride** with 100 g of lime in 1 litre of water (Bordeaux paste equivalent) and apply to the affected trunk area.
        *   **Fungicides (for drench or foliar spray):**
            *   **Potassium phosphonate**: Drench the soil around the tree base or spray foliage at 2-3 ml/L of water.

**4. Lichen**
Lichens are symbiotic organisms (a fungus and an alga) that grow on the bark of trees.
*   **Symptoms:** Crusty, leafy, or bushy growths on the bark of the trunk and branches.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   Lichens are **not parasitic** and generally do not harm the Bael tree. They do not draw nutrients from the tree but rather use the bark as a substrate. Their presence often indicates good air quality and can be a sign of an older or less vigorous tree, or high humidity.
    *   Direct control is usually not necessary. If removal is desired for aesthetic reasons or to improve air circulation around the bark, a very dilute copper spray can help dislodge them.
    *   **Copper oxychloride**: A very dilute spray at 1 g/L of water can be applied to the affected bark to help dislodge lichens, if desired. However, this is generally not recommended as a routine practice due to the harmless nature of lichens. Focus on improving overall tree health and vigor.
