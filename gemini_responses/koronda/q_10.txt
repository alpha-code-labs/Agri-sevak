As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in Koronda (Carissa carandas) in Haryana:

### Control of Borers, Caterpillars, Diamondback Moth, and Leaf Folder in Koronda

**1. Borers:**
This is not known to affect Koronda as a primary or significant pest in the region.

**2. Caterpillars (Defoliating Caterpillars):**
Various species of defoliating caterpillars can feed on Koronda leaves.

*   **Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
    *   Regularly inspect plants for caterpillar presence.
    *   Hand-pick and destroy caterpillars, especially in smaller orchards.
    *   Remove and destroy affected leaves or shoots containing egg masses or young larvae.
*   **Biological Control:**
    *   Apply formulations of **Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)** at the rate of 1-2 g/L of water, especially effective against young larvae.
*   **Chemical Control (Apply only if infestation is severe and other methods are insufficient):**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** 0.3 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG:** 0.2-0.25 g per litre of water.
    *   **Flubendiamide 20% WG:** 0.25-0.3 g per litre of water.
    *   **Indoxacarb 14.5% SC:** 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Spinosad 45% SC:** 0.16 ml per litre of water.

**3. Diamondback Moth (DBM):**
This is not known to affect Koronda. Diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops.

**4. Leaf Folder:**
Leaf folders can cause damage by rolling or folding leaves and feeding from within, affecting photosynthesis.

*   **Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
    *   Regular monitoring for folded leaves.
    *   Prune and destroy infested leaves or shoots to remove larvae.
*   **Chemical Control (Apply only if infestation is severe):**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** 0.3 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG:** 0.2-0.25 g per litre of water.
    *   **Flubendiamide 20% WG:** 0.25-0.3 g per litre of water.
    *   **Indoxacarb 14.5% SC:** 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** 0.5 ml per litre of water.

**General Recommendations for Chemical Application:**

*   Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage, especially the undersides of leaves.
*   Use appropriate spray volume, typically 200-400 litres of water per acre, depending on the plant size and canopy density.
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label for safe and effective use, including pre-harvest intervals (PHI).
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.
*   Apply pesticides during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
