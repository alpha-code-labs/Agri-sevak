Namaste,

Scale insects and mealybugs are common sap-sucking pests that can affect Koronda (Carissa carandas) plants, leading to reduced vigour, yellowing of leaves, stunted growth, and sometimes sooty mould development. Effective management involves an integrated approach.

Here is the scientifically verified advice for controlling these pests in Koronda:

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   **Pruning:** Regularly inspect plants and prune off heavily infested branches, twigs, or leaves. Dispose of infested material properly to prevent further spread.
*   **Manual Removal:** For small infestations, mealybugs and scale insects can be physically removed using a strong jet of water or by wiping them off with a cloth dipped in soapy water.
*   **Ant Management:** Ants often protect mealybugs and scales to harvest their honeydew. Control ant populations around the plants to allow natural enemies to work effectively.
*   **Sanitation:** Keep the area around the plants clean and free of weeds, which can harbour pests.

**2. Biological Control:**
*   Encourage natural enemies such as ladybird beetles (e.g., *Cryptolaemus montrouzieri* for mealybugs), lacewings, and parasitic wasps. These predators and parasitoids can significantly reduce pest populations. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

**3. Chemical Control (Use only CIBRC approved technical chemicals):**
For moderate to severe infestations, chemical intervention may be necessary. Apply insecticides when pests are in their younger, more vulnerable stages (crawlers for scales, nymphs for mealybugs). Ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and in plant crevices.

*   **For Scale Insects and Mealybugs:**
    *   **Buprofezin** 25% SC: Apply at a concentration of 1.25 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: Apply at a concentration of 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: Apply at a concentration of 0.3 g per litre of water.
    *   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP: Apply at a concentration of 0.2 g per litre of water.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Rotation:** Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.
*   **Timing:** Apply insecticides preferably in the early morning or late evening to minimize impact on beneficial insects and reduce phytotoxicity.
*   **Safety:** Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the pesticide label regarding dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI). Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application.

By integrating these methods, you can effectively manage scale insects and mealybugs in your Koronda plants.
