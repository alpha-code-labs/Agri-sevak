As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned conditions in Koronda (Carissa carandas) in Haryana:

**1. Scab in Koronda:**
This is not known to affect Koronda.

**2. Canker in Koronda:**
Canker-like symptoms, often appearing as sunken, discolored lesions on stems and branches, can occur due to various factors including fungal infections or physical injury. Management focuses on sanitation and protection.

*   **Pruning:** Carefully prune out all affected branches and twigs, cutting well into healthy wood. Ensure pruning tools are sterilized with a 10% bleach solution or methylated spirit before and after each cut to prevent disease spread.
*   **Wound Protection:** After pruning, apply a protective paste to larger cuts.
*   **Fungicidal Spray:** In cases of severe infection or as a preventive measure, especially after pruning, a spray can be applied.
    *   Spray with **Copper Oxychloride** at 2.5-3.0 g/L of water. Ensure thorough coverage of the plant, especially affected areas.

**3. Gummosis in Koronda:**
Gummosis is the exudation of gum from the bark, often indicating stress, injury, or underlying fungal infections (e.g., *Phytophthora* species) or bacterial diseases.

*   **Identify and Address Cause:** Inspect the plant for physical injuries, poor drainage, or pest infestations that might be contributing factors. Improve soil drainage if waterlogging is an issue.
*   **Scraping and Painting:** Gently scrape off the gum and affected bark until healthy tissue is exposed. Disinfect the wound.
*   **Fungicidal Application:**
    *   Apply a paste of **Copper Oxychloride** (50 g in 100 ml water) directly to the scraped area.
    *   For systemic protection, especially if root or collar rot is suspected, drench the soil around the base of the plant with **Fosetyl-aluminium** at 2.0-3.0 g/L of water, or **Propamocarb hydrochloride** at 2.0-3.0 ml/L of water. The quantity of drench depends on the plant size, typically 2-5 litres per plant.

**4. Lichen in Koronda:**
Lichens are symbiotic organisms (fungus and alga) that grow on the bark of trees. They are epiphytes and are generally harmless to the Koronda plant itself, as they do not parasitize the tree or draw nutrients from it. Their presence often indicates good air quality and a healthy, slow-growing environment.

*   **No Control Needed:** Control measures are generally not required for lichens as they do not cause disease or significant harm to the plant.
*   **If Removal is Desired (for aesthetic reasons):**
    *   **Physical Removal:** Gently brush off the lichens from the bark using a stiff brush, especially during dry weather.
    *   **Mild Spray (Use with Caution):** A very dilute spray of **Copper Oxychloride** at 1.0 g/L of water can be applied during the dormant period, but this is usually unnecessary and should be used sparingly to avoid any potential phytotoxicity to the plant.
