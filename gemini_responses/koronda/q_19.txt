As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified approach to address macro-nutrient deficiencies (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium) in Koronda (Carissa carandas) in Haryana.

**Crucial First Step: Soil Testing**
Before applying any fertilizers, it is paramount to conduct a soil test. This will accurately determine the existing nutrient levels in your specific field and help tailor the fertilizer application rates, preventing over-application and nutrient imbalances. Contact your nearest Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or HAU extension center for soil testing services.

**General Management Practices:**
*   Ensure proper irrigation and drainage.
*   Maintain good soil organic matter content through farmyard manure (FYM) or compost application (5-10 kg per plant annually for mature plants). This improves nutrient retention and availability.

### Addressing Macro-nutrient Deficiencies in Koronda:

**1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency**

*   **Symptoms:** General yellowing (chlorosis) of older leaves, stunted growth, reduced leaf size, poor flowering, and fruit set.
*   **Correction Method (Soil Application):**
    *   For mature bearing Koronda plants, apply 50-150 grams of actual Nitrogen per plant per year, split into 2-3 doses.
    *   **Chemicals:**
        *   **Urea** (46% N): Apply 110-325 grams of **Urea** per plant per year.
        *   **Ammonium Sulphate** (20.6% N): Apply 240-730 grams of **Ammonium Sulphate** per plant per year.
        *   **Calcium Ammonium Nitrate (CAN)** (25% N): Apply 200-600 grams of **Calcium Ammonium Nitrate (CAN)** per plant per year.
    *   **Timing:** Apply the first dose during the pre-monsoon period (May-June) and the second dose after fruit set (August-September). For three doses, add one in February-March.
    *   **Application:** Spread the fertilizer uniformly in a ring around the plant, 30-60 cm away from the main stem, and lightly incorporate it into the soil, followed by irrigation.
*   **Correction Method (Foliar Spray for quick relief):**
    *   For quick relief from severe deficiency, spray a 1-2% solution of **Urea**.
    *   **Dosage:** Dissolve 10-20 grams of **Urea** per litre of water.
    *   **Timing:** Spray during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening). Repeat after 10-15 days if needed.

**2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency**

*   **Symptoms:** Dark green or purplish discoloration of older leaves, stunted growth, poor root development, delayed flowering and fruiting, and reduced fruit quality.
*   **Correction Method (Soil Application):**
    *   For mature bearing Koronda plants, apply 30-80 grams of actual P2O5 per plant per year.
    *   **Chemicals:**
        *   **Single Superphosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5): Apply 190-500 grams of **Single Superphosphate (SSP)** per plant per year.
        *   **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (46% P2O5): Apply 65-175 grams of **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)** per plant per year. (Note: DAP also contains 18% N, so adjust N application accordingly).
    *   **Timing:** Apply the full dose annually during the pre-monsoon period (May-June) or at the time of planting for young plants, as phosphorus is less mobile in the soil.
    *   **Application:** Apply in a ring around the plant and incorporate into the soil, followed by irrigation.

**3. Potassium (K) Deficiency**

*   **Symptoms:** Yellowing and scorching (browning) of leaf margins, especially on older leaves, weak stems, poor fruit development, reduced fruit size, and lower disease resistance.
*   **Correction Method (Soil Application):**
    *   For mature bearing Koronda plants, apply 40-100 grams of actual K2O per plant per year, split into 2 doses.
    *   **Chemicals:**
        *   **Muriate of Potash (Potassium Chloride)** (60% K2O): Apply 65-165 grams of **Muriate of Potash (Potassium Chloride)** per plant per year.
        *   **Sulphate of Potash (Potassium Sulphate)** (50% K2O): Apply 80-200 grams of **Sulphate of Potash (Potassium Sulphate)** per plant per year.
    *   **Timing:** Apply the first dose during the pre-monsoon period (May-June) and the second dose after fruit set (August-September).
    *   **Application:** Spread the fertilizer uniformly in a ring around the plant, 30-60 cm away from the main stem, and lightly incorporate it into the soil, followed by irrigation.
*   **Correction Method (Foliar Spray for quick relief):**
    *   For quick relief from severe deficiency, spray a 1-2% solution of **Sulphate of Potash (Potassium Sulphate)**.
    *   **Dosage:** Dissolve 10-20 grams of **Sulphate of Potash (Potassium Sulphate)** per litre of water.
    *   **Timing:** Spray during cooler parts of the day. Repeat after 10-15 days if needed.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Young Plants:** For young Koronda plants (1-3 years old), reduce the recommended dosages by 50-75% and gradually increase as the plant matures.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management:** Always combine chemical fertilizers with organic manures (FYM, compost) for sustainable soil health and nutrient availability.
*   **Observation:** Regularly observe your plants for signs of improvement or persistent deficiency symptoms.
*   **Consultation:** For specific recommendations based on your soil test results and local conditions, please consult with the experts at HAU or your local Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK).
