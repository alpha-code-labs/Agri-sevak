As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified seed and soil treatment processes for Koronda (Carissa carandas) in Haryana:

### Seed Treatment for Koronda

Seed treatment for Koronda primarily focuses on improving germination and protecting young seedlings from common seed-borne or soil-borne fungal pathogens that can cause damping-off.

1.  **Pre-soaking for Enhanced Germination:**
    *   Soak Koronda seeds in plain water for 24 hours before sowing. This helps to soften the seed coat and promotes faster and more uniform germination.

2.  **Fungicidal Seed Treatment (Preventive):**
    *   To protect against damping-off and other early seedling diseases, a fungicidal seed treatment is recommended, especially if sowing in conditions prone to high moisture or if there's a history of seedling mortality.
        *   Treat seeds with **Carbendazim** 50% WP at a rate of 2 grams per kilogram of seeds.
        *   Alternatively, treat seeds with **Thiram** 75% WS at a rate of 2.5 grams per kilogram of seeds.
    *   Mix the fungicide thoroughly with the seeds just before sowing.

### Soil Treatment for Koronda

Soil treatment for Koronda focuses on improving soil health, fertility, and managing potential soil-borne issues before planting. Koronda is a hardy perennial, and extensive chemical soil treatments are generally not required unless specific problems are identified.

1.  **Soil Preparation and Organic Amendment:**
    *   Before planting, prepare pits of 60 cm x 60 cm x 60 cm.
    *   Incorporate 10-15 kg of well-rotted Farmyard Manure (FYM) or good quality compost into each planting pit. This should be done at least 15-30 days before planting. This improves soil structure, water retention, and provides essential macro and micronutrients, fostering a healthy root environment.

2.  **Biological Control for Soil-borne Pathogens:**
    *   To enhance soil microbial activity and provide protection against soil-borne fungal pathogens, the application of bio-fungicides is highly recommended.
        *   Mix **Trichoderma viride** 1% WP at 2.5 kg per acre with 50 kg of well-rotted FYM or compost. Apply this mixture evenly in the planting pits or broadcast it over the planting area and incorporate it into the soil before planting.
        *   Alternatively, use **Pseudomonas fluorescens** 1% WP at 2.5 kg per acre, mixed with 50 kg of FYM or compost, and applied similarly.

3.  **Nematode Management (Conditional):**
    *   Chemical nematicide application is generally not a standard recommendation for Koronda unless a severe nematode problem has been identified in the specific field through soil testing. If a severe nematode infestation is confirmed:
        *   Apply **Fluensulfone** 2% GR at 10 kg per acre, incorporated into the soil before planting.
        *   Alternatively, **Carbofuran** 3% G can be applied at 10 kg per acre, incorporated into the soil before planting.
    *   For general nematode suppression and soil health, the biological treatments mentioned above (**Trichoderma viride**, **Pseudomonas fluorescens**) also contribute positively.
