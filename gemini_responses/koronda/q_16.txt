As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified fertilizer schedule for Koronda (Carissa carandas) cultivation in Haryana.

**Crucial First Step: Soil Testing**
The most accurate fertilizer recommendations are always based on a comprehensive soil test report. This helps in understanding the existing nutrient status of your soil and tailoring the application precisely, preventing nutrient deficiencies or excesses. Please get your soil tested through HAU or a certified laboratory.

**General Fertilizer Recommendation for Koronda (Per Plant Per Year)**

The nutrient requirements for Koronda vary with the age and bearing status of the plant. The following are general guidelines:

*   **Young Plants (1-3 years):** Gradually increase the dose.
    *   **Year 1:** 50-100 g Nitrogen (N), 25-50 g Phosphorus (P2O5), 25-50 g Potassium (K2O)
    *   **Year 2:** 100-150 g N, 50-75 g P2O5, 50-75 g K2O
    *   **Year 3:** 150-200 g N, 75-100 g P2O5, 75-100 g K2O
*   **Bearing Plants (4 years and above):**
    *   200-250 g Nitrogen (N)
    *   100-125 g Phosphorus (P2O5)
    *   100-125 g Potassium (K2O)

**Conversion to Specific Fertilizers:**

Based on the general recommendations for bearing plants, here are the approximate doses of specific fertilizers:

1.  **Urea (46% N)**
    *   **Dose:** 430-540 g **Urea** per plant per year.
    *   **Application:** Apply in 2-3 split doses. The first dose after fruit harvest or during pruning, and subsequent doses during active vegetative growth and fruit development.

2.  **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP) (18% N, 46% P2O5)**
    *   **Dose:** 217-272 g **DAP** per plant per year.
    *   **Application:** Apply as a basal dose once a year, preferably after fruit harvest or before flowering. This dose will also contribute 39-49 g of Nitrogen.

3.  **Single Super Phosphate (SSP) (16% P2O5, 11% S)**
    *   **Dose:** 625-781 g **SSP** per plant per year.
    *   **Application:** Apply as a basal dose once a year, preferably after fruit harvest or before flowering. **SSP** is an excellent choice as it also provides Sulphur. If using **SSP** for Phosphorus, the Sulphur requirement will largely be met.

4.  **Muriate of Potash (Potash) (60% K2O)**
    *   **Dose:** 167-208 g **Muriate of Potash** per plant per year.
    *   **Application:** Apply as a basal dose once a year, preferably after fruit harvest or before flowering.

5.  **NPK (Complex Fertilizers)**
    *   While individual fertilizers allow for precise nutrient management, if you prefer using complex NPK fertilizers (e.g., 19:19:19, 12:32:16), the dose would depend on the specific grade and the NPK requirement derived from your soil test. For a bearing plant, a general dose might range from 500-700 g of a balanced NPK complex per plant per year, often requiring supplementation with additional **Urea** to meet the higher Nitrogen demand.

6.  **Nano-Urea (Liquid)**
    *   **Dose:** Foliar spray at 2-4 ml/L of water.
    *   **Application:** Apply 2-3 sprays during critical growth stages such as active vegetative growth and fruit development. Nano-Urea is a supplement and does not fully replace conventional **Urea**.

7.  **Nano-DAP (Liquid)**
    *   **Dose:** Foliar spray at 2-5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Application:** Apply 2 sprays, one before flowering and another during fruit development. Nano-DAP is a supplement and does not fully replace conventional **DAP** or **SSP**.

8.  **Sulphur (S)**
    *   **Importance:** Sulphur is crucial for protein synthesis and oil formation in fruits.
    *   **Source:** If **SSP** is used for Phosphorus, the Sulphur requirement is largely met. If **DAP** is used, additional Sulphur should be applied.
    *   **Dose:**
        *   **Elemental Sulphur (90% S):** 20-30 g per plant per year.
        *   **Gypsum (13-18% S):** 150-250 g per plant per year.
    *   **Application:** Apply as a basal dose once a year along with Phosphorus and Potassium fertilizers.

**Method of Application:**
*   Fertilizers should be applied in a ring around the tree canopy, approximately 30-60 cm away from the trunk, and thoroughly incorporated into the soil.
*   Ensure adequate moisture in the soil after fertilizer application to facilitate nutrient uptake.

Always observe your plants for any signs of nutrient deficiencies or excesses and adjust the fertilizer schedule based on soil test results and plant health.
