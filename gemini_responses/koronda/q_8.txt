As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm that Koronda (Carissa carandas) can be affected by various sucking pests, including aphids, leafhoppers, whiteflies, and thrips. While specific reports of psylla on Koronda are less common, the control measures for other sucking pests are generally effective against psyllids as well.

Effective control of sucking pests in Koronda requires an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural practices, biological control, and judicious use of CIBRC-approved chemical insecticides when necessary.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies:**

1.  **Regular Monitoring:** Frequently inspect plants, especially the undersides of leaves and new shoots, for the presence of pests. Early detection is crucial for effective management.
2.  **Weed Management:** Keep the area around Koronda plants free of weeds, as they can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
3.  **Proper Nutrition and Irrigation:** Maintain plant vigor through balanced fertilization and adequate irrigation, as stressed plants are more susceptible to pest attacks.
4.  **Pruning:** Remove and destroy severely infested plant parts to reduce pest populations.
5.  **Yellow Sticky Traps:** Install yellow sticky traps (10-15 traps per acre) to monitor and mass-trap adult whiteflies, leafhoppers, and thrips.

**Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved Technical Chemicals):**

When pest populations reach damaging levels, the following CIBRC-approved insecticides can be used. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Ensure thorough coverage of the plant, especially the undersides of leaves.

*   **For general sucking pests (Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, Thrips, Psylla):**
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: 0.5 - 0.75 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: 0.2 - 0.3 g per litre of water.
    *   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP: 0.2 - 0.3 g per litre of water.
    *   **Dinotefuran** 20% SG: 0.2 - 0.3 g per litre of water.

*   **For Whiteflies (especially nymphs) and Thrips:**
    *   **Buprofezin** 25% SC: 1.25 - 1.5 ml per litre of water (Insect Growth Regulator, effective on nymphs).
    *   **Spiromesifen** 22.9% SC: 0.5 - 0.75 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Flonicamid** 50% WG: 0.3 g per litre of water (specifically effective against aphids and whiteflies).

*   **For Thrips and some Leafhoppers:**
    *   **Fipronil** 5% SC: 1.5 - 2.0 ml per litre of water.

*   **Organic/Botanical Option (for early stages or low infestations):**
    *   **Azadirachtin** 1500 ppm: 3-5 ml per litre of water.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the insecticide label carefully, including dosage, application method, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Apply insecticides during the cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   Avoid spraying during flowering to protect pollinators, or spray when pollinators are not active.
