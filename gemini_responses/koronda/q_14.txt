As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling soil pests like termites and root-knot nematodes in Koronda (Carissa carandas) in Haryana.

Both termites and root-knot nematodes are significant soil pests that can severely impact the health and productivity of Koronda plants. Effective management requires an integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods.

### Control of Termites in Koronda

Termites (Odontotermes obesus, Microtermes obesi, etc.) attack the roots and stem base of Koronda plants, leading to wilting, yellowing, stunted growth, and eventually plant death. Visible mud channels on the stem are a clear indication of their presence.

**Control Measures:**

1.  **Pre-planting Treatment:**
    *   Before planting, treat the planting pits or the entire field soil if establishing a new orchard.
    *   Drench the soil with **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** at 2.5 ml per litre of water. Use 5-10 litres of this solution per pit, ensuring thorough mixing with the soil.

2.  **Post-planting Treatment (for existing plants):**
    *   For established plants showing termite damage, drench the soil around the base of the plant.
    *   Use **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** at 2.5 ml per litre of water, applying 5-10 litres of the solution per plant, depending on its size and spread of the root system. Ensure the solution penetrates the root zone.
    *   Alternatively, **Fipronil 5% SC** can be used at 1.5-2 ml per litre of water for soil drenching around the plant base.

### Control of Root-Knot Nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.) in Koronda

Root-knot nematodes are microscopic roundworms that infect the roots, causing characteristic galls or knots. This impairs the plant's ability to absorb water and nutrients, leading to stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, reduced fruit set, and wilting even when soil moisture is adequate. Koronda is known to be susceptible to root-knot nematodes.

**Control Measures:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Healthy Planting Material:** Always use nematode-free saplings from a reputable nursery.
    *   **Soil Solarization:** For nursery beds or small areas, cover moist soil with a transparent polyethylene sheet for 4-6 weeks during hot summer months (May-June) to reduce nematode populations.

2.  **Organic and Biological Control:**
    *   **Neem Cake:** Apply well-decomposed **Neem cake** at 200-300 g per plant, mixed into the soil around the root zone, twice a year (e.g., during spring and monsoon). Neem cake releases compounds that are toxic to nematodes and also improves soil health.
    *   **Biological Nematicides:** Apply bio-agents like *Purpureocillium lilacinum* (formerly *Paecilomyces lilacinus*) @ 2.5 kg per acre. Mix the bio-agent with 50 kg of well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost and apply it uniformly in the root zone, followed by light irrigation. This helps in suppressing nematode populations over time.

3.  **Chemical Control (for severe infestations):**
    *   If the infestation is severe and other methods are insufficient, chemical nematicides can be used judiciously.
    *   Apply **Fluensulfone 2% GR** at 20-30 kg per acre. This granular formulation should be applied in the root zone and lightly incorporated into the soil, followed by irrigation to ensure the chemical reaches the nematodes.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Integrated Pest Management (IPM):** For long-term and sustainable control, always adopt an IPM approach, combining multiple strategies.
*   **Soil Health:** Maintaining good soil health through regular addition of organic matter (FYM, compost) can enhance plant vigour and its natural resistance to pests.
*   **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your Koronda plants for any signs of pest damage to allow for timely intervention.

Always follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully regarding dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
