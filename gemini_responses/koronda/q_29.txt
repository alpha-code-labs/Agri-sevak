Namaste! Flower and fruit dropping in Koronda (Carissa carandas) is a common physiological issue that can significantly reduce yield. This phenomenon, often referred to as "dropping," can be attributed to a combination of environmental, nutritional, and hormonal factors. As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend the following scientifically verified strategies for effective control in Haryana:

**Understanding the Causes:**
The primary reasons for flower and fruit drop in Koronda include:
*   **Environmental Stress:** High temperatures, low humidity, strong winds, or sudden fluctuations in weather conditions.
*   **Water Stress:** Both insufficient (drought) and excessive (waterlogging) soil moisture can lead to shedding.
*   **Nutrient Deficiencies:** Lack of essential micronutrients like Boron and Zinc, which are crucial for pollen viability, fertilization, and fruit development.
*   **Hormonal Imbalance:** An imbalance between plant growth regulators (e.g., high abscisic acid relative to auxins) can trigger abscission.
*   **Poor Pollination:** Inadequate pollination can lead to unfertilized flowers dropping.
*   **Overbearing:** The plant may naturally shed some flowers/fruits if it sets too many, to balance the physiological load.

**Control Measures:**

To effectively manage dropping in Koronda, an integrated approach combining good cultural practices with targeted nutritional and hormonal interventions is recommended:

**1. Cultural and Agronomic Practices:**
*   **Consistent Water Management:** Ensure regular and adequate irrigation, especially during flowering and fruit development stages. Avoid both water scarcity and waterlogging. Mulching around the base of the plants can help conserve soil moisture and regulate soil temperature.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Conduct soil testing to identify nutrient deficiencies. Apply a balanced fertilizer regimen based on soil test results. Ensure adequate availability of macro and micronutrients.
*   **Weed Control:** Keep the area around the plants free of weeds to reduce competition for water and nutrients.
*   **Pruning:** Light pruning to maintain a healthy canopy and improve air circulation can indirectly contribute to plant vigour and stress tolerance.

**2. Nutritional Management (Foliar Sprays):**
Addressing micronutrient deficiencies is critical for fruit retention. Foliar application ensures quick uptake.

*   **Boron:** Boron plays a vital role in pollen germination, fruit set, and cell wall formation.
    *   Spray **Borax (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate)** at a concentration of 1.5-2.0 g/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, use **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** at 0.75-1.0 g/L of water.
    *   Apply at the pre-flowering stage and again at the fruit set stage.
*   **Zinc:** Zinc is essential for auxin synthesis and overall plant metabolism, impacting fruit development.
    *   Spray **Zinc Sulphate heptahydrate** at a concentration of 2.5-5.0 g/L of water.
    *   Apply at the pre-flowering stage and again at the fruit set stage.
    *   *Note:* If using Zinc Sulphate, it's often recommended to add an equal amount of slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) to neutralize acidity and prevent phytotoxicity, especially if not using chelated forms.

**3. Hormonal Management (Plant Growth Regulators - PGRs):**
Plant growth regulators, particularly auxins, can effectively reduce flower and fruit drop by strengthening the abscission layer.

*   **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA):** This synthetic auxin is highly effective in preventing premature flower and fruit drop.
    *   Spray **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA) 4.5% SL** at a concentration of 0.22-0.44 ml/L of water (equivalent to 10-20 ppm).
    *   The first spray should be given at the full bloom stage (when about 50% of flowers have opened).
    *   A second spray can be applied 15-20 days after the first, especially if dropping persists.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always ensure thorough coverage of the plant foliage during foliar sprays.
*   Spray during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late afternoon) to maximize absorption and minimize scorching.
*   Adhere strictly to the recommended dosages and timings for all chemical applications.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and soil test results.

By implementing these measures, you can significantly reduce flower and fruit dropping in your Koronda plants and achieve a healthier, more productive yield.
