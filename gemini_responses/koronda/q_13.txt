As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in Koronda in Haryana:

**Ber Fly (*Carpomyia vesuviana*) in Koronda:**
This is not known to affect Koronda. Ber fly is a host-specific pest primarily affecting Ber (*Ziziphus mauritiana*).

**Fruit Fly (e.g., *Bactrocera dorsalis*) in Koronda:**
Fruit flies are polyphagous pests that can infest Koronda fruits, causing significant damage. An Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is recommended for effective control.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Regularly collect and destroy all fallen and infested fruits by burying them deep in the soil (at least 60 cm) or burning them. This breaks the life cycle of the pest.
    *   Maintain orchard sanitation by removing weeds and debris, which can harbor pests.
    *   Deep ploughing during the off-season can expose pupae in the soil to predators and adverse weather conditions, reducing pest populations.

*   **Mechanical Control:**
    *   Install Methyl Eugenol pheromone traps at a rate of 10-12 traps per acre to attract and kill male fruit flies. Replace the lure every 2-3 weeks, especially during the fruiting season.
    *   For small-scale cultivation, individual fruit bagging can be employed to prevent egg-laying by female fruit flies.

*   **Chemical Control (as bait sprays):**
    *   Apply bait sprays containing an insecticide mixed with a protein source (like jaggery or protein hydrolysate) to attract and kill adult fruit flies. These sprays should be applied on the foliage, not directly on fruits, preferably in the morning or evening.
    *   Prepare bait spray using:
        *   **Malathion** 50 EC at 2 ml/L of water mixed with 10 g/L of jaggery or protein hydrolysate.
        *   Alternatively, **Fenthion** 50 EC at 1 ml/L of water mixed with 10 g/L of jaggery or protein hydrolysate.
    *   Spot spray these bait mixtures on 5-10% of the trees, targeting the lower canopy, starting from fruit set. Repeat applications every 7-10 days, especially during the peak fruiting season, or as per pest incidence.
