As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following for the ideal transplantation of Koronda (Carissa carandas) in Haryana:

### Ideal Transplantation Time

The most suitable time for transplanting Koronda seedlings or rooted cuttings in Haryana is during the monsoon season. This period provides optimal moisture and moderate temperatures, which are crucial for successful establishment and reduced transplant shock.

*   **July to August:** This is the primary window, coinciding with the onset and peak of the monsoon rains.
*   **February to March:** A secondary window can be considered in late winter/early spring, provided irrigation facilities are adequate to support the young plants before the intense summer heat.

### Ideal Transplantation Distance

The spacing for Koronda depends on its intended purpose (e.g., fruit production, hedging). For optimal fruit production and proper plant development, a wider spacing is recommended.

*   **For Fruit Production:**
    *   **Plant-to-Plant Distance:** 3 meters
    *   **Row-to-Row Distance:** 3 meters
    *   This spacing allows for good air circulation, sunlight penetration, and ease of cultural operations.
*   **For Hedging:**
    *   **Plant-to-Plant Distance:** 1 to 1.5 meters (to form a dense barrier)

### Ideal Transplantation Process

A well-executed transplantation process is vital for the healthy establishment of Koronda plants.

1.  **Pit Preparation:**
    *   Dig pits of 60 cm x 60 cm x 60 cm size at the desired spacing, approximately 15-30 days before planting.
    *   Allow the pits to remain open for a few days to expose the soil to sunlight and air, which helps in pest and disease control.
2.  **Pit Filling:**
    *   Refill the pits with a mixture of topsoil, well-decomposed Farmyard Manure (FYM) or compost (10-15 kg per pit), and 500 g of single superphosphate (SSP) if soil analysis indicates phosphorus deficiency.
    *   Mix the components thoroughly and mound the soil slightly above ground level, as it will settle over time.
3.  **Planting:**
    *   Carefully remove the seedling from its nursery bag or pot, ensuring the root ball remains intact and undisturbed.
    *   Place the seedling in the center of the prepared pit, ensuring that the root collar (the point where the stem meets the roots) is at the same level as the surrounding ground.
    *   Backfill the pit with the remaining soil mixture, gently firming the soil around the base of the plant to remove air pockets.
4.  **Watering:**
    *   Immediately after planting, water the seedling thoroughly until the soil is saturated. This helps in settling the soil around the roots.
    *   Create a small basin around the plant to facilitate water retention.
5.  **Post-Planting Care:**
    *   **Staking:** If the seedling is tall or in a windy area, provide a support stake to prevent it from falling over.
    *   **Mulching:** Apply a layer of organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves) around the base of the plant to conserve soil moisture, regulate soil temperature, and suppress weed growth.
    *   **Irrigation:** Maintain regular irrigation, especially during dry spells, until the plant is well-established. Reduce watering frequency during the monsoon season.
    *   **Weed Control:** Keep the area around the young plant free of weeds to minimize competition for nutrients and water.
