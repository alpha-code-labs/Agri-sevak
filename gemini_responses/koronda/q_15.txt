As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in Koronda (Carissa carandas) in Haryana:

**1. Grasshopper**
Grasshoppers can cause defoliation by feeding on leaves. Control measures should be initiated upon observing significant feeding damage.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Spray with **Malathion** 50% EC at 1.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   Alternatively, spray with **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   Another option is to spray with **Quinalphos** 25% EC at 2.0 ml per litre of water.

**2. Painted bug (Bagrada hilaris)**
This is not known to affect Koronda. Painted bug is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops.

**3. Red cotton bug (Dysdercus cingulatus)**
This is not known to affect Koronda. Red cotton bug is primarily a pest of cotton and other malvaceous plants.

**4. Black ants**
Black ants are often secondary pests, attracted to honeydew secreted by other sap-sucking insects (like aphids, mealybugs, or scales). They can also protect these pests from natural enemies. Direct damage to Koronda plants by black ants is usually minimal, but if they are nesting at the base of the plant or protecting other pests, control may be warranted.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   For controlling ant nests around the base of the plant, drench the soil with **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 2.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   For ant trails or activity on the plant stem/base, spray with **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   Alternatively, use ant baits containing **Fipronil** 0.05% Gel/Bait, applied as per manufacturer's instructions near ant trails or nesting sites.

**General Recommendations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully, including dosage, application method, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during pesticide application.
*   Consider integrated pest management (IPM) approaches, including cultural practices and biological control, to minimize reliance on chemical pesticides.
