As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an integrated approach for effective weed management in Koronda (Carissa carandas) orchards, combining cultural, mechanical, and chemical methods.

**I. Cultural and Mechanical Weed Control:**

1.  **Manual Weeding:** Regular hand weeding or hoeing, especially around young plants, is highly effective for all types of weeds. This is particularly crucial for parasitic weeds like Amarbail.
2.  **Mulching:** Applying organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves, wood chips) around the base of Koronda plants can suppress weed growth, conserve soil moisture, and improve soil health.
3.  **Inter-row Cultivation:** Shallow cultivation between rows can control emerging weeds without disturbing the Koronda root system.
4.  **Proper Spacing:** Maintaining optimal plant spacing helps Koronda plants establish a canopy that can shade out some weeds.

**II. Chemical Weed Control (Using CIBRC Approved Technical Chemicals):**

Chemical control should be used judiciously, primarily in inter-row spaces or as spot applications, to avoid damage to Koronda plants. Always read the product label for specific instructions, safety precautions, and precise dosages. Apply herbicides with adequate water volume (typically 200-300 L/acre) using a flat fan nozzle for uniform coverage.

**A. For General Broadleaf Weeds (e.g., Bathu, Congress grass) and Narrowleaf Weeds (e.g., Phalaris minor):**

1.  **Pre-emergence Herbicides (Applied before weed emergence, on moist soil):**
    *   **Pendimethalin** (30% EC): Apply at 3.3 L/acre. This herbicide controls germinating annual grasses and some broadleaf weeds.
    *   **Oxyfluorfen** (23.5% EC): Apply at 0.85 L/acre. Effective against a wide range of germinating broadleaf and narrowleaf weeds.
    *   **Diuron** (80% WP): Apply at 1 kg/acre. Provides residual control of many annual broadleaf and grass weeds.

2.  **Post-emergence Herbicides (Applied after weeds have emerged):**
    *   **Non-selective Herbicides (for inter-row spaces, avoid contact with Koronda plants):**
        *   **Glyphosate** (41% SL): Apply at 2.5-3 L/acre. Effective against most annual and perennial broadleaf and narrowleaf weeds. Apply when weeds are actively growing.
        *   **Paraquat dichloride** (24% SL): Apply at 1.5-2 L/acre. A fast-acting contact herbicide for general weed knockdown.
    *   **Selective Herbicides (for narrowleaf weeds/grasses like Phalaris minor):**
        *   **Quizalofop-ethyl** (5% EC): Apply at 1 L/acre. Specifically targets annual and perennial grasses without harming broadleaf crops.
        *   **Fenoxaprop-p-ethyl** (9% EC): Apply at 0.5 L/acre. Another excellent option for selective control of grassy weeds.
    *   **Selective Herbicides (for broadleaf weeds like Bathu, Congress grass, with extreme caution):**
        *   **2,4-D Amine Salt** (58% SL): Apply at 1 L/acre. This is a selective broadleaf herbicide. Use with extreme caution in orchards to prevent drift onto Koronda plants, especially young ones, as it can cause severe damage. Apply on calm days.

**B. For Specific Difficult Weeds:**

1.  **Amarbail (Cuscuta spp. - Dodder):**
    *   **Manual Removal:** This is the most effective method. Remove Amarbail plants as soon as they are noticed, before they produce seeds. Ensure all parasitic strands are removed from the Koronda plants.
    *   **Pre-emergence:** **Pendimethalin** (30% EC @ 3.3 L/acre) or **Oxyfluorfen** (23.5% EC @ 0.85 L/acre) can offer some suppression if applied before Amarbail seed germination.
    *   **Post-emergence (Spot Application with Extreme Caution):**
        *   **Glyphosate** (41% SL @ 2.5-3 L/acre) can be used as a spot application directly on Amarbail, but ensure absolutely no spray drift or contact with Koronda plants, as it is non-selective and will damage the crop.
        *   **Paraquat dichloride** (24% SL @ 1.5-2 L/acre) can also be used for contact kill of Amarbail, again with extreme care to avoid contact with Koronda.

2.  **Orobanche (Broomrape):**
    *   This is not known to affect Koronda. Orobanche species are parasitic weeds with specific host ranges, and Koronda (Carissa carandas) is not a reported host for Orobanche.

**III. Important Considerations:**

*   **Timing:** Apply pre-emergence herbicides to a clean, moist soil surface. Apply post-emergence herbicides when weeds are young and actively growing for best results.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during herbicide handling and application.
*   **Calibration:** Ensure your sprayer is properly calibrated to apply the correct dose.
*   **Water Quality:** Use clean water for herbicide mixing.
*   **Rotation of Herbicides:** To prevent herbicide resistance, rotate different classes of herbicides over time.

By implementing these integrated weed management strategies, you can effectively control weeds in your Koronda orchard and ensure healthy plant growth and productivity.
