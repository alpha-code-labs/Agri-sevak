Mites (Red spider mite and Rust mite) are known to affect Koronda (Carissa carandas) and can cause significant damage, leading to leaf discoloration, defoliation, and reduced fruit yield. Effective management involves an integrated approach:

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Mites in Koronda:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Regular Monitoring:** Inspect plants frequently, especially the undersides of leaves, for early signs of mite infestation. Look for fine webbing (red spider mites) or bronzing/rusting of leaves (rust mites).
    *   **Water Spray:** For mild infestations, a strong jet of water can dislodge mites from the plant foliage.
    *   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy heavily infested leaves or branches to reduce the pest load.
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the area around Koronda plants free of weeds, as many weeds can serve as alternate hosts for mites.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can promote lush, soft growth favored by mites.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Encourage natural enemies like predatory mites (e.g., *Amblyseius* species) and ladybird beetles, which feed on pest mites. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

3.  **Chemical Control (Acaricides):**
    When mite populations are high and cultural/biological methods are insufficient, CIBRC-approved acaricides can be used. Ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves. Rotate different classes of acaricides to prevent resistance development.

    Recommended acaricides for mites in Koronda:

    *   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** Apply at a concentration of 0.5 - 1.0 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Fenpyroximate 5% SC:** Apply at a concentration of 0.5 - 1.0 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Propargite 57% EC:** Apply at a concentration of 1.5 - 2.0 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP:** Effective against rust mites and also helps control red spider mites. Apply at a concentration of 2.0 - 3.0 g per litre of water. This can also help manage powdery mildew if present.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Thorough Coverage:** Mites primarily reside on the undersides of leaves, so ensure the spray reaches these areas effectively.
*   **Spray Timing:** Early morning or late evening hours are ideal for spraying to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate between different groups of acaricides with different modes of action to prevent mites from developing resistance.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying. Follow the instructions and safety precautions mentioned on the product label.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Adhere strictly to the Pre-Harvest Interval specified on the product label to ensure the safety of the fruit for consumption.
