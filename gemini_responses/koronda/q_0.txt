Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing fungal diseases in Koronda (Carissa carandas) in Haryana.

Effective management of fungal diseases in Koronda requires an Integrated Disease Management (IDM) approach, combining cultural practices with judicious use of fungicides.

Here's how to control the mentioned fungal diseases:

**General Cultural Practices for Fungal Disease Management:**

1.  **Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy fallen leaves, infected fruits, and pruned branches to reduce inoculum sources.
2.  **Pruning:** Prune plants to ensure good air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce humidity and fungal growth. Remove dead, diseased, or overcrowded branches.
3.  **Proper Spacing:** Maintain adequate plant spacing to prevent overcrowding and promote air movement.
4.  **Nutrition:** Ensure balanced fertilization to maintain plant vigor, as stressed plants are more susceptible to diseases. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can promote lush, susceptible growth.
5.  **Irrigation:** Avoid overhead irrigation late in the day, which can leave foliage wet for extended periods, favoring fungal development. Drip irrigation is preferable.

**Specific Disease Management:**

1.  **Alternaria (Alternaria Leaf Spot/Fruit Spot)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Irregular to circular brown spots with concentric rings on leaves, sometimes leading to defoliation. Similar spots can appear on fruits.
    *   **Control:**
        *   **Cultural:** Implement general cultural practices as mentioned above.
        *   **Chemical:**
            *   Spray with **Mancozeb 75% WP** at 2.5 g/L of water.
            *   Alternatively, use **Chlorothalonil 75% WP** at 2 g/L of water.
            *   For systemic action, **Azoxystrobin 23% SC** at 0.5-1 ml/L of water can be effective.

2.  **Anthracnose (Colletotrichum gloeosporioides)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Dark, sunken lesions on fruits, often with pinkish spore masses in humid conditions. Can also cause leaf spots, twig dieback, and blossom blight.
    *   **Control:**
        *   **Cultural:** Remove and destroy infected plant parts. Prune to improve air circulation.
        *   **Chemical:**
            *   Apply **Carbendazim 50% WP** at 1 g/L of water.
            *   **Mancozeb 75% WP** at 2.5 g/L of water is also effective as a protectant.
            *   Systemic options include **Propiconazole 25% EC** at 0.5 ml/L of water or **Azoxystrobin 23% SC** at 0.5-1 ml/L of water.

3.  **Blast**
    *   This is not known to affect Koronda. Blast disease is primarily associated with cereal crops like rice, wheat, and pearl millet.

4.  **Blight (Fungal Blight - e.g., Twig Blight, Fruit Blight)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Rapid browning and death of plant tissues, including twigs, leaves, and flowers, often leading to dieback. Fruit blight causes rotting and discoloration.
    *   **Control:**
        *   **Cultural:** Prune out and destroy all blighted twigs and branches well below the infected area. Ensure good sanitation.
        *   **Chemical:**
            *   Spray with **Mancozeb 75% WP** at 2.5 g/L of water.
            *   **Chlorothalonil 75% WP** at 2 g/L of water can also be used.
            *   For systemic control, **Propiconazole 25% EC** at 0.5 ml/L of water or **Azoxystrobin 23% SC** at 0.5-1 ml/L of water are recommended.

5.  **Brown Spot (General Fungal Leaf Spot)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Various fungi can cause brown spots on leaves, leading to premature defoliation.
    *   **Control:**
        *   **Cultural:** Maintain plant hygiene and vigor.
        *   **Chemical:**
            *   Apply **Mancozeb 75% WP** at 2.5 g/L of water.
            *   **Carbendazim 50% WP** at 1 g/L of water can also be used.

6.  **Downy Mildew**
    *   This is not known to affect Koronda.

7.  **Powdery Mildew**
    *   **Symptoms:** White, powdery patches on the surface of young leaves, shoots, and sometimes fruits. Infected leaves may curl, distort, and turn yellow.
    *   **Control:**
        *   **Cultural:** Ensure good air circulation. Avoid excessive shade.
        *   **Chemical:**
            *   Spray **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP** at 2-3 g/L of water (avoid spraying in very hot weather).
            *   Systemic fungicides like **Hexaconazole 5% SC** at 1-2 ml/L of water or **Myclobutanil 10% WP** at 0.4-0.5 g/L of water are highly effective.
            *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC** at 0.5-1 ml/L of water also provides control.

8.  **Grey Mildew**
    *   This is not known to affect Koronda as a distinct mildew disease. (Note: Grey mold, caused by Botrytis, can affect fruits but is not typically referred to as "grey mildew").

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Timing:** Apply fungicides preventively or at the first sign of disease symptoms.
*   **Rotation:** Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
*   **Safety:** Always read and follow the instructions on the fungicide label regarding dosage, application, and safety precautions.
*   **Adjuvants:** Consider using a spreading agent (sticker) with your spray solution to improve coverage and efficacy.
