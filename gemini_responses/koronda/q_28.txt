Namaste, Kisan bhaiyon! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the challenges our farmers face with environmental extremes. Protecting your Koronda (Carissa carandas) plants from these stresses is crucial for healthy growth and good yield. Here's how you can safeguard your Koronda plants:

### Protection from Extreme Cold and Frost

Koronda plants, especially young ones, can be susceptible to damage from severe cold and frost during Haryana winters.

*   **Mulching:** Apply a thick layer (5-10 cm) of organic mulch (like straw, dry leaves, or sugarcane trash) around the base of the plants. This insulates the soil, retains warmth, and protects the root zone from freezing.
*   **Irrigation:** Lightly irrigate the field a day or two before a predicted frost event. Moist soil retains heat better than dry soil, releasing it slowly overnight and helping to keep the ambient temperature around the plants slightly higher. Avoid waterlogging.
*   **Covering Young Plants:** For young or newly planted Koronda, provide temporary covers using hessian cloth, plastic sheets, or even dry grass/straw during severe cold nights. Ensure the cover does not touch the foliage directly and is removed during the day to allow sunlight and air circulation.
*   **Windbreaks:** Planting taller, hardy trees or shrubs as windbreaks on the northern and western sides of your orchard can significantly reduce the impact of cold, dry winds.

### Protection from Heat (Loo) and Intense Sunlight

The scorching heat and hot winds (Loo) during summer in Haryana can cause wilting, leaf scorch, and fruit drop in Koronda. Intense sunlight can exacerbate these issues.

*   **Adequate Irrigation:** Ensure regular and sufficient irrigation during hot periods. Water stress makes plants more vulnerable to heat damage. Drip irrigation is highly recommended for efficient water use. Water in the early morning or late evening to minimize evaporation.
*   **Mulching:** Continue mulching during summer. It helps conserve soil moisture, reduces soil temperature, and suppresses weed growth, all of which reduce competition for water.
*   **Windbreaks:** As mentioned for cold, windbreaks are equally effective against hot, desiccating winds (Loo), reducing their speed and impact on the plants.
*   **Shade Nets:** For very young plants or in areas with extreme sun exposure, temporary shade nets (e.g., 30-50% shade) can be installed during the peak summer months to reduce heat stress and intense solar radiation.
*   **Reflective Sprays:** To reduce the canopy temperature and reflect excessive sunlight, you can apply a spray of **Kaolin** clay.
    *   **Kaolin** (a naturally occurring clay mineral) forms a white film on the leaves, reflecting sunlight and reducing leaf temperature.
    *   **Dosage:** Mix 2.5-5 kg of **Kaolin** powder in 100 litres of water and spray thoroughly to cover the foliage. Repeat applications may be necessary after heavy rains or every 2-3 weeks during peak heat.

By implementing these practices, you can significantly reduce the environmental stress on your Koronda plants, ensuring their healthy growth and productivity.
