As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following doses of organic manures for Koronda (Carissa carandas) cultivation in Haryana, based on scientific principles and local conditions:

**1. Farmyard Manure (FYM):**
Farmyard manure is a fundamental organic amendment that improves soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability over time.

*   **For young plants (1-2 years old):** 3-5 kg per plant annually.
*   **For established plants (3 years and older):** 10-15 kg per plant annually.

**Application:** Apply FYM around the base of the plant, spreading it evenly within the drip line, and lightly incorporate it into the soil. The best time for application is during the monsoon season (July-August) or post-monsoon (September-October).

**2. Vermicompost:**
Vermicompost is a nutrient-rich organic fertilizer produced by earthworms, offering a more concentrated source of nutrients than FYM.

*   **For young plants (1-2 years old):** 1-2 kg per plant annually.
*   **For established plants (3 years and older):** 2-4 kg per plant annually.

**Application:** Vermicompost can be applied in a similar manner to FYM. It can also be split into two applications, once before flowering and once after fruit set, to provide a continuous supply of nutrients.

**3. Sagarika:**
**Sagarika** is a commercially available seaweed extract-based biostimulant, not a traditional manure. It is rich in plant growth hormones, micronutrients, and amino acids, which enhance plant growth, nutrient uptake, and stress tolerance.

*   **Foliar Spray:** 2-3 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Application:** Spray evenly on the foliage at critical growth stages such as pre-flowering, fruit set, and during fruit development. Repeat applications can be done at 15-20 day intervals as needed.
*   **Soil Drench/Drip Irrigation:** 500 ml to 1 litre per acre.
    *   **Application:** Apply during active growth phases to stimulate root development and nutrient absorption.

**General Recommendations:**

*   Always ensure proper soil moisture when applying organic manures.
*   Regular soil testing is recommended to determine specific nutrient deficiencies and tailor fertilizer applications accordingly.
*   The exact doses may vary slightly based on soil type, plant vigour, and specific environmental conditions.
