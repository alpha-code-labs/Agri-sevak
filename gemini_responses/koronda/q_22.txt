As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following cultivation practices for Koronda (Carissa carandas) in Haryana:

Koronda is typically propagated through seeds or vegetative methods (cuttings, layering, grafting) to produce saplings in a nursery. Establishing an orchard primarily involves planting these nursery-raised saplings rather than direct sowing of seeds in the field.

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   **Propagation:** While seeds can be used, vegetative propagation (e.g., semi-hardwood cuttings) is often preferred for true-to-type plants and earlier fruiting. Seeds are sown in nursery beds or polybags to raise seedlings.
    *   **Field Planting:** Nursery-raised saplings (6-12 months old) are transplanted into prepared pits in the main field.
    *   **Planting Pattern:** A square or rectangular planting system is generally adopted to facilitate inter-cultural operations. Pits of 60 cm x 60 cm x 60 cm should be dug and refilled with a mixture of topsoil, 10-15 kg of farmyard manure (FYM), and 1 kg of single super phosphate before planting.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   Saplings should be planted at the same depth as they were growing in the nursery bags or beds. Ensure the root collar (the point where the stem meets the roots) is at ground level. Avoid planting too deep or too shallow.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   For optimal growth and fruit production, a spacing of **3 meters x 3 meters** to **4 meters x 4 meters** is recommended. This allows for adequate sunlight penetration and air circulation, which are crucial for fruit development and disease prevention.
    *   If grown as a hedge or boundary plant, closer spacing can be adopted.

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   Direct sowing of Koronda seeds in the main field is not a common practice for establishing an orchard. Therefore, a "seed dose" for field planting is not directly applicable.
    *   Instead, the requirement is for **saplings per unit area**. Based on the recommended spacing:
        *   For 3 m x 3 m spacing: Approximately 1111 saplings per acre.
        *   For 4 m x 4 m spacing: Approximately 625 saplings per acre.
    *   If seeds are used for raising saplings in a nursery, approximately 500 g to 1 kg of seeds would be sufficient to raise enough saplings for an acre, assuming a good germination rate and survival.
