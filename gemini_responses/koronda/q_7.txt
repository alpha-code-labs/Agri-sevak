Dear Farmer,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing diseases in Koronda (Carissa carandas) in Haryana.

**Control of Dieback and Twig Blight in Koronda:**

Dieback and Twig blight are common fungal diseases in Koronda, often caused by pathogens like *Colletotrichum gloeosporioides* or *Botryodiplodia theobromae*. These conditions can be exacerbated by plant stress, poor nutrition, or improper pruning. Integrated management combining cultural practices and timely chemical intervention is crucial.

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Pruning:** Regularly inspect your Koronda plants. As soon as symptoms of dieback (drying back of branches from the tip) or twig blight (browning and death of twigs) appear, prune out the affected branches/twigs. Make the cut well into the healthy wood, at least 15-20 cm below the visible symptoms.
*   **Sanitation:** Immediately collect and destroy all pruned diseased material by burning or deep burial to prevent the spread of fungal spores.
*   **Tool Sterilization:** Sterilize your pruning tools (e.g., with a 10% bleach solution or 70% alcohol) before and after each cut, especially when moving between plants, to avoid transmitting the disease.
*   **Plant Vigor:** Ensure proper plant nutrition and irrigation. Avoid water stress (both drought and waterlogging) and provide balanced fertilizers to maintain plant health and resilience.

**2. Chemical Control:**
After pruning, and as a preventive measure during periods conducive to disease development (e.g., high humidity, post-monsoon), apply CIBRC approved fungicides. Ensure thorough coverage of the plant.

*   **For Dieback and Twig Blight:**
    *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: Apply at a rate of 1 g/L of water.
    *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP: Apply at a rate of 2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Copper oxychloride** 50% WP: Apply at a rate of 3 g/L of water.

*   **Application Notes:**
    *   Spray immediately after pruning the diseased parts.
    *   For severe infections or during high-risk periods, repeat the spray at 10-15 day intervals.
    *   Rotate between different fungicides (e.g., Carbendazim followed by Mancozeb) to prevent the development of fungicide resistance.

**Control of Tikka Disease in Koronda:**

This is not known to affect Koronda. "Tikka disease" is a specific leaf spot disease primarily associated with groundnut (peanut) crops. While Koronda can suffer from various leaf spot diseases, they are generally not referred to as "Tikka disease." If you observe any unusual leaf spots, please provide samples to your local agricultural extension office for accurate diagnosis.

For any further clarification or specific issues, please contact your nearest Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or the Department of Plant Pathology at HAU, Hisar.
