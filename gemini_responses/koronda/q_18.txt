As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the use of growth regulators and Boron in Koronda (Carissa carandas) for Haryana conditions:

1.  **Ethephon:**
    There are no established recommendations for the use of **Ethephon** as a growth regulator for *in-field* application in Koronda in Haryana. While **Ethephon** is used in some fruit crops for ripening or flower induction, its application for growth regulation in Koronda is not a standard practice.

2.  **2,4-D:**
    There are no established recommendations for the use of **2,4-D** as a growth regulator in Koronda in Haryana. **2,4-D** is primarily known as a herbicide, and its use as a growth regulator requires extremely precise concentrations to avoid phytotoxicity, which is generally not recommended for Koronda cultivation under typical farming practices.

3.  **Boron:**
    Boron is an essential micronutrient crucial for pollen germination, pollen tube growth, and fruit set in many fruit crops, including Koronda. Its application can significantly improve fruit set and yield.

    *   **Recommended Dose:**
        *   Foliar spray of **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate) at 1-2 g/L of water.
    *   **Timing:**
        *   Apply as a foliar spray during the flowering stage and again at the early fruit development stage to ensure adequate Boron availability for fruit set and development.
