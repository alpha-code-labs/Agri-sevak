As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified recommendations for the use of growth regulators and Boron in Apple cultivation in Haryana. It is crucial to remember that the efficacy and safety of these applications depend heavily on the apple variety, tree vigour, environmental conditions, and precise timing. Always conduct a small-scale trial before widespread application.

### **1. Ethephon**

**Ethephon** (commonly known by the brand name Ethrel) is a plant growth regulator used in apple for various purposes.

*   **Purpose:**
    *   **Fruit Thinning:** To reduce fruit load, improve fruit size, and promote return bloom.
    *   **Enhancing Red Colouration and Ripening:** To improve fruit colour and hasten maturity, especially in late-maturing varieties.
    *   **Facilitating Harvest:** To promote abscission and ease fruit detachment.

*   **Recommended Dose and Timing:**
    *   **For Fruit Thinning:**
        *   Apply **Ethephon** at a concentration of **300-500 mg/L** (parts per million) approximately 7-14 days after full bloom, when the king fruit is 10-15 mm in diameter.
        *   The exact dose depends on the variety and desired thinning intensity. Lower doses for easy-to-thin varieties, higher for difficult ones.
    *   **For Enhancing Red Colouration, Ripening, and Harvest Aid:**
        *   Apply **Ethephon** at a concentration of **500-1000 mg/L** approximately 7-14 days before the anticipated harvest date, when fruits begin to show signs of maturity.
        *   Ensure good foliage and fruit coverage. Avoid application during very hot weather.

### **2. 2,4-D**

**2,4-D** (2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) is primarily known and registered as a herbicide.

*   **Recommendation for Apple:**
    *   **2,4-D** is **not generally recommended or used as a fruit growth regulator for apple** in standard horticultural practices.
    *   While it is an auxin, its margin of safety for direct application to apple trees as a fruit growth regulator (e.g., for fruit thinning or preventing pre-harvest drop) is extremely narrow. Doses even slightly above the effective range can cause severe phytotoxicity, fruit malformation, and damage to the tree.
    *   For preventing pre-harvest fruit drop in apple, other auxins like **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA)** are preferred and safer alternatives.
    *   Therefore, I do not recommend a dose of **2,4-D** for growth regulation purposes in apple. Its use should be restricted to weed control in the orchard floor, strictly avoiding drift onto the apple trees.

### **3. Boron**

**Boron** is an essential micronutrient critical for apple tree health and fruit development.

*   **Purpose:**
    *   Essential for pollen germination, fruit set, cell wall formation, and sugar transport.
    *   Prevents physiological disorders such as "cork spot," "internal breakdown," and "drought spot" in fruits.
    *   Improves fruit quality and storage life.

*   **Recommended Dose and Timing:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Apply **Boric acid** (containing approximately 17% Boron) or **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (containing approximately 20.5% Boron) at a concentration of **0.1% - 0.2%**.
        *   This translates to **1-2 g/L** of **Boric acid** or **1-2 g/L** of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** in water.
        *   **Timing:**
            *   **Pre-bloom (Pink Bud Stage):** A crucial application to ensure good pollen viability and fruit set.
            *   **Post-harvest:** An application after harvest but before leaf fall helps build up Boron reserves in the tree for the following season's bloom and fruit set.
            *   **During Fruit Development:** If deficiency symptoms are observed or soil tests indicate low Boron, an additional spray can be given during early fruit development.
    *   **Soil Application (if severe deficiency):**
        *   In cases of severe Boron deficiency confirmed by soil and tissue analysis, **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate) can be applied to the soil at a rate of **10-20 kg/acre** every 3-4 years, depending on soil type and deficiency level. This should be done with extreme caution and based on expert advice, as excess Boron can be toxic.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always use clean water for spraying.
*   Ensure thorough coverage of foliage and fruit.
*   Consult local agricultural extension services or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your orchard's conditions and apple varieties.
*   Adhere strictly to the manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions for all chemical applications.
