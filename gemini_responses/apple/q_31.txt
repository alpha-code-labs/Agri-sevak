As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide scientifically verified advice for managing these physical damages in Apple orchards in Haryana.

### Control of Physical Damage in Apple

**1. Fruit Bursting (Cracking)**

Fruit bursting or cracking is a physiological disorder primarily caused by rapid changes in fruit turgor pressure, often due to sudden water uptake after a dry spell, high humidity, or rapid fruit growth. Nutrient deficiencies, particularly Calcium and Boron, can also contribute by weakening cell wall integrity.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Consistent Water Management:**
    *   Maintain uniform soil moisture throughout the fruit development period. Avoid drastic fluctuations between dry and wet conditions.
    *   Utilize drip irrigation systems to deliver water precisely and consistently, minimizing stress.
*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Calcium:** Improves cell wall strength and elasticity.
        *   Foliar sprays of **Calcium chloride** (0.5-1.0% solution) or **Calcium nitrate** (0.5-1.0% solution) can be applied 5-7 times from fruit set until harvest, at 10-14 day intervals.
        *   Soil application of gypsum (Calcium sulphate) can also improve soil calcium levels over time.
    *   **Boron:** Essential for calcium uptake and cell wall formation.
        *   Foliar spray of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (0.1-0.2% solution) during pre-bloom and post-fruit set stages.
        *   Soil application of **Borax** (10-20 kg/acre) once every 3-4 years, based on soil test recommendations.
*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Maintain balanced tree vigor through proper pruning and fertilization.
    *   Avoid excessive pruning that exposes fruit directly to intense sunlight, which can exacerbate cracking.

**2. Leaf Burning/Melting**

Leaf burning or melting can be attributed to several factors, including sunscald (high temperatures and intense sunlight), water stress, and chemical phytotoxicity.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Water Management:**
    *   Ensure adequate and consistent irrigation, especially during periods of high temperatures and intense sunlight, to prevent water stress.
    *   Mulching around the base of trees can help conserve soil moisture and regulate soil temperature.
*   **Shade/Protection:**
    *   In areas prone to severe heat and sunscald, consider using shade nets (e.g., 30-50% shade) over the orchard during peak summer months.
*   **Careful Chemical Application:**
    *   Always adhere strictly to the recommended dosage and application instructions on pesticide and fertilizer labels.
    *   Avoid spraying during high temperatures (above 28-30°C) or strong sunlight, as this increases the risk of phytotoxicity.
    *   Ensure spray equipment is properly calibrated to avoid over-application.
    *   Use only CIBRC approved chemicals and follow their specific guidelines for application.
*   **Nutrient Balance:**
    *   Maintain a balanced nutrient program. Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush, tender foliage that is more susceptible to sunscald and chemical burn.
*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Maintain a healthy and well-structured canopy through proper pruning to provide natural shade to inner leaves and fruit.

**3. Hardness in Fruit**

This term can be ambiguous. If referring to "Stony Pit" disease, **this is not known to affect Apple**; Stony Pit is primarily a viral disease of pears.

However, if you are observing undesirable firmness, localized hard/corky spots, or generally poor texture in apple fruit, consider the following physiological factors:

*   **Boron Deficiency (Internal Corking):**
    *   Boron deficiency can lead to internal corking, which manifests as hard, dry, brown spots within the fruit flesh, making the fruit undesirably hard in those areas.
    *   **Control:**
        *   Foliar spray of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (0.1-0.2% solution) during pre-bloom and post-fruit set stages.
        *   Soil application of **Borax** (10-20 kg/acre) once every 3-4 years, based on soil test recommendations.
*   **Calcium Deficiency (Bitter Pit):**
    *   While typically causing sunken, firm, bitter spots on the fruit surface, severe calcium deficiency can affect overall fruit texture and storage quality, sometimes leading to undesirable firmness or breakdown.
    *   **Control:**
        *   Foliar sprays of **Calcium chloride** (0.5-1.0% solution) or **Calcium nitrate** (0.5-1.0% solution) applied 5-7 times from fruit set until harvest, at 10-14 day intervals.
*   **Maturity at Harvest:**
    *   Harvesting fruit too early can result in excessively hard fruit that lacks characteristic flavor, juiciness, and proper texture. Harvest apples at their optimal maturity stage, which varies by cultivar.
*   **Water Management:**
    *   Consistent water supply throughout fruit development is crucial for proper cell expansion and development of desirable fruit texture.
*   **Nutrient Balance:**
    *   Ensure a balanced supply of all macro and micronutrients. Avoid excessive nitrogen relative to potassium and calcium, as this imbalance can negatively impact fruit quality, firmness, and storage potential.

Always conduct a soil and leaf analysis to accurately diagnose nutrient deficiencies before applying any fertilizers. For specific recommendations tailored to your orchard, please consult with the HAU extension services.
