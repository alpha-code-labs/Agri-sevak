As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I must first address the fundamental suitability of apple cultivation in Haryana.

**Climatic Suitability for Apple in Haryana:**
Apples are temperate fruit crops that require a specific number of chilling hours (typically 700-1500 hours below 7°C) during winter for proper dormancy break, flowering, and fruit set. The agro-climatic conditions of Haryana, characterized by hot summers and mild winters, generally do not provide sufficient chilling hours for the successful commercial cultivation of most traditional apple varieties. While research on low-chill apple varieties is ongoing, large-scale commercial apple cultivation is not recommended for the plains of Haryana due to these climatic limitations.

However, if we consider the general recommended practices for apple cultivation in suitable regions, the following apply:

**Recommended Cultivation Practices for Apple (General Principles):**

1.  **Sowing Method/Pattern (Propagation):**
    *   Apples are not typically propagated by sowing seeds for commercial orchards. Seeds do not breed true to the parent variety, and seedlings have a long juvenile period before fruiting.
    *   Commercial apple orchards are established using **grafted saplings**. These saplings consist of a desired scion (fruiting variety) grafted onto a suitable rootstock. The choice of rootstock is crucial as it influences tree vigour, precocity, yield, and adaptability to soil conditions.

2.  **Planting Depth:**
    *   When planting a grafted sapling, it is critical to ensure that the **graft union remains well above the soil line**, typically 15-20 cm above the ground.
    *   The rootstock portion should be planted at a depth where its original soil mark is at or slightly below the new soil surface. Planting the graft union below the soil can lead to scion rooting, which negates the benefits of the rootstock.

3.  **Spacing:**
    *   Planting distance in apple orchards varies significantly depending on the rootstock vigour, scion variety, training system (e.g., central leader, spindle, trellis), and soil fertility. Modern orchards increasingly adopt high-density planting systems.
    *   **High-Density Planting (using dwarfing rootstocks like M.9, M.26):**
        *   Plant-to-plant: 1.0 - 2.0 m
        *   Row-to-row: 3.0 - 4.0 m
        *   This system requires support structures (trellis) and intensive management.
    *   **Medium-Density Planting (using semi-dwarfing rootstocks like M.7, MM.106):**
        *   Plant-to-plant: 2.0 - 3.0 m
        *   Row-to-row: 4.0 - 5.0 m
    *   **Traditional Planting (using vigorous rootstocks like MM.111 or seedling rootstocks):**
        *   Plant-to-plant: 4.0 - 6.0 m
        *   Row-to-row: 6.0 - 8.0 m
    *   The specific spacing should be determined based on a detailed plan considering the chosen cultivar-rootstock combination and the desired training system.

4.  **Seed Dose:**
    *   As explained, apples are not commercially grown from seeds. Therefore, the concept of "seed dose" is not applicable to establishing a commercial apple orchard. The requirement is for **grafted saplings**, and the number of saplings per acre will depend on the chosen spacing (e.g., for 3m x 1.5m spacing, approximately 2222 saplings per acre).
