As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I emphasize that precise irrigation management is critical for successful apple cultivation in Haryana, given our specific climatic conditions, especially the hot and dry summers. Proper water application ensures optimal tree growth, fruit development, and yield.

### 1. First Irrigation

*   **Timing:** The first irrigation is crucial and should be applied post-dormancy, typically around the **bud break stage** (late February to early March in Haryana), when the tree starts active growth. This replenishes soil moisture after the dry winter and supports initial shoot and leaf development.
*   **Quantity:** The amount depends on soil type and winter rainfall. For sandy loam soils common in Haryana, a general recommendation would be to apply **50-75 mm** of water. This can be achieved by running a flood irrigation system for 4-6 hours, or by applying approximately **200-300 litres per young tree** (1-3 years old) and **400-600 litres per mature tree** (4+ years old) if using basin or ring irrigation. The goal is to wet the root zone thoroughly to a depth of 60-90 cm.

### 2. Second Irrigation

*   **Timing:** The second irrigation should coincide with the **fruit set stage** (typically 3-4 weeks after the first irrigation, around late March to early April). This is a critical period for cell division in the developing fruitlets and prevents premature fruit drop.
*   **Quantity:** Similar to the first irrigation, apply **50-75 mm** of water, or approximately **200-300 litres per young tree** and **400-600 litres per mature tree**. Ensure the soil moisture is maintained to support the rapid growth phase of the fruit.

### 3. Subsequent Irrigation Management

*   After the second irrigation, subsequent irrigations should be scheduled based on soil moisture depletion, tree age, fruit load, and prevailing weather conditions (evapotranspiration rates).
*   **Critical Stages:** Water stress during fruit development (April-June) and pre-harvest can severely impact fruit size, quality, and yield. Maintain adequate moisture throughout these periods.
*   **Frequency:** In Haryana's hot summer, mature apple orchards may require irrigation every 7-10 days, while younger trees might need it more frequently, especially on lighter soils. Monitor soil moisture using tensiometers or by feel method.

### 4. Sprinkler Use (Micro-irrigation for Apple)

For apple orchards in Haryana, **drip irrigation** (a form of micro-irrigation) is highly recommended over traditional overhead sprinklers due to its superior water use efficiency and suitability for orchard management. While the question mentions "sprinkler use," in the context of orchards, micro-sprinklers or drip systems are the most appropriate and efficient.

*   **Benefits of Drip Irrigation:**
    *   **Water Conservation:** Reduces water consumption by 40-60% compared to flood irrigation, crucial for water-scarce regions like Haryana.
    *   **Enhanced Nutrient Use Efficiency:** Allows for precise application of water-soluble fertilizers (fertigation) directly to the root zone, minimizing nutrient losses.
    *   **Improved Fruit Quality and Yield:** Consistent moisture supply reduces stress, leading to better fruit size, color, and overall yield.
    *   **Reduced Weed Growth:** Water is applied only to the tree's root zone, limiting water availability for weeds in inter-row spaces.
    *   **Labour Saving:** Automates irrigation, reducing manual labour requirements.
    *   **Adaptability:** Suitable for undulating terrain and various soil types.

*   **System Design and Management for Apple:**
    *   **Emitter Type:** Use pressure-compensating (PC) drippers to ensure uniform water distribution across the orchard, especially on slopes.
    *   **Discharge Rate:** Typically, emitters with a discharge rate of **4 litres per hour (LPH)** are suitable.
    *   **Number of Emitters:**
        *   For young trees (1-3 years): Place **2 emitters per tree**, one on each side of the trunk, about 30-45 cm away.
        *   For mature trees (4+ years): Increase to **4 emitters per tree**, spaced evenly around the canopy drip line, or use a drip ring.
    *   **Lateral Spacing:** Place drip laterals along each tree row.
    *   **Filtration:** Essential to prevent clogging of emitters. Use a combination of screen and disc filters.
    *   **Scheduling:** Irrigation should be scheduled based on the daily crop evapotranspiration (ETc) and the wetted area. A general guideline for mature trees in peak summer could be 2-4 hours of irrigation daily or every other day, depending on soil type and ETc. Soil moisture sensors can provide precise feedback for scheduling.
    *   **Maintenance:** Regular flushing of laterals and cleaning of filters are crucial for system longevity and efficiency.

By adopting these scientifically sound irrigation practices, especially micro-irrigation techniques, apple growers in Haryana can optimize water use, enhance productivity, and ensure the long-term sustainability of their orchards.
