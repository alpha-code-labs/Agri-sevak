Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice regarding rust diseases in Apple.

Regarding your query about Black, Brown, Yellow, White, and Red rust diseases in Apple:

*   **Black Rust, Brown Rust, Yellow Rust, and White Rust** are not known to affect Apple. These terms typically refer to rust diseases of other crops (e.g., Yellow Rust in wheat, White Rust in crucifers).
*   **Red Rust** could broadly refer to the reddish-orange lesions caused by Cedar-Apple Rust, which is the primary rust disease affecting apples. However, "Red Rust" is also a common name for an algal disease (*Cephaleuros virescens*) which is distinct from fungal rusts and not a primary concern for apples in Haryana.

Therefore, I will provide control measures for the actual fungal rust diseases that affect apple, primarily **Cedar-Apple Rust** (*Gymnosporangium juniperi-virginianae*) and related *Gymnosporangium* species (like Quince Rust and Hawthorn Rust), which are characterized by reddish-orange spots on leaves and fruit. These rusts require two hosts to complete their life cycle: apple/crabapple and junipers/cedars.

### Control Measures for Cedar-Apple Rust in Apple:

**I. Cultural Practices:**

1.  **Remove Alternate Hosts:** The most effective long-term control is to remove juniper or cedar trees within a 1-2 km radius of the apple orchard, as these are essential alternate hosts for the rust fungus.
2.  **Resistant Varieties:** Plant apple varieties known to have resistance to rust diseases. Consult local nurseries or HAU for suitable resistant varieties for Haryana's climate.
3.  **Pruning:** Prune apple trees to improve air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce leaf wetness and fungal development.
4.  **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris (leaves, twigs) from the orchard floor to reduce inoculum.

**II. Chemical Control (Fungicides):**

Fungicide applications are crucial, especially during the susceptible period when apple trees are blooming and new leaves are emerging, and rust spores are being released from nearby junipers.

**Timing of Application:**
*   **Pre-bloom to Petal Fall:** This is the most critical period for fungicide application, typically from pink bud stage through petal fall, and for 2-4 weeks thereafter, covering the period of new leaf and fruit development.
*   **Repeat Applications:** Depending on weather conditions (warm, wet weather favors disease) and disease pressure, repeat applications every 7-14 days.

**Recommended CIBRC Approved Fungicides:**

1.  **Protectant Fungicides (Contact):**
    *   **Mancozeb 75% WP:** Apply at a rate of **2.5 g/L** of water.
    *   **Zineb 75% WP:** Apply at a rate of **2.5 g/L** of water.
    *   **Captan 50% WP:** Apply at a rate of **2.0 g/L** of water.
    *   *Application:* Start at green tip stage and continue until 2-4 weeks after petal fall. These fungicides provide a protective barrier on the plant surface.

2.  **Systemic Fungicides:**
    *   **Myclobutanil 10% WP:** Apply at a rate of **0.5 g/L** of water.
    *   **Difenoconazole 25% EC:** Apply at a rate of **0.5 ml/L** of water.
    *   **Propiconazole 25% EC:** Apply at a rate of **0.5 ml/L** of water.
    *   *Application:* These fungicides are highly effective and can be applied from the pink bud stage through petal fall and beyond. They are absorbed by the plant and provide curative and protective action.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Rotation:** Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of fungicide resistance. For example, alternate between a contact fungicide like **Mancozeb** and a systemic fungicide like **Myclobutanil**.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough spray coverage of all foliage and developing fruit.
*   **Weather:** Adjust spray intervals based on weather conditions. More frequent applications may be needed during prolonged wet and warm periods.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always observe the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) specified on the fungicide label to ensure the safety of the fruit for consumption.
