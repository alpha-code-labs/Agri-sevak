As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Dieback, Twig Blight, and Tikka disease in Apple, keeping in mind the conditions in Haryana:

### Control of Dieback and Twig Blight in Apple

Dieback and Twig Blight are often symptoms rather than a single disease, indicating the death of twigs, branches, or even entire sections of the tree. They can be caused by various factors including fungal pathogens (e.g., *Botryosphaeria* spp., *Phytophthora* spp.), bacterial infections, environmental stress (drought, frost), nutrient deficiencies, or insect damage. For effective management, an integrated approach combining cultural practices and chemical control is recommended.

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Pruning:** Regularly inspect trees and prune out all affected twigs and branches. Make cuts well into healthy wood, at least 15-20 cm below the visible symptoms.
*   **Sanitation:** Disinfect pruning tools with a 10% bleach solution or methylated spirit between cuts to prevent the spread of pathogens. Remove and destroy all pruned material by burning or deep burial to reduce inoculum sources.
*   **Tree Health:** Maintain optimal tree vigour through proper nutrition, irrigation, and soil management. Avoid water stress or waterlogging.
*   **Wound Protection:** Protect trees from mechanical injuries during orchard operations, as wounds can serve as entry points for pathogens.
*   **Air Circulation:** Ensure proper tree spacing and pruning for good air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce humidity and disease development.

**2. Chemical Control (for fungal causes):**
*   **Dormant/Pre-bloom Spray:**
    *   Apply a copper-based fungicide during the dormant season or before bud break.
        *   **Copper Oxychloride** (50% WP) at 3 kg/acre in 500-600 L of water (or 6 g/L).
*   **Post-pruning/Growing Season Sprays:**
    *   After pruning affected branches, apply a protective fungicide to the cut surfaces and the entire tree. During periods conducive to disease development (e.g., high humidity, rainfall), repeat applications may be necessary.
        *   **Carbendazim** (50% WP) at 0.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Thiophanate Methyl** (70% WP) at 0.5 g/L of water.
        *   Alternatively, a contact fungicide like **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2.5 g/L of water can be used, especially in rotation with systemic fungicides.
*   **Rotation:** Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in pathogens.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough coverage of the tree canopy, including branches and twigs.

### Tikka Disease in Apple

This is not known to affect Apple. Tikka disease is a common and specific leaf spot disease primarily affecting groundnut (peanut) caused by *Cercospora arachidicola* and *Cercosporidium personatum*. Apple trees are not susceptible to Tikka disease. Apple trees can suffer from other leaf spot diseases, but "Tikka disease" is not one of them.
