Namaste, as a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice on addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium) in Apple orchards in Haryana.

**Crucial First Step: Accurate Diagnosis**
Before applying any fertilizers, it is paramount to accurately diagnose the deficiency. Visual symptoms can be misleading as they might overlap with other issues. The most reliable methods are:
1.  **Soil Testing:** Analyze your orchard soil every 2-3 years to determine the existing nutrient levels and pH.
2.  **Leaf Tissue Analysis:** This provides a precise picture of the nutrients actually absorbed by the plant. Collect samples from mature, fully expanded leaves (typically from the middle of current season's growth) during the fruit development stage.

Based on the diagnostic results, you can tailor your nutrient management plan.

### Addressing Macro-nutrient Deficiencies in Apple

#### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Pale green to yellowish leaves (especially older ones), stunted growth, reduced shoot length, smaller fruit size, and premature fruit drop.

**Correction Measures:**

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   For mature apple trees, apply 50-100 kg of actual Nitrogen per acre per year. This should be split into 2-3 applications:
        *   First application: Before bloom (e.g., late February to early March).
        *   Second application: After fruit set (e.g., late April to May).
        *   Optional third application: During fruit development if deficiency persists.
    *   Recommended fertilizers:
        *   **Urea** (46% N): Apply 108-217 kg **Urea** per acre per year, split as above.
        *   **Calcium Ammonium Nitrate** (25% N): Apply 200-400 kg **Calcium Ammonium Nitrate** per acre per year, split as above.
    *   Apply fertilizer in a ring around the tree, within the drip line, and incorporate it lightly into the soil, followed by irrigation.

*   **Foliar Application (for quick correction or mild deficiency):**
    *   Prepare a 0.5-1.0% solution of **Urea** (5-10 g of **Urea** per litre of water).
    *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, avoiding the bloom period to prevent potential phytotoxicity. Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.

#### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Dark green or purplish discoloration of leaves (especially older ones), stunted growth, poor root development, delayed maturity, and reduced fruit set.

**Correction Measures:**

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   For mature apple trees, apply 20-40 kg of P2O5 per acre per year.
    *   Apply the entire dose once, preferably during late dormancy or before bloom (e.g., January-February), to allow time for nutrient availability.
    *   Recommended fertilizers:
        *   **Single Superphosphate** (16% P2O5): Apply 125-250 kg **Single Superphosphate** per acre per year.
        *   **Diammonium Phosphate** (46% P2O5): Apply 43-87 kg **Diammonium Phosphate** per acre per year.
    *   Apply fertilizer in a ring around the tree, within the drip line, and incorporate it lightly into the soil, followed by irrigation. Phosphorus is less mobile in soil, so proper placement near roots is important.

*   **Foliar Application:** Foliar application of phosphorus is generally less effective for correcting severe deficiencies due to limited absorption and translocation. Soil application is preferred.

#### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Scorching or browning of leaf margins (especially older leaves), reduced fruit size and quality, poor fruit colour, increased susceptibility to diseases, and reduced winter hardiness.

**Correction Measures:**

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   For mature apple trees, apply 50-100 kg of K2O per acre per year. This should be split into 2 applications:
        *   First application: Before bloom (e.g., late February to early March).
        *   Second application: During fruit development (e.g., June-July).
    *   Recommended fertilizers:
        *   **Potassium Chloride** (Muriate of Potash, 60% K2O): Apply 83-167 kg **Potassium Chloride** per acre per year, split as above.
        *   **Potassium Sulphate** (Sulphate of Potash, 50% K2O): Apply 100-200 kg **Potassium Sulphate** per acre per year, split as above. **Potassium Sulphate** is often preferred for fruit crops as it also provides sulphur and is less likely to cause chloride toxicity in sensitive varieties.
    *   Apply fertilizer in a ring around the tree, within the drip line, and incorporate it lightly into the soil, followed by irrigation.

*   **Foliar Application (for quick correction or mild deficiency):**
    *   Prepare a 0.5-1.0% solution of **Potassium Sulphate** or **Potassium Nitrate** (5-10 g of fertilizer per litre of water).
    *   Apply 2-3 sprays during the fruit development stage (e.g., June-August) at 10-15 day intervals.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Soil pH:** Apple trees thrive in slightly acidic to neutral soils (pH 5.5-6.5). Soil pH significantly affects nutrient availability. If your soil pH is outside this range, it may hinder nutrient uptake even if nutrients are present. Consult HAU for recommendations on pH correction (e.g., liming for acidic soils, gypsum for alkaline soils).
*   **Watering:** Ensure adequate soil moisture after applying soil fertilizers to facilitate nutrient dissolution and uptake by roots.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management (INM):** Combine chemical fertilizers with organic manures (Farm Yard Manure, compost) to improve soil health, microbial activity, and nutrient use efficiency.
*   **Variety Specific Needs:** Nutrient requirements can vary slightly between apple varieties.
*   **Consultation:** Always consult with local agricultural extension specialists or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your orchard's unique conditions and apple variety.

By following these scientifically verified guidelines, you can effectively address macro-nutrient deficiencies in your apple orchard and ensure healthy growth and optimal fruit production.
