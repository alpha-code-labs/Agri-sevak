Namaste, Kisan bhaiyon! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU), Hisar, I understand the challenges posed by pests like Scale insects and Mealybugs in apple orchards. These sap-sucking pests can significantly reduce fruit quality and tree vigour if not managed effectively. Here's a scientifically verified approach for their control in Haryana:

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Principles:**

*   **Regular Monitoring:** Inspect your orchard regularly, especially the undersides of leaves, branches, and fruit, to detect infestations early.
*   **Orchard Hygiene:** Remove and destroy infested plant parts, weeds, and debris that can harbour pests.
*   **Pruning:** Prune out heavily infested branches during dormancy to reduce pest populations.
*   **Biological Control:** Encourage natural enemies like parasitic wasps, ladybird beetles, and lacewings. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

**Specific Control Measures:**

**For Scale Insects:**

1.  **Dormant Spray (Winter):**
    *   Apply a thorough spray of **Horticultural Mineral Oil (HMO)** at a concentration of 1.5-2% (15-20 ml per litre of water) during the dormant period (late December to February) when trees are leafless. This smothers overwintering scales.

2.  **During Growing Season (Crawler Stage):**
    *   Target the crawler stage (young, mobile scales) which is the most vulnerable. This usually occurs in spring and summer.
    *   **Chemical Option 1:** Spray with **Spirotetramat 150 OD** at 0.75 ml per litre of water. This systemic insecticide provides excellent control by moving within the plant.
    *   **Chemical Option 2:** Alternatively, use **Buprofezin 25% SC** at 1.25 ml per litre of water. This is an insect growth regulator that prevents nymphs from developing into adults.
    *   **Chemical Option 3:** For early infestations, **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL** can be used at 0.5 ml per litre of water.

**For Mealybugs:**

1.  **Early Detection and Spot Treatment:**
    *   Mealybugs often hide in protected areas. If detected early on a few branches or trees, remove them manually or spray with a strong jet of water.

2.  **Chemical Control (When infestation is widespread):**
    *   **Chemical Option 1:** Spray with **Spirotetramat 150 OD** at 0.75 ml per litre of water. Its systemic action makes it highly effective against mealybugs feeding on sap.
    *   **Chemical Option 2:** Use **Buprofezin 25% SC** at 1.25 ml per litre of water. This will disrupt the life cycle of mealybugs by preventing moulting.
    *   **Chemical Option 3:** **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL** at 0.5 ml per litre of water is also effective against mealybugs, especially the younger stages.
    *   **Chemical Option 4:** For severe infestations, **Acetamiprid 20% SP** at 0.2 g per litre of water can be used.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Timing is Crucial:** Apply insecticides when pests are in their most vulnerable stages (e.g., scale crawlers, young mealybug nymphs).
*   **Thorough Coverage:** Ensure complete coverage of the plant, including the undersides of leaves and bark crevices, as these pests often hide.
*   **Rotation of Chemicals:** To prevent resistance development, rotate insecticides with different modes of action.
*   **Safety Precautions:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) and follow the instructions on the product label for dosage, application, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   **Consult Experts:** For severe or persistent infestations, consult with HAU experts or your local agricultural extension officer for tailored advice.

This comprehensive approach, combining cultural practices with judicious use of CIBRC-approved chemicals, will help you effectively manage Scale insects and Mealybugs in your apple orchard.
