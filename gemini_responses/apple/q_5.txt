As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Scab, Canker, Gummosis, and Lichen in Apple orchards in Haryana.

### Control Measures for Apple Diseases and Conditions

#### 1. Apple Scab (Venturia inaequalis)

Apple Scab is a significant fungal disease affecting leaves, fruits, and twigs. Effective control relies on a combination of cultural practices and timely fungicidal sprays.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Sanitation: Collect and destroy fallen leaves and infected twigs during autumn to reduce primary inoculum.
    *   Pruning: Ensure proper canopy ventilation to reduce humidity.
*   **Chemical Control (Fungicidal Sprays):**
    *   **Pre-bloom to Pink Bud Stage (Preventive):**
        *   Spray with **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2.5 g/L of water.
        *   Alternatively, spray with **Captan** (50% WP) at 2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Petal Fall to Fruit Development Stage (Preventive/Curative):**
        *   Spray with **Difenoconazole** (25% EC) at 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   Alternatively, spray with **Myclobutanil** (10% WP) at 0.4 g/L of water.
        *   For eradicant action, especially if infection is observed, **Dodine** (65% WP) at 1 g/L of water can be used.
    *   **Important:** Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Follow spray schedules based on disease pressure and weather conditions.

#### 2. Apple Canker (e.g., Nectria galligena, Botryosphaeria obtusa)

Apple Canker refers to localized dead areas on bark, often caused by fungal pathogens entering through wounds.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Pruning:** Remove all infected branches well below the cankered area into healthy wood. Disinfect pruning tools (e.g., with 10% bleach solution or methylated spirit) between cuts to prevent disease spread.
    *   **Wound Protection:** Avoid mechanical injuries to trees. After pruning or any injury, immediately apply a protective fungicidal paste.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Wound Dressing:** Prepare a paste by mixing:
        *   **Copper oxychloride** (50% WP) at 50 g in 100 ml of water, or
        *   **Carbendazim** (50% WP) at 10 g in 100 ml of water, mixed with a suitable adhesive (e.g., lanolin or tree wound paint). Apply this paste thoroughly over fresh wounds and scraped cankers.
    *   **Dormant Spray:** A dormant spray of **Copper oxychloride** (50% WP) at 3 g/L of water can help reduce inoculum.

#### 3. Gummosis

Gummosis is the exudation of gummy sap from the bark, often a symptom of stress, injury, or disease (e.g., Phytophthora species).

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Identify and Address Cause:** Determine the underlying cause, which could be poor drainage, waterlogging, drought stress, nutrient deficiencies, mechanical injury, or insect borers. Rectify these issues.
    *   **Improve Tree Vigor:** Ensure proper irrigation, balanced nutrition, and good soil drainage.
    *   **Wound Management:** Carefully scrape off the gum and discolored bark until healthy tissue is exposed.
*   **Chemical Control (if pathogen suspected):**
    *   **Fungicidal Paste/Paint:** After scraping, apply a paste of **Copper oxychloride** (50% WP) at 50 g in 100 ml of water, or **Propiconazole** (25% EC) at 10 ml in 100 ml of water, mixed with an adhesive.
    *   **Soil Drench/Foliar Spray (for Phytophthora):** If root rot or collar rot due to *Phytophthora* is suspected, drench the soil around the base of the tree with **Fosetyl-aluminium** (80% WP) at 2.5 g/L of water, or apply as a foliar spray.

#### 4. Lichen

Lichens are symbiotic organisms (fungus and alga) that grow on tree bark. They are generally harmless to the tree itself, as they are not parasitic and do not draw nutrients from the tree. Their presence often indicates good air quality.

*   **Management:**
    *   **Generally Not Required:** Lichens do not cause disease or directly harm the apple tree. Control measures are usually not necessary.
    *   **If Aesthetic Concern or Excessive Growth:**
        *   **Improve Tree Vigor:** Ensure the tree is healthy and vigorous through proper nutrition and pruning. A dense canopy with poor air circulation can sometimes encourage excessive lichen growth.
        *   **Dormant Spray:** A dormant season spray of **Copper oxychloride** (50% WP) at 3 g/L of water can help reduce lichen growth, but this is primarily for aesthetic reasons and not for tree health.
        *   **Gentle Scraping:** During the dormant season, lichens can be gently scraped off the bark with a stiff brush, taking care not to damage the underlying bark.

Always read and follow the label instructions for any chemical product, including safety precautions and pre-harvest intervals. For specific recommendations tailored to your orchard's conditions, it is advisable to consult with HAU extension specialists.
