As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm that Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies are known pests of Apple in Haryana and other apple-growing regions. Effective management requires an integrated approach.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies in Apple:**

1.  **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect apple trees, especially during critical growth stages (bud break to fruit development), for adult pests, egg-laying scars, and larval damage. Pheromone traps can be used for specific beetle species if available.
2.  **Orchard Sanitation:** Remove and destroy fallen fruit, as many weevils and sawflies drop infested fruit to the ground to complete their life cycle. Prune out dead or diseased branches that might harbor bark beetles.
3.  **Cultural Practices:** Maintain tree vigor through proper nutrition and irrigation. Avoid practices that stress trees, making them more susceptible to certain beetle attacks.
4.  **Timely Intervention:** For sawflies and weevils, the most critical time for control is often shortly after petal fall, when adults are active and laying eggs, or when young larvae are present.

**Chemical Control (Use only when pest thresholds are met and in conjunction with IPM practices):**

For effective control of Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies, especially the fruit-damaging stages, the following CIBRC-approved insecticides can be used. Always follow label instructions for dosage, timing, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).

*   **For Sawflies (e.g., Apple Sawfly) and Weevils (e.g., Plum Curculio):**
    *   Apply at petal fall or when initial damage is observed.
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** 0.3 ml per litre of water (or 60 ml per acre in 200 litres of water).
    *   **Spinosad 45% SC:** 0.25 - 0.3 ml per litre of water (or 50-60 ml per acre in 200 litres of water).

*   **For General Beetles (e.g., Chafer Beetles, other defoliating beetles) and Weevils:**
    *   Apply when adult beetles or weevils are observed causing significant damage.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** 0.5 ml per litre of water (or 100 ml per acre in 200 litres of water).
    *   **Cypermethrin 25% EC:** 0.5 ml per litre of water (or 100 ml per acre in 200 litres of water).
    *   **Malathion 50% EC:** 2 ml per litre of water (or 400 ml per acre in 200 litres of water) for general control, especially against less severe infestations.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Rotation of Chemicals:** To prevent the development of resistance, rotate insecticides with different modes of action.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and application.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Strictly adhere to the PHI mentioned on the product label to ensure fruit safety.
*   **Consult Local Experts:** For specific recommendations tailored to your orchard's conditions and current pest pressure, always consult with your local HAU extension specialist.
