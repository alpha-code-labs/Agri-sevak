As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for apple cultivation in Haryana:

### Seed Treatment for Apple

Commercial apple orchards are primarily established by planting grafted saplings (budded or grafted onto rootstocks), not by sowing seeds. This method ensures genetic uniformity, desired fruit characteristics, and disease resistance from the rootstock. Therefore, **seed treatment is not a standard or recommended practice for establishing a commercial apple orchard.**

This is not known to affect Apple in the context of commercial orchard establishment.

### Soil Treatment for Apple

Effective soil treatment is crucial for establishing a healthy and productive apple orchard. This involves pre-plant preparation and targeted management of soil-borne issues.

#### A. Pre-Plant Soil Preparation (Essential for new orchards)

1.  **Soil Testing:** Before planting, conduct a comprehensive soil test to determine pH, nutrient status, organic carbon content, and presence of any soil-borne pests or pathogens (e.g., nematodes). This guides all subsequent treatments.
2.  **Organic Matter Incorporation:** Incorporate well-decomposed Farmyard Manure (FYM) or compost at a rate of 20-30 tonnes per acre during land preparation. This improves soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability.
3.  **pH Correction:**
    *   **If soil is acidic (pH < 6.0):** Apply agricultural lime (calcium carbonate) as per soil test recommendations to raise the pH to the optimal range (6.0-7.0 for apples).
    *   **If soil is alkaline/sodic (pH > 7.5):** Apply gypsum (calcium sulphate) as per soil test recommendations to improve soil structure and lower pH.

#### B. Management of Soil-borne Pests and Diseases (Based on soil test results and history)

If soil tests indicate specific problems, the following treatments can be applied:

1.  **For Nematode Management (if high population detected):**
    *   **Biological Control:**
        *   Apply **Purpureocillium lilacinum** (a bio-nematicide) at 5 kg/acre, mixed thoroughly with 100 kg of well-decomposed FYM or compost, and broadcast evenly before planting.
    *   **Chemical Control (Pre-plant incorporation):**
        *   **Fenamiphos** @ 10 kg/acre, incorporated into the soil to a depth of 15-20 cm.
        *   **Ethoprophos** @ 10 kg/acre, incorporated into the soil to a depth of 15-20 cm.

2.  **For Soil-borne Fungal Diseases (e.g., Collar Rot, Root Rot caused by *Phytophthora* spp., *Rhizoctonia* spp.):**
    *   **Biological Control:**
        *   Apply **Trichoderma viride** (a bio-fungicide) at 5 kg/acre, mixed thoroughly with 100 kg of well-decomposed FYM or compost, and broadcast evenly before planting.
    *   **Chemical Control (Pre-plant drench or incorporation):**
        *   **Metalaxyl** 8% + **Mancozeb** 64% WP @ 2.5 kg/acre, applied as a soil drench around the planting pits or incorporated into the soil.
        *   **Fosetyl-aluminium** 80% WP @ 2.5 kg/acre, applied as a soil drench around the planting pits or incorporated into the soil.

3.  **For General Soil Health and Nutrient Mobilization:**
    *   **Bio-fertilizers:**
        *   Apply **Azotobacter** (nitrogen fixer) and Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria (PSB) each at 2-4 kg/acre, mixed with 100 kg of FYM or compost, and broadcast evenly before planting. These help in making nutrients available to the plants.

**Note:** Always ensure proper soil moisture for optimal efficacy of both biological and chemical treatments. Follow manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions when handling any chemical.
