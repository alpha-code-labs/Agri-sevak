Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the challenges posed by soil pests in apple orchards. Termites and Root-knot nematodes can significantly impact the health and productivity of your apple trees. Here is scientifically verified advice for their control:

**General Management Practices (Integrated Pest Management - IPM):**

Before resorting to chemical control, it is crucial to adopt good cultural practices that can reduce pest incidence:

*   **Orchard Hygiene:** Regularly remove dead wood, stumps, and other organic debris from the orchard, as these can serve as breeding grounds for termites.
*   **Soil Health:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost. Healthy soil with good organic matter content promotes beneficial microorganisms that can naturally suppress nematodes and improve tree vigour, making them more resilient.
*   **Proper Irrigation:** Avoid waterlogging, which can stress trees and make them more susceptible to pests. Maintain optimal soil moisture.
*   **Resistant Rootstocks:** Where available and suitable for your specific agro-climatic conditions in Haryana, consider using apple rootstocks known for their resistance or tolerance to nematodes.

**1. Control of Termites (Deemak)**

Termites can damage the roots and collar region of apple trees, leading to weakening, poor growth, and in severe cases, tree mortality.

**Chemical Control (Soil Drenching):**

For existing infestations or as a preventive measure in high-risk areas, soil drenching around the base of the trees is effective.

*   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC:** Mix **Chlorpyrifos** at 2.5 - 5 ml per litre of water. Drench the soil around the base of each tree with 5-10 litres of this solution, ensuring it penetrates the root zone.
*   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Mix **Imidacloprid** at 0.5 - 1 ml per litre of water. Drench the soil around the base of each tree with 5-10 litres of this solution.
*   **Fipronil 5% SC:** Mix **Fipronil** at 1 - 2 ml per litre of water. Drench the soil around the base of each tree with 5-10 litres of this solution.

**2. Control of Nematodes (Sutrakrimi) - Specifically Root-knot Nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.)**

Root-knot nematodes cause characteristic galls on roots, leading to stunted growth, nutrient deficiencies, reduced yield, and increased susceptibility to other diseases.

**Chemical Control (Nematicides):**

Application of nematicides can help manage nematode populations, especially in heavily infested areas.

*   **Fluopyram 34.48% SC:** Mix **Fluopyram** at 0.625 - 1.25 ml per litre of water. Apply 5-10 litres of this solution per tree as a soil drench, ensuring it reaches the root zone. This can be applied during active root growth.
*   **Cadusafos 10% GR:** Apply **Cadusafos** granules at 10-15 kg per acre. Spread the granules evenly around the base of the trees within the drip line and lightly incorporate them into the soil, followed immediately by irrigation.
*   **Ethoprophos 10% GR:** Apply **Ethoprophos** granules at 10-15 kg per acre. Spread the granules evenly around the base of the trees within the drip line and lightly incorporate them into the soil, followed immediately by irrigation.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Safety First:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, and protective clothing while handling and applying any chemicals.
*   **Read Labels:** Strictly follow the instructions, dosage rates, and safety precautions mentioned on the product label.
*   **Timing of Application:** For nematicides, application is often most effective when nematodes are active and roots are growing, typically during spring or post-monsoon.
*   **Consult Experts:** For severe or persistent problems, it is advisable to get a soil test done to confirm the pest presence and population density, and consult with local agricultural extension officers or HAU experts for tailored advice.
*   **Environmental Impact:** Use chemicals judiciously to minimize environmental impact and protect beneficial soil organisms.

By combining good cultural practices with targeted chemical applications when necessary, you can effectively manage soil pests in your apple orchard and ensure healthy, productive trees.
