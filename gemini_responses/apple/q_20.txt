Namaste,

Addressing micronutrient deficiencies in apple orchards is crucial for optimal growth, yield, and fruit quality. As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I strongly recommend that the first step always be a comprehensive soil test and, if possible, a leaf tissue analysis. This will accurately identify the specific deficiencies and their severity, allowing for targeted and efficient nutrient management.

Here's how to address the common micronutrient deficiencies in apple:

### General Recommendations:
*   **Soil Testing:** Conduct soil tests every 2-3 years to monitor nutrient levels.
*   **Leaf Tissue Analysis:** Perform leaf tissue analysis during the growing season (typically mid-summer) to confirm deficiencies and assess nutrient uptake.
*   **Timing:** Foliar applications are generally most effective when applied during periods of active growth, avoiding extreme temperatures and strong sunlight.
*   **Water Quality:** Ensure the water used for sprays has an appropriate pH and is free from impurities that might affect nutrient availability.
*   **Compatibility:** Always check the compatibility of different chemicals before mixing them for foliar sprays.

### Specific Micronutrient Deficiencies:

#### 1. Zinc (Zn)
*   **Deficiency Symptoms:** Small, narrow leaves (little leaf), rosetting of terminal leaves, shortened internodes, and interveinal chlorosis.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application (if severe deficiency):** Apply 10-25 kg/acre of **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (21% Zn) or 5-10 kg/acre of **Zinc sulphate monohydrate** (33% Zn) once every 2-3 years, based on soil test recommendations.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Spray 0.2-0.5% solution (2-5 g/L) of **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (21% Zn) or 0.1% solution (1 g/L) of **Zinc EDTA** (12% Zn). Apply 2-3 sprays starting from petal fall at 15-20 day intervals.

#### 2. Iron (Fe) / Ferrous
*   **Deficiency Symptoms:** Pronounced interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, which may turn almost white in severe cases. Often observed in high pH (calcareous) soils.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application (for persistent issues in high pH soils):** Apply 5-10 kg/acre of **Iron EDTA** (12% Fe) or **Iron DTPA** (11% Fe) or **Iron EDDHA** (6% Fe) annually. For less severe cases or lower pH soils, 25-50 kg/acre of **Ferrous sulphate** (19% Fe) can be applied.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Spray 0.2-0.5% solution (2-5 g/L) of **Ferrous sulphate** (19% Fe) or 0.1% solution (1 g/L) of **Iron EDTA** (12% Fe). Repeat sprays at 10-15 day intervals until symptoms disappear.

#### 3. Boron (B)
*   **Deficiency Symptoms:** Dieback of growing points, internal corking or external cracking of fruit, small and misshapen fruit, brittle leaves, and poor fruit set.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 5-10 kg/acre of **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate, 10.5-11.3% B) or 2-4 kg/acre of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (20.5% B) once every 3-4 years, based on soil test.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Spray 0.1-0.2% solution (1-2 g/L) of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (20.5% B) or **Boric acid** (17% B). Apply one spray at pink bud stage and another at petal fall.

#### 4. Calcium (Ca)
*   **Deficiency Symptoms:** Primarily affects fruit quality, leading to disorders like bitter pit, cork spot, and water core. Young leaves may show tip burn.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** While soil application of **Gypsum** (Calcium sulphate dihydrate) or **Calcium nitrate** can improve soil calcium, it is generally less effective in directly addressing fruit calcium deficiencies due to poor translocation.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Apply multiple sprays of 0.5-1.0% solution (5-10 g/L) of **Calcium chloride** (75-78% CaCl2) or **Calcium nitrate** (19% Ca). Start spraying 2-3 weeks after petal fall and continue at 10-14 day intervals, up to 4-6 sprays, especially during fruit development.

#### 5. Magnesium (Mg)
*   **Deficiency Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, starting from the margins and progressing inwards, often with reddish-purple discoloration. Premature leaf drop.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 25-50 kg/acre of **Magnesium sulphate** (9.6% Mg) or 100-200 kg/acre of **Dolomite** (Calcium magnesium carbonate) if soil pH also needs adjustment.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Spray 0.5-1.0% solution (5-10 g/L) of **Magnesium sulphate** (9.6% Mg). Apply 2-3 sprays during the growing season, starting when symptoms appear.

#### 6. Manganese (Mn)
*   **Deficiency Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, often appearing as a fine net-like pattern. Leaves may become mottled or pale green.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 10-20 kg/acre of **Manganese sulphate** (28-30% Mn) based on soil test.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Spray 0.2-0.5% solution (2-5 g/L) of **Manganese sulphate** (28-30% Mn) or 0.1% solution (1 g/L) of **Manganese EDTA** (12% Mn). Apply 2-3 sprays during the active growth period, starting when symptoms are visible.

Always remember that balanced nutrition is key. Over-application of any micronutrient can lead to toxicity or induce deficiencies of other nutrients. Consult with your local agricultural extension office for specific recommendations tailored to your orchard's conditions.
