As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Apple orchards in Haryana:

### Grasshopper

Grasshoppers are polyphagous pests that can feed on the leaves of young apple trees, especially during outbreaks or when other vegetation is scarce.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Maintain a weed-free orchard, as weeds can provide shelter and alternative food sources for grasshoppers.
    *   Deep ploughing during autumn can expose grasshopper eggs to predators and adverse weather conditions.
    *   Hand-picking can be effective for small infestations, especially in young orchards.
*   **Chemical Control (Apply only when infestation levels warrant and follow label instructions carefully):**
    *   **Malathion** (50% EC): 1.25 L per 500 litres of water per acre.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** (5% EC): 200-300 ml per 500 litres of water per acre.
    *   **Chlorpyrifos** (20% EC): 1.25 L per 500 litres of water per acre.

### Painted bug

This is not known to affect Apple.

### Red cotton bug

This is not known to affect Apple.

### Black ants

This is not known to affect Apple as a primary pest. While ants may be present in an orchard, they typically do not directly feed on or damage apple trees. Their presence is often associated with other sap-sucking pests (like aphids or mealybugs) from which they collect honeydew. Controlling the primary sap-sucking pest usually mitigates the ant problem.
