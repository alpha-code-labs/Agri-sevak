As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an integrated approach for weed management in apple orchards, combining cultural, mechanical, and chemical methods. It is crucial to maintain a weed-free zone around the tree base, especially for young trees, to minimize competition for water and nutrients.

Here's the advice for the specific weeds mentioned:

1.  **Orobanche (Broomrape):**
    This is not known to affect Apple. Orobanche species are parasitic weeds primarily affecting dicotyledonous crops like mustard, tomato, brinjal, tobacco, and sunflower, not typically woody perennials like apple.

2.  **General Broadleaf and Narrowleaf Weeds (including Bathu, Congress grass, Phalaris minor):**
    For effective control, a combination of pre-emergence and post-emergence herbicides is recommended, applied as directed sprays to avoid contact with the apple tree's foliage and bark.

    **A. Pre-emergence Herbicides (Apply to moist soil before weed emergence):**
    These herbicides form a chemical barrier in the soil, preventing weed seeds from germinating. Apply after orchard cultivation or before the onset of monsoon/irrigation.

    *   **For Broadleaf and some Narrowleaf Weeds:**
        *   **Diuron** 80% WP: 1.0 - 1.6 kg/acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water.
        *   **Oxyfluorfen** 23.5% EC: 400 - 800 ml/acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water.
        *   **Pendimethalin** 30% EC: 1.0 - 1.3 litres/acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water.

    **B. Post-emergence Herbicides (Apply when weeds are actively growing, generally 2-4 leaf stage):**

    *   **Non-selective Herbicides (Directed Spray Only):**
        These herbicides kill all green vegetation they come into contact with. **Extreme care must be taken to ensure the spray does not drift onto the apple tree's foliage, green bark, or suckers.** Use a protective shield if necessary.

        *   **Glyphosate** 41% SL: 1.0 - 1.5 litres/acre (or 10-15 ml/L water for spot treatment) for general broadleaf and narrowleaf weeds, including Bathu, Congress grass, and Phalaris minor. Apply when weeds are 15-20 cm tall.
        *   **Paraquat dichloride** 24% SL: 600 - 800 ml/acre (or 6-8 ml/L water for spot treatment) for quick knockdown of young weeds. Effective against Bathu, Congress grass, and Phalaris minor.
        *   **Glufosinate-ammonium** 13.5% SL: 1.0 - 1.5 litres/acre. Offers good control of a wide range of broadleaf and narrowleaf weeds with less translocation than glyphosate, making it slightly safer if minor drift occurs, but still requires careful directed application.

    *   **Selective Herbicides (for Narrowleaf Weeds/Grasses like Phalaris minor):**
        These herbicides specifically target grasses and are safe for broadleaf crops like apple.

        *   **Quizalofop-ethyl** 5% EC: 400 - 500 ml/acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water.
        *   **Fluazifop-P-butyl** 13.4% EC: 500 - 750 ml/acre, mixed in 200-300 litres of water.

    **C. Specific for Congress Grass (Parthenium hysterophorus):**
    *   **Metribuzin** 70% WP: 300 - 500 g/acre, applied as pre-emergence or early post-emergence (when Parthenium is very young).
    *   For established Parthenium, **Glyphosate** (as mentioned above) is effective as a directed spray. Manual removal with protective gear (gloves, mask) before flowering is also highly recommended to prevent seed dispersal and allergic reactions.

3.  **Amarbail (Cuscuta spp.):**
    Amarbail is a parasitic weed that can be very problematic. Control is challenging once it establishes.

    *   **Prevention:** Use clean planting material and ensure no Cuscuta seeds are introduced with irrigation water or farm machinery.
    *   **Manual Removal:** The most effective method is to manually remove the infested weeds/plants before the Cuscuta flowers and sets seeds. If it has attached to the apple tree, carefully remove the affected branches or scrape off the Cuscuta strands.
    *   **Chemical Control (Limited):**
        *   **Paraquat dichloride** 24% SL: Can be used as a directed spot spray (6-8 ml/L water) to burn off Cuscuta along with its host weed. This requires extreme precision to avoid contact with the apple tree.
        *   Pre-emergence herbicides like **Pendimethalin** (as mentioned above) can offer some suppression of Cuscuta germination if applied before its emergence.

**General Recommendations for Herbicide Application:**

*   **Timing:** Apply pre-emergence herbicides to moist soil. Apply post-emergence herbicides when weeds are young and actively growing for best results.
*   **Directed Spray:** Always use a protective hood or shield when applying non-selective herbicides to prevent drift onto apple trees.
*   **Water Volume:** Ensure adequate water volume (200-300 litres/acre) for thorough coverage.
*   **Rotation:** Rotate herbicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of herbicide resistance.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals. Read and follow label instructions carefully.
*   **Cultural Practices:** Regular inter-cultivation, mulching around the tree base, and maintaining a healthy orchard floor can significantly reduce weed pressure.
