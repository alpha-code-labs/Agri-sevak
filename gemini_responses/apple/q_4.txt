While 'Parawilt' is not a recognized specific disease affecting Apple, wilting symptoms can occur due to various reasons, including *Verticillium wilt* (caused by *Verticillium dahliae*). *Verticillium wilt* can affect apple trees, particularly young ones, though it is generally not a major widespread problem in established orchards in Haryana.

Control measures for *Verticillium wilt* in Apple focus primarily on prevention and cultural practices, as chemical control is often challenging once the disease is established:

**I. Cultural and Preventative Measures:**
*   **Site Selection:** Avoid planting new apple orchards in fields with a history of *Verticillium wilt* in susceptible crops like potato, tomato, cotton, or brinjal.
*   **Resistant Rootstocks:** Where available and suitable for local conditions, consider using rootstocks that show some tolerance to *Verticillium* species.
*   **Soil Solarization:** For nursery beds or small areas intended for new planting, soil solarization during hot summer months can help reduce pathogen inoculum.
*   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy severely infected or dead plant material to reduce inoculum sources.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Maintain balanced soil fertility. Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can promote succulent growth that may be more susceptible.
*   **Water Management:** Ensure proper irrigation to avoid both water stress and waterlogging, as both can predispose trees to disease.
*   **Weed Control:** Manage weeds, as some can act as alternative hosts for the pathogen.

**II. Biological Control:**
*   **Soil Application:** Incorporate beneficial antagonistic fungi into the soil, especially during planting or as a drench for young trees.
    *   **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum**: Apply as a soil drench or mix with farmyard manure (FYM) at 2.5 kg/acre.

**III. Chemical Control (Limited Efficacy for Established Trees):**
*   **Pre-Plant Soil Treatment (for new orchards/nursery beds):**
    *   **Dazomet** (granular): Apply at 200-300 kg/acre as a soil fumigant 3-4 weeks before planting. Ensure proper soil moisture and sealing.
    *   **Metam sodium** (liquid): Apply at 200-300 L/acre as a soil fumigant 3-4 weeks before planting, followed by proper sealing.
*   **Fungicide Drench (for young trees with early symptoms, limited efficacy):**
    *   **Carbendazim**: Drench the soil around the base of affected young trees at 1-2 g/L of water. Repeat if necessary, but efficacy for established vascular wilt is limited.
    *   **Thiophanate methyl**: Drench the soil around the base of affected young trees at 1-1.5 g/L of water. Efficacy for established vascular wilt is limited.

It is crucial to note that once *Verticillium wilt* symptoms are severe in an established tree, chemical treatments are generally not effective in curing the tree. Focus on prevention and maintaining tree vigor.
