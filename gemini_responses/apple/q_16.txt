As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I emphasize that precise fertilizer recommendations for apple cultivation are best determined through a comprehensive soil test report. Soil testing, conducted every 2-3 years, provides crucial information about the existing nutrient status of your orchard soil, allowing for tailored and efficient nutrient management.

The following recommendations are general guidelines for a *bearing apple orchard* in Haryana, assuming medium soil fertility. Doses for non-bearing trees are significantly lower.

**General NPK Requirement for a Bearing Apple Tree (per year):**
*   **Nitrogen (N):** 500-700 g per tree
*   **Phosphorus (P2O5):** 250-350 g per tree
*   **Potassium (K2O):** 500-700 g per tree
*   **Sulphur (S):** 20-30 g per tree

Based on these requirements, here are the recommended doses for the specific fertilizers you mentioned:

**1. Urea (46% N)**
*   **Dose:** 1.1 kg to 1.5 kg per tree per year.
*   **Timing:** Apply in 2-3 split doses.
    *   First dose (50%): Before flowering (February-March).
    *   Second dose (25%): After fruit set (April-May).
    *   Third dose (25%): During fruit development (June), if needed.

**2. Nano-Urea (4% N)**
*   **Dose:** 2-4 ml/L of water for foliar spray.
*   **Timing:** 2-3 sprays during critical growth stages such as pre-flowering, fruit set, and fruit development.
*   **Note:** Nano-Urea is a supplementary source of nitrogen and can help reduce the application of granular **Urea** by 25-50%. It is not a complete replacement for the bulk nitrogen requirement of mature trees.

**3. DAP (Di-Ammonium Phosphate - 18% N, 46% P2O5)**
*   **Dose:** 550 g to 750 g per tree per year. (This will also supply 100-135 g of Nitrogen).
*   **Timing:** Apply the entire dose before flowering (February-March).

**4. Nano-DAP (8% N, 16% P2O5)**
*   **Dose:** 2-4 ml/L of water for foliar spray.
*   **Timing:** 2-3 sprays during critical growth stages such as pre-flowering, fruit set, and fruit development.
*   **Note:** Nano-DAP is a supplementary source of nitrogen and phosphorus and can help reduce the application of granular **DAP** or **SSP** by 25-50%.

**5. NPK (Compound Fertilizers)**
*   **Dose:** The dose depends on the specific NPK ratio (e.g., 19:19:19, 12:32:16) and the nutrient requirement based on soil test.
*   For water-soluble NPK fertilizers (e.g., **19:19:19**) used for foliar spray or fertigation:
    *   **Foliar Spray:** 5-10 g/L of water.
    *   **Timing:** During active growth and fruit development stages.
*   **Note:** It is generally recommended to apply N, P, and K separately based on specific requirements, but compound NPKs can be used if their ratio aligns with the crop's needs.

**6. SSP (Single Super Phosphate - 16% P2O5, 11% S)**
*   **Dose:** 1.6 kg to 2.2 kg per tree per year. (This will also supply 175-240 g of Sulphur, often meeting the entire Sulphur requirement).
*   **Timing:** Apply the entire dose before flowering (February-March).

**7. Potash (Muriate of Potash - MOP, 60% K2O)**
*   **Dose:** 850 g to 1.2 kg per tree per year.
*   **Timing:** Apply in 2 split doses.
    *   First dose (50%): Before flowering (February-March).
    *   Second dose (50%): During fruit development (May-June).

**8. Sulphur (Elemental Sulphur - 90% S)**
*   **Dose:** 25 g to 35 g per tree per year.
*   **Timing:** Apply before flowering (February-March).
*   **Note:** If **SSP** is used as the primary phosphorus source, additional **Sulphur** may not be required as **SSP** provides a significant amount of Sulphur.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Soil Testing:** This is the most critical step for accurate fertilizer recommendations. The doses provided are general and may need adjustment based on your specific soil conditions.
*   **Tree Age:** Young, non-bearing trees require significantly less fertilizer. Gradually increase the dose as the tree matures and starts bearing fruit.
*   **Application Method:** Fertilizers can be applied by broadcasting in the root zone, ring method (in a circle around the tree, away from the trunk), or through fertigation (for water-soluble fertilizers). Ensure fertilizers are incorporated into the soil and followed by irrigation.
*   **Micronutrients:** Apple trees also require micronutrients like Boron, Zinc, Manganese, Iron, and Copper. If soil tests indicate deficiencies, apply appropriate micronutrient formulations as foliar sprays or soil applications.
*   **Organic Matter:** Incorporating farmyard manure (FYM) or compost (20-30 kg per tree per year) significantly improves soil health, nutrient retention, and microbial activity, enhancing fertilizer efficiency. Apply FYM during winter dormancy.
*   **Irrigation:** Adequate and timely irrigation is essential for nutrient uptake and overall tree health.

Always consult with local agricultural experts or HAU specialists for specific advice tailored to your orchard's conditions.
