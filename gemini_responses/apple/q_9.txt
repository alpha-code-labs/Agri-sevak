Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I understand the challenges posed by mites in apple orchards. Both Red spider mite (*Tetranychus urticae*) and Rust mite (*Aculus schlechtendali*) can cause significant damage if not managed effectively. Here's a scientifically verified approach for their control in Haryana:

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Mites in Apple:**

A holistic approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods is crucial for sustainable mite management.

1.  **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect apple trees, especially the undersides of leaves, for the presence of mites, their eggs, and webbing (for red spider mites). Early detection is key.
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Pruning:** Ensure proper pruning to improve air circulation within the canopy, which can reduce mite populations.
    *   **Weed Management:** Remove weeds in and around the orchard as they can serve as alternate hosts for mites.
    *   **Proper Irrigation:** Avoid water stress, as stressed plants are more susceptible to mite infestations.
3.  **Biological Control:** Conserve natural enemies such as predatory mites (*Amblyseius* spp.), ladybird beetles, and lacewings, which feed on pest mites. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

**Chemical Control (Acaricides):**

When mite populations exceed economic thresholds, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves.

Here are some CIBRC-approved acaricides effective against Red spider mite and Rust mite in Apple:

*   **For Red Spider Mite (Tetranychus urticae):**
    *   **Spiromesifen** (e.g., 240 SC formulation): Apply at 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Fenpyroximate** (e.g., 5 SC formulation): Apply at 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Propargite** (e.g., 57 EC formulation): Apply at 1.0-1.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Hexythiazox** (e.g., 5.45 EC formulation): Apply at 0.5 ml per litre of water. This is primarily ovicidal and larvicidal.
    *   **Fenazaquin** (e.g., 10 EC formulation): Apply at 0.5-0.75 ml per litre of water.

*   **For Rust Mite (Aculus schlechtendali):**
    *   **Wettable Sulphur** (e.g., 80 WP formulation): Apply at 2.0-3.0 g per litre of water. This is particularly effective against rust mites and also helps in powdery mildew control, especially during early season.
    *   **Abamectin** (e.g., 1.9 EC formulation): Apply at 0.3-0.5 ml per litre of water. Effective against both rust mites and spider mites.
    *   **Fenpyroximate** (e.g., 5 SC formulation): Apply at 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Fenazaquin** (e.g., 10 EC formulation): Apply at 0.5-0.75 ml per litre of water.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Rotation:** Always rotate acaricides from different chemical groups (different modes of action) to prevent resistance development in mite populations.
*   **Timing:** Apply acaricides when mite populations are building up, not when they are already severe.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure complete and thorough coverage of the foliage, especially the undersides of leaves where mites reside.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Strictly adhere to the pre-harvest interval mentioned on the product label to ensure fruit safety.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) while handling and spraying chemicals.

For specific recommendations tailored to your orchard's situation, it is always advisable to consult with local agricultural extension specialists.
