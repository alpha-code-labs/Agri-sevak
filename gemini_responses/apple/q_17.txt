As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following doses for organic manures in Apple cultivation, keeping in mind the specific needs of temperate fruit trees and the agro-climatic conditions of Haryana where apples are grown (e.g., higher altitudes or specific microclimates):

The application of organic manures is crucial for improving soil health, nutrient availability, water retention, and overall tree vigor and fruit quality in apple orchards.

Here are the recommended doses:

*   **Farm Yard Manure (FYM):**
    *   **Dose:** 20-50 kg per mature tree per year. For young trees (1-3 years), start with 5-10 kg and gradually increase.
    *   **Application:** Apply in late autumn after harvest or early spring before bud break. Spread evenly around the tree basin (within the drip line) and lightly incorporate into the soil.
    *   **Note:** Ensure the FYM is well-decomposed to avoid nutrient immobilization and pest issues.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   **Dose:** 5-10 kg per mature tree per year. For young trees, 1-3 kg.
    *   **Application:** Can be applied as a partial replacement or supplement to FYM. Apply in a similar manner and timing as FYM.
    *   **Note:** Vermicompost is richer in nutrients and beneficial microbes than FYM, so lower doses are effective.

*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract):**
    *   **Sagarika** is a bio-stimulant that enhances nutrient uptake, promotes root growth, improves flowering, fruit set, and stress tolerance.
    *   **Foliar Spray:**
        *   **Dose:** 2.5 - 5 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Application:** Apply 2-3 sprays during critical growth stages:
            *   First spray: Pre-bloom stage (pink bud stage).
            *   Second spray: After fruit set (pea size fruit).
            *   Third spray: During fruit development/enlargement.
    *   **Soil Drench/Fertigation:**
        *   **Dose:** 500 ml - 1 litre per acre, or 50-100 ml per mature tree mixed with irrigation water.
        *   **Application:** Can be applied during active growth phases, particularly during periods of stress or high nutrient demand.

**General Recommendations:**

*   Always conduct a soil test to determine the specific nutrient status of your orchard soil. This will help in fine-tuning the exact doses of organic and inorganic fertilizers.
*   Integrate organic manures with balanced chemical fertilization based on soil test results for optimal apple production.
*   Ensure proper irrigation after applying organic manures to help in nutrient dissolution and uptake.
