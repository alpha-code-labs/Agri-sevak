As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling borers, caterpillars, and leaf folders in Apple orchards in Haryana.

### Control of Borers in Apple

Borers can cause significant damage by tunneling into the trunk, branches, and twigs, weakening the tree and potentially leading to its death.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Regularly inspect trees for signs of borer activity such as frass (sawdust-like excretions), gum exudation, or entry/exit holes.
    *   Prune and destroy infested branches during the dormant season to remove larvae.
    *   Maintain tree vigor through proper nutrition and irrigation to help trees withstand minor infestations.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **For active trunk borers:** Inject a solution of insecticide directly into the borer holes using a syringe. After injection, seal the holes with mud or grafting wax to trap the fumes and prevent re-entry.
        *   **Chlorpyriphos** 20% EC: 2.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **For systemic control or prevention of new infestations (especially for shot-hole borers):**
        *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: 0.5 ml/L of water (as a drench around the base of the tree or foliar spray for adult beetles, if applicable).
    *   **For surface-feeding borers or adult beetles:** Apply a contact insecticide to the trunk and main branches.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: 0.5 ml/L of water.

### Control of Caterpillars and Leaf folders in Apple

These pests include various lepidopteran larvae that feed on leaves, buds, and sometimes fruits, causing defoliation and direct damage. Leaf folders specifically tie or fold leaves to feed within the protected structure.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Regularly monitor for egg masses and young larvae on leaves and twigs.
    *   In small orchards, hand-picking and destroying larvae can be effective.
    *   Prune and destroy infested twigs/leaves to reduce pest populations.
*   **Biological Control:**
    *   Application of **Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)** formulations is highly effective against young caterpillars and is safe for beneficial insects.
        *   **Bacillus thuringiensis** (various formulations): Follow manufacturer's recommended dose, typically 1-2 kg/acre or 2-4 g/L of water.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   For effective control of various caterpillars and leaf folders, rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.
        *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC: 0.3 ml/L of water.
        *   **Emamectin Benzoate** 5% SG: 0.2 g/L of water.
        *   **Flubendiamide** 20% WG: 0.2 g/L of water.
        *   **Indoxacarb** 14.5% SC: 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Spinosad** 45% SC: 0.25 ml/L of water.

### Diamondback Moth in Apple

*   This is not known to affect Apple. Diamondback moth (*Plutella xylostella*) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower, mustard).

### General Recommendations

*   Always read and strictly follow the label instructions of any pesticide before use, including dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) for all applied chemicals to ensure fruit safety.
*   Adopt an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach by combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods for sustainable and effective pest control.
*   For specific recommendations tailored to your local conditions and current pest pressure, consult with the agricultural extension services at HAU, Hisar, or your nearest Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK).
