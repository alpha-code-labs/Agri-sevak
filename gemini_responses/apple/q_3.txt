As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide scientifically verified advice for controlling various rot types in Apple. It's important to understand that many "rot" terms refer to symptoms caused by a range of fungal and oomycete pathogens, often requiring an integrated management approach.

Here's a comprehensive guide:

### General Principles for Rot Management in Apple

Before delving into specific rot types, certain cultural practices are fundamental to preventing and managing all forms of rot:

*   **Orchard Hygiene:** Regularly remove and destroy diseased plant material (pruned branches, fallen leaves, mummified fruit).
*   **Proper Drainage:** Ensure good soil drainage to prevent waterlogging, which is a major predisposing factor for root and collar rots. Consider raised beds in heavy soils.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide adequate, balanced nutrients to maintain tree vigour, but avoid excessive nitrogen, which can make tissues more susceptible.
*   **Pruning:** Prune trees to improve air circulation within the canopy, reducing humidity and fungal growth. Sterilize pruning tools between trees.
*   **Irrigation Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation where possible, or irrigate early in the day to allow foliage to dry. Use drip irrigation to keep trunks dry.
*   **Resistant Rootstocks:** Where available and suitable for local conditions, choose rootstocks known for resistance to specific rot pathogens (e.g., *Phytophthora*).
*   **Avoid Injury:** Protect trunks and roots from mechanical injury during cultivation, which can create entry points for pathogens.

### Specific Rot Types and Control Measures

#### 1. Root Rot, Collar Rot, Crown Rot, Foot Rot, and Stem Rot (Primarily *Phytophthora* species)

These are often caused by water mould pathogens like *Phytophthora cactorum* and other *Phytophthora* species. Symptoms include darkening of bark at the soil line, reddish-brown discoloration of the inner bark, girdling of the trunk, wilting, decline, and eventual death of the tree. Stem rot can occur if the infection extends upwards from the collar.

**Cultural Control:**
*   Improve soil drainage.
*   Plant trees on slight mounds to keep the crown dry.
*   Avoid piling soil or mulch against the trunk.
*   Use resistant rootstocks (e.g., some Geneva series rootstocks show better resistance than susceptible ones like M.7, MM.106, M.26).

**Chemical Control (Preventive and Curative for early stages):**
*   **Fosetyl-aluminium:** Apply as a foliar spray at 2.5-3.0 g/L of water, or as a soil drench around the base of the tree. Repeat as per label instructions.
*   **Propamocarb hydrochloride:** Apply as a soil drench at 2.0-3.0 ml/L of water around the base of the tree.
*   **Metalaxyl-M:** Apply as a soil drench at 0.5-1.0 g/L of water around the base of the tree.
*   **Copper oxychloride:** For established trees, a paste made with 50 g of **Copper oxychloride** in 100 ml of water can be painted on the affected trunk area after scraping off diseased bark.

#### 2. Black Rot (Fruit Rot, Canker, Leaf Spot)

Caused by *Botryosphaeria obtusa*. This disease affects fruit (dark, concentric rings, mummification), branches (sunken cankers), and leaves (frog-eye leaf spot).

**Cultural Control:**
*   Prune out and destroy all cankered branches during dormant season.
*   Remove all mummified fruit from trees and the orchard floor.
*   Maintain good orchard sanitation.

**Chemical Control (Foliar Sprays, especially during fruit development):**
*   **Captan:** Apply at 2.0-2.5 g/L of water, starting from petal fall and repeating at 7-14 day intervals.
*   **Mancozeb:** Apply at 2.0-2.5 g/L of water, especially during the early growing season.
*   **Thiophanate-methyl:** Apply at 0.7-1.0 g/L of water, particularly effective against cankers and post-harvest rots.
*   **Pyraclostrobin + Boscalid:** Apply at 0.75-1.0 g/L of water for broad-spectrum fruit rot control.
*   **Difenoconazole:** Apply at 0.5 ml/L of water, effective against various fruit rots.

#### 3. Other Fruit Rots (e.g., Bitter Rot, White Rot, Blue Mold, Gray Mold)

These are caused by various fungi like *Colletotrichum* spp. (Bitter Rot), *Botryosphaeria dothidea* (White Rot), *Penicillium expansum* (Blue Mold), and *Botrytis cinerea* (Gray Mold). They manifest as various forms of fruit decay, often post-harvest.

**Cultural Control:**
*   Harvest fruit carefully to avoid bruises and wounds.
*   Rapidly cool fruit after harvest.
*   Maintain strict sanitation in packing houses and storage facilities.
*   Remove diseased fruit from the orchard.

**Chemical Control (Pre-harvest and Post-harvest):**
*   **Captan:** (As above for Black Rot) Effective against many pre-harvest fruit rots.
*   **Mancozeb:** (As above for Black Rot)
*   **Thiophanate-methyl:** (As above for Black Rot) Can be used as a pre-harvest spray or post-harvest dip (check label for specific post-harvest use).
*   **Pyraclostrobin + Boscalid:** (As above for Black Rot)
*   **Difenoconazole:** (As above for Black Rot)
*   **Fludioxonil:** Can be used as a post-harvest dip or drench for control of *Penicillium* and *Botrytis* rots (follow specific label instructions for post-harvest application).

#### 4. Seed Rot and Seedling Rot (Damping-off)

These are primarily issues in nurseries or when germinating apple seeds (which is not common for commercial fruit production, but relevant for rootstock propagation). Caused by pathogens like *Pythium*, *Phytophthora*, and *Rhizoctonia*.

**Cultural Control:**
*   Use sterilized growing media.
*   Ensure proper drainage in seed trays/beds.
*   Avoid overwatering.
*   Provide good air circulation.

**Chemical Control (Seed Treatment / Soil Drench):**
*   **Thiram:** Apply as a seed treatment at 2.0-3.0 g/kg of seeds.
*   **Captan:** Apply as a seed treatment at 2.0-3.0 g/kg of seeds, or as a soil drench at 2.0 g/L of water.
*   **Carbendazim:** Apply as a soil drench at 1.0 g/L of water for control of *Rhizoctonia* and other fungal seedling rots.
*   **Propamocarb hydrochloride:** Apply as a soil drench at 2.0-3.0 ml/L of water for control of *Pythium* and *Phytophthora* damping-off.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the chemical product label, including dosage, application timing, pre-harvest intervals (PHI), and safety precautions.
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in pathogens.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension specialists or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your orchard's conditions and the prevailing disease pressure in Haryana.
