As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Apple orchards in Haryana.

Effective management of fungal diseases in apple requires an integrated approach combining cultural practices and timely application of CIBRC-approved fungicides.

**General Cultural Practices for Fungal Disease Management:**

*   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy fallen leaves, mummified fruits, and pruned diseased branches to reduce inoculum sources.
*   **Pruning:** Ensure proper pruning to improve air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce humidity and fungal growth. Remove dead or diseased wood.
*   **Orchard Hygiene:** Keep the orchard floor clean of weeds and debris.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced fertilizers to maintain tree vigor, as stressed trees are more susceptible to diseases. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can promote lush, susceptible growth.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Maintain adequate tree spacing to ensure good air movement and sunlight penetration.

**Specific Fungal Diseases and Their Control in Apple:**

1.  **Alternaria Blotch/Leaf Spot (Caused by *Alternaria alternata*)**
    This disease causes dark brown to black spots on leaves, often with concentric rings, leading to premature defoliation.

    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   Apply protective fungicides starting from petal fall and continuing through the growing season, especially during warm, humid conditions.
        *   **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Difenoconazole** at 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Tebuconazole** at 0.75 ml/L of water.
        *   **Fluxapyroxad + Pyraclostrobin** at 0.5-0.75 ml/L of water.

2.  **Anthracnose Fruit Rot and Canker (Caused by *Colletotrichum gloeosporioides* and other *Colletotrichum* species)**
    Anthracnose causes sunken, dark brown to black lesions on fruits, often with pinkish spore masses in humid conditions. It can also cause cankers on branches.

    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   Apply fungicides during the growing season, particularly from fruit set until harvest.
        *   For cankers, prune out diseased wood and apply a protective fungicide.
        *   **Captan** at 2.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Carbendazim** at 1 g/L of water (ensure rotation with other modes of action to prevent resistance).
        *   **Thiophanate Methyl** at 1 g/L of water.
        *   For dormant season canker management, a spray of **Copper Oxychloride** at 3 g/L of water can be beneficial.

3.  **Blast**
    This is not known to affect Apple.

4.  **Fungal Blights (e.g., Blossom Blight, Twig Blight)**
    Various fungi (e.g., *Monilinia* species, *Botrytis cinerea*) can cause blighting of blossoms, twigs, and young shoots, leading to wilting and dieback.

    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   Apply fungicides during the bloom period and early shoot growth, especially if wet conditions prevail.
        *   **Captan** at 2.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Carbendazim** at 1 g/L of water.
        *   **Thiophanate Methyl** at 1 g/L of water.

5.  **Brown Spot (Marssonina Blotch, Caused by *Diplocarpon mali*)**
    This disease causes small, circular, dark brown spots on leaves, which enlarge and may merge, leading to severe defoliation.

    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   Begin fungicide applications from late spring to early summer, especially during periods of high humidity and rainfall.
        *   **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Captan** at 2.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Difenoconazole** at 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Hexaconazole** at 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Fluxapyroxad + Pyraclostrobin** at 0.5-0.75 ml/L of water.

6.  **Downy Mildew**
    This is not known to affect Apple.

7.  **Powdery Mildew (Caused by *Podosphaera leucotricha*)**
    This is a significant disease causing white, powdery patches on leaves, shoots, and sometimes flowers and fruits. Infected leaves may curl and shoots become stunted.

    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   Start applications at green tip or tight cluster stage and continue through the primary infection period (pre-bloom to early fruit development).
        *   **Wettable Sulphur** at 2-3 g/L of water (effective in early stages and for organic production, but avoid application in very hot weather).
        *   **Myclobutanil** at 0.4-0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Hexaconazole** at 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Difenoconazole** at 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Tebuconazole** at 0.75 ml/L of water.
        *   **Kresoxim-methyl** at 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5 ml/L of water.

8.  **Grey Mildew**
    This is not known to affect Apple.

**Important Considerations for Chemical Application:**

*   **Timing is Crucial:** The efficacy of fungicides heavily depends on timely application, often linked to specific growth stages of the apple tree and prevailing weather conditions.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of fungicide resistance in pathogens. Avoid repeated use of fungicides from the same chemical group.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough coverage of all plant parts (leaves, shoots, fruits) for optimal protection.
*   **Adjuvants:** Consider using a suitable spreader-sticker (adjuvant) to improve spray coverage and retention, especially during rainy periods.
*   **Safety:** Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the product label, including dosage, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and safety precautions. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and application.
*   **Local Advice:** Always consult with your local agricultural extension services or HAU experts for the most current and specific recommendations tailored to your orchard's conditions and the prevailing disease pressure in Haryana.
