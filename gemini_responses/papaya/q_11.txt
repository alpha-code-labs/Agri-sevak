As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an integrated pest management (IPM) approach for controlling pests in Papaya, focusing on prevention and targeted interventions.

### Control of Beetles and Weevils in Papaya

Beetles and Weevils can cause damage to papaya leaves, stems, and fruits. Effective management involves a combination of cultural, mechanical, and chemical methods.

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy fallen fruits, plant debris, and weeds around the papaya plants, as these can harbor pests.
*   **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect plants for signs of beetle or weevil activity, especially on young leaves, flowers, and developing fruits.
*   **Hand-picking:** For larger beetles or weevils, hand-picking and destroying them can be effective in small orchards.
*   **Fruit Bagging:** Bagging individual fruits with paper or cloth bags can protect them from fruit-boring weevils and beetles.
*   **Proper Nutrition and Irrigation:** Maintain healthy plants through balanced fertilization and adequate irrigation, as healthy plants are more resilient to pest attacks.

**2. Chemical Control (if necessary):**
If pest incidence is high and causing significant damage, chemical intervention may be required. Always follow label instructions for dosage, application, and pre-harvest interval (PHI). Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

For the control of beetles and weevils, the following CIBRC-approved insecticides can be considered:

*   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** Apply at a rate of 0.5 ml per liter of water. This is a broad-spectrum synthetic pyrethroid effective against various chewing and sucking pests.
*   **Malathion 50% EC:** Apply at a rate of 2 ml per liter of water. This is an organophosphate insecticide with contact and stomach action.
*   **Spinosad 45% SC:** Apply at a rate of 0.25 - 0.3 ml per liter of water. This is a naturally derived insecticide with a unique mode of action, effective against a range of chewing insects and suitable for IPM programs.

### Control of Sawflies in Papaya

This is not known to affect Papaya. Sawflies are primarily pests of broadleaf trees and conifers, and are not typically associated with Papaya (*Carica papaya*) cultivation.
