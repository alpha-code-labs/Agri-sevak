As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Dieback, Twig blight, and Tikka disease in Papaya in Haryana.

### Tikka Disease

This is not known to affect Papaya. Tikka disease is primarily a disease of groundnut (peanut).

### Dieback and Twig Blight in Papaya

Dieback and Twig blight in papaya are often symptoms of fungal infections, such as those caused by *Colletotrichum gloeosporioides* (Anthracnose) or *Botryodiplodia theobromae*, especially under humid conditions or following stress. These pathogens can cause lesions on twigs and stems, leading to their death from the tip downwards (dieback) or localized blighting.

**Management Strategies:**

**1. Cultural Management:**
*   **Pruning:** Regularly inspect plants and prune out all affected twigs and branches showing symptoms of dieback or blight. Ensure cuts are made into healthy wood.
*   **Sanitation:** Collect and destroy (burn or bury deep) all pruned diseased plant parts to reduce inoculum sources.
*   **Orchard Hygiene:** Maintain good orchard sanitation by removing plant debris and weeds.
*   **Proper Nutrition:** Ensure balanced fertilization to maintain plant vigor, as stressed plants are more susceptible.
*   **Water Management:** Avoid waterlogging, which can predispose plants to root and collar rot that can lead to dieback. If using overhead irrigation, do so in the morning to allow foliage to dry quickly.
*   **Air Circulation:** Ensure adequate spacing between plants to improve air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce humidity and fungal growth.

**2. Chemical Management:**
For effective control, apply fungicides preventively during periods conducive to disease development (e.g., high humidity, monsoon season) or at the first sign of symptoms. Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

*   **Systemic Fungicides:**
    *   Spray with **Carbendazim 50% WP** at a concentration of 0.5-1 gram per litre of water.
    *   Alternatively, spray with **Propiconazole 25% EC** at a concentration of 0.5-1 ml per litre of water.

*   **Contact/Protective Fungicides:**
    *   Spray with **Mancozeb 75% WP** at a concentration of 2-2.5 grams per litre of water.
    *   Alternatively, spray with **Copper Oxychloride 50% WP** at a concentration of 2.5-3 grams per litre of water.

**Application Schedule:**
*   Initiate sprays at the onset of symptoms or during periods of high humidity.
*   Repeat applications at 10-15 day intervals, depending on disease severity and weather conditions.
*   Ensure thorough coverage of the plant canopy, especially the affected twigs and stems.

Always read and follow the instructions on the fungicide label for safe and effective use, including pre-harvest intervals.
