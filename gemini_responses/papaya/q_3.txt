As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling various rot types in Papaya, which are significant challenges in our region.

It's important to understand that many "rot" types are often caused by similar pathogens, primarily fungi and oomycetes, and their manifestation depends on the plant part affected and environmental conditions. Effective control relies on an integrated approach combining cultural practices and judicious use of CIBRC-approved fungicides.

Here's a breakdown of the rot types affecting Papaya and their control measures:

### 1. Root, Stem, Collar, Foot, Crown, and Neck Rot Complex

These rots are often caused by soil-borne pathogens like *Phytophthora palmivora*, *Pythium aphanidermatum*, and *Rhizoctonia solani*. They manifest as water-soaked lesions, blackening, and softening of tissues at or below the soil line (foot, collar, crown, root) or higher up on the stem (stem, neck). Severe infections lead to wilting, defoliation, and plant death.

**Cultural and Preventive Measures:**
*   **Site Selection:** Choose well-drained fields. Avoid low-lying areas prone to waterlogging.
*   **Soil Preparation:** Improve soil drainage by incorporating organic matter or creating raised beds.
*   **Planting Depth:** Plant seedlings at the same depth as they were in the nursery. Avoid deep planting.
*   **Irrigation Management:** Practice judicious irrigation. Avoid overwatering, especially around the plant base. Use drip irrigation to minimize water contact with the stem.
*   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant parts or entire plants to reduce inoculum.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate papaya with non-host crops to break the disease cycle.
*   **Wound Avoidance:** Minimize mechanical injuries to the stem and roots during cultivation.

**Chemical Control (for established plants):**
*   **Soil Drenching:** Apply fungicides as a drench around the base of the affected plants.
    *   For *Phytophthora* and *Pythium* (Oomycetes):
        *   **Metalaxyl-M 4% + Mancozeb 64% WP** at 2.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Fosetyl-aluminium 80% WP** at 2.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride 72.2% SL** at 2.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Copper oxychloride 50% WP** at 3 g/L of water (can be used as a preventive drench).
    *   For *Rhizoctonia* (Fungus):
        *   **Carbendazim 50% WP** at 1.5-2 g/L of water.
        *   **Thiophanate-methyl 70% WP** at 1.5-2 g/L of water.
*   **Repeat Application:** Repeat drenching at 15-20 day intervals, especially during periods of high humidity and rainfall, or if symptoms persist.

### 2. Seed Rot and Seedling Rot (Damping-off)

These rots are common in nurseries and are primarily caused by *Pythium aphanidermatum*, *Phytophthora palmivora*, and *Rhizoctonia solani*.
*   **Seed Rot:** Seeds fail to germinate or rot before emergence.
*   **Seedling Rot (Damping-off):** Seedlings either rot before emerging (pre-emergence damping-off) or collapse at the soil line after emergence (post-emergence damping-off).

**Cultural and Preventive Measures:**
*   **Sterilized Media:** Use sterilized potting mix or soil for seedbeds and nursery bags.
*   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds before sowing.
*   **Sowing Depth:** Sow seeds at the recommended depth.
*   **Watering:** Water judiciously to keep the soil moist but not waterlogged.
*   **Ventilation:** Ensure good air circulation in the nursery.
*   **Sanitation:** Maintain strict hygiene in the nursery.

**Chemical Control:**
*   **Seed Treatment:**
    *   **Captan 50% WP** at 2.5-3 g/kg of seed.
    *   **Thiram 75% WS** at 2.5-3 g/kg of seed.
    *   **Carbendazim 50% WP** at 2 g/kg of seed.
*   **Nursery Drenching (if damping-off occurs):**
    *   **Metalaxyl-M 4% + Mancozeb 64% WP** at 2 g/L of water.
    *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride 72.2% SL** at 2 ml/L of water.
    *   **Carbendazim 50% WP** at 1.5 g/L of water.

### 3. Fruit Rot

Fruit rots are caused by various pathogens, including *Phytophthora palmivora*, *Colletotrichum gloeosporioides* (Anthracnose), and *Botryodiplodia theobromae*. Symptoms include water-soaked spots, sunken lesions, blackening, and softening of fruit tissue, leading to premature fruit drop or post-harvest losses.

**Cultural and Preventive Measures:**
*   **Orchard Sanitation:** Remove and destroy fallen, diseased fruits.
*   **Pruning:** Prune lower branches to improve air circulation and reduce humidity around fruits.
*   **Wound Avoidance:** Avoid mechanical injuries to fruits during harvesting and handling.
*   **Harvesting:** Harvest fruits at the correct maturity stage.
*   **Post-harvest Handling:** Handle fruits carefully to prevent bruising.

**Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
*   **For *Phytophthora* Fruit Rot:**
    *   **Metalaxyl-M 4% + Mancozeb 64% WP** at 2 g/L of water.
    *   **Fosetyl-aluminium 80% WP** at 2 g/L of water.
*   **For Anthracnose (*Colletotrichum*) and other Fungal Fruit Rots:**
    *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC** at 0.5-1 ml/L of water.
    *   **Pyraclostrobin 13.3% + Metiram 55% WG** at 1.5-2 g/L of water.
    *   **Mancozeb 75% WP** at 2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Carbendazim 50% WP** at 1 g/L of water.
*   **Spray Schedule:** Initiate sprays at fruit set and repeat at 10-15 day intervals, especially during humid weather. Ensure thorough coverage of fruits.

### 4. Black Rot

The term "Black Rot" is often used to describe severe rot symptoms where the affected tissue turns dark brown to black. In Papaya, this can be a symptom of advanced *Phytophthora* infection on roots, stems, or fruits, or severe anthracnose on fruits. The control measures for Black Rot are therefore covered under the respective categories of Root, Stem, Collar, Foot, Crown, Neck Rot Complex and Fruit Rot.

**General Recommendations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the fungicide label for dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in pathogens.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension specialists for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions.

By implementing these integrated management strategies, you can effectively control various rot types in your Papaya cultivation.
