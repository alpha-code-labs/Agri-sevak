As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), here is the scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Papaya in Haryana:

**1. Grasshopper:**
Grasshoppers can cause defoliation, especially on young papaya plants.
*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Regular weeding around the papaya plants to remove alternative host plants and breeding sites.
    *   Hand-picking of grasshoppers in the early stages of infestation, especially for young plants.
*   **Chemical Control (if infestation is severe):**
    *   Spray with **Malathion** 50% EC at 1.0 - 1.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   Alternatively, spray with **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.

**2. Painted bug:**
This is not known to affect Papaya. Painted bug (Bagrada hilaris) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops like mustard, cabbage, and cauliflower.

**3. Red cotton bug:**
This is not known to affect Papaya. Red cotton bug (Dysdercus cingulatus) is primarily a pest of cotton and other malvaceous plants.

**4. Black ants:**
Black ants are often secondary pests in papaya, primarily attracted to the honeydew secreted by sap-sucking insects like aphids, mealybugs, and scale insects, which they protect. Direct damage to papaya by black ants is rare.
*   **Integrated Pest Management:**
    *   **Identify and control primary sap-sucking pests:** If ants are present due to honeydew, the most effective control is to manage the aphids, mealybugs, or scale insects that are producing the honeydew.
    *   **Physical barriers:** Apply a sticky band around the trunk of the papaya tree to prevent ants from climbing up.
*   **Chemical Control (if direct ant control is necessary):**
    *   For ant trails and nests around the base of the plant, apply a dust formulation of **Malathion** 5% DP at 20-25 kg per acre, or directly on ant trails.
    *   Alternatively, spray the base of the plant and surrounding soil with **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 2.5 ml per litre of water to create a barrier.
    *   Ant baits containing **Fipronil** 0.0143% Gel or **Hydramethylnon** 2% Gel can also be placed near ant trails, away from direct contact with the plant, to target the colony.
