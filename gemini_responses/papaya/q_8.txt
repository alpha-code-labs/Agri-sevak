As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach for effective and sustainable control of sucking pests (Aphids, Leafhopper, Whitefly, Thrips, and Psylla) in Papaya. These pests are common in Papaya cultivation in Haryana and can cause significant yield losses by direct feeding and by transmitting viral diseases.

Here's a comprehensive strategy:

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Regularly remove weeds from and around the papaya orchard, as they can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Maintain recommended plant spacing to ensure good air circulation, which discourages pest build-up.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, as it can lead to lush, soft growth that is more attractive to sucking pests.
*   **Yellow Sticky Traps:** Install yellow sticky traps (10-15 traps per acre) to monitor and mass-trap adult whiteflies, aphids, and leafhoppers. Replace them regularly.
*   **Reflective Mulches:** Use silver-coloured reflective mulches (e.g., silver-on-black plastic mulch) around young plants to repel winged aphids and whiteflies, thereby reducing virus transmission.
*   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy severely infested leaves or plant parts to reduce pest populations.

**2. Biological Control:**
*   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Protect and encourage natural predators like ladybird beetles, lacewings, hoverfly larvae, and parasitoids (e.g., *Encarsia formosa* for whiteflies, *Aphidius colemani* for aphids). Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.
*   **Biopesticides:** Consider using neem-based formulations (e.g., Azadirachtin 1500 ppm or 3000 ppm) at 3-5 ml per litre of water, especially during early infestation stages. These act as antifeedants and growth regulators.

**3. Chemical Control:**
When pest populations reach economic threshold levels, judicious application of CIBRC approved insecticides is necessary. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance. Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where many sucking pests reside.

For Aphids, Leafhoppers (Jassids), Whiteflies, Thrips, and Psylla, the following technical chemicals are recommended:

*   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL**: Apply at 0.3-0.5 ml per litre of water. Effective against a broad spectrum of sucking pests including aphids, jassids, whiteflies, thrips, and psylla.
*   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG**: Apply at 0.2-0.3 g per litre of water. A systemic insecticide effective against various sucking pests like aphids, jassids, whiteflies, and thrips.
*   **Acetamiprid 20% SP**: Apply at 0.2-0.4 g per litre of water. Another systemic neonicotinoid effective against aphids, whiteflies, and thrips.
*   **Flonicamid 50% WG**: Apply at 0.3 g per litre of water. A selective insecticide particularly effective against aphids and whiteflies.
*   **Buprofezin 25% SC**: Apply at 1.25-1.5 ml per litre of water. An insect growth regulator primarily effective against whitefly nymphs and hoppers.
*   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC**: Apply at 0.5-0.7 ml per litre of water. Effective against whiteflies (nymphs and eggs) and mites.
*   **Diafenthiuron 50% WP**: Apply at 0.6-1.0 g per litre of water. A pro-insecticide effective against whiteflies, thrips, and mites.
*   **Fipronil 5% SC**: Apply at 1.5-2.0 ml per litre of water. Effective against thrips and leafhoppers.
*   **Dimethoate 30% EC**: Apply at 1.0-1.5 ml per litre of water. An organophosphate insecticide effective against aphids, jassids, whiteflies, and thrips. (Observe pre-harvest interval strictly).
*   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC**: Apply at 0.5-0.75 ml per litre of water. A synthetic pyrethroid effective against thrips, leafhoppers, and whiteflies.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Timing of Application:** Apply insecticides early in the morning or late in the evening to minimize drift and maximize efficacy, especially when natural enemies are less active.
*   **Resistance Management:** Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action (different IRAC groups) to prevent the development of resistance in pest populations.
*   **Safety:** Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label, including dosage, safety precautions, and pre-harvest intervals (PHI). Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).
*   **Monitoring:** Regularly monitor your papaya plants for pest incidence to determine the right time for intervention.

By integrating these strategies, you can effectively manage sucking pests in your papaya orchard and ensure healthy plant growth and good yields.
