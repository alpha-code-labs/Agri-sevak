As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following fertilizer schedule for Papaya cultivation in Haryana. Please note that these are general recommendations, and a precise fertilizer plan should always be based on a comprehensive soil test report from a reputable laboratory.

**General Nutrient Requirement per Papaya Plant per Year (for high yield):**
*   **Nitrogen (N):** 200-250 g
*   **Phosphorus (P2O5):** 200-250 g
*   **Potassium (K2O):** 250-300 g
*   **Sulphur (S):** 20-30 g

To achieve these nutrient targets, the following fertilizer doses are recommended per plant per year:

*   **Urea (46% N):**
    *   **Dose:** 350-450 g per plant per year.
    *   **Application:** This quantity should be split into 4-6 equal doses and applied every 2-3 months, starting 1-2 months after planting.

*   **Nano-Urea (4% N liquid):**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml per litre of water for foliar spray.
    *   **Application:** Can be used as a supplementary source of Nitrogen, especially during peak vegetative growth and fruit development. Apply 2-3 sprays at 15-20 day intervals. It can potentially reduce the conventional **Urea** requirement by up to 50%.

*   **DAP (Di-ammonium Phosphate, 18% N, 46% P2O5):**
    *   **Dose:** 450-550 g per plant per year.
    *   **Application:** This quantity should be split into 4-6 equal doses and applied every 2-3 months. **DAP** provides both Phosphorus and a portion of the Nitrogen requirement.

*   **Nano-DAP (8% N, 16% P2O5 liquid):**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml per litre of water for foliar spray.
    *   **Application:** Can be used as a supplementary source of Phosphorus and Nitrogen, particularly during flowering and fruit set. Apply 2-3 sprays at 15-20 day intervals. It can potentially reduce the conventional **DAP** requirement by up to 25-50%.

*   **NPK (Complex Fertilizers):**
    *   **Dose:** If using a balanced NPK complex fertilizer (e.g., 19-19-19 or 12-32-16), the dose will depend on the specific grade and the NPK requirement. As a general guideline for soil application, one might use 1.0-1.5 kg of a balanced NPK (e.g., 19-19-19) per plant per year, split into multiple doses. However, it is often more precise to use individual fertilizers as outlined above to meet specific nutrient needs.
    *   **Application:** Split into 4-6 doses, applied every 2-3 months. Water-soluble NPK grades can also be used for fertigation.

*   **SSP (Single Super Phosphate, 16% P2O5, 11% S):**
    *   **Dose:** If **DAP** is not used as the primary Phosphorus source, or if additional Sulphur is required, **SSP** can be used. To provide 250 g P2O5, approximately 1.5 kg of **SSP** would be needed per plant per year.
    *   **Application:** Typically applied as a basal dose or split into 2-3 applications early in the season.

*   **Potash (Muriate of Potash - MOP, 60% K2O):**
    *   **Dose:** 400-500 g per plant per year.
    *   **Application:** This quantity should be split into 4-6 equal doses and applied every 2-3 months.

*   **Sulphur (90% Elemental Sulphur):**
    *   **Dose:** 20-30 g per plant per year.
    *   **Application:** Can be applied as a single dose annually or split into two doses, typically during the monsoon and post-monsoon periods. If **SSP** is used, it will contribute significantly to Sulphur requirements.

**General Application Method:**
For soil application, broadcast the fertilizers in a ring 30-45 cm away from the plant stem, lightly incorporate them into the soil, and follow immediately with irrigation.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Soil Testing:** The most accurate fertilizer recommendations are derived from a comprehensive soil test report. This helps in understanding the existing nutrient status of your soil and tailoring the fertilizer application precisely.
*   **Plant Age and Yield:** Adjust fertilizer doses based on the age of the plant and its yielding capacity. Younger plants require less, while mature, high-yielding plants require more.
*   **Irrigation:** Adequate and timely irrigation is crucial for efficient nutrient uptake and utilization by the papaya plants.
*   **Micronutrients:** Papaya also requires essential micronutrients like Zinc, Boron, Manganese, and Iron. These can be applied as foliar sprays (e.g., commercial micronutrient mixtures) or through soil application based on soil test results. A common recommendation is to apply **Zinc Sulphate** (20-25 kg/acre) and **Borax** (10-15 kg/acre) once every 2-3 years or as needed.
