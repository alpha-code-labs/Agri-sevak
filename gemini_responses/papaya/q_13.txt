Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice regarding pest control in Papaya.

Let's address your concerns:

1.  **Ber fly (*Carpomyia vesuviana*)**:
    This is not known to affect Papaya. The Ber fly is a specific pest of Ber (*Ziziphus mauritiana*) and related wild *Ziziphus* species.

2.  **Fruit fly (*Bactrocera* species) in Papaya**:
    Fruit flies, primarily the Oriental fruit fly (*Bactrocera dorsalis*) and Melon fruit fly (*Bactrocera cucurbitae*), are serious pests of Papaya in Haryana. They cause significant damage by laying eggs in the developing fruits, leading to maggot infestation, fruit rot, and premature fruit drop.

    An Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is recommended for effective control:

    **A. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Regularly collect and destroy all fallen, damaged, or infested fruits by burying them deep in the soil or burning them. This prevents the completion of the fruit fly life cycle.
    *   **Deep Ploughing:** After harvest, deep ploughing of the orchard soil can expose pupae to predators and adverse environmental conditions, reducing the pest population.
    *   **Bagging of Fruits:** For small-scale cultivation, individual fruits can be covered with paper or cloth bags once they reach a certain size to prevent egg-laying by fruit flies.

    **B. Monitoring and Mass Trapping:**
    *   **Pheromone Traps:** Install pheromone traps (e.g., Methyl Eugenol traps for *B. dorsalis* and Cue Lure traps for *B. cucurbitae*) at a density of 10-15 traps per acre. These traps help in monitoring the pest population and can also be used for mass trapping to reduce male populations. Replace lures every 2-3 weeks.

    **C. Chemical Control (as a last resort or in conjunction with other methods):**
    When pest incidence is high, chemical interventions can be employed. Bait sprays are generally more effective and environmentally friendly than broad-spectrum foliar sprays for fruit flies.

    *   **Bait Sprays:**
        *   Prepare a bait solution by mixing 100 g of jaggery or molasses with 1 litre of water and adding one of the following insecticides:
            *   **Malathion** (50% EC) @ 2 ml/L of water.
            *   **Spinosad** (45% SC) @ 0.25 ml/L of water.
        *   Apply this bait solution as spot sprays on the underside of leaves or on non-bearing branches, preferably in the morning. Do not spray directly on fruits unless specified. Repeat at weekly intervals during peak infestation.

    *   **Foliar Sprays (if infestation is severe and bait sprays are insufficient):**
        *   **Malathion** (50% EC) @ 2 ml/L of water.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** (5% EC) @ 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Deltamethrin** (2.8% EC) @ 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Chlorantraniliprole** (18.5% SC) @ 0.3 ml/L of water.

    **Important Considerations:**
    *   Always read and follow the instructions on the insecticide label, including dosage, application method, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
    *   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
    *   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
