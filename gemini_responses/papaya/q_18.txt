As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified recommendations for the use of growth regulators and Boron in Papaya cultivation in Haryana:

### Recommended Doses of Growth Regulators/Hormones and Boron in Papaya

**1. Ethephon (Ethrel)**

*   **Purpose:** Primarily used for uniform fruit ripening and enhancing latex flow.
*   **Recommended Dose for Fruit Ripening:**
    *   For post-harvest ripening of mature green fruits: Dip fruits in a solution of **Ethephon** at 500-1000 ppm (parts per million). This translates to approximately **1-2 ml/L** of a 48% **Ethephon** formulation.
    *   For pre-harvest ripening (to promote uniform ripening on the tree): Spray the fruits with **Ethephon** at 250-500 ppm (approximately **0.5-1 ml/L** of a 48% **Ethephon** formulation) when fruits start showing signs of maturity.

**2. 2,4-D**

*   **This is not known to affect Papaya beneficially as a growth regulator in standard agricultural practices.**
*   **Important Note:** **2,4-D** is primarily a broadleaf herbicide. While extremely low concentrations might be used for specific purposes like preventing fruit drop in some crops, its use as a growth regulator for papaya is not recommended due to the very narrow margin of safety and high risk of phytotoxicity (plant damage) even at slightly higher doses. Its application can severely damage or kill papaya plants. Therefore, its use as a growth regulator for papaya is strongly discouraged.

**3. Boron**

*   **Purpose:** Boron is an essential micronutrient crucial for flowering, pollen viability, fruit set, and overall fruit development in Papaya. Deficiency can lead to poor fruit set, deformed fruits, and latex exudation from young fruits.
*   **Recommended Dose for Foliar Application:**
    *   Spray a solution of **Borax** (Disodium tetraborate decahydrate, containing approximately 11% Boron) at **1-2 g/L** of water.
    *   Alternatively, use **Boric acid** (containing approximately 17% Boron) at **0.6-1.2 g/L** of water.
    *   **Timing:** Apply at the pre-flowering stage and repeat during the fruit setting period, usually 2-3 sprays at 15-20 day intervals, depending on deficiency symptoms and soil test results.
*   **Recommended Dose for Soil Application (if severe deficiency is confirmed by soil test):**
    *   Apply **Borax** at **10-15 kg/acre** or **Boric acid** at **6-9 kg/acre** once a year, preferably before the monsoon or during planting, mixed with other fertilizers. Soil application should always be based on a soil test report.

Always ensure proper coverage during spraying and follow all safety precautions mentioned on the product label. For specific field conditions, it is advisable to conduct a soil and leaf analysis to determine precise nutrient requirements.
