Wilt, including Parawilt, is a serious concern for papaya cultivation in Haryana. It can lead to significant yield losses and even plant mortality. Effective management requires an integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical strategies.

Here's how to control Wilt (including Parawilt) in Papaya:

**1. Cultural Practices (Preventive and Management):**

*   **Site Selection and Soil Preparation:**
    *   Choose well-drained fields. Papaya is highly susceptible to waterlogging, which predisposes it to root rot and wilt.
    *   Prepare raised beds (30-45 cm high) to ensure excellent drainage, especially in areas prone to heavy rainfall or with heavy soils.
    *   Deep ploughing and solarization (covering soil with transparent polythene for 4-6 weeks during hot months) can reduce soil-borne pathogen inoculum.
*   **Water Management:**
    *   Avoid over-irrigation. Irrigate judiciously, especially during the monsoon season.
    *   Use drip irrigation to deliver water directly to the root zone, minimizing soil wetness and reducing the spread of pathogens.
    *   Ensure proper drainage channels are maintained around the field.
*   **Planting Material:**
    *   Use healthy, disease-free seedlings from a reputable source.
    *   Avoid planting seedlings that show any signs of stress or disease.
*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Provide balanced nutrition to enhance plant vigor and resistance. Potassium (K) can improve plant tolerance to stress.
    *   Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can lead to lush growth that is more susceptible to diseases.
*   **Sanitation:**
    *   Immediately remove and destroy (burn or bury deep) any wilted or diseased plants to prevent the spread of pathogens.
    *   Clean and disinfect farm tools and equipment regularly, especially after working with infected plants.
*   **Crop Rotation:**
    *   Avoid continuous cultivation of papaya in the same field. Rotate with non-host crops for at least 2-3 years to break the disease cycle.
*   **Mulching:**
    *   Apply organic mulch around the base of plants to conserve soil moisture, regulate soil temperature, and suppress weeds, which can reduce stress on plants.

**2. Biological Control:**

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply beneficial microbial antagonists to the soil, which can suppress soil-borne pathogens.
    *   **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum**: Apply 2.5 kg/acre mixed with 50 kg of farmyard manure (FYM) or compost, or as a drench at 5-10 g/L water around the base of plants.
    *   **Pseudomonas fluorescens**: Apply 2.5 kg/acre mixed with 50 kg of FYM or compost, or as a drench at 5-10 g/L water around the base of plants.
*   **Seedling Treatment:**
    *   Dip seedling roots in a solution of **Trichoderma viride** or **Pseudomonas fluorescens** (10 g/L water) for 30 minutes before transplanting.

**3. Chemical Control (Curative and Preventive):**

For chemical control, it is crucial to identify the specific pathogen causing the wilt, as different chemicals target different types of pathogens. Parawilt is often associated with *Phytophthora* root rot, while other wilts can be caused by *Fusarium* or bacterial pathogens.

*   **For *Phytophthora* related Wilt/Parawilt (often characterized by rapid wilting and root rot):**
    *   **Propamocarb Hydrochloride**: Drench the soil around the base of affected plants with a solution of 2-3 ml/L water. Repeat after 10-15 days if necessary.
    *   **Metalaxyl-M + Mancozeb**: Drench the soil around the base of affected plants with a solution of 2-2.5 g/L water. Repeat after 10-15 days if necessary.
    *   **Fosetyl-aluminium**: Drench the soil around the base of affected plants with a solution of 2-3 g/L water. Repeat after 10-15 days if necessary.
*   **For Fungal Wilts (e.g., *Fusarium* wilt):**
    *   **Carbendazim**: Drench the soil around the base of affected plants with a solution of 1-2 g/L water. Repeat after 10-15 days if necessary.
    *   **Thiophanate Methyl**: Drench the soil around the base of affected plants with a solution of 1-2 g/L water. Repeat after 10-15 days if necessary.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Early Detection:** Wilt, especially Parawilt, can progress very rapidly. Early detection and immediate action are critical for any chance of recovery.
*   **Integrated Approach:** Relying solely on one method (e.g., chemicals) is often ineffective. A combination of cultural, biological, and chemical strategies provides the most robust control.
*   **Diagnosis:** If the cause of wilt is unclear, it is advisable to get a proper diagnosis from a plant pathology lab (e.g., at HAU, Hisar) to ensure the correct control measures are applied.

By implementing these scientifically verified practices, farmers can significantly reduce the incidence and severity of Wilt and Parawilt in their papaya orchards.
