Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist from Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the critical importance of balanced nutrition for healthy Papaya cultivation. Micronutrient deficiencies can significantly impact yield and fruit quality.

Before any application, it is highly recommended to conduct a **soil test** to accurately determine the specific deficiencies in your field. Visual symptoms can be indicative, but a soil test provides precise data for targeted nutrient management.

Here's how to address common micronutrient deficiencies in Papaya:

### General Recommendations for Micronutrient Application:

*   **Soil Application:** Apply micronutrients as basal dose or side dressing, mixed with well-decomposed farmyard manure or compost, to ensure even distribution and reduce fixation.
*   **Foliar Application:** For quick correction of deficiencies, foliar sprays are effective. Ensure complete coverage of the leaf surface. Apply during cooler parts of the day (morning or late afternoon) to avoid scorching. Repeat applications may be necessary based on the severity of the deficiency and plant response.

### Specific Micronutrient Deficiencies and Their Management:

#### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency:
*   **Symptoms:** Small, narrow leaves (little leaf), interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, stunted growth, and reduced fruit set.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** at 10-20 kg/acre, once a year, preferably before planting or during active growth.
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.5% solution of **Zinc sulphate monohydrate** (5 g/L of water). Repeat every 15-20 days if symptoms persist.

#### 2. Iron (Fe) / Ferrous Deficiency:
*   **Symptoms:** Pronounced interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, turning almost white in severe cases, while veins remain green. Growth is stunted.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Ferrous sulphate** at 10-20 kg/acre, especially in alkaline soils.
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.5% solution of **Ferrous sulphate** (5 g/L of water) or 0.1-0.2% solution of **Ferrous EDTA** (1-2 g/L of water) for better absorption. Repeat every 10-15 days until symptoms disappear.

#### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency:
*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, brittle and distorted young leaves, cracking of petioles and stems, latex exudation from fruits, malformed or bumpy fruits, and poor fruit set.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Borax (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate)** at 4-8 kg/acre, once a year.
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.1-0.2% solution of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (1-2 g/L of water). Apply before flowering and during fruit development.

#### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency:
*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, distorted and curled new leaves, tip burn on young leaves, poor root development, and reduced fruit quality.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Calcium nitrate** at 20-40 kg/acre, as part of your regular fertilization program.
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.5-1.0% solution of **Calcium nitrate** or **Calcium chloride** (5-10 g/L of water). Apply during active growth and fruit development.

#### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency:
*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, starting from the leaf margins and progressing inwards, often giving a "Christmas tree" pattern. Leaves may become brittle and prematurely drop.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Magnesium sulphate** at 10-20 kg/acre.
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.5-1.0% solution of **Magnesium sulphate** (5-10 g/L of water). Repeat every 15-20 days if symptoms persist.

#### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency:
*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, similar to iron deficiency but often less severe, sometimes accompanied by small necrotic spots. Growth may be stunted.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Manganese sulphate** at 5-10 kg/acre.
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.2-0.5% solution of **Manganese sulphate** (2-5 g/L of water).

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Water Quality:** Always use clean water for foliar sprays.
*   **Compatibility:** Avoid mixing different micronutrient solutions or pesticides without checking their compatibility.
*   **Soil pH:** Soil pH significantly influences micronutrient availability. Maintaining an optimal soil pH (6.0-7.0 for Papaya) is crucial.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management:** Combine micronutrient applications with balanced NPK fertilization and organic matter incorporation for sustainable soil health and plant nutrition.
