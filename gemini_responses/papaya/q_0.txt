As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Papaya in Haryana:

**General Management Practices for Fungal Diseases:**

*   **Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy infected plant parts (leaves, fruits, stems) to reduce inoculum sources.
*   **Plant Spacing:** Ensure adequate spacing between plants to promote good air circulation, which helps reduce humidity and fungal growth.
*   **Irrigation:** Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day. Drip irrigation is preferred to keep foliage dry. If overhead irrigation is unavoidable, do it in the morning to allow leaves to dry quickly.
*   **Nutrition:** Maintain balanced fertilization. Excessive nitrogen can lead to lush growth, making plants more susceptible to certain diseases.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available and suitable for local conditions, choose papaya varieties known for resistance or tolerance to common fungal diseases.

**Specific Control Measures for Fungal Diseases in Papaya:**

### 1. Alternaria Leaf Spot (Caused by *Alternaria alternata*)

**Symptoms:** Small, circular, dark brown spots with concentric rings, often surrounded by a yellow halo, primarily on older leaves. Severe infection can lead to defoliation.

**Control Measures:**
*   **Cultural:** Remove and destroy severely infected leaves.
*   **Chemical:**
    *   Spray with **Mancozeb** at 2.0-2.5 g/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, use **Chlorothalonil** at 2.0 g/L of water.
    *   For systemic action, **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water can be effective.

### 2. Anthracnose (Caused by *Colletotrichum gloeosporioides*)

**Symptoms:** Affects fruits, leaves, and stems. On fruits, it appears as small, water-soaked spots that enlarge, become sunken, and turn dark brown to black, often with pinkish spore masses in humid conditions. On leaves, it causes irregular brown spots.

**Control Measures:**
*   **Cultural:** Harvest fruits carefully to avoid injury. Remove and destroy infected fruits and plant debris.
*   **Chemical:**
    *   Spray with **Mancozeb** at 2.0-2.5 g/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, use **Carbendazim** at 0.5-1.0 g/L of water.
    *   **Propiconazole** at 0.5 ml/L of water can also be used.
    *   **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water provides good control and also helps with other fungal diseases.

### 3. Blast

This is not known to affect Papaya.

### 4. Blight (e.g., Phytophthora Fruit Rot/Stem Rot caused by *Phytophthora palmivora*)

**Symptoms:** While "Blight" is a general term, *Phytophthora palmivora* can cause severe fruit rot, stem rot, and damping-off in papaya, which can manifest as blight-like symptoms on young plants or fruits. Water-soaked lesions appear on fruits, rapidly expanding and leading to soft rot.

**Control Measures:**
*   **Cultural:** Improve drainage in the field. Avoid waterlogging. Remove and destroy infected fruits and plants.
*   **Chemical:**
    *   Drenching or spraying with a combination product of **Metalaxyl + Mancozeb** at 2.0-2.5 g/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, use **Propamocarb hydrochloride** at 2.0-2.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Fosetyl-aluminium** at 2.0-3.0 g/L of water can also be effective.

### 5. Brown Spot (Caused by *Cercospora papayae*)

**Symptoms:** Small, circular to irregular, dark brown spots with a light brown center, often surrounded by a yellow halo, primarily on older leaves. Severe infection can lead to premature defoliation.

**Control Measures:**
*   **Cultural:** Remove and destroy severely infected leaves.
*   **Chemical:**
    *   Spray with **Mancozeb** at 2.0-2.5 g/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, use **Chlorothalonil** at 2.0 g/L of water.
    *   **Carbendazim** at 0.5-1.0 g/L of water can also be used.

### 6. Downy Mildew

This is not known to affect Papaya.

### 7. Powdery Mildew (Caused by *Oidium caricae*)

**Symptoms:** White, powdery patches primarily on the upper surface of leaves, but can also appear on the underside, petioles, and young fruits. Infected leaves may turn yellow, curl, and drop prematurely.

**Control Measures:**
*   **Cultural:** Ensure good air circulation.
*   **Chemical:**
    *   Spray with **Wettable Sulphur** at 2.0-3.0 g/L of water (avoid spraying during very hot weather).
    *   Alternatively, use **Hexaconazole** at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Myclobutanil** at 0.4-0.5 g/L of water is also effective.

### 8. Grey Mildew

This is not known to affect Papaya as a distinct disease. Powdery mildew is the primary mildew affecting papaya.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label for correct dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in pathogens.
*   Apply fungicides preventively or at the first sign of disease for best results.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension services for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and current disease pressure.
