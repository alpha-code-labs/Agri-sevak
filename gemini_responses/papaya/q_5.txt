Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I am pleased to provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing these conditions in Papaya.

Here's how to control Scab, Canker, Gummosis, and Lichen in Papaya:

### 1. Scab (Papaya Scab - *Sphaceloma caricae*)

This condition is known to affect Papaya.
**Description:** Papaya scab is a fungal disease that causes small, circular, water-soaked spots on fruits, leaves, and stems. These spots later become raised, corky, and scabby, leading to fruit distortion, cracking, and reduced marketability.

**Control Measures:**
*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Remove and destroy infected plant parts (leaves, fruits, and twigs) to reduce inoculum.
    *   Ensure proper plant spacing and pruning to improve air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce humidity.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Initiate sprays at the first sign of symptoms or during periods conducive to disease development.
    *   Foliar spray with **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, use **Chlorothalonil** at 2 g/L of water.
    *   For severe infections, **Copper oxychloride** at 3 g/L of water can be effective.
    *   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

### 2. Canker (Various pathogens, e.g., *Phytophthora palmivora*, *Colletotrichum gloeosporioides*, *Xanthomonas campestris* pv. *caricae*)

This condition is known to affect Papaya.
**Description:** Canker manifests as sunken lesions on the stem, branches, and sometimes fruits, often accompanied by the exudation of gum. Severe cankers can girdle the stem, leading to wilting and dieback of the affected parts.

**Control Measures:**
*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Prune affected branches well below the cankered area, ensuring to sterilize pruning tools with a 10% bleach solution between cuts to prevent disease spread.
    *   Avoid mechanical injuries to the trunk and branches, as these can serve as entry points for pathogens.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   For fungal cankers (e.g., *Phytophthora* or Anthracnose-related cankers):
        *   Apply **Fosetyl-aluminium** at 2.5 g/L of water as a foliar spray or drench around the base of the plant.
        *   Alternatively, scrape off the affected bark of the canker and paint the wound with a thick paste of **Copper oxychloride** (e.g., 50 g in 100 ml of water).
    *   For suspected bacterial cankers:
        *   Spray with a combination of **Streptomycin sulfate + Tetracycline hydrochloride** (e.g., 1 g of the combination product per 10 litres of water).

### 3. Gummosis (Often associated with *Phytophthora palmivora*)

This condition is known to affect Papaya.
**Description:** Gummosis is a symptom characterized by the exudation of a sticky, milky, or clear gum from the trunk, branches, or fruits. It often indicates an underlying fungal infection (such as *Phytophthora* foot rot or stem rot) or physiological stress.

**Control Measures:**
*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Improve soil drainage to prevent waterlogging, which is conducive to *Phytophthora* infections.
    *   Avoid planting papaya in heavy, poorly drained soils.
    *   Prevent any injuries to the trunk and root collar region during cultivation.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Drench the soil around the base of affected plants with **Fosetyl-aluminium** at 2.5 g/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, drench with a combination product of **Metalaxyl + Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water.
    *   For existing gummosis lesions on the trunk, gently scrape off the gum and affected bark, then paint the wound with a paste of **Copper oxychloride** (e.g., 50 g in 100 ml of water).

### 4. Lichen

This condition is known to grow on Papaya trees.
**Description:** Lichens are symbiotic organisms composed of a fungus and an alga. They grow superficially on the bark of trees, especially in humid environments. **Lichens are not parasitic** and do not draw nutrients from the papaya tree. They are generally considered harmless epiphytes and are often indicators of good air quality.

**Control Measures:**
*   **Chemical control is generally not recommended** for lichens as they do not cause disease or harm the papaya tree. Applying fungicides unnecessarily can be detrimental to the environment and beneficial organisms.
*   If their presence is aesthetically undesirable or perceived to hinder bark photosynthesis (which is minimal), improving air circulation and light penetration by judicious pruning of surrounding vegetation can reduce their growth.
*   Physical removal by gently scrubbing the bark with a soft brush can be done, but it is usually unnecessary for the health of the tree.

Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions when using any chemical pesticides. For specific recommendations tailored to your farm, it is advisable to consult with local agricultural extension officers.
