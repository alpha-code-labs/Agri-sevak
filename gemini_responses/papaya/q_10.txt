As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Papaya in Haryana:

### Control of Borers in Papaya

Borers in papaya can include stem borers and fruit borers (e.g., fruit fly larvae).

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Regularly inspect plants for signs of borer damage (e.g., wilting shoots, holes in stems, damaged fruits).
    *   Prune and destroy affected plant parts (stems, fruits) to prevent further spread.
    *   Maintain orchard hygiene by removing fallen fruits and plant debris.
    *   Use fruit fly traps (pheromone traps or bait traps) for monitoring and mass trapping of fruit flies.

*   **Chemical Control (for severe infestations):**
    *   For stem borers, inject or drench the affected stem with a systemic insecticide.
    *   For fruit borers (fruit flies), apply bait sprays or cover sprays at the fruit development stage.
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC**: 0.3 ml/L of water.
    *   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG**: 0.2-0.25 g/L of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC**: 0.5 ml/L of water.

### Control of Caterpillars in Papaya

Various leaf-eating caterpillars can infest papaya, causing defoliation.

*   **Cultural and Biological Practices:**
    *   Hand-pick and destroy caterpillars in small infestations.
    *   Encourage natural enemies like parasitic wasps and predatory birds.
    *   Use biopesticides containing *Bacillus thuringiensis* (Bt) for young larvae.

*   **Chemical Control (for severe infestations):**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC**: 0.3 ml/L of water.
    *   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG**: 0.2-0.25 g/L of water.
    *   **Flubendiamide 20% WG**: 0.25-0.3 g/L of water.
    *   **Indoxacarb 14.5% SC**: 0.5 ml/L of water.

### Diamondback Moth in Papaya

This is not known to affect Papaya. Diamondback moth (*Plutella xylostella*) is a specific pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower, mustard).

### Control of Leaf Folder in Papaya

While not a primary pest, some generalist caterpillars may cause leaf folding in papaya. The control measures are similar to those for general caterpillars.

*   **Cultural and Biological Practices:**
    *   Remove and destroy folded leaves containing larvae.
    *   Encourage natural enemies.
    *   Use biopesticides like *Bacillus thuringiensis* (Bt).

*   **Chemical Control (for severe infestations):**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC**: 0.3 ml/L of water.
    *   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG**: 0.2-0.25 g/L of water.
    *   **Flubendiamide 20% WG**: 0.25-0.3 g/L of water.
    *   **Indoxacarb 14.5% SC**: 0.5 ml/L of water.

**General Recommendations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully.
*   Ensure proper coverage during spraying.
*   Observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) for any chemical applied, especially on fruiting plants.
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension officers for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions.
