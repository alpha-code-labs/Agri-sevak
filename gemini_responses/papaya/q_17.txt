As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following doses for organic manures and biostimulants in Papaya cultivation, based on scientific principles and suitability for Haryana's conditions:

### Recommended Doses of Organic Manures and Biostimulants for Papaya

**1. Farmyard Manure (FYM):**
*   **At Planting:** Incorporate 5-10 kg of well-decomposed FYM per pit at the time of planting.
*   **Annual Application:** Apply 10-15 kg of well-decomposed FYM per plant annually. This should be split into two doses:
    *   First dose: During the monsoon season (July-August).
    *   Second dose: During February-March.
    *   Mix the FYM thoroughly into the soil around the plant basin, ensuring it does not directly touch the stem.

**2. Vermicompost:**
*   **At Planting:** Incorporate 2-3 kg of vermicompost per pit at the time of planting.
*   **Annual Application:** Apply 5-7 kg of vermicompost per plant annually. This can also be split into two doses, similar to FYM, and mixed into the soil around the plant basin. Vermicompost is richer in nutrients than FYM, hence a lower dose is sufficient.

**3. Sagarika (Seaweed Extract):**
*   **Sagarika** is a seaweed extract-based biostimulant, not a bulk organic manure. It enhances plant growth, nutrient uptake, and stress tolerance.
*   **Foliar Spray:** Apply **Sagarika (liquid)** at a concentration of 2.5-3 ml per litre of water.
    *   **First Spray:** 30-45 days after planting.
    *   **Subsequent Sprays:** At flowering and fruit development stages, with an interval of 20-30 days, depending on plant vigour and crop requirement. Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.
