As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified cultivation practices for Papaya in Haryana:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   Papaya is primarily propagated through seeds.
    *   Raising seedlings in a nursery and then transplanting them to the main field is the most recommended and efficient method. This allows for selection of healthy seedlings, better field establishment, and management of initial growth.
    *   Seeds can be sown in polybags (15 cm x 20 cm size) or raised nursery beds.
    *   For polybags, sow 2-3 seeds per bag to ensure at least one healthy seedling.
    *   Seedlings are ready for transplanting when they are 15-20 cm tall, typically 6-8 weeks after sowing.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   **For seeds in nursery:** Sow seeds shallowly at a depth of 0.5 - 1.0 cm.
    *   **For transplanting seedlings:** Plant the seedlings at the same depth as they were in the nursery polybag or bed. Ensure the root ball is well covered with soil, but avoid planting too deep, which can lead to stem rot.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   Optimal spacing is crucial for proper growth, light penetration, air circulation, and ease of cultural operations.
    *   A common and recommended spacing for commercial cultivation in Haryana is:
        *   **Row to Row:** 2.0 - 2.5 meters
        *   **Plant to Plant:** 1.5 - 2.0 meters
    *   A spacing of 2.0 m x 1.5 m or 1.8 m x 1.8 m is generally adopted, accommodating approximately 1100-1400 plants per acre.
    *   For high-density planting systems, spacing can be reduced, but this requires specific variety selection and intensive management.

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   The seed rate depends on the variety, germination percentage, and the desired plant population.
    *   Generally, 250 - 300 grams of good quality seeds are sufficient to raise enough seedlings for one acre, assuming a good germination rate and transplanting efficiency.
    *   If planting 2-3 seedlings per pit to ensure the presence of at least one healthy female or hermaphrodite plant, the initial seed requirement might be slightly higher, or careful selection of seedlings from the nursery is needed.
