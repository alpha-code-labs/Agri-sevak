As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified seed and soil treatment processes for Papaya cultivation in Haryana to ensure healthy plant establishment and mitigate early disease and pest issues.

### Recommended Seed Treatment Process for Papaya

Seed treatment is crucial for protecting young seedlings from soil-borne pathogens causing damping-off and root rot, and for improving germination.

*   **Objective:** Protect seeds and emerging seedlings from fungal diseases like damping-off (*Pythium* spp., *Phytophthora* spp.) and anthracnose (*Colletotrichum gloeosporioides*).
*   **Method:** Slurry treatment. Mix the recommended chemical/biological agent with a small amount of water to form a slurry, then coat the seeds evenly. Allow seeds to dry in the shade before sowing.

**Recommendations:**

1.  **Fungicidal Seed Treatment (Chemical):**
    *   Treat seeds with **Thiram** at 2-3 g per kg of seed.
    *   OR **Carbendazim** at 1-2 g per kg of seed.
    *   OR **Captan** at 2-3 g per kg of seed.
    *   *Note:* These treatments provide initial protection against a range of seed and soil-borne fungi.

2.  **Biological Seed Treatment (Bio-fungicide):**
    *   For an eco-friendly approach, treat seeds with **Trichoderma viride** at 4-5 g per kg of seed.
    *   OR **Pseudomonas fluorescens** at 10 g per kg of seed.
    *   *Note:* If using both chemical and biological treatments, apply the chemical fungicide first, allow the seeds to dry, and then apply the biological agent.

### Recommended Soil Treatment Process for Papaya

Soil treatment aims to control soil-borne diseases, nematodes, and improve overall soil health, especially in nursery beds and planting pits.

*   **Objective:** Control soil-borne diseases (damping-off, root rot, collar rot), nematodes (e.g., root-knot nematodes), and enhance beneficial microbial activity.

**Recommendations:**

1.  **Nursery Bed Soil Treatment (if raising seedlings):**
    *   **Solarization:** During hot summer months (May-June), cover the prepared nursery beds with a transparent polyethylene sheet (100-micron thick) for 4-6 weeks. This helps in reducing soil-borne pathogens, nematodes, and weed seeds.
    *   **Fungicidal Drench:** Before sowing or transplanting, drench the nursery beds with:
        *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride** at 2-3 ml per litre of water.
        *   OR **Metalaxyl + Mancozeb** at 2-2.5 g per litre of water.
        *   *Note:* Ensure thorough wetting of the soil.
    *   **Biological Soil Application:** Incorporate bio-fungicides into the nursery soil:
        *   **Trichoderma viride** at 2.5 kg per acre (mixed with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or vermicompost) and apply to the nursery beds.
        *   OR **Pseudomonas fluorescens** at 2.5 kg per acre (mixed with 50-100 kg of FYM/vermicompost).

2.  **Main Field Soil Treatment (before transplanting):**
    *   **Organic Matter Incorporation:** Incorporate 10-15 tonnes per acre of well-decomposed FYM or vermicompost during land preparation to improve soil structure, fertility, and microbial activity.
    *   **Biological Soil Application (Disease & Nematode Management):**
        *   **For Fungal Diseases (Root Rot, Collar Rot):** Apply **Trichoderma viride** at 2.5 kg per acre or **Pseudomonas fluorescens** at 2.5 kg per acre. Mix the bio-agent with 50-100 kg of FYM/vermicompost and apply it to the planting pits or broadcast it evenly before transplanting.
        *   **For Nematode Management (Root-Knot Nematodes):** Apply **Paecilomyces lilacinus** (or *Purpureocillium lilacinum*) at 2.5 kg per acre. Mix with 50-100 kg of FYM/vermicompost and apply to the planting pits. This bio-nematicide helps in suppressing nematode populations.
    *   **Chemical Drench (Post-transplanting, if disease symptoms appear):** If signs of damping-off or collar rot appear after transplanting, a drench around the base of the plants with **Propamocarb hydrochloride** (2-3 ml/L of water) or **Metalaxyl + Mancozeb** (2-2.5 g/L of water) can be applied.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label for specific dosages, application methods, and safety precautions.
*   Integrated Pest and Disease Management (IPDM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods, is highly recommended for sustainable papaya cultivation.
*   Consult your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and disease history.
