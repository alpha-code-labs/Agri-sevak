**Regarding "Tinda/Boll dropping":**
This is not known to affect Papaya. Papaya is a fruit-bearing plant, not a Tinda (Indian round gourd) or cotton plant.

**Regarding Flower and Fruit Drop in Papaya:**

Flower and fruit drop in papaya can be attributed to various physiological, environmental, and nutritional factors. Addressing these underlying causes is crucial for effective control.

**1. Identify and Address Underlying Causes:**

*   **Environmental Stress:**
    *   **Temperature Extremes:** Papaya thrives in warm, humid conditions (20-30°C). Both very high (>38°C) and very low (<15°C) temperatures can cause stress, leading to flower and fruit drop.
    *   **Water Stress:** Both drought (insufficient water) and waterlogging (excessive water) can severely stress the plant. Ensure consistent, adequate moisture without waterlogging.
    *   **High Winds:** Strong winds can physically damage flowers and young fruits, leading to their abscission.
*   **Nutritional Deficiencies:**
    *   **Boron Deficiency:** Critical for pollen viability, fertilization, and fruit set. Deficiency can lead to poor fruit set and dropping.
    *   **Calcium Deficiency:** Important for cell wall integrity and fruit development.
    *   **Overall Nutrient Imbalance:** Lack of balanced NPK fertilization can weaken the plant.
*   **Poor Pollination:** Inadequate pollination due to lack of pollinators or adverse weather during flowering can result in unfertilized flowers dropping.
*   **Physiological Factors:**
    *   **Excessive Vegetative Growth:** If the plant is putting too much energy into leaf production, it may shed flowers/fruits.
    *   **Hormonal Imbalance:** Natural plant hormones regulate flower and fruit development and abscission.

**2. Control Measures:**

Based on the identified causes, the following measures can be adopted:

*   **Optimized Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Water Management:** Maintain consistent soil moisture. Use drip irrigation to provide 10-15 litres of water per plant per day during dry periods. Avoid waterlogging, especially during monsoon.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Apply balanced fertilizers as per soil test recommendations. For general guidance, apply 250 g Nitrogen, 250 g Phosphorus, and 500 g Potassium per plant per year in split doses.
    *   **Weed Control:** Keep the area around the plants weed-free to reduce competition for nutrients and water.
    *   **Windbreaks:** Plant taller trees or erect artificial windbreaks on the windward side to protect papaya plants from strong winds.

*   **Nutritional Supplementation (Foliar Sprays):**
    *   **Boron:** To address boron deficiency, spray **Borax (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate)** at a concentration of 1-2 g/L of water. Apply during flowering and early fruit set stages.
    *   **Calcium:** To address calcium deficiency, spray **Calcium nitrate** at a concentration of 5 g/L of water. Apply during flowering and fruit development stages.
    *   *Note: Ensure good coverage of foliage. Do not mix Borax and Calcium nitrate in the same spray tank.*

*   **Hormonal Regulation:**
    *   **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA):** To reduce flower and fruit drop, spray **Naphthalene Acetic Acid** at a concentration of 10-20 ppm (parts per million). This can be achieved by dissolving 10-20 mg of pure NAA per litre of water, or by using commercially available formulations as per manufacturer's instructions to achieve the desired ppm. Apply at the peak flowering stage and again at early fruit set.
    *   *Caution: Use NAA strictly at recommended low concentrations, as higher doses can have adverse effects.*

By implementing these integrated measures, you can significantly reduce flower and fruit drop in papaya and improve overall yield. Always consult with local agricultural extension services for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions.
