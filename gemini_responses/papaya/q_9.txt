Mites, including Red spider mite (e.g., *Tetranychus urticae*, *Tetranychus cinnabarinus*) and Rust mite (*Phyllocoptruta caricae*), are significant pests of Papaya in Haryana. They can cause considerable damage, leading to reduced yield and fruit quality if not managed effectively.

**Symptoms and Damage:**

1.  **Red Spider Mite:**
    *   Feeds on the underside of leaves, causing yellow speckling, bronzing, and eventually drying and defoliation.
    *   Fine silken webbing may be visible on the underside of leaves, especially during severe infestations.
    *   Infested plants appear unhealthy and stunted.

2.  **Rust Mite (Papaya Mite/Eriophyid Mite):**
    *   These are microscopic mites, not visible to the naked eye.
    *   They cause a characteristic bronzing or russeting on the fruits, petioles, and undersides of leaves.
    *   Affected fruits develop a rough, leathery texture and become discolored, significantly reducing their market value.
    *   Severe infestations can lead to fruit drop and reduced plant vigor.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Weed Management:** Remove weeds around the papaya orchard as they can serve as alternate hosts for mites.
    *   **Proper Irrigation:** Maintain adequate soil moisture. Water stress can make plants more susceptible to mite infestations. Overhead irrigation can sometimes help dislodge mites.
    *   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy heavily infested leaves or plant parts to reduce mite populations.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure balanced fertilization. Excessive nitrogen can sometimes favor mite multiplication.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Conserve and encourage natural enemies such as predatory mites (*Amblyseius* spp.), ladybird beetles, and lacewings, which feed on pest mites. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

**Chemical Control (Acaricides):**

For effective control, especially during severe infestations, the judicious use of CIBRC-approved acaricides is necessary. Always ensure thorough coverage, especially on the underside of leaves and fruits. Rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

Here are some CIBRC-approved technical chemical names for mite control in Papaya:

*   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** Apply at 0.5 ml per litre of water (e.g., 125 ml per 250 litres of water per acre). Effective against all life stages (egg, nymph, adult) of spider mites and has some effect on rust mites.
*   **Propargite 57% EC:** Apply at 2.0-3.0 ml per litre of water (e.g., 500-750 ml per 250 litres of water per acre). A contact acaricide effective against motile stages of spider mites.
*   **Fenpyroximate 5% SC:** Apply at 0.4-0.6 ml per litre of water (e.g., 100-150 ml per 250 litres of water per acre). Effective against all life stages of spider mites.
*   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP:** Apply at 4.0-5.0 g per litre of water (e.g., 1.0-1.25 kg per 250 litres of water per acre). Highly effective against rust mites and also provides good control of spider mites, especially in early stages. It also has fungicidal properties.
*   **Abamectin 1.9% EC:** Apply at 0.3-0.4 ml per litre of water (e.g., 75-100 ml per 250 litres of water per acre). A translaminar acaricide effective against spider mites and also helps in controlling rust mites.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Timing:** Start spraying as soon as the first signs of mite infestation are observed.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and on the fruits, where mites are most active.
*   **Rotation:** Rotate different groups of acaricides to prevent the development of resistance in mite populations.
*   **Safety:** Always read and follow the instructions on the product label regarding dosage, application method, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and safety precautions (wearing protective gear).
