Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm that Scale insects and Mealybugs are significant pests of Papaya in Haryana, causing considerable damage by sucking sap and promoting sooty mold growth. Effective management requires an integrated approach.

Here's a scientifically verified strategy for their control:

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Approach:**

1.  **Regular Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your papaya plants, especially the undersides of leaves, leaf axils, stems, and developing fruits, for early signs of these pests. Early detection is crucial for effective control.

2.  **Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
    *   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy severely infested leaves, branches, or fruits. This reduces the pest population and prevents further spread.
    *   **Water Spray:** For mild infestations, a strong jet of water can dislodge mealybugs and some scales from the plant surface.
    *   **Manual Removal:** For small plants or limited infestations, mealybugs can be removed manually using a cotton swab dipped in soapy water or rubbing alcohol.
    *   **Ant Control:** Control ants, as they protect mealybugs and scales for their honeydew. Use sticky bands on the trunk or ant baits around the base of the plant.

3.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Encourage natural enemies such as ladybird beetles (e.g., *Cryptolaemus montrouzieri*), lacewings, and parasitic wasps. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

4.  **Chemical Control (Use only when necessary and as a last resort):**
    When infestations are severe and cultural/biological methods are insufficient, chemical control may be required. Always ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and in crevices where these pests hide. Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

    **Recommended CIBRC-approved technical chemicals for Scale Insects and Mealybugs in Papaya:**

    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at a concentration of 0.5 - 0.75 ml per litre of water. This is a systemic insecticide effective against sucking pests.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Use at a concentration of 0.2 - 0.3 g per litre of water. Another systemic insecticide providing good control.
    *   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:** Apply at a concentration of 0.75 - 1.0 ml per litre of water. This insecticide offers excellent systemic and translaminar action, reaching pests hidden in crevices.
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Use at a concentration of 1.25 - 1.5 ml per litre of water. This is an insect growth regulator, particularly effective against the nymphal stages of mealybugs and scales.
    *   **Malathion 50% EC:** For severe outbreaks, a contact insecticide like Malathion can be used at a concentration of 1.5 - 2.0 ml per litre of water for quick knockdown.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Adherence to Label Instructions:** Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the pesticide label regarding dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   **Safety:** Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, and protective clothing during mixing and spraying.
*   **Timing of Application:** Apply insecticides during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   **Water Quality:** Ensure good quality water for spraying, as hard water can reduce the effectiveness of some pesticides.
*   **Resistance Management:** Do not use the same chemical repeatedly. Rotate between different classes of insecticides to prevent pests from developing resistance.

By adopting these practices, you can effectively manage Scale insects and Mealybugs in your Papaya orchard. For any specific concerns or severe infestations, please consult with the local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts.
