As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach for controlling soil pests like termites and nematodes in papaya, focusing on cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods.

**General Management Principles:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Keep the field free of weeds, crop debris, and dead wood, which can harbor pests.
*   **Soil Health:** Improve soil organic matter content through farmyard manure (FYM) or compost application, which enhances beneficial microbial activity and plant vigor.
*   **Regular Monitoring:** Inspect plants regularly for early signs of pest infestation.

### 1. Control of Termites (Deemak)

Termites (e.g., *Odontotermes obesus*) attack the roots and collar region of papaya plants, leading to wilting, yellowing, and eventual plant death.

**A. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   **Deep Ploughing:** Before planting, deep ploughing exposes termite colonies to predators and sunlight.
*   **Removal of Debris:** Remove any dead wood, stumps, or organic debris from the field that can serve as food sources or nesting sites for termites.
*   **Avoid Water Stress:** Healthy, well-irrigated plants are less susceptible to termite attack.

**B. Chemical Control (Curative and Preventive):**
For established plants showing signs of termite damage, or as a preventive measure in high-risk areas, soil drenching is recommended.

*   **Pre-planting Treatment:**
    *   Mix **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** at 2.5 litres per acre with 500-1000 litres of water and drench the soil before planting.
*   **Post-planting Treatment (Drenching around affected plants):**
    *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC**: Mix 2.5-5 ml per litre of water and drench around the base of the affected plants (2-3 litres solution per plant, depending on plant size).
    *   **Fipronil 5% SC**: Mix 1.5-2 ml per litre of water and drench around the base of the affected plants (2-3 litres solution per plant).

### 2. Control of Nematodes (Root-Knot Nematodes - *Meloidogyne* spp.)

Root-knot nematodes are microscopic worms that infect plant roots, causing characteristic galls or knots. This impairs the plant's ability to absorb water and nutrients, leading to stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, reduced fruit size, and overall decline in plant health and yield.

**A. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate papaya with non-host crops like marigold (Tagetes spp.), mustard, or specific varieties of cereals for at least 2-3 years to reduce nematode populations in the soil.
*   **Solarization:** In summer, cover moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks to raise soil temperature and kill nematodes. This is best done before planting.
*   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost at 10-15 tonnes per acre.
*   **Neem Cake Application:** Apply **Neem cake** at 250-500 grams per plant around the root zone. Neem cake releases compounds that are toxic to nematodes and also promotes beneficial soil microbes.
*   **Use of Healthy Seedlings:** Always use nematode-free seedlings from a reputable nursery.

**B. Biological Control:**
*   **Bio-nematicides:** Apply beneficial fungi that parasitize nematodes.
    *   **Purpureocillium lilacinum (formerly Paecilomyces lilacinus) 1% WP**: Mix 2.5 kg per acre with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed FYM or compost and apply to the soil around the plants, or drench with 5 grams per litre of water around the plant base. Repeat application after 3-4 months if infestation is severe.
    *   **Bacillus subtilis (liquid formulation)**: Apply as a soil drench at recommended rates (e.g., 2-5 ml per litre of water) to enhance plant resistance and suppress nematodes.

**C. Chemical Control:**
Chemical nematicides should be used judiciously and as a last resort, especially in conjunction with cultural and biological methods.

*   **Soil Drenching:**
    *   **Fipronil 5% SC**: Mix 1.5-2 ml per litre of water and drench around the base of the plants (2-3 litres solution per plant). This chemical has some activity against nematodes in addition to termites.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG**: Mix 0.5 grams per litre of water and drench around the base of the plants (2-3 litres solution per plant). This systemic insecticide can help in managing nematodes by improving plant vigor and providing some direct nematicidal effect.
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL**: Mix 0.75-1 ml per litre of water and drench around the base of the plants (2-3 litres solution per plant). While primarily an insecticide, soil application can contribute to overall plant health and resilience against soil pests, including some nematode suppression.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the product label for dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest intervals.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Consult your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and the severity of the infestation.
