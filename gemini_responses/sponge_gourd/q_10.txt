As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in Sponge Gourd (Luffa aegyptiaca) in Haryana.

Effective pest management in Sponge Gourd relies on an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, mechanical, biological, and judicious chemical methods.

**General Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Principles for Sponge Gourd:**

*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy affected fruits, leaves, and plant debris regularly to reduce pest populations.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting cucurbits in the same field consecutively.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available, choose varieties known to have some resistance or tolerance to common pests.
*   **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect plants for early signs of pest infestation to enable timely intervention.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Maintain balanced fertilization to promote healthy plant growth, as stressed plants are more susceptible to pests.

Here's how to control the specific pests you mentioned:

### 1. Borers (Fruit Borers and Melon Fruit Fly)

Borers in Sponge Gourd primarily refer to fruit borers (caterpillars like *Sphenarches caffer* or *Diaphania indica*) and the Melon Fruit Fly (*Bactrocera cucurbitae*), which is a major pest.

**Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   Collect and destroy infested fruits regularly to break the pest life cycle.
*   Use pheromone traps (e.g., methyl eugenol traps for melon fruit fly) at a density of 4-5 traps per acre to monitor and mass trap male flies.
*   Bagging of developing fruits with paper or cloth bags can protect them from fruit fly and fruit borer attack.

**Chemical Control (Apply when infestation crosses economic threshold level):**
*   **For Melon Fruit Fly (Bait Spray):**
    *   Prepare a bait solution by mixing 100 ml of **Malathion 50% EC** with 1 kg of jaggery or molasses in 10 litres of water. Apply small droplets of this solution on leaves at 10-15 spots per acre, preferably in the morning. Repeat weekly.
*   **For Fruit Borers (Caterpillars):**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC**: 60 ml per acre (in 200-250 L water).
    *   **Flubendiamide 20% WG**: 60 g per acre (in 200-250 L water).
    *   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG**: 80-100 g per acre (in 200-250 L water).
    *   **Spinosad 45% SC**: 60-75 ml per acre (in 200-250 L water).

### 2. Caterpillars (Leaf-feeding Caterpillars)

This refers to various leaf-feeding caterpillars that can defoliate Sponge Gourd plants, such as tobacco caterpillar (*Spodoptera litura*) or semiloopers.

**Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   Hand-pick and destroy visible caterpillars and egg masses in early stages of infestation.
*   Encourage natural enemies like predatory birds and parasitic wasps.

**Chemical Control (Apply when infestation crosses economic threshold level):**
*   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC**: 60 ml per acre (in 200-250 L water).
*   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG**: 80-100 g per acre (in 200-250 L water).
*   **Indoxacarb 14.5% SC**: 200 ml per acre (in 200-250 L water).
*   **Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) var. kurstaki**: 1-2 kg per acre (or 2-4 g/L water) for early instar larvae.

### 3. Diamondback Moth

This is not known to affect Sponge Gourd. Diamondback moth (*Plutella xylostella*) is a specific pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower, mustard).

### 4. Leaf Folder

Leaf folders (*Diaphania indica* is a common species, also known as cucurbit leaf folder/webber) fold leaves and feed from within, causing damage to the foliage.

**Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   Remove and destroy folded leaves containing larvae to reduce pest population.
*   Maintain field hygiene.

**Chemical Control (Apply when infestation crosses economic threshold level):**
*   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC**: 60 ml per acre (in 200-250 L water).
*   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG**: 80-100 g per acre (in 200-250 L water).
*   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC**: 200-250 ml per acre (in 200-250 L water).

**Important Precautions for Chemical Application:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully, including dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Observe the specified Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) for each chemical to ensure the safety of the produce.
*   Rotate different classes of insecticides to prevent the development of pesticide resistance in pest populations.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying.
*   Spray during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
