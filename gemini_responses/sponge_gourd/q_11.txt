As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in Sponge Gourd in Haryana:

**Control of Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies in Sponge Gourd**

**1. Sawflies:**
This is not known to affect Sponge Gourd.

**2. Weevils:**
This is not known to affect Sponge Gourd.

**3. Beetles:**
Beetles, particularly the Red Pumpkin Beetle (*Aulacophora foveicollis*), are significant pests of Sponge Gourd, especially during the seedling stage. Both adults and grubs cause damage. Adults feed on leaves, flowers, and fruits, while grubs feed on roots and underground stems. Severe infestation can lead to plant death, particularly in young plants.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Beetles:**

To effectively manage beetle populations, an integrated approach combining cultural, mechanical, and chemical methods is recommended.

**A. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   **Early Sowing:** Sowing crops early can help plants establish before peak pest populations emerge.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Keep the field free of weeds and crop debris, which can harbor pests.
*   **Manual Collection:** Collect and destroy adult beetles, especially in the early morning when they are less active. This is particularly effective in small plots.
*   **Ash Application:** Dusting seedlings with wood ash or a mixture of ash and neem cake can act as a repellent.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting cucurbits in the same field consecutively to break the pest life cycle.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** After harvest, deep ploughing helps expose and destroy pupae in the soil.

**B. Chemical Control (Use only CIBRC approved technical chemicals):**
When beetle infestation is severe, especially at the seedling stage, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

*   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at a rate of **0.5 ml/L** of water (or 100-125 ml/acre).
*   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at a rate of **0.4 g/L** of water (or 80-100 g/acre).
*   **Malathion 50% EC:** Apply at a rate of **2 ml/L** of water (or 400-500 ml/acre).
*   **Cypermethrin 25% EC:** Apply at a rate of **0.8 ml/L** of water (or 160-200 ml/acre).

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully.
*   Ensure proper coverage during spraying.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) while handling and applying pesticides.
*   Observe the recommended pre-harvest interval (PHI) before harvesting the fruits.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension officers for the most current and specific recommendations for your region.
