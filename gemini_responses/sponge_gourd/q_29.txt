As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling flower and fruit drop in Sponge Gourd (Luffa aegyptiaca).

Firstly, please note that "Tinda/Boll dropping" is not known to affect Sponge Gourd. Tinda (Indian round gourd) is a different cucurbit, and boll dropping refers to cotton.

Flower and fruit drop in Sponge Gourd can be attributed to several factors, primarily environmental stress, nutritional deficiencies, and hormonal imbalances. Effective control involves a combination of good cultural practices and targeted nutritional/hormonal interventions.

**Common Causes of Flower and Fruit Drop in Sponge Gourd:**

1.  **Environmental Stress:**
    *   **Temperature Extremes:** Very high or very low temperatures can inhibit pollen viability and fertilization.
    *   **Water Stress:** Both drought conditions and waterlogging can lead to flower and fruit abortion.
    *   **Humidity:** Very low or very high humidity can affect pollination.
2.  **Nutritional Deficiencies:**
    *   Lack of essential micronutrients like Boron and Calcium, which are crucial for pollen germination, fertilization, and cell wall development.
    *   Deficiencies in macronutrients like Phosphorus and Potassium can also weaken the plant and lead to dropping.
3.  **Poor Pollination:**
    *   Insufficient pollinator activity (e.g., bees) due to adverse weather or lack of pollinator-attracting plants.
    *   Lack of viable pollen.
4.  **Hormonal Imbalance:**
    *   An imbalance of plant hormones (auxins, gibberellins, cytokinins) can lead to the formation of an abscission layer, causing flowers and young fruits to drop.
5.  **Pest and Disease Pressure:**
    *   Severe infestations of pests (e.g., fruit flies, mites) or diseases can weaken the plant, indirectly leading to flower and fruit drop.

**Control Measures for Flower and Fruit Drop in Sponge Gourd:**

To effectively manage flower and fruit drop, consider the following integrated approach:

1.  **Optimized Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Irrigation Management:** Maintain consistent soil moisture. Irrigate regularly, especially during flowering and fruit development stages. Avoid both water scarcity and waterlogging.
    *   **Mulching:** Apply organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves) around the base of plants to conserve soil moisture, regulate soil temperature, and suppress weeds.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Conduct a soil test to determine nutrient status. Apply balanced fertilizers (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium) as per recommendations for Sponge Gourd.
    *   **Pollination Enhancement:** Encourage natural pollinators by planting flowering plants nearby or by avoiding insecticide sprays during peak flowering hours. If natural pollination is insufficient, hand pollination can be done in the early morning.
    *   **Weed Control:** Keep the field free of weeds, which compete for water and nutrients.

2.  **Nutritional Management (Foliar Application):**
    *   **Boron Deficiency:** Boron is critical for pollen tube growth and fruit set.
        *   Foliar spray of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** at 1-1.5 g/L of water, or **Sodium tetraborate decahydrate** (Borax) at 2-3 g/L of water, at the pre-flowering and early fruit set stages. Repeat after 10-15 days if symptoms persist.
    *   **Calcium Deficiency:** Calcium is essential for cell wall integrity and fruit development.
        *   Foliar spray of **Calcium nitrate** at 5 g/L of water, at the pre-flowering and early fruit set stages. Repeat after 10-15 days if needed.
    *   **Potassium and Phosphorus:** Ensure adequate soil application of these macronutrients as per soil test recommendations.

3.  **Hormonal Regulation:**
    *   **Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs):** Auxins can help prevent the formation of the abscission layer.
        *   Foliar spray of **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA)** 4.5% SL at 10-20 ppm (0.2-0.4 ml/L of water) at the pre-flowering stage and again at the early fruit set stage. This helps in fruit retention.

4.  **Pest and Disease Management:**
    *   Regularly scout for pests and diseases. Implement appropriate control measures to keep plants healthy and vigorous, as stressed plants are more prone to dropping flowers and fruits.

By implementing these scientifically verified practices, you can significantly reduce flower and fruit drop and improve the yield of your Sponge Gourd crop. Always ensure proper calibration of spray equipment and follow label instructions for all chemical applications.
