As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies in Sponge Gourd (Luffa aegyptiaca) in Haryana.

It is crucial to conduct a soil test before planting and periodically during the crop cycle to accurately diagnose nutrient deficiencies and determine precise fertilizer requirements. Visual symptoms can indicate a deficiency, but soil testing provides a definitive diagnosis.

### Addressing Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

Nitrogen deficiency in Sponge Gourd typically manifests as a general yellowing (chlorosis) of older leaves, stunted growth, and reduced fruit set. The plant may appear pale green.

**Correction Measures:**

*   **Foliar Application (for quick relief):**
    *   Spray 1-2% solution of **Urea** (10-20 g of Urea per litre of water). Apply during cooler parts of the day. Repeat after 7-10 days if symptoms persist.
*   **Soil Application (for sustained supply):**
    *   Apply **Urea** at a rate of 20-30 kg per acre as a top-dressing, depending on the severity of the deficiency and soil test recommendations. Ensure proper irrigation after application.
    *   Alternatively, **Calcium Ammonium Nitrate (CAN)** can be applied at 30-50 kg per acre.

### Addressing Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

Phosphorus deficiency in Sponge Gourd often leads to stunted growth, dark green or purplish discoloration of older leaves, poor root development, delayed flowering, and reduced fruit production.

**Correction Measures:**

*   **Foliar Application (for quick relief):**
    *   Spray 0.5-1% solution of **Monoammonium Phosphate (MAP)** (5-10 g of MAP per litre of water) or **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (5-10 g of DAP per litre of water, ensuring it's fully dissolved). Apply during cooler parts of the day.
*   **Soil Application (for sustained supply):**
    *   Apply **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** at 50-75 kg per acre or **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)** at 25-40 kg per acre. This should ideally be incorporated into the soil before planting or as a side-dressing.

### Addressing Potassium (K) Deficiency

Potassium deficiency in Sponge Gourd is characterized by yellowing and browning (scorching) of the leaf margins, particularly on older leaves. The plant may show weak stems, poor fruit quality, and reduced resistance to diseases.

**Correction Measures:**

*   **Foliar Application (for quick relief):**
    *   Spray 0.5-1% solution of **Potassium Nitrate (KNO3)** (5-10 g of KNO3 per litre of water) or **Monopotassium Phosphate (MKP)** (5-10 g of MKP per litre of water). Apply during cooler parts of the day.
*   **Soil Application (for sustained supply):**
    *   Apply **Muriate of Potash (Potassium Chloride)** at 25-40 kg per acre or **Sulphate of Potash (Potassium Sulphate)** at 20-35 kg per acre. This can be applied as a basal dose or as a side-dressing.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always ensure uniform application of fertilizers.
*   Irrigate adequately after soil application of fertilizers to facilitate nutrient uptake and prevent root burn.
*   Combine these measures with good agricultural practices, including proper irrigation, weed control, and integrated pest management, for optimal plant health and yield.
*   For severe deficiencies, multiple applications at lower concentrations may be more effective than a single high-concentration application.
