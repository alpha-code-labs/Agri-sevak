As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm the following regarding rust diseases in Sponge Gourd:

This is not known to affect Sponge Gourd.

The common rust diseases (Black, Brown, Yellow, and Red rusts) are primarily diseases of cereal crops and other specific plant families, not cucurbits like Sponge Gourd (*Luffa aegyptiaca*). Similarly, White rust, caused by *Albugo* species, is more commonly associated with cruciferous crops and is not a significant or known disease of Sponge Gourd.

Sponge Gourd is more commonly affected by other fungal diseases such as downy mildew, powdery mildew, anthracnose, and gummy stem blight.
