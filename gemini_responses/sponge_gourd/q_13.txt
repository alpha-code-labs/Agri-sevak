As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing pests in Sponge Gourd in Haryana.

### Control of Fruit Fly in Sponge Gourd

Fruit flies (primarily *Bactrocera cucurbitae*) are a major pest of cucurbit crops like Sponge Gourd, causing significant damage by laying eggs in young fruits, leading to rotting and premature fruit drop.

**Integrated Management Strategies:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Regularly collect and destroy all infested, fallen, or damaged fruits by burying them deep in the soil or burning them. This breaks the life cycle of the pest.
    *   **Deep Ploughing:** After harvest, deep ploughing exposes pupae in the soil to predators and harsh weather conditions, reducing the next generation's population.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting cucurbits in the same field consecutively.
    *   **Early Sowing/Harvesting:** Adjusting sowing time to avoid peak fruit fly activity can help. Harvesting fruits at an immature stage can also reduce infestation.

2.  **Mechanical/Physical Methods:**
    *   **Pheromone Traps:** Install specific cucurbit fruit fly pheromone traps (e.g., Cue-lure traps) at a density of 10-12 traps per acre. Replace the lure every 2-3 weeks. These traps attract and kill male fruit flies, reducing the breeding population.
    *   **Fruit Bagging:** For small-scale cultivation, individual fruits can be covered with paper or cloth bags once they start developing to prevent egg-laying.

3.  **Chemical Control (Use only CIBRC approved technical chemicals):**
    *   **Poison Bait Sprays:** This is a highly effective method. Prepare a bait by mixing an insecticide with a food attractant. Spray this mixture in small patches on the foliage (not the entire plant) or on waste fruits, preferably in the morning.
        *   **Malathion 50% EC**: Mix 2 ml of **Malathion 50% EC** with 10 g of jaggery or molasses per liter of water.
    *   **Foliar Sprays (if infestation is severe and other methods are insufficient):**
        *   **Spinosad 45% SC**: Apply 0.2 - 0.3 ml/L of water (e.g., 60-90 ml per acre in 300 L of water).
        *   **Cyantraniliprole 10.26% OD**: Apply 0.6 ml/L of water (e.g., 180 ml per acre in 300 L of water).
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC**: Apply 0.6 - 1.0 ml/L of water (e.g., 180-300 ml per acre in 300 L of water).

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always follow the manufacturer's instructions for dosage and safety precautions.
*   Observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) for any chemical applied to ensure fruit safety.
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

### Control of Ber Fly in Sponge Gourd

This is not known to affect Sponge Gourd. The Ber fly (*Carpomyia vesuviana*) is a host-specific pest primarily affecting Ber (*Ziziphus mauritiana*) fruits.
