Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the critical importance of balanced nutrition for optimal growth and yield in Sponge Gourd. Micronutrient deficiencies can significantly impact crop health and productivity. It is crucial to confirm any suspected deficiency through soil and/or plant tissue analysis before applying specific nutrients. Visual symptoms can sometimes be misleading.

Here's how to address the common micronutrient deficiencies in Sponge Gourd, using CIBRC approved technical chemical names and metric units:

### General Recommendations for Micronutrient Management:

*   **Soil Testing:** Always begin with a comprehensive soil test to accurately determine the nutrient status of your field. This is the most reliable way to identify specific deficiencies.
*   **Foliar Application:** For quick correction of deficiencies, especially in alkaline soils common in Haryana where soil-applied micronutrients can get fixed, foliar sprays are highly effective.
*   **Timing:** Apply foliar sprays during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late afternoon) to maximize absorption and prevent leaf scorching.
*   **Wetting Agent:** Always use a good quality non-ionic spreader/sticker (wetting agent) with foliar sprays to ensure uniform coverage and better absorption.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management:** Combine chemical applications with organic matter addition (Farm Yard Manure, compost) to improve soil health and nutrient availability over the long term.

### Specific Micronutrient Deficiency Management:

#### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency:
*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, small leaves (often called 'little leaf'), interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, and bronzing of older leaves.
*   **Recommendations:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 10-12 kg/acre of **Zinc sulfate monohydrate** (33% Zn) or 20-25 kg/acre of **Zinc sulfate heptahydrate** (21% Zn) as a basal dose or broadcast before sowing/planting.
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.5% solution of **Zinc sulfate heptahydrate** (5 g/L of water) or 0.1% solution of **Zinc EDTA** (1 g/L of water). Repeat after 10-15 days if symptoms persist.

#### 2. Iron (Fe) Deficiency:
*   **Symptoms:** Prominent interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on young leaves, with veins remaining green. In severe cases, the entire leaf may turn pale yellow or white.
*   **Recommendations:**
    *   **Soil Application:** In severe cases, 10-20 kg/acre of **Ferrous sulfate heptahydrate** (19% Fe) can be applied, but its effectiveness can be limited in alkaline soils.
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.5-1% solution of **Ferrous sulfate heptahydrate** (5-10 g/L of water) or 0.1-0.2% solution of **Ferrous EDTA** (1-2 g/L of water). Repeat at 7-10 day intervals until symptoms disappear.

#### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency:
*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, thickening and cracking of stems and petioles, poor fruit set, malformed or cracked fruits, and sometimes internal browning of fruits. Growing points may die back.
*   **Recommendations:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 2-4 kg/acre of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (20% B) or 4-8 kg/acre of **Sodium tetraborate decahydrate** (Borax, 10.5-11.3% B) before sowing. Apply carefully as excess boron can be toxic.
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.1-0.15% solution of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (1-1.5 g/L of water) or 0.1-0.2% solution of **Sodium tetraborate decahydrate** (1-2 g/L of water) at flowering and fruit development stages.

#### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency:
*   **Symptoms:** Necrosis (death) of young leaves and growing points, stunted root growth, and sometimes blossom end rot in fruits (though less common in sponge gourd compared to other cucurbits or solanaceous crops).
*   **Recommendations:**
    *   **Soil Application:** If soil pH is low or calcium is severely deficient, apply 200-500 kg/acre of **Calcium sulfate dihydrate** (Gypsum, 23% Ca) as a soil amendment. For direct calcium supply, 10-20 kg/acre of **Calcium nitrate** (19% Ca) can be applied.
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.5-1% solution of **Calcium nitrate** (5-10 g/L of water) or 0.5% solution of **Calcium chloride** (5 g/L of water) at critical growth stages, especially during fruit development.

#### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency:
*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, starting from the leaf margins and progressing inwards, with veins remaining green. Leaves may become brittle and develop reddish-purple tints in severe cases.
*   **Recommendations:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 10-20 kg/acre of **Magnesium sulfate heptahydrate** (9.6% Mg) as a basal application.
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.5-1% solution of **Magnesium sulfate heptahydrate** (5-10 g/L of water). Repeat after 10-15 days if symptoms persist.

#### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency:
*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, similar to iron deficiency but often with a finer network of green veins. In severe cases, small necrotic spots may appear on the yellowed areas.
*   **Recommendations:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 5-10 kg/acre of **Manganese sulfate monohydrate** (30.5% Mn), but its effectiveness can be limited in alkaline soils.
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 0.5% solution of **Manganese sulfate monohydrate** (5 g/L of water) or 0.1% solution of **Manganese EDTA** (1 g/L of water). Repeat after 10-15 days if symptoms persist.

Always consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions.
