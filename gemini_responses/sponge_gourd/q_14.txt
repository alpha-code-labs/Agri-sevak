As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an integrated approach for managing soil pests like termites and root-knot nematodes in Sponge Gourd, combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods.

### Control of Termites in Sponge Gourd

Termites can cause significant damage by feeding on roots and the collar region of plants, leading to wilting and plant death, especially in sandy soils and during dry periods.

**1. Cultural and Biological Control:**
*   **Deep Ploughing:** Conduct deep summer ploughing to expose termite colonies to sunlight and predators.
*   **Removal of Debris:** Clear crop residues, stubble, and woody debris from the field, as these can serve as food sources for termites.
*   **Proper Irrigation:** Maintain adequate soil moisture, as termites prefer dry conditions.
*   **Farmyard Manure (FYM):** Incorporate well-decomposed FYM, as it improves soil health and can encourage beneficial microorganisms.

**2. Chemical Control (as per CIBRC approval):**
For severe infestations or as a prophylactic measure in known problem areas:
*   **Pre-sowing/Pre-planting Soil Treatment:**
    *   Apply **Fipronil 0.3% GR** at 10 kg/acre, mixed thoroughly into the soil before sowing or transplanting.
    *   Alternatively, drench the soil with **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** at 2-2.5 L/acre, mixed in 400-500 L of water, and incorporate into the soil before planting.
*   **Post-emergence (if infestation observed):**
    *   Drench the soil around the base of affected plants with **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** at 4 ml/L of water.

### Control of Nematodes (Root-knot) in Sponge Gourd

Root-knot nematodes (*Meloidogyne spp.*) are a major threat to Sponge Gourd, causing characteristic galls on roots, leading to stunted growth, nutrient deficiency symptoms, and significant yield reduction.

**1. Cultural and Biological Control:**
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice rotation with non-host crops like cereals (wheat, maize, sorghum) for at least 2-3 years. Avoid continuous cultivation of susceptible crops.
*   **Summer Ploughing:** Deep ploughing during summer exposes nematode eggs and larvae to heat and desiccation, reducing their population.
*   **Solarization:** For small areas, cover moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks during hot summer months to kill nematodes.
*   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporate well-decomposed Farmyard Manure (FYM) or compost at 10-15 tonnes/acre.
*   **Neem Cake:** Apply neem cake at 200-400 kg/acre, mixed into the soil 2-3 weeks before sowing. Neem cake has nematicidal properties and enhances soil health.
*   **Bio-nematicides:** Apply bio-agents like *Paecilomyces lilacinus* or *Trichoderma harzianum* (available as commercial formulations) at 2-4 kg/acre, mixed with FYM and applied to the soil before planting.

**2. Chemical Control (as per CIBRC approval):**
When nematode populations are high and cultural methods alone are insufficient:
*   **At Sowing/Transplanting:**
    *   Apply **Carbofuran 3% CG** at 13.3 kg/acre in furrows at the time of sowing or around the plants after transplanting.
    *   Alternatively, apply **Cadusafos 10% GR** at 4 kg/acre in furrows at the time of sowing.
    *   Another option is **Phorate 10% CG** at 4 kg/acre, applied in furrows at the time of sowing.

**Important Precautions:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) while handling and applying chemicals.
*   Ensure proper disposal of empty containers.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension officers for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions.
