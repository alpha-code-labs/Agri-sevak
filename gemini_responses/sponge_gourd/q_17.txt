As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, here are the recommended doses of organic manures for Sponge Gourd in Haryana:

*   **Farm Yard Manure (FYM):**
    *   Apply 10-15 tonnes per acre during land preparation, at least 2-3 weeks before sowing or transplanting. Ensure the FYM is well-decomposed to avoid nutrient immobilization and pest issues.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   Apply 2-4 tonnes per acre during land preparation or as a top dressing around the plants during active growth stages.

*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract):**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Mix 2.5 - 5 ml of **Sagarika** per litre of water and spray at critical growth stages such as vegetative growth, pre-flowering, and fruit development.
    *   **Soil Application/Drip Irrigation:** Apply 1-2 litres of **Sagarika** per acre, mixed with irrigation water or as a drench around the root zone, particularly during active growth phases.
