As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following fertilizer schedule for Sponge Gourd cultivation in Haryana. Please note that a **soil test is the most accurate way to determine specific nutrient requirements** for your field. The following are general recommendations for a healthy crop under typical Haryana conditions.

**General NPK Recommendation (per acre):**
*   Nitrogen (N): 80-100 kg
*   Phosphorus (P2O5): 50-60 kg
*   Potassium (K2O): 50-60 kg

**Fertilizer Breakdown and Application Schedule:**

**1. Basal Application (at planting/sowing):**
Apply the entire dose of Phosphorus, half the dose of Potassium, and a portion of Nitrogen at the time of field preparation or sowing.

*   **Phosphorus Source (Choose one):**
    *   **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP):** 110-130 kg/acre (This provides approximately 20-23 kg N and 50-60 kg P2O5).
    *   **OR Single Superphosphate (SSP):** 310-375 kg/acre (This provides 50-60 kg P2O5 and also supplies Sulphur).
*   **Potassium Source:**
    *   **Muriate of Potash (MOP):** 40-50 kg/acre (This provides approximately 24-30 kg K2O, which is half of the total K requirement).
*   **Sulphur Source:**
    *   If you are using **Single Superphosphate (SSP)**, it provides sufficient Sulphur.
    *   If you are using **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)**, apply **Elemental Sulphur (90%):** 10-15 kg/acre.

**2. Top Dressing (Split Doses for Nitrogen and remaining Potassium):**
The remaining Nitrogen and Potassium should be applied in 2-3 split doses to ensure continuous nutrient availability to the crop.

*   **First Top Dressing (3-4 weeks after sowing/transplanting):**
    *   **Urea:** 65-85 kg/acre (This provides approximately 30-40 kg N). *Adjust this quantity based on the Nitrogen supplied by DAP in the basal application.*
*   **Second Top Dressing (at flowering/early fruit set):**
    *   **Urea:** 65-85 kg/acre (This provides approximately 30-40 kg N).
    *   **Muriate of Potash (MOP):** 40-50 kg/acre (This provides the remaining 24-30 kg K2O).

**3. Nano Fertilizers (Foliar Application - Supplementary):**
Nano fertilizers are highly efficient and are applied as foliar sprays to supplement granular fertilizers, especially during critical growth stages. They do not fully replace basal granular applications.

*   **Nano-Urea:**
    *   Apply 2-3 foliar sprays starting from 30-45 days after sowing, and subsequent sprays at 15-20 day intervals.
    *   Dose: 2-4 ml/L of water.
*   **Nano-DAP:**
    *   Apply 2-3 foliar sprays, particularly during flowering and fruit development stages.
    *   Dose: 2-4 ml/L of water.

**4. NPK (Complex Fertilizers):**
While the above recommendation focuses on single fertilizers, complex NPK fertilizers can also be used.
*   **NPK (19:19:19):** Can be used as a foliar spray at 5 g/L of water during vegetative growth or early flowering stages if a quick boost of balanced nutrients is required. Adjust other fertilizer applications accordingly.

**Summary of Recommended Fertilizers and Doses (per acre):**

*   **Basal Application:**
    *   **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP):** 110-130 kg OR **Single Superphosphate (SSP):** 310-375 kg
    *   **Muriate of Potash (MOP):** 40-50 kg
    *   **Elemental Sulphur (90%):** 10-15 kg (if not using SSP)
*   **Top Dressing (Split Doses):**
    *   **Urea:** Total 130-170 kg (split into 2-3 doses, adjusted for N from DAP)
    *   **Muriate of Potash (MOP):** 40-50 kg (remaining half)
*   **Foliar Application:**
    *   **Nano-Urea:** 2-4 ml/L water (2-3 sprays)
    *   **Nano-DAP:** 2-4 ml/L water (2-3 sprays)
    *   **NPK (19:19:19):** 5 g/L water (foliar, if needed)
