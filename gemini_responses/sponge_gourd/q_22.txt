As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following cultivation practices for Sponge Gourd (Luffa aegyptiaca / Luffa cylindrica) in Haryana:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   Sponge gourd is typically direct-seeded.
    *   Seeds can be sown in pits or furrows. For commercial cultivation, row planting is preferred.
    *   It is a vining crop and can be grown either on the ground or trained on trellises/pandals for better fruit quality, yield, and ease of harvesting. Training on support structures is highly recommended.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   Seeds should be sown at a depth of 2.0 to 3.0 cm.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   **For ground cultivation:**
        *   Row to row: 2.5 - 3.0 meters
        *   Plant to plant: 0.9 - 1.2 meters
    *   **For trellis/pandal cultivation:**
        *   Row to row: 2.0 - 2.5 meters
        *   Plant to plant: 0.6 - 0.9 meters
    *   Generally, 2-3 seeds are sown per pit/hill, and after germination, they are thinned to 1-2 healthy seedlings per spot.

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   An average seed rate of 2.0 - 3.0 kg per acre is recommended, depending on the variety, seed size, and desired plant population.
