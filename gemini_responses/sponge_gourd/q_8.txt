As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling sucking pests in Sponge Gourd in Haryana.

Effective management of sucking pests in Sponge Gourd requires an integrated approach, combining cultural practices, regular monitoring, and judicious use of CIBRC-approved insecticides when necessary.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Principles:**

1.  **Regular Monitoring:** Regularly inspect plants, especially the undersides of leaves and growing tips, for the presence of pests. Early detection is crucial for effective control.
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Maintain field hygiene by removing weeds, which can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
    *   Ensure balanced nutrition and proper irrigation to promote plant vigor, making them more resilient to pest attack.
    *   Use yellow sticky traps (10-15 traps per acre) to monitor and mass-trap whiteflies and leafhoppers.
3.  **Biological Control:** Encourage natural enemies like ladybird beetles, lacewings, and parasitic wasps, which prey on aphids and whiteflies. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

**Specific Pest Control:**

**Psylla:**
This is not known to affect Sponge Gourd.

**Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips:**
For these common sucking pests, if pest populations exceed economic threshold levels, the following CIBRC-approved technical chemicals can be used. Always ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves. Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

**Recommended Insecticides (Apply with 200-250 litres of water per acre):**

*   **For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips:**
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: 100-125 ml per acre
    *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: 80-100 g per acre
    *   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP: 80-100 g per acre
    *   **Diafenthiuron** 50% WP: 250-300 g per acre (Effective against whiteflies, thrips, and also mites)

*   **Primarily for Aphids and Whiteflies:**
    *   **Flonicamid** 50% WG: 120-150 g per acre
    *   **Pymetrozine** 50% WG: 120 g per acre

*   **Primarily for Whitefly Nymphs (Insect Growth Regulator):**
    *   **Buprofezin** 25% SC: 400-600 ml per acre

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Resistance Management:** Do not use the same insecticide repeatedly. Rotate between chemicals with different modes of action.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always observe the specified Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) mentioned on the insecticide label to ensure the produce is safe for consumption.
*   **Safety Precautions:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) like gloves, mask, and protective clothing while handling and spraying insecticides. Follow all instructions and safety guidelines provided on the product label.
*   **Spray Timing:** Spray during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
