As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an integrated approach to weed management in Sponge Gourd, combining cultural practices with judicious use of CIBRC approved herbicides.

**General Weed Management Principles:**

1.  **Field Preparation:** Ensure thorough land preparation to reduce initial weed seed bank.
2.  **Crop Rotation:** Rotate Sponge Gourd with non-host crops to break weed cycles.
3.  **Manual Weeding:** Timely manual weeding or hoeing, especially during the early stages of crop growth (up to 30-45 days after sowing), is highly effective and crucial for weed control in Sponge Gourd.
4.  **Mulching:** Using organic mulches can suppress weed growth.

**Chemical Weed Control in Sponge Gourd:**

Chemical control should be used as a supplementary measure. Always read the herbicide label carefully before application and follow all safety instructions.

**1. Pre-Emergence (PRE) Herbicides (for Broadleaf, Narrowleaf, Bathu, Congress grass, and partial suppression of Amarbail germination):**
These herbicides are applied to the soil surface after sowing but before the emergence of the crop and weeds.

*   **For Broadleaf Weeds, Narrowleaf Weeds (Grasses), Bathu, Congress grass, and Amarbail (germination suppression):**
    *   **Pendimethalin** 30% EC
        *   **Dosage:** 1.0-1.25 kg active ingredient per acre (equivalent to 3.3-4.1 L of product per acre)
        *   **Application:** Apply within 1-3 days after sowing/transplanting of Sponge Gourd to a moist soil surface. Ensure uniform coverage.
    *   **Fluchloralin** 45% EC
        *   **Dosage:** 0.675-0.9 kg active ingredient per acre (equivalent to 1.5-2.0 L of product per acre)
        *   **Application:** Apply as a pre-plant incorporation (PPI) herbicide, meaning it should be mixed into the top 2-5 cm of soil before sowing.

**2. Post-Emergence (POST) Herbicides (for Narrowleaf Weeds/Grasses including Phalaris minor):**
These herbicides are applied after the weeds have emerged. It is crucial to apply them when weeds are at an early growth stage (2-4 leaf stage) for best results.

*   **For Narrowleaf Weeds (Grasses) including Phalaris minor:**
    *   **Quizalofop-ethyl** 5% EC
        *   **Dosage:** 0.025-0.05 kg active ingredient per acre (equivalent to 0.5-1.0 L of product per acre)
        *   **Application:** Apply when grasses are at the 2-4 leaf stage. Ensure good coverage of the weeds.
    *   **Fluazifop-p-butyl** 13.4% EC
        *   **Dosage:** 0.125-0.25 kg active ingredient per acre (equivalent to 0.9-1.8 L of product per acre)
        *   **Application:** Apply when grasses are at the 2-4 leaf stage.

**Specific Weed Control Considerations:**

*   **Broadleaf Weeds (Bathu, Congress grass):**
    *   For established broadleaf weeds, there are **no specific CIBRC approved post-emergence herbicides safe for Sponge Gourd** that can selectively control them without harming the crop. Manual weeding remains the most effective method for post-emergence broadleaf weed control in Sponge Gourd. Pre-emergence herbicides like **Pendimethalin** are effective in preventing their germination.

*   **Amarbail (Cuscuta spp.):**
    *   Pre-emergence herbicides like **Pendimethalin** can offer some suppression of Amarbail seed germination.
    *   For established Amarbail, manual removal is the most effective method as there are **no selective post-emergence herbicides safe for Sponge Gourd** to control this parasitic weed directly without harming the crop. Prevention through clean seed, clean implements, and removal of host plants in surrounding areas is critical.

*   **Orobanche (Broomrape):**
    *   This is not a common or primary parasitic weed affecting Sponge Gourd in Haryana.
    *   There are **no specific CIBRC approved herbicides for *Sponge Gourd* to control Orobanche directly** without harming the crop. Management primarily relies on cultural practices, preventing its introduction, and using resistant varieties in susceptible crops.

**Important Notes:**

*   Always use the recommended water volume (typically 200-300 L per acre for herbicide application) for uniform spray coverage.
*   Ensure the soil is moist at the time of pre-emergence herbicide application for optimal efficacy.
*   Avoid spraying herbicides on windy days to prevent drift to non-target crops.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
