As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the specified conditions in Sponge Gourd in Haryana:

### Grasshopper Control in Sponge Gourd

Grasshoppers are polyphagous pests that can cause significant defoliation by feeding on leaves and tender parts of the Sponge Gourd plant.

*   **Cultural and Mechanical Methods:**
    *   Regular monitoring of fields, especially during early crop stages, to detect infestations.
    *   Hand-picking of nymphs and adults in small areas, particularly in the early morning when they are less active.
    *   Deep ploughing after harvest can expose grasshopper eggs laid in the soil, reducing future populations.
    *   Maintain field hygiene by removing weeds that can serve as alternate hosts.

*   **Chemical Control (if infestation is severe):**
    *   **Malathion** 50% EC at 1.0-1.5 L per acre (mixed in 200-400 L of water).
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 200-250 ml per acre (mixed in 200-400 L of water).
    *   **Cypermethrin** 25% EC at 200-250 ml per acre (mixed in 200-400 L of water).

### Painted Bug Control in Sponge Gourd

This is not known to affect Sponge Gourd. Painted bug (Bagrada hilaris) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops like mustard, cabbage, and cauliflower.

### Red Cotton Bug Control in Sponge Gourd

This is not known to affect Sponge Gourd. Red cotton bug (Dysdercus cingulatus) is primarily a pest of cotton and other malvaceous plants, feeding on developing seeds.

### Black Ants Control in Sponge Gourd

Black ants are generally not direct pests of Sponge Gourd by feeding on the plant itself. However, they can be problematic if they:
1.  Protect honeydew-producing pests (like aphids, mealybugs) from natural enemies, thus exacerbating sap-sucker infestations.
2.  Nest near the plant roots, potentially causing minor disturbance or damage.
3.  Carry away sown seeds.

*   **Management Strategy:**
    *   **Identify the primary issue:** If ants are protecting other pests, the primary focus should be on controlling those honeydew-producing pests.
    *   **Field Hygiene:** Keep the field free of weeds and debris that can provide shelter or alternative food sources for ants.
    *   **Physical Barriers:** In some specific situations, sticky bands can be applied to support structures to prevent ants from climbing plants.
    *   **Chemical Control (if necessary and targeted):**
        *   For ant nests causing direct issues or significant nuisance: Apply **Fipronil** 0.3% GR at 5-10 kg per acre, broadcast or applied around the base of affected plants or directly into nests.
        *   Alternatively, insecticidal baits containing **Fipronil** or **Hydramethylnon** can be strategically placed near ant trails or nests, away from direct contact with the crop, to target the ant colony.
