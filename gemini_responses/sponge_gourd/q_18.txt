As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified recommendations for the use of growth regulators and micronutrients in Sponge Gourd cultivation in Haryana:

### Recommended Doses of Growth Regulators/Hormones and Micronutrients in Sponge Gourd

1.  **Ethephon**
    *   **Purpose:** To promote the production of female flowers, which leads to an increased number of fruits and higher yields.
    *   **Recommended Dose:** Apply **Ethephon** (39% SL formulation) at a concentration of **0.3 - 0.6 ml per litre of water** (equivalent to approximately 125-250 ppm).
    *   **Timing:** The first spray should be given when the plant is at the 2-4 true leaf stage. A second spray can be applied 7-10 days after the first, if necessary, to further enhance female flower development.

2.  **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D)**
    *   **Recommendation:** **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid** is primarily a selective herbicide and is **not recommended** for use as a growth regulator in Sponge Gourd. Its application, even at very low concentrations, can lead to severe phytotoxicity, abnormal growth, and significant adverse effects on plant health and yield in cucurbits.

3.  **Boron**
    *   **Purpose:** Boron is an essential micronutrient crucial for pollen germination, fertilization, fruit set, and overall plant vigor. Its deficiency can lead to poor fruit development, reduced seed set, and lower yields.
    *   **Recommended Dose:** Apply **Boron** as a foliar spray at a concentration of **0.1% elemental Boron** (1 gram of elemental Boron per litre of water).
        *   If using **Sodium tetraborate decahydrate** (Borax, typically containing 11% elemental Boron): Mix **9-10 grams per litre of water**.
        *   If using a product with 20% elemental Boron (e.g., Solubor): Mix **5 grams per litre of water**.
    *   **Timing:** The first spray should be applied at the pre-flowering stage. A second spray can be given during early fruit development to support fruit growth and quality.
