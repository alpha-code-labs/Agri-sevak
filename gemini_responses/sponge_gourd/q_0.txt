As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Sponge Gourd (Luffa aegyptiaca/Luffa cylindrica) in Haryana.

It is crucial to adopt an Integrated Disease Management (IDM) approach, combining cultural practices, resistant varieties (if available), and judicious use of fungicides. Always ensure proper spray coverage and follow label instructions for dosage, safety, and pre-harvest intervals.

### Fungal Diseases Affecting Sponge Gourd and Their Control:

#### 1. Alternaria Leaf Spot (Alternaria cucumerina)
**Symptoms:** Small, circular, water-soaked spots appear on older leaves, which later enlarge, become angular, and turn brown with concentric rings (target-board appearance). Severe infection can lead to defoliation.

**Control Measures:**
*   **Cultural Practices:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris. Practice crop rotation with non-cucurbit crops. Ensure proper plant spacing for good air circulation.
*   **Chemical Control (Initiate sprays upon first symptom appearance, repeat at 7-10 day intervals):**
    *   **Mancozeb 75% WP:** 2-2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Chlorothalonil 75% WP:** 2 g/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:** 0.5-1 ml/L of water.
    *   **Tebuconazole 25.9% EC:** 0.75 ml/L of water.

#### 2. Anthracnose (Colletotrichum orbiculare)
**Symptoms:** Appears on leaves, stems, and fruits. Leaf spots are circular, water-soaked, turning brown to black, often with a yellow halo. On fruits, sunken, circular, black lesions develop, which may ooze pinkish spore masses in humid conditions.
**Control Measures:**
*   **Cultural Practices:** Use disease-free seeds. Practice crop rotation. Remove and destroy infected plant parts. Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day.
*   **Chemical Control (Initiate sprays upon first symptom appearance, repeat at 7-10 day intervals):**
    *   **Mancozeb 75% WP:** 2-2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Chlorothalonil 75% WP:** 2 g/L of water.
    *   **Carbendazim 50% WP:** 0.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:** 0.5-1 ml/L of water.
    *   **Propiconazole 25% EC:** 0.5 ml/L of water.

#### 3. Downy Mildew (Pseudoperonospora cubensis)
**Symptoms:** Yellow, angular spots appear on the upper surface of leaves, delimited by veins. On the corresponding lower surface, a purplish-brown, fuzzy growth (spores) can be seen, especially in humid conditions. Lesions coalesce, leading to leaf necrosis and defoliation.
**Control Measures:**
*   **Cultural Practices:** Use resistant varieties if available. Ensure good air circulation. Avoid overhead irrigation.
*   **Chemical Control (Preventive sprays are highly effective, especially during humid weather; repeat at 7-10 day intervals):**
    *   **Mancozeb 75% WP:** 2-2.5 g/L of water (for protection).
    *   **Chlorothalonil 75% WP:** 2 g/L of water (for protection).
    *   **Cymoxanil 8% + Mancozeb 64% WP:** 2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Dimethomorph 9% + Mancozeb 60% WP:** 2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Fenamidone 10% + Mancozeb 50% WG:** 3 g/L of water.
    *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride 72.2% SL:** 2-2.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:** 0.5-1 ml/L of water.

#### 4. Powdery Mildew (Podosphaera xanthii, Erysiphe cichoracearum)
**Symptoms:** White, powdery patches appear on the upper and lower surfaces of leaves, stems, and sometimes fruits. These patches enlarge and coalesce, covering entire leaves. Severely infected leaves turn yellow, become brittle, and may die prematurely.
**Control Measures:**
*   **Cultural Practices:** Use resistant varieties if available. Remove infected leaves.
*   **Chemical Control (Initiate sprays upon first symptom appearance, repeat at 7-10 day intervals):**
    *   **Sulphur 80% WDG/WP:** 2-3 g/L of water (effective at temperatures below 30°C).
    *   **Myclobutanil 10% WP:** 0.4-0.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Penconazole 10% EC:** 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Tebuconazole 25.9% EC:** 0.75 ml/L of water.
    *   **Difenoconazole 25% EC:** 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:** 0.5-1 ml/L of water.

#### 5. Blight (General Leaf Blight Symptoms)
"Blight" is a general term for rapid and extensive browning, death, and wilting of plant tissues. In sponge gourd, severe infections of Alternaria, Anthracnose, or Downy Mildew can manifest as blight-like symptoms.
**Control Measures:**
*   Follow the control measures for Alternaria Leaf Spot, Anthracnose, and Downy Mildew, as these are the most common causes of blight-like symptoms in sponge gourd. Broad-spectrum fungicides are generally effective.
    *   **Mancozeb 75% WP:** 2-2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Chlorothalonil 75% WP:** 2 g/L of water.
    *   **Copper Oxychloride 50% WP:** 2.5-3 g/L of water.

#### 6. Brown Spot (General Leaf Spot Symptoms)
"Brown spot" refers to a common symptom of various fungal infections causing brown lesions on leaves. While specific "Brown Spot Disease" is not a primary distinct disease of sponge gourd, various leaf spot pathogens can cause such symptoms.
**Control Measures:**
*   Follow the control measures for Alternaria Leaf Spot and Anthracnose, as these are common causes of brown spots on sponge gourd leaves.
    *   **Mancozeb 75% WP:** 2-2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Chlorothalonil 75% WP:** 2 g/L of water.
    *   **Propiconazole 25% EC:** 0.5 ml/L of water.

### Diseases Not Known to Affect Sponge Gourd:

*   **Blast:** This is not known to affect Sponge Gourd. Blast disease is primarily associated with cereal crops like rice.
*   **Grey Mildew:** This is not known to affect Sponge Gourd. Grey mildew is typically a disease of cotton.

**General Recommendations for Disease Management:**
*   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting cucurbits in the same field for at least 2-3 years.
*   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy all infected plant debris from the field.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available, choose sponge gourd varieties known to have resistance or tolerance to common diseases.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide adequate and balanced fertilizers to maintain plant vigor, as stressed plants are more susceptible to diseases.
*   **Water Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation, especially in the evening, to reduce leaf wetness duration, which favors fungal growth. Drip irrigation is preferred.
*   **Scouting:** Regularly monitor your crop for early signs of disease to enable timely intervention.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of fungicide resistance. Do not rely solely on one chemical group.
