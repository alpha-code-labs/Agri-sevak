Dear Farmer,

The "drying up" of branches, leaves, fruits, and flowers in Sponge Gourd is a serious symptom that can be caused by various factors, including diseases, pests, and environmental stresses. A careful observation of the specific symptoms is crucial for accurate diagnosis and effective management.

Here's how to address the potential causes:

### 1. Fungal Wilts (e.g., Fusarium Wilt)

*   **Symptoms:** Initial yellowing and wilting of leaves, often on one side of the plant or a single branch, progressing to the entire plant. The plant eventually dries up. Cutting the main stem near the base may reveal brownish discoloration in the vascular tissue.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Cultural Practices:**
        *   Practice crop rotation with non-cucurbit crops for at least 3-4 years.
        *   Use disease-free seeds.
        *   Maintain good field sanitation; remove and destroy infected plant debris.
        *   Improve soil drainage.
    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds before sowing with:
            *   **Carbendazim** (50% WP) at 2 g/kg seed.
            *   **Thiram** (75% WS) at 2.5 g/kg seed.
        *   **Soil Drenching (at early signs of wilting):**
            *   **Carbendazim** (50% WP) at 1-2 g/L water, drench around the base of affected plants.
            *   **Propiconazole** (25% EC) at 1 ml/L water, drench around the base of affected plants.

### 2. Bacterial Wilt

*   **Symptoms:** Sudden, rapid wilting of the entire plant without prior yellowing. A characteristic milky white ooze can be observed when a freshly cut stem is placed in water (bacterial streaming test).
*   **Management:**
    *   **Cultural Practices:**
        *   Practice strict crop rotation.
        *   Control insect vectors like cucumber beetles, which can spread the disease.
        *   Remove and destroy infected plants immediately.
    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   **Soil Drenching/Foliar Spray (at early stages):**
            *   A combination of **Streptomycin Sulphate** (9% SP) + **Tetracycline Hydrochloride** (1% SP) at 0.6 g/L water.
            *   **Copper Oxychloride** (50% WP) at 2.5 g/L water.

### 3. Gummy Stem Blight (*Didymella bryoniae*)

*   **Symptoms:** Water-soaked lesions on stems, leaves, and fruits, often with a characteristic reddish-brown gummy exudate on the stems. Stem lesions can girdle the stem, leading to wilting and drying of parts above the lesion.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Cultural Practices:**
        *   Use disease-free seeds.
        *   Practice crop rotation.
        *   Ensure proper plant spacing for good air circulation.
        *   Remove and destroy infected plant parts.
    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   **Foliar Spray:**
            *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC) at 0.5-1 ml/L water.
            *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2.5 g/L water.
            *   **Chlorothalonil** (75% WP) at 2 g/L water.

### 4. Root-knot Nematodes (*Meloidogyne* spp.)

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, yellowing, and wilting of plants, especially during hot periods, despite adequate water. Examination of roots will reveal characteristic galls or knots. These galls impair water and nutrient uptake, leading to drying.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Cultural Practices:**
        *   Practice crop rotation with non-host crops (e.g., marigold, maize, sorghum).
        *   Soil solarization during summer months can reduce nematode populations.
        *   Use resistant varieties if available.
    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   **Soil Application/Drenching:**
            *   **Fluopyram** (17.7% SC) at 1.5-2 ml/L water as a soil drench or drip application.
            *   **Fipronil** (5% SC) at 1-2 ml/L water as a soil drench around the root zone.

### 5. Stem Borers

*   **Symptoms:** Wilting of individual branches or the entire plant, often accompanied by visible boreholes on the stem and frass (excrement) near the entry point. The larvae tunnel inside the stem, disrupting water and nutrient flow.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Cultural Practices:**
        *   Regularly inspect plants for boreholes and frass.
        *   Remove and destroy infested plant parts or entire plants.
        *   Maintain field sanitation.
    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   **Foliar Spray/Drenching (targeting entry points):**
            *   **Chlorantraniliprole** (18.5% SC) at 0.3 ml/L water.
            *   **Emamectin Benzoate** (5% SG) at 0.5 g/L water.

### 6. Water Management Issues

*   **Drought Stress:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Gradual wilting, yellowing, and drying of leaves, starting from older leaves. Fruits may shrivel.
    *   **Management:** Ensure consistent and adequate irrigation, especially during flowering and fruiting stages. Use mulching to conserve soil moisture.
*   **Waterlogging (Excess Water):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Yellowing, wilting, and drying of leaves, often accompanied by root rot (roots turn black and mushy).
    *   **Management:** Ensure proper drainage in the field. Avoid over-irrigation. Plant on raised beds in areas prone to waterlogging.

### 7. Severe Heat Stress

*   **Symptoms:** Wilting during the hottest part of the day, leaf scorching, and flower/fruit drop, leading to overall plant decline and drying.
*   **Management:**
    *   Provide partial shade during peak summer months if feasible.
    *   Ensure adequate irrigation to help plants cope with heat.
    *   Maintain good soil health to improve plant resilience.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Accurate Diagnosis:** Carefully observe the specific symptoms (e.g., vascular discoloration, galls on roots, boreholes, gummy exudate) to identify the exact cause.
*   **Integrated Pest Management (IPM):** Always combine cultural practices with chemical control for sustainable and effective management.
*   **Safety:** Always read and follow the instructions on the chemical label regarding dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).

If you are unsure about the diagnosis, please collect a sample of the affected plant (including roots and stem) and bring it to the Department of Plant Pathology or Entomology at HAU, Hisar, for expert analysis.
