As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned conditions in Sponge Gourd (Luffa cylindrica) in Haryana.

### Control of Scab in Sponge Gourd

Scab in cucurbits is primarily caused by the fungus *Cladosporium cucumerinum*. It can affect leaves, stems, and fruits, leading to sunken lesions and sometimes a gummy exudate on fruits.

**Cultural Practices:**
*   Use resistant varieties if available.
*   Practice crop rotation with non-cucurbit crops for at least 2-3 years.
*   Ensure good field sanitation by removing and destroying infected plant debris.
*   Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day, to reduce leaf wetness.
*   Maintain proper plant spacing to improve air circulation.

**Chemical Control (Apply as foliar spray upon symptom appearance, repeat as per product label and disease pressure):**
*   **Mancozeb** at 2-2.5 g/L of water.
*   **Chlorothalonil** at 2 g/L of water.
*   **Copper oxychloride** at 2.5-3 g/L of water.

### Control of Canker and Gummosis in Sponge Gourd

Canker and Gummosis in Sponge Gourd are often symptoms of the same underlying disease, primarily Gummy Stem Blight, caused by the fungus *Didymella bryoniae* (also known as *Stagonosporopsis cucurbitacearum*). Cankers appear as water-soaked lesions on stems, often exuding amber-colored gum (gummosis).

**Cultural Practices:**
*   Use disease-free seeds or treat seeds with fungicides.
*   Practice crop rotation with non-cucurbit crops for at least 2-3 years.
*   Remove and destroy infected plant parts and crop residues promptly.
*   Avoid injuries to plants during cultivation, as wounds can be entry points for the pathogen.
*   Ensure good field drainage and avoid excessive humidity.

**Chemical Control (Apply as foliar spray upon symptom appearance, repeat as per product label and disease pressure):**
*   **Mancozeb** at 2-2.5 g/L of water.
*   **Chlorothalonil** at 2 g/L of water.
*   **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5-1 ml/L of water.
*   **Difenoconazole** at 0.5 ml/L of water.
*   A combination of **Carbendazim** (0.5 g/L) and **Mancozeb** (2 g/L) can also be effective.

### Control of Lichen in Sponge Gourd

This is not known to affect Sponge Gourd. Lichens are symbiotic organisms (fungus and alga) that typically grow on the surface of older stems, branches, or support structures. They are generally non-parasitic and do not directly harm the plant or reduce its yield. Their presence often indicates good air quality and can be found on slow-growing or less vigorous plants, but they are not a disease or pest of Sponge Gourd.

**General Advice:**
Always read and follow the instructions on the product label for specific dosage, application methods, and safety precautions. It is advisable to rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in pathogens. For any specific concerns or severe outbreaks, please consult with local agricultural extension specialists.
