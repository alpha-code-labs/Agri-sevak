As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling diseases in Marigold in Haryana:

**1. Dieback and Twig Blight in Marigold**

These conditions are often caused by various fungal pathogens (e.g., *Botrytis*, *Alternaria*, *Fusarium*) and can be exacerbated by environmental stress.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Regularly inspect plants and prune affected branches or twigs immediately, cutting well below the visible diseased area. Sterilize pruning tools with a 10% bleach solution or rubbing alcohol between cuts to prevent disease spread.
    *   Ensure proper plant spacing to improve air circulation and reduce humidity around the foliage.
    *   Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day, to keep foliage dry. Water at the base of the plants.
    *   Remove and destroy all fallen leaves and plant debris from around the plants to reduce inoculum sources.
    *   Maintain optimal soil drainage and avoid waterlogging.
    *   Provide balanced nutrition to enhance plant vigor and resistance.

*   **Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
    *   For preventive and early curative action, apply systemic or contact fungicides.
    *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: 0.5-1 g/L of water.
    *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP: 2-2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Propiconazole** 25% EC: 0.5-1 ml/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC: 0.5-1 ml/L of water.
    *   **Copper Oxychloride** 50% WP: 2.5-3 g/L of water.
    *   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development. Apply sprays at 10-15 day intervals, depending on disease severity and weather conditions.

**2. Tikka Disease in Marigold**

This is not known to affect Marigold. Tikka disease is a specific disease primarily affecting groundnut (*Arachis hypogaea*).
