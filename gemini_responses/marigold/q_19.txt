Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide you with scientifically verified advice on addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium/Potash) in Marigold for Haryana conditions.

Macronutrients Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K) are fundamental for the robust growth, prolific flowering, and overall yield of Marigold. Deficiencies in these nutrients can severely impact plant health and flower quality.

### Diagnosis of Macro-nutrient Deficiencies

Before applying any corrective measures, it's crucial to accurately diagnose the deficiency. While visual symptoms can be indicative, a soil test is the most reliable method.

*   **Nitrogen (N) Deficiency:**
    *   General yellowing (chlorosis) of older leaves, starting from the tips and margins.
    *   Stunted plant growth with thin, weak stems.
    *   Reduced number and size of flowers.
*   **Phosphorus (P) Deficiency:**
    *   Purplish discoloration on the underside of older leaves and stems.
    *   Severely stunted growth and poor root development.
    *   Delayed flowering and reduced flower production.
*   **Potassium (K) Deficiency:**
    *   Yellowing and browning (scorching) of leaf margins, particularly on older leaves.
    *   Weak stems, leading to increased susceptibility to lodging and diseases.
    *   Poor flower quality and reduced post-harvest shelf life.

### Correction Strategies

**Crucial Step:** Always conduct a soil test through a reputable laboratory (like HAU's soil testing lab) to determine the precise nutrient status of your field. The following recommendations are general guidelines; adjust dosages based on your specific soil test results.

#### 1. Soil Application (Primary Method)

Soil application is the most effective way to correct long-term deficiencies and build up soil nutrient reserves.

*   **For Nitrogen (N) Deficiency:**
    *   Apply **Urea** at 50-75 kg/acre. This should be applied in split doses: for example, 1/3 at planting, 1/3 at 30 days after transplanting (DAT), and the remaining 1/3 at 60 DAT.
    *   If **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** is used for phosphorus, adjust the **Urea** quantity accordingly as DAP also contains nitrogen.
*   **For Phosphorus (P) Deficiency:**
    *   Apply **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** at 150-200 kg/acre as a basal application before planting or at the time of planting.
    *   Alternatively, **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** at 50-75 kg/acre can be applied as a basal dose.
*   **For Potassium (K) Deficiency:**
    *   Apply **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** at 40-60 kg/acre. This can be applied as a basal dose or in two split doses (e.g., 1/2 at planting, 1/2 at 30-45 DAT).

#### 2. Foliar Application (For Quick Correction and Supplementation)

Foliar sprays offer a rapid way to supply nutrients and are particularly useful for immediate correction of visible deficiencies or to supplement soil applications during critical growth stages.

*   **For Nitrogen (N) Deficiency:**
    *   Spray **Urea** solution at 5-10 g/L of water (0.5-1.0% solution). Repeat every 7-10 days if symptoms persist.
*   **For Phosphorus (P) Deficiency:**
    *   Spray **Monoammonium Phosphate (MAP)** (12:61:0) at 5-10 g/L of water (0.5-1.0% solution).
    *   Alternatively, **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** at 2.5-5 g/L of water (0.25-0.5% solution).
*   **For Potassium (K) Deficiency:**
    *   Spray **Potassium Nitrate** (13:0:45) at 5-10 g/L of water (0.5-1.0% solution).
    *   Alternatively, **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** at 2.5-5 g/L of water (0.25-0.5% solution).

### Important Considerations

*   **Soil Testing is Paramount:** The most accurate and economical way to manage nutrient deficiencies is through regular soil testing. This provides precise recommendations tailored to your field's specific needs, preventing over- or under-application.
*   **Balanced Fertilization:** Always aim for balanced nutrient application. Excessive application of one nutrient can induce deficiencies of others or lead to nutrient imbalances.
*   **Timing of Application:** Apply fertilizers at the appropriate growth stages for maximum efficiency and uptake by the plants.
*   **Irrigation:** Ensure adequate soil moisture after applying granular fertilizers to facilitate their dissolution and uptake by the roots.
*   **Foliar Spray Best Practices:** Apply foliar sprays during the cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to prevent leaf scorching and maximize nutrient absorption. Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.

By following these guidelines and prioritizing soil testing, you can effectively manage macro-nutrient deficiencies in your Marigold crop, leading to healthier plants and higher yields.
