As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide scientifically verified advice for managing rot diseases in Marigold in Haryana.

Marigold plants are susceptible to various rot types, primarily caused by soil-borne fungal pathogens, especially during periods of high humidity and poor drainage. These include Root Rot, Stem Rot, Foot Rot, Collar Rot, Crown Rot, Neck Rot, Seed Rot, and Seedling Rot (Damping-off).

However, it is important to clarify the following:
*   **Black Rot:** This is not known to affect Marigold. It is primarily a bacterial disease of cruciferous crops.
*   **Fruit Rot:** Marigold produces flower heads (capitula), not botanical fruits. While the flower heads can rot due to general fungal infections, "Fruit Rot" as a distinct disease is not known to affect Marigold.

For the control of Root, Stem, Foot, Collar, Crown, Neck, Seed, and Seedling rot in Marigold, an integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods is most effective.

### Integrated Management Strategies for Rot Diseases in Marigold:

**1. Cultural Practices (Preventive Measures):**

*   **Site Selection and Soil Preparation:**
    *   Choose well-drained fields. Avoid low-lying areas where water can accumulate.
    *   Improve soil drainage by incorporating organic matter like well-rotted farmyard manure.
    *   Solarize the soil during hot summer months (May-June) for 4-6 weeks by covering moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets. This helps reduce pathogen load.
*   **Crop Rotation:**
    *   Avoid planting Marigold in the same field year after year. Rotate with non-host crops for at least 2-3 years.
*   **Seed Selection:**
    *   Use healthy, certified seeds from reputable sources.
*   **Planting Density:**
    *   Maintain optimal plant spacing to ensure good air circulation and reduce humidity around the plant base.
*   **Irrigation Management:**
    *   Avoid overwatering, especially during cool, cloudy weather.
    *   Water early in the morning to allow foliage to dry before evening.
    *   Use drip irrigation if possible, to deliver water directly to the root zone and keep foliage dry.
*   **Sanitation:**
    *   Promptly remove and destroy infected plant debris (leaves, stems, roots) from the field to prevent the spread of pathogens.
    *   Sterilize tools and equipment used in infected areas.

**2. Biological Control:**

*   **Seed Treatment:**
    *   Treat seeds with bio-fungicides before sowing.
    *   **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum**: 4-5 g/kg seed.
    *   **Pseudomonas fluorescens**: 10 g/kg seed.
*   **Soil Application/Drench:**
    *   Apply **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum** (2.5 kg/acre) mixed with 50 kg of well-decomposed farmyard manure or compost, and apply to the soil before planting or as a drench around the base of established plants.
    *   **Pseudomonas fluorescens** (2.5 kg/acre) can also be applied similarly.

**3. Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved Technical Chemicals):**

**A. For Seed Rot and Seedling Rot (Damping-off):**
*   **Seed Treatment:**
    *   **Thiram** 2-3 g/kg seed.
    *   **Carbendazim 12% + Mancozeb 63% WP** 2-3 g/kg seed.
    *   **Metalaxyl-M 31.8% ES** 3-4 ml/kg seed (especially effective against *Pythium* and *Phytophthora*).

**B. For Root, Stem, Foot, Collar, Crown, and Neck Rots (Soil Drench):**
*   **At planting/transplanting:** Drench the soil around the base of seedlings immediately after transplanting.
*   **For established plants:** Drench the soil around the base of affected plants. Ensure sufficient solution reaches the root zone.
*   **Fungicides for Drenching:**
    *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride** (72.2% SL): 2-3 ml/L water. (Effective against *Pythium* and *Phytophthora*).
    *   **Carbendazim** (50% WP): 1-2 g/L water. (Effective against *Rhizoctonia* and *Sclerotium*).
    *   **Thiophanate-methyl** (70% WP): 1-1.5 g/L water. (Systemic, broad-spectrum activity).
    *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC): 1 ml/L water. (Broad-spectrum, systemic).

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the manufacturer's instructions on the label for dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in pathogens.
*   Early detection and intervention are crucial for effective management of rot diseases.
