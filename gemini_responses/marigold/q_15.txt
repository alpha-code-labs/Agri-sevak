As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Marigold in Haryana:

Here's how to manage the specified pests:

**1. Grasshopper**
Grasshoppers are generalist feeders and can cause damage to Marigold foliage.

*   **Cultural/Mechanical Control:**
    *   For small infestations, hand-picking and destroying grasshoppers can be effective.
    *   Keep the area around the Marigold plants free of weeds, which can harbor grasshoppers.
*   **Chemical Control (if infestation is severe):**
    *   **Malathion** 50 EC: Apply at a rate of 2 ml/L of water, or 1.0-1.5 L/acre as a foliar spray.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5 EC: Apply at a rate of 1 ml/L of water, or 0.5 L/acre as a foliar spray.

**2. Painted bug**
This is not known to affect Marigold.

**3. Red cotton bug**
This is not known to affect Marigold.

**4. Black ants**
Black ants are often secondary pests in Marigold. They are typically attracted to the honeydew secreted by sap-sucking insects like aphids, mealybugs, or whiteflies. While ants themselves do not directly damage the Marigold plant significantly, they can protect these sap-sucking pests from natural enemies, thus exacerbating the primary pest problem.

*   **Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Ants:**
    *   **Control Primary Pests:** The most effective way to manage ants is to control the primary sap-sucking pests that produce honeydew. Once the source of honeydew is removed, the ants will naturally disperse.
    *   **Sanitation:** Remove any plant debris or fallen flowers that might attract ants.
*   **Chemical Control (if ants are a direct nuisance or protecting other pests extensively):**
    *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20 EC: Apply at a rate of 2.5 ml/L of water as a drench around the base of the plants or along ant trails. Avoid direct spraying on flowers.
    *   **Fipronil** 0.3 GR: Apply as granules at a rate of 10-15 kg/acre around the base of the plants.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and strictly follow the instructions and safety precautions on the label of any pesticide product.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during application.
*   Apply pesticides during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   Consider the impact on beneficial insects and pollinators, especially when Marigold is in bloom.
