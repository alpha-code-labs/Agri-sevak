Namaste! The "drying up" symptom in Marigold, affecting branches, leaves, fruits, and flowers, is a general indication of significant stress or disease. As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can tell you that accurate diagnosis is the first and most crucial step, as the management strategy will vary depending on the underlying cause.

Here are the common causes and recommended approaches for addressing drying up in Marigold in Haryana:

**1. Diagnosis - Observe Carefully:**

Before applying any treatment, carefully observe the following:
*   **Pattern of Drying:** Is it sudden or gradual? Does it start from the bottom leaves upwards, or affect random branches? Is it localized to a few plants or widespread?
*   **Root Health:** Gently dig around the base of an affected plant. Are the roots healthy white, or are they discolored (brown/black), soft, mushy, or showing galls (swellings)?
*   **Stem Base:** Check the stem at the soil line. Are there any lesions, discoloration, rotting, or cankers?
*   **Vascular Tissue:** Cut a stem longitudinally. Is the internal tissue discolored (brownish streaks)? This indicates vascular wilt.
*   **Soil Moisture:** Is the soil consistently waterlogged, or is it too dry? Both extremes can cause wilting and drying.
*   **Pest Presence:** While less likely to cause widespread drying of branches, severe infestations of sap-sucking pests (e.g., mites, thrips) can lead to leaf desiccation.

**2. Common Causes and Management Strategies:**

Based on your observations, the drying up could be due to one or more of the following:

**A. Fungal Wilts (e.g., Fusarium Wilt, Verticillium Wilt)**
*   **Symptoms:** Gradual yellowing and wilting of leaves, often starting from the lower leaves and progressing upwards. One side of the plant may show symptoms first. Stems, when cut, may show brown discoloration in the vascular tissue. Eventually, the entire plant dries up.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Cultural:** Use resistant varieties if available. Practice crop rotation with non-host crops for at least 3-4 years. Remove and destroy infected plants immediately to prevent spread. Maintain good field sanitation. Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can make plants more susceptible.
    *   **Chemical (Soil Drench):**
        *   **Carbendazim** @ 1 g/L of water.
        *   **Thiophanate-methyl** @ 1 g/L of water.
        *   Apply as a drench around the base of the plant (200-300 ml per plant) as soon as initial symptoms are observed. Repeat after 10-15 days if necessary.

**B. Root Rot / Collar Rot (e.g., Phytophthora, Rhizoctonia)**
*   **Symptoms:** Sudden wilting, yellowing, and collapse of the entire plant. Dark, water-soaked lesions at the collar region (stem base at soil level) or rotted, mushy roots.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Cultural:** Ensure excellent soil drainage. Avoid waterlogging. Plant on raised beds if soil drainage is poor. Use disease-free planting material. Avoid deep planting.
    *   **Chemical (Soil Drench):**
        *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride** @ 2-3 ml/L of water.
        *   **Metalaxyl + Mancozeb** (combination product) @ 2-2.5 g/L of water.
        *   Drench the soil around the base of the plants (200-300 ml per plant) immediately upon noticing symptoms.

**C. Blight / Leaf Spot Diseases (e.g., Alternaria Blight)**
*   **Symptoms:** Dark, concentric spots on leaves, stems, and flowers, which enlarge and coalesce, leading to drying and defoliation. In severe cases, entire branches and flowers can dry up.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Cultural:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris. Ensure proper plant spacing for good air circulation. Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day.
    *   **Chemical (Foliar Spray):**
        *   **Mancozeb** @ 2-2.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Chlorothalonil** @ 2 g/L of water.
        *   **Azoxystrobin** @ 0.5-1 ml/L of water.
        *   Spray thoroughly covering all plant parts. Repeat at 7-10 day intervals depending on disease severity.

**D. Root-Knot Nematodes**
*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, yellowing, wilting, and drying of leaves despite adequate water and nutrients. Poor flowering. The most definitive symptom is the presence of galls (swellings) on the roots. Nematode damage impairs water and nutrient uptake, leading to drought-like symptoms.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Cultural:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops (e.g., cereals like maize, sorghum). Soil solarization during hot summer months can significantly reduce nematode populations. Use resistant varieties if available. Incorporate organic matter (e.g., neem cake @ 200 kg/acre) into the soil before planting.
    *   **Chemical:** Chemical control for nematodes is complex and often involves pre-plant soil treatment. For existing plants, it's challenging. If nematode infestation is confirmed, consult with HAU experts for specific recommendations on CIBRC-approved nematicides and their application methods, as these can be highly specific and require careful handling.

**E. Abiotic Stress (Water Stress, Heat Stress)**
*   **Symptoms:**
    *   **Drought Stress:** Leaves wilt, turn yellow/brown, and dry up. Plant growth is stunted.
    *   **Waterlogging:** Roots suffocate and rot, leading to wilting, yellowing, and drying of the entire plant, mimicking drought symptoms.
    *   **Heat Stress:** Leaves may scorch, turn brown, and dry, especially during extreme heat waves.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Irrigation:** Maintain consistent soil moisture. Irrigate deeply but infrequently, allowing the topsoil to dry slightly between waterings. Avoid both drought and waterlogging.
    *   **Mulching:** Apply a layer of organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves) around the plants to conserve soil moisture, regulate soil temperature, and suppress weeds.
    *   **Shade:** During extreme summer heat, consider providing temporary shade to young plants.

**General Recommendations:**

*   **Sanitation:** Always remove and destroy diseased plant material to prevent the spread of pathogens.
*   **Certified Seeds/Seedlings:** Use only healthy, certified disease-free seeds or seedlings from reputable sources.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure plants receive balanced nutrition. Over-fertilization, especially with nitrogen, can make plants more susceptible to diseases.
*   **Soil Health:** Improve soil structure and drainage by incorporating organic matter.

For precise identification and tailored advice, it is always recommended to bring a sample of the affected plant to the Plant Pathology or Horticulture Department at HAU, Hisar, or your nearest Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK).
