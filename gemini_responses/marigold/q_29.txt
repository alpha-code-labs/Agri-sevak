As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding "dropping" in Marigold for Haryana conditions:

Firstly, it is important to clarify the terminology for Marigold:
*   **Flower drop:** This is a common issue in Marigold, where flowers abscise prematurely, leading to reduced yield.
*   **Fruit drop:** Marigold produces dry fruits called achenes (which contain the seeds), not fleshy fruits in the common horticultural sense. Premature dropping of developing achenes can occur, which is often linked to the same factors causing flower drop.
*   **Tinda/Boll dropping:** This is not known to affect Marigold. Tinda is a gourd crop, and boll dropping is specific to cotton.

Therefore, the primary concern for Marigold is **flower drop** (which encompasses the dropping of developing seed heads/achenes).

**Causes of Flower Drop in Marigold:**
Flower drop in Marigold can be attributed to a combination of environmental, nutritional, and physiological factors:
*   **Environmental Stress:** High temperatures, sudden temperature fluctuations, water stress (both drought and waterlogging), and high humidity.
*   **Nutrient Deficiencies:** Lack of essential micronutrients like Boron and Calcium, or macronutrients like Phosphorus and Potassium.
*   **Hormonal Imbalance:** An imbalance between growth-promoting hormones (auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins) and abscission-promoting hormones (abscisic acid, ethylene).
*   **Pest and Disease Infestations:** Severe infestations of sucking pests (e.g., thrips, mites) or diseases can weaken the plant, leading to flower drop.
*   **Excessive Nitrogen:** Over-application of nitrogen can promote vegetative growth at the expense of flowering and sometimes lead to flower drop.

**Control Measures for Flower Drop in Marigold:**

To effectively manage flower drop, an integrated approach combining cultural practices, nutrient management, and judicious use of plant growth regulators is recommended:

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Optimal Watering:** Ensure consistent and adequate soil moisture. Avoid both waterlogging and severe drought stress, especially during flowering.
*   **Weed Management:** Keep the field free of weeds to reduce competition for water and nutrients.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Maintain recommended plant spacing to ensure good air circulation and reduce stress.
*   **Timely Planting:** Plant Marigold varieties at their optimal time to avoid extreme temperatures during critical growth stages.

**2. Nutrient Management:**
*   **Balanced Fertilization:** Apply fertilizers based on soil test recommendations. Avoid excessive nitrogen. Ensure adequate supply of Phosphorus and Potassium.
*   **Foliar Application of Micronutrients:**
    *   **Boron:** Apply **disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** at 1-2 g/L of water (0.1-0.2% solution) as a foliar spray at the bud initiation stage and again 15 days later.
    *   **Calcium:** Apply **calcium nitrate** at 5-10 g/L of water (0.5-1% solution) as a foliar spray during flowering.
    *   **Potassium:** Apply **potassium nitrate** or **mono potassium phosphate** at 5-10 g/L of water (0.5-1% solution) as a foliar spray during flowering.

**3. Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs):**
*   **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA):** This synthetic auxin is effective in reducing flower drop by delaying abscission.
    *   Apply **naphthalene acetic acid** (4.5% SL formulation) at 0.2-0.4 ml/L of water (equivalent to 10-20 ppm) as a foliar spray at the bud initiation stage and again 15 days later. Ensure thorough coverage.

**4. Pest and Disease Management:**
*   Regularly monitor the crop for pests and diseases. Implement appropriate control measures as per HAU recommendations to keep the plants healthy and vigorous, thereby indirectly reducing stress-induced flower drop. For sucking pests, consider insecticides like **imidacloprid** or **thiamethoxam** if infestations are severe, following recommended dosages.

By implementing these measures, Marigold growers in Haryana can significantly reduce flower drop and improve overall flower yield. Always ensure to read and follow the instructions on the product labels for safe and effective use.
