As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified seed and soil treatment processes for Marigold cultivation in Haryana:

### Seed Treatment Process for Marigold

Seed treatment is crucial for protecting young Marigold seedlings from seed-borne and early soil-borne diseases, as well as initial insect pest attacks, ensuring better germination and stand establishment.

*   **For Fungal Diseases (e.g., Damping-off, Seed Rot):**
    *   Treat Marigold seeds with **Carbendazim** at 1.0 gram per kg of seed.
    *   Alternatively, use **Thiram** at 2.0 grams per kg of seed.
    *   For broader spectrum protection, a combination product containing **Carbendazim + Thiram** can be used at 2.0-3.0 grams per kg of seed, as per manufacturer's instructions.
*   **For Early Sucking Pests (e.g., Aphids, Thrips):**
    *   Treat Marigold seeds with **Imidacloprid** 70 WS at 5-7 grams per kg of seed. This provides systemic protection to the seedlings during their initial growth phase.

**Method:** Mix the recommended quantity of the chemical thoroughly with the seeds in a suitable container or seed treating drum until all seeds are uniformly coated. Allow the seeds to dry slightly in the shade before sowing.

### Soil Treatment Process for Marigold

Soil treatment aims to manage soil-borne diseases, nematodes, and soil insect pests that can significantly impact Marigold growth and yield. This is typically done during land preparation or at the time of transplanting.

*   **For Soil-borne Fungal Diseases (e.g., Damping-off, Root Rot):**
    *   **Biological Control:** Incorporate **Trichoderma viride** (a bio-fungicide) into the soil at 2.5 kg per acre. Mix it thoroughly with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost and broadcast evenly over the field, incorporating it into the soil 10-15 days before transplanting.
    *   **Chemical Control (if severe disease history):** Drench the soil around the base of the seedlings with a solution of **Propamocarb hydrochloride** at 2-3 ml per litre of water, immediately after transplanting or at the first sign of disease.
*   **For Nematodes (e.g., Root-knot nematodes):**
    *   **Biological Control:** Apply **Paecilomyces lilacinus** (a bio-nematicide) at 2.5 kg per acre, mixed with 50-100 kg of FYM, and incorporate into the soil 10-15 days before transplanting.
    *   **Chemical Control (if severe infestation is confirmed):** Apply **Fluensulfone** 2% GR at 10 kg per acre as a broadcast application and incorporate into the soil during the final land preparation before transplanting.
*   **For Soil Insect Pests (e.g., White Grubs, Termites):**
    *   If there is a known history of these pests, apply **Fipronil** 0.3% GR at 8-10 kg per acre as a broadcast application and incorporate into the soil during the final land preparation.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) while handling chemicals.
*   Follow the specific instructions and safety precautions provided on the product labels.
*   Ensure proper soil moisture for effective action of both biological and chemical treatments.
*   Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural practices, biological control, and judicious use of chemicals, is always recommended for sustainable Marigold cultivation.
