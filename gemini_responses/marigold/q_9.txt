Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling Red Spider Mites and Rust Mites in Marigold cultivation in Haryana.

Mites, particularly Red Spider Mites (*Tetranychus urticae*) and various species of Rust Mites (Eriophyidae family), can cause significant damage to Marigold, leading to stunted growth, discolored leaves, and reduced flower yield. An integrated pest management (IPM) approach is recommended for effective and sustainable control.

### Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Mites in Marigold:

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Water Management:** Overhead irrigation or strong water sprays can physically dislodge mites from the plant foliage, especially on the undersides of leaves.
*   **Weed Control:** Remove weeds around the Marigold plants as they can act as alternate hosts for mites.
*   **Pruning:** Regularly inspect plants and prune off heavily infested leaves or plant parts to reduce mite populations.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, as it can promote lush, soft growth that is more attractive to mites. Maintain balanced nutrition.
*   **Crop Rotation:** If possible, rotate Marigold with non-host crops to break the mite life cycle in the soil.

**2. Biological Control:**
*   **Predatory Mites:** Introduce natural enemies like predatory mites (*Amblyseius* spp. or *Phytoseiulus persimilis*) which feed on pest mites. Availability may vary, but they are an excellent option for sustainable control.
*   **Insecticidal Soaps/Neem Oil:** For early infestations, sprays of insecticidal soaps or **Azadirachtin** (Neem oil formulations) can be effective. Apply thoroughly, especially on the undersides of leaves.

**3. Chemical Control (Acaricides):**
When mite populations are high and cultural/biological methods are insufficient, chemical control becomes necessary. Always rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where mites reside.

Here are some CIBRC approved technical chemical names for mite control in Marigold:

*   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** Apply at a concentration of **0.5 - 1 ml/L** of water. This is effective against all life stages of spider mites.
*   **Propargite 57% EC:** Apply at a concentration of **1.5 - 2 ml/L** of water. This is a contact acaricide effective against various mite species.
*   **Abamectin 1.9% EC:** Apply at a concentration of **0.5 - 0.75 ml/L** of water. It has translaminar action and is effective against spider mites and some rust mites.
*   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP:** Apply at a concentration of **2 - 3 g/L** of water. Sulphur is effective against rust mites and also provides some control against spider mites and powdery mildew. Avoid spraying during very hot weather (above 30-32°C) as it can cause phytotoxicity.
*   **Fenpyroximate 5% EC:** Apply at a concentration of **0.5 - 1 ml/L** of water. This is a broad-spectrum acaricide effective against various mite species.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Rotation:** Always rotate between different groups of acaricides (with different modes of action) to prevent mites from developing resistance.
*   **Timing:** Spray in the early morning or late evening to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure complete coverage of the plant, especially the undersides of leaves, where mites are most prevalent.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, mask, and protective clothing while handling and spraying pesticides. Follow the instructions and safety precautions mentioned on the product label.
*   **Re-application:** Mites have a short life cycle. Repeat application may be necessary after 7-10 days, depending on the severity of infestation and the specific product used.
