As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following cultivation practices for Marigold in Haryana:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   Marigold is primarily propagated through seeds. The most common and recommended method is to raise seedlings in a nursery and then transplant them to the main field. This ensures better establishment, uniform stand, and allows for better management of young plants.
    *   Seeds are sown in well-prepared nursery beds or trays.
    *   Seedlings are ready for transplanting when they are 4-6 weeks old or have developed 4-5 true leaves.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   **For Seeds (in nursery):** Sow seeds shallowly at a depth of **0.5 - 1 cm**.
    *   **For Transplanting (in main field):** Plant the seedlings at the same depth they were growing in the nursery to avoid stem rot or drying out.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   Spacing varies depending on the Marigold type (African or French) and the desired plant size/flower yield.
    *   **African Marigold (Tagetes erecta):**
        *   Row to Row: **45 - 60 cm**
        *   Plant to Plant: **30 - 45 cm**
    *   **French Marigold (Tagetes patula):**
        *   Row to Row: **30 - 45 cm**
        *   Plant to Plant: **20 - 30 cm**

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   The seed rate is calculated for raising seedlings sufficient to transplant one acre.
    *   **African Marigold:** **400 - 500 g/acre**
    *   **French Marigold:** **200 - 300 g/acre**
