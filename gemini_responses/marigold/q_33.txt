As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an integrated approach to weed management in Marigold, combining cultural practices with judicious use of CIBRC-approved herbicides.

Weed control is crucial in Marigold cultivation as weeds compete for nutrients, water, and sunlight, significantly reducing yield and quality.

**Integrated Weed Management Strategy for Marigold:**

1.  **Cultural Practices (Foundation of Weed Control):**
    *   **Field Preparation:** Ensure thorough ploughing and harrowing to uproot and expose weed seeds to the sun, reducing their viability.
    *   **Timely Sowing/Transplanting:** Establish a healthy crop stand quickly to outcompete weeds.
    *   **Hand Weeding/Intercultivation:** This remains the most effective method for broadleaf weeds and parasitic weeds like Amarbail, especially in ornamental crops where selective post-emergence herbicides are limited. Perform 2-3 hand weedings, typically at 20-25 and 40-45 days after transplanting/sowing.
    *   **Mulching:** Using organic mulches (straw, dry leaves) can suppress weed growth by blocking sunlight and conserving soil moisture.

2.  **Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved Herbicides):**

    **A. Pre-emergence Herbicides (Applied before weed emergence):**
    These herbicides are applied to the soil surface within 1-3 days of transplanting or sowing Marigold seeds, before weeds emerge. Ensure adequate soil moisture for optimal efficacy.

    *   **For Broadleaf Weeds (Bathu, Congress grass, etc.) and Narrowleaf Weeds (Phalaris minor, etc.):**
        *   **Pendimethalin** (30% EC formulation): Apply 3.3 litres per acre in 200-300 litres of water.
            *   *Application:* Spray evenly on the soil surface immediately after transplanting Marigold seedlings or within 3 days of sowing seeds.

    **B. Post-emergence Herbicides (Applied after weed emergence):**
    These herbicides are selective for grassy weeds and are applied when weeds are in their 2-4 leaf stage and actively growing.

    *   **For Narrowleaf Weeds (Phalaris minor, other grasses):**
        *   **Quizalofop-ethyl** (10% EC formulation): Apply 500 ml per acre in 200-300 litres of water.
            *   *Application:* Spray when grassy weeds are at the 2-4 leaf stage.
        *   **Fenoxaprop-p-ethyl** (9% EC formulation): Apply 550-650 ml per acre in 200-300 litres of water.
            *   *Application:* Spray when grassy weeds are at the 2-4 leaf stage.

    **C. Specific Weed Control:**

    *   **Amarbail (Cuscuta spp.):**
        *   **Prevention is key.** The pre-emergence application of **Pendimethalin** can help suppress the germination of Amarbail seeds.
        *   Once Amarbail is observed, immediate manual removal is critical. Carefully remove the affected Marigold plants or the parasitic strands before they spread. Burn or dispose of the removed Amarbail away from the field to prevent re-infestation.
        *   Avoid using contaminated farm machinery or irrigation water.

    *   **Bathu (Chenopodium album) and Congress grass (Parthenium hysterophorus):**
        *   These are broadleaf weeds. **Pendimethalin** (pre-emergence) will provide initial control.
        *   For post-emergence control of these broadleaf weeds, selective herbicides safe for Marigold are very limited. **Hand weeding and intercultivation are the most effective and recommended methods** once these weeds have emerged.

    *   **Orobanche (Broomrape):**
        *   This is not known to affect Marigold. Marigold (Tagetes spp.) is generally not a host for Orobanche.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Always read the label:** Before using any herbicide, carefully read and follow the instructions on the product label regarding dosage, application method, safety precautions, and waiting periods.
*   **Calibration:** Ensure your sprayer is properly calibrated to apply the correct dose uniformly.
*   **Weather Conditions:** Apply herbicides during calm weather, avoiding windy conditions to prevent drift. Ensure no rain is expected for at least 4-6 hours after application.
*   **Crop Stage:** Adhere strictly to the recommended crop stage for herbicide application to avoid phytotoxicity.
*   **Rotation:** Practice crop rotation to manage weed populations effectively over time.
