As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following doses of organic manures for Marigold cultivation to enhance soil health, nutrient availability, and overall plant growth and flowering:

It is always advisable to conduct a soil test to determine the specific nutrient deficiencies and tailor the manure application accordingly. However, based on general recommendations for Marigold in Haryana, the following can be applied:

*   **Farm Yard Manure (FYM):**
    *   Apply **10-15 tonnes per acre** (approximately 25-37.5 tonnes per hectare) during land preparation, about 2-3 weeks before transplanting. Ensure the FYM is well-decomposed.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   Apply **4-5 tonnes per acre** (approximately 10-12.5 tonnes per hectare) during land preparation, either as a sole organic amendment or in combination with a reduced quantity of FYM.
    *   Alternatively, for established plants, a top dressing of **200-300 g per plant** can be done at the time of flowering initiation.

*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract based liquid fertilizer):**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Mix **2-4 ml of Sagarika per liter of water** and spray evenly on the foliage.
        *   First spray: 20-25 days after transplanting.
        *   Second spray: At the time of bud initiation.
        *   Third spray: During peak flowering stage.
    *   **Soil Drench/Drip Application:** Apply **500 ml to 1 liter of Sagarika per acre** diluted in sufficient water, preferably during irrigation, at critical growth stages (e.g., vegetative growth, bud initiation, and flowering).

These recommendations aim to provide a balanced supply of macro and micronutrients, improve soil structure, and enhance microbial activity, leading to robust Marigold plants and abundant blooms.
