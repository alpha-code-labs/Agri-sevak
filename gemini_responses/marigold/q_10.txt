Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an integrated approach for managing pests in Marigold, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods for sustainable and effective control.

Here's the advice for the pests you've mentioned:

### General Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Principles for Marigold:
*   **Regular Scouting:** Frequently inspect your Marigold plants for early signs of pest infestation.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy affected plant parts, fallen leaves, and weeds that can harbor pests.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation to break pest cycles.
*   **Encourage Natural Enemies:** Avoid broad-spectrum pesticides unnecessarily, as they can harm beneficial insects that prey on pests.

### Specific Pest Management:

#### 1. Borers, Caterpillars, and Leaf folders

These lepidopteran pests often cause similar types of damage and can be managed with similar strategies.

*   **Symptoms:**
    *   **Borers:** Wilting of shoots, presence of holes in stems or flower buds, and frass (excrement) near the entry points.
    *   **Caterpillars:** Chewed leaves, defoliation, holes in flowers, and the visible presence of larvae.
    *   **Leaf folders:** Leaves folded or rolled and tied with silken threads, with larvae feeding inside, leading to skeletonized leaves.

*   **Management Strategies:**
    *   **Cultural Control:**
        *   Regularly monitor your crop for early detection of larvae or folded leaves.
        *   In small infestations, hand-pick and destroy visible larvae and folded leaves.
        *   Remove weeds from around the field, as they can serve as alternate hosts for these pests.
    *   **Biological Control:**
        *   Conserve and encourage natural enemies such as parasitic wasps (e.g., *Trichogramma* spp.) and predatory bugs.
        *   For early instar larvae, apply **Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki** (Bt) at a rate of 1-2 g per litre of water (or 500-1000 g per acre). Apply in the evening for best results.
    *   **Chemical Control (if infestation is severe and crosses economic threshold levels):**
        *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** 0.3 ml per litre of water (or 60 ml per acre).
        *   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG:** 0.25 g per litre of water (or 100 g per acre).
        *   **Flubendiamide 20% WG:** 0.25 g per litre of water (or 125 g per acre).
        *   **Indoxacarb 14.5% SC:** 0.5 ml per litre of water (or 200 ml per acre).
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** 0.5 ml per litre of water (or 200 ml per acre) for quick knockdown, especially against actively feeding caterpillars.

#### 2. Diamondback moth (DBM)

*   This is not known to affect Marigold. Diamondback moth (*Plutella xylostella*) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower, mustard).

Always ensure thorough spray coverage and follow the manufacturer's instructions for dosage and safety precautions. It is advisable to rotate different classes of insecticides to prevent the development of resistance.
