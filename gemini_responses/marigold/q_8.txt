As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach for effective and sustainable control of sucking pests in Marigold in Haryana.

**Regarding Psylla:**
This is not known to be a significant pest of Marigold. The primary sucking pests affecting Marigold are Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips.

Here's a comprehensive strategy for managing these sucking pests:

**I. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategy**

1.  **Monitoring:**
    *   Regularly inspect your Marigold plants (at least twice a week), especially the undersides of leaves, new shoots, and flower buds, for the presence of pests or symptoms of damage (e.g., curling leaves, sticky honeydew, stunted growth).
    *   Use yellow sticky traps (10-15 traps per acre) to monitor populations of whiteflies, leafhoppers, and thrips. This helps in early detection and assessing pest pressure.

2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the field and surrounding areas free of weeds, as many weeds act as alternate hosts for these pests.
    *   **Balanced Fertilization:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush, succulent growth that is more attractive to sucking pests. Use balanced NPK fertilizers based on soil test recommendations.
    *   **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to improve air circulation and reduce humidity, making the environment less favorable for pest multiplication.
    *   **Removal of Infested Parts:** Promptly remove and destroy severely infested leaves or plant parts to reduce pest inoculum.
    *   **Water Management:** Avoid water stress, as stressed plants can be more susceptible to pest attacks.

3.  **Biological Control:**
    *   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Protect and encourage natural predators like ladybird beetles, lacewings, hoverflies, and parasitic wasps, which feed on aphids and whiteflies. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.
    *   **Biopesticides:** Consider using formulations of entomopathogenic fungi like *Beauveria bassiana* or *Verticillium lecanii* during early stages of infestation, especially under high humidity conditions. Follow manufacturer's recommended dosage.

**II. Chemical Control (When Pest Populations Exceed Thresholds)**

When cultural and biological methods are insufficient, and pest populations are high, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Apply sprays preferably in the morning or evening.

**Recommended CIBRC-approved insecticides for Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips:**

*   **For general sucking pests (Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, Thrips):**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** 0.5 - 1 ml/L of water.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** 0.2 - 0.4 g/L of water.
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** 0.2 - 0.4 g/L of water.
    *   **Flonicamid 50% WG:** 0.3 g/L of water.

*   **Specifically for Whiteflies (and for resistance management):**
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** 1.25 ml/L of water (targets nymphs, acts as an Insect Growth Regulator).
    *   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** 0.5 - 0.75 ml/L of water (effective against whiteflies and mites).
    *   **Dinotefuran 20% SG:** 0.3 - 0.4 g/L of water.

*   **For Thrips (when predominant):**
    *   **Fipronil 5% SC:** 1.5 - 2 ml/L of water.
    *   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** 0.5 - 0.75 ml/L of water.

*   **Botanical Insecticide (for early infestation or as part of rotation):**
    *   **Azadirachtin 1500 ppm:** 3 - 5 ml/L of water.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Rotation:** Never use the same chemical repeatedly. Rotate between different classes of insecticides (e.g., Neonicotinoids, Pyridines, IGRs, Ketoenols) to prevent pest resistance.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where many sucking pests reside.
*   **Safety:** Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label, including dosage, application method, pre-harvest interval, and safety precautions (wearing gloves, mask, etc.).
*   **Consult Experts:** For severe or persistent infestations, consult with local agricultural extension officers or HAU experts for specific recommendations.
