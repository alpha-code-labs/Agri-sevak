Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding Scale insects and Mealybugs in Marigold. Both are significant sucking pests that can severely impact plant health and flower production. Here's a scientifically verified approach for their control:

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Scale Insects and Mealybugs in Marigold:**

An integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods is most effective for sustainable management.

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Regular Inspection:** Frequently check the undersides of leaves, stems, and leaf axils for early signs of pests. Early detection is key.
    *   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy heavily infested plant parts (leaves, stems). This reduces the pest population and prevents further spread.
    *   **Water Spray:** For mild infestations, a strong jet of water can dislodge mealybugs and young scales from the plants.
    *   **Sanitation:** Remove weeds and plant debris from around the Marigold plants, as these can harbor pests.
    *   **Proper Nutrition:** Ensure balanced fertilization. Over-fertilization, especially with nitrogen, can make plants more susceptible to sucking pests.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Encourage natural enemies like ladybird beetles (coccinellids), lacewings, and parasitic wasps. These predators and parasitoids feed on or lay eggs inside mealybugs and scale insects, helping to keep their populations in check. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

3.  **Chemical Control:**
    When infestations are severe and cultural/biological methods are insufficient, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and in crevices where these pests hide. Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

    Here are some CIBRC approved technical chemicals effective against Scale insects and Mealybugs:

    *   **For Systemic Action (effective against both pests, especially when they are protected by waxy coatings):**
        *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at 1.25 ml per liter of water (or 500 ml per acre). This is an insect growth regulator, highly effective against nymphs of mealybugs and scales.
        *   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:** Apply at 0.75 - 1 ml per liter of water (or 300-400 ml per acre). This is a systemic insecticide that moves both upwards and downwards in the plant, providing excellent control.
        *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at 0.5 - 0.75 ml per liter of water (or 200-300 ml per acre). A widely used systemic insecticide effective against sucking pests.

    *   **For Organic/IPM Approach (effective for early stages and less severe infestations):**
        *   **Azadirachtin (Neem-based formulations, e.g., 10000 ppm):** Apply at 1-2 ml per liter of water (or 400-800 ml per acre). This acts as an antifeedant, repellent, and insect growth disruptor. Repeat applications may be needed.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Thorough Coverage:** Ensure the spray solution reaches all parts of the plant, especially the undersides of leaves and stem joints where these pests congregate.
*   **Repeat Application:** For severe infestations, a second application after 7-10 days might be necessary, especially for scales and mealybugs due to their protected nature and overlapping generations.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) like gloves, masks, and protective clothing while handling and spraying chemicals. Follow the instructions and safety precautions mentioned on the product label.
*   **Timing:** Spray during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.

By adopting these practices, you can effectively manage Scale insects and Mealybugs in your Marigold crop. For specific product recommendations available in your local area, please consult with your nearest Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or agricultural extension officer.
