As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following fertilizer schedule for Marigold cultivation in Haryana. Please note that these are general recommendations, and a soil test is always advised for precise nutrient management tailored to your specific field conditions.

**General NPK Recommendation for Marigold:**
For optimal growth and flowering, Marigold typically requires:
*   Nitrogen (N): 80-100 kg/acre
*   Phosphorus (P2O5): 40-50 kg/acre
*   Potassium (K2O): 40-50 kg/acre

Based on these requirements, here are the recommended doses for various fertilizers:

**1. Basal Application (at the time of planting):**
Apply these fertilizers and mix them well into the soil before planting the marigold seedlings.
*   **DAP (Di-Ammonium Phosphate):** 110 kg/acre (This provides approximately 20 kg Nitrogen and 50 kg Phosphorus (P2O5)).
*   **Potash (Muriate of Potash - MOP):** 85 kg/acre (This provides approximately 50 kg Potassium (K2O)).
*   **Sulphur (Elemental Sulphur):** 10 kg/acre (If not using SSP, elemental sulphur is beneficial for plant health and flower quality).

**Alternative for Phosphorus and Sulphur (if DAP is not used):**
*   **SSP (Single Super Phosphate):** 315 kg/acre (This provides approximately 50 kg Phosphorus (P2O5) and 35 kg Sulphur). If using SSP, the Nitrogen component from DAP will need to be compensated by additional Urea in the basal application.

**2. Top-dressing (for Nitrogen):**
The remaining Nitrogen should be applied in split doses as top-dressing for continuous growth and flowering.

*   **First Top-dressing (30-45 days after planting):**
    *   **Urea:** 85 kg/acre
*   **Second Top-dressing (at budding stage, approximately 60-75 days after planting):**
    *   **Urea:** 90 kg/acre

**(Note: If SSP was used basally instead of DAP, the total Urea requirement would be higher, approximately 217 kg/acre, split into three applications: 72 kg basal, 72 kg at 30-45 DAP, and 73 kg at budding stage.)**

**3. Foliar Application (for Nano Fertilizers):**
Nano fertilizers are highly efficient and can be used as supplementary nutrition, especially during critical growth stages or nutrient stress.

*   **Nano-Urea:** 2-4 ml/L of water. Apply 2-3 sprays at an interval of 15-20 days, starting from 30-45 days after planting.
*   **Nano-DAP:** 2-4 ml/L of water. Apply 1-2 sprays, particularly before flowering or during early flowering stages.

**4. NPK (Complex Fertilizers):**
If you prefer to use NPK complex fertilizers (e.g., 12:32:16, 19:19:19), the doses should be adjusted to meet the recommended NPK requirements (80-100 kg N, 40-50 kg P2O5, 40-50 kg K2O per acre). For example, to achieve 50 kg P2O5 using **NPK (12:32:16)**, you would need approximately 156 kg of this fertilizer per acre, which would then provide some N and K, requiring further adjustments with **Urea** and **Potash**. It is generally simpler to use individual fertilizers as outlined above for precise nutrient management.
