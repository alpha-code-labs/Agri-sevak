As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies in Marigold cultivation in Haryana:

### Control of Beetles in Marigold

Beetles, particularly flea beetles and sometimes blister beetles, can cause significant damage to marigold plants by feeding on leaves, stems, and flowers. An Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is recommended for effective control.

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Keep the field free of weeds and plant debris, which can harbor pests.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting marigolds in the same spot year after year to break pest cycles.
*   **Timely Sowing:** Adjust planting times to avoid peak beetle activity if possible.
*   **Hand-picking:** For larger beetles like blister beetles, hand-picking can be effective in small plots, especially in the early morning or late evening when they are less active.
*   **Physical Barriers:** In small garden settings, row covers can protect young plants from flea beetles.

**2. Chemical Control (if infestation is severe):**
When beetle populations are high and causing economic damage, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always follow label instructions carefully and ensure proper safety measures.

*   **For Flea Beetles and other chewing beetles:**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at a rate of 0.5 - 1 ml per liter of water.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at a rate of 0.2 - 0.4 g per liter of water.
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply at a rate of 0.2 - 0.4 g per liter of water.
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** Apply at a rate of 0.3 ml per liter of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** Apply at a rate of 0.5 - 1 ml per liter of water.

### Control of Weevils in Marigold

While some generalist weevils might occasionally feed on marigold, they are not typically considered a major pest of this crop in Haryana. If sporadic feeding damage is observed, the chemical control measures recommended for beetles (e.g., **Lambda-cyhalothrin**, **Chlorantraniliprole**) would generally be effective against weevils as well.

### Control of Sawflies in Marigold

This is not known to affect Marigold.
