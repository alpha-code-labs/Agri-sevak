As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified recommendations for the use of growth regulators and Boron in Marigold cultivation in Haryana:

### Growth Regulators/Hormones and Micronutrients for Marigold

1.  **Ethephon**
    *   **Purpose:** Ethephon is used to promote branching, increase the number of flowers, and induce early flowering in Marigold. It can also help in producing more compact plants.
    *   **Recommended Dose:** For foliar application, use **Ethephon** at a concentration of 250-500 mg/L (equivalent to 0.25-0.5 ml/L of a 40% SL formulation, or 0.5-1 ml/L of a 20% SL formulation, please adjust based on the specific product concentration available).
    *   **Application Timing:** Apply 2-3 weeks after transplanting, and a second spray if needed, 2-3 weeks later, depending on the desired plant architecture and growth stage.

2.  **2,4-D (2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid)**
    *   **Recommendation:** **2,4-D** is primarily known and registered as a selective herbicide in agriculture. While auxins can act as plant growth regulators, the margin of safety for 2,4-D in Marigold as a growth regulator is extremely narrow. Even slight overdosing can lead to severe phytotoxicity, malformation, or death of the plant.
    *   **Conclusion:** Therefore, **2,4-D is not recommended for use as a growth regulator in Marigold** in general agricultural practice due to its high risk of causing damage and its primary herbicidal action.

3.  **Boron**
    *   **Purpose:** Boron is an essential micronutrient crucial for pollen germination, flower development, fruit setting, and overall plant vigor. Its deficiency can lead to poor flowering and reduced yield.
    *   **Recommended Dose:** For foliar application, use **Disodium tetraborate decahydrate** (Borax) at a concentration of 1-2 g/L of water (0.1-0.2% solution).
    *   **Application Timing:** Apply as a foliar spray during the vegetative growth phase and repeat at the bud initiation stage to ensure an adequate supply for optimal flowering.
    *   **Note:** If soil testing indicates a severe deficiency, Boron can also be applied to the soil, typically at 1-2 kg of actual Boron per acre, but foliar application is often preferred for quick correction and efficient uptake in flowering plants.
