Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing fungal diseases in Marigold cultivation in Haryana.

Effective management of fungal diseases requires an integrated approach combining cultural practices and timely application of CIBRC approved fungicides.

**General Cultural Practices for Disease Management:**

*   **Resistant Varieties:** Whenever possible, choose disease-resistant or tolerant Marigold varieties suitable for the Haryana climate.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris, weeds, and volunteer plants from the field to reduce inoculum sources.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to improve air circulation, which helps reduce humidity around plants and inhibits fungal growth.
*   **Water Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day, as wet foliage for extended periods promotes fungal diseases. Drip irrigation is preferable. Water in the morning to allow foliage to dry quickly.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Provide balanced nutrition. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can lead to lush, susceptible growth.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate Marigold with non-host crops to break the disease cycle in the soil.

**Specific Fungal Disease Control in Marigold:**

Here's how to control the mentioned fungal diseases:

1.  **Alternaria Leaf Spot (Caused by *Alternaria tagetica*, *A. zinniae*)**
    This is a common and significant disease in Marigold, causing dark brown to black spots with concentric rings on leaves, stems, and flowers, leading to defoliation.
    *   **Fungicide Application:**
        *   Spray with **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2.5 g/L of water.
        *   Alternatively, spray with **Chlorothalonil** (75% WP) at 2 g/L of water.
        *   For systemic action, use **Propiconazole** (25% EC) at 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   A combination product of **Carbendazim 12% + Mancozeb 63% WP** can be used at 2 g/L of water.
    *   Start spraying at the first sign of symptoms and repeat at 10-15 day intervals, rotating fungicides to prevent resistance.

2.  **Anthracnose (Caused by *Colletotrichum gloeosporioides*)**
    Anthracnose can cause irregular, sunken spots on leaves, stems, and flowers, often with dark margins.
    *   **Fungicide Application:**
        *   Spray with **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2.5 g/L of water.
        *   Alternatively, spray with **Carbendazim** (50% WP) at 1 g/L of water.
        *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC) at 0.5 ml/L of water can also be effective.
    *   Ensure good coverage of the plant canopy.

3.  **Blast**
    This is not known to affect Marigold.

4.  **Blight (Including *Botrytis* Blight / Grey Mould, which covers Grey Mildew)**
    *Botrytis* blight is a very common and destructive disease, especially under cool, humid conditions. It causes water-soaked spots on petals, leaves, and stems, which rapidly turn brown and are covered with a fuzzy grey mould.
    *   **Fungicide Application:**
        *   Spray with **Chlorothalonil** (75% WP) at 2 g/L of water.
        *   Alternatively, use **Tebuconazole** (25.9% EC) at 0.75 ml/L of water.
        *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC) at 0.5 ml/L of water is also effective.
    *   Focus on improving air circulation and reducing humidity. Remove infected plant parts promptly.

5.  **Brown Spot**
    This is not known to affect Marigold as a distinct disease.

6.  **Downy Mildew (Caused by *Plasmopara tageticola*)**
    Downy mildew appears as yellowish-green spots on the upper leaf surface, with a purplish-grey, fuzzy growth on the corresponding lower leaf surface.
    *   **Fungicide Application:**
        *   Spray with a combination product of **Dimethomorph 50% WP + Mancozeb 25% WP** at 2 g/L of water.
        *   Alternatively, use **Propamocarb hydrochloride** (72.2% SL) at 2.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Fenamidone 10% + Mancozeb 50% WG** at 3 g/L of water is another effective option.
    *   Ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves.

7.  **Powdery Mildew (Caused by *Erysiphe cichoracearum*, *Oidium tagetes*)**
    This disease is characterized by white, powdery patches on leaves, stems, and flower buds, leading to distorted growth and reduced flowering.
    *   **Fungicide Application:**
        *   Spray with **Wettable Sulphur** (80% WP) at 2.5-3 g/L of water.
        *   Alternatively, use **Hexaconazole** (5% EC) at 1 ml/L of water.
        *   **Myclobutanil** (10% WP) at 0.5 g/L of water is also effective.
        *   **Penconazole** (10% EC) at 0.5 ml/L of water can be used.
    *   Apply at the first sign of symptoms and repeat as necessary, typically at 10-14 day intervals.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the fungicide label for correct dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of fungicide resistance.
*   For best results, integrate these chemical controls with the cultural practices mentioned above.
