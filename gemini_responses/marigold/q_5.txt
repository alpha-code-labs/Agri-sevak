As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm the following regarding the conditions you've mentioned for Marigold cultivation in Haryana:

*   **Scab:** This is not known to affect Marigold.
*   **Canker:** This is not known to affect Marigold.
*   **Gummosis:** This is not known to affect Marigold.
*   **Lichen:** This is not known to affect Marigold.

These conditions are typically associated with different types of plants (e.g., woody perennials, fruit trees) or are not considered plant diseases in the context of herbaceous annuals like Marigold. Marigolds are generally affected by other common diseases such as powdery mildew, rust, leaf spots, and root rots, which require specific management strategies.
