As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I emphasize that addressing micronutrient deficiencies in Marigold (Tagetes spp.) is crucial for healthy growth, vibrant flowering, and optimal yield. The most scientific approach begins with a comprehensive soil test to accurately identify specific deficiencies and their severity.

Here's how to address the common micronutrient deficiencies in Marigold, using CIBRC approved technical chemical names and metric units:

**General Recommendations:**

*   **Soil Testing:** Always conduct a soil test before applying any micronutrients. This prevents over-application, which can lead to toxicity or nutrient imbalances.
*   **Foliar Application:** Foliar sprays are generally preferred for quick correction of deficiencies, especially for mobile nutrients, as they allow for rapid absorption by the leaves.
*   **Timing of Foliar Sprays:** Apply sprays during the cooler parts of the day (early morning or late afternoon) to maximize absorption and minimize leaf scorching.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage for effective absorption.
*   **Repeat Applications:** Depending on the severity of the deficiency, 2-3 foliar sprays at 10-15 day intervals may be required.

**Specific Micronutrient Deficiencies and Management in Marigold:**

1.  **Zinc (Zn) Deficiency:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Stunted plant growth, small and narrow leaves (little leaf), interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, often with a bronzing effect.
    *   **Correction:**
        *   **Foliar Application:** Spray with a 0.2-0.5% solution of **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (2-5 g/L water) or a 0.1% solution of **Zinc EDTA** (1 g/L water).
        *   **Soil Application (Basal):** Apply **Zinc sulphate monohydrate** at 10-15 kg/acre or **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** at 20-25 kg/acre before planting or as a top dressing.

2.  **Iron (Fe) Deficiency:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Pronounced interveinal chlorosis on the youngest leaves, which may turn almost white in severe cases, while veins remain green.
    *   **Correction:**
        *   **Foliar Application:** Spray with a 0.2-0.5% solution of **Ferrous sulphate heptahydrate** (2-5 g/L water) along with a few drops of citric acid (to lower pH and improve absorption) or a 0.1% solution of **Ferrous EDTA** (1 g/L water).
        *   **Soil Application:** In severe cases, **Ferrous sulphate heptahydrate** can be applied at 20-25 kg/acre, but foliar application is generally more effective for quick correction.

3.  **Boron (B) Deficiency:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, thickening and brittleness of young leaves, cracking of stems, poor flower development, and sometimes distorted or aborted flower buds.
    *   **Correction:**
        *   **Foliar Application:** Spray with a 0.1-0.2% solution of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (1-2 g/L water) or a 0.1% solution of **Boric acid** (1 g/L water).
        *   **Soil Application (Basal):** Apply **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate) at 5-10 kg/acre or **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** at 2-4 kg/acre. *Caution: Boron has a narrow range between deficiency and toxicity; precise application based on soil test is critical.*

4.  **Calcium (Ca) Deficiency:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, distortion or necrosis (tip burn) of young leaves and growing points, poor root development, and weak stems.
    *   **Correction:**
        *   **Foliar Application:** Spray with a 0.5-1% solution of **Calcium nitrate** (5-10 g/L water) or a 0.2-0.4% solution of **Calcium chloride** (2-4 g/L water).
        *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Calcium nitrate** at 20-30 kg/acre as a top dressing or incorporate **Gypsum** (Calcium sulphate dihydrate) at recommended rates based on soil test for long-term soil amendment, especially in sodic soils.

5.  **Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, starting from the leaf margins and progressing inwards, often with a purplish or reddish tinge. Leaves may become brittle.
    *   **Correction:**
        *   **Foliar Application:** Spray with a 0.5-1% solution of **Magnesium sulphate heptahydrate** (5-10 g/L water).
        *   **Soil Application (Basal):** Apply **Magnesium sulphate heptahydrate** at 20-30 kg/acre before planting or as a top dressing.

6.  **Manganese (Mn) Deficiency:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, similar to iron deficiency but often accompanied by small necrotic (dead) spots or streaks within the yellowed areas.
    *   **Correction:**
        *   **Foliar Application:** Spray with a 0.2-0.5% solution of **Manganese sulphate monohydrate** (2-5 g/L water).
        *   **Soil Application:** In severe cases, **Manganese sulphate monohydrate** can be applied at 10-15 kg/acre, but foliar application is generally more effective for quick correction.
