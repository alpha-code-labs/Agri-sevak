Protecting Marigold from wild animals is a significant challenge for farmers in Haryana, as animals like Nilgai (Blue Bull), wild boar, monkeys, and various rodents can cause considerable damage. As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend the following scientifically verified methods to protect your Marigold crop:

*   **Physical Barriers:** These are generally the most effective methods for preventing animal entry.
    *   **Wire Mesh Fencing:** For smaller animals like rodents, rabbits, and even young Nilgai, a sturdy wire mesh fence can be highly effective. Ensure the fence is buried at least 30 cm (0.3 meters) underground to prevent burrowing animals. The height should be appropriate for the target animal (e.g., 1.5-2 meters for Nilgai).
    *   **Barbed Wire Fencing:** A multi-strand barbed wire fence (5-7 strands) can deter larger animals like Nilgai and wild boar. The lowest strand should be close to the ground, and subsequent strands spaced appropriately.
    *   **Electric Fencing:** A low-cost, solar-powered electric fence can be highly effective against most wild animals. It delivers a non-lethal shock that deters animals without causing harm. Proper installation, regular maintenance, and clear warning signs are crucial for safety.
*   **Deterrents:** These methods aim to scare or repel animals. Their effectiveness can vary, and animals may habituate over time.
    *   **Visual Deterrents:**
        *   **Scarecrows:** Regularly changing their location, appearance, and clothing can prolong their effectiveness.
        *   **Reflective Tapes/CDs:** Hanging shiny objects that move and reflect light can create visual disturbances.
    *   **Auditory Deterrents:**
        *   **Noise Makers:** Using devices that produce loud noises (e.g., gas cannons, firecrackers) can temporarily scare animals away, but they are often not sustainable or effective long-term as animals learn to ignore them.
    *   **Olfactory Deterrents:**
        *   Some farmers use substances with strong odors around the field periphery to deter animals. However, the effectiveness varies, and animals can become accustomed to them.
        *   *No specific CIBRC approved technical chemical names are available for general wild animal repellency in crops that can be recommended here.*
*   **Cultural and Management Practices:**
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Keep the area around the Marigold field clean and free of weeds, tall grasses, or debris that could provide shelter for rodents or other small animals.
    *   **Community Approach:** For larger animals like Nilgai and wild boar, a community-level approach involving synchronized efforts to manage animal populations or establish common protective measures across multiple farms can be more effective than individual efforts.
    *   **Guard Dogs:** For larger farms, trained guard dogs can be an effective deterrent against many wild animals, especially at night.
