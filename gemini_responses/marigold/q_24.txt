As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, here is the scientifically verified advice for Marigold transplantation in Haryana:

**1. Ideal Transplantation Time:**
Marigold can be grown almost year-round in Haryana, depending on the variety and market demand. The ideal transplantation times are:
*   **Kharif Season:** Seedlings transplanted during **July - August**. (Sowing in June-July).
*   **Rabi Season:** Seedlings transplanted during **October - November**. (Sowing in September-October). This season is often preferred for African Marigold for better flower quality.
*   **Summer Season:** Seedlings transplanted during **March - April**. (Sowing in February-March). This is suitable for heat-tolerant varieties, especially French Marigold.

Seedlings are typically ready for transplanting when they are **3-4 weeks old** and have reached a height of **10-15 cm**.

**2. Ideal Transplantation Distance:**
The spacing depends on the Marigold type and desired plant growth:
*   **African Marigold (Tagetes erecta):**
    *   Row-to-row: **45-60 cm**
    *   Plant-to-plant: **30-45 cm**
*   **French Marigold (Tagetes patula):**
    *   Row-to-row: **30-45 cm**
    *   Plant-to-plant: **20-30 cm**

**3. Ideal Transplantation Process:**
Follow these steps for successful Marigold transplantation:
*   **Nursery Preparation:** Sow seeds in well-prepared raised beds or seedling trays filled with a good potting mix. Ensure proper drainage.
*   **Field Preparation:**
    *   Plough the field thoroughly to a fine tilth.
    *   Incorporate **20-25 tonnes/acre** of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost during the last ploughing.
    *   Prepare beds or ridges and furrows according to the recommended spacing.
*   **Seedling Selection:** Choose healthy, vigorous, and disease-free seedlings that are 3-4 weeks old and 10-15 cm tall.
*   **Hardening Off:** Gradually expose seedlings to outdoor conditions for about a week before transplanting to acclimatize them to the field environment.
*   **Transplanting:**
    *   Transplant seedlings preferably in the **late afternoon or evening** to minimize transplant shock and allow them to establish overnight.
    *   Make a small hole at the desired spacing.
    *   Carefully remove the seedling from the nursery bed or tray, ensuring the root ball remains intact.
    *   Place the seedling in the hole, ensuring it is planted at the same depth as it was in the nursery.
    *   Gently firm the soil around the base of the seedling to ensure good root-to-soil contact and remove air pockets.
*   **Post-Transplantation Care:**
    *   Immediately after transplanting, provide a **light irrigation** to help the seedlings settle.
    *   Maintain adequate moisture, but avoid waterlogging.
    *   **Pinching:** To encourage bushy growth and more flowers, pinch off the apical bud (the growing tip) of the plant about **2-3 weeks** after transplanting.
