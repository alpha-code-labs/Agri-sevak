Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I understand your concern regarding Wilt and Parawilt in Turmeric, which can significantly impact yield. These conditions are primarily caused by soil-borne pathogens, including fungi (e.g., *Fusarium oxysporum*) and bacteria (e.g., *Ralstonia solanacearum*). Parawilt often refers to a sudden wilting, sometimes exacerbated by environmental stress like waterlogging, making plants more susceptible to these pathogens.

Effective control requires an integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods.

Here's how you can manage Wilt (including Parawilt) in Turmeric:

**I. Cultural Practices (Prevention is Key):**

1.  **Use Healthy Planting Material:** Always select healthy, disease-free rhizomes from reliable sources. Inspect rhizomes carefully for any signs of rot or discoloration before planting.
2.  **Crop Rotation:** Practice a strict crop rotation for at least 3-4 years, avoiding susceptible crops like ginger, banana, potato, tomato, and brinjal in the same field.
3.  **Improve Drainage:** Ensure excellent field drainage to prevent waterlogging, which creates anaerobic conditions favorable for pathogen development and stress on plants. Raised beds can be beneficial.
4.  **Soil Solarization:** During the hot summer months (May-June), plough the field, irrigate it, and then cover it tightly with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks. This raises soil temperature, killing many soil-borne pathogens.
5.  **Avoid Mechanical Injury:** Minimize any injury to rhizomes during planting and subsequent intercultural operations, as wounds serve as entry points for pathogens.
6.  **Maintain Optimal Soil pH:** *Ralstonia solanacearum* (bacterial wilt pathogen) thrives in acidic soils. If your soil is acidic, apply lime to raise the pH to around 6.0-7.0.

**II. Biological Control:**

1.  **Rhizome Treatment:**
    *   Dip healthy rhizomes in a solution of **Trichoderma viride** (10 g/L water) or **Pseudomonas fluorescens** (10 g/L water) for 30 minutes before planting.
2.  **Soil Application:**
    *   Mix **Trichoderma viride** (2.5 kg/acre) or **Pseudomonas fluorescens** (2.5 kg/acre) with 50 kg of well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost. Apply this mixture to the soil during the last ploughing or as a basal application before planting.
    *   Alternatively, drench the soil around the base of plants with a solution of **Trichoderma viride** or **Pseudomonas fluorescens** (10 g/L water) at early stages of crop growth.

**III. Chemical Control:**

1.  **Rhizome Treatment (Pre-planting):**
    *   For comprehensive protection against both fungal and bacterial wilt, treat rhizomes by dipping them for 30 minutes in a solution containing:
        *   **Carbendazim** (1 g/L water) + **Mancozeb** (2.5 g/L water)
    *   If bacterial wilt is a known severe problem in your area, an additional dip in an antibiotic solution can be beneficial:
        *   **Streptomycin sulphate** (0.5 g/L water) + **Tetracycline hydrochloride** (0.5 g/L water) for 30 minutes. (Ensure to allow rhizomes to dry slightly or rinse if using both treatments sequentially).

2.  **Soil Drenching (Post-planting, upon symptom appearance):**
    *   Upon observing initial wilting symptoms, drench the soil around the base of affected plants with:
        *   **Carbendazim** (1 g/L water) for fungal wilt.
        *   **Copper oxychloride** (3 g/L water) for general soil health and some suppression of both fungal and bacterial pathogens. Repeat drenching after 15-20 days if symptoms persist.

Remember, an integrated approach is most effective for managing soil-borne diseases like wilt. Regular monitoring of your crop is crucial for early detection and timely intervention.
