As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the challenges posed by soil pests in turmeric cultivation. Effective management of termites and nematodes is crucial for ensuring healthy crop growth and maximizing yield. We advocate for an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods.

Here's a scientifically verified guide for controlling soil pests in turmeric in Haryana:

### Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Soil Pests in Turmeric

IPM emphasizes a holistic approach to pest control, minimizing reliance on chemical pesticides while maximizing their effectiveness when necessary.

### 1. Termites (White Ants) Control

Termites can cause significant damage by feeding on the rhizomes, leading to wilting, stunted growth, and ultimately, plant death.

*   **Symptoms:** Presence of mud galleries on the plant base or soil, hollowed-out rhizomes, wilting of plants even with adequate moisture.

*   **Control Measures:**

    *   **Cultural Practices:**
        *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove all crop residues, stubble, and woody debris from the field before planting, as these can serve as food sources and breeding sites for termites.
        *   **Deep Ploughing:** Ploughing the field deeply during summer exposes termite colonies to the sun and predators, reducing their population.
        *   **Use of Well-Decomposed Manure:** Ensure that farmyard manure (FYM) or compost is well-decomposed before application, as undecomposed organic matter can attract termites.

    *   **Chemical Control (Pre-planting/At Planting):**
        *   **Pre-planting Soil Treatment:**
            *   Drench the soil with **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** at a rate of 2.5 Litres per acre, diluted in 400-500 Litres of water, and incorporate it into the soil before planting.
        *   **At Planting/During Earthing Up:**
            *   Apply **Fipronil 0.3% GR** at a rate of 10-15 kg per acre by broadcasting and incorporating into the soil at the time of planting or during earthing up. This provides protection against termites and also has some activity against other soil pests.

### 2. Nematodes (Root-knot Nematodes - *Meloidogyne* spp.) Control

Root-knot nematodes are microscopic worms that infect the roots and rhizomes, causing characteristic galls or knots, leading to nutrient and water uptake disruption.

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted plant growth, yellowing of leaves, wilting during the day, reduced rhizome size and quality, presence of galls or knots on roots and rhizomes.

*   **Control Measures:**

    *   **Cultural Practices:**
        *   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate turmeric with non-host crops like cereals (e.g., maize, sorghum) or marigold for 2-3 years to reduce nematode populations in the soil. Avoid continuous cultivation of susceptible crops.
        *   **Solarization:** Cover the moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets during the hot summer months (May-June) for 4-6 weeks. This raises soil temperature, killing nematodes and other soil-borne pathogens.
        *   **Use of Healthy Rhizomes:** Always use disease-free and nematode-free rhizomes for planting.
        *   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporate well-decomposed organic matter, especially **Neem cake**, into the soil at a rate of 200-400 kg per acre during land preparation. Neem cake has nematicidal properties and enhances soil health.

    *   **Biological Control:**
        *   Application of bio-nematicides like *Paecilomyces lilacinus* (now *Purpureocillium lilacinum*) or *Trichoderma harzianum* can help suppress nematode populations. Follow manufacturer's recommendations for dosage and application.

    *   **Chemical Control (Pre-planting/At Planting):**
        *   **Soil Application:**
            *   Apply **Fipronil 0.3% GR** at a rate of 10-15 kg per acre by broadcasting and incorporating into the soil at the time of planting. This granular insecticide also offers some control against nematodes.
            *   Alternatively, **Cartap Hydrochloride 4% GR** can be applied at a rate of 10-15 kg per acre at planting, which provides control against various soil insects and has some nematicidal activity.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully, including dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension officers or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and the latest approved practices.
