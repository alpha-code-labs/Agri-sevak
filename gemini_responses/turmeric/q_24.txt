As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified practices for turmeric cultivation in Haryana:

While turmeric is primarily propagated by planting rhizomes directly, the term "transplantation" can sometimes be used in a broader sense to refer to the establishment of the crop. The following advice pertains to the direct planting of rhizomes, which is the most common and recommended method.

### Ideal Planting/Transplantation Time

*   **Onset of Monsoon:** The ideal time for planting turmeric in Haryana is with the onset of the monsoon rains, typically from **June to early July**.
*   **Irrigated Conditions:** If irrigation facilities are available, planting can commence slightly earlier in **late May to early June** to take advantage of the full growing season.

### Planting/Transplantation Distance

Proper spacing is crucial for optimal growth, rhizome development, and ease of intercultural operations.

*   **Row-to-Row Distance:** Maintain a distance of **45 cm** between rows.
*   **Plant-to-Plant Distance:** Maintain a distance of **15-20 cm** within the row.
*   **Bed System:** For better drainage and aeration, planting on raised beds is highly recommended. Beds can be about 90-120 cm wide, with two rows planted per bed, maintaining the above spacing.

### Planting/Transplantation Process (Direct Rhizome Planting)

1.  **Land Preparation:**
    *   The land should be thoroughly ploughed 2-3 times to a depth of 20-30 cm, followed by harrowing to achieve a fine tilth.
    *   Incorporate 20-25 tonnes of well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost per acre during the last ploughing.
    *   Form raised beds (as mentioned above) or ridges and furrows, depending on soil type and drainage.

2.  **Rhizome Selection:**
    *   Use healthy, disease-free mother rhizomes or finger rhizomes.
    *   Each rhizome piece should weigh approximately **20-25 g** and have at least 1-2 healthy buds.
    *   Approximately **800-1000 kg of rhizomes per acre** are required, depending on the size of the planting material and spacing.

3.  **Rhizome Treatment (Pre-planting):**
    *   To protect against soil-borne diseases and improve germination, treat the rhizomes before planting.
    *   Dip the rhizomes in a solution of **Mancozeb** (2.5-3 g/L of water) for 30 minutes. Allow them to air dry in the shade before planting.

4.  **Planting Method:**
    *   Plant the treated rhizomes in shallow pits or furrows at a depth of **5-7 cm**.
    *   Ensure the buds are facing upwards or sideways.
    *   Cover the rhizomes with loose soil and gently press.

5.  **Post-Planting Care:**
    *   **Mulching:** Immediately after planting, apply a thick layer (10-15 cm) of organic mulch such as paddy straw, sugarcane trash, or dry leaves. Mulching helps conserve soil moisture, suppress weeds, regulate soil temperature, and adds organic matter.
    *   **Irrigation:** If there is no immediate rainfall after planting, provide a light irrigation to ensure proper establishment. Subsequent irrigations should be given as needed, especially during dry spells.
