Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

The symptom of "drying up" (drying shoots, leaves, and flowers) in Turmeric is a general indication of underlying stress, which can be either abiotic (environmental) or biotic (pests and diseases). It is crucial to accurately diagnose the specific cause to implement effective management strategies. As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I advise you to carefully observe your plants for additional symptoms before proceeding with any treatment.

Here are the common causes for drying up in Turmeric and their recommended management:

**I. Abiotic Stresses (Environmental Factors):**

1.  **Water Stress:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Leaves turn yellow, curl, and eventually dry up. The entire plant may wilt and dry. This can be due to either insufficient water (drought) or excessive water (waterlogging leading to root damage).
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Drought:** Ensure timely and adequate irrigation, especially during critical growth stages. Turmeric requires consistent moisture.
        *   **Waterlogging:** Ensure proper drainage in your fields. Avoid planting in low-lying areas prone to water accumulation. Improve soil structure by adding organic matter.

2.  **Nutrient Deficiencies:**
    *   **Symptoms:** General yellowing, stunted growth, and premature drying of older leaves can indicate nutrient deficiencies (e.g., Nitrogen, Potassium).
    *   **Management:**
        *   Conduct a soil test to identify specific nutrient deficiencies.
        *   Apply balanced fertilizers as per HAU recommendations based on soil test results. Foliar sprays of micronutrients can be considered if specific deficiencies are identified.

3.  **Heat Stress:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Leaves may scorch, turn brown, and dry up, especially during prolonged periods of high temperatures combined with low humidity.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Ensure adequate irrigation to help plants cope with heat.
        *   Consider mulching to keep the soil cool and conserve moisture.

**II. Biotic Stresses (Pests and Diseases):**

1.  **Rhizome Rot (Fungal):** This is one of the most devastating diseases causing drying up.
    *   **Causative Agents:** *Pythium aphanidermatum*, *Phytophthora palmivora*, *Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. zingiberi*.
    *   **Symptoms:** Initial yellowing and wilting of lower leaves, progressing upwards. The pseudostem base becomes soft and watery, and the rhizomes rot, turning brownish-black and emitting a foul smell. Eventually, the entire plant dries up.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Preventive:**
            *   Use disease-free rhizomes for planting.
            *   Improve soil drainage.
            *   Practice crop rotation with non-host crops.
            *   Treat rhizomes before planting: Dip rhizomes for 30 minutes in a solution of **Carbendazim** (1 g/L) + **Mancozeb** (2.5 g/L) or **Metalaxyl-M** + **Mancozeb** (2.5 g/L).
        *   **Curative (Early Stage):**
            *   Drench the soil around affected plants with fungicides.
            *   **Propamocarb Hydrochloride** (2-3 ml/L of water) or
            *   **Metalaxyl-M** + **Mancozeb** (2.5 g/L of water) or
            *   **Fosetyl-Al** (2.5 g/L of water).
            *   Apply 250-500 ml of solution per plant, ensuring it reaches the root zone. Repeat after 10-15 days if necessary.

2.  **Bacterial Wilt:**
    *   **Causative Agent:** *Ralstonia solanacearum*.
    *   **Symptoms:** Sudden wilting of leaves and shoots without yellowing. If the pseudostem is cut, a milky white ooze (bacterial exudate) can be seen from the vascular bundles. Rhizomes may show internal browning.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **No effective chemical cure once infected.** Focus on prevention.
        *   Use disease-free planting material from healthy fields.
        *   Practice strict crop rotation (3-4 years) with non-host crops like cereals.
        *   Avoid planting in fields with a history of bacterial wilt.
        *   Remove and destroy infected plants immediately to prevent spread.
        *   Solarization of soil during summer can reduce bacterial load.

3.  **Shoot Borer (Dichocrocis punctiferalis):**
    *   **Symptoms:** The central shoot of the plant dries up and turns yellow, forming a "dead heart." This is due to the larva boring into the pseudostem and feeding on the internal tissues.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Remove and destroy affected shoots along with the larvae.
        *   Spray insecticides at the initial stage of infestation (when dead hearts are few).
        *   **Chlorantraniliprole** (0.3 ml/L of water) or
        *   **Fipronil** (1.5-2 ml/L of water) or
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** (0.5 ml/L of water).
        *   Ensure thorough coverage, especially at the base of the shoots. Repeat after 10-15 days if infestation persists.

4.  **Nematodes (Root-knot nematodes - *Meloidogyne* spp.):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, and premature drying due to damaged roots. Galls or swellings can be observed on the roots and rhizomes upon examination.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Use healthy, nematode-free planting material.
        *   Practice crop rotation with non-host crops (e.g., marigold, mustard, cereals).
        *   Apply organic amendments like neem cake (200 kg/acre) at the time of planting.
        *   In severely infested fields, apply nematicides at planting:
            *   **Carbofuran** 3G (10 kg/acre) in the soil at planting.

5.  **Leaf Spot/Blight (Fungal):**
    *   **Causative Agents:** *Colletotrichum capsici*, *Taphrina maculans*, *Curvularia* spp.
    *   **Symptoms:** Brown spots with yellow halos on leaves, which enlarge and coalesce, leading to drying and shedding of leaves. Severe infection can lead to defoliation and overall plant stress, contributing to a "drying up" appearance.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Foliar spray with fungicides:
            *   **Mancozeb** (2.5 g/L of water) or
            *   **Chlorothalonil** (2 g/L of water) or
            *   **Propiconazole** (1 ml/L of water).
            *   Repeat sprays at 10-15 day intervals depending on disease severity.

**General Recommendations:**

*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy all infected plant debris to reduce inoculum.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice rotation with non-host crops to break the disease cycle.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure proper nutrient management for vigorous plant growth, which helps in disease resistance.
*   **Timely Irrigation:** Maintain optimal soil moisture without waterlogging.

**Crucial Advice:**
If you are unsure about the exact cause, please collect a sample of the affected plant (including roots and rhizomes) and bring it to your nearest Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or the Department of Plant Pathology/Entomology at HAU, Hisar, for an accurate diagnosis. Early and correct diagnosis is key to effective management.
