Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU), Hisar, I understand your concern regarding Scale insects and Mealybugs in Turmeric. These sap-sucking pests can significantly reduce yield and quality if not managed effectively. Here's a scientifically verified approach for their control:

**Understanding the Pests:**
Scale insects and Mealybugs are small, soft-bodied insects that feed by sucking sap from plant tissues, often found on the undersides of leaves, stems, and rhizomes. They excrete honeydew, which leads to sooty mold growth, further hindering photosynthesis.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategy:**

An integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods is most effective for sustainable control.

**1. Cultural Control:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Regularly remove weeds and crop residues from the field, as they can harbor these pests.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to improve air circulation and reduce humidity, which can discourage pest build-up.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, as it can lead to lush, soft growth that is more attractive to sap-sucking pests.
*   **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your turmeric plants, especially the leaf sheaths and rhizomes, for early signs of infestation. Early detection is key to effective control.
*   **Water Management:** Ensure proper irrigation. Water-stressed plants can be more susceptible to pest attacks.

**2. Biological Control:**
*   **Natural Enemies:** Encourage beneficial insects like ladybird beetles, lacewings, and parasitic wasps, which are natural predators and parasites of scale insects and mealybugs. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficials.
*   **Biopesticides:**
    *   For moderate infestations, consider spraying entomopathogenic fungi:
        *   **Beauveria bassiana** (1x10^8 CFU/g): Apply at 2.5 kg per acre (or 10-12.5 g per litre of water).
        *   **Lecanicillium lecanii** (1x10^8 CFU/g): Apply at 2.5 kg per acre (or 10-12.5 g per litre of water).
    *   Ensure good coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and stems. Apply during cooler parts of the day.

**3. Chemical Control (for severe infestations or when other methods are insufficient):**
When chemical intervention is necessary, choose CIBRC-approved insecticides and ensure thorough coverage, especially targeting the hidden pests. Systemic insecticides are often effective as they are absorbed by the plant and ingested by the feeding pests.

*   **For Scale Insects and Mealybugs:**
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at 1.0 - 1.25 litres per acre (or 4-5 ml per litre of water). This is an insect growth regulator, effective against nymphs.
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at 125 ml per acre (or 0.5 ml per litre of water). This is a systemic insecticide.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at 100 g per acre (or 0.4 g per litre of water). This is also a systemic insecticide.
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply at 100-125 g per acre (or 0.4-0.5 g per litre of water). Another systemic option.
    *   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:** Apply at 200-250 ml per acre (or 0.8-1.0 ml per litre of water). This is a systemic insecticide with translaminar movement, effective against hidden pests.
    *   **Flupyradifurone 200 SL:** Apply at 200 ml per acre (or 0.8 ml per litre of water). A newer systemic insecticide.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Spray Coverage:** Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and within leaf sheaths where these pests often hide.
*   **Adjuvants:** Adding a spreading agent (sticker/spreader) to the spray solution can improve coverage and efficacy, especially for waxy pests like mealybugs.
*   **Rotation:** To prevent the development of pesticide resistance, rotate insecticides with different modes of action.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) while handling and spraying chemicals. Follow the instructions and safety precautions mentioned on the product label.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Be mindful of the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) for any chemical applied, especially if the crop is nearing harvest.
