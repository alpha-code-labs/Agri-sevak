As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend an integrated weed management approach for turmeric cultivation in Haryana, combining cultural, mechanical, and chemical methods for effective and sustainable control. Turmeric is a slow-growing crop in its initial stages, making it highly susceptible to weed competition, especially during the first 90-120 days after planting.

**Integrated Weed Management (IWM) for Turmeric:**

1.  **Cultural and Mechanical Methods:**
    *   **Thorough Land Preparation:** Deep ploughing and harrowing before planting help expose weed seeds to the sun, reducing their viability.
    *   **Mulching:** Applying organic mulch (straw, dry leaves, sugarcane trash) or black plastic mulch immediately after planting rhizomes is highly effective. Mulch suppresses weed growth, conserves soil moisture, and regulates soil temperature, significantly reducing the need for weeding.
    *   **Hand Weeding/Intercultivation:** Two to three hand weedings are crucial during the initial 90-120 days. The first weeding should be done around 30-45 days after planting, followed by subsequent weedings at 30-day intervals. Shallow intercultivation using hoes can also be done between rows, taking care not to damage rhizomes.
    *   **Clean Planting Material:** Ensure rhizomes are free from weed seeds or parasitic weed structures.
    *   **Proper Spacing:** Adhering to recommended plant spacing allows for quicker canopy closure, which helps shade out late-emerging weeds.

2.  **Chemical Control (Herbicides):**
    Herbicides should be used judiciously and as a supplement to cultural practices. Always ensure uniform spray coverage and use the recommended water volume (typically 200-300 litres per acre).

    **A. Pre-emergence Herbicides (Applied after planting rhizomes but before crop and weed emergence):**
    These are effective against a wide range of broadleaf and narrowleaf weeds, including Bathu, Congress grass, and can offer suppression against Amarbail.

    *   **For Broadleaf, Narrowleaf (Grasses), Bathu, Congress grass:**
        *   **Pendimethalin 30% EC:** Apply 3.3 litres per acre (equivalent to 1.0 kg active ingredient per acre) within 1-3 days after planting.
        *   **Oxyfluorfen 23.5% EC:** Apply 600-1000 ml per acre (equivalent to 0.15-0.25 kg active ingredient per acre) within 1-3 days after planting.

    **B. Post-emergence Herbicides (Applied after weeds have emerged):**
    These are used when weeds have already emerged and are at an early growth stage.

    *   **For Narrowleaf Weeds (Grasses) including Phalaris minor:**
        *   **Quizalofop ethyl 5% EC:** Apply 1.0-1.5 litres per acre (equivalent to 50-75 g active ingredient per acre) when grasses are at 2-4 leaf stage.
        *   **Fenoxaprop-p-ethyl 9% EC:** Apply 500-600 ml per acre (equivalent to 45-54 g active ingredient per acre) when grasses are at 2-4 leaf stage.

    *   **For Broadleaf Weeds (e.g., Bathu, Congress grass):**
        *   Hand weeding is generally preferred for broadleaf weeds in turmeric. If chemical control is necessary, a directed spray of a selective herbicide can be considered, but care must be taken to avoid contact with turmeric plants.
        *   **Metribuzin 70% WP:** Can be used at a lower dose of 200-300 g per acre (equivalent to 140-210 g active ingredient per acre) as a directed spray to control broadleaf weeds, but exercise extreme caution to prevent drift onto turmeric plants, as it can cause phytotoxicity.

    *   **For Amarbail (Cuscuta spp.):**
        *   **Prevention is key:** Use clean planting material and avoid bringing contaminated soil/manure.
        *   **Manual Removal:** Hand-picking and destroying Amarbail strands as soon as they are noticed is the most effective method. Remove affected turmeric plants if the infestation is severe, to prevent further spread.
        *   **Pre-emergence herbicides** like **Pendimethalin** can offer some initial suppression of Cuscuta germination.

    *   **For Congress grass (Parthenium hysterophorus):**
        *   **Manual Removal:** Uproot young plants before flowering, wearing gloves to avoid skin irritation.
        *   **Directed Spray (Non-selective):** In heavily infested areas or for stale seedbed preparation (before planting), non-selective herbicides can be used.
            *   **Glyphosate 41% SL:** Apply 1.0-1.2 litres per acre (equivalent to 0.41-0.49 kg active ingredient per acre) as a directed spray in inter-rows, ensuring no contact with turmeric plants.
            *   **Paraquat dichloride 24% SL:** Apply 1.0-1.2 litres per acre (equivalent to 0.24-0.29 kg active ingredient per acre) as a directed spray in inter-rows.

    *   **For Orobanche (Broomrape):**
        *   **This is not known to affect Turmeric.** Orobanche is primarily a parasitic weed of solanaceous crops (like tomato, brinjal, tobacco) and some legumes, not typically a problem in turmeric (a monocot).

**General Precautions:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the herbicide label carefully.
*   Use appropriate safety gear (gloves, mask, protective clothing) during herbicide application.
*   Calibrate your sprayer to ensure correct dosage and uniform coverage.
*   Avoid spraying on windy days to prevent drift.
*   Rotate herbicides with different modes of action to prevent herbicide resistance development.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions.
