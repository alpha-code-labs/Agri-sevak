As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified strategies for controlling sucking pests in Turmeric in Haryana:

**Regarding Psylla:**
This is not known to affect Turmeric.

**Control of Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips in Turmeric:**

An Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is crucial for effective and sustainable control of these sucking pests.

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   **Regular Monitoring:** Frequently inspect the crop, especially the undersides of leaves and growing points, to detect pest incidence early.
*   **Weed Management:** Keep the field and surrounding areas free of weeds, as they can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
*   **Proper Spacing and Nutrition:** Ensure optimal plant spacing and balanced nutrient application to promote healthy, vigorous plants that are more tolerant to pest damage.
*   **Yellow Sticky Traps:** Install yellow sticky traps at a height just above the crop canopy (10-15 traps per acre) for monitoring pest populations and mass trapping of adult whiteflies and leafhoppers.

**2. Biological Control:**
*   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Protect and encourage natural predators like ladybird beetles, lacewings, and parasitic wasps, which feed on aphids, whiteflies, and leafhoppers. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

**3. Chemical Control (When pest populations exceed economic threshold levels):**
When chemical intervention is necessary, rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Always ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where these pests often reside.

Here are some CIBRC approved technical chemical options:

*   For general control of Aphids, Leafhoppers, and Whiteflies:
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply 125-150 ml per acre.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply 80-100 g per acre.
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply 80-100 g per acre.

*   For effective control of Thrips, and also controls Aphids and Leafhoppers:
    *   **Fipronil 5% SC:** Apply 400-600 ml per acre.

*   For specific control of Whitefly nymphs and Leafhopper nymphs (Insect Growth Regulator):
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply 400-600 ml per acre.

*   For selective control of Aphids and Whiteflies:
    *   **Flonicamid 50% WG:** Apply 120-150 g per acre.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Water Volume:** Always mix the recommended quantity of insecticide in 200-250 liters of water per acre for effective spray coverage.
*   **Rotation:** Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in pest populations.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Strictly observe the recommended pre-harvest interval (PHI) for each chemical to ensure the safety of the produce.
*   **Safety Precautions:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying. Follow all instructions on the product label carefully. Avoid spraying during windy conditions or when bees are actively foraging.
