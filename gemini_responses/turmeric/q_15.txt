As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), here is the scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned conditions in Turmeric in Haryana:

**1. Grasshopper:**
Grasshoppers can cause defoliation in Turmeric, especially during early growth stages.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Maintain good field sanitation by removing weeds and crop residues that can harbor grasshopper eggs and nymphs.
    *   Deep plowing after harvest can expose and destroy egg pods in the soil, reducing future populations.
*   **Chemical Control (if infestation is severe and causing economic damage):**
    *   Spray with **Malathion 50 EC** at 1.25 L/acre (mixed in 250-400 L of water).
    *   Alternatively, spray with **Chlorpyrifos 20 EC** at 1.25 L/acre (mixed in 250-400 L of water).
    *   Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage for effective control.

**2. Painted bug:**
This is not known to affect Turmeric.

**3. Red cotton bug:**
This is not known to affect Turmeric.

**4. Black ants:**
Black ants are generally not considered a primary pest of Turmeric. They are often secondary, attracted to honeydew secreted by other sucking pests (e.g., aphids, mealybugs) or may cause minor damage to young sprouts or seeds.

*   **Management Strategy:**
    *   The primary focus should be on controlling any primary sucking pests that might be attracting ants to the Turmeric crop.
    *   If ants are directly damaging young sprouts, carrying away seeds, or if their nests are causing significant disturbance near the rhizomes, localized control can be considered.
*   **Chemical Control (if direct intervention is necessary for localized ant problems):**
    *   Drenching around ant nests with **Chlorpyrifos 20 EC** at 2.5 ml/L of water can help in localized control. Avoid widespread application unless absolutely necessary, as ants also play a role in soil aeration and predation of other insects.
