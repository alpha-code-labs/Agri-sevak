As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm the following regarding Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies in Turmeric:

*   **Beetles:** This is not known to significantly affect Turmeric.
*   **Weevils:** This is not known to significantly affect Turmeric.
*   **Sawflies:** This is not known to significantly affect Turmeric.

Major insect pests of Turmeric in Haryana and other parts of India primarily include the shoot borer (a moth larva), rhizome fly (a fly larva), and occasionally scale insects or leaf rollers. Beetles, weevils, and sawflies are not commonly recognized as significant pests requiring specific control measures in Turmeric cultivation.
