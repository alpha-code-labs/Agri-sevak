As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University, I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding "Dropping" in Turmeric:

*   **Fruit drop:** This is not known to affect Turmeric, as the economic part of the turmeric plant is the rhizome, not the fruit.
*   **Tinda/Boll dropping:** This is not known to affect Turmeric, as turmeric does not produce Tinda or Bolls.
*   **Flower drop:** While turmeric plants do produce flowers, flower drop is generally not considered an issue that impacts the economic yield (rhizomes) of the crop. The plant's energy is primarily directed towards rhizome development, and flower production or subsequent drop does not significantly affect the harvestable part. Therefore, specific control measures for flower drop are not typically recommended for turmeric cultivation.
