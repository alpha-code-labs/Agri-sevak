As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in Turmeric in Haryana:

**1. Borers (e.g., Rhizome Borer) and Caterpillars (including Leaf Folder):**

These pests, primarily lepidopteran larvae, can cause significant damage to turmeric by boring into rhizomes or shoots, or by feeding on and folding leaves. An Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is highly recommended, combining cultural practices with judicious use of CIBRC-approved insecticides when necessary.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Regular monitoring of the crop for early signs of pest infestation.
    *   Removal and destruction of affected plant parts (leaves, shoots) to reduce pest population.
    *   Use of healthy, pest-free rhizomes for planting.
    *   Maintaining field sanitation.

*   **Chemical Control (for moderate to severe infestations):**
    *   For foliar application, ensure thorough coverage of the plant, especially the undersides of leaves and growing points. Use adequate water volume (typically 200-400 litres per acre depending on crop canopy).
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC at 150 ml/acre.
    *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG at 80-100 g/acre.
    *   **Flubendiamide** 20% WG at 50 g/acre.
    *   **Indoxacarb** 14.5% SC at 200 ml/acre.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 100-120 ml/acre.
    *   **Fipronil** 5% SC at 400-600 ml/acre (effective against borers and some caterpillars, can also be used as a drench for rhizome borers if specified on the label).

    *Note: Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.*

**2. Diamondback Moth:**

*   This is not known to affect Turmeric. Diamondback moth (*Plutella xylostella*) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower, mustard) and does not infest turmeric.
