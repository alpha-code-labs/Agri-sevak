Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide you with scientifically verified advice on addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium) in Turmeric cultivation in Haryana.

The first and most crucial step in addressing any nutrient deficiency is a **soil test**. A comprehensive soil analysis will accurately determine the existing nutrient levels in your field and guide precise fertilizer application, preventing over-application and ensuring optimal plant health and yield.

Here's how to address deficiencies for Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium:

### General Nutrient Management Principles for Turmeric:

*   **Integrated Nutrient Management (INM):** Combine organic manures (Farm Yard Manure - FYM, vermicompost) with chemical fertilizers. FYM @ 20-25 tonnes/acre should be incorporated into the soil at least 2-3 weeks before planting.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure all essential nutrients are available in adequate amounts, as deficiency of one can limit the uptake and utilization of others.
*   **Timely Application:** Apply fertilizers at critical growth stages for maximum efficiency.

### Addressing Specific Macro-nutrient Deficiencies:

#### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency:
**Symptoms:** General yellowing of older leaves (chlorosis), stunted growth, reduced tillering, and overall pale appearance of the plant.

**Correction:**
Nitrogen is crucial for vegetative growth and rhizome development. It is highly mobile in the soil, so split applications are recommended.

*   **Fertilizer:**
    *   **Urea** (46% N)
    *   **Di-Ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5) - *Note: DAP also supplies Phosphorus.*
*   **Application Rate (General Recommendation for Haryana, adjust based on soil test):**
    *   Total Nitrogen requirement: 100-120 kg N per acre.
    *   **Basal Application (at planting):** Apply 1/3rd of the total N. If using DAP for Phosphorus, this will contribute to the N requirement. For example, if applying 130 kg **Di-Ammonium Phosphate** per acre (for P), it provides approximately 23.4 kg N. Supplement with **Urea** to reach the basal N target (e.g., 70-80 kg **Urea** per acre).
    *   **First Top Dressing (60-90 days after planting - DAP):** Apply another 1/3rd of the total N. Approximately 70-85 kg **Urea** per acre.
    *   **Second Top Dressing (120-150 DAP):** Apply the remaining 1/3rd of the total N. Approximately 70-85 kg **Urea** per acre.
*   **Method:** Soil application, broadcast evenly and lightly incorporated into the soil, followed by irrigation.

#### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency:
**Symptoms:** Purplish discoloration of older leaves, stunted growth, poor root development, and delayed maturity. Leaves may appear dull and dark green initially, then turn purplish.

**Correction:**
Phosphorus is essential for root development, energy transfer, and rhizome formation. It is relatively immobile in the soil, so it should be applied basally.

*   **Fertilizer:**
    *   **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5)
    *   **Di-Ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (46% P2O5, 18% N)
*   **Application Rate (General Recommendation for Haryana, adjust based on soil test):**
    *   Total Phosphorus requirement: 60 kg P2O5 per acre.
    *   **Basal Application (at planting):** Apply the entire P requirement.
        *   If using **Single Super Phosphate**: Approximately 375 kg **Single Super Phosphate** per acre.
        *   If using **Di-Ammonium Phosphate**: Approximately 130 kg **Di-Ammonium Phosphate** per acre. (Remember to adjust N application if using DAP).
*   **Method:** Soil application, broadcast and thoroughly mixed into the soil before planting or placed in furrows at planting.

#### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency:
**Symptoms:** Yellowing and scorching/browning of leaf margins (especially older leaves), weak stems, reduced rhizome size and quality, and increased susceptibility to diseases.

**Correction:**
Potassium is vital for water regulation, nutrient transport, disease resistance, and overall rhizome quality. It is moderately mobile in the soil, so split applications are beneficial.

*   **Fertilizer:**
    *   **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** (Potassium Chloride, 60% K2O)
    *   **Sulphate of Potash (SOP)** (Potassium Sulphate, 50% K2O) - *Note: SOP is preferred in saline soils or where sulfur is also deficient.*
*   **Application Rate (General Recommendation for Haryana, adjust based on soil test):**
    *   Total Potassium requirement: 80-100 kg K2O per acre.
    *   **Basal Application (at planting):** Apply 1/2 of the total K requirement. Approximately 65-85 kg **Muriate of Potash** per acre.
    *   **First Top Dressing (60-90 DAP):** Apply the remaining 1/2 of the total K requirement. Approximately 65-85 kg **Muriate of Potash** per acre.
*   **Method:** Soil application, broadcast evenly and lightly incorporated into the soil, followed by irrigation.

Always monitor your crop for signs of improvement after fertilizer application. Regular field visits and observation are key to successful nutrient management. For precise recommendations tailored to your specific field conditions, please consult your local Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or HAU extension scientist with your soil test report.
