As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide scientifically verified advice for controlling rot diseases in Turmeric, specifically for conditions prevalent in Haryana.

It is important to understand that many of the rot types you listed are symptoms of a few primary disease complexes affecting Turmeric, mainly Rhizome Rot and Black Rot.

*   **Fruit Rot** and **Seed Rot** are not known to affect Turmeric, as Turmeric is propagated vegetatively by rhizomes, not seeds or fruits in the botanical sense.
*   **Root Rot, Stem Rot, Foot Rot, Collar Rot, Crown Rot, Neck Rot, and Seedling Rot** are generally manifestations of the **Rhizome Rot Complex**.

Here's how to control these rot types in Turmeric:

**I. Rhizome Rot Complex (covering Root, Stem, Foot, Collar, Crown, Neck, and Seedling Rot)**
This complex is primarily caused by soil-borne fungi such as *Pythium aphanidermatum*, *Phytophthora palmivora*, *Sclerotium rolfsii*, and *Fusarium oxysporum* f. sp. *zingiberi*. Symptoms include yellowing of leaves, water-soaked lesions on pseudostems near the soil line, rotting of rhizomes, and eventual plant collapse.

**A. Cultural and Agronomic Practices:**
1.  **Selection of Planting Material:** Use only healthy, disease-free rhizomes from reliable sources. Inspect rhizomes thoroughly before planting.
2.  **Field Selection and Preparation:**
    *   Ensure good drainage in the field. Avoid waterlogging, as it favors rot pathogens. Raised beds can be beneficial.
    *   Practice crop rotation with non-host crops (e.g., cereals, legumes) for at least 3-4 years to reduce pathogen inoculum in the soil.
    *   Solarize the soil during the hot summer months (May-June) by covering it with transparent polythene sheets for 4-6 weeks. This helps reduce soil-borne pathogen load.
3.  **Planting:**
    *   Avoid planting in fields with a history of severe rot diseases.
    *   Plant at the recommended spacing to ensure good air circulation.
4.  **Water Management:** Irrigate judiciously. Avoid excessive irrigation, especially during periods of high humidity.
5.  **Sanitation:**
    *   Remove and destroy infected plants and rhizomes immediately to prevent further spread. Do not compost infected material.
    *   Clean farm tools and equipment after use in infected fields.

**B. Biological Control:**
1.  **Rhizome Treatment:** Treat rhizomes before planting by dipping them in a suspension of:
    *   **_Trichoderma viride_** or **_Trichoderma harzianum_**: 10 g/kg of rhizomes.
    *   **_Pseudomonas fluorescens_**: 10 g/kg of rhizomes.
    *   Allow rhizomes to air dry in shade before planting.
2.  **Soil Application:** Apply **_Trichoderma viride_** or **_Trichoderma harzianum_** (2.5 kg/acre) mixed with 50 kg of farmyard manure (FYM) or compost, and apply to the soil before planting or as a drench around the base of plants.

**C. Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved):**
1.  **Rhizome Treatment (Pre-planting):**
    *   Dip rhizomes for 30 minutes in a solution of **Carbendazim** 12% + **Mancozeb** 63% WP (2 g/L of water) or **Propiconazole** 25% EC (1 ml/L of water).
    *   Alternatively, use **Metalaxyl-M** 3.3% + **Mancozeb** 66.7% WP (2.5 g/L of water).
    *   Allow rhizomes to air dry in shade before planting.
2.  **Soil Drenching (Post-emergence, upon symptom appearance):**
    *   Drench the soil around the base of affected plants with **Metalaxyl-M** 3.3% + **Mancozeb** 66.7% WP (2.5 g/L of water) at 2-3 L per plant, depending on plant size. Repeat if necessary after 15-20 days.
    *   Alternatively, drench with **Propiconazole** 25% EC (1 ml/L of water).
    *   For *Sclerotium rolfsii* (collar rot), drench with **Validamycin** 3% L (2 ml/L of water).
    *   For general fungal rot, **Copper Oxychloride** 50% WP (3 g/L of water) can also be used as a soil drench.

**II. Black Rot**
Black rot is a distinct disease, often caused by *Colletotrichum capsici* or *Curvularia lunata*, leading to dark, sunken lesions on rhizomes, which can spread and cause decay.

**A. Cultural and Agronomic Practices:**
*   Similar to Rhizome Rot, use healthy planting material and practice good field sanitation.
*   Avoid injuring rhizomes during cultivation.

**B. Biological Control:**
*   **_Trichoderma viride_** or **_Trichoderma harzianum_** as rhizome treatment and soil application can offer some protection.

**C. Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved):**
1.  **Rhizome Treatment (Pre-planting):**
    *   Dip rhizomes for 30 minutes in a solution of **Carbendazim** 12% + **Mancozeb** 63% WP (2 g/L of water) or **Propiconazole** 25% EC (1 ml/L of water).
2.  **Foliar Spray/Soil Drench (if symptoms appear):**
    *   For systemic control, spray or drench with **Propiconazole** 25% EC (1 ml/L of water).
    *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP (1 g/L of water) can also be used as a drench or spray.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully, including dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
*   Integrated Disease Management (IDM), combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods, is the most effective approach for sustainable disease control.
