As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing fungal diseases in Turmeric in Haryana.

Effective management of fungal diseases in Turmeric involves a combination of cultural practices and timely application of CIBRC approved fungicides.

**General Management Principles for Fungal Diseases in Turmeric:**

1.  **Use Healthy Planting Material:** Always use disease-free rhizomes from a reliable source.
2.  **Rhizome Treatment:** Before planting, treat rhizomes to protect against soil-borne pathogens.
    *   Dip rhizomes in a solution of **Carbendazim** (1 g/L water) or **Metalaxyl + Mancozeb** (2 g/L water) for 30 minutes.
3.  **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris from the field to reduce inoculum.
4.  **Proper Spacing:** Maintain adequate plant spacing (e.g., 30 cm x 20 cm) to ensure good air circulation, which reduces humidity and fungal growth.
5.  **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced fertilizers. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can make plants more susceptible to some fungal diseases.
6.  **Irrigation Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation late in the day, as prolonged leaf wetness promotes fungal development. Drip irrigation is preferable.
7.  **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops to break the disease cycle.

**Specific Fungal Diseases and Their Control in Turmeric:**

**1. Alternaria Leaf Spot, Anthracnose, Blight (Leaf Blight), Brown Spot:**
These are common leaf spot and blight diseases in Turmeric, often caused by fungi like *Alternaria*, *Colletotrichum*, *Curvularia*, and *Cercospora*. Symptoms include various spots, lesions, and blighting of leaves.

*   **Foliar Spray Recommendations (Apply at first sign of disease and repeat every 10-15 days as needed):**
    *   **Mancozeb:** 2.5 g/L water
    *   **Carbendazim:** 1 g/L water
    *   **Propiconazole:** 1 ml/L water
    *   **Azoxystrobin:** 0.5-1 ml/L water
    *   **Tebuconazole:** 0.75-1 ml/L water
    *   **Difenoconazole:** 0.5 ml/L water
    *   **Carbendazim + Mancozeb (combination product):** 2 g/L water

**2. Rhizome Blight/Rot:**
This is a serious disease, often caused by *Pythium*, *Phytophthora*, *Fusarium*, or *Rhizoctonia*, leading to rotting of rhizomes.

*   **Rhizome Treatment (Pre-planting):**
    *   Dip rhizomes in a solution of **Carbendazim** (1 g/L water) or **Metalaxyl + Mancozeb** (2 g/L water) for 30 minutes.
*   **Field Application (If disease appears in the field):**
    *   **Metalaxyl + Mancozeb:** 2 g/L water (drench around the base of affected plants)
    *   **Copper Oxychloride:** 3 g/L water (drench around the base of affected plants)

**3. Blast:**
This is not known to affect Turmeric.

**4. Downy Mildew:**
This is not known to affect Turmeric.

**5. Powdery Mildew:**
This is not known to affect Turmeric.

**6. Grey Mildew:**
This is not known to affect Turmeric.

Always ensure thorough coverage when spraying and follow the manufacturer's instructions for safety and application intervals. Regular scouting of your turmeric crop is crucial for early detection and timely intervention.
