As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned conditions in Turmeric in Haryana:

**1. Dieback (Symptoms of severe Leaf Blight/Spot diseases)**

While "Dieback" is not a specific disease name for Turmeric, the symptoms of drying and death of leaves and shoots from the tip downwards can occur due to severe infections of various leaf blight or leaf spot diseases, such as those caused by *Colletotrichum capsici* (anthracnose/leaf blight) or *Taphrina maculans* (leaf spot).

**Control Measures:**

**A. Cultural Practices:**
*   Use healthy, disease-free rhizomes for planting.
*   Ensure proper field sanitation by regularly removing and destroying infected plant debris.
*   Maintain optimal plant spacing to ensure good air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce humidity and fungal growth.
*   Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, as it can promote lush, succulent growth that is more susceptible to fungal infections.
*   Ensure proper drainage in the field to prevent waterlogging, which can stress plants and make them more vulnerable to diseases.

**B. Chemical Control:**
For effective management of severe leaf blight/spot symptoms leading to "dieback," apply fungicides as soon as symptoms appear. Repeat applications at 10-15 day intervals, depending on disease severity and prevailing weather conditions. Always rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in pathogens.

*   **Mancozeb**: Apply 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L of water for foliar spray).
*   **Carbendazim**: Apply 500 g/acre (or 0.5 g/L of water for foliar spray).
*   **Propiconazole**: Apply 250 ml/acre (or 0.5 ml/L of water for foliar spray).
*   **Azoxystrobin**: Apply 200 ml/acre (or 0.5 ml/L of water for foliar spray).
*   **Hexaconazole**: Apply 250 ml/acre (or 0.5 ml/L of water for foliar spray).

**2. Twig blight**

This is not known to affect Turmeric. Turmeric is a herbaceous plant and does not have "twigs" in the botanical sense.

**3. Tikka disease**

This is not known to affect Turmeric. Tikka disease is primarily a disease of groundnut (*Arachis hypogaea*).

**Important Note:** Always read and strictly follow the label instructions for any chemical product regarding dosage, application method, pre-harvest interval, and safety precautions. For specific local recommendations, it is advisable to consult with your nearest Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or agricultural extension officer.
