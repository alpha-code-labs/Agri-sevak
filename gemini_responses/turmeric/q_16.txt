As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified fertilizer schedule for Turmeric cultivation in Haryana. Please note that **soil testing is paramount** to determine the precise nutrient requirements of your specific field and should always be the primary basis for fertilizer application. The recommendations below are general guidelines for a typical Turmeric crop in Haryana.

**I. General Recommendations & Soil Preparation:**

*   **Farm Yard Manure (FYM) / Compost:** Incorporate 8-10 tonnes per acre of well-decomposed FYM or compost into the soil at least 2-3 weeks before planting. This improves soil structure, water retention, and provides essential micronutrients.

**II. Nutrient Management Strategy:**

The total recommended nutrient doses for Turmeric are generally around 100-120 kg Nitrogen (N), 50-60 kg Phosphorus (P2O5), 100-120 kg Potassium (K2O), and 20-30 kg Sulphur (S) per acre. These are applied in splits to ensure efficient nutrient uptake by the crop.

*   **Basal Application (at planting):** Apply the full dose of Phosphorus and Sulphur, along with 1/3rd of the Nitrogen and 1/3rd of the Potassium.
*   **Top Dressing:** Apply the remaining 2/3rd of Nitrogen and Potassium in 2-3 split doses during the active growth phases of the crop.

**III. Recommended Doses of Fertilizers (per acre):**

Here are the recommended doses using CIBRC approved technical chemical names:

**A. Granular Fertilizers (Soil Application):**

**Option 1: Using Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP) and Elemental Sulphur**

*   **Basal Application (at planting):**
    *   **Di-ammonium Phosphate:** 110 kg/acre
    *   **Potassium Chloride (Muriate of Potash):** 55 kg/acre
    *   **Sulphur (90% Elemental Sulphur):** 28 kg/acre
    *   **Urea:** 60 kg/acre
*   **First Top Dressing (60-75 days after planting):**
    *   **Urea:** 60 kg/acre
    *   **Potassium Chloride (Muriate of Potash):** 60 kg/acre
*   **Second Top Dressing (90-120 days after planting):**
    *   **Urea:** 60 kg/acre
    *   **Potassium Chloride (Muriate of Potash):** 60 kg/acre

**Option 2: Using Single Super Phosphate (SSP) for Phosphorus and Sulphur**

*   **Basal Application (at planting):**
    *   **Single Super Phosphate:** 315 kg/acre
    *   **Potassium Chloride (Muriate of Potash):** 55 kg/acre
    *   **Urea:** 70 kg/acre
*   **First Top Dressing (60-75 days after planting):**
    *   **Urea:** 75 kg/acre
    *   **Potassium Chloride (Muriate of Potash):** 55 kg/acre
*   **Second Top Dressing (90-120 days after planting):**
    *   **Urea:** 75 kg/acre
    *   **Potassium Chloride (Muriate of Potash):** 55 kg/acre

**B. Nano Fertilizers (Foliar Application):**

Nano fertilizers are highly efficient and can supplement or partially replace granular fertilizers, especially during critical growth stages or nutrient stress.

*   **Nano Urea Liquid:**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml/L of water.
    *   **Application:** 2-3 sprays, starting from 45-60 days after planting, at an interval of 15-20 days, depending on crop vigor.
*   **Nano Di-ammonium Phosphate Liquid:**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml/L of water.
    *   **Application:** 2-3 sprays, particularly beneficial during early growth and rhizome development stages, at an interval of 15-20 days.

**C. NPK Complex Fertilizer:**

*   **NPK Complex Fertilizer:** The use of NPK complex fertilizers (e.g., 10:26:26, 12:32:16) can be considered as an alternative for basal application, especially if soil test recommendations suggest a specific ratio. However, applying individual fertilizers (Urea, DAP/SSP, Potash) allows for more precise nutrient management tailored to the crop's needs at different stages. Consult your soil test report for specific NPK grade recommendations.

**IV. Important Considerations:**

*   **Micronutrients:** Turmeric also requires micronutrients like Zinc, Boron, Iron, and Manganese. If your soil test indicates deficiencies, apply appropriate micronutrient fertilizers as per recommendations. A common practice is to apply **Zinc Sulphate (33% Zn)** at 10 kg/acre as a basal dose if Zn deficiency is suspected.
*   **Irrigation:** Ensure adequate and timely irrigation after fertilizer application to facilitate nutrient dissolution and uptake by the roots.
*   **Weed Control:** Keep the field free of weeds, as they compete with Turmeric for nutrients.

Always prioritize soil testing for precise and efficient nutrient management.
