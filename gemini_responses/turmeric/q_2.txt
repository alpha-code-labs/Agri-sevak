This is not known to affect Turmeric.

Rust diseases, including Black, Brown, Yellow, White, and Red rust, are not commonly reported or significant pathogens of Turmeric (*Curcuma longa*).

However, Turmeric is susceptible to other leaf diseases that might sometimes be mistaken for rusts due to the appearance of spots or discoloration. The most common leaf diseases affecting Turmeric in Haryana are:

*   **Leaf Spot (caused by *Colletotrichum capsici* or *Taphrina maculans*)**: Characterized by small, oval to irregular brown spots with a yellowish halo, which later enlarge and coalesce.
*   **Leaf Blotch (caused by *Curvularia eragrostidis*)**: Appears as irregular, brown spots, often with a purplish tinge, that spread and merge.

If you are observing symptoms on your Turmeric plants, it is advisable to send a sample to the plant pathology laboratory at HAU, Hisar, for accurate diagnosis. Once the specific disease is identified, appropriate control measures can be recommended.
