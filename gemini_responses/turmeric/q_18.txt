As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the use of Growth Regulators/Hormones and Boron in Turmeric cultivation in Haryana:

1.  **Ethephon (commonly known by the brand name Ethrel)**
    While **Ethephon** can be used for breaking dormancy in turmeric rhizomes before planting to promote early sprouting, its application as a growth regulator/hormone *during the crop cycle* for general growth enhancement or yield regulation is not a standard recommendation for Turmeric cultivation in Haryana.

2.  **2,4-D**
    This is not known to affect Turmeric as a growth regulator. **2,4-D** is primarily a selective herbicide and its application as a growth regulator/hormone in Turmeric is not recommended due to its potent herbicidal action and potential for phytotoxicity to the crop.

3.  **Boron**
    Boron is an essential micronutrient crucial for various physiological processes in Turmeric, including cell wall formation, sugar transport, and rhizome development. While not a hormone, its deficiency can severely impact growth and yield. Its application is recommended based on soil test results or if deficiency symptoms are observed.

    *   **Recommended Dose (Foliar Application):**
        *   Mix **1-2 g** of **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate) or **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** per litre of water.
        *   Spray to cover the foliage thoroughly.
        *   Apply 1-2 sprays during the active growth phase, especially before rhizome initiation, if deficiency is suspected or as a prophylactic measure in Boron-deficient soils.
