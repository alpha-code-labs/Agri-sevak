As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following cultivation practices for Turmeric in Haryana:

**Recommended Cultivation Practices for Turmeric:**

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   Turmeric is propagated vegetatively using mother rhizomes or finger rhizomes.
    *   The most common and recommended method is planting on **ridges and furrows**. This method ensures good drainage, prevents waterlogging, and facilitates better rhizome development and subsequent earthing up operations.
    *   Alternatively, planting can be done on flatbeds, followed by earthing up to form ridges as the plants grow.
    *   The rhizomes are typically planted in a single row along the centre of the ridges or in the beds.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   Rhizomes should be planted at a depth of **5-7 cm** from the soil surface. Planting too deep can delay sprouting, while planting too shallow can expose the rhizomes to drying out or bird damage.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   **Row-to-row spacing:** Maintain a distance of **45-60 cm** between rows.
    *   **Plant-to-plant spacing:** Maintain a distance of **15-25 cm** within the row.
    *   Optimal spacing ensures adequate sunlight, air circulation, and nutrient availability for individual plants, leading to better rhizome development and yield.

*   **Seed Dose (Rhizome Rate):**
    *   The seed rate depends on the size of the rhizomes used and the spacing adopted.
    *   Generally, a seed rate of **2000-2500 kg/acre** (20-25 quintals/acre) of healthy, disease-free mother rhizomes or finger rhizomes is recommended.
    *   Ensure the rhizomes used for planting are free from pests and diseases and have at least one healthy bud.
