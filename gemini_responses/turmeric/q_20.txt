Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the critical role of micronutrients in ensuring healthy growth and optimal yield of Turmeric. Deficiencies in these essential elements can significantly impact plant vigor and rhizome development.

Before any application, it is **highly recommended to conduct a comprehensive soil test** to accurately diagnose specific deficiencies and their severity. Visual symptoms can be indicative, but a soil test provides precise data for targeted nutrient management.

Here's how to address common micronutrient deficiencies in Turmeric:

### General Recommendations:

*   **Soil Application:** Generally provides a long-term solution and is best done before or at the time of planting, or as a top-dressing during active growth.
*   **Foliar Application:** Offers a quicker response, especially for acute deficiencies, as nutrients are absorbed directly by the leaves. It is often used as a corrective measure. Ensure good spray coverage and apply during cooler parts of the day (morning or late afternoon) to avoid scorching.
*   **Water Quality:** Use clean water for foliar sprays.
*   **Compatibility:** Always check the compatibility of different chemicals if mixing for foliar application.

### Specific Micronutrient Deficiencies and Management:

#### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, small and narrow leaves (little leaf), interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, sometimes bronzing of older leaves.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   Apply 10-25 kg/acre of **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (21% Zn) or 6-10 kg/acre of **Zinc sulphate monohydrate** (33% Zn) at the time of planting or as a basal dose.
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray 0.5% solution (5 g/L of water) of **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (21% Zn) or 0.1% solution (1 g/L of water) of **Zinc EDTA** (12% Zn). Repeat after 15-20 days if symptoms persist.

#### 2. Iron (Fe) / Ferrous Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Prominent interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, with veins remaining distinctly green. In severe cases, leaves may turn completely yellow or white.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   Apply 20-50 kg/acre of **Ferrous sulphate** (19% Fe) or 5-10 kg/acre of **Ferrous EDTA** (12% Fe) as a basal dose, especially in alkaline soils.
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray 0.5-1% solution (5-10 g/L of water) of **Ferrous sulphate** (19% Fe) or 0.1% solution (1 g/L of water) of **Ferrous EDTA** (12% Fe). Add a suitable wetting agent for better absorption. Repeat after 10-15 days if needed.

#### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, thickening and brittleness of young leaves, cracking of rhizomes, poor rhizome development, and sometimes internal browning of rhizomes.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   Apply 4-8 kg/acre of **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate, 10.5% B) or 2-4 kg/acre of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (20% B) as a basal dose.
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray 0.1-0.2% solution (1-2 g/L of water) of **Borax** (10.5% B) or **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (20% B). Apply during active growth stages.

#### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, distortion and necrosis (death) of young leaves and growing points, poor root development. This is less common as a primary deficiency in Turmeric but can occur in very acidic soils or under specific stress conditions.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   For soil amendment and calcium supply, apply **Gypsum** (Calcium sulphate dihydrate) as per soil test recommendations (typically 200-500 kg/acre for soil improvement, or 10-20 kg/acre of **Calcium nitrate**).
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray 0.5-1% solution (5-10 g/L of water) of **Calcium nitrate** or 0.2-0.4% solution (2-4 g/L of water) of **Calcium chloride**.

#### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, with veins remaining green. Leaves may become brittle and curl upwards.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   Apply 10-20 kg/acre of **Magnesium sulphate** (Epsom salt, 9.6% Mg) as a basal dose or top-dressing.
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray 1-2% solution (10-20 g/L of water) of **Magnesium sulphate** (9.6% Mg). Repeat after 15-20 days if necessary.

#### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, often appearing as a fine network of green veins on a lighter background, sometimes with small necrotic spots.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   Apply 5-10 kg/acre of **Manganese sulphate** (28-30% Mn) as a basal dose.
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Spray 0.5% solution (5 g/L of water) of **Manganese sulphate** (28-30% Mn) or 0.1% solution (1 g/L of water) of **Manganese EDTA** (12% Mn). Repeat after 15-20 days if symptoms persist.

### Important Considerations:

*   **Soil pH:** The availability of many micronutrients is highly dependent on soil pH. For instance, Iron, Manganese, Zinc, and Boron become less available in alkaline (high pH) soils, which are common in parts of Haryana. Adjusting soil pH, if feasible and necessary, can improve nutrient uptake.
*   **Organic Matter:** Maintaining good soil organic matter content through farmyard manure (FYM) or compost application significantly improves micronutrient availability and overall soil health.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management:** Always adopt an integrated approach combining organic and inorganic nutrient sources for sustainable and healthy crop production.
