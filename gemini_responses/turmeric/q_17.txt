Organic manures are vital for enhancing soil health, fertility, and overall productivity in Turmeric cultivation, especially under Haryana's agro-climatic conditions. They improve soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability, leading to better rhizome development and yield.

Here are the recommended doses for Turmeric:

*   **Farm Yard Manure (FYM):**
    *   **Dose:** 15-20 tonnes per acre.
    *   **Application:** Incorporate thoroughly into the soil during land preparation, at least 2-3 weeks before planting the rhizomes. Ensure the FYM is well-decomposed to prevent the introduction of weeds, pests, or diseases.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   **Dose:** 3-5 tonnes per acre.
    *   **Application:** Can be applied during land preparation along with FYM, or as a partial top-dressing around the plants 45-60 days after planting.

*   **Sagarika (IFFCO product - Seaweed extract based bio-stimulant):**
    *   **Granular Form (for soil application):**
        *   **Dose:** 8-10 kg per acre.
        *   **Application:** Apply as a basal dose at the time of planting or broadcasting evenly and incorporating into the soil.
    *   **Liquid Form (for foliar spray):**
        *   **Dose:** 250-500 ml per acre, diluted in 150-200 litres of water.
        *   **Application:** Spray at critical growth stages, typically 30-45 days after planting and again 60-75 days after planting, or as per specific product recommendations for crop stages.
