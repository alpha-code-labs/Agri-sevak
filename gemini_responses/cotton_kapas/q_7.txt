As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I must provide scientifically verified advice specific to Cotton (Kapas) cultivation in Haryana.

Regarding the diseases you mentioned:

*   **Dieback:** This is not known to affect Cotton (Kapas) as a primary, distinct disease. While general plant decline or drying of branches (dieback symptoms) can occur due to various stresses like nutrient deficiencies, waterlogging, drought, or secondary infections following insect damage, a specific disease named "Dieback" is not a recognized major disease of cotton.
*   **Twig blight:** This is not known to affect Cotton (Kapas) as a primary, distinct disease. Similar to dieback, general blight-like symptoms on twigs might occur due to severe environmental stress or other underlying issues, but "Twig blight" is not a standard, recognized disease of cotton.
*   **Tikka disease:** This is not known to affect Cotton (Kapas). Tikka disease is a common leaf spot disease primarily affecting groundnut (peanut).
