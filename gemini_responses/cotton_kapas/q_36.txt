As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified practices to improve yield, fruit quality (fiber quality), and storage life of Cotton (Kapas) in Haryana. It is crucial to emphasize that soil testing is the foundation for precise nutrient management, and Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approaches should always be prioritized.

### 1. Improving Yield

Optimizing yield involves a combination of genetic potential, robust plant health, and effective resource management.

*   **Variety Selection:** Choose high-yielding, locally adapted, and disease-resistant varieties recommended by HAU for your specific agro-climatic zone.
*   **Sowing Time and Method:** Adhere to recommended sowing windows and methods (e.g., ridge-furrow system) for optimal plant establishment and growth.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Based on soil test reports, ensure balanced application of macro and micronutrients.
    *   **Nitrogen (N):** Apply in 2-3 splits to match plant demand, typically 60-80 kg N/acre.
    *   **Phosphorus (P):** Apply 20-25 kg P2O5/acre as basal.
    *   **Potassium (K):** Apply 20-25 kg K2O/acre as basal, especially critical for boll development and fiber quality.
    *   **Micronutrients:**
        *   **Zinc (Zn):** If deficient, apply **Zinc sulphate** (20-25 kg/acre) as basal or foliar spray of **Zinc sulphate** (0.5% solution, i.e., 5 g/L water) or **Zinc EDTA** (0.1% solution, i.e., 1 g/L water) at squaring and flowering stages.
        *   **Boron (B):** If deficient, foliar spray of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (1-1.5 g/L water) at squaring and flowering.
*   **Water Management:** Provide critical irrigations during squaring, flowering, and boll development stages. Avoid both water stress and waterlogging.
*   **Weed Management:** Control weeds effectively to minimize competition for nutrients and water.
    *   **Pre-emergence:** Apply **Pendimethalin** (1.0 kg a.i./acre) within 2-3 days of sowing.
    *   **Post-emergence (for specific weeds):**
        *   For broad-leaf weeds: **Pyrithiobac sodium** (62.5 g a.i./acre).
        *   For grassy weeds: **Quizalofop-p-ethyl** (50 g a.i./acre).
*   **Pest Management:** Timely and effective control of major pests is crucial.
    *   **Sucking Pests (Jassids, Aphids, Whitefly):**
        *   **Imidacloprid** (125-150 ml/acre of 17.8% SL formulation).
        *   **Thiamethoxam** (100-125 g/acre of 25% WG formulation).
        *   **Flonicamid** (150-200 g/acre of 50% WG formulation).
        *   For Whitefly: **Spiromesifen** (200-250 ml/acre of 22.9% SC formulation).
    *   **Bollworms (Pink Bollworm, American Bollworm, Spotted Bollworm):**
        *   **Chlorantraniliprole** (60-80 ml/acre of 18.5% SC formulation).
        *   **Emamectin benzoate** (80-100 g/acre of 5% SG formulation).
        *   **Indoxacarb** (200-250 ml/acre of 14.5% SC formulation).
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** (100-125 ml/acre of 5% EC formulation) (use judiciously to prevent resistance development).
*   **Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs):** To manage excessive vegetative growth and promote fruiting.
    *   Apply **Mepiquat chloride** (50-75 g a.i./acre, typically 250-375 ml of 23.5% SL formulation) at peak flowering to control plant height and encourage boll retention.

### 2. Improving Fruit Quality (Fiber Quality)

Fiber quality (length, strength, fineness, maturity) is directly linked to plant health and nutrient status during boll development.

*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Adequate and balanced supply of all nutrients, especially Potassium and Boron, is critical.
    *   **Potassium (K):** Ensure sufficient K supply throughout the growing season. Foliar sprays of **Potassium nitrate** (1-2% solution, i.e., 10-20 g/L water) during boll development can significantly improve fiber quality.
    *   **Boron (B):** As mentioned for yield, foliar application of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (1-1.5 g/L water) improves boll retention and development, leading to better quality fibers.
    *   **Sulphur (S):** Apply **Sulphur** (20-25 kg/acre) as elemental sulphur or gypsum if soil tests indicate deficiency, as it plays a role in protein synthesis and overall plant vigor.
*   **Pest and Disease Control:** Damage from pests (especially bollworms) and diseases can severely degrade fiber quality by causing immature bolls, staining, or physical damage. Follow the pest management strategies outlined above.
*   **Timely Harvesting:** Harvest bolls when they are fully mature and open. Immature bolls yield weak and short fibers. Avoid harvesting bolls that are wet from dew or rain.
*   **Avoid Contamination:** Ensure clean picking practices to prevent contamination with trash, leaves, and other foreign matter, which can reduce lint quality.

### 3. Improving Storage Life

The storage life of harvested cotton (kapas or ginned lint) depends on its initial quality and storage conditions.

*   **Proper Harvesting and Drying:**
    *   Harvest only fully opened, dry bolls. Avoid harvesting wet cotton.
    *   Ensure harvested kapas is dried to an optimal moisture content (typically 8-10%) before ginning and storage. Excess moisture leads to heating, fungal growth, and fiber degradation.
*   **Cleanliness:** Minimize trash, leaves, and other foreign matter during picking and ginning. Clean cotton stores better and is less prone to pest infestation.
*   **Storage Environment:**
    *   Store ginned lint or kapas in a cool, dry, well-ventilated warehouse.
    *   Protect from direct sunlight, rain, and ground moisture.
    *   Stack bales or kapas bags on wooden pallets to ensure air circulation and prevent moisture absorption from the floor.
    *   Maintain good hygiene in the storage area to prevent rodent and insect infestation.
*   **Pest Control in Storage:**
    *   Regularly inspect stored cotton for signs of insect pests (e.g., pink bollworm larvae, stored product pests) or rodents.
    *   If infestation occurs, fumigation with **Aluminium phosphide** (as per manufacturer's instructions and strict safety guidelines) may be necessary for sealed storage. Ensure proper ventilation after fumigation.

By diligently following these recommendations, farmers can significantly enhance cotton yield, improve fiber quality, and extend the storage life of their produce, leading to better market returns.
