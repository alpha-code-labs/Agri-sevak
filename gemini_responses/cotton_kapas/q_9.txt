Mites, including Red spider mite (Tetranychus urticae) and Rust mite (Aceria gossypii), are known to affect Cotton (Kapas) and can cause significant damage, especially during dry and hot periods. Effective management requires timely intervention.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Mites in Cotton:**
*   **Regular Scouting:** Frequently inspect the undersides of cotton leaves for the presence of mites and their damage symptoms (e.g., reddish-brown spots, webbing for red spider mites; bronzing/rusting for rust mites).
*   **Water Management:** Ensure adequate irrigation, as water stress can exacerbate mite infestations.
*   **Natural Enemies:** Protect and encourage natural predators like predatory mites, ladybird beetles, and lacewings, which can help keep mite populations in check.

**Chemical Control (Acaricides):**
When mite populations reach economic threshold levels, chemical control becomes necessary. Always ensure thorough spray coverage, particularly on the undersides of the leaves where mites primarily reside. To prevent the development of resistance, it is crucial to rotate acaricides with different modes of action.

Here are some CIBRC approved acaricides recommended for mite control in Cotton (Kapas):

*   **Spiromesifen** (e.g., 22.9% SC formulation): Apply 200-250 ml per acre in 200-250 litres of water.
*   **Propargite** (e.g., 57% EC formulation): Apply 1.0-1.5 litres per acre in 200-250 litres of water.
*   **Fenpyroximate** (e.g., 5% SC formulation): Apply 250-300 ml per acre in 200-250 litres of water.
*   **Pyridaben** (e.g., 20% WP formulation): Apply 250-375 g per acre in 200-250 litres of water.
*   **Abamectin** (e.g., 1.9% EC formulation): Apply 200-300 ml per acre in 200-250 litres of water.
*   **Spirotetramat** (e.g., 150 OD formulation): Apply 200-300 ml per acre in 200-250 litres of water. (While primarily effective against sucking pests, it also provides good control of mites).

**Important Advisory:**
*   Always read and strictly follow the instructions and safety precautions mentioned on the product label.
*   Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying operations.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for the most current and specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and the prevailing pest situation.
