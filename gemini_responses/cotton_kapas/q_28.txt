As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the critical importance of protecting Cotton (Kapas) from environmental stresses to ensure optimal yield and quality. Cotton is a sensitive crop, and extreme weather conditions can significantly impact its growth and productivity. Here's scientifically verified advice for managing environmental stress in Cotton (Kapas) in Haryana:

**General Measures (Applicable to all stresses):**

*   **Variety Selection:** Choose cotton varieties known for their resilience and adaptability to local climatic fluctuations. Consult HAU recommendations for suitable varieties for Haryana.
*   **Optimal Sowing Time:** Adhere strictly to the recommended sowing window (typically April-May in Haryana) to allow the crop to establish and mature before the onset of severe winter cold or the most intense summer heat.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure adequate and balanced nutrient supply, especially **Potassium**, which plays a crucial role in improving overall plant vigor and tolerance to various stresses.
*   **Efficient Water Management:** Timely and appropriate irrigation is fundamental to mitigating all forms of environmental stress.

**Specific Measures for Environmental Stresses:**

**1. Extreme Cold and Frost:**
Cotton is highly susceptible to cold and frost, which can cause severe damage, especially during flowering and boll development.

*   **Irrigation:** Provide light irrigation before an anticipated cold wave or frost event. This helps raise the soil temperature and increases humidity around the plants, reducing frost damage.
*   **Foliar Sprays:**
    *   **Potassium Nitrate:** Spray 1-2% solution (10-20 g/L of water) to improve cold tolerance and osmotic regulation.
    *   **Thioureau:** Apply a foliar spray of 0.05-0.1% solution (0.5-1 g/L of water) to enhance cold tolerance and aid recovery.
    *   **Glycine Betaine:** Spray 0.1-0.2% solution (1-2 g/L of water) as an osmoprotectant to protect cell membranes from cold damage.

**2. Heat (Loo) and Intense Sunlight:**
High temperatures, hot winds (Loo), and intense sunlight can lead to flower and square shedding, reduced photosynthesis, and boll scorching.

*   **Irrigation:** Maintain adequate soil moisture through light and frequent irrigations during peak heat periods to cool the plant canopy and prevent wilting.
*   **Mulching:** Apply organic mulch (e.g., crop residues) around the base of plants to reduce soil temperature, conserve moisture, and suppress weeds.
*   **Foliar Sprays:**
    *   **Kaolin:** Spray 5-6% solution (50-60 g/L of water) to create a reflective film on leaves, reducing leaf temperature and sunburn.
    *   **Potassium Nitrate:** Spray 1-2% solution (10-20 g/L of water) to help in osmotic adjustment and water regulation, improving heat tolerance.
    *   **Glycine Betaine:** Apply 0.1-0.2% solution (1-2 g/L of water) to protect cellular structures from heat-induced damage.
    *   **Salicylic Acid:** Spray 0.005-0.01% solution (0.05-0.1 g/L of water) to induce systemic acquired tolerance to heat stress.
    *   **24-Epibrassinolide:** Apply a foliar spray at recommended concentrations (typically 1-5 mg/L of water, depending on formulation) to enhance overall stress tolerance and promote growth under adverse conditions.
