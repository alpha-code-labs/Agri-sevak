As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified recommendations for the use of growth regulators/hormones and micronutrients in Cotton (Kapas) in Haryana:

### Recommended Doses for Cotton (Kapas)

1.  **Ethrel (Ethephon)**
    *   **Purpose:** Used for boll opening and defoliation in mature cotton plants, typically towards the end of the season to facilitate mechanical harvesting or uniform boll opening.
    *   **Recommendation:** Apply **Ethephon** (39% SL formulation) at a dose of **1000-1250 ml per acre**, mixed in 200-250 litres of water. This should be applied when approximately 40-50% of the bolls have naturally opened and the remaining bolls are mature.

2.  **2,4-D**
    *   **This is not known to affect Cotton (Kapas) beneficially as a growth regulator.**
    *   **2,4-D** is a broad-spectrum herbicide and is **not recommended** for application on Cotton (Kapas) as a growth regulator. Cotton is extremely sensitive to **2,4-D**, and even minute drift from nearby applications can cause severe phytotoxicity, leading to leaf malformations, flower and boll shedding, and significant yield losses. Its use on cotton is highly detrimental.

3.  **Boron**
    *   **Purpose:** Boron is an essential micronutrient critical for pollen germination, fertilization, flower and boll retention, and overall fruit development in cotton. Its deficiency can lead to shedding of flowers and young bolls.
    *   **Recommendation (Foliar Application):** Apply **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (containing 20% Boron) at a dose of **100-150 grams per acre**, mixed in 200 litres of water.
    *   **Timing:** This foliar application is recommended during the flowering and early boll development stages to ensure adequate Boron availability when demand is highest. Multiple applications may be beneficial depending on soil test results and visual deficiency symptoms.
