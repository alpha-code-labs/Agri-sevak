Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the critical role of micronutrients in achieving optimal yields and quality in Cotton (Kapas). Deficiencies can significantly impact plant health and productivity. It is always recommended to conduct a soil test to accurately diagnose specific deficiencies before applying any corrective measures.

Here's how to address the common micronutrient deficiencies in Cotton (Kapas):

### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

Zinc is vital for enzyme activity, protein synthesis, and growth regulation. Deficiency symptoms include stunted growth, small leaves (little leaf), and interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves.

*   **Foliar Application:**
    *   Spray **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (21% Zn) at 5 g/L of water (0.5% solution).
    *   Alternatively, spray **Zinc EDTA** (12% Zn) at 1 g/L of water (0.1% solution).
    *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, starting when symptoms appear or as a preventive measure during active growth.
*   **Soil Application (if severe deficiency confirmed by soil test):**
    *   Apply **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** at 10-12 kg/acre at the time of sowing or before transplanting.

### 2. Iron (Fe) / Ferrous Deficiency

Iron is crucial for chlorophyll formation and photosynthesis. Deficiency leads to distinct interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins, with veins remaining green) primarily on younger leaves.

*   **Foliar Application:**
    *   Spray **Ferrous sulphate** (19% Fe) at 5 g/L of water (0.5% solution).
    *   Alternatively, spray **Iron EDTA** (12% Fe) at 1 g/L of water (0.1% solution).
    *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, targeting the affected young foliage.

### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

Boron is essential for cell wall formation, sugar transport, pollen viability, and fruit/boll development. Deficiency can cause stunted growth, poor boll development, shedding of squares and young bolls, and sometimes cracked stems or petioles.

*   **Foliar Application:**
    *   Spray **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (20% B) at 1-1.5 g/L of water (0.1-0.15% solution).
    *   Apply at the flowering and early boll development stages to ensure proper boll setting and development.
*   **Soil Application (only if severe deficiency is confirmed by soil test):**
    *   Apply **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate, 10.5-11.3% B) at 2-4 kg/acre at the time of sowing. *Caution: Boron can be toxic if over-applied, so precise application based on soil test is critical.*

### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

Calcium is vital for cell wall structure, membrane integrity, and root growth. Deficiency can lead to necrosis of terminal buds, stunted growth, and poor boll filling, especially under conditions of high potassium or water stress.

*   **Foliar Application:**
    *   Spray **Calcium chloride** (27% Ca) at 5 g/L of water (0.5% solution).
    *   Alternatively, spray **Calcium nitrate** (19% Ca) at 5 g/L of water (0.5% solution).
    *   Apply during flowering and boll development stages to support boll formation and quality.

### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

Magnesium is the central atom in the chlorophyll molecule and is crucial for photosynthesis. Deficiency typically appears as interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, with veins remaining green, sometimes followed by a purplish tinge in severe cases.

*   **Foliar Application:**
    *   Spray **Magnesium sulphate** (Epsom salt, 9.6% Mg) at 5 g/L of water (0.5% solution).
    *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, focusing on the older leaves showing symptoms.
*   **Soil Application (if severe deficiency confirmed by soil test):**
    *   Apply **Magnesium sulphate** at 10-15 kg/acre at the time of sowing.

### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

Manganese plays a role in photosynthesis, respiration, and nitrogen metabolism. Deficiency symptoms are similar to iron, showing interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, often with a finer network of green veins.

*   **Foliar Application:**
    *   Spray **Manganese sulphate** (28-30% Mn) at 5 g/L of water (0.5% solution).
    *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, targeting the affected young foliage.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Soil Testing:** Always prioritize soil testing to confirm specific deficiencies and determine the appropriate application rates. Blind application can lead to nutrient imbalances or toxicity.
*   **Timing:** Early detection and timely application of micronutrients are crucial for effective correction and preventing yield losses.
*   **Water Quality:** Use clean water for preparing spray solutions.
*   **Compatibility:** Avoid mixing different micronutrient solutions or with other pesticides unless compatibility is confirmed.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management:** Micronutrient application should be part of an integrated nutrient management strategy, considering the overall soil health and macronutrient status.
