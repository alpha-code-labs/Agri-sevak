As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Scale insects and Mealybugs in Cotton (Kapas) in Haryana:

Both Scale insects and Mealybugs are sucking pests that can cause significant damage to cotton by feeding on plant sap, leading to stunted growth, wilting, and reduced yield. Mealybugs, in particular, excrete honeydew, which promotes sooty mould growth, interfering with photosynthesis.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Approach:**

1.  **Regular Monitoring:** Regularly inspect cotton plants, especially the undersides of leaves, stems, and bolls, for the presence of scale insects (often appearing as small, immobile bumps) and mealybug colonies (white, cottony masses). Early detection is crucial for effective control.
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Weed Management:** Remove alternate host plants (weeds) from the field and surrounding areas, as they can harbor these pests.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infested plant debris after harvest to reduce carry-over populations.
    *   **Avoid Excessive Nitrogen:** High nitrogen fertilization can lead to lush growth, which may favor pest multiplication.
3.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Conserve natural enemies such as parasitoids (*Aenasius bambawalei* for mealybugs) and predators like ladybird beetles, lacewings, and hoverflies, which feed on these pests. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

**Chemical Control (When pest incidence crosses Economic Threshold Level):**

For effective chemical control, ensure thorough spray coverage, especially targeting the undersides of leaves and stem junctions where these pests often aggregate. Use sufficient water volume (e.g., 200-250 litres per acre) to ensure good penetration and coverage. Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

The following CIBRC approved technical chemicals are recommended:

*   **For Scale Insects and Mealybugs:**
    *   **Buprofezin** (25% SC) @ 500-600 ml/acre
    *   **Spirotetramat** (150 OD) @ 150-200 ml/acre
    *   **Dinotefuran** (20% SG) @ 80-100 g/acre
    *   **Flonicamid** (50% WG) @ 60-80 g/acre

*   **For Mealybugs (also effective against other sucking pests):**
    *   **Imidacloprid** (17.8% SL) @ 40-50 ml/acre
    *   **Acetamiprid** (20% SP) @ 80-100 g/acre
    *   **Thiamethoxam** (25% WG) @ 40-50 g/acre

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label for specific dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Consult your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for the most current recommendations and to confirm the economic threshold levels for your specific region and cotton variety.
