As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide scientifically verified advice for controlling various rot types in Cotton (Kapas) relevant to Haryana.

Rot diseases in cotton can significantly impact yield and quality. Many of the rot types you've listed are caused by a complex of soil-borne fungal pathogens, especially during the early growth stages.

### **1. Seed Rot, Seedling Rot, Root Rot, Stem Rot, Foot Rot, Collar Rot, and Crown Rot**

These early-season and soil-borne rots are often caused by a group of common pathogens including *Rhizoctonia solani*, *Pythium spp.*, *Fusarium spp.*, *Macrophomina phaseolina* (causing charcoal rot), and *Sclerotium rolfsii*. They affect the seed, hypocotyl, roots, and stem base, leading to poor germination, damping-off, wilting, and plant death.

**Integrated Management Strategies:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Resistant Varieties:** Choose cotton varieties known to have tolerance or resistance to common soil-borne diseases prevalent in your area.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Practice rotation with non-host crops (e.g., cereals like wheat, maize) for at least 2-3 years to reduce pathogen inoculum in the soil.
    *   **Deep Summer Ploughing:** Expose soil-borne pathogens to scorching summer sun, which helps in their reduction.
    *   **Balanced Nutrition:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can promote lush growth susceptible to disease. Ensure adequate phosphorus and potassium.
    *   **Proper Irrigation:** Avoid waterlogging, especially during germination and early seedling stages. Irrigate judiciously based on soil moisture.
    *   **Timely Sowing:** Sow seeds at the optimal time when soil temperatures are favorable for rapid germination and seedling establishment.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris from previous crops.

*   **Biological Control:**
    *   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds with bio-agents like *Trichoderma viride* or *Trichoderma harzianum* at 4-5 g/kg seed. These fungi colonize the root zone and suppress pathogenic fungi.
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply *Trichoderma viride* or *Trichoderma harzianum* (2.5 kg/acre mixed with 50 kg farmyard manure) at the time of sowing or transplanting.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Seed Treatment (Crucial for early-season rots):**
        *   **Carbendazim** (1 g/kg seed) + **Thiram** (2 g/kg seed)
        *   **Pyraclostrobin** + **Fluxapyroxad** (e.g., 1-2 ml/kg seed, as per product label)
        *   **Metalaxyl-M** + **Difenoconazole** (e.g., 1-2 ml/kg seed, as per product label)
        *   **Tebuconazole** (e.g., 1-2 ml/kg seed)
    *   **Soil Drench (for localized outbreaks or early symptoms):**
        *   **Carbendazim** at 1-2 g/L water, applied around the base of affected plants.
        *   **Propiconazole** at 1 ml/L water, applied around the base of affected plants.
        *   **Hexaconazole** at 1 ml/L water, applied around the base of affected plants.

### **2. Fruit Rot (Boll Rot)**

Boll rot in cotton is a complex disease caused by various fungi (*Colletotrichum gossypii*, *Fusarium spp.*, *Alternaria spp.*, *Rhizopus spp.*, *Aspergillus spp.*) and bacteria (*Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. malvacearum* - bacterial blight). It leads to rotting of bolls, lint discoloration, and significant yield losses.

**Integrated Management Strategies:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Proper Plant Spacing:** Maintain recommended plant spacing to ensure good air circulation within the canopy, which reduces humidity and fungal growth.
    *   **Avoid Excessive Nitrogen:** High nitrogen levels lead to dense foliage, creating a humid microclimate favorable for boll rot.
    *   **Timely Irrigation:** Avoid overhead irrigation late in the day, which keeps foliage wet for prolonged periods.
    *   **Removal of Diseased Bolls:** Regularly scout the field and remove and destroy any bolls showing symptoms of rot to reduce inoculum.
    *   **Pruning:** In some systems, light pruning of lower leaves can improve air circulation, but this should be done carefully and based on local recommendations for your variety.

*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Sprays):**
    *   **For Fungal Boll Rot:**
        *   **Propiconazole** at 1 ml/L water (200 L spray volume per acre).
        *   **Difenoconazole** at 0.5 ml/L water (200 L spray volume per acre).
        *   **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5 ml/L water (200 L spray volume per acre).
        *   **Pyraclostrobin** at 0.5 ml/L water (200 L spray volume per acre).
        *   **Mancozeb** at 2 g/L water (200 L spray volume per acre).
        *   Apply sprays preventively during boll development, especially if humid conditions prevail or after heavy rains. Repeat at 10-15 day intervals if necessary.
    *   **For Bacterial Boll Rot (Bacterial Blight):**
        *   **Streptomycin sulfate** (6 g) + **Tetracycline hydrochloride** (1.5 g) per 10 L water.
        *   **Copper oxychloride** at 2.5 g/L water.
        *   These can be used if bacterial blight is a significant component of the boll rot complex.

### **3. Black Rot**

This is not known to affect Cotton (Kapas). Black rot is primarily a disease of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower) caused by *Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris*, or grapes caused by *Guignardia bidwellii*.

**General Recommendations:**

*   **Integrated Disease Management (IDM):** Always combine cultural, biological, and chemical methods for sustainable and effective disease control.
*   **Field Monitoring:** Regularly scout your fields to detect disease symptoms early, allowing for timely intervention.
*   **Consult Experts:** For specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and the latest CIBRC approved products, always consult with local agricultural extension officers or HAU experts.
