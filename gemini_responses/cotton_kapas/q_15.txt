As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), here is the scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Cotton (Kapas):

**1. Grasshopper:**
Grasshoppers can cause damage to cotton foliage, especially in early stages.
*   **Cultural Control:** Maintain field sanitation and remove weeds that can serve as alternate hosts.
*   **Chemical Control (for severe infestations):**
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 4.9% CS: 100-125 ml per acre
    *   **Malathion** 50% EC: 500 ml per acre

**2. Painted bug:**
This is not known to affect Cotton (Kapas).

**3. Red cotton bug:**
Red cotton bugs are significant pests of cotton, damaging developing bolls and seeds.
*   **Cultural Control:** Remove cotton plant debris after harvest and destroy alternate host plants.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Acephate** 75% SP: 250-300 g per acre
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 4.9% CS: 100-125 ml per acre
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: 40-50 ml per acre

**4. Black ants:**
