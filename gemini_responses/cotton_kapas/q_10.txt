As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for managing pests in Cotton (Kapas) in Haryana:

**1. Borers and Caterpillars in Cotton (Kapas)**

Cotton is susceptible to various borers (primarily bollworms like American bollworm, Pink bollworm, Spotted bollworm) and defoliating caterpillars (like Tobacco caterpillar). Effective management requires timely monitoring and judicious use of CIBRC approved insecticides, often in rotation to prevent resistance development.

**Recommended Insecticides for Borers and Caterpillars:**

*   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC: 60 ml per acre
*   **Flubendiamide** 20% WG: 50 g per acre
*   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG: 88-100 g per acre
*   **Indoxacarb** 14.5% SC: 200 ml per acre
*   **Spinetoram** 11.7% SC: 120-150 ml per acre
*   **Novaluron** 10% EC: 500 ml per acre (Insect Growth Regulator, effective against early instars)
*   **Lufenuron** 5.4% EC: 240 ml per acre (Insect Growth Regulator, effective against early instars)
*   **Thiodicarb** 75% WP: 500 g per acre (Particularly effective against *Spodoptera* and bollworms)
*   **Profenofos** 50% EC: 1000 ml per acre (Contact and stomach action, often used in rotation)

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Monitoring:** Regularly scout your fields to identify pest incidence and population levels. Apply insecticides only when pest populations reach economic threshold levels.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in pest populations. Avoid repeated use of the same chemical group.
*   **Timing:** Apply insecticides during the early larval stages for best efficacy.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and fruiting bodies.
*   **Integrated Pest Management (IPM):** Combine chemical control with cultural practices (e.g., timely sowing, proper nutrient management, destruction of crop residues), biological control (e.g., conservation of natural enemies), and use of pheromone traps for monitoring.

**2. Diamondback Moth (DBM)**

This is not known to affect Cotton (Kapas). Diamondback moth (*Plutella xylostella*) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops like cabbage, cauliflower, and mustard.

**3. Leaf Folder**

This is not known to affect Cotton (Kapas). The common leaf folder (*Cnaphalocrocis medinalis*) is primarily a pest of rice. While some general leaf-folding caterpillars might occasionally be observed, *Cnaphalocrocis medinalis* is not a significant pest of cotton.

**General Advice:**

Always refer to the latest recommendations from Haryana Agricultural University (HAU) or the Department of Agriculture, Haryana, and strictly follow the instructions on the pesticide label for dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
