As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling physical damage in Cotton (Kapas) in Haryana:

It is important to understand that these "physical damages" are often symptoms of underlying environmental stresses, nutrient imbalances, or improper agricultural practices rather than direct diseases or pests. Therefore, control measures focus on managing these factors.

### 1. Fruit Bursting (Boll Bursting/Cracking)

Fruit bursting in cotton bolls is primarily caused by sudden fluctuations in soil moisture, nutrient deficiencies (especially Boron and Calcium), and sometimes genetic predisposition of the variety.

**Causes:**
*   **Moisture Stress:** Prolonged dry spells followed by heavy irrigation or rainfall can lead to rapid water uptake, causing internal pressure and bursting.
*   **Nutrient Deficiency:** Insufficient Boron and Calcium can weaken the boll wall integrity.
*   **Temperature Fluctuations:** Extreme day-night temperature differences can also contribute.

**Control Measures:**
*   **Irrigation Management:** Maintain consistent soil moisture throughout the boll development stage. Avoid extremes of drought and waterlogging. Apply light and frequent irrigations rather than heavy, infrequent ones.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure balanced nutrition, particularly adequate supply of micronutrients.
    *   **Foliar Spray for Boron Deficiency:**
        *   Spray **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (e.g., Solubor) at 1.5-2.0 g/L of water, or **Sodium tetraborate decahydrate** (Borax) at 3-4 g/L of water, at pre-flowering and boll development stages.
    *   **Foliar Spray for Calcium Deficiency:**
        *   Spray **Calcium nitrate** at 5-7 g/L of water during boll development.
*   **Variety Selection:** Choose cotton varieties known to be less prone to boll bursting.

### 2. Leaf Burning/Melting

"Leaf burning" is a more common term and refers to scorching or necrosis of leaf tissue. "Melting" is less common but could indicate severe tissue collapse. These are typically symptoms of environmental stress or chemical phytotoxicity.

**Causes:**
*   **Heat Stress/Sunscald:** High temperatures and intense sunlight, especially after cloudy periods, can scorch leaf tissue.
*   **Water Stress:** Severe water deficit can lead to desiccation and burning of leaf margins.
*   **Herbicide Phytotoxicity:** Incorrect dosage, improper application, or drift of herbicides can cause severe burning and necrosis.
*   **Nutrient Toxicity:** Excessive application of certain nutrients (e.g., chloride) can lead to leaf burn.
*   **Salinity:** High soil salinity can cause leaf tip and margin burn.

**Control Measures:**
*   **Irrigation Management:** Ensure adequate and timely irrigation to prevent water stress, especially during hot periods.
*   **Herbicide Application:**
    *   Always use CIBRC approved herbicides at recommended dosages.
    *   Apply herbicides uniformly and under calm weather conditions to prevent drift.
    *   Avoid spraying during high temperatures or when plants are under stress.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Conduct soil testing to determine nutrient status and apply fertilizers based on recommendations to avoid toxicity.
*   **Salinity Management:** If salinity is an issue, adopt practices like leaching with good quality water, use of gypsum, and planting salt-tolerant varieties.
*   **Canopy Management:** A healthy and dense canopy can provide some self-shading and reduce sunscald.

### 3. Hardness in Fruit (Hard Lock/Tight Lock)

"Hardness in fruit" in cotton is commonly known as "Hard Lock" or "Tight Lock." This condition occurs when the cotton fibers within the boll fail to fluff out properly, remaining tightly packed and making mechanical or manual picking difficult, leading to reduced lint quality and yield.

**Causes:**
*   **Adverse Weather Conditions:** Cool, wet, and cloudy weather during boll opening, or sudden drops in temperature, are primary causes.
*   **Nutrient Imbalance:** Deficiency of Potassium is particularly associated with poor fiber development and boll opening.
*   **Insect Damage:** Damage by bollworms or other pests to developing fibers can prevent proper fluffing.
*   **Diseases:** Certain diseases affecting boll development can also contribute.
*   **Variety Susceptibility:** Some varieties are more prone to hard lock.

**Control Measures:**
*   **Variety Selection:** Choose cotton varieties known for good boll opening characteristics and resistance to hard lock.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure balanced nutrition, with particular attention to Potassium.
    *   Apply **Muriate of Potash** (Potassium chloride) or **Sulphate of Potash** (Potassium sulphate) as per soil test recommendations, typically 60-80 kg/acre for irrigated cotton in Haryana.
    *   Foliar sprays of **Potassium nitrate** (5-10 g/L of water) can be beneficial during boll development.
*   **Pest Management:** Implement effective integrated pest management (IPM) strategies to control bollworms and other pests that damage developing bolls.
*   **Water Management:** Avoid excessive irrigation or waterlogging during the boll development and opening stages.
*   **Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs):**
    *   To promote uniform boll opening and reduce hard lock, especially in late-season bolls, **Ethephon** can be applied.
        *   Apply **Ethephon** at 1.0-1.5 L/acre (diluted in 200-300 L of water) when 40-60% of the bolls are open, and the remaining bolls are mature (crackable with pressure). Follow specific product label instructions for timing and dosage.

By adopting these scientifically sound practices, farmers can effectively manage and minimize physical damage in their cotton crops.
