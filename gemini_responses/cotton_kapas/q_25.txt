As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for irrigation management in Cotton (Kapas) in Haryana:

Effective irrigation management is paramount for achieving high and stable yields in Cotton (Kapas). Timely and adequate water supply, particularly during critical growth stages, directly influences plant growth, flowering, boll development, and fiber quality.

**1. First Irrigation:**

The timing of the first irrigation is crucial and depends on several factors:

*   **Pre-sowing Irrigation (Palewa):** If a pre-sowing irrigation was applied and the crop was sown on residual moisture, the first irrigation can be delayed.
*   **Rainfall:** The occurrence and amount of monsoon rainfall after sowing significantly influence the need for the first irrigation. If sufficient rain is received, it can be postponed.
*   **Soil Type:** Lighter soils (sandy loams) have lower water holding capacity and may require earlier irrigation compared to heavier soils (clay loams).
*   **Growth Stage:** Generally, the first irrigation is recommended around **30-45 days after sowing (DAS)**. This period often coincides with the **square formation stage** (initiation of flower buds), which is a critical phase for yield determination.
*   **Plant Indicators:** Observe the plants for signs of moisture stress, such as wilting or drooping of leaves, especially during the midday. If these symptoms appear, irrigation is immediately required.
*   **Method:** Apply water carefully to ensure uniform wetting of the root zone. Furrow irrigation is a common method, ensuring water reaches the plant base without causing waterlogging.

**2. Second and Subsequent Irrigations:**

Subsequent irrigations must be timed to prevent water stress during the most critical growth stages, particularly during flowering and boll development.

*   **Critical Stages:**
    *   **Flowering Stage (60-90 DAS):** This is the most water-sensitive stage. Water stress during flowering can lead to significant shedding of squares and flowers, directly impacting yield.
    *   **Boll Development and Maturation Stage (90-120 DAS):** Adequate moisture is essential for proper boll growth, fiber elongation, and timely boll opening.
*   **Timing and Frequency:**
    *   Generally, subsequent irrigations are required at intervals of **15-20 days** during the peak flowering and boll development period, depending on rainfall distribution and prevailing soil moisture conditions.
    *   **Soil Moisture Monitoring:** Regularly check soil moisture using simple methods (e.g., feel and appearance method) or by using soil moisture sensors/tensiometers if available.
    *   **Plant Indicators:** Healthy, turgid plants with dark green leaves indicate sufficient moisture. Dull-looking or wilting plants signal the need for irrigation.
*   **Total Irrigations:** Depending on the amount and distribution of rainfall, Cotton typically requires **3-5 irrigations** in addition to any pre-sowing irrigation in Haryana.

**3. Sprinkler Use (Micro-irrigation):**

Sprinkler irrigation, including drip irrigation, is a highly efficient water management technique strongly recommended for Cotton cultivation in Haryana, especially in regions facing water scarcity.

*   **Benefits:**
    *   **Water Saving:** Reduces water consumption by **30-50%** compared to traditional flood irrigation methods.
    *   **Increased Water Use Efficiency:** Delivers water directly to the plant's root zone, minimizing losses due to evaporation, runoff, and deep percolation.
    *   **Higher Yields:** Consistent and optimal moisture supply reduces plant stress, leading to better growth, flowering, and often higher yields.
    *   **Nutrient Use Efficiency:** Facilitates **fertigation** (application of water-soluble fertilizers through the irrigation system), improving nutrient uptake by plants.
    *   **Reduced Weed Growth:** Less wetting of the inter-row spaces helps in suppressing weed germination and growth.
*   **Recommendation for Cotton:**
    *   **Drip Irrigation:** Is particularly well-suited for Cotton. Lateral lines with emitters can be laid along the crop rows, providing water directly to the base of each plant.
    *   **Mini/Micro-sprinklers:** Can also be effectively used, especially for wider row spacing.
    *   **Scheduling:** Irrigation through sprinklers or drip systems should be done more frequently (e.g., daily or every other day) for shorter durations. This approach maintains optimal soil moisture levels without causing waterlogging, matching the crop's daily water requirement.
    *   **Government Support:** Farmers are encouraged to explore and avail government subsidies and schemes available for the adoption of micro-irrigation systems.
