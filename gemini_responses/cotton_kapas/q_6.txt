As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding viral diseases in Cotton (Kapas) for Haryana:

Firstly, let's clarify which of the mentioned conditions are relevant to Cotton (Kapas):

*   **Yellow vein clearing:** This is not known to affect Cotton (Kapas). It is primarily associated with Okra Yellow Vein Mosaic Virus (OYVMV) in okra.
*   **Stripe:** This is not known to affect Cotton (Kapas). Stripe viruses typically affect cereal crops.
*   **Tristeza:** This is not known to affect Cotton (Kapas). Citrus Tristeza Virus (CTV) affects citrus crops.

The viral diseases that are significant for Cotton (Kapas) in Haryana are **Cotton Leaf Curl Virus (CLCuV)**, which can manifest as leaf curl, mosaic-like symptoms, and stunted growth.

**Control of Viral Diseases in Cotton (Kapas):**

It is important to understand that there is no direct chemical cure for viral diseases once a plant is infected. Management strategies focus on preventing infection by controlling the insect vectors (primarily whiteflies, *Bemisia tabaci*) and adopting integrated pest management (IPM) practices.

**1. Vector Control (Whitefly Management):**
Controlling the whitefly population is crucial to prevent the spread of Cotton Leaf Curl Virus. Apply insecticides in rotation to prevent resistance development.

*   **Seed Treatment (for early protection against whiteflies):**
    *   **Imidacloprid** 600 FS: 5-7 ml per kg of seed
    *   **Thiamethoxam** 70 WS: 3-5 g per kg of seed

*   **Foliar Sprays (when whitefly population reaches economic threshold level):**
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: 125 ml per acre
    *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: 40-50 g per acre
    *   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP: 80-100 g per acre
    *   **Dinotefuran** 20% SG: 60-80 g per acre
    *   **Buprofezin** 25% SC: 500-600 ml per acre
    *   **Spiromesifen** 22.9% SC: 200 ml per acre
    *   **Diafenthiuron** 50% WP: 250 g per acre
    *   **Flonicamid** 50% WG: 60 g per acre
    *   **Pyriproxyfen** 10% EC: 500 ml per acre
    *   **Fenpropathrin** 30% EC: 250 ml per acre (Use in rotation with other groups to manage resistance)

**2. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Plant varieties recommended by HAU that are resistant or tolerant to Cotton Leaf Curl Virus.
*   **Timely Sowing:** Sow cotton at the recommended time to avoid peak whitefly populations.
*   **Weed Management:** Remove weeds from and around the cotton fields, as many weeds can act as alternate hosts for whiteflies and the virus.
*   **Roguing:** Regularly inspect fields and remove (rogue out) and destroy any plants showing symptoms of viral infection to prevent further spread.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure balanced fertilizer application, as excessive nitrogen can make plants more susceptible to whitefly infestation.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove cotton stubble and plant debris after harvest to break the pest cycle.

By implementing these integrated management strategies, the incidence and spread of viral diseases like Cotton Leaf Curl Virus can be effectively controlled in Cotton (Kapas).
