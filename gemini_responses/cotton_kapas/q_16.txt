As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I strongly recommend conducting a soil test before applying any fertilizers to determine the precise nutrient status of your field. This will allow for tailored recommendations, optimize nutrient use efficiency, and prevent nutrient imbalances.

However, based on general recommendations for Cotton (Kapas) in Haryana for soils of medium fertility, the following fertilizer doses are advised:

**1. Nitrogen (N):**
*   **Total N requirement:** 60-75 kg N per acre.
*   **Urea** (46% N):
    *   Apply 130-165 kg **Urea** per acre in split doses.
    *   **First Split (Basal/Sowing):** Apply 1/4th of the total N (approx. 32-41 kg **Urea** per acre).
    *   **Second Split (30-45 days after sowing):** Apply 1/2 of the total N (approx. 65-82 kg **Urea** per acre).
    *   **Third Split (60-75 days after sowing, at flowering/boll formation):** Apply 1/4th of the total N (approx. 32-41 kg **Urea** per acre).
*   **Nano-Urea** (Liquid, 4% N):
    *   Can be used as a supplementary foliar application to enhance nitrogen use efficiency.
    *   Dose: 2-4 ml per litre of water (or 250-500 ml per acre in 100-200 litres of water).
    *   Apply 1-2 sprays, first at 45-60 days after sowing and second at 75-90 days after sowing, depending on crop vigour and requirement.

**2. Phosphorus (P2O5):**
*   **Total P2O5 requirement:** 20-25 kg P2O5 per acre.
*   Apply the entire phosphorus dose as a basal application at the time of sowing.
*   **Diammonium phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5):
    *   If using **Diammonium phosphate**, apply 43-54 kg **Diammonium phosphate** per acre. This will also provide 7.7-9.7 kg N per acre, which should be adjusted in the **Urea** application.
*   **Single superphosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5, 11% S, 21% Ca):
    *   If using **Single superphosphate**, apply 125-156 kg **Single superphosphate** per acre. This will also provide 13.75-17.16 kg Sulphur per acre and 26.25-32.76 kg Calcium per acre.
*   **Nano-DAP** (Liquid, 8% N, 16% P2O5):
    *   Can be used as a supplementary foliar application.
    *   Dose: 2-4 ml per litre of water (or 250-500 ml per acre in 100-200 litres of water).
    *   Apply 1-2 sprays, first at 45-60 days after sowing and second at 75-90 days after sowing, especially if phosphorus deficiency is observed or anticipated.

**3. Potassium (K2O):**
*   **Total K2O requirement:** 20-25 kg K2O per acre (especially on light-textured soils or where soil test indicates deficiency).
*   Apply the entire potassium dose as a basal application at the time of sowing.
*   **Muriate of potash (MOP)** (60% K2O):
    *   Apply 33-42 kg **Muriate of potash** per acre.

**4. Sulphur (S):**
*   **Total S requirement:** 10-15 kg S per acre.
*   Apply the entire sulphur dose as a basal application at the time of sowing.
*   **Elemental sulphur** (90% S):
    *   Apply 11-17 kg **Elemental sulphur** per acre.
*   Alternatively, if **Single superphosphate** is used for phosphorus, it will largely cover the sulphur requirement (as 125-156 kg **Single superphosphate** provides 13.75-17.16 kg S).

**5. NPK Complex Fertilizers:**
*   While specific NPK complex fertilizers (e.g., 12:32:16, 19:19:19) can be used, it is generally recommended to apply N, P, and K based on specific crop requirements and soil test results using individual fertilizers like **Urea**, **Diammonium phosphate**, **Single superphosphate**, and **Muriate of potash** for better control and efficiency. If using NPK complexes, ensure the total N, P2O5, and K2O applied matches the recommended doses, adjusting other fertilizers accordingly.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Soil Testing:** Always prioritize a recent soil test report for the most accurate and efficient fertilizer application.
*   **Organic Manures:** Supplementing chemical fertilizers with 8-10 tonnes of well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost per acre can significantly improve soil health, water retention, and nutrient availability.
*   **Micronutrients:** Cotton also requires micronutrients like Zinc, Iron, Manganese, and Boron. If a soil test indicates deficiency, apply recommended micronutrient fertilizers (e.g., 5-10 kg **Zinc sulphate** per acre as basal).
