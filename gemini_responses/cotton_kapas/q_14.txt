Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding soil pests in Cotton (Kapas). Termites and Root-knot nematodes are significant threats that can severely impact cotton yield. Here is scientifically verified advice for their control:

### **1. Termite (Deemak) Control in Cotton (Kapas)**

Termites can cause significant damage by feeding on roots and stems, leading to wilting and plant death.

**Cultural and Preventive Measures:**
*   **Deep Ploughing:** Conduct deep summer ploughing to expose termite colonies to the sun and predators.
*   **Removal of Crop Residues:** Clear fields of stubble, weeds, and other organic debris that can serve as food sources or shelter for termites.
*   **Proper Irrigation:** Maintain adequate soil moisture, as termites prefer dry conditions.
*   **Farmyard Manure (FYM):** Ensure well-decomposed FYM is used, as undecomposed organic matter can attract termites.

**Chemical Control:**
For effective control, apply chemicals either as a pre-sowing treatment or at the time of sowing.
*   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC:** Apply **2.5 litres per acre** mixed with 200-400 litres of water as a soil drench or spray before sowing and incorporate into the soil.
*   **Fipronil 0.3% GR:** Apply **6-8 kg per acre** in furrows at the time of sowing.

### **2. Nematode (Root-knot) Control in Cotton (Kapas)**

Root-knot nematodes (*Meloidogyne* spp.) cause galls or knots on roots, impairing nutrient and water uptake, leading to stunted growth, yellowing, and reduced yields.

**Cultural and Preventive Measures:**
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops like sorghum, pearl millet, or marigold (Tagetes spp.) for 2-3 years. Avoid continuous cotton cultivation.
*   **Summer Ploughing:** Deep ploughing during summer helps expose nematode eggs and larvae to heat and desiccation.
*   **Solarization:** Covering the soil with transparent polyethylene sheets during hot summer months can reduce nematode populations.
*   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or neem cake (**200-400 kg per acre**) into the soil, as they can suppress nematode populations.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available and suitable for Haryana conditions, consider planting nematode-resistant cotton varieties.

**Chemical Control:**
Apply nematicides at the time of sowing for best results.
*   **Carbofuran 3% GR:** Apply **10-12 kg per acre** in furrows at the time of sowing.
*   **Phorate 10% GR:** Apply **10 kg per acre** in furrows at the time of sowing.
*   **Fipronil 0.3% GR:** Apply **6-8 kg per acre** in furrows at the time of sowing. (This chemical also offers some control against termites and has nematicidal properties).

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) while handling and applying chemicals.
*   Rotate chemicals with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.
*   Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods, is the most sustainable and effective strategy for long-term pest control.
