As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following cultivation practices for Cotton (Kapas) in Haryana to ensure optimal growth and yield:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   **Line Sowing** is highly recommended over broadcasting. This method facilitates efficient inter-cultivation, targeted nutrient application, pest and disease management through spraying, and uniform irrigation.
    *   **Dibbling:** This method involves placing seeds manually at precise distances, ensuring optimal plant-to-plant spacing from the beginning. It is particularly beneficial for Bt cotton to maintain the desired plant population.
    *   **Drill Sowing:** Using a seed drill can be employed for larger areas, but subsequent thinning may be required to achieve the recommended plant spacing.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   The ideal planting depth for cotton seeds is **3-5 cm**.
    *   Sowing too deep can hinder seedling emergence, while sowing too shallow can lead to poor germination due to insufficient moisture or increased susceptibility to bird damage.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   Optimal spacing is crucial for proper plant development, light interception, air circulation, and efficient resource utilization, directly impacting yield. For Bt cotton, which is predominantly cultivated in Haryana, the following spacing is generally recommended:
        *   **Row-to-Row:** **67.5 cm** to **75 cm**
        *   **Plant-to-Plant:** **15 cm** to **30 cm** (depending on the variety's growth habit and irrigation availability).
        *   A common and effective spacing for irrigated Bt cotton in Haryana is **67.5 cm x 15 cm** or **75 cm x 15 cm**. For more vigorous or spreading varieties, or under conditions of assured irrigation, plant-to-plant spacing can be increased up to **30 cm**.

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   The seed dose depends on the desired plant population and the germination percentage of the seeds. For Bt cotton hybrids, which are typically sold in packets containing a specific number of seeds:
        *   Approximately **1.5 - 2.0 kg/acre** of delinted Bt cotton seeds is generally sufficient to achieve the recommended plant population (around 10,000 - 12,000 plants per acre).
        *   Always use certified seeds from reliable sources to ensure genetic purity and good germination.
