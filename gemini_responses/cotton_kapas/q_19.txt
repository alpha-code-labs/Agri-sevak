As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide scientifically verified advice on addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies in Cotton (Kapas) for Haryana. It is crucial to conduct a soil test before planting to determine the exact nutrient status and apply fertilizers accordingly. Visual symptoms are indicators of existing deficiencies and require corrective measures.

### General Recommendations for Macro-nutrient Deficiencies in Cotton (Kapas)

**1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency**

*   **Symptoms:** General yellowing of older leaves, stunted plant growth, reduced boll size, and premature defoliation.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application (Corrective Top-dressing):**
        *   Apply **Urea** (46% N) at 30-40 kg per acre. This should be broadcast evenly and followed by light irrigation if possible, or applied before expected rainfall.
    *   **Foliar Application (for quick but temporary relief):**
        *   Spray a 2% solution of **Urea** (20 g of Urea per litre of water). Repeat after 7-10 days if symptoms persist. Ensure good coverage of the foliage.

**2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency**

*   **Symptoms:** Dark green to purplish discoloration of older leaves, stunted growth, delayed maturity, poor root development, and reduced boll formation.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application (Primary method, as P is less mobile):**
        *   If deficiency is observed early in the season and soil test indicates low P, apply **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5) at 25-30 kg per acre or **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5) at 75-90 kg per acre. This should be broadcast and incorporated into the soil, preferably near the root zone.
    *   **Foliar Application (for temporary boost, less effective for severe deficiency):**
        *   Spray **Mono-ammonium Phosphate (MAP)** (12% N, 61% P2O5) at 10-15 g per litre of water. Repeat after 10-15 days if needed.

**3. Potassium (K) Deficiency**

*   **Symptoms:** Yellowing and scorching/browning of leaf margins (edges) of older leaves, starting from the tip and progressing inwards. Leaves may appear crinkled or cupped. Poor boll development, reduced fibre quality, and increased susceptibility to diseases.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application (Corrective Top-dressing):**
        *   Apply **Muriate of Potash (Potassium Chloride)** (60% K2O) at 25-30 kg per acre. Broadcast evenly and incorporate into the soil, followed by irrigation.
    *   **Foliar Application (for quick relief):**
        *   Spray **Potassium Sulphate (SOP)** (50% K2O) at 10-15 g per litre of water.
        *   Alternatively, **Potassium Nitrate** (13% N, 45% K2O) can be sprayed at 10-15 g per litre of water, which also provides some nitrogen. Repeat after 7-10 days if symptoms persist.

### Important Considerations:

*   **Soil Testing:** Always prioritize soil testing to understand the actual nutrient status of your field. This allows for proactive and precise nutrient management rather than reactive correction.
*   **Timing:** Apply fertilizers at appropriate growth stages of the cotton crop for maximum efficiency.
*   **Water Availability:** Ensure adequate soil moisture for nutrient uptake, especially after soil application of fertilizers.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management (INM):** Combine chemical fertilizers with organic manures (Farm Yard Manure, compost) and bio-fertilizers for sustainable soil health and nutrient availability.
*   **Application Method:** For soil applications, broadcasting followed by light incorporation or placement near the root zone is generally more effective than surface application without incorporation.
*   **Foliar Spray Precautions:** Always use clean water for spraying. Avoid spraying during hot midday hours to prevent leaf scorching. Ensure proper coverage of the foliage.
