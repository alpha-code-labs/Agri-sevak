As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I must inform you that the specific rust diseases mentioned (Black Rust, Brown Rust, Yellow Rust, White Rust, and Red Rust) are **not known to affect Cotton (Kapas)** in Haryana or generally in India.

These rusts are primarily diseases of other crops:
*   **Black Rust (Stem Rust), Brown Rust (Leaf Rust), and Yellow Rust (Stripe Rust)** are major diseases of cereal crops like wheat, barley, and rye.
*   **White Rust** typically refers to White Blister Rust, which affects cruciferous crops like mustard and radish.
*   **Red Rust** can refer to an algal disease of tea or other perennial crops, or a stage of other rusts, but not a distinct rust disease of cotton.

Cotton (Kapas) in Haryana is generally affected by other fungal and bacterial diseases such as Bacterial Blight, Alternaria Leaf Spot, Cercospora Leaf Spot, Grey Mildew, and various root rots. True rust diseases are not a common or significant problem for cotton cultivation in our region.
