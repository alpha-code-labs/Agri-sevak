As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the maturity signs, harvesting time, and cutting process for Cotton (Kapas) in Haryana:

### Maturity Signs for Cotton (Kapas)

The maturity of cotton bolls is indicated by several key signs:

*   **Boll Opening:** The most prominent sign is when the bolls crack open, revealing the white, fluffy lint inside. This indicates that the fibers have matured and dried.
*   **Lint Fluffiness:** The cotton lint inside the opened boll should appear fully expanded, dry, and fluffy.
*   **Boll Wall Color Change:** The outer carpels (walls) of the boll change color from green to brown or black and become dry and brittle.
*   **Seed Maturity:** While not directly visible, mature bolls contain fully developed, hard seeds.
*   **Plant Senescence:** As the plant approaches maturity, lower leaves may start to yellow and drop, indicating the plant is channeling resources into boll development.

### Harvesting Time for Cotton (Kapas)

Optimal harvesting time is crucial for maximizing yield and lint quality.

*   **Initiation of Picking:** Harvesting should commence when approximately 40-50% of the bolls on the plant have opened. This allows for multiple pickings, which is standard practice for cotton.
*   **Weather Conditions:** Always pick cotton during dry, sunny weather. Avoid harvesting immediately after rain or when there is heavy dew, as wet cotton can lead to lint staining, fungal growth, and reduced quality during storage and ginning. Wait until the morning dew has completely dried.
*   **Multiple Pickings:** Cotton plants mature progressively, with bolls at the bottom of the plant opening first, followed by those higher up. Therefore, cotton is typically harvested in 3-5 pickings over a period of several weeks. The first picking usually yields the best quality lint.
*   **Seasonal Timing:** In Haryana, cotton harvesting generally begins in October and can extend into December, depending on the sowing date, variety, and prevailing weather conditions.

### Cutting Process (Harvesting Method) for Cotton (Kapas)

In Haryana, manual picking is the predominant and recommended method for harvesting cotton due to its advantages in lint quality.

*   **Manual Picking (Hand Picking):**
    *   **Method:** Skilled laborers carefully pluck only the fully opened cotton lint from the bolls, leaving the dry carpels attached to the plant. This selective picking ensures that only mature, high-quality lint is harvested.
    *   **Advantages:**
        *   **Superior Lint Quality:** Manual picking results in cleaner lint with minimal trash (leaves, bracts, stem pieces), leading to a higher market value.
        *   **Selective Harvesting:** Allows for picking only fully mature bolls, which is essential for maintaining lint uniformity and strength.
        *   **Reduced Plant Damage:** Minimizes damage to the plant, allowing for subsequent healthy boll development and multiple pickings.
    *   **Best Practices for Manual Picking:**
        *   Pick only fully opened, dry bolls.
        *   Avoid mixing stained, discolored, or insect-damaged cotton with good quality lint. Keep them separate.
        *   Use clean cotton bags or containers for collection to prevent contamination.
        *   Ensure pickers remove as little plant material (leaves, bracts) as possible to minimize trash content.
        *   Store harvested cotton in a dry, well-ventilated area, away from direct sunlight and moisture, until it can be transported to the ginning factory.
