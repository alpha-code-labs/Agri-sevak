As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an Integrated Weed Management (IWM) approach for effective and sustainable weed control in Cotton (Kapas). This involves a combination of cultural, mechanical, and chemical methods.

First, addressing specific weeds as per their known impact on Cotton:

*   **Orobanche:** This is not known to affect Cotton (Kapas). Orobanche (Broomrape) is primarily a parasitic weed of solanaceous crops (like tobacco, tomato, brinjal, potato) and some oilseeds (like mustard, sunflower).
*   **Phalaris minor:** This is not known to affect Cotton (Kapas) as a major weed. Phalaris minor (Gulli Danda) is predominantly a weed of wheat and other winter cereals.

For the other weeds (Broadleaf, Narrowleaf, Amarbail, Bathu, Congress grass), here are the recommended control measures:

**I. Cultural and Mechanical Methods (Foundation of IWM):**

1.  **Field Preparation:** Deep ploughing and proper land levelling can help reduce weed seed bank.
2.  **Clean Seed:** Use certified, weed-free cotton seeds to prevent introduction of new weeds.
3.  **Timely Sowing:** Sowing at the optimal time allows cotton to establish quickly and compete better with weeds.
4.  **Inter-cultivation/Hoeing:** Two to three inter-cultivations (e.g., at 20-25 and 40-45 days after sowing) can effectively control early-emerging weeds.
5.  **Hand Weeding:** Manual removal of weeds, especially within the crop rows, is highly effective and crucial, particularly for parasitic weeds like Amarbail.

**II. Chemical Control (Herbicides):**

Herbicides should be used judiciously and as per recommendations, ensuring proper application techniques.

**A. Pre-emergence Herbicides (Applied within 0-3 days after sowing):**
These herbicides form a chemical barrier in the soil and control germinating weeds. Good soil moisture is essential for their activation. Effective against most annual broadleaf and narrowleaf weeds, including Bathu and Congress grass.

*   **For Broadleaf and Narrowleaf Weeds (including Bathu, Congress grass):**
    *   **Pendimethalin** (30% EC): Apply 3.3 Litres per acre in 200-250 Litres of water.
    *   **Diuron** (80% WP): Apply 1.0 kg per acre in 200-250 Litres of water.

**B. Post-emergence Herbicides (Applied when weeds are at 2-4 leaf stage, generally 15-30 days after sowing):**
These herbicides are applied directly to the emerged weeds.

*   **For Broadleaf Weeds (including Bathu, Congress grass):**
    *   **Pyrithiobac sodium** (10% EC): Apply 625 ml per acre in 200-250 Litres of water. Apply when weeds are at 2-4 leaf stage (15-25 DAS).
*   **For Narrowleaf Weeds (Grasses):**
    *   **Quizalofop-p-ethyl** (5% EC): Apply 1.0 Litre per acre in 200-250 Litres of water. Apply when weeds are at 2-4 leaf stage (15-30 DAS).

**C. Specific Control for Amarbail (Cuscuta spp.):**
Amarbail is a parasitic weed and its control is challenging once established.

*   **Prevention is Key:**
    *   Use only certified, Amarbail-free cotton seeds.
    *   Practice crop rotation with non-host crops.
    *   Remove Amarbail from field bunds and surrounding areas.
*   **Chemical Control (Limited options, primarily preventive/spot treatment):**
    *   **Pre-emergence:** **Pendimethalin** (as mentioned above) can offer some suppression of Amarbail germination.
    *   **Post-emergence (Spot Application):** For isolated patches of Amarbail, very careful spot application of **Paraquat dichloride** (24% SL) at 1.0-1.5 Litres per acre (mixed in 200-250 Litres of water) can be done. This is a non-selective contact herbicide, so **extreme caution is required to prevent any spray drift or contact with the cotton plants**, as it will cause severe damage. Hand removal is often safer and more practical for small infestations.

**Important Considerations and Precautions:**

*   **Water Volume:** Always use the recommended water volume (typically 200-250 Litres per acre) for uniform spray coverage.
*   **Nozzle Type:** Use flat fan nozzles for herbicide application to ensure proper coverage.
*   **Weather Conditions:** Apply herbicides during calm weather, avoiding windy conditions to prevent drift. Ensure no rain is expected for at least 4-6 hours after application.
*   **Crop Stage:** Adhere strictly to the recommended crop and weed stages for herbicide application to maximize efficacy and minimize crop injury.
*   **Rotation of Herbicides:** To prevent herbicide resistance, rotate different herbicide groups (with different modes of action) over seasons.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals. Read and follow all instructions on the product label.

By implementing these scientifically verified strategies, farmers can effectively manage weeds in Cotton (Kapas) and ensure healthy crop growth and yield.
