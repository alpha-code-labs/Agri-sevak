Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU), Hisar, I understand your concern regarding Wilt and Parawilt in Cotton (Kapas). Both can cause significant yield losses if not managed properly. It's crucial to differentiate between them as their management strategies vary.

### **1. Wilt (Pathogenic Wilt - Fusarium Wilt, Verticillium Wilt)**

This type of wilt is caused by soil-borne fungal pathogens like *Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. vasinfectum* and *Verticillium dahliae*.

**Symptoms:**
*   Yellowing of leaves, often starting from one side of the plant or one branch.
*   Wilting of leaves and branches, eventually leading to the death of the entire plant.
*   Browning or blackening of vascular tissues (xylem) when the stem is cut open.

**Management Strategies:**

**A. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Plant varieties known to be resistant or tolerant to wilt diseases. Consult HAU recommendations for suitable varieties in Haryana.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice a 2-3 year crop rotation with non-host crops like wheat, maize, or sorghum to reduce pathogen inoculum in the soil.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure balanced fertilization, especially adequate potassium (K), as it helps in plant resistance. Avoid excessive nitrogen.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris to prevent the spread of pathogens.
*   **Deep Summer Ploughing:** Expose the soil to high summer temperatures to reduce pathogen populations.
*   **Good Drainage:** Ensure proper field drainage to avoid waterlogging, which can stress plants and favor disease development.

**B. Biological Control:**
*   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds with bio-fungicides before sowing.
    *   **Trichoderma viride** (WP formulation) @ 4-5 g/kg seed.
*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Mix **Trichoderma viride** (WP formulation) @ 2.5 kg/acre with 50 kg of farmyard manure (FYM) or compost, and apply it to the soil before sowing or at the time of sowing.

**C. Chemical Control:**
*   **Seed Treatment:**
    *   Treat seeds with **Carbendazim** 50% WP @ 2 g/kg seed.
    *   Alternatively, use a combination product like **Carbendazim** 12% + **Mancozeb** 63% WP @ 2-3 g/kg seed.
*   **Drenching (for standing crop, if infection is localized):**
    *   Drench the soil around the base of infected plants with a solution of **Carbendazim** 50% WP @ 1 g/L of water. Apply 200-250 ml of this solution per plant.

### **2. Parawilt (Physiological Wilt / Sudden Wilt)**

Parawilt is a physiological disorder, not caused by a pathogen. It is often triggered by sudden changes in soil moisture (e.g., prolonged dry spell followed by heavy irrigation or rainfall), high temperatures, or nutrient imbalances.

**Symptoms:**
*   Sudden, rapid wilting of the entire plant, often occurring within a few hours.
*   Leaves turn dull green, then brown, but typically remain attached to the plant.
*   No vascular discoloration in the stem initially (unlike pathogenic wilt).
*   Plants may recover partially or fully if conditions improve quickly.

**Management Strategies:**

**A. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Judicious Irrigation:** Maintain consistent soil moisture. Avoid prolonged dry spells followed by sudden heavy irrigation. Irrigate based on soil moisture status and crop requirement.
*   **Avoid Waterlogging:** Ensure good drainage to prevent water accumulation around the root zone.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure adequate and balanced nutrient supply, especially potassium, which plays a crucial role in water regulation within the plant.

**B. Nutritional Management (Foliar Sprays):**
*   **Potassium Nitrate (KNO3):**
    *   Spray a 1-2% solution of Potassium Nitrate (10-20 g/L of water) on the affected plants. This helps in osmotic adjustment and water uptake.
*   **Magnesium Sulfate (MgSO4):**
    *   Spray a 0.5-1% solution of Magnesium Sulfate (5-10 g/L of water) on the affected plants. Magnesium is vital for chlorophyll formation and overall plant health.

**General Advice:**
*   Always conduct a soil test to understand the nutrient status of your field and apply fertilizers accordingly.
*   Regularly monitor your crop for early signs of any disease or stress to implement timely management measures.
