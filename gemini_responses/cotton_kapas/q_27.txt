As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the suitable climate, soil type, and drainage requirements for Cotton (Kapas) in Haryana:

**Suitable Climate for Cotton (Kapas):**

*   **Temperature:** Cotton is a warm-season crop requiring a long frost-free period, typically 180-200 days.
    *   **Germination:** Optimal temperature for seed germination is around 18-20°C.
    *   **Vegetative Growth:** Ideal temperatures for vegetative growth range from 21-27°C.
    *   **Flowering and Boll Development:** Warm days (27-32°C) and cool nights are beneficial during flowering and boll development. Temperatures exceeding 35°C during flowering can lead to flower and square shedding.
*   **Sunshine:** Abundant bright sunshine is crucial, especially during the fruiting and boll maturation stages, for good yield and fiber quality.
*   **Rainfall:** Cotton requires moderate rainfall (500-1000 mm) well-distributed throughout its growing season. However, heavy rainfall during the flowering period can be detrimental, causing flower drop. Dry weather is essential during boll maturation and picking to prevent boll rot and maintain fiber quality. In Haryana, supplementary irrigation is often critical to meet the crop's water demands.

**Suitable Soil Type for Cotton (Kapas):**

*   Cotton thrives best on well-drained, deep, and fertile soils.
*   **Texture:** Medium to heavy soils are generally preferred. These include sandy loam, loam, and clay loam soils, which have good water retention capacity while allowing for adequate drainage.
*   **pH:** An optimal soil pH range of 6.0 to 7.5 is considered ideal for cotton cultivation.
*   **Organic Matter:** Soils rich in organic matter contribute to sustained fertility and improved soil structure.
*   **Salinity/Alkalinity:** While cotton has moderate tolerance to salinity, highly saline or alkaline soils are detrimental to its growth and yield.

**Drainage Requirement for Cotton (Kapas):**

*   Cotton is highly sensitive to waterlogging.
*   **Waterlogging Impact:** Standing water, even for short durations, can severely damage the root system, leading to yellowing of leaves, stunted growth, shedding of squares and bolls, and increased susceptibility to diseases like root rot.
*   **Aeration:** Good soil drainage is essential to ensure proper aeration of the root zone, which is vital for healthy root development, nutrient uptake, and overall plant vigor.
*   **Field Preparation:** Proper land leveling and the implementation of appropriate surface drainage measures (e.g., furrows, ridges) are crucial, especially in areas prone to heavy rainfall or where irrigation is practiced, to prevent water accumulation.
