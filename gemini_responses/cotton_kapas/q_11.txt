As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing pests in Cotton (Kapas) in Haryana.

Let's address each category:

### Sawflies

This is not known to affect Cotton (Kapas). Sawflies are generally not considered a pest of economic significance in cotton cultivation in Haryana.

### Beetles and Weevils

Beetles and Weevils can cause damage to cotton, particularly the Cotton Stem Weevil (*Pempherulus affinis*) and various species of Flea Beetles.

**1. Cotton Stem Weevil (*Pempherulus affinis*)**
*   **Damage:** The grubs bore into the stem, causing galls or swellings, leading to stunted growth, wilting, and sometimes breakage of the stem, especially in young plants.

**2. Flea Beetles**
*   **Damage:** Adult beetles feed on young leaves, creating small, round holes (shot-hole damage). Severe infestation can defoliate seedlings and stunt plant growth.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies:**

To effectively control these pests, an integrated approach combining cultural, mechanical, and chemical methods is recommended.

**A. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Timely Sowing:** Sow cotton at the recommended time to allow plants to establish well before peak pest activity.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy cotton stubble and alternate host plants after harvest to break the pest life cycle.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Maintain optimal plant vigour through balanced fertilization, as stressed plants are more susceptible.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate cotton with non-host crops to reduce pest build-up in the soil.

**B. Mechanical Control:**
*   **Hand Picking:** In small areas, adult beetles and weevils can be hand-picked and destroyed, especially during early morning hours.
*   **Removal of Infested Plants:** Uproot and destroy severely infested plants, particularly those showing stem weevil galls, to prevent further spread.

**C. Chemical Control:**
Chemical control should be used judiciously, preferably when pest populations exceed economic threshold levels. Always follow label instructions for dosage and safety.

**For Cotton Stem Weevil:**
*   **Seed Treatment:**
    *   **Imidacloprid** 600 FS at 5-7 ml per kg of seed.
    *   **Thiamethoxam** 30 FS at 10 ml per kg of seed.
*   **Soil Drenching (for young plants, 15-30 days after sowing):**
    *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 2.5 ml per litre of water (apply 50-100 ml solution per plant around the base).
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL at 0.3 ml per litre of water (apply 50-100 ml solution per plant around the base).

**For Flea Beetles (and other chewing beetles):**
*   **Foliar Spray (when damage is observed, especially on young plants):**
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL at 125 ml per acre (mixed in 200-250 litres of water).
    *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG at 50-100 g per acre (mixed in 200-250 litres of water).
    *   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP at 50-100 g per acre (mixed in 200-250 litres of water).
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 200-250 ml per acre (mixed in 200-250 litres of water).

Always ensure thorough coverage of the plant foliage during spraying. Consult your local agricultural extension officer for the most current and specific recommendations for your region and cotton variety.
