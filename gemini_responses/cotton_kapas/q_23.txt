As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified seed and soil treatment processes for Cotton (Kapas) in Haryana. These treatments are crucial for protecting the crop from early-season pests and diseases, ensuring better germination, stand establishment, and overall plant health.

### Recommended Seed Treatment Process for Cotton (Kapas)

Seed treatment is vital for protecting cotton seedlings from early-season sucking pests and soil-borne fungal diseases, leading to improved germination and vigorous seedling growth.

**1. For Protection Against Early-Season Sucking Pests (Thrips, Jassids, Aphids):**
*   **Imidacloprid** 70 WS: 5-7 grams per kg of seed.
*   **Thiamethoxam** 70 WS: 3-5 grams per kg of seed.

**2. For Protection Against Seed-Borne and Soil-Borne Fungal Diseases (Damping-off, Seedling Blight, Root Rot):**
*   **Carbendazim** 50 WP: 2 grams per kg of seed.
*   **Thiram** 75 WS: 2.5-3 grams per kg of seed.
*   **Carboxin** 37.5% + **Thiram** 37.5% DS: 3 grams per kg of seed.
*   **Metalaxyl** 35 WS: 3-6 grams per kg of seed (particularly effective against *Pythium* causing damping-off).

**3. Bio-fungicide for Disease Suppression and Growth Promotion:**
*   **Trichoderma viride** 1% WP: 4-5 grams per kg of seed.

**Recommended Seed Treatment Process:**
1.  **Fungicide Application First:** Begin by treating the cotton seeds with the chosen fungicide (e.g., a combination of **Carbendazim** and **Thiram**, or **Carboxin** + **Thiram**). Place the seeds and the required quantity of fungicide in a seed treatment drum or a sturdy plastic bag. Shake vigorously or tumble until all seeds are uniformly coated.
2.  **Insecticide Application Next:** After the fungicide application, apply the chosen insecticide (e.g., **Imidacloprid** or **Thiamethoxam**) to the same seeds. Mix again thoroughly to ensure an even coating.
3.  **Bio-agent Application (Optional but Recommended):** If using **Trichoderma viride**, apply it last. Slightly moisten the seeds (if dry) to help the bio-agent adhere better. Mix well.
4.  **Drying:** Allow the treated seeds to dry slightly in the shade before sowing. This prevents clumping and ensures smooth sowing.
5.  **Method:** Ensure uniform coating by using a seed treatment drum or by mixing thoroughly in a plastic bag.

### Recommended Soil Treatment Process for Cotton (Kapas)

Soil treatment aims to manage soil-borne pests and diseases, and to enhance soil health for optimal cotton growth and yield.

**1. For Termites and White Grubs:**
*   **Chlorpyrifos** 20 EC: 2-4 litres per acre. Mix with 50-100 kg of dry sand or apply through irrigation water (drenching) before sowing or during the final land preparation. Ensure uniform distribution and incorporation into the soil.
*   **Fipronil** 0.3 GR: 6-8 kg per acre. Broadcast uniformly over the field and incorporate into the soil during the final ploughing or harrowing before sowing.

**2. For Nematodes (Root-knot nematodes, Reniform nematodes):**
*   **Carbofuran** 3G: 10-12 kg per acre. Apply in furrows at the time of sowing and cover with soil. (Always check current CIBRC guidelines and local recommendations for usage).
*   **Fluensulfone** 2% GR: 10 kg per acre. Apply in furrows at the time of sowing.
*   **Purpureocillium lilacinum** (Bio-nematicide) 1% WP: 2.5-5 kg per acre. Mix with 100 kg of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost. Apply uniformly to the soil before sowing or at the time of sowing.

**3. For Soil-borne Fungal Diseases (Root Rot, Wilt) and Soil Health Improvement:**
*   **Trichoderma viride** 1% WP: 2.5-5 kg per acre. Mix with 100 kg of well-decomposed FYM or compost. Keep the mixture moist and covered in a shaded area for 7-10 days to allow the fungus to multiply. Then, broadcast uniformly and incorporate into the soil during final land preparation, or apply in furrows at sowing.

**Recommended Soil Treatment Process:**
1.  **Land Preparation:** Ensure thorough land preparation, including deep ploughing and removal of crop residues, to create a good seedbed.
2.  **Application of Bio-agents/Organic Amendments:** If using **Trichoderma viride** or **Purpureocillium lilacinum**, prepare the mixture with FYM/compost as described above. Apply this mixture uniformly across the field during the final ploughing or harrowing, ensuring it is well incorporated into the soil.
3.  **Application of Chemical Granules:** For granular insecticides/nematicides like **Fipronil** 0.3 GR, **Carbofuran** 3G, or **Fluensulfone** 2% GR, broadcast them uniformly over the field and incorporate into the soil before sowing, or apply directly in the furrows at the time of sowing as per product instructions.
4.  **Application of Liquid Formulations:** For liquid insecticides like **Chlorpyrifos** 20 EC, mix with sand and broadcast, or apply through irrigation water (drenching) to ensure even distribution and penetration into the soil before sowing.

**General Advice:**
*   Always read and strictly follow the instructions and safety precautions provided on the product label.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, and protective clothing while handling and applying any chemicals.
*   For specific field conditions and localized pest/disease pressure, it is always advisable to consult with your local agricultural extension officer or experts at HAU for tailored recommendations.
*   Adopting Integrated Pest and Disease Management (IPDM) strategies, which combine cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods, is highly recommended for sustainable cotton production.
