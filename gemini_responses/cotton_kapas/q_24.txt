As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I must clarify that **transplantation is generally not recommended or practiced for commercial cotton (Kapas) cultivation in Haryana.**

Cotton develops a strong taproot system, which can be easily damaged during transplanting. This damage leads to poor establishment, stunted growth, reduced vigor, and ultimately lower yields. Direct sowing is the standard, most effective, and recommended method for cotton cultivation in our region.

Therefore, instead of transplantation, I will provide the ideal time, distance, and process for **direct sowing** of Cotton (Kapas):

### Ideal Sowing Time for Cotton (Kapas)

*   **Optimal Window:** The ideal time for direct sowing of cotton in Haryana is from **mid-April to mid-May**.
*   **Early Sowing Advantage:** Sowing in mid-April is often preferred as it allows the crop to establish well before the monsoon, potentially leading to higher yields and better management of early-season pests. However, adequate irrigation facilities are crucial for early sowing.

### Ideal Sowing Distance for Cotton (Kapas)

Maintaining proper spacing is critical for optimal plant growth, light interception, air circulation, and pest management.

*   **Row-to-Row Distance:** **67.5 cm** (or 75 cm in some areas, depending on variety and soil fertility).
*   **Plant-to-Plant Distance:** **15 cm** (or 20 cm, depending on variety and desired plant population).
*   **Plant Population:** This spacing aims for a plant population of approximately **60,000 to 80,000 plants per acre**, which is considered optimal for most Bt cotton varieties grown in Haryana.

### Ideal Sowing Process for Cotton (Kapas)

1.  **Land Preparation:**
    *   Perform deep ploughing followed by 2-3 harrowings to achieve a fine, firm, and well-levelled seedbed.
    *   Remove all crop residues and weeds.
    *   Pre-sowing irrigation (palewa) is often recommended, especially if soil moisture is insufficient, to ensure uniform germination.

2.  **Seed Selection and Treatment:**
    *   Use high-quality, certified seeds of recommended Bt cotton varieties suitable for Haryana.
    *   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds with appropriate fungicides and insecticides to protect against early-season diseases (e.g., damping-off) and sucking pests (e.g., thrips, jassids) during the seedling stage.

3.  **Sowing Method:**
    *   Sow seeds using a seed drill or by dibbling (manual placement) to ensure precise spacing and uniform depth.
    *   **Sowing Depth:** Maintain a sowing depth of **3-5 cm**. Ensure good seed-to-soil contact for proper germination.

4.  **Post-Sowing Management:**
    *   If pre-sowing irrigation was not done, a light irrigation immediately after sowing may be necessary to aid germination, especially in dry conditions.
    *   Ensure timely weed management and nutrient application as per HAU recommendations for healthy crop growth.
