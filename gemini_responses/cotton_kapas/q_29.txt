Dropping of flowers, fruits, and bolls (Tinda) in Cotton (Kapas) is a common physiological phenomenon that can significantly impact yield. It is often a response to various environmental stresses, nutritional deficiencies, or hormonal imbalances. As Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend the following scientifically verified strategies for control:

### Strategies to Control Dropping in Cotton (Kapas)

1.  **Nutritional Management:**
    *   **Balanced Fertilization:** Ensure adequate and balanced application of macronutrients (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium) as per soil test recommendations.
    *   **Boron Application:** Boron is crucial for pollen viability, fertilization, and fruit set. Its deficiency is a major cause of flower and boll shedding.
        *   Foliar spray of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (20% Boron) at 1.5-2.0 g/L of water at the pre-flowering stage (around 45-50 days after sowing) and a second spray at peak flowering (around 70-80 days after sowing).
    *   **Zinc Application:** Zinc plays a vital role in enzyme activity and hormone synthesis.
        *   Foliar spray of **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (21% Zinc) at 5 g/L of water if deficiency symptoms are observed or suspected based on soil analysis.
    *   **Magnesium Application:** Magnesium is essential for photosynthesis and overall plant vigour.
        *   Foliar spray of **Magnesium sulphate** at 5 g/L of water if deficiency symptoms (interveinal chlorosis) are observed.

2.  **Water Management:**
    *   **Optimal Soil Moisture:** Maintain consistent and optimal soil moisture, especially during the critical flowering and boll development stages.
    *   **Avoid Stress:** Both severe water stress (drought) and waterlogging can lead to increased shedding. Irrigate judiciously based on crop requirement, soil type, and prevailing weather conditions.

3.  **Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs):**
    *   **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA):** This is the most effective and commonly recommended PGR for preventing flower and boll drop in cotton. It helps in the retention of reproductive structures.
        *   Foliar spray of **Naphthalene Acetic Acid** (4.5% SL formulation) at 20-40 ml per 100 litres of water (equivalent to 9-18 ppm) at the peak flowering stage (around 60-70 days after sowing). A second spray can be given 15-20 days later if shedding persists.

4.  **Pest and Disease Management:**
    *   While not a direct cause of physiological dropping, severe infestations of sucking pests (e.g., whitefly, jassids, aphids) or bollworms, and certain diseases can weaken the plant, disrupt nutrient flow, and indirectly lead to premature shedding of flowers and bolls.
    *   Implement integrated pest and disease management strategies to keep the crop healthy and vigorous, thereby reducing stress-induced dropping.

By adopting these integrated management practices, farmers can significantly reduce flower, fruit, and boll dropping, leading to improved yields in Cotton (Kapas).
