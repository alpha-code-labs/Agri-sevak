Here are the recommended doses of organic manures for Cotton (Kapas) in Haryana:

*   **Farmyard Manure (FYM):**
    *   **10-15 tonnes per acre.**
    *   *Application:* Apply 2-3 weeks before sowing and thoroughly incorporate into the soil.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   **2-4 tonnes per acre.**
    *   *Application:* Apply 2-3 weeks before sowing and incorporate into the soil. It can also be used as a partial substitute for FYM due to its higher nutrient concentration.

*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract based product):**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** **2-4 ml per litre of water.**
        *   *Application:* Typically, 2-3 sprays are recommended during the crop cycle, for example, at squaring, flowering, and boll development stages.
    *   **Soil Application (Drip/Drench):** **500 ml to 1 litre per acre.**
        *   *Application:* Can be applied through drip irrigation or as a drench around the root zone.
    *   *Note:* Sagarika is a plant growth stimulant and nutrient mobilizer, derived from seaweed extracts. It complements the use of bulk organic manures and chemical fertilizers, rather than being a bulk organic manure itself.
