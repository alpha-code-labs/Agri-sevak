As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Cotton (Kapas) in Haryana:

It is crucial to adopt an Integrated Disease Management (IDM) approach, combining cultural practices, resistant varieties, and judicious use of fungicides. Always consult your local agricultural extension for the most precise and up-to-date recommendations for your specific field conditions.

Here's how to control the mentioned fungal diseases:

### 1. Alternaria Leaf Spot (Caused by *Alternaria macrospora*)
This disease causes circular to irregular spots on leaves, often with concentric rings, leading to defoliation in severe cases.

*   **Foliar Spray:**
    *   **Mancozeb 75% WP** at 2.0-2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5-3.0 g/L of water).
    *   **Chlorothalonil 75% WP** at 1.5-2.0 kg/acre (or 2.0-2.5 g/L of water).
    *   **Propiconazole 25% EC** at 200-250 ml/acre (or 0.5 ml/L of water).
    *   **Difenoconazole 25% EC** at 150-200 ml/acre (or 0.4 ml/L of water).
    *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC** at 200 ml/acre (or 0.5 ml/L of water).

### 2. Anthracnose (Caused by *Colletotrichum gossypii*)
Anthracnose can affect seedlings (damping-off, seedling blight), leaves, stems, and bolls, causing sunken lesions and boll rot.

*   **Seed Treatment (for seedling blight):**
    *   **Carbendazim 50% WP** at 2-3 g/kg of seed.
    *   **Thiophanate Methyl 70% WP** at 2-3 g/kg of seed.
*   **Foliar Spray (for leaf/boll infection):**
    *   **Carbendazim 50% WP** at 500 g/acre (or 1.0 g/L of water).
    *   **Mancozeb 75% WP** at 2.0-2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5-3.0 g/L of water).
    *   **Propiconazole 25% EC** at 200-250 ml/acre (or 0.5 ml/L of water).

### 3. Blast
This is not known to affect Cotton (Kapas).

### 4. Blight (Fungal)
In cotton, fungal blights primarily refer to seedling blights (damping-off) caused by fungi like *Rhizoctonia solani*, *Pythium* spp., and *Fusarium* spp., leading to poor stand establishment. Severe forms of other leaf spot diseases can also be described as blight.

*   **Seed Treatment (most effective for seedling blight):**
    *   **Carbendazim 50% WP** at 2-3 g/kg of seed.
    *   **Thiram 75% WS** at 2-3 g/kg of seed.
    *   **Captan 50% WP** at 2-3 g/kg of seed.
    *   **Pencycuron 25% WP** at 2-3 g/kg of seed (specifically for *Rhizoctonia*).
*   **Cultural Practices:** Ensure good drainage, avoid excessive irrigation, and maintain optimal planting depth.

### 5. Brown Spot (Cercospora Leaf Spot, Caused by *Cercospora gossypina*)
This disease causes small, circular to angular brown spots on leaves, which may coalesce and lead to defoliation.

*   **Foliar Spray:**
    *   **Mancozeb 75% WP** at 2.0-2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5-3.0 g/L of water).
    *   **Chlorothalonil 75% WP** at 1.5-2.0 kg/acre (or 2.0-2.5 g/L of water).
    *   **Propiconazole 25% EC** at 200-250 ml/acre (or 0.5 ml/L of water).
    *   **Difenoconazole 25% EC** at 150-200 ml/acre (or 0.4 ml/L of water).

### 6. Downy Mildew
This is not known to affect Cotton (Kapas).

### 7. Powdery Mildew (Caused by *Leveillula taurica* or *Erysiphe cichoracearum*)
Though less common than other diseases, powdery mildew can appear as white, powdery patches on the upper surface of leaves.

*   **Foliar Spray:**
    *   **Sulphur 80% WP** at 1.5-2.0 kg/acre (or 2.0-2.5 g/L of water).
    *   **Myclobutanil 10% WP** at 100-120 g/acre (or 0.2-0.3 g/L of water).
    *   **Hexaconazole 5% SC** at 200-250 ml/acre (or 0.5 ml/L of water).
    *   **Penconazole 10% EC** at 100-150 ml/acre (or 0.2-0.3 ml/L of water).

### 8. Grey Mildew (Ramularia Leaf Spot, Caused by *Ramularia areola*)
This disease is characterized by angular, greyish-white spots on the underside of leaves, often appearing water-soaked on the upper surface. Severe infection can lead to premature defoliation.

*   **Foliar Spray:**
    *   **Mancozeb 75% WP** at 2.0-2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5-3.0 g/L of water).
    *   **Chlorothalonil 75% WP** at 1.5-2.0 kg/acre (or 2.0-2.5 g/L of water).
    *   **Carbendazim 50% WP** at 500 g/acre (or 1.0 g/L of water).
    *   **Propiconazole 25% EC** at 200-250 ml/acre (or 0.5 ml/L of water).
    *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC** at 200 ml/acre (or 0.5 ml/L of water).

### General Recommendations for Fungal Disease Management:

*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate cotton with non-host crops to break disease cycles.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available, choose cotton varieties known to have resistance or tolerance to common fungal diseases in Haryana.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure proper nutrient management to enhance plant vigor and natural resistance.
*   **Timely Sowing:** Adhere to recommended sowing dates to avoid periods of high disease pressure.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Maintain adequate plant spacing to improve air circulation and reduce humidity within the canopy.
*   **Water Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation late in the day, which can prolong leaf wetness and favor fungal growth.
*   **Scouting:** Regularly monitor your fields for early signs of disease to allow for timely intervention.

Always follow the manufacturer's instructions for fungicide application, including dosage, timing, and safety precautions.
