As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling sucking pests in Cotton (Kapas) in Haryana.

Sucking pests like Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips are major challenges in cotton cultivation, causing direct damage by feeding and indirect damage by transmitting viral diseases (e.g., Cotton Leaf Curl Virus by whiteflies).

**Regarding "Psylla":**
This is not known to affect Cotton (Kapas) as a significant pest in Haryana or other cotton-growing regions of India. If you are observing unusual symptoms or insects that you suspect might be Psylla, it is advisable to bring a sample to the nearest Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or HAU expert for accurate identification.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies for Sucking Pests:**

1.  **Resistant/Tolerant Varieties:** Choose cotton varieties recommended by HAU that show tolerance or resistance to major sucking pests, especially whiteflies.
2.  **Timely Sowing:** Adhere to the recommended sowing window to avoid peak pest infestations.
3.  **Balanced Nutrition:** Avoid excessive nitrogenous fertilizers, as they promote lush vegetative growth, making plants more attractive to sucking pests. Use recommended doses of NPK.
4.  **Weed Management:** Remove weeds from the field and surrounding areas, as many weeds act as alternate hosts for these pests.
5.  **Monitoring and Scouting:** Regularly scout your fields (at least twice a week), especially the undersides of leaves, to detect pest populations early.
6.  **Conservation of Natural Enemies:** Avoid indiscriminate use of broad-spectrum insecticides that can harm beneficial insects like ladybird beetles, lacewings, and parasitoids, which naturally control sucking pests.
7.  **Yellow Sticky Traps:** Install yellow sticky traps (15-20 traps per acre) at canopy height to monitor and mass-trap whiteflies, thrips, and leafhoppers.
8.  **Neem-based Formulations:** In the early stages of infestation, neem oil (Azadirachtin 1500 ppm @ 5 ml/L of water) or other neem-based formulations can be effective in deterring pests and disrupting their life cycle.

**Chemical Control Measures (Based on CIBRC Approved Technical Chemicals):**

Chemical intervention should be considered when pest populations exceed Economic Threshold Levels (ETL). Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

**For Aphids, Leafhoppers, and Thrips (especially in early stages):**

*   **Seed Treatment (for early protection):**
    *   **Imidacloprid 600 FS**: 5-7 ml per kg of seed.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 70 WS**: 4.2 g per kg of seed.
*   **Foliar Spray:**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL**: 125-150 ml per acre (in 200-250 L of water).
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG**: 50-100 g per acre (in 200-250 L of water).
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP**: 50-100 g per acre (in 200-250 L of water).
    *   **Dinotefuran 20% SG**: 60-80 g per acre (in 200-250 L of water).
    *   **Fipronil 5% SC**: 600-800 ml per acre (in 200-250 L of water) - effective against thrips and leafhoppers.
    *   **Pymetrozine 50% WG**: 120 g per acre (in 200-250 L of water) - effective against aphids and leafhoppers.

**For Whiteflies (a critical pest in Haryana):**

*   **Early Stage/Low to Moderate Infestation:**
    *   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC**: 200 ml per acre (in 200-250 L of water) - also effective against mites.
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC**: 500-600 ml per acre (in 200-250 L of water) - targets nymphs.
    *   **Pyriproxyfen 10% EC**: 500 ml per acre (in 200-250 L of water) - targets nymphs and eggs (Insect Growth Regulator).
    *   **Flonicamid 50% WG**: 60 g per acre (in 200-250 L of water).
*   **Moderate to High Infestation:**
    *   **Diafenthiuron 50% WP**: 250 g per acre (in 200-250 L of water) - also effective against thrips and mites.
    *   **Sulphoxaflor 50% WG**: 40-60 g per acre (in 200-250 L of water).
    *   **Fenpropathrin 30% EC**: 250 ml per acre (in 200-250 L of water) - use judiciously and rotate.
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP**: 50-100 g per acre (in 200-250 L of water).

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Spray Volume:** Ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves, by using adequate spray volume (200-250 L of water per acre for field crops, adjust based on crop canopy).
*   **Rotation of Chemicals:** To prevent resistance development, always rotate insecticides with different modes of action. Do not use the same chemical or chemicals from the same group repeatedly.
*   **Safety Precautions:** Always read and follow the instructions on the insecticide label, including dosage, application method, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and safety precautions for handlers.
*   **Consult Experts:** For specific recommendations based on your field conditions and pest pressure, always consult with your local HAU extension specialist or KVK scientist.
