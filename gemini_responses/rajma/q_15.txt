As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in Rajma in Haryana:

### Grasshopper

Grasshoppers can cause significant damage to Rajma by feeding on leaves, stems, and pods. Early detection and management are crucial.

**Control Measures:**

1.  **Monitoring and Mechanical Control:** Regularly inspect your fields, especially during the early growth stages. In small infestations, hand-picking and destroying grasshoppers can be effective.
2.  **Chemical Control:** If the infestation is severe and causing economic damage, chemical control may be necessary. Apply insecticides when grasshopper nymphs are young and most vulnerable.

    *   **Malathion** 50% EC: Apply 1.25 litres per acre mixed in 500 litres of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: Apply 200-250 ml per acre mixed in 200-400 litres of water.
    *   **Quinalphos** 25% EC: Apply 1.0 litre per acre mixed in 500 litres of water.

### Painted bug

This is not known to affect Rajma as a significant pest requiring specific control measures. Painted bug (Bagrada hilaris) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops like mustard, cabbage, and cauliflower.

### Red cotton bug

This is not known to affect Rajma as a significant pest requiring specific control measures. Red cotton bug (Dysdercus cingulatus) is primarily a pest of cotton and other malvaceous plants.

### Black ants

Black ants are generally not direct pests of Rajma plants that cause significant damage requiring insecticidal control. Their presence in the field is often indicative of other issues:

*   **Honeydew-producing pests:** Ants are often attracted to the honeydew secreted by sap-sucking insects like aphids, whiteflies, or mealybugs. If ants are present in large numbers and are seen "tending" to other insects on your Rajma plants, it suggests an underlying infestation of these primary pests. In such cases, the focus should be on controlling the primary sap-sucking pest, which will automatically reduce the ant population.
*   **Nesting:** Ants may nest in the soil, which can sometimes disturb roots, but this rarely causes significant damage to healthy Rajma plants.
*   **Scavenging:** They might be feeding on fallen seeds, plant debris, or other organic matter.

**Control Measures for Black Ants (if deemed necessary due to indirect damage or nuisance):**

*   **Control primary pests:** If ants are tending to sap-sucking insects, identify and control those pests using appropriate insecticides (e.g., **Imidacloprid** or **Thiamethoxam** for aphids/whiteflies, if present and causing damage).
*   **Cultural practices:** Maintain good field sanitation to reduce food sources for ants.

Always follow the instructions on the pesticide label for dosage, application method, and safety precautions. Ensure proper protective gear is used during application.
