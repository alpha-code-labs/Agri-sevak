Namaste Kisan Bhai,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing pests in Rajma (Kidney Bean) in Haryana.

It is crucial to adopt an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, mechanical, biological, and judicious chemical methods for sustainable pest control.

Here's how to control the mentioned pests in Rajma:

### 1. Borers (Stem Borer, Pod Borer)

Borers, such as the Bean Stem Fly (*Ophiomyia phaseoli*) in early stages and Pod Borers (*Helicoverpa armigera*, *Maruca vitrata*) during flowering and pod formation, can significantly damage Rajma.

**Cultural and Mechanical Practices:**
*   **Timely Sowing:** Sow Rajma at the recommended time to avoid peak pest incidence.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy crop residues and weeds that can harbor pests.
*   **Monitoring:** Regularly scout your fields, especially during the seedling stage for stem fly damage (wilting, yellowing) and during flowering/podding for pod borer larvae and damage.
*   **Pheromone Traps:** Install pheromone traps for *Helicoverpa armigera* at 5 traps per acre to monitor adult moth activity and mass trap if population is high.

**Chemical Control (Apply only upon reaching Economic Threshold Level - ETL):**

*   **For Stem Fly (early stage, if severe):**
    *   **Thiamethoxam** 70 WS as seed treatment @ 3-5 g per kg seed.
    *   Foliar spray of **Thiamethoxam** 25 WG @ 125 g per hectare in 500 litres of water.
    *   Foliar spray of **Imidacloprid** 17.8 SL @ 125-250 ml per hectare in 500 litres of water.
*   **For Pod Borers (at flowering/podding stage):**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5 SC @ 150 ml per hectare in 500 litres of water.
    *   **Flubendiamide** 20 WG @ 240 g per hectare in 500 litres of water.
    *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5 SG @ 220 g per hectare in 500 litres of water.
    *   **Indoxacarb** 14.5 SC @ 500 ml per hectare in 500 litres of water.

### 2. Caterpillars (General Leaf Feeders, Semi-loopers)

Various caterpillar species can feed on Rajma leaves, causing defoliation. This includes pests like *Spodoptera litura* (Tobacco caterpillar) and semi-loopers.

**Cultural and Mechanical Practices:**
*   **Hand Picking:** In small areas, hand-pick and destroy larger caterpillars.
*   **Bird Perches:** Install bird perches in the field to encourage predatory birds.
*   **Monitoring:** Regularly check the underside of leaves for eggs and young larvae.

**Chemical Control (Apply only upon reaching ETL):**
*   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5 SC @ 150 ml per hectare in 500 litres of water.
*   **Flubendiamide** 20 WG @ 240 g per hectare in 500 litres of water.
*   **Emamectin benzoate** 5 SG @ 220 g per hectare in 500 litres of water.
*   **Indoxacarb** 14.5 SC @ 500 ml per hectare in 500 litres of water.
*   **Novaluron** 10 EC @ 750 ml per hectare in 500 litres of water (Insect Growth Regulator, effective on younger larvae).
*   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5 EC @ 200-250 ml per hectare in 500 litres of water (broad-spectrum, use judiciously).

### 3. Diamondback Moth (DBM)

**This is not known to affect Rajma.** Diamondback moth (*Plutella xylostella*) is a major pest of cruciferous crops like cabbage, cauliflower, and mustard, not legumes like Rajma. Therefore, no control measures are needed for DBM in Rajma.

### 4. Leaf Folder

While not a primary pest of Rajma, some general lepidopteran larvae might cause leaf folding. If you observe leaves folded and tied together by silken threads with larvae inside, it's likely a general caterpillar pest.

**Cultural and Mechanical Practices:**
*   **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect plants for folded leaves and the presence of larvae.

**Chemical Control (Apply only upon reaching ETL):**
The same insecticides recommended for general caterpillars will be effective against leaf folders:
*   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5 SC @ 150 ml per hectare in 500 litres of water.
*   **Flubendiamide** 20 WG @ 240 g per hectare in 500 litres of water.
*   **Emamectin benzoate** 5 SG @ 220 g per hectare in 500 litres of water.
*   **Indoxacarb** 14.5 SC @ 500 ml per hectare in 500 litres of water.

**Important Considerations for Chemical Application:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label carefully, including dosage, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Ensure proper spray coverage by using the recommended water volume (typically 500 litres per hectare for field crops).
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.
*   Apply insecticides preferably in the morning or evening to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.

For specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions, it is always advisable to consult with your local Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or agricultural extension officer.
