As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Rajma (Kidney Bean) in Haryana. Always refer to the specific product label for precise dosage and application instructions, as these can vary.

### General Cultural Practices for Fungal Disease Management:

*   **Use Certified Disease-Free Seeds:** This is crucial to prevent seed-borne diseases.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Whenever available, choose Rajma varieties known for resistance to common fungal diseases in your region.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice a 2-3 year rotation with non-host crops to break the disease cycle.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest to reduce inoculum for the next season.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to improve air circulation, which reduces humidity and fungal growth.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced fertilizers to promote healthy plant growth and improve natural resistance. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can make plants more susceptible.
*   **Irrigation Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day, to minimize leaf wetness duration. Drip irrigation is preferable.

### Specific Fungal Diseases and Their Control:

#### 1. Alternaria Leaf Spot/Blight (Alternaria spp.)

This disease causes small, dark, concentric spots on leaves, which can enlarge and coalesce, leading to blight.

*   **Cultural Practices:** Use resistant varieties, crop rotation, remove plant debris, proper plant spacing.
*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
    *   **Mancozeb** @ 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L of water)
    *   **Chlorothalonil** @ 2 kg/acre (or 2 g/L of water)
    *   **Azoxystrobin** @ 200 ml/acre (or 0.5 ml/L of water)
    *   **Propiconazole** @ 200 ml/acre (or 0.5 ml/L of water)

#### 2. Anthracnose (Colletotrichum lindemuthianum)

A significant disease causing dark, sunken lesions on pods, stems, and leaves, often with a reddish-brown margin.

*   **Cultural Practices:** Use certified disease-free seeds, resistant varieties, crop rotation, sanitation, avoid overhead irrigation.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Seed Treatment:**
        *   **Carbendazim** @ 1-2 g/kg seed
        *   **Thiram** @ 2-3 g/kg seed
    *   **Foliar Spray (if disease appears):**
        *   **Carbendazim** @ 500 g/acre (or 1 g/L of water)
        *   **Mancozeb** @ 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L of water)
        *   **Azoxystrobin** @ 200 ml/acre (or 0.5 ml/L of water)
        *   **Propiconazole** @ 200 ml/acre (or 0.5 ml/L of water)

#### 3. Blast

This is not known to affect Rajma as a primary disease. Blast is primarily a disease of rice caused by *Pyricularia oryzae*.

#### 4. Fungal Blights (e.g., Ascochyta Blight/Leaf Spot)

Fungal blights can cause various symptoms like leaf spots, stem lesions, and pod discoloration, leading to defoliation and yield loss.

*   **Cultural Practices:** Use disease-free seeds, crop rotation, remove infected debris, proper spacing.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Seed Treatment:**
        *   **Carbendazim** @ 1-2 g/kg seed
    *   **Foliar Spray:**
        *   **Mancozeb** @ 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L of water)
        *   **Chlorothalonil** @ 2 kg/acre (or 2 g/L of water)
        *   **Azoxystrobin** @ 200 ml/acre (or 0.5 ml/L of water)

#### 5. Brown Spot (Cercospora canescens)

Characterized by small, circular to angular brown spots on leaves, which can enlarge and cause premature defoliation.

*   **Cultural Practices:** Use resistant varieties, crop rotation, sanitation.
*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
    *   **Mancozeb** @ 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L of water)
    *   **Chlorothalonil** @ 2 kg/acre (or 2 g/L of water)
    *   **Carbendazim** @ 500 g/acre (or 1 g/L of water)

#### 6. Downy Mildew (Peronospora parasitica or similar)

Causes yellowish patches on the upper leaf surface and a grayish-purple, fuzzy growth on the corresponding lower surface.

*   **Cultural Practices:** Use resistant varieties, good air circulation, avoid overhead irrigation, remove infected leaves.
*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
    *   **Mancozeb** @ 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L of water)
    *   **Propineb** @ 2 kg/acre (or 2 g/L of water)
    *   **Dimethomorph** @ 250-300 g/acre (or 0.5-0.6 g/L of water)
    *   **Metalaxyl + Mancozeb** (combination product) @ 1 kg/acre (or 2 g/L of water)

#### 7. Powdery Mildew (Erysiphe polygoni or similar)

Appears as white, powdery patches on leaves, stems, and pods, which can spread and cover the entire plant, hindering photosynthesis.

*   **Cultural Practices:** Use resistant varieties, proper spacing, remove infected plant parts.
*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
    *   **Sulphur** (wettable powder) @ 2-3 kg/acre (or 4-6 g/L of water)
    *   **Myclobutanil** @ 200-250 ml/acre (or 0.4-0.5 ml/L of water)
    *   **Hexaconazole** @ 200-250 ml/acre (or 0.4-0.5 ml/L of water)
    *   **Azoxystrobin** @ 200 ml/acre (or 0.5 ml/L of water)

#### 8. Grey Mildew

This is not known to affect Rajma.

### Important Considerations:

*   **Integrated Disease Management (IDM):** Always combine cultural practices with chemical control for the most effective and sustainable disease management.
*   **Timing of Application:** Apply fungicides preventively or at the very first sign of disease for best results.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of fungicide resistance.
*   **Adjuvants:** Consider using a suitable spreader/sticker with your fungicide spray to improve coverage and efficacy, especially on waxy leaf surfaces.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) while handling and applying chemicals.
*   **Local Consultation:** For specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and current disease pressure, consult with local agricultural extension officers or HAU experts.
