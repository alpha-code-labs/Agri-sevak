As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling soil pests like termites and root-knot nematodes in Rajma (Kidney Beans) in Haryana. Both these pests are known to affect Rajma cultivation and can significantly impact yield if not managed properly.

### **1. Termite Control in Rajma**

Termites (e.g., *Odontotermes obesus*, *Microtermes obesi*) can cause significant damage to Rajma by feeding on germinating seeds, roots, and the base of the stem, leading to wilting and plant death.

**A. Cultural and Mechanical Practices:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove all crop residues, stubble, and woody debris from the field before sowing, as these can serve as food sources and breeding sites for termites.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** Ploughing the field deeply during summer exposes termite colonies to the sun and predators, disrupting their nests.
*   **Proper Irrigation:** Maintain adequate soil moisture, as termites prefer dry conditions. However, avoid waterlogging.

**B. Chemical Control (Pre-sowing/Sowing Application):**
For effective control, chemical treatment should be done before or at the time of sowing.

*   **Soil Treatment:**
    *   Apply **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** at 2.0-2.5 Litres per acre mixed with 200-400 Litres of water and drench the soil, or mix with 20-25 kg of sand and broadcast evenly before the last ploughing, followed by incorporation into the soil.
    *   Alternatively, apply **Fipronil 0.3% GR** at 6.6-10 kg per acre by broadcasting evenly and incorporating into the soil before sowing.

### **2. Nematode (Root-Knot Nematodes) Control in Rajma**

Root-knot nematodes (*Meloidogyne* spp.) are a major concern for Rajma, causing characteristic galls or knots on the roots. This impairs the plant's ability to absorb water and nutrients, leading to stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, reduced nodulation, and significant yield losses.

**A. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate Rajma with non-host crops like cereals (e.g., wheat, maize, sorghum) for at least 2-3 years. Avoid continuous cultivation of susceptible crops.
*   **Summer Ploughing/Solarization:** Deep ploughing during hot summer months exposes nematode eggs and larvae to lethal temperatures. Soil solarization (covering moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets during peak summer) can also reduce nematode populations.
*   **Use of Organic Amendments:** Incorporating well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost at 10-15 tonnes per acre can improve soil health and promote beneficial microorganisms that suppress nematodes.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** If available and suitable for Haryana conditions, choose Rajma varieties known to have resistance or tolerance to root-knot nematodes.

**B. Chemical Control (At Sowing):**
Chemical nematicides can be applied at the time of sowing to protect young plants.

*   **Granular Application:**
    *   Apply **Carbofuran 3% G** at 10-13 kg per acre by broadcasting evenly and incorporating into the soil at the time of sowing.
    *   Alternatively, apply **Phorate 10% G** at 10 kg per acre by broadcasting evenly and incorporating into the soil at the time of sowing.

**C. Biological Control:**
Biological nematicides offer an eco-friendly approach and can be integrated with other control methods.

*   **Bio-nematicides:**
    *   Apply **Paecilomyces lilacinus** (or *Purpureocillium lilacinum*) based formulations at 2.5-5 kg per acre, mixed with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed FYM or compost, and broadcast evenly before sowing or at the time of sowing. These fungi parasitize nematode eggs and females.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully, including dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and current pest pressure.
*   Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods, is always recommended for sustainable pest control.
