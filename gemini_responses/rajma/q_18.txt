As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the use of growth regulators and hormones in Rajma cultivation in Haryana:

It is crucial to understand the specific role and potential impact of each substance on Rajma.

*   **Ethephon (commonly sold as Ethrel)**
    *   **Ethephon** is a plant growth regulator that releases ethylene. While ethylene plays a role in plant development, the direct application of **Ethephon** as a routine growth regulator for yield enhancement or specific developmental stages in Rajma (French bean) is **not a commonly recommended practice** in Haryana. Its use in other crops is for purposes like fruit ripening, defoliation, or flowering induction, which are generally not beneficial or can even be detrimental (e.g., causing flower drop) in Rajma if not precisely managed. Therefore, its application is generally not advised for Rajma under typical cultivation practices.

*   **2,4-D**
    *   **2,4-D** is primarily a synthetic auxin widely used as a **broadleaf herbicide**. Rajma is a broadleaf crop. Applying **2,4-D** at any concentration typically used in agriculture will act as a herbicide and **severely damage or kill the Rajma crop**. While extremely low concentrations of auxins can act as growth regulators, the use of **2,4-D** as a growth regulator in Rajma is **not recommended or practiced** in field conditions due to the high risk of phytotoxicity and crop destruction. It should be strictly avoided in Rajma fields.

*   **Boron**
    *   Boron is an essential micronutrient vital for cell wall formation, sugar transport, flowering, and pod setting in Rajma. Deficiency can lead to poor flowering and pod development.
    *   **Recommendation for Boron application (if deficiency is suspected or confirmed by soil test):**
        *   **Foliar Application:**
            *   Mix **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (e.g., Solubor) at a concentration of 0.1% (1 g per litre of water) or **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate) at 0.2% (2 g per litre of water).
            *   Apply 200-250 litres of this solution per acre (i.e., 200-250 g of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** or 400-500 g of **Borax** per acre).
            *   Spray at the pre-flowering stage and repeat if necessary after 15-20 days, especially during pod development.
        *   **Soil Application (only if severe deficiency is confirmed by soil test):**
            *   Apply 1-2 kg of actual **Boron** per acre. This typically translates to 10-20 kg of **Borax** (which contains approximately 11% Boron) or 6-12 kg of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (which contains approximately 17-20% Boron) per acre, mixed with sand or fertilizer and broadcast evenly before sowing.
            *   **Caution:** Boron can be toxic to plants if applied in excess. Always base soil application on a soil test report. Foliar application is generally safer for correcting mild to moderate deficiencies.
