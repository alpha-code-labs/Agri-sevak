As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified seed and soil treatment processes for Rajma cultivation in Haryana to ensure healthy crop establishment and mitigate early-season challenges.

### Recommended Seed Treatment Process for Rajma

Seed treatment is crucial for protecting germinating seeds and young seedlings from seed-borne and soil-borne diseases, as well as early insect pests, ensuring better stand establishment.

1.  **Fungal Protection (against damping-off, root rot, anthracnose):**
    *   Treat seeds with a broad-spectrum fungicide.
    *   **Option 1:** **Carboxin 37.5% + Thiram 37.5% DS** at 2.5 g per kg of seed.
    *   **Option 2:** **Carbendazim 50% WP** at 2 g per kg of seed.
    *   **Option 3:** **Thiram 75% WS** at 2.5 g per kg of seed.

2.  **Insect Protection (against early sucking pests like aphids, thrips, and shoot fly):**
    *   After fungicide treatment, apply a systemic insecticide.
    *   **Option 1:** **Imidacloprid 600 FS** at 5-7 ml per kg of seed.
    *   **Option 2:** **Thiamethoxam 30% FS** at 10 ml per kg of seed.

3.  **Bio-fertilizer Inoculation (for Nitrogen fixation and Phosphorus solubilization):**
    *   This is the final step and should be done just before sowing.
    *   **Rhizobium leguminosarum** (specific strain for common bean/Rajma) at 200-250 g for 10-15 kg of seed.
    *   **PSB (Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria)** at 200-250 g for 10-15 kg of seed.

**Order of Application:**
Apply fungicide first, allow the seeds to dry slightly, then apply the insecticide, let them dry again, and finally, apply the bio-fertilizers just before sowing. This sequence prevents chemical agents from harming the beneficial microbes.

### Recommended Soil Treatment Process for Rajma

Soil treatment aims to improve soil health, suppress soil-borne pathogens and pests, and enhance nutrient availability.

1.  **Bio-fungicide Application (for soil-borne diseases like root rot, wilt):**
    *   Incorporate beneficial microbial antagonists into the soil.
    *   **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum** at 2.5 kg per acre. Mix the bio-fungicide with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost. Broadcast this mixture evenly and incorporate it into the soil 7-10 days before sowing.

2.  **Soil Insect Pest Management (for termites, cutworms, white grubs):**
    *   If there is a history of soil insect pests, consider targeted application.
    *   **Option 1 (Liquid):** **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** at 2-4 L per acre. Apply as a drench or mix with irrigation water during pre-sowing irrigation.
    *   **Option 2 (Granular):** **Fipronil 0.3% GR** at 10-15 kg per acre. Broadcast and incorporate into the soil during final land preparation.

3.  **Nematode Management (if nematodes are a known problem):**
    *   **Purpureocillium lilacinum** (formerly Paecilomyces lilacinus) at 2.5 kg per acre. Mix with 50-100 kg of FYM/compost and incorporate into the soil 7-10 days before sowing, similar to Trichoderma.

4.  **Organic Matter Enrichment:**
    *   Incorporate 5-10 tonnes per acre of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost during land preparation. This significantly improves soil structure, water holding capacity, and overall soil fertility, providing a healthy environment for Rajma growth.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always conduct a soil test to determine specific nutrient deficiencies and adjust fertilizer application accordingly.
*   Follow an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods for sustainable crop production.
*   Ensure proper moisture conditions during seed treatment and sowing for optimal efficacy of treatments.
