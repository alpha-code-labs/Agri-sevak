Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I understand your concern regarding pest management in Rajma. Let's address the control of Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies in your Rajma crop based on scientifically verified advice for Haryana.

**1. Beetles and Weevils in Rajma:**

Beetles and Weevils can cause damage to Rajma, particularly during the early vegetative stages (e.g., Flea Beetles, Stem Weevils) by feeding on leaves and stems. Later, some species like the Pulse Beetle (Callosobruchus spp.) can initiate infestation in the field during pod development and continue to cause significant damage in storage.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Beetles and Weevils:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Timely Sowing:** Ensure timely sowing to help plants establish vigorously and potentially escape peak pest periods.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove crop residues and weeds from the field, as they can harbour pests.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid continuous cultivation of legumes in the same field to break pest cycles.
*   **Monitoring:** Regularly scout your fields, especially young plants, for signs of leaf damage, stem girdling, or the presence of adult beetles/weevils.
*   **Chemical Control (if necessary, based on economic threshold levels):**

    *   **For early season pests (Flea Beetles, Stem Weevils):**
        *   **Seed Treatment:**
            *   **Imidacloprid** 600 FS at 5-7 ml per kg seed.
            *   **Thiamethoxam** 30 FS at 5-7 ml per kg seed.
        *   **Foliar Spray (if infestation is high after emergence):**
            *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL at 125 ml per acre (mixed in 200-300 L water).
            *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG at 100 g per acre (mixed in 200-300 L water).

    *   **For general leaf-feeding beetles and to prevent field infestation of Pulse Beetle (at podding stage):**
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 200 ml per acre (mixed in 200-300 L water).
        *   **Cypermethrin** 25% EC at 100-120 ml per acre (mixed in 200-300 L water).
        *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC at 60 ml per acre (mixed in 200-300 L water).

**2. Sawflies in Rajma:**

This is not known to affect Rajma as a significant pest in Haryana. Sawflies are primarily pests of cruciferous crops like mustard. Therefore, specific control measures for sawflies in Rajma are generally not required.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read the label instructions carefully before using any pesticide.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application.
*   Observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) for each chemical to ensure food safety.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and current pest pressure.
