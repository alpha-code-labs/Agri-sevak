As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), here are the recommended cultivation practices for Rajma in Haryana:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   Rajma should be sown in rows using a seed drill. This method ensures uniform seed distribution, proper depth, and facilitates subsequent intercultural operations.
    *   The recommended pattern is single rows.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   The ideal planting depth for Rajma seeds is 5-7 cm. Sowing at this depth ensures good moisture availability for germination and proper anchorage for the developing seedling.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   **Row-to-row spacing:** Maintain a distance of 45 cm between rows. This spacing allows for adequate light penetration, air circulation, and ease of weeding and other field operations.
    *   **Plant-to-plant spacing:** Maintain a distance of 10-15 cm within the row. This ensures optimal plant population and reduces competition for nutrients and light among individual plants.

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   The recommended seed dose for Rajma is 80-100 kg/acre. This rate is crucial for achieving the desired plant population and maximizing yield potential under Haryana conditions.
