As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding rust diseases in Rajma (Kidney Bean) for Haryana.

It is important to clarify that not all rust diseases affect Rajma. The primary rust disease affecting Rajma is commonly known as Bean Rust, caused by *Uromyces appendiculatus*.

Here is the breakdown for each rust type mentioned:

*   **Black Rust (Stem Rust):** This is not known to affect Rajma.
*   **Brown Rust (Leaf Rust):** This is not known to affect Rajma.
*   **Yellow Rust (Stripe Rust):** This is not known to affect Rajma.
*   **White Rust:** This is not known to affect Rajma.

*   **Red Rust:** This term is often used generally for rust diseases. In Rajma (Kidney Bean), the specific rust disease is caused by *Uromyces appendiculatus*, commonly referred to as **Bean Rust**.

**Control Measures for Bean Rust (*Uromyces appendiculatus*) in Rajma:**

Bean rust manifests as reddish-brown pustules, primarily on the leaves, which can lead to defoliation and significant yield loss under severe conditions.

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available and suitable for Haryana's agro-climatic conditions, planting rust-resistant Rajma varieties is the most effective long-term solution. Consult with HAU extension services for recommended varieties.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops for at least 2-3 years to reduce the build-up of inoculum in the soil and plant debris.
*   **Sanitation:** After harvest, collect and destroy all infected plant debris to eliminate overwintering spores.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to improve air circulation within the crop canopy, which helps reduce humidity and inhibits spore germination and disease spread.
*   **Irrigation Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation late in the day, as prolonged leaf wetness promotes rust development. Drip irrigation is preferable.
*   **Weed Control:** Manage weeds effectively, as some can act as alternative hosts for the rust pathogen.

**2. Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
Fungicides should be applied preventatively or at the first appearance of disease symptoms, especially during periods favorable for rust development (moderate temperatures and high humidity). Always adhere strictly to the label instructions for dosage, application method, and safety precautions.

*   **Propiconazole** (25% EC): Apply at a rate of 0.5 ml per litre of water (approximately 200 ml per acre, depending on spray volume).
*   **Tebuconazole** (25.9% EC): Apply at a rate of 0.75 ml per litre of water (approximately 300 ml per acre, depending on spray volume).
*   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC): Apply at a rate of 0.5 ml per litre of water (approximately 200 ml per acre, depending on spray volume).
*   **Difenoconazole** (25% EC): Apply at a rate of 0.5 ml per litre of water (approximately 200 ml per acre, depending on spray volume).
*   **Mancozeb** (75% WP): Apply at a rate of 2.5 grams per litre of water (approximately 1 kg per acre, depending on spray volume). This is a contact fungicide and is often used preventatively or in rotation with systemic fungicides.
*   **Sulphur** (80% WP): Apply at a rate of 2.5 grams per litre of water (approximately 1 kg per acre, depending on spray volume). This can be used as a preventive measure or at early stages.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of fungicide resistance in the pathogen population.
*   Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage during spraying for optimal efficacy.
*   For the most current and specific recommendations tailored to your local conditions and Rajma variety, please consult with your local HAU Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or agricultural extension officer.
