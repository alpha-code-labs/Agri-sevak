As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned conditions in Rajma (common bean) in Haryana:

### Control Measures for Scab, Canker, Gummosis, and Lichen in Rajma

**1. Scab (Bean Scab - *Elsinoë phaseoli*)**

Yes, Bean Scab is a known fungal disease affecting Rajma. It causes small, reddish-brown, sunken lesions with dark borders on pods, leaves, and stems.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Use certified disease-free seeds.
    *   Practice crop rotation with non-host crops for at least 2-3 years.
    *   Ensure good field sanitation by removing and destroying infected plant debris.
    *   Avoid overhead irrigation, especially during flowering and pod development, to reduce leaf wetness.
    *   Maintain proper plant spacing to improve air circulation.
*   **Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
    *   Apply fungicides preventively or at the first sign of disease, especially during humid conditions.
    *   **Mancozeb**: Apply at 2.0-2.5 kg/acre (or 2.0-2.5 g/L of water) as a foliar spray. Repeat at 10-15 day intervals if necessary.
    *   **Chlorothalonil**: Apply at 1.5-2.0 kg/acre (or 1.5-2.0 g/L of water) as a foliar spray. Repeat at 10-15 day intervals if necessary.

**2. Canker (Bacterial Canker - *Clavibacter michiganensis* subsp. *michiganensis*)**

Yes, Bacterial Canker is a significant bacterial disease affecting Rajma. It causes water-soaked lesions on leaves, stems, and pods, which later turn necrotic and sunken, sometimes with a reddish-brown margin. Stem cankers can lead to wilting.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Practices (Most Critical for Bacterial Diseases):**
    *   **Use certified disease-free seeds.** This is the most important control measure as the bacteria are primarily seed-borne.
    *   Practice strict crop rotation with non-host crops for at least 3-4 years.
    *   Avoid working in fields when plants are wet, as this can spread bacteria.
    *   Sanitize farm equipment thoroughly after working in infected fields.
    *   Remove and destroy infected plant debris immediately.
    *   Avoid overhead irrigation.
*   **Chemical Control (Bactericides):**
    *   Chemical control for bacterial diseases is generally suppressive, not curative. It can help reduce spread but will not eliminate an established infection.
    *   **Copper Oxychloride**: Apply at 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L of water) as a foliar spray. This can help suppress bacterial spread, especially if applied preventively or at early stages.

**3. Gummosis**

This is not known to affect Rajma. Gummosis is primarily a condition associated with woody perennial plants (like fruit trees) where gum exudes from the bark, often in response to stress, injury, or specific pathogens. Rajma is an herbaceous annual plant and does not exhibit true gummosis.

**4. Lichen**

This is not known to affect Rajma. Lichens are symbiotic organisms (fungus and alga) that typically grow on inert surfaces like rocks, tree bark, or soil. They are non-parasitic and do not cause disease or harm to herbaceous crop plants like Rajma. Their presence on a living Rajma plant would be highly unusual and not indicative of a plant health problem.
