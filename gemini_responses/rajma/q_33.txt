As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an Integrated Weed Management (IWM) approach for effective and sustainable weed control in Rajma (Kidney Bean) cultivation in Haryana. This combines cultural, mechanical, and chemical methods.

**Integrated Weed Management (IWM) Strategy for Rajma:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Clean Seed:** Always use certified, weed-free Rajma seeds to prevent the introduction of new weed species, especially parasitic ones like Amarbail.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate Rajma with non-host crops to break the life cycle of specific weeds.
    *   **Timely Sowing:** Sowing Rajma at the optimal time ensures vigorous crop growth, allowing it to better compete with weeds.
    *   **Proper Spacing and Nutrient Management:** Maintain recommended plant spacing and provide balanced nutrition to promote a healthy, competitive crop canopy that shades out weeds.

2.  **Mechanical Control:**
    *   **Hand Weeding/Hoeing:** This is highly effective and crucial for Rajma. Perform 1-2 hand weedings at 20-25 days after sowing (DAS) and again at 40-45 DAS. This is particularly important for removing parasitic weeds like Amarbail and for controlling weeds that escape herbicide application.

3.  **Chemical Control (Herbicides):**
    *   Always ensure proper calibration of sprayers and uniform application. Use sufficient water volume (200-300 litres per acre) for optimal efficacy.

    **A. Pre-Emergence Herbicide (within 3 days of sowing):**
    *   **For Broadleaf Weeds, Narrowleaf Weeds (Grasses), and Amarbail (suppression):**
        *   **Pendimethalin 30% EC:** Apply 3.3 litres per acre (equivalent to 1.0 kg active ingredient per acre) mixed in 200-300 litres of water, within 3 days of sowing. This forms a chemical barrier that prevents weed germination.

    **B. Post-Emergence Herbicides (20-25 days after sowing, when weeds are at 2-4 leaf stage):**
    *   **For Narrowleaf Weeds (Grasses like Phalaris minor):**
        *   **Quizalofop-p-ethyl 5% EC:** Apply 400-500 ml per acre mixed in 200-300 litres of water.
        *   **Fenoxaprop-p-ethyl 9% EC:** Apply 250 ml per acre mixed in 200-300 litres of water.
        *   *These herbicides are selective for grasses and generally safe for Rajma.*

    *   **For Broadleaf Weeds (Bathu, Congress grass):**
        *   **Imazethapyr 10% SL:** Apply 100 ml per acre mixed in 200-300 litres of water. Apply when weeds are at the 2-3 leaf stage. *Use with caution as Rajma can show some sensitivity; ensure correct dosage and application timing.*
        *   **Bentazone 48% SL:** Apply 800-1000 ml per acre mixed in 200-300 litres of water. Apply when weeds are at the 2-4 leaf stage. *This is a good option for broadleaf weeds in pulse crops.*

    **C. Specific Weed Control:**

    *   **Amarbail (Cuscuta spp.):**
        *   **Prevention is key:** Use clean, certified seeds.
        *   **Manual Removal:** Immediately hand-pull any infested Rajma plants or Amarbail patches before it sets seed. This is the most effective method for existing infestations.
        *   **Chemical (Spot Application with Extreme Caution):** For severe, localized patches of Amarbail, a highly directed spot application of **Glyphosate 41% SL** (10-15 ml per litre of water) can be used. *Ensure absolutely no contact with Rajma plants, as it is a non-selective herbicide and will kill the crop.* This is generally recommended for non-crop areas or heavily infested patches where crop loss is already significant.

    *   **Orobanche:**
        *   This is not known to affect Rajma. Orobanche typically parasitizes other crops like mustard, tomato, brinjal, and some other legumes, but not Rajma (Phaseolus vulgaris).

**Summary of Weed Control for Specific Weeds in Rajma:**

*   **Broadleaf Weeds (Bathu, Congress grass):**
    *   Pre-emergence: **Pendimethalin 30% EC**.
    *   Post-emergence: **Imazethapyr 10% SL** or **Bentazone 48% SL**.
    *   Mechanical: Hand weeding.

*   **Narrowleaf Weeds (Phalaris minor):**
    *   Pre-emergence: **Pendimethalin 30% EC**.
    *   Post-emergence: **Quizalofop-p-ethyl 5% EC** or **Fenoxaprop-p-ethyl 9% EC**.
    *   Mechanical: Hand weeding.

*   **Amarbail:**
    *   Prevention: Use clean seeds.
    *   Mechanical: Hand-pulling.
    *   Chemical: **Pendimethalin 30% EC** (pre-emergence for suppression). **Glyphosate 41% SL** (spot application with extreme caution).

*   **Orobanche:**
    *   This is not known to affect Rajma.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the label instructions of any herbicide before use.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension specialists for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions.
