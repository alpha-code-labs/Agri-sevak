As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I advise on the integrated management of various rot types in Rajma (Kidney Bean) based on scientific verification and CIBRC approved practices for Haryana.

It is crucial to adopt an integrated pest management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods for effective and sustainable control.

Here's how to control the various rot types in Rajma:

### General Integrated Management Principles for Rots in Rajma:

1.  **Cultural Practices (Preventive):**
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Practice a 2-3 year rotation with non-host crops (e.g., cereals like wheat, maize) to reduce soil-borne inoculum.
    *   **Certified Seeds:** Always use healthy, certified, disease-free seeds from reputable sources.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris from the field to prevent pathogen carry-over.
    *   **Drainage:** Ensure excellent field drainage to prevent waterlogging, which favors many rot pathogens.
    *   **Soil Health:** Improve soil structure and organic matter content.
    *   **Sowing Depth & Spacing:** Maintain optimal sowing depth and plant spacing to ensure good air circulation and reduce humidity around the plant base.
    *   **Balanced Nutrition:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush growth susceptible to diseases.
    *   **Deep Ploughing:** Plough deeply after harvest to bury crop residues and expose pathogens to sunlight.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds with bio-control agents.
        *   **Trichoderma viride** @ 4 g/kg seed.
        *   **Pseudomonas fluorescens** @ 10 g/kg seed.
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply bio-control agents to the soil.
        *   **Trichoderma viride** @ 2.5 kg/acre mixed with 50 kg of farmyard manure (FYM) or compost, applied before sowing.

### Specific Rot Types and Control Measures:

#### 1. Root Rot, Stem Rot, Foot Rot, Collar Rot, Crown Rot, Neck Rot, Seed Rot, and Seedling Rot

These rot types often share common soil-borne fungal and oomycete pathogens such as *Rhizoctonia solani*, *Sclerotium rolfsii*, *Fusarium solani*, *Pythium spp.*, *Phytophthora spp.*, and *Macrophomina phaseolina* (causing charcoal rot, which can manifest as black stem/root rot). Neck rot is generally considered a form of collar or stem rot affecting the plant base.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural & Biological Practices:** Implement all general integrated management principles mentioned above.
*   **Chemical Seed Treatment (Crucial for prevention):**
    *   For broad-spectrum control against fungi:
        *   **Carbendazim** 12% + **Thiram** 63% WS @ 2.5 g/kg seed.
    *   For oomycete pathogens (*Pythium*, *Phytophthora*):
        *   **Metalaxyl-M** 31.8% ES @ 3.0 ml/kg seed.
    *   For a combination of fungi and oomycetes:
        *   **Fludioxonil** 2.5% + **Mefenoxam** 1% FS @ 2.5 ml/kg seed.

*   **Chemical Soil Drench / Foliar Spray (for established plants showing symptoms):**
    *   For general fungal rots (*Rhizoctonia*, *Fusarium*, *Sclerotium*):
        *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP @ 0.5 g/L water (as a soil drench around the base of affected plants).
        *   **Hexaconazole** 5% SC @ 1.0 ml/L water (as a foliar spray, especially for stem/collar rot symptoms).
    *   For oomycete rots (*Pythium*, *Phytophthora*):
        *   **Metalaxyl-M** 4% + **Mancozeb** 64% WP @ 2.5 g/L water (as a soil drench or foliar spray).
    *   For Charcoal Rot (*Macrophomina phaseolina*), which causes blackening of roots and stems:
        *   **Thiophanate Methyl** 70% WP @ 1.0 g/L water (as a soil drench).
        *   **Propiconazole** 25% EC @ 1.0 ml/L water (as a foliar spray).

#### 2. Black Rot

*   **Black Rot** caused by *Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris* (a bacterial disease primarily affecting cruciferous crops like cabbage, cauliflower) **is not known to affect Rajma.**
*   However, symptoms of blackening in roots or stems of Rajma can be caused by other fungal diseases like **Black Root Rot** (*Thielaviopsis basicola*) or **Charcoal Rot** (*Macrophomina phaseolina*), which are covered under the general root and stem rot management above.

#### 3. Fruit Rot (Pod Rot in Rajma)

While less common as a primary issue compared to root/stem rots, pods can be affected by diseases like White Mold (*Sclerotinia sclerotiorum*) or Grey Mold (*Botrytis cinerea*) under high humidity and specific conditions.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Ensure adequate plant spacing for good air circulation.
    *   Avoid overhead irrigation, especially during flowering and pod development.
    *   Remove and destroy infected pods and plant parts.
*   **Chemical Spray (if conditions favor disease development):**
    *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP @ 0.5 g/L water.
    *   **Thiophanate Methyl** 70% WP @ 1.0 g/L water.
    *   **Boscalid** 25.2% + **Pyraclostrobin** 12.8% WG @ 1.5 g/L water (for specific control of *Sclerotinia* and *Botrytis*).
