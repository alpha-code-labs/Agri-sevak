Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, I understand your concern regarding flower, fruit, and pod dropping in Rajma (Kidney Bean). This is a common physiological issue that can significantly reduce yield. It is not a specific disease or pest but rather a symptom of various stresses or imbalances.

Here's a comprehensive approach to control dropping in Rajma:

**I. Cultural and Agronomic Practices (Foundation for healthy growth)**

1.  **Optimal Sowing Time:** Ensure timely sowing as per recommended dates for Haryana to avoid extreme temperatures during flowering and pod development stages. Rajma is sensitive to high temperatures (>30°C) and low temperatures (<10°C) during these critical phases.
2.  **Proper Irrigation Management:**
    *   **Avoid Water Stress:** Both drought and waterlogging can cause severe dropping.
    *   **Critical Stages:** Provide light and timely irrigation at the pre-flowering, flowering, and pod development stages.
    *   **Method:** Use furrow irrigation or drip irrigation to ensure uniform moisture and avoid waterlogging.
3.  **Balanced Nutrient Management:**
    *   Conduct soil testing to determine nutrient deficiencies.
    *   Apply recommended doses of NPK. Excessive nitrogen can lead to lush vegetative growth at the expense of reproductive growth, potentially causing dropping.
4.  **Weed Control:** Keep the field free from weeds, especially during the initial growth stages, to reduce competition for water, nutrients, and sunlight.
5.  **Appropriate Plant Density:** Maintain optimal plant spacing to ensure adequate light penetration and air circulation, reducing competition among plants.
6.  **Pest and Disease Management:** While not direct causes of dropping, severe infestations of pests (e.g., pod borers, sucking pests) or diseases can weaken the plant, leading to stress and subsequent dropping. Implement timely control measures as needed.

**II. Nutritional Management (Addressing micronutrient deficiencies)**

Deficiencies of certain micronutrients, particularly Boron and Calcium, are often linked to flower and pod drop.

1.  **Boron Application:**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** If soil test indicates deficiency or symptoms appear, spray **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (e.g., Solubor) at 1-2 g/L of water (0.1-0.2% solution).
    *   **Timing:** Apply at pre-flowering and again at early pod development stages.
2.  **Calcium Application:**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Spray **Calcium Nitrate** at 5-10 g/L of water (0.5-1.0% solution).
    *   **Timing:** Apply during flowering and early pod development.

**III. Chemical Interventions (Plant Growth Regulators - PGRs)**

Plant Growth Regulators can help in reducing flower and pod drop by balancing hormonal levels within the plant.

1.  **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA):**
    *   **Technical Name:** **Naphthalene Acetic Acid** (often available as 4.5% SL formulation).
    *   **Dosage:** 20-40 ml of 4.5% SL formulation per 100 litres of water (this provides approximately 9-18 ppm NAA).
    *   **Timing:**
        *   First spray at the pre-flowering stage (when 10-20% flowers have appeared).
        *   Second spray 10-15 days after the first spray, during peak flowering/early pod formation.
    *   **Mechanism:** NAA is an auxin that helps in preventing the formation of the abscission layer, thereby reducing flower and pod shedding.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Integrated Approach:** The most effective control involves an integrated approach combining good cultural practices, balanced nutrition, and judicious use of PGRs.
*   **Diagnosis:** Before applying any chemical, try to identify the primary cause of dropping. If it's due to severe water stress or extreme temperatures, chemical sprays might have limited efficacy.
*   **Spray Coverage:** Ensure thorough coverage of the plant foliage for effective absorption of foliar sprays.
*   **Weather Conditions:** Spray during cool parts of the day (morning or late afternoon) and avoid spraying during strong winds or when rain is expected within a few hours.

By implementing these measures, you can significantly reduce flower and pod dropping in your Rajma crop and achieve better yields.
