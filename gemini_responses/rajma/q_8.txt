Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding sucking pests in Rajma. These pests, including Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips, can significantly reduce yield if not managed effectively.

Here's a comprehensive approach for their control in Rajma:

**1. Cultural Control Measures:**
*   **Timely Sowing:** Sow Rajma at the recommended time to avoid peak pest incidence periods.
*   **Weed Management:** Keep the field free of weeds, as many weeds act as alternate hosts for these pests.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation to break the pest cycle.
*   **Balanced Fertilization:** Avoid excessive use of nitrogenous fertilizers, which can lead to lush, succulent growth, making plants more attractive to sucking pests.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy crop residues after harvest to eliminate overwintering pest populations.
*   **Yellow Sticky Traps:** Install yellow sticky traps (10-12 traps per acre) to monitor and trap adult whiteflies and leafhoppers.

**2. Biological Control Measures:**
*   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Encourage the presence of natural enemies like ladybird beetles, lacewings, and syrphid fly larvae, which prey on aphids and other soft-bodied insects. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides unless absolutely necessary to protect these beneficial insects.
*   **Biopesticides:** In early stages of infestation, consider using neem-based formulations (e.g., Azadirachtin 1500 ppm or 3000 ppm) at a dose of 5 ml/L of water. These act as antifeedants and growth disruptors.

**3. Chemical Control Measures (When infestation crosses Economic Threshold Level):**
For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips, the following CIBRC approved insecticides can be used:

*   **For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips:**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** 0.5 - 1 ml per litre of water (or 100-125 ml per acre).
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** 0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water (or 50-100 g per acre).
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** 0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water (or 80-100 g per acre).
    *   **Dimethoate 30% EC:** 1.5 - 2 ml per litre of water (or 500-600 ml per acre).
    *   **Fipronil 5% SC:** 1.5 - 2 ml per litre of water (or 400-600 ml per acre), particularly effective against thrips and leafhoppers.

*   **Specifically for Whitefly nymphs and Leafhoppers:**
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** 1.25 - 1.5 ml per litre of water (or 500-600 ml per acre). This is an insect growth regulator, effective on nymphal stages.

**Important Considerations for Chemical Application:**
*   Always read the label carefully before use and follow the manufacturer's instructions regarding dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Ensure thorough coverage of the plant, especially the undersides of leaves where many sucking pests reside.
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.
*   Observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) mentioned on the label to ensure the safety of the produce.

**Regarding Psylla:**
This is not known to affect Rajma. Psylla species are primarily pests of fruit trees like citrus, mango, or pear, and are not a significant pest of Rajma (common bean) in Haryana.
