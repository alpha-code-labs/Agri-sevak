Mites, including Red Spider Mite (*Tetranychus urticae*) and various Rust Mites, are significant pests of Rajma (Kidney Bean) and can cause considerable yield losses if not managed effectively. They thrive in hot, dry conditions.

**Symptoms of Mite Infestation:**
*   **Red Spider Mite:** Fine webbing on the underside of leaves, yellowing or bronzing of leaves, stippling (tiny white or yellow spots), and premature leaf drop. Mites are tiny and can be seen with a hand lens.
*   **Rust Mite:** Leaves may appear rusty, bronzed, or leathery. They are microscopic and cause distortion or curling of leaves.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Mites in Rajma:**

A comprehensive approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods is recommended for effective and sustainable mite control.

**1. Cultural Control:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy crop residues after harvest to reduce overwintering mite populations.
*   **Weed Management:** Control weeds in and around the field, as many weeds can serve as alternate hosts for mites.
*   **Proper Irrigation:** Maintain adequate soil moisture, especially during dry periods. Mites prefer dry, dusty conditions. Overhead irrigation can help dislodge mites and increase humidity, which is unfavorable for them.
*   **Balanced Fertilization:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush, succulent growth that is more attractive to mites.

**2. Biological Control:**
*   **Natural Predators:** Encourage natural enemies such as predatory mites (e.g., *Amblyseius* species), ladybird beetles, and lacewings. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that can harm these beneficial insects.

**3. Chemical Control (Acaricides):**
When mite populations reach economic threshold levels, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the underside of leaves where mites primarily reside. Rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

**Recommended CIBRC Approved Acaricides for Rajma:**

*   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** 125 ml per acre (or 0.5 ml per liter of water).
*   **Propargite 57% EC:** 500 ml per acre (or 2 ml per liter of water).
*   **Fenpyroximate 5% SC:** 300-400 ml per acre (or 1.2-1.6 ml per liter of water).
*   **Abamectin 1.9% EC:** 150-200 ml per acre (or 0.6-0.8 ml per liter of water).
*   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP:** 1.5-2 kg per acre (or 6-8 g per liter of water). (Effective against rust mites and as a preventive for spider mites, especially in cooler weather).
*   **Hexythiazox 5.45% EC:** 250-300 ml per acre (or 1-1.2 ml per liter of water). (Primarily ovicidal and larvicidal, effective against eggs and nymphs).
*   **Etoxazole 10% SC:** 100-125 ml per acre (or 0.4-0.5 ml per liter of water). (Also primarily ovicidal and larvicidal).

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Spray Volume:** Ensure sufficient water volume (typically 200-250 liters per acre) for thorough coverage.
*   **Resistance Management:** Never use the same acaricide repeatedly. Rotate chemicals with different modes of action to delay resistance development.
*   **Safety Precautions:** Always read and follow the instructions on the product label, including dosage, application method, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and personal protective equipment (PPE).
*   **Monitoring:** Regularly scout your fields to detect mite infestations early and apply control measures promptly.
