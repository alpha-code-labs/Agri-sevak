As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the maturity signs, harvesting time, and cutting process for Rajma in Haryana.

### Maturity Signs for Rajma

The following indicators signal that Rajma is ready for harvest:

*   **Pod Colour Change:** The most prominent sign is the change in pod colour from green to a characteristic yellow, straw, or light brown colour, depending on the variety.
*   **Leaf Senescence:** The leaves of the plant will start to turn yellow, dry up, and eventually drop off.
*   **Plant Drying:** The entire plant will begin to dry down, losing its green colour and becoming brittle.
*   **Seed Hardness and Colour:** When you open a pod, the seeds inside should be firm, hard, and have attained their characteristic colour (e.g., red, white, mottled) and full size. They should not be soft or milky.
*   **Moisture Content:** The ideal seed moisture content for harvesting is typically between 15-20%. Further drying is required for safe storage.

### Harvesting Time for Rajma

*   **Optimal Window:** Harvesting should commence when 80-90% of the pods on the plants have matured and dried down, and the plants have largely senesced.
*   **Timing:** Harvesting too early can result in immature, shrivelled seeds with lower yield and poor quality. Harvesting too late can lead to pod shattering, especially in dry conditions, resulting in significant seed loss.
*   **Typical Duration:** Depending on the variety and local climatic conditions, Rajma typically matures and is ready for harvest between 90 to 120 days after sowing.

### Cutting Process for Rajma

The cutting process can be done manually or mechanically, depending on the scale of cultivation and available resources.

*   **Manual Harvesting:**
    *   **Cutting:** Plants are cut close to the ground level using sickles. This is usually done in the morning to minimize pod shattering, as the plants are slightly turgid from dew.
    *   **Bundling and Drying:** The cut plants are then gathered into small bundles and left in the field for 3-7 days to sun-dry completely. This ensures uniform drying of pods and seeds.
    *   **Threshing:** Once the plants are thoroughly dry and brittle, they are threshed to separate the seeds. This can be done by beating the bundles with sticks, trampling by bullocks, or using small-scale stationary threshers.
    *   **Cleaning:** After threshing, the seeds are winnowed to remove chaff and other debris.

*   **Mechanical Harvesting:**
    *   **Combine Harvester:** For large-scale cultivation, combine harvesters can be used. It is crucial to adjust the combine settings (cylinder speed, concave clearance, fan speed) specifically for Rajma to minimize seed damage and loss.
    *   **Windrowing:** In some cases, plants are cut and laid in windrows to dry for a few days before a pick-up combine harvester is used to thresh them. This method can be beneficial if the crop maturity is uneven or if there's a risk of shattering.
    *   **Moisture Content:** For direct combining, the seed moisture content should ideally be around 15-18% to prevent excessive damage.

After threshing and cleaning, the seeds should be further dried to a safe moisture content (typically below 10-12%) before storage to prevent pest infestation and fungal growth.
