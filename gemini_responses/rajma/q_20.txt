As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified strategies to address micronutrient deficiencies in Rajma (Kidney Bean) in Haryana.

**General Recommendations:**

1.  **Soil Testing is Crucial:** Always conduct a comprehensive soil test before applying any micronutrients. This helps in identifying specific deficiencies and their severity, preventing unnecessary applications and potential toxicities.
2.  **Foliar Application for Quick Correction:** For standing crops showing deficiency symptoms, foliar sprays are generally more effective for rapid correction as nutrients are absorbed directly by the leaves.
3.  **Timing of Application:** Apply foliar sprays during the early morning or late evening hours to minimize evaporation and maximize absorption.
4.  **Water Volume:** For foliar sprays, use 200-250 litres of water per acre to ensure proper coverage.

Here's how to address specific micronutrient deficiencies in Rajma:

### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

*   **Deficiency Symptoms:** Stunted growth, small and narrow leaves (little leaf), interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, bronzing of older leaves.
*   **Recommended Action:**
    *   **Soil Application (Preventive):** If soil test indicates low zinc, apply **Zinc sulphate monohydrate** (33% Zn) @ 10-12 kg/acre or **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (21% Zn) @ 20-25 kg/acre at the time of sowing.
    *   **Foliar Application (Curative):** For standing crops, spray 0.5% solution of **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (21% Zn) (5 g/L of water). For better absorption and to neutralize acidity, add 0.25% unslaked lime (2.5 g/L of water). Alternatively, use **Zinc EDTA** (12% Zn) @ 0.5-1 g/L of water. Apply 2-3 sprays at 15-day intervals, starting 30-40 days after sowing or upon symptom appearance.

### 2. Iron (Fe) / Ferrous Deficiency

*   **Deficiency Symptoms:** Prominent interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, with veins remaining distinctly green. In severe cases, entire leaves turn yellow or white.
*   **Recommended Action:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Iron deficiency is best corrected through foliar sprays, especially in alkaline soils where soil-applied iron gets quickly fixed. Spray 0.5-1% solution of **Ferrous sulphate** (19% Fe) (5-10 g/L of water) with 0.25% unslaked lime (2.5 g/L of water). Alternatively, use **Ferrous EDTA** (12% Fe) @ 0.5-1 g/L of water. Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, starting when symptoms appear.

### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

*   **Deficiency Symptoms:** Stunted growth, death of growing points (terminal buds), poor flower and pod set, hollow stems, cracked stems or pods, malformed leaves.
*   **Recommended Action:**
    *   **Soil Application (Preventive):** In severely deficient soils, apply **Sodium tetraborate decahydrate** (Borax, 10.5% B) @ 2-4 kg/acre at sowing. Exercise caution as boron has a narrow range between deficiency and toxicity.
    *   **Foliar Application (Curative):** Spray 0.1-0.2% solution of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (20% B) (1-2 g/L of water) or 0.2-0.3% solution of **Sodium tetraborate decahydrate** (Borax, 10.5% B) (2-3 g/L of water). Apply 1-2 sprays, one at the pre-flowering stage and another at the pod development stage.

### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

*   **Deficiency Symptoms:** Young leaves are distorted, stunted, or show marginal necrosis (browning of leaf edges). Growing points may die back, and root development is poor.
*   **Recommended Action:**
    *   **Soil Application (Preventive):** For general calcium improvement, especially in acidic or sodic soils, apply Gypsum (Calcium sulphate) @ 200-400 kg/acre. For direct calcium supply, apply **Calcium nitrate** @ 10-15 kg/acre at sowing.
    *   **Foliar Application (Curative):** Spray 0.5-1% solution of **Calcium nitrate** (19% Ca) (5-10 g/L of water) or 0.5% solution of **Calcium chloride** (27% Ca) (5 g/L of water). Apply 1-2 sprays during the vegetative growth and pod development stages.

### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

*   **Deficiency Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on older leaves, with veins remaining green. In severe cases, leaves may develop a reddish or purplish tint and eventually become necrotic.
*   **Recommended Action:**
    *   **Soil Application (Preventive):** If soil test indicates low magnesium, apply **Magnesium sulphate** (9.6% Mg) @ 10-20 kg/acre at the time of sowing.
    *   **Foliar Application (Curative):** Spray 1-2% solution of **Magnesium sulphate** (9.6% Mg) (10-20 g/L of water). Apply 1-2 sprays at 15-day intervals, starting when symptoms appear.

### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

*   **Deficiency Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, often with small necrotic (dead) spots. Symptoms can be similar to iron deficiency but often appear more mottled or speckled.
*   **Recommended Action:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Manganese deficiency is best addressed through foliar sprays, particularly in alkaline soils. Spray 0.5-1% solution of **Manganese sulphate** (28-30% Mn) (5-10 g/L of water) with 0.25% unslaked lime (2.5 g/L of water). Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, starting 30-40 days after sowing or upon symptom appearance.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Compatibility:** Avoid mixing multiple micronutrients or micronutrient solutions with other pesticides without checking their compatibility.
*   **Soil pH:** The availability of micronutrients is highly influenced by soil pH. Haryana soils are often alkaline, which can reduce the availability of iron, zinc, and manganese.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management:** Micronutrient application should be part of an integrated nutrient management plan, considering macronutrients (N, P, K) and organic matter.

Always consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions.
