As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend the following doses for organic manures and bio-stimulants for Rajma cultivation in Haryana:

*   **Farmyard Manure (FYM):**
    *   Apply **10-15 tonnes per acre** during land preparation, at least 2-3 weeks before sowing. Ensure the FYM is well-decomposed to prevent nutrient immobilization and pest issues. Incorporate it thoroughly into the soil.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   Apply **2-4 tonnes per acre** during land preparation, or as a top dressing before flowering. Vermicompost can also be used for seed treatment by mixing 100 g of vermicompost with 1 kg of seeds to enhance germination and early vigor.

*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract based Bio-stimulant):**
    *   **Sagarika** is a seaweed extract-based bio-stimulant, not a bulk organic manure like FYM or vermicompost. It is primarily used to enhance nutrient uptake, promote root development, improve plant vigor, and increase yield.
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   Mix **250-500 ml of Sagarika** per acre in 150-200 litres of water.
        *   Apply the first spray at the vegetative growth stage (25-30 days after sowing).
        *   Apply the second spray at the pre-flowering stage (45-50 days after sowing).
    *   **Soil Application (Drench/Drip):**
        *   For soil application, mix **1-2 litres of Sagarika** per acre with irrigation water or apply through drip irrigation at critical growth stages.
