As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm the following regarding your query:

*   **Fruit fly:** This is not known to affect Rajma. Fruit flies primarily infest fleshy fruits like mango, guava, cucurbits, tomato, etc. Rajma is a legume, and its primary pests are pod borers (e.g., *Helicoverpa armigera*, *Maruca vitrata*) and sucking pests.
*   **Ber fly (*Carpomyia vesuviana*):** This is not known to affect Rajma. The Ber fly is a highly specific pest of Ber (*Ziziphus mauritiana*) fruits.
