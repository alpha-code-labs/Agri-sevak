As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified irrigation management practices for Rajma (Kidney Bean) cultivation in Haryana:

Rajma is sensitive to both water stress and waterlogging, particularly during critical growth stages. Efficient irrigation management is crucial for maximizing yield under Haryana's agro-climatic conditions.

### Irrigation Management for Rajma

#### 1. First Irrigation

*   **Timing:** The first irrigation is critical for establishing a healthy crop. It should generally be applied around **25-30 days after sowing (DAS)**.
    *   This period coincides with the early vegetative growth and branching stage, which is vital for developing a strong plant structure.
    *   If the soil has sufficient moisture at sowing (e.g., due to pre-sowing irrigation or recent rainfall), the first irrigation might be delayed slightly.
    *   Avoid very early irrigation (before 20 DAS), especially if temperatures are low, as it can hinder root development and increase the risk of chilling injury.

#### 2. Second and Subsequent Irrigations

*   **Critical Stages:** Rajma has high water requirements during specific growth phases:
    *   **Branching/Vegetative Growth:** (approx. 25-40 DAS)
    *   **Flowering:** (approx. 45-60 DAS) - Water stress during this stage can lead to significant flower drop and yield reduction.
    *   **Pod Development and Grain Filling:** (approx. 60-80 DAS) - Adequate moisture is essential for proper pod formation and seed development.
*   **Frequency:** Subsequent irrigations should be provided at intervals of **15-20 days**, depending on the soil type, prevailing weather conditions (temperature, humidity, wind speed), and the crop's growth stage.
    *   Lighter, more frequent irrigations are generally more beneficial than heavy, infrequent ones, especially on lighter soils.
    *   A total of **3-4 irrigations** (in addition to the first irrigation) are typically required for a successful Rajma crop in Haryana.
*   **Water Quantity:** Each irrigation should aim to replenish the soil moisture in the root zone without causing waterlogging. Typically, **50-60 mm (5-6 cm)** of water per irrigation is sufficient, depending on the soil's water holding capacity.
*   **Avoid Waterlogging:** Rajma is highly susceptible to root rot under waterlogged conditions. Ensure proper field drainage to prevent standing water.

#### 3. Sprinkler Use

*   **Efficiency:** Sprinkler irrigation is highly recommended for Rajma cultivation in Haryana due to its superior water use efficiency compared to traditional flood irrigation. It ensures uniform water distribution and minimizes losses from deep percolation and runoff.
*   **Advantages:**
    *   **Water Saving:** Can save **25-40%** of water compared to flood irrigation, which is crucial in water-scarce regions.
    *   **Uniform Application:** Provides even distribution of water across the field, leading to uniform crop growth and better yields.
    *   **Reduced Disease Incidence:** By avoiding prolonged saturation of the soil surface, it can help reduce the incidence of some soil-borne diseases. However, irrigating during the morning allows foliage to dry quickly, minimizing the risk of foliar diseases.
    *   **Suitable for Undulating Terrain:** Can be effectively used on uneven land where flood irrigation is challenging.
    *   **Fertigation:** Sprinkler systems can be integrated with fertigation, allowing for precise application of water-soluble fertilizers directly to the root zone, thereby improving nutrient use efficiency.
*   **Application Rate:** When using sprinklers, apply water at a rate that the soil can absorb without causing runoff. This rate varies with soil type (e.g., sandy soils have higher infiltration rates than clayey soils).
*   **Timing:** It is advisable to operate sprinklers during the cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize evaporative losses.
