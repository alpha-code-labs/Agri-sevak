As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Dieback, Twig Blight, and Tikka disease in Rajma in Haryana.

### Dieback and Twig Blight in Rajma

Dieback and Twig Blight are often caused by various fungal pathogens (e.g., *Colletotrichum*, *Phomopsis*, *Botrytis*) or can be exacerbated by environmental stress. They manifest as the progressive death of shoots or twigs, starting from the tip or a specific point.

**1. Cultural and Agronomic Practices:**

*   **Sanitation:** Regularly inspect plants and promptly remove and destroy all infected plant parts (twigs, branches, leaves) to reduce the inoculum source.
*   **Pruning:** Prune affected branches well below the visible symptoms into healthy wood, using sterilized pruning tools.
*   **Plant Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to improve air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce humidity and fungal growth.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Provide balanced nutrition to enhance plant vigor and resistance to diseases. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can lead to lush, susceptible growth.
*   **Water Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day, to minimize leaf wetness periods. Irrigate at the base of the plants.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available and suitable for local conditions, consider planting disease-tolerant Rajma varieties.

**2. Chemical Control (Fungicides):**

In cases of severe infection or as a preventive measure during conducive weather conditions, the following CIBRC approved fungicides can be used:

*   **Carbendazim 50% WP:** Apply at a concentration of 0.5-1.0 g/L of water.
*   **Mancozeb 75% WP:** Apply at a concentration of 2.0-2.5 g/L of water.
*   **Azoxystrobin 25% SC:** Apply at a concentration of 0.5 ml/L of water.
*   **Thiophanate Methyl 70% WP:** Apply at a concentration of 0.5-1.0 g/L of water.

**Application Guidelines:**

*   Initiate spraying at the first sign of disease symptoms or when weather conditions are favorable for disease development.
*   Repeat applications at 10-15 day intervals, depending on disease severity and weather conditions.
*   Always ensure thorough coverage of the plant foliage and stems.
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
*   Always refer to the product label for specific dosage, application instructions, and safety precautions.

### Tikka Disease in Rajma

This is not known to affect Rajma. Tikka disease is primarily a foliar disease of groundnut (peanut) caused by *Cercospora arachidicola* and *Cercosporidium personatum*.
