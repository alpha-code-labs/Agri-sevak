Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm that Scale insects and Mealybugs are significant sap-sucking pests that can affect Rajma (Kidney Bean) cultivation in Haryana. Effective management requires an integrated approach.

### Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Approach for Scale Insects and Mealybugs in Rajma:

1.  **Regular Field Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your Rajma plants, especially the undersides of leaves, stems, and growing points, for early signs of these pests. Early detection is crucial for effective control.
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Removal of Infested Parts:** Manually remove and destroy heavily infested plant parts or entire plants to reduce pest populations.
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the field free of weeds, as many weeds can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
    *   **Avoid Excessive Nitrogen:** High nitrogen fertilization can lead to lush, soft growth that is more attractive to sap-sucking pests. Maintain balanced nutrient application.
3.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Conserve and encourage natural enemies such as ladybird beetles, lacewings, and parasitic wasps, which prey on or parasitize scale insects and mealybugs. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

### Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved Technical Chemicals):

For effective chemical control, especially against pests like scale insects and mealybugs that are often protected by a waxy covering, systemic insecticides are generally preferred as they are absorbed by the plant and move within its tissues, reaching the pests as they feed.

Apply insecticides at the first sign of infestation, targeting the early nymphal stages for best results.

*   **Option 1 (Neonicotinoids - Systemic):**
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: Apply at 125 ml per acre (or 0.5 ml per litre of water for spot application).
    *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: Apply at 50 g per acre (or 0.2 g per litre of water for spot application).
    *   *These are effective against a broad range of sucking pests. Rotate with other modes of action to prevent resistance.*

*   **Option 2 (Insect Growth Regulator / Lipid Biosynthesis Inhibitor - Systemic):**
    *   **Buprofezin** 25% SC: Apply at 500 ml per acre (or 2 ml per litre of water). This is particularly effective against nymphal stages by disrupting their molting process and has a lower impact on beneficial insects.
    *   **Spirotetramat** 150 OD: Apply at 200-250 ml per acre (or 0.8-1.0 ml per litre of water). This insecticide offers excellent systemic movement (both xylem and phloem) and is highly effective against scales and mealybugs.

*   **Option 3 (Organophosphate - Systemic/Contact, for severe infestations or resistance management):**
    *   **Dimethoate** 30% EC: Apply at 330 ml per acre (or 1.3 ml per litre of water). *Use with caution due to its broader spectrum activity, which can affect beneficial insects.*

### General Recommendations for Application:

*   **Water Volume:** Use sufficient water (e.g., 200-250 litres per acre) to ensure thorough coverage, especially for contact action and to allow systemic products to be well distributed.
*   **Timing:** Apply insecticides at the first sign of infestation, targeting early nymphal stages for best results, as they are less protected by wax.
*   **Resistance Management:** To prevent the development of insecticide resistance, it is crucial to rotate insecticides with different modes of action. Do not use the same chemical repeatedly.
*   **Safety:** Always read and strictly follow the instructions and precautions mentioned on the product label. Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, mask, and protective clothing during handling and application of any chemical. Avoid spraying during flowering to protect pollinators.
