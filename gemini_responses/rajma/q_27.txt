As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the suitable climate, soil type, and drainage requirements for Rajma (Kidney Bean) cultivation in Haryana:

**Climate:**
*   Rajma is a cool-season crop and thrives in temperate conditions.
*   **Optimal Temperature:** The ideal temperature range for vigorous growth and good pod development is between **15°C to 25°C**.
*   **Temperature Sensitivity:** It is highly sensitive to frost, especially during flowering and pod formation stages, which can severely reduce yield. High temperatures above 30°C, particularly during flowering, can lead to flower drop and poor pod setting.
*   **Growing Season:** Requires a relatively long growing season free from extreme heat or cold. In Haryana, it is typically cultivated in areas or seasons that provide these moderate temperatures.

**Soil Type:**
*   Rajma prefers well-drained, fertile, and light to medium-textured soils.
*   **Ideal Soil:** **Loamy to sandy-loam soils** are considered most suitable.
*   **Soil pH:** An optimal soil pH range of **6.0 to 7.5** (slightly acidic to neutral) is preferred for nutrient availability and root development.
*   **Organic Matter:** Soils rich in organic matter promote better growth and yield.
*   **Avoid:** Heavy clay soils should be avoided as they tend to retain too much moisture, leading to waterlogging.

**Drainage Requirement:**
*   **Crucial:** Excellent drainage is paramount for Rajma cultivation. The crop is highly sensitive to waterlogging.
*   **Waterlogging Impact:** Stagnant water, even for short periods, can cause root rot, nutrient deficiency, and significantly impair plant growth and yield.
*   **Soil Structure:** The soil must have good internal drainage to allow excess water to percolate away quickly.
*   **Field Preparation:** Proper field preparation, including leveling and potentially the use of raised beds or furrows, can help manage surface drainage, especially in areas prone to heavy rainfall or where irrigation is frequent.
