As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I emphasize that addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies in Rajma (Kidney Bean) effectively requires a scientific approach, starting with a comprehensive soil test. This test will accurately determine the existing nutrient levels in your field and guide precise fertilizer application, preventing both deficiencies and wasteful over-application.

**General Recommendations for Rajma:**

1.  **Soil Testing:** Before planting, always conduct a soil test. This is the most crucial step to determine the exact nutrient status and recommended fertilizer doses for your specific field. HAU provides soil testing services.
2.  **Integrated Nutrient Management (INM):** Combine chemical fertilizers with organic manures (Farm Yard Manure, compost) and bio-fertilizers (Rhizobium inoculants for Rajma) to improve soil health and nutrient availability.
3.  **Basal Application:** Most macro-nutrients are best applied as a basal dose at the time of sowing, incorporated into the soil.
4.  **Foliar Application:** For quick correction of visible deficiency symptoms during the crop growth stage, foliar sprays can be effective.

### Addressing Nitrogen (N) Deficiency in Rajma

Rajma is a legume and can fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic Rhizobium bacteria in its root nodules. Therefore, excessive nitrogen application can inhibit nodulation and natural nitrogen fixation. A starter dose of nitrogen is generally recommended to support early plant growth before nodulation is fully established.

*   **Symptoms:** General yellowing of older leaves, stunted growth, reduced leaf size, and poor vigor.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Basal Application (at sowing):** Apply a starter dose of nitrogen.
        *   **Urea:** 45-65 kg/acre (providing 20-30 kg N/acre).
        *   Alternatively, if applying Phosphorus through DAP, adjust Urea quantity accordingly.
    *   **Foliar Application (for quick correction if symptoms appear after establishment):**
        *   Spray 2% solution of **Urea** (20 g of **Urea** per liter of water). Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, preferably in the morning or evening. Ensure good coverage of the foliage.

### Addressing Phosphorus (P) Deficiency in Rajma

Phosphorus is vital for root development, flowering, pod formation, and energy transfer within the plant.

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, dark green or purplish discoloration of older leaves, delayed maturity, poor root development, and reduced pod set.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Basal Application (at sowing):** Phosphorus is best applied as a basal dose and incorporated into the soil, as it is relatively immobile in the soil.
        *   **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP):** 85-130 kg/acre (providing 40-60 kg P2O5/acre and 15-23 kg N/acre).
        *   Alternatively, **Single Superphosphate (SSP):** 250-375 kg/acre (providing 40-60 kg P2O5/acre).
    *   **Foliar Application (for quick correction):**
        *   Spray 0.5-1% solution of **Monoammonium Phosphate (MAP)** (5-10 g of **Monoammonium Phosphate** per liter of water). Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals.

### Addressing Potassium (K) Deficiency in Rajma

Potassium plays a crucial role in water regulation, nutrient transport, enzyme activation, disease resistance, and overall crop quality.

*   **Symptoms:** Yellowing and scorching (browning) of leaf margins, especially on older leaves. Leaves may appear crinkled or curled. Weak stems, poor pod filling, and increased susceptibility to diseases.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Basal Application (at sowing):**
        *   **Muriate of Potash (Potassium Chloride):** 35-50 kg/acre (providing 20-30 kg K2O/acre).
    *   **Foliar Application (for quick correction):**
        *   Spray 1% solution of **Potassium Sulphate** (10 g of **Potassium Sulphate** per liter of water). Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals.

**Important Note:** Always ensure proper soil moisture when applying fertilizers, especially granular forms, to facilitate nutrient uptake by the plants. Over-application of any nutrient can be detrimental to the crop and the environment. Always refer to your specific soil test report for precise recommendations.
