As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I must clarify that **transplantation is generally not recommended for Rajma (Kidney Bean)**.

Rajma, like most legumes, develops a sensitive taproot system. Transplanting can cause significant root damage and transplant shock, leading to poor establishment, stunted growth, and ultimately, reduced yields. Therefore, **direct sowing is the ideal and recommended method** for Rajma cultivation in Haryana.

Below are the ideal direct sowing time, distance, and process for Rajma:

### Ideal Direct Sowing Time for Rajma in Haryana
*   **Rabi Season:** The optimal sowing period for Rajma in Haryana is from **mid-October to mid-November**. Early sowing in October is preferred for better yields.

### Ideal Direct Sowing Distance for Rajma in Haryana
*   **Row-to-Row Spacing:** Maintain a distance of **30-45 cm** between rows.
*   **Plant-to-Plant Spacing:** Maintain a distance of **10-15 cm** between plants within a row.

### Ideal Direct Sowing Process for Rajma in Haryana
1.  **Land Preparation:**
    *   Prepare a well-pulverized and fine seedbed by ploughing the field 2-3 times, followed by planking. This ensures good seed-to-soil contact and uniform germination.
2.  **Seed Rate:**
    *   Use a seed rate of **80-100 kg/acre** for bold-seeded varieties.
3.  **Seed Treatment:**
    *   Treat the seeds before sowing to protect against seed-borne diseases and early pest attacks.
        *   For fungal diseases, treat seeds with **Carbendazim** at 1 g/kg seed + **Thiram** at 2 g/kg seed.
        *   For protection against sucking pests in the early stages, treat seeds with **Imidacloprid** at 5-7 ml/kg seed.
4.  **Fertilizer Application (Basal Dose):**
    *   Apply a basal dose of fertilizers at the time of sowing. A general recommendation for Rajma is 20 kg Nitrogen, 60 kg Phosphorus, and 20 kg Potassium per acre.
5.  **Sowing Depth:**
    *   Sow the seeds at a depth of **5-7 cm**. Deeper sowing can delay emergence, while shallower sowing can lead to poor germination due to moisture stress.
6.  **Sowing Method:**
    *   Sow seeds using a seed drill or by dibbling at the recommended spacing. Ensure uniform distribution of seeds.
7.  **Initial Irrigation:**
    *   Apply a light irrigation immediately after sowing if the soil moisture is insufficient for germination. Subsequent irrigations should be given as per crop requirement and weather conditions.
