As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following fertilizer doses for Rajma (Kidney Bean) cultivation in Haryana. Please note that these are general recommendations, and a soil test is always advisable for precise nutrient management tailored to your specific field conditions.

**General Fertilizer Recommendation for Rajma:**

Rajma is a pulse crop, but it is often considered a poor nitrogen fixer compared to other legumes, especially in its early growth stages. Therefore, a good starter dose of nitrogen is crucial, along with adequate phosphorus, potassium, and sulphur.

**1. Conventional Fertilizers (Basal Application at Sowing):**

The recommended nutrient dose for Rajma is typically **20-30 kg Nitrogen (N), 40-60 kg Phosphorus (P2O5), 20-30 kg Potassium (K2O), and 10-20 kg Sulphur (S) per acre.**

Based on these recommendations, here are the approximate quantities of common fertilizers:

*   **DAP (Di-Ammonium Phosphate):**
    *   Apply **100-110 kg DAP per acre** at the time of sowing.
    *   *(This provides approximately 18-20 kg Nitrogen and 46-50 kg Phosphorus (P2O5) per acre).*

*   **Urea:**
    *   After applying DAP, an additional **10-15 kg Urea per acre** should be applied at sowing.
    *   *(This makes up the remaining Nitrogen requirement. A portion of this Urea can be top-dressed at 25-30 days after sowing if needed, depending on crop vigour and soil test results).*

*   **Muriate of Potash (MOP):**
    *   Apply **40-50 kg Muriate of Potash per acre** at the time of sowing.
    *   *(This provides approximately 24-30 kg Potassium (K2O) per acre).*

*   **Sulphur (Elemental Sulphur 90%):**
    *   Apply **15-20 kg Elemental Sulphur (90%) per acre** at the time of sowing.
    *   *(Sulphur is crucial for pulse crops for better protein synthesis and yield).*

**Alternative for Phosphorus and Sulphur:**

*   **Single Super Phosphate (SSP):**
    *   If **DAP** is not used, you can apply **300-350 kg Single Super Phosphate (SSP) per acre** at sowing.
    *   *(This provides approximately 48-56 kg Phosphorus (P2O5) and 33-38 kg Sulphur per acre, covering both P and S requirements).*
    *   In this case, the entire Nitrogen requirement (20-30 kg N) would come from **Urea**, meaning **45-65 kg Urea per acre** would be needed, applied at sowing and potentially split for top-dressing.

**2. NPK Complex Fertilizers:**

*   **NPK (e.g., 12:32:16, 10:26:26, 19:19:19):**
    *   The dose of NPK complex fertilizers will depend on the specific grade available and the nutrient balance required. For example, to meet the phosphorus requirement of 40-60 kg P2O5/acre using **NPK (12:32:16)**, you would need approximately **125-185 kg NPK (12:32:16) per acre**.
    *   You would then need to adjust the remaining Nitrogen and Potassium requirements using **Urea** and **Muriate of Potash** accordingly. It is generally more precise to use individual fertilizers or a combination that closely matches the recommended nutrient ratios.

**3. Nano-Urea and Nano-DAP (Foliar Application):**

These are advanced nutrient delivery systems for foliar application, designed to supplement conventional fertilizers and improve nutrient use efficiency. They are not meant to entirely replace basal fertilizer applications.

*   **Nano-Urea (Liquid):**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml of **Nano-Urea** per litre of water.
    *   **Application:** Prepare a solution and spray uniformly on the foliage.
    *   **Timing:** Typically, 2-3 foliar sprays are recommended:
        1.  First spray at the branching/vegetative growth stage (around 25-30 days after sowing).
        2.  Second spray at the pre-flowering stage.
        3.  (Optional) Third spray at pod development stage, if needed.

*   **Nano-DAP (Liquid):**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml of **Nano-DAP** per litre of water.
    *   **Application:** Prepare a solution and spray uniformly on the foliage.
    *   **Timing:** Typically, 2 foliar sprays are recommended:
        1.  First spray at the pre-flowering stage.
        2.  Second spray at the pod development stage.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Soil Testing:** Always conduct a soil test to determine the exact nutrient status of your field. This will allow for precise fertilizer recommendations, preventing over- or under-application of nutrients.
*   **Application Method:** Basal fertilizers (DAP, Urea, MOP, Sulphur, SSP) should be broadcast and incorporated into the soil or applied in furrows at the time of sowing. Nano fertilizers are for foliar application.
*   **Watering:** Ensure adequate soil moisture after basal fertilizer application for proper nutrient uptake.

By following these recommendations, you can ensure optimal nutrient availability for healthy Rajma growth and maximize yield potential.
