As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified seed and soil treatment processes for Aonla (Indian Gooseberry) in Haryana:

### Recommended Seed Treatment Process for Aonla

Seed treatment is crucial for protecting young Aonla seedlings from seed-borne and early soil-borne fungal diseases like damping-off and root rot, especially during the nursery stage.

*   **Chemical Treatment:** Treat seeds with a fungicide before sowing.
    *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP @ 2 grams per kilogram of seeds.
    *   OR **Thiram** 75% WS @ 2.5 grams per kilogram of seeds.
*   **Biological Treatment:** For enhanced protection and promotion of root health, apply a bio-fungicide.
    *   **Trichoderma viride** (or *Trichoderma harzianum*) @ 5-10 grams per kilogram of seeds.
    *   *Note:* If using both chemical and biological treatments, apply the chemical fungicide first, allow the seeds to dry completely, and then apply the biological agent.

### Recommended Soil Treatment Process for Aonla

Soil treatment aims to improve soil health, manage soil-borne pests and diseases, and provide a conducive environment for Aonla growth.

**A. Pre-planting (Nursery beds or Orchard planting pits):**

*   **Organic Matter Enrichment:**
    *   Incorporate 10-15 kg of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost per planting pit (for orchard) or 10-15 tonnes per acre (for nursery beds) during land preparation. This improves soil structure, water retention, and microbial activity.
*   **Management of Soil-borne Diseases:**
    *   Apply **Trichoderma viride** (or *Trichoderma harzianum*) @ 2.5 kg per acre, mixed with 50 kg of FYM/compost, and broadcast evenly into the soil 15-20 days before planting. For individual pits, apply 50-100 grams per pit mixed with FYM.
*   **Termite Control (if prevalent):**
    *   Drench the planting pits or nursery beds with **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC @ 2.5 ml per litre of water (approx. 5-10 litres of solution per pit).
*   **Nematode Management (if severe infestation is confirmed):**
    *   Apply **Purpureocillium lilacinum** (a bio-nematicide) @ 2.5 kg per acre, mixed with 50 kg of FYM/compost, and incorporate into the soil. For individual pits, apply 50-100 grams per pit mixed with FYM.

**B. Post-planting (For established plants, as a preventive or curative measure for specific issues):**

*   **Root Rot / Collar Rot:**
    *   Drench the soil around the base of the affected plants with **Carbendazim** 50% WP @ 2 grams per litre of water.
    *   OR **Copper Oxychloride** 50% WP @ 3 grams per litre of water.
    *   Continue regular application of **Trichoderma viride** enriched FYM around the root zone.
*   **White Grubs:**
    *   Apply **Fipronil** 0.3% G @ 30 kg per acre (broadcast and incorporate into the soil) or 50-100 grams per plant around the root zone, followed by light irrigation.
