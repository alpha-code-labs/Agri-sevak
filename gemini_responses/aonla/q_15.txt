As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for managing the mentioned conditions in Aonla (Indian Gooseberry) in Haryana:

### Grasshopper

Grasshoppers can occasionally cause damage to Aonla foliage, especially on young plants or during outbreaks.

**Control Measures:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Maintain field sanitation by removing weeds and debris that can serve as breeding grounds.
    *   Deep ploughing during off-season can expose grasshopper eggs to predators and harsh weather, reducing their population.
2.  **Chemical Control (if infestation is severe):**
    *   **Malathion 50% EC**: 1.0 - 1.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Quinalphos 25% EC**: 2.0 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC**: 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Cypermethrin 25% EC**: 0.5 ml per litre of water.

### Painted Bug (Bagrada hilaris)

This is not known to affect Aonla. Painted bug is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops like mustard, cabbage, and cauliflower.

### Red Cotton Bug (Dysdercus cingulatus)

This is not known to affect Aonla. Red cotton bug is a major pest of cotton and other malvaceous plants, feeding on developing seeds.

### Black Ants

Black ants are generally not a primary pest directly damaging Aonla plants. They are often found in orchards for various reasons:
*   **Honeydew collection:** They protect and farm sap-sucking insects (like aphids, mealybugs, scales) for the honeydew these pests excrete. In such cases, controlling the primary sap-sucking pest is the most effective strategy.
*   **Nesting:** They might nest in the soil around the tree base or in tree cavities.
*   **Scavenging:** They might feed on fallen fruits or other organic matter.

**Control Measures (if ants are causing a nuisance or facilitating other pests):**

1.  **Integrated Pest Management (IPM):**
    *   Identify and control any sap-sucking pests (aphids, mealybugs, scales) that the ants might be tending.
    *   Maintain orchard hygiene to reduce food sources.
2.  **Physical Barriers:**
    *   Apply sticky bands or grease bands around the tree trunk to prevent ants from climbing up the tree.
3.  **Chemical Control (for severe infestations or nuisance):**
    *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC**: 2.5 ml per litre of water, applied as a drench around the base of the tree or directly on ant trails and mounds.
    *   **Fipronil 0.3% GR**: 10-15 kg per acre, applied as granules around the base of the trees or on ant mounds.
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL**: 0.5 ml per litre of water, applied as a drench around the base of the tree or on ant trails.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully, including safety precautions and pre-harvest intervals.
*   Apply pesticides during cooler parts of the day to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   Consider the impact on beneficial insects before applying broad-spectrum insecticides.
*   For specific recommendations tailored to your farm, it is always advisable to consult with local agricultural extension specialists.
