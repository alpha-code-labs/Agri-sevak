As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing these pests in Aonla in Haryana.

### Control of Fruit Fly in Aonla

Fruit flies, primarily species of the *Bactrocera dorsalis* complex, are known to affect Aonla. Their maggots feed inside the developing fruits, causing them to rot and fall prematurely.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategies for Fruit Fly:**

1.  **Orchard Sanitation:**
    *   Regularly collect and destroy all fallen and infested fruits by burying them deep in the soil or burning them. This breaks the life cycle of the pest.
    *   Deep ploughing after harvest can expose pupae in the soil to predators and adverse weather conditions.

2.  **Monitoring and Mass Trapping:**
    *   Install **Methyl Eugenol** pheromone traps at a rate of 10-12 traps per acre (4-5 traps per hectare) to monitor adult fruit fly populations. These traps attract male fruit flies.
    *   For mass trapping, increase the number of traps to 20-25 traps per acre (8-10 traps per hectare) to reduce the male population significantly. Replace the lure every 2-3 weeks.

3.  **Bait Sprays:**
    *   Prepare a bait solution by mixing an insecticide with a food attractant (like jaggery or sugar). This attracts adult fruit flies to feed on the poisoned bait.
    *   Apply bait sprays as spot applications on tree trunks or on a few leaves, rather than a full canopy spray, to minimize impact on beneficial insects.
    *   Recommended chemicals for bait spray:
        *   **Malathion** 50% EC at 2 ml/L of water + 10 g jaggery or sugar per liter of water.
        *   **Spinosad** 45% SC at 0.25-0.3 ml/L of water + 10 g jaggery or sugar per liter of water.

4.  **Foliar Sprays (if infestation is severe):**
    *   In cases of high infestation, a full canopy spray might be necessary, ensuring to follow pre-harvest intervals (PHI).
    *   Recommended chemical:
        *   **Spinosad** 45% SC at 0.25-0.3 ml/L of water.

### Control of Ber Fly in Aonla

This is not known to affect Aonla. The Ber fly (*Carpomyia vesuviana*) is a host-specific pest primarily affecting Ber (*Ziziphus mauritiana*) fruits.
