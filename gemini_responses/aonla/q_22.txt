As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I must clarify that commercial Aonla (Indian Gooseberry) cultivation primarily relies on planting vegetatively propagated (grafted or budded) saplings, not direct seed sowing for fruit production. This ensures genetic uniformity, early fruiting, and desired fruit quality.

However, seeds are used for raising rootstock onto which desired varieties are grafted or budded. Below are the recommended practices, distinguishing between rootstock raising and orchard establishment:

*   **Sowing method/pattern (for raising rootstock):**
    *   Aonla seeds are primarily used to raise rootstock in nursery beds or polybags for subsequent grafting/budding. Direct sowing of seeds for commercial fruit production is not recommended due to genetic variability, long juvenility, and inconsistent fruit quality.
    *   For raising rootstock, seeds should be sown in well-prepared nursery beds or individual polybags.
    *   **Method:** Line sowing is preferred over broadcasting for better management, weeding, and seedling selection. Lines can be spaced 15-20 cm apart.

*   **Planting depth (for rootstock seeds):**
    *   Aonla seeds should be sown shallowly, typically 1-2 cm deep, and covered with a thin layer of soil or sand.

*   **Spacing (for planting grafted/budded saplings in the main orchard):**
    *   The recommended spacing for planting grafted or budded Aonla saplings in the main orchard varies based on the variety, soil fertility, and desired canopy management. For Haryana conditions, common practices include:
        *   **Standard Spacing:** 6 m x 6 m (This allows for good canopy development and ease of operations).
        *   **High-Density Planting (HDP):** 4.5 m x 4.5 m (This requires specific pruning techniques to manage canopy size and maintain productivity).
    *   Pits of 1 m x 1 m x 1 m should be dug at the desired spacing and filled with a mixture of topsoil, 20 kg well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM), 1 kg **Neem cake**, and 500 g **Single Super Phosphate** at least 15-30 days before planting the saplings.

*   **Seed dose (for raising rootstock):**
    *   Aonla seeds typically have low and erratic germination rates (often ranging from 30-50%).
    *   To raise approximately 1000-1500 viable rootstock seedlings, about **1.5 - 2 kg** of fresh, viable Aonla seeds are generally required.
    *   Seeds should be collected from healthy, vigorous trees and pre-treated (e.g., soaking in water for 24-48 hours or stratification in moist sand for 60-90 days) to improve germination percentage and uniformity.
