Wilt and Parawilt are significant challenges in Aonla cultivation in Haryana, leading to considerable economic losses. An integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods is crucial for effective management.

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Soil Management:** Ensure good soil drainage. Avoid waterlogging, especially during monsoon. Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost (10-15 kg/tree/year) to improve soil structure and microbial activity.
*   **Water Management:** Provide judicious irrigation. Avoid both severe drought stress and excessive irrigation, which can predispose trees to wilt. For parawilt, avoid sudden heavy irrigation after a prolonged dry spell.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Maintain balanced nutrition. Apply recommended doses of NPK and micronutrients based on soil test reports to enhance tree vigor and resistance.
*   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy infected branches promptly to prevent further spread. Sterilize pruning tools.
*   **Root Protection:** Avoid any injury to the root system during inter-cultivation or other orchard operations.
*   **Planting Depth:** Ensure trees are not planted too deep, as this can lead to collar rot and stress.

**2. Biological Control:**
*   **Soil Application:** Apply bio-control agents like *Trichoderma viride* or *Trichoderma harzianum* to the soil around the root zone.
    *   Mix 2-4 kg of *Trichoderma* formulation with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed FYM or compost.
    *   Keep the mixture moist for 7-10 days in a shaded place.
    *   Apply this enriched mixture around the base of each tree (2-5 kg per tree, depending on age) and lightly incorporate it into the soil. Repeat annually, especially before monsoon.
*   **Drenching:** Drench the root zone with a suspension of *Trichoderma* at a concentration of **5-10 g/L** of water.

**3. Chemical Control:**
For trees showing initial symptoms of wilt, drenching the root zone with fungicides is recommended. For parawilt, chemical intervention is usually secondary to cultural practices, but if a fungal component is suspected, these can be used.

*   **Systemic Fungicides (for Fusarium Wilt):**
    *   Drench the soil around the affected tree with a solution of **Carbendazim** at **1-2 g/L** of water. Apply 5-10 liters of solution per tree, depending on its age and canopy size.
    *   Alternatively, use **Thiophanate Methyl** at **1-2 g/L** of water as a soil drench.
    *   **Propiconazole** can also be used as a drench at **0.5-1 ml/L** of water.

*   **Contact/Systemic Fungicides (Broader Spectrum):**
    *   **Copper Oxychloride** can be used as a soil drench at **2-3 g/L** of water, especially if collar rot is also suspected.
    *   A combination product of **Metalaxyl + Mancozeb** can be drenched at **2-2.5 g/L** of water, particularly if root rot or other soil-borne pathogens are suspected alongside wilt.

*   **Plant Resistance Inducers:**
    *   Drench the soil with **Potassium Phosphonate** at **2-3 ml/L** of water. This helps in inducing systemic acquired resistance in the plant.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Early Detection:** Monitor trees regularly for early symptoms of wilting. Early intervention significantly improves the chances of recovery.
*   **Integrated Approach:** No single method is completely effective. A combination of cultural, biological, and chemical strategies provides the best control.
*   **Repeat Application:** Fungicide drenches may need to be repeated after 2-3 months, especially during favorable conditions for disease development.
*   **Tree Removal:** Severely wilted and dead trees should be removed and destroyed to prevent the pathogen from spreading.
