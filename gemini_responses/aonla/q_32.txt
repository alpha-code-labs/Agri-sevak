Namaste! The "drying up" of branches, leaves, fruits, and flowers in Aonla (Indian Gooseberry) is a common and concerning symptom that can be caused by a variety of factors, ranging from fungal diseases and insect pests to nutritional deficiencies and environmental stresses. As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I advise a systematic approach to identify the root cause and implement appropriate management strategies.

Here's how to address "Drying up" in Aonla:

**I. Identify the Specific Cause (Diagnosis is Key):**

Before applying any treatment, it's crucial to observe the specific pattern of drying, presence of lesions, insect damage, or other symptoms to accurately diagnose the problem.

**II. Potential Causes and Management Strategies:**

**A. Fungal Diseases:**

1.  **Dieback:** This is a very common and serious problem in Aonla, often caused by fungi like *Colletotrichum gloeosporioides* or *Phomopsis phyllanthi*.
    *   **Symptoms:** Twigs and branches start drying from the tip downwards, often with a clear demarcation between healthy and diseased wood. Leaves on affected branches turn brown and dry.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Pruning:** Immediately prune the affected branches well into the healthy wood (at least 15-20 cm below the visible drying). Collect and burn the pruned material to prevent further spread.
        *   **Fungicide Application:** After pruning, apply a protective fungicidal paste on the cut ends. For the entire tree, spray with:
            *   **Carbendazim** at 1 g/L of water.
            *   **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water.
            *   **Copper Oxychloride** at 3 g/L of water.
        *   Repeat the spray after 15-20 days if symptoms persist or during humid conditions.

2.  **Anthracnose:** Can affect flowers, young fruits, and twigs, leading to blight and drying.
    *   **Symptoms:** Dark, sunken spots on fruits, leaves, and twigs, leading to premature fruit drop and drying of affected parts.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant parts.
        *   **Fungicide Application:** Spray with:
            *   **Carbendazim** at 1 g/L of water.
            *   **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water.
        *   Apply sprays particularly during flowering and fruit development stages if conditions are conducive (high humidity, rain).

3.  **Rust (Ravenelia emblicae):** While primarily affecting leaves and young twigs, severe infection can lead to defoliation and stress, contributing to overall drying.
    *   **Symptoms:** Orange-brown pustules on leaves, petioles, and young twigs.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Fungicide Application:** Spray with:
            *   **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water.
            *   **Propiconazole** at 0.5 ml/L of water.

4.  **Root Rot/Wilt:** If the entire plant or major branches are rapidly drying, especially in poorly drained soils.
    *   **Symptoms:** Sudden wilting and yellowing of leaves, followed by drying of branches and eventually the whole plant. Roots may appear discolored and rotted.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Improve Drainage:** Ensure proper drainage around the tree basin. Avoid waterlogging.
        *   **Fungicide Drench:** Drench the soil around the root zone with:
            *   **Carbendazim** at 2 g/L of water (5-10 L solution per tree depending on size).
            *   **Propamocarb Hydrochloride** at 2-3 ml/L of water (5-10 L solution per tree).

**B. Insect Pests:**

1.  **Bark Eating Caterpillar (Indarbela quadrinotata):** This pest bores into the bark and wood, creating tunnels and feeding on the bark, which can girdle branches and lead to drying.
    *   **Symptoms:** Presence of silken webs mixed with frass (excreta) on the bark, especially at branch crotches or where branches meet the main trunk. Holes in the bark.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Mechanical Removal:** Remove the webs and frass.
        *   **Injection:** Inject a solution of:
            *   **Chlorpyrifos** at 2 ml/L of water into the boreholes using a syringe, and then plug the holes with mud or cotton. This should be done in the evening.

2.  **Shoot Borers:** Larvae bore into young shoots, causing them to wilt and dry.
    *   **Symptoms:** Wilting and drying of young, tender shoots.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Pruning:** Prune and destroy affected shoots.
        *   **Insecticide Spray:** Spray with:
            *   **Chlorpyrifos** at 2 ml/L of water.
            *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** at 0.5 ml/L of water.

**C. Physiological and Environmental Factors:**

1.  **Water Stress:** Both severe drought and waterlogging can lead to drying symptoms.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Proper Irrigation:** Maintain consistent soil moisture. Irrigate regularly during dry periods, especially during fruit development.
        *   **Drainage:** Ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging, which suffocates roots and makes them susceptible to rot.

2.  **Nutrient Deficiencies:**
    *   **Boron Deficiency:** Can cause internal necrosis of fruits, fruit cracking, and sometimes dieback of young shoots.
        *   **Management:** Foliar spray of **Borax** at 1-1.5 g/L of water during pre-flowering and fruit set stages.
    *   **Zinc Deficiency:** Can lead to small, distorted leaves and stunted growth, making the plant more susceptible to stress.
        *   **Management:** Foliar spray of **Zinc Sulphate** at 2-3 g/L of water (neutralized with an equal amount of lime).

3.  **Heat Stress/Sunburn:** Extreme heat, especially on young plants or exposed branches, can cause scorching and drying.
    *   **Management:** Provide temporary shade for young plants. Ensure adequate irrigation during hot periods.

**III. General Cultural Practices (Prevention):**

*   **Orchard Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy fallen leaves, diseased branches, and fruit debris to reduce inoculum sources.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure the trees receive adequate and balanced nutrients through proper fertilization based on soil testing.
*   **Proper Pruning:** Prune trees annually to remove dead, diseased, or overcrowded branches, improving air circulation and light penetration. Always sterilize pruning tools.
*   **Regular Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your Aonla trees for any early signs of disease or pest infestation. Early detection allows for timely intervention.
*   **Good Drainage:** Ensure the orchard soil has good drainage to prevent root diseases.

For a precise diagnosis and tailored recommendations, it is always advisable to bring a sample of the affected plant parts to the Department of Horticulture or Plant Pathology at Haryana Agricultural University, Hisar.
