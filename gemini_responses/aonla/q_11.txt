As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm the pest status of Aonla in our region.

Based on current scientific understanding and observations in Haryana, Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies are **not known to affect Aonla** as significant pests causing economic damage. The primary insect pests of Aonla in our region are typically the Aonla fruit borer (a lepidopteran pest) and the bark-eating caterpillar.
