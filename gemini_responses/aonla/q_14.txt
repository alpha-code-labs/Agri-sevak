As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling soil pests like termites and root-knot nematodes in Aonla (Indian Gooseberry) in Haryana.

It is crucial to adopt an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods for sustainable and effective control.

### 1. Control of Termites (Dimag) in Aonla

Termites can cause significant damage to Aonla trees by feeding on the roots and stem, leading to weakening, poor growth, and even death of young plants.

**A. Cultural and Preventive Measures:**

*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove all dead wood, stumps, and debris from the orchard, as these can serve as breeding grounds for termites.
*   **Proper Irrigation:** Maintain optimal soil moisture. Both excessively dry and waterlogged conditions can sometimes favor termite activity depending on the species.
*   **Avoid Direct Contact:** Ensure that no plant parts are in direct contact with the soil, especially for young saplings, by using tree guards or raising the planting level slightly.
*   **Organic Matter:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost, as healthy soil with good organic matter content can support beneficial microorganisms that may deter termites.

**B. Chemical Control (Soil Application):**

For established infestations, chemical control may be necessary.

*   **Soil Drenching:**
    *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC**: Apply at a rate of **5 ml/L** of water. Drench the soil around the base of the affected trees, ensuring the solution penetrates the root zone. For young trees, 1-2 litres of solution per tree is generally sufficient, while for mature trees, 5-10 litres may be required depending on the canopy spread.
    *   **Fipronil 5% SC**: Apply at a rate of **3-4 ml/L** of water as a soil drench around the tree basin.

### 2. Control of Root-Knot Nematodes (Mool Granthi Krumi) in Aonla

Root-knot nematodes (primarily *Meloidogyne* species) are microscopic worms that infect the roots, causing characteristic galls or knots. This impairs the plant's ability to absorb water and nutrients, leading to stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, reduced fruit yield, and overall decline in tree health.

**A. Cultural and Preventive Measures:**

*   **Soil Solarization:** In fallow land before planting, cover the soil with transparent polyethylene sheets during hot summer months (May-June) for 4-6 weeks. This raises soil temperature and kills nematodes.
*   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporate large quantities of organic matter like well-decomposed FYM, compost, or **Neem cake** into the soil. Neem cake is particularly effective due to its nematicidal properties. Apply **1-2 kg of Neem cake per tree** annually, mixed into the soil around the root zone.
*   **Crop Rotation:** While difficult in perennial Aonla orchards, in intercropping systems, choose non-host crops or nematode-suppressing crops.
*   **Healthy Planting Material:** Always use nematode-free saplings from a reputable nursery.

**B. Biological Control:**

*   **Bio-nematicides:** Apply beneficial fungi or bacteria that parasitize or antagonize nematodes.
    *   **Purpureocillium lilacinum (formerly Paecilomyces lilacinus)**: Apply as a soil drench or mix with FYM. Use at a rate of **2.5-5 kg/acre** (or 50-100 g per tree) mixed with 50-100 kg of FYM and applied around the root zone.
    *   **Trichoderma harzianum/viride**: While primarily a fungicide, some strains can suppress nematodes. Apply at **2.5-5 kg/acre** (or 50-100 g per tree) mixed with FYM.

**C. Chemical Control (Nematicides - Soil Application):**

For severe infestations, chemical nematicides can be used, but always with caution and as part of an IPM strategy.

*   **Granular Application:**
    *   **Carbofuran 3% G**: Apply at a rate of **33 kg/acre** (or approximately **100-150 g per mature tree**) by broadcasting evenly around the tree basin and lightly incorporating into the soil, followed by irrigation.
    *   **Fluensulfone 2% GR**: Apply at a rate of **20-40 kg/acre** (or approximately **60-120 g per mature tree**) by broadcasting around the tree basin and incorporating into the soil, followed by irrigation.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (gloves, mask, eye protection) when handling any chemical pesticides.
*   **Dosage and Timing:** Adhere strictly to the recommended dosages and application timings.
*   **Soil Moisture:** Ensure adequate soil moisture before and after applying granular nematicides for optimal efficacy.
*   **Integrated Approach:** For long-term success, combine these methods rather than relying solely on chemical control. Regular monitoring of your orchard is key to early detection and effective management.
