As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding rust diseases in Aonla for Haryana, India:

1.  **Black Rust (Stem Rust), Brown Rust (Leaf Rust), Yellow Rust (Stripe Rust):**
    This is not known to affect Aonla. These rusts primarily affect cereal crops like wheat, barley, and rye.

2.  **White Rust:**
    This is not known to affect Aonla. White rust is caused by oomycetes of the genus *Albugo* and primarily affects cruciferous vegetables, amaranth, and sweet potato.

3.  **Red Rust (Algal Rust):**
    Red rust in Aonla is caused by the parasitic alga *Cephaleuros virescens*, not a true fungus. It appears as reddish-brown, velvety spots on leaves, twigs, and sometimes fruits. Severe infestations can lead to defoliation and reduced vigor.

    **Control Measures for Red Rust (Algal):**
    *   **Cultural Practices:**
        *   Improve tree vigor through balanced nutrition and proper irrigation.
        *   Ensure good air circulation by appropriate pruning.
        *   Remove and destroy severely infected branches and leaves.
    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   While primarily an algal disease, copper-based fungicides can help manage its spread.
        *   **Copper Oxychloride** (50% WP) at 2.5-3.0 g/L of water.
        *   **Bordeaux Mixture** (1%) can also be used as a protective spray.

4.  **Fungal Rust of Aonla (*Ravenelia emblicae*):**
    The most significant fungal rust disease affecting Aonla in India, including Haryana, is caused by *Ravenelia emblicae*. This true rust fungus manifests as orange-yellow pustules (uredinia and telia) primarily on the underside of leaves, but can also appear on petioles, young shoots, and fruits. Severe infection leads to premature defoliation, fruit drop, and reduced fruit quality.

    **Control Measures for Fungal Rust (*Ravenelia emblicae*):**
    *   **Cultural Practices:**
        *   **Sanitation:** Collect and destroy all fallen infected leaves, twigs, and fruits to reduce inoculum.
        *   **Pruning:** Prune infected branches during the dormant season.
        *   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure balanced fertilization to maintain tree health and vigor, making them more resilient to disease.
        *   **Spacing:** Maintain adequate plant spacing to ensure good air circulation, which helps reduce humidity and disease development.
    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   Initiate spraying at the first appearance of symptoms or as a prophylactic measure during susceptible periods (e.g., monsoon season). Repeat sprays at 10-15 day intervals if the disease pressure is high.
        *   **Propiconazole** (25% EC) at 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water.
        *   **Hexaconazole** (5% EC) at 1.0-1.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Difenoconazole** (25% EC) at 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2.0-2.5 g/L of water (as a protective spray).
        *   **Sulphur** (80% WP) at 2.0-2.5 g/L of water (effective in early stages and for mild infections).

    Always ensure thorough coverage of the foliage, especially the undersides of leaves, during spraying. Consult local agricultural extension services for specific timing recommendations based on current weather conditions and disease incidence in your area.
