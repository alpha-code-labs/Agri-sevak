Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified recommendations to address micronutrient deficiencies in Aonla (Indian Gooseberry) in Haryana.

It is crucial to emphasize that a comprehensive soil test is the foundational step to accurately diagnose any nutrient deficiency and determine its severity. Visual symptoms can be indicative, but soil analysis provides precise data for targeted nutrient management.

Here's how to address the specified micronutrient deficiencies in Aonla:

### General Guidelines for Application:
*   **Foliar sprays** are generally more effective for quick correction of micronutrient deficiencies, especially in alkaline soils common in Haryana, as they bypass soil fixation issues. Apply sprays during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late afternoon) to maximize absorption and prevent leaf scorching.
*   **Soil applications** provide a longer-term solution but may be less efficient for some micronutrients in high pH soils. Apply around the tree's drip line and incorporate lightly into the soil, followed by irrigation.

### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Characterized by 'little leaf' (abnormally small leaves), rosetting of leaves, interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins), and reduced fruit size and yield.
*   **Addressing Deficiency:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 2-5 g/L of **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (21% Zn) or 1 g/L of **Zinc EDTA** (12% Zn) in water. Repeat 2-3 times at 15-day intervals if symptoms persist.
    *   **Soil Application (for severe deficiency or long-term correction):** Apply 200-500 g of **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** per mature tree annually.

### 2. Iron (Fe) Deficiency (Ferrous)

*   **Symptoms:** Prominent interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, which may turn almost white in severe cases, while veins remain green. Common in high pH (alkaline) soils.
*   **Addressing Deficiency:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 2-5 g/L of **Ferrous sulphate heptahydrate** (19% Fe) or 1 g/L of **Ferrous EDTA** (12% Fe) in water. Repeat 2-3 times at 15-day intervals.
    *   **Soil Application (less effective in high pH soils):** Apply 200-500 g of **Ferrous sulphate heptahydrate** per mature tree. For better efficacy in alkaline soils, **Ferrous EDTA** can be applied at 50-100 g per tree.

### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Dieback of growing points, cracking and browning of fruits, internal necrosis, reduced fruit set, and malformed fruits.
*   **Addressing Deficiency:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 1-2 g/L of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (20% B) or 1.5-2 g/L of **Boric acid** (17% B) in water. Apply before flowering and during fruit development.
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 50-100 g of **Borax** (10.5-11.3% B) or **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** per mature tree, once a year.

### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Dieback of shoot tips, stunted growth, marginal necrosis of young leaves, and sometimes poor fruit quality or storage issues. While less common as a primary deficiency in Aonla, it can occur.
*   **Addressing Deficiency:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 5-10 g/L of **Calcium chloride** or **Calcium nitrate** in water. Apply during fruit development stages.
    *   **Soil Application:** For general soil health and calcium supply, especially if soil pH needs adjustment, apply **Gypsum** (Calcium sulphate dihydrate) at 2-5 kg per tree, or **Calcium carbonate** (lime) as per soil test recommendations.

### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, starting from the margins and progressing inwards, often leading to bronzing or purplish discoloration.
*   **Addressing Deficiency:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 5-10 g/L of **Magnesium sulphate heptahydrate** (Epsom salt) in water.
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 200-500 g of **Magnesium sulphate heptahydrate** per mature tree annually.

### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, similar to iron deficiency but often with a finer network of green veins, sometimes accompanied by small necrotic spots.
*   **Addressing Deficiency:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 2-5 g/L of **Manganese sulphate monohydrate** (30.5% Mn) or 1 g/L of **Manganese EDTA** (12% Mn) in water.
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 200-500 g of **Manganese sulphate monohydrate** per mature tree annually.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Compatibility:** Always check the compatibility of different chemicals before mixing them for foliar sprays. Avoid mixing with phosphatic fertilizers or highly alkaline solutions unless specifically recommended.
*   **Water Quality:** Use clean water for spraying.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management:** Micronutrient application should be part of a balanced nutrient management plan, including macro-nutrients (N, P, K) and organic matter.
