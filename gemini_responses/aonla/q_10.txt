As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in Aonla (Indian Gooseberry) in Haryana:

**1. Borers in Aonla:**
Borers, such as shoot borers and bark-eating caterpillars, can cause significant damage to Aonla trees.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Regularly inspect trees for signs of borer activity (e.g., frass, boreholes, wilting shoots).
    *   Prune and destroy affected shoots or branches to prevent further spread.
    *   Maintain orchard hygiene by removing dead wood and debris.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   For shoot borers, spray with:
        *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC at 0.2 ml/L of water.
        *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG at 0.25 g/L of water.
    *   For bark borers, clean the boreholes, remove frass, and inject a solution of:
        *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 5 ml/L of water into the holes using a syringe, then plug the holes with mud.

**2. Caterpillars in Aonla:**
Various caterpillar species can defoliate Aonla trees or damage fruits.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Hand-pick and destroy larger caterpillars or egg masses during early stages of infestation.
    *   Remove and destroy affected leaves or fruits.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Spray with any of the following insecticides when caterpillars are observed:
        *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC at 0.2 ml/L of water.
        *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG at 0.25 g/L of water.
        *   **Flubendiamide** 20% WG at 0.3 g/L of water.
        *   **Indoxacarb** 14.5% SC at 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 1.0 ml/L of water.

**3. Diamondback moth (DBM) in Aonla:**
This is not known to affect Aonla. Diamondback moth (*Plutella xylostella*) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops.

**4. Leaf folder in Aonla:**
Leaf folders cause damage by folding leaves and feeding from within, hindering photosynthesis.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Prune and destroy folded leaves containing larvae to reduce pest population.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Spray with any of the following insecticides, ensuring good coverage, especially on the underside of leaves and within folded leaves:
        *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC at 0.2 ml/L of water.
        *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG at 0.25 g/L of water.
        *   **Flubendiamide** 20% WG at 0.3 g/L of water.
        *   **Indoxacarb** 14.5% SC at 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 1.0 ml/L of water.

Always ensure to follow the label instructions for safe and effective use of pesticides, including pre-harvest intervals (PHI).
