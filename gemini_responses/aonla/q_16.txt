As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following fertilizer schedule for Aonla (Indian Gooseberry) based on scientific research and best practices for Haryana conditions.

**Crucial First Step:** Always conduct a soil test before applying any fertilizers. This will provide precise recommendations tailored to your specific field's nutrient status and pH, preventing over-application or deficiencies. The recommendations below are general guidelines for average soil conditions.

**General Fertilizer Application Guidelines:**

*   **Timing:**
    *   Apply Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), and Sulphur (S) along with half the Nitrogen (N) dose in March-April (before flowering).
    *   Apply the remaining half of the Nitrogen (N) dose in July-August (after fruit set).
*   **Method:**
    *   For soil application, spread fertilizers evenly in a ring around the tree, 30-60 cm away from the trunk, extending up to the drip line. Mix it lightly with the soil and irrigate immediately.
    *   Foliar applications should be done early morning or late evening.

### **Fertilizer Recommendations for Aonla**

#### **1. Organic Manures (Essential for Soil Health)**

*   **Farm Yard Manure (FYM) / Compost:**
    *   **Young Plants (1-3 years):** 10-20 kg per plant per year.
    *   **Bearing Plants (4 years and above):** 30-50 kg per plant per year.
    *   **Application:** Apply in December-January, mixing it well into the soil around the tree basin.

#### **2. Chemical Fertilizers (Soil Application)**

The doses are typically increased annually until the tree reaches maturity (around 10 years), after which a stable dose is maintained.

**For Young Plants (1-3 years):**
*   **Year 1:** 100 g **Urea**, 150 g **DAP**, 100 g **Muriate of Potash** per plant per year.
*   **Year 2:** 200 g **Urea**, 300 g **DAP**, 200 g **Muriate of Potash** per plant per year.
*   **Year 3:** 300 g **Urea**, 450 g **DAP**, 300 g **Muriate of Potash** per plant per year.

**For Bearing Plants (4 years and above, up to 10 years):**
Gradually increase the dose to reach the full recommendation by year 10.
*   **Nitrogen (N):** 500-1000 g N per plant per year.
    *   Source: **Urea** (46% N).
    *   Dose: 1.1 kg to 2.2 kg **Urea** per plant per year.
*   **Phosphorus (P2O5):** 250-500 g P2O5 per plant per year.
    *   Source: **DAP** (18% N, 46% P2O5) or **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5).
    *   Dose: 550 g to 1.1 kg **DAP** per plant per year OR 1.5 kg to 3.1 kg **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** per plant per year.
*   **Potassium (K2O):** 250-500 g K2O per plant per year.
    *   Source: **Muriate of Potash** (60% K2O).
    *   Dose: 420 g to 830 g **Muriate of Potash** per plant per year.
*   **Sulphur (S):** 100-200 g S per plant per year (if not adequately supplied by SSP).
    *   Source: **Elemental Sulphur** (90% S) or **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (11% S).
    *   Dose: 110 g to 220 g **Elemental Sulphur** per plant per year OR use **SSP** as a P source which also provides Sulphur.

#### **3. NPK Compound Fertilizers (Soil Application)**

*   If using a balanced NPK compound fertilizer (e.g., 12:32:16, 19:19:19), adjust the quantity to meet the N, P, K requirements mentioned above. For instance, if using **12:32:16 NPK**, you would need approximately 3.1 kg to 6.2 kg per plant per year to meet the P2O5 requirement, and then supplement with additional **Urea** and **Muriate of Potash** to balance N and K. It's often more economical and precise to use straight fertilizers.

#### **4. Nano Fertilizers (Foliar Application)**

Nano fertilizers are designed for foliar application and provide nutrients efficiently, especially during critical growth stages or to correct minor deficiencies. They are supplementary to soil-applied fertilizers.

*   **Nano-Urea:**
    *   Dose: 2-4 ml per litre of water.
    *   Application: Spray 2-3 times during the active growth and fruit development stages (e.g., pre-flowering, post-fruit set, fruit development).
*   **Nano-DAP:**
    *   Dose: 2-4 ml per litre of water.
    *   Application: Spray 2 times during the active growth and fruit development stages (e.g., pre-flowering, fruit development).

#### **5. Micronutrients (Foliar Application)**

Aonla often responds well to micronutrient sprays, especially Zinc and Boron, which are common deficiencies in Haryana soils.

*   **Zinc Sulphate (Heptahydrate):**
    *   Dose: 5 g per litre of water (0.5% solution).
    *   Application: Spray 1-2 times during the growing season, particularly if deficiency symptoms appear.
*   **Borax (Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate):**
    *   Dose: 2 g per litre of water (0.2% solution).
    *   Application: Spray 1-2 times during the growing season, especially before flowering and during fruit development.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Irrigation:** Ensure adequate irrigation after soil application of fertilizers for proper nutrient uptake.
*   **Soil pH:** Aonla prefers slightly acidic to neutral soils (pH 6.0-7.5). Soil testing will help identify if pH correction is needed.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management:** Combine chemical fertilizers with organic manures and bio-fertilizers for sustainable soil health and optimal yield.
