As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Dieback, Twig blight, and Tikka disease in Aonla in Haryana:

### Control of Dieback and Twig Blight in Aonla

Dieback and Twig blight in Aonla are often caused by fungal pathogens such as *Colletotrichum gloeosporioides* (also known as *Glomerella cingulata*) and *Botryodiplodia theobromae*. These diseases lead to the drying and death of twigs and branches, starting from the tip or any point along the twig.

**Integrated Management Strategy:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Pruning:** Regularly inspect trees and prune out all affected twigs and branches. Make cuts well into the healthy wood (at least 15-20 cm below the visible symptoms).
    *   **Sanitation:** Collect and destroy all pruned material (burn or bury deeply) to reduce the source of inoculum.
    *   **Wound Protection:** After pruning, immediately apply a fungicidal paste to the cut surfaces to prevent new infections.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure proper nutrition and irrigation to maintain tree vigor, as stressed trees are more susceptible.

2.  **Chemical Control (Fungicidal Sprays):**
    *   **Post-Pruning Application:** After pruning, spray the entire tree thoroughly with a suitable fungicide.
    *   **Prophylactic Sprays:** During periods conducive to disease development (e.g., high humidity, monsoon season), prophylactic sprays can be beneficial.

    **Recommended CIBRC Approved Fungicides:**

    *   **For Pruning Cut Paste:**
        *   Mix **Carbendazim 50% WP** at 10-15 g per 100 ml of water to make a thick paste.
        *   Alternatively, mix **Copper Oxychloride 50% WP** at 20-25 g per 100 ml of water to make a thick paste.
    *   **For Foliar Spray:**
        *   Spray with **Carbendazim 50% WP** at 0.5-1 g/L of water.
        *   Alternatively, spray with **Mancozeb 75% WP** at 2-2.5 g/L of water.
        *   Alternatively, spray with **Copper Oxychloride 50% WP** at 2.5-3 g/L of water.

    *   Repeat sprays at 15-20 day intervals if disease symptoms persist or weather conditions remain favorable for disease development.

### Tikka Disease in Aonla

This is not known to affect Aonla. Tikka disease is primarily a leaf spot disease of groundnut (*Arachis hypogaea*) caused by *Cercospora arachidicola* and *Phaeoisariopsis personata*. Aonla is not a host for these pathogens.
