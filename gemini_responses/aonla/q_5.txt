As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified control measures for Scab, Canker, Gummosis, and Lichen in Aonla (Phyllanthus emblica) for growers in Haryana:

**1. Scab (Caused by *Phyllactinia emblicae* or *Cladosporium cladosporioides*)**
*   **Symptoms:** Appears as brownish-black spots on leaves, twigs, and fruits. Severe infection can lead to premature fruit drop, fruit deformation, and reduced market value.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   Prune and destroy all infected plant parts to reduce the source of inoculum.
    *   Apply systemic or contact fungicides at the first sign of symptoms, especially during periods of high humidity and rainfall. Repeat applications at 10-15 day intervals if conditions persist.
    *   **Fungicides:**
        *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 1 g/L of water.
        *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP at 2.5 g/L of water.
        *   A combination product containing **Carbendazim** 12% + **Mancozeb** 63% WP at 2 g/L of water.

**2. Canker (Bacterial Canker: *Xanthomonas campestris* pv. *emblicae*; Fungal Canker: *Phomopsis phyllanthi*)**
*   **Symptoms:** Sunken, necrotic lesions on branches, twigs, and sometimes fruits. Bacterial canker often starts as water-soaked spots that enlarge and become dark, sometimes with gum exudation. Fungal cankers can girdle branches, leading to dieback.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Sanitation:** Prune and destroy all cankered branches and twigs well below the visible lesion during dry weather. Disinfect pruning tools with 70% alcohol or a 10% bleach solution after each cut to prevent spread.
    *   **Protective Sprays:** Apply bactericides/fungicides after pruning and during periods conducive to disease development (e.g., monsoon season).
    *   **Bactericides/Fungicides:**
        *   **Copper Oxychloride** 50% WP at 3 g/L of water.
        *   For severe bacterial canker, a combination of **Streptomycin Sulphate** 9% + **Tetracycline Hydrochloride** 1% SP at 0.6 g/L of water can be used, but **Copper Oxychloride** is generally recommended for its broad-spectrum action.

**3. Gummosis (Often a symptom of stress, injury, or fungal infections like *Phytophthora*, *Botryodiplodia*)**
*   **Symptoms:** Exudation of a sticky, amber-colored gum from the bark of the trunk or branches. This can be associated with cracks, lesions, or cankers, and may indicate underlying stress, mechanical injury, insect borers, or fungal infections.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Identify and Address Cause:** Determine the primary cause of gummosis. Ensure proper orchard management, including balanced nutrition, adequate drainage to prevent waterlogging, and protection from mechanical injuries.
    *   **Surgical Treatment:** Gently scrape off the exuded gum and diseased bark until healthy, green tissue is exposed.
    *   **Fungicidal Paste Application:** After scraping, apply a fungicidal paste to the exposed area to protect against secondary infections.
    *   **Fungicidal Paste:**
        *   Prepare a paste using **Copper Oxychloride** 50% WP (50 g in 100 ml water) or **Carbendazim** 50% WP (20 g in 100 ml water) and apply it thoroughly to the affected area.

**4. Lichen**
*   **Symptoms:** Crusty, leafy, or bushy growths of various colors (grey, green, yellow) on the bark of branches and the trunk. Lichens are symbiotic organisms (fungus and alga) and are generally non-parasitic. They thrive in humid conditions and often indicate good air quality, but can also suggest reduced tree vigor or excessive shade.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   While lichens are not directly harmful to the tree, excessive growth can sometimes harbor pests or reduce the photosynthetic activity of the bark.
    *   **Improve Air Circulation:** Prune dense branches to improve air circulation within the tree canopy, which helps reduce humidity and discourages lichen growth.
    *   **Manual Removal:** Gently scrape off lichens from the bark using a blunt tool (e.g., a plastic scraper or stiff brush) without damaging the underlying bark.
    *   **Copper-based Sprays:** Application of copper-based fungicides can help deter lichen growth.
    *   **Algicide/Fungicide:**
        *   **Copper Oxychloride** 50% WP at 3 g/L of water. This can be applied during dormant periods or after manual removal.

Always read and follow the instructions on the product label for specific dosage, application timing, and safety precautions. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) when handling and applying any chemicals.
