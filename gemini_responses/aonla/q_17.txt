As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following doses of organic manures for Aonla cultivation in Haryana to ensure optimal growth, yield, and soil health:

*   **Farmyard Manure (FYM):**
    *   For young plants (1-3 years old): 10-20 kg per plant annually.
    *   For bearing plants (4 years and older): 25-50 kg per plant annually.
    *   Apply uniformly around the basin of the tree, preferably before the monsoon (June-July) or during autumn (September-October), and incorporate lightly into the soil.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   For young plants (1-3 years old): 3-5 kg per plant annually.
    *   For bearing plants (4 years and older): 5-10 kg per plant annually.
    *   Apply in a similar manner and timing as FYM, incorporating it into the soil around the plant base.

*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract):**
    *   This is a bio-stimulant and not a primary nutrient source like FYM or vermicompost. It enhances plant growth, nutrient uptake, and stress tolerance.
    *   Foliar spray: 2-4 ml per litre of water.
    *   Apply at critical growth stages such as pre-flowering, fruit set, and during fruit development. Typically, 2-3 sprays can be given during the cropping season, ensuring good coverage of the foliage.
