Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing fungal diseases in Aonla (Indian Gooseberry) in Haryana.

First, let's clarify which of the listed diseases are known to affect Aonla:

*   **Alternaria:** Yes, *Alternaria alternata* causes leaf spot and fruit rot in Aonla.
*   **Anthracnose:** Yes, *Colletotrichum gloeosporioides* is a major disease causing fruit rot, twig blight, and leaf spot in Aonla.
*   **Blast:** This is not known to affect Aonla as a specific disease.
*   **Blight:** Yes, various blights (e.g., twig blight, fruit blight) are common symptoms in Aonla, often caused by fungi like *Colletotrichum* or *Pestalotiopsis*.
*   **Brown spot:** Yes, *Phyllosticta emblicae* and *Pestalotiopsis* cause brown leaf spots in Aonla.
*   **Downy mildew:** This is not known to affect Aonla as a significant disease.
*   **Powdery mildew:** Yes, *Oidium phyllanthi* is a very common and serious disease of Aonla, affecting leaves, flowers, and fruits.
*   **Grey mildew:** This is not a specific disease known to affect Aonla; symptoms resembling greyish growth are typically associated with Powdery Mildew.

Therefore, we will focus on the control of Alternaria, Anthracnose, Blight, Brown spot, and Powdery mildew.

**Integrated Disease Management for Fungal Diseases in Aonla:**

A combination of cultural practices and timely chemical interventions is crucial for effective control.

**I. Cultural Practices:**

1.  **Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy fallen infected leaves, fruits, and pruned twigs from the orchard. This reduces the inoculum source.
2.  **Pruning:** Prune out all diseased, dead, or overcrowded branches to improve air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce humidity and fungal growth.
3.  **Proper Spacing:** Maintain adequate plant spacing during planting to ensure good air circulation.
4.  **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced fertilizers. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can promote lush, susceptible growth.
5.  **Irrigation:** Avoid overhead irrigation, especially during flowering and fruit development, as wet conditions favor fungal diseases. If necessary, irrigate in the morning to allow foliage to dry quickly.

**II. Chemical Control (Fungicides):**

For effective control, it is essential to spray fungicides preventively or at the first sign of disease symptoms. Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

**A. For Anthracnose, Alternaria, Blight, and Brown Spot:**

These diseases often manifest as leaf spots, fruit spots, and twig blights. A general spray schedule targeting these can be followed:

1.  **Pre-flowering/New Flush Stage:**
    *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Chlorothalonil** (75% WP) at 2.0 g/L of water.

2.  **Fruit Set Stage (after flowering):**
    *   **Carbendazim** (50% WP) at 1.0 g/L of water.
    *   **Propiconazole** (25% EC) at 1.0 ml/L of water.

3.  **Fruit Development Stage (repeat every 15-20 days if disease pressure is high):**
    *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC) at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Copper Oxychloride** (50% WP) at 3.0 g/L of water (especially useful as a broad-spectrum protectant).

**B. For Powdery Mildew:**

Powdery mildew is particularly problematic on young leaves, flowers, and developing fruits, appearing as a white, powdery growth.

1.  **At the appearance of first symptoms (usually during flowering and fruit set):**
    *   **Wettable Sulphur** (80% WP) at 2.0-3.0 g/L of water. (Highly effective and economical for powdery mildew).

2.  **For severe infestations or as an alternative/rotation:**
    *   **Hexaconazole** (5% EC) at 1.0 ml/L of water.
    *   **Penconazole** (10% EC) at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Myclobutanil** (10% WP) at 0.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC) at 0.5 ml/L of water (also effective against powdery mildew).

**General Spray Schedule Recommendation:**

*   **Spray 1 (Pre-flowering/New Flush):** A broad-spectrum contact fungicide like **Mancozeb** or **Chlorothalonil**.
*   **Spray 2 (Flowering/Early Fruit Set):** A systemic fungicide like **Hexaconazole** or **Penconazole** (especially if powdery mildew is a concern) or **Carbendazim** (for anthracnose/blight).
*   **Spray 3 (Fruit Development, 15-20 days after Spray 2):** Rotate with another systemic fungicide like **Propiconazole** or **Azoxystrobin**, or a contact fungicide like **Copper Oxychloride**.
*   **Subsequent Sprays:** Continue rotation every 15-20 days, especially during periods of high humidity or rainfall, until fruit maturity, observing the pre-harvest interval (PHI) for each chemical.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the fungicide label for specific dosages, application methods, and pre-harvest intervals (PHI).
*   Ensure thorough coverage of the plant, including the undersides of leaves and developing fruits.
*   Add a good quality spreader-sticker (surfactant) to the spray solution for better efficacy, especially for waxy leaves.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and current disease pressure.

By implementing these measures, you can effectively manage fungal diseases in your Aonla orchard.
