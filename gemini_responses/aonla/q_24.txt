As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following for Aonla transplantation in Haryana:

### Ideal Transplantation Time

The ideal time for transplanting Aonla saplings in Haryana is during the monsoon season.

*   **July to August:** This period ensures sufficient moisture availability for better establishment and reduced transplant shock, leading to higher success rates.
*   **February to March:** If monsoon planting is not feasible, late winter/early spring can also be considered, provided assured irrigation facilities are available immediately after planting and throughout the establishment phase. However, monsoon planting is generally preferred.

### Recommended Planting Distance

For optimal growth, canopy development, and ease of management, the following spacing is recommended:

*   **8 meters x 8 meters (row to row x plant to plant):** This spacing allows for good light penetration, air circulation, and facilitates intercropping in the initial years.

### Transplantation Process

A successful transplantation process involves careful preparation and execution:

1.  **Pit Preparation (15-30 days before planting):**
    *   Dig pits of **1 meter x 1 meter x 1 meter** (length x width x depth) at the marked distances.
    *   Allow the pits to remain open for 15-20 days to expose the soil to sunlight and air, which helps in killing pests and pathogens.
    *   Fill each pit with a mixture of:
        *   Topsoil (from the pit)
        *   **20-25 kg** of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost.
        *   (Optional, based on soil test) **1-2 kg** of neem cake to deter termites and nematodes.
    *   Mix the contents thoroughly and mound the soil slightly above ground level to account for settling.

2.  **Sapling Selection:**
    *   Choose healthy, vigorous, disease-free, and true-to-type budded or grafted saplings from a reputable nursery.
    *   Ensure the saplings are well-rooted in their polybags or containers.

3.  **Planting the Sapling:**
    *   Carefully remove the sapling from its polybag or container, ensuring the root ball remains intact and undisturbed.
    *   Place the sapling in the center of the prepared pit.
    *   Ensure that the graft union (the point where the scion was joined to the rootstock) remains **at least 10-15 cm above the ground level** after planting.
    *   Backfill the pit with the remaining prepared soil mixture, gently firming the soil around the root ball to remove any air pockets.
    *   Create a small basin or ring around the plant for efficient watering.

4.  **Post-Planting Care:**
    *   **Immediate Irrigation:** Water the newly planted sapling thoroughly immediately after planting. This is crucial for settling the soil around the roots and reducing transplant shock.
    *   **Staking:** Provide support with a sturdy stake if the sapling is tall or in a windy area, to prevent it from bending or breaking.
    *   **Mulching:** Apply a layer of organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves, or crop residues) around the base of the plant to conserve soil moisture, regulate soil temperature, and suppress weeds.
    *   **Protection:** Protect young saplings from grazing animals and strong winds.
