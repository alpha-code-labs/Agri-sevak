### **I. Improving Aonla Yield**

Optimizing yield involves a holistic approach focusing on nutrition, water management, and plant growth regulation.

1.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Macro-nutrients (NPK):** Aonla is a heavy feeder. Annual application of NPK is crucial. For a mature tree (10+ years), apply the following per tree per year, preferably in 2-3 split doses (e.g., February-March, June-July, September-October):
        *   Nitrogen (N): 1.0 - 1.5 kg (e.g., 2.2 - 3.3 kg **Urea**)
        *   Phosphorus (P2O5): 0.5 - 0.75 kg (e.g., 1.1 - 1.65 kg **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)**)
        *   Potassium (K2O): 1.0 - 1.5 kg (e.g., 1.65 - 2.5 kg **Muriate of Potash (Potassium Chloride)**)
        *   *Always conduct a soil test to determine precise nutrient requirements.*
    *   **Micro-nutrients:** Deficiencies in Zinc and Boron are common and significantly impact fruit set and yield.
        *   **Zinc:** Foliar spray of 0.5% **Zinc Sulphate** (5 g/L of water) twice a year (e.g., pre-flowering and post-fruit set).
        *   **Boron:** Foliar spray of 0.2% **Borax (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate)** (2 g/L of water) at the pre-flowering stage.

2.  **Water Management:**
    *   Consistent moisture is vital, especially during flowering and fruit development (March to June).
    *   Drip irrigation is highly recommended for efficient water use and maintaining optimal soil moisture.
    *   Avoid water stress during critical growth stages, as it can lead to flower and fruit drop.

3.  **Pollination:**
    *   Aonla is largely cross-pollinated. Ensure adequate pollinator activity (e.g., honeybees) in the orchard. Planting pollinator-friendly plants nearby can help.

4.  **Pruning:**
    *   Regular light pruning to remove dead, diseased, or criss-crossing branches helps maintain a healthy canopy, improves light penetration, and air circulation, leading to better fruit set and development.

5.  **Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs):**
    *   To enhance fruit set and reduce premature fruit drop:
        *   Foliar spray of **Gibberellic Acid (GA3)** at 10-20 ppm (0.01-0.02 g/L of water) at the pea-size fruit stage.
        *   Alternatively, foliar spray of **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA)** at 10-20 ppm (0.01-0.02 g/L of water) at the pea-size fruit stage.

### **II. Improving Aonla Fruit Quality**

High-quality fruits are firm, well-sized, and free from blemishes.

1.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Potassium:** Crucial for fruit size, sugar content (TSS), and overall fruit development.
        *   Foliar spray of 1-2% **Potassium Nitrate** (10-20 g/L of water) or **Sulphate of Potash (Potassium Sulphate)** during fruit development (June-August).
    *   **Calcium:** Essential for cell wall integrity, fruit firmness, and reducing physiological disorders like internal necrosis.
        *   Foliar spray of 0.5-1% **Calcium Nitrate** (5-10 g/L of water) during fruit development.
    *   **Boron:** Prevents fruit cracking and internal browning.
        *   Foliar spray of 0.2% **Borax (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate)** (2 g/L of water) during fruit development.

2.  **Water Management:**
    *   Consistent water supply prevents fruit cracking, especially during rapid fruit growth and ripening. Avoid sudden fluctuations in soil moisture.

3.  **Pruning:**
    *   Proper canopy management ensures adequate sunlight penetration to all fruits, which is important for uniform ripening and color development.

4.  **Pest and Disease Control:**
    *   Timely management of pests (e.g., fruit borer) and diseases (e.g., rust) prevents damage and blemishes, ensuring a higher percentage of marketable fruits.

### **III. Improving Aonla Storage Life**

Extending storage life requires careful pre-harvest management and appropriate post-harvest handling.

1.  **Pre-harvest Factors:**
    *   **Nutrient Management:**
        *   **Calcium:** Pre-harvest foliar application of 0.5-1% **Calcium Nitrate** (5-10 g/L of water) 2-3 weeks before anticipated harvest can significantly improve fruit firmness and reduce post-harvest decay.
        *   **Potassium:** Adequate potassium levels contribute to fruit firmness and skin integrity, which are vital for longer storage. Foliar spray of 1-2% **Potassium Nitrate** (10-20 g/L of water) or **Sulphate of Potash (Potassium Sulphate)** 2-3 weeks before harvest.
    *   **Harvest Maturity:** Harvest fruits at the optimal maturity stage. Over-mature fruits have a shorter shelf life, while under-mature fruits may not develop full flavor and quality.
    *   **Gentle Handling:** Minimize mechanical damage (bruising, cuts) during harvesting, collection, and transport, as damaged fruits are highly susceptible to spoilage.

2.  **Post-harvest Practices:**
    *   **Cleaning and Sorting:** Immediately after harvest, sort fruits to remove any damaged, diseased, or immature ones. Wash fruits gently to remove dirt and debris.
    *   **Pre-cooling:** Rapidly remove field heat by pre-cooling fruits to the desired storage temperature as soon as possible after harvest. This slows down respiration and ripening.
    *   **Fungicidal Dip:** A post-harvest dip in a CIBRC-approved fungicidal solution (as per specific recommendations for edible fruits) can help control post-harvest rots. *Always follow label instructions carefully for concentration and dipping time.*
    *   **Edible Coatings:** Application of edible coatings (e.g., based on carnauba wax or chitosan) can reduce moisture loss, respiration rate, and improve fruit appearance, thereby extending shelf life.
    *   **Storage Conditions:** Store Aonla fruits at low temperatures (around 5-7°C) with high relative humidity (90-95%). Under these conditions, Aonla can be stored for several weeks.

By implementing these scientifically backed practices, you can significantly improve the yield, fruit quality, and storage life of your Aonla crop in Haryana.
