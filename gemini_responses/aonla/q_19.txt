As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice on addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium/Potash) in Aonla (Indian Gooseberry) in Haryana.

**General Recommendations for Macronutrient Management in Aonla:**

1.  **Soil Testing is Crucial:** Before applying any fertilizers, it is highly recommended to conduct a soil test. This will accurately determine the existing nutrient levels in your specific field and allow for precise fertilizer recommendations, preventing over-application or under-application.
2.  **Integrated Nutrient Management:** Combine chemical fertilizers with organic manures (like well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure or compost) to improve soil health, nutrient availability, and water retention.
3.  **Application Method:** For soil application, spread the fertilizer evenly around the tree canopy (drip line) and lightly incorporate it into the soil, followed by irrigation. Foliar applications should be done early in the morning or late in the afternoon to avoid scorching.

### Addressing Nitrogen (N) Deficiency in Aonla

**Symptoms:** Yellowing of older leaves (chlorosis), stunted growth, reduced shoot development, and poor fruit set.

**Correction:**

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   **Young Trees (1-3 years):** Apply 50-100 g of actual Nitrogen per tree per year, split into 2-3 applications (e.g., February-March, June-July).
    *   **Bearing Trees (4+ years):** Apply 200-500 g of actual Nitrogen per tree per year, split into 2-3 applications (e.g., February-March, June-July, September-October).
    *   **Chemicals:**
        *   **Urea** (46% N): For 100 g of actual N, apply approximately 217 g of **Urea**.
        *   **Calcium Ammonium Nitrate (CAN)** (25% N): For 100 g of actual N, apply approximately 400 g of **Calcium Ammonium Nitrate**.

*   **Foliar Application (for quick correction of mild deficiency):**
    *   Apply a 1-2% solution of **Urea** during active vegetative growth.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   **Urea**: Mix 10-20 g of **Urea** per litre of water.

### Addressing Phosphorus (P) Deficiency in Aonla

**Symptoms:** Dark green or purplish discoloration of older leaves, stunted growth, poor root development, delayed maturity, and reduced fruit quality.

**Correction:**

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   **Young Trees (1-3 years):** Apply 25-50 g of actual P2O5 per tree per year.
    *   **Bearing Trees (4+ years):** Apply 100-250 g of actual P2O5 per tree per year. Apply usually once a year, preferably before flowering or during fruit development.
    *   **Chemicals:**
        *   **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5): For 100 g of actual P2O5, apply approximately 625 g of **Single Super Phosphate**.
        *   **Di-Ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (46% P2O5, 18% N): For 100 g of actual P2O5, apply approximately 217 g of **Di-Ammonium Phosphate**. (Note: This also supplies Nitrogen).

*   **Foliar Application (less common but possible for mild cases):**
    *   Apply a 0.5-1% solution.
    *   **Chemicals:**
        *   **Monoammonium Phosphate (MAP)** (12% N, 61% P2O5): Mix 5-10 g of **Monoammonium Phosphate** per litre of water.
        *   **Di-Ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5): Mix 5-10 g of **Di-Ammonium Phosphate** per litre of water.

### Addressing Potassium (K) Deficiency in Aonla

**Symptoms:** Scorching or browning of leaf margins (necrosis) on older leaves, weak stems, poor fruit development, reduced fruit size and quality, and increased susceptibility to diseases.

**Correction:**

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   **Young Trees (1-3 years):** Apply 25-50 g of actual K2O per tree per year.
    *   **Bearing Trees (4+ years):** Apply 100-300 g of actual K2O per tree per year, split into 2 applications (e.g., pre-flowering and during fruit development).
    *   **Chemicals:**
        *   **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** (Potassium Chloride, 60% K2O): For 100 g of actual K2O, apply approximately 167 g of **Muriate of Potash**.
        *   **Sulphate of Potash (SOP)** (Potassium Sulphate, 50% K2O): For 100 g of actual K2O, apply approximately 200 g of **Sulphate of Potash**.

*   **Foliar Application (for quick correction of mild deficiency):**
    *   Apply a 1-2% solution.
    *   **Chemicals:**
        *   **Potassium Nitrate** (13% N, 45% K2O): Mix 10-20 g of **Potassium Nitrate** per litre of water.
        *   **Sulphate of Potash (SOP)** (Potassium Sulphate, 50% K2O): Mix 10-20 g of **Sulphate of Potash** per litre of water.

Always ensure proper irrigation after soil application of fertilizers to facilitate nutrient uptake by the roots. For specific recommendations tailored to your farm, please consult with the agricultural extension services at HAU, Hisar, or your local Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK).
