As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following doses for growth regulators and Boron in Aonla cultivation, based on scientific research and practices suitable for Haryana conditions:

### Recommended Doses for Growth Regulators/Hormones and Boron in Aonla

1.  **Ethephon (for fruit ripening/de-greening):**
    *   **Ethephon** (e.g., 40% SL formulation): 1.25 - 2.5 ml per liter of water (equivalent to 500-1000 ppm).
    *   **Application:** Spray 7-10 days before the anticipated harvest date when fruits have attained physiological maturity but are still green. This promotes uniform ripening and color development.

2.  **2,4-D (for fruit retention):**
    *   **2,4-D Sodium Salt** (e.g., 80% WP formulation): 1.25 - 2.5 g per 100 liters of water (equivalent to 10-20 ppm).
    *   **Application:** Apply as a foliar spray during the fruit set stage or when fruits are very small (pea size) to reduce premature fruit drop. *Caution: Higher concentrations can act as a herbicide and cause severe damage to the crop. Always use precise measurements.*

3.  **Boron (as a micronutrient for fruit development and quality):**
    *   **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate, 11% Boron): 1 - 2 g per liter of water (0.1% - 0.2% solution).
    *   **OR**
    *   **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (Solubor, 20% Boron): 0.5 - 1 g per liter of water (0.05% - 0.1% solution).
    *   **Application:** Apply as a foliar spray. Typically, 2-3 sprays are recommended:
        *   First spray: Before flowering.
        *   Second spray: At fruit set.
        *   Third spray: During fruit development (e.g., 45-60 days after fruit set).
    *   **Benefits:** Boron is crucial for pollen viability, fruit set, and preventing physiological disorders like internal necrosis (browning) in Aonla fruits, which is a common problem in Boron-deficient soils.

**General Recommendations:**
*   Always ensure thorough coverage of the foliage and fruits during spraying.
*   Use a good quality spreader/sticker for better efficacy, especially for foliar nutrient applications.
*   Always read and follow the specific instructions and safety precautions provided on the product label by the manufacturer.
*   Adjust spray volume to ensure adequate coverage without excessive runoff.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension services for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's soil test results and prevailing conditions.
