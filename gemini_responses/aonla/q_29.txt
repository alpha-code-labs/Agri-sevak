Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling flower and fruit drop in Aonla.

Firstly, regarding "Tinda/Boll dropping":
*   **This is not known to affect Aonla.** Aonla (Indian Gooseberry) is a tree fruit, and it does not produce Tinda (Indian round gourd) or Bolls (cotton fruit). These are fruits of entirely different plant species.

Now, let's address flower and fruit drop in Aonla, which is a common physiological issue. Dropping can be due to various factors including nutritional deficiencies, water stress, hormonal imbalances, and adverse environmental conditions.

Here are the recommended control measures:

**I. Agronomic and Cultural Practices:**

1.  **Water Management:** Ensure adequate and consistent irrigation, especially during critical stages of flowering and fruit set (March-April and again in September-October). Water stress is a major cause of drop. Avoid both waterlogging and severe drought.
2.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Apply balanced fertilizers based on soil test recommendations.
    *   Ensure sufficient availability of micronutrients, particularly Boron and Zinc, which are crucial for flower retention and fruit development.
3.  **Weed Control:** Keep the basin area around the Aonla trees free from weeds to reduce competition for water and nutrients.
4.  **Pruning:** Light pruning of dead, diseased, or overcrowded branches can improve air circulation and overall tree health, indirectly contributing to better fruit retention.

**II. Hormonal and Micronutrient Sprays:**

To directly address flower and fruit drop, specific plant growth regulators and micronutrients can be applied as foliar sprays. Always ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.

1.  **For Flower and Early Fruit Drop:**
    *   **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA):** Spray at a concentration of 10-20 ppm (parts per million). This translates to approximately 1-2 ml of a 4.5% SL formulation per 10 litres of water. Apply at the full bloom stage and again 15-20 days later if needed.
    *   **Boron:** A deficiency of Boron is a major cause of flower and fruit drop. Spray with **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (e.g., Solubor) at 0.1% concentration (1 gram per litre of water) or **Sodium tetraborate decahydrate** (Borax) at 0.2% concentration (2 grams per litre of water) at the pre-flowering stage and again at fruit set.

2.  **For Fruit Retention and Development:**
    *   **Gibberellic Acid (GA3):** Spray at 20-30 ppm (20-30 mg per litre of water) at the pea-size stage of fruits to improve fruit retention and size.
    *   **Zinc Sulphate:** Zinc deficiency can also lead to poor fruit set and drop. Spray with **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** at 0.5% concentration (5 grams per litre of water) along with 0.25% lime (2.5 grams per litre of water) to neutralize acidity, at the pre-flowering stage.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always use the recommended concentrations. Higher concentrations of hormones can have adverse effects.
*   Spray during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to maximize absorption and minimize evaporation.
*   Ensure good quality water for spraying.
*   Consult your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and soil test results.

By adopting these integrated management practices, you can significantly reduce flower and fruit drop in your Aonla orchard and achieve better yields.
