Mites, including Red Spider Mite (Tetranychus urticae) and Rust Mite (Eriophyidae family), are known pests of Aonla (Indian Gooseberry) in Haryana. They cause damage by sucking sap, leading to bronzing, leaf distortion, reduced photosynthesis, and ultimately affecting fruit quality and yield. Effective control requires an integrated approach.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Mites in Aonla:**

1.  **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your Aonla trees, especially the undersides of leaves, for signs of mites. Red spider mites often produce fine webbing, while rust mites cause bronzing or a rusty appearance on leaves and sometimes fruits.
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Maintain good orchard hygiene by removing weeds that can harbor mites.
    *   Ensure proper irrigation, as water-stressed plants are more susceptible to mite infestations.
    *   Prune overcrowded branches to improve air circulation, which can deter mite build-up.
3.  **Biological Control:** Encourage natural enemies such as predatory mites (e.g., *Amblyseius* species), ladybird beetles, and lacewings by minimizing the use of broad-spectrum insecticides that can harm these beneficial insects.

**Chemical Control (Acaricides):**

When mite populations reach damaging levels, chemical intervention becomes necessary. Always rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Ensure thorough spray coverage, particularly on the undersides of leaves where mites predominantly reside.

Here are some CIBRC approved acaricides recommended for mite control in Aonla:

*   **Spiromesifen** (e.g., 22.9% SC formulation): Apply at 0.6 - 1 ml/L of water.
*   **Fenpyroximate** (e.g., 5% SC formulation): Apply at 0.5 ml/L of water.
*   **Propargite** (e.g., 57% EC formulation): Apply at 1 - 1.5 ml/L of water.
*   **Abamectin** (e.g., 1.9% EC formulation): Apply at 0.25 - 0.5 ml/L of water.
*   **Wettable Sulphur** (e.g., 80% WP formulation): Apply at 2 - 3 g/L of water. This is particularly effective against rust mites and also provides control against powdery mildew.
*   **Etoxazole** (e.g., 10% SC formulation): Apply at 0.5 g/L of water. This is a mite growth regulator, primarily effective on eggs and nymphs.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the product label for specific dosages, application timing, safety precautions, and the pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Ensure complete and uniform coverage of the foliage, especially the undersides of leaves.
*   Spray during the cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize evaporation, maximize efficacy, and reduce potential harm to beneficial insects.
*   For the most current and localized recommendations, it is advisable to consult with your local HAU extension specialist.
