Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding various rot types in Aonla (Indian Gooseberry). Rots are significant challenges, often caused by a complex of fungal and oomycete pathogens, leading to considerable yield losses if not managed effectively.

It is important to understand that many of the terms you've used (Root, Stem, Foot, Collar, Crown, Neck, Black, Fruit, Seed, and Seedling rot) describe symptoms that can be caused by various pathogens affecting different parts of the Aonla plant. All these types of rot are known to affect Aonla in some form or another, depending on the specific pathogen and environmental conditions.

Effective management requires an integrated approach combining cultural practices, biological control, and judicious use of CIBRC-approved chemical fungicides.

Here's a comprehensive guide to control rot types in Aonla:

### General Principles for Rot Management in Aonla:

1.  **Orchard Hygiene:** Regularly remove and destroy infected plant debris, fallen fruits, and severely diseased plants to reduce inoculum.
2.  **Good Drainage:** Ensure proper drainage in the orchard to prevent waterlogging, which is conducive to many rot-causing pathogens. Plant on raised beds in heavy soils.
3.  **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced fertilizers to enhance plant vigor and resistance. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can make plants more susceptible.
4.  **Avoid Injury:** Prevent mechanical injuries to the trunk, roots, and fruits during cultivation, pruning, and harvesting, as wounds serve as entry points for pathogens.
5.  **Proper Pruning:** Prune trees to ensure good air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce humidity and fungal growth.
6.  **Use Healthy Planting Material:** Always use healthy, disease-free seeds or seedlings from reputable sources.

### Specific Rot Complexes and Their Management:

#### I. Collar Rot / Root Rot / Foot Rot / Crown Rot / Neck Rot Complex

This complex primarily affects the base of the tree (collar region), roots, and lower stem, often leading to wilting and eventual death of the tree. Common pathogens include *Phytophthora* spp., *Fusarium* spp., and *Rhizoctonia* spp.

*   **Symptoms:** Yellowing of leaves, defoliation, wilting, bark cracking, gum exudation at the collar region, rotting of roots, and lesions extending upwards from the soil line.

*   **Management:**
    *   **Cultural Practices:**
        *   Ensure excellent drainage; avoid water stagnation around the tree base.
        *   Avoid piling soil or organic matter directly against the trunk.
        *   Expose the collar region to sunlight by removing soil up to 15-20 cm depth around the trunk for a few days during dry periods.
    *   **Biological Control:**
        *   **Soil Application:** Apply *Trichoderma viride* or *Trichoderma harzianum* @ 2.5 kg/acre mixed with 50 kg of well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost. Apply this mixture around the root zone of the trees.
    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   **Drenching:** Drench the soil around the collar region of affected and surrounding healthy trees with a solution of **Metalaxyl-M + Mancozeb** (e.g., 4% + 64% WP) @ 2.5 g/L water, or **Propamocarb Hydrochloride** (72.2% SL) @ 2.5 ml/L water. Apply 5-10 litres of solution per tree depending on its size. Repeat after 15-20 days if symptoms persist or conditions are favorable for disease.
        *   **Paste Application (for visible lesions):** Scrape off the infected bark from the collar region until healthy tissue is exposed. Apply a thick paste made from **Copper Oxychloride** (50% WP) @ 50 g in 100 ml water, or **Carbendazim** (50% WP) @ 20 g in 100 ml water, to the scraped area.

#### II. Fruit Rot (Including Black Rot symptoms)

Fruit rots can occur both pre-harvest and post-harvest, significantly reducing marketable yield. Common pathogens include *Alternaria* spp., *Colletotrichum* spp., and *Phytophthora* spp. "Black Rot" is often a descriptive term for severe, dark-colored fruit decay.

*   **Symptoms:** Brown to black, water-soaked spots on fruits, softening of tissue, often leading to complete decay and mummification.

*   **Management:**
    *   **Cultural Practices:**
        *   Maintain orchard sanitation by regularly removing and destroying fallen infected fruits.
        *   Harvest fruits carefully to avoid any physical injury.
        *   Ensure proper ventilation in storage if fruits are stored.
    *   **Chemical Control (Pre-harvest):**
        *   Spray the trees with **Mancozeb** (75% WP) @ 2.5 g/L water, or **Chlorothalonil** (75% WP) @ 2 g/L water, or **Azoxystrobin** (23% SC) @ 0.5 ml/L water.
        *   For anthracnose-like symptoms (sunken lesions with pinkish spore masses), **Carbendazim** (50% WP) @ 1 g/L water can be effective.
        *   Initiate spraying at fruit set and repeat at 15-day intervals, especially during periods of high humidity or rainfall, until harvest. Ensure thorough coverage of fruits and foliage.

#### III. Seed Rot and Seedling Rot (Damping-off)

These problems are critical in the nursery stage, leading to poor germination and seedling mortality. Pathogens like *Pythium* spp., *Phytophthora* spp., and *Rhizoctonia* spp. are commonly involved.

*   **Symptoms:** Seeds fail to germinate (pre-emergence damping-off), or seedlings rot at the soil line, collapse, and die (post-emergence damping-off).

*   **Management:**
    *   **Cultural Practices:**
        *   Use well-drained, sterilized nursery media. Solarization of nursery beds during hot months is highly recommended.
        *   Avoid overcrowding of seedlings in nursery beds or trays.
        *   Ensure proper ventilation in the nursery.
        *   Avoid excessive irrigation; water seedlings gently and only when necessary.
    *   **Biological Control:**
        *   **Seed Treatment:** Treat Aonla seeds with *Trichoderma viride* or *Trichoderma harzianum* @ 5-10 g/kg seed before sowing.
        *   **Soil Drench:** Drench the nursery beds with a suspension of *Trichoderma viride* or *Trichoderma harzianum* @ 5 g/L water after sowing or at the first sign of disease.
    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds with **Carbendazim** (50% WP) @ 2 g/kg seed, or **Thiram** (75% WS) @ 2.5 g/kg seed, before sowing.
        *   **Soil Drench:** Drench the nursery beds with **Metalaxyl-M + Mancozeb** (e.g., 4% + 64% WP) @ 2.5 g/L water, or **Propamocarb Hydrochloride** (72.2% SL) @ 2.5 ml/L water, immediately after sowing or at the first sign of damping-off.

Remember, an integrated approach is always the most sustainable and effective way to manage diseases. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions for chemical application rates and safety precautions. For specific diagnosis and tailored advice, it is always recommended to consult with local agricultural extension specialists.
