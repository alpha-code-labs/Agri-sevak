Namaste Kisan Bhai,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice regarding "dropping" in peas.

Firstly, regarding "Tinda/Boll dropping," this is not known to affect Peas, as peas produce pods, not tinda (a type of gourd) or bolls (cotton).

For flower drop and pod drop (which is the equivalent of fruit drop in peas), it is important to understand that this is primarily a physiological issue, not a disease or pest that can be controlled by a single chemical application. It is often a symptom of environmental stress or nutritional imbalances.

**Common Causes of Flower and Pod Drop in Peas:**

*   **Environmental Stress:**
    *   **High Temperatures:** Temperatures above 25-30°C during flowering and pod development can significantly reduce pollen viability and pod set.
    *   **Water Stress:** Both drought conditions (insufficient water) and waterlogging (excess water) can lead to flower and pod abortion.
    *   **Humidity:** Very low or very high humidity can affect pollination and pod development.
    *   **Strong Winds:** Can cause physical damage and desiccation.
    *   **Lack of Sunlight:** Insufficient light reduces photosynthesis, impacting energy for pod development.
*   **Nutritional Deficiencies:**
    *   **Boron (B) deficiency:** Essential for pollen germination and tube growth.
    *   **Molybdenum (Mo) deficiency:** Important for nitrogen metabolism and nodule function.
    *   **Potassium (K) and Phosphorus (P) deficiency:** Crucial for overall plant vigor and reproductive development.
*   **Physiological Factors:**
    *   **Poor Pollination:** Although peas are largely self-pollinating, extreme conditions can affect it.
    *   **Excessive Vegetative Growth:** If the plant puts too much energy into leaves and stems, it may shed flowers/pods.
    *   **Heavy Pod Load:** The plant may naturally shed some pods to balance resource allocation.

**Management Strategies to Control Flower and Pod Drop in Peas:**

To minimize flower and pod drop, focus on providing optimal growing conditions and balanced nutrition:

1.  **Optimal Sowing Time:**
    *   Sow peas at the recommended time for Haryana (typically October-November) to ensure that the critical flowering and pod development stages occur during cooler periods, avoiding the stress of high temperatures.

2.  **Irrigation Management:**
    *   Maintain adequate soil moisture, especially during the flowering and pod development stages.
    *   Avoid both water stress (drought) and waterlogging. Light and frequent irrigation is often more beneficial than heavy, infrequent irrigation.

3.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Balanced Fertilization:** Ensure adequate supply of macro and micronutrients based on soil test reports.
    *   **Boron:** If boron deficiency is suspected or known in your soil, apply **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate) at 10-15 kg/acre as a basal application. Alternatively, a foliar spray of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (e.g., Solubor) at 1-1.5 g/L water can be applied at the pre-flowering and early pod development stages.
    *   **Molybdenum:** In acidic soils, molybdenum deficiency can occur. Apply **Sodium molybdate** or **Ammonium molybdate** at 200-300 g/acre as a foliar spray.
    *   **Potassium and Phosphorus:** Ensure these are applied as per soil test recommendations. Foliar sprays of **Mono Potassium Phosphate (0-52-34)** at 5 g/L can be beneficial during flowering and pod filling stages to boost plant vigor and pod development.

4.  **Weed Control:**
    *   Keep the field free of weeds to reduce competition for water, nutrients, and light, which can otherwise stress the pea plants.

5.  **Pest and Disease Management:**
    *   While not direct causes of dropping, severe infestations of sucking pests (like aphids, thrips) or root diseases can weaken the plant, indirectly contributing to flower/pod drop. Implement integrated pest and disease management practices as needed to keep plants healthy.

6.  **Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs):**
    *   While some PGRs like **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA)** are used in other crops to reduce fruit drop, their routine recommendation for peas in Haryana specifically for flower/pod drop is not a primary strategy. However, if environmental conditions are particularly challenging and other measures are insufficient, a very low concentration of **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA)** (e.g., 5-10 ppm, which is 5-10 mg/L) could be considered at the early flowering stage. **Caution:** Use only after consulting with local agricultural experts, as incorrect dosage can be detrimental.

By implementing these comprehensive management strategies, you can significantly reduce flower and pod drop in your pea crop and ensure better yields.
