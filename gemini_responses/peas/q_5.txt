As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the conditions mentioned for Peas in Haryana:

1.  **Scab:**
    This is not known to affect Peas.

2.  **Canker in Peas:**
    Canker-like symptoms in peas are typically associated with fungal diseases causing foot rot or stem blight, such as the Ascochyta blight complex (e.g., *Didymella pinodes*) or Fusarium root rot. These diseases cause dark, sunken lesions (cankers) on the stem, especially near the soil line, which can girdle the stem and lead to wilting and plant death.

    **Control Measures:**
    *   **Cultural Practices:**
        *   Use certified, disease-free seeds.
        *   Practice strict crop rotation, avoiding peas or other susceptible legumes in the same field for at least 3-4 years.
        *   Ensure good field sanitation by removing and destroying infected plant debris after harvest.
        *   Improve soil drainage to prevent waterlogging, which favors fungal pathogens.
        *   Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, as it can promote lush growth that is more susceptible to disease.
        *   Plant resistant or tolerant pea varieties if available.
    *   **Chemical Control (Seed Treatment is highly recommended for prevention):**
        *   **Seed Treatment:** To protect against seed-borne and soil-borne pathogens causing root rot and foot rot:
            *   **Carbendazim** @ 1-2 g/kg seed.
            *   **Thiram** @ 2-3 g/kg seed.
            *   A combination product containing **Metalaxyl-M** + **Difenoconazole** @ 1 ml/kg seed (or as per product label instructions).
        *   **Foliar/Stem Application (if symptoms appear and are severe):** While seed treatment is primary, if blight symptoms extend to the stem causing cankers, foliar sprays may help manage disease spread:
            *   **Mancozeb** @ 2.5 kg/acre.
            *   **Propiconazole** @ 200 ml/acre.
            *   **Azoxystrobin** @ 200 ml/acre.
            *   **Carbendazim** @ 500 g/acre.

3.  **Gummosis:**
    This is not known to affect Peas. Gummosis is typically observed in woody plants and trees, not herbaceous annuals like peas.

4.  **Lichen:**
    This is not known to affect Peas. Lichens are symbiotic organisms that grow on surfaces like tree bark, rocks, or soil, and do not parasitize or grow on the short-lived herbaceous stems of pea plants.
