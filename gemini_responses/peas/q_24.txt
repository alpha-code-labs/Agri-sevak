As a Senior Agronomist, I must clarify that **transplantation is generally not recommended for peas.** Peas (Pisum sativum) have a sensitive root system, and transplanting can cause significant transplant shock, leading to stunted growth, reduced yield, or even plant death.

Therefore, the ideal method for cultivating peas is **direct sowing**. Below is the scientifically verified advice for direct sowing peas in Haryana:

### Ideal Sowing Time (Instead of Transplantation Time)
*   **Rabi Season:** Peas are a Rabi crop. The ideal sowing window in Haryana is from **mid-October to mid-November**.
    *   **Early Sowing (Mid-October):** Can be done for early market advantage, but may face higher temperatures initially.
    *   **Optimal Sowing (Late October - Mid-November):** Provides the best conditions for germination and growth, leading to higher yields.

### Ideal Sowing Distance (Instead of Transplantation Distance)
*   **Row-to-Row Distance:** Maintain a distance of **30-45 cm** between rows.
*   **Plant-to-Plant Distance:** Maintain a distance of **5-10 cm** within the row.
    *   For bushy or vigorous varieties, slightly wider spacing might be beneficial.

### Ideal Sowing Process (Instead of Transplantation Process)
1.  **Land Preparation:**
    *   Prepare a well-pulverized and friable seedbed.
    *   Perform 1-2 ploughings followed by planking to achieve a fine tilth.
    *   Ensure good drainage, as peas are sensitive to waterlogging.
2.  **Seed Treatment:**
    *   Treat seeds with a fungicide to protect against soil-borne diseases like damping-off and root rot. Common CIBRC approved technical chemicals include:
        *   **Carbendazim** (e.g., 1-2 g/kg seed)
        *   **Thiram** (e.g., 2-3 g/kg seed)
    *   Inoculate seeds with Rhizobium culture (e.g., 1 packet/10 kg seed) just before sowing, especially if peas are being grown for the first time in the field or if the field has a history of poor nodulation. This enhances nitrogen fixation.
3.  **Sowing Method:**
    *   Sow seeds at a depth of **3-5 cm**. Deeper sowing can delay emergence, while shallower sowing can expose seeds to birds or inadequate moisture.
    *   Use a seed drill for uniform sowing and spacing, or sow manually in furrows.
4.  **Irrigation:**
    *   A light irrigation immediately after sowing is crucial for good germination.
    *   Subsequent irrigations should be given as needed, typically at pre-flowering and pod development stages, avoiding waterlogging.

By following these direct sowing practices, you can ensure healthy growth and optimal yields of peas in Haryana.
