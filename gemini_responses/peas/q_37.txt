Protecting pea crops from wild animals is a significant challenge for farmers in Haryana. A multi-pronged, integrated approach is often the most effective. Here are scientifically verified methods:

*   **Physical Barriers:**
    *   **Fencing:** This is the most effective long-term solution.
        *   **Barbed Wire Fencing:** Install a robust fence of at least 5-6 strands, reaching a height of 1.5 to 2 meters, to deter larger animals like Nilgai (blue bull), wild boar, and stray cattle. Ensure the fence is well-maintained and regularly checked for breaches.
        *   **Electric Fencing:** A highly effective deterrent against most large mammals. It delivers a non-lethal shock that discourages animals from entering. Installation must be done by certified professionals, adhering to safety standards, and requires regular power supply and maintenance.
        *   **Netting:** For smaller plots or high-value areas, fine mesh netting can protect against birds, hares, and rodents. Bird netting can be draped over the crop or supported by frames.
*   **Scare Devices:**
    *   **Scarecrows and Human Effigies:** While animals can habituate to them, regularly changing their location, appearance, or adding moving parts can extend their effectiveness.
    *   **Noise Makers:** Intermittent use of firecrackers, drums, or gas guns (where permitted) can temporarily scare animals away. However, continuous noise can lead to habituation.
    *   **Reflective Tapes and CDs:** Hanging reflective strips or old CDs can deter birds due to their movement and reflection of light.
*   **Human Vigilance and Guarding:**
    *   **Field Guarding:** The most direct and often most effective method, especially during critical growth stages (flowering, pod formation). Employing watchmen or farmers taking turns to guard the fields, particularly during dawn, dusk, and night, can significantly reduce damage.
*   **Habitat Management:**
    *   **Clearing Field Edges:** Remove weeds, bushes, and tall grass from around the field perimeter. This reduces cover for animals like wild boar, rodents, and hares, making them more exposed and less likely to approach.
    *   **Removing Attractants:** Ensure no garbage, crop residues, or other potential food sources are left near the field that might attract animals.
*   **Repellents (Limited Effectiveness for Field Crops):**
    *   While various natural or chemical repellents exist, their effectiveness for large-scale field crops like peas against wild animals is often limited and requires frequent reapplication, especially after rain. Some farmers use strong-smelling substances like garlic paste, chili powder, or fermented cow dung slurry around the field perimeter, but their efficacy varies. No specific CIBRC-approved chemical repellents are widely recommended for direct application on pea crops for wild animal deterrence in a practical, large-scale farming context.
*   **Community-Based Approaches:**
    *   **Coordinated Efforts:** Work with neighboring farmers to implement protection strategies simultaneously. A collective effort is often more successful than individual attempts, as animals might simply move to an unprotected adjacent field.
    *   **Reporting to Forest Department:** If protected wild animal species are causing significant damage, report the issue to the local Forest Department for advice and potential intervention.
