As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Peas in Haryana:

**1. Grasshopper**
Grasshoppers can cause significant damage to pea crops by feeding on leaves, stems, and pods.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Maintain field sanitation by removing weeds and crop residues that can serve as breeding grounds and shelter for grasshoppers.
    *   Deep ploughing after harvest can expose grasshopper eggs to predators and adverse weather conditions, reducing subsequent populations.
*   **Chemical Control (if infestation is severe):**
    *   Apply insecticides when nymphs or adults are observed causing significant damage. Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.
    *   **Malathion 50% EC**: 1.0 - 1.25 Litres per acre in 500-600 Litres of water.
    *   **Quinalphos 25% EC**: 1.0 - 1.25 Litres per acre in 500-600 Litres of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC**: 100 - 120 ml per acre in 200-300 Litres of water.
