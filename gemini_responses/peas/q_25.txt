As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified irrigation management practices for peas (Pisum sativum) in Haryana:

Peas are sensitive to both water stress and waterlogging. Proper irrigation management, tailored to soil type, weather conditions, and crop growth stage, is crucial for maximizing yield and water use efficiency.

**General Principles:**
*   Avoid waterlogging at all costs, as it can lead to root rot and significant yield losses.
*   Light and frequent irrigations are generally more beneficial than heavy, infrequent ones for peas.
*   Always consider recent rainfall when planning irrigations.

**1. First Irrigation:**
The timing of the first irrigation is critical for proper crop establishment and early vegetative growth.
*   **Timing:**
    *   If the crop is sown in optimum soil moisture conditions (e.g., after a pre-sowing irrigation or good residual moisture), the first irrigation is typically given around **30-40 days after sowing (DAS)**. This coincides with the branching or early vegetative growth stage, which is important for developing a strong plant structure.
    *   If the soil moisture at sowing is suboptimal, a very light irrigation might be considered slightly earlier, but generally, it's best to allow the root system to establish before the first post-sowing irrigation.
*   **Amount:** A light irrigation is recommended to ensure uniform moisture penetration without causing crust formation on the soil surface, which can impede seedling emergence or early growth.

**2. Second and Subsequent Irrigations:**
Subsequent irrigations should be timed to meet the crop's high water demand during its most critical growth stages.
*   **Critical Stages:**
    *   **Pre-flowering/Flowering Stage (around 60-70 DAS):** This is the most critical stage for water requirement. Water stress during flowering can lead to significant flower drop, poor pod set, and a drastic reduction in yield.
    *   **Pod Development and Filling Stage:** Adequate moisture is essential for proper pod elongation and the healthy development and filling of seeds within the pods. Stress at this stage results in shriveled peas and reduced marketable yield.
*   **Timing:**
    *   The second irrigation is usually given around the **pre-flowering or early flowering stage** to ensure sufficient moisture during this sensitive period.
    *   A third irrigation (if needed) should be provided during the **pod development and filling stage**, especially if there is a prolonged dry spell or if the soil type has low water retention capacity.
*   **Frequency:** In Haryana's agro-climatic conditions, peas typically require **2-3 irrigations** in total (including the first one), depending on soil type, rainfall distribution, and prevailing temperatures. Sandy soils will require more frequent, lighter irrigations, while heavier soils may require fewer.
*   **Monitoring:** Regularly check soil moisture status by hand (feeling the soil at root depth) or by observing the plants for signs of wilting, particularly during the afternoon. Irrigate when about 50% of the available soil moisture in the root zone has been depleted.

**3. Sprinkler Use in Peas:**
Sprinkler irrigation is highly recommended for peas, particularly in Haryana, given the emphasis on water conservation and efficient resource management.
*   **Advantages:**
    *   **High Water Use Efficiency:** Sprinklers apply water uniformly and precisely, significantly reducing losses due to deep percolation, surface runoff, and evaporation compared to traditional flood irrigation. This can lead to water savings of **30-50%**.
    *   **Uniform Water Distribution:** Ensures even moisture availability across the entire field, promoting uniform crop growth and higher yields.
    *   **Suitable for Varied Topography:** Can be effectively used on undulating or uneven land where flood irrigation is challenging.
    *   **Reduced Soil Erosion and Crusting:** The gentle application rate prevents soil erosion and minimizes the formation of hard soil crusts, which can hinder seedling emergence.
    *   **Microclimate Modification:** Can help in lowering canopy temperatures during periods of high heat, which can be beneficial during the sensitive flowering stage.
*   **Recommendations for Sprinkler Use:**
    *   **Type:** Low-pressure micro-sprinklers or mini-sprinklers are ideal for peas due to their fine droplet size and gentle application.
    *   **Timing:** Apply water during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize evaporative losses from the water droplets and soil surface.
    *   **Duration and Intensity:** Apply water at a low intensity for a sufficient duration to allow for proper infiltration into the root zone without causing surface runoff or waterlogging. The goal is to replenish the depleted soil moisture.
    *   **Frequency:** Sprinkler systems allow for more frequent, lighter applications, which is beneficial for peas. Adjust the frequency based on daily evapotranspiration rates, soil type, and the crop's growth stage.

By adopting these scientifically sound irrigation practices, farmers in Haryana can optimize pea production, enhance water use efficiency, and contribute to sustainable agriculture.
