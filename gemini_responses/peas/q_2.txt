As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding rust diseases in Peas for Haryana.

First, let's clarify which of the mentioned rusts are known to affect Peas:

*   **Black Rust (*Puccinia graminis*):** This is not known to affect Peas. It primarily affects cereal crops like wheat, barley, and oats.
*   **Brown Rust (*Puccinia recondita*, *Puccinia hordei*):** This is not known to affect Peas. It primarily affects cereal crops like wheat and barley.
*   **Yellow Rust (*Puccinia striiformis*):** This is not known to affect Peas. It primarily affects cereal crops like wheat and barley.
*   **White Rust:** This term usually refers to diseases caused by *Albugo* species, which are oomycetes (not true fungi) and primarily affect cruciferous crops (e.g., mustard, radish). This is not known to affect Peas.
*   **Red Rust:** While "Red Rust" can be a general term, the specific rust disease that commonly affects Peas is **Pea Rust**, caused by the fungus *Uromyces viciae-fabae* (also known as *Uromyces pisi* or *Uromyces fabae*). This is the disease we need to focus on for control measures in Peas.

### Control of Pea Rust (*Uromyces viciae-fabae*) in Peas

Pea rust is characterized by the appearance of small, reddish-brown pustules (uredinia) on leaves, stems, and pods, which later turn dark brown to black (telia). Severe infection can lead to defoliation, reduced photosynthesis, and significant yield losses. The disease is favored by cool, moist weather and high humidity.

**1. Cultural and Agronomic Practices:**

*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available and suitable for local conditions, planting rust-resistant pea varieties is the most effective and economical control method. Consult with HAU for recommended varieties for Haryana.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting peas in the same field for at least 2-3 years. Rotate with non-leguminous crops to break the disease cycle.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest. This reduces the inoculum for the next season.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to improve air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce humidity and fungal growth.
*   **Balanced Fertilization:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, as it can promote lush vegetative growth that is more susceptible to disease. Use balanced NPK application based on soil test recommendations.
*   **Early Sowing:** Sowing peas early can sometimes help the crop escape the peak period of rust development, especially if the later part of the season is prone to cool, moist conditions.

**2. Chemical Control (Fungicides):**

Fungicides should be applied preventively or at the first appearance of symptoms, especially if weather conditions are favorable for disease development. Always ensure thorough coverage of the foliage. Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

The following CIBRC approved technical chemical names are recommended for rust control in pulse crops like peas:

*   **Mancozeb 75% WP:**
    *   Apply at a rate of **2.0 - 2.5 kg/acre** mixed in 500-750 litres of water.
    *   This is a contact fungicide, effective as a preventive spray.
*   **Propiconazole 25% EC:**
    *   Apply at a rate of **200 - 250 ml/acre** mixed in 200-400 litres of water.
    *   This is a systemic fungicide, effective in both preventive and curative action.
*   **Tebuconazole 25.9% EC (or 250 EC):**
    *   Apply at a rate of **200 - 250 ml/acre** mixed in 200-400 litres of water.
    *   This is also a systemic fungicide with good efficacy against rusts.
*   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:**
    *   Apply at a rate of **200 ml/acre** mixed in 200-400 litres of water.
    *   This is a systemic fungicide with broad-spectrum activity, including rusts.

**Important Considerations for Chemical Application:**

*   **Timing:** Initiate spraying when the first rust pustules are observed, or if weather forecasts predict prolonged periods of cool, moist conditions.
*   **Frequency:** Depending on disease severity and weather, repeat applications may be necessary at 10-15 day intervals. Always adhere to the label instructions regarding the maximum number of sprays and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   **Adjuvants:** Consider adding a suitable spreading/sticking agent (adjuvant) to the spray solution to improve coverage and efficacy, especially on waxy leaf surfaces.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and application. Follow all safety instructions and disposal guidelines on the product label.
