As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling soil pests like termites and root-knot nematodes in peas in Haryana:

Both termites and root-knot nematodes are significant soil pests that can severely impact pea cultivation, leading to stunted growth, wilting, reduced yield, and even plant death. An integrated pest management (IPM) approach, combining cultural practices with judicious use of CIBRC-approved chemicals, is recommended.

### 1. Control of Termites in Peas

Termites damage roots and the base of the stem, especially in dry conditions, leading to wilting and plant mortality.

**A. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove all crop residues, stubble, and woody debris from the field before sowing, as these can serve as food sources and breeding sites for termites.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** Ploughing the field deeply during summer exposes termite colonies to sunlight and predators, reducing their population.
*   **Proper Irrigation:** Maintain adequate soil moisture, as termites are more active and damaging in dry soil conditions.
*   **Organic Matter:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost, as it improves soil health and can indirectly deter termites.

**B. Chemical Control (Pre-sowing/Sowing Application):**
For effective control, chemical application should be done before or at the time of sowing.

*   **Soil Drench/Broadcast Application:**
    *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC**: Apply 4-5 litres per acre, mixed with 200-400 litres of water and drenched into the soil, or mixed with 20-25 kg of sand and broadcast evenly before the last ploughing and incorporation into the soil.
    *   **Fipronil 0.3% GR**: Apply 6-8 kg per acre, broadcast evenly and incorporated into the soil at the time of sowing.

### 2. Control of Nematodes (Root-knot) in Peas

Root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.) are a major problem for peas, causing characteristic galls or swellings on the roots, leading to poor nutrient and water uptake, stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, and significant yield reduction.

**A. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops such as cereals (wheat, maize, sorghum) for at least 2-3 years. Avoid continuous cultivation of susceptible crops like peas, tomatoes, brinjal, okra, etc.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available, use pea varieties known to have resistance or tolerance to root-knot nematodes.
*   **Solarization:** During hot summer months, cover the moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks. This raises soil temperature to lethal levels for nematodes.
*   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporate neem cake at 200-400 kg per acre into the soil 2-3 weeks before sowing. Neem cake releases compounds that are toxic to nematodes and also promotes beneficial soil microbes.
*   **Summer Ploughing:** Deep ploughing during summer exposes nematode eggs and larvae to heat and desiccation.

**B. Chemical Control (At Sowing Application):**
Chemical nematicides can provide effective control when applied at sowing.

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   **Carbofuran 3% GR**: Apply 10-12 kg per acre, in furrows at the time of sowing and immediately cover with soil. This provides systemic protection to the young seedlings.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully, including dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Consult your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for the most current and specific recommendations for your farm conditions.
*   Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is key for sustainable pest control.
