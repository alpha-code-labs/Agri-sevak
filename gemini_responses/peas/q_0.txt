As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I will provide scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Peas, keeping in mind the specific conditions and approved practices for Haryana, India.

Here's how to control the mentioned fungal diseases in Peas:

### General Principles for Fungal Disease Management in Peas:

*   **Integrated Pest Management (IPM):** Combine cultural, biological, and chemical methods for sustainable control.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Whenever possible, choose pea varieties known to be resistant or tolerant to common fungal diseases in your region.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice a 2-3 year crop rotation with non-host crops to reduce inoculum build-up in the soil.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest.
*   **Seed Treatment:** Use treated seeds to prevent seed-borne diseases and early seedling infections.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to improve air circulation and reduce humidity, which discourages fungal growth.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can promote lush growth susceptible to certain diseases.

### Specific Disease Control Measures:

1.  **Alternaria Leaf Spot/Blight (e.g., *Alternaria alternata*)**
    *   **Cultural Practices:** Use disease-free seeds, practice crop rotation, and remove infected plant debris.
    *   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
        *   **Mancozeb** 2.5 kg/acre
        *   **Chlorothalonil** 2 kg/acre
        *   **Azoxystrobin** 200 ml/acre

2.  **Anthracnose (*Colletotrichum pisi*)**
    *   **Cultural Practices:** Use certified disease-free seeds, practice strict crop rotation (at least 3 years), and ensure good field sanitation.
    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   **Seed Treatment:**
            *   **Carbendazim** 2 g/kg seed
            *   **Thiram** 2.5 g/kg seed
        *   **Foliar Spray (if disease appears):**
            *   **Carbendazim** 500 g/acre
            *   **Mancozeb** 2.5 kg/acre

3.  **Blast**
    *   This is not known to affect Peas.

4.  **Blight (e.g., Ascochyta Blight complex: *Didymella pinodes*, *Phoma medicaginis* var. *pinodella*, *Peyronellaea pinodella*)**
    *   **Cultural Practices:** Use certified disease-free seeds, practice a minimum 3-year crop rotation, deep ploughing of crop residues, and avoid overhead irrigation.
    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   **Seed Treatment:**
            *   **Thiram** 2.5 g/kg seed + **Carbendazim** 1 g/kg seed
        *   **Foliar Spray (at first sign of disease):**
            *   **Mancozeb** 2.5 kg/acre
            *   **Chlorothalonil** 2 kg/acre
            *   **Azoxystrobin** 200 ml/acre

5.  **Brown Spot**
    *   Brown spot symptoms in peas are often caused by pathogens like *Alternaria* species or components of the *Ascochyta* blight complex. Therefore, the control measures recommended for **Alternaria Leaf Spot/Blight** and **Blight** (Ascochyta) should be effective.

6.  **Downy Mildew (*Peronospora viciae* f.sp. *pisi*)**
    *   **Cultural Practices:** Use resistant varieties, ensure good field drainage, avoid dense planting, and practice crop rotation.
    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   **Seed Treatment:**
            *   **Metalaxyl-M** 35% WS @ 6 g/kg seed (if approved and available for peas in Haryana)
        *   **Foliar Spray (preventive or at early stages):**
            *   **Mancozeb** 2.5 kg/acre (protectant)
            *   **Metalaxyl-M + Mancozeb** (pre-mix) 1 kg/acre
            *   **Dimethomorph + Mancozeb** (pre-mix) 1 kg/acre

7.  **Powdery Mildew (*Erysiphe pisi*)**
    *   **Cultural Practices:** Plant resistant varieties, ensure proper plant spacing for good air circulation, and avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization.
    *   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray, at first appearance of white powdery patches):**
        *   **Wettable Sulphur** 2.5 kg/acre (effective in early stages and as a preventive)
        *   **Myclobutanil** 200 ml/acre
        *   **Azoxystrobin** 200 ml/acre
        *   **Propiconazole** 200 ml/acre

8.  **Grey Mildew**
    *   This is not known to affect Peas. (Note: Grey mould caused by *Botrytis cinerea* is a different disease and is known to affect peas, but "Grey mildew" is not a recognized disease name for peas).

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the fungicide label for correct dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in pathogens.
*   Consult your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for the most current recommendations and specific variety information for your area in Haryana.
