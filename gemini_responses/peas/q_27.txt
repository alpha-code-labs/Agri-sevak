As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the suitable climate, soil type, and drainage requirements for peas (Matar) in Haryana:

### Suitable Climate for Peas

Peas are a cool-season crop and thrive in moderate temperatures. They are typically grown as a Rabi crop in Haryana.

*   **Temperature:**
    *   **Germination:** Optimal temperature for germination is between 15-20°C.
    *   **Vegetative Growth:** Ideal temperatures for vegetative growth range from 10-18°C.
    *   **Pod Development and Maturity:** Temperatures between 15-20°C are best for pod formation and filling. Higher temperatures (above 25-30°C) during flowering and pod development can lead to flower drop, poor pod set, and reduced yield and quality.
*   **Frost:** Young pea plants can tolerate mild frost, but severe frost, especially during flowering and pod development, can cause significant damage to flowers and developing pods.
*   **Humidity:** Moderate humidity is generally favorable. High humidity combined with warm temperatures can increase the risk of fungal diseases.

### Suitable Soil Type for Peas

Peas can be grown on a variety of soils, but they perform best in well-drained, fertile soils.

*   **Texture:** Loamy to sandy loam soils are ideal. These soils provide good aeration and drainage while retaining sufficient moisture. Heavy clay soils are generally unsuitable due to poor drainage and aeration.
*   **pH:** A soil pH range of 6.0 to 7.5 is considered optimal for pea cultivation. Slightly acidic to neutral soils are preferred.
*   **Organic Matter:** Soils rich in organic matter are highly beneficial as they improve soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability.
*   **Salinity:** Peas are sensitive to saline and alkaline soils, which can negatively impact germination and plant growth.

### Drainage Requirement for Peas

Good drainage is critically important for pea cultivation.

*   **Sensitivity to Waterlogging:** Peas are highly sensitive to waterlogging. Standing water or prolonged saturated soil conditions can lead to:
    *   **Root Rot:** Anaerobic conditions promote the growth of root rot pathogens, leading to wilting and plant death.
    *   **Nutrient Deficiency:** Waterlogging impairs root respiration and nutrient uptake.
    *   **Stunted Growth:** Overall plant growth is severely hampered.
*   **Requirement:** The soil must have excellent internal drainage to prevent water accumulation around the root zone, especially after irrigation or rainfall. Fields with a slight slope are often preferred to facilitate surface drainage. In areas prone to waterlogging, raised beds or ridges can be beneficial.
