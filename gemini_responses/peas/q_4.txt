Wilt, including Fusarium wilt, and Parawilt are significant concerns for pea cultivation in Haryana. An integrated disease management approach is crucial for effective control.

### Control Measures for Wilt (Fusarium Wilt) in Peas

Wilt in peas is primarily caused by the fungus *Fusarium oxysporum* f. sp. *pisi*.

1.  **Resistant Varieties:**
    *   Cultivate resistant or tolerant pea varieties recommended for Haryana. Consult your local Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or HAU extension services for the latest recommendations.

2.  **Crop Rotation:**
    *   Practice a long crop rotation of at least 3-4 years with non-host crops (e.g., cereals like wheat, maize, or pearl millet) to reduce soil-borne inoculum. Avoid planting peas or other susceptible legumes in the same field consecutively.

3.  **Seed Treatment:**
    *   Treat pea seeds before sowing with recommended fungicides or bio-fungicides to protect against early infection.
        *   **Chemical Seed Treatment:**
            *   Apply **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 2 grams per kg of seed.
            *   Alternatively, apply **Thiram** 75% WS at 2.5-3 grams per kg of seed.
            *   A combination of **Carbendazim** 1 gram + **Thiram** 1.5 grams per kg of seed can also be effective.
        *   **Biological Seed Treatment:**
            *   Treat seeds with *Trichoderma viride* or *Trichoderma harzianum* formulation at 4 grams per kg of seed. This should be done after chemical treatment (if both are used) or as a standalone treatment.

4.  **Soil Application of Bio-agents:**
    *   For fields with a history of wilt, enrich the soil with beneficial microbes.
        *   Mix *Trichoderma viride* or *Trichoderma harzianum* formulation at 2.5 kg per acre with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost. Apply this mixture to the soil 7-10 days before sowing and incorporate it thoroughly.

5.  **Soil Solarization:**
    *   In small plots, soil solarization during the hot summer months (May-June) by covering the moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks can help reduce soil-borne pathogen inoculum.

### Control Measures for Parawilt in Peas

Parawilt in peas is often associated with abiotic stresses, particularly high temperatures, moisture fluctuations, and nutrient imbalances, rather than a specific pathogen.

1.  **Optimal Soil Moisture Management:**
    *   Maintain consistent and adequate soil moisture, especially during critical growth stages. Avoid both waterlogging and severe drought stress, as both can induce parawilt symptoms.
    *   Ensure proper drainage in the field to prevent water accumulation.

2.  **Balanced Nutrient Management:**
    *   Ensure balanced fertilization based on soil test recommendations. Pay particular attention to potassium (K) levels, as potassium deficiency can exacerbate wilting symptoms.
    *   If potassium deficiency is suspected, apply potassium fertilizers as per soil test recommendations. Foliar application of 1% potassium nitrate or sulphate of potash can be considered if symptoms appear.

3.  **Mulching:**
    *   Apply organic mulch (e.g., straw, crop residues) around pea plants to help conserve soil moisture, regulate soil temperature, and reduce temperature fluctuations, thereby minimizing stress on plants.

4.  **Timely Sowing:**
    *   Sow peas at the optimal time to avoid exposure to extreme temperatures during sensitive growth phases. Consult HAU recommendations for the ideal sowing window in your specific region of Haryana.

5.  **Deep Ploughing:**
    *   If hardpans are present in the soil, deep ploughing can improve soil structure, root penetration, and water infiltration, which can help alleviate stress conditions contributing to parawilt.

By implementing these integrated strategies, pea growers in Haryana can effectively manage both fungal wilt and parawilt, leading to healthier crops and improved yields.
