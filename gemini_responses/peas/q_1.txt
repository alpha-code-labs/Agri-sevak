This is not known to affect Peas.

Smut diseases (Black, False, Kernel, and Loose smut) are primarily diseases of cereal crops (such as wheat, barley, oats, maize, and sorghum) and some grasses. Peas (Pisum sativum) are legumes and are not typically affected by these types of smut fungi. Peas are susceptible to other fungal diseases like powdery mildew, downy mildew, rust, and various blights, but not smuts.
