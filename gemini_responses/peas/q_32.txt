The symptom of "drying up" (drying branches, leaves, fruits, and flowers) in peas is a general indication of stress, which can be caused by a variety of factors, both abiotic (environmental) and biotic (diseases and pests). As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I advise a systematic approach to identify the root cause for effective management.

**I. Diagnosis is Key:**
Before applying any treatment, it is crucial to accurately identify the cause. Observe the pattern of drying, presence of spots, lesions, insect damage, root health, and overall field conditions.

**II. Common Causes and Management Strategies for Drying Up in Peas:**

**A. Abiotic Stresses (Non-Infectious Causes):**

1.  **Water Stress:**
    *   **Drought (Insufficient Water):** Plants wilt and dry up due to lack of moisture.
        *   **Management:** Ensure timely and adequate irrigation, especially during critical growth stages (flowering and pod development).
    *   **Waterlogging (Excess Water):** Can lead to root suffocation and root rot, causing wilting and drying of aerial parts.
        *   **Management:** Improve field drainage. Avoid irrigation in waterlogged areas. Consider raised bed planting in problematic fields.

2.  **Nutrient Deficiencies:**
    *   Severe deficiencies of certain nutrients (e.g., Potassium, Phosphorus, or Micronutrients) can lead to yellowing, scorching, and eventual drying of leaves.
        *   **Management:** Conduct soil testing to identify specific deficiencies. Apply balanced fertilizers as per recommendations. Foliar sprays of micronutrients can provide quick relief.

3.  **Heat Stress:**
    *   Sudden rise in temperature, especially during flowering and pod development, can cause flower drop, pod abortion, and drying of plant parts.
        *   **Management:** Opt for early sowing to avoid late-season heat stress. Choose heat-tolerant varieties if available. Light irrigation during hot periods can help cool the canopy.

4.  **Frost Damage:**
    *   In severe winter conditions, frost can damage tender plant parts, leading to water-soaked appearance followed by drying and blackening.
        *   **Management:** Provide light irrigation before frost events. Create smoke cover in the evening using farm waste.

**B. Biotic Stresses (Infectious Causes - Diseases and Pests):**

1.  **Fungal Diseases:**
    *   **Fusarium Wilt (Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. pisi):** A common and serious disease. Plants show yellowing of lower leaves, followed by wilting and drying of the entire plant, often from one side. Vascular tissues (stem cross-section) may show brownish discoloration.
        *   **Management:**
            *   Use resistant varieties.
            *   Practice crop rotation (avoid peas or other susceptible crops for 3-4 years).
            *   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds with **Carbendazim** @ 2 g/kg seed or **Thiram** @ 2.5 g/kg seed.
    *   **Root Rots (Pythium, Rhizoctonia, Phytophthora):** Affect roots and collar region, leading to yellowing, stunting, wilting, and eventual drying of the plant. Roots appear discolored and rotted.
        *   **Management:**
            *   Ensure good drainage.
            *   Practice crop rotation.
            *   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds with **Metalaxyl + Mancozeb** (e.g., Apron Plus) @ 2.5 g/kg seed or **Captan** @ 2.5 g/kg seed.
    *   **Ascochyta Blight (Ascochyta pisi):** Causes purplish-brown spots on leaves, stems, and pods. Severe infection can lead to defoliation and drying of affected parts.
        *   **Management:**
            *   Use disease-free seeds.
            *   Practice crop rotation.
            *   **Foliar Spray:** Spray with **Mancozeb** @ 2.5 g/L water or **Chlorothalonil** @ 2 g/L water at the appearance of symptoms and repeat after 10-15 days if necessary.
    *   **Powdery Mildew (Erysiphe pisi):** Characterized by white powdery patches on leaves, stems, and pods. Severely infected leaves turn yellow, dry up, and shed prematurely.
        *   **Management:**
            *   Use resistant varieties.
            *   **Foliar Spray:** Spray with **Wettable Sulphur** @ 2-3 g/L water or **Azoxystrobin** @ 0.5 ml/L water or **Tebuconazole** @ 0.75 ml/L water at the first sign of disease. Repeat after 10-15 days.
    *   **Rust (Uromyces viciae-fabae):** Appears as reddish-brown pustules on leaves, stems, and pods. Severe infection can lead to premature yellowing and drying of leaves.
        *   **Management:**
            *   Use resistant varieties.
            *   **Foliar Spray:** Spray with **Mancozeb** @ 2.5 g/L water or **Propiconazole** @ 0.5 ml/L water at the appearance of symptoms.

2.  **Insect Pests:**
    *   **Aphids (Aphis craccivora):** Small, soft-bodied insects that suck sap from tender shoots, leaves, and pods. Heavy infestation can lead to curling, yellowing, wilting, and drying of affected parts. They also excrete honeydew, leading to sooty mold.
        *   **Management:**
            *   **Foliar Spray:** Spray with **Imidacloprid** @ 0.3 ml/L water or **Thiamethoxam** @ 0.25 g/L water.
    *   **Thrips (Frankliniella schultzei):** Tiny insects that rasp and suck sap, causing silvery streaks, distortion, and drying of leaves and flowers.
        *   **Management:**
            *   **Foliar Spray:** Spray with **Imidacloprid** @ 0.3 ml/L water or **Thiamethoxam** @ 0.25 g/L water.
    *   **Pod Borers (Helicoverpa armigera, Maruca vitrata):** Larvae bore into pods and feed on developing seeds. Damaged pods may dry prematurely or become susceptible to secondary infections.
        *   **Management:**
            *   **Foliar Spray:** Spray with **Emamectin benzoate** @ 0.5 g/L water or **Chlorantraniliprole** @ 0.3 ml/L water at pod formation stage.

**III. General Recommendations:**

*   **Integrated Disease and Pest Management (IDPM):** Always combine cultural practices (crop rotation, resistant varieties, proper sanitation) with chemical control for sustainable management.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris to reduce inoculum.
*   **Certified Seeds:** Always use certified, disease-free seeds.
*   **Read Labels:** Always read and follow the instructions on the chemical product label for correct dosage, application method, and safety precautions.

If the exact cause remains unclear, it is highly recommended to bring a sample of the affected plant to the Plant Pathology or Entomology Department at HAU, Hisar, for precise diagnosis and specific recommendations.
