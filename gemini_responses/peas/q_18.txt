As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the use of growth regulators and micronutrients in Peas for Haryana conditions.

It is crucial to understand the specific role and impact of each compound on the pea crop.

*   **Ethrel (Ethephon)**
    *   **Purpose:** Ethephon is a plant growth regulator that releases ethylene, promoting flowering, pod development, and sometimes uniform maturity. It can be used to enhance yield in peas.
    *   **Recommended Dose (Foliar Application):**
        *   Apply **Ethephon** (39% SL formulation) at a concentration of 0.25 - 0.5 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Timing:** Apply at the pre-flowering stage (when the first flowers start to appear) or early pod development stage. Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.

*   **2,4-D**
    *   **Purpose:** 2,4-D is primarily a selective broadleaf herbicide. While it can act as a growth regulator at extremely low concentrations, its application at typical agricultural doses is highly phytotoxic to dicotyledonous plants like peas.
    *   **Recommendation:** **2,4-D is NOT recommended as a growth regulator for Peas.** Applying 2,4-D to pea crops will cause severe damage, malformation, or death of the plants, as peas are highly susceptible to this herbicide.

*   **Boron**
    *   **Purpose:** Boron is an essential micronutrient vital for pollen germination, flower fertilization, pod setting, cell wall formation, and sugar transport. Boron deficiency can lead to poor pod development, reduced seed set, and lower yields.
    *   **Recommended Dose (Foliar Application):**
        *   Apply **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (e.g., 20% Boron) at a concentration of 1.0 - 1.5 grams per litre of water.
        *   **Timing:** Apply at the pre-flowering stage and/or early pod development stage, especially if boron deficiency symptoms are observed or suspected based on soil tests.
    *   **Note:** For soil application, if soil tests indicate severe deficiency, apply **Borax** (10.5% Boron) at 10-15 kg per acre as a basal dose before sowing, or **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (20% Boron) at 1-2 kg per acre. Foliar application is generally preferred for quick correction and efficient uptake in standing crops.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the manufacturer's instructions on the product label.
*   Ensure proper calibration of spray equipment for uniform application.
*   Avoid spraying during hot periods of the day or when rain is expected shortly after application.
*   For any specific field conditions or severe deficiency symptoms, it is advisable to consult with local agricultural extension officers or HAU experts.
