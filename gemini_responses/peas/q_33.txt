As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an integrated approach combining cultural practices and judicious use of CIBRC-approved herbicides for effective weed control in peas.

**Integrated Weed Management (IWM) Principles:**

1.  **Clean Seed:** Use certified, weed-free pea seeds to prevent introduction of new weed species.
2.  **Timely Sowing:** Sow peas at the optimal time to allow the crop to establish a competitive advantage over weeds.
3.  **Proper Seedbed Preparation:** Good tillage can reduce the initial weed flush.
4.  **Crop Rotation:** Rotate peas with non-leguminous crops to break the life cycle of specific weeds.
5.  **Hand Weeding:** One to two hand weedings at 30-45 days after sowing (DAS) are highly effective, especially for parasitic weeds and dense weed populations.

**Chemical Control Measures:**

Herbicides can be applied either pre-emergence (before weed and crop emergence) or post-emergence (after weed and crop emergence). Always ensure adequate soil moisture at the time of application for optimal efficacy.

**A. Pre-emergence Herbicides (Apply within 1-3 days after sowing):**
These herbicides are effective against a wide range of broadleaf and narrowleaf weeds, including Bathu, Congress grass, and Phalaris minor.

*   **For Broadleaf and Narrowleaf Weeds:**
    *   **Pendimethalin** 30% EC: Apply 1.0 kg a.i./acre (approximately 3.3 litres of product/acre) in 200-300 litres of water.
    *   **Fluchloralin** 45% EC: Apply 0.9 kg a.i./acre (approximately 2.0 litres of product/acre) in 200-300 litres of water. This can also be applied as a pre-plant incorporation (PPI) before sowing.

**B. Post-emergence Herbicides (Apply when weeds are at 2-4 leaf stage and peas are at 2-4 true leaf stage, typically 20-35 DAS):**

*   **For Broadleaf Weeds (e.g., Bathu, Congress grass):**
    *   **Bentazone** 48% SL: Apply 0.5-0.75 kg a.i./acre (approximately 1.0-1.5 litres of product/acre) in 200-300 litres of water. Ensure peas are at least 3-4 true leaf stage.
    *   **Imazethapyr** 10% SL: Apply 75-100 g a.i./acre (approximately 750-1000 ml of product/acre) in 200-300 litres of water. This herbicide provides control of a broad spectrum of broadleaf weeds and some grasses. *Caution: Peas can be sensitive; use the lower recommended dose and ensure proper crop stage.*

*   **For Narrowleaf Weeds (Grasses, e.g., Phalaris minor):**
    *   **Quizalofop-ethyl** 5% EC: Apply 50-75 g a.i./acre (approximately 1.0-1.5 litres of product/acre) in 200-300 litres of water.
    *   **Fenoxaprop-p-ethyl** 9% EC: Apply 45-60 g a.i./acre (approximately 500-660 ml of product/acre) in 200-300 litres of water.

**Specific Weed Control:**

*   **Amarbail (Cuscuta spp.):**
    *   Amarbail is a parasitic weed. Chemical control in standing pea crops is very challenging without harming the crop.
    *   **Prevention is key:** Use clean, certified seeds. Avoid using fodder or manure contaminated with Cuscuta seeds.
    *   **Manual Removal:** If infestation is localized, manually remove and destroy affected pea plants along with the Cuscuta strands before it sets seed.
    *   **Pre-emergence:** **Pendimethalin** can offer some suppression of Cuscuta germination if applied correctly, but it is not a complete solution.

*   **Orobanche (Broomrape):**
    *   While some species of *Orobanche* (e.g., *Orobanche crenata*) are known to parasitize peas in certain regions, it is **not a common or significant weed problem in peas in Haryana.** Therefore, specific chemical control recommendations for *Orobanche* in peas are generally not provided or necessary in this region.

**General Recommendations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the herbicide label carefully.
*   Use the recommended water volume (200-300 litres/acre) for uniform spray coverage.
*   Ensure proper calibration of spray equipment.
*   Avoid herbicide drift to non-target crops.
*   Rotate herbicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of herbicide resistance.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension specialist for specific advice tailored to your farm's conditions and prevailing weed flora.
