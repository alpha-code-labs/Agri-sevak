Scale insects and Mealybugs are significant sucking pests that can affect pea crops, especially under favorable conditions. Effective management requires an integrated approach.

Here's how to control them in peas:

**I. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Practices:**

1.  **Regular Scouting:** Frequently inspect your pea plants, especially the undersides of leaves, stems, and growing points, for early signs of infestation.
2.  **Manual Removal:** For small infestations, manually remove and destroy infested plant parts or gently wipe off the pests using a cloth dipped in soapy water.
3.  **Pruning:** Remove and destroy severely infested plant parts to reduce pest population and prevent spread.
4.  **Biological Control:** Encourage natural enemies like ladybird beetles (coccinellids) and parasitic wasps, which prey on scale insects and mealybugs. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.
5.  **Field Sanitation:** Remove crop residues and weeds, which can harbor pests, from around the pea field.
6.  **Proper Nutrition and Irrigation:** Maintain healthy plant vigor through balanced fertilization and appropriate irrigation, as stressed plants are more susceptible to pest attacks.

**II. Chemical Control (When infestation is severe):**

When pest populations are high and causing significant damage, chemical intervention may be necessary. Due to the waxy coating of these pests, systemic insecticides are often more effective, or contact insecticides with good coverage. Always ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and stems.

Please use the following CIBRC approved technical chemical names and dosages:

*   **For Scale Insects and Mealybugs:**
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at 500-600 ml per acre (or 1.0-1.2 ml per litre of water). This is an Insect Growth Regulator (IGR) that disrupts molting, primarily effective against nymphs.
    *   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:** Apply at 200-250 ml per acre (or 0.4-0.5 ml per litre of water). This is a systemic insecticide with excellent efficacy against sucking pests, including scales and mealybugs, moving both upwards and downwards in the plant.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at 100-125 g per acre (or 0.2-0.25 g per litre of water). This is a systemic insecticide effective against a range of sucking pests.
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply at 80-100 g per acre (or 0.16-0.2 g per litre of water). This is another systemic insecticide effective against sucking pests.
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at 100-125 ml per acre (or 0.2-0.25 ml per litre of water). This is a systemic insecticide widely used for sucking pests.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Rotation of Chemicals:** To prevent the development of pesticide resistance, rotate insecticides with different modes of action. Do not use the same chemical repeatedly.
*   **Adjuvants:** Consider adding a non-ionic spreader/sticker to the spray solution to improve coverage and penetration, especially for pests with waxy coatings.
*   **Safety Precautions:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, and protective clothing while handling and spraying chemicals. Follow the instructions on the product label carefully regarding dosage, application method, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   **Timing of Application:** Apply insecticides when the pest population is manageable and before it causes severe damage. Early morning or late evening hours are ideal for spraying to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
