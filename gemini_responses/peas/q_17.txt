As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend the following doses for organic manures in Peas, based on scientific verification for Haryana conditions:

*   **Farmyard Manure (FYM):**
    *   Apply 10-15 tonnes/acre of well-decomposed FYM.
    *   Incorporate it thoroughly into the soil 2-3 weeks before sowing. This allows for proper decomposition and nutrient release.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   Apply 2-3 tonnes/acre.
    *   Incorporate it into the soil during field preparation or at the time of sowing. Vermicompost provides readily available nutrients and improves soil structure.

*   **Sagarika:**
    *   **Sagarika** is a seaweed extract-based biostimulant, not a bulk organic manure like FYM or vermicompost. It primarily enhances plant growth, nutrient uptake, and stress tolerance.
    *   **Foliar Application:** Mix 2.5-5 ml of **Sagarika** per litre of water and spray at critical growth stages such as branching, pre-flowering, and pod development. Typically, 500 ml - 1 L per acre per spray.
    *   **Soil Application (Drench/Fertigation):** Apply 1-2 L of **Sagarika** per acre, mixed with irrigation water or as a drench, especially during early growth stages or when nutrient uptake needs a boost.
