As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies in Peas in Haryana:

### Control of Beetles and Weevils in Peas

Beetles and Weevils can cause significant damage to pea crops, from seedling stage to pod formation. The primary pests in this category affecting peas in Haryana include:

*   **Pea Leaf Weevil (Sitona lineatus):** Adults feed on leaf margins, causing characteristic notching, while larvae feed on root nodules, impacting nitrogen fixation.
*   **Blister Beetles (Mylabris spp., Epicauta spp.):** Adults feed on flowers and young pods, leading to yield loss.
*   **Flea Beetles:** Small beetles that cause shot-hole damage on young leaves, particularly problematic during early growth stages.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategy:**

**A. Cultural Practices:**
1.  **Timely Sowing:** Sowing peas at the recommended time can help plants establish well before pest populations peak.
2.  **Field Sanitation:** Remove crop residues and weeds from the field, as they can harbor pests and provide alternative food sources.
3.  **Crop Rotation:** Avoid continuous cultivation of peas or other leguminous crops in the same field to break pest life cycles.
4.  **Monitoring:** Regularly scout fields for the presence of beetles and weevils, especially during critical growth stages.

**B. Chemical Control (Upon reaching Economic Threshold Level):**

**1. Seed Treatment (for early season protection against Pea Leaf Weevil and Flea Beetles):**
*   Treat seeds before sowing with systemic insecticides to protect seedlings during the initial growth phase.
    *   **Thiamethoxam** 30% FS at 10 ml per kg of seed.
    *   **Imidacloprid** 600 FS at 5-7 ml per kg of seed.

**2. Foliar Spray (for established infestations):**
*   Apply foliar sprays when significant damage (e.g., extensive leaf notching, presence of blister beetles) is observed. Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.

    *   **For Pea Leaf Weevil and Flea Beetles:**
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 100-125 ml per acre (mixed in 200-300 litres of water).
        *   **Cypermethrin** 25% EC at 100-120 ml per acre (mixed in 200-300 litres of water).

    *   **For Blister Beetles (when observed feeding on flowers/pods):**
        *   **Malathion** 50% EC at 500 ml per acre (mixed in 200-300 litres of water).
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 100-125 ml per acre (mixed in 200-300 litres of water).

### Control of Sawflies in Peas

This is not known to affect Peas as a significant pest in Haryana, India. While some general defoliating sawflies might occasionally feed, they are not typically considered a major pest requiring specific control measures in pea cultivation in this region. Therefore, no specific chemical recommendations are provided for sawflies in peas.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) for each insecticide to ensure food safety.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension specialists for the most current and specific recommendations for your area.
