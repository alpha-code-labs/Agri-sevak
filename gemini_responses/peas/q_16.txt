As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following fertilizer doses for Peas in Haryana. Please note that these are general recommendations, and a soil test is always the most accurate way to determine precise nutrient requirements for your specific field. Peas are legumes and fix atmospheric nitrogen, so their nitrogen requirement is lower than non-leguminous crops.

**Recommended Fertilizer Doses for Peas (Basal Application at Sowing):**

The primary nutrient requirements for Peas are typically around 15-20 kg Nitrogen (N), 40-60 kg Phosphorus (P2O5), 20-30 kg Potassium (K2O), and 10-20 kg Sulphur (S) per acre. You can achieve these nutrient levels using various combinations of fertilizers:

*   **Urea:**
    *   If using **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** and **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** for P and K, apply **35-45 kg/acre** of **Urea** as a starter dose at the time of sowing. This provides approximately 16-20 kg N/acre.
*   **Nano-Urea:**
    *   **Nano-Urea** is a foliar fertilizer and should be used as a supplement, not a replacement for basal nitrogen.
    *   Apply **2-4 ml/L** of water as a foliar spray at critical growth stages (e.g., branching, pre-flowering, pod development). Typically, 1-2 sprays are recommended.
*   **DAP (Diammonium Phosphate):**
    *   **DAP** is an excellent source of both Phosphorus and a starter dose of Nitrogen.
    *   Apply **90-130 kg/acre** of **DAP** at the time of sowing. This provides approximately 16-23 kg N/acre and 41-60 kg P2O5/acre, largely fulfilling the N and P requirements. If using this dose of **DAP**, additional **Urea** may not be required.
*   **Nano-DAP:**
    *   **Nano-DAP** is a foliar fertilizer and should be used as a supplement to basal phosphorus application.
    *   Apply **2-4 ml/L** of water as a foliar spray at critical growth stages (e.g., branching, pre-flowering, pod development).
*   **NPK (Complex Fertilizers):**
    *   If using a complex NPK fertilizer like **NPK (12:32:16)**, apply **125-180 kg/acre** at the time of sowing. This provides approximately 15-22 kg N, 40-58 kg P2O5, and 20-29 kg K2O per acre. Adjust the quantity based on the specific NPK grade available and your soil test report.
*   **SSP (Single Super Phosphate):**
    *   **SSP** is a good source of Phosphorus and also provides Sulphur.
    *   If using **SSP** as the primary Phosphorus source, apply **250-375 kg/acre** at the time of sowing. This provides approximately 40-60 kg P2O5/acre and 27-41 kg Sulphur/acre.
*   **Potash (Muriate of Potash - MOP):**
    *   If not supplied through complex fertilizers like NPK, apply **35-50 kg/acre** of **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** (Potassium Chloride, 60% K2O) at the time of sowing. This provides approximately 21-30 kg K2O/acre.
*   **Sulphur:**
    *   If **SSP** is not used (which provides Sulphur), or if your soil test indicates a Sulphur deficiency, apply **10-20 kg/acre** of **Elemental Sulphur (90%)** at the time of sowing.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Soil Testing:** Always prioritize a soil test to get precise recommendations tailored to your field's nutrient status.
*   **Basal Application:** All basal fertilizers (Urea, DAP, NPK, SSP, Potash, Sulphur) should be applied at the time of sowing and thoroughly mixed into the soil.
*   **Foliar Application:** Nano-fertilizers are meant for foliar application and act as supplements to boost nutrient uptake and efficiency, especially during critical growth phases.
*   **Rhizobium Inoculation:** For optimal nitrogen fixation, ensure proper seed treatment with Rhizobium inoculant, especially if peas are being grown for the first time in the field or after a long gap.
