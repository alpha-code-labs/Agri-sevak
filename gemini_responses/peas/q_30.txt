As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I understand the importance of addressing growth issues in peas for optimal yield and quality. Here's a scientifically verified approach to manage slow growth, yellow growth, excessive height, and excessive flowering in peas, keeping in mind the conditions in Haryana:

**General Recommendation:**
The foundational step for diagnosing most growth issues is **soil testing**. This provides crucial information about nutrient levels, pH, and soil health, guiding precise management strategies. Always consult with your local HAU Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and the latest CIBRC guidelines for chemical use.

**1. Slow Growth**

*   **Causes:** Nutrient deficiencies (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, micronutrients), water stress (deficit or excess), soil compaction, low soil pH, pest/disease pressure, or sub-optimal temperatures.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Soil Testing:** Get your soil tested to identify specific nutrient deficiencies and pH issues.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Based on soil test results:
        *   Ensure adequate **Nitrogen** (initial dose, as peas fix N), **Phosphorus** (for root development and flowering), and **Potassium** (for overall plant health and stress tolerance).
        *   Address micronutrient deficiencies (e.g., Zinc, Boron) if identified.
    *   **Water Management:** Provide timely and adequate irrigation, avoiding both drought and waterlogging. Peas require consistent moisture, especially during flowering and pod development.
    *   **Soil Health:** Improve soil structure through organic matter addition (farmyard manure, compost) and proper tillage to reduce compaction and enhance drainage.
    *   **Pest and Disease Control:** Regularly scout for pests (e.g., aphids, pod borers) and diseases (e.g., powdery mildew, rust, root rot) and manage them promptly as per HAU recommendations.

**2. Yellow Growth (Chlorosis)**

*   **Causes:** Often indicates nutrient deficiencies (Nitrogen, Iron, Sulphur, Zinc), waterlogging, or disease.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Soil Testing:** Crucial to pinpoint the exact nutrient deficiency.
    *   **Nutrient Application:**
        *   **Nitrogen Deficiency:** General yellowing, especially older leaves. Apply **Urea** (e.g., 1-2% foliar spray) or top-dress if soil test indicates low N.
        *   **Iron Deficiency:** Interveinal yellowing on younger leaves. Apply **Ferrous sulphate** (0.5-1.0% solution) as a foliar spray.
        *   **Sulphur Deficiency:** General yellowing, often on younger leaves. Apply **Elemental sulphur** (20-40 kg/acre at sowing) or **Gypsum**.
        *   **Zinc Deficiency:** Stunted growth, yellowing, small leaves. Apply **Zinc sulphate** (0.5% solution) as a foliar spray or 10-15 kg/acre to soil at sowing.
    *   **Drainage:** Ensure good soil drainage to prevent waterlogging, which can cause root damage and nutrient uptake issues.
    *   **Disease Management:** If yellowing is accompanied by other symptoms (wilting, spots), it might be a disease. Consult HAU experts for diagnosis and specific management.

**3. Excessive Height (Legginess)**

*   **Causes:** High planting density, low light conditions, excessive nitrogen application, warm temperatures, or choice of a tall-growing variety.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Optimal Planting Density:** Adhere to recommended spacing (e.g., 15-20 cm row-to-row, 5-10 cm plant-to-plant) to ensure adequate light penetration and air circulation.
    *   **Adequate Light:** Ensure the crop receives full sunlight. Avoid planting in shaded areas.
    *   **Balanced Nutrition:** Avoid excessive application of **Nitrogen**, which promotes vegetative growth. Focus on balanced NPK and micronutrients.
    *   **Variety Selection:** Choose semi-dwarf or dwarf varieties suitable for your region if excessive height is a recurring issue.
    *   **Support Systems:** For taller varieties, providing support like trellising can prevent lodging, though it doesn't reduce height.
    *   **Chemicals:** This is not known to be managed by CIBRC approved chemicals for height reduction in Peas in Haryana. Cultural practices are the primary recommendation.

**4. Excessive Flowering**

*   **Causes:** While good flowering is desirable, "excessive" flowering can sometimes be a stress response (e.g., early flowering under drought) leading to poor pod set, or it could simply be a characteristic of a high-yielding variety.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Address Underlying Stress:** If excessive flowering is accompanied by poor pod set or flower drop, it often indicates stress. Ensure optimal water availability, especially during flowering and pod development.
    *   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure adequate **Phosphorus** and **Boron**, which are crucial for flower and pod development. Boron deficiency can lead to poor pollen viability and flower drop. Apply **Borax** (10-15 kg/acre to soil or 0.1-0.2% foliar spray) if deficiency is confirmed.
    *   **Temperature Management:** High temperatures during flowering can lead to flower abortion. While direct control is difficult in open fields, ensuring adequate soil moisture can help mitigate heat stress.
    *   **Pest Management:** Control flower-feeding pests that might damage flowers and reduce pod set.
