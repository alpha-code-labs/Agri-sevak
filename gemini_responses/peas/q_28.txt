Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the challenges posed by environmental stresses on pea cultivation in our region. Protecting your pea crop from extreme cold, frost, heat (Loo), and intense sunlight is crucial for ensuring good yield and quality. Here's scientifically verified advice:

**General Principles for Environmental Stress Management in Peas:**

1.  **Variety Selection:** Choose pea varieties known for their tolerance to local climatic extremes. Consult HAU recommendations for suitable varieties for Haryana.
2.  **Optimal Sowing Time:** Adhere strictly to the recommended sowing window (typically October-November for most pea varieties in Haryana) to ensure critical growth stages avoid peak stress periods like severe winter frost or late-season heat.
3.  **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure adequate and balanced nutrient supply, especially Potassium (K), which plays a vital role in improving plant resilience to various stresses by enhancing cell wall strength and regulating water movement.
4.  **Adequate Irrigation:** Maintain optimal soil moisture levels, as water stress significantly exacerbates the effects of temperature extremes.

**Specific Strategies for Different Environmental Stresses:**

**1. Extreme Cold and Frost:**
*   **Pre-Sowing Preparation:** Ensure good soil health and drainage, as waterlogged conditions can worsen cold damage.
*   **Light Irrigation:** Apply a light irrigation to the field in the evening before an anticipated frost event. Water has a higher specific heat capacity and releases latent heat slowly, which can raise the ambient temperature around the plants by a few degrees, providing protection.
*   **Mulching:** For smaller areas or high-value crops, apply a layer of organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves) around the base of plants to insulate the soil and protect roots from extreme cold.
*   **Foliar Sprays:**
    *   Spray with **Potassium Nitrate** (1-2% solution, i.e., 10-20 g/L water) before the onset of severe cold or frost. Potassium helps in maintaining cell turgor, regulating stomatal movement, and improving cold hardiness.
    *   Consider foliar application of **Glycine Betaine** (100-200 g/acre, dissolved in appropriate water volume as per product label) which acts as an osmoprotectant, helping plant cells cope with freezing temperatures and maintain metabolic activity.
    *   Amino acid-based formulations can also enhance plant vigor and stress tolerance, aiding recovery from cold shock.

**2. Heat (Loo) and Intense Sunlight:**
*   **Timely Sowing:** Ensure the crop completes its flowering and pod development stages before the onset of severe summer heat (Loo) in late March/April.
*   **Adequate Irrigation:** Provide regular and sufficient irrigation, especially during flowering and pod development, to mitigate heat stress and maintain plant turgor. Avoid water stress, as it makes plants more susceptible to heat damage.
*   **Mulching:** Apply organic mulch to conserve soil moisture, reduce soil temperature, and suppress weed growth, all of which help the plant cope with heat.
*   **Foliar Sprays:**
    *   Spray with **Kaolin Clay** (5-7 kg/acre, mixed in 200-250 L water) as a 5% solution. Kaolin forms a white reflective film on leaves, reducing leaf temperature by reflecting sunlight and decreasing transpiration, thus protecting against heat and sunscald.
    *   Foliar application of **Potassium Nitrate** (1-2% solution) can also help improve heat tolerance by enhancing water use efficiency and maintaining cell turgor.
    *   **Glycine Betaine** (100-200 g/acre) can be beneficial in improving the plant's ability to withstand high temperatures by stabilizing cellular structures and enzymes.
    *   Amino acid-based formulations can help plants recover from heat stress and maintain metabolic activity, promoting faster recovery and growth.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label for dosage, application timing, and safety precautions.
*   Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage during foliar applications for maximum effectiveness.
*   Consult your local Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or HAU extension specialist for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and the latest approved products.

By adopting these scientifically proven practices, you can significantly reduce the impact of environmental stresses on your pea crop and achieve better yields.

Jai Kisan!
