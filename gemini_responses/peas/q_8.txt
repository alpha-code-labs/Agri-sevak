Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I will provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling sucking pests in Peas.

First, regarding Psylla:
This is not known to affect Peas.

For the control of Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips in Peas, an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is highly recommended, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods.

**I. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Early Sowing:** Sowing peas early can help escape the peak infestation period of some sucking pests.
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the field free of weeds, as many weeds act as alternate hosts for these pests.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush growth, making plants more attractive to sucking pests.
    *   **Water Management:** Ensure proper irrigation to avoid plant stress, which can make them more susceptible.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Protect beneficial insects like ladybird beetles, lacewings, hoverfly larvae, and parasitic wasps, which naturally prey on or parasitize aphids and other sucking pests. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides if natural enemy populations are high.
    *   **Bird Perches:** Install bird perches in the field to encourage predatory birds.

3.  **Mechanical Control:**
    *   **Yellow Sticky Traps:** Install yellow sticky traps (10-15 traps per acre) to monitor and mass trap adult whiteflies, leafhoppers, and thrips.

**II. Chemical Control (When pest populations reach economic threshold):**

When pest populations are high and causing significant damage, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the underside of leaves where many sucking pests reside. Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

Here are some CIBRC approved technical chemical options for sucking pests in Peas:

*   **For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips:**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** 125-150 ml per acre
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** 40-50 g per acre
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** 80-100 g per acre
    *   **Diafenthiuron 50% WP:** 250 g per acre (Effective against whiteflies and thrips)
    *   **Dimethoate 30% EC:** 500 ml per acre (Effective against aphids and thrips)

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Water Volume:** Always mix the recommended dose of insecticide in 200-250 litres of water per acre for effective coverage.
*   **Timing of Application:** Apply insecticides at the first sign of pest infestation or when pest populations reach economic threshold levels.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always check the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) mentioned on the insecticide label and adhere to it strictly to ensure the safety of the produce.
*   **Safety Precautions:** Always wear protective clothing (gloves, mask, goggles) while handling and spraying pesticides. Wash hands and exposed body parts thoroughly after spraying.
