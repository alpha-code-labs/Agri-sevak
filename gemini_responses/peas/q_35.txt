As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with the scientifically verified advice regarding the maturity signs, harvesting time, and cutting process for peas (green peas) in Haryana.

### Maturity Signs for Green Peas

Identifying the correct maturity stage is crucial for optimal taste, tenderness, and yield. Look for the following signs:

*   **Pod Appearance:** The pods should be plump, well-filled, and firm to the touch. They should have a bright, vibrant green colour. Avoid pods that are yellowing, shrivelled, or have a dull appearance, as these indicate over-maturity or stress.
*   **Pea Development:** Gently open a few sample pods. The peas inside should be fully developed, round, and fill the pod cavity without being overly crowded or flattened.
*   **Tenderness and Taste:** The most reliable indicator is to taste a few raw peas. They should be tender, sweet, and succulent, with a crisp texture. If they taste starchy, hard, or lack sweetness, they are likely over-mature.
*   **Pod Pliability:** While firm, the pods should still be somewhat pliable and not tough or leathery.

### Harvesting Time for Green Peas

The optimal harvesting time for green peas depends on the variety and the intended use (fresh market, processing).

*   **Timing after Sowing:** Harvesting typically begins when the first pods reach the optimal maturity stage, usually around 60-80 days after sowing, depending on the specific variety and prevailing weather conditions in Haryana.
*   **Multiple Pickings:** For fresh market consumption, peas are often harvested in multiple pickings. As pods mature sequentially on the plant, you can expect to harvest every 2-4 days over a period of 10-15 days. This ensures that only peas at their peak tenderness and sweetness are collected.
*   **Time of Day:** Harvesting should ideally be done in the cooler parts of the day, such as early morning or late evening. This helps to maintain the quality, sweetness, and extends the shelf life of the harvested peas.
*   **Timeliness:** Prompt harvesting is critical. Delaying harvest by even a few days can lead to peas becoming starchy, less sweet, and tough, significantly reducing their market value and palatability.

### Cutting Process (Harvesting Method) for Green Peas

The harvesting method largely depends on the scale of cultivation and the intended market.

*   **Manual Picking (for Fresh Market):**
    *   This is the most common method for small to medium-scale growers in Haryana, especially for peas destined for the fresh market.
    *   Carefully select and pick only the mature pods that exhibit the signs mentioned above.
    *   Gently twist or snap the stem of the pod where it attaches to the plant. Avoid pulling the pod directly, as this can damage the plant and reduce subsequent yields from remaining flowers and pods.
    *   Ensure the plant itself is not damaged during picking, allowing it to continue producing more pods for subsequent harvests.
    *   Collect the harvested pods in clean baskets or crates, taking care not to bruise them.
*   **Mechanical Harvesting (for Processing/Vining Peas):**
    *   For large-scale cultivation, particularly for peas destined for processing (e.g., frozen peas), mechanical harvesters (viners) are used.
    *   These machines cut the entire pea plant and then separate the peas from the pods and plant material. This method is typically a single-pass harvest when the majority of the crop reaches the desired maturity for processing. This is less common for fresh market peas in Haryana.
