Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing these physical damages in Peas, keeping in mind the conditions in Haryana.

### 1. Fruit Bursting (Pod Bursting/Splitting) in Peas

This is a physiological disorder primarily caused by rapid fluctuations in moisture availability and can be exacerbated by nutrient imbalances.

*   **Causes:**
    *   **Moisture Imbalance:** A dry spell followed by sudden heavy rain or irrigation leads to rapid water uptake, causing internal pressure to exceed the pod's elasticity.
    *   **Nutrient Deficiencies:** Lack of Boron or Calcium can weaken pod walls, making them more susceptible to splitting.
    *   **Genetic Predisposition:** Some varieties are naturally more prone to splitting.

*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Irrigation Management:** Maintain consistent soil moisture, especially during the pod development stage. Avoid extremes of drought and waterlogging. Apply light, frequent irrigations rather than heavy, infrequent ones.
    *   **Nutrient Management:**
        *   **Boron:** If soil tests indicate deficiency, apply **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate) at 10-15 kg/acre as a soil application before sowing. Alternatively, a foliar spray of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** at 1-1.5 g/L water can be applied at pre-flowering and pod development stages.
        *   **Calcium:** If deficiency is suspected, apply **Calcium nitrate** at 20-25 kg/acre as a soil application, or a foliar spray of **Calcium chloride** at 0.5-1 g/L water during pod development.
    *   **Variety Selection:** Choose pea varieties known for strong pod walls and resistance to splitting.
    *   **Timely Harvest:** Harvest pods at their optimal maturity stage. Over-mature pods are more susceptible to splitting.

### 2. Leaf Burning/Melting in Peas

This condition typically arises from environmental stress or improper agrochemical application.

*   **Causes:**
    *   **Heat and Sun Scorch:** High temperatures and intense sunlight, especially when plants are under water stress, can lead to leaf burning.
    *   **Chemical Burn:** Improper application of pesticides, herbicides, or high-concentration foliar fertilizers (wrong dosage, application during hot periods, or when plants are stressed).
    *   **Waterlogging:** Prolonged waterlogging can damage roots, leading to wilting and subsequent "melting" or collapse of leaf tissue.
    *   **Nutrient Toxicity:** Excessive application of certain nutrients can also cause leaf burn.

*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Water Management:** Ensure adequate and consistent irrigation to prevent drought stress, which exacerbates heat stress. Simultaneously, ensure proper drainage to avoid waterlogging.
    *   **Agrochemical Application:**
        *   Always follow recommended dosages and application instructions for all agrochemicals.
        *   Avoid spraying pesticides, herbicides, or high-concentration foliar fertilizers during peak heat hours (typically 11 AM - 4 PM) or when plants are already stressed. Apply in the early morning or late evening.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive application of fertilizers, especially nitrogen, which can make foliage more tender and susceptible to burn. Base fertilizer applications on soil test recommendations for balanced nutrition.
    *   **Variety Selection:** If available, select heat-tolerant pea varieties suitable for Haryana's climate.

### 3. Hardness in Fruit (Pea Pods/Seeds)

This is primarily a maturity-related issue, where the quality of the pea changes as it ages.

*   **Causes:**
    *   **Over-maturity:** As peas mature past their optimal stage for fresh consumption, sugars convert to starch, and the texture becomes firm and less sweet.
    *   **Environmental Stress:** Conditions like drought can accelerate the maturity process, leading to premature hardening.

*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Timely Harvest:** This is the most critical factor. Harvest peas at their optimal stage of maturity when they are tender, sweet, and bright green. For fresh market, this is typically when pods are well-filled but still succulent. Regular monitoring of the crop is essential.
    *   **Variety Selection:** Choose varieties known to maintain tenderness for a longer period after reaching maturity.
    *   **Water Management:** Maintain consistent soil moisture during pod development to prevent premature hardening due to stress.

By implementing these practices, you can significantly reduce the incidence of these physical damages in your pea crop. For specific recommendations tailored to your farm, a soil test and on-site assessment are always advisable.
