As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm the following regarding the diseases you've mentioned for Peas:

*   **Dieback:** This is not known to affect Peas.
*   **Twig blight:** This is not known to affect Peas.
*   **Tikka disease:** This is not known to affect Peas.

These terms are generally associated with other crops or woody plants, not specifically with peas. Peas are susceptible to various other diseases such as powdery mildew, rust, downy mildew, Ascochyta blight, and Fusarium wilt, which require specific management strategies.
