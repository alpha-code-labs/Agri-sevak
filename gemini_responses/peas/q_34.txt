As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I advise pea growers in Haryana to adopt the following scientifically verified practices to minimize the harmful effects of weedicides/herbicides on their pea crop:

*   **Herbicide Selection:** Always choose herbicides that are specifically registered and recommended for weed control in peas. Using non-selective or unapproved herbicides is a primary cause of severe crop injury. Consult the latest HAU recommendations or CIBRC approved labels.
*   **Accurate Dosage:** Precisely measure the recommended dose of the herbicide. Overdosing is a common cause of phytotoxicity. Refer to the product label for specific recommendations, typically in ml/L or kg/acre.
*   **Correct Application Timing:** Apply herbicides at the recommended crop and weed growth stages. For instance, pre-emergence herbicides must be applied before pea emergence, while post-emergence herbicides have a specific window (e.g., 2-4 leaf stage of weeds, or specific pea growth stages). Applying outside this window can lead to reduced efficacy on weeds and increased injury to peas.
*   **Sprayer Calibration:** Regularly calibrate your sprayer to ensure uniform application and correct delivery rate. Uneven application can lead to areas of overdose and underdose, causing injury in some spots and poor weed control in others.
*   **Optimal Environmental Conditions:**
    *   Avoid applying herbicides during periods of extreme temperatures (very hot or very cold), high wind speeds (to prevent drift), or when peas are under stress from drought, waterlogging, or nutrient deficiency.
    *   Ensure adequate soil moisture before and after application, especially for soil-applied herbicides, as this aids in proper herbicide activation and crop tolerance.
*   **Water Quality:** Use clean water for spraying. Water pH and hardness can sometimes affect herbicide efficacy and crop safety.
*   **Adjuvant Use:** If an adjuvant is recommended on the herbicide label, use it at the specified rate. Using unapproved adjuvants or incorrect rates can sometimes increase the risk of crop injury.
*   **Thorough Tank Cleaning:** Always clean the sprayer tank, hoses, and nozzles thoroughly after each use, especially when switching between different herbicides or crops. Residues from previous herbicide applications (e.g., 2,4-D from wheat) can cause severe damage to sensitive crops like peas.
*   **Crop Health and Nutrition:** Maintain healthy pea plants through balanced fertilization and proper irrigation. Healthy, vigorous plants are generally more tolerant to herbicide stress and recover faster if minor injury occurs.
*   **Drift Management:** Take all necessary precautions to minimize spray drift to adjacent sensitive crops or areas. Use appropriate nozzles (e.g., low-drift nozzles), maintain correct boom height, and avoid spraying in windy conditions.
