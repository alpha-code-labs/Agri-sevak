As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified seed and soil treatment processes for Peas (Matar) to ensure healthy crop establishment and mitigate early-season challenges in Haryana.

### Recommended Seed Treatment Process for Peas

Seed treatment is crucial for protecting germinating seeds and young seedlings from seed-borne and early soil-borne diseases and pests, as well as for enhancing nutrient uptake.

1.  **Fungal Disease Protection (Damping-off, Root Rot, Ascochyta Blight):**
    *   Treat seeds with a fungicide mixture to provide broad-spectrum protection.
    *   **Carbendazim**: 1 g/kg seed
    *   **Thiram**: 2 g/kg seed
    *   *Alternatively, for specific issues like downy mildew (early stages):*
        *   **Metalaxyl**: 6 g/kg seed (often used in combination formulations, but for technical name, Metalaxyl is the active ingredient for downy mildew).

2.  **Insect Pest Protection (Early Season Pests like Aphids, Thrips, Seedling Maggot):**
    *   To protect against early sucking pests and some soil-borne insects, an insecticide seed treatment is beneficial.
    *   **Imidacloprid**: 5-7 ml/kg seed (for 600 FS formulation)
    *   **Thiamethoxam**: 3-5 g/kg seed (for 70 WS formulation)

3.  **Bio-fertilizer Inoculation (Nitrogen Fixation):**
    *   Peas are legumes and require specific bacteria for nitrogen fixation.
    *   **Rhizobium leguminosarum**: 10 g/kg seed
    *   *For enhanced disease suppression and nutrient mobilization:*
        *   **Trichoderma viride**: 4-5 g/kg seed

**Order of Application for Seed Treatment:**
It is critical to follow the correct sequence for seed treatment:
1.  Fungicide treatment first.
2.  Insecticide treatment second.
3.  Bio-fertilizer (Rhizobium, Trichoderma) treatment last, just before sowing. This ensures the viability of the beneficial microbes is not compromised by the chemicals.

### Recommended Soil Treatment Process for Peas

Soil treatment focuses on managing soil-borne diseases, nematodes, and insect pests that can affect the crop throughout its growth cycle.

1.  **Fungal Disease Management (Wilt, Root Rots):**
    *   **Biological Control:**
        *   **Trichoderma viride**: 2.5 kg/acre. Mix with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost and broadcast evenly before the last ploughing, then incorporate into the soil. This helps suppress soil-borne fungal pathogens like *Fusarium* and *Rhizoctonia*.
    *   **Cultural Practices:**
        *   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting peas or other susceptible legumes in the same field for at least 3-4 years.
        *   **Soil Solarization:** In summer, covering moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks can significantly reduce soil-borne pathogens and weed seeds.

2.  **Insect Pest Management (Cutworms, Termites, Grubs):**
    *   If there is a known history of these pests, soil application of insecticides can be considered.
    *   **Chlorpyrifos**: 4 L/acre (for 20 EC formulation) mixed with irrigation water or applied as a drench in the soil before sowing.
    *   **Fipronil**: 5-10 kg/acre (for 0.3 G or 0.6 G granular formulation) incorporated into the soil at the time of field preparation.

3.  **Nematode Management (Root-knot Nematodes):**
    *   **Organic Amendments:**
        *   **Neem cake**: 200-400 kg/acre. Incorporate into the soil 2-3 weeks before sowing. Neem cake helps in suppressing nematode populations and improving soil health.
    *   **Biological Control:**
        *   *Paecilomyces lilacinus* (a bio-nematicide): 2.5 kg/acre mixed with FYM and incorporated into the soil.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always ensure proper soil moisture for effective seed and soil treatments.
*   Read and follow the instructions on the product labels carefully for safe and effective application.
*   Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods, is always recommended for sustainable agriculture.
*   Regular soil testing is advised to understand nutrient status and potential pest/disease pressure.
