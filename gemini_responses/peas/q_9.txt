Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding mite infestations in your pea crop. Both Red Spider Mite (*Tetranychus urticae*) and Rust Mites (Eriophyid mites) can cause significant damage, leading to reduced yield and quality. Here's a scientifically verified approach for their control:

**Understanding the Problem:**
*   **Red Spider Mites:** These are tiny, often reddish-brown mites that feed on the underside of leaves, causing characteristic stippling (tiny yellow or white spots). In severe infestations, webbing may be visible, and leaves turn yellow, bronze, or silvery before drying and falling off.
*   **Rust Mites:** These are microscopic mites, often invisible to the naked eye. They cause bronzing, russeting, or a "rusty" appearance on leaves, stems, and pods. Affected parts may become distorted or stunted.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategy:**

A holistic approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods is most effective.

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep fields and surrounding areas free of weeds, as many weeds serve as alternate hosts for mites.
    *   **Proper Irrigation:** Avoid water stress, as it can make plants more susceptible to mite attacks. Overhead irrigation can sometimes help dislodge mites, but ensure it doesn't promote fungal diseases.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate peas with non-host crops to break the mite life cycle.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy severely infested plant debris after harvest.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Encourage natural enemies like predatory mites (*Amblyseius* spp.), lady beetles, and lacewings, which feed on pest mites. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

3.  **Monitoring:**
    *   Regularly inspect the underside of leaves, especially during dry and warm weather, for early signs of mite infestation. Early detection is crucial for effective control.

**Chemical Control (Acaricides):**

When mite populations reach damaging levels, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always ensure thorough coverage, especially on the underside of leaves, as mites primarily reside there. Rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

Here are some CIBRC approved technical chemical names for mite control in peas:

*   **For Red Spider Mite and Rust Mite:**
    *   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** Apply at a rate of 125 ml per acre (or approximately 0.5 ml per litre of water). This acaricide is effective against all life stages of mites, including eggs and nymphs, and has good residual action.
    *   **Fenpyroximate 5% SC:** Apply at a rate of 250-300 ml per acre (or approximately 1.0-1.2 ml per litre of water). It provides quick knockdown and good residual control against various mite species.
    *   **Propargite 57% EC:** Apply at a rate of 1.0-1.5 litres per acre (or approximately 2.0-3.0 ml per litre of water). This is a broad-spectrum acaricide effective against motile stages of mites.
    *   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP:** Apply at a rate of 1.5-2.0 kg per acre (or approximately 3.0-4.0 g per litre of water). Sulphur is an economical option, effective against both red spider mites and rust mites, and also provides some fungicidal benefits.
    *   **Abamectin 1.9% EC:** Apply at a rate of 150-200 ml per acre (or approximately 0.6-0.8 ml per litre of water). This acaricide has translaminar action, meaning it penetrates the leaf tissue, providing control of mites feeding on the underside of leaves.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always check the label for the recommended Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) for the specific chemical you are using. This is the minimum time that must pass between the last pesticide application and harvest to ensure the produce is safe for consumption.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, and protective clothing while handling and spraying chemicals. Follow all safety instructions on the product label.
*   **Spray Volume:** Ensure adequate spray volume (typically 200-250 litres of water per acre for field crops) to achieve thorough coverage of the foliage.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate different classes of acaricides to prevent mites from developing resistance to a particular chemical.

For precise recommendations tailored to your specific field conditions and the severity of infestation, it is always advisable to consult with your local agricultural extension officer or an expert from HAU.
