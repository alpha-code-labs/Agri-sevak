As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I advise on addressing micronutrient deficiencies in Peas (Matar) based on scientific principles and CIBRC-approved practices for Haryana.

**Crucial First Step:**
Before applying any micronutrient, it is highly recommended to conduct a **soil test** to accurately diagnose the specific deficiency and its severity. Visual symptoms can sometimes be misleading.

Here's how to address the common micronutrient deficiencies in Peas:

### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms in Peas:** Stunted growth, interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, small and narrow leaves, sometimes a rosetting appearance.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application (Pre-sowing/at sowing, once every 2-3 years):**
        *   Apply **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (21% Zn) at 10-25 kg/acre.
        *   Alternatively, apply **Zinc sulphate monohydrate** (33% Zn) at 5-10 kg/acre.
    *   **Foliar Application (for standing crop, when symptoms appear):**
        *   Spray 0.5% solution of **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (5 g/L water) mixed with 0.25% unslaked lime (2.5 g/L water) to neutralize acidity.
        *   Alternatively, spray 0.1% solution of **Zinc EDTA** (1 g/L water).
        *   Repeat spray after 10-15 days if symptoms persist.

### 2. Iron (Fe) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms in Peas:** Pronounced interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, which can turn almost white in severe cases, while veins remain green. Stunted growth. Often observed in calcareous or alkaline soils.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Generally less effective in alkaline soils due to rapid fixation.
    *   **Foliar Application (most effective for iron chlorosis):**
        *   Spray 0.5-1% solution of **Ferrous sulphate** (5-10 g/L water) mixed with 0.25% unslaked lime (2.5 g/L water).
        *   Alternatively, spray 0.1% solution of **Ferrous EDTA** (1 g/L water).
        *   Repeat sprays at 7-10 day intervals until symptoms disappear.

### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms in Peas:** Stunted growth, death of terminal buds (growing points), poor flower and pod set, internal discoloration or necrosis of pods/seeds, sometimes hollow stem.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application (Pre-sowing/at sowing):**
        *   Apply **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate, 10.5% B) at 2-4 kg/acre.
        *   Alternatively, apply **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (Solubor, 20.5% B) at 1-2 kg/acre.
    *   **Foliar Application (at flowering/pod development stage):**
        *   Spray 0.1-0.2% solution of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (1-2 g/L water).
        *   Alternatively, spray 0.1-0.2% solution of **Boric acid** (1-2 g/L water).
        *   Ensure thorough coverage of foliage.

### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms in Peas:** Stunted growth, necrosis (death) of young leaves and growing points, poor root development, sometimes poor pod filling.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application (Pre-sowing):**
        *   If soil pH is low and calcium is deficient, apply **Gypsum** (Calcium sulphate dihydrate) at 200-500 kg/acre based on soil test recommendations.
        *   For direct calcium supply, **Calcium nitrate** can be applied.
    *   **Foliar Application (at critical growth stages):**
        *   Spray 0.5-1% solution of **Calcium nitrate** (5-10 g/L water).
        *   Alternatively, spray 0.5-1% solution of **Calcium chloride** (5-10 g/L water).
        *   Apply during early pod development for best results.

### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms in Peas:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves (veins remain green), leaves may become brittle and show reddish-purple tints, premature defoliation.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application (Pre-sowing/at sowing):**
        *   Apply **Magnesium sulphate** (Epsom salt, 9.6% Mg) at 10-20 kg/acre.
    *   **Foliar Application (when symptoms appear):**
        *   Spray 0.5-1% solution of **Magnesium sulphate** (5-10 g/L water).
        *   Repeat after 10-15 days if symptoms persist.

### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms in Peas:** "Marsh spot" – dark brown or black spots on the cotyledons of seeds (visible when split), interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, stunted growth. Often seen in alkaline soils or organic soils.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   Apply **Manganese sulphate** (27.5% Mn) at 10-20 kg/acre. However, soil application can be less effective in alkaline soils.
    *   **Foliar Application (most effective for Mn deficiency in peas):**
        *   Spray 0.5% solution of **Manganese sulphate** (5 g/L water) mixed with 0.25% unslaked lime (2.5 g/L water).
        *   Alternatively, spray 0.1% solution of **Manganese EDTA** (1 g/L water).
        *   Apply at early vegetative stage and repeat if necessary, especially before flowering.

**General Recommendations:**

*   Always use clean water for spraying.
*   Ensure thorough coverage of the plant foliage during foliar applications.
*   Avoid spraying during hot midday hours or when rain is expected.
*   Consult your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's soil conditions and pea variety.
