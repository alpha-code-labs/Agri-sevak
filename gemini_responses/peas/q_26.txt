As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified information regarding specialized practices in Peas (Pisum sativum) relevant to Haryana's agricultural context:

Here is information on the specialized practices you inquired about for Peas:

*   **Pruning:** This is not a standard specialized practice for Peas. Peas are annual herbaceous plants that typically grow either as determinate bush types or indeterminate vining types. Traditional pruning, as practiced in woody plants or some fruiting vegetables, is generally not required for pea cultivation. For indeterminate vining types, some growers might occasionally pinch back the growing tips to encourage bushier growth or manage plant size, but this is not a widespread or essential practice for yield.

*   **Desuckering:** This is not known to affect Peas. Peas do not produce suckers that require removal as a specialized cultural practice. Desuckering is typically performed on crops like tomatoes or maize.

*   **Mulching:** Mulching is a highly beneficial practice for Peas, especially in the climatic conditions of Haryana.
    *   **Moisture Conservation:** Mulch helps reduce evaporation from the soil surface, conserving soil moisture, which is crucial during dry spells or for efficient water use.
    *   **Weed Suppression:** A layer of mulch can effectively suppress weed growth, reducing competition for nutrients and water, and minimizing the need for manual weeding or herbicides.
    *   **Soil Temperature Regulation:** Mulch helps moderate soil temperature, keeping the soil cooler in warmer periods and warmer in cooler periods, which can be beneficial for root development.
    *   **Soil Health Improvement:** Organic mulches (e.g., straw, dried leaves, crop residues) decompose over time, adding organic matter to the soil, improving soil structure, and enhancing microbial activity.
    *   **Application:** Apply a 5-10 cm thick layer of organic mulch around the base of the pea plants once they are established, ensuring it does not touch the stems directly to prevent rot.

*   **Grafting:** This is not known to affect Peas. Peas are herbaceous annuals and are not typically propagated or grown using grafting techniques. Grafting is primarily used for woody plants or certain vegetable crops (e.g., brinjal, tomato, cucurbits) to impart disease resistance, vigor, or specific rootstock characteristics.

*   **Pollination:** Peas are primarily self-pollinating plants. Their flowers are structured in such a way that the anthers (male parts) shed pollen directly onto the stigma (female part) within the closed keel petals, often before the flower even fully opens. Therefore, specialized pollination practices, such as hand-pollination or reliance on insect pollinators, are generally not required for successful fruit set and yield in commercial pea cultivation. While cross-pollination can occur, it is not essential for pea production.
