As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following cultivation practices for Peas in Haryana, based on scientific research and local conditions:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   Peas are best sown in rows using a seed drill. This ensures uniform depth, spacing, and facilitates inter-cultivation operations.
    *   Broadcasting is generally not recommended as it leads to uneven plant stand and makes weed management difficult.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   The optimal planting depth for peas is **5-7 cm**.
    *   Sowing too shallow can lead to poor root development and susceptibility to bird damage, while sowing too deep can delay emergence and increase the risk of seed rot, especially in heavy soils.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   **Row-to-Row Spacing:**
        *   For Field Peas (dry peas): **30 cm**
        *   For Garden Peas (vegetable peas - early varieties): **30 cm**
        *   For Garden Peas (vegetable peas - late/tall varieties): **45-60 cm**
    *   **Plant-to-Plant Spacing:**
        *   For Field Peas: **10 cm**
        *   For Garden Peas (early varieties): **5-7 cm**
        *   For Garden Peas (late/tall varieties): **10-15 cm**

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   The seed dose varies depending on the pea type (field vs. garden), variety, and seed size.
    *   For Field Peas: **75-100 kg/acre**
    *   For Garden Peas (early varieties): **80-100 kg/acre**
    *   For Garden Peas (late/tall varieties): **40-60 kg/acre**

It is also advisable to treat seeds with appropriate fungicides and inoculate with Rhizobium culture before sowing to ensure better germination and nitrogen fixation.
