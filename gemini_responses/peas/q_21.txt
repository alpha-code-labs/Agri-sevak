As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for managing toxicity or excessive levels of Zinc, Iron, Magnesium, and Manganese in Peas ( मटर ):

It is crucial to conduct a comprehensive soil test to accurately diagnose the specific nutrient excess and its severity before implementing any management strategies.

### Management of Zinc (Zn) Toxicity in Peas

Peas are susceptible to Zinc toxicity, especially in acidic soils or due to over-application of Zn fertilizers.
*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, chlorosis (yellowing) of younger leaves, necrosis (browning/death) of leaf margins, bronzing, and reduced root development.
*   **Management Strategies:**
    *   **Soil pH Adjustment:** Increase soil pH to reduce Zinc availability. Apply liming materials such as **Calcium carbonate** (agricultural lime) at a rate determined by soil test recommendations, typically ranging from 500-2000 kg/acre, depending on the initial pH and soil type. If Magnesium is also deficient or balanced, **Dolomite** (Dolomitic lime) can be used.
    *   **Improve Drainage:** Ensure good soil drainage to prevent anaerobic conditions that can exacerbate heavy metal availability.
    *   **Organic Matter Addition:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost at 5-10 tonnes/acre to improve soil structure and chelate excess Zinc, making it less available to plants.
    *   **Avoid Further Zn Application:** Cease any further application of Zinc-containing fertilizers or micronutrient mixtures.

### Management of Iron (Fe) Toxicity in Peas

Iron toxicity can occur in peas, particularly in waterlogged, acidic soils.
*   **Symptoms:** Bronzing, purpling, or dark brown spots on older leaves, stunted growth, and root damage.
*   **Management Strategies:**
    *   **Improve Drainage:** This is the most critical step. Ensure excellent drainage to prevent waterlogging, which significantly increases Iron availability.
    *   **Soil pH Adjustment:** Raise soil pH to reduce Iron availability. Apply liming materials like **Calcium carbonate** or **Dolomite** at rates recommended by soil tests (e.g., 500-2000 kg/acre).
    *   **Soil Aeration:** Practices like light tillage or subsoiling (where appropriate) can improve soil aeration.
    *   **Organic Matter Addition:** Incorporate organic matter to improve soil structure and potentially chelate excess Iron.

### Management of Magnesium (Mg) Toxicity in Peas

Direct Magnesium toxicity is rare in field conditions for peas. High Magnesium levels typically cause problems by inducing deficiencies of other essential nutrients, primarily Calcium (Ca) and Potassium (K), leading to nutrient imbalances.
*   **Symptoms:** Symptoms would generally manifest as those of Calcium or Potassium deficiency, such as stunted growth, marginal necrosis, or interveinal chlorosis, rather than direct Mg toxicity.
*   **Management Strategies:**
    *   **Soil Testing:** Confirm high Mg levels and assess Ca and K status.
    *   **Balance with Calcium:** Apply **Gypsum** (Calcium sulfate) at 200-500 kg/acre to increase Calcium levels without significantly altering soil pH. Alternatively, if pH adjustment is also needed, **Calcium carbonate** can be used.
    *   **Balance with Potassium:** Apply **Potassium sulfate** at 50-100 kg/acre or **Potassium chloride** (Muriate of Potash) at 40-80 kg/acre, based on soil test recommendations, to correct any induced Potassium deficiency.
    *   **Improve Drainage:** Ensure good drainage to prevent accumulation of salts.
    *   **Avoid Further Mg Application:** Discontinue the use of Magnesium-containing fertilizers.

### Management of Manganese (Mn) Toxicity in Peas

Peas are relatively sensitive to Manganese toxicity, especially in acidic and waterlogged soils.
*   **Symptoms:** Chlorosis, crinkling, or cupping of younger leaves, small dark spots (speckling) on older leaves, marginal necrosis, and stunted growth.
*   **Management Strategies:**
    *   **Soil pH Adjustment:** Increase soil pH to reduce Manganese availability. Apply liming materials such as **Calcium carbonate** or **Dolomite** at rates determined by soil test recommendations (e.g., 500-2000 kg/acre).
    *   **Improve Drainage:** Ensure proper soil drainage to prevent anaerobic conditions that increase Manganese solubility.
    *   **Organic Matter Addition:** Incorporate well-decomposed organic matter at 5-10 tonnes/acre to improve soil health and potentially reduce Mn availability.
    *   **Avoid Further Mn Application:** Cease any further application of Manganese-containing fertilizers.

Always consult with your local agricultural extension office or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's soil conditions and crop history.
