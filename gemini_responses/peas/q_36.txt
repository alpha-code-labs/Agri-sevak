As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified practices to improve yield, fruit quality, and storage life for peas in Haryana:

### To Improve Yield:

1.  **Variety Selection:**
    *   Choose high-yielding, disease-resistant varieties suitable for Haryana's agro-climatic conditions. Recommended varieties include 'Arkel' (early), 'Pusa Pragati', 'Pusa Vipal', 'Bonneville', and 'AP-3'.
2.  **Optimal Sowing:**
    *   **Sowing Time:** Mid-October to Mid-November for early varieties; Mid-November to Mid-December for main season varieties.
    *   **Spacing:** Maintain a row-to-row distance of 30 cm and plant-to-plant distance of 5-10 cm.
    *   **Seed Rate:** Use 80-100 kg/acre for early varieties and 60-80 kg/acre for main season varieties.
3.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Basal Application:** Apply 15-20 kg Nitrogen (N), 60 kg Phosphorus (P2O5), and 40 kg Potassium (K2O) per acre at the time of sowing.
    *   **Micronutrients:**
        *   **Zinc:** Apply **Zinc Sulphate** 21% at 10 kg/acre as basal, or foliar spray of **Zinc Sulphate** 0.5% (5 g/L) at the pre-flowering stage.
        *   **Boron:** Apply **Borax** 10.5% at 4 kg/acre as basal, or foliar spray of **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** 0.2% (2 g/L) at the pre-flowering stage.
        *   **Molybdenum:** Seed treatment with **Ammonium Molybdate** at 1 g/kg seed, especially in acidic soils, to enhance nitrogen fixation.
4.  **Irrigation:**
    *   Provide light and frequent irrigations. Critical stages for irrigation are branching, flowering, and pod development. Avoid waterlogging.
5.  **Weed Management:**
    *   **Pre-emergence:** Apply **Pendimethalin** 30% EC at 1.0-1.3 L/acre within 3 days of sowing.
    *   **Post-emergence (for grassy weeds):** Apply **Quizalofop-ethyl** 5% EC at 400-500 ml/acre when weeds are at the 2-4 leaf stage.
6.  **Pest and Disease Management:**
    *   Regularly monitor for common pests like pea aphid and pod borer, and diseases such as powdery mildew, rust, and wilt.
    *   For powdery mildew, apply **Sulphur** 80% WP at 2 kg/acre or **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC at 200 ml/acre.
    *   For aphids, apply **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL at 100-125 ml/acre.

### To Improve Fruit Quality:

1.  **Variety Selection:**
    *   Choose varieties specifically known for good pod fill, sweetness, tenderness, and uniform size (e.g., 'Arkel', 'Pusa Pragati').
2.  **Balanced Nutrition:**
    *   Ensure adequate supply of Phosphorus, Potassium, and Calcium.
    *   **Calcium:** Foliar spray of **Calcium Nitrate** 0.5% (5 g/L) at flowering and pod development stages can improve pod firmness and reduce shattering.
    *   **Boron:** As mentioned above, Boron is crucial for sugar transport and proper pod development, contributing to better quality.
3.  **Consistent Moisture:**
    *   Maintain consistent soil moisture, especially during pod development, to prevent shriveling and ensure plump, tender peas.
4.  **Timely Harvesting:**
    *   Harvest pods at their optimum maturity stage when they are plump, bright green, and tender. Over-mature peas become starchy and lose sweetness and tenderness quickly.

### To Improve Storage Life:

1.  **Gentle Harvesting:**
    *   Harvest peas carefully to avoid any physical damage (bruises, cuts), as damaged pods are more susceptible to spoilage and microbial growth.
2.  **Pre-cooling:**
    *   Immediately after harvest, rapidly remove field heat by hydro-cooling or forced-air cooling to bring the temperature down to 0-2°C. This significantly slows down respiration and enzymatic activity.
3.  **Temperature and Humidity Control:**
    *   **Storage Temperature:** Store peas at 0-1°C.
    *   **Relative Humidity:** Maintain a high relative humidity (90-95%) to prevent moisture loss and shriveling of pods.
4.  **Appropriate Packaging:**
    *   Use perforated plastic bags or crates lined with plastic film. This helps maintain high humidity around the peas while allowing some air circulation, preventing anaerobic conditions.
5.  **Avoid Ethylene Exposure:**
    *   Store peas away from ethylene-producing fruits and vegetables (e.g., apples, bananas), as ethylene can accelerate senescence and spoilage in peas.

For specific recommendations tailored to your farm, always consult your local agricultural extension office and consider a soil test report.
