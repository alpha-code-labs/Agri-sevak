Mites, including Red Spider Mite (*Tetranychus urticae*) and Rust Mite (*Aculops spp.*), are significant pests of Guar, especially under hot and dry conditions prevalent in Haryana. Effective management requires an integrated approach.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Mites in Guar:**

1.  **Monitoring:**
    *   Regularly inspect Guar plants, particularly the undersides of leaves, for the presence of mites, their eggs, fine webbing (characteristic of spider mites), and symptoms like bronzing, yellowing, or leaf distortion. Early detection is key.

2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Proper Irrigation:** Maintain adequate soil moisture. Mites thrive in dry conditions, so proper irrigation can help reduce their populations. Overhead irrigation can physically dislodge mites.
    *   **Weed Management:** Control weeds in and around Guar fields, as many weeds can serve as alternate hosts for mites.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy crop residues after harvest to reduce overwintering mite populations.

3.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Conserve natural enemies such as predatory mites (*Amblyseius spp.*), ladybird beetles, and lacewings, which prey on various mite species. Avoid using broad-spectrum insecticides that can harm these beneficial insects.

4.  **Chemical Control (Acaricides):**
    *   Apply acaricides when mite populations reach economic threshold levels. Ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where mites are most prevalent. Rotate different classes of acaricides to prevent the development of resistance.

    *   **For Red Spider Mite and Rust Mite control, consider the following CIBRC-approved acaricides:**

        *   **Propargite 57% EC:**
            *   Dosage: 1.5 - 2.0 ml per litre of water (or 600 - 800 ml per acre in 300-400 litres of water).
        *   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:**
            *   Dosage: 0.5 - 0.7 ml per litre of water (or 200 - 280 ml per acre in 300-400 litres of water).
        *   **Fenpyroximate 5% SC:**
            *   Dosage: 0.5 - 1.0 ml per litre of water (or 200 - 400 ml per acre in 300-400 litres of water).
        *   **Abamectin 1.9% EC:**
            *   Dosage: 0.4 - 0.5 ml per litre of water (or 160 - 200 ml per acre in 300-400 litres of water).
        *   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP:**
            *   Dosage: 2.0 - 3.0 g per litre of water (or 800 - 1200 g per acre in 300-400 litres of water).
            *   *Note: Sulphur can be phytotoxic at high temperatures; apply during cooler parts of the day.*
        *   **Fenazaquin 10% EC:**
            *   Dosage: 1.0 - 1.25 ml per litre of water (or 400 - 500 ml per acre in 300-400 litres of water).

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and strictly follow the label instructions of the specific product being used, including safety precautions, re-entry intervals (REI), and pre-harvest intervals (PHI).
*   Ensure complete spray coverage, particularly on the undersides of leaves where mites are most prevalent.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension specialists at HAU for the most current recommendations and specific thresholds for your region in Haryana.
