Dear Farmer,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with the scientifically verified information regarding the maturity signs, harvesting time, and cutting process for Guar (Cluster Bean) in Haryana.

### Maturity Signs for Guar:

The following signs indicate that your Guar crop is ready for harvest:

*   **Pod Colour Change:** The pods will change from green to a yellowish-brown or light brown colour.
*   **Leaf Senescence:** The lower leaves will start to turn yellow, dry up, and shed. The overall plant will show signs of drying.
*   **Seed Hardness:** When you open a pod, the seeds inside should be hard and firm. Immature seeds will be soft and greenish.
*   **Rattling Sound:** If you shake a mature pod, you should hear the seeds rattling inside, indicating they are dry and detached from the pod walls.
*   **Moisture Content:** The seeds should have reached a low moisture content, typically below 10-12%, for safe storage and processing.

### Harvesting Time for Guar:

The optimal time for harvesting Guar is crucial to maximize yield and quality, while minimizing losses.

*   **Stage of Maturity:** Harvest when 80-90% of the pods on the plant have matured, dried, and turned yellowish-brown.
*   **Days After Sowing:** Depending on the variety and prevailing weather conditions, Guar is typically ready for harvest between 90 to 120 days after sowing. Early maturing varieties may be ready sooner.
*   **Avoid Premature Harvesting:** Harvesting too early will result in a higher proportion of immature seeds, leading to lower yield and poor quality.
*   **Avoid Delayed Harvesting:** Delaying harvest too much can lead to significant shattering losses, especially during windy conditions, as the dry pods become brittle and easily break open.

### Cutting Process for Guar:

The cutting process can be done manually or mechanically, depending on the scale of cultivation.

*   **Manual Harvesting:**
    *   The plants are cut close to the ground using sickles.
    *   Care should be taken to handle the plants gently to prevent shattering of dry pods.
    *   The harvested plants are then gathered into small bundles.
    *   These bundles are typically stacked in the field for 2-3 days to allow for further drying and uniform maturity of any remaining slightly green pods. This process is known as 'curing'.
    *   After curing, the bundles are threshed to separate the seeds. Threshing can be done by beating the bundles with sticks or using a suitable thresher.
*   **Mechanical Harvesting (Combine Harvester):**
    *   For large-scale cultivation, combine harvesters can be used.
    *   The combine should be properly adjusted for Guar to minimize seed damage and shattering losses. This includes setting the cylinder speed and concave clearance appropriately.
    *   Direct combining is possible if the crop is uniformly dry and free of weeds.
    *   In some cases, the crop may be windrowed (cut and laid in rows to dry) first, and then picked up and threshed by a combine harvester after a few days of drying in the windrow.

After threshing, the seeds should be cleaned to remove any chaff, dirt, or immature seeds, and then dried to the recommended moisture content (typically 8-10%) before storage to prevent spoilage.
