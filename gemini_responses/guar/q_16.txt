As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following fertilizer doses for Guar (Cluster Bean) in Haryana. It is always advisable to conduct a soil test to determine the precise nutrient requirements for your specific field, as these recommendations are general guidelines.

**General Nutrient Recommendations for Guar (per acre):**
*   **Nitrogen (N):** 15-20 kg N
*   **Phosphorus (P2O5):** 40-60 kg P2O5
*   **Potassium (K2O):** 20 kg K2O (only if soil test indicates deficiency)
*   **Sulphur (S):** 10-20 kg S

Here are the recommended doses for the specific fertilizers you inquired about:

**1. Urea**
*   **Purpose:** To supply Nitrogen. Guar, being a legume, requires a lower starter dose of Nitrogen.
*   **Dose:** If DAP is not used as the primary source of P, apply 35-45 kg **Urea** per acre as a basal dose at the time of sowing.

**2. Nano-Urea**
*   **Purpose:** Supplementary Nitrogen nutrition, especially during critical growth stages.
*   **Dose:** For foliar application, mix 2-4 ml **Nano-Urea** per liter of water. Apply at the branching stage and again at the pod initiation stage. This is a supplementary application and does not replace basal N.

**3. DAP (Di-Ammonium Phosphate)**
*   **Purpose:** To supply Phosphorus and a starter dose of Nitrogen. This is often the preferred basal fertilizer for Guar.
*   **Dose:** Apply 90-130 kg **DAP** per acre as a basal dose at the time of sowing. This will provide approximately 16-23 kg N and 41-60 kg P2O5.

**4. Nano-DAP**
*   **Purpose:** Supplementary Phosphorus and Nitrogen nutrition, especially during flowering and pod development.
*   **Dose:** For foliar application, mix 2-4 ml **Nano-DAP** per liter of water. Apply at the pre-flowering stage and again at the pod development stage. This is a supplementary application.

**5. NPK (Complex Fertilizers)**
*   **Purpose:** To supply Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium.
*   **Dose:** If using a complex NPK fertilizer, choose a grade with a high P content and low N, such as **12:32:16** or **10:26:26**. The dose should be adjusted to meet the P requirement of 40-60 kg P2O5 per acre. For example, to provide 40 kg P2O5 using **12:32:16**, apply approximately 125 kg **12:32:16** per acre as a basal dose. This would also provide 15 kg N and 20 kg K2O.

**6. SSP (Single Super Phosphate)**
*   **Purpose:** To supply Phosphorus, Sulphur, and Calcium.
*   **Dose:** If using SSP as the primary source of P, apply 250-375 kg **SSP** per acre as a basal dose at the time of sowing. This will provide 40-60 kg P2O5 and 27-41 kg S. If using SSP, a separate application of **Urea** (35-45 kg/acre) will be needed to meet the N requirement.

**7. Potash (Muriate of Potash - MOP)**
*   **Purpose:** To supply Potassium. Haryana soils are generally medium to high in potassium, so it's recommended only if a soil test indicates deficiency.
*   **Dose:** If soil test indicates potassium deficiency, apply 30-35 kg **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** per acre as a basal dose at the time of sowing.

**8. Sulphur**
*   **Purpose:** Essential for nodulation, amino acid synthesis, and overall plant health in legumes.
*   **Dose:** If not using SSP (which provides Sulphur), apply 10-20 kg **Elemental Sulphur** (90% S) per acre (approximately 11-22 kg of product) or 100-200 kg **Gypsum** per acre as a basal dose at the time of sowing.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Basal Application:** All conventional fertilizers (Urea, DAP, SSP, MOP, NPK, Elemental Sulphur, Gypsum) should be applied as a basal dose and thoroughly mixed into the soil before sowing.
*   **Foliar Application:** Nano fertilizers are for foliar application and act as supplements, not replacements, for basal nutrient requirements.
*   **Soil Testing:** Always prioritize soil test-based recommendations for optimal nutrient management and to avoid over-application or deficiencies.
