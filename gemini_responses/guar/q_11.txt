As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in Guar (cluster bean) in Haryana:

**Control of Beetles in Guar:**

The primary beetle pest affecting Guar in Haryana is the **Blister Beetle (Mylabris spp., Epicauta spp.)**. These beetles feed on flowers and young pods, causing significant yield losses.

**Management Strategies:**

1.  **Cultural Control:**
    *   **Hand Picking:** In cases of low infestation, adult beetles can be hand-picked, preferably in the morning or evening, and destroyed. Exercise caution as blister beetles can release a blistering fluid.

2.  **Chemical Control:**
    *   If the infestation is severe and causing economic damage (e.g., more than 5-10 beetles per plant or significant flower damage), chemical intervention may be necessary. Apply insecticides during the flowering stage when beetles are most active.

    *   **Recommended CIBRC Approved Insecticides:**
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** Apply at a rate of **200-250 ml per acre** in 200-400 litres of water.
        *   **Malathion 50% EC:** Apply at a rate of **1.0 - 1.25 litres per acre** in 200-400 litres of water.
        *   **Quinalphos 25% EC:** Apply at a rate of **1.0 - 1.5 litres per acre** in 200-400 litres of water.

    *   Always ensure thorough coverage of the plant canopy, especially the flowers. Follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions.

**Control of Weevils in Guar:**

This is not known to affect Guar as a significant field pest in Haryana. While some weevil species are pests of stored grains or other crops, they are not typically reported as major field pests of Guar.

**Control of Sawflies in Guar:**

This is not known to affect Guar as a significant field pest in Haryana. Sawflies are primarily pests of cruciferous crops (like mustard) and are not commonly associated with Guar.
