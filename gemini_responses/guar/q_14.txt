As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling soil pests like termites and root-knot nematodes in Guar (Cluster bean) in Haryana. Effective management involves an integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods.

**General Management Principles for Soil Pests in Guar:**

1.  **Field Sanitation:** Remove crop residues, weeds, and stubble that can harbor pests.
2.  **Deep Summer Ploughing:** Exposes soil pests (termites, nematodes, pupae) to the sun, birds, and predators, reducing their populations.
3.  **Organic Matter Addition:** Incorporating well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost improves soil health, enhances beneficial microbial activity, and can suppress nematode populations.
4.  **Crop Rotation:** Rotate Guar with non-host crops (e.g., cereals like wheat, barley) to break the pest life cycle. Avoid continuous cultivation of susceptible crops.

### **1. Termite (Dimag) Control in Guar**

Termites are a significant pest in arid and semi-arid regions like Haryana, causing damage to roots and stems, leading to wilting and plant death, especially in young Guar plants.

**A. Cultural Practices:**

*   Ensure proper irrigation to maintain soil moisture, as termites prefer dry conditions.
*   Remove any dead wood or organic debris from the field that can attract termites.

**B. Chemical Control:**

Chemical control is highly effective, especially as a preventive measure.

*   **Seed Treatment (Preventive):**
    *   Treating seeds before sowing provides early protection to germinating seedlings.
    *   **Imidacloprid 600 FS:** Apply at 5-7 ml per kg of seed.
    *   **Fipronil 5% FS:** Apply at 6-9 ml per kg of seed.

*   **Soil Application (at sowing or pre-sowing):**
    *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC:** Apply 2-4 litres per acre, mixed with 200-400 litres of water, and drench the soil or apply through irrigation at the time of sowing or before.
    *   **Fipronil 0.3% GR:** Apply 6-10 kg per acre, broadcast evenly and incorporate into the soil at the time of sowing.

### **2. Nematode (Root-knot) Control in Guar**

Root-knot nematodes (*Meloidogyne* species) are a major problem, causing galls on roots, stunting, nutrient deficiency symptoms, and significant yield reduction in Guar.

**A. Cultural Practices:**

*   **Resistant Varieties:** If available and suitable for your region, choose nematode-resistant Guar varieties.
*   **Solarization:** In small plots, covering moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets during hot summer months can reduce nematode populations.
*   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporate neem cake (200-400 kg/acre) or other oil cakes into the soil 2-3 weeks before sowing. These release compounds toxic to nematodes and enhance beneficial microbial activity.

**B. Biological Control:**

Biological agents are highly recommended for sustainable nematode management in pulses like Guar.

*   **Purpureocillium lilacinum (formerly Paecilomyces lilacinus):**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 2.5 kg per acre, mixed with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed FYM or compost, and broadcast evenly in the field before sowing or at the time of sowing.
    *   **Seed Treatment:** Apply 5-10 g per kg of seed.
*   **Trichoderma viride / Trichoderma harzianum:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 2.5 kg per acre, mixed with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed FYM or compost, and broadcast evenly in the field before sowing. *Trichoderma* helps in overall soil health and suppresses various soil-borne pathogens, including some nematode activity.

**C. Chemical Control:**

Chemical nematicides should be used judiciously and as a last resort, especially considering the cost-benefit for field crops like Guar.

*   **Carbosulfan 25% EC:**
    *   **Soil Drench:** Apply 1-2 litres per acre, mixed with sufficient water, and drench the soil around the root zone at the time of sowing or early crop stage.
    *   **Seed Treatment:** Apply 20 ml per kg of seed.

Always follow the instructions on the product label for dosage, application method, and safety precautions. For specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions, it is advisable to consult with local agricultural extension officers or HAU experts.
