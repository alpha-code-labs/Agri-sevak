Dropping of flowers, fruits, and tinda/bolls in Guar (cluster bean) is a common physiological phenomenon often triggered by various environmental stresses and nutritional imbalances. As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend a multi-pronged approach to minimize this issue:

1.  **Optimized Agronomic Practices:**
    *   **Water Management:** Ensure adequate and timely irrigation, especially during flowering and pod development stages. Both drought stress and waterlogging can lead to significant dropping. Maintain proper drainage in the field.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Conduct soil testing to identify nutrient deficiencies. Ensure balanced fertilization based on soil test reports.
        *   Apply recommended doses of Phosphorus (P) and Potassium (K) as they play crucial roles in flowering and fruiting.
        *   **Micronutrient Application:** Deficiencies of certain micronutrients, particularly Boron and Zinc, are often linked to flower and fruit drop.
            *   **Boron:** If Boron deficiency is suspected or confirmed, apply **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate) at 1.5-2.0 kg/acre as a soil application before sowing, or 0.1% (1 g/L) foliar spray of **Borax** at pre-flowering and pod initiation stages.
            *   **Zinc:** For Zinc deficiency, apply **Zinc Sulphate** at 10-12 kg/acre as a soil application before sowing, or 0.5% (5 g/L) foliar spray of **Zinc Sulphate** at 30-45 days after sowing.
            *   **Molybdenum:** In acidic soils, Molybdenum deficiency can occur. Apply **Sodium Molybdate** at 0.5 g/L as a foliar spray at the pre-flowering stage.
    *   **Weed Control:** Keep the field free of weeds to reduce competition for water, nutrients, and light.
    *   **Plant Spacing:** Maintain optimal plant spacing to ensure proper light penetration and air circulation, reducing stress.

2.  **Hormonal Management:**
    *   To reduce flower and fruit drop, especially under mild stress conditions, application of plant growth regulators can be beneficial.
        *   **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA):** Spray **Naphthalene Acetic Acid** (NAA) at 10-20 ppm (10-20 mg/L) at the pre-flowering stage and repeat if necessary at the pod initiation stage. This helps in better retention of flowers and young pods.

3.  **Pest and Disease Management:**
    *   A healthy plant is less prone to dropping. Control sucking pests (like aphids, jassids, thrips) and diseases (like bacterial blight, powdery mildew) that can weaken the plant and indirectly lead to flower/fruit drop. Consult specific recommendations for pest and disease control in Guar.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always ensure proper spray coverage and use appropriate spray volume.
*   Avoid spraying during high temperatures or strong winds.
*   Follow label instructions for all chemical applications.
