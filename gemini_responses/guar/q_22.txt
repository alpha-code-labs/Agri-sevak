As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), here are the recommended cultivation practices for Guar in Haryana:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   Guar is best sown by drilling in rows. This method ensures uniform seed distribution, proper planting depth, and facilitates subsequent inter-cultivation operations like weeding and thinning. Broadcasting is generally not recommended due to uneven plant stand and difficulties in weed management.
*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   The optimal planting depth for Guar seeds is 2-4 cm. Sowing seeds too deep can lead to poor germination and delayed emergence, especially in heavy soils or if soil crusting occurs.
*   **Spacing:**
    *   **Row-to-row spacing:** Maintain a distance of 30-45 cm between rows. For rainfed conditions, a wider spacing of 45 cm is often preferred to conserve moisture.
    *   **Plant-to-plant spacing:** After emergence, thin the plants to achieve a spacing of 10-15 cm within the row. This ensures adequate space for individual plant growth, light penetration, and nutrient uptake.
*   **Seed Dose (Seed Rate):**
    *   For grain production (gum purpose): 15-20 kg/acre.
    *   For fodder purpose: 25-30 kg/acre.
    *   Always use good quality, certified seeds with a high germination percentage. It is highly recommended to treat seeds with appropriate fungicides and insecticides before sowing to protect against early seedling diseases and pests.
