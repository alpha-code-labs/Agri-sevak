As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified seed and soil treatment processes for Guar (Cluster Bean) cultivation in Haryana:

### Seed Treatment Process for Guar

**Purpose:** To protect germinating seeds and young seedlings from seed-borne and soil-borne diseases (such as damping-off and root rot), enhance early vigor, and improve nutrient uptake.

**Recommended Process:**

1.  **Fungicidal Treatment:**
    *   This is the first and crucial step to protect against fungal pathogens.
    *   Treat seeds with **Carboxin 37.5% + Thiram 37.5% WS** at a rate of 2.5 grams per kg of seed.
    *   Alternatively, you can use **Carbendazim 50% WP** at 2 grams per kg of seed, or **Thiram 75% WS** at 2.5-3 grams per kg of seed.
    *   Mix the fungicide thoroughly with the seeds until they are uniformly coated.

2.  **Bio-fungicidal Treatment (Optional but Highly Recommended):**
    *   After the fungicidal treatment, apply a bio-fungicide to further enhance protection against soil-borne pathogens and promote plant growth.
    *   Treat seeds with **Trichoderma viride** (or *Trichoderma harzianum*) formulation at 5-10 grams per kg of seed.
    *   Allow the seeds to dry in shade for about 30 minutes after this application.

3.  **Bio-fertilizer Treatment:**
    *   This step is vital for legumes like Guar to improve nitrogen fixation and phosphorus availability.
    *   After fungicidal and bio-fungicidal treatments (if applied), prepare a slurry by mixing 200-250 grams of **Rhizobium culture** and 200-250 grams of **PSB (Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria) culture** with a small amount of water for 10-15 kg of seeds.
    *   Gently mix the seeds with the slurry until they are uniformly coated.
    *   Dry the treated seeds in shade for at least 30 minutes before sowing.

**Important Notes for Seed Treatment:**
*   Always follow the sequence: **Fungicide → Bio-fungicide → Bio-fertilizer**. This order ensures the viability of beneficial microbes.
*   Sow the treated seeds within 24 hours for optimal effectiveness.

### Soil Treatment Process for Guar

**Purpose:** To manage soil-borne diseases, improve soil health, and enhance nutrient availability in the root zone.

**Recommended Process:**

1.  **Organic Amendment and Bio-fungicide Application:**
    *   This is a fundamental step for managing soil-borne diseases and improving soil structure.
    *   Incorporate 2.5 kg of **Trichoderma viride** (or *Trichoderma harzianum*) formulation per acre.
    *   Mix the **Trichoderma** thoroughly with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost.
    *   Allow this mixture to enrich for 7-10 days under shade with adequate moisture.
    *   Broadcast the enriched mixture evenly over the field and incorporate it into the soil during the final land preparation, ideally 7-10 days before sowing. This helps in suppressing soil-borne fungal pathogens like *Fusarium* and *Rhizoctonia* that cause root rot.

2.  **Nematode Management (if a problem is identified):**
    *   If root-knot nematodes are a known problem in your field (confirmed through soil testing), specific measures are required.
    *   Apply **Paecilomyces lilacinus** (or *Purpureocillium lilacinum*) formulation at 2.5 kg per acre, mixed with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed FYM/compost. This mixture should be broadcasted and incorporated into the soil during final land preparation.
    *   Chemical nematicides are generally not recommended as a routine soil treatment for Guar due to their environmental impact and potential for resistance development. They should only be considered if a severe nematode infestation is confirmed through soil testing and biological methods are insufficient. In such specific and severe cases, consult with HAU experts for precise recommendations, which might involve granular applications of CIBRC-approved nematicides like **Phorate 10G** at 4 kg per acre or **Carbofuran 3G** at 10 kg per acre at the time of sowing, strictly adhering to safety guidelines and application protocols.
