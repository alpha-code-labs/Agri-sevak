Namaste, Kisan Bhaiyon! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I understand the critical role of micronutrients in ensuring healthy growth and optimal yield of Guar (Cluster Bean). Addressing micronutrient deficiencies requires a scientific approach, starting with accurate diagnosis.

**Importance of Diagnosis:**
Before applying any micronutrient, it is crucial to conduct a **soil test** and, if possible, **plant tissue analysis**. Visual symptoms can sometimes be misleading or overlap between different deficiencies. A proper diagnosis will help in applying the right nutrient in the correct quantity, preventing both deficiency and toxicity.

Here's how to address the specific micronutrient deficiencies in Guar:

---

### General Recommendations for Micronutrient Application:

*   **Foliar Application:** Provides quick relief and is effective for immediate correction of deficiencies. Apply during cooler parts of the day (morning or late afternoon) to avoid scorching. Ensure good spray coverage.
*   **Soil Application:** Provides a more sustained supply of nutrients and is suitable for long-term correction, especially when deficiencies are widespread or severe. Apply at the time of sowing or before.

### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted plant growth, small leaves (often called 'little leaf'), interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, and sometimes bronzing of older leaves.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray a 0.5% solution of **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** (5 g/L of water) or a 0.1% solution of **Zinc EDTA** (1 g/L of water). Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, starting from 30-40 days after sowing.
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 5-10 kg/acre of **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** at the time of sowing.

### 2. Iron (Fe) / Ferrous Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Prominent interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on young leaves, while the veins remain green. In severe cases, the entire leaf may turn yellow or even white.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray a 0.5-1% solution of **Ferrous Sulphate Heptahydrate** (5-10 g/L of water) or a 0.1% solution of **Ferrous EDTA** (1 g/L of water). Apply 2-3 sprays at 7-10 day intervals, especially during the vegetative growth phase.
    *   **Soil Application:** In alkaline soils common in Haryana, soil application of iron is less effective. However, if recommended by soil test, apply 10-20 kg/acre of **Ferrous Sulphate Heptahydrate** or 2-3 kg/acre of **Ferrous EDTA** before sowing.

### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, death of terminal buds and growing points, brittle young leaves, poor flowering, and reduced pod setting.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray a 0.1-0.2% solution of **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (1-2 g/L of water) or **Boric Acid** (1-2 g/L of water) at pre-flowering and pod development stages.
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 0.5-1 kg/acre of **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** or 1-2 kg/acre of **Borax** (Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate) at the time of sowing. **Caution:** Boron has a narrow range between deficiency and toxicity, so apply strictly based on soil test recommendations.

### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Death of growing points (meristems), young leaves become distorted, hooked, or show marginal necrosis. Poor root development.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray a 0.5-1% solution of **Calcium Nitrate** (5-10 g/L of water) or **Calcium Chloride** (5-10 g/L of water) during active growth.
    *   **Soil Application:** If soil test indicates low calcium, apply **Gypsum** (Calcium Sulphate Dihydrate) as per soil test recommendations, especially in sodic soils common in Haryana, which also supplies calcium.

---

### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves (yellowing between veins, while veins remain green). Leaves may become brittle or develop reddish-purple tints.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray a 1-2% solution of **Magnesium Sulphate Heptahydrate** (10-20 g/L of water) during the vegetative growth phase.
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 10-20 kg/acre of **Magnesium Sulphate Heptahydrate** at the time of sowing.

---

### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, often accompanied by small necrotic spots. Growth may be stunted.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray a 0.5% solution of **Manganese Sulphate Monohydrate** (5 g/L of water) or a 0.1% solution of **Manganese EDTA** (1 g/L of water). Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals.
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 5-10 kg/acre of **Manganese Sulphate Monohydrate** at the time of sowing.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always use clean water for spraying.
*   Consider adding a non-ionic surfactant (wetting agent) to foliar sprays for better absorption, if recommended by the product manufacturer.
*   Never mix different micronutrient solutions without checking for compatibility.
*   For specific recommendations tailored to your farm, please consult with the experts at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU) or your local Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) with your soil test report.

By following these scientifically verified recommendations, you can effectively manage micronutrient deficiencies in Guar and ensure a healthy, productive crop.
