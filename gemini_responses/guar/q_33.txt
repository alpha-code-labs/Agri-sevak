As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an integrated approach for effective weed management in Guar (Cluster Bean) to minimize yield losses. Weed competition, especially during the first 30-45 days after sowing, can significantly reduce Guar yields.

Here's how to control the specified weeds in Guar:

**I. Integrated Weed Management (IWM) Approach**

A combination of cultural, mechanical, and chemical methods is most effective.

**II. Cultural and Mechanical Methods**

*   **Timely Sowing:** Sowing Guar at the optimal time can help the crop establish quickly and compete better with weeds.
*   **Seed Bed Preparation:** A well-prepared, fine seedbed helps in uniform germination of Guar and allows for easier early weeding.
*   **Inter-cultivation/Hand Weeding:**
    *   One to two hand weedings or inter-cultivations are highly effective, especially during the initial 20-45 days after sowing.
    *   The first weeding should be done around 20-25 days after sowing (DAS), and the second if needed, around 40-45 DAS.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotating Guar with non-leguminous crops can help break the life cycle of specific weeds.
*   **Clean Seed:** Use certified, weed-free Guar seeds to prevent the introduction of new weed seeds, especially parasitic ones like Amarbail.

**III. Chemical Control (Herbicide Application)**

Herbicides can be used as pre-emergence (before weed emergence) or post-emergence (after weed emergence). Always ensure proper calibration of sprayers and uniform application.

**A. Pre-emergence Herbicides (for Broadleaf, Narrowleaf weeds, and Amarbail suppression):**

These herbicides are applied within 1-3 days after sowing, before the emergence of weeds and the crop. They provide a broad spectrum of control against many annual broadleaf and narrowleaf weeds, including early suppression of Amarbail.

*   **For Broadleaf and Narrowleaf Weeds (including Bathu, Congress grass, and early Amarbail suppression):**
    *   Apply **Pendimethalin** 30% EC at 3.3 Litres per acre in 200-300 Litres of water.
    *   Alternatively, apply **Pendimethalin** 38.7% CS at 2.6 Litres per acre in 200-300 Litres of water.
    *   Alternatively, apply **Pendimethalin** 50% EC at 2.0 Litres per acre in 200-300 Litres of water.
    *   Another option is **Fluchloralin** 45% EC at 2.0 Litres per acre, incorporated into the soil before sowing.

**B. Post-emergence Herbicides (for specific weed types):**

These are applied when weeds are actively growing, typically at the 2-4 leaf stage, and the crop is around 20-30 days old.

*   **For Broadleaf Weeds (including Bathu, Congress grass) and some Narrowleaf Weeds:**
    *   Apply **Imazethapyr** 10% SL at 750-1000 ml per acre in 200-300 Litres of water, when weeds are at the 2-4 leaf stage (typically 20-25 DAS).

*   **For Narrowleaf Weeds (Grasses, including Phalaris minor):**
    *   If narrowleaf weeds are predominant, apply one of the following graminicides when weeds are at the 2-4 leaf stage (typically 20-25 DAS):
        *   **Quizalofop-ethyl** 5% EC at 1.0 Litre per acre in 200-300 Litres of water.
        *   **Fenoxaprop-p-ethyl** 9% EC at 660-770 ml per acre in 200-300 Litres of water.
        *   **Fenoxaprop-p-ethyl** 10% EC at 600-700 ml per acre in 200-300 Litres of water.
        *   **Fluazifop-p-butyl** 25% EC at 500-750 ml per acre in 200-300 Litres of water.

**IV. Specific Weed Control Notes:**

*   **Amarbail (*Cuscuta spp.*):**
    *   Prevention is key: Use clean, certified Guar seeds free from Amarbail seeds.
    *   Pre-emergence application of **Pendimethalin** can offer some initial suppression.
    *   Once Amarbail attaches to Guar plants, chemical control becomes very difficult without harming the crop. Manual removal of infested Guar plants along with the Amarbail before it sets seed is the most effective method.
*   **Bathu (*Chenopodium album*):**
    *   Effectively controlled by pre-emergence **Pendimethalin** or post-emergence **Imazethapyr**.
*   **Congress grass (*Parthenium hysterophorus*):**
    *   Effectively controlled by pre-emergence **Pendimethalin** or post-emergence **Imazethapyr**. Manual removal before flowering is also highly recommended to prevent seed dispersal.
*   **Orobanche (*Orobanche spp.*):**
    *   This is not known to affect Guar.
*   **Phalaris minor (*Phalaris minor*):**
    *   While primarily a weed of wheat, if present in Guar, it can be controlled by pre-emergence **Pendimethalin** or post-emergence graminicides like **Quizalofop-ethyl**, **Fenoxaprop-p-ethyl**, or **Fluazifop-p-butyl**.

**V. General Precautions for Herbicide Application:**

*   Always read and follow the label instructions of the herbicide product.
*   Use appropriate safety gear (gloves, mask, protective clothing).
*   Ensure the sprayer is clean and calibrated correctly for uniform application.
*   Avoid spraying on windy days to prevent drift to non-target crops.
*   Do not apply herbicides if rain is expected within 6-8 hours.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension specialists for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions.
